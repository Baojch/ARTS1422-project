设定很新颖，虽然没有中文但勉强能玩懂。

进入战局后，会显示一块固定的主板，主板上有CPU、各种接口、外接USB口、数据库、光盘驱动器、电源、金手指等等···

武器有机枪、导弹、炸弹
建设选项有机枪炮塔、火焰喷射塔、内存生产设施。

开局就会有USB接口接入主板，然后会产生各种敌人小兵、大兵、Boss甚至是炸弹等等，也会出现医生。玩家的目的是消灭除了医生外的其他敌人。
可以通过武器攻击，也可以建设炮塔在必经之路上让炮塔自动攻击。炮塔的建设位置是固定的，但基本够用。

玩家还需要通过CPU输出小兵去把地图上的资源收集起来，并派小兵升级数据库，数据库一共3个等级，升到顶级后数据库会向光驱备份数据···

每个战局都有多个任务，但任务完成后···战局并没有自动结束或完成，而是给一个提示，玩家再去主菜单选择关机···关机后CPU主屏降低，最后蓝屏···

完成任务后对应的任务角标会变成金色的。

完成任务收集资源能对现有武器进行升级，升级后下次进入游戏就能使用更强力的武器炮塔咯。
前期武器很弱，后期武器就很强了，一颗炸弹简直跟核弹一样。

有些设定有点怪，比如
[list]
    [*]任务完成后要玩家自己到菜单关闭，而不是完成提示后自动关闭···可能毕竟是人工防御，所以关机也要人工吧···如果从菜单退出，似乎系统会继续运行···无限期运行下去？？
    [*]建设选项有个恶心的地方在于需要的资源数量没有直观显示···每次点都提示内存不够没法建···
[/list]

不过可能正因为这些个奇怪设定让游戏吸引人吧。
玩着还是很不错的，塔防类大多都很费时间，这游戏后面关卡的要求也比较恶心人···",1693403000,1693403000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

So let's see how that goes in-game.

[b]Tower Defense :[/b] The aim of the game is to fend off waves of enemies until you achieve a set of objectives. And for that, you're going to need guns. [strike]And if that don't work... use more guns.[/strike] You have both a close range turret slot, and a long-range one, which makes strategic placement a key to success.

[b]Orbital Shooter :[/b] To catch up on enemies who slipped past your turrets, fend off the massive bosses and target other items of interest your turrets don't shoot, you will have 3 weapon slots at your disposal : a gun, a missile launcher and a nuke. Each more powerful than the previous, but also slower to reach the ground. Choose between fast single-target damage and powerful nuke depending on your needs and emergency.

[b]RTS :[/b] In addition to your two offensive turrets, you can also deploy a building that will harvest currency for you. Your orbital guns cost money to fire, and each turret deployed becomes increasingly more expensive. You must also manage other systems on the board with various effects and juggling between cooldowns and deciding when to spend money on what is a crucial aspect of the game.

[b]RPG (?) :[/b] Each level completed grants you points to spend on upgrading your defense system. Your guns and towers can be improved, your production tower enhanced, and your CPU core upgraded for extra HP and added functionalities. The game features 7 different board levels, each featuring 7 distinct missions with various completion criterias, and 3 difficulty levels increasing the number and speed of enemies, adding challenge and replayability to the game.

I have 13 hours on the game and I am somewhere between the levels 3 and 4, taking my time to complete the missions in Hard difficulty mode. With more complex and harder systems ahead, I believe I have only started scratching the surface of what this game has to offer.
The level rotation can be both confusing and sickening, but can be permanently turned off from the level options (I'm a little puzzled as why it's on in the first place, to be honest, but at least it can be disabled).
I still want to recommand this game to salute the work of a lone dev who decided to release his own take on the Tower Defense genre, and did a pretty good job at it. The game has a great visual design, guns all have different sounds, the gameplay is a smooth, perfectly bug-free experience in my entire playtime, and I'll sure keep playing it !",1628443746,1628443925,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Zu Beginn war ich skeptisch wie RTS mit TD gemischt werden soll, aber es gibt tatsächlich eine krasse Mischung aus Strategie, Taktik und Ausführung.

Die Strategie ist die Auswahl der Türme und Waffen, die Taktik die Platzierung der Türme und die Ausführung ist der Einsatz der Waffen. Jeder Part wird durch die schönen Quests beeinflusst. Die Gegner sind verständlich und üben die Richtige menge an Druck und Gefahr aus.

Das Spiel ist natürlich nicht Fehlerlos, meiner Meinung nach machen diese Fehler aber nicht viel aus.

Bugs oder Glichtes sind nur selten vorhanden.

Zu den Fehlern gehört, meiner Meinung nach, dass die Kleinreichweitentürme eigentlich nur Müll sind und, dass die Türme zu schnell zu teuer werden. Beides lässt sich aber durch Planung minimieren.

They have complex 3D graphics to render a minimalist 2D playing surface.

己方主要有两种防御方法
一种是使用主动武器（快捷键E切换），三种武器，分别是机枪、小范围AOE的导弹、大范围AOE的炸弹等。每次攻击都会消耗一定的资源
一种是建造防御建筑（快捷键R切换），同样是三种，分别是AOE的塔、单体攻击的塔，还有产生资源的塔。其中前两种攻击类防御塔只能建造在指定的范围内，并且所有塔的建造价格会随着已有塔的数量而提高
敌人固定从几个入口出现（比如USB、网口等位置），每个挑战关卡都有3个任务目标，各不相同，大致都是存活一段时间、击杀一定数量的敌人等等、还有一些比较难的任务，比如建造数量少于多少个，主动释放攻击数量少于多少次，就需要合理安排你的对策
敌人中除了白色、黄色三角这些小兵，还有蓝色圆圈攻击后可以获得少量内存资源，红色圆圈攻击后引爆小范围AOE的特殊无害NPC
游戏玩法还算是比较多，需要认真的打完引导部分，对操作能有个比较明确的了解
另外开发者很用心的给每个引导都做了视频讲解，就算从文字上无法了解怎么完成任务、但看一下视频大概也能猜到个大致了
每次完成任务，你都可以获得一些RAM资源，用来升级解锁更强力的武器或者防御塔效果
不过关卡的评价系统真的没有搞明白，就算升级了强力装备后反过来重新挑战、快速完成任务后仍然拿不到最高评价，不知道这个评价规则是怎么样的

Artificical Defense is not just an ordinary TD game, because you spend only ~15% of total gaming time on postioning and upgrading towers. The game contains some RTS elements. You can place ""mines"" and increase you ""gold"" income defending ""harvesters"". 

You will spend the most of gaming time on aiming the enemies from the orbital. It' really cool. You have 3 different weapons: cannon (a couple of fast but weak shots with small area of effect), rocket launcher (average damage and average area) and bomb (one slow shot with huge damage and area). Every shot cost ""gold"". So you can't just shoot, because you will out of money soon. You must aim carefully. Every shot has delay before impact. If you kill some neutral enemies this will have bad consequences.
I found this part of the game the most interesting.

You have a main objective and 2 bonus objectives for every mission. If you complete them you get ""RAM"" in-game value. You can spend it on various upgrades for weapons and towers beetwen missions.

I like the game setting. You are defensive program which proctects the computer. Actually, i can't undestand why the programm use Rockets and Bomb inside PC. It's nonsense. I would replace them with Anti-virus, Firewall, etc. It would perfectly fit.
Anyway, i like how the game looks. UI design is undestanding. Effects are at the proper level.

What i didn't like.
 - The first tutoring mission made me angry. You have to make exact actions but sometimes you don't undestand what you need to do. I wish developer improves it.
- There is the same map for several campaign missions. Yeah, every mission has diffrenet objectives and enemies' waves every time . But i would like to see more maps in the game.
- Music is good. But there is only 1 track for 1 chapter. It gets annoying very soon.
- I would like to see more diversity in towers and enemies.

Game is good (especially for one man made). Game is cheap.

Some of those things being that I have to -earn- basic functionality like speeding up the game and zooming into the battlefield via certain upgrades to my ""hard drive"".  It sounds cute, but... seriously?  The introduction was very shaky and almost off-putting, with it just giving you lines and lines of text, complex UI and hotkeys, and indicators to click this-now do that-now click here, and go through the motions just so you've done them, like a cheap mobile app.  Something like slowly introducing mechanics bit by bit in the first moments of a level would fit this much better, not literal youtube videos comprised of (assumedly) the developer playing and commentating the intros.  Which, by the way, you can speed up and zoom in in the tutorial, then it's taken away for reasons.

It took what felt like 30-45 minutes to really adapt to the game and its interface and understanding all of the mechanics, which in reality are really simple, but they're explained so abruptly it's hard to take it all in.  When I finally felt comfortable actually playing the damn thing, soon enough it already felt kind of shallow, slow, and babying, with these extremely simple first levels, and the notion that the entire rest of the game isn't going to get much more intricate.  Another hunch is that he thought the UI and controls were so alien that he wanted the most absolute tender beginning to not scare people away.

So, a quick recap - the introduction and general pacing is a mess, the game feels shallow, and your linear upgrades are locked behind exponentially more expensive upgrades which just take playtime.  Thing is, there's upsides to the ""labor of love""-ness.

Once you sort of abandon your own pre-existing notions and instead walk in the developer's shoes in such a game like this, you start to see some of the design decisions.  Things start to click, to flow together, and fall in place, and while I'm still not really sure it's much deeper than I'm imagining, it feels a lot more entertaining to play - especially if my hopes for what is in store fall into place.  The abstract keybindings feel less strange, the global aiming and prediction... could still use a re-imagining but it's less terrible after a bit, the usage of weapons and towers become more clear, that kind of thing.

The music and the aesthetic are about the only charismatic things in this game, which I guess in my case were enough to keep me invested until I figured the rest of the project out.  The presentation as a whole is very inviting.  The inoffensive and energetic EDM, the shading, colors, and menus, the minor voice overs, the animations of pretty much everthing fits nice and looks nice, the clean UI, and so on.

Bottom line:  it's very alien, but it's interesting and filled with heart and effort.  I realize this is as much ""review"" as it is just my thoughts on it as a project.",1488895041,1488895041,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The main problem which however soured me off the game, is its committing one of the cardinal sins of game design: the player is given a lot (can't say all for sure) of the upgrades to play the, belabored, tutorial levels, then stripped of them and thrown into the actual game. Additionally, all of the weapons have sort of a ballistic effect, in that the ammo takes time to reach the ground: crucially, the tutorial teaches the timings for the fully-upgraded weapons, then dialing it all the way back so even the basic 'sniper' shot (or basic/shortest reload time) takes what feels like an incredible long time to get to the ground, turning a mechanic that already wasn't all that enjoyable in the first place, into sheer frustration when trying to hit fast-moving targets. In fact, it does seem the developer may be aware of some parts of this issue, having released [url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/443420/announcements/detail/527312601041852492]a 'balance update'[/url] aiming to make the game easier, whereas I feel, after the update, it's not so much that the game is hard per se, but rather, assuming the shot timing is fully intentional, that the way the weapons are introduced is hardly the best: a difficulty curve is almost invariably about offering just enough challenge to make the player get better while at the same time making them feel good about themselves, this game has it backwards.

The whole design seems pretty elaborate, with many different units and building types; maybe too elaborate, and I would say front-loaded, making the introduction feeling rushed and sort of confusing, especially in comparison to the studied difficulty curve and pace, and essential design, of classics of the genre like Defense Grid.

I also feel the computer metaphor is quite strained and doesn't really work all that well: the main currency is called RAM, and it's gained by shooting baddies and in other ways, like ...connecting to databases and building production towers ...huh ? And lost by having the baddies reach the OS (?); I'm afraid it doesn't make a terrible lot of sense to me: at some point even 'medic' units are introduced - how do medics fit in this self-proclaimed ""VR"" world?

Nevertheless, mechanically, there may be a decent enough game in there, but I'll never know because the way it is designed lost me before I could find it.",1488002228,1488013170,False,5,0,0.599437236785888672,0,False,False,False,False,,,

(如果你在其他地方看到以下一樣的內容，別懷疑那就是我寫的XD)
遊戲的介紹有這麼一句話：
You are the machine, a mighty computer-system defending its servers against swarms of intruding creeps.

來防禦你的server吧！
(難怪我覺得那看起來很像主機板還有USB介面，)
(上面還有像晶片的東西...)

接觸新遊戲最重要的一定是習慣它的操作，
但我認為你要先習慣它的介面。
看起來似乎有點複雜？不用擔心，習慣就好了，
一開始從教學任務開始吧！
這款遊戲若不玩教學任務，絕對辜負了作者的一片苦心。
(有三個成就，初期賺RAM的好方法，又能快速上手。)

一開始教學任務採用引導模式，注意操作介面上的訊息，
鍵盤按哪個是什麼功能，
使用Alt切換滑鼠移動模式，全部都會教給你！
英文看不懂？
作者還很貼心在介面訊息裡附上youtube演示教學影片。
(但影片還是英文喔XD)
教學任務不要被一大群自USB後門漏洞衝進來的入侵者嚇死，
這是教學任務。

教學任務三大基本：介面操作，攻擊，基礎建造。
(多玩幾次就會啦！)
(我很喜歡那個建造防禦塔時的特效，空投降落的時候真是太帥了！)
三大基礎武器：子彈、飛彈、炸彈。

遊戲視角設計會自動緩慢旋轉可以按ESC暫停來調整是否旋轉。
如果你認為畫面顯示有點暗，可以將「CAM EFFECTS」關閉。

教學任務裡，每項關卡有三種挑戰，
完成挑戰會有「叮叮叮」聲提醒你。
還要手動按暫停去按Shut down喔！
(我沒注意第一個教學說明傻傻地玩了20分鐘XD)
完成了教學任務，開始進行關卡挑戰吧！

在關卡挑戰開始前，
如果有新東西都會告訴你他有什麼功能，要認真看喔！

然後他就會很殘酷地告訴你，
喔~剛剛你用的高科技武器都是借來的喔......
(那好用的機關槍，還有飛彈，還有炸彈呢？)
(現在全都是最低等武器啦，X)
沒關係慢慢賺RAM去再去升級武器吧！
武器升級後還是可以選擇使用舊武器的。
看Steam商店的遊戲介紹與展示擷圖後來還有核彈可以丟呢！

在這裡說一個技巧，使用基本子彈攻擊要學會「拉線」，
這是什麼意思呢？
攻擊設計是有延遲的，而子彈攻擊一次會射好幾發。
善用預測敵方行進路徑進行「預瞄攻擊」。
(聽不懂沒關係，玩的時候再去體會吧！)

作者很貼心的對成就有強烈執著玩家
在選單裡設計了「RE-REPORT」按鈕。
說明這是可能你用離線模式遊玩時，
完成成就但成就沒有顯示成功時使用。
除非你有遇到這種問題，否則不要按。

除了三個成就是完成三個教學關卡會拿到外，
其他成就是看完成挑戰後的結算挑戰進度。

另外，
他在遊戲介面選單裡也設計了按鈕直接可連結作者個人網頁頁面。
想要遊戲增加新功能？有Bug？都可以留言給作者。
(他只有一個人在開發遊戲，)
( 所以介面訊息你會看到說沒有社群manager。)
作者個人網頁
http://www.one-man-games.com/

喔對了，最後提一個東西，
他的背景音樂很不錯聽，有電音的元素在內。
玩著玩著，喔~天啊~
這音樂和這機槍射擊的聲音、
飛彈攻擊、炸彈的聲音搭配聽起來很搭耶！
(如果你一開始在選單切換成萬聖節主題，主選單音樂會變。)

喜歡塔防的你，
不妨來試試這款具有高科技元素混搭電音風格的小品吧！

First off, the game is very unique in the way it works. From how you gather points to update things, to how you kill the enemies. The thought of a top-down shooter mixed with Tower-Defence and a tiny hint of RTS is a amazing idea and I'm excited to see more of the developers games.

The developers attempts at a mixture of visual styles; ranging from some cell-shaded, to the clear abstract style definately gives the game a very unique look; the geometric enemies make it very easy for the player to see where they're heading and is definately a positive for the game.

Furthermore, the unique sense that the game goes for somehow helps you get immersed in the game. The attempt at a story is room for huge props considering the game could have easily went without any explaination at all - you're just there to kill stuff and that's it. No; the developer is clearly dedicated and for the things that he does, deserves far more than just £3.99. At such a modest price - how could you not buy the game?

TL;DR:
The game is good, buy it.",1478388978,1478388978,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This was my original review:

""This game has a great idea with combining different gaming elements which work perfectly, but I have an issue with the game when you play with the X-Box controller. It doesn't respond properly. You follow the instruction in tutorial the same as with mouse and keyboard, but it doesn't work.""

After I made this review I was contacted by the developer telling me that he fixed the issue with the controller. I played it and it worked like a dream. Because of the helpfullness of the developer to actually fix the proble, I can honestly say that not only was it an awesome game, but the developer is awesome as well and I look forward to his next project. :)",1478029877,1478423520,True,5,0,0.544163346290588379,3,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm writing my own review, however, to bring down the ratio of positive to negative reviews, since I feel a bit deceived after buying a game that is apparently well received, but has some serious issues.

This game tries to combine the genre of tower defense with some sort of top-down shooting and a tiny bit of RTS.
The idea is nice, but it falls flat on it's face by how the game is balanced and tweaked.

[h1]The gameplay[/h1]
You have to defend your core structure from spawning enemies that simply will try to walk towards it. If an enemy touches your core, you lose your life. You win a stage by completing three objectives, which are in the vain of ""destroy 50 enemies"".

The tower defense part consists of three types of towers. One passive resource gathering tower, and two offensive towers. The offensive towers are split up into a long range single-target tower and a short range splash damage tower.

The top down shooter is the most engaging part of the gameplay. It allows you to shoot bullets and missiles from the sky that hit the ground after a delay. This makes timing your shots a crucial aspect.

The final part is the extremely barebones RTS part. You gain resources that allow you to shoot (which requires ammunition) and buy towers. There are points on the map that you can take over with a special unit that allows you to get a resource bonus. These resources have to be safely transported though, akin to how harvesters worked in Command and Conquer.

[h1]The problems[/h1]
Now to the actual plaguing issue of the game.

The tutorial gives you unlocked higher-tier weapons and tower upgrades to play with, but once you get to the actual game, you are left with peashooters. The game doesn't compensate for your lack of firepower in the first stages by giving you less enemies. You now have to deal with slowly moving hordes of enemies that you have to kill using weapons that reload slow and do little damage, and by using towers that also have to reload a long time between shots.

I had to turn the difficulty to the lowest level to be able to survive any stage. Attempting or successfully finishing a stage rewards you with points that you can spend towards unlocking better weapons. Having some sort of fun seems to behind a grindwall.

There are a handful of level packs (around 7 if I remember correctly). The levels contain multiple stages, with the only change between them being the objectives given. The layout is identical and so seem the timing of enemy spawns.

[h1]In conclusion[/h1]
So what you end up with is a neat idea packed into horrid balancing.

It is genuinely impressive that this game was made by a single person, since it looks well, sounds nice and has a decent idea behind it. The author likes to really remind you of this fact, however. Showing it in the starting screen, in it's company name and in half of his posts on the game page.

All that it needed was some playtesting and tweaking. But it seems like instead of publishing a good game the first time around, we live in a time where developers can just keep trying things with the thought of being able to patch anything in the back of their minds.

But it's not exactly a tower defense game!

It's a combination of a tower defense, RTS and something called an orbital shooter.

Tower defense?
You just build towers in the key places.

RTS?
Send your units to take over structures and defend them... Again, seems simple.

Orbital shooter?
Click on the map and you'll shoot there. It takes some time for projectiles to hit, so you need to aim to keep in mind movement speed and direction of the enemies. 

When these three simple elements are put together, the game becomes really interesting!

- In classic tower defense game:

You would build/upgrade towers and watch enemies getting killed by them.

- In this game:

You will be shooting enemies from orbit and praying to get enough resources to build a tower before you will get overwhelmed. With tower placed, you can then get more resources, because you can send your units to gather them.

Your units will move and you will try to keep enemies away from them. With air strikes. Don't hit your units! Meanwhile, enemies will also move towards your base... Or multiple bases on some maps. And control points. God help you if your control points get re-corrupted by enemies! Then you will have fewer towers, with fewer towers enemies will overwhelm you, taking away your databases, your resources and finally... It will be the end!

There are also good guys moving with enemies, DO NOT SHOOT THEM! You will be like: Oh no, my control point is attacked by yellow triangles! NUKE EVERYTHI- Oh  shit, there's good guys! Need to switch to a smaller gun.

While you will be slowly picking yellow triangles one by one with the small gun, the evil giant yellow triangle will approach your base...
But hopefully there's red power-up near your base, so you will shoot it, it will explode and probably you'll prevail. Too bad you accidentally hit the good guys and they died anyway.

BUT WAIT! While you were fighting Bill Cipher, your database got re-corrupted and it no longer produces delicious blue squares. Which are, like, super important, because without them you can't build towers and launch air strikes.

And that's only if you aren't crippled by challenges! Sometimes you aren't allowed to use big guns, sometimes you need to not lose a single unit, sometimes...

As ideias realizadas nesse jogo são muito boas, inciando pela ideia de aplicar peças de computador num jogo desse em que você precisa atualizar a BIOS, gravar dados, fazer backup, aumentar memoria RAM para poder criar/melhorar as peças e entre outras coisas evitando que os virus entrem no seu sistema operacional. 

A trilha sonora é muito boa, pois combina competamente com os cenários e estilos do jogo. Música eletrônica bem utilizadas, sons muito bem desenvolvidos. Além disso, podemos contar com um gráfico realmente bom e bem trabalhado, o que torna o jogo ainda mais envolvente e viciante. Não que o gráfico faça a diferença toda, mas esse faz sim, e esse vale a pena ser levantado.

Um jogo bem grande e completo com diversos modos de jogo e um tutorial super intuitivo e bem criado, fazendo com que o jogador não saia do jogo puto, sem saber o que fazer. A sua dificuldade é razoável, não chega a ser tão fácil assim. Existem vários upgrades que podem ser feitos para ajudar nas missões.

I have played it for many hours over the last few days and will probably play for many more - it definitely has that ""just one more game"" feel. This game has a large amount of polish - it is pretty and has tons of nice little touches.

https://youtu.be/OhsBOuwd9q4

Most (but not all) of the time the player is using an array of weapons to shoot the enemies, mainly by leading them just the right amount. Then as the in-game currency RAM accumulates, the player can place towers or conquer local structures to help them. Each mission has a slightly different set of objectives (don't use this weapon or structure, gain this much RAM, conquer this structure, etc) so despite there being only a few maps, each mission still feels different. The game is fast paced, but not so fast that people with slower reflexes (like me) can't succeed. It often feels more relentless than hectic.

The difficulty of missions ramps up smoothly. The player progresses not only by becoming better, but also by upgrading their equipment to better models through collecting RAM at the end of each mission. So far this has worked well. I'm about half way through and have not needed to grind missions yet - once a mission has been completed successfully, I move on. I am currently 20 missions in and it has taken me about 6 hours - so there is value for money (although I got my copy for free).

The theme is supposed to be computer based: the enemies are computer virii and the player defends their CPU. However, this is a weak point of the game as the theme is applied very thinly. Why is there a DJ in the computer? I don't mind as I like the music, but it still seems strange. Same with the equipment - I'm currently using an Uzi to kill computer programs (huh?). Of course, this doesn't effect the compelling gameplay, so I just ignore it.

There are so many nice little touches in this game (apart from the good balance). There are fireworks when the player reaches certain achievements. The menus bounce pleasingly. It just feels professionally done - good work for a solo dev.

This game focuses heavily on resource management and plays more like a hybrid shooter/tower defense. The tower cost scales up quickly so you can only afford to place a few strategic ones to back you up. The rest you have to shoot down with projectiles/missiles/bombs manually, and every one of those costs resources. So this is not one of those place towers and watch things die TD games. It is more challenging than most TDs, but has an interesting balance. I found it to be quite enjoyable, though frustrating at times in a type II fun sort of way.

The developer is very active. Just today I had an issue with the game, which I posted on the discussion board. Someone on the board picked up on it, notified me that the developer was offline at the time, that he has forwarded this to him. The issue was acknowledged, responded to on the board, solved, and patched within 24 hours of the issue being posted on the board. For an one-man-show developer, that is impressive.

It’s also got some strategy games elements. This game was developed by a single person and I was quite amazed at how much depth this game has. 

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]

The graphics are sharp and pretty straight forward. Most of the graphics are based on different shapes. E.g. the obstacles are square, the enemy creeps can be triangle or other shapes. The game is very colorful and pleasing to the eyes. The whole game has a PC theme going on. The levels are based on PCI card/motherboard design which has fans, USB ports, Audio ports, hard drives etc. This was pretty nice and I liked the fact that the creeps(enemies) come from the USB ports, which in real life also is most likely the places you get viruses. The game is very well designed visually and the tutorial and learning factor is made much easier the way navigation is done in the game. I had smooth over 100 FPS throughout the time I played and noticed no lag or slowdowns. 

[h1]Sound:[/h1]

While the sound can use some variety, the soundtracks that come with the game are pretty upbeat and nice to hear. Voice overs are also present in the game with the announcer having one of those 80’s era robot voices. Some of the sound effects are a bit loud compared to other things though.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

Now this game has innovated the tower defense genre. By combining top down orbital shooter mechanics, tower defense and RTS elements this game is pretty unique. There’s a lot of different missions to play. You have to defend your OS from creeps who are trying to infect it. Basically you have to stop these creeps form invading your OS. You can do this by placing towers or shooting them using your orbit guns. Using weapons and towers costs RAM which is your currency in-game. So keeping an eye on the amount of RAM is crucial as running out of it will most likely be a disaster for you. You can earn RAM by killing cookies, these cookies are harmless and spawn pretty frequently and they are trying to get to their cookie hole, so killing them nets you RAM. Other method of getting RAM is by building production towers or conquering things in the map.

To kill with your orbital shooting weapons, you have to lead your targets as the bullets/missiles take time to get there. You have a gun weapon, a missile and a nuke weapon. These are self-explanatory. The guns have the smallest hit area while the missiles have a bit bigger area and does splash damage to nearby creeps. The nuke has a larger area and does massive damage. When you start the game your weapons are not powerful at all (minus the tutorial, for tutorial they give you nice weapons). You can buy new weapons from the UPLAB by spending “kBytes”. These kBytes are earned when you do missions and the challenges earn you extra kBytes.

There are 3 types of towers you can place. Short range towers, long range towers and production towers. As their names imply, the short range has a short range of attack. The long range has long range attack and the production tower simply produces RAM from time to time. These can also be upgraded from the UPLAB. In addition to the guns and towers upgrades you also have hardware upgrades, this includes passive bonuses like health increase, fast forwarding etc.

You also have conquer option in the game. You can conquer databases and honey pots. Once you conquer them they will send out “datablips” and once these datablips reach their destination you will earn RAM. So this game requires you to do quite a lot and focus on many things at once, like placing towers, conquering stuff and concentrating on collecting RAM and shooting enemies. There’s 3 different difficulty levels so if you find the game hard you can always lower the difficulty.

The controls are probably the part which let this game down in my opinion. You can control the game in 2 ways, either drag the screen like you do in RTS games or the “move screen with mouse movement” feature can be toggled on. While this was my preferred method the mouse for some reason doesn’t feel natural. Like most of the times the mouse would move to another place instead of where I was moving the mouse. It’s like when the map rotates (which it does automatically) the mouse controls also move, so the mouse movement also moves along with the map, this can make the aiming consistently harder and you continuously have to “practice” your mouse movement before making shots. I hope the developer can add a static up, down, left, right 1:1 movement of the mouse, that can make the gameplay much easier.

    [*]Game is not a normal TD game, the way you beat a level is to complete the challenges, which also give you the resources needed to upgrade( you do get some even if you lose)

    [*]Your main goal is to complete the 3 challenges, once that is done you can then end the match, as the enemies will keep spawning

    [*]Seems like replaying the same levels over again at the beginning is the the only way to upgrade to beat almost any level beyond the first 2.

    [*]You will get overwhelmed with enemies, and using the starting few weapons are a joke for how many enemies you have to keep away even when lowering the difficulty to easy

    [*]Overall the orbital shooting that made it unique, is also the least fun and very tedious with how much you need to kill with the weapons given, so I didn't care for it(odd you think having alot of enemies would make it more fun, but not when you have to pinpoint kill every little creature.

    [*]Also the turrets don't help at all, it felt like why bother having them. Maybe when you upgrade everything this game would be amazing, I just don't want to go through the grind and not enjoy it along the way( I'm ok with grinding when it's done right. Killing Floor, Payday)

    [*]Upgrades cost is crazy for lvl 3, don't know beyond that, but bet it's higher. going from 4k to 32k and not having good enough weapons to beat later mission, meant that I would have to play the last level 32 times to get one new upgrade since my weapons sucked.

Contrary to my expectations, but not negatively impacting the results, Artificial Defense is 80-90% orbital shooter with minimal tower defense elements. This is mostly a comment there for people who really like tower defense and don't care for orbital shooter - look elsewhere.

Using the keyboard to aim is possible, but based on splitting the shots of multi-round salvos effectively, I would highly recommend against it.

The theme of the game is rather interesting, you are tasked with defending a computer system against waves of malicious software. The maps are layout fit perfectly this theme, with spawn points for the enemies being USB ports and having different types of enemies that you can kill, including neutral creeps that grant you resoruces in the form of “cookies”.

Aesthetically speaking, I’m a huge fan of these simplistic visuals and the “digital” look to them and the different tracks of eletronic music are also rather pleasant to listen to. That said, if you get stuck on a level for a while they can get quite irritating because the music just goes on a loop.

[h1]Overall gameplay[/h1]

The game lets you choose 1 out of 3 different difficulty modes with the most challenging one being “Normal”, ironic isn’t it? After playing through a couple of the first few levels I was forced to choose a lower difficulty level in order to proceed because the game was too hard on me on the “Normal” difficulty. This allowed me to return back to normal later on because, as you play you’ll gain a specific currency that you can then use to upgrade your turrets and abilities. The amount of currency that you get per level depends on the difficulty you’re playing on and if you complete or not certain sets of 3 tasks (3 tasks = 1 challenge = 1 challenge per level) that you have in each level. 

You’ll also increase your rank the higher difficulty you play on, but rank serves only as a metric and has no real impact in the outcome of the game, at least thats how I perceive it. There are a total of 49 challenges (147 challenges) and while there are only 3 weapons/abilities that you can use at any given time but their upgrades amount for a total of 21 different types of weapons. Still, they’re pretty much variants of a machine gun, rocket and a meteor attacks. In that sense, there is only 3 different towers that you can place but they also have 21 variants. You’ve got a production tower, a close range and a long range tower. Nonetheless I didn’t really find myself using towers that much, other than the production towers, when compared with other Tower Defense games and that is why I say that this is more of a top down orbital shooter than it is a Tower Defense.

On each level you’ll have to prevent the enemy creeps from reaching your nodes. You may also send units to key points in order to gain resources (RAM) and use that to buy new towers or to use your weapons, which cost a certain amount of RAM per use. The level design is probably one of the weakest points of the game for me. Levels are flat and usually the only obstacles between the enemy entry points and your OS (Operative System) are these square structures that force the enemies to go around them. Usually you can only place your offensive turrets in an area given to you on each level. Other than that, you can use your offensive anytime and anywhere you want, provided that you have the RAM for it.

[h1][b]Final verdict[/b][/h1]
[b]If you don’t mind a a mobile-esque interface and the simple visuals, and if you’re a fan of Tower Defense games who is looking for a rather unique twist on the genre, I think there is plenty in Artificial Defense for you to enjoy. Also, if you’re not a fan of Tower Defense games, don’t let that stop you because, like I’ve previously mentioned, the game can pretty much be played without recurring to towers.

Interesting because it combines 3 types of games in one and strange, well... it was all done by one guy: programming, graphics, music - all of them from one guy and all of them at a high level of polish. That by itself is enough to warrant you to try it out as it does feel like the game is the labour of someone who is a developer but first and foremost also a gamer. 

The main aim of the game is to save your OS from becoming corrupted by external sources. These sources generate invaders which try to reach your OS and corrupt it. By preventing them, both directly and indirectly, from reaching your OS and by buying time via various ways, you try to prevent the corruption from reaching your OS before you do what is known as a shutdown, i.e. you close the map and get your points. The game does not force you to do so, however and you can keep raking up points, if you are capable of doing so :P So how do the 3 mechanics fit together? Well you can directly fire and shoot (top-down) on the invaders in order to stop them. You have 3 main weapons available and each can be upgraded in between missions to increase their damage and other attributes. (This reminded me of how I used to shoot rats while playing Theme Hospital.) You can also build towers which generate resources or stop enemies passively as they flow by them. These also can be upgraded in-between missions to become more effective. Finally you can capture certain points on the map (ala Z, if anyone of you remember that game) which can be used to generate resources passively for you to use. These can be recaptured by the enemy if you are not careful! Each of the 3 mechanics require resources to be spent, but all 3 give you a way to generate resources. If you shoot what are known as cookies you gain resources, if you build a resource tower, they passively generate resources, if you capture certain points on the map they give you resources. There are a million other small things I could mention but there is depth in every part of the game.

For the negatives: I found the learning curve quite steep initially until I played a bit and discovered how it all works. After contacting the developer he has assured me that my concerns are currently being addressed in an update he is working on at the current moment. Fantastic as it would be a shame to see such a nice game not become popular because of its inherent depth in mechanics!

If you are a tower-defense fan and you like to try something different rather than the usual build tower, wait until level finishes, I would recommend trying this game.

I suppose that's the best word to describe my thoughts on this game. Finally, a tower defense game that innovates! And it's actually quite good!

[h1]The Breakdown[/h1]
So, let me clarify something - calling this a ""tower defense"" game is actually kind of horribly incorrect. It's more of an orbital shooter with a bit of TD and RTS sprinkled in the mix. I had initially thought I'd be placing towers and whatnot like usual, but instead the towers are merely an option the game includes to simply help you out.

See, Artificial Defense is what some people have called an ""orbital shooter"", like I mentioned earlier. I've never really heard this term before, but it makes sense - one of your two methods available of killing the little nasty creeps invading your computer system (the setting of the game) is to rain down bullets, rockets, and bombs onto the little buggers. It's pretty interesting, and definitely makes the game seem more RTS-like than anything.

Yet, there's also aspects of the tower defense genre of course. This means that you need to place production buildings to acquire RAM, which allows you to then either fire projectiles at the enemies yourself, since that costs RAM, or you can place either long range or short range towers. The long range towers have to reload, but their range is obviously a bit larger than the short range tower, which fires quicker but has a much smaller range than its counterpart.

The weird thing is though that for the most part I found myself rarely using offensive towers. Instead, I preferred to rush production buildings and just fire away myself at the creeps. This is because the game isn't really about lasting as long as you can, though that option is available to you. Instead, the game's progression system focuses on completing a set of 3 objectives that are specific to each level. These can include just simply killing a set number of foes or something weirder like sending out some little blobs of your own to ""conquer"" a building on the playing field. And here's where the game becomes a little too chaotic for more casual RTS players like me: juggling the 3 objectives while simultaneously trying to survive can be a bit daunting for inexperienced players in the genre. Yet, the game does include 3 difficulty settings in case things become too hard.

Thankfully, even though the 49 levels become harder as you progress, especially with the new enemies introduced every 7 levels or so, there's also a shop where upgrades for your weaponry, towers, or system itself can be bought. So, a really difficult level can be made a bit easier by buying new rockets for example. The interesting bit about the shop is that new upgrades aren't necessarily the best option for every level since older upgrades may actually be better depending on the situation. This creates a great extra layer of strategy in some cases and it's a nice touch that older upgrades can still be equipped.

In terms of the basics, that's pretty much it. The graphics aren't incredible but they're functional and fit the theme of the game (since it takes place in a computer). What did impress me however is the music - it manages to be energetic and engaging while not being overbearing or annoying. It's some kind of electronic stuff, but I enjoyed it (can you tell that I'm a musical genius who just knows all the correct terminology?).

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Pretty neat gameplay mechanics - [b]more of an orbital shooter/RTS than a tower defense though, so just be aware[/b]
[*]Diverse set of objectives - generally not just ""survive"", but much more varied and unique between levels
[*]49 challenging levels with 3 difficulty settings (and an upgrade shop!) give no shortage of content
[*]The music consists of some cool and catchy electronic tunes
[*]Steam achievements, trading cards, controller support, and Cloud saves are all available
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]The difficulty can be a little intimidating for inexperienced RTS players since the game is more RTS than TD (though there's multiple tutorials, lower difficulty levels and an upgrade shop to ease players in)
[*]The graphics are serviceable, but they aren't anything noteworthy
[*]Sound effects (especially that damn explosion noise when you exit a level) can be a bit loud by default
[/list]

Artificial Defense is something unique for its genre(s?), and that's one of the key factors I personally look at when deciding if I'm interested in a game or not. It's more of a RTS than a tower defense game, but for fans of either genre, it's a fantastic title to check out. Plus, it's made by one guy!

Artificial Defense is a very cool, compact Tower Defense Game with an unique style and dynamic gameplay!
The high complexity of the gameplay and big variety of functions can be confusing in the beginning, but after a few games I got used to without any problems.

The player is forced to pay attention to the whole map and needs to switch between classic TD elements and offense abilities. Between the games the abilities and towers can be upgraded and extended.
The game is designed for TD Lovers, but due to the offense abilities it has its own gameplay that differs completely from standard TD Games. This property also determines a challenging difficulty even for good TD Players.

Graphics and Soundtrack have a very high quality and fit the gameplay perfect.

This is one of the best Indie Games I played in a while, because of the accurate work on every aspect of the game:

Not to mention I didn't even know that the game was made by a single indie dev, not at the beginning at least. Impressive to say the least.

Well, let's stick to the ""official-ish"" format and write this review piece by piece.

Graphics - Well chosen theme, clean and easy on the eyes.

The game features a rather minimalistic graphical style which is no surprise for indie games but while many of such games go for the ""retro"" feel, this baby embraces a clean, pristine look, with a futuristic aftertaste. The well chosen theme with said style produces an aesthetic which is both pleasing to the eyes and free of any clutter while still provides ample visual feedback of your feats. My biggest problem was the tutorial popup window being in my way, but even that was only a minor annoyance (and when you are reading you are not playing anyways so...). 

Audio - Nothing extra, but perfectly fine for the role.

I didn't expect much from this department to be honest so it was a pleasant surprise to find it to be fine. Sure, can't expect an astounding musical orgy, nor a cast of world-famous voice actors, but with the game's story/theme there was no need for anything like that. There is barely any voice within the game apart from a few announcements but seeing as it's not story driven, I couldn't care less. As for the music, it has the same feel as Frozen Synapse had, but still generic enough to not get annoying over time (in case of FS while I liked the music, it was so easy to recognize that it became annoying to hear it so many times).

Story - Nonexistent. 

The game's story is... well, nonexistent. This baby is 100% about gameplay, has a pretense to it but that's about it. And nobody misses said story.

Gameplay - Challenging and light.

Surprisingly enough the game features a gameplay style where one can just sit down and enjoy a bit of action, a mix of strategy and ballistic shooting gallery, interactive towerdefense. Sitting down, playing a little on one of the maps can be a pretty good recreational activity without any need to overly stress about anything. The implemented progression system allows you to progress even with such minimal effort.
On the other hand, those that take the game more seriously are in for a treat. Completing all the objectives, covering the enemy entry points, hitting those fast moving cookies for that little bit extra money (ram), etc. can speed up progression compared to the less stressful path and provide ample challenge to those that require more than what current mainstream games usually offer. 
With the ""easy to play, hard to master"" approach and the more and more painful challenges/objectives emsire that the game stays relatively fresh and complex even if someone decides to keep playing on the very same map, over and over again for some reason.

Overall - Fun little baby and looks the part too. I'm interested if the dev behind it will continue on this path or maybe even with this very game. My main concern with such games that they make it painfully apparent that something is very wrong with the mainstream (AA+) gaming industry as indie games are generally much better in nearly every single aspect than the ""big names"".",1465591668,1465591668,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Bolder has attempted to create an entirely new genre of game in what he classifies as a combination of RTS, tower defense and orbital shooter. The player is given access to a combined total of 21 offensive weapons, 21 defensive towers and 7 hardware levels to battle their way through a massive 49 challenges across 7 different levels. There is also a mix of 13 different music tracks. At first glance I was a little staggered. This appears to be a huge number for a first time Steam developer-publisher. I was more than a little worried that the dev had bitten off more than he could chew. Grandiose plans don’t always function as fully intended.

Given my worry I am going to start with the negatives that I discovered. The game has a few bad control-related bugs that agitated me perhaps more than they ought to have. The first came when I tried to play the game with keyboard and mouse yet had my controller connected to the computer. The game doesn’t like that at all. It wont allow you to play properly with K&M when you have a controller connected. Weapons do not fire as they should and there is no aim. You can even have the weapons land on the enemies and it do nothing. I exited the game, disconnected the controller and reloaded it and the game finally played the way that it was intended.

The other mistake and for a reviewer who loves to alt-tab out to take notes on the fly it was pretty damning. Once I alt-tabbed away from the game going back to it my cursor was gone. It disappeared and I tried everything that I could think of to bring it back but that baby was done. Again, I had to exit the game in order to progress which sadly meant that I had lost my progress. 

But that’s exactly where the negatives end. Two bugs that can, I believe, be easily patched out of the game and knowing how hard Thiemo Bolder has worked on his gem will be just as soon as he finds that messy line of coding that needs to be repaired. While on the subject of hard work I sincerely believe that this game is the result of blood, sweat and more than a few tears. It’s an absolute masterclass and showmanship of how a one man developer can create a game as technically sound and enjoyable as what Artificial Defense is.

Not only does the game and the combination of genres marry very well together but the game is both exciting and enjoyable. It’s one game that I will attempt to one hundred percent with achievements. The game incorporates all of the technical aspects and mechanics that make tower defense games so thoroughly challenging. However, the shooter component of the game shines through and makes the game more exciting and fresh than your standard tower defense game. It’s a wicked combination that incorporates more than its fair share of strategy.

Once I overcame my initial bug with (the controller issue causing keyboard and mouse to be unplayable which I’m used to as a tower defense fan) I found that the game was fundamentally very simple to learn. This is in part thanks to the somewhat humorous but very easy to play through tutorials that teach you the basics. This makes the learning curve somewhat marginalized.

The beautiful thing about the game is that it encourages different styles of play. If you’re much more used to playing shooters you can emphasize that more in your playthrough than you would the tower defense aspect. Of course, the most skilled players will probably use a strong combination of both but the choice is ultimately yours and there really isn’t a right or a wrong way to play the game. You can be successful with a number of different strategies. One thing that this enables players to do is to increase their competencies in the weaker of their two chosen genres. Shooter fans may find themselves enjoying tower defense games much more than they may have previously and vice versa.

An intriguing aspect of the strategy that traditional tower defense players need to be wary of is that the avenues to the different parts of the machinery are much more varied and open than they will be traditionally used to. Learning to block paths is important but even more important is understanding and learning which paths will be unable to be blocked so that you are in your best position to thwart the AI attack. Thankfully much of the level design has been thought out to perfection.

Due to its enormous amount of possible gamestyles and fantastic reward and upgrade systems the game offers a lot of replayability. In fact, I don’t believe that a single playthrough will be anywhere close to enough for those of you who become fans of the title. I can easily see players reaching tens of hours with the title.

Artifical Defense is such a fantastic game that I have trouble believing that it was developed by just a single person. An absolute must buy.

[h1][b][i]Very few[/i] bad points,[/b][/h1] since currently some of the last levels are [b]incredibly frustrating[/b] and [b]not fun[/b] to play, as they don't rely on player skill, but most players probably [u]won't even get there[/u], and this issue is most likely going to be [b]fixed[/b] in not so long, so this is not a very big deal

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
Unfolds very [b]nicely[/b], it's pleasant to take in hand and master, not too hard to get used to, and most importantly it is really nice to play and go back to, to the point where it's [u]almost addicting[/u].
[list]
[*]The various aspects of the game blend together [b]very smoothly[/b]. You can focus on what you are most proficient with, or use every asset available to you, since one playstyle is not more efficient than the other. Furthermore, the amount of options available to you is [b]big enough[/b] that you can [u]always[/u] find something you are [b]comfortable with[/b]
[*]You can freely switch in-between levels, and replay any level on any difficulty. Levels are [b]very easy to unlock[/b] (all you have to do is complete others), and any unlocked level can be played at [u]any time[/u]. The difference in difficulty between levels is small enough that you are able to [b]successfully complete[/b] ahead later levels with [u]just a bit[/u] of skillful play
[/list]
[h1][b]Level Design[/b][/h1]
Varied levels, containing lots of [b]smartly crafted maps[/b]. The layout of each map is [b]very different[/b], and each of them asks for a particular playstyle, adding a [b]lot of diversity[/b] to the gameplay.
[list]
[*]The map design is a [u]lot richer[/u] than a regular TD game's, because each map instead of just having a few [i]unblockable paths[/i], has multiple path routes, some of which can be [b]blocked[/b], and each can have a different way of being controlled. That means, unlike other TD games, you can just use [b]countermeasures[/b] for every path instead of placing towers alongside it
[*]On top of that, the different pathways of each map are surrounded by [i]various elements[/i] you can interact with. Because of the way the maps are designed, each level unveils its available strategies like a [b]clever puzzle[/b] that you have to understand in order to be efficient

[h1][b]Progression[/b][/h1]
As said briefly above, the game gives you a [b]lot of freedom of choice[/b], and you can progress in the way you want
[list]
[*]Various [b]reward mechanics[/b] are available to make playing and replaying levels serve your interests and strategies
[*]Very interesting upgrade system, where instead of just getting [i]better gear[/i] than the previous, upgrades have unique features which means that sometimes just buying bigger is not better, and gives you an opportunity to choose what you are most comfortable with

[b][u]Grafics:[/u][/b]
A pretty minimalistic game, but with beautifully crafted assets. 
The Execution of the different components is really well done. Thumbs up for the USB-plugs emitting the creeps : D
I had to subtract one point, because i think, this game could use more epilepsy-potential (with the option to turn it off, of course), for example obstacles flashing in the pace of the music, or a little bit of pulsing from the lines on the fields.
I find the DJ standing at the side of the field a pretty nice addition, even though he has ne relevant function (besides the explanations in the tutorial). But he reacts to the explosion of the bombs, thumbs up for this :)

[b][u]Music:[/u][/b]
What else would you expect than repetitive electronic music? Correct, nothing! And these expectations are completely fulfilled. Really Wel executed electronic music, which never got boring or distracting. Under normal circumstances, i have the sudden urge to throw the music play ing device out of my window, if i hear electronic music, but not in this game. The music fits the game lika a glove!
Thumbs up from a metal fan!
Oh, before i forget: Did i mention that i really love the DJ standing at the side of the field? :D

[b][u]Feeling:[/u][/b]
The Feeling of the game is pretty solid. A classical tower-defense-game, but with a twist in form of a bombardement-mode. If you have understood and accepted the controls, the game has a great flow. :)
The missions inside the game are a great addition to it, as well as the ranking mechanic.
The ranking mechanic has no function yet, but maybe we will see one in the future. For Example: new missions based on your rank, or new upgrades.
The game plays best with mouse and keyboard, as there is no threshold for the controlsticks of a controller. Your Screen would move constantly, because the controlstick woudl never be in the exact middle position.


[b][u]UI:[/u][/b]
The UI is minimalistic as well and i felt really comfortable in using it.
Inside the game, it is great to have the hotkeys printed beside the symbols.
And to be honest: is there anything better then triangles as buttons? Pretty, space-saving, minimalistic, functional, awesome :)

[b][u]Total:[/u][/b]
One Sentence: BUY IT!
You have an extremely well executed tower-defense-game on your hand, which doubles as a bombardement-simulator.
Upgrades: Check!
Explosions: Check!
A huge bombardement of orbital missiles: Check!
A cute little DJ with no apparent function: Double-Check!

Possible new Features:
[list]
[*] A few more effects for the field itself (flashing obstacles, etc.)
[*] A game relevant function for the ranks
[*] Add a threshold for the controlsticks, so the screen would not move constantly
[*] MORE DJ'S \o/ (well, no, one is enough)

I found it to be a very stock-standard tower defense game where you are tasked with placing down towers which will protect your stationary base against oncoming attackers.

You aim at targets from an overhead view, fire a shot, and then it makes impact a moment later, hopefully killing some targets. Firing shots in this manner costs the same resource as deploying turrets, but I didn't find that this all that interesting. I just prioritized towers, given that direct-shooting is somewhat inefficient and only ocasionally necesarry. That aside, Artificial Defense is an exceedingly well-polished game. The visuals are clean, crisp, and vibrant, the music is strong, and the menus are all quite sleek. If you're a fan of tower defense games, you could do a lot worse than Artificial Defense.

+ Der Ansporn durch das Upgradesystem.

That's not a huge problem though as you gather points to buy improved tools and weapons  from every mission played, even if you fail.

All in all this seems like a fun take on tower defense games. If anything changes about my feelings about the game as I continue to play I'll update this review.

It's not a big deal on the first look, but if you take into account that this was done by a single guy and take into account that it is a 5$ (maybe a little bit more or less) game, this gets a real insider tip!!

Controls:
There are a lot of things at this game which are ""different"", so are the controls. E.g.: You do not move the crosshair, but the map laying underneath. (If you want, you can invert this bevaviour though). When I played it the first time I honestly thought ""WTF!?"", but after some minutes I realized that this kind of input scheme is perfect for this game. Do not give up too early.

Graphics:
Awesome. I don't think that I need to discuss that much. The screenshots are 1:1.

Gameplay:
As I mentioned before: There are a lot of things at this game which are ""different"" ;-) ... The gameplay is unique and it's really a mixture of a shooter game, tower defense and real time strategy. Mixing up genres normally does not lead to something good, but I think this game is an exception.

Difficulty:
It's again... ""different"" - this time in terms of very, very hard. But these kind of games are rare these day, so I love it. Yes, you can decrease the difficulty, and honestly I did for some missions.

Buy or not buy?!
If you like strange, different, hard and very smart games: Buy!
If not, you should maybe wait on a sale to give it a try, or stick to your favorite games of course.

+ Conceptually this game is incredibly creative and unique as you essentially battle against cyber attacks such as malware and viruses on a virtual computer system.
+ The level design itself is very interesting, you play on top of a motherboard and can see various computer parts running such as the hard drive, OS, CPU, and so fourth and the enemies tend to come out of USB ports
+ Fun addictive gameplay, you mainly shoot a variety of guns and bombs from the sky to destroy enemies but these cost \""RAM\"" (or ammo), so you build production facilitties, and also use your OS to capture various points and honeypots. You can then continu to rain hell from the sky while also building automated turrets to intercept enemies that get by. 
+ You can upgrade your weapons, turrets, and so fourth with currency you get from completing challenging and levels
+ Great Electronic Soundtrack
+ Personally, I feel this game is really refreshing to a rather stale TD Genre

- I found it a bit strange that each level continue to plays even after you complete your objectives and will continue until your OS dies or you manually \""Shutdown\"". While not really a problem I sort of felt like I was quitting out or aborting rather than finishing the level (which seems to go on endlessly until you shutdown).

Lastly, the gameplay. More and more features are being added in order to help players find their comfortable control modes. This didn't change the game's difficulty, though. Git gud.

Looking forward for more stuff.",1464792006,1472834264,True,7,1,0.571023523807525635,0,False,True,False,False,,,

No problems/bugs encountered so far.
The game itself has a unique concept where you have to fend off invaders by using a combination of different weapons, each with its own advantages and flaws. Stronger weapons have, in general a longer cooldown, etc
There is often a delay between firing and the projectiles actually hitting their targets, so smart aiming and predicting your targets\' movements is essential.
It is based on the tower defense gameplay but unlike most tower defense games you dont just place them and wait what happens. You have to actively destroy your enemies.",1464784396,1464784396,True,5,1,0.581386566162109375,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Summary:
The sound and graphics make this game gel, giving it much needed activity and ambiance where it would otherwise be a more bland and abstract tower defense hybrid.

The variety of challenges and levels do provide a nice bit of progression, but while they look, feel and behave just great, I do have concerns in the pacing with some of the games. Especially the ""survive X time"" and ""get X Ram"" challenges can end up being a game of see and wait. Higher difficulty does alleviate a bit of this, but there are some issues with that...

..as the higher difficulties are flat out ""upgrade"" locked, and impossible if you don't unlock the higher end upgrades, so there is no reason to revisit an older challenge once you complete it at gold, because it'll only become easier due to higher upgrades.

The upgrade system is the games weakest part, being a flat and linear upgrade system. No reason to mix and match and no thinking needed. Just get the next one asap to make challenges easier / possible to complete. I feel this is also the part where the game lets me down the most. I have no reason to ""switch it up"" based on a challenge, i know that if i fail, i just wait to upgrade and that does remove some of the tension of otherwise pretty compelling game play.

And while the game is limited in it's scope, the game play and map design does make up for it a fair bit. With towers being restricted, resources limited and a need to switch between Shooting manually using towers, getting resources and balancing these aspects, the game throws in a few curve balls with map design and unit variety (in mechanic, if not look and feel). Forcing you to be active across the map and keep track of several things at the same time makes this game shine at it's best.

It feels great to switch between dropping a tower, jumping to a missile to blow up a clump of enemies, using a CPU module to start my resource chain, switching to my machine gun to take out a roaming ram unit switching to different part of the map to make sure i'm not getting overwhelmed on that side... it's pretty good fun and most challenges take 5-10 minutes to complete - win or lose.


Overall a nice and fun casual experience for short bursts, not something i would play hours on end, but not a bad game to enjoy in short bursts.",1464782203,1464784641,True,10,2,0.451319962739944458,0,False,True,False,False,,,
