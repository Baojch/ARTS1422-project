ドット絵がかわいらしいレトロRPG風のノベルゲームです。
魔王との決戦開始と同時に「思い出」が消えてしまった主人公が、戦いの中で思い出していくというストーリー。
結論から言うと定価ほどの価値は無いが、セールなら買ってもいい70点くらいの作品といった感じ。

☆RPG部分☆
レトロゲーリスペクトゆえか非常にお粗末。戦闘はツクールデフォ戦のがまだ面白いレベル。
エンカ率も非常に高く、5歩ほどで出ることもザラ。バランスも雑（全体回復しながら殴ってれば相手は死ぬ）。
チャプターごとにアイテム固定で始まるので宝箱を探索する意味も無い。
と、まさに真面目にやる価値は無いと言えます。
・・・しかしこれを全て解決するように完璧な対策が施されています。
それは[b]エンカウント無効魔法[/b]がMP2で使えるということです。思い出補正Lvシステムというのも最後まで稼ぎを必要とされるレベルではありません。
結構長いマップをお散歩するゲームになりますが、まあつまらない戦闘何度もやらされる苦行よかマシです。

☆シナリオ☆
このゲームのメイン部分。ストーリー全体としては悪くない。やりたいことは伝わった。
しかし中盤まであまりに退屈なのと、伏線や演出が甘いので終盤の展開にいまいちのめり込めない（感情移入しづらい）という作り込みの甘さが感じられます。
もっとうまく料理出来たかもしれないのに。惜しい。

☆グラフィック☆
ドットキャラが非常に小さいサイズながら感情表現が素晴らしい。匠の技です。

☆ミニゲーム☆
面白くないハイスコア達成まで長いミッションに組み込まれてるという三重苦。クソでもいいんだけどミッションとかアチーブメントに組み込まないで欲しい。
このゲームの本当に嫌いな部分です。

☆総評☆
RPG部分に期待して買うことは絶対にNGですが、中世ファンタジーなノベルゲームを求めてるならセールならオススメできる小粒な佳作ゲーと言ったところです。",1696587552,1696588272,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The title concept of the protagonist Flash struggling to recover his memories of who he is, who his friends are, what his quest is and most importantly, how to use his ultimate attack... it's an interesting concept, even if it's just a vehicle for playing through a set of standard JRPG overworld sections/dungeons chopped up into 15 to 20 minute sessions regarding Flash's (roughly) chronological story of becoming a hero.

The story is a fairly generic 'save the world from darkness' JRPG plot, but the characters are sympathetic enough for me to want to root for them to succeed when you already know that they're probably going to succeed either way because they're JRPG heroes. There are some funny, lighthearted moments related to the dialouge depending on some of the prompts you can prompt Flash to choose in the RPG sections, but there are some shocking (non-canonical?) moments where really bad things can happen depending on what choices you have Flash pick during the fight with the Overlord.

Gameplay is split between Flash, Yuzu, Regent and Clover doing their best in present time to deal with the Overlord's overwhelming firepower and generic evil monologues, and then Flash cutting to a flashback to reveal a retroactive plot detail that is immediately used to save a party member's bacon.

This continues for a bit while playing through flashbacks that flesh out the strong childhood bonds between the four party members (Flash the standard noble young man JRPG protagonist, Yuzu the martial arts tomboy, Regent the reluctant mage son who wants to be a rock star, and Clover the shy and gentle healer/priest/cleric), plus three of their friends (Chloe the researcher, Yanagi the merchant, and Kogure the cowardly ninja).

The thing is, there's this big twist partway through where there is a sudden dramatic reveal of who Flash has really been fighting since the battle began, and the connection they both have to a new character who suddenly shows up in preparation of making a heroic sacrifice. As twists go, it's difficult to say it was a good twist or a bad twist, but it was interesting and it fits with the main theme of the game, something that SYUPRO-DX does a lot in their Japanese-exclusive mobile games: ""You only get sad when you have memories.""

The game has three major endings, one is a short blurb, the second is bittersweet, and the third is a golden ending where Flash saves all of his friends, and they all celebrate and go home together to live happily ever after (the third ending is easier to get than the second ending). There are lots of optional achievements you can get, and they can be a bit tedious depending on how dedicated you are to getting achievements involving pixel square hunts.",1693750625,1693750667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The Longest Five Minutes is a unique rpg. There are two parts to it: the final battle, which is how the game starts (figure that one out), and the flashbacks that tell the story of getting there. But this game isn't your standard RPG. it is more like a Rogue-like RPG in a way. Each new flashback resets your money and gear. 

In addition the game is pretty easy....as you always feel overpoweredy. So even being Rogue-like (sorta), you can still just steamroll through the opposition. So if you demand a challenge..start hunting elsewhere.

But even as easy and weird as it is...it is still pretty fun. The style is top quality. It reminds me of good old rpgs like Dragon Warrior in its style..but still with an anime/cartoon style turned up that adds to its flavor.

So if you can handle losing gear you buy, and ok with no challenge....add it to your wishlist. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but if it gets to like $2....it is worth it to slam through the game....just to see how the two style work together.",1685433213,1685433213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I really enjoy the theme of the game, Hero at the end of a journey suddenly has amnesia and you explore all the events that let you there.  

It gave me To the Moon vibes, which I really enjoyed. And let's be honest. A good story can often beat out poor game mechanics.  

So this game is more accurately a mix of visual novel with very light and useless rpg elements.  

The actual ""fight"" with the darklord is told In a visual novel fashion.  And honestly, if the whole game was just that. I think it would have worked for the better.  Because the rpg sections are just kind of pointless.  

100% they are made to hit on 8bit nostalgia and initially that does work for me.  They eliminate grind by making your level appropriate for that story section, but also any ""reexperience"" earned gives you bonus stats on top of your ""true"" level for that segment.  Which on paper, is a neat mechanic, but also doesn't matter. 

None of the rpg segments are difficult.  The enemies are usually easily killed.  The only way you will die is just from the sheer amount of random encounters.  That is a mechanic from old school rpgs, that they could have done without.  In later segments you are given the ""repel"" spell which eliminates encounters. You should use it all the time because between the encounter rate and the size of dungeons, there is so much bloat.  So ultimately you have these short story segments which are fun, but then this long slog of filler battles to have an easy boss fight.  

Without all the random encounters, the game is only a few hours long of story.  Some will complain about the ending, but I think it's the least of the games problems.  

Also one final note, I had an issue at 3:59 where the game kept freezing.  I opted to put the text advance to auto and that either fixed it, or I did it enough times that I finally got through without it crashing.

という冒頭で始まるのが今作だが、皆さんだったらどんなゲーム体験を期待するだろうか。
こういう「記憶喪失モノ」は自分の場合
・想起する記憶がばらばらであるがゆえに、それが時系列順で並んだ時に回収される伏線
・想起した記憶内容に実は巧妙な偽りがあり、明らかにされた時の驚き
のような2点を期待することが多い。記憶喪失をネタにしたミステリ風味とでもいえばいいのか。
が、結論から言うと２つとも特になかった。残念。

シナリオに言及する前にシステムについて触れておこう。
現実世界のノベルパート（AVGパート）と記憶を追体験するRPGパートを交互にして物語は進んでいく。そしてRPGパートは思い出す記憶ごとにブロック化されていて、ノベルパートに戻った後も「やり残したことがあったなあ」と思えば該当の記憶をオプションから選択すればいつでもやり直すことができるようになっている。このようにRPGパートがぶつ切りなため、各パートのキャラの装備、レベル、所持金は固定となっている。第１の記憶でどれだけレベルを上げて金をためても、AVGにもどり次の記憶にいくと設定されたパラメータに戻ってしまう。逆に言えば所持金をどれだけ使おうが次には戻っている。
なので実際のところはRPG+AVGというよりは、AVGをメインにしつつRPG形式の表現を使ったパートがあるという感じ。もちろんこれ自体は全然良いと思う。RPGの表現を使った物語作品で傑作的なものなど世にいくらでもあるし、自分も大好きだ。例えば、文章で「伝説の必殺技」とか書かれるより、ドデカいMP消費に桁の違うダメージを出してくれる方が受け手側に伝わるものがある。だけどこのゲーム、RPGパートも見せかけじゃなくてちゃんと作らないと思ったのか、ダンジョンが結構長め。だけどそこで躓かれると困るからか戦闘はかなり容易化してある。それでいて上記のように持ち越し要素がないので虚無感がすごい。これなら記憶である利点を生かして道中をキャラの掛け合いとかで省略して設定的には長いダンジョンでしたよ、とかすればテンポよかったのでは。
最後にAVGパートの選択肢は、想起させる体験が異なったりするが、大筋に影響はないので好きに選んで大丈夫。

さてシステムを踏まえてシナリオを見ると、うーんやっぱり「記憶を思い出す」という良さが薄いような気がする。結局これの使われ方は
ピンチになる→「思い…出した！」→敵「何ィ！？」
なんだけど、ワンパターンすぎて飽きてくる。
そして隙間なく時系列順で思い出すので「新しめの記憶で言ってた○○ってこれのことかあ」みたいな主人公たちの道程への考察みたいな楽しみ方もできない。結局、現在主人公と過去主人公とプレイヤーの持っている情報が一致しているから過去パートの楽しみ方がその辺のRPGと同じでしかない。
なので一番読み進める推進力を生みだしてくれているのが「なんで主人公は記憶喪失になったのか」なのだが…　うーん。徐々に明らかになっていくというよりは割とパッと明かされてしまう展開だったので、自分は正直肩透かしだった。物書きでもないくせに上から目線過ぎて恐縮だが、もう少し序中盤から「誰によって引き起こされたのか」を匂わせてくれたらなー、と。

総括すると、ものすごく王道なRPG的なものを作りたいんだけど、そのままじゃ埋もれるから形を変えて興味をひきやすくしてみた、という感じ。
自分はミステリ的なものを期待してしまっていたためマッチしなかったが、熱血とコメディしてる少年漫画的なものが好きなら刺さる人も多いのかも。",1667396728,1667396728,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

・チャプターごとに独立していて、レベルや道具や所持金は他チャプターに持ち越せない。せっかく強い装備を揃えても、次のチャプターに入るとデフォルト装備に戻ってしまう。合掌。

・戦闘自体はフルオート放置でなんとかなる。しかしAIが微妙にポンコツで、かゆいところに手が届かない。

[u][b]Der Anfang am Ende - Der VN Teil[/b][/u]
Die Handlung von The Longest Five Minutes beginnt da, wo andere 
Spiele meistens bald aufhören: Beim Endkampf. 

Während des Endkampfes gegen den Dämonenkönig hat man diverse 
[b]Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten[/b], die den Kampf gegen den Oberschurken mal mehr mal weniger beeinflussen.
Der Dämonenkönig hat einen Mitstreiter niedergeknüppelt und holt zum Schlag aus. Wirft man sein Schwert, schleudert man einen Zauber oder stürmt man voran? Sowas in der Art. Je nach Entscheidung können andere Erinnerungen aufkommen, in die man dann eintaucht.
Erwähnenswert ist, dass man erlebte Erinnerungen noch ein Mal betreten kann. Man spielt das Spiel allerdings von dem Punkt an noch ein Mal. Wer nur auf Achivements aus ist, sollte genügend Speicherstände anlegen.

[b][u]Ein Meer aus Erinnerungen - Der RPG Teil[/u][/b]
Zwischen den einzelnen VN Segmenten taucht man in mal kleinere mal größere spielbare RPG Episoden ein, die mal nur aus Dialog bestehen, meist aber auch Gameplay haben.
Das Gameplay ist dem älterer JRPG Titel wie Dragon Quest nicht unähnlich. Man bewegt die Gruppe durch Städte, Dungeons und die Oberwelt und verkloppt Dämonen, die via Randomencounter aufploppen in einem recht simplen Rundenkampfsystem. 

[i]Ein Wermutstropfen ist, dass Erkundung abseits der Handlung sich kaum bis gar nicht lohnt, da gefundene Ausrüstung und erhaltenes Geld nicht episodenübergreifend zur Verfügung stehen, da die Gruppe jede Episode mit festgelegtem Equipment und Ersparten beginnt.

Das bedeutet zwar gleichzeitig, dass man nicht geizen muss mit den Ressourcen, aber zugleich kann man sich über eine neue Waffe, die man in einer Truhe in einem Dungeon gefunden hat, auch nicht wirklich freuen, da man das gute Stück in der nächsten Eppisode entweder eh nicht mehr hat oder sie auch so hätte. Schade eigentlich. [/i]

Je nach Episode ist die Gruppe stärker oder schwächer, allerdings kann gewonnene Erfahrung das Ganze Spiel über von Nutzen sein, auch wenn man in frühere Erinnerungen zurückkehrt, um beispielsweise Erfolge nachzuholen.

[u][b]Die Last der Entscheidung[/b][/u]
Man wird im Spiel oft vor die Wahl gestellt, was man denn tun will.
Oft hat diese Entscheidung keinerlei Gewicht, manchmal nur wenig, hin und wieder aber auch mal mehr. In letzten Fall kann auch mal die Gruppenkonstellation davon abhängen. Nimmt man jetzt den Ninja oder die Kampfkünstlerin mit? Beide haben unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten und aus der Wahl ergeben sich wieder jeweils andere Möglichkeiten.

[h1]Schwierigkeitsgrad[/h1]
Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist zu Beginn sehr einfach, zieht ab etwa der Hälfte etwas an und ist gegen Ende fast schon anspruchsvoll, aber nie wirklich schwer.

[h1]Soundtrack, Grafik, Steuerung[/h1]
Der Soundtrack besteht aus vielen verschiedenen Stücken, die großteils nur ein Mal im Spiel verwendung finden und sich stets gut ins Spiel einfügen.

Die Grafik ist recht gut gemachte Pixelgrafik im Stil alter JRPGs.

Für die Steuerung kann man Maus und Tastatur verwenden, es bietet sich aber ein Coltroler an. 
Beim Spielen sollte man darauf achten, dass der Mauszeiger irgendwo in der Ecke ist, da er sonst die Auswahlmöglichkeiten im KS beeinträchtigt.

[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]
[b]Pro:[/b]
[list]
[*] Mal mehr mal weniger gewichtige Entscheidungen
[*] Diverse Twists, die sich aus getroffenen Entscheidungen ergeben können
[/list]
[b]Kontra:[/b]
[list]
[*] Erkundung wird kaum belohnt
[/list]
[b]Fazit:[/b]
The Longest Five Minutes ist ein eher unkonventionelles RPG, das viel von einer Visual Novel hat. Erkundungen abseits des Weges lohnen meist nicht, allerdings ist der Weg nicht immer gerade und teilt sich öfter mal. Im Fokus liegt hier eindeutig die Geschichte und nicht der spielerische Anspruch in Form schwerer Bosse oder Dungeons

The Longest Five Minutes is a RPG (Visual Novel?) that does the anti-grind concept in the game but still give you the grinding tools, causing the players to end up in a dilemma. The concept is probably to teach the players (especially MMO players?) how much time we have wasted on useless grinding and how hollow it feels when the game goes reset and all those hard work gone poof.
This game is definitely designed on ""I dare you to go side track and grind!"" type of weird mentality.
So, yeah! Don't grind, it's a trap! You can play through the whole game using auto battle and easily finish the game without grinding at all! Stick to the story line!

The game play goes in between 2 modes, the RPG mode and the VN (Visual Novel) mode. While we get to control the characters and move around, with rpg turn based battle encounters and all that in the RPG mode, and fully text and visual based play during the VN mode.

Basically this is a story teller that uses the rpg mechanism as a story telling tool, but added that reset/adjustment part so your level gets adjusted along with the story progress, grinding higher than the next chapter will reset and lower your level to the ""correct level"" for next chapter, those who didn't grind auto gets the level up.
So, based on that weird reset/adjust behavior. This is basically just a Visual Novel like those rpg styled visual novel back in NEC-PC88 era (Proto-RPG era before the JRPG genre is stabilized). Something we don't see a lot nowadays since the ""visual Novel"" has taken the format of the gal-games style with just character bust and dialog text, and that has become the staple design for the Visual Novel genre after that. But that doesn't means devs can't go old school and use the proto-rpg design again. And for The Longest Five Minutes, this just happened to be the case, and that unnecessary exp grind they didn't take away from the game is probably there to mock on the rpg grind lover imo. We don't have to do that at all and auto battle can get us through the whole game's battle part. Even the items we collected in the game that is none story related will be taken away and reset/adjust on the next chapter. Yeah, the game is a trap for exp grinder and perfectionist with hoarding disorder.
Like a proper visual novel, we get [b]tons[/b] of choices in the story part of the game (no joke, there are tons of choices and quite a lot of routes in the game, so much that you need a few replay to see them all). But all the choices in the RPG part of the game are already made for us, we can't change any of that, nor can we change the order we do stuffs in the game. So don't waste time exploring the world map either, even those towns seems reachable you will always be blocked by a sleeping soldier when you tried to reach them and had to walk all the way back to where you started empty handed (and disappointed). So just stick the story and made your choices during the story, and do minimum explore and head straight to the next town the story told you to, and you will probably enjoy this game more. The game WILL try its best to waste our time when we are not doing what the game want. Level up, winning a fight you are not supposed to win, hoarding items.. all these will become a waste of effort.
So my advice for those who plan to play this game is just sit back and enjoy the long long story by ignoring the basic level grind of normal jrpg nowadays, and maybe a few replay from load or fresh to get all the story routes done, it's worth it for story lover and without the grind it's actually pretty enjoyable.

For the story, the story itself is pretty much the classic rpg adventure of departing from a village up to killing the overlord. But the ""order"" of the story being shuffled and the ""plot"" they used to tell the story is unique and fun. Using the ""flashback"" story telling patern that lets the players do time skip/travel back to the past to learn what happened (with a special twist near the end that might put your mouth in an O shape). It came with hilarious choices given to the players to make which we normally wouldn't get in a normal ""right and justice rpg's story"". Yet this is still the basic adventure story we normally get in a ""Shounen Manga"". If you are these type of story lover, you will probably agree that this game's story is good enough to be made into an Anime series though you probably have seen similar stories somewhere...
And from this game we can really see how contents creators nowadays are squeezing their brain juice to keep what's been done a gazillion times looks fresh and unique again. Not only in this game, we can see this trend in Anime around this time line as well, trying to use a different perspective to tell what happened to be a ""been there done that"" story. The trend is probably caused by the ""golden marketing age"" for these contents are always ""getting older"" with older gamers/otakus growing old in age. (kids don't have buying power + their population is unexpectedly ""far"" lower than the mid-age group in developed country, so that makes them a smaller market in Japan and the creators continue to pleased the existing audience which are all growing older and older). And also the reason why MMO jumped and focus on the developing countries and seeing them as a huge potential market, where there are more (illiterate) youngsters for their gaming demands, but uhh, that's a different story to tell and not related to this game i guess...

Because of the long story and quite a lot of places to visit in this game, there are more than 400+ BGMs in the game, which makes the OST collection a pretty large one too! If you buy the DLC soundtrack, they even throw in another CD filled with OST from other games Shupro-DX has made. Quite worth the price for those who loved digital music from old school rpg imo.

So about, recommendation...

If you are a visual novel lover, or even a walking simulator lover, you will love this game, it's more balanced on story telling than action (unless you try to break free and go your way, which the game allows it, but will take away your effort by resetting everything you did as the story progress). *don't let the devil voice gets the better of you! you don't have to do it!*

If you are a story based/story rich point and click adventure games lover that doesn't like grind, this is definitely the game for you. This game's story is on par with triple A class games/anime. Although not voiced, it's backed with over 400+ BGMs... so yeah... you can be sure to have a good experience with the story part. *make sure to get some tissue papers ready!*

If you are one of those players that only want one game to be played for their whole/entire life (aka endless grinding), this isn't the game for you, it will try to teach you that your way is wrong. And i guess that isn't what you want to hear, and will definitely ended up giving this a thumbs down. So, if you read this, don't waste your time on this game and go find yourself a grindy Chinese/Korean made MMO game and grind all your time (life) away as you see fit. You will probably find more friends there too! Only a masochist understands another masochist. *big grin*

If you are someone with hoarding disorder (often the perfectionist). This game is gonna do what you don't like most, it takes away the items in your hoard on the start of every chapter. So i can't really recommend this game to dragons or my furry rodent friends, seeing their life's goal is to fill up their hoard... *gimme back my item hoards!! T^T*

それぞれのイベントは短く各キャラ達の登場回数もあまりないものの個性的な言動と解像度が低くて見づらいがコミカルにアニメーションするドット絵のおかげでよくキャラが立っていて強く印象に残る。
記憶をだんだん思い返していくというギミックもしっかり使われていて終盤に次々に謎が解けていく展開もいい。

ただRPG部分がとてもつまらない。
シーンごとのぶつ切りRPGというとサガフロンティア２が有名だがあれとは違いシーンごとにレベルや装備などが固定のため成長の喜びもアイテム取得の喜びも買い物の楽しみも全くない。
主人公は慎重に冒険を進める性格だったらしく戦闘はほぼオートで勝てるくらいの強さを常に保っている。オートで勝てなかったのは3体のボス位だ。戦闘で工夫して勝利する喜びも殆どない。一応戦闘やイベントクリアで得た経験値で思い出補正レベルというものが上がって規定値より強くなれるが強くなる必要自体ない。イベントクリアで得られる経験値だけで十分だったため雑魚戦をすることに何のメリットも見出せなかった。
またモブキャラたちの会話は細かく設定されているものの基本的に聞かなくてもいい内容なので街についてもスルーしがちだった。
これらの理由からRPG部分はノーエンカウントの魔法を常に使ってひたすらダッシュしながらゴールを目指すだけだった。
これならオートで進んでくれても良かったように思う。

他の不満点としてはマルチエンディングであるにも関わらずクリア後のセーブがないため、最後にセーブしたところからの既読フラグが立たないことが挙げられる。細かいセーブをしていないとかなりの量のやり直しを強いられるつくりになっていた。
あと実績をコンプリートする上でクリアが必要になる[spoiler] シューティング・スロット・ランアクション [/spoiler]のミニゲームの難度が結構高い。動体視力が死んでいる私にはかなりきつかった。

I'm shocked about how little coverage this game has gotten, as I was left with a lingering taste for more content about the game, but there's just a couple reviews and not even a wiki.

In defense of The Longest Five Minutes, I wanna say that i get where the negative reviews come from, as i have felt the same, but the cons didn't spoil the experience for me, as I was so invested in the pros, so let me start with them:

Pros:
-------------------
- Great story, as good as you could expect a short JRPG to have.
The characters are all unique and have great development, even those you'd think would get none because they weren't part of the main roster. The story seems straightforward, but it has just enough twists to keep you playing for more.
I got invested in the character's fates before I knew it, and just had to see their story to the end.

- Great graphics, in the style they are presented. Being used to retro JRPGs, the graphics all seem so fresh, and you can feel that each sprite and each animation are way livelier than you'd expect this old style to be. 
In a way, the character sprites remind me of Tales of Phantasia, that express many emotions as a core storytelling device.
The fresher graphics (spell effects and such) also seem to fit the context perfectly, and never felt out of place. The close-up pixel sprites are also pretty cool

- Ok dungeons: Each dungeon has a unique gimmick to them that explore some JRPG tropes mechanics, from sliding ice floor to pokémon's rock pushing puzzles. In that respect, each dungeon offers just a little bit more than just your regular walk'n grind

Cons:
--------------------
- Bad combat. Probably the one thing all negative reviews (and mine) agree upon: The combat system is shallow and, eventually, becomes a chore you'll just want to skip with permanent repel.
At first, you can just win all battles by just spamming attack but, by the time I caught up with that, i had grinded enough and just avoided all uninsteresting random encouters, fighting only the bosses.
The battle system follows an earthbound-like style and flow, and has lots of spells and effects but, as each flashback is short and spells are learned so fast, the the player will only learn what all of them do if they experiment by themselves (All stats up is very OP, BTW)

- Unusual leveling system. Another of the games' huge flaws, this only has to do with players expectations. We go into the game expecting a normal JRPG progression because its advertised as a JRPG game, but its very far from true. All your progress (loot and gold) are contained in each flashback and don't carry over to the next, so we go expecting our grinds to be relevant, but they have almost zero impact. The only progress the player gets to keep is experience, that gives the player some bonus stats throughout the game.
The game's difficulty is set as such the player can complete the game with ZERO grinding and, as such, feels very easy to players that are expecting a normal JRPG experience.
When I realized that I could just cruise through the game, I could focus on the story and stop exploring every nook and cranny of every dungeon

Mixed:
-----------------
- The game offers very little challenge compared to a normal JRPG, and is more suited for a casual playthrough rather than a grindfest. Breezing through the game seemed disappointing at first, but then it got relaxing as I lowered my expectations and accepted that I didn't have to grind (love/hate relationship, i guess)

- The game makes you care about the choices you make but, in the end, they don't REALLY matter, as all paths end up converging to the same finale. There still are multiple endings, but you don't have to fret up about choices you regret making, unless you really want to see all possibilities and dialogues the game has to offer.

- The finale plot twist at first seemed condescending to the player, as it comes out of nowhere but, as the story is driven by remembering lost memories, swallowing the twist isn't as bad when you accept its role as a plot device that was there all along.

The game's price is a little bit daunting, but it is justified, as the game's OST and art are very well made, and must have had many talented artists working on it.
Overall, I got it on sale and it was worth every penny. but I would advise anyone to think twice if it really floats your boat before buying it at full price. I hope this review is helpful in that sense.

In this particular case, I had a greatly wrong impression of The Longest Five Minutes, however, that’s actually something I found charming about this game as it only meant that I was very surprised about how this JRPG turned out and lucky for me, it worked out just fine since I even preferred the way the developers handled this game. I have to admit, I expected The Longest Five Minutes to be another typical JRPG that is fun to go through but otherwise doesn’t have any sustainability and, in the end, I am extremely grateful that this JRPG isn’t only fun to go through but even has an interesting approach of telling its story.

The Longest Five Minutes opens with the protagonist Flash being in the middle of a final boss fight but unfortunately, he can’t recall any of his prior memories at all. This incident, however, is very problematic during fighting the demon lord as he cannot remember his adventure, the reason to defeat the boss and most important: his friends he is fighting with. Feeling guilty about his loss of memories, he tries his best to recall his lost memories during the battle. The issue here is that he has to do all of that within five minutes or else they won’t be able to beat the demon lord.

That’s right, in The Longest Five Minutes the player starts the story with the final battle. I found the concept of Flash having amnesia quite interesting as we both had no clue what was happening in this game so the protagonist is starting at square one as well. That made it easy to sympathize with him and I could absolutely understand the pressure of having to remember everything within a couple of minutes which seemed impossible at first. As Flash slowly remembers his adventure, the player was able to understand the happenings and how he ended up becoming a hero to fight the demon lord among his friends. Of course, the player will take much longer than five minutes to go through the whole story although only five minutes passed in-game as he recollects his memories.

And here comes the unique thing about The Longest Five Minutes, the story-telling. Whilst battles are available here throughout the game, I was very surprised when I started this JRPG as it’s very text-heavy and feels more like a visual novel hidden in a JRPG. I could immediately tell, the story is the main part of this game whilst the gameplay is only a nice bonus to make the game more interesting. During the game, the player constantly switches between the final boss battle with memory fragments in between when Flash manages to recollect a memory. Something I liked as well is that the story isn’t always told chronologically but the most revealing ones are getting put aside for the end of the story. That being said, his way is full of hardships he had to overcome, but luckily, he isn’t alone but can rely on his loyal friends.

Slowly, I got more and more information about what happened in the past and I’m not going to lie, The Longest Five Minutes seemed like a very standard JRPG when it comes to the story. The similarities are there, after all, a hero that has to fight off an evil boss and he has no other choice because otherwise the world will end and along with that, humanity. Additional to that, he has a couple of friends that are utterly loyal to him and are willing to accompany him everywhere, even if it means risking their lives. Something I, however, didn’t expect is the story reveals that followed later in the game. I won’t go into detail with these reveals since I don’t want to spoil anything, but The Longest Five Minutes is very different from the typical JRPGs I’ve played before and there are twists and turns that I did not see coming at all.

As aforementioned, The Longest Five Minutes contains gameplay as well that reminds me of older turn-based JRPGs I’ve used to play. The battles are rather on the easy side overall and the player doesn’t have to grind at all to beat this game. However, I considered this aspect as a good one as I don’t like it when I have to spend hours grinding only to get a small portion of the story as a reward. This JRPG focuses on its storyline and thus, there is constant story progress and the only parts where the player has to endure a while without any new reveals is when they have to beat a dungeon to advance with the story. Especially later in the game, the dungeons become lengthier and are filled with puzzles the player has to solve. There are treasure chests with items spread through the dungeons and monsters randomly appear when the player is walking around, except when visiting towns.

Each memory works as a chapter and can be selected in the menu. The special thing here is that these memory events do vary depending on the choices that are made during the final boss battle although the ending seems to depend on the last choices. In the menu, the player can choose to re-experience a certain memory event and this comes in handy when there are goals that didn’t get fulfilled with the first playthrough. You see, besides the main goal to advance the story, there are side quests where the player can help other people they meet to get an achievement. Of course, a chapter selection for the final boss battle part is available as well to make different decisions to unlock other memories. The only thing that I’m missing here is the NG+ since once I beat the game my memory didn’t unlock but I had to replay a save file for experiencing it again.

The Longest Five Minutes was indeed a memorable game for me that luckily turned out to be quite different than I assumed at first. With the story being more in the foreground, the battles are more on the easy side and it’s easy to go through the game without having to unnecessary grind. I especially enjoyed the unique features this game has to offer such as the switch between memory fragments and the final boss battle. The story managed to surprise me as well as it first seemed like a typical JRPG storyline but in the later parts of the game, it’s evident that this couldn’t be more wrong. That being said, The Longest Five Minutes is a game that will very likely appeal to those who enjoy an in-depth story with more relaxing gameplay that only serves the purpose of having a nice balance so the reading sessions do stay fun the whole time.

游戏采用倒叙的方式，最开始玩家化成成一名失忆男，出现在跟队友一起打游戏最终boss的场景中。面对突如其来的情况，男主却完全不记得任何事情，甚至连自己是谁都无法记得。于是在队友拼了命的催促下，男主开始拼了命的回忆之前的故事。于是游戏便回到了男主最初的踏上冒险旅程的开始。

可以说作为一款RPG游戏，游戏在难度上可以说是中规中矩甚至说是不太有什么太高的难度。首先，每一张的地图上的遇怪率十分之高，并且对于人物等级升级和装备成长并没有太大的用处。再说说战斗系统，可以说一般的RPG系统都是有不同职业或者不同属性相克的概念，并且在人物攻击顺序上都需要具有相应的策略性。可惜的是这游戏并没有一般RPG游戏所具有的策略性，完全不需要人物属性相克和攻击先后顺序的条件。游戏中碰到的怪兽难度十分之低，这也导致了游戏RPG因素的可玩性大大下降。

另外，在每段冒险的回忆中结束后，新的回忆中的冒险装备都会进行更新，因此会每次冒险的难度也会从一开始就会降低不少。但因此带来的坏处就是你好不容易在之前的冒险中打完小boss，辛辛苦苦所获得的装备相比于新冒险中送的装备显得一文不值，只能在商店中进行贱卖，游戏中的成就感可以说是大打折扣，让人感觉根本不是在打架升级成长，更像是在看一场视觉小说。

日本一 作为一个做出过传奇RPG游戏的知名日本游戏公司，这样的作品可以说是差强人意，中规中矩的游戏质量搭配不符其身价的游戏价格（美区50刀/澳区60刀）也使得一部分日本一的忠实玩家对这有颇有抱怨之词。

游戏如果在定价上更为合理并且在细节上再打磨一下的话，不失为一款佳作。

[b]+ Point : Trace what relationships and memories left for the hero party.[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
The Longest Five Minutes. It is a 2D role-playing adventure game made by Nippon Ichi Software & SYUPRO-DX. As you know, NIS team has mainly created 2D pixel art games with their own unique sense. So their games have been great gifts for fans who like JRPG. But the initial full price has been a deal breaker for the game. So the publisher listened to the users' voices and feedback, lowering the price of the game. Now it's time to look this hidden gem-like JRPG again.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

In this game, you need to manage the brave team to face the Demon King, but your hero lost  his memory during the final battle phase. You need to restore all the memories within five minutes to defeat the Demon King. Although it looks like a classic role-playing game, it gives the impression that it's a visual novel with RPG elements. These attempts are novel and keep the game's mood fresh.

Lively character sprite animations and humorous conversations make players smile throughout the game. Starting with the last boss battle, Flash Back (Amnesia) is an interesting game concept. This flashback will unfold as small chapters leading up to the last minute. In essence, combat is mostly composed of dialogue. There's a timer around the corner, allowing you to make key decisions about how long the battle is going on, how memories are played, and other influences. Through this process, you will get to know everything about how and why your hero can fight against death.

Gameplay is rather nonlinear. You can play the stories in each chapter selectively, without having to go through them sequentially. Dungeon exploration and combat follows the standard JRPG. In addition, there are optional side quests and mini games. It is quite interesting and will be a pleasant oasis for NIS fans. The game is neat and solid overall.

The Longest Five Minutes. This game seems to fit well with the identity of Nippon Ichi Software. Love, relationships and humor are all in the game. The 2D pixel artwork is neat and the game concept is interesting. As well as, its retro music goes well with the game mood. The RPG side is a bit lighter, but it's worth it as a standalone game.

《The Longest Five Minutes（最漫长的五分钟）》是由Nippon Ichi Software（日本一）和SYUPRO-DX联合制作的一款像素风角色扮演游戏，玩家需要操作勇者小队面对魔王，但是在临战阶段却失去了全部的记忆，需要在五分钟内恢复起全部的记忆击败魔王。虽然看起来好像是一款地地道道的角色扮演游戏，但是我感觉更像是披着角色扮演皮的视觉小说。

[h1]游戏的考据和科普：[/h1]
Nippon Ichi Software（株式会社日本一）也是我们非常熟悉的日本游戏制作社和发行商之一了，曾经制作了《魔界戰記》、《灵武战记》和《光之圣女传说》等比较著名的系列游戏，本社以其独特的可爱系画风备受追捧。

SYUPRO-DX似乎擅长以制作像素风游戏助长，早起制作了一些休闲类小游戏，但是近期开始转向催泪系像素风角色扮演方面如最近比较追捧的《为什么勇者大人会这么弱呢？》，在剧本的把控上非常好。

The Longest Five Minutes（最漫长的五分钟）最早于日本时间2016年7月28日限定登录PSV，再由NIS America, Inc.（日本一北美分部）代理后，在2018年2月14日前后逐步登录全球。

[h1]游戏的体验和分析：[/h1]
游戏一开始就展现了与其他RPG系列不同的创意性，对于RPG游戏来说，角色由弱到强，逐步升级的过程是一个非常重要的过程，这不仅是一个缓慢逐步积累的过程，同时还是一个内容上的沉淀。但是本作不同，一开始直接是最强状态，暂时跳过那些复杂耗时的过程，直接进入与魔王的最终战斗，可是作为勇者主角的Flash却失去了一切冒险的记忆，甚至连招式都记不得了，玩家需要操控他在队友的帮助下恢复失去的记忆，并且是在五分钟之内，确实如标题所说是最“漫长的五分钟”了。

在画面上游戏采取了像素风的风格，更精准的说是采取了8-bit的像素画，因此在角色的画面表现上会显得相当的码赛克，同时更为偷懒的一点是再除了主角四人组以外的像素小人重复率非常高，经常分不清谁是谁。不过对于主角四人组的待遇还是非常好的，虽然是像素小人，但是各种动作和表情都非常丰富，一举一动非常生动形象。[spoiler]（以及那个蓝色奶妈，怎么看怎么像阿库娅）[/spoiler]比较贴心的一方面是，为了应对玩家像素脸盲，在主线任务的剧情上都会标注感叹号，很容易就能找到。

本作在玩法上是按照剧情来的，为了寻找回忆需要玩家再次体验一遍，因此是一个倒叙片段的方式，把一整个大回忆分拆成一小段一小段，玩家每完成一个剧情就会回想起一段然后推动主线剧情，因此每个章节之间并不相关，当然前一个章节所获得的道具提升的等级也不会延续到下一章，所以想靠“五分钟内的神游”来变成最强是不可求的，那么其实对于几个买卖商品的店铺设计的也不是很必要了。鼠标右键可以奔跑这点很好，虽然对于键鼠做出了优化非常好，角色能够自动避障，对战时可以快速选择攻击，但是在人物的对话方面如果点快了会无限重复观看，比较浪费时间。在对战方面，采取了暗雷遇敌方式，遇敌率还是比较高的，不过难度不高并且内容也不会保存到下一章，对于希望快速推主线剧情的玩家，老实说还是比较烦。

音乐在气氛的烘托方面营造的分为比较好，对话内容和剧情也比较诙谐搞笑，游戏不支持中文，可能在某些地方会导致玩家对剧情不是很了解不知道该干什么，在这方面的提示也比较少，可能会造成卡关现象。

[h1]最终总结：[/h1]
总归来说The Longest Five Minutes（最漫长的五分钟）是一部中规中矩的RPG游戏，在玩法上其实还是比较缺乏点睛之笔的，不过相对的在剧情的叙述方式方面比较新颖独特，以相对独立的单独关卡形式恢复记忆的碎片也让玩家基本告别了刷刷刷的RPG需求，一路直推主线就行。本作推荐给喜欢像素风RPG游戏的玩家。

It'd give it a 8/10[/b], considering it current price. Well done JRPG I'll likely come back to later. About length: I finished it in 7.3h according to steam stats. Is there replayability? Yes, more endings (main reason to make another save file), quests you might have missed, etc. Game is light hearted overall but unlike ""Half Minute Hero"" (another great game) the NPCs here take themselves seriously for the most part. So there is some extra immersion pts for that. Im not bashing HMH, I like the humour there too. Moving forward...


[b]PROS:[/b][i]
- Its super CHEAP now!
  (Publisher listened to ppl's demands)
- Love the Main Characters
  (the main 4, more can join)
- Awesome BOSS Battle Theme!
  (my suggestive opinion)
  (lots of OSTs I liked in it!)
- Plot Twists were nice
- Lots of good feels
- You CAN skip MOST battles
  (spell called REPEL, 2MP)[/i]
- Resolution 2550 supported!
- Controller 360/etc. supported!
- Scene SELECT option

[b]NEUTRAL/NEGATIVE:[/b] (depends on you)[i]
- No incentives to grind normal battles: I guess thats a plus and a minus. On the downside: since you dont need to grind for exp, you can just pass everything using the REPEL spell (which costs almost nothing in mana). This makes normal fight more of a chore than anything since you dont really get much for it. Furthermore, grinding GOLD is the same since each ""memories"" you relive, your items are entirely wiped and replaced with a few coins depending on specific chapter. So stocking up on herbs like a maniac (x99 anyone?) wont work here... not that you'd need to but worth pointing out. Equips you get from chests in dungeons? Not that diff stats wise and even if they are, you prob already bought one of these already emptying your pockets at the start of the chapter. But you dont need these in the first place so finding a treasure chest isnt so much a ""YES!!"" as it actually is a ""oh, some new equips that prob wont make much of a diff.""[/i]

I realise I wrote a lot on that last topic, but on top of my head these are the only neutral(s)/downside(s) I could think of. All in all, its a very good game I enjoyed from the bottom of my heart and likely will come back to it a few years later.

本作是由NIS America, Inc.发行的一款JRPG游戏，玩家将扮演一名突然失忆的勇者，在冒险途中一点点找回自己的记忆。游戏画面采用复古的像素风格，画面表现简洁而又有几分搞怪，而游戏剧情采取倒叙的手法让整体游戏体验变得十分别致。游戏在战斗方面的表现中规中矩，上手简单、元素充足但没有什么亮眼表现，喜欢此类游戏的玩家不妨尝试一下。

[h1]👉短评👈[/h1]
游戏在初始便向玩家展现了主角在与最终boss战斗时突然失去记忆的片段，并使用倒叙的手法继续讲述了男主从一名新手逐渐成长为大神的冒险历程，而这一切仅仅发生在最终的五分钟之内...游戏的剧情十分新颖，人物之间的对话也十分有趣，配合不难的战斗内容赋予本作小品级游戏的属性。因为也算是一款以寻回记忆片段为主要的游戏，本作每一个片段都是相互独立的，所以也别想着积攒道具或是装备，没啥用，上一次购买的物品不会继承到下一段记忆之中。

游戏的画面虽说不够精致，但是其使用像素风格给予玩家浓浓的怀旧感，经典的玩法配合一些内置小游戏，整体体验还算不错。但值得一提的是，本作目前没有官中，并且在任务之中的提示略少，因此需要玩家在游戏中稍加注意。在声音表现方面，人物没有配音，bgm数量稀少但质量尚可，总体表现平平。

总的来说，本作整体表现中规中矩，缺少足够的亮眼内容，但起码质量还是不错的，比较适合喜欢复古像素风格rpg游戏的玩家。但由于游戏需要耗费不少时间进行迷宫探索的原因，仍需玩家需要有足够的耐心进行游玩，请喜欢此类游戏的玩家酌情考虑是否购买。

游戏采用了像素画风的游戏场景，游戏开始用黑白的画面讲述了关于记忆的一些叙述，记忆是连系一切美好的痛苦的纽带。游戏开始，我们站在一个看上去就很可怕的怪物面前，这里能看到卡通的背景画风，讲述了这个游戏开始，我们的主人公flash一头雾水的站在大魔王面前，和其他三位同伴，但是他想起来自己的名字和今年17岁（还没过生日），但是他为什么来到这里，要做什么，他都想不起来了。在魔王的攻击之前，三名小伙伴非常焦急，他们说，会帮他想起来的。“你是个英雄！”你是个英雄，每个人都知道的英雄。在激烈的战斗场景中，回忆过去，这个设计很棒，回忆过去的场景便是我们熟悉的RPG场景，跟其他的RPG游戏一样，讲述了旅行中发生的事情，有商店，武器店和旅馆等可以交互的地方。游戏的场景布局简单，对于人物NPC的刻画也是熟悉的可爱风格，regent喜欢音乐，但是他的父母不想让他做那个，他向他的父母保证自己会成为最好的吟游诗人。chloe正处于魔法研究之中，所以不能和我们的英雄一起去旅行，NPC的人设都在只言片语之间，而游戏的操作方式是键盘加鼠标的，你看到那个人头上有问号，那么你用鼠标点击他，他就会跟你对话，但是一直点鼠标他会重复他的话而不会脱离。（跟常用的方式不一样啊，我以为是按E对话呢！）希望能更改一下，或者单纯的鼠标移动和对话，键盘移动和对话等等。而且希望添加一个提示，例如进到谁的家显示一下，比如flash house，可能的话还是需要中文啦！语言不通会让探索变得更艰难。

說到日本一的作品，由於最強王牌魔界戰記的存在，可能給大多數人留下的印象就是終究耐刷和誇張傷害判定數字。但近些年來日本一是一個相當高產的廠商，除了魔界戰紀和流行之神這種相對知名度較廣的ip，旗下還有一大堆題材獨特機制也做出創新的獨立作品，例如結合了民俗和都市怪談，以傳統恐怖遊戲的“追逐和逃跑”為核心的，致鬱精巧的夜廻系列。又或者是魔女旅團這種純粹的迷宮rpg，還有《蘿潔與黃昏古城》、《螢火蟲日記》這種黑暗童話風格動作探險遊戲，可以說在題材，機制，類型等方面百花齊放，是個人心目中少有的能不斷嘗試新題材的優秀二線日廠代表。而本作則是日本一於16年發行一款以“記憶”為核心線索的異類rpg遊戲，“面對最終boss戰突然失憶的主角”這樣獨特的設定確實很容易吸引玩家的注意，而再次基礎之上將傳統的jrpg要素與章節式的獨立劇情相融合，在大大減少玩家“練功”工作量的同時，也較好的提升了“勇者冒險生涯的不同階段”這種體驗上的代入感，總體來說和日本一其他的獨特作品一樣，雖然在體量和表現上算不得什麼大作，但卻能給玩家帶來獨特的，只此一家的有趣體驗。

[h1] 基礎機制介紹 [/h1]
本作的核心是“記憶”，整個遊戲的劇情都圍繞著此展開。故事的開端就是勇者小隊在面對氣勢驚人的最終魔王，正要上演最終決戰的時候，作為核心勇者的主角發現自己失憶了...什麼也想不起來。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888874202
（就連魔王都懵逼了..）
而此時螢幕右上角的時間正在不斷地前進，主角的同伴想盡了辦法，提出了各種報告關鍵字來幫助主角回憶起這一路的探險歷程，而主角也通過不斷的回憶逐漸解鎖與同伴的回憶，戰鬥的經驗，學到的必殺技等等，最終擊敗魔王。而本作標題的所謂的“最長的五分鐘”也就是主角在與魔王交戰中從回憶到最後的時間。
當然，這個五分鐘僅僅指的是面對魔王的時間，遊戲本身自然不可能如此快速完結。遊戲具體的推動模式就是  主角面對魔王努力回憶，同伴或是主角自己想起一個關鍵線索——通過線索回憶起當年的冒險，這部分也就是主角和隊伍以常規rpg形式探索的部分——完成冒險，根據冒險中的回憶選擇面對魔王的事件，然後想到新線索推動下一次回憶。而主角在回憶中會出現多個任務事件，有些跟隨主線就能完成，而有些則需要特定的物品或者選項才能觸發，完成的任務越多，在面對魔王的時候就會解鎖更多的有利選項。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888874830
（與魔王對峙的過程中玩家可以隨時選擇跳回到精確到秒的時間進行重新選擇）
而因為這種獨特的劇情展示模式（玩家進入回憶的時候的狀態是固定的，可能前一章還是lv5的新人冒險者，下一場就已經到達了13級的高級冒險者狀態），所以本作不存在一般rpg的升級要素，每次進入的狀態都是固定的，過程中雖然也可以不斷地在迷宮中刷怪升級賺錢買裝備，但在下一幕回憶中並不會保留。所以對應的，遊戲將戰鬥的難度調的相當低，而主角團的技能也十分貧瘠，複雜的武器系統更是不存在，即便玩家不作出任何調整，單靠一路平砍和偶爾的技能，再加稍微注意下回複角色的sp量，就能比較簡單的一路暢通的打過去，唯一需要注意的挑戰反而是每次章節開啟時的多個任務目標，有些任務必須要玩家仔細探索地圖找到觸發的條件，否則就算在過程中遇到了任務目標也無法開啟事件。算是一個讓人略感蛋疼的部分.
總的來說，本作不算是傳統意義上的rpg，重點還是在於以“回憶”作為主導的劇情展示。日本一拿手的刷子要素在本作幾乎看不到痕跡。相反“探索”和“尋找”反而佔據了大量的比重，在回憶中仔細甄別最終完成全部回憶目標的感覺能帶給人比較新鮮的感覺。


[h1]一些吐槽 [/h1]
1.缺乏語言支持
目前steam上日本一的作品均由日本一北美發售，從名字看就知道是針對歐美用戶..所以基本上都沒有漢語支持，即便某些作品在psv乃至主機上有官方中文，但在pc端依然難以體驗到，而部分民間漢化也僅支持最初發售的幾個版本，遊戲更新後因為相對小眾也很難獲得製作組的支持，而本作又是一部劇情主導的遊戲，所以對國內玩家而言看不懂劇情幾乎就丟失了本作全部的樂趣，畢竟從系統上來說，本作就是一個最原始狀態的jrpg，不了解劇情的情況下幾乎沒什麼能吸引人刷下去的要素..
2.存在部分bug
前段時間鬧得沸沸揚揚的伊蘇8差評事件想必大家還有所記憶。日本一北美雖然確實將不少獨佔遊戲奉獻給了pc玩家，但是移植水準也是真的堪憂，基本上不出點bug不舒服的那種，之前玩的《經典迷宮回歸.這是戰國》就存在的退出時幾率閃退本作也有，而在道具使用頁面游標抽風一樣的瘋狂上下跳動也見過不少次...雖然總體來說處於能忍受的範圍，但對於遊戲體驗的傷害終歸是實打實的..
3.不算精緻的畫面
即便以像素的風格來說，本作的畫面距離精緻也差的很遠，雖然製作組很努力的利用有限的像素點活靈活現的展示了角色的表情和動作，但過大的像素顆粒放置在大大的pc螢幕上確實有那麼一點寒酸..雖然也有遊戲就是要以此為個性的原因在內（畢竟大魔王和主角的特寫的品質就挺高），但考慮到本作原生平臺是掌機的psv，目前的畫面對大部分玩家來說可能是“滿屏遊戲性所以拒絕”的範圍..
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888874801
（不過角色的神態展示是真的不錯，有限的像素點展示的效果讓人滿意，另外在像素小人狀態下的clover真的好像阿庫亞啊...）
4.略顯無聊的戰鬥機制
在遊戲充滿特色的章節式回憶探險之外，作為一款rpg遊戲來說，本作的戰鬥顯得過於白開水和古老了，單調的迷宮，暗雷式的老派遇敵，稀少的技能，在加上完全繼承到下一次回憶的道具和狀態，直接導致原本就比較無聊的戰鬥又少了一層日式特有的累計的快感。而且角色本身也沒有明確的職業成長路線，每一章節給出的招式和狀態都是固定的，雖然的戰鬥的難度比較低，可以輕鬆地通關，但基本上只是開始戰鬥bbbbbb一路普通攻擊按過去偶爾放個技能實在是稱不上有趣..


[h1] 總結 [/h1]
新穎的劇情演繹方式無疑是本作最大的亮點，但在這之外本作並沒有太多讓人眼前一亮的要素。暗雷式的遇敵和貧瘠的角色技能讓的戰鬥冗長無味，而配合劇情展示導致的培養要素的缺乏也讓本作失去了裝備這個常規的rpg刷子要素。碎片式劇情之間等級和裝備不互通也減少了玩家當倉鼠黨累計的快感，也不可避免的讓遊戲的難度顯得沒什麼挑戰性。總的來說本作可能更加適合對於傳統jrpg冗長的練功過程感到乏味，又不是很能接受美式寫實畫風的玩家換換口味，但如果真要當做一部正兒八經的rpg來玩的話可能在要素上不是很足夠。另外因為日本一北美髮型的遊戲全都都支持日英雙語，而且版本更新讓漢化補丁也基本全部失效，而本作又是一個劇情驅動的遊戲，所以如果語言對你來說是個障礙的話，那麼個人並不建議購買。

《The Longest Five Minutes（世界最长的五分钟）》是由Nippon Ichi Software, Inc和 SYUPRO-DX开发，NIS America, Inc发行的一款日系角色RPG类型游戏，游戏讲述了男主人公在于最终大魔王战斗的过程中，突然将一切都忘记的事，在于大魔王的对峙中，男主突然将自己的身份、必杀技、过去的经历以及打败大魔王的目的全部忘记，而这时游戏也真正开始了。

由于男主人公的失忆，《世界最长5分钟》的游戏内容便是帮助男主人公寻找那些记忆。而在寻找记忆时，游戏就变成了正常的RPG类游戏。通过这些一段段的回忆，当男主想起所有事情后再一次正式挑战魔王时，玩家在寻找回忆期间中的一些抉择便会影响到最后男主人公的状态。

游戏自称是和大魔王五分钟的战斗，但是实际上当然不可能只有五分钟了，在与大魔王战斗的过程中，游戏会插进来各种倒叙的情节，你可以与你的朋友们对话，由此就能慢慢找回你冒险的记忆，游戏走像素路线，却配以日系动漫色调，同时又使得游戏变的另类可爱，另外游戏剧情有点意思，游戏开始就进入BOSS战，作为我们玩家都是一脸懵逼的。。

（世界最长的五分钟）这款游戏制作的非常精良，游戏音乐，怪物类型游戏的系统都设计非常完美，唯一缺点就是没有中文希望开发者看到可以翻译一下游戏，推荐购买7/10。

[h1]前言[/h1]

《世界最长的5分钟》是由日本一制作，nis发行的一款剧情向的rpg游戏，本作的叙事手法比较特别，是用回忆回想的倒叙方式来推进剧情，本质上是个文字游戏，但又其实是rpg游戏，文字冒险+rpg玩法=双倍的快乐，遗憾的是并无中文，找不到汉化补丁，你只能生啃英文日文了。

[h1]剧情[/h1]

游戏的一开始其实是我们的主角和他的队友们面对最终boss的时刻，然而突然间我们的主角失去了他所有的记忆，他不知道他是谁，他在哪，他在干什么，甚至是他要去打最终boss的原因他都忘记了。

而在战斗中随着大反派的嘲笑，队友们的嘴炮，我们的主角的记忆慢慢的在脑海中接连的闪过，一点一点从开始到结束，从第一次的成为冒险者，和伙伴们相遇最后到面对魔王的时刻，在这5分钟之内，他想起来了。

[h1]玩法[/h1]

因为本作的叙事手法是倒叙，所以我们需要控制主角来重温他的冒险，比如和npc对话、获得情报、触发事件、探索迷宫、在广阔的大地图上穿行、买卖道具装备、乃至于去打怪升级等等，本作是有一般的rpg养成要素的，这就是一款真正的rpg，只不过本作用RPG玩法来衬托了剧情，剧情是最主要的东西，所以你的一切选择和冒险都是要为了既定剧情去行动，因为本作的剧本不长，反而略短，这也是为了让rpg养成玩法来增强游戏可玩性，结合在一起确实当得上是一款精致的轻量级游戏了。

[h1]画面[/h1]

本作的画面是复古彩色像素风格，和日本一一贯的搞怪风格很搭，而且色彩丰富度上也不会缺斤少两，不过因为是像素画面，所以可能不会给玩家代入感，只会当作一款休闲级的小游戏来体验，也正因如此，对于喜欢像素风格的玩家吸引力也是颇强的，但还是建议有充足的英语或日语基础的玩家来游玩，毕竟里面有些信息如果get不到是会卡关的。

[h1]总结[/h1]

一款非常精致的像素风rpg，本作有特殊的叙事手法，不会令你感到厌烦的有趣剧情，游戏的系统也非常的亲民，并且在玩法上也无法挑剔，在紧张刺激的最终boss面前慢慢回忆你和你伙伴们的过往中，在最终boss对你的嘲笑中，在队友们的嘴炮和鼓励中，回忆起来你的一切然后战胜它，享受日本一带来的独特体验吧，推荐。",1570191200,1570191200,True,2,0,0.546586930751800537,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The Longest Five Minutes是日本一开发的像素风RPG，虽然是老套的勇者魔王题材，但是本作采用倒叙手法，讲述了一名面对魔王失忆的勇者如何在5分钟内回忆了自己被选为勇者开始直到面对魔王期间的种种经历，逐步取回力量战胜魔王的故事。回忆穿插在与魔王的战斗之间，每一段回忆相对独立；虽然是单线剧情，但是仍然有各种不按套路出牌的惊喜。总的来说游戏比较有趣，战斗也没有什么难度，可惜没有中文。

[h1]游戏体验[/h1]
勇者Flash Back与3名伙伴一同来到魔王面前展开最终决战时，他——失忆了！必杀技、战斗技巧、魔王、伙伴名字，什么也不记得。关键时刻坑队友的勇者令伙伴感到绝望。幸好，勇者Flash人如其名，在魔王面前疯狂闪回记忆，不断回忆自己一路上的经历，逐步记起了事件起因，损坏的火车，大陆之间的海船，跨洋大桥，雪山温泉，同伴学会必杀技的过程，自己拔出勇者之剑的那一刻，与托菲亚女神的交集，艰难闯过迷雾的如释重负……不断回忆的勇者与伙伴们和魔王打得难解难分，一波三折，空大，死而复生，绝处逢生……真是世界上最漫长的五分钟啊。（5h起步）

游戏特点之一就是开局打最终BOSS魔王，在5分钟的战斗中，勇者不断试图回忆起自己的记忆。玩家则进入记忆开始一段又一段冒险。大部分记忆都会让勇者回忆起某些关键信息，为劣势战局带来有生力量。战斗中，有时会弹出选项，选项对剧情走向没有什么影响，但是可以看到强行选择泄气的话时NPC的吐槽。即使选项会解锁有趣的剧情，导致BE，最后也会闪回到选项处。

记忆并不是完全按照时间顺序出现，有时会插入比上一段记忆更早的记忆。每一段记忆中都会有任务目标和数个奖杯成就，一般来说只要盯着头上有问号的NPC就可以达成全奖杯。但是有的记忆是根据选项进入不同剧情，会影响奖杯的获取。注意存档。

每一段记忆都有预设等级和道具、装备，不同记忆之间数据是独立的，每个记忆都相当于新游戏，玩家不需要在意等级、装备、道具，只需要关注当前记忆拥有的技能，跟着剧情探索。玩家可以在地图上随意行动，但是非本段记忆的区域会有障碍物/障碍NPC挡路，即使走过去也没有用。

比较有趣的是在剧情中玩家可以向魔王投降，出卖队友，成为魔王军先锋官，等级迅速增加，回到家乡化身黑暗勇者弗莱什●贝克大人在其他魔王手下的监督下屠城。当然，结局是在击杀国王时，曾经的好友冲入王宫掏出对勇者宝具直接消灭主角。然后闪回到现在，玩家仍然可以再次选择给魔王当宠物，最后在监牢里听从魔王的命令羞辱自己，最后也难逃一死。然后闪回现在……

游戏唯一难受的地方是无时无刻不暗雷遇敌，在坐完缆车后走迷雾传送门时因为疯狂遇敌忘了之前的路线，转了半天才到BOSS面前；队友开大蓄力一回合，BOSS开反弹，然后队友纷纷倒毙，玩家又复活在了迷雾迷宫的起点……我™砸键盘的心都有了。

[h1]结语[/h1]
游戏的剧情很有意思，RPG刷怪练级的步骤直接省略，玩家只要完成记忆中的任务目标即可。不过中间的迷宫太长了，加上几乎无处不在的暗雷遇敌，不管是逃跑还是战斗都要消耗许多时间，很难受。魔王战中众人开大会出现主角团众人的立绘和技能特效，是为数不多有机会看到不是像素小人的地方。当然，像素风格的角色各种动作都很可爱。正常的勇者套路剧情之间还会穿插许多有趣的情节。推荐喜欢像素风格和RM游戏的玩家都尝试一下这款不按套路出牌的RPG。

[h1]巧妙的剧情设定[/h1]

开场见最终BOSS的游戏挺多，但是面对最终BOSS却是一幅“我是谁，我在哪，你又是谁”的表情的着实是头一次看到，不得不说真的是给人带来了不小的意外。男主是带领小队讨伐恶魔之王的英雄，但大决战时刻却失去了记忆，在同伴们的帮助下，五分钟内，男主渐渐回忆起了从踏上讨伐之路开始的历程。
这个脑洞大开的叙事方式就给倒叙和插叙的叙事手法设置提供了一个合理的缘由，但抛开这个失忆的噱头不谈，把故事完全理成顺叙，就是一个很单纯王道的伴随了众多小插曲的英雄讨伐恶魔的故事了，谈不上有多么吸引人。

[h1]表现平平的音画[/h1]

游戏为像素风画面，场景、角色都和RM游戏几乎无差别，但魔王倒是给了个很精细的象素画。主角一行人像素点较大，基本职能看得出发型和衣着，但较为细致的是角色的动作和表情变化颇多，手舞足蹈加胡乱喊叫场面感十足。但是虽说是象素风，你反派这么精细，主角这个样子是不是有点敷衍啊，且战斗也并无值得夸耀的特效，有点对不起价格。
BGM质量着实不错，全程一股恢宏大气的氛围振奋人心，无奈数量着实有些稀少，配合数量庞大的战斗，耳朵都要听出茧来。

[h1]消耗耐心的流程[/h1]

战斗方面本作就是简单的回合制RPG，攻击防御法术物品，四人挨个安排。值得注意的是每一段回忆都是相互独立的，所以也并没有FM的必要，装备也根本不用惦记，闷头朝着通关走就行了。
但是游戏的流程是着实漫长，主要是迷宫相当花时间，配合暗雷遇敌，避无可避。作为一款剧情本来就不复杂，也没什么收集养成要素的RPG，这种漫长的流程相当消磨耐心。

[h1]总结[/h1]

开场失忆，噱头十足，设定有趣，其余方面包括剧情发展、画面、战斗等都没有太多过于亮眼的地方，加上相当杀时间，大概喜欢简单无脑RPG的玩家会更加适合。

《The Longest Five Minutes（最长的五分钟）》是一款由Nippon Ichi Software, Inc.,和SYUPRO-DX联合开发，NIS America, Inc.发行的日系角色扮演类RPG游戏。游戏的男主角是一名英雄，但是他貌似失忆了，于是我们则需要在不断的战斗之中，通过和别人的对话来一点一点的唤醒他尘封的记忆。

[h1] 游戏的画风	[/h1]
游戏的画风有点小小的像素风，但是像素风的设计有着很不错的怀旧意味，因为会让我联想到一起玩小霸王时候的时光，然后游戏的画风相对来说还是比较干净整洁的，欣赏性还是挺不错的，虽然没有像画作一般的精致，但是也有着十足的表现力，战斗的画面设计上简单易懂，我们可以很容易的明白自己的状态和属性，为我们以后的进攻留下更多的选择。

[h1] 游戏的剧情	[/h1]
游戏的剧情还是相当王道的，因为一开始你就会遇见大Boss（大魔王），这样的设计毫无疑问给玩家带来了很不同的体验，然后就是主角的失忆这种特殊的属性，让游戏经常使用倒叙或者插叙的叙事手法向大家展现，这样的做法可以说是十分适合游戏主角的设定的，然后主角得通过自己在旅途之中的不断的磨练，才可以获得自己失去的碎片化记忆，然后最终将碎片集合在一起，将记忆补全，竟让我感觉游戏其实还是挺有趣的（因为有目标的话才会有行动的方向）。

[h1] 游戏的模式	[/h1]
游戏的战斗方式主要为回合制的RPG模式，而且关于遭遇敌人是随时发生的，所以这样的情况让我不是很适应，特别是在迷路的情况之下，然后战斗的时候，每一个人开大的时候有特写，这是让我感觉游戏最充满激情的地方，毕竟可以造成成吨的伤害，阵容方面只要有输出有回复，那基本上就很好打，当然打Boss也是一样的，然后就是记忆的问题，每一段的记忆相互独立，也就是说装备，等级啥的不具有继承性，所以你只要想着怎么通关就好的，剩下的基本不需要操心（不需要刷刷刷来浪费时间了，直接打到目标一了百了），这样也就让目的性更加的明确，还是一个很不错的标新立异的地方。

[h1] 游戏的优点	[/h1]
+像素风的怀旧感画面
+王道的RPG剧情
+每一段记忆的独立性让目标变得更加的明确

[h1] 游戏总评	[/h1]
总体而言，这款游戏还是不错的，剧情和结构十分有意思，所以主要推荐给RPG的喜爱者。

　「あなたってよく見るとドブネズミみたいな顔してるわね」「彼女は最後にそう言った」など、独特の台詞回しと意外性のある脚本でスマホアプリのヒット作を生み出した少人数DevであるSHUPRO-DXによる企画制作。魔王や仲間との対話によるアドベンチャーパート(現在)と、記憶を紐解いていくランダムエンカウントのRPGパート(過去)が交錯する構成となっています。

　開始直後にいきなり魔王と対峙しているという最終局面を迎えていますが、勇者バックはなぜか原因不明の記憶喪失に陥っており、これまでの旅の経緯や戦う動機ですら忘れてしまっています。魔王の圧倒的な力の前に幾度となく窮地に陥りますが、その刹那に蘇る断片的な過去の記憶(フラッシュバック)から、どう逆境を切り抜けるのかのヒントを得て現状を打破する、その再帰構造が基本骨子となります。また、垣間見た記憶から少しずつ自身の身に何が起きたのかを紐解いていくことになります。



　数ある物語の中で結末を冒頭に描き、時系列を逆転させたものは多く見られます。私も最初はそのような類の物語なのだろうと思っていました。何が原因で記憶喪失になったのか、それがずっと頭の片隅にあったので次の展開が気になり、惹き込まれる作りとなっていたことは確かです。しかし、本作の妙はパターン化されたテンプレートからの逸脱にあると思います。意外性のある展開とは総じてツイストによってもたらされるものです。

　戦闘開始を告げるタイムカウントが表示され、威圧感を覚える緊迫した曲が流れる一方、思い出の中では仲間たちとの日常光景が描かれます。張り詰めた状況から一転、解放されてノスタルジーを感じさせる曲調になります。場面の転換による雰囲気と曲調の転換が、知らず知らずのうちに緩急のパターンとして刷り込まれていきます。サウンドとの一体感によって、よりシナリオが有機的に感じられるようになっている訳です。こうした緩急を見せることで、モノローグによる間もより引き立っています。

　記憶の中で描かれる仲間たちとの日常光景は、記憶喪失の謎というミステリーを忘れさせるほど魅力的なものです。ある意味定番ともいえるキャラクターの個性付けで、最初はベタなRPG演出だなと思いながら見ていましたが、幾度となく繰り返し日常が描かれることで、そのキャラクターを構築する行動心理が自ずと分かるようになっています。この描写こそ、ミステリー調から王道へと回帰する疾走感溢れる終盤の怒涛のアツい展開、「思い出の奔流」を支える礎となっています。本作の優れている点を述べるなら、第一にキャラクターの描かれ方を挙げることができるのではないかと思います。



　システム的な点に言及すると、RPGが大好きな人には少し物足りないかもしれません。というのも、場面ごとにチャプターが区切られており、チャプター間で装備やアイテムを持ち越すことができないからです。どれだけ装備やアイテムを購入しても、チャプターを跨ぐとアドル顔負けのように次のチャプターでは決まった装備に戻されてしまいます。序盤の思い出の中で町人からこの仕様について伺うことはできるのですが、銅の剣をスキップしてマイラの村で鉄の斧を購入するような人にとっては残念な訳です。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1566791809

　レベリングに関しても従来のRPGのレベルという意味においては、思い出の中で固定となっています。そうなると戦闘経験自体は無意味のように思えますが、経験は一応、従来のレベルとは別の「思い出補正」と呼ばれるレベルに還元されます。こちらが向上すると、パラメータ補正となって持ち越すことができます。一度クリアした時間軸にはチャプターセレクトにより、いつでも何度でもリトライできるため、より強くなった状態で過去を再訪できます。ここまでを聞くと、何かと有益なように聞こえます。
　本作のエンカウント率は高めです。色んな状態異常魔法などが用意されていますが、基本は物理と回復で事足ります。ボス戦自体の難易度も低めで、様々な魔法を駆使して戦わないと勝てないようなボスはいません。エンカウント率が高いこと自体に対しても""エンカウントしない魔法""が用意されており、煩わしさから解放されているのですが、そうなるとレベリング自体が不要であり、戦闘そのものに必要性がさほど感じられません。スマホゲームのような時短プレイという点においては歓迎すべきところもあるのですが、却って作業感を強める結果に繋がっているように見受けられます。また「思い出補正」そのものが死に仕様と化しています。この辺りの言葉遊びのセンスは好きなのですが…。

[quote=memories(1995)]思い出は…思い出は、逃げ込む場所じゃない！[/quote]

　遊びやすさに関して補足すると、常時チャプターセレクトが行えるのでアドベンチャーパートにおける別の行動結果だったり、RPGパートの未達成ミッションの遂行に便利ではあるのですが、そのチャプターの行動結果を反映させるにはチャプターを通して終わらせる必要がある旨は注意が必要です。またコントローラーでプレイ時にマウスカーソルが表示されてしまうと、入力のプライオリティはマウスの方が優先されるため、コントローラーでいくら入力を行ってもマウス側の入力位置に補正される点も気を付けた方がいいです。最初はなんでカーソルが勝手に戻されるのか、パッと見で気付かなかったので…。



　戦闘はやや単調に感じられるかもしれませんが、複雑になり過ぎると却って、肝心の物語が入ってこない可能性があったかも。懐かしい16bitビジュアルと、ライトモチーフを備えた有機的なサウンドが核となって物語を支えており、作家性と商業の程よいバランスを保っています。家庭用としては、PS VitaとNintendo Switchにリリースされており、PC最適化を含めて2000円を切る定価設定は妥当といえます。

　描かれているのは、安易なアイコンとして描かれがちな勇者の体現。根底にあるのは、普遍的なテーマである思い。ふとしたNPCの言葉ひとつひとつに、やさしさが溢れている。みんな理由があるから、たとえどんなに膝が震えたって、どれだけ勝ち目のない戦いであっても、立ち上がらなくっちゃいけない。終盤の怒涛の展開は是非、皆さんご自身の目で確かめてください。

You can literally go through the whole game by spamming attack and healing every so often. Theres no penelty for dying in batle since everyone levels up at the same time no matter what. Which is not really a bad thing. I'm just more used to leveling seprate characters up at a time. 

The one thing this game has going for it is it's story and the way that it's told. I will give the dev's a passing grade for this sole reason. If the game didn't have this story it wouldn't be alll that great. 

You start off with the final battle againts the demon king. Ruler of demons because of course. rpg tropes aside. As you are fighting  you loose your memories. You can't attack your basically useless you need to figure out why. You go is to complete each memory phase and unlock it's power which will help you in the battle with the demon king. (just trust me it's told batter then what i can describe of it.) 

I won't go into to many details since this is a story you should go through on your own .... but Just know that the game is very very easy. It's basically an rpg for beginners kind of like how final fantasy mystioc quest was.

剧情中规中矩，音乐瑕不掩瑜，迷宫又臭又长，[strike]价格不自量力。[/strike]

[h1]剧情[/h1]
       王道的日式RPG，基本玩个开头就能猜到过程和结局，但是叙事方法很独特。
       同类游戏都是从主角从家乡出发开始，在游戏中期容易感到无聊而玩不下去。本游戏一开始主角就要面对魔王（最终BOSS），这个“一开始”是因为主角的失忆而造成的，接下来玩家要在一段段“闪回”中回忆起旅途中的点点滴滴。

评分：7/10

[h1]游戏性[/h1]
       普通的回合制RPG。
       遇敌模式为暗雷（大地图上不显示小怪位置，每走多少步就进入战斗一次）。在大地图上还好，在冗长的迷宫中（特别是迷路时）会感到厌烦。BOSS战也很简单，三个人输出，一个人加血，没什么特别的（偶尔需要治疗一下状态）。
      [b]但是！本游戏有一个特点！就是每一段记忆是相互独立的！[/b]
      在这一段记忆中，花钱购买的物品和装备不会继承到下一段记忆中，金钱的数量和等级也是如此。所以玩家就不用刷怪攒钱买装备，直接拿钱买回血回蓝的道具就行。
      这一点算是游戏中对玩家友好的地方。

评分：4/10

[h1]画面[/h1]
     复古的像素风，没什么好说的。至于为什么打3分，是因为更低的分是为单色（黑白）游戏准备的。
     每个人物放大招的时候有特写，还算不错，否则只能靠脑补了。

评分：3/10

[h1]音乐[/h1]
       关于音乐的评分我很矛盾，一方面每个村庄都有BGM，很是用心。另一方面战斗的BGM太少了，与小怪战斗的BGM可能只有两三首，在迷宫中频繁遇敌的时候简直要听吐了。所以就打个及格分吧。

评分：6/10

[h1]总结[/h1]
       这个游戏还存在着一些问题：
       ①游戏名叫“世界上最漫长的5分钟”，看介绍以及宣传片的时候我都以为这是一个短篇游戏（我以为能够在5小时以内通关），结果却饱受迷宫折磨，玩了10个小时才通关。个人认为这种画面和叙事方式而言，时间小于5小时比较合适。一是这种像素风很难让人有长时间游玩的兴趣，二是10小时这个时间有些尴尬：如果拿出一天从头玩到尾的话太累了，每天玩一点的话，几天后前面的剧情可能又忘了。
       ②[strike]这个游戏的价格……我原以为开发商把国区调成和美区一个价格了。结果美区是35美元，国区116元也算是半价了。虽然游戏是好游戏，价格似乎有些不自量力。美区20美元，国区68元比较合适[/strike]
      现在已经变成美区$20，国区￥68了。这个价格还是比较合适的，如果你是喜欢剧情而对画面不在意的人，可以考虑入手。[spoiler]不知道会不会打折更低[/spoiler]
       ③希望能加上中文。这个游戏也登陆switch了，switch也即将要出港服了，如果这个游戏也在港服卖的话，中文大概是会有的吧？如果开发商不打算赚中国人的钱……也很正常

They were clearly trying to focus on the dungeon crawling portion of a JRPG while minimizing the actual *grind* portion. Since you can't carry stuff over, that random loot you pick up in a dungeon is more meaningful: It would be a pain to grind for enough money to get the latest equipment, so that stuff you find in a dungeon, that new tier of armor, is actually relevant. Except their attempt to fend off the grind actually hurt them quite a bit in the design stage.

So, you will never need to grind in this game. Not for levels, not for equipment, not for money. Every Flashback starts you off with everything you'll need to clear the stage with a little bit of difficulty -- assuming you aren't getting like 20 extra levels worth of stat boosts, which you probably are. Meanwhile, while towards the start of the game those chests are meaningful, by the time you get roughly halfway through the game, most of the time you open up a chest and get armor that's a tier lower than what the team already has. [b]They frequently start you off with equipment far better than you'll actually find in the dungeons[/b], which ends up meaning that even with the game having complete control of your equipment, most of the stuff you find in dungeons is [i]still[/i] little more than vendor trash. I suppose you could return to town to sell them so you can buy the next tier of armor, but that's also pointless: As mentioned before, the game's already given you everything you need to clear the thing, so why bother? And thus the dungeon crawling and monster fights turn into a chore: You already have way more levels than you'll ever need, your equipment will always be sufficient even if you don't touch stores at all, and the dungeons give you little more than vendor trash, leaving the elaborate dungeon setups as little more than mazes that slow your progress, since you're probably constantly casting repel so that you're not stuck wasting all your time in pointless monster fights. With all this said, it's pretty clear that the mechanics as they are now is incredibly flawed.

But let's talk about the other thing. Surely being able to flashback to several points in the story means that you'll have to go through the entire thing in an unusual order, right? Actually, no. For the most part, the game's pretty linear for the most part. There are a few points where they jump ahead, before returning to the previous spot we were shown, but those are the exceptions rather than the rule. Otherwise, it's pretty linear, so it feels like they didn't even deliver on the game's gimmick concept.

As for the plot itself, it is indeed pretty standard JRPG fare -- whether you consider that a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. Perhaps the biggest thing to note however, is that when taken as a whole, the game's plot seems to be split into two distinct segments, with the majority of the game in the first segment, and a second segment for the finale (roughly the last ""minute"" of the boss battle). While the first part at the very least [i]feels[/i] reactive, the second part ends up feeling less like you're a participant and more like you're being forced to watch someone else's carefully devised plot and suddenly it feels like everything you did in the first part was completely meaningless, because... As far as the game's concerned, it was. Further explanation veers into spoilers, so please try and ignore the upcoming black bars.

[spoiler]The game's final minute introduces two previously unmentioned characters, and immediately establishes them as pivotal to the plot. What, you're not invested in characters we just made appear [b]now that the game's almost over?[/b] Here, have a bunch of arbitrary flashbacks to show why you should care about them. You don't even have gameplay during these, not really. You just have flashback after flashback of ""you should care about these characters"", and I can't help but feel that I might have cared about them if these flashbacks weren't all offloaded onto me [i]during the finale[/i]. By the time they're finally revealed in the plot, you basically have no time to be invested in them, but they are constantly pushed as The Characters You Should Care Most About. You can't seriously expect us to be invested in a rival and love interest that literally aren't even mentioned until the end of the game, can you?[/spoiler]

[spoiler]I might just be a bit bitter that the constant shiptease with Clover was arbruptly dropped because of course the protagonist's one true love is this character that wasn't even mentioned before now, though.[/spoiler]

Fourth minute stuff aside, I did actually enjoy this game. I mean, I actually finished it, which is a good indicator that I was actually pretty invested in it and cared enough to play it to the end. That being said, looking at it from an analytical standpoint, I absolutely can't recommend this game to people, especially at its current price tag.",1519599694,1519599694,False,129,1,0.878951668739318848,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In depth:

What I liked:
[list]
[*] The story: the way it’s presented feels fresh, but not alienating to old school RPG fans;
[*] Built-in controls customization;
[*] The characters: Each of them felt fleshed out, and you didn’t feel like they were on an adventure just because;
[*] The graphics: Nostalgia accomplished;
[*] The music: Enjoyable! My favorite by far is the primary boss battle music, it’s so catchy! I felt sad when the battles ended.
[/list]

What I’m divided on: 
[list]
[*]The mini-games: by far the most challenging part of the game! The fun factor goes downhill with each minigame however.
[/list] 

What I disliked:
[list]
[*]The battle difficulty is stuck on very easy with no way to change it, until you find the “repel” spell battles become a chore;
[*]The name of a certain devil near the end of the game is laughable.

The whole game happens in the last five minutes of your quest. The longest five minutes in your life.

A deliberately nostalgic JRPG reminiscing of old 16 bit games, with one twist. You start the game at the final battle, but you have amnesia. The game is separated into two, the non chronological memory trip where you try to remember how you ended up there, and the fight against the demon king where choices you made in the past and in the present would affect how the fight goes. If you enjoy classic jrpg, you'd definitely enjoy this, but if you dislike old-timey 16 bit jrpg, you could give this a pass, since even with the twist it IS an old-timey 16 bit jrpg. 

Don't expect an actual old-timey jrpg though. It's short, and barely have any difficulty. You can breeze through most of the game with just auto attack. Think of it as more as a summary of an old jrpg that you never played, a nostalgia for memory that never happened...
