You might think this is just another copy + paste of the Ninjahtic game the developer cloned several times (why get paid for a game once when you can get paid 3 times?) but it's not... the brawling is different, there's a lot of differences, but then these are ultimately minor and while the game plays slightly better (but not much), it's got more in common with the Ninjahtic games than it has differences.  I guess that's the GameMaker Studio platformer template heritage. 

One important note is that even though this is an amateur project, it does seem to be sincerely and genuinely made.  I couldn't find any flipped assets, plagiarism or any other kind of insincere actions from the developer, but unfortunately genuine intentions alone are not enough to produce a brilliant PC gaming experience.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls and game handling are notably very clunky and unsmooth here.  It's janky and unsatisfying to play... and any experienced gamer will tell you, the handling, responsiveness and general gameplay feel of the control scheme must be well polished for this kind of game to succeed.  Unfortunately, this is something the developer seems to have phoned in, with little to no apparent gameplay testing.  They dropped the ball on this one.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.    To make matters worse, there's no mouse input, despite this being sold on PC as if it were a PC game.  This is unacceptable and somewhat insulting to PC gamers.  It's a good demonstration of the poor attitude the developer has towards PC gamers, and this attitude has resulted in yet another defect in this game.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

A strong argument can be made that construction kits like GameMaker Studio should never be used to make games for profit, as the ""developer"", Blaze Epic has done here.  These construction kits are intended to teach people some of the basic principles of game development, and to make small demos to pass around with friends.  They're not intended to replace to actual work of real, professional game developers.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Hikikomori No Chuunibyou has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for finishing the tutorial (without dying), trivial to achieve, but less than 10 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a modest spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, and isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 10 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who didn't bother engaging with this game?  Trading cards.  People will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.

That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with little merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Hikikomori No Chuunibyou is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

It's not the worst game I've played or everything, but for every thing it does right, it does at least one wrong.

The gameplay is a mix of parkour with occasional slight ""stealth"" elements (read: there's patroling robots which more or less instakill you if they spot you) and brawler sections. For the parkour some of the moves (mostly wallruns) are slightly janky, which make successful completion of a couple of some manuevers unguaranteed (not ragequitting bad, but often enough to add up). These parts actually feels rather well when it's flowing well (though sometimes the timed obstacles prevent a superfluid motion like you can achieve in superior precision platformers). The brawler sections boil down almost entirely to button mashing (the tutorial swears there's combos, but I could never get find anything more complex than the air versions of light and heavy attack). There's a bit of strategizing to be done to make things easier and a couple of the bosses take more conscious actions, but they are all too similar not to feel like they're there for padding after a while. There's a few enemy variants found throughout the game, but their low number paired with all but one of the ""arenas"" being just a hallway (literally, more often than not) make this a chore.

None of this is helped by how padded the game structure is. Every chapter contains at least one ""get to key, then backtrack to use it"" section, so you'll be crossing almost every screen in two directions (chapters two gets ""open worldy"", so there's even a few screens that need to be traversed four times). This isn't terrible because at least you don't need to hit switches again, but it rarely gives the rooms any significant new dimension. Oh, I mentioned switches... yeah, some screens contain switches needed to open gates, sometimes positioned so inconveniently that you'll actually need to traverse the screen three times in a row (without dying) before you can advance. There's relief when a particularly frustrating one gets finally completed and you don't have to deal with it anymore (until the return trip), but not in a ""I got gud"" manner that leads to self-congratulations.

The final problem is a relatively minor one, but bears mentioning: there's no proper saving, just chapter select. These chapters can get relatively long, so may you hopefully not have to interrupt a chapter halfway and leave it for later, lest the last thirty minutes having been in vane. I get this is likely engine limitations, but it's annoying nonetheless.

The plot is actually cute (and even includes a bit of self-awareness, as expected from a game with this title) and has some mildly funny parts. The protagonist is as loquacious as you might expect from a chuuni, but there's enough charm that even when it does get a bit too much in a couple of spots you can still wonder what comes next. Some of the fetch quests are legitimately funny. I'd quite like a remake which revamped or at least streamlined the gameplay, as sadly the sequel's tone doesn't appear to be as entertaining.

It has a lot of good ideas but sometimes fails to executes them, making the game very frustrating sometimes.

[b] Gameplay [/b]: So. This game is a 2D plateformer where the protagonist have parkour and fighting skills. You basicaly have to go from point A to point B to point A again to point C and so on. Of course your errand won't be without obstacle. You will have to go through lasers, surveillance drones and many other traps that sometimes have no reasons to be here. The run is quite enjoyable, you first feel like you can try to rush all levels because of the character's parkour assets but you will soon realize that is not the case because of the controls. You will eventually get the hang of it but still. They sometimes feel really inaccurate and some level with precise jump can become really frustrating to play. Plus, the condition to trigger the wall run are too specific (the wall which you want to run on have to be close from where you start the jump, too close), making the game more realistic in terms of wall running but in a game where some ennemies can hadoken and others can do Demon fang it feels out of place. Ah, while we are getting on it, there is combat too. The problem is : why. There is absolutly no point to introduce combat mechanism in a game like that, when you enter in a room where you have to fight, you cannot just run past them you have to knock them  out and it breaks the rythme of the game, You have to stop and just spam the A button, because battle are very easy. Even boss fight are too easy. 

[b] Art [/b] : It is minimalistic, there is a lot of recycled sprite from precedent level is used but overall it's ok. It's not bad nor it's very good. However it can feel repetitive because of the abundance of recycled sprite for the background, particulary when you are inside,plus you have to do each level the other way so it doesn't help. thankfully (I guess) the game is very short so this feeling doesn't last.

[b] Musics and sounds [/b] : I didn't hear a lot of different musics within the differents levels, actually during some cutscenes there wasn't any music at all. And in terms of sound design it's not very detailled, every sound in the game kind of sound the same, most ennemies doesn't have sound effect at all. Still musics and sounds aren't unpleasant, it just lacks variety, like for the art.

[b] Story [/b] : This is the real bad point for me, you are basicly told to go from one point to one another for some stupid reasons, at one point I wanted to skip all the dialogue so bad but still paid a little attention to, it wasn't worth the effort.

[b] Summary [/b] :

Pros : 
- Lot's of good ideas
- Chalenging levels
- High speedrun potential

Cons :
- Floppy and unprecise controls that can get you angry sometimes (thankfully I was patient)
- Useless combat mechanism that will just break the fast paced rythm of some levels
- Have to replay most levels in reverse

- The lack of variety is compensated by the short life time of the game, I don't know how to feel about that

55/100 It is not bad, nor it is good but I still enjoyed it so I will give a positive mark. It is very short but the low price tag compensate for it (even if I usually don't take price tag in account, 3hour really does feel too short). Also keep in mind that I will give a positive review (above the 50/100 bar) for every game that made me entertained for the good reason but that there is similar game that are far better than this one. Still I won't give a negative review because there are other games that are better than that one.

well, it doesn't actually show much in the way of evolution, but I will admit I enjoyed this one even after marathon-ing his  previous three titles; which, at the time, I considered, slightly good, better than good, and a slap back down to boredom and frustrating for each one in turn.

The story for this one: you are 14, a famous artist, a prodigy martial artist, and you are high... seriously,  in this one, the main character just does the auteur artist ""thing"" and gives his own version of ""by the power of grey skull"" right before he runs off for an appointment or opts to take a side quest. he goes on like this for a while, sometimes going into a huge goth/ anime/ Shakespearean sonnet when he runs into new people. The cosmic horrors don't REALLY show up until the end, and even then, the AI is programmed in such a way that everything looks more deliberate. so I personally choose to believe the ghosts and zombies near the end are actually magicians with flame throwers and homeless people respectively.

My wording may be a bit sardonic, but really it’s a... YOU GUESSED IT... tale about a free runner kid in modern japan, who gets roped into dealing with the mob, and gets stalked by entities of cosmic horror, sort of...

but here's the thing: ITS ACTUALLY GOOD!!!

-the story actually follows a three act structure, with few plot holes (considering), and not only does it make sense, it also doesn't destroy the cannon of a far more deserving game. it's actually most like that of old school RPG's, but while it is a rigid story structure - it is still a giant leap in the right direction

-the game play mechanics are similar to that of the way of the pixelated fist. while animation is less fluid, the really stupid press up or down to block randomly generated/ unpredictable attacks ""bull****"" is gone. fighting actually feels more like a skirmish with single button attack patterns and limited combos. its good!

-the environments... well the environments still look like Ninjahtic a bit,

-sound track... look smooth jazz in the rain is great, but for some reason it’s really grating here, AND all of the tracks seem to merge together after awhile. And as the game gets more and more tense, the music starts to lul me to sleep, and it just tenses my mind, to the point that I actually had to start listening to classic rock music just to be able to focus... if that makes sense

-the main character (and all of the characters for that matter) actually has a personality. Some characters are all harsh and stern and some never really left Woodstock... but that's just fine and sometimes its wholly enjoyable!

i just take umbridge with 3 things:

1) game-play doesn't inform your story. 

out on the street, trying to make a martial arts name for yourself? hey lets have a street gang fight the main character the entire way... instead of steadily getting worse with every poster...

an impostor is hounding you? well lets just bring him up out of context among other anime references and drug addled ramblings... instead of running into him, stealing, and then selling your work a few times...

2) the music, for some reason, doesn't sound as good...

and 3)this isn't a new game play style.

the screens don't scroll, to my knowledge, and the combat and free running elements are back in full swing. sure the pole standing mechanic is a breath of fresh air, and it isn't the same wall jumping, pixel nightmare like the last three, but the whole game is still a 2d/platformer/beat 'em up

branch out, do something more zelda ish, or something more metroidvania, or even try to do something like hyperlight drifter to get out of the usual comfort zone. focus on making a HEARTFELT story and make an RPG, or just experiment with something else entirely different.

i do, However, enjoy this game, and I choose to see it as both a fresh step, and a massive apology for releasing ""the way of the pixelated fist"" in a broken and unforgiving state.

its good again blaze, just a few minor tweaks and it could really be something... but its all actually starting to feel FLAT. I marveled at ""samurai_jazz"" and all that was was a zelda dungeon stretched out to a full game all to itself (VERY Broadly speaking, that is) and I liked the sequel, but the sense of immersion has dimmed to less and less with each game; until now, when I see the city in the background as more of a matte painting than the setting of a grand adventure.

if you want to move on, and get better:
design something from scratch and make it a somewhat enjoyable experience, using what you learned as a guideline

if you want to revisit your  classics and focus on the past, then let me suggest a script:

""The demon lord has been defeated, and the earth has been fixed by Imp-Fiend (who now has no place to go and is stuck in the mortal plane). after doing the whole ghost/'poltergeist' thing around the world he runs into Dag. 
Then, as Dag, you start to follow the advice of some shadow (that we all know as Imp Fiend) and make your own martial arts street gang steal a bunch of art and old weapons. This gets the attention of 'Ninja'.
Ninja starts to notice the drones and cyber punk alien stuff gravitating to one point in the city. 'Ninja' runs about taking out the drones and 'tomb raiding in the catacombs'. 
Imp Fiend then uses Dag's gathered tech and ancient weapons, to make a new body. the ancient tech goes haywire, and falls into the control of the aliens. 
Dag and Ninja make a break for it into the jungle and meet Imp Fiend who basically says 'sorry, it’s what I do'. everyone has their backs up against the wall as the aliens approach... so Imp Fiend throws open a portal and calls fourth death incarnate. 
tons of creatures and ghosts fly out of the portal. they all run again for a short time (all the while cursing this dark ghost (that we all know is Imp Fiend)). at the very end of the path, the 3 are hiding behind cover, from the aliens and malevolent spirits, and the Ronin digs himself from the earth, behind the hoard. As Ronin, you slaughter the alien herd and lead the others to safety. 
The final levels take place in the neo 40's Tokyo district; and are equal parts poltergeist -ing, Ninja poof jumping through air ducts to hack computers, Dag directing runners/gang members to secure buildings, and Ronin hack & slashing and stealth killing AND dodging/acrobatically jumping over ghosts and aliens.
When everyone gets to the end of the district, it turns out that 'Ninja' is still under the control of the aliens, and has actually been relaying info to them the whole time. He is beaten back into a coma by Dag. Imp Fiend, Ronin and Dag find the 3 spirit mobsters in the old building and ask them to banish the aliens and demons. the spirits retaliate, Imp Fiend wins his battle, but gets canceled out, Dag wins but gets thrown out of the building to the arms of his gang, and Ronin wins against his own special boss. The three tell him that the only way to banish the wicked spirits is if he dies (since Ronin is the last thing holding open Imp Fiend's portals).
Ronin is assisted in suicide by the ghost of his dead master, as Dag and his gang watches the final honorable rite. cut to a final epilogue with a picture of Dag and his gang carrying Ninja and Ronin's sword back to the mega city all the while, stalked by the alien princess…”",1481730206,1548621302,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Über die Steuerung lässt sich streiten, denn das Springen und Wände hoch laufen ist manchmal echt schwerfällig, wodurch man nur in den Tod springen kann. Anderseits ist diese Idee des Fortbewegens relativ neu und mal was anderes (gut). Die einzelnen Level ziehen sich teilweise in die Länge, wodurch man reines Areale abklappern macht, wie ein Arcade oder ein Gelegenheitsspiel.

Was mir gerade beim ersten Level negativ aufgefallen ist, das wenn man es geschafft hat von A nach B zu kommen, wieder nach A zurück muss. Das heißt alles wieder von vorne sehen und machen. Naja zieht die Stimmung runter. Im zweiten Level war es leider nicht viel anders, nur neue Gegnertypen und Areale sind hinzu gekommen.

Hikikomori No Chuunibyou is a pseudo 8-bit platform-adventure game with beat-em-up, puzzle, and stealth elements. At its heart it is a classically inspired platform game with retro graphics and outstanding storytelling.

However, unlike classic platformers the unique selling point here is the utilization of parkour-style abilities and martial arts techniques.

[h1]Mixed Feelings[/h1]

Unfortunately, I have mixed feelings this time around. There’s something about the gameplay that isn’t as well executed or as fluid. I cannot quite put my finger on it. The parkour-style wall jumping and platforming don’t feel as engaging nor as pleasurable as the Ninjahtic games. In fact, they were often quite frustrating and rage inducing.

One of the problems was that there were rooms where I found myself stuck in for extended periods of time. This didn’t happen previously. I breezed through the tutorial and learned the commands required to play the game. However, when it came to the scenes following those early ones I struggled. This is unlike me. Others have reported having similar issues. Many who had successfully completed the Ninjahtic games.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of the game. Blaze Epic have continuity in their games presentation and production value wise. For such an inexpensive game to achieve such a consistent level is pleasing.

What I have come to expect from their games is honesty. In many of the games that I play I feel that the screen shots are not representative of the game that you play at all. With Blaze Epic games I know that they are the genuine article. If you enjoy the artwork that is demonstrated in the screenshots then you’re going to enjoy the in game art. The same logic applies with the soundtrack. If the music used in the trailer appeals to you then you’ll find the same type of music utilized in the game.

[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]

Blaze Epic is a developer that understands the needs and wants of the Steam community. Therefore, the game does include trading cards and Steam achievements. The game comes with a set of six trading cards while for hunters there’s a total of 13 Steam achievements.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Obviously I have stated that I found the gameplay to be lacking the fluidity of the Ninjahtic games. However, despite this fact, it would be overly critical to not recommend the game. There are more highs than lows. Those who enjoy platforming games will find much to love here as well. The game scores highly on the value proposition. There’s more than enough content here to justify the inexpensive purchase price. I do recommend that beginners to Blaze Epic snap up The Ninjahtic Series as well.

I love retro-styled platformers, and the idea of one that incorporated a free-running movements system into a 2D platformer seemed intriguing. Unfortunately, the parkour system is a huge frustration, as it doesn't seem as if the wall running triggers reliably when it should. Pair this with the unnecessary repetition of screens by having to play every one at least twice on each level, and things get annoying quickly. There are also some issues with being able to tell when the character will grab onto a ledge or hang from a bar, which can lead to seemingly random deaths.

The game also seems to have an identity problem, as the parkour movement encourages speed and free-flowing platforming (when it works), but then there will be things inserted into the levels that you have to stop and wait for, such as drones to hide from or precise jumps to time between laser beams. Similarly, the combat sections seem to want to replicate a martial arts fight, and while you have various types of attacks, you can simply mash your basic attacks and get through pretty much any fight.

The story also makes no sense. I assume that the concept of ""chuunibyou"" is something that Japanese people or fans of anime and manga would understand, but I had to look it up. Once I did, though, it seemed like a simple enough idea. In the game, though, it seems less clear what is real and what is in the character's delusion. There are also times where there are sentences that just don't make any sense, and the dialogue is often awkward and unnatural (such as the time the characters are discussing the virtues of manga artists and how they should be viewed, which feels very preachy directly toward the player). It was all very bizarre.

It's really a shame, too, as it has a lot of potential, and when things work like they're supposed to, it can be really fun. I try to keep in mind that the game was only $2, so I wasn't expecting something as polished as a Shovel Knight or Freedom Planet, but the four hours I spent with the game were four of the most frustrating hours I've spent with a game in recent memory.",1468969600,1468969600,False,17,0,0.674245774745941162,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The achievements are fairly easy, and the gameplay of the game is nothing to shy away from.
There are times where you can't get to a certain place in the game due to how difficult it may be to wall run, but as you proceed farther, you'll eventually get the hang of it. There is also Combat in the game, its your standard beat'em up control scheme: Strong attack, Weak Attack, Jump. I'm not entirely sure if you can die in the game (since there is no indication of a health bar or meter), but if you do get stuck in between two enemies, get ready to struggle to your hearts content to break free. For what it's worth being around 1$~2$ I'd say its a game thats worth picking up if you want something short and fun.
