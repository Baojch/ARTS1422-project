It was something that began with the previous generation of games.  Slowly, but surely, more and more developers started cutting what was once a staple feature.  Now, you'll be extremely hard pressed to find a game that isn't made by Nintendo and supports a party of gamers sharing the same couch.

Enter Gurgamoth.  For some time now, I have been lamenting that gaming has hit a dull point.  This is a similar sentiment I had back in 2009 and 2010.  I've been trying to find a game that snaps me out of the endless slump of shooters.  As if the faceless ones heard my plea, I received an email from the folks at Galvanic Games.  They had released a new game.  A game that promised lightning fast combat, tight controls, and local co-op.  In fact, that's the only mode it has.

Gurgamoth has up to four players selecting from six different cultists to do battle in a free-for-all.  That's it.  There's no teams, no single player mode, no online mode, and no progression.  Simple.  Just choose your favorite little cultist and then kill everyone else to appease and summon the titular Gurgamoth.  

In an age where so many games are packed full of content meant to keep players engaged, and with the promise of DLC keeping them further locked in, it can be a bit much.  So many games require absolute dedication to master.  If you stray to another game too long or are just a casual player to begin with, then it really sucks to be you.  You'll fall behind the pack, miss out on awesome world events, and generally be a worse player in the competitive scene.  It's a time where people are worried about character levels and kill/death ratios.

Gurgamoth does away with all of that and it is a much needed breath of fresh air.  Do you want to know what Gurgamoth truly is?  It's a party game.  It's a fantastic party game.  All you need is a computer on par with an Easy Bake Oven, a set of controllers, and the people to play it.  Hell, if you're running it off a laptop, have a USB hub, and an HDMI cable, you can connect it to that fancy big screen in the living room and really go to town.

Among the six cultists, there is some fairly good representation.  Cavendish is evocative of Lovecraftian lore, Nekren-Pha is Egyptian, Thragg a Viking, Xiatat is Mayan/Aztec, Morok a fan of Sauron, and Lilith just a fun little psycho.  Each is adorable and colorful and it's those colors that keeps things straight amidst the chaos.  There are no special power-ups for individual characters or any unique abilities.  Simply pick the one that is the most aesthetically pleasing and kill everyone else.

No, what makes Gurgamoth unique and really adds the challenge are the levels.  There are several to choose from and each behaves quite differently from the last.  Each cultist flies around and tries to bash the others into the many hazards on the level.  These could be spikes on the wall, happy moons that spew lasers of death, or saw blades hewing down a forest.  Some levels will shrink down and force the players into tighter spaces, while other power-ups can split the screen to disorient players.  It's fast.  It's chaotic.  It's more fun than witnessing a great one.

Gurgamoth must be played with a controller.  In my instance, I simply connected a few Xbox One controllers and it worked beautifully.  The controls are spot on and there wasn't an instance where I died and thought it was anything other than my fault.  Aside from the level design, this is where the real complexity of Gurgamoth is to be found.  It's a game that is simple enough to get into and have fun with, but when you start uncovering the intricacies of the controls and abilities, it becomes engrossing in its depth.  

For example, each player has so many points to attack, stun, or phase with.  On average, each player has three.  You can burn through them quickly, and they recover just quick enough to keep you in the action.  However, you can try to stun other players and aside from rendering them crippled, you have taken their points in a vampiric ritual.  Phasing allows you to pass through other players and obstacles.  It can be quite effective to phase through a charging opponent in order to let them pass through, so you can smash them from behind.  It's like a frantic game of Rock Paper Scissors.

The overall design for Gurgamoth is brilliant.  When I first played it, I immediately thought it was Lovecraft for kids.  It's dark, kooky, colorful, macabre, and adorable.  There is shocking amount of detail in play.  From multiple layers of the levels moving around, to the way the little cultist capes flap like wings, it's a feast for the eyes and I was always spotting something new.  It's a stark departure from the muted palates of more realistic games without falling into a pixelated mess of 8 and 16-bit knockoffs.

Where the art design leaves off, the sound picks up.  The soundtrack alone is worth picking the game up.  Much like the artwork, it's a amalgam of occult darkness mixed with a vibrant buoyancy.  It's what I would expect to hear if I went to a rave with Cthulhu and the Wolfman.   

While I an enthralled with Gurgamoth, there are some weaknesses.  Well, one.  And it's not really a weakness.  Since it only supports local co-op, there's no way to play it by yourself.  This is a game that I probably would have invested dozens of more hours into already if I were able.  As it stands, I need to invite someone over or lug my entire setup to their place to play.  An online component or even the chance to battle AI would be extremely welcome.  

As it stands, the only issue I have with the game is that I can't play it more.  It's simple, straight to the point, and very good at what it does.  If you have a regular game night with friends, or want a great way to break the ice at a party, Gurgamoth is the way to go.  It's deceptively simple and complex enough to keep you coming back for more.  The art design is among my favorite in any game and I'm itching to play some more.  As of this review, it's only $9.99 on Steam and well worth the asking price.  Go pick it up now!",1632617899,1632617899,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And if you like the gameplay, there is a good chance to come back.

+=""pros""; -=""cons""

+ The biggest pro of this game are undoubtedly [b]graphics[/b]!
-  Although [b]characters have only an esthethical role[/b].
+ [b]Sounds are good[/b] ,too , and well combined with the gameplay
+ [b]Level design is very good although i hope something will be added in future to raise the fun-o-meter[/b]
   The concept should be ""easy to play, hard to master"" but 
- the game itself is [b]too frenetic[/b] and [b]controls are not very good[/b] because they are limited to 2 (Yes TWO) key buttons yet they do not offer the proper variety to the gameplay and to the control of the character 
although 
+ when played 1v1 the game is very funny and enjoyable,  without lacking competitivity! 
- There's [b]NO SUPPORT for the keyboard[/b] (Why?) So if you want to play with your friends you'll need 4 controllers. (although you may use the arrows to move and ""enter"" for ""A"" and ""ú"" for B) 
- The game [b]lacks some more power-ups[/b] for the characters and some [b]peculiar moves to differentiate the gameplay[/b].
+ the objects in the levels such as the spikeballs and the ice balls and the laserballs are excellent! 
- There's [b]no ""story mode"" or ""career mode""[/b] and for a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY game this is a big problem.
- Last but not least, there's [b]NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER[/b]... wake up guys we're in 2017 and everyone is looking for a casual game to play online with friends! Local multiplayer is certainly a limit.


[h1]Suggestions[/h1]
{} Let people configure the key bindings in the settings (and add Keyboard support)
{} Add more options to use more of the 14 buttons on the controller 
{} Add peculiar moves to characters
{} SLOW DOWN THE GAMEPLAY! Not too much, but at least of a bit that would make this game more enjoyable: in 4 players it's a complete mess! 
{} Add more modes! There's one single mode and thereby the game loses replayablity!
{} Add more Power-Ups (also ""Bad power ups""  please)  to spicy the game
{} Build a campaign mode (preferrably co-op friendly) [look at ""Ultratron"", both for power ups and for the ""campaign mode""]
{} Allow to choose whether you want to pla with 1-2 or 3 bots
{} ADD ONLINE MULTIPLAYER AND COOP 
{} ADD MODS SUPPORT! I'm curious to see what the community could develop


[h1]Final consideration[/h1]
By now, I would not suggest this game to my friends(although I would invite them to come to me and play together), and i'm looking forward to see how this will develop in the future.
Here's for example somethign a random guy made in the discussions:
[quote=AuranRage;361798516950377117]Online Multiplayer is ESSENTIAL to make this game popular and sell it more. I bought this game but I have like 30 friends willing to buy it too and none are going to because we can simply wait for that one day of the year that we come together and play it on my account. [/quote]
This is my exact situation, because there are several friends of mine that won't buy the game because it hasn't got multiplayer.
But overall the game is sufficiently enjoyable , especially when played 1vs1, so my final choice is positive, but remember that [b]I wouldn't pay more than 90 cents[/b] for this game..",1488204974,1488292282,True,20,2,0.728287577629089355,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The team led by C.J. Kimberlin have already developed two other games in Rust Belt and Moderne Artiste. Gurgamoth is the team’s debut title on Steam. It’s a local multiplayer fighter that has recently undergone a greatly appreciated update that has seen the introduction of bots into the game. This has given the game an enormous boost in playability because, obviously, those who wouldn’t have been able to enjoy the game previously are now in a position where they can play.

Before I begin to praise the bot game – the one mode that I’ve been able to play to this date – I want to pinpoint a negative. The game, for whatever reason, gave me the ability to control multiple players in each game. Given that the starting point for each round can position the characters at either side of the screen and there are deadly traps on the sides of the screen the game almost demands that you will kill off one of the characters before you begin. The only time that you score a point is if you win the round and only one character can win the game. Therefore I would have much preferred the standard ability of controlling just a single character and playing against three AI controlled players. I’m not sure whether this was the intention of the devs or not when they introduced this mode for single players but it was more than a little frustrating.

With that said I can see how this would be a wonderful game for those who have the ability to play the game in a multiplayer environment. The game has the potential to have a great competitive scene and local competitions would be an enormous amount of fun. Unfortunately that isn’t me at this current time but when we have my partner’s best friend’s family up during school holidays it will be a game that I load up for a bit of fun. There’s been a few games such as The Hauntsters and Dwarven Brawl Bros that we have already featured and that I will be endeavoring to play with them but I believe that Gurgamoth has the potential to be at the head of the list.

What I enjoyed most about Gurgamoth is the presentation. I quite enjoyed the design choices in the color palette and the sound. The game controls very well and with the fast pace of the game and the traps deaths feel very fair but also exciting and challenging. It’s a very clever mix. There are a number of different effects that can kill you, the player can use the environments to their advantage and everything seems to be in keeping with the pace of the game.

A minor disappointment is that the only differences in the characters that I can notice at this stage are cosmetic. It may have been nice to implement different strengths and weaknesses to the characters but I admit that given the environment of the game that may have altered the competitive balance of the game and players may have felt that they were at a distinct advantage/disadvantage if forced to choose one character over another.

Gurgamoth is half price for another couple of days. Therefore you will not find a better opportunity to purchase the game at a better price for some time.",1462186489,1462186489,True,9,1,0.544108331203460693,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience. Be advised: this game works optimally when played with a controller.

If you enjoy arena-based local-multiplayer games, killing your friends, and fast-paced gameplay, then you will enjoy Gurgamoth.

The aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the environment, characters, and different special effects is very high. There are a number of different characters you can play as, however, this offers only a cosmetic change. The music and sound assets are appropriate for the quick playstyle of the game.

Controls are very simple and easy to learn, however, I must again stress the importance of using a controller when playing; you can use the keyboard and mouse, but Gurgamoth is optimized for gamepad use. You can also play with up to three people using the keyboard and mouse, but it can be quite clutter-some to set things up this way. There is a pop up tutorial of the controls whenever you begin a match, but the different stage hazards/items (appear in the form of asteroids) are not explained anywhere, and must be learned the hard (and fun) way. The learning curve is mostly minimal, but mastering gameplay can take some time. The most challenging part of Gurgamoth will probably be perfecting your timing - a well-executed dodge+boost combo can end with your opponent's death (or yours).

Gameplay consists of you trying to kill your opponents by boosting into them, usually pushing them into some type of environmental hazard that varies depending on stage. For example, one stage has spikes along the edges of the map, but a covering layer must first be hit before the hazard is active (you can do this by boosting into it yourself, or by pushing an enemy). Other hazards include electricity towers that periodically turn on and laser-spitting meteors. The first player to 3 rounds won takes the cake. You begin the game with 3 boosts - there is a cooldown that will slowly recover - and the game handles balancing very well because if you are losing by a lot (ex: 0-2), it will give you 4 boosts and handicap the person winning to 2 boosts.

Other asteroids will offer you temporary bonuses - like infinite boosts, a one-hit shield, slowing down time, and warping the stage perspective (ex: shrinking the map). These, along with the different hazard set up of each stage, help add a lot to the game's replayability.

Overall, the game plays really well for an arena-based local multiplayer game, so long as you have enough controllers handy. If you enjoy fast-paced gameplay, then you should definitely give this title a try.

[b] About [/b]

Gurgamoth is a simple but fun party game to play with up to 4 people. Sit down on a couch, grab a controller and become the one to awaken Gurgamoth.
Each of you controls a cultist. One of the characters in the game. Your goal is to beat your enemies to get the honor of awakening Gurgamoth... whoever the hell that is.
It's one of those games which you start up, beat a friend a couple of times before dropping the controller and leaving satisfied.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

NOTE: [u] PLAY THIS WITH A CONTROLLER IF YOU HAVE ONE [/u]

The gameplay is very basic. Dodge, attack, anticipate when your enemy is going to attack, watch out for the map itself (sawblades, spikes etc) and try to beat your opponents. Your only weapon: the map itself.

The controls are responsive and the game is fast paced. 
There are power-ups and every level has their own dangers to watch out for next to your opponent.
You have to be smart and rely on quick timing to win the battle. 

[b] [u] PROS  [/u] [/b]

[list]
[*] The visual design
[*] The soundtrack
[*] The unique levels which keep it refreshing with its own dangers
[*] Colourful characters to choose from
[*] Easy to pick up and play when you and your friends are bored
[*] Local co-op 
[*] Love the animations
[/list]

[b][u] CONS [/u] [/b]

[list]
[*] No campaign or story behind Gurgamoth
[*] No singleplayer of any kind which is a bummer, would love to know more about the colourful characters!
[*] Only local so no multiplayer.
[/list]

[b] Verdict [/b]

When you have friends over who enjoy games, have them bring a controller to play this. It's fun, fast and it looks great. It's perfect for a fun time with your buds.
The visual design is great and the soundtrack fits the quick gameplay. I enjoyed smashing my mates into a sawblade and so will you. If you have controllers lying around that is. I do recommend this to any of you who are looking for a fun game to play with your friends.
A great game. Having a laugh while playing is really what adds to the game experience.

[b] [u] Final verdict: 7.5/10 [/u] [/b]Great for what it is!  But in my opinion a missed  opportunity in the story behind the characters and Gurgamoth, That could make an interesting game.

- You can NOT play this game alone 
- No AI or bots to play with or add-to the party
- I felt like it's designed to be played with 4-players so you need 3-4 controllers
- Gameplay is pretty simplistic, it is essentially ""bumper cars"", you can lunge at someone, pass through them, or stun them.

Overall it's a great party-game, but I would NOT recommend this to someone who mainly plays games alone or does not have multiple controllers laying around.

Positives:
+ Gurgamoth stays refreshing from it's awesome level designs and level interactions. Level hazards such as spinning blade and enclosing walls keep the players vigilant.

I feel though single player is a huge opportunity missed in this game. I am often playing games by myself as I dislike much social interaction. If the game had AI and some sort of single player mode it would be much more accessible for players like myself who are often alone.

The game really does shine as a party game though and if you do have a group of gamers you constantly play local games with then I’d highly recommend this game. If you are more Lone wolf like myself then I’d avoid it unfortunately.
