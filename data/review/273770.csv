It's not as exciting as hospital tycoon games or city builders, even if it was developed well, it wouldn't be that interesting.  But the technical implementation here is garbage, even for a game from 2016.

Apart from just looking bad and being clunky, it's riddled with bugs and inconveniences.  This really does look and feel like a bargain bin game from the 1990s. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game interface is mostly just text boxes/dialogs and where there are graphical elements, they look like rejects from 1998.  While that might be fine for the 1990s, gaming has evolved a lot since then... it's 2023, and that kind of thing just won't fly anymore, it's just not visually up to scratch.

The game only displays in 4:3 stretched aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the video game construction kit/toolset, the 3D GameStudio from Conitec Datasystems.  In their own words, this system is so dumbed down you can ""click together 3D games from pre-assembled game templates"" in a matter of hours.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur/unskilled developers as it doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Game Tycoon 1.5 is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

- The tutorial narrator keeps talking and showing his avatar every couple seconds, making it impossible to see what's behind him and making the game super annoying.
- The tutorial tells you to go to a place X and click on thing Y. However, you can't tell what that thing is, neither where it's located.
- The tutorial actions are too generic, so you can't know what you need to do. How am I supposed to know that ""Now, you can speed up the time a bit…"" means that I need to click on a poorly designed bar in the bottom of the screen with a snail icon? Why not say ""Now, you can speed up the time a bit by clicking in the bar located in the bottom of your screen"". How about ""Go to your office""? There is nothing showing you that this specific building is your project office, which is separated from the first building you're guided to, which is also your office, but of another kind.
- The tutorial voice overlaps with other voices in the game, making both impossible to understand, and are unskippable.
- If you click on something before finishing the first, you flicker the screen on the first action and then proceed to the second one.

I still have the box and the CD for the game somewhere around the house too. Perhaps nostalgia for old games i played when i was younger made me give this game a shot again, with me forgetting the jank-ness of the game, as well as how repetitive and boring it is.

Let me just take a quick second to point something out, this game came out before game dev tycoon and game dev story. This was a game from around 2007, did this game get put on steam to cash in on the success of those games? Probably. But I wanted to just clear up the misconception that people thought this was a quick game made to appeal to people enjoying the genre at the time, this is an older game then them. Still though, this game is definitely bad.

Lets begin with how you can play the game. You can play an endless mode, which has no real challenge other then not going bankrupt, and a campaign mode which lets you 'attempt' to follow a tutorial, and a few mission games, such as making a game of specific quality or earning x amount of money. From there, you can select your company logo, pick from one of three characters and name your company. After which, the game begins.

There are four 'sections' you can go in the game. The first is the office area, which has a bank, your office and your development office. The second section is the university, where you can hire programmers, artists or composers, as well as buy news article information on current game trends as well as how you and your companies currently published games came out like. The third section is the industrial park section. This section has the marketing firm area, where you can advertise your company to improve the likelihood of your games selling better, the licensing office, where you can rent a game engine for a single game development use, take on distribution deals, and, at the first of every month, participate in auctions to acquire licenses to create game tie ins. Next is the publishing house, where you can put your game and the contents of it, such as a manual or t shirt together, print out the amount of copies you want of the game, and then set up the distribution. Lastly in this section is the game store which simply shows how current games are selling. The final section is a 'home' section. Where you can add some items in your house. There is no other reason to this section.

The whole game revolves around these four sections and the game can boil down to a very simple and repeated pattern. Get money from the bank, hire some employees, pick up a game engine, find a distributor you think you can work with their demands of quality, genre and time frame. Construct the game concept, tell your employees to develop the game. Go to the printing house, set up how you want your game to be bundled, print copies, get the distributor to distribute the game, wait a month to see how sales went. Rinse, repeat ad nauseum. Thats it. Now, you may be saying that isnt necessarily bad, just boring. But it gets much much worse.

You see, the game is buggy. Very, very buggy. You can bug out dialogues in the game by clicking dialogue options multiple times, which can be annoying to try and get out of dialogues, to absolutely game breaking. You can sell so much of your stock that doesn't exist, that you break the integer limit and give yourself infinite money. But thats not all, the game is very unstable. This game will crash, like once every ten minutes. As I mentioned, this was a game from around 13 years ago, and its clear that the jank which existed when the game originally came out, only got worse with time, as there was no effort to clean up the bugs or make the game run any better. Your games will crash and there is no auto save. Saving can also crash your game, or make your game restart. 

Ultimately, this game is even worse then i remember it and, frankly should not be on steam. It is clearly broken, and has been long abandoned by the original creators. A simple cash grab at the time, now destined to get the occasional dollar or two from hopeful individuals looking for a different taste at the business sim genre. Please avoid.

P.S One last thing, the game seems to take inspiration, at least in my opinion, from airline tycoon. The whole idea of playing as a character, in a cartoonesque environment dealing with cartoonesque people through dialogue in a more 'direct management' style of play. Airline Tycoon is a great game, and if you want to see what im talking about where you can see the inspiration of the game style comes from, take a look at that game.",1645249087,1645249087,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

"" Mais voyons, mon fils... Tu sais que nous sommes pauvres, mais va voir dans la cuisine, j'ai une surprise pour toi""

""Constate qu'un jeu sous le nom de Game Tycoon 1.5 est sur la table""

Game Tycoon est mauvais, soyons honnêtes, le jeu est en 4:3, les paramètres sont inexistants, les musiques sonnent comme une époque révolue et la direction artistique transpire les années 90/2000 en plus des moult bugs faisant parfois crasher l'ordinateur.

Du coup, deux questions me sont venus en tête : le jeu est-il réellement sorti en 2014 ou est-ce simplement un troll de la part des créateurs de sortir un jeu aussi exécrable ?  

Je me suis donc penché sur mon premier questionnement et pour moi c'était une évidence, Game Tycoon est bien plus vieux que ça et c'est en fouillant la chaîne YouTube du studio Sunlight Games que j'ai constaté que le projet de base venait du studio ""Enjoy Entertainment"" qui avait déjà sorti le jeu en 2003, ce qui est beaucoup plus logique.
En Bref, Sunlight Games a récupérer les droits de cette licence tout comme ils l'ont fait avec Gold Rush! apparu à la base sur amiga en 1988.

Mais est-ce que ça pardonne les défauts ? Évidemment que non ! A cette époque d'excellents jeux de gestions aux budgets moindres proposaient quelque chose de convenable et qui sont encore jouables de nos jours.
Est-ce l'ancêtre de Game Dev Tycoon ce qui fait que Game Tycoon proposait un genre novateur ? Toujours pas. Game Dev Story est sorti en 1997 et il est sans aucun doute à des années lumières au niveau de l'optimisation, de la direction artisitique et de la bande sonore.

Ajoutons que la version 1.5 n'a rien améliorer. Quid du second volet ? Les avis sont unanimes sur le fait que c'est mauvais à cause des mêmes problèmes que le premier volet.

Donc il est évident que la série "" Game Tycoon "" ( Et je parle bien de Game Tycoon et non de Game DEV Tycoon qui lui est très bon ) est à éviter bien que l'adaptation ""Idle"" sur smartphone a l'air d'être convenable, mais je déteste être méchant et je suis donc allé voir de plus prêt les autres productions de Sunlight Games, car concevoir un jeu est une tâche complexe, parfois coûteuse et que ça ma fait mal au coeur de voir que leurs dernières sorties sont si peu populaires, alors que les jeux ont l'air d'être à des années lumières de la série Game Tycoon.

Par exemple, Gangsters 1920 a l'air d'être plutôt sympa et sur quelques aspects original en dépit d'une pâte graphique ou on a l'impression qu'il manque quelque chose : https://store.steampowered.com/app/1163490/Gangsters_1920/?curator_clanid=33033027

Construction Playground doit probablement faire le café pour un simulateur allemand, un jeu générique, certes, mais on voit que le studio peut faire des jeux autre que des productions à l'optimisation douteuse et à la DA horrible : https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451420/Construction_Playground/?curator_clanid=33033027

Maybe I'm bad at following directions, but some of the tasks that it has you do to set up your own game aren't exactly clear and leaves you wondering if you'd missed a step. I eventually got to getting my game being published, but I don't believe I ever got it published because for whatever reason it wouldn't work or maybe I did get it to work one time, but I can't exactly remember and don't bother to. I see that there's a manual, but you'd think that if the game is going to teach it to you anyway, you'd be able to manage, but that doesn't always seem to be the case.

It's a very niche concept, but there are a few games out there centered around the idea of playing as a game developing company.  Many times these games start the player back in the 80's, to recreate the gaming industry from its inception to the present day.  The objective is to lead a team of game developers in designing an engine and producing various game series that sell well and keep the company in the black.  It doesn't sound very invigorating, a game based around work, and dipping deep into meta territory at that, but when pulled off right, they are well received.  This game doesn't do things right though, and is widely panned for it.  


[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
	• The graphics are colorful and tolerable.
	• There are some voice-acted lines.  
	• The music is upbeat.  	


[h1] Cons: [/h1] 
	• The game design isn't clear as to what certain features are supposed to represent or mean.  Even which office is yours isn't immediately obvious.  When the game refers to a file cabinet or the project, I don't see anything that quite fits that description, so I'm not positive to what they're referring.  
	• The game seemingly expects you to know how running a business should work already, as it expected you to take out a loan from the bank, with no details or explanation on how much of an interest rate there'd be on the loan, how often you'd have to make payments, and so forth.  
	• When trying to create a game engine, I didn't know what features were necessary or what impact selecting or not selecting various options would have on the development process.  Would it make the product better but take longer, was there more chance for bugs?  
	• The reward for successfully running the business didn't matter or motivate me.  Why do I care if my avatar can buy a fancy car or furniture?  Unless it grants some benefit, it's mere fluff.  
	• The game feels too much like actual work and is boring.  


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
This game seemed to emphasize and focus too much on the wrong aspects of game development and running a company that people simply don't care about.  Having players walk around various areas, such as to the bank to apply for a loan, or over to a university to seek out employees, starts going too far into recreating the feeling of doing this in real-life.  Being realistic can be something to strive for in a game, but not when it's simulating office work.  I don't feel like someone working in a gaming company and doing a labor of love.  I feel like I'm heading into the office, taking care of errands along the way, before shuffling through a file cabinet and completing paperwork.  The tasks of acquiring capital and employees could have been done from the company and in a quick and painless manner, so I could get into the core gameplay instead.  I got confused as to how to complete objectives in the game, and was bored before I even got a game started, so I can't recommend this meta experience to anyone.",1567443405,1608657844,False,13,0,0.666219353675842285,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Back in the day, there were more Tycoon games that made interfaces in such way, but they were usually better designed, accessible and comprehensible.

Ich bin ein Fan von Videospielen und von Tycoon Games. Da lag der kauf dieses Titels nah, ich rechnete mit einem sehr schlechten Spiel als ich es startete da die Bewertungen ja ziemlich schlecht ausfallen. Als das Spiel sich das erste mal öffnete die Auflösung quasi nicht vorhanden war und es abgesehen von 2 Lautstärkereglern keine Optionen gab. Verfestigte sich der Gedanke, dann bin ich allerdings in die Kampagne gestartet und musst feststellen das Spiel ist sogar per Sprachausgabe vertont was mich positiv überraschte. Die Tonausgabe hing sich allerdings öfters auch halb auf oder überlagerte sich wenn man zu schnell etwas gemacht hat. Die Steuerung ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig und man muss sich in das Spiel etwas rein fummeln. Fazit ist für einen Euro ist das Spiel gar nicht mal schlecht allerdings empfehle ich doch lieber andere Spiele mit ähnlichen Thema diese sind meist etwas besser.

Есть интересные задумки

Недостатки:
Недоработанная, баги

Поиграв в Game Dev Tycoon, я начал искать игры подобного жанра, и нашел лишь парочку таких, об одной из них я вам сейчас и расскажу.

В первую очередь стоит отметить не самую лучшую графику, но для меня она не столько важна лишь бы глаза не кровоточили важнее, чтобы игра была увлекательной, процесс должен доставлять удовольствие, а не мучить игрока. Сюжет, по своей сути, примитивный, но и такой может доставить огромнейшее удовольствие если его правильно подать.
И так начнем, в игре есть два режима - это ""Кампания"" и ""Бесконечная игра"". В ""Кампании"" есть десять заданий которые нужно выполнить, чтобы достичь цели в ""Бесконечной игра"" нет никаких заданий и цели особой тоже нет.
Начнем ""Кампанию"", нам предлагают выбрать одного из трех персонажей, которым мы будем играть, а так же логотип, уровень сложности и название нашей компании.

После этого нас ждет небольшое обучение, где нам говорят куда идти и что делать. Как взять кредит? Как создать игру? Ну и прочие подобные вопросы.

После этого нам нужно будет разработать движок для игры, нанять разработчиков, то есть людей которые будут делать эту самую игру, композиторов, дизайнеров, программистов.

После того как мы наймем нужных нам людей, идем в офис и начинаем проект, чем больше людей задействовано тем быстрее проект будет завершен.
После того как движок будет завершен нам нужно будет пойти в Медиа-парк и выбрать для себя контракт, то есть по сути выбрать жанр игры и срок за который нужно будет успеть сделать эту игру.

В принципе на этом игра и заканчивается, все потому что после разработки игры не понятно что делать, игра выставлена на продажу, но денег очень мало, непонятно что влияет на популярность того или иного жанра, нет конкурентов, то есть тут не с кем соревноваться даже с самим собой это трудно сделать, практически не возможно повлиять на продажи, на складе мертвых грузом лежат тысячи копий игр.
Совсем непонятно зачем нужен дом, можно купить машину, телевизор, картину и кое-какую мебель.

В итоге мы получаем совершенно сырую, непродуманную игру с какими-то интересными идеями, игру которой не хватило должной реализации, чтобы стать интересной, способной увлечь человека больше чем на 15-20 минут.

Well, ever had the urgent feeling of getting something done, that is really painful or annoying? No, then you never have even lived... and obviously this game also never had a real life - given the bad reviews. But are those reviews justified? Or are they just the entitled, dying screams of young and unknowledgable kids?

Actually I have to say, yes - those bad reviews are justified. The game crashes more often than you can actually achieve something in this game. Yes, this pretty much ruins the fun for a lot of people. Maybe it is because you have a too powerful machine on your side, or maybe it's just that the devs really have trouble with troubleshooting and debugging a game... Who knows.

However, to put the blame on the players - as it is often done by devs in recent years  is no good excuse for their own failures.

I won't put up a fancy table for this game, since I couldn't play one decent session without the game crashing again, and yet another time again - lucky that it doesn't really deep crash the system, so the taskmanager actually is your friend.

Game is barely playable, at least on Windows 10 I needed to enable Windows XP compatibility and even with that, game would crash from time to time during gameplay.

The in game english, even google translator could do better (Marry Xmas for the devs to!!!) and next time just use the same string for the type of game and licenses because sometimes  they are different and you can only match them by trial and error.

There are more popular, accessible and recent games in this genre that you would probably enjoy more.

-----

In the late 90's/early 2000s, there were some not-too-well-know games based around the entertainment industry.  Games like Hollywood Mogul, Chartwars, Bestseller, and Gamebiz: The Magical Years were not visually-driven games, instead were mostly text and menu-based games.  Game Tycoon shares a lot of similarities with Gamebiz, with a notable difference - it tries to add a visual aspect to the game.  

The biggest problem with the game is how unclear the steps are.  This is typical of this genre of game, and it doesn't take too much to figure out, although I see a lot of complaints about it.  There are some areas where the interface has issues, for instance, if you click on the publisher shelf, you are stuck with the contract.  There are some things, such as the game store, which are pretty much useless and should have been utilized more.  

So don't go into this game expecting too much.  It is basically database management with an incomplete facelift.",1500942090,1500942090,True,1,1,0.486260920763015747,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Но такого - никогда.
Как только зашел, я сразу понял что хуже некуда.
1) Экран 4:3
2) Нету настроек
3) Alt+Tab и Ctr+Alt+Delete тут вообще не работают
3.1) Ctr+Alt+Delete работает, но вы мало что сможете с ним сделать
4) Игра на англ. языке, большинство русских людей его мало понимают
5) На выбор всего 3 перса ( Мужик, Баба, Охранник )
6) Я так и не разобрался что тут нужно делать
7) У меня друг играл в эту ""игру"". Так вот, он повесился.
8) КТО ВООБЩЕ ЭТО СОЗДАВАЛ ?

Trying to cash-in on the success of the SIMS franchise, the tycoon phenomenon churned out everything from Roller coasters to Hospitals and everything in between, some hitting the spot (Roller-coaster Tycoon series) and some flopped like a dead fish (TV Tycoon any-one?). Unlike the SIM games which was wholly developed by Maxis and EA, anything labelled Tycoon was a developers free for all.

One of these Tycoon style games is Gamer Tycoon which comes from Sunlight Games (Originally released under Beat Games 2006). So you think you can make a radical game engine, that can make Frostbite Look like a snow puddle? Can you hit the shelves with a AAA Shooter that makes BF1 look like a Boy Scout Jamboree Simulator? Then crack your Knuckles and start Cobol your fingers silly, you dweeb!

ON THE MENU
Up front the game menu is simply yet pleasing with Champaign (Tutorial + set quests) and Endless (Sandbox) modes, three set characters to choose from (1 fm, 2 m) each with their own set of skills, Company name, choice of 8 company logos (you can edit/add your own outside of the game) three levels of difficulty, Sound and Music sliders and finally the mandatory Save, Load and Exit buttons. Sadly no video options which this game dose need, badly and no option for entering at any time period, you start smack bang in 1982 (thank god flared pants were on rapid decline by then!).

GAME PLAY
You choose your CEO Lydia, Kevin or Simon; logo, company name (Electronic A**holes) and choose champaign or endless. 

Let me stop you right here for a moment, I insist you read the manual on Steam and play the tutorial first before you do Endless, as the game is not, I repeat, it is not user friendly. Okay, continue.

You start in the office suburb, race off to the bank and grovel like Oliver Twist for a bit-o-dosh, race over to either the Licensing Broker (at the Media Park) and buy a one-off, off-the-shelf game engine or to your office and set out a plan to build your own reusable engine. 

You get a few options for what you want in your engine in regards to graphics, sound and how it is played but this list will grow and shrink as time and new technology comes into play. Then your off to the University suburb to find the best Self Flagellating, Art Deco, Emo Elmo money shouldn’t buy (offer them a nose ring and black eye shadow, and their yours for pittance). Back to the office suburb and into the employees building. A note, exiting any menu, building or Map is via rmb.

Here you assign the project (in this case the engine) and assign your programmer to emoji the crap out of it through x amount of de-caf till said engine is done. Then off to the Media Park and to the Licensing Broker to pick a gaming license that appeals to you, whether it be a RPG or sports game or a Platform adventure, you will only have a certain time and/or a certain quality rating your game must be, so pick wisely because this will come back and bite you in the bum, big time.

Now back to your office and build the plan for the game you want to make, again there are only a few options to start with but it will expand as you progress. Pick the machine you want it player on and what languages you want to translate to. Once the plan is done, race over to your employee building and watch your sole programmer become a pile of gibbering mess. Back to the Uni and hire more mindless Art Students (hope that that four eyed prick, Gates is not one of them).

Back to the office and assign them all. Wait for the coffee to run out and the programmers to finish. Grab the 8-bit tape (yes, a tape! That’s how most games started, thank Jobs we skipped the punch cards!).

Back to the Media park and to the Printing Company, pick what goodies you want to pack with the tape (a manual would be too kind to the un-washed), pick your print run, slap on the license you got earlier, set a price and sit back and wait for the money start rolling in…...In your dreams DWEEB!

IT WAS GOING SO WELL, THEN I OPENED THE BOX.
I made the above sound so good, well guess what, it’s not! Instead of making a great game, which this had so much going for it, Sunlight (Beat Games) created a Nightmare on Android Street. The tutorial is vague and hard to hear over sound effects (there is no caption text). None of the buildings are labelled so you have to guess which building is your office and which is the Printers!

If you accidentally click on the wrong license or if you do not read the fine print on the license contract, you can not undo it, you are stuck with it, suck eggs and die. Make a minor mistake of any kind and it is all over, red rover, even on easy and sandbox! This game is not forgiving in any way shape or form, it is out to make you rage-quit at the first chance it gets.

All menus and areas you exit via the RMB, except the Advertising office, if you RMB you crash the game, you must click “Bye”! Why the !FORTRAN! did some DinkC decide to NOT make this menu RMB to exit!!!! The game is glitched and has more bugs that a termite infestation.

IN THE END
If you can survive the harsh reality that Game Tycoon was hated from birth by its developers, not smash you PC against a wall, you might find a minuscule of decent game play here, believe me, it is there but can you take the punishment Sunlight Games dished out on this Tycoon game. Like Steve, this is dead, just bury it deep inside your drive, like Bill did with DOS in Windows.

Sunlight Games is an indie studio located in Cologne Germany. I would understand if you didn’t know about this little studio.  Their record of accomplishment is at best underwhelming and at worst, utter garbage.  You can check out their portfolio here.  There have been some successes, Gold Rush! Classic for example has a very positive 8 out of 10 on steam (according to 43 reviews).  Others however have received mixed reviews, such as Gold Rush! Anniversary and One Hundred Ways. 
The Game Tycoon series seems to be something of a cursed series.  Both being especially ill received for very similar problems; like the bugs, the translation errors (and oversights). Not to mention the boring gameplay.  You might remember the last time that I claimed it kept breaking in five minutes,  a fact that I still stand by as it happened multiple times.  However,  I did get a little further this time.  Not too far, mind you, because of the obtuse design and just running out of ideas. 

The time spent until breakage:

From moment one the problems mount up.  For a couple of days, I could not even get into the game, the resolution was messed up that I could not load it. It would arbitrarily start working again one day with no influence or change outside.  There is no options menu- like anywhere.  A gross oversight that becomes even more egregious when you realize that you are stuck with the game's bipolar whims.  When you try to select a campaign the game closes then reopens,  this time the music has vanished.   Half the tools don’t work for some reason,  like the character select screen,  which remains blank no matter how many times I tried to interact with it. 

There is something very unsettling about sound design and visuals. The bizarre silences between instructions, lack of music, and static imagery were unsettling to say the least.  It was a dream that could not decide if it wanted to become a nightmare, the jarring mundanity of boring game design and horrific existential horror of a plastic world where nothing is real except you. .  Do not get the wrong impression; Game Tycoon 1.5 is a very cheap and rushed project due to the abundance of selling/translation errors. None of what I mentioned is intentionally scary.",1499336661,1614286091,False,2,0,0.530666649341583252,0,False,True,False,False,,,

2,49 €

Veröffentlicht:
2003 und 2006

VERSION
1.5.15

GRAFIK
Im Cartoon-Stil gehalten. Völlig ausreichend.

SOUND
Hintergrundmusik nichts besonderes, aber auch nicht störend

BALANCE
Zwischen drei Schwierigkeitsgraden wählbar. Leicht ist sehr gut zu meistern, bei Mittel und Schwer ist gutes wirtschaften erforderlich.

ATMOSPHÄRE
Etwas zu leblos, kein ""Gewusel"" auf dem Bildschirm, was allerdings nicht entscheidend ist.

BEDIENUNG
Man bewegt sich mit der Spielfigur in verschiedenen Orten und Räumen. Stört vielleicht den ein oder anderen, mich aber nicht. Per Rechtsklick kommt man immer zurück. Ich habe allgmein keine Probleme mit der Steuerung.

UMFANG
Endlosspiel und 10 Missionen vorhanden, ebenso wie ein Tutorial, welches aber nicht den vollen Umfang des Spiels erklärt.

KI
Konkurrenz (nur 2 Mitbewerber) ist vorhanden; über Aktien können Anteile gekauft werden.

SPIELSPASS
Bei den Missionen hat man 10 verschiedene Spielzielen (z.B. Entwickle ein Spiel mit 75%-Wertung oder werde Millionär). Entsprechend den Missionen sind auch die Startbedingungen unterschiedlich (Startjahr, Startkapital). Egal ob die 10 Missionen oder das Endlosspiel, Ziel ist es natürlich mit der Spielentwicklung Geld zu verdienen. Man muss Mitarbeiter (selbständig oder fest angestellt) einstellen, eventuell Kredite bei der Bank aufnehmen, Lizensen ersteigern, eine Engine beim Notar erwerben oder diese selbst erstellen, Publisher-Verträge kaufen, das Firmenimage steigen, seine Spiele über Marketing pushen, diese selbst produzieren und kann dann im Gameshop die Rangliste anschauen oder am Kiosk den akuellen Trend und die Tests einsehen. Nebenbei darf man sein Privatvermögen in Form neuer Möbel, etc. steigern. Da Game Tycoon 1.5 eine Wirtschaftssimulation ist sollte man auch dementsprechend seine Entscheidungen gut durchdenken. Beispiel Mitarbeiter: Was es bedeutet einen festangestellten oder frei arbeiteten Mitarbeiter einzustellen sollte man also schon wissen. Wer also den Schwerpunkt gerne auf den wirtschaftlichen Aspekt legt und nicht aus ist schnell ein erfolgreiches Spiel nach dem anderen zu produzieren, ist hier genau richtig. Was nicht heißt, dass man keine erfolgreichen Spiele produzieren kann. Viele Faktoren hängen davon ab: Welche Mitarbeiter habe ich, welche Engine benutze ich, also wie aktuell ist diese, was lege ich dem Spiel bei der Produktion bei, habe ich eventuell eine Lizens, wie bekannt ist meine Firma usw. Der Aufbau der Spieleentwicklung und viele andere Punkte sind im Gegensatz zum zweiten Teil zwar deutlich schlanker, macht aber dennoch Spass.

BEWERTUNG

FAZIT
Vorweg: Das Spiel wurde im Jahr 2006, also vor GameDevTycoon, GamersGoMakers und MadGamesTycoon veröffentlicht. Sämtliche Vergleiche zu diesen Spielen sind also sowieso nicht möglich. Als Vergleich kann man sicher Software Tycoon nennen, allerdings habe ich das selbst nie gespielt, Game Tycoon 1.5 erinnert aber stark daran. Game Tycoon 1.5 ist ja das Vorgängerspiel von Game Tycoon 2 und hat somit den Schwerpunkt Wirtschaftssimulation und nicht Casual-Game. Wer hier also schnell man ein paar Spiele entwickeln will um das große Geld zu machen, ist bei Game Tycoon völlig falsch. Als eine solide Wirtschaftssimulation, bei der man nicht alles auf dem Silbertablett in Form einen Tutorials oder Hilfe bekommt, kann Game Tycoon punkten. Hat man keine Geduld oder keine Lust das Spiel kennen zu lernen, wird man auch nicht erfolgreich spielen können. Auf den Punkt gebracht: Ich mache nur Verlust oder meine Spiele bekommen keine gute Wertungen und bin gleich wieder Bankrott heißt ich mache als Spieler garantiert was falsch. Ist das Spiel jetzt gut? Ja, ist es. Game Tycoon ist eine solide Wirtschaftssimulation, kein Casual-Game-Tycoon, der nur dann Spass macht, wenn man den wirtschaftlichen Aspekt und den Prozess der Spieleentwicklung verstanden hat.

EMPFEHLUNG
Ja, da es derzeit unter 3 € zu haben ist.
Ja, wenn man Game Tycoon 2 noch nicht besitzt und dies als Einstieg nutzen will. Es ist folgerichtig dann einfacher Game Tycoon 2 zu verstehen.
Nein, wenn man Game Tycoon 2 schon besitzt und verstanden hat.
Nein, wenn man den Schwerpunkt der Wirtschaftssimulation nicht mag.

I'm exaggerating of course, but even for the 2003's standards (which is when the original version came out. That 2014 release date is just a plain lie, even not counting the original, the 1.5 was released in 2006,) this game is just archaic, on top of being terribly designed, with awful interface that resembles more of a hidden object game rather than a management simulation. Back in the day, there were more Tycoon games that made interfaces in such way, but they were usually better designed, accessible and comprehensible.
Even if you would leave aside the design and aesthetic aspects, this game is still a sloppy work. It's riddled with bugs, crashes constantly and while this one problem was already fixed, they have released this game without its .exe file.
Removing their names and leaving the blank page in the credits is probably the smartest thing they have done in regards to this whole mess.",1488042161,1488042314,False,5,2,0.595225751399993896,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The fact that it was originally shipped with no .exe file was a red flag, but I ignored that. How could I not want to try a game I literally got for free? I love these types of games, after all. What if I told you this game has one of the worst, most user-hostile User Interfaces I have EVER used in a game? I'm not being hyperbolic.

Game Tycoon has an interesting history. It was originally phyiscally released in 2006, to the dismay of critics. It was lauded for it's ambitions, but criticized heavily for it's execution. To quote PC Gamer, ""If desiging and producing games was really as boring as Game Tycoon makes it, we'd all be playing Zork."" A year after Game Dev Tycoon was released and garnered acclaim, Game Tycoon (now with a '1.5' in the title) mysteriously appeared on Steam. Now, I'm not implying that it's trying to rip-off Game Dev Tycoon... I'm just saying that that's incredibly fishy.

When I started up the game, my ears were treated to bland menu music. Nothing memorable, but it's not earbleed worthy. Since I don't typically don't find these games to have engaging soundtracks, I naturally turn off the music through the slider on the menu. I go to start a new game, the window closes, reappears, and the music is playing again. I tried this about 5 times, with the same result each time. I end up shrugging it off and starting the tutorial. The tutorial is vague at best, and operates on a 'theatre of the mind' scheme at worst. During the tutorial, I get lost and nearly think my game is broken. Nope, I just had to drag something into my inventory. The tutorial never mentions you have one and the UI is designed so poorly that I didn't know I had to drag the specified item into my inventory. I move on, finish the tutorial and start a new game.

Immediatley, I'm put into a point-n-click scenario where I need to click from building to building to do such important tasks as: buying a new engine, getting a loan, hiring people, and checking out the newest trends. This sounds interesting in theory, but what this essentially means is that you will spend lots of time going from place to place, doing tasks that could have easily been done in ONE place. It starts out as a nitpick but legit. gets annoying after less than half an hour of gameplay. I think I should also point out the voice acting is really bad from everyone. The music, in some areas, is horrendous and loops! To add insult to injury, there are less than a handful of songs in this game. It's truly bad.

On somewhat of a postive note, the visuals are stylistic, and aren't MS Paint-Nutshack levels of god awful. They still haven't aged well and look like  shit , but they don't look like fucking  shit , so that's a plus. 

The process of getting a game made in this game is confusing, cumbersome and the antithesis of what anyone would consider 'fun'. I honestly can't describe it in full. It's something you have to suffer through to fully understand. Essentially, what it boils down to is going to lots of places to get ready, meddling around in the mind boggling UI, clicking all over the screen with the selected inventory item to get the desired result, and praying that the painkillers will kick in soon. What takes only a few minutes in a competently made tycoon game can take up to 10-20 minutes here, with most of that time being unengaging. Again, I can't exactly describe how poorly executed this is, it's just something that has to be experienced.

Finally, there's the supposed ""realism"" in this game. This game wants to be realistic, but in it's attempts, the areas that aren't even close to realistic stick out like a sore thumb growing out of an already sore thumb. For one, a 'warehouse' is just a lazzily cobbled together image of a bunch of game cases stacked on top of each other. For another thing, you can apply for a large loan and barely have it hurt you. Also, the printing machine has options that weren't available until decades in the future - something the game is willing to point out, but too lazy to fix. Then, there's the fact that when you start out, there are game magizines full of... nothing. Why would gaming magizines exist if games do not yet exist? In what universe does that octopus logic apply? Why?

Pros:
+An alright art style?

Cons:
-Uninituitive, hostile UI
-Vague (at best) tutorial
-Terrible voice acting
-Terrible music
-Not as realistic as it wants to be
-The main gimmick of the game - making games - is a total slog that's too time consuming for it's own good

Кстати 1.5, потому что это слегка (то бишь нифига) не улучшенная версия первой части, вышедшей также у нас году в 2005-2006 под названием Фабрика развлечений (оригинал вышел в 2003).

Основной и главный минус этой игры в том, что она сделана не очень хорошо в техническом плане и обладает не самым дружелюбным интерфейсом. Начнем с того что при нажатии кнопки новая кампания, игра каждый раз перезагружается для запуска кампании, то есть буквально окошко игры сворачивается как при новом запуске игры, это несколько раздражает когда хочется перепройти какой-то уровень. Уровней всего 10, не считая нудного обучения, и режима бесконечной игры.

Далее, в обычных бизнес-симуляторах мы имеем несколько окошек менеджмента в которых можно производить нужные операции. Здесь же нужно в одной локации зайти в банк-прослушать повторяющуся тираду ""Вы хотите взять кредить?"", которую нельзя пропустить-получить кредит-выйти из банка (причем выход из локации это правая кнопка мыши, а не esc)- зайти в здании-выбрать компьютер-выбрать характеристики движка-выйти из локации-войти в университет-нанять программистов-выйти из локации-войти в офисы-распределить программистов-...и так далее вплоть до печати тиража игры и рекламы. То есть вместо 2-3 кликов для нужной операции приходится делать десяток лишних переходов. 

В игре можно выбрать одного из 3 персонажей и обустроить дом, ролевая составляющая здесь сделана слабо и явно для галочки, ибо практически ни на что не влияет. Есть средняя озвучка на английском, чуть лучше на немецком, диалоги - каждый раз одинаковые, прокрутить их нельзя и приходится их терпеливо выслушивать. Графика в игре такая как и была в 2000 годы, и то выглядит мягко говоря не очень, даже имхо по тем меркам.

Как итог: единственный плюс игры в том что можно почитать про фичи и особенности игр с 1982 по наше время (эти пункты мы выбираем при создании движков и игр), но при этом сама игра вышла перегруженной и неудобоваримой. И в этом есть определенная ирония, когда разрабы создают кривую игру про создании игровой империи. Зато есть карточки, впрочем как всегда в плохих проектах, увы.

29 августа 2013 года, в стиме выходит симулятор разработчика игр, очень популярный идни проект game dev tycoon. Игра набрала множество положительных отзывов и от критиков, и от обычных пользователей. Но мало кто знает, что это не первая игра о разработке игр, ведь десять лет назад, в 2003 году немецкие разработчики создают Game Tycoon, позже, на волне популярности Game Dev Tycoon, они решаются переиздать свою игру в стиме, ничего не изменив, назвать ее Game Tycoon 1.5.

Обычный игрок, которому понравилась Game Dev Tycoon, захочет попробовать другие игры этого жанра. Наткнувшись на игру, вроде бы разработанную в 2014 году (так пишет Стим) наивный человек сильно разочаруется. Графически, геймплейно, интерфейсно игра осталась в 2003 году, даже дешевая цена в 80 рублей ее не спасает. Если в 2003 году от нее можно было получить удовольствие, в то время выбора в этом жанре не было вообще, то сейчас лучше пройти мимо данного проекта.

В целом, стоит отдать игре должное, это действительно родоначальник жанра симулятора разработчика игр. Если в Game Dev Tycoon упор делался на сопоставлении жанра с темой игры, выборе разработчиков и дизайнеров на проект, то в Game Tycoon 1.5 основную роль играет сохранение капитала и получение прибыли. Очень сложно в этой игре не стать банкротом, так что тут гораздо меньше времени уделяется самому процессу разработки видеоигр. Не ведитесь на дату в стиме, игра устарела и актуальной была лишь в 2003 году.",1471092927,1471093039,False,7,1,0.537767231464385986,3,False,True,False,False,,,

Все зникає після першого використання і все доводиться робити спочатку. Нудно також пересуватися між потрібними робочими місцями. Не видно логіки між жанрами, популярністю та продажем. Я створив гру на найкрощому рушії на той момент, загальний рейтинг якості був високим. Але не зміг продати жодної копії, бо чомусь ШІ гри вирішив, що створена гра недостатньо хороша, щоб вийти на продаж. Про що мене і повідомив. Яка різниця щодо якості, коли вирішують покупці? Ні реклама, ні рушій, ні десятки найнятих невідомих програмістів в один офіс з трьома ПК не допомогли. Та тут грі в цілому потрібно допомогти, щось робити з ігроладом.

Керування елементарне, але налаштувань практично ніяких не представлено. Української локалізації немає. Анімацій немає. Логіки немає. Ігроладу майже немає.

Що треба робити? Береш кредит, наймаєш кілька ""рядочків з іменами"", створюєш ""проект"", де лише потрібно поставити кілька позначок біля пропозицій, ставиш ""рядочки з іменами"" на ""проект"". Звісно все називаєш. Чекаєш. Потім думаєш, нащо це робив. Ні, звісно, щоб заробити грошей, заплатити кредит та почати все з початку. Але з таким виконанням чомусь не хочеться.

¿En serio estás pensando en gastarte 2.49€ en esta aberración? Se me ocurre algo mejor, cierra Steam ahora mismo, túmbate en la cama y reflexiona. Eso o échale un ojo a las ofertas semanales de Steam donde, si buscas un poco, encuentras cosas mucho mejores por menos dinero. Esta semana está Terrorhedron por 0.24€, Super Trench Attack por 0.49€ y Plantera por 1.73€ (2.46€ en total). Aunque siempre puedes comprar este juego y, a la media hora, volver aquí y darme la razón, pero ya será demasiado tarde. Es tú decisión.

VERSIÓN AMPLIADA:
Me gustaría empezar diciendo que esto no es Game Dev Tycoon. Repito, no es Game Dev Tycoon.

Supongo que, en parte, pretendería ser algo similar pero con más opciones. Pero, sinceramente, no se aproxima en absoluto a la joyita de Greenheart Games.
Me atrevería a decir que en la sencillez de dicho juego reside su abrumador éxito (al menos en cuanto a crítica). Pero es que en este juego creo que han pecado de querer introducir demasiadas cosas y les ha acabado pasando factura.

Así que sin más comparaciones, paso a describir mi experiencia con este juego (o lo que quiera que sea esto):
- Al jugarlo en pantalla completa, mi monitor se ha vuelto loco hasta que me ha saltado un error y ha crasheado el juego. Vamos, lo que es empezar con buen pie.
- El tutorial. Madre mía, tienes un tío hablando y explicándote lo que tienes que hacer. Sin textos, solo con sonido. En inglés. Si lo entiendes, bien, si no lo haces te lo repetirá una y otra vez hasta que, por casualidad, aciertes. Creo que haberlo hecho todo con textos en vez de con voces hubiera sido una decisión mejor.
- El personaje. Manejamos a un muñeco que se mueve de una forma muy rara, con unas animaciones horribles. Tienes que ir moviéndote por un mapa de 4 localizaciones para pedir préstamos, contratar gente, crear copias de tus juegos, etc. La idea está bien, pero se podrían haber ahorrado lo de ir moviendo al muñeco. Con poner un menú con los lugares y punto habría sido suficiente.
- La dificultad. El punto anterior lo hace todo demasiado complicado (en cuanto a tiempo a invertir, al menos). Pedir dinero al banco, crear un motor gráfico, contratar gente, escoger un contrato, crear el juego, crear copias, y hasta ahí he sido capaz de llegar. Lo sé, todo esto había que hacerlo en el anteriormente mencionado Game Dev Tycoon, pero era tan fácil y rápido que en menos de un minuto estabas creando el juego. Y entiendo la intención de darle ese realismo de creador de videojuegos novato (sobre todo con lo de crear las copias a mano), pero la ejecución es realmente desastrosa.

En conclusión, una idea para nada mala ejecutada de la peor manera posible. Viendo las críticas de Game Tycoon 2 parece que han mejorado algo, aunque no sé si lo suficiente.

No merece la pena pagar por él, ni tampoco merece la pena obteniendo una key de manera gratuíta. Pero al menos tiene cromos, factor importante para una gran parte de los jugadores de Steam, así que tocará dejarlo en segundo plano hasta que obtenga dichos cromos. Luego, lo desintalaré y borraré el juego de mi cuenta. O algo así.",1470768308,1470783371,False,16,3,0.699109733104705811,0,False,True,False,False,,,

[u]Worum geht es in Game Tycoon 1.5?[/u]
Ich denke es geht darum, dass man seine eigenen Spiele entwickelt. Dies tut man indem man sie programmiert und dann durch die Stadt(?) rennt und dann da Grafiken macht und dort prouziert und irgendwo verkauft.

[u]Positive Aspekte[/u]
Die allgemeine Idee vom Spiel ist nett.

[u]Negative Aspekte[/u]
Es ist alt und so sieht es auch aus. Es ist unmenschlich zu spielen. Entweder bin ich zu kacke oder was weiß ich, aber ich habe nie ein Spiel verkauft (:c).

While Sunlight Games certainly had the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of interest in the genre in more recent years and fix the game, playing Game Tycoon 1.5 is a frustrating experience and one has to wonder why Sunlight Games did not simply start from scratch.

The visual aspects of the game fluctuate between ""passable for a low-budget PC game developed a decade ago"" and downright laughable. In some parts of the game, text is pre-rendered as graphics. In other parts of the game, text consists of blue Times New Roman on a white screen. Think hyperlinks on the most basic webpages out of the early 2000s. The music is similar; some is passable, but some borders on the absurd. One track of the game is a six-second loop, but it doesn't loop properly. There is a delay between each loop, breaking any possible sense of immersion. It's like a bad Vine.

The functionality is, of course, entirely broken. A tooltip will demand that you name your engine even after a name is provided. Buttons and boxes will not work, and progressing in the game requires a lot of rebooting, backing out of menu and, perhaps for some, copious amounts of praying. Easily, however, the worst aspect of this game is its ridiculous mechanics. There are many different actions that the player may take to fund or advertise their game, develop it, recruit staff and so on, more, than one might even expect from a low-budget game. Unfortunately, most time spent in this game will consist of your character walking between the advertising agencies, the university, the bank and so on because yes, that is how this game is played. You do not navigate menus, you walk slowly in a psuedo-3D world in order to get to where you need to go. It is tedious and, miraculously, it manages to be worse than any escort mission because it serves zero purpose.

I know of four games in the game-building genre and this, as a game that isn't even in early access, is by far the worst. Your other options include Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon on the PC and Game Dev Story (personal favorite) on mobile devices. All of these games look, sound and play better than Game Tycoon 1.5, and you would be far better off to save yourself from the circle of hell that is Game Tycoon 1.5.

This is a game about making other games. The same concept as Game Dev Tycoon. Before I go on I just want to say that you should get that game instead as it does a MUCH better job.

Cons:
- Extremely slow gameplay.
- Quite buggy.
- Tutorial isn't informative enough.
- The game is really hard to learn without a proper tutorial.
- At launch the .exe file wasn't there so the game wouldn't launch (says a little about the game quality as well as Steam's quality checks).
- No proper options-screen (although your computer should be able to run it considering the horrible graphics).
- Not sure about this one, but I'm pretty sure it's just an old game that's been put up on Steam. I think I read that some places.

Now to the pros:
- There are none

In full-screen mode, whenever you change windows, the game blinks to the desktop to show you a loading bar, then goes back into the game with the new menu.  There is no useful information in the game, tutorial or otherwise, to get you started.  The audio always works fine, but sometimes the voices seem to work, while other times they don't.  However, if you take the time to watch someone who has learned this game play it on Youtube, I think you will enjoy this game for a while.

I watched someone else play, was reminded instantly of MAD TV (an old German DOS game where you run a television station in a similar fashion), then bought the game in a bundle.  It is similar to MAD TV in a few ways.  You run your character around various places to draft ideas for games, hire workers (programmers, artists, composers), buy engines until you can afford to make your own, produce the game, then get a publishing contract, and finally ship the game to stores.  There's even a store you can enter to check the top 10 selling video games, until your game stops making money, where you then can try to sell it or throw it away.  There's an auction to get license for real movies and other popular brands (I had a spoof of Indiana Jones that sold well, but also cost me a lot).  There is enough going on in this game at any given point to where you get in this loop of design, produce, sell, and it might take you a restart or two, but with a little trial and error, you can be successful.

Overall, this game is definitely a lower budget title, and it shows.  I would've liked to see a bit more, such as gaming conventions like in Game Dev Tycoon, or even awards that your game could win from reviewers.  But like MAD TV, once you learn the ropes of the game, and finally avoid going bankrupt on your budgets, it's a pretty solid simulator.  Nothing special, but it's definitely entertaining for a couple of hours at least.",1427437821,1427437821,True,1,1,0.260675162076950073,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The premise of the gameplay is simple. To be the best game tycoon. This is a simulator game, so some semblance to the facts are expected.

[h1]Tutorial[/h1]
The tutorial is spoken, there is no subtitle, and there is no explanation on what should be done. For example : You are told to borrow $100k from the bank, but you are not told where the bank is and how to even sign the paper. You are told to manage your developer, and you are not told where is your developer office (turns out, the development office is separate from your personal office). In short, the tutorial is not helpful at all.

[h1]The UI[/h1]
The UI is very bad. There is no tooltips at all. If you hover over something, there won't be any explanation. As UI is related to how information is given out to you, this game is also very bad at that. To access your game quality, you have to go to a certain object. To access your sales number, you have to click on some paper on your table. To access your financial report, you have to click on another paper on your table. There is no collated financial reports, no collated engine/game reports. Some reports have to be accessed outside your personal office, which you must travel to other place just to get a piece of report.

The notion of personal office looks like Airline Tycoon Deluxe, which are a great game. In Airline Tycoon, there are tooltips so that we know what we are going to click. To access the incoming message, just click on the paper organizer in your office. To access your plane facilities, click on the plane model. To access the fuel price and setting, click on the fuel painting on the wall. To access your route, click on the globe. To access your financial report, just a click away. This is very different with Game Tycoon 1.5.

Game Tycoon 1.5 fails to present the information needed with a good manner, information is fragmented. For tycoon games failure to present information is very bad, as those information are the key to success in these kind of games.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay is horrid. 

[b]There are no clear explanation.[/b]
What is the differences between Keyboard controller and Joystick? Japanese language and English language? No explanation at all. 

[b]The game is too complex.[/b]
Not complex in a good manner. To build a game, you have to create an engine. During the creation of engine, you have to enter the features (like Game Dev Tycoon) though it's unclear which features is better than the others. During the creation of engine you are also able to set how many developers are going to develop the engine. Next, you have to print it and it is stored at your inventory. After that, you have to go to the university, and grab some developers.

After that, you have to go to the developers office (beside your office, they have darts targeting your character) and assign programmers to the project. No problem on this part.
After that, you develop the game, same thing, you have the game ""cassette"" on your inventory. Then, you have to go to design factory to define how much gimmicks you wanted. Then you go to factory to print out your product. Then to licensing to find a publisher. Then to factory again to sell the game.

The process is believable, but presented in such clunky manner that you will be confused in no time. While a good game will present all of those above steps in a UI that have drop-down menus, this game is not. As outlined above, because information is too fragmented. For example : After printing out your product, you go to publisher. The publisher demands your game have a specific rating. If you have printed your game, you can't know the rating anymore, the rating is known only after the game is developed. These kind of thing is very bad, information should be able to be accessed at all times!

[b]No feedback[/b]
While the Game Dev Tycoon provides feedback to the player by giving out review scores, this game did not give any. Review scores are important to give us facts how good is our product. But no dice, no feedback, no nothing. In tycoon games it is important to have feedback. For example, if we are told that our sales drop in such areas, we should know the cause. Bad product? Bad pricing? Bad sales? We must have information. This game lacks those, so the players could not make informed decisions to make something.

[b]Bad Game Structure[/b]
No menus. Simply horrid. You can't access functions inside the game, you have to go out to main menu to get that. You can't go to settings, you have to go to main menu to access settings. Not to mention that the game will drop to desktop for a few second if you go to main menu. That is simply unacceptable.

[h1]Look and Feel[/h1]
Simply lacking. The game has some quality in drawing, but very lacking in other aspects. The music is bad. 
 
[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I got this game from a bundle, so it is not a bad loss to me.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.
I think this game is the Big Rigs of tycoon genre.

The gameplay is centered upon developing a game in a specific genre and hitting a specific percentage point to satisfy the publisher.   No real way to improve quality if you don't hit the mark.   Never take a publishing contract unless you are certain you'll exceed the expectations.   

No subtitles!    I usually play with the sound off.   So there were many critical parts of the game where it was impossible to continue without audio instruction.

My biggest complaint is that it seems unfinished. It's glitchy, it's not intuitive, and even on easy it's hard as heck to get anywhere with it.

This game was apparently released in February 2014, but the laughable 3D graphics would not be out of place in a game fifteen years older. Upon starting the game, you are given a choice of three avatars to choose from, with no customisation whatsoever. After this sequence, and some terrible wooden voice-acting, you are whisked away to a street where you are told to make your avatar walk painfully slowly to your office. And no, there is no way to speed this up.

The game tells you to create a game engine, then gives you almost no advice on how to do so, which leads to lot of trial-and-error clicking in the laughably rough looking interface which looks like something knocked together in 30 seconds on Photoshop. You are then told to walk down the street to the bank, where you borrow money (ask for whatever you like, and the clerk simply hands it over), and then it's off to the ""university"" to hire some staff (in reality just a hanging noticeboard where you click on people's names). Returning to your office, you click once more through the interface to assign your newly hired staff to work on your engine project. You then wait...and wait...and wait. Turns out that there's no way to speed this up, and there's nothing else to do but stare at the inside of your blocky 3D office.

At this point, I turned the game off, so I don't know if your hardworking crew eer do finish working on that engine in order for you to start working on your game proper. The final irony is that a game supposedly all about making your own games is a terrible game in itself with no thought for it's audience. Who were they aiming for with this game? Game makers themselves? Masochists? Poor saps not realising that they'd bought the wrong game with a similar sounding title and not realising it until it was too late?

On top of its aforementioned problems, there are other glaring flaws; screens untranslated from their original German, and some garbled English phrases that look like they've been through the wringer that is Google Translate. It feels like a game that not only isn't finished, but that's been slapped together with little care or thought, leaving an absolute travesty of a game that should not have been released.

Nothing is laid out with menus, its all places and locations. You have a university, office plaza, media plaza and your home (which seems pointless). In these locations they are like city streets, you need to scroll your mouse left and right and click on doors. One click will have your player character enter, two clicks will automatically enter. When inside a building, you see a room and need to find what you want to do. It makes the controls needlessly cumbersome. To see how many copies you have in stock, you need to go across town. To see your finances, you need to go back across town. It is crazy.

The game is very click base as if it could be a mobile game, you won't find hot keys or even menus. Right mouse clicking exits you out of an area. Stats and charts need to be found in rooms and areas. Even then, there's no depth. There is no way to see how well games are selling, you just need to hope they sell well that month at the price you've set. You can visit a university magazine stand to find out the most popular games and genres for $4 each time. You can visit a game store in the media plaza to see where your games rank. You can visit an advertising executive to publicize your games, your company and see how you stack compared to the two other companies you're competing against. You can even visit a banker, take out a loan, buy and sell stocks of your company and the other three. Those are nice features, but when you visit the banker and executive, you need to talk with them. Click something to say and listen for them to say it before you can continue. If you dare click on something else it could cause a glitch that will loop the speech if not crash a menu 10 seconds later. It is stunning.

When you play, there is no hand holding. I needed to figure out to visit my office, create a game engine (or license one), then click and drag the 'print out' into my inventory. Then go next door to the development office? Once there, I need to click and drag the 'print out' into the project list. After that, since I had no employees, I had to go to the university and figure out that I needed to click a bulletin board in order to find employees. The hiring system is nice, it shows you the quality in stars, and their tempo to complete the job. You hire programmers, artists and composers. Some you can hire and others that are independent. So they can get better jobs and come back to you when you need them most, but they don't get paid when they're not working. Then its back to the development studio with my employees. I need to click the project, then assign programmers to the engine and click start project.

After you wait a few in game days, weeks or months, its time to take that game engine project, click and drag it back into your inventory, then go next door to your office and make a new game after clicking and dragging the engine into the proper position. Creating a new game project is easy. You'll get to chose things like what languages and what platforms. By platforms I mean, PC, arcade and console. There are no specific consoles. Just those three. Then when that is all 'printed out,' its back over to next door to click and drag the 'print out' from my inventory into the project window. Once there, I need to click on the project, then sift through my employees to assign programmers, artists and composers. The more people I have working, the faster they'll get done. The higher quality they are, the better the game.

From there, you don't just release the game. Once you click and drag the finished project into your inventory of course. Its off to the manufacturing facility where you click on the design table to include everything that will come with your game. By design, I mean pack the box with stuff and raise the manufacturing cost. Shirts, buttons, stickers, black and white instruction manuals, color instructions, an insert. Its all up to you! With some click and dragging. With that done you'll visit the manufacturing machine that will churn out the copies of your game. The more copies, the cheaper they become to manufacture. Click and drag the finished product into the machine. Then start manufacturing! After a few game days, all of the copies will arrive.

Do they just sell themselves? Nope. Time to find a publisher! So you need to visit a publisher's office and select a publishing deal from books on the wall. They all have minimum quality ratings, so your 45% quality game can't be published with a 53% quality deal. There is a punishment for failing to release the game by the allowed time and for your trouble of making a game, you'll get 6% of the profits depending on the deal. Some deals are far better than others.

After that, its back to the factory that has your copies. You need to click on the pallet with the finished copies and click and drag your publishing deal from your inventory into the game's slot and flip the checkmark switch to officially release it! Wasn't that easy? No hand holding at all!

Of course 5 hours into the game, I finally discovered the tutorial was in the campaign, but wasn't marked as a 'tutorial.' I thought it was just another scenario in the campaign. The tutorial explains what to do, but it gets caught on itself and could explain things better, such as flipping through a gaming magazine had me clicking all over before I figured out to click a game title. The voice over will talk over other voice overs. Not just that, but if you go to a different location than you should be in, the tutorial narration will tell you what to do as if you're in the correct place, instead of saying no this is the office, go to the university.

As soon as you get the hang of the 1,000 step process, it becomes an insane juggle of going between locations since there is no menu. Waiting to pan the street to the right or left. Waiting for your character to walk to the building before you realize double clicking enters the door instantly. Even though there's a game speed, that doesn't speed up the character. It doesn't speed up every time I need to hear 'I would like a bank loan,' then hear the banker's rebuttal.

There are visual errors here like text not disappearing when the dialog boxes do. Text overlapping out of windows. Sometimes the ticker PDA doesn't show anything when it should have a message. The PDA (ticker) is nice, it pops up useless information like you need to pay $3,000 for golf clubs or you're having a bad hair day. Its all random things that might as well be Chance cards from Monopoly. The PDA pop up changes the game from fast to slow, which is good, but the problem is that a lot of what the PDA shows is useless moments to make you laugh. You didn't sleep well, because your bed broke. Stealing MP3s is bad. Visit the gametycoon website. Your employees will get sick and will be unable to work for 12 days.

The only way to get a game over is if you go into debt for more than 90 days. You can get loans and sell stock to stay a float, but even on normal, it seems difficult. Your games only make money at the start of every month. You have full control over the price of your games at the factory, but to put publicity into the games, you need to go to a different area down the street.

The game itself is difficult even on normal. Luckily there is an easy mode. To top everything off, it has crashed or permafroze a few times, so you'll need to keep saving frequently, since there is no auto save feature. With all of that being said, there are some interesting elements in the game, but the juggle and struggle of going location to location over and over again is unfun and begging people to not play it. If only there was a menu and no traveling.

Mettiamola così: l'idea di fondo non è male.

Non so se rendo l'idea, ma sono disposto a tollerare un sacco di cose.

Ho tollerato Duke Nukem Forever perchè faceva ridere, nonostante fosse un titolo tutt'altro che al passo con i tempi, e se l'è cavata con la sincera dichiarazione ""Che vi aspettate? È DNF, io non mi aspetterei molto più che porcate e sparatorie"" che, per avermi fatto aspettare 12 anni, è stata anche troppo lusinghiera. Ho tollerato Daikatana, Final Fantasy XII, Sonic 3D Blast, la presenza della Wii in casa mia - non di certo una mia idea - e tante altre cose.

So basicly I am saying this game, true to its name is, to at least me, saying that it is a Company trying to be the best business out there..and for those of you that really understand how business works, lets just say it really doesn't matter what you are selling, what it is really about is profit and the benifits you can buy with it once you make more and more of it. I would recommend this game more for mature, oldskewl gamer types. Sometimes its not about the graphics or the gameplay..sometimes its about figuring out how to not be a noob, intil one day you look back and laugh at yourself with great achivement and humility, because you overcame so many of your mistakes. That to me is a real game, pff you kids today are so spoiled with your save points every 10 feet..there used to be a time where one tiny tiny mistake made you completely restart hours and hours of progress. 

ANYWAY LOL...a few hints for those of you that read all this ribble-rabble. *****HINTS****get a max loan..make any game quick and cheap doesnt matter just get it out into the market and advertise your image alittle. doing this will raise your stock % from a crap share to a few dollars, trust me its a HUGE difference if you have say 1000000 shares... just saying any way once you get like 2-6$ a share sell it all and get a few million in the bank, pay back your loan and SHAZAM! you have just earnd better credit, dont worry you can just make a ""erotic game"" genre to lower your image a.k.a your stock value and just rebuy it at .01 a share just after you sold all of it for 5$ a share LOL and you can rebuild it again and again, trust me this game is uber fun and easy once you get the hang of it, so trolls, go play cod or something and leave the indie games to the professionals :P THANKS FOR READING IF YOU DID,KUZURNOTA-L7WEINER ;D",1398300507,1398300507,True,16,3,0.410845041275024414,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Frankly, it's hard to navigate through and the character moves at a snails' pace, it's a struggle to even publish your first game, let alone build a gaming empire! And let's not talk about the sound issues. In the factory, for example, the machinery sounds drown out the tutorial. Okay, great. At least going to the save menu and back gets rid of the sounds for you. Oh, and the voices are bundled in with general sounds so there's no easy 'turn down sounds to hear voices' option either.

In part, to counter many of the negative reviews that don't give the game the credit it deserves, but also to give an honest perspective.

To start with, let me say that it doesn't necessarily deserve the negative feedback that it's getting. The problem here, that I see, is that some are experiencing issues with the game and the software tutorial itself doesn't give a whole lot of help to resolve it. That said, there are some issues that deserve mentioning and some interesting features that also deserve a few words.

Graphically, the game is pretty nice and certainly well laid out. There are different areas to head to for specific intentions and it works well. The controls are well thought out and it's effortless to shift between each area. Use of the right mouse button to transition between areas is an boon - since many of this sort of game neglect the use of said button. The music, too, isn't too annoying and blends nicely in the background, with an easy to find method of turning it off and on. It's smooth and not too demanding on modern systems (meaning pretty much any system from the last 5-8 years) but that's to be expected in an older title. 

The game itself seems to borrow some ideas from other games, which isn't unheard of. There's a few places where I immediately thought of Airline Tycoon/AT: First class. Again, not a bad thing but hardly innovative either. There's lots of clickables in the world, though there's no real explaination of what they do, if anything and I did notice on the official forums/website for the game that there's very limited support for English speaking individuals, whereas there's a wealth of support for German speakers. Hardly the end of the world, but considering the planet is more English speaking than German, maybe something to look at down the line.

On to the negatives.

To start with, I have to make mention of the lack of subtitles. Many of the spoken lines can be hard to hear through any form of background music, be it ingame or otherwise and with no means to read that spoken word, rather than listen to it, it's a little annoying.

Also, the method the game uses to publish your titles. You have to have a contract with a publisher - there's no method of self-publishing (at least, not as far as I got - which was into the early 90s) and promotion of your titles doesn't really seem to fit. This is one of the game-killers for me. I can earn money - make some top notch games but without a method of publishing, I'm limited to the contracts on offer and that, to me, makes little sense. If you're sitting on a few million and you have the means to buy a publishing company, you would if it was financially viable.

Also, there's a lack of polishing to this game and, again, I recognise that the game is ancient in PC gaming standards ( 8 years or so). Nevertheless, a little extra work could have made the game more enjoyable. There's a great start here, but it needs more, especially as the tycoon market seems to be pickiing up again and competition is starting to hit the shelves again (Game Dev Tycoon immediately comes to mind).

Speaking of which. Another of the features this game is really missing is R+D and this is something that goes right back to the dawn of computer gaming. Without R+D, there would be no innovation, nothing to set the big companies aside from the little. Also, when you take over a competitor, it would be nice if you could keep the name and use it for, say, publishing or research or whatever else your mind fancies, rather than the name disappearing. There's little to stop you from taking over and becoming an umberella company that publishes games from your child-companies. 

The game, on the whole, is good, though it has little replay value because it ends up being a chore to rinse, lather, repeat. Adding more staff options would help and delegating some of the more mundane tasks to AI workers would allow you to manage the areas you want to, without having to keep doing the same thing over and over. 

All in all, if you're looking for a distraction and want a few hours of game play here and there, it's worth the investment. It's the sort of game I, personally, would keep going back to while deciding what main project I want to start (Mount fo Blade, Tropico 4, whatever) and it has some value there. However, if you want something more meaningful, either look at Game Dev Tycoon (also an indie title and a demo is available) or wait and see what happens with Game Tycoon 2.",1398092925,1398092925,True,28,6,0.508647918701171875,2,True,False,False,False,,,

First of all, the name is not a good representation of the game. The ""game design"" parts are basically nonexistent and it's mostly about walking from one screen to the other, so the UI has nothing to do with tycoon-type games. Instead, you are putting engines and games you've forced students to produce into your inventory, so you can print them up and hope it works. The rating system is almost impossible to spot the first time around, and it has no depth what so ever once you do.

Also, there are no subtitles. Yes, you heard me; no subtitles. This may not sound too bad, but then again you haven't experienced what I have. I had to listen to one of the tutorial missions' same line 15 times (because, if you are not doing what you're told - like entering one of the many indistinguishable buildings - the tutorial voice will repeat the same command in 10 second intervals). Why? Well, the terribly EQ'd voice had already nagged me into going to a warehouse, where a printing machine is a part of the background sound template. It was impossible to hear anything the tutorial said - and, to top it off, this is the same source in the customizable mixer in the option menu.

The purpose of the game is to fulfill 'goals'
But these goals don't seem to add up to creating a successful business. Even if it did, due to bugs in the game it's impossible to create a successful business from it.
For instance, if you create and publish a game and sell every copy of that game that you can create at an enormous profit, you don't actually get a penny of it.
Essentially, the ONLY income you can get in the game is to take out a loan from the bank. And when you run low on funds you have to take out another loan and another and another and another. This makes it rather broken from a business sim perspective.
Additional issues include not being able to publish a game unless the randomly generated publishing contracts fulfill the merits of a game. So you can create a game and not be able to publish it for months and months. Not that it matters since you can't earn off it anyway.

Basically, this is NOT Game Dev Tycoon, which is what you probably wanted to buy but the title of this tricked you into looking here. If you haven't paid a penny for it already, DON'T!

Ich habe mir den Titel gekauft, da ich sowohl auf Android Game Dev Story, als auch hier auf dem PC Game Dev. Tycoon gekauft und mit viel Freude gespielt habe.

Ich hatte gehofft, dass dieses Spiel ähnlich gut und motivierend ist, aber es ist ein totaler Reinfall.

Angefangen beim Tutorial, wo man UNBEDINGT die Boxen anmachen muss, da es keine Untertitel gibt, der Sprecher spricht langweilig und leise, die Hintergrundmusik versetzt einen bereits früh am Morgen wieder in den Tiefschlaf. Dazu kommt, dass sich die Sprecher überschneiden - sollte man etwas anderes erledigen (z.B. Kredit aufnehmen) während das Tutorial einem etwas vorlabert dann sprechen 2 Leute gleichzeitig. Die Animationen des eigenen Spielers hätte man lieber weglassen sollen,  dadurch scheinen die Entwickler das Spiel in die Länge gezogen haben zu wollen, was aber total stört irgendwo herum zu laufen, was in diesem Spiel echt albern und nicht schön ist.
Weiter zum Tutorial: es wird einem erzählt man soll zu Ort X gehen, diesen findet man aber als Neuling nicht, da er in wirklichkeit anders heißt - bei einigen Orten kann man es noch nachvollziehen - andere muss man widerum raten.
Im Tutorial programmiert man ein Spiel, wunder bar aber was nun worauf welchen Einfluss hat bleibt bis zum Ende des Spieles (vermutlich, soweit werde ich nie kommen) verborgen. Welche Auswirkungen haben Extras wie ein farbiges Handbuch, oder Sticker, oder oder oder. 

Nun denn, wenn man dann sich durch das Tutorial durchgeklickt hat fängt das wahre Übel an. Man programmiert Spiele mit (sofern man gutes Personal einstellt) mit den höchsten Qualitäts-Merkmalen, alle Balken sind auf VOLL, was bringt das? nichts - man geht pleite... Die Spiele werden kein überrenner, wobei die Konkurrenz allem Anschein nach grottenschlechte (mit  diesem vergleichbar) Spiele im Monatstakt entwickelt und diese die totalen Kassenschlager werden. 

Warum bekomme ich für meine verkauften Spiele kein Geld? Leider gehe ich, bevor die erste Ladung abverkauft ist, immer pleite - Ich habe die Vermutung, dass man erst bei einem totalen Abverkauf der produzierten Stück ausbezahlt wird, habe aber keine Lust es zu prüfen.

Dann was noch dazu kommt ist, dass man extrem wenig Geld bei den Spielen verdienen würde, sodass man fast automatisch bankrott geht, oder man produziert einfach nur superlowbudget Spiele, keine Ahnung - ist aber super sinnlos.

Beispielrechnung. Man angelt sich einen Publishing-Vertrag mit Gewinnbeteiligung von 10% (was am Anfang schon recht viel ist, es gibt auch 6%, mehr auch, aber irgendwie unmöglich, da man eine sehr hohe Bewertung braucht, diese gibt es aber nicht obwohl man laut Qualität die besten Spiele auf dem Markt produziert, die Konkurenz ergattert Wertungen über 90% und hat nur halb (wortwörtlich) so gute Spiele entwickelt. Also weiter mit der Rechnung :)

Publishingvertrag mit 10%
Man entwickelt ein Sipel und lässt es programmieren (dauert je nachdem 3-6 Monate, teilweise mehr wenn man weniger Leute eingestellt hat) sehr Gute Leute kosten ~5000 EUR im Monat (mal mehr mal weniger), man braucht MINDESTENS 3 (Programmierer, Grafiker, Audiodesigner oder so) Leute, wobei die Entwicklungszeit dabei sich gerne mal verdoppelt, also habe ich 3 Programmierer, 2 Grafiker und 2 Audiodesigner. sind 35.000 im Monat, bei sagen wir mal 4 Monaten Programmierungszeit sind es also 140.000 EUR reine Entwicklungskosten.
Hinzu kommen noch die kosten für das Pressen der Spiele bei 50.000 Stk und bei sämtlichen Beilagen, wie Handbuch, sticker und irgendwas anderes, Poster glaub ich kommt man auf auf ca. 65.000 EUR, Sind also mindestens 200.000 EUR Kosten (Die Kosten für das Personal laufen übrigens weiter, aber wir gehen einfach davon aus, dass in der Zwischenzeit weiter entwickelt wird)
Wenn man die 50.000 Stk zu dem normalen eingestellten Preis von 39,00 EUR abverkauft wäre das ein Umsatz von 1.950.000 EUR - man bekommt aber nur die 10% vom Publisher, also nur 195.000 EUR, macht also ein Minus.

Dazu sei gesagt, dass die Entwicklung/Programmierung der Engine ebenfalls Geld verschluckt, zwar nur 1 mal (spätere Engines natürlich mehr) aber es sind auch, schätzungsweise 50-100.000 EUR die weg sind.

Man fängt mit ich glaube 100.000 EUR Startkapital an und man kann sich max. 250.000 EUR leihen

Nebenher zahlt man für den Kredit (ohne den es gar nciht geht) ab und irgendwelche anderen Sachen. ich habe es tatsächlich geschafft 2 Spiele zu entwickeln und zu pressen, bevor ich pleite gegangen bin, man bekommt auch irgendwie kein Geld pro verkauftem Spiel,sondern wie vermutet erst nachdem die gepresste Charge verkauft wurde (oder auch gar nicht) 

Auch gibt es einen Fehler im Spiel, dass man publishing Verträge für Adventure Spiele nicht absolvieren kann, da Adventure Spiele nicht mit dem Adventure-Vertrag kompatibel sind. o_0 - Strafzahlungen...

The voice acting is crap only 2 voices was used. The game looks like it was made back in 2003. Even warZ looks better than this shit. The game is not user friendly at all and sometimes the game like to spit out some german text. I made a review about this game and in the end I would rather do suicide than to play this game again.

It's just not anywhere near finished and if it is well then they developers need to recheck their definition of finished.

Initially I thought this might be a ""sequal"" to the very impressive Game Dev Tycoon, but when I noticed the publisher was different I figured that it wasn't. But it still went on my wishlist. Anyway a friend bought it for me and now I just feel like I owe him that money back.

I guess I'll just reiterate what everyone else has said about this game.

The ""controls"" are weird. Right click takes you back a screen, escape sends you to the main menu, everything is click and drag, no really clean selection system.

The voice acting was ok, when I could hear it over the background noises. The tutorial was completely a waste since I couldn't hear the narrator over most of the background noises.

A lot of the UI was really unresponsive forcing me to have to leave screens and re-enter them just for it to realize I modified an option.

So while I applaud the attempt at making a more ""in-depth"" GameDev sim, by including more options for publishing, a few different locations, and trying to make it feel more like a business. Please focus on making sure the game is fairly playable before releasing it.

I've seen flash games on the web that have mostly the same design, but not nearly as many of the problems.

Added: I went back and watched their ""trailer"" on steam and honestly it even looks like the person who was demoing it had no idea what to do. Also I ran into at least 1 menu still in German?, which happened to be the ""publishing"" menu.

It's not Game Dev Tycoon, which (to my knowledge) is the newest of game developer simulation games, and they aren't that similar either. Sure they share a theme, but the gameplay is different. In Game Tycoon, you can acquire licenses, you have to print the games yourself, choose what goodies to include in the packaging, advertise your games, see the reviews (they have pics too, though there should be more variables among them) and all that.

The graphics are cartoony and do their job, and there is voice acting (few lines here and there, nothing major). Music is a bit repetitive, but then again it's a simulation game aimed for niche market.

The only major problem I have is that it tends to crash on my system, and when it does it deletes my saves. I am not certain if this is a common problem, or just my machine.

Alles in allem ist der Simulationscharacter bessre (bzw. in grundzügen überhaupt vorhanden) als bei Game Dev Tycoon. Das heißt man kann jetzt auch parallele projekte planen, Anteile seiner Firma verkaufen, kredite nehmen, Preise von seinen Spielen festlegen und die Produktion der CDs oder Disketten anstoßen.

Es wirkt einfach bei weitem weniger Zufallsbasiert als es bei Game Dev Tycoon der Fall war.

Leider hat das Spiel aber auch seine Negativseiten. Die Entwickler scheinen nicht all zu gut gewesen zu sein, weshalb beim Erstellen eines neuen Spiels das Spiel quasi einmal neu gestartet wird (vermutlich um sicherzustellen dass wirklich alle Variablen wieder null sind). Ferner gibt es nach all den Jahren noch immer die selben Bugs.

Ab einem bestimmten Jahr ist die Erstellung von neuen Engines quasi unmöglich. Vorher hat man immer 5 Sterne Engines entwickelt und von einem Tag auf en anderen sind nurnoch 1 Stern Engines möglich ohne irgend eine Rückmeldung wodran das liegen könnte.

Teilweise tauchen in der Produktion auch titel auf die aus alten Spielständen auf, obwohl diese garnicht vorhanden sein dürften.

Aufgrund der Bugs ist das Spiel in meinen Augen leider nur eine 6/10.

Scratches head...  Scratches bottom... goes to make coffee.  This is a list of things you should do before buying this game.

Basically the game concept has the correct idea, the implementation and system they have gone through is daft.

I hire people who can produce a low quality of work, for cheap.  The publishers demand a Top quality game (88% rating) and will charge me 90,000 if I fail to produce the game in 2 months!! seriously, are they deluded?  this game has probably been in production for more than two months.  

The game engines you can rent (single game production only) are 10k +  you are lucky to make that much money on a produced game.
To produce a game engine...  DO NOT MAKE A CHEAP GAME ENGINE EVER.  Go straight to building the best engine you can, with every feature.  if you don't it's a waste of time and money.

When you hire people... pay attention to their Quality only.  if it takes them 10 months to make a super good game... Then thats better than a low quality game produced in 10 days. Publisher contracts run out.  Pay attention to how long you have to fill the contract. (making the contract and producing the game they want does not say the game will even sell...)

Basically this game gives you massive overheads of a full sized game company, with the technical production skills of a guy in a garage producing a game for a publisher.  (games of the 80's were not made in big offices with big budgets).

The game needs a scaling system from start to finish, 0-30% ratings on games for the start and 88%+ in the finish when you have good staff.",1392311646,1392578658,False,10,0,0.525487899780273438,2,True,False,False,False,,,

So I played just over 70 minutes of this and before I begin I would like to say the missing files has now been fixed.

The good: I like how you have to build te engine or can buy another companies one to make a game. As the years pass your options increase for building a better engine. I like the genre choices for making a game and from 2006 the graphics are alright.

I like how you have to buy magazines to see trends and reviews for your games and that the quality of your team really plays an impact on the games. I also like how publishers want a certain level of quality for a game and give you a time span (Personally I just make a game then wait for a good publisher).

The Bad: Trying to do that tutorial was a chore as you have to wait until he finishes talking to do what he says albiet you have to guess as it never shows you what any of the features are just assumes you know. At times especially in the printing room I couldn't hear him and there are no subtitles.

As this is an older game I'm gonna be more lenient but still add here that I have no idea if you can train you employee's or not (I oouldn't find anything) but hiring good employee's is expensive so you have to start off making terrible games.

This game has really long waits of doing nothing but the worst part is when you speed the game up the if you get a message on the PDA it goes back to slow. This is annoying when most of the PDA messages are either a joke or you got money. I'm fine with telling me the stock of a game is low or I lost money for some reason but anything else it should keep it sped up.

On that note I hate how at the end of the year you are transported back to your office.


Overall: My overall rating is a 5/10 it's far from the worst game ever as I've played both Game Dev Story, Game Dev Tycoon and Gamebiz 3. For it's price range it's ok I don't feel cheated. I give it a recommendation but only if you like the genre.",1392285644,1392285644,True,15,2,0.326607614755630493,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The contrast in sounds is horrible, when playing the tutorial you will barely be able to hear the person explain the game due to the background sounds (also the voiceacting is just horrible, I would have rather had no voiceacting at all), besides that the tutorial is just horrendous and not user friendly at all. Also, every notification slows your game down, so when it feels the need to tell me kids threw stuff at my house or that my competitors made a new game it slows my game down again, this is really tedious as the messages are irrelevant to me!
