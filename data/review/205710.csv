Loved it then, and love it now. Yes the game experience has changed, but I think if you find good players to group with you can still have a good time. After all its the grouping that makes this game.

On the tech side. I have just installed Steam on my fully patched Fedora 35 with an Nvidia card and the vendor's drivers installed. I set my settings to use the experimental Proton layer, and while it did install 32 bit packages, it worked. And EQ to my surprise and delight came up and worked! 

There are a couple of small tricks though:
1) To get the mouse mapping to line up with the buttons vertically I had to either go full screen, <ALT><ENTER>, or maximize your window. Notice that full screen and maxed window both worked.
2) There were the occasional moments when I needed to click twice on something to get it to work, but that didn't really bother me. 
To me these were such small nit picks that I feel I can say ""it just worked"". YMMV.

nach meinen ersten Eindrücken kann ich das Spiel nur absolut jedem Empfehlen der MMOs mag. 
Everquest ist ja sozusagen einer der Urväter, aber es ist immer noch da und wird aktiv gespielt! Ich war auf mehreren Servern und auf jedem sind in den Anfänger gebieten Spieler unterwegs.

Das Spiel wird eben Hauptsächlich über den eigenen Launcher gespielt und nicht über Steam.

Das Spiel ist ja von 1999 und erhält immer noch stetig Updates und Erweiterungen! Aktuell bei Nr. 30 meine ich.

Wenn man mal etwas anderes wie die heutigen Games erleben möchte und sich auf ein Abenteuer einlassen kann, ohne sofort innerhalb von wenig Aufwand viel erreicht zu haben, ist das hier für jeden einen Versuch wert!

Ebenso Everquest 2.

For anyone new to the game or looking to satisfy their nostalgia, a new Time-Locked Progression (TLP) server is usually announced/released around May each year.

TLP's are the easiest way to get introduced into the 24+ years of content that has been added to the game.  It's much easier to learn the game starting at level 1 where the lower level zones are packed with people, pickup groups are likely, and people are more receptive to new players.  TLP's are also typically more reasonable for raiding time required given people with busy schedules and families.

I think that in order to really enjoy the later expansions after the first ~6 or so (and there are like 30 now), you really need to seek out a dedicated guild or group of friends to play with.

This is nowhere near the quality of that game.

I haven't made it out of the starting area, or done any quests, or killed more than the first mob in the tutorial but I can already tell this is going to be an experience... Which would all be fine.  I can deal with that. After all this is an MMO, and an old one at that.

What I can't deal with the constant reminders that I should really look at some exciting deals and microtransactions, buy a subscription, and upgrade to premium. More than that: They want to charge MORE than Final Fantasy 14 does for it's sub... and that's an actual AAA quality game.  

For me the lack of quality, the terrible intro experience, and the predatory monetization are my takeaways from my time here, and I have no interest in even trying to proceed further... which is a shame because I had really high hopes for this game.  

24 years and they haven't got the first hour of the New Player experience figured out.

The game doesn't hold your hand at all and it's easy to miss small but vital details that are required to function in this mess of an ancient mmo. 

I saw a tutorial button and thought to myself ""I should do that"" and clicked it. Nothing happened so I clicked it again, once or twice. ""Ok then..."" I create a character and enter the world which takes me directly into the city where I spend the first 10-20 minutes un-fucking the UI. Getting my bearings, I made my way to the first quest which was kill four spiders and talk to npc. Seems easy enough only after killing the enemies, the npc would cycle the quest start text and not the completion text. Apparently, clicking the tutorial button at character creation decides if you do the tutorial, which makes perfect sense. Only, there's zero notification if the button is on or off or if you've missed it ect. So not only was a large vital part of the game simply bypassed with no warning, the game also did nothing to hint at the correct action to take. The only information you get is to type ""hail"" in chat. 

Turns out after scouring the options, you HAVE to press H to hail and not type it as instructed. This is hilarious to those who have been around and so i received nothing short of harassment.

I recently started putting hours in to Everquest again, ive been off and on playing EQ since 2001, and with no suprise at all there are still some good people around but there are still a lot of garbage people around. Good luck getting any group at all at any level, unless u can pay for power levels. This doesnt just effect only the main servers but the TLP (time locked progression) servers as well. I spent alot of time playing when the Mischief server came out, i loved the randomized loot rules, and had plenty of group invites playing a shaman even got in to a raid guild and was raiding multiple times a week. Then the garbage time comes around, The Shadows of Luclin is unlocked and the ""WTS Powerlevel..."" spam starts. Group invites become few and far between, the guild starts to fall apart when main people start leaving. I spent so many hours, a lvl 60 raid geared shaman, just looking for some AA (alternate ability *i fucking hate and love these at the same time*) with no luck at all.  

So i took a break i come back and play on Firiona vie server (yet another mistake), I thought ill go find some gear on the bazaar and saw the absurd prices and said ok nvm ill see if i can get some stuff from old world raid content. Being a free trade/RP server (pretty much everything is tradeable) nothing is really ever up you kinda have to camp it or get really luck for certain things. So that all went out the window, and i was left with farming trash, getting crafting mats i knew i could sell to players. Once i amassed a hoard of goodies to throw at people to attempt to make some plat for my and an alt, i was informed by the game that i can not sell any items or setup a barter to buy any items in the bazaar as a free to play player, but i can still buy items from players selling items. Which ok sure why not i thought, fine ill check out how much a krono (currency item for game time) is..... 10+ million platinum. Which you cant sell items to player so unless u wanna sit in chat channels spamming that your selling things you'll need to either A) spend $$$ to get a subscription or B) sell everything to a vendor. So i did some testing, being someone who really wasnt in the know on where to farm for money, i went to different zones from higher level to lower level and tested money/hour. The best i could manage before to  defeat sunk in was about 12k for several hours for farming lower level content for gems/spells drops since they sold the best to vendors. The thing that killed me was respawn time, or players in the zone mass pulling to powerlevel alts or people who paid them $$$ or kronos.
 
These ware the factors that cause me to stop enjoying everquest, the remnants of the ""community"" at  the lower levels, no ones grouping due to no new people, or the amount of power leveling. The choke hold that free to play game companies put in games to get you to pay them, such as but not limited to  not being able to wear (or receive stats from) gear tagged prestige once our subscription ends, not being able to sell items in the only place to really make in game money in a timely manner, not being able to setup a barter character to buy specific things at the price you set, and the tens of thousands of AAs which isnt as bad now thanks to the autogrant system  just giving them to you as long as you have a subscription or you can farm the exp for 1k points max to grind and use. Honestly Project 99 has a much better feel for me, even with so few people online when i get on i can still on most days get a group and get things done.

Lag on raids (bristlebane) at the worse is multiple seconds from cast, to damage/healing numbers showing up on chat. Each year there is a race starting in Janurary-March after expansion launch of who can finish all the raids in the fastest time, beyond march there are no content updates and patches are 1x/month. There is, an albeit, a dated tradeskill grind system, slayer achievements, older content etc to do but the game punishes any alternate characters you make.
There's a large botting problem too, every time locked server and on most live servers you will see many people in general looking to sell their stuff for krono (membership token), which then gets reselled on 3rd party sites for money to the player that owned those kronos. These people can play 10, 15, possibly more accounts, and not get banned unless they are actually afk and dont respond to private messages from GMs. The same can similarly be applied to chat spammers.
If you do not care for these things, the game can be pretty good but I wouldnt find myself recommending EQ to anybody that wants to put in more serious time into a new game as there is little payoff.",1695159983,1695160121,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Vielleicht für 2-3 Monate. Dann habe ich es jedoch aus den Augen verloren. Es kam WoW, Everquest 2, Rift, TESO, FF14 und noch diverse andere MMOs und Online-Spiele, die ich seit dem gespielt habe. 
Vor kurzem entdeckte ich Everquest hier auf Steam - und obwohl ich gerade FF14 eine monatliche Spielzeit am laufen hatte, reizte es mich, mal hineinzuschnuppern.
Was soll ich sagen: es hat mich von Anfang an begeistert. Vor allem das Spielen auf einem TLP (Time Locked Progression)-Server ist fasnierend. Das sind Server, die mit Everquest Vanilla starten und alle paar Wochen eine der 29 Erweiterungen als Update erhalten. Man durchläuft also die Everquest-Geschichte von Anfang an und hat vor allem am Anfang das Original-Spielerlebnis nahezu wieder.
Und das hat es in sich. Besonders durch die Eigenheit der Mobs, sich gegenseitig im Kampf zu unterstützen, kommt es oft zu spannenden Situationen. Da flieht ein Mob aus dem Kampf und wenn er an Freunden vorbei kommt, schließen diese sich dem Kampf an - in manchen Dungeons kommt es daher oft zu  kritischen Situationen (sprich Wipes). Auch lassen sich Mobs mit Aggro nicht so einfach abschütteln - da muss man schon mal durch die ganze Zone rennen, und wehe, man ist nicht schnell genug, dann machen einen die Verfolger fertig.
Ja, und das schmerzt - 10% Exp Abzug zum nächsten Level ca. gehen verloren - und man kann sogar im Level zurückgestuft werden.
Das Spiel ist komplex, knifflig, auf charmante Art sperrig. Wer Wert auf moderne Grafik legt, ist hier allerdings komplett falsch - an so manchem Gebilde (egal ob Monster, Haus oder Held) kann man die Polygon-Eckpunkte sehen und es gibt keine Ahs und Ohs wegen toller Grafik. Dafür benötigt das Game allerdings auch weniger Leistung - was mir entgegen kommt.
Ist es P2W? Nun ja... fürs erste sinnvoll ist sicherlich eine monatliche Spielzeit - man kann sehr gut reinschnuppern im F2P - aber die TLP-Server sowie das weitere Gameplay sind mit bezahlter Spielzeit-Pflicht. Und dann gibt es noch die Kronos. Diese kosten 18 $ und können Ingame verkauft werden (sie ermöglichen 30 Tage Spielzeit) - ähnlich einem Plex in EVE-Online (wers kennt). Für ein Krono bekommt man eine hohe Summe an Platinmünzen - und kann sich bessere Ausrüstung leisten. Ist das Notwendig? Ich finde nicht... und es stört mich nicht weiter, wenn manche sich mit Echtgeld rausputzen.
Kann man es Solo spielen? Je nach Heldenklasse ist ein Solo-Spiel möglich, wenn auch etwas zäh - in einer guten Gruppe stehen einem ganz andere Wege offen. Dennoch kann man sich Solo durchbeißen und dies hat auch oft seinen eigenen Charm. Zur Not gibt es ja auch noch Gilden.
Das Spiel ist NICHT übersetzt und auf englisch. Muss man akzeptieren - wobei ich mit meinem uralten Schulenglisch immer noch zurecht komme. Man sollte jedoch die Menge an Text nicht unterschätzen - weniger die im Spiel - als vielmehr die auf externen Seiten über das Game - denn vieles kann man nachlesen und es gibt wichtige Informationen zu Mobs, Drops, Zonen, Skills, Spells, etc. im Netz.

Ich genieße zur Zeit eine herrlich unpolierte MMO-Erfahrung auf dem noch recht frischen TLP-Server ""Oakwynd"" und muss sagen, dass ich deutlich spannendere Momente erlebe als in aktuellen und polierten Titeln, wo ein Erfolgserlebnis das nächste jagt und alles smooth daherläuft. Everquest ist holprig, hat eine steile Lernkurve und ... gibts seit 1999 - merkt man, und ich finds gut.

For me I still have fun, I have over 10,000 hours on just one of many characters that I play.  There is no other MMO with the amount of content of this game. 

Most of the negative review I seen made a few mistakes. If you are starting out it is worth the sub to play on a Time Lock Progression TLP server. The newer the server to more low level players. You can later transfer of to another server if you choose too. Another great place to Start is Firiona Vie where almost all gear can be traded. You can easily gear up and level easily. Also there is a large player base on that server. 

Another thing it to set reasonable expectations in this game. Rushing for max level is not a good idea unlike other games where skipping content and getting max is the main goal. There is tons of content and lots of it rewards you throughout the game. Just getting to max level will have you at a serious disadvantage over the other max level players. It is those players that power level to max and then get frustrated when they are severely under powered. Make sure to have fun and explore, do quests, and missions. 

Next is play the class you enjoy not what is needed for raiding at end game. I see far to many make this mistake and hate the character they are playing. I have always been able to eventually get my main into a raiding guild. Some classes will be very slow to level, generally your support classes like Enchanters, Bards, and Clerics. If you want a simple class that is easy to level Ranger and Rouge are very easy to play and have abilities that make leveling quick. If you want a good all around character the Beastlord, Nerco, or Mage are hard to beat and can solo most content.

Lançado em 1999, o jogo foi um dos primeiros a oferecer um vasto mundo virtual persistente, repleto de aventuras e desafios para os jogadores explorarem. Uma das principais características que tornaram EverQuest tão icônico foi o seu mundo imersivo e rico em detalhes. O jogo apresenta um extenso mapa com inúmeras regiões, cidades, masmorras e territórios para os jogadores descobrirem. A variedade de raças jogáveis e classes permite uma ampla gama de opções de personalização de personagens, dando aos jogadores a liberdade de criar heróis únicos e com habilidades especializadas.

Outro destaque de EverQuest é o seu sistema de progressão. Os jogadores ganham experiência ao derrotar monstros e completar missões, permitindo que eles evoluam seus personagens e acessem novas habilidades e equipamentos. Essa progressão gradual cria uma sensação de conquista e crescimento contínuo, incentivando os jogadores a continuar explorando e enfrentando desafios cada vez maiores. EverQuest também é conhecido por sua comunidade ativa e envolvente. O jogo incentiva a interação entre os jogadores, seja na forma de grupos para enfrentar inimigos poderosos ou na formação de guildas para colaborar em objetivos comuns. A socialização e a cooperação entre os jogadores são essenciais para o progresso e sucesso no jogo.

Entretanto, é importante mencionar que EverQuest é um jogo desafiador e pode exigir um investimento significativo de tempo e dedicação. A curva de aprendizado pode ser íngreme para os novos jogadores, e o jogo é conhecido por sua dificuldade, especialmente em encontros com Bosses e masmorras de alto nível. Em suma, EverQuest é um clássico do gênero MMORPG que proporcionou aos jogadores uma experiência envolvente e imersiva em um mundo virtual vasto. Com seu mundo rico, progressão gratificante e uma comunidade dedicada, o jogo continua sendo uma opção atraente para os fãs de jogos online que procuram uma aventura épica e duradoura.",1685747661,1685747661,True,17,2,0.696446478366851807,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Everquest is one of the original MMORPGs and has been around for over two decades. While the game may be showing its age in some aspects, it still remains a classic and worth playing for anyone interested in the history of the genre.

The graphics and art design in Everquest may be a bit dated, but the game still offers a variety of environments and character models that are well-designed and customizable. The game also features a variety of cosmetic items that allow you to personalize your character even further.

What really sets Everquest apart is its history and legacy. The game was groundbreaking when it first released, and it still offers a deep and immersive world that is filled with lore and history. The game also offers a variety of systems, such as crafting, tradeskills, and player housing, that are all fleshed out and offer a lot of depth.

The gameplay in Everquest is also well-done. The combat system is intuitive and offers a variety of abilities and strategies, and the class system offers a variety of playstyles to suit your preferences. The game also offers a variety of quests and activities, from solo quests to group dungeons and raids, that provide a lot of content to explore.

The community in Everquest is also one of the best in any MMORPG. The player base is friendly and helpful, and the game features a variety of social activities, from player housing to events and festivals. This makes playing the game feel like you are part of a community rather than just a player.

Of course, Everquest is not without its flaws. The game can be a bit overwhelming at times, with a lot of content to explore and learn. The game can also be a bit slow-paced compared to other MMORPGs, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.

Overall, if you're interested in the history of MMORPGs and want to experience one of the original games in the genre, Everquest is definitely worth playing. With its deep and immersive world, engaging story, and strong community, Everquest is a classic MMORPG that has stood the test of time.",1680536962,1680536962,True,2,0,0.519408524036407471,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I don't think it's hyperbole to say it's historically one of the most important games ever created. It was not the first MMORPG, but it so completely defined the genre that every title since can trace it's inspiration back to it. While World of Warcraft perfected the formula, eventually claiming the commercial success crown, WoW owed almost everything to the framework Everquest set. A shockingly large number of big budget efforts failed to unseat Everquest in the intervening time. The ghost of Everquest continues to haunt newly released titles to this day. This is less a review and more a love letter to an all time classic.

Truthfully, firing up Everquest in 2023 if you never played it is an exercise in frustration and near pointlessness. It's enduring value is as a historical relic.  Nostalgically it remains perfection. Objectively it's no longer a good game. But having the ability to freely pop back in and go for a walk through the dungeons and landscapes that I explored around the turn of the millennia remains a pretty amazing blessing.

I can't begin to explain the awe, wonder, and terror that Everquest evoked as you explored its world in it's day. Arguably, Everquest was never a good game. Yet so powerful were the emotions it evoked that it basically didn't matter. Players were happy to have the best the technology of it's day could do; were just thrilled to have the opportunity to wander Norrath. That magic is gone now. Still, the memories remain. More polished, more enjoyable games have been released since. But none came close to reproducing that raw sense of wonder. Everquest's ambition was staggering. It's probably a miracle it worked at all.

The game has been dumbed down and made easy to experience alone. Now you can casually pop back in and explore the dark corners of Sebilis and Solusek Ro that were far too dangerous to poke around in it's day. There's a magic like that of an archaeologist in coming back and seeing areas that were left to the imagination a generation ago for the first time.

In an era where games shut down servers a year or two after release, I'm glad this game remains playable nearly a quarter of a century after it was birthed. Every gamer interested in the history of gaming owes themselves an hour or two to test drive it. It's glory days are long behind it, never to return.

I did not play enough to actually gather a proper experience as to whether the quality is good or bad (not that I would even need to tell you. This game has a reputation for a reason), because the game feels its age so damn hard that simply doing the most basic things were a pain in the ass, even with the really subpar tutorials trying to do their best to explain it to you. But this is not a flaw of the game itself, but rather likely due to technical limitations they had back in 1999 that they either couldn't fix, or  genuinely thought certain things were not a bad idea back then. Either is possible due to how old this game is.

So like, this is the type of game you'd be hard pressed to find someone enjoying when they have never played Everquest before, so in that light I don't recommend the game to anyone wondering if they want to give it a try.

EverQuest no es un nombre muy recordado últimamente. La última vez que me interesé por esta franquicia fue con EverQuest Next antes de su cancelación, desde entonces no volví a prestarle mucha atención. Recientemente me enteré de cuenta todavía con servidores abiertos y es totalmente accesible mediante Steam, así que tuve que instalarlo.

Claramente no es la versión de antaño, esa no la opera Daybreak Game Company, pero por si te interesa existe un proyecto legal hecho por fans llamado ""Project 1999 EverQuest"" o ""EverQuest Classic"" cuya función es la de abrir servidores como si se tratase del EverQuest de su época.

Ya hablando de la versión disponible mediante Steam, está bastante actualizada y modernizada en función a las posibilidades de su motor, es una experiencia interesante para los que disfrutamos de este género, pero es importante advertir que las mecánicas y características ya obsoletas siguen vigentes, tratándose de un MMO muy desafiante y cuyo ritmo lento se conserva. 

Es de una época en la que la aventura de un MMO nacía en el juego y se desarrollaba en tu imaginación, creyendo que esos golpes sin feedback y con animaciones robóticas eran combates de magnitudes calamitosas.

Le pesa los años y es indiscutible que está más dirigido a quienes lo jugaban o a quienes les da curiosidad, no a un público genuinamente interesado en empezar en este mundo. Pero si te interesa, es un clásico que sigue contando con una comunidad relativamente activa, que se reduce a dos tercios de su número total si no contamos a los bots, pero sigue siendo bastante gente para tratarse de un producto tan añejo.

It is good that Ever Quest is still available to play since it is one of the first online multi-player RPG games that anyone playing online games should know about. Something that younger generations should at least play for awhile and learn about in regards to the history of online gaming and where allot of it started. It is also initially free-to-play, thus you won't loose much but your time. There is also so much never ending quest content that it definitely lives up to the title of Ever Quest as the original creators intended. It is also very stable and very well worked on since it has been around and maintained for so long.

Cons:
Unlike the 'classic' Ever Quest, the importance of player interaction has been downgraded since it's glory days of 1999. You can practically solo through most levels depending on the class you choose. Though this is not per-say bad, the original Ever Quest required you to group with other players from the beginning, was very slow paced, and demanding of player class cooperation. Now, the original zones are dead like me: empty, forgotten, and occupied by bored and lonely NPCs. You can relive the original zone progression if you choose, and if you know which zones to go to, but you will for sure be doing so alone, and will need previous experience with the game to know how to get your new character to your lonely racial starting zone and know what quest are there. Playing in the original zones will also be much slower. However, there is active guilds in game in which you can find other players to interact with and progress to higher level raid content. So there is options of playing with others, but not as required as it was in classic EQ, and will have to progress through the newer zones to find players, leaving the old zones abandoned in a hot car like a forgotten child with crackhead parents. You are also limited to only select severs as free-to-play, so keep that in mind as well, though there is plenty of servers to choose from over all.

Overall Recommendation:
I am giving it a recommendation for the nostalgic availability, free-to-play option, game stability, and lack of continuous issues as some games have. If you like those things to run smooth in a game, and like to solo allot, then the DayBreak Ever Quest is a good choice. If you have active friends or family that like to play games with you, it would also be a good option. Probably not a good choice for impatient PVP players that like non-stop high player content and consistent player interactions. You will have to be very pro-active to get player interactions. Always try a free-to-play option first if available since many games seem to have issues with paid subscriptions.

Why this game is shit: 

The player base - It's a 50/50 mix of angry hostile basement dwelling sweats that treat a 23 year old elf simulator like it's the next up and coming e-sport and bot farmers. It's not uncommon to see 1 person running around followed by 5 bots that are being operated by 3rd party software. The real players you'll interact with have exactly the personality you'd expect from someone that hasn't left their basement since they logged into the game over 2 decades ago. If you're new you will be treated in a hostile manner for not understanding all of the intricacies of a 23 year old video game and often discarded in favor of someone who does. 
 
The game is broken - After 2 decades of just dumping shallow content patches on players without worrying about silly things like bug fixes and optimization the game barely functions. You can look forward to enjoying frequent freezes and crashes for seemingly no reason. If you do manage to miraculously make it into the game itself you'll soon be plagued with issues like complete UI resets, crashing while zoning, crashing due to resolution changes, crashing due to random disconnects and crashing because its Wednesday and why not?

The game is dead - The game is tagged as an MMO but in reality its closer to a Single player RPG. In order to properly enjoy this game you're going to need pay multiple subscription fees for multiple accounts because nobody actually wants to play this game with other players (you can't hardly blame them given the personality of the average Everquest player.) The TLP servers offer a ""Truebox"" ruleset to prevent this but DBG/Darkpaw do not enforce it so any decent hunting spot/camp is gobbled up by 1 person playing 6 accounts. 

The economy - It's nonexistant and revolves around trading subscription tokens that are purchased with real money for items instead of in game currency. As im writing this review there is currently someone auctioning an item for 35 Krono ($629.65) on the newest TLP server. Yes this is real, you can't make this shit up, yes the developers are that dumb. 

I could give you a hundred more reasons not to play this game but to be honest I don't care enough to list them. Save your time and your money and don't bother downloading this game. The developers gave up on producing anything meaningful over a decade ago and instead their only focus is cosmetic microtransactions and selling in game tradeable subscription tokens for nearly $20 a pop.",1656885771,1656885771,False,39,14,0.611619174480438232,7,False,False,False,False,,,

Everyone I've met there helps you out, rather than something like WoW which is competitive, easy, soloable, whereas on EQ you literally need to group up to level up (unless you're a longer and mastered soloing which is easier for a few classes).

It's very much based on D&D. The developers put a ton of work in it. I stay stick with classic EQ - it's an old time game but anyone who has played says it has the greatest community. Try it out on Project 1999- the Green Server is the best one. 
Started in 1999 and just started it out again but not on Steam - it's the most rewarding, fascinating, friendly and community-wise the greatest MMO over.

It was a harsh, brutal world in the beginning and has morphed into a care bear version of itself, with countless convenience features available for real money. That's the divider; when people speak of this game with passion, it's because of the deep imprint that hard games make on the player.

There's no game out there today with more content, more complex mechanics and a more passionate fan base. If WOW is the pinnacle of your mental gaming ladder, then don't bother; EverQuest will kick your butt and spit you out, leaving you complaining about the graphics and whatnot.

If you're honest and open minded about letting EverQuest expanding your gaming world, you basically have 3 options:

1. Play EQ Live, where most toons are max level with raid gear and PL their new toons to max, leaving few to group with while levelling (to the max level, which is 120 when this is written).

2. Start on a Time Locked Progression (TLP) server, that opens up expansions one at the time over 2 years. It has a more social player base, and many are experienced EQ players. The best new comer experience.

3. Start on Project 1999 (P99); EverQuest servers aiming for the authentic experience from 20 years ago, will never go past  the 2nd expansion (Velious) in what most die hard fans consider the ""golden trifecta"" of EverQuest (base game +2 expansions). It has a smaller player base in a smaller gaming world, the experience resemble what got most people hooked in 1999.

EverQuest (atleast TLP and P99) is one of the very few games in existence, where Pickup Groups (PUG) is not a curse word. While leveling you will certainly run into some bad eggs, but most people will be friendly and happy to help out new players. This is countered by the fact that  EverQuest today have no real newb mode, where new players are protected from the sheer complexity that is the EverQuest universe.

This has the effect that the player base in EverQuest in 2022 consist of mostly seasoned veterans, either from years of playing or returning to the game. There are new players and while the player base is friendly and helpful, the game itself is not really new player friendly.

If you're lucky enough to have a friend able to guide you into EverQuest, don't miss the opportunity, Just don't let them PL you too far, learning your class as you progress is how the game was designed and dungeon crawling a _slightly_ to hard dungeon with a group of friends is where EverQuest really shines.

EverQuest is a 20 year old fantasy mmo. Having played only the tutorial, I'm not really sure about any of the story other than we escaped a prison. The graphics are not that bad for a 20 year old game, I've played a couple of MMOs that are younger than this that have worse graphics. The character creation was okay. Plus this is the first mmo that lets me play as a frog girl, which I'm still not sure why I was so excited but hey it was very cool. Also, It has a ton of race and classes to pick from for free. The UI is a big turn off for me. There's so much text on the screen that I get lost in it. Forming a party wasn't that hard, and it actually had a tutorial for that. It's surprising that it stuck around for so long and it has a multitudes of expansions. One thing that did annoy me a bit was a ""Became a Member"" add would pop up in the middle of what i was doing once in a while. I won't keep playing it, but it's not a bad game. And I give this a 6/10.

PVE
so i got the game. make a toon it has 1,2,3,4, pages of making one. then time to give it a name. name i want is taken ok but... it backs me out to page 1 and i have to repick everything for my toon again. this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is great

PVP
ok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.",1641739226,1641739226,True,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The TLP servers in my opinion are a great alternative to p99, you get something close-ish to the original experience but with some really nice quality of life features thrown in (though the population drops in early zones are real after maybe a couple of months.) The live servers like Firiona Vie are fun as well and you can find some really good communities, but again, most people are either in the 50's or 60's up to endgame, so you will be soloing with mercs until you get to that point. The payment systems are fair, Krono is cool because much like EVE you can earn your way into a sub. 

Everquest also has something special - a beautiful soundtrack. Do yourself a favor and turn off the combat music after hearing it maybe once? It's pretty redundant. Luclin has some of the most beautiful music in a game period. EQ is absolutely a grind, and can be a lonely one, but if you find a good guild it can be a great social experience. It just has a certain charm that has not been made obsolete, although many many games came after it, and it lies in the simplicity - sit and grind in a camp. It is boring - with the wrong people. But it can be absolutely a blast with a good group.

Highly recommend but know what you are getting into!! Learning curve feels very very high at first, and is in many ways, but the live servers offer great tutorials, and a nice string of accessible zones. Not to mention PoK access right away which makes traveling the breeze. EQ has a very...unique...balance. You will learn that some mobs hit harder than others, take more damage than others, and that inspecting them and finding out their level and challenge is really a guideline - you will often be fighting reds and yellows, until you won't - gearing is important but with Defiant gear all over the place, is pretty easy to keep caught up on.

My Review and Thoughts on EverQuest:

EverQuest was the beginning of something amazing in my life. I had heard about it in 1999, but I didn't buy it until 2000 when the Kunark expansion came out. It was my first MMORPG and it blew my mind. The fact that I was seeing my friends on my screen and we were running around together was incredible. That we could group up and tackle the content was amazing. Back then, the pace was very slow. Meditating for mana was incredibly slow, mob spawns in many places were 28 minutes apart. It was so much fun, though. It gave everyone time to interact and get to know each other in the group. Discuss tactics and talk about other content that we had experienced or wanted to tackle someday.

The game itself has changed a lot over the years to say the least. The game is 22 years old for crying out loud. Of course it's going to change. Over time, especially after WoW was released, they began making the game easier and easier, and allowed for a faster pace. At the time, we grumbled about it, but I see now that it was just a natural process.

If you have never played, I highly recommend you do. It's incredibly easy to gear up now. The content isn't nearly as difficult and soul crushing as it was 20 years ago. It's a very fun game. But don't go looking for an experience that you're familiar with. This is an entirely different type of game and it will take some getting used to in regard to setting up hotkeys and learning the spell system. It's not complex really, it's just different.

You always start in the Mines of Gloomingdeep now, which is a good thing, as it contains a wealth of information for new players via the tutorials. If you're new to the game, I highly recommend that you slow down and actually read the information. In the long run you'll be much happier. The game really opens up and gaining power increases the fun level immensely. So I hope you'll have the patience to stick it out, at least get out of the Mines. Start your quest to become great. Joining a Guild is always a good idea, and there are global chat channels, including New Player chat channels that can help you along when you're stuck or confused.

I always return to EverQuest. I know that a large part of it is because it was my first MMORPG and I sort of grew along with it, even though I was in my early 20's when it was released. It's a different game now in many ways, and you can zip around the world using the Plane of Knowledge. 

If you're on the fence, give it a shot. A real shot. Commit to getting through the first 10 or 15 levels. You may find that EverQuest is game you had no idea you were yearning for.

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the game. Ramblings mostly, but I hope it helps.

If you've played Final Fantasy XI, then you know what you're getting into with this game.

Grindy. Long, drawn out quests with little direction. Death penalties. Needing to actually talk to NPC's instead of just grab and go. Slow leveling (especially in the later levels). Boat rides that take around 15 minutes. The list goes on.

In short, if you're wanting something closer to Dungeons and Dragons 2nd edition as opposed to 5th, then this is the game you should pick up. It's fantastic, if you have the patience to learn its systems and immerse yourself in its world. Not even the old graphics hold it back in my opinion, as playing it is like stepping into a time capsule back when dial up was a thing.

If any of those the above sound boring, aggravating, or monotonous, then I would advise staying away. This game demands you put in time in order to progress, and it doesn't care about your feelings.

72 man raids that took over an hour to kill one boss and took prolific planning and execution to complete by all in the raid. 

The worst thing to happen to it was the casualisation, marking the beginning of the end of those fantastic days.

 Sadly, a trait that most MMO's adopt today and ever since. 

Great things about EverQuest:


1) Long travel times and death penalties
2) Group dungeon crawling and community building
3) Newbies and casuals admiring the Hardcores and their special loot/armor look

Zero instant gratification, and the scope just seemed epic.  The first trip across the Karanas.  Or looking off the boat and seeing the Cyclops trouncing around their island.  You just felt small.

I also enjoyed that minor things had major meaning depending on level.  Still remember trading a SSB that was given to me by a warrior in the top raiding guild on Innoruuk.  It was from their SSOY farm, and I traded it for my first PGT.  He gave me one to wear and one to sell because he had a pack full of them.  Always ended up with 27 helms and a single sword it seemed.

Sydsloot Halflingpunter, 50 Barbarian Warrior...guy seemed like a god to me as a lo 20's scrub inspecting him to see the best gear available in vanilla.

OK, I really enjoyed camping guards. Don't know why  :lol: perhaps it was the good XP or getting to help newbies when they run to their guards and find them dead. As a mage I could usually help them with their trains, and buffing them was fun for me. Not everyday a mage feels useful  :D 

So here is my list of guards killed.

Steamfont: Gnome guards were plentiful and decent money.

Misty Thicket: Guards along the wall, had lowbie druids cast lull so I could easily break the spawn

Neriak 3rd Gate: all of the wandering guards near the floating eye.

Thurgadin: Had to chain cast my earth pet at lvl 55 to kill one of them. not worth the XP, but you do get a cool shield.

Erudin: Don't remember where in Erudin but I remember he used LH, which sucked.

Qeynos Hills: Random guards, just for fun.

Butcherblock: Many dwarf guards, little ankle bitters can put up a fight.

Heck, anything that moved that I could kill I tried to. Just to see what it dropped. I had some horrible faction problems, but it was all worth it. I loved the freedom to make such decisions. God I love this game!

I did a little nostalgia run of this, recently. Teleported myself to Qeynos and played it just like it was back then, without any of the new content, from scratch. It was a blast. Got to level 30ish. The immersion of this game is so good, because it demands so much of you. It demands you to become one with the game, and that's what makes it so cool. Learn your environment or get lost, type to the NPC's or be clueless, pay attention or get killed, be a detective or learn nothing of the world you are experiencing, train your character or suck at everything, pay attention to factions or get killed. It's an explorer's dream world.

Compare that to WoW or Elder Scrolls Online, which I've been playing. These new MMO's just feel like a fancy backdrop with some chores available. A place to go and hang out and do something, even if it's not anything particularly memorable. I don't feel any atmosphere, I don't feel any danger, I don't feel any immersion. It's not a virtual world, it's just a virtual stage by comparison.

Everquest managed to make such an immersive experience that it really feels like a second world. There's enough depth to it, to really capture the imagination. I'd say it's still one of the best MMO's around, even if people don't understand it these days. They expect games to tell them what to do and where to go, and that's just not how EQ works. Culture shock, basically.

Be glad we experienced a zeitgeist, my dudes. Nobody will ever experience Everquest again, because the times have changed, and even if they see it, they won't know what they are seeing.",1627225879,1665245099,True,5,1,0.506403207778930664,6,False,False,False,False,,,

This review is for people who have never played EverQuest.

The good of EverQuest: 
[list]
    [*]The game has a ton of content.
    [*]The game requires grouping.  If you like playing MMOs in a group this game is great.
    [*]This game doesn't hold your hand.  If you like doing quests there's a lot to discover, possibly years of content.
[/list]

The bad about EverQuest
[list]
    [*]They have never updated the UI, if you have a 2K monitor you will have trouble reading text.  There are some UI mods to fix some of this but they are challenging to find and are still not perfect.
    [*]The game is slow.  If you have a lot of time to play this isn't a problem.  But if you only have 30 minutes you might as well not log in because you will not get anything done.
    [*]The game revolves around camping.  Which is finding a good spot, and someone in your party pulls to your spot, and you kill stuff in the same place for literally hours.  This is because casters get more mana back by sitting.  This is fine if you are with friends and are enjoying each other's company.  If you are with untalkative strangers it can be a drag.  This can be a good game to watch Netflix with... if that sounds fun.
    [*]Some people play EverQuest as a solo character.  This is strange to me because you would have to judge EverQuest versus other single player RPGs.  Comparing the fun of soloing in EverQuest to ""soloing"" Skyrim or Dark Souls is silly. This game is a strange choice for solo players.

If you bring up any of there shady practices(such as bait and switch tactics) on their forums you get banned. I highly recommend not touching this game unless:

A. You do no care that the current management team has little respect for the player base

B. You are willing to fork out hundreds of dollars to have multiple active accounts to box to make any progress in this game. Everyone plays multiple accounts at once and no one groups much any more.  The rate of progression solo will make it nearly impossible to be current unless you devote most of your free time to it. 

C. You love micro transactions. This is the largest Pay to Win model ive ever experienced.  

D. You do not care about pvp, While it exists, the Developers are actively hostile and rude to the Pvp community. 

F. The Devs have favoritism  big time. From the forums to what they let some players get away with, its a 2 tiered system. 

The game itself was amazing, but nearly everyone I know that has moved on from Everquest did so because of the people running the game. Ive never experienced these issues with any other game or MMO before.

To say that it was a groundbreaking or genre-defining game is understating it. EverQuest created an entire genre, introduced an entirely new array of players to fantasy RPG games, and set the standard by which games of its type are developed. And this is very much true to this day.

But this is not the EverQuest that you knew and loved in 1999, 2000, 2001. That EverQuest is gone. Verant interactive no longer exists. Sony Online Entertainment is now Daybreak Games. And Daybreak Games owns EverQuest. The closest thing that we have for classic EverQuest is Project 1999 (P99). If you want classic EverQuest, P99 is the way. If you miss EverQuest as it was in the early post-classic years, then the best that we have for it is The Al Kabor Project (TAKP).

Modern EverQuest isn't the same as it was. The game has changed, the player has changed, and the company has changed. Daybreak Games has done some good things and some bad things to try and keep up with the evolving MMORPG scene. But honestly? I'm genuinely glad that Daybreak Games is still working on EverQuest.

EQ can still be a lot of fun. The first 6-12 months of a time-locked progression (TLP) server will remind you a lot of how it used to be. You can still explore most of your old favorite zones on the standard servers as well, with AI mercenary sidekicks or a small group of friends. And if you stick it out, you might find yourself surprised that the newest content is actually quite fun. Again, unless you go into it expecting EQ the way you remembered it. You level faster now. Some things have been streamlined, or made ""easier."" Your jaw will drop at how easy it is to get great equipment and weapons at low levels.

EQ is an evolved beast.

Pros:
+ An incredible amount of content and lore (23 years of content!)
+ Some of the most unique and fun classes in the genre (e.g., necromancer)
+ The old character models still hold so much charm (you literally can't deny this)
+ Most of your favorite zones and favorite enemies are still there (the new Freeport is terrible though)
+ Your original characters are probably still around, and customer service is really great at restoring old accounts (I got 20+ year old characters back!)
+ The TLP servers are still a great bit of fun, if you don't stress to hit max level in the first few days.
+ The standard servers that you remember do not require a subscription, and old accounts were upgraded to ""Silver"" (more character slot) status a few years ago.
+ The subscription price is basically still the same as it has always been.

Cons:
- Some of the ""new"" (original Luclin) models are derpy as heck, and that hasn't been improved.
- The default UI is still bad. (But Daybreak is apparently modernizing the UI through the next 6-12 months.)
- Some of the newer zones are really bad. (Again, the new Freeport is perhaps the worst.)
- There is a cash shop in the game now, and there are some ""pay to win"" items (e.g., experience boost potions) in the game.
- Some of the mounts and player illusions are really immersion breaking. (I try to avoid them as much as possible.)
- On regular servers, most of the lower level zones are dead, except the tutorial. This can be great though, if you like to solo or ""molo"" (solo + AI mercenary).
- There are a more boxers in the game now, than what you would have remembered from 20 years ago. It's not so bad on standard servers, but it sucks hard on the TLP servers during the first few weeks.

All that being said -- it's still an incredible gaming experience, with a history and legacy rivaled only by World of Warcraft. Unless you insist on original zones and a gameplay feel as close to classic EverQuest as possible, you may find modern EverQuest to be a lot of fun.

My Rating:
C+ for this version of EverQuest on live servers.
B- for this version of EverQuest on TLP servers.
B+ for the TAKP version of EverQuest
A- for the Project 1999 version of EverQuest.

Where the game really shines above others in how natural it is to group up.  Finding a group that is not in a dungeon or a raid is easy.  Each class has so much utility or purpose that you are likely to be wanted somewhere if you ask. 

Trying to pick a new main but  love the Bard, Cleric, warrior, shaman and wizard so much. Playing 9 different classes at once and really like them all.

Everquest live is a botting money pit, you will buy a krono and sell it to someone and then buy the prog/PL/or gear from the person that bought the krono from you. The economy is controlled by a handful of very hardcore players, the devs can’t keep up with the game, the server lag is immense and loading times are ridiculous. The new “content” being put out now is a copy of the older zones but with much less work and no heart. (EoK to ToL so far). The only reason the game is still alive is because if people buying krono and Bags on the TLP’s. the TLP’s only last for 4-5 months and then a new one comes out. So that DB can keep selling bags and krono. DB doesn’t care about your player experience, they care about your wallet. Enough of grinding away on the same 3 camps for 300 hours at a time. Your done.  Even the casual end game scene is ass. All you will be doing is joining someone’s box and AFKing half the times because their 3rd party software has coded their cleric to heal better than you can.
The game is FULL to the brim with boxers, it’s the only way a lot of players can get the loot and XP they want. They main a Shadow Knight, and have 5 others boxed classes that do all the damage and healing for them, its literally cheating, but DB doesn’t care because that boxer is paying for 5 subscriptions. 
Botting/boxing brings me to another point. Some people sell “power levels” and charge by the hour. I myself have boughten a few hours of power leveling and all it is, is a botte raid group farming the same mobs as they respawn. The “player” owning the botted toons doesn’t even have to look at his monitor.
Ive group with raid geared healers that “go auto pilot” while afk and heal the group fine because of 3rd party botting software . THE GAME IS FULL OF BOXERS AND BOTTING CHEATERS, THE ECONOMY IS FUCKED AND SO IS THE SERVER LAGD. DB will be spitting out re runs of old expansions and the servers cant take it anymore. Goodbye Everquest live, empires of kunark to terror of luclin. 2,800 hours of grind and telling myself the game isn’t dead. Spending so much money on krono and cosmetics to eventually feel unsatisfied again and again. Its been real and its been good but it hasn’t been real good. The only part of Everquest that is alright to play is the TLP server's that arn't free to play, they dont allow boxing and botting, even though the economy is somewhat janky because of krono. if your gonna play Daybreak games everquest play the TLP's and stay far away from the live servers

This game continued to challenge you with the superb AA system (technically it meant level's went past 15,000 plus) along with the multitude of challenging raids and locked flagging progression zones and raids you had to continue to do once you did reach max level (having 2 seperate xp bars unlock at 51 was a masterstroke, since copied, but not to the extent EQ advanced it!)

If Everquest ever had a issue it was purely that it was TO daunting for people to ever try to get into with simply far to much content and incredibly crude early world zones (and UI!!)  that were'nt ever brushed up making them look horrendously bad, when the actual end game zones stand up pretty well to more modern MMO's (certainly some the character and monster models are pretty decent in EQ, although backdrops in general VERY poor).

It's never been beaten as any hardened MMORPG veteran will tell you, and i don't think it ever will on pure content, design and depth, as well as challenge, and truthfully it never will. 

This game will likely never truly ever die as it truly is one of a kind, anyone who did'nt like it never could of played it for longer than 6 month's which truly was how long you had to play it to truly actually understand what a gem it was (or simply is a GFX's fan boy and not really a true MMORPGer)

A clear 10 out of 10 game and well deserving of it's title to all true MMORPG'ers of the one that started it all and the grandaddy of all MMORPG's.

Sometimes it will, other times it won't for no good reason. Oh and if you don't ""Return Home"" when you try it log in, the problem could start all over again. So if it took you a half hour to run to where you crashed, luck you...you get to do it all over again. Also watch out for terrain bugs too where you get stuck in an invisible wall that will force you to /rewind or gate because you tried to go over a hill instead of around it.

The current owners of the game seem uninterested in fixing any of these issues leaving their customers to deal with their sloppy job.

I'd come back after years off because I really loved this game, but I'm leaving once more because it's just not worth my time and energy to put up with the mess it has become.

I picked a recommended server, so there should have been people, but I hardly saw anyone, even in the starting town.  And the starting town was a huge disappointment.

And there lies the second disappointment.  The new starting town seems to be the place to be, where all the quests are, all the action.  From what I saw, you don't have to go beyond that one zone for at least half a character's leveling life.  I went out into the world, visited a few of my favorite old zones and towns and I saw no one, not a single player out there, I saw no evidence of updates to loot or quests.  It was all like the old EQ where you were ecstatic to get a +2WIS ring at level 10, while the new -newbie- armor that I got in the tutorial had stats like +5 to ALL on a hat.

While there was a few before it, none captured peoples minds and attention like this game did.  The challenge to stay alive at young age is one of the most difficult of any rpg and while many complained it was TOO hard, herein lies the truth.  The difficulty did not ruin the game, it made all the more rewarding when you did finish a long quest or finally get that epic you camped for an entire month. In games like Warcraft, epic weapons drop on the Ground, while instantly gratifying for a few fleeting moments, it never gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you went on an adventure to get it. In everquest, you get that sense,  and the challenge is what makes the game so much more rewarding than any game before or after.  The graphics may be old and cheesy, but there is a long wealth of class and race options and endless ways you can build your character around a certain weapoin and playstyle., The long quests, the absolute terror you feel running from Freeport to Qeynos as a human who cant see in the dark almost gives it a horror movie like suspense.

Its still has the magic of EQ which every other MMORPG failed to copy.

In EQ, you do not want to die. You do whatever you can, NOT TO DIE.
Its the opposite of WoW =).

Even with the very old graphics, it still got its charm, and graphics doesnt matter if your core game mechanics are not good. Or the company gets bought to someone who put in a cash store.

Everquest still is the best MMORPG, because of it is hard to do stuff. And you loose levels if you die, etc.

Never played EQ?
Ok, Which one these do you prefer?

1. You loved WoW. How fast and good things where, how you could just que automaticly for groups and dont pay much attention.

2. You loved ESO, Conan, Eve, an open world that kicks your butt no matter how much you zerg.
And you enjoy working for your char where your personal skills in playing is a big factor.

Now,
If you are nr 1, stay FAAAAR away from Everquest!

If you like nr 2.

One major downside to this game is something called ""Krono"" which is like Plex in EVE and WoW Tokens. However they are more like Plex in how they are a tradeable currency with real money value so there has been a lot of toxic people play the game to earn money from it; this means ruining a lot of the old school experience sadly.

This game actually encouraged hard work with slower rewards.
GRANTED this is definitely more of a nostalgia game, but they have added more tools to help with soloing (Mercenaries etc).  It's still quite fun, but may take a little longer customizing your User Interface.
Some people mention maps being an issue, but all you need to do is download Brewall's Maps and select them for zones that don't provide a map (most are rather comprehensive).

Some of the other features do take getting used to, but anyone who used to play EQ can easily adapt and relearn. (i.e. players who actually had gaming etiquette and weren't complete trolls like half the gamers nowadays)

Some people will say it's slow, etc, but patience is a virtue.   World of Warcraft became extremely boring to me over time (no matter how many maxed characters I had, the most fun was in leveling newer characters as opposed to doing repetitive daily quests).

So many games provide faster leveling and more flashy loot in a shorter amount of time, but where is there any satisfaction in what you've achieved?  

Give the game a shot if you're looking for something that might actually be more similar to D&D without making things overly simplified (even D&D online was questionable)..

Everquest will make you raise individual skills, including language skills, depending upon what you want to accomplish.  Including some of the ALternative Advancement (AA) skills, you can make more basic skills somewhat useful for certain situations.  Or learning to disarm or intimidate enemies may be useful.

I was aware of its' legacy and how immersive the world was eager to jump in. I have had experience in other MMOs that were popular at the time for me like WoW, DDO, LoTR, GW, etc. so I knew the ""ropes"" of the genre. EQ proved to be a different beast...Let start by saying I very much enjoy this game and I can say I enjoy it on level that others just never did for me but it is not without a fairly steep learning curve (IMO). 

With the game being 20 years old I knew going into this that it would be a bit of chunky experience and for me that was true. While all the ""features"" of any MMO are there, they are often hard to find sometime or overtly ""manual"" which in itself was a reason many of my friends moved on from the game while I tried and tried again. This is a game that requires patience to play but is deeply rewarding once one overcomes the learning curve. To that end I strongly recommend the tutorial with the understanding that personally I found it a boring slog. Once you get into Norrath however, the game shines. There is a sense of exploration, drawing map in a dungeon as you move through it, reading quests and learning the names of locations and NPCs and I enjoyed the slow pace of it all. Rather than rushing from one quest to another and another with the goal of racing to the end, this game embodies the ""it is not a race but a marathon"" mindset. No you  do not need to buy any of DayBreak currency or items as they do not impact your ability to the play the game, rather this game was slow paced by design. I feel as if I know more about the areas I have explored in this game thanany other MMO because without quest markers, or UI directional overlays I have to read and understand each aspect. I have to learn how to move through zones and how they connect. 

All in all I have only done a few dungeons so far and have barley scratched the surface. For patience players looking for a piece of history, and a game that rewards the loyal, EQ worth exploring. With a low (free) cost of entry the game should be a ""must have"" in everyone's library and should be experienced at least once.

If you want to come back to this game or are a new player I recommend subscribing and playing on the newest progression server, whichever it may be at the time. Progression servers launch with non expansions available and slowly release a new expansion every few months so it is as if you are playing everquest back in the day waiting for the next expansion to come out. I have a blast every time I create new characters on progression servers and level alongside everyone else trying to level and farm items to sell, make some plat, buy better gear and so on. Progression servers do require an active membership which is the only drawback.

-LIVE SERVERS-
I can't speak much for live servers(non-progression), as I quit playing when they came out with ""Autogrant""  alternate advancement (AA) points. If you have an active subscription on live and have auto grant enabled you automatically gain all AA points you need for your level up to a certain level. Imagine spending thousands of hours grinding AA points and feeling accomplished that you have 2800 aa's and then they release an expansion that automatically gives these points to everyone automatically for free when they level. Boy did that make me quit playing this game for a while. Also, like any gaming company, they release new content for a price and enable certain perks with the new content which makes you almost have to purchase the new content to stay relevant. I would stay away from the cashgrab of live servers and stick to progression. In my opinion.",1574715783,1574715783,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you play Everquest, Please consider subscribing to Everquest. The reason why is because you can play on the many populated time locked servers for a more classic experience, where your playing with real people. The free live servers on the other hand are often dead and most people playing them are at max level, so in order to do the content you have to hire an npc mercenary to power you through the content which isn't that fun. 

10/10 experience easily!

PS, There is also a private server for Everquest called Project Quarm which is a lot better than the live servers for Everquest or even the time locked servers and accurately represents the game from 1999 if your looking for a more classic experience.

What really sucks is because of kronos all there is in the game now in pugs is greedy people ninja looting all your class spec. loot from you. You have to roll need against a bunch of greedy players in hopes of getting a spell or a piece of loot. It doesn't matter what it is, they're going to roll against you 99.9 percent of the time.

Skip to the bolded italics if you're a returning player and just want to understand what EQ means by ""free."" If you're having trouble with a new account, remember to verify its email address!

I started playing EQ in 2000. I have at least a year and a half of real time spent in-game. My experience is positive, but that's partly because I started when it was the best show in town. I'm pretty sure I'll play it again, but I can't recommend it to new players. I've tried to get friends who have never played to join up over the past few years, and their responses to the initial experience have ranged from ""nah"" to ""I'm bored sick."" Every single one has quit. 

The problem is the new player experience. It's... stunted, even with friends (besides, anything is fun with friends). Most low level zones are empty of players, and some of the oldest are mostly empty space. Forming groups with other players for low level content takes time and effort, and you're not likely to run across other low level players once you've out-leveled the tutorial and the default starting city, which you should definitely use. Mid levels are a particularly isolating experience, since at that point you've outlasted other newbies and most people's alts are either low level or high level.

And goodness forbid you choose the ""wrong"" class to level. Unless you run multiple accounts, you're going to have a really dull time with some classes for the first 70-75 levels because their shiny stuff and even a lot of basic modern functions were added late in the game's history and never given effective low-level versions, so for some classes you mostly just stand near an enemy, waiting for it to die of auto-attacks. Brilliant.

Similarly, some classes can be hard to level by yourself even with a mercenary to help, or just hard to play effectively. And while there are shortcuts you can take and guides you can follow to make a lot of this better, it's not fun to have to master navigating the community, online info sites, and even the game's system folder (for adding map packs, a practical necessity) just to function well enough.

Plus, for all that you can jazz them up and make them work for you, the default UI is functional but clunky and the controls are pretty jank. And the community can be a bit... prickly. I mean that in the kindest way I can say it, but it's not for everyone.

Sadly, EverQuest hasn't kept up with the times. There are smarter, more polished experiences out there, with much better new player experiences, even without sacrificing depth of lore and breadth of content.



[b][i]If you've somehow made it this far and still want to play the game,[/i][/b] you have two meaningful choices. Please note that in either case, you will automatically gain all but the last couple of expansions for free. Good deal, right? When you reach level 100+, consider buying the latest expansion to unlock all current content. Previous expansion(s) included.


1) Play on any server with a subscription. Or at least, subscribe when you reach level 70+.

EverQuest's free model was never meant to last through high level content. Without a subscription, you can't really function much beyond chatting at high levels--you'll be locked out of a lot of alternate advancement points, higher-ranked versions of spells, strong mercenary companions, and even a lot of high level equipment. Think of it like World of Warcraft's max level 20 free trial but with chat enabled.


2) Play on the Test server without a subscription (you'll have to change the game version to Test in your launcher settings). 

Test is a slightly different game version where you get most of the benefits of a subscription (minus the monthly free microtransaction currency) for free. Your old characters can be /testcopy 'd to Test at no risk. Your characters on Test won't be wiped, and bugs are generally not game-breaking. The cherry on top is always-on double experience gains. The community is small and short on raiding, but extremely casual-friendly, which is probably what you're looking for if you want to play a game for free.

Thanks for reading! If you've struggled to get into EQ yourself or you've had any luck getting new people into the game, I'd love to hear from you.",1558495536,1569189147,False,299,5,0.851109623908996582,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I downloaded this ""free to play"" game only to discover you need a membership to play on their nostalgia server (which is the only reason people like me would be interested in this 20 year old game). That's fine, since ""free"" doesn't mean free anymore, and so I was willing to pay for a month or so to relive some old gaming experiences...

The Daybreak website must be run on hamsters on wheels, because each page I tried to navigate through took several minutes to load. I finally go to their membership page, and the only option I was given was an ""all access"" pass for $15 a month. Since I was only interested in playing Everquest again, I did not want to pay $15 for ""all access"" to a bunch of their games which, frankly, suck. I wanted to see if they had a lower tier option as sometimes they hide those to force you to pay more than you have to, and so I tried to contact customer service:
 
I clicked on the link on their website, and even though I was already logged into their website, and even though their ""support"" page was part of this website, it asked me to log in again (and the login procedure on their website is a joke: it takes forever to load, and they make you do a Rorschach test of ""click all the boxes with streetlights or storefronts"").
 
...So after spending several minutes logging in again I tried to ask my question--it told me before I could ask a question I had to verify my email address even though they had already verified it when I made the account. I clicked on ""verify account"", and then they said they'd email me a link with a secret question. That email of course never came.
 
My E-trade account has less stringent security measures. Either Daybreak's website was designed by a troupe of nose-picking monkeys, or they just want to set up so many hoops you have to jump through that you'll give up trying to contact customer support and then they won't have to hire someone for that position.

Needless to say, I didn't want to try this game so much as to deal with their incompetence, so I said eff it. I was annoyed enough to write this review however. If a company can't get something as basic as a website right, I don't want to deal with everything else they've messed up.

1. The world seemed so big because getting around meant traveling by foot or by boat, unless you made a friend who could teleport to specific locations.
2. Dying meant having to find your corpse, naked, so you could get your stuff back. It wasn't easy.
3. Finding a group meant talking in chat and making friends.
4. You could not kill most things without at least one other partner.
5. Healing and buffs were powerful and appreciated.
6. Only 8 spells could be memorized at any given time.
7. Classes were distinct and unique with little overlap.
8. Servers had fairly small populations that got to know each other over time.
9. Rare spawns, rare items, these meant negotiating and sharing with others.
10. If there was a grind, it wasn't noticeable, because you were never alone.

I played this for YEARS before it ported to Steam. I have *thousands* of hours of play time. It changed a LOT over the years.

Why am I recommending an outdated and archaic game?

That's easy - because this was one of the games that really started it all. Preceded by only Ultima Online and before that text based MOOs, MUDs, and MUSHes.

You don't play a game like this for the graphics - they were top for their day, they're painfully dated now. You play this for nostalgia. You play this for a real challenge and an arseload of content. You play this to understand what us old geezerly gamers are talking about when we say ""back in our day...""

If you want to experience an 80-person raid WITHOUT VOICE CHAT? You want to understand what guild dynamics really means? You can still get a taste of it here. Of course, technology has advanced - and gone are the days of 8 hour raids and perfectly timed text macros... but in this game you'll get a taste of what it's like to navigate without a map - having to *memorize* your entire game world. And yes, you can simply fire up Vent or Discord and rock on. But, it's fun to really go full nostalgia.

You'll actually have to do the legwork yourself (provided you don't wimp out and go for Google). In the end - this is a game best played for nostalgia. To rediscover the love of gaming not for graphics - but for CONTENT. It's a lot to choke down if you're the kind of gamer that grew up on games you could max out your levels on (eg: WoW) in a week, or had everything handed to you - or are all flash and pomp and beatable in a week or less...

I have something like 12,000 hours played at this point, with probably another few thousand to come.

Now I'm at a point in my life where I can't really lead raids or a guild effectively due to time constraints, but even if I just want to solo or maybe join a casual guild, I have plenty of fun doing that.

Je comprends qu'il y ait des gens qui y ont passés des milliers d'heures.
On voit tout de suite d'où WoW à tiré son inspiration. (Blibli s'est VRAIMENT pas foulé...)

avantages:
-univers enchanteur pour l'époque.
-des mécaniques de jeu fondatrices du genre.
-un ""lore"" interessant s'y on s'y attarde.
-un aspect plus communautaire que les MMORPG d'aujourd'hui.
-énormément de choses à faire (crafting, leveler, découverte...).
-des races ""non humaines"" appréciables (ce qui se fait rare de nos jours...).

inconvénients:
-le jeu qui nous pousse à l'abonnement dès la PREMIERE seconde en jeu.
-mécaniques de jeu dépassées (caméra, animations, poids de l'équipement?!, des zones qui manquent littéralement de map pour se diriger...etc) .
-le GRIND.
-l'interface, même si elle à été revue, est quand même obsolète.
-LE GRIND.
-le taux de ""miss"" des armes à bas level inacceptable.
-LE GRIND pour quasiment tout les aspects du jeu!
-les mercenaires, bonne idée au départ, font que chacun joue un peu dans son coin au final.

Conclusion:
Ce jeu est très bon pour se faire une idée de ce qui se faisait en 1999: une excellente expérience dans un très bon univers. Parfait aussi pour les mazos du GRIND à outrance où les zombies qui ont choisi de vivre comme option.

Because you can also get titles, illusions, ornaments (changes looks), and even auras with cash and minimal effort, it takes away individuality and ""cool factors"". Spent 200 hours to get a super cool illusion? Doesn't matter. Pay $5 and you can get an even cooler illusion, like turn into a harpy or monster, rendering any hard-earned items useless.

Daybreaker of Games also killed EverQuest: Next and laid off the people that made EQ.... EQ.

Used to be my favorite game of all time. I even liked SOE's early take on it (didn't love it, but it was still wonderful). However, Daybreak's EQ is depressingly bad. On the bright side, I can finally quit!

Think of Everquest as the original MMORPG, because that's essentially what it is. It's a clunky three dimensional romp through a rather large and colorful world filled with all sorts of things to stab repeatedly like a crack-addicted rogue looking for high on the body of a recently deceased toad.

That being said, this isn't quite the same game I recall. The overall game play has remained exactly what it was when I played in the days of yore, but with a twist. The game has become largely free-to-play, lending to an optional subscription model. What isn't explicitly stated is that the F2P access is stunted by the sheer absence of players on any given part of the map. Finding a player on an F2P server is about as easy to do as extracting a decaying tooth from a live bear without tranquilizing it first.

The secondary problem lies with a fact that burns at the very core of my disheveled heart: this game now has loot boxes. Not only does that leave a sour taste in my mouth, but it also cheapens the memories I had of killing the same enemies repeatedly in hopes of getting a drop that might actually be beneficial. Loot boxes might seem desirable to a naive nubile player who hasn't been around the block yet, but for a battle-hardened cynic like myself it just reminds me of how much the gaming world has gone to hell in the last decade.

That being said, if you're willing to overlook these fatal flaws or are willing to pay for the subscription, it's certainly worth your while, at least until whatever your next fancy happens to come off early-access as a fully developed game.",1522529854,1659412530,True,4,1,0.534809768199920654,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The reason why is because not many people play between those levels and so I have to solo everything even with the help of mercenaries it is still difficult.

Live (Vox)-
Got two characters to level 40 something fairly quickly.  Gear drops like an ARPG, makes it mean less when something drops.  Easy mode with mercs, group play is all but non-exsisting. It was a fun little theme park ride through Crescent Reach zone, doing quests, amassing wealth, collecting gear.  Then I realized it wasn't challenging and it was very single-player.  So I decided to join Agnar progression server, for a more authentic EQ experience. 

Progression (Agnar)-
Leveled a warrior to 48.  It took a great deal more time to level up than on the live server.  It felt like I was making progress at a decent rate.  I explored some neat zones with some awesome enemies.  Spent a great deal of time in camps with full groups to take on enemies because it was REQUIRED to do so.  This was a good thing.  Until you can't find a group.  Until you have to fight/invis your way through an entire dungeon to get to the camp spot.  Until someone dies and they are practically lost to the group.  
After spending so much time grinding mobs in various different camps I realized that it was the same thing over and over again. I finally reached a massive dungeon zone referred to as ""Velks"".  This place was huge, confusing, dangerous, and I was excited to finally be here. I spent some time at the enterence of the zone in a camp killing spiders.  Hours.  I finally leveled up enough to move to a more forward camp of the zone.  After navigating this annoying slippery ledged zone, I reached my new camp, finally, a change of scenery at least!  Alas, I was expected to kill more spiders.  I did the math after slaying one of these enemies:

1% XP towards next level per one spider killed.
130 seconds spent killing each spider.
216 minutes per level.
At least 5 more levels before I change camps.

I'm sorry, but this game is not fun.  It may have been for it's time, but this mechanic and obvious time sink, just isn't worth it. You do the same thing, every fight, every camp, every zone.  Group composition doesn't change the flow or tactics.  There is nothing different from killing frogs in Uguk to killing spiders in Velks.  
Tank aggros mob. 
CC role CCs other mobs.
Team damages main mob. 
Healer heals team.
Mob dies.
Grab the next mob.
Until you just can't do it anymore and go play a different game, with more interesting mechanics.",1515047077,1515047235,False,11,6,0.474022537469863892,5,False,False,False,False,,,

Yeh, I did share the account with her and She had her Calashar Du'Shadikan. For me?  I was done with EQ, because of Drama on Cazic Thrull and other issues. 

BUT! I came back a year later around 2000. Bought the CD's again and reinstalled. This was back when Sony Entertainment owned EQ. So I rerolled my Character on a TOTALLY new account. Started to fall in Love with EQ! This was on Xegony. I feel into the Evercrack life with Raids and leveling. This game was just.. SO much fun.

I really cannot recommend this game enough, even to younger players, as long as you can get past the dated graphics.

It's an incredible, challenging, and immersive experience, though I personally prefer their progression servers or P99, current EQ is still pretty great.

It's a little hand-holdy on live these days, so it's not /quite/ as sandbox as it used to be (still more than most games though), but on the progression servers, or P99 especially, it's a challenging, hardcore experience.

EQ is pure old school, there is none of that ""x"" marks the spot on the map just to see where the next objective is. 

The only con so far is the Free to Play restrictions, which means you will have a hard time without that trustworthy J5 merc and not being able to use rank 2 or higher spells, this also includes not maxing up to level 110 and getting the aa's

But you can either pay a monthy gold membership if you are on a live server or switch to the test server where you get the gold perks for free.

This game has 25 expansions which = to piles and piles of content to keep you happy. Loads of quests and missions.

The players on this game are really nice, people is always helpful in answering questions in the public chat, plenty of wizards and druids around as well, they will be happy to port you anywhere and grouping is never an issue, just remember you cannot be too high of a level to group with someone, otherwise the other party will not get the exp.

I started playing in March of 1999 as a dark elf magician. I got up to level 36 and then made a dark elf necromancer instead and played dark elf necromancers for the rest of my EQ time.

I remember Kunark and Velious, I mostly ignored Luclin and then I quit in the Planes of Power era, this was around 2004. I came back for a month in 2008 but the game had changed so much that I did not stay.

I came back in March of 2017 because I saw a FB advertisement about a free boost to 85 and I saw that EQ was free to play on Steam.

I installed EQ and logged onto my level 64 necromancer for the first time in almost 10 years and was a bit overwhelmed with everything. It took me some time to get used to the user interface and all of the different windows, I boosted to 85 which also gave me a lot of spells and AA skills that I didn't have before. It also gave me several expansions that I did not have before.
I spent a lot of time organizing my spells and skills as well as my various in game menus and windows and more time figuring out what they all did.

I got used to my character again and visited old zones like Najena, Lower Guk and Sebilis just to help me remember how to fight, hunt and loot.
I've had fun exploring old places that used to be so hard (like the plane of fear) as well as old expansions that I had never used before.
I'm also having fun exploring old zones that I used to go to although some of the zones have been changed (Ocean of Tears, North and South Ro deserts and the Oasis of Marr for examples).

It's free which means that I don't have to pay for it unless I want to and there is a market place where I can buy things like mounts, illusions and various other things.

Most WoW clones are indirect clones of Everquest, since WoW itself is a clone of Everquest if you want to know how awesome Everquest was.

As the years went by, though, Everquest became less and less fun to play due to becoming a clone of WoW..which is kind of a paradox, I guess since WoW is a clone of Everquest, so Everquest is now an indirect clone of itself.. I mean, SOE was desperate because both EQ and EQ2 were dying because of WoW overshadowing them and so they did the only thing they thought was reasonable and so they became more like WoW... which in the long run, hurt their business greatly.. because now we got Daybreak, which is a terrible company.. Almost as bad as Nexon which is just really sad.

Everquest is ""the"" MMO game that has shaped the entire genre alongside Ultima Online. There is no other game with so much attention to detail, so much game content and so much variety.

What makes (old) Everquest different from most of today's MMOs is that you have to use your brain.
In modern times you will be shown where the quest begins and ends
(Kill 10 xy or collect 10 xy and bring them back to me) - cool thing! The maximum level is either achieved in 2 weeks via hardcore gaming or you simply use a guide 72Hours to max level!!! - Hurray!!!

-.-


Due to the many ""simple"" MMOs (WoW comes first) that are now available and the greater need to simply sit down in front of the PC, click wildly on the mouse and follow the instructions on the screen, the makers (not that Everquest's original development team) partially decided to jump on the big train.

A lot of things have unfortunately made some of the old Everquest flair disappear

- 1000s of players on different servers. No matter where you were, you always had enough people to chat, hang out, or just to ""grind""
- Character leveling up was a lengthy process- not a primary one but a by-product of questing or further ""upgrading"" the character.
It was normal to take several days for a level up. With my first character I had a playtime of 124 days (124*24 hours) and reached level 57 (at that time the highest level was 60)
-Not the Leveling was in the foreground but the common questing or raiding.
-When you died, the corpse with your gear stayed where you died. If you didn't manage to get to your own corpse within a certain time, everything was gone! (everything loot all objects simple everything. ;-)
- Sometimes you walked around for hours just to explore the world or to advance a quest - or you just hang up in bazaar and played /random 100 games for the chance to win plat from other players

It was a unique experience to have been part of the development of a new genre through this game.

The biggest negative point I can think of about Everquest is the time you ""have to"" invest to be right in the middle of it instead of just being there.



Anyone who played Everquest in the early years knows what I'm talking about. This game doesn't deserve negative reviews about poor usability or bad graphics.

This game is a classic!!

Occasionally I look at my old server (which has already been merged with other servers several times) and I still see many old names that I know from the past :-) Unfortunately I don't have the time to play Everquest.

Heah! I don't have the foggiest idea what was worse to play back then...This or Eternal Lands...Gee, it's to bad I can't rant about Eternal Lands here on Steam! Anyway, here goes: I found this game when I was looking for game images of scarecrows online and saw a good scarecrow game image on Everquest. This in addition to the multitude of Classes and content available, which the game apparently has to offer made me want to play it. To bad it didn't turn out to be the great game I expected it to be. Here's why...

1: Download takes to long on slower computers. Period.
2: Leveling up takes way to long! Even when following an online guide I found, it was just taking to long.
3: Dying is to risky and even though you don't lose items when you die (At least I don't think), you do lose experience, so this means you have to do even more grinding. And if you have certain abilities active while running past (Would be) friendly NPC's, they WILL attack you! They'll probably kill you in one strike as well.
4: Tutorial does very little to help you. It does not teach you enough about the game (Like how to change the camera views, adjust sound and music volumes, how to quickly gain experience, etc...) and what little it does teach you does not offer you very good rewards for completing it.
5: The Kobolds at the start of the game are among the dumbest-looking monsters I think I've ever seen! Also, the monsters tend to get in your face when you're fighting them. Plus, when you're fighting them, the animations look robotic and artificial. And speaking of which...
6: The game is best played in 1st person perspective and if you don't like it, you CAN change the camera views, but all the other camera view points are even worse than the first person view point. And as for the first person view point, it looks like I'm playing as a gnome or a dwarf or some other short character race instead of a human (The race I was playing as).
7: Some of the game controls are restricted to having to press certain keys. For example, every time you want to chat, you have to click in the box before typing your message!! So damn annoying! Furthermore, you have to press a certain Enter key. Yes, it does matter which enter button you press. And my keyboard of the time was missing one of its enter buttons so I had to use a pen cap to activate the key. Also, there is no way to change this as far as I can tell! And to make this even worse, you actually have to type things out to NPC's!
8: Completing quests can be annoying cause you have to 'use' certain items on NPC's and worse yet, they do not accept stacked items, so you have to manually separate any stacked items you have before giving them to an NPC.
9: Certain items cannot be dropped or traded and must be destroyed. And in order to destroy them, you have to click on the item and 'move' it to a VERY small destroy button on your inventory window.
10: Is there pay-to-win content here? Oh, Hell yes! Just give them a certain amount of money, and you'll be rocketed all the way to Level 85! Gee, pa! They forgot to say 'halt'!

Case in point, if you're new to this game, you'll be struggling to figure out a sound strategy to make the most of it at best or throwing your keyboard across the room in frustration at worst when you realize you don't stand a chance against most of those pug-fugly Kobolds anyway.

The amount of hours that Steam has tracked don't do me any justice. That being said, Everquest has some serious problems. There was a time when I would have recommended the game and I have recommended the game. That time is past.

Pros: 
- A good community. The community overall is full of nice and helpful people. Yes, there is some people who definitely don't fit that description but they are few and far between.

- The game being modeled after tabletop D&D. The fact that somebody can have a max level character with all the best stuff in the game and still miss/have attacks dodged by lower level mobs is hilarious. 

Cons:
- Servers. This has been a hot topic lately on both the forums and in game. The last several months especially there has been a ton of problems with servers crashing regularly and lagging. Additionally, the other major problem server related is the fact that they continue to create new servers when the game's population is relatively small. With the introduction of progression servers a lot of guilds on the regular servers have disappeared entirely which has also snowballed into people quitting the game because the rest of their friends moved on to progression servers. The developers of this game only seem to pay attention to the latest and greatest progression servers while the regular servers suffer badly. I speak from experience on this as my guild of 14 years went from about 40-50 regular raiders down to about 3 other people online every now and then besides myself. Daybreak has done an excellent job of destroying long established communities.

- Customer Service. Customer service since Daybreak took over for Sony has been hit and miss at best. Where the GM's used to help you with everything no problem now you sometimes get a GM that says ""sorry, just do it again."" or ""sorry, just wait for a fix.""

- Expansions. The expansions are a copy and paste disaster of already existing content. The last 10 expansions have been primarily copy and pasting of mobs while simply increasing the numbers (I.E. the mobs levels and how hard they hit). This sadly applies to the raid content as well as the vast majority of raid mobs have become humans or other playable races. The imagination factor of creating beastly looking creatures to slay is gone and dead.

- Lack of communication. The developers don't have a whole lot to say in regards to these issues. The only things they talk about for the most part are their ""new"" progression servers where you have the ability to start all over again. Additionally, when you add the game to Steam the most recent news is from back in 2013 where they announce the launch of Call of the Forsaken. They haven't had any news to add to steam in 4 years evidently. (I guess The Darkened Sea, The Broken Mirror and Empires of Kunark weren't news worthy expansions.)
***EDIT: There's no doubt that the progression servers are still very much EverQuest's ""baby"" but they have started posting news to Steam once again.

- Lag. If you play with any sort of graphics on the game actually runs pretty badly. I got my computer sometime around 2012-2013 and play with all the newest models and spell graphics on (as you should be able to do in any game, especially one as old as EQ). I use the Steam FPS meter to monitor how well the game performs and in group content FPS ranges anywhere from 15-60 with an average of about 25 FPS. On raids FPS will range anywhere from 0 (the meter simply disappears)-15 FPS. To put things in perspective, heres a list of my PC specs:
[list]
[*]Intel Core i7 3930k @ 3.20GHz
[*]2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660
[*]32 GB RAM
[/list]
*EDIT: Since I listed these PC specs I have since had one of 660's die. I upgraded to 1x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 and gained virtually nothing for doing so.  I notice maybe 1 more FPS over my above mentions. (Benchmark: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/20295692?)*
**EDIT: Recently upgraded my entire computer. i7-6950X, 2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and 131 GB RAM. Nothing has changed. I've never played a game that runs so poorly. I would think given my PC's specs it would run so good I'd have to turn on V-sync but that's not even close to the case. (Benchmark: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/20373384?)**

- Graphics. The game still very much looks like an old Playstation 1/Playstation 2 game. The graphics were good for back when this game was created. Some of the graphics were even upgraded to look better in 2001. However, there hasn't been any modernization improvements since then. Games today like RIFT and Elder Scrolls Online are significantly more pleasant to look at. Additionally, when you first enter a zone the game has a tendency to zone you in before any of the textures load.

I thought I would go back and see what has happened to the game since 2004 - and I was having a great time playing it too.  It's a little more user friendly now-a-days and it copied a bunch from multiple MMO's in terms of the UI and quests that are available.  It even updated its graphics a bit.  

My problem came when I tried to buy a months membership to  Daybreak games through what they call Kronos.  This is when things went downhill.  I thought I would support the game and get some of the benefits of being a member - a win win.  This is when I got banned.  They gave me zero notification about the ban, not even an email.  Through their page I was told I needed to make a new account to put in a ticket and contest the ban.  I did that close to a week ago and still have yet to hear back from their support team. I even entered an second ticket and sent multiple emails.  It's a bit ridiculous.  Apparetly if you fat finger some numbers on a credit card account, it doesn't deny the charge like any other game or website  (again I just assume this is what happened to me)- it just bans you outright and give you no rhyme or reason.

[h1]Semi-official, possibly tangential, review; by an unimportant clod you don't care about:[/h1]
[b]Audio:[/b] 4/10
Alright, some of Everquest's music is so much a part of my earlier years that I smile when I hear it.  Then I remember why I turned off loading screen music after the fourth or fifth time loading, and fix the discrepancy.  Nostalgiac, yet annoying.

At some point in the past few years the developers added a lot of new audio files for combat, some zones, and the character select screen.  Some of them are great, some are just ok, most are nothing to write home to mom about.

Banshees and skeletons are annoying.  Like, [i]valley girl movie[/i] annoying, oh my god.

Most people play on Mute or with other noise in the background (movies/tv, music, voice chat, etc.)  The exception is during raid events, where some of the more serious players will set audio triggers to fire whenever an event emote is set off.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Originally, 2/10 - Currently, 5/10
These are definitely one of the biggest complaints people have, but if you'd played in the original days you would have a much higher opinion of the graphics they've been able to squeeze out of this archaic engine.  Spend a few days translating the instructions for ""Project 1999"" and get on a classic server, playing with original graphics, and you'll pop some confetti when you come back to modern EQ.  Katta Castrum: Deluge does not shake occasionally as part of lore, ignore that event text.  It shakes at the memory of how crap the entire game used to look.

If you refuse to play the game based on its looks alone you'll never find the actual value of the game buried under months of personal experience and character growth.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 8/10
This is where the game shines, in spite of its age.  There are a few glaring issues for me, which is why it falls to 8/10, but those could be fixed in a rebuild of the game.  The (complex) potential of most characters in this game takes a long time or a great teacher to figure out.  If someone takes the approach of dressing in the best gear and reading a build guide they can survive, but will never thrive and amaze their fellow players.  Experimentation and challenge lead to discovery, and to game-breaking designs. [spoiler]*cough* nerf bat! *cough*[/spoiler]

Pros -[list]
[*]Characters of the same class can feel pretty different depending on how each player builds their clickies, AA choices, spells prepared, etc.
[*]Most classes are not shoehorned into a specific role, because there are so many alternatives available.  There is no ""this is the caster DPS class, that is the melee DPS class, you can't tank unless you play one of these"" situations.  The game has multiple DPS options, multiple healer options, multiple tank options, and most of them can change roles on the fly.
[*]Alternate Advancement points don't just make your character tougher, they can completely change the way you play the game.  The rate and frequency of their gain can also change the power of your character at any given level.  If you go for max levels and then start gaining AA you will be made of paper, but if you max out your AA every 1-5 levels you can be easily 4-5x tougher than an equally-leveled character of your class.[/list]

Cons -[list]
[*]Slay Undead. [spoiler]wait... what?[/spoiler]  That's right, the ability that most clearly defines a Paladin in the upper levels.  ""But your second biggest toon is a Paladin!""  And?  The problem is not the ability, it's the implementation and ensuing problems it has created.   Here's how it works...

There are two ""Knights"" in EQ.  Shadowknights and Paladins.  They share most weapons and have roughly equivalent armor and AA/Spell lines.  The problem is that Slay Undead is tied to the base damage of a weapon instead of a subtype of damage like a Rogue's Backstab skill.  This means that when a Paladin or Shadowknight wields a weapon, we'll say base damage of 100, the Paladin can strike undead for massive amounts compared to the shadowknight.  This means undead need more HP than most mobs, and need to hit harder to be a threat to Paladins.  However, in order for a Shadowknight to then stand a chance against an undead mob, they need a weapon that does enough damage to not spend 10 minutes trying to beat it down.  But when they get more damage...  so does the Paladin...

Slay Undead should have been a subtype of damage like Backstab damage, with its own display on the weapon.  This would have helped avoid Con #2...

[*]Power Creep - Because each expansion the undead need to be stronger to survive the Paladin, everything else needs to be empowered so other classes can survive against them.  Spells do more damage, armor has higher stats, other weapons do more damage.

Because other classes are boosted to take on undead, the living mobs need to be strengthened in order to be a viable threat to the other classes.  Next expansion the undead ramp up more, so other classes need a bigger boost to survive them, which gives a bigger boost to Slay Undead, so the next expansion makes them even stronger. It's a cycle that saw strikes of 15-20k Slay Undead damage ramping up into the hundreds of thousands after a handful of expansions.  ""Current Content"" trash mobs that were hitting for 400 damage were boosted to 4500 damage after a few expansions, and now strike for 20,000 damage in the modern game.[/list]


[h1]Subjective Opinion:[/h1]
Everquest is a game unlike any other that I have played.  I've tried WoW and almost all of its clones.  I have played multiplayer Minecraft, persistent worlds in Neverwinter Nights, Path of Exile, Dungeons & Dragons: Eberron Unleashed, and a cartload of other multiplayer or MMO games, and nothing keeps my interest or brings me back once I've left, the way Everquest does.

Yes, it is 'ugly' compared to new games, but it runs on a game engine built in the early-mid 90's.  Yes, at 17 years old the developers have other games they are putting more effort into, can you blame them?  The code for the base game is so outdated that it's hard to keep adding content without causing one problem or another.  Yes, the playerbase has diminished due to graphics, cost of expansions, and the interactions with many of the more vocal players.

Most of the people I enjoy the game with are not vocal in general chat channels due to the outspoken negative personalities that dominate them.  I appreciate the quiet players that have bothered to learn their class, or are trying a new class and actively seeking feedback on how to play it better.  It can take weeks, sometimes months, to find a really solid group that you truly enjoy spending time with.  Most modern players lack the patience or social graces to ""put up with"" that time investment, because other MMO's are designed to reward them immediately.  Designed to keep pushing them to new things, new things, higher numbers, more new things, and they don't have to actually grind for their objectives.

I see some people complain about the content difference between current expansions and old expansions, but you do have to realize that the developers don't have to spend any time on this old game and people will still play it.  This isn't their flagship game and will not receive the majority of their attention, so the level of time and detail they do invest in keeping it running is amazing to me.  I do believe they could salvage it completely if they rebuilt Everquest with a few design tweaks in a modern engine, but kept the atmosphere and content mostly identical.

This game was absolutely amazing when it first launched and for the first four or five expansions. The current state of the game does leave much to be desired. The core gameplay has changed a bit and I feel there is not much of a challenge to the game any longer. I was a bit shocked to see how much the player base had dwindled and how many bots roam the landscapes of Norrath these days.

The game has turned in to a cash shop nightmare and has really taken the core elements away from the original spirit of Everquest. Some folks might find an enjoyable game, but with the addition of mercs, this really takes away from the entire point of making new friends to tackle content. I suppose some guilds might be active and still keep that spirit alive, but overall, this game has taken a huge plunge from the amazing game it once was.

It feels like you're playing a shadow of the original game these days. I was very disappointed with my return to the game and seeing everything that has changed. The time lock servers were fun for a little while and helped to capture some of the old school nostalgic moment, but the live version is out of control. I regret to say that Everquest might be appealing to some, but the dive in the player base speaks for what is has become.",1480262081,1480262081,False,4,0,0.537944555282592773,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's worth playing for anyone who is an MMORPG fan, if only just to see where the modern formula truly started.  It probably takes a bit of adjusting for modern MMO players, though you might be surprised how much you enjoy it.  There simply is 17 years of content that you can experience at your own pace.  Open world free-roaming games are becoming popular now and Everquest will appeal to those players somewhat.

WoW and EQ2 (launched the same month) both started the quest grinding pattern in MMOs (one of the few deviations from the EQ formula).  EQ has the original kill grind method.  In a lot of ways I like the kill grinding pattern better, until Old Republic quest grinding was novel for the first handful of hours but it becomes just as tedious as kill grinding.  Kill grinding on the other hand is much more straightforward... you kill things and you get exp.  This frees up quests to be more meaningful than level grinding, they are actually lore centered and/or item/reward centered for the most part (minus daily tasks etc).

This is where it all really started, it's worth playing just to experience a bit of MMORPG history... well and you might find a couple decades later it was worth it too.",1480149907,1480149907,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If guilds aren't your style you can ""box"" which is where you play multiple characters at once. Which may seem boring but actually in my opinion adds a lot of depth/decision making depending on the characters you play. The game is old, very old, but any information you seek on it is available. A huge problem I notice when I play with new players is they do not have the maps downloaded, if you do not have the maps downloaded getting around the world can be a struggle. Some may welcome the challenge of having no map. I would advise any new players to pick a class with access to pets/summons. These classes generally fair well on their own early on and later into the game, this allows you to learn the mechanics of the game. Everquest used to be fairly punishing if you died in game you had to do a corpse run to retrieve all of your hard earned gear, nowadays its just a loss of experience unless you make the corpse run or pay a npc to summon it for you. Once you hit about level 50 (max lvl is 110 w/ expansion) in game which should take you a few days you will need to decide if you want to pay the subscription fee to gain access to features such as ""AA"" alternate abilitys, some of these are passive increases and others are active skills. Sadly you need access to these for much later gameplay to be effective in level appropriate content. 
Overall I would give the game a try
If you really like its core mechanics and have kept in mind it is one of the oldest games and ofcourse one of the oldest mmo's and you have read this far and still do not like the concept of paying a sub fee to enjoy the full game.
I would advise you to look into Pantheon Rise of the Fallen a new MMO with old concepts

What people should understand is that EverQuest of old does not exist. There are emulated servers like P1999 that try to recreate the original EQ experience - that alone should tell you how much the current EQ has changed from its inception.

Today, the problems of top-heavy population are very real, and catastrophic for enjoyment of the game. 99% of zones and content are ghost towns, completely unused. 99% of quests and items are obsolete. The game now gives you equipment in ""starter packs"" that is better than anything you can quest for or loot in the early game. A bad solution to a real problem (no new players), which renders all content except the last couple expansions worthless. 1-75 content is just there to grind levels these days. Maybe even 1-90. If you need gear better than the game just gives you, you won't want to hunt for it. Instead, you'll want to hit the Auction House, which is full to bursting of better gear than you could ever loot for dirt cheap prices.

Agreed that this is not an MMO for new players. Frankly it's not even an MMO for many of us vets, who were around at the beginning. There are still some people playing - three or four chars at a time - but what keeps them going is often the amount they've already invested in the game. Splitting from characters you've invested literally years of your life into is not easy. But few will straight-up tell you that they enjoy the game as much as they ever did.

Don't. Only come back if you've played back in the day and you are returning for a nostalgia run. This is not an MMO you should visit if you've never played before. Why? Well, let's see:

[b]Terrible Developer Communication[/b]
-- The developers have poor communication with the community. They never explain what is happening when the servers are down, they never explain why they decided to take X path instead of Y path, they lock any threads on the official forums if you criticize them, and they don't reply to any threads outside of their own. Unacceptable and completely unprofessional.

[b]Outdated[/b]
-- If you've played back in the day then you'll be used to the graphics, thus you probably won't be too taken aback by how ugly EverQuest looks.

-- You also have the jumbled, unorganized, messy UI the game gives you. When you first log onto your character you'll be surprised how I wasn't exaggerating. It's that bad. I honestly think it's the worst UI out there from any other game I have ever played.

[b]Lazy Developers & Lack of Content[/b]
Another developer complaint? Yes! They deserve it. They are in charge of what direction the game is going, and they are always going down the wrong path. Incompetent?

-- Back when the first EverQuest expansion was released ('Kunark') you got 28 zones, that's right [b]28[/b] zones to explore and tackle. How many zones in the current expansion of EverQuest? In 'Empires of Kunark' you get.... [b]7[/b] zones! Hahaha... It's hard not to laugh when you compare the two. This expansion takes place on the same continent of Kunark. You lack 21 zones to explore due to the current lazy developer team. It's quite sad.

-- No maps. That's right, you get very little in-game maps. You need to go to a third-party website to download maps. This shouldn't happen...

-- Speaking of the current expansion, did you know they have the nerve to charge the same amount they charged for 'Kunark' for the most recent expansion 'Empires of Kunark'? With 1/4 the content! How people accept this is beyond me. Actually, thinking about it, they are probably lifelong players who can't take off their nostalgia goggles to see things clearly.

[b]Lack of Players / Forced to 'Box' to Make Progress[/b]
-- Let me explain how things are going to go for you if you are new and/or if you decide to come back:

[b]Level 1[/b]: ""Wow... this is an ugly UI. Um... What do I do?""
[b]2 - 11[/b]: ""Ok, I survived the tutorial. I was alone the entire time... Maybe I can join a group once I leave here?""
[b]12 - 50[/b]: ""Crescent Reach looks cool! Nice zone."", ""Hmm... still no groups even though I'm level 50! What the hell? Where is everybody?"", ""How did that guy writing that review on Steam know this would happen? Does this happen to everybody?""
[b]51 - 65[/b]: ""What the hell happened? Why is it so hard to level up? I'm getting less than 1% a kill and it's taking FOREVER to make progress."", ""Also, where are the groups? This game is top-heavy, I guess. Maybe if I keep pushing forward I can finally get a group.""
[b]66 - 75[/b]: ""Ok, I'm going to quit. The grind is real and it's a real bore. Not even difficult, just killing hundred of enemies for less than 1% EXP.""
[b]75 - 105[/b]: ""Finally, I'm high enough level to group with somebody!""

You: Hi, level XX [class here], want to group?
Players: No, you're not in our clique, so...
You: ...Damn it! Guess I'll ""box""

[b]What is 'Boxing'?[/b] - Boxing is a term used when a player has more than one account -- usually one or two additional accounts. You do this so you can tackle the games content since the game was designed for you to have a group. If you control three accounts, you can place three mercenaries (computer controlled players) in your party to complete your party. Instead of playing $15 a month, you pay $45 (if you have three accounts total). Depending on how good you are at controlling all your characters you can tackle every single thing in EverQuest besides most raids. Solo content? Obviously. Group content? Depends on what classes you picked and how good you are. Raids? A lot of old raids you can take, however once you reach the 12th (out of 23) or so expansion it nearly becomes impossible due to mechanics and needing 6+ players to enter the zone.

[b]In conclusion...[/b]
Only come back if you have played before and you want to take care of that itch you have. Don't bother with EverQuest if you are new and want to try an ""old school"" MMO. It's not worth it. Any other MMO besides EverQuest, is what I suggest.

You see, EverQuest is the kind of game you can lose your life to and not care one bit.  I know, because I was practically raised in this world.  I started back in 1999, when I was 6 years old.  Watching my Father play, I was captivated the moment I saw it - When I wasn't play it on the computer, I was LARPing it with my Brothers.

I maintain to this day, that I was not raised in Unnamed City, Canada, North America, World.  No, I was Born in Kelethin, Greater Faydark, Faydwer, Norrath.  I was raised and molded by this world, the experiences I had and the people I met.

I haven't, REALLY played in some years, but I still have solid friendships, to this day, that were forged in the Norrathian environment.  I still pop on every now and again, just to catch up.

Every time I do, it's like visiting an old friend.  You haven't seen eachother for a while.  You catch up.  Talk about what is new, get lost n your friendship and despite that you have both done some growing, it's like your friendsip has never changed.

I still get giddy with I hear the loading music.

This game is more than just a game.  It truely is a world in which you may lose yourself in.

It may be dated and have a lot of content that serves no purpose, but, it is there.  Just waiting to be explored.

If you don't mind soloing or have a few like-minded friends - Play this game.

Do not play it for the race.  Do not race yourself through all 115 Level (Maybe there are more now.  There were only 70 when I left)

Do not play it like most enter MMOs, a mad race to get to the top of the world, ASAP.

I did try dozen of MMORPGS in past decade, and except maybe Star Trek Online I never got that hooked...

Everquest is kind of like being thrusted straight back into the 90s, when your computer could barely run solitare and your mother was pretty hot. I had never played Everquest back in it's hay day, I instead played World of Warcraft back in the Cataclysm days, but it was obvious that when I first started up EQ, that it was the OG of MMORPGS. 

[h1]Enough chit chat, what's it like in-game?[/h1]

It's very complicated in my opinion. But obviously people opt for a different experience over the 'hand-holding' that most MMOs give you nowadays. You kind of feel a sense of 'freedom' when you embrace these mechanics in particular.

Combat is pretty niche, similar to the likes of Morrowind. Honestly, I could only relate to Morrowind as that was the only game that I played that had similar combat mechanics. 

Interacting with NPCs was quite profound too. You would have to either press the 'h' key on your keyboard or say 'hail' (hitler) to the NPC you wanted to talk to. From there you have to continue the conversation through the chat box with the highlighted words.

[h1]Is it fair on the average 'newbie'?[/h1]

HAHAHAHA no. Simply put, this game is pretty rock hard honestly. I found myself dying in pretty awkward situations and failed to see why the game hated me so much. It obviously takes a lot of time to master what's in game for sure.

[h1]Conclusion?[/h1]

I honestly don't know what to say about this game. If you want to feel the rush of nostalgia and cheesy 90s movies and commercials throbbing through your veins, then give it a shot. If you're looking for an MMO to try however and haven't really scratched the surface with online gaming, this game might not be for you.",1473039439,1473372303,True,7,2,0.614201366901397705,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I remember back in the day, when it took FOREVER for me to get level 8, and I thought I was so awesome when I finally got level 13, even though my parents were WAY higher level. I couldn't even comprehend getting that high at the time.

There are a lot of ads now in the game, as is expected of pretty much all Free To Play games. They want to hook you in to those micro-transactions. Admittedly, I have purchased a few aesthetic items off of the store. The game, even in it's current free-to-play format, still brings back memories during times of when it was subscription based.

All in all, if you used to like EverQuest back in the day, and don't mind the free-to-play model, then this game is fantastic. If you're looking for something new, then this isn't it. This game is quite old, so nothing really new here. If you liked the combat and gameplay system before, the basics of it haven't really changed.

I remember playing it every day after school, doing chores to pay for my sub, and even crying when my uncle got to playing with me. He came from Ultima, so I was eager to play with him. So many hours lost, so many days spent just standing around or running around. I forget his name, but I played a Half-Elf Ranger and loved it. Granted, the day finally came I shifted to other MMOs with my friends. Wow, FF, etc. Needless to say, Everquest was forgotten for awhile. Expansions came, the sequel came, etc.

Fastforward I wanna say Ten-ish or so years, here I sit, bored of Wow's Endgame, FF14 kinda.. Meh? I see Everquest is still around. Maybe not as true to the original as I remember, I see a lot of pay for access stuff and a company I'm not entirely fond of has taken over, but as I log in and play I feel the euphoria from when I was a child.

Granted I'm on the Roleplay server, so my chance to meet others and experience the game as I used to is varied. So far I haven't met many others, but I'm also fresh into the game. But Everquest is still alive. Its still around. And I still love it.

And yes. I made a Half-Elf ranger again. Just like old times.

I've played several mmos over the years but the 3 which ive spent the most time in were Runescape (1 year), WoW (2-3 years), and Everquest 2 (2006-today) which is my current favorite. I had always heard stories about Everquest's difficulty and coupled with the expectations of an ugly game with clunky controls that is outdated in every manner, I was left with the impression that this game would not be for me. 

Logging into Everquest for the first time I instantly note that the textures look nice despite the low polygon count. Character creation was vast in terms of race/class choice but limited in hair/face models. It offers you an optional tutorial which I suggest you take because I caught on quickly thanks to its guidance. This is the only MMO that I have ever played which forces you to actually read NPC dialogue as you need to respond or click key words to choose dialogue options. Additionally there is no quest helper, but you are given enough details on the quest in your log. Many problems I have with older MMO's is that theyve become a cakewalk. Im the type of player who enjoys the journey more than endgame itself and Everquest is no cakewalk. Granted that its much easier than stories I hear from 1999 but I found myself struggling and needing the help of a mercernary even in the tutorial. The thrill of finding a new item or defeating that one enemy which stumped you several times in the past is there from below level 10 and on. Another problem I have with many older mmos such as Everquest 2 is that it can sometimes be a ghost town, but much to my surprise Everquest 1 is still filled with players. In the tutorial I remember joining several groups and having to wait my turn for a boss to spawn for a quest. The Ui is fully customizable as well where every window allows you to change opacity and shape in addition to font size.

There are several aspects of the game which add additional challenge which I appreciated, one being that you're not automatically given new abilities every time you level but you need to find an NPC vendor in order to learn a new ability. In addition to this you can only use a handfull of abilities at a time causing you to change your loadout depending on which enemy you face. As a paladin I would have to choose which spells I werent planning to use and replace them with spells which were effective against the undead, because without them I would have been toast. When you die your body is left behind holding a portion of your experience, finding it will return this experience to you. Long gone are the days of loosing everything on your character which im half thankful for, but part of me would like to experience this challenge. Probably the most rewarding challenge that ive met so far has been going into a large zone and having absolutely no map, getting lost and having to use my compas in order to find my way out without dieing. In these situations you can always google zonemaps, but I prefer to use the games cartography tool which allows me to create my own map. You can do this by running along roads and borders of the map to create lines or leaving notes in various areas informing you of locations. Crafting is also challenging as well, even at low levels you're required to create several other items used in the process of crafting the item you originally needed. Everquest 2 requires you to play a minigame while crafting and farm random ingredients from nodes (for example blueberries from a blackberry bush). You never know what you will get and I'm glad to say that I prefer crafting in EQ1. Materials fall from enemies, and theres no minigame with crafting. 

Currently I am level 27 and I was left with such a strong impression that I felt the need to share my experience. EQ1 is a game filled with personality, which I find charming and sometimes comical. Little touches such as comical loading bars which are basically inside jokes to the likes of; ""warning, half elves are now 49.9% elf"", ""Polishing Erudite forheads"" ect. When choosing an enemy, theres no way to know their strength by looking at them, pressing C to consider will give you a readout of their relative strength which ranges from ""this can be risky"" to ""what would you like your tombstone to say?"" I probably enjoyed these little touches more than I should, but sadly as a long time player of EQ2, these touches were missing. 

My experience with other players has been mostly positive. I've made a few friends and joined a guild right out of tutorial which is filled with friendly players who are more than willing to help me out with my noob questions. Players in zones will ask you to trade buffs with them which I found helpful. My only negative interaction with another player was when I had my zone camped by a higher level player when I was trying to complete a quest but this has only happened one time. 

While EQ1 is still challenging to a new player, I have found a few areas of handholding which you may or may not appreciate such as getting a letter in your inbox every time you level up which tells you where you should go. I will probably appreciate this at a higher level though. I also with death consequence was a bit more harsh because I find myself not caring enough to walk the distance to gain the exp i dropped. I am only level 27 though so I cant speak for this in later parts of the game.

In conclusion, Everquest is a game which I choose not to see as outdated by nearly 20 years, but a game which has been refined for much longer than anything else on the market. Its a welcoming experience for new and old players alike. I am currently a free player and outside of the occasional popup advertisement, I do not feel limited in terms of bagspace or character options, however I do hear higher quality spells and armor are restricted to paying members later on in the game.

I played all the way until Sullon Zek PVP server merged into Zek and guild Pandemonium had the server on lockdown. But, long before, this game was pure magic.

I went on to beta test WOW, and EQ2 and played those games quite a bit... but EQ was still pure gold. Trouble was the game engine and graphics had fallen so far behind. Eq2 was fun, great in fact, but a different game. And so for all these years having playing every MMO from Vanguard to Age of Conan to Aion to Tera to FF XiV and even Archeage...

EQ the original, will always have my heart and soul.  I wasn't terribly sad to hear EQNext was shuttered by Daybreak... because the idiotic SOE Devs had done it again... simply created a whole new game.  None of the original EQ fans ever wanted a different game. We wanted oue beloved EQ, simple as it was... only with a new game engine and better graphics.  Heck, all the expansions are there... all we ever wanted was a company with the vision to simply update and reboot the ORIGINAL in a more optimized way.

Perhaps Daybreak will decide to do that one day. I'm sure it would cost a lot less than the cash wasted on ""recreated"" a ""new vision"" with ""ground-breaking technology"" which is... not fun, and no one from the fanbase EVER asked for or wanted.

And if they don't... they do not understand what makes an MMO ""great.""  WOW only dominated EQ... because it had the same kind of magical world and endgame... with upgraded graphics.

I've put in over 10,000+ hours of playtime in to EQ over the past 23**** years.

My allies and myself slaying everything it laid in front of us. Contrary to the name, not many quests were done, however the few that we did do were epic (weapons) and well worth the time and effort. Oh the memories and fun that we've had...

---------------------------------------------------------------

The game is still far from ""dead"".  Just make sure you pick a server that is more populated if that's what you're looking for (Bristlebane or a TLP server for example). Don't expect low level areas to be bustling with people in a game that has been out for 20*** years. With that logic, World of Warcraft live servers are ""dead"". A tiny bit of homework goes a long way with old games like these.

Yes Daybreak/Darkpaw is pretty awful but the game is being treated with a touch of love, or so it seems at this stage. Truth be told, SoE wasn't much better but the industry was a lot smaller so they got a lot more slack. No, they aren't part of a Russian government conspiracy. Don't fall for those idiot negative reviews just stating that garbage.

---------------------------------------------------------------

*Edit #1 - we're up to 18 years now. Sweet Jesus.

**Edit #2 - Make that 19 years. It always calls me back every so often with those original ""classic"" servers. World of Warcraft is going to mimic what EQ did here and hopefully they can pull it off as well as EQ has. Nostalgia is a heck of a drug.

***Edit #3 - I don't want to talk about my play time. It was funny to me when Blizzard said that WoW Classic wasn't something players would want. Further inspiration from the GOAT, EQ. I fully expect WoW to go through a similar process with adding more and unique ""Classic"" servers as time goes on. It keeps players engaged and keeps them subscribed. The game never dies if there is always something that draws you back. Even after TWENTY YEARS.

****Edit #4 - Ugh 23 years and I still play this dang game. We're on expansion # 28 (Terror of Luclin). The ""Live"" EQ servers are still plenty populated to do group or raid content, although a lot of people run things within their own guilds and act as social hubs outside of the Guild Lobby area and general chat. I'd recommend joining a large guild even if you're not going to raid. A lot of raid guilds allow casual members to join and participate in things outside of raids. They put out new TLP (Progression) servers every other year and this year we'll get 2 new ones in May for that crowd that wants a fresh start or enjoys a new rule-set. Blah blah blah still the best game ever made. -- Also, I was 100% spot on with my prior edits about WoW Classic and it getting the same treatment with experimental rule-set servers!

It's hard to suggest a game like this though to be honest, it's so old and there is really so much that has been missed for new players that I don't know how people can start now.  

I do admit with as often as they seem to be putting out new things they would lower the price of some of the exp or something.

Yea Day break games why would you name your company anything else , corporate sell outs pass on this game . if you need a reason read below then add in the fact that the hole game is all about krono and not the experience .

Edited: So dbg the company who doesn't care about their game never even showed up for the 20th anniversary ... their casual tlp is not casual since you only have 3 weeks to get leveled to end game before poof expansion and raid went bye bye.The mangler server is not even close to classic, still exp boost, mobs are still nerfed and you get things like a per at level 2 as a mage because none of the spells are classic they scale and are boosted like a live server. 

There was a long period of time where you couldnt actually donwload eq because of a corrupt file so me and a couple others had to make links on forums so people could download the uncorrupt old version of the file to be able to play. that went on for a very long time. day break games was told on twitter , on the forums, they did nothing for months. DBG is taking all their money from EQ and dropping it into other projects says their actions. Dont waste your time on this game the people who own this game do not care at all what shape or what happens to it in obviously stated reasons above . 


DBG really breaks games ... like everyone originally said... probably because they lied about eq next and took my money . GREAT company     # lmfaoroflpimpwtff",1448851549,1554037788,False,0,0,0.394736826419830322,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What I mean by this is simple: If you do not pay the monthly fee, then all that hard earned equipment you are wearing will no longer take affect on you and be basically just a visual item you are wearing.

Here is the kicker, Everquest WAS an amazing game, nothing can even come close to the detail of the story but they fail at catching and keeping new players.

 Expect no more then a cash grab and lackluster experience with really no new players joining/playing and just the diehards left holding on or finishing whats left of content they havent experienced, and they rather watch people struggle then help.

I started back in late 2001 and was there to witness the good old days of EQ. Then Luclin came and the world as I knew it changed. But I experienced the sudden shift in paradigms, the loss of inocence, the dawn of a new era.

There was no WOW back in the day, Meridian 59/UO were practically the only other contenders in the MMO segment.

So I decided to make Norrath my home, invited friends over and decided to just go around exploring what the world had to offer ... and believe it or not, even today there is still stuff I don´t know much about, and only two years ago ended up finishing my Beastlords´s epic XD

I mean, what drives me here? Is it the nostalgia? The remembrance? The Friends?

Well , EQ is perhaps one of those few mmo´s that have managed to keep me coming back to it for WELL OVER A DECADE, and that surprises me. I left (to my chagrin today, knowing what I know now) EQ1 back in 2003/2004 when EQ2 launched ...

Man how I regret that decision. After that I started a road of complete homelessness in the Virtual World of MMO´s , jumping the ship to EQ2/CoH/CoV/TR/MO/MU-O/Vanguard/LOTRO/WAR and many many other MMO´s that just kept filling me with hope of finding a nice quiet place to settle.

It was then I realized there simply has been ONE and ONE home alone for me, with all its flaws, odd mechanics, drug-induced vision storyline of twisted roundabouts and myriad quirks and customs : EVERQUEST 1

You see, it is my personal belief that we as gamers sometimes fall upon the LURE of the NEW, the supposedly new&fresh/exciting STUFF someone will make and instead of enjoying it begin a futile search for the NEXT BIG THING of NOTHINGNESS that will fill a strange hollow void in our souls, almost as if we were waiting for Godot to arrive to start having fun and be all right. 

But it is a lie, a subtle lie of epic proportions that meshes with our current middle age crisis/existentialist angst/suppressed teen anger/isolation and alienation that the modern world forces upon us.

You see, home, the virtual home is a chimera of our own mind and looking for it constantly only shows how much we miss it.

Like a weird quest to return to the womb, a virtual one, this has been my experience. There will ALWAYS be a new flashy MMO, filled with wonder, with promises of awesome pvp/pve, with new flaunted combat systems, with amazing rendered spells, with gorgeous buxom beauties of pixelated proportions so fine you will barely notice the missing seams in the avatarrs .. But it´s a lie. 

What you are looking for, what I have been looking for is that permanently looped Nursery that was found in The Dancers at the End of Time, whhose technology was applied to the already dying universe to loop it in time perfectly for millenia of everliving the good old moment of the eternal now (blame Michael Moorcock for that not me)

And where is it found? That permanently looped in time place that is my virtual home?

HERE, in this game that has maddened me to no end, that always makes lousy design decisions yet continues to be underneath all that filth the good old Everquest.

And no friend, this is no madman rambling, there are thousands of us, still trying to live in that perfectly looped anomaly outside the universe.

There is P99 (recently recognized by Daybreak) and many other private/public shards of EQ that alongside official ""Live"" servers try to perpetuate this strange world of wonders and mysteries.

I am not writing this to try to convince you to play the game or to hate it, only to show you a small door to my own path, which might be the same as yours.

Yes, modern MMO´s have a TON of Quality of Life enhancements, but this has made them as tasty as Fast Food, greasy delicious fast food, that you love to consume , but EQ? EQ is the awful porridge your poor parents forced you to eat because the war was in its apex and all you could eat was that sludge made from a mix of unknown victuals as your family and fellow refugees huddled close together by the slowly consuming candle as thunder and perhaps incoming shells sounds  reverberated in the sky. 

You see, even today, when you eat that porridge, you ... REMEMBER. 

And that alone friend, is what made you what you are today.

Thus Everquest. Forever. 

Yes, I highly enjoy this game, no, the hours in steam dont reflect my true use of the account, I have many more lost in the true logs of the servers. 

Yes it is an old game, but honestly, it is the only home I have ever known and the others have been just weird foreign towns that don´t know how to make that dreadfully delicious bland porridge of sadness that for some twisted reason make me happy.

Man I love this game, will always return to it, and will always play on the TLP servers when given the chance. 

Also no other game has this trinity/support classes so well defined as EQ. No other game has an Enchanter Class nor a Necromancer class like the one EQ has to offer. 

They don´t really, for some reason as time passes Modern Games tend to dilute and break these classic archetypes of gaming turning them into something they are not. 

Anyway it is time for my medication, and I think the Ward already noticed I am not in my room

Love you all guys, remember me, I will remember all of you, my fellow players of Everquest, you have given me for years the best gaming moments of my life and hope that this will be so in the future too.

Hugs to you all!

If you spent this kind of time on modern day MMOs, you could max out multiple characters. I've yet to even get close to maxing a character in EverQuest. 

I played WoW starting at Burning Crusade. Back in the day, WoW felt more like EverQuest. Now, you don't sit to restore mana or pause. People are in a mad rush to finish dungeons and raids. 

In EverQuest, things are much more laid back. Honestly, I think that was what made me love EverQuest so much when I first played it in the last 5 years (~2015). It gave me the feeling earlier WoW expansions did. Except I still prefer EverQuest. 

-----Final Recommendation-----

If you like MMOs, I'd seriously consider this one! Especially if you like to take things slower. If you are into the mad rushing you experience in modern day MMOs, you still may like this game if you play LIVE but it's designed to be more of a slower paced game.

Everquest still is even with outdated graphics one of the best mmos, if you feel its to hard they dont care , if you feel its unfair you lose exp when you die they dont care.

For it's time (I'd say circa 1999 - 2004) EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience to be had, and as one of the lucky players who was fortunate enough to play during this time period I can say beyond a reasonable doubt that EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.

For what it was, EverQuest was simply an epic adventure that nothing since its time has been fully able to live up to what it presented. It utilized online game play before any other really massive games (save Ultima Online if so it can be considered) could offer for the time. The beauty of this game, however, really was drawn for it's difficulty, its immersion, and its community - and unfortunately, the EverQuest of today does not do these properties justice.

There was a stark fear that entered me the day I played this for the first time. For one, it was expensive, it required a subscription, and I was not used to such things as a 13 year old - but with enough allowance and perseverance I made this game happen and it changed me personally on many levels as a result. 

To date, no other game has been able to offer the same feelings that this game truly did as an adolescent, and I feel that this game really places the bar at which I judge other MMO's and RPGs. It was fixed to first person, quests needed to be obtained through dialog, death was unforgiving, your possessions remained on your corpse, experience loss was a veary real fear, getting lost was a very real fear, other players were judged on their merit as individuals, and I could go on about every finite detail that made this game very revolutionary for its time.

The EverQuest of today has been very watered down and filled with so many cash shop items and meaningless expansions to fuel the gear treadmill that I am deeply saddened. However, I do understand the stipulations behind keeping a game like this alive in a world of gaming where the ""lesser"" MMO's must really nickle and dime it's players to keep afloat, and for that reason I can never return to this magical place that shaped my childhood and outlook on gaming.

Despite this, however, I keep this game and its developers in high regard for the opportunities it offered for me at the time. For many of us, the rose-colored glasses weigh heavy on tired eyes, but like your first love - this isn't something we can ever forget. 

For a real opportunity at the game in its hay-day Project 1999 (www.project1999.org) may be something to experience - but part of the magic that made EQ something awesome really did stem from its technological superiority of the time, and this may take away from the experience you may otherwise have.

I will stop waxing nostalgic at this point and leave your judgement to its rest, but as an old EQ player I will forever stand by this game as an unparalleled experience that....sadly....really can never be experienced again.",1419311025,1419311372,True,7,0,0.62312549352645874,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Though the games mechanics have changed quite a lot since 1999 (progression servers that are locked to older content remedy this), EQ still delivers an old-school MMO feel with tons of additions inspired by newer games. The community is small, but very much tight knit and very helpful. Just make sure you research which servers have a high enough population to suit your fancy.

One huge plus with this game is the exploration oppurtunities and the pure sense of adventure in a fantasy setting. The game is gearing up for its 22nd (yes, 22nd) expansion pack. That means this game is chock full of zones, quests and loot to find. Characters are also able to embark on very long, detailed quests for ""Epic"" weapons which are class specific. These epic quests involves traversing huge swaths of the world, looking for extremely rare spawns, building reputation with various factions and taking down raid encounters with an organized group. 

The main flow of the game is centered around camping mob spawns, doing quests for items, experience, gear modifications or lore/class related advancement. Character customization is primarily loot based, with a huge emphasis on augmentations for said loot. Once a player hits 51, Alternate Avancement points come into play to further customize how your characters play. Time consuming but very rewarding. The game also allows for soloers to have fun by using ""mercenaries"", basically CPU group characters who fulfill specific roles such as tanking, healing or DPS.

It's the first world that I had become fully immersed in, and I think that all the games I've bought and played over the years since have been in a way seeking to get the same sort of feeling that Everquest had provided for me. I still have the fondest memories of my days as a young Dwarf, finding adventure and misadventure in and around the Butcherblock Mountains; being chased by Corflunk and Zarchoomi; being blasted to bits by a brownie in the Lesser Faydark, and enlisting other low-level guildmates to run interference while I make a naked corpse run to get my stuff back; camping Crushbone forever, so that I can get as many belts as I can to turn in to Canloe Nusback for the faction boost. I remember drowning while trying to find a certain island with mermaids on it in the Ocean of Tears. I remember being beaten to death by farmers in East Karana while trying to seek refuge from a lion that was chasing me.

These days, I'm not much for the MMO experience -- I'm not wild about forced socializing -- so I like to look for games that provide the sort of open, persistent world full of possibilities to explore and adventure, which EQ provides so well. Graphically, I can't say the game has aged too well, although it doesn't look too bad for a 15-year-old game. The best thing is, though, it's still alive! It's still worth playing.

I played it when I was younger, but then ended up stopping my account when my PC decided to go out in a blaze of glory.   It took me ten years to get back into it, but to be quite honest, it's still got that same magical spark.  

Even with its twenty-first expansion on the horizon, people still play this.  I have a couple characters, but at the same time, it can be really just kind of depressing choosing to roll up a new character, and finding that you're the only person in the starting zone.   To be honest, there's not really a lot of players on the lower-end of things any more- most of your players are essentially those who have still got their high-level characters and are chruning through higher-level content as it comes out.  There are still a handful of players in the lower levels, but to be quite honest, if you like soloing, this is the class for you.  The mercenary system is a godsend for those mobs you can't handle on your own, but you'll still run into quests that you just can't handle on your own. For example, the newbie weapon for Wood Elf Druids requires you to break the throne room of the castle in Camp Crushbone, and even with a merc, it's not really something that you'll be able to accomplish on your own until you get to a level where you can easily find things that outclass the reward.  

The graphics are really dated- there are games with much better graphics out there right now, but at the same time, they're not as hard to run on non-top of the line computers any more.   If you're not running a graphically-intensive computer with a three-hundred dollar card in it, no worries- this runs fine on my laptop. 

Gameplay is still solid, even after all these years, but at the same time, it's not really changed that much.  The addition of the tutorial is always a plus, but to tell you the truth, it makes for a better way into the game instead of just being dropped into a newbie zone with nothing to do.  You can easily grind up to 13 or 14 here, if you accomplish all the missions, and you can find some decent equipment, too. 

To be honest, though, it's free to play, and you can't go wrong with a game that won't tax an older machine.  If you enjoy a trip back to the days of groups looking to hit up the Halls of Honor or the Plane of Disease, download this game- just be ready to do a bunch of soloing.  If you used to play, all you really need is your sense of nostalgia and for your memories to come flooding back once you hit up your old favorite zones and hear that old, familiar music.",1414145456,1414145456,True,86,2,0.844267070293426514,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay has considerably changed over the years, EQ is no longer as strict in many aspects such as corpse recovery is no longer needed and powerful, customizable mercenaries are available to enhance game play, greatly reducing the need for groups or organizing guild raids.

You can even upgrade or create a character at level 85 character, fully complete with raid gear and platinum coin for a very reasonable fee, to explore the high-end content.

Even with the lower server populations after 10+ years in existence, there still is way too much to do in this game, living up to its name of Everquest.  The number of vast zones, huge dungeons, hidden lore and equipment, enormous cities, it is simply overwhelming.

They just don't make MMOs like this anymore. MMOs where the game was about exploring new locations, the lore, and slow steady progression. MMOs today are just hubs littered with thousands of mind numbing quests to level 1-Max in a month, grouping not required. MMOs today are about getting to end game and raiding endlessly. EQ had its fair share of raiding, but when I think of EverQuest that is not the part that I think of. My initial character that took a long time to level up (probably a year to get max level) and slowly progressed from zone to zone and the different people I met along the way that I grouped with is what I remember most. No other MMO has had a similar experience since because they just go by too fast and too easy to get people to the end game, and with instance queues (usually multi-server) there just isn't any sense of server community in current MMOs.

At the end game EQ was similar to what we know today in MMOs, nothing that special, with the primary difference being competition over spawns since there were no instances. This was fun and not fun at the same time. It formed different guild rivalries if we stole a spawn or they did, but sometimes you would have to change plans due to not being at the right place at the right time. The more proactive your guild was in monitoring spawns and mobilizing quickly and efficiently the greater chance that your guild would be the strongest on the server. It was a different mechanic than current MMO raids, but ultimately that isn't where EverQuest shined to me.

The EQ lore is what kept me playing. The locations and the story lines were there, but you had to find them, they weren't laid out for you with giant exclamation points. EQ has some of the best zones in any MMO I've played and I would recommend playing it today just to get a chance to experience certain zones and dungeons, but again this game will be hard to pick up at this point with its age.

There are still people that play the game, but they're all at end game raiding. I would recommend this game still today as a single player experience to just experience some of the zones and game lore, but it would be hard to recommend it to play end game with all the catching up that would be required.

Well, sort of. It predates most of the MMO market by a few years, especially a certain other exceptionally popular game anyone remotely familiar with the genre will instantly know. In its heyday, it was one of the most popular MMOs, with about 100,000 subscribers, give or take. The epic scale of the raids still hasn't been replicated to this day.
But has it aged well? Sure.
EverQuest has always been about change. Sure, you can't have a dynamic influence on the world in most cases, but the game has always been changing. Where once you couldn't do anything without a group unless you were a specific class, now nearly everyone is capable of soloing for experience.
Don't get me wrong, the game is still old and looks old, but there's a wonderful charm to it that other games really haven't come close to replicating.
Oh, and it's HUGE. In the old days, it used to be said that it took six hours to run from one end of the map to the other on foot. Well, the game has gotten bigger since then, to the point that they've added a number of hub zones to make travel easier. The down side to this truly epic size is that very few zones are consistently occupied by players.
There's also a bit of a disjointed aesthetic to the game. While many older zones and models have been updated over time, just as many have not. While Freeport and the surrounding Commonlands have received overhauls to the point it's almost a joke in the community, Qeynos and the Karanas are mostly unchanged from the time of launch, barring a few new quests that make you visit there.
Now, let's talk about the sound. It's dated, sure, but that little factor hasn't stopped people from loving music before. And EverQuest has some real goldies. Kelethin, the sea approach to Freeport, Rivervale...great music that will stick in your mind forever. It's unfortunate that some of this music, such as the Rivervale theme, are in places you'd never normally visit, but sometimes it's worth it just to hear it.
It's not all rose colored glasses, though: The UI is cluttered beyond belief, to the point you'll be glad you can alter it to your liking. The previously mentioned disjointed graphics can also be rather jarring when you compare newer cash shop aesthetic outfits with older, standard armor. Everything works, but unlike most MMOs these days that are like receiving a new toy with karate chop action, EverQuest is like receiving one of those totally awesome playsets...with the words ""Some Assembly Required"" etched on the front.
But if you ask me, it's worth it.",1395365374,1395365374,True,67,1,0.831192314624786377,6,False,False,False,False,,,

I will leave you with my review.

Released in 1999 Everquest is a hugely influential MMO, Influencing the genre even to this day. I am not as naive as to say that Everquest Started the MMO craze. I can say however that it most definitely helped get it off the ground. The game is still going strong with around 20 expansions to date. I have got to say if you want that classic feel in an mmo come on back to Everquest. Its still here, and still strong!

I may prefer Everquest 2 more, but I think its great that the game is still open for those hard core Everquest 1 fans, and new people interested in the game alike.

Def not recommended anymore :(

Edit:Came back for progression servers, which are really nice ngl.. BUUUT the player base is still modernly toxic af.. Kill theft, camp raiding, and just general rudeness abound. Way to many politics in general world chats etc...
Bots and Boxers still roam rampant in ways that show either bot farms or basement dwellers have actively overthrown the world of Norrath.

If you can ignore all that, it is *mostly* the nice game it once was but with faster XP and other Quality of Life Improvements at the start on the Yelinak server.
Still gets a negative review tho, because where it was once an open and very nice community of players, its been turned into a similar waste dump of the CoD generation. :(
Where once Kill Stealers and camp raiders would've been blasted and black listed on server forums and thus ostracized from the community, now they're a blatant part of it. Unpunished and something that has to be dealt with since GM's clearly don't exist (or the world chats wouldn't be so full of such toxicity),  and DB doesn't give one flying F so long as they're getting money.

This isn't your fathers, mothers, or grandparents game anymore. It's a cesspool with a small wading area thats fine to swim in, but still full of pi**",1355520085,1655697266,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,
