I initially started with Chapter 2 of The Several Journeys of Reemus, but went on to play all of them, one by one.
I loved the unique art direction and the quirky and imaginative world that was presented in these games, it inspired kid-me so much, it made me want to create my own fictional world, one as engrossing as this one.
The world harbours a medieval setting, but with an artistic twist; the land is inhabited by gruesome, flesh-eating monsters/plants, giant bees/beetles/etc. 

I loved the writing a lot as well. The two main characters are the highlight, of course, but the dynamic and interactions between Reemus and Liam is a strong part of the games, in my opinion.

Reemus is kind of a ruffian and a bit of a numbskull at times, but he's also determined and isn't afraid to poke a joke or two while he's at it. He's a bug exterminator by trade, overshadowed by his famous brother who kills dragons.
Liam, on the other hand, is more of a wise, down-to-earth character, a bard at that. He's also Reemus's sidekick and accompanies him in all of their misadventures.
Together, this duo are good friends and you can tell they genuinely care about one another but also have a different approach to life and how to resolve situations.
There are some instances in the games where Liam takes a level-headed and peaceful attempt at a solution to a problem, whereas Reemus jumps in and tries to solve things with a fistful of brute force and intimidation or sleazily talking his way into it.

Ballads of Reemus is no stranger to this pair's chemistry and utlises it to whatever extent it can get in this runtime.
The usual puzzle-solving point and click mechanics are here and they feel mostly akin to the old games, not much to say there. I don't really recall any puzzles that were very hard to solve, but they were well-made for what they were.

One other thing I will mention is that this game has something the previous games did not; voice acting.
It was a thing that was a nice addition at first, and it does bring the characters to life, but as a long time fan, the voice I had imagined for Reemus was very different from the one they decided to put in this game, which threw me off a bit.
Everyone else is fine, Liam's is eerily close to the voice I had imagine for him in my head though.

As much as I have praise for this series, Ballads of Reemus was more or less as long as a typical entry in the Journeys of Reemus series.However, being the first ever commercial release, I was a little disappointed when it ended so quickly.

Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable game and I hope that one day, we can see a HD collection or trilogy or something of the original flash games here on Steam.",1645816736,1646260455,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

游戏共8个成就：（成就名是自己瞎起的）
1、《通关》不用多说。
2、《除虫专家》大概是这个意思吧，从第二关开始，所有场景中都会有一只隐藏的虫子，点击可以除掉。最后的结束界面等到中间部分有最后一只虫子。
（场景成就）所有需要找碎片的成就碎片都在该关场景中。
3、《结茧》开始时右边有个抽烟的大叔关卡，最左边的场景左下的草丛，可以找到一只毛毛虫，帮它找齐8个树枝让其结茧。
4、《安葬》结茧成就之后的城镇全景关卡，仅能控制利亚姆。该关需要用瑞姆斯家门前找到的毒蘑菇，毒死糕点店的海鸥，不要直接将海鸥交给屠夫，先到推销的人那里，将死海鸥给场景里的另一只海鸥看，它会让你帮忙找齐14个墓碑碎片帮伙伴立坟。（完成后它会去糕点店拉屎）
5、《蝴蝶》开始时右边有红色蚂蚁的关卡，在中间的场景等待一会，会飞来一直蝴蝶，点击并帮助蝴蝶（找不同）
6、《肖申克的救赎》监狱关，利亚姆和瑞姆斯牢房中间的过道中，点下面的洞能看到一只飞蛾，帮它找齐26个海报碎片（看起来是丽塔海华丝，找齐之后它会贴到墙上并躲到后面）
7、《小熊X尼》最后一关，在地下室墙上有蜂蜜的场景，点击楼梯旁边的木桶，会出来一只X尼配色的利亚姆，帮它找齐16个蜂蜜（它吃完会糊住嘴说不了话）
8、《甜蜜之家》同最后一关，望远镜天台上有一对鸟夫妻（疑似第二关的鸟？），帮他们整理好窝（找不同）。（完成成就离开该场景再回来，鸟窝里有蛋）

然后是关于一些流程注意事项和有趣的细节：
1、城镇关卡的推销场景，推销的研磨机不只能磨小麦粉（可以自己试试）
2、同城镇关卡，要罐子的场景一定要点罐子才能触发风铃，只点人说话是无效的。（明确我是要罐子）
3、监狱关卡，飞蛾的成就碎片在女王繁殖场景有多个，有的很难看到，在该场景逗留一会，碎片会闪光（也很小，但多少有帮助）
4、最后一关的研磨机，在三只红蚁场景的箱子里。并且最后一关推荐先完成瑞姆斯的路线，因为瑞姆斯无法到达利亚姆路线的场景，而利亚姆可以到达所有场景，方便做成就。
5、最后一关守着地下室门口的蜜蜂，疑似是前作蜜蜂巢穴的监工（就是没识破我们伪装放我们去偷蜂蜜的那个hhhhhhh）

个人非常喜欢的一个系列，有兴趣的可以玩玩前作。
前传（除蚁王）瑞姆斯除虫专家道路的开端
1-4（死亡蠕虫）连续剧情，围绕出现的死亡蠕虫展开。1-3为线性关卡，4为半个沙盒关卡（可选路线，当然也可以全打通，结局方式多选）
1：从遇到狼追捕开始，到飞行坠落结束。
2：从坠落到的猪圈开始，到催眠大型食人虫，调查眼睛结束。
3：从蠕虫视角开始（不断进化），到乘船结束（两条路线，结局动画不同）
4：从在城堡接任务开始，到打海盗结束。

《瑞姆斯的冒险》是一款解谜游戏，讲述了除虫专家瑞姆斯，以及他的忠实伙伴矮熊里昂的冒险故事，一路上一人一熊运用各种稀奇古怪的方法去解决各种疑难问题，并最终逃离困境或剿除害虫，尽管方式奇特，但无论如何，这个系列的游戏结局永远是圆满而风趣的。

游戏的解谜很简单，只要稍微开动思维就能搞清楚，就算你对英文一窍不通，大抵也能运用解谜游戏的通用绝招：乱点乱按来通过难关，游戏只在一小部分的主线上做了藏头处理，而这些藏头处理是不需要兜大圈子来解决的，点到恰当的位置即可搞定。
游戏的整体氛围十分搞怪，你能见到许多带有独特的欧美幽默细胞的生态环境：爱吃冰淇淋的植物，会分泌强力胶的花，野外自然生长的调料树，身长几百公里的猪鼻子虫，会长出培根与鸡蛋的早餐树。看似都是很省事的创意，实际表现出来的时候却是非常好玩。
游戏的实际内容用四个字概括就是“粗中有细”，这主要是体现在对话上，这里的人物对话都很文明，文明的同时还透露出许多充实的交流，结合这粗枝大叶的人物设计与环境布局实在让人想象不到这是他们讲出来的对话。看过了太多的游戏对话，言之无物者与动辄三俗者甚多，这并非责难，而是现实存在的问题，相比之下，瑞姆斯这边的片场尽可能地远离了这两样东西，实在难能可贵。

关于系列作品：
《瑞姆斯的冒险》并非正规译名，只是这么翻译更易于理解与接受。原名下面有人写了，叫The Several Jouneys of Reemus，现在的这个Ballads of Reemus是系列第六部作品。前五部是没有人物配音的网络Flash游戏，主标题也都是The Several Jouneys of Reemus，到了现在的第六部更名为Ballads of Reemus，有了人物配音，音效与BGM更加丰富，游戏内容上也比之前的五章更长。当然，解谜难度也是一如既往，不会太难也不会太简单。

题外话：
我当初是在国内的游戏网站上得知这个游戏的存在，后来陆续玩了一遍所有前作，由于当时身在国内，没有找到合适的购买途径。后来在Steam上注册帐号，偶然发现这里有售，但当时没有上架，于是我顺藤摸瓜一路摸到作者团队的主页，意外的是在他们的主页居然有售。
当时急于要买到这款游戏，于是稀里糊涂地付了款，却发现必须注册他们的官网才能完成购买，我花了好长时间去注册也没有注册成功，心想这下子白花钱了（当时囊中羞涩，对此很郁闷）。
然后意料之外的事情发生了，作者团队把游戏本体直接发送到了我的邮箱里。当时很惊讶，后来细想，是不是因为这个时间段里只有我一个人付款，而且只有我一个人拼命用邮箱反复注册帐号，所以才发现了我？总而言之，现在我有同时拥有了独立版本和Steam版的游戏本体，这下算是圆满了。",1548607258,1556888440,True,13,0,0.689119160175323486,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After playing so many adventure games where the joke is that the protagonist is a loser, everyone hates him and he will never find happiness even after succeeding in his quest, it's refreshing to see a game that subtly subverts that archetype. While being presented as a conventionally unattractive man with a conventionally unattractive job, overshadowed by his famous brother and being known for property damage, Reemus still has many genuine qualities and virtues, and a personality that is not entirely defined by his failures. Townspeople still makes jokes about him from time to time, but not every single line of their dialogue is an insult, and they are in fact mostly amicable towards him. He is not their hero, but is also not their scourge, he is just a guy that sometimes causes a bit of trouble.

This extends to the gameplay and puzzle solving as well. Reemus is not the brightest man and is impulsive and aggressive, but is also not completely clueless and can solve his problems with more than just luck. Solutions most the time involve finding items that can be identified as useful to solving the immediate problem, (instead of having to find an old boot so that you can throw it at an cat chasing a mouse so that when you later get captured by thugs the mouse can come and gnaw the ropes binding you) with Reemus and his sidekick Liam many times providing clues as to what their intentions and ideias are relating to the item. Both protagonists are active and play equal parts in solving their problems; even when Reemus seems to be acting lazy and is relaying on Liam to do the dirty work, as soon as he is given the opportunity he starts working as well and even risks his life doing so.

Liam the purple bear, by the way, is great. I didn't expect his voice to be as deep as it is but I also appreciate him not having a gimmicky annoying voice. His relationship with Reemus is heartwarming, and contributes a lot to subvert his loser jerk adventure game protagonist archetype. (The moment when Reemus grinded a photo of Liam into a potion of trust will be guarded and treasured forever in my heart)

This is a very genuine game. Instead of being a barrage of meta-jokes and parodies of popular things it has its own world and sense of humor, focusing on its characters and their interactions. Even when the joke is ""Man, bacon sure does make everything better!"", at least it's not ""Here I go picking random items on the floor to solve some dumb puzzle, these adventure game writers sure are lazy people, am I right you guys?"" There are a few fourth-wall breaking jokes, but they are brief and unobtrusive. The world and humor derive from the creators' tastes and inspirations rather than a anvil-on-the-head postmodernist dump pandering to cynics, like so many adventure games were.

The art and animation is superb, and was the reason I started playing this series in the first place, back when it was still a series of flash games on Newgrounds/Kongregate. Colorful and unique, expressive and full of personality. 

As for the voice-acting, while the recording quality of some of the actors leave a bit to be desired, the talent itself is pretty good. I didn't like it at first, and played the demo with the voice muted, but after buying the game I gave it a second chance knowing better what to expect and thought that it greatly enhanced the experience, and brought the game closer to the 90s/early 2000s adventure games it emulated. Save for a few of overacting characters (a Moth and a Bee in particular), I enjoyed all the voices. (after getting over the mic quality of some of them...)

Maybe I just have been stumbling into too many bad, unintuitive and fourth-wall demolishing adventure games with unlikable protagonists, but this one was a gift from the heavens and rejuvenated my interest in the genre. Even when not compared to bad ones, It's a very good game, with a lot of care and love put into it, by very talented and imaginative people. It's funny, well produced and has its own unique charm. Very much recommended if you're a fan of adventure games.
