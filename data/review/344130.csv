[h1]Overall Rating - Seriously Flawed ★★☆☆☆[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1] 
Not only do I not remember where I got Cataegis : The White Wind (CW), I don't even remember how many times I've thought about playing it again so that I can review it, but just haven't had the interest or desire to do so. Checking the dates, I first played it back in 2017, so it's certainly long overdue. There's no reason to hold it off any longer, so let's get this over with. 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Based in part on how the game looks, I'd imagine it draws inspiration from platforming classics of the NES era, such as Castlevania or Ninja Gaiden. You'll fight off enemies using your sword, advancing past obstacles, and occasionally getting power-ups. Stages might include a mini-boss, but otherwise each will end with a boss battle. One thing I'll give the game credit for is not having sluggish movement speed or attacks, as the main character here isn't held back by his suit of armor. The thing about older games is that they were simple and straightforward, so I believe that's about all there is to it.


[h1]Controls[/h1] 
The game worked just fine with my controller, though I did find some of the choices a bit strange. For instance, there's a slide dash move, which you use by ducking and hitting the jump button. I kept expecting to use it by running first, as I'd think the two would be related. Another issue came from the running segment as you're being chased by a bus, because you'd outpace the vehicle and wind up on the far edge of the screen, unable to see any of the upcoming obstacles you need to dodge to get past that section. 


[h1]Story[/h1] 
In CW, you play as a white knight. No, not that kind. He's a true warrior, bestowed with the moniker White Wind. With the red embellishments on his uniform, it's not a bad design or concept, as it could have interesting symbolism. Plus, it'd reinforce that the protagonist does his actions in broad daylight, with nothing to hide. Unlike those rioters who wear all black. Throughout the game, you'll clear out enemy forces and take out their boss. At that point, you'll have the option to either spare their wretched life or execute them on the spot. I think that's a decent idea, as almost all games assume the death of the boss after you beat it, but why not make it a matter of choice after you've vanquished them? 


[h1]Visuals[/h1] 
CW's saving grace isn't in its visuals, and it's not for the reason you might expect. The pixel graphics get the point across as to what everything is, and generally I don't think the designs are that bad. Admittedly, I do find the main character's running animation kind of goofy looking. What really sinks the visuals for me is how certain colors are heavily overused, often within the same screen or area. After you finish the tutorial, which was primarily blue, the first screen is almost exclusively yellow. You're walking past a series of buildings, and they're all made up of this same material with almost no breaks, except for large slabs of gray. There's an odd distortion about how colors are distributed, as if they were really limited on how many they could make use of, and it makes for a lot of unpleasant backgrounds, “Welcome to the future, where everything is either red or yellow.”


[h1]Sound Design[/h1] 
Something else I'd give the game credit for is having pretty solid music. I wasn't able to find a soundtrack online, but when I listened to the tunes instead of playing the game, I enjoyed the music. There's a few notes with an odd quality to them, but it otherwise makes use of a good sound font to produce the songs. They're lively and upbeat, making for a good accompaniment to the gameplay style the developers were aiming for. I believe bosses also have unique tracks as well, though I couldn't verify that. 


[h1]Pros[/h1] 
🌟 Your character has respectable movement speed and attack range. 
🌟 It's not Labor Day yet, so wearing white is still acceptable. 


[h1]Cons[/h1] 
❌ The game is unforgiving, as I had difficulties on the first level. I didn't really feel like trying multiple times to get past it, though I had more success with it before. Maybe I was more patient then. 
❌ There's 32 endings, but why would you want to beat this game 32 times to unlock them all? I'm not even beating it once. 


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 You won't fight bosses using careful dodges and hitting those sweet spots with perfect timing. Learn how to clear the stages while taking minimal damage and spam your attacks until the boss falls. 
🔍 The game design isn't advanced enough that anything will change one attempt to the next. Memorization will help. 


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] 
Over time, I've become more discriminatory in what bundles and games I acquire, and based on the review score CW has, I wouldn't have gotten it in the first place by my current standard. So, in some ways, reviewing it feels slightly like beating a dead horse, but I've got plenty more of those to tackle in my library. Either way, the disappointing aspect about CW is that there are some good ideas here. You can use a handful of weapon power-ups and charge moves for various situations. The mobility is theoretically pretty good with the ability to run and dash-slide. However, much like the visual design, it falls apart in the execution. 

Based on how the mini-boss was designed on the first stage, it's as if you're expected to carefully dodge all of those attacks; the massive wall of fire, his charge forward, and both the projectiles he shoots and the ground sweep effect after they land. Then, you'd hit him with a solid charge attack, maybe a few follow-up swipes with the sword, and start dodging again. Due to how large your character and enemy attacks are though, that's not at all how you'll really play CW. You'll either get to the boss fight with enough health and lives to tank it by spamming your attack, or fail. What was intended doesn't line up with reality, and makes for an unsatisfying gameplay experience. It shows how much fine-tuning is required to get all those important aspects just right: visuals, controls, proportions, HP, damage, and so forth. I can't recommend getting CW.

Resolution is locked and can't be changed, and the developers were unable to make the game work in widescreen, it displays 4:3 pillarboxed.  Presumably this was designed using, and intended for, people whose only PC display is old CRT monitors from the 1990's salvaged from dumpsters and garbage dumps.  Unfortunately I can't think of any gamers who rely on ancient CRT monitors, I'm pretty sure everyone is using widescreen LCD panels nowadays, so what the developer hoped to achieve by making a game for nobody is unclear.   Regardless, the visual quality of this game is wholly appropriate for the dumpster they found their CRT monitors in when developing this game. 

Gameplay is clunky, unpolished and unsatisfying, to go with the godawful visuals.  They chose to use obsolete retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[i]Cataegis : The White Wind[/i] is a challenging action-platformer game with a great-looking intro and 4 main stages. The game also has 32 endings in total.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 32 endings
- 7+ unique bosses
- 2 game modes
- 3 weapon types
- You need to utilize your weapons properly; spamming attacks won't get you anywhere in the game

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Keybinding doesn't work
- You can't save in one of the game modes
- Dash tends to not work properly
- You can't skip the credits

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]Yes.[/b]
[i]If you like challenging platformers, you should buy this game. You might want to buy it on a discount if you don't want to unlock all endings since the gameplay time might be reduced a lot.[/i]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses 2D sprites for its graphics. The characters and enemies are made in great detail while the background is just... amazing. Although most of them are static, there is this one stage where the background moves and it looks like 3D even though it's not.

There are also a lot of animated cutscenes in the game and I can see that the dev put a lot of effort into it, especially since they animated some of them - even when someone is just moving their mouth to talk.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The game dumped the prologue right after you start the game, followed by an animated cutscene that looks like an anime opening. I had some trouble in understanding the words in the prologue, but it can be simplified as ""a main hero that wants to kill a God"" story. 

There are 32 endings in this game. Some are disappointing because there isn't much story in it, but I find some of them to be entertaining. However, there is this one ending where some of its dialogues are empty. Luckily, you can read the dialogue [url=https://youtu.be/tG_lu_P-q9c]here[/url].

[h1]The game[/h1]
[b]Levels[/b]
The game has 2 modes. You need to complete the first mode, [i]Main Stage[/i], before unlocking the second mode, [i]The Ziggurat[/i]. The [i]Main Stage[/i] has 3 stages and a boss right at the end of each stage while [i]The Ziggurat[/i] has more content and endings.

Although [i]The Ziggurat[/i] mode has 4 main bosses that are available at the end of each main stage, it also has 3 minibosses in the first three of the main stages, 5 extra bosses, and one extra stage that can be unlocked if you fulfill a certain condition.

Although it's enjoyable at the first few runs, the game becomes redundant after a while. Since there are 32 endings, you're bound to do at least 32 runs if you want to unlock all of them. The game makes it easier by giving a save option after you finish each of the main stages, but it still doesn't help since you need to redo at least the last stage once and rewatch the credits in the ending that you can't skip. My brain became numb after replaying the game a few times and the game doesn't even reward these kinds of replay greatly either since some of the endings are just disappointing.

Actually, the game rewards the player by giving a powerup in New Game+ if you fulfill a certain condition, but the best that it does is making the game easier, which only helps a bit since you already remember most of the game at that point.

[b]Controls[/b]
The first thing that I noticed from this game is that I could't change my keybindings. Sure, the game might give an option to change your keybinding on the launcher, but it doesn't seem to work. I even ended up relaunching the game because I couldn't reset it back to the default after I tried to change one of them.

Luckily, the control isn't that bad. You can move with arrow keys, attack with Z, jump with X, change weapon or cancel your selection with C, and pause or do a selection with the enter button. It might be problematic for people that don't use the QWERTY keyboard though.

Anyway, although most of the control is fine, I was having trouble with the dash control. You can activate dash by double pressing an arrow key to dash in that direction. However, it tends to not work when I wanted it to dash and it always triggered whenever I didn't want it to happen.

[b]Shop[/b]
There is a shop after you complete each of the main stages where you can spend the scores you get from killing enemies. You can use it to buy a special weapon, health, weapon charge, and even lives. You also can talk to the NPC to just chat or unlock a certain ending.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
This game is.. hard. Really. I was mad a lot of times in the first few hours and kept on asking whether it is possible to finish the stage. I even got mad because I couldn't spam my attacks to kill the bosses. It turns out that the game heavily relies on its special weapons, which are coded as R, S, and B.

The R weapon has a long range and normal damage, S weapon will allow you to hit enemies above or below you while having low damage, and B weapon has short-range and high damage. You need to keep on changing these weapons based on the situation. However, you must buy these weapons at the shop to use it and you'll lose these weapons if you lose a life while having it equipped. There's still a standard weapon that you can use, but it's very hard to finish the stage with it without taking damage.

[b]Bosses[/b]
Each boss has unique attack patterns and you have to learn how to avoid their attacks and damage them, especially since they have a lot of HP. Actually, you can spam attack on them if you have a lot of lives, but it's very unlikely to happen unless if you're fighting the last boss. In fact, there is even a boss whom I couldn't figure out the pattern at this point and I defeated it by spamming my strongest attack.

[b]Saving[/b]
To be honest, I was looking for a save option right after I finished the first stage of the [i]Main Stage[/i] mode. It turns out that you can't save in that mode. Luckily, you can finish it in ~1 hour and the game offers a checkpoint after finishing each stage.

The game only offers a save option in [i]The Ziggurat[/i] mode. You can save before each stage and the game will also offer checkpoints in case you died.

[b]Dying[/b]
The game has 2 options of reloading when you die. There is a load game, an option to load from a save point or the last checkpoint in that save file if there's any, keeping all of your lives, extra weapons, and scores in that save, and continue, an option to load your save by keeping your score and losing all of your extra weapons. To be honest, I only used the first option since the game punishes you greatly if you don't have the extra weapons.

[b]Length[/b]
I finished the [i]Main Stage[/i] in ~1h and [i]The Ziggurat[/i] in ~4h when I played it for the first time. You can finish the first one in less than 30 mins and the second one in ~1h if you know what to do though. If you're only looking to 100% the achievements, it took me less than 10h to get them all.

[b]Problems[/b]
The game has a lot of minor bugs that I can't describe one by one due to a character limit in the review. There is also one problem that I believe is a bug since I couldn't seem to get the last powerup to get a 100% completion rate at this point.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's a challenging platformer game that can be played in short bursts. There are 32 endings in total and some of them might be disappointing since they don't have a lot of content in it.

In a point enemies are too huge and has really long attacks and you can dodge one attack but not the other 3 attacks on the screen. So the best strategy is to shut your brain down and just spamm attacks while sliding throught the floor eventually you kill everything.

But if you waste time dodging and such you end up being knocked back and waste time while you take more and more damage.

The space you have to move is extremelly small in comparation of the size of the enemies and their attacks, so again you better just swalking forward spamming attacks and hopefully the enemy will die before you. game doesn't seem to reward skill at dodging or ""cutting rockets"" what's the point of cutting rockets if oyu gonna get hit by a massive flamethrower anyways?

But then some bosses can be beaten buy just crouching in a corner spamming attacks nonstop.

Yes, it's a hard game. Yes, there are certain aspects of the game you can progress and get better at. But there are also situations where you simply can't react to your enemies, and end up taking unavoidable damage, because the enemies have little to no animations to allow you to predict their behavior, or because the enemies are not even on the screen.

There are other smaller annoyances, too:

- The game has checkpoints that get reset when you exit the game, forcing you to start over earlier than you would have if you lost all your lives during the game.
- The power-ups also make little sense. First and foremost, they don't at all resemble the power-ups you see on your status bar. And their behavior is unpredictable. Some of them only change one of your abilities. Some of them change both. And one of them restores your health, BUT only when your health is just below full, otherwise it appears to do nothing at all.
- The character uses abiliities in cutscenes that you don't have access to at that point in the game.
- A general sense that you don't have enough time to react to things
- Double tapping to sprint is a pain. Luckily, sprinting is useless.

I guess, while I'm here, I'll name a few redeeming qualities of this game I noticed, in the short time I played:

- Music and art are decent. Not gorgeous, but not amateur either.
- Doesn't make you spam-press buttons.
- The enemies, while generally not enjoyable to fight and overcome, are at least varied.

Die Story ist ebenso hanebüchend wie sie schon in der guten alten Zeit bei diesen Games war. Die Welt ist irgendwie in Gefahr und wir sind ein toller Held mit Schwert um selbige zu retten.

In hohem Tempo schnetzeln wir uns durch humanoide Gegner, Roboter und andere Viecher und springen auch gern mal über Plattformen. Es gibt zahlreiche Spezialangriffe, Laserstrahlen oder Feuerwände, es gibt Duellsituationen mit Bossgegnern und es gibt übertriebene Comic-Zwischensequenzen. Das Ganze garniert mit einem treibenden 8-Bit-Sound und einem hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad.

Zumindest theoretisch. Denn ich hab das große Problem, daß das Game bei mir nicht richtig läuft. Statt hohem Tempo kann ich nur die extrem langsame Senioren-Version mit ständigen Rucklern zocken. Egal in welcher Auflösung, egal in welcher Konfiguration, eine Lösung ließ sich nicht finden.  

Auch anstrengend, daß die Controllersteuerung bei mir nicht funktioniert und auch die Tastenbelegung, die auf englische Tastaturen ausgelegt ist, nicht umgestellt werden kann.

Dadurch bleibt denn kaum Spielspaß übrig, im Gegenteil ist das Game nahezu unspielbar. Schade.

Sitten kun saat edes jonkinlaisen tyydytyksen tunteen vastoinkäymisen jumalien voittamisesta, niin peli loppuu kuin seinään. Tai ainakin siltä se tuntui, kun periaatteessa ekan levelin jälkeen peli heitti vain valikkoon takaisin. Sain toki avattua jonkun toisen pelimoodin, jossa tapetaan vankilassa vihollisia ja sitten ostetaan rahoilla aseita/enkkuja/jotain (en muista oikein kun pelaamisesta on niin kauan). Tätä toistetaan ja itse lopetin johonkin kolmanteen vaiheeseen, koska se hyppimiskohta ärsytti ihan sootanasti, kun joka tasanteella oli vastustaja odottamassa. Sitten siihen tuli perään joku imbaboss, joka kierteli sitä kymmenen kilometrin korkuista hallia ylös alas. Pari kertaa jaksoin koittaa pysyä sen mukana ja sitten totesin, että ihan sama. Kunnon pettymysten peli.

Jos elämästä alkaa olemaan muutenkin jo kiinnostus kadoksissa, niin sama kai tätä on pelata. Muuten suosittelen säästämään rahat.",1533561781,1533561781,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Die Acido Cinza Entwickler Studio wissen einfach wie man 100 Prozent gibt. Alleine schon beim Opener konnt ich mich nicht lange aufm Platz halten und musste,
als die Musik begann richtig zu ballern, das Menü alles auseinandernam und als es dann endlich los ging wusste ich: Dat ist ja ma der nackte Wahnsinn!

Spielerisch sind wir hier auf einem ganz hohen Niveau, so sagen sie ""Cataegis : The White Wind"". Dabei wissen die Entwickler natürlich ganz genau, das in diesen Spiel kein Wind sondern die absolute Aktion ist. Aber wer denkt, sie haben ein Fehler gemacht: Äh-Äh! Das Spiel .. äh... dieses Meisterwerk wird beendet mit den Worten: "" The End "" um damit den bildlichen Vergleich zu vervollständigen und das Spiel zu einem legendären seiner Art zu machen, der seinesgleichen sucht.

Ebenfalls die Titel sind bewusst und provokativ lang gehalten und aus: ""Cataegis"" wurde ""Cataegis : The White Wind"". Wer mit solch sadistischen und jugendgefährdenden Titeln im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes ""weggeblasen wird "", der versteht eindeutig sein Handwerk. Da die Acido Cinza Entwickler Studios wussten, das ""Cataegis : The White Wind"" aufgrund des sadistisch angehauchten Titels und der Gefahr der Nachahmung fast indiziert worden wäre, zeigten sie den restlichen Spieleentwicklern erneut den Mittelfinger und bewiesen erneut stahlharte Eier mit einem noch sadistischeren und gewaltverherrlicherenden Nachfolger. Großes Lob dafür!

Was hebt aber jetzt genau dieses Spiel von den anderen ab, und macht es zum Besten ihrer Karriere?
Ganz einfach! Das Gameplay und die Grafik! Es heißt ""es ist FULLHD "", doch es fühlt sich an wie 4k. Das passt perfekt zum Gameplay und ist wohldurchdacht.

Negative Punkte sind kleine technische Unzulänglichkeiten, wie dass das Spiel auf einigen 64-Bit Systemen stark verlangsamt läuft und dass man im ersten Level bei der Flucht aus dem Gefängnis den letzten Gegner nicht töten kann, weil man ihn wegen eines Bugs nicht mit dem Schwert trifft. Diese Bugs ließen sich durch Installation auf Windows 7 32 Bit beheben. Dort lief das Spiel fehlerfrei und wegen der sehr niedrigen Systemanforderungen läuft es auch in einer VM.

This game got some potential in it and I can see that whoever made this is competent but its not a well made game as it is.

The art style is not consistent- some images were made very well and others are just crude and ugly to the point where the cards that you get from the game that show the same characters look far better.
As an advice for future projects or a remastered version of this game – in order to make the game art for the characters, some cutscenes and combat animation to be more consistent, work more on your drawing skill because I saw very good looking parts here. 

The idea for the different sword techniques is really great but its really hard to figure from the HUD what you are about to use - larger size of the HUD icons could help.

Widescreen could be nice, I do get that this game meant to mimic the NES era but not having widescreen then was limitation of the technology and even then you could see in games like Contra, Ninja Gaiden and Double Dragon that more of the environment was visible in order to see whats coming and respond fast enough to avoid cheap deaths, but here everything is too close up.

I really liked the music in the game, its fitting and do its job so no complaint here – good job on this.

The animation for the main character could be better…the idle animation and also the running with the sword looks awkward.

Some boss are just frustrating for the wrong reasons, the little room to maneuver and not knowing what can damage you on touch in the big bosses fights is really annoying.

I really cannot recommend this game to anyone in its corrent state, it very flawed and could use more work on it.",1510602807,1510603346,False,1,0,0.490656375885009766,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I hate the controls and there does not see o be a way to change the controls so im stuck with the awkward controls that are preset into the game. Overall i would have enjoyed it if someone could actually draw better and there were options to change the controls.

Cataegis : The White Wind est un jeu style rétro, que ce soit dans ses graphismes, que dans son gameplay, tout en ne s'enfonçant pas dans la répétitivité que pouvait imposer les jeux ""old style"". 
Niveau Gameplay, on pourrait le comparer à un Castlevania. Le jeu est assez difficile au début, voir frustrant, et avec un coté ""die and retry"", mais très plaisant une fois que l'on les contrôles en main.
Le jeu propose des succès très marrant à faire et 32 fins possibles, dont la moitié sont super bien travaillé : on passe de la joie à la mélancolie, en passant par la colère d'une fin à l'autre. Le seul autre jeu capable de faire ça que je connaisse est Undertale, sortie quasiment en même temps.

[h2]Quando il Vento Bianco Soffia, i Pixel Tremano[/h2]
Immaginate di essere catapultati indietro nel tempo, in un'epoca dove i giochi erano un tripudio di pixel e la difficoltà era tale da farvi lanciare il joystick contro il muro. Bene, [b]Cataegis : The White Wind[/b] è la tempesta perfetta che unisce nostalgia e sfida, in un'era dove il ""salvataggio automatico"" è considerato una leggenda urbana. Questo gioco è come trovare una vecchia console in soffitta, polverosa ma pronta a regalarvi emozioni forti, con la sola differenza che ora avete l'ADSL e potete lamentarvi online della sua difficoltà.

[h3]Un Gameplay Che Taglia Come una Lama Affilata[/h3]
[b]Cataegis : The White Wind[/b] si presenta come un action-platformer che sembra uscito direttamente dagli anni '90, con un protagonista che ha più mosse di un ballerino di break dance armato fino ai denti. La precisione è la chiave, e ogni salto, ogni attacco deve essere calcolato con la precisione di un orologiaio svizzero sotto l'effetto della caffeina. E se pensate che questo sia tutto, preparatevi a boss che sono così grandi da non entrare nemmeno nello schermo, costringendovi a chiedervi se stiate giocando un videogioco o facendo un test di resistenza psicologica.

[u]Pro[/u]
- [b]Grafica retrò che fa battere il cuore:[/b] Ogni pixel sembra avere una sua anima, contribuendo a creare un'atmosfera unica che vi catapulterà indietro nel tempo.
- [b]Sfida ad alta tensione:[/b] Per chi ama sudare freddo davanti allo schermo, questo gioco offre una difficoltà che soddisfa i palati più esigenti.
- [b]Colonna sonora che incendia l'adrenalina:[/b] Le tracce musicali sono così coinvolgenti che potreste ritrovarvi a fare air guitar con il controller in mano.

[strike]Contro[/strike]
- Potreste scoprire che il vostro vocabolario di imprecazioni è più limitato di quanto pensavate, soprattutto nelle fasi più complesse.
- La difficoltà a volte può sembrare un muro insormontabile, che testa più la vostra pazienza che le vostre abilità videoludiche.

[spoiler]Il finale vi farà girare la testa più di un loop-the-loop in un jet a reazione.[/spoiler]

[h2]Un Viaggio nel Tempo Che Non Dimenticherete Facilmente[/h2]
In conclusione, [i]Cataegis : The White Wind[/i] è una lettera d'amore scritta in codice binario agli anni d'oro del gaming, una sfida che riaccende la passione per quei giochi che non ti chiedevano di premere ""X"" per non morire, ma di imparare, sudare e superare i propri limiti. Se siete pronti a mettere alla prova le vostre abilità (e la vostra pazienza), questo è il gioco che fa per voi.

[h3]Voto finale: 4 stelle[/h3]
Nonostante alcune piccole frustrazioni, [i]Cataegis : The White Wind[/i] riesce a catturare l'essenza di ciò che ha reso grande il gaming retrò, offrendo un'esperienza che è allo stesso tempo una sfida e un piacere nostalgico.

This game does feature a main character with a set mind on saving the world. I can already list more than a dozen games off the top of my mind with that plot. The game play is also similar with the games that I used to play in the past. In Cataegis: The White Wind you can destroy or jump over obstacles, engage and dodge enemy attacks and so forth. By the end of each level you face a boss, all having a different approach to combat and must defeat them in order to proceed – Must I say more?

I see one drawback here though, and that is on how the game was fashioned. In many side-scrolling games, your character can be placed in the centre of the map or on the left. It is the former in this case, but I’d much prefer the latter instead. Many of the enemies have ranged attacks, but we do not. We only have melee attacks, and because of that it’s much harder to counter, let alone, dodge projectiles when we are unable to see it in advance due to our position on the screen. 
 
As for the design, the game establishes 8-bit graphics. I am not a big fan of the game visuals, but in retrospect, it is a good imitation of what used to be popular in the 80’s. Same goes to the audio and effects. 

All of this leads to another concern. The game is so focused on imitating the past that the developers seem to have forgotten about the current demands and trends in gaming. It’s 2017. Creating an old-school game is great, but it doesn’t present anything new. It’s a game that I can certainly see being popular 10 or so years ago, but not at this time. 

Now, not to say that using any past concept or form of an old game is bad. In fact, a lot of games that has been around are influenced by them. There are successful ones such as Terraria, and Outland. Terraria has the 8-bit graphics, and is made to be an open-world adventure. Outland is also a side-scroller, with a synonymous plot as Cataegis: The White Wind, but has its own unique theme design. It’s the matter of compromise: what is popular now, with what is popular before and how to combine them.

Overall, this game is not worth trying out. You’re better off playing any old 2D arcade action retro-style game that you still have. No need to waste 10 dollars to purchase something similar, but published far too late on the timeline of video games.",1494083836,1494083836,False,12,0,0.622454583644866943,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Добротная 2D аркада сделанная в ретро стиле, сопровождаемая замечательной музыкой, которая отлично вписывается в происходящие события. 

По сюжету Cataegis: Белый ветер, лучший воин ордена Caeliger был отправлен на важное задание – уничтожить таинственное Божество по имени Иштар.
А что из этого выйдет, и выйдет ли вообще, будет зависить от ваших действий.
Привязанность к Cataegis-у Горгоны, ответы в диалогах, оставленные в живых боссы и даже смерть в определённых местах влияет на исход события. И всё потому, что в игре более 20-ти концовок. Открывать эту “ширму” самостоятельно и без какой либо помощи я бы назвал мазохизмом, но что сделано разработчиком, то сделано. Это наверное единственный минус игры на мой взгляд. Не люблю перепроходить десятки раз одни и те же уровни, однако же мой интерес узнать побольше о персонажах и развязках был сильнее желания остановиться.

Поначалу игра кажется сложной, но изучив все тонкости, на что уйдёт от силы пара прохождений, она перестаёт быть таковой и проходится в среднем минут за 30-ть.
Cataegis вооружен мечом, который можно усовершенствовать специальными адаптерами. Умеет делать подкаты и даже двойные прыжки, что помогает добраться до секретов и виртуозно расправляться с врагами. А проходя игру разными способоми, вам постепенно будут открываться специальные возможности, которые можно использовать в новой игре +, что значительно облегчит повторное прохождение.

Игра разделена на две части. Main stage, как бы предыстория, пройдя которую станет доступен Ziggurat mode, состоящий из четырёх уровней и одного опционального уровня.
Разновидностями врагов игра не блещет, солдаты да дроны. И конечно, соблюдая все традиции, в конце каждого уровня поджидает босс.

Подводя итоги, скажу, что игра хорошая. Особенно должна понравиться любителям ретро игр.

With a bit of work this could turn into something really good, but needs a lot of polish, also In a way I'm getting kind of tired of these old ""retro art"" gimmick used to excuse poorly designed games, in this case is not excuse... retro yes... but it's still horrible and badly animated.

The gameplay is straightfoward, a sidescroller in the likes of Ninja Gaiden but without it's charm.
You control something that looks like censored japanese genitalia (lots of pixels together)and you move to the right killing unfair enemies until you get to an unfair boss so you can progress to the next level,  you can also jump and strike with your sword, that can also get powerups ""contra wise"",  game is not bad and it's very fast paced, a bit unfair sometimes but enjoyable. Also the music is one of the best points of the game.

My mayor complain on this game is that I usually play games in short sessions and on this one there's no savepoint or ""password"", so if you leave the game you have to start from the beginning.

Should you buy it?
To be honest, wait for a sale or a giveaway.

This is a Retro pixel hack and slash  game.


[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

You are able to toggle the music volume. No sliders.
You are able to toggle the sound volume. No Sliders.
You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.
You are able to change the controls on the controller.
There is a tutorial level.

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You play with some ninja character knight thing. You have to defeat the enemies by hacking and slashing. You can find power-up on the way each with their own style and advantages. Each weapon type has 2 different styles.  Each power up has their own different styles. You can refill the charge meter by  attacking and killing enemies with normal slash attacks. You can find health and lives, They are rare however. There are ""hidden"" checkpoints from time to time. So if you ran out of lives you will be transported to the latest checkpoint. If you lose a life, you will also lose the current power-up. You start with only 1-2 lives each time. Bosses has a health bar will be shown at the bottom. The score at the top is also your cash. 

There is NO ALT TAB to open the steam overlay
Game is a bit difficult even on the first level.
You play on a small screen.
Great soundtrack.
There is a story.
Not alot of lives to start with.
Unfair enemy attack patterns and weird hitboxes
Score is also your money.
Good pixel scenery but could be ""overlap"" to the stage.
The HUD is a bit ""Left out""
Good Tutorial but hurtful to the eyes.
There is a save slot.
There is NO game over screen. (That you have to beat the entire level over again from the beginning).

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

If you like mindless killing and don't think about it too deeply. This game might be alot of fun.
But do keep in mind that it could be frustating.

There is no doubt that 'Cataegis' captures the style of old generation platformer games.  Despite that accomplishment, the same can't be said about the gameplay.

The player's engagement distance is limited to a small fraction of the screen while all too often enemies have ranged attacks or are placed in positions that all but force the player to take damage in order to get close enough to defeat.  Boss patters are simplistic often relying on spamming screen filling attacks to slam the player.

This game was a borderline decision for me; honestly it could have gone either way. I even anticipate some people will really enjoy this. Overall, it was just too difficult and the controls were not fluid enough for me to master or truely enjoy the game. This game offers some really challanging gameplay; love it or hate it... Its definately not worth $10!

The pixelated graphics and old school game feel really do this title justice. I honestly like most things about this gane; but the combat system ultimately proved to be too much! The combat system is straight forward but there are a plethora of different attacks you must utilize to succeed. This isn't always apparent and switching to another attack can prove extremely difficult when in the heat of battle. 

Overall, Worth $2.99 Tops and only if you love retro/difficult side scrollers.

[u] Summary: [/u]
Remember the days of NES Hard? Remember the games that focused on patterns and precise moments like Ninja Gaiden and Strider? That's basically what Cataegis: The White Wind attempts to emulate, and it does it to a reasonable extent. It's hard, but as you learn the patterns you get better, and the mix of contra like weaponry and the slicing and dicing of Ninja Gaiden/Strider is nice on the surface. But if you don't remember those days fondly, or specifically never experienced those days at all: you're in for a world of hurt here. Controller support needs to be added immediately, while it indicates partial support, I never got it working, and this game screams for it due to the precision of movement needed,  and the frustration of the dash command (double arrow = sprint seemed to only work once in a while). The challenge can feel unfair as it's sticking strickly to the old material, and that can really lead to some cheap deaths in the end off screen. [b]This is only for the hardcore NES hard fanbase, and those who play it  who love those old dayswill get some enjoyment out of it. Just don't expect to get very far until you've had a bit of practice.[/b]

[*] Captures the old Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes and presentation well, mixing it with other NES classics. Looks nice for what it is.
[*] Different weapons have reasonable differences with a 2 power system for specific situations. 
[*] Dev is super responsive. Faced problems, was quick to answer, and attempt to get me information. Seems passoniate about fixing problems and project.

[*] Don't like being a masochist of sorts? Stay away from  this game. The difficulty is brutal beyond belief. Just check the video to see why.
[*] Certain enemies needed “tells” to show what they were doing next, as that led to some unfair damage at times.
[*] Certain times if you didn't have the right power/were out of charge meter, you'd be forced to take damage because of it. 
[*] Needs full controller support, or an easier way to get it working, because my Xbox 360 controller could not be used with it (at least in how I attempted to get it working).
[*] Resolution support is meh, as it does really keep to that old style. 
[*] You will get some bugs here and there based on the experience (even after patches).

The Achievement has just been addressed if the update is already live, and you can turn it off on the game's options - you will still have Achievements unlocked on your profile, they just won't show up if it's the case (Steam Overlays required DirectX and I tried to get this to be as low-fi as possible, even as far as compatibility with less powerful computers).

The bugs you encountered were really rather out of left field, but I'm very glad you managed to contact us with them prior to release. No less, after that my partner did a thorough run on Windows 7 and it seemed to be fine for the rest - he encountered that same glitch you contacted.

However what is also puzzling is that I use the 360 pad, and he also uses the 360 pad and it works fine for us. But he's on Windows 7, so maybe it's a Windows 8 driver issue. If you could go on more detail why is it not picking your controller, please let me know and see if we can work that out. If not, I imagine you know of the existence of Joy2key - it's a great tool for any game that requires more of a controller setup and if the application isn't being cooperative.

I hope the game keeps you enthralled enough to see what else is there despite the rocky start. No mistake I've also made notes of what you mentioned too like the enemies having better ""tells"" or not. Thanks for the review!"
