Millennium 5 is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

This is more RPG Maker asset flipping from Falling Star Studio/Warfare Studios/Aldorlea Games/SimProse Studios/RosePortal Games (how many shell accounts does this guy need to push his asset flips??) who have now publisher over one hundred of these low quality RPG Maker asset flips on Steam, polluting the place and making gaming worse for everyone.  This is no different, it's a copy + paste of the previous four Millennium games, with the focus on finding secret areas, a terrible and painfully generic plot that has you looking for ""Warriors"", combined with the hallmark crap encounter design, lazy map design that probably took less than a day, bad game mechanics, terrible writing, grammatical and spelling errors.  There's only one town and just a string of linear dungeons to plod through, no real, substantial ""content"" in this asset flip.  This game is just pure trash, just like the last 100 of them.  That's right, this developer has made more games than Blizzard and Bioware put together.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Millennium 5 has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for playing the game for more than an hour, but less than 8 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 8 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Millennium 5 has the ridiculous price of around $6 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.",1684564018,1684564018,False,3,1,0.21213395893573761,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Millennium 5 was made to wrap up the Series with the long awaited battle for the Showdown which happens, but also lets you do a lot of optional content, showing you that there are still things to be done. When you play this last, you get a feeling that it might not end today. It might not end with the showdown, because I have done so much and I still have so much that needs doing. But you also think: well, nothing actually ends, right?

There are three endings and only one of them actually pays off for everything Marine has done. 

This is a strategic, political showdown that is not about punching your way through it with overleveled characters. 
This is a strategic showdown that needs the right people to win, the right people to lose and the right tension to let things change the ending picture.

You cannot punch your way through this game. It is not about being super high leveled that you will bring them down in one shot (unless it is the speed battle lol). You need to understand the full spectrum to end this game the way Marine wants it and for that, you have to pay attention. You have to read the dialogues, you have to read the quest signs and the big cues left behind for you to find.

If you are not the player who dives deep into the storyline, this game is not for you.

O jogo é mais longo que os anteriores, mas boa parte é filler, como quando 4 personagens ficam presos numa gruta e outros 4 tem que se desviar do objetivo da história para ir resgatá-los; ou quando você precisa passar pela mesma caverna 4 vezes seguidas para grindar. 

Durante a maior parte do jogo, os personagens ficam em grupos separados e cada grupo vai pra um canto. Infelizmente os desenvolvedores decidiram implementar um sistema de inventário distribuído que não ficou muito bom, já que o grupo da Marine fica com todo o dinheiro e itens do grupo, enquanto os demais grupos só recebem alguns trocados para comprar itens novos (as vezes nem isso!).

O tão aguardado torneio em Mystrock é outra decepção: ao invés de serem apenas 13 lutas com foi proposto desde o inicio, cada um dos 13 personagem do grupo deve lutar contra cada um dos 13 lutadores que representam Mystrock, totalizando 169 lutas divididas em 13 rodadas. As lutas são rápidas e geralmente acabam em um ou dois turnos, mas os personagens não podem usar nenhum equipamento alem do quimono (nem mesmo aqueles que o Benoit disse que poderia!) e as técnicas que eles podem usar lá são diferentes das que eles estiveram usando no resto dos jogos, fazendo com que as lutas dependam mais de sorte do que de estratégia. Não é tão ruim porque, a cada rodada (13 lutas), você pode escolher entre salvar o jogo, ir para a próxima rodada, reiniciar a rodada ou reiniciar o torneio inteiro se tiver com poucas vitórias; no entanto, você não pode vencer mais de 84 rodadas, do contrário levará um final ruim seguido de Game Over. O final verdadeiro do jogo também é muito vago e deixa várias pontas soltas, como por exemplo: [spoiler]a maldição da mãe da Marine, o Urso ser pai da Blodie, o sacrifício da Jeanne e a história por traz dos templos futuristas.[/spoiler]

Millennium 5 não é de todo ruim. Graça aos personagens se dividirem em grupos, a interação entre eles está muito melhor do que nos jogos anteriores. As 169 lutas no final do jogo também dão a oportunidade de que cada membro do time da Marine possa  interagir com os lutadores de Mystrock, que tiveram pouco ou nenhum destaque nos jogos anteriores. Além disso, e as dungeons estão mais bem distribuídas entre aquelas no estilo tradicional e as estilo de jogo de plataforma, ao invés de ficar muito num tipo só. No entanto, o jogo possui problemas demais para eu recomendar.",1656979782,1657113709,False,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I won't spoil anything from the story itself if I can help it. 

Look... I LOVED these games. I genuinely did. I enjoyed every installment tremendously, and always looked forward to playing and seeing more. I know they aren't perfect, but as I don't mind the usual limitations of RPGMaker games, playing Millennium had been a wonderful experience. I found the soundtrack enchanting and delightful. There was a lot to do and loads of secrets to find, and I found it cool how I could import the previous game's save into the next installment. 

The writing and the plot could be rough around the edges and naive at times, yet I found it engaging. That's because... I just LOVED EVERYONE who was introduced. There's like almost two dozen ""main"" characters and they all have their own moments I remember fondly. I loved their personalities, their chemistry and banter, their different strengths, their character development. This made the setting of Millennium so cool!

I was SUPER invested, as everything was woven together across multiple games, and just hyped me up so much toward the grand finale of the saga.

...And, that's also why I cannot bring myself to recommend the series, despite everything. The disappointing problem with Millennium is not what happens in the story. It's what doesn't happen. This is where the writing fails. At the very end, after all that hype and buildup... Millennium decided to give me basically nothing. 

I loved everyone. But I never found out what happened to them after the finale. The only exception was a laughably short and extremely vague text description of what happened to Marine, that prompted more questions than answers. There were no real final cutscenes or dialogue between the characters about any of the aftermath. My emotional investment for this story was met with no sense of closure. My invested feelings had nowhere to go, and it got me actually crushed.

In my understanding, it was the dev's conscious choice to leave things up to the player's imagination. But that makes me mourn the finality of it all even more. It just wasn't handled well after five games, after all the hype, after everything everyone went through. Thing is, from everything I've read from different forums and discussions, the maker of Millennium DOES have an idea of what happens to everyone canonically. There was even talk of a possible novella or something to wrap things up. Didn't happen though, unsurprisingly. 

Honestly, having a novella would've sounded nice, but mostly because of my hunger for ANYTHING more. My disappointment isn't about not getting some extensive ever-after stories for everyone. I wouldn't ask for that much. I was just desperate for some actual ending cutscenes with the characters interacting with each other in game, one last time. How do they feel now, what do they want from the future, what do they want to do next maybe? Small nudges to help lead the imagination to make interpretations matter more. 

I feel like there probably would've been several ways to leave things open-ended yet satisfying at the same time. An ending to an epic saga of five flippin' games requires and deserves extra passionate care. What we ended up with is nothing getting neatly wrapped up at all, with so many questions left unanswered that it's exhausting to think about. All that hype, leading up to a lot of homework that never feels the same as the real thing. 

If you think you will be okay with this notion, though... the fact that you will ultimately never have closure about your favorite characters, and abruptly will never see them or hear from them again... Well, the games can be fairly regularly on sale for like -90% so be on the lookout for that, get all the games for a total of like 5€, and go for it.

No jogo dois já tive uma surpresa desagradável: os itens até vem nos imports, mas o level dos seus personagens não ! Mas até aí paciência, segue o jogo...

A partir do terceiro eu comecei a comprar o jogo + guia, porque as vezes o jogo te deixa meio perdido, sem saber o que fazer.

Infelizmente a qualidade da história foi caindo nos outros episódios... neste quinto você tem que coletar itens em diversas partes... como são muitos personagens, cada grupo vai para um lado... e fica em idas e vindas entre os grupos... sei lá, não gostei.

Aí finalmente chegarmos a batalha final. 

Além de ser meio cansativa ( São mais de 160 lutas ! ) não gostei de duas coisas:

- Você precisa deixar seus personagens bem fortes ( nível acima de 80 ) ! Vai ficar um bom tempo subindo ele de nível numa certa parte do jogo... acaba ficando repetitivo;

- a idéia de você ter que ter um número certo de vitórias para ir para o ""final real"" realmente me deixou chateado. O final do jogo deve ser o padrão, não condicionado ! Quer fazer um ""final alternativo"" OK, mas aí sim neste caso colocado alguma condição específica para ele acontecer...

E por fim... o final é meio decepcionante. Poderiam ter trabalhado melhor, não ficamos sabendo de várias coisas... afinal de contas são mais de 100 horas até chegar nele !

- Balance in game: this game can be continue from previous game (Millennium 4) if you have the import file. If you decided to import the game, it doesn't mean you will get everything from previous game, and that what made this game less boring to me because I used to play RPG games with continue series similar to this and it become extremly boring because I maxed everything in series 1, so what the point of playing series 2? spent about 20hours on (normal mode) series 1 but about 5 hours on (normal mode) series 2!! seriously!!! so I prefer the limited import file than import the whole thing from previous game.

- Level up: in every RPG games, trying to max your character lvl is the most boring thing to do but in this series you get a dungeon that full of monsters to lvl up your characters. Eventhough going in and out of that dungeon many times to lvl up is boring but it gives alot of exp so your characters will lvl up faster.

-soundtrack: I really love soundtrack of this game since series 1, I don't know how to write this into word but I remember the first time I played and heard the sound, I was like ""WOW"" ""COOL"" and sometimes the character suddenly walking very fast include the soundtrack, it made this part of game feel funny. 

- story and game play: I think the 5th game is the most challenging in all series because it devided into many parts which make some quest become limited. So make sure to be well prepared, complete side quest and explore everything in your current place before moving into the next main quest because you might not be able to come back. Also that many parts of game make all of the playable characters become more useful because in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th game,  there are too many playable characters but why would I need to switch every single characters in the team when I only need 4 characters in the end of game? I wish the 2nd, 3rd, 4th game are more like the 5th game because I want all the playable become useful, not just a show. I love most of the dialog in this game especially the misplaced speech during the desperate situation because it add more heavy feeling that the current situation become very hopeless that they can't say the right word. The whole story since the 1st game untill the end was very well connected especially the real ending of the game, it make sense... I don't want to spoiler this so I only remind you that most people on Marine side aren't matrial artist and some of them started to fight barehand when there only a week or two left to train, so the real ending make the most sense for the whole story. 

-characters and artworks: characters design are beautiful, what I like the most is that all of them don't have any thing very similar, they are unique (face, hair, costume, height, muscle...) so it makes the design become creative. Eventhough the story never tell the background of enemies side, but the dialog is already enough to know who is bad and who is good.

Every single part in this Millennium series overall is five out of five stars. It is not too challenging, and has the right mix of play, upgrades, maps, quests and good characters. I admit I never complete all the side quests in the game, but I play the entire game to the end and love every second of it. 

This takes a lot for me to really get into games. I love how you can select your level of difficulty (I always select story mode for a more visionary and involved gameplay), you can select arrows that show you overall where to go, because it can be easy to get lost or take too long to find your way in these games (This is a BIG plus for me). Another big thumbs up is the ability to have VISIBLE monster encounters, so whenever possible we can avoid them. I absolutely HATE random surprise encounters, that not only interrupt the flow of the game, but take away your concentration from where you were at. 

Also, the music score is one of the best ever, and has some very melodic catchy tunes, and soft moody background expressions in the scores. Very nice and rare to see this in a JRPG/RPG maker game. Many of the games seem to repeat the same flat audio/music, and I am happy to see the Millennium series is more unique.

And finally, I love that you can import the last saved game from part to part so you take your levels and most items with you. I highly recommend this game series!",1521476049,1521476049,True,2,0,0.473372787237167358,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Excuse my recorded time, I play offline. 

I played the Millennium series as each came out over the years and this most recent playthrough was just to experience the game again. I have a soft spot for rpg-maker games and Aldorlea always pleases me. 

Pros: 
+The music is lovely. It truely gives this game atmosphere.
+ beautiful mapping. I have a good imagination and I love the way the devoloper uses the assets and lighting to create the world of Myst
+ SECRETS GALORE! It may be a con for some but I love poking around the maps to find secret rooms and collecting orbs hidden in the maps.
+ Import saves from previous games to keep your armor/items
+ Classic turn-based battles with a few little twists, nothing crazy (some gear can cause more hits, bonus fairy who pops up to heal or boost you, you can even call on her from your skills menu)
+ Diverse characters in your party who have strengths and weaknesses that you must make adjustments to your play style depending on who you choose to be in your party at that time
+ Battle rush option for when you are backtracking through previous visited locations and you are certain you can kill them quickly
+ Difficulty settings and the option to activate visible enemies
+ Option to activate arrows pointing you in the right direction (this is helpful because some maps are hard to navigate and the presence of the arrows are also a good indicator for where to avoid when you want to branch off on other paths)

Cons:
+ The writing is a bit juvenile at times. I was able to overlook this, some may find it a bit too saccharine 
+ Some bosses are sponges despite your party being overpowered, battles can be long. I actually did this playthrough on easy mode so that I could focus on exploration and I still had a hard time at certain parts. I remember when I originally played these games on normal mode I had a hard time. 
+ The final Showdown can mentally break you >_< Let me explain:

I have fond memories of this game. It's what drove me to replay. I do have to say that when I put 82 hours into a game and make a real attempt to find everything, complete every quest and level up as much as possible it can be really disheartening to reach the final showdown only to be absolutely creamed. Be warned that this whole series is leading up to a final battle between your 12 martial artists and the 12 martial artists who represent a goverment your main character wishes to overthrow for the btterment of the kingdom. All your work, all your exploration and all your leveling up may not make too much of a difference when that time comes! I'm not saying it's impossible, it can just be frustrating. You have plenty of chances in the end of the game to replay parts of the showdown. All I'm saying is that you should set aside a save file before you head to the final showdown just in case you need to go level up some more. It is likely that you will. 

Also note that for this last battle (technically over 100 battles in the showdown but it's set up like one long battle with little breaks), the battle dynamics completely change. You are stripped of your gear, your skills will narrow down to a few options and you will be limited on how many times you use them. You are also given the opportunity to trick your opponents which is basically like rolling dice. It can help or hurt you. You must have high stats and make good decisions and you must know your characters well. But beware! There are 3 endings and a very large margin of error and very small window to get the true ending. This can be frustrating but it can be done :)

I recommend this game with reservations. There are some good playthroughs on youtube to help give you an idea of what you are getting into.",1519609456,1519609456,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I guess for no reason... I played, won the tournament, and got a 'bad' ending.  No spoiler on what the ending is, but after reading other reviews, I was sorely disappointed.

I love the character art and the characters themselves.  The story's okay and I like the monster designs and the weird world they've built.  However, I can't recommend this chapter of the game as-is, since it's so unsatisfying or even all that interesting given the build-up.

I also recall the first game set this whole thing up as an adult telling a kid this story about how everything became some sort of near-utopia, which doesn't make much sense if you can get a 'bad' ending...  but then, that sort of framing device doesn't really work well anyhow.

Lo bueno  es que es un juego con un argumento redondo (a pesar de los largos diálogos que a veces son excesivos) y realmente si te gusta el rpg  puedes disfrutarlo.

I've played through all five games and while after the first one I didn't have much motivation to carry on, the second and third game are actually decent and offer a good amount of exploration, secrets and somewhat interesting characters. Still the main story and companion comments aren't good, but at least the gameplay keeps it together. That changes in game four. Not only does the game fall apart into lengthy dungeons with annoying secrets and almost nothing else, the story takes a turn for the even worse.

Introducing time pressure into an RPG Maker game doesn't work. It simply doesn't. The main character turns into a psycho forcing people to fight for her by burning down their house. The companion dialog gets overwhelming and so thin that it's just plain annoying. At the end of the fourth game my motivation that was kindled by the second and third game was running very low again.

Now it's time to talk about the fifth game. The game splits your characters into *5* groups quite early on and then happily jumps back and fourth between the groups without any real reason except for padding the game out a bit more. By now it's clear that the game was separated into five parts and then padded out to have the proper amount of 'content' in each of them. The story consists of endless and pointless rantings by all characters. It's by now really painful to read the overly lengthy and completely non-relevant dialog.

The dungeons are as to be expected long and boring, but (mostly) filled with enough monsters to train you for the big showdown. It feels tedious to drag through the game knowing that you only do it to train for the final battle. The worst bit though is when the game makes you play the exact same dungeon five times in a row. It's mind-numbingly boring.

Afterwards it's the 'good' old fight-99-dragons showdown with another round of meaningless dialog thrown in. If you hit a small window of grinding the right amount you get the better ending of the game, otherwise if you train too less or too much you get a worse one. That's it.

I still admire the amount of work that went into this game and there is a lot of good in the presentation (minus the horrible 'manmade' sound effects), but overall it just doesn't work. Make it a two part game, cut a lot of the ballast and you have something that is fun to play and that isn't dragged out this much. As it is there's just way too much dead weight for it to be a good game.",1444647519,1444647617,False,59,2,0.829631567001342773,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Your trainer is tough and hard, has military manners and will push you to the battle if you agree.

The Bear will lead the team to a lovely beach but also the damn place of training. It’s time to train for the showdown after smart lessons from the Bear in the Pit of Infinity where you have to kill monsters “infinitely”. You manage different parties, you choose who’s in each.
There’s an up to down scan of the palace and arena, flags, the crowd. The showdown duels tree-mapping is hard and long. It’s frustrating as you see lost duels and you have a minimum number to win each time. The enemies are dreadful, Meryll is brutal and stupid, one looks like an alien and loves to slay! You have short replies at the start of duels. Read carefully as it can give you clues on the enemy’s fighting profile. Even take notes and save well. Something happens after the 1st group of rounds and someone comes in handy against the last opponent: Lord Dragon.

It was truly a very amazing conclusion to the series and anyone who just dismisses these games for being made in RPG Maker is missing out on a great RPG.  Though I do feel that while this game could in theory stand alone, all the best moments mean so much more when you have played the first four games and really understand just how much everyone went through to finally make it to the grand finale.

About the only real drawback is that you do have to level up all your characters pretty high to have a shot in the final showdown, it's recommended to just max them all out.  That definitely took quite a bit of time, but the game does give you a very ideal chance to pull this off by basically having the plot send you off to go grind a ton.

I also do feel that it is obvious a lot of care was put into the dialoge for the tournament.  The dialogue between your characters and their opponents not only does a great job of characterization for everyone, but it varies depending on what your current score is, whether you won or lost that time, and what the character's overall win/lose record is.  Some of the dialogue is downright hilarious.  The characterization here is really great as well.  By the end of it I really had a good sense of what the Mystrock Lords and Ladies were like and actually even came to find a few of them to be interesting characters.  I definitely liked Gisele and Mai a lot.  Nate also was pretty interesting even if he was obviously meant to be hated.  Truly, all of them were interesting characters with distinct personalities and that shows the love that was put into the final showdown.  What was even more neat was the fact that enough care was taken to give each of them their own battle theme.  The soundtrack in this game was quite good even if it's been good in all the games so far, but this one just had some added stuf that did a great job of making all the scenes all that much more emotional.

However what really makes the game is the ending.  Even though it's pretty obvious that since we're playing as Marine and her friends that the true ending is for her to succeed, how this happens is not something that would be easily guessed.  I won't spoil it, but it definitely got quite the reaction out of me.  To me any game capable of making me feel something for the characters and events is doing it right.

I also feel this game did a much better job with the realism and having everything be well explained by the plot and done so well.  For example the game gives a beautiful excuse to have the Bear unable to be in your party for most of the game because you'd rely on him too much and not train the rest of the characters if you could.  The plot that came with that reason then gave a great excuse to use all those characters you haven't used since they games they joined in, though at times it was annoying because you'd get a party that really wasn't good and would need to grind a bit to have a shot.  The monsters in this game are definitely tough!

Overall pros:
+Quite a lengthy game, you're looking at about 30 hours of playtime and the tournament is actually not a large chunk of that.
+The characterization is top notch here.
+Very challenging monsters and the tournament is also pretty challenging as well even if the battles are shorter there

Overall cons:
-A lot of grinding.  While it's not as bad with it actually being justified by plot much of the time, there were points where it dragged because you needed to grind up a not so hot party.
-Definitely going to want to get the guide for this one because the parties switch up so often and you have to be well prepared to even have a shot.  The guide does a great job of advising without spoilers on how to prepare for all of this, howevr.
-As of now, the game has 6 broken achievements so it cannot be 100%ed without cheating.  The dev is aware and has been good about fixing them for other games, but it is likely to take time. Edit: As of 3/26/18 the broken achievements have now been either removed or fixed and the game is capable of being 100%ed.

So in the end, I very much recommend this game and truly, play the series from the beginning if possible.  The series ends up running at about 90 hours of play all together and a very large amount of that is very good and leading up to an incredibly epic conclusion that will mean all that much more if you started from the very beginning.  The final conclusion will mean so much more when you truly understand all the things Marine has done to get to this point and it really starts off with that fateful day when Marine left Green Grass, tripped on something and met a little fairy who decided to live in her earring from then on and it means so much more if you get to see Marine grow from being a weak peasant girl to being a capable martial artist who inspied others to join her on her crazy quest to challenge Mystrock.",1437348116,1522110814,True,30,2,0.654538273811340332,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Edit: Played a bit more while idling for cards.

So the game starts you off with a long cut scene that's just 13 (?!?) characters standing around arguing with each other for reasons?  Again, got this in a bundle so maybe it's more fun if you've played the previous games, but for a first timer to the series it's just a bunch of people you know nothing about yammering on.  Apparently we have to train to fight some dudes.

So you actually start playing.  There's a sidescrolling platformer thing going on for the level, which is actually a pretty cool idea.  You fight the actual enemies in your standard turn based rpg fight, which is a bit annoying as a new player because you have no idea what each character can actually do because again, the game assumes you've played the previous games.

This brings me to the menus... The game makes the weird choice to have almost half the screen space in each battle filled up by the character portraits.  They're not bad portraits (altho the four people you start out with appear to be generic white anime teens... maybe the rest of the cast is more diverse? I think the angry old dude was black?)  but it sucks that the also pretty decent monster art is being covered up/ squished.  It's also a little harder to see the hp, ect, as it's layered on top of the character art and semi transparent.  The out of combat menus also look a little weird imo.

About the art... The character portraits, the monsters, and the pixel character sprites all look pretty good on their own, but kind of clash when they're all on the screen together.  The difference between the really clean character art and the more textured monster art isn't too bad, but they really don't look good on a pixel background.  A lot the levels don't look great (especially the caves) and it looks like a photograph was used for the far background.

Other stuff:  There's a knock off Wolverine called Wolfgang, what.  The game is fully mouse compatible which is a nice change from most of these types of games.

Obviously, if you've played the first four you're going to play this and it's not a bad game on its own. However, there are things you should be prepared for.

First problem is, just like in Millenium 4, the overall game feels kind of lacking. There's one town and a lot of very long dungeons and that's about it. In the first two games, and, to a lesser extent, the third, it felt like there was more to the game world, more to discover, more NPCS and secrets other than the secret rooms. 

Second, the big showdown. This is what the entire series has been building up to and it's okay, but not much more. What should be tense and epic and interesting, is kind of. . .meh. Most fights are over in one or two hits. The quick fights make sense because there's over 100 fights in the showdown. However, with so many fights it kind of gets old. Depending on how your team is leveled it might be a tense thing, but it's not effective if the grand finale of the five game series only works if you're a certain level. If you're too low, you'll get slaughtered and get a bad ending. If you're too high-leveled, the tournament is a breeze and you'll still get a bad ending. That's right, the game punishes you for winning to much. To get the real ending, your score needs to be in a sweet spot range. So, if you're leveled too much, the high-stakes, series ending, super important tournament devolves into you purposely losing matches. It's dull and tedious to say the least.

Third, and the BIGGEST problem, is the writing and story. RPGs, especially RPG Maker games depend on the story because the gameplay is fairly standard. The story of the Millennium games has always been pretty light (find people for your team), but this should have been the grand conclusion. The ending should have wrapped everything up. It does not. There are three endings, two that are basically just ""game overs"" and the real one. Even the real one doesn't wrap things up. Things are brought up IN THIS GAME that don't see any closure. So many things are brought up and then the game goes, ""Okay, well, moving on."" All the characters? Barely factor into the narrative of the ending. I hope you weren't invested in any of them.The end goes by very fast and it's incredibly disappointing for an something that's been five games in the making. The ending, the real, grand wrap up, is brief, very passive text summing up the next few years. For the region, not the characters. Except Marine. Her last little bit feels so tacked on it feels like, ""I don't know. . .let's say THIS happened. Do you buy that? That kind of makes sense, right? I know that almost nothing has been built up for it, but. . .""

It's still an okay game, but very disappointing as the capper for a series.",1424129299,1437915000,False,111,2,0.833688914775848389,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Now add to the story the other positive elements of thegame

-the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and fully detailed.

-the music is never intrusive, but is captivating, and adds to the impetus of the game.

-the characters are numerous and fully fleshed out. The main characters come alive with personality whether the particular traits are heroic, simply ordinary, or foible laden. Each and every one of them is memorable. Even the monsters are creative and drawn beautifully with an extremely imaginative flair. 

-the variety to the game is enormous. So many choices. Which of 4 difficulty levels will you choose? Do you want a bit of directional guidance? Do you want the monsters visible or not?
 Depending on your choices, the game can be very long, even longer, or longest.
 So that adds to replayability. I can imagine going through this game multiple times, changing your selections every time.

This is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It is fantasy at its best, with many sidequests to complete, many hidden areas to discover, animal kings to discover, and lots of other secrets. So many ""a-ha!"" moments.

Since they only have a few days left, they basically need a miracle. And as it happens, the Bear knows a place where miracles can happen...
 That's how Millennium 5 starts. The story has many surprising twists and thrilling and emotional moments. And in the end, there's the Grand finale - The Showdown.

 The gameplay offers the traditional ""fight and explore"" experience, with many optional or secret locations and side-quests. Maps are two dimensional, but some of them are more ""platform-like"" and require a lot of jumping. Usually, the maps offer relatively straighforward route to the main objectives and many side areas with bonus loot and secret rooms. The bonus items do make a difference, especially on harder difficulties, so thorough exploration really pays off in this game.

 Battles are turn-based, with Speed attribute (and a bit of randomness) determining the characters action order. You can have four party members, plus Marine can summon Jeanne (the fairy). Each character can either attack, or use spell / abbility. Since Marine and the others need to train for The Showdown, they don't use weapons, only Bare Hands. Only some of the support characters (such as Marine's younger sister Merline) can use weapons.
 As for the spells, they have damage elements (red, blue, ...) and can have a chance for causing a ""status"" (Paralysis, Poison, ...). Since different enemies can be susceptible or immune to different elements and statuses, an appropriate strategy can change the battle outcome dramatically. For example some strong and dangerous enemies can be easily paralyzed and so on.
 Enemies often cast spells vith various effect, too - especially the bosses. Some of your party members are more resistant to these effects, some are less. You can help them with the right equipment, though. Add things like counter-attacking, multiple-attacks-equipments, health and mana regeneration, and you'll see soon enough that knowing the right equipment plays a major role.

 The Showdown represents a special part of the game. It's your 13 warriors against the Mystrock 13 ones, one on one. That is 13 rounds and 169 fights in total. It feels very intensive - no exploring, no random fights, just you and the Mystrock. The game ending depends on your score.
 In the battles, you have four options: defend (to help you survive enemies' special attacks), attack, use your abilities (different from the ""normal game"" ones, with limited number of usage - so you need to use them carefully) and try to ""trick"" your opponent (works well against the slower opponents). Based on the outcome and the total score, you get different dialogues and comments from both you party and Mystrock people. Some of these lines are pretty hillarious. Btw, beating the bully Merryll felt very satisfying.
 I should note one thing, though - no matter what difficulty you chose, for the Showdown the game always switches to Normal (to ensure a proper difficulty tuning).

 Apart from the main storyline, Millennium 5 offers a lot of optional content: Sidequests, secret rooms and animal kings. Animal kings are special tougher versions of some the normal enemies and all of them are only available in Hard mode. Since sidequests and secret rooms are pretty hard to complete, too. This adds an incentive for replaying the game. Usually, you start on Easy or Normal mode and then do the Hard on your second (or third) playthrough. The total playtime easily exceeds 30 hours with all the optional stuff, so spending 100 hours is perfectly possible in Millennium 5.
 Considering the difference between difficulty modes and customiyation options (visible/invisible monsters, encounters rate, in-game navigating arrows), you can tune the game to almost everyone's needs. Overall, it's a great game, even as a standalone one. But if you want to have the best experience, then playing the whole series is definitively recommended.
