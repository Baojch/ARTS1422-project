Die Grafik besteht quasi nur aus ein paar simplen Texturen und das Gameplay hat nichts innovatives zu bieten. Daher nicht zu empfehlen.

The fact that even most people who enjoyed enough to review the game positively have 12 minutes or less playtime shows this. They've tried once and never played again.

You move around in a hovercart, which is fairly awkward to control at times but you need to jump between platforms with it. The weapon is also quite awkward to aim.

Basically you then just go around the level looking for gems with rare obstacles. The levels seem mostly empty. Some of the platforming is fun, but most is pretty boring.

A positive is that you can unlock new abilities as you progress. After 5 gems there's a shield upgrade.

As you can see in the comments, the developer wasn't happy about the negative review with little play time. I then played some more to give it another chance and still felt the same. I notice he hasn't complained about the positive reviews with even less play time. 

He commented on another negative review and they changed to positive. As such it feels difficult to trust this having a high balance of positive to negative.

Firstly, the sheer amount of content you're getting is great for VR. Secondly, the controls and ship mechanics are *solid*. Third, the comfort options are awesome.

　　游戏的画面设计是进来很普遍的低面设计，低多边形的建模和鲜明的色彩搭配，让游戏整体画风看起来比较卡通化，感觉是个颇具童心的童话世界。
　　然而游戏操作却没那么简单，玩家的左手需要操控飞船的上升、转向、前进，右手则是控制飞船前端的大炮射击。主要是飞行移动操作比较麻烦，并且在操作过程中，画面的移动让玩家很容易产生晕眩感，游戏时间越长感觉越明显。
　　目前《宝石猎人》在steam上的售价为31元。游戏玩法比较有趣，但因为操作而导致的晕眩感会比较强，并不适合所有玩家体验，建议感兴趣且不容易晕的玩家购买体验。
