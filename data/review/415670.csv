First, the game has a story. When we go higher in the building floor by floor level we meet many characters, they have their own stories and bio, which was very nice. Also they help us solving levels and in which levels they appear are related by the story. They are quite well written, even though the story is predictable.

Secondly, the amount of levels and their veriety is really huge. There are no exactly same levels, plus some of them have additional challenges. It takes an amount of time to solve them all.

When it comes to a visual aspect, Highrise Heroes is nothing special, still the visuals are nice enough to be able to look at them for hours.

Welcome to Highrise Heroes, a game about trying to guide a bunch of little character avatars down to the bottom of the screen by linking together words to make the letter tiles in their way disappear. Except your characters need to be regularly linked to oxygen tiles or they suffocate. Also there are metal blocks in the way. Also there are bombs. And a turn limit. And everything is on fire.

This game is not a relaxing, casual word game. The first few levels set you up for success and fun, but by Level 4 or so you'll be consistently needing to reset your game after just barely not managing to do whatever it is the game is asking of you.

You may chuckle to yourself that you, a veritable Boggle champion, will have no issues finishing the game. You're great at finding long, elegant words on the board! To which I'd have to point out that you're never allowed to just make whatever words you see in this game. I lost plenty of games where I laid down whoppers like QUEERER or TREATISE. There's always a turn limitation, and even if you see a long, juicy word, you're discouraged from just going for it unless it's helping you manage all the many, many fiddly things each level asks you to keep track of. Every move needs to be considered, and if you're like me, that takes some of the fun out of the actual word-spotting.

One of my least favourite gimmicks were the ""bomb"" letters that randomly generate across the board. They need to be disposed of within a certain number of turns, or else game over. The game can and will throw more bombs at you than you can dispose of in time unless you use multiple bomb letters in a single word, and yes, this does use up your limited number of turns while the characters also languish from lack of oxygen and whatever else is going on in that level.

As an example of how annoying this becomes, there are levels where you need to use specific golden tiles in your word, of which there are only 1-4. Bombs will show up there, too, in places completely inaccessible to your gold tiles, upon which your only choice is to then sigh and hit that retry button. And that's just two of the mechanics that get introduced.

Even the word-finding itself is hampered by an incredibly weird dictionary that will recognize words so rare they're essentially random combinations of vowels, but not commonplace ones like DOX or PHO. Often I chained random things together to see if they'd work, which sort of defeats the purpose of a word game in the first place.

Each level has clearly been thoughtfully designed with specific challenges in mind, so it's a shame that the game will sometimes simply present you with an unwinnable version of them. It's entirely up to the RNG gods which letters they feel like giving you, and overall I found the sheer number of things you have to try to micromanage each level more frustrating than fun. There was nothing worse than narrowly shooing the last of my vulnerable little character tiles through the bottom of the screen to safety, with just one turn left, having finally managed to break down the rock blocks in my way and controlled the fire and distributed oxygen properly and navigated the conveyor belts—only for the game to tell me I failed anyways because I was under the required number of points to proceed. Agony.

Theoretically, your characters provide superpowers you can use to help complete the levels more easily, but while you are forced to rely on them at times, they drain your number of remaining turns, so you're discouraged from actually using them. There were some powers I never even touched. You're also limited by whichever characters you have on that specific level, since they each have a different ability and will frequently separate from each other as the plot demands. It would have been way better to have a separate mechanic for powers. Perhaps a meter that gets charged up if you make words of a certain length, or even just a set number you can use each level.

One final word about the game's story, since it's received praise in other reviews: it's somewhat more detailed than the usual for a puzzle-y mobile adaptation like this, but it's really nothing to write home about. It was a pleasant way to give each of the little character tiles meaning during the gameplay, but the dialogue and writing are juvenile, and the one twist is broadcast so blatantly it would be almost impossible to miss it. So if you were considering buying it for the story but you aren't sure about the gameplay, give it a pass.

TL;DR: While there are some fun ideas packed in here, the game is unnecessarily hard, with no accessibility options and a mediocre story. I [i]almost[/i] had fun with it, so if you're looking for a challenge rather than relaxation and don't mind having to restart the same level repeatedly, this might still be for you.

Personally, it made me crave a normal game of Boggle.",1689223808,1711932534,False,2,1,0.529756903648376465,0,False,False,False,True,,,

You can also just chill out and see how quickly you can plough through the levels.  Most of the levels aren't timed (which I really like) so you can really search for the biggest scoring words.   Some levels ARE timed and they're quick and fun.  
This game uses mouse controls.  I play on a laptop with a touch pad and occasionally this can be annoying because you score by linking letter tiles together and then double tapping the last letter to submit the word for scoring.  The touch pad sometimes just double taps itself so I end up submitting smaller words before I'm ready.  That's my only beef.  I haven't looked into it, but I'm guessing there might be a touch screen version of this game in which case joining letters would be even faster.",1672774227,1672774227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[list]

[*] There are 111 levels in the game's ""Story Mode"" and another ""12 monkey"" levels in the ""Chimp Challenges"". Although the developers presented some variety, the game still got repetitive and felt like outstayed its welcome after a while...

[*] Some levels are made quite tense and rage-inducing because of a combination of arbitrary restrictions (time, use of gold tiles / specific letters, unbreakable blocks, number of turns, oxygen levels, exploding toxic batteries, etc.) and dumb RNG. 

[*] Randomness not only increases the number of possibilities (and hence the ""replayability"") for each level, but also sometimes gives you a huge advantage and sometimes puts you in very tight (and even impossible) spots -- this inconsistency renders making comparisons between scores unreasonable and unfair. 

[*] Some achievements and ""banana challenges"" are just ""bananas"" (especially under pressure due to the imposed restrictions)!!! 

[*] Adding insult to injury, some English words are not considered valid by the game.

[*] Although sometimes funny and surprising, the story doesn't do much to calm my nerves. Instead, it adds to the tension by introducing more annoying plot elements. Let's just say I am never ever putting my life (and other people's lives) at risk again to save some ""lucky china cat"" or ""small teddy bear"" in a survival scenario especially when that dumbass keeps losing it. Yeah, I am looking at you both Tami and Betsy!!! SMH 

[*] The soundtrack is very good and relaxing. The ticking clock sound effect and slow animations during gameplay are really annoying though (especially when it ties your hands during the timed levels).

[/list]

The devs weren't kidding when they named the game and I would only recommend this game if you want to ""challenge"" yourself. If you are looking for a relaxing experience then look elsewhere.

[h3] SPOILERS!!!! [/h3]
[spoiler]Apparently I am lacking ""Life Skills"" since I was stuck at Floor 16 for a while.

The biggest surprise (and panic) for me was when the game didn't end at ground level (Floor 00), but instead kept going underground levels. You need to survive another 20 floors. Also repeat the last floor (-20) and make a different choice to get both endings and achievements.

In order to get the Codebreaker achievement, find the answer to Seb's question in Floor 25's dialog and use that as the number sequence on Floor -02.

It is not really possible to 3-star the later levels unless you are consistently forming words that are over seven letters, and in some levels you need to make 8-10 letter words in order to beat them within the turn limit.

More in-depth review below:

You are Seb, an intern for Anderson-Okami Industries.  On your first day of work, a sudden earthquake causes you to fall and hit your head, which causes you to lose your memory and makes the entire building you are in incredibly unstable.  Because of this, you must clear your way through the rubble all the way down to the ground floor so that you can escape.  Along the way, you meet many friends and foes alike, and work to uncover the mystery surrounding what exactly Anderson-Okami Industries is up to.

Story: 10/10 - This story grips you from the very beginning of the game and keeps you guessing until the very end of the game.  It is as intricate as it is deep and really keeps you playing as you want to reach the story's conclusion!  This is honestly one of the best stories in a video game of this type that I have come across in a long time.
Gameplay: 9/10 - The gameplay in this game is absolutely fantastic.  They add new mechanics over time that keep the game interesting throughout the entire time that you play the game.  The only reason that this isn't a 10/10 is because this game also has a good amount of RNG, especially when going for some of the levels' three stars you can earn, or the banana you can earn in the majority of the levels.
Audio/Music: 10/10 - This game has one of the best soundtracks that I have heard in an indie game in a long time, and none of the sound effects are grating or hurt to hear over the time you play the game.  It also adds to the story's ambiance and helps to enhance the story quite a bit.
Accessibility: 1/10 - Unfortunately, this game relies on color for one of the important tiles of the game, and there is no color-blind option for this game.  Furthermore, there is no way for you to change the controls of the game, or rebind the keys or mouse to anything else.  This is quite a let-down, because if they just took the time to add a few of these functions into the game, it could be the perfect fit for almost anyone!
Replayability: 5/10 - Unfortunately, this game also will lack the replayability that most other games will have.  Once you've finished the story, it loses a lot of it's appeal, and as such, never warrants you from ever replaying the game from the very beginning.  The game does have leaderboards for every single level that you could also replay most of the levels for to try to get to the top of the leaderboards, however, most of the leaderboards have hacked scores at the top of them, making this impossible.
Overall: 8/10 

This game, overall, is a hidden gem in the library of Steam games, and if you like word games such as Boggle, love stories full of mystery, suspence, and intrigue, and don't mind having to deal with the RNG from time to time,  you [b]NEED[/b] to buy this game!

After retrying a level for a good 45 minutes to try to get a good word off the bat to even have a chance at getting 3 stars, I realized I could be doing much more fun things like bathing my dog or cleaning the toilet; and deinstalled.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Highrise Heroes is a word game akin to Boggle. Levels consist of letter tiles presented in a square formation in rows and columns. Clicking on adjacent tiles creates words which you can then submit. Submitting a word removes those letters from the board, dropping the remaining letters from the top of the board downwards, filling the empty space. There are 90+ levels with each one offering a one to three star ranking, based on your score. Score is tied to word length, letters used, speed, and other conditions. There are also optional level-specific and other awards tied to some Achievements, such as making a 7+ letter word using a particular letter, or spelling every number from 1-9. 

It should be noted that a Boggle-like with 90+ levels would get boring around level 10. Thankfully, Highrise Heroes constantly changes the win conditions so that subsequent levels seldom repeat the same formula. For instance, some levels require you to spell a set number of words of a certain length. Others demand words be spelled using a tile with a certain property, such as a specific colour. Not all tiles contain letters, with some representing story characters that you need to ""free"" by having them dropped off the bottom of the board. One of the most challenging mechanics involves linking non-letter tiles containing a banana in order to score points within a set time limit.

Between most levels, dialogue is presented between an ever-increasing cast of characters. These characters drive the plot, a surprisingly well-conceived story involving descending floors of a tall office building in peril. More interesting, is that characters provide optional abilities at the cost of a finite number of moves or time, depending on the level's win condition. Abilities range from adding point boosters to tiles on the board, revealing the longest word possible, or even swapping adjacent or non-adjacent letters. As the early levels are quite easy, you may be lulled into thinking the entire game will be a cakewalk. Rest assured, later levels ramp up significantly, making the weighing of abilities with their costs an all too real consideration. 

The above explains the core mechanics, though there is quite a bit more I haven't mentioned. Fire tiles, water tiles, moving rows, exploding tiles, air loss, dirt blocks, glass tiles, the list goes on. Rather than explain everything, I've decided to opt for the short version so that you have a general sense of what to expect and can still experience the bulk of the content for yourself. Also worth mentioning is that the entire game is played using your mouse's left-click button. You can replay any level you've reached at any time, and achieving 3-stars is entirely optional. Character biographies gradually unlock, as do a full list of in-game awards directly tied to Steam Achievements. 

[h1]Critique[/h1]
Of my ever-growing list of PC games I've played from start to finish (over 700+ and counting), a scant few are word games. Bookworm Adventures and Letter Quest immediately come to mind, but few others are based entirely around spelling. Text adventures from the 80s, such as King's Quest and Space Quest required text inputs to play. However, spelling in those games was a control limitation, rather than a focus of play mechanics. It should come as no surprise that someone who writes game reviews enjoys improving their writing. For that reason, I am admittedly biased when it comes to word games. 

To my knowledge, Highrise Heroes has the most content of any spelling game I have ever played. I had intended to review the game yesterday, thinking I had about 20 minutes left to play. As it turns out, I had close to 4 hours. Had there not been a story, the game would still be worth playing. What's unique in my mind is that a budget title, priced a little over $5 Canadian, not only has a story but one where the characters and plot directly connect to the mechanics in each level, along with the options at the player's disposal. In the 17 hours it took me to beat the story and unlock all the Steam Achievements, I had but only four complaints.

The first complaint is that the right-mouse button isn't assigned to anything. For ease of use, I would have liked to be able to deselect all currently highlighted tiles at once, rather than click on each highlighted tile (or the original tile) to do the same. My second complaint is that the plot is very well written. This made the few minor, easily ignored spelling mistakes during Chapter 5 all the more unfortunate. My third complaint is that the most difficult levels provide only a handful of character powers, usually not useful for that particular scenario. Despite all that, I still consider the game a half a hair-width away from being perfect as far as execution is concerned. 

My last complaint has nothing to do with the story or how the game plays. I personally think the title should have been reversed. I typically think a title with a subtitle after the colon relates to a planned series of games with different subtitles for subsequent games. ""Highrise Heroes,"" being the base title, would suggest that a sequel wouldn't be a ""Word Challenge"" but something else. To me, that is backwards. In any event, I sincerely hope there is a sequel, that is also a word game, with the same or similar characters.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Highrise Heroes: Word Challenge is easy to play, hard to master, and impossible to not recommend. The same concept could be easily duplicated to any number of stories, be they targeted towards families (such as this game), young adults, adults, or our eventual alien overlords. Though I'm unaware if a sequel is planned, I would love to see more. This goes beyond being an exceptional word game. It is an exceptional game, period.

I am pleasantly surprised by the game, after playing it for 4 hours. 

Casual, yes. But not as easy as some other, more basic word games I have played over the last 30+ years. 
The graphics are fairly basic, nothing groundbreaking, but they are pretty enough, colorful without being obnoxiously bright and glaring. Easy to look at and distinguish the characters and elements of the game. A tad ""bland"" on the look of them on some puzzles, but I am okay with that. I prefer them to be less bright and glaring ""eye candy"" style. The ""bland"" is easy to look at for a long time while replaying the same puzzle to try for 3 stars on all puzzles.

The letter/number/object tiles that you must match are generously sized, very easy to see for older eyes (wearing bifocals). The resolution choices seem minimal, but the native res setting works great on my 2560x1440 GSync 27"" monitor, no cut off elements or words.  
Runs smoothly, no issues with fps, screen-tearing or anything else. Just purrs along nicely.

The story is a bit cheesy, but there is humor there, that younger folks may appreciate, but even a Gen X-er like me found amusing, so far. 

Took a minute figure out that moving the screen s around to replay previous levels, or look at character bios achievements (trophies), and the banana challenges did not use the mouse scroll wheel, but rather a drag-and-move. Not what I am used to in a PC game, but... I believe it is a console or mobile port? (not sure.). And it works well, no issues with it once I figured it out.

The puzzle objectives change, at the start they are relatively easy, with a good pacing in the increase in difficulty. I like the challenge, especially the ""banana challenges"". Keeping my brain working and thinking, quickly and fluidly, is important to me as I age, especially with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease. Puzzle games are a good way for me to keep my mind fit.

I am enjoying it. Nice to play in short sessions, when I need a break from some of the more ""difficult"" or ""hardcore"" games I play. Looking forward to completing Story Mode and the Chimp Challenges in the near future, and looking forward to the challenge of getting this game to 100% achievements unlocked.

C'est un excellent jeu qui n'a qu'un seul ""défaut"" : être disponible uniquement en anglais. Afin de jouer avec les mots, il vous faudra donc également manier la langue de Shakespeare.
Je me suis vraiment régalée à assembler les lettres de ces grilles, même si je manquais de vocabulaire pour former des mots probablement plus complexes et variés.
L'avancement dans le jeu fait également progresser une histoire qui possède un certain suspense. J'avoue que dans ce style de jeu, je n'attendais pas particulièrement à trouver une intrigue à suivre, mais là, non seulement c'est bien amené, avec un soupçon de mystère, mais en plus ça donne même envie d'aller jusqu'au bout pour connaître le dénouement.
Les niveaux sont nombreux, des objectifs sont à atteindre, la difficulté varie et différents types de blocs viennent plus ou moins corser les choses.

There are many different levels, which actually provide quite a bit of content. The levels are very similar to the type that you would see in a Candy Crush level (drop something to the bottom, break certain blocks, etc). There is also a story progression after every level, although I'll be honest I skipped almost all of it. For the actual gameplay, it is smooth and has a decent soundtrack with it.

Overall, not a horrible game if you know what you are getting into. It is a good game to burn some hours on and it is better than most of the random games like this.

Highrise is a large scale boggle game. As a word game ofcourse longer words are a much easier way to clear the board, if not for the associated exploding blocks.
but even for non fluent speakers, with a 5 letter ratio, it's surprisingly doable.
That because this game also takes some elements straight from modern matching games. There are clear objectives, there are special blocks of interest. 
It's not just about getting an high score, most levels require moving down the character blocks out of the field, keeping track of their oxygen levels, And just being aware of the surrounding blocks.
if there are explosion blocks, fire, glass, etc, one usually tends to leave the end of the word where it could combo into exploding or removing anything that can prove to be a nuisance sooner or later.

It's not an entirely positive experience, for instance this is a really long game, while for some that might come across a cheap game with a lot of value.
To me, that lead to a very repetitive game, and much of what it inserts to avoid some of that monotony, and they sure tried, with Story, challenges, and time trials. 
Much of it just doesn't work as well as it should. with levels being more frustrating than challenging. The cowards way out of timed challenges, is just as simple as disabling the timer.
But with the clock often being the only threat, removing it, just creates a level that is far too easy to be enjoyable.

In the absence of Popcap's Bookworm Adventures (2) from Steam this is the closest you will get to word-puzzling in a motivating plot.
 
I have put some good 20 hours into the mobile version of this - at least it felt like that - maxing all levels to 3 stars. So I knew what I would get buying the Steam release. 
Or maybe I did not. Because the port is a bit lackluster. No volume control and lack of other settings; since you do not use your fingers but drag a mouse there should be some additional visual feedback on mouse movement; there are no additional visuals to fill the panorama screen format. It is pretty much a 1 on 1 port with (admittedly) better resolution.
Does this make it a bad game? 

No. I still like the challenge the game poses. You definitely have to have some affinity for the type of game. Casuals might get burned - especially with mouse control - but that makes it a full-fledged game.
I like the mechanics of linking words, I like the art style, I like the different goals per level. While I prefer taking my time to produce the longest word possible, timed levels and mini targets introduce variety. There is more to explore if you want to collect all bananas (e.g. create a palindrome in specific level), which offers some replayability. 
The biggest plus, however, is the story. When I was playing it on my phone I thought the developers actually had not completed the game. As the main goal of the game is to get to the ground floor of the building you know more or less how far you have progressed (on floor 40 you have ~40 more levels to go). It dragged on for so long that I was certain that the devs could not possibly bring it to a good conclusion. 
Boy, was I wrong.  
Yes, the details along the way might get boring. Losing someone in the rubble only to cross their path again five levels later is not all that exciting. But it builds up to one of the best game endings I have seen. I felt emotionally invested. In a darn mobile game that I played on the train. A puzzle game! So I will give the devs cudos for that!

Yet, I would not recommend it for the story alone. To conclude:

The main gameplay is something along the lines of Bookworm meets the ""mining"" game mode of Bejeweled 3. Most of the challenges are number of turn based, though there are also some math and timed limited challenges as well.

The acceptable word list is quite large, but could probably be expanded a bit. However, this is a minor quibble and doesn't impact the enjoyment of the game.

The difficulty curve seems to be 'just right' for the most part for people that have experience with letter tile and match 3 type games, and the various achievements are handed out in a fine pace to keep you interested.

The only issue I see as a negative with the game is the Global Leader Board as the game is VERY random by its nature and therefore scores are heavily weighted toward LUCK of the draw. And while there is a specific skillset involved with this type of game, it is in no way an actual meaningful comparison between players. But I guess we have come to expect every game on Steam to have a leaderboard, so it is at least there for those that want that.

Each level requires you to make words to clear the board to allow the survivors to 'escape' off the bottom of the screen. Each level has slightly different layouts, or a slightly different goals (e.g. make 20 words using the letter A). There is a surprising amount of levels (I'm about 95 in and the end is soon, I think). There's challenges on each level too, for completionists.

The story is amusing, if nothing to write home about. The game itself is solid, and I do like that the focus is on intelligently finding words rather than short timers and forcing you to make 3 and 4 letter words over and over.

Both of these things are accomplished through a boggle/bookworm type word-game that becomes progressively challenging. 

One of the usual complaints I have with these type of word games is the ""obscure Scrabble syndrome"" where some otherwise nonsensical word hidden away in the deepest darkest less frequented pages of a dictionary always score you some points. This game still has some of those, but less frequent that it becomes unnoticeable. Forming words is a nice challenge with some occasional obstacles or stage rules, f.ex. having to include character tiles as you form words so their health/oxygen bars don't run out; freeing character tiles from 'debris' tiles; using timed letters in words to clear a level. All these little challenges add to a word game that otherwise could have been like every other word game out there.

In story mode, there is a definite story happening - it has cheesy dialogue; comedic at times; and is really just a nice touch of fluff to a word game. There is a challenge mode as well, which if you happen to be playing story mode and manage to unlock/complete a challenge, you do get credit for it. Something I thought was nice to have. 

There is a friendslist leaderboard and a global leaderboard that pops up after each level so you can see how well you are doing compared to others, or as a reminder you have no friends with similar interests. Your choice! 

However way you play it, escaping from [strike] the Burj Khalifa[/strike] the generic looking no relation to the tallest building skyscraper is a nice side-story to a word game that offers some casual play on a commute, during a server maintenance or to fulfill some achievement hunting.

The first thing you see upon entering the game is Story Mode and Chimp Challenges.  Once you choose one, you'll be able to access Settings.  Options are separate mute buttons for music and sounds, plus Windowed mode or full-screen.

Gameplay consists of chaining together letters to form words, usually with the goal of dropping everyone to the bottom of the screen to ""save"" them.  When you include the characters from the story in a chain, it will give you access to letters you otherwise wouldn't be able to get to, but there's more to it than that.  Characters will soon run out of air if you don't use them in a word with an air (blue) tile, there are battery cells that have to be used within a certain number of turns, or they'll explode and everyone will die from toxic gas.  There can be fires to put out, debris to clear, and/or glass to break before you can move on, and you only have a certain number of turns to save everyone!

Each character has an ability that will help you out of a tight spot, ranging from instantly breaking a tile that would otherwise take 3 turns to destroy, to swapping letters on the screen, to showing you the longest-possible word on the screen.  SUPER-helpful... but use these abilities wisely, as each time you use them, you'll lose a certain number of turns!

Making 5+ letter words will give you a small red bomb, which takes out all of the tiles touching it (8 tiles), and making a 7+ letter word gives you a large gold bomb, which will take out an additional row of tiles surrounding it (24 tiles).

The early levels will give you hints if you stall for too long, but no worries... That doesn't continue once you progress in the game, and neither does the super-easy-to-pass nature of the levels. Every word you make gets you points, and of course longer words give you more points.  Chaining together multiple characters in a word will net you some bonus points, and there are also some tiles that include multipliers.  If you're an achievement-hunter like me, simply passing a level isn't good enough, as you're going to want to get the most points possible in order to get three stars, and if you're competitive, there are leaderboards for each level, too!

All levels have a hidden timer for the purpose of stats, but there are a good 10 levels (that's a guess) that have a visible timer, and which you have to complete within 2 minutes or less... and a few of those levels have number tiles instead of letters, with challenges such as ""Link tlles to add up to 40."" GAH!

Every level has a goal that must be met before you can move on, and 64 of the levels include an additional challenge in the form of ""banana"" challenges.  An example of a banana challenge would be, ""Make a 6+ letter vowel-heavy word.""

There are:
- 36 achievements - If you're having trouble with the Codebreaker achievement, you'll find the secret on [spoiler]level 25[/spoiler] 
- 111 story-driven levels
- 64 ""banana"" challenges
- 12 chimp challenges

The story was surprisingly interesting for the most part, and although I had figured out an important point pretty early on in the game, there were some surprises thrown in, and I found myself rushing through the latter levels just to see how it would end... And there came another surprise!  There are [i]two[/i] possible endings! :O  NICE!

Overall I found Highrise Heroes to be a delightful word game, with an engaging story and nice bonuses.  I love the achievements and extra challenges to complete, and the difficulty level -- once you get past the early stages -- was enough to make me re-play over and over again to get my three stars, but (with the exception of the number levels) not enough to make me want to pull out my hair.

Sure.

My first impression wasn't too great because the game doesn't have a great soundtrack and it's overall a lazy mobile port, which many UX problems I could have done without. Halfway through Highrise I just stopped caring, and it's only my judeo-christian education that prevented me from jumping out of a virtual window instead of going through each of these floors one by one and hearing stories about how that boring girl lost her stupid china cat and wants it back at the cost of another annoying level.

Its mobile roots are very obvious, especially when trying to scroll up or down since the mouse wheel doesn’t work. You’ll need to click and drag instead. I don’t mind making that motion from left to right, but up and down does not feel great. Fortunately, the actual game doesn’t require any of that, just the main menu.
 
Once you start playing, you’ll notice how words are formed by drawing an unseen line through letters adjacent to each other or by clicking on them individually. The letters will have arrows indicating the direction you took through them. I didn’t have trouble for the most part, but I did find accidental word submissions annoying when I was trying to adjust a word by clicking a letter in the middle of the path. Canceling words requires clicking on the X off to the side when a word is started or by clicking elsewhere on the board. It’s all very functional when going at your own pace, but timed levels can increase the chance to make an error with word creation.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of this game is the leaderboard. Having that in the game really encourages replays and score chasing as you try to outdo your friends. There are some scores posted on there that are impossible, so I recommend having friends with the game or setting a goal such as Top 100 for yourself.

The game isn’t just about making words. Where the words are made are important and there are many obstacles and hazards introduced as you make progress down the building’s 90 floors. At first, you just have letters and survivors that need rescue. Blocks with various hit points then make their way onto the board. You’ll also run into water tiles, fire tiles, oxygen levels, and more. To help out, survivors have abilities that can manipulate the board, but they come at the cost of turns or time. The game starts out pleasant enough, but eventually, you’ll hit a wall depending on how good you are. Still, it’s fun to create words that end up creating explosions and wiping out strategic sections of the board to rescue everyone. The game also keeps the experience varied by changing the goals and boards of some levels such as linking numbers to add to a specific amount or using specific letters.

The difficulty really ramps up at the end of Chapter 3 and beyond. I remember spending 2 hours on building level 27 (you start at 90) due to the number of different mechanics I had to keep track of including lethal gas letters with turn times, fire letters that spread and take two turns to clear (one to put the fire out and the next to destroy the normal tile), keeping track of oxygen for the survivors, and reinforced blocks. Some levels can require an early restart if you have a bad draw if you want a decent score or want to win. You cannot control that aspect, so when you’re dealing with many different things, it just feels extremely frustrating at times. The difficulty spike also hurt the leaderboards where friends are concerned because I noticed a large drop off at the very end of Chapter 3. They just gave up. The following screenshot shows a board that has indestructible blocks, moving rows, destructible blocks, and protected letter tiles at the bottom.

The further I went, the more the game became more unpleasant. I started encountering more and more timed levels which are some of my least favorite. I found myself restarting much more often, sometimes to just have a strong beginning if the letters aren’t in my favor such as having a consonant block that can’t be cleared with using up many turns. Most of my playtime was spent on the second half of the game until I finally stopped some levels after reaching Chapter 5.

This game has a strong first impression with a frustrating second half depending on well you can handle everything thrown at you. It relies heavily on word making and strategy which can be fun and appealing to many. It’s an approachable word game for the beginning portion and you could probably have some fun leaderboard chases, but the later levels killed my enthusiasm for this title.",1467767814,1467825839,False,12,1,0.688049435615539551,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Whilst a story may seem like an unlikely addition to this type of game, it does actually have an element of mystery and discovery as you try to figure out what exactly went down in this bizarre skyscraper. In between each of the levels there is dialogue, which is a little bit tongue in cheek bad. I thought it was actually well written, but with characters that are designed to be obvious tropes and the writer was clearly looking for groans and facepalms along the way. Nothing too serious and it did actually make me laugh a few times.

As the game unfolds you get more and more characters, each of which has a special ability. The characters you get on each level are story-based, so you don't get to choose. Some levels include things like saving a teddy bear, or mopping up some water along the way. There are also a lot of monkeys, collectible flag-based bananas and a character named Captain Amazeballs, because why not. 

In addition to the regular word challenges, there are occasional number levels where you need to match combinations of numbers, both positive and negative which I found surprisingly fun. Not fun enough to want a whole game based around it, but enough to keep it fresh every now and again.

Some of the levels are incredibly simple, but others, especially the timed challenges, are incredibly hard! There's a little bit of a disconnect in difficulties, but generally speaking as you progress to the end of the game, it gets harder, and harder and harder... I would say that this is probably one of the more challenging word-based games to complete that I've played and at times, a little frustrating, but I got there in the end.

Overall the amount of strategy, different level types, different challenges and increasing difficulty makes this one of the most feature-complete word games I've played - with a lot of replayability in the star and score system, including global and friend based leaderboards.

First off, the basic gameplay is akin to a Match-3 game where you need to destroy normal tiles to allow important tiles to reach the bottom, but instead of matching colours you're creating words. This simple premise alone wouldn't have sustained the player through 90 levels so thankfully we have lots of other minor mechanics and distractions to stir things up. There's admirable attention to detail everywhere, in the menus and storytelling as well as the game levels. The game even accepts US and UK spellings.

An update rolled out today (Feb 4 2016) is the option to turn off the timer without being penalised. This is most welcome as my only grumble prior to this update was the unnecessary (IMO) pressure of a time limit on some levels. Now you just uncheck the timer box on the level info screen and take your sweet time. It won't even affect your achievements.

What makes it great? The full package. It's a good boggle type game that also happens to have a very fun story (written by an actual young adult fiction writer) and a nice overall presentation.

And, it's obvious that the developer set out to make a good game, not just another lame clone with minor variations. In all honesty, I was expecting the latter when I bought it (I'm a sucker for boggle clones), but I was really surprised!

I won't spoil the story at all, but it's just a lot of fun. The gameplay is arranged into a (long) series of individual levels, with short (mostly dialogue) cutscenes in between. At first I assumed that the cutscenes were lazy fluff, but I found myself actually looking forward to each one! Especially on the later levels that proved quite challenging and make me work harder for the next scene.

The gameplay itself isn't standard boggle, it's the Bookworm Deluxe type variant where tiles disappear and the grid falls downward when you make a word. Like Bookworm Deluxe, it also has some special tiles. But, it gets more complicated...

Instead of just trying to form big words quickly (most levels are actually not timed), you typically need to ""rescue"" characters that appear as tiles in the grid, by getting them to the bottom. Each character, while still on the grid, also has special abilities that can be played at the cost of moves or time. Each level either gives you a set amount of moves or set amount of time to complete.

The characters (most of them, anyway), have an oxygen gauge. If you let their oxygen run low, you lose, so you have to either rescue them very quickly, or replenish their oxygen by connecting them as part of words to blue letter tiles.

There's a variety of special tiles like glass, fire, and debris, that require different strategies to deal with properly. 

So, unlike most boggle clones that are about speed, this one tends to be much more about strategy - not just trying to find the longest word, but making the right word in the right place at the right time, and knowing when to use the special abilities.

There are also arithmetic levels with numeric tiles instead, where the goal is to form a specific sum (tiles include positive and negative numbers from -9 to 9 (but not 0).

There are a lot of levels with a slowly increasing difficulty curve. The later levels can present decent challenges even to seasoned word gamers. Besides the basic goal of the level (usually rescuing the characters), there are also stars awarded for performance (usually score, but not always), a leaderboard for every level (steam integrated), and special ""banana"" goals for most levels (these are for forming particular kinds of words, e.g. 7+ letters). So, plenty to do, plenty to shoot for.

For achievement hunters, if you're good at boggle games, this might take you 20-30 hours to 100% (as long as you're also not terrible at arithmetic).

The base price is quite fair, and the introductory sale price is quite generous. Definitely one of the better purchases I've made.",1452596594,1452596594,True,80,1,0.872052490711212158,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Steam is lacking great word games and this one fills the void quite nicely. It also had a few levels that were math levels too, which were a nice surprise and changed up the gameply in a nice way.

As you can see, you're just making words like in Boggle where you use connected letters. However, this game has obvious obstacles and other things to stop you the later you get in the game to make it a little more of a challenge. And as usual, the letters fall down when used, and if you make a 5 letter word or longer you get blocks that explode removing more blocks and getting more points. There's also character blocks that let you expand the words to use letters further away that you couldn't normally reach, the characters give you abilties you can use to help you beat levels and of course you have to save the charcters each level while making sure they they keep their oxygen levels high enough, which is just linking blocks of oxygen into them before finishing your word
