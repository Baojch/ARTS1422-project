On the one hand, the game delivers exactly on what it promises.  The store description says 7 levels of increasing difficulty.  You see the video on the game store page and the game screen shots.  So you know exactly what you're getting.  [b][u] Note: I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers, I had to do a windows 7 compatability fix, but then it worked fine after I started from Steam VR (didn't work if you start app directly from Steam) [/u] [/b]

So it comes down to value really.  Is this game worth $4.99?  Nope.  Is it worth $2.49?  That's where I'm struggling.  I don't want to give a negative review because the game worked exactly like it said it would.  It's a stand still, racket game where you basically have to knock down moving targets before you run out of time.  Priority is placed on the zombies that are destroying the fence.  

I found that  you can control where the ball goes.  You really have to be good at both your forehand and backhand swings though.  I found it helps if you're staring at your target and time your swing correctly to achieve the right angle on the swing.  

I think in the end, sadly, this game is a $.99 cents game really.  I almost finished this game in 30 minutes.  It was 1 environment, with only two enemy types (zombie, zombie with helmet), with only one powerup target (a bomb).  The 7 levels really don't change anything up, other than there's more zombies.

　　游戏整体难度较低。在接球的设计上，只需要玩家在对应方向做出挥拍动作，就等于接到了球，不要求与现实相同的精准度。击打出去的过程中，算是游戏的难点，需要玩家把控方向，朝僵尸所在的位置打去，但同样存在范围伤害设计，不要求十分精准。
　　游戏在Steam商店中售价为28元人民币，目前只有7个关卡，整体流程较短，且游戏耐玩度不高，所以整体性价比较低，建议喜欢此题材的玩家们，可以等其进行折扣活动时再进行购买。
