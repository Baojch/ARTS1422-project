I bought this in the Steam Autumn Sale of 2017 for $2.89 USD. I think this is a good deal. It's a nice puzze / escape room game. It took me about 1.2 hours to complete the puzzle, but it can probably be beaten in 20 minutes if you just rush through the game. Locomotion is by teleportation.

However, I made sure to try to find every object that is interactable. You get little voice snippets from Jess. I liked them for the most part. Some negative reviewers call them cheesy, I think it gives you insight into the person. It made you feel like you knew Jess better and there's actually some motivation to finish the game.

This game is different than most escape rooms because you're not actually trying to escape at all. You're playing a game with your boyfriend Nick and he has a promised surprise for you at the end. It's a rainy day outside and the news is reporting about some missing girls. I believe there are 4 rooms. Your goal is to unlock them all and then open the safe. There is a hint system to help you, although I found only in the first puzzle were the hints really all that useful. But I would suggest using the hint system because it moves the narrative story along.

Most of the puzzles were not that difficult. There is one with switches that gave me some difficulty, mostly because I had no idea what they were referencing. And the last puzzle was impossible for me. I had to look up the code online. Well, as far as puzzle / escape rooms go, this one is nice. It's not great, but it's serviceable. Better than the average, but not much better than the average.

Most if not all of the items can be picked up and unlike most other VR titles, I have no difficulty picking them up. These items has their stories too, as narrated by Jess in the game when she (me) picks them up. The collision for the items and the environment works well too, and one thing I like is that I tried to peer (by stretching my head) through the wall to see if I could cheat, but my visual blurred as soon as my head goes into the wall, which is rather neat.
