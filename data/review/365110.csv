My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705260672,1705260672,True,1,0,0.453011780977249146,0,True,False,False,True,,,

After All is a mediocre RPGMaker game about the hero returning 20 years after he saved the country to find everything has gone wrong in his absence, unfortunately dragged down by low effort game design attempting, as far as I can see, to do the ""jokes and being snarky about JRPGs mean we don't have to be any good, right?"" thing.

If this worked, you would find, as with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game featured extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.  It's worth noting some disclaimer here: These are just observations from the developers store page and screenshots (that do clearly show that to be true).  In this case, the game doesn't actually run as explained above.

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  How is this possible given the game doesn't even run?  This player count only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

After All is stupidly overpriced at around $3 USD (for a broken game), but it's not worth it.  Because this doesn't work (and I have reported this broken game to Valve), and because of the unethical nature of the developer, I cannot in good conscience recommend this to fellow gamers.

其次游戏的玩法单调且缺乏创新。虽然游戏试图通过解谜和探索来吸引玩家，但这些元素并没有得到很好的实现。谜题设计简单且重复，缺乏挑战性；而探索过程则显得枯燥无味，场景设计单调，缺乏细节和互动性。

此外游戏的画面和音效表现也不尽如人意。画面风格虽然独特，但整体视觉效果粗糙，角色和场景的建模缺乏精细度。音效方面则显得单调乏味，背景音乐和音效效果无法为游戏氛围增色。

在技术层面，游戏也存在不少问题。例如游戏在运行过程中经常出现卡顿和掉帧现象，影响游戏体验的流畅性。同时游戏的优化也存在明显不足，导致在高配置电脑上运行效果依然不佳。

总的来说，在剧情、玩法、画面和音效等方面都存在明显的不足，使得这款游戏难以令人满意。对于期待找到一款优秀独立游戏的玩家来说，这款游戏无疑是一个令人失望的选择。我不建议购买这款游戏，除非你对其中的某些特定元素有着极高的容忍度或者特殊的喜好。",1582385001,1710880676,False,3,0,0.549532532691955566,0,True,False,False,False,,,

http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/additional/run-time-packages

Obviously the game feels like it was made in haste and the developer utilized the original stock tilesets and images from RPG Maker VX Ace. He seemed to glaze the avatars and battlepacks to give it a slightly tinted look. If you can get past these feelings, you’ll find that the game doesn’t really have that bad of a storyline. It’s original and it has several twists and is full of a lot of cheesy jokes and metagame concepts that really isn’t common. 

The only aspect of the game I criticize it for is the lack of attention paid to certain animations (most notably a dog running through village houses), and avatars missing for almost half of the villagers. A controversial move made by the developer was having the protagonist almost invincible but I liked this even more so because this game isn’t so much about leveling up but more about emphasizing the fact that you are the greatest fighter of all time. If you do manage to fight all your battles leading up to Ivan, you’re bound to unlock the thousand blows special move which is practically a safeproof move to killing even the greatest of bosses *cough* . Yes, the game is extremely easy, as I found the first boss fight against the Demon King to be the hardest, but the game’s plot and interesting setting makes up for it.

Pretty unbelievable.

The game is short (about an hour long), but I don't count that against it. I actually rather like short games. The content within is what I take issue with. I also don't mind the use of stock RPG Maker assets. The game is a mere dollar at full price, so that's fine.  

But it's clear everything was done in a slapdash manner. That Photoshop filter used to give the game a more unique look? Clearly done via some kind of batch processing without individually inspecting each asset to make sure they crop and animate cleanly. Every ability and monster in the game has received seemingly zero touch-ups to make any kind of unique encounters or combat. I mean, I get the point that the main character is super OP, but why have him still gain levels and acquire skills? Why leave all those abilities left in the game? All I needed was Cleave and basic attack. And why can I remove the limiter multiple times and get a temporary buff for doing so? It makes no narrative sense. The obvious explanation as that all these things unchanged once they were found to be basically functional.

Another problem with the shortness is that it still feels the need to pad out its time with a ridiculously high encounter rate throughout the whole game. It only seems to get higher with each new area!

Really, though. Regardless of all these issues, there just isn't enough of a story. I get that people really like bad puns/humor and pop culture references, but those should be like easter eggs and not the meat of the interactions. Unless it was meant as a way to discourage me from talking to random NPC's and interacting with things. If so, mission accomplished. Aside from that, the story has little to offer. A confusing moral (don't ever move away from your hometown?) is shoved in your face while the premise of ""what happens after you beat the big bad"" is told via summary. And then there's a slight twist at the end. But none of the execution actually bothers to explore the idea. I guess I expected something like Rocky II, which is about what happens to that smalltown hero when given massive success and fame (which happens in Rocky I). Not that I expected this game to be as good as an Oscar-winning movie franchise, just that I wanted there to be a STORY not a summary.

So my conclusion is that this game is kind of a scam. It doesn't run unless you fix it yourself and the effort is so low that I have to believe the dev doesn't care. He's got his money so he's good to go.",1450080631,1450080631,False,15,1,0.653091609477996826,1,True,False,False,False,,,

First up, the game didn't install correctly. The ""Play"" button only launched an installer for the game and created a sub-folder that I had to run the executable within in order to play the game, so if you're thinking of buying this do be aware of that. Due to the ""Play"" button only launching the installer, the five minutes registered for my playtime is actually just the time spent installing and waiting for the review window to open up. A better estimate of my playtime is somewhere on the order of an hour (probably somewhat less), in which time I played the game to completion.

Regardless, the game itself was quite nice for a $0.99 impulse buy. The story did exactly what it set out to do - provide the sort of denouement that RPGs so often lack, addressing the question of what, exactly, a band of heroes strong enough to save the world where armies couldn't would do once they were done.

Which isn't to say it doesn't have its problems, of course. Graphical glitches abound, with tiles often being outlined in black for no discernible reason, especially when animating. The random encounter system is also somewhat underdeveloped - perhaps half a dozen times I found myself finishing an encounter only to get another literally the next step I took, and a more typical fight every five to ten steps isn't much better. Most grievously, however, the game is locked to a very tiny resolution and immediately halts in every way but musically while unfocused. The former is slightly understandable with fixed-width graphical elements, but the latter is really quite irksome.

Also unfortunate is how the ""limiter"" mechanic (wherein the hero purposefully limits himself in order to ""challenge himself"" but also to drive home story elements) is implemented - you can choose to take it off right after you put it on and become the strongest thing in the game by far. Yet even if you do this, those aforementioned story elements still act as if you had the thing on, which is rather jarring. I'd advise leaving the thing on the whole game, especially since you don't really need it too much in the first place - the game's definitely on the easy side of the spectrum. And if the developer's reading this, I'd advise just taking out the ability to remove it outside of cutscenes.",1429593850,1429593850,True,25,1,0.55478370189666748,24,True,False,False,False,,,
