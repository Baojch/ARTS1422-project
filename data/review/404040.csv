Wobei man +durchgespielt+ wohl nie wirklich sagen kann bei dieser Art von Spiel^^
LOM ist ein Strategiespiel das einen rundenbasiert seine Truppen über die Karte ziehen lässt, Gebäude verbessert, Truppen rekrutiert und dann in Echtzeitkämpfen (mit Pause Funktion) gegen Monster /Einheiten anderer Fraktionen kämpfen lässt.
Die Heldeneinheiten können Artefakte und Heil/Manatränke benutzen, jedoch sind nur 2 Stk. ausrüstbar. Und natürlich können Heldeneinheiten (3 pro Armee) und kleinere Einheiten (bestehend aus 1-3, je nach Art) auch im Level aufsteigen, außer es handelt sich um legendäre Kreaturen oder Spezialmonster z.B. aus dem großen Tempel wie den Zyklopen bei der Erdefraktion, jene haben bereits ihr maximal Level, sind dafür aber stärker als normale Truppen. Und die legendären Kreaturen sind die stärksten im Spiel, wobei es da auch sehr große Unterschiede in der Stärke gibt. Mein legendärer Erdwurm ist z.B. sehr gut, aber die legendären Drachen der Luft+ Feuerfraktion sind soweit ich mich erinnere noch stärker und können sogar Stufe 8-10 Dungeon quasi allein bezwingen.

Zu meinem Durchgang:
Ich hatte mit meiner Lieblingsfraktion: Erde begonnen.
Hab mir wie damals immer üblich noch 2-3 andere Fraktionen +einverleibt+ in dem ich ihre großen Tempel eroberte. Bei Neutralen oder befreundeten Fraktionen kriegt man mehr Truppen. Die Lebensfraktion musste ich erst bestechen, damit sie mich nicht mehr hasste. Dann ging das auch;)

Hatte dann außer meiner Hauptarmee die aus meinem Zwergen-Erdkriegerlord, paar Zwergenaxtwerfern und Zwergnahkämpfern bestand dann mit den besten Bogenschützen und einem Magier aus der Lebensfraktion verstärkt und später mit meinem legendären Erderiesenwurm und 1 Felsschleuderer ergänzt.
Meine Erdhauptstadt verteidigten dann div. Erdetruppen+1 Dieb +1 Krieger und 1 Magier (reine Erdtruppen).

In meiner Ordnungshauptstadt hatte ich durch die Eroberung des großen Tempels noch den Ordnungsmagierlord und 1 hochstufigen Paladin und später einen Dieb. Plus einige Nahkampf+Fernkampfeinheiten. Diese Armee zog dann in der näheren Umgebung umher und lvlte so langsam auf und verteidige die Ordnungsstadt gegen marodierende Truppen (die keiner Fraktion angehörten).

In meiner Lebens- und Wasserhauptstadt (bekam die Wasserfraktion umsonst, weil die Lebensfraktion jene vorher schon übernommen hatte) baute ich ebenso jeweils 1 Schutzarmee auf.

Das ganze fraß dann sehr viel Zeit und Mühe.
Ich war gerade dabei mit meiner Hauptarmee div. Stufe 8-9 Dungeons zu erobern, als plötzlich die Todesfraktion meine Ordnungsarmee und meine inzwischen gegründete 2. Ordnungsarmee überfiel +leider auch vernichtete :(

Allerdings war der Todeslord ziemlich dämlich^^ denn er verlor dadurch ca. 85% seiner besten Einheiten und er floh dann allein vor meiner Hauptarmee.

Zu dem Zeitpunkt gab es außer meiner Fraktion nur noch die Luft, Feuer und Todesfraktionen.
Ich hab dann meine Erdarmee per Teleportationsgebäude (gibts nur bei der Erdefraktion) zu meinem großen Lebenstempel teleportiert und hab einen Angriff auf die Feuerfraktion von Norden aus geführt, während meine Hauptarmee den Todeslord verfolgte.
Ich dachte er sei einigermaßen intelligent+ würde sich in sein Gebiet zurückziehen und noch jede Menge starker Truppen rekrutieren, daher schickte ich meine Hauptarmee in das Todesgebiet.

Während meine Erdarmee ein Dorf der Feuerfraktion einnahm, dort eine Lebensdiebesgilde baute (man hat immer pro Dorf die Wahl zw. Gebäuden der angrenzenden Fraktionen, aber kann nur 1 Gebäude und 1 Wachturm bauen= man sieht sehr viel des Umlandes) und Söldner anheuerte +damit die Feuerfraktion angriff. Später schickte ich dann meine Erdarmee hinter dem Todeslord her, den ich zufällig gesehen hatte.
Meine Hauptarmee vernichtete inzwischen sämtliche Gebäude der Todesfraktion, aber das war nicht mehr nötig denn:
Meine Erdarmee hatte den Todeslord der immer noch fast solo war im Feuergebiet entdeckt und hat mit ihm den Boden aufgewischt.

So endete dann dieser Durchlauf x)

Fazit:
Immer noch ein recht gutes Strategiespiel, mit einigen Schwächen in der K.I und auch manchen Balancingproblemen. Hatte ca. 2 DC's während der gesamten Spieldauer von ca. 7,5 Stunden.

Trotz der sehr angestaubten Grafik+ den Mängeln, vergebe ich u.a. aus Nostalgiegründen immernoch 6/10 Sternchen ;)
Es soll wohl auch eine Art-FanMod geben die vieles am Balancing ändert, aber ich wollte es quasi nochmal im Urzustand spielen so wie ich es damals kannte.",1711557880,1711557880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Lords of magic is a classic

its a game that I played alot as a kid and finally managed to win (kill balkoth) as an adult after I fully grasped the mechanics.

as much as I love lords of magic and I highly recommend it for anyone that's interested it does appear to me to be an unfinished game.

there  are a lot of basic quality of life features missing from the game. For example in the mid-endgame its essential that you start garrisoning troops at your towns and buildings so that trash mobs and low level enemy heroes don't constantly take them over. Its important to do this because your armies cannot move very far and the various elements of your town that produce units are spread away from your city. 

in heroes of might and magic its all in your city so you only have to manage defence for  one thing. Even if you take on multiple cities, you will just have one structure to dump your defensive units in.

in lords of magic you have to generate a lot of trash heroes just to defend your (especially in the later game) many cities and unit producing buildings. Levelling these heroes is really slow and even in the later game they wont be able to manage high level dungeons where they could potentially earn some real experience.

so what you are left with is your main high level party burning through the enemy and then trash left behind to defend that will never really reach a high level. 

another solution is just to pump high level units and watch the enemy throw trash mobs at them forever and ever.

once you know how to significantly outpace the enemy AI for resources (grab as many cities as you can and pump them to high level for max resource gain) the game becomes less about how effective your heroes are and more about access to the end tier units.

in my playthroughs im only ever able to bring one or maybe two heroes close to high level before trashing balkoth because to grind them further would just get boring. Ive already hit the enemy so hard all they can do is generate trash heroes and low level units.

this could be solved by allowing higher level cities to create heroes that start past level 1. 
the way unit production works is that the corresponding basic hero types can hire units and give them bonus experience based on their own level. 

This keeps the trash units useful so long as they are being made by a high level hero. 

the problem is that the heroes themselves unless they are supported by a full mass of trash or by high level units are quite squishy. Its often very annoying to train up low level heroes in the later game.

you have these ""marauding parties"" that like the other nations will travel around trying to trash your cities and towns. The problem is that they are always trash level and barely any experience. This game really needed more multi level dungeons (and some kind of healing bonus between levels) to make levelling the heroes more fun. As it stands you have  a dozen dungeons or so per nation which 2 or 3 of them being level 10 which means you cant pull them off unless via a high level hero AND high level units. I have even lost legendary units throwing them at these dungeons just to see if they could take them...

this all kind of contributes to the basic flow of the game breaking more and more the farther into the turns you get. 

The other significant issue with lords of magic is the actual real time with pause combat.

this game has a very janky real time system and its obvious that its really a turn based rule set being applied simultaneously for each side.  I think this game would play a lot better as a turn based game. Often a ton of damage will come of units in later game fights and it wont be obvious because the frames of animation per unit are so low. regardless of the gamespeed this is tough to manage. In most RTS games you have quite a high amount of animation frames because its essential for micro, the general idea in lords of magic is that everything is kind of slow so your higher level hero can be easily mobbed and murdered. This makes the most viable combat strategy for almost everything to be tanking units with the highest attack and defend stats in ""parry"" (defend on yourself to convert half attack value to defence value) while you have some ranged unit or something nasty like a dragon nail everything. 

Magic is great but it takes forever to level up your wizards and you also have to leave them in the mage towers to study spells. This makes their level up path a matter of giving them a few guardian units and just letting the AI try and kill the mage tower over and over.

im really not sure what the developer intended as the end game turn cycle....I take over 70% of the cities by turn 170-ish and I can get multiple legendary by turn 200 which makes the final confrontation trivial. 

I often found myself just using the auto-battle feature on large armies of trash because the micro of so many units with such low frames of animation is less effective than just banging their stats against the enemy in the auto result.

if you have a big high level trash army its almost guaranteed you wont lose any units doing this unless you are up against high tier units. 

I cant help but feel that alot of these features were meant to differentiate Lords from Might and Magic. Its just that ironically the game would play better if the battles were structured closer to might and magic.... considering how important each and every units low frame attacks and defence are. 

Impressions games also made Lords of the realm 1-3 and lords 2 was released just before lords of magic. That game has a much more effective real time battle system that is more typical of RTS games. Its surprising that lords of magic's real time combat seems like such a step backwards. 

other small things irk me like the AI being so easy to beat once you understand how it works.
It will rarely use magic and its very easy to stop them from getting high tier units by greifing the building that makes them or attacking them economically.

On the upside: lords of magic managed to create a generic fantasy setting that somehow feels completely unique and far superior to the might and magic games. Because each nation is tied to some elemental thing the units are quite unique and  the world has a slight alien quality (think cuter morrowind) the art and music are amazing.

its sad that Lords of magic didn't take off like might and magic but its kind of obvious why: its ""finished"" but its not polished to a high sheen and the choice to pair low frames per action character animation (like a turn based game) in a real time battle engine was a terrible idea.

I think lords of magic was just so ambitious in its scope there's a reason pretty much nothing has followed in its footsteps. Sure there are a million heroes of might and magic clones.....but none I can think of tried to stuff real time into what is clearly a turn based game under the hood.

try fighting the oposite team that started with hatred instead of trust towards your chosen team. theres also a global enemy lord in the team death who will give its neighbours its units through plea or request which can be exploited if you need hacks to win. and the oposite team life has mage that can learn a spell from 4 different classes of spell types with about 20 unique  spells per team  and usually only one place to research them if your a neighbour of another team, or up to 5 if you own that teams settlement. to boost only life units which is overly specific when some teams copy each others units, like team air has the same units as life, but cannot recieve the buff from the same spell that was relatively easy to research but would make it slower to benefit from if you only have 1 of these 5 research centres and instead then destroy it to build a barracks to have a life unit worth casting your research spell on. two of these research centres or .. villages i could name them, are actually on islands on the original map. between death-water and earth-life. and getting across the water to them adds another layer of difficulty and time deal to utilising these overpowered spells but adds another challenge towards the end-game if you try to get to one of these islands early. dont trade with death, limit yourself to one level 3 settlement, maybe grabs someones temple early and you can actually take another teams lord unit for yourself and his settlement will join you, the ai enemy teams can also do this. to each other. you can even defeat the all but one unit on the battlefield run away and let them deal the finishing blow to the temples.

i have two favourite ways of playing: #2 is play chaos, and start with the rust water spell as chaos cant build mages to buff ranged it costs roughly 600 barter points and you can send thieves to waters mage tower to kidnap as a hostage, but it can get a water mage through trade, or play the custom hairandfairmap and chaos and water will be neighbours, but on the original map this isnt an option, thats why as only a death mage should buff range, or life or order. i'd note air thieves can fly. ranged flying units are p v e hacks in lomse but in pvp its not so overpowered and is very fair as open world randomly generated terrain doesnt include holes that be floated over there isnt anything to exploit. dont use them for dungeons, and dont use them on beaches where they hover over the water and can be exploited. 
then #1 way is personly i would play air. take a mage and some wind riders and go to some caves. but take all the thieves to pvp against teams like earth. that way its fair.
 then defeat earth and take his territory. because -i want to get to that island on the edge of earth-life. i dont want 4 order mage towers. airs lord unit, as a thief, at level 12, gets the largest lvl 12 stat increase ive noticed i think it was 16 defense with no artifacts, and 9 defense is usually enough for everything else. playing air is fair its fast but its not end-game powerful. earth is always over powered and easy to level but its challenging on resources this way. and theres no advantage from having 5 earth mage towers
i spells that can nullify or escape combat like waters freeze, earths earth meld or lifes resurrect, and ive noticed a bug from earths create rocks that is worth trying.

 the actual lord unit named after the player at max level gets some unproportional variation thats only really examined from clicking new game, choosing a lord, clicking customise, purchasing any unit, sliding an artifact onto the unit, deleting the unit, finding the artifact again, then watching where it is, sliding it over to your lord, right clicking it to sell the artfact then return to where we watched us slide it from, and a bug-should show the item is there with-out the picture icon, but the text box shows its name, right click that, and it should duplicate points to spend on expierence, sort of...this will discover it but not make it work.
so drag it onto your lord, then drag it where it was at the top, then back to your lordand let-go, then right-click the invisible thing at the top with text box, then drag it from your lord to where the invisible thing was, let go- then right click-where you see a text box for the invisible bugged artifacts icon box. rinse repeat. (when you right click your refunding your barter points)
 helping to examine lvl 12 lord units or buy and test any artifact for any team. can also be used to start with extra units, can be gifted to enemy teams, can create your own game basicly. 600 hours in 2023 thats funny.
ive noticed airs buff spells fade off instantly almost 5 seconds after they have been casted so i cant increase ranged from dex with air spells but it can through artifacts. 
warriors always need to rally, it gives an xp boost. mages always need to cast a spell in combat it also gives an xp boost. thieves.. need more thieves.. i expect one thief can free alot of other thieve prisoners at once and it will pay off when caught stealing artifacts

Despite this lack of modernisation, it carries a pretty high price tag for such an ancient game.  This seems to have been put on Steam as a nostalgia gouge.

Topically this is basically a clone of Heroes of Might and Magic, but it lacks some of the simplistic charm.  The sheer age of the game and derivative theme make it unrecommendable today.

In the turn based strategy game you can play many different factions with different units and playstyles, and magic spells. The aim is to get rid of all enemies, especially your elements opposing faction and become the lord of the magic world. The faction of life for example is hostile to death, order against chaos, fire against water, earth against air. 

You can win by amazing tactical combar, outplaying opponents (but it is hard) or by economical aspects, like upgrading your city and getting more resources. If you upgrade everything you will get access to a unique and powerful creature that you can summon in the temple. So the game offers a good variety in options how you may approach to win the game. 

Your main goals therefore are liberating your temple and city and mines and breweries for resource income. If you liberate a different factions temple, they may swear loyality to you and you get a second lord - which is nice if your main lord dies, which means, game over. That said, only one Lord will survive - hopefully you.

I am a huge fan of the game since it came out - which is long in the past. But the game presents some wanted and some unintended difficulties. 
You never know what happens around you, thrilling right? Additionally you definetly need the save function as you likely will test your parties limits, especially when you are new to the game. And this aspect is related to the next aspect, which is the outdated and rather horrible unit control and pathfinding. Some little annoyance is that even though pc's nowadays can calculate everyting in a second, the turn calculation takes a lot of time. Well the field of players will thin out, so it will get batter ;)

All in all i still like this game and but i can only recommend it to people that are searching for interesting game designs or retro gamer.

Hier geht's zu meinem Nostalgie-Waetsch's Play:
https://youtu.be/0jJ7GhI2uhQ

Ganz ähnlich wie beim berühmten Heroes of Might and Magic ziehen wir hier mit Helden los und bauen Stück für Stück unser Reich auf. Zu Beginn wählen wir unsere grundsätzliche Ausrichtung (Kämpfer, Magier, Dieb) und unseren ""Magiepfad"" (Leben, Chaos, Wasser, Feuer, etc.) und schon geht es los. Wir starten mit einer kleinen Truppe und befreien erst mal den Magieturm, damit wir uns auch Lord nennen dürfen, dann heuern wir weitere Kämpfer an und grasen die Karte nach ""Ressourcenspender"" wie Goldminen und Brauereien ab. An Ressourcen gibt es drei bzw. vier. Wir haben Gold, Bier, Kristalle und Bevölkerung. Je größer unser Ruhm, umso mehr Leute finden sich in unserem Städtchen ein. Diese können wir dann als Soldaten ausbilden oder zum Goldscheffeln, Bierbrauen oder Kristalle... ja was eigentlich?... abstellen. Die Grafik ist natürlich 1997-like, ziemlich pixelig, die Musik geht gut ins Ohr und die Geräuscheffekte sind passend. Schade, dass man keine Chance hat, die Auflösung von 640x480 Pixel zu verändern. Auch an die Steuerung muss man sich zunächst gewöhnen. Mit Linksklick auswählen und mit Linksklick sagen, wo es hingeht. Rechtsklick ist abwählen. Das ist man heute anders gewohnt. Hat man als die Grafik verkraftet und die Steuerung verinnerlicht, stehen einem viele spaßige Runden bevor. Ach ja, die Kämpfe werden nicht Runde um Runde ausgetragen. Hier spielt man dann in Echtzeit, die man aber jederzeit pausieren kann. Alles in allem ein Spiel, was immer noch Spaß macht und eines Remakes würdig wäre.

Folgt mir auch gerne bei Steam:

Many would say that are the memories that people hold about a particular work of art, others would say that are the remarkable features that it possess, or even the audacity of the developer to try new concepts ahead of their time, stepping on unknown territory that few dared to even look at. This game has all of these elements and more, this game is a work of art, this game is Lords of Magic, a [b]true classic[/b].

It is a game that frequently calls me back to it. I look to play it at least once each year, and it never gets old.

My first contact with this game was on a shareware CD back in 2001, it had the demo of the game along with many others, back then it was one of the few sources of discovering new software. I will never forget the first time i've opened it's menu and listened to the theme and the iconic voice of the narrator. The demo had only the Earth Warrior and the Life Mage to use, and only featured those two civilizations, and you were not able to upgrade any of your buildings too, which prohibits you from acquiring all of the units. Even then, with just that small piece of content, i was able to enjoy many nights of fun, while listening to the legendary arrangements of it's soundtrack. From the small phrases that each unit would say, to every ambient sound, the game created an atmosphere os magic, adventure and mystery. The dark fog of the map was hiding unknown treasures and dangers, it was really a feeling that few games gave me, specially back then. The legendary team of Impressions Games, the same studio that created the legendary Pharaoh title, did a great job. It took me many years to find the full version of it on the internet, because it was never available where i live, and the complete game is a masterpiece.

This game was ahead of it's time in many aspects. Back in 1997 there were very few games that would try emulating a 2.5D real time combat RPG, mixed with a turn based tactical map, fully voiced units, and even a narrator. And Lords of Magic succeeded on it's attempt. Basically you have a board that has units and locations, and you control unit groups that can have a maximum of 3 heroes and 9 other units, using these groups you expand your influence on the map by conquering locations and looting others. Your objective is always to destroy Balkoth the Lord of Death. Unless you are playing Death, then your objective is to exterminate everyone.
The combat in RNG stat based on direct confrontations, but it is a strategy game with a lot of complex mechanics and attributes on each unit. There are Hero units, and they have special abilities that you can use both on the strategic map and in the real time battlefield.
Heroes are separated in three different classes, Mages are fragile on direct combat but have powerful spells from their faith that can harm enemies and help allies. Warriors are extremely strong on direct confrontations of melee combat. Thieves are fragile but have cunning abilities like hiding, increased speed, ranged attacks and can perform many special actions, like knocking out certain enemies, spying on the tactical map and more.
Every nation of this game has special units that are based on their faith, with unique attributes and abilities. Some can fly, some are fast, some are tough, some have magical abilities. Every nation also has a special grand temple which brings many special benefits to the owner and has a legendary creature too that can only be summoned once per game, usually.
Every nation also has a unique soundtrack that fits their theme very well, and is extremely remarkable, combined with their lore that you can find in their buildings and spell books.
In the end, the game looks like a very big board, with each nation having their capital and unit buildings around it, the great temple, and beyond that are the neutral locations that have treasures and enemies. The map never changes, it is all hard coded, but even then, you will find enjoyment playing with different tribes, because it is always different.

Looking through modern lenses, the game has aged very well, it's user interface is very good, compared to other software from it's time and is very elegant in my opinion. The AI is very basic, and can be easily exploited in some particular cases, but event then, sometimes it can surprise you, specially if you don't know how the game works completely. The graphics are charming and the music remains legendary. This Steam version runs very fine and has all the features.

I am sure that i am not the only person that was enchanted by the magic of this game, because there are lot's of fans from all around the world. If you enjoy classic computer games, and also like RTS, map strategy games, this is a must play. The magical land of Urak awaits you!

The game is basically Heroes of Might and Magic except a bit more tactical.
When you start a new game you can choose from 3 classes and any of the 8 elements, giving you a lot of freedom of choice for such an old game. Once you have chosen you will appear on the main game map where you can see your town, and caves/place where you will find monsters to defeat, using the ability to summon creatures to aid you, hire more troops that can gain experience with you, research new spells, towns where you can direct townsfolk to work in certain areas to increase your income, this being: (Fame, Gold, Ale, Followers and Crystals). Other heroes will direct your armies as you grow them. From here on you set off to conquer everyone or save the realm.

The combat can be clunky and frustrating, so more than half of the time, you auto-calculate your battles.

The game itself has a dark yet fantasy themed grainy feel to it, reminding me of LoTR and shining in terms of 'classic'.

It is one of my all-time favourites. I still have the original disc. The voices, sound and music add a lot of atmosphere. Perfect for those cozy-fantasy eves while listening to your favourite podcast.

Ho deciso comunque di fare una recensione anche su questo gioco perché ha delle sue peculiarità per essere uno strategico di 25 anni fa! 

Premettendo che non consiglierei a nessun nuovo giocatore di comprarlo poiché pieno di bug, combattimenti lenti e un po' macchinosi, inaccettabili per gli standard odierni. Questo è un cimelio che appartiene ormai allo scorso millennio, e si deve valutare come tale.

Detto ciò voglio spendere alcune note favorevoli, soprattutto per gli amanti del genere che lo rendono comunque unico:
- Fazioni, esistono 8 fazioni legati agli elementi di questo mondo fantastico, tutti estremamente personalizzati e con le proprie peculiarità. Le fazioni sono vita e morte, fuoco e acqua, aria e terra, ordine e caos.
- Politica, troviamo un inizio di intelligenza artificiale sulle attitudini degli avversari, legati a doni, favori e scambi di vario genere(oggetti, magie, edifici). Le relazioni tra differenti reami all'inizio di una partita sono legate:  1) alla dualità delle singole fazioni, ad esempio caos e ordine sono nemici per natura(come scozzesi e altri scozzesi). 2) In base a come le fazioni son disposte nell'indicatore dei turni in basso a destra dello schermo, più sono vicine al colore della tua fazione più saranno amichevoli con te questo solo al principio, poi le guerre cambiano tutto.
- Magie, ogni fazione ha magie proprie uniche di attacco, difesa e utilità uniche più un set di magie generiche comuni a tutti. Per studiarle funziona in questo modo : Costruito la torre dei maghi, hai a disposizione una biblioteca nella quale puoi mettere a studiare un certo numero di maghi che aumenta con il livello della torre del mago. Ogni magia ha un numero di giorni umani che impiega per essere appresa, il tempo in turni impiegato per imparare una determinata magia sarà: numero di giorni umani/ (somma totale del livello dei maghi che studiano contemporaneamente)  questo numero indica quanti turni ci vogliono per impararla, e una volta imparata sarà una conoscenza indelebile del tuo lord. Altra parte importantissima, andando avanti con la partita e soggiogando regni avversari, potrai costruire e imparare le magie di ogni regno (Una miriade di magie diverse).
- Esercito: l'esercito è diviso battaglioni da massimo 30 unità dove all'interno avremo max 3 campioni e 
 max 27 truppe. I campioni possono essere di 3 classi diverse mago, guerriero o assassino, mentre i soldati si dividono fanteria corpo a corpo, fanteria a distanza o fanteria magica di diversi tipi in base alla fazione con cui si sta giocando, ma in genere ogni fazione ha almeno una 10 di unità diverse da costruire. Parte davvero interessante,  campioni e truppe, hanno un livello che aumenta con le battaglie vinte, il limite delle truppe solitamente e nettamente inferiore a quello dei campioni. I campioni salendo di livello, possono se messi nelle rispettive strutture  (esempio paladino nella struttura delle truppe corpo a corpo) può trasmettere nei turni la propria conoscenza all'edificio permettendo di produrre truppe con esperienza avanzata e quindi più forti. Altra peculiarità, i campioni possono trovare e indossare oggetti trovati nei vari dungeons nella mappa che aumentano le statistiche oppure danno abilità o magie.
- Dungeons ed edifici: La mappa e ricca dungeons ed edifici, che ci permetteranno di ottenere risorse, esperienza e oggetti senza dover incontrare obbligatoriamente in battaglia le altre fazioni. Le ambientazioni e la disposizione delle truppe iniziale possono far cambiare radicalmente il risultato di una battaglia. Alcune battaglie se svolte in modalità ""automatica"" saranno perse, e occorrerà giocarle manualmente per avere qualche speranza di vincere, limitare le perdite o fuggire da un imboscata.
- Roccaforti: Le roccaforti sono le città principali delle fazioni, da difendere in quanto producono il numero più alto di risorse, permettono di utilizzare e aumentare i livelli delle baracche delle truppe e producono SEGUACI, che è la risorsa che ci permetterà di reclutare le unità in modalità NON MERCENARIA. Quindi è molto importante difenderle. I seguaci si uniranno a te 1 volta alla settimana in base al quanta fama hai accumulata. La fama si fa con le battaglie, liberazione dei grandi templi, dungeon.
- Edifici delle risorse: Alcuni edifici sulla mappa, una volta liberati dai nemici, genereranno giornalmente delle risorse, utili per pagare il mantenimento delle tue truppe.
- Aree di combattimento che cambiano in base al dungeon, edificio o terreno calpestato, altissimo livello di personalizzazione anche se semplice.

Pseudo-Contro:
- Grafica: E' un gioco di 25 anni fa, quindi vintage al massimo poiché non potrebbe competere con una valutazione sulla grafica moderna.
- Intelligenza-Artificiale: Molto scarsa per quanto riguarda il late game e altre dinamiche ingaggio degli attacchi da parte del computer. Ad ogni modo è un precursore di un modello di intelligenza artificiale, molti giochi hanno raggiunto queste dinamiche solo alcuni anni dopo(ovviamente dico precursore ma è un gioco di nicchia, quindi non ci sono molti casi che possono aver preso proprio come esempio questo gioco).

Contro: 
- Movimenti: marciando su alcune parti della mappa la penalità di movimento è altissima, facendoti perdere molti turni, cruciali per vincere.
- Signore della morte troppo aggressivo, in maniera random potresti essere investito dal signore della morte che è nemico di tutti, ed è troppo forte. Lo puoi battere solo con eserciti potenziati al massimo, avrebbero dovuto predisporre un timer prima del suo arrivo, una centinaia di turni sarebbero stati sufficenti così da farti vivere di più i combattimenti tra fazioni pre-avvento del signore della morte.
- Editor delle mappe: complicato, non di facile utilizzo.
- Navi: le imbarcazioni possono portare massimo 1 campioni con 3 gruppi di truppe, per portare 1 battaglione da 30 occorrono minimo 3 navi. Le navi sono unità esercito che possono combattere da sole.
- Bug: il gioco non è ben implementato su tutto, si presenteranno moltissimi bug che non sto ad elencare.
- SALVATAGGIO AUTOMATICO: Non funziona bene, non fidatevi, fate almeno un salvataggio manuale frequentemente.


Il mio resoconto rimane comunque POSITIVO per tutti i nostalgici amanti del genere poiché è davvero unico, per tutti quelli invece che si approcciano a questo gioco per la prima volta, consiglio di armarsi di notevole pazienza e fare SALVATAGGI MANUALI OGNI TURNO.",1648759498,1648759498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Я получив цю гру в стімі в основному для того щоб глянути яка різниця між піраткою і ліцухою + я ні де не міг найти адекватної робочої піратки ну на ліцусі приємніше всетаки грати ну і в кінці кінців щоб написати рецензію.
Смішно то що ніхто серед українських ГЕЙмерів не написав досі рецензію на цю прекрасну гру в мене деколи було таке відчуття що я напевно єдиний українець який знає про існування цієї гри але все-таки є як мінімум ще одна людина яка шарить в цій грі не менше мене це мій брат ну і є ще пару людей які не грали в цю гру але чули про неї від мене.
Іто чому ця гра настільки не відома досить легко пояснити тому що розробники цієї гри не були багатими і можливість розкрутити цей проект але якимось чудом в глибокому дитинстві я получив диск з цією грою і зіграв в це чудо ще на самому першому своєму пк який був білий і там був встановлений windows xp gta vice city tmnt 2 battle nexus і ще парочку стратегій серед яких була ця в яку я саме більше награв і першу запустив.
На той момент графіка в цій грі будоражила мій не укріпший маленький мозочок я справді був в шоці від деяких катсцен і графіка мені здавалась настільки реальною що прям ВАУ!
І навіть після того як я зіграв в гта вай сіті мені графіка в LoM'i здавалась більш фотореалістичною якщо так можна виразитись.
Я хочу максимально багато всього розказати і про цю гру і про мою історію знайомства знею бо це єдиний україномовний огляд на цю гру напевно а усьому інтернеті або як мінімум в стімі.
Тому я хочу викласти всю душу і всі свої почуття і емоції нарахунок цього чуда ігрової індустрії.
Ну що ж.
Не дивлячись на те що ця гра вийшла аж в 1997 році графіка на той момент була досить хорошою і атмосфера в цій грі просто неймовірна це напевно єдина гра від якої в мене тільки позитивні спогади і уявляється справді прекрасний фєнтезі світ в якому є і брутальність, хаос, вбивство, розбійництво і в  одночасно спокій, мир, світло і красиві краєвиди.
Всю цю атмосферу задає не тільки прекрасний стиль цієї гри і її графіки а ще музика яка тут також неймовірно атмосферна і просто ідеально передає атмосферу цього віртуального світу якби я підставив любу іншу музику замінивши стандартну в цій грі я б такого не відчув але це не означає що ви не можите на чілі залетіти в цю гру і включити свій плейлист в Spotify,SoundCloud або ще десь і кайфувати від ігрового ГЕЙмплею і слухати музику.
Просто атмосфера може трохи пропасти.
Зразу скажу я дуже сильно люблю стратегії і це взагалі один з моїх самих любимих жанрів ігор якщо навіть не самий любимий.
І тому то що моє знайомлення з цим жанром почалося з цієї гри багато для мене значить і скажу чесно після цієї гри я рідко находив ігри серед стратегій які могли б стати з нею в один ряд.
Незнаю чи це через мої ностальгічні спогади я так думаю мені здається що якби я зараз випадково наткнувся б на цю гру подумав б щось типу цього:""хмм ще одна стара нікому не потрібна стратегія чимось похожа на героїв 3 і тому подібне"" але якби я навіть зараз зіграв б в цю гру клянусь вона б мені сподобалась.
Я не графодрочер і тому графіку в іграх нормально сприймаю якщо сама гра дуже якісно зроблена то я можу і графон потерпіти і через це я досі можу зіграти в дуууже старі проекти і получити від них в 10 раз більше задоволення ніж від сучасних ААА проектів.
Но все-таки не хочеться але доведеться признати що графіка в цій грі устаріла причому дуже сильно і нажаль ніхто не зробив ні ремастеру ні ремейку цієї гри в основному через те що розробники цієї гри закрилися в 2004 році через не успішну 3 частину ""Lords of the realm"" і я грав багато ігор від цих розробників навіть в дитинстві но ні одна їхня гра мені так не айшла як ця і навіть по оцінкам видно що це в якомусь сенсі сама високооцінена їхня гра причому повністю заслуговано.
Тепер хотів б сказати яка різниця між піраткою і ліцухою для тих хто не хоче купляти.
Ну почнемо з того що в цій грі існував або існує я так до кінця і не вкурив онлайн режим і буквально сьогодні я провірив сам чи він працює і у мене получилось створити свій світ до якого міг б підключитися інший гравець і по ідеї ми змогли б разом грати але коли я пробував зробити всьо то саме але на піратці в мене навіть кнопка мультиплеєр не працювала і мені просто писало що ви не можите цього зробити і мене відправляло на сайт де типу писало що онлайн цієї гри перестав підтримуватися з 2004 року тому я на всі 100% не впевнений чи тут працює онлайн чи ні бо коли я хотів запустити на ліцусі онлайн то мені писало що треба ще одного гравця а так то вибрати клас лорда і так далі я міг і налаштувати всьо як мені треба Макс. Гравців 7.
Окрім цього в Special Edition входить DLC Legends of Urak.
І чесно в дитинстві я не пом'ятаю чи в мене було це длс і чи я його проходив але то що тут за кожного персонажа в цьому длс є своя історія яка відрізняється від інших я незнав тому сенс пройти за кожного з них все таки є.
Тому я хз чи на піратках це є але зараз в у мене елементарно не получалося найти піратку а навіть якщо находив і получалося скачати то цього длс і тембільше онлайну там не було або просто вилітало і ставалася помилка.
Тому рішивши що мати таку прекрасну гру в бібліотеці стім це ++++ респект від ультра жостких стратегів типу мене якщо такі є.
Так нарахунок самої гри сказати мені нічого окрім позитиву.
Є куча стехій за які ви можите зіграти вода, хаос, земля, життя, вогонь, ордер, повітря, і смерть за яку на початку не можливо зіграти треба замочити Балкота що і є вашою головною ціллю + тут є 3 класи це воїн, маг, розбійник.
Мені саме більше заходили воїни ну і деколи маги за розбійників досить хардкорно і обдовбано грати але вони можуть ставати невидимими як Рікі і красти скарби у інших народів ну по приколу або для хардкорності зіграти можна.
В мене получилось навіть вбити в соло за воїна Ордеру самого Балкота і його армію я тоді сам оху#в від того який я малий genius це ще було в 2008-2010 році.
Єхх ностальжи і ви навіть не уявляєте яку я ""nostalgia ultra"" як альбом Frank Ocean відчув коли через стільки років сьогодні ще раз запустив цю гру ох ностальжи...
Якби я хотів  поставити адекватну оцінку цій грі не получиться бо я кончений фанат цієї гри і так її обожнюю що готовий пробачити усі її мінуси якщо вони існують як мінімум через прекрасне дитинство яке вона  як і 10 інших ігор подаровали мені.
Графіка як для свого часу + стратегії + від бідної компанії 10/10
Музика 10000000000000000/10
Атмосфера 10/10
Контент 10/10
Сюжет 10/10 (+ досить оригінальний і персонажі цікаві з цікавим лором)
Онлайн -/10 бо його тут толком нема можливо був але тепер ні.
Це напевно єдиний мінус який я можу виділити іто не факт що то так і є.
Ну і саме головне це ГЕЙмплей за Balkoth'@ коли ви за нього граєте і маєте свою армію нежеті то відчуваєте себе смертью яка насувається на усі народи і прийде до кожного в хатку і зруйнує їхній щоденний спокій як мінімум заради цього відчуття я рекомендую зіграти в цю гру.
Якщо ви не шарите в інгліші то мейбі десь в інеті можна скачати русифікатор який існує + з озвучкою але я думаю що в цю гру краще грати в оригіналі по 1 озвучка тут просто шикарна особливо в катсценах + шрифт більш приємний ну і в кінці кінців завдяки цієї гри можна непогано так вивчити інгліш тому рекомендую грати в оригіналі як і я.
Я навіть в дитинстві грав на english тому якщо я в такому віці шарив що до чого то ви в любому іншому віці тембільше маєте шарити.
На цьому я міг б закінчити свій огляд бо це більше ніж просто рецензія це моя історія пов'язана з цією грою вона прекрасна і я сміло в ношу її в список самих улюблених ігор які я зіграв і сама улюблена і перша стратегія.
Якщо ви як і я любите strategy games і для вас як і для мене нові стратегії в основному погані і не стоять на рівних з старими і ви хочите зіграти стару і прекрасну стратегію тоді дуже сильно рекомендую.",1641747603,1641747603,True,5,1,0.599304735660552979,0,True,True,False,False,,,

To my surprise, I still very much enjoyed playing through the game. It's much easier than I recalled and the games tend to end prematurely due to the mishaps of the AI, but given how dated the game is, I think it holds up reasonably well. Undoubtedly, nostalgia plays a pivotal role in how many games I have completed since, but I still recommend the game to friends given the price. I wouldn't expect one unfamiliar to the franchise to become instantly enthralled, however, it is well worth the purchase in my opinion. It should be noted that I have an affinity for turn-based games and this one blends together real-time combat to give it that extra oomph. Combining pseudo-myth-based creatures/characters and other fantasy tropes makes for a pleasing aesthetic despite the outdated....everything.

The music is sill pretty dang good, and the game is a neat mix of turn based with real time combat.

It's not balanced or boring that way. It's a game where you can find imbalanced and stupid strategies, like flying unhittable Air thieves (assuming nobody has a bow & arrow to shoot back at you).

Sometimes, when you equip artifacts, there is a bug where they don't properly boost your stats, so you have to reload a saved game, or reboot the game for them to work. Other times there are bugs where you can't equip 2 artifacts at the same time, even if you fit the qualifications for both. I had Fire warrior and trying to equip both Dragon Armor and the Swords of Flames, but sometimes it wouldn't let me equip both and other times it would.

The balance can also be all over the place. A Lvl-1 hamlet might have 3 Lvl-1 centaurs and a mite that you can steam-roll. Then start another new game, go into another Lvl-1 cave and have to face the same thing, BUT with 3 Lvl-3 wolves instead of the Mite.

Also some of the tooltips seem out of wack. Hand of Fate (Chaos spell) said I should have 66% chance to deal damage to a target (I was Lvl 2), but I somehow failed 3 straight times vs. level 1 targets. Odds of that are happening are like 4%, so maybe just unlucky, BUT I had Luckstone (+3 luck) equipped.

Each faith comes with its own unique units and spells. Each has its strengths and weaknesses but each is powerful and can be combined with units of other faiths when you are strong enough. Liberate your great temple for a deadly and unique legendary creature.

Cons-Showing its age- The controls are a bit clunky at times, and not all the information is presented too clearly, though you pick it up pretty fast.
The randomness- Sometimes...it is a little unfair. The Chaos starting area seems especially prone to this. Random dungeons, scattered to help your rookie lord level up, have levels assigned to them. Level 3 elsewhere may have some semi tough baddies it, but  nothing extraordinary.
Level 3 in the Chaos area has the highest summonable monsters in the game.

Unlike it's antecedents, Lords of the Realm and Lords of the Realm 2, this game barely qualifies as a strategy game in any meaningful way. Indeed, it makes me wonder if the developers were even the same group of people.

This game tries really, really hard to be Heroes of Might & Magic with active battles, but it just doesn't work well. Best part of the game is its soundtrack, though it sounds plenty dated. The town and battle UI are both awful, the developer clearly wanted to create something immersive for town, but what it ends up being is an indiscernible mishmash of interface hotspots on a pre-rendered screen that don't behave like you'd anticipate. Same kind of thing in battles, but with a mouse interface that ends up doing things you don't want your units to do.

Active battles are mostly awful. It's nigh impossible to close range on most ranged units and your guys just fall over dead with alarming speed. The garbage auto-calc algorithm just applies 100% of the damage to the units in order, so there's no effective way to spare units, especially early game, other than to not have them in the battle. Healing takes a veritable eternity.

If you're looking for a classic fantasy strategy game along these lines, maybe play Age of Wonders, a game that will stand the test of time for a long time. Or, Battle for Wesnoth if you're looking for something closer to Fire Emblem. If you want a game with active battles (not my thing), I hear most of the Total War games are good enough for them to churn out 834297 sequels, and that's kind of what this attempts to be, similar to LotR 1&2 mentioned above, just with fantasy units and ""better' graphics.",1592597188,1592597188,False,0,0,0.407295048236846924,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I gotta say its old, but still fun. The only problem is that it can be a bit overwhelming and confusing at first, but once you know what to do and get into the main of the game it becomes very fun.

Heres a few tips if you decide to get this, for early game.
-Take any places with greyish flags over them, these are controlled by hostile neutrals, most produce some kind of ECO item.
-Focus on getting at least a small second force once you get some ECO going. (2 units more), a 2nd champion early off is to pricey but can help if you can afford it.
-Once you have the 2nd force, push for your Temple, it is the largest looking building and usally very close to your starting town.
-Once you take the temple, you can then start placing workers (Followers) In your town, this will produce more ECO items.
-Try to make deals with other factions that are in their favor, doing this makes them friendlier towards you and more likely to cut better deals your way. This is a double edge sword as making deals in their favor usally hurts your ECO but you can usally gain some units that you can produce yet (Such as earth being able to get fire soldiers)

From there its mostly trail and error and learning whole to deal with first, who to trust, ETC.",1580688734,1580688734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yeah, new games look nicer but they are really just more complexities and flashing lights. Lords of Magic is a true gem, simple to learn yet hard to master. Even though I have played this game as possibly every type of character, I still like to come back to it.
The variability in each play-through is great, do you like sneaking and theaving? Perfect. Do you like being the noble paladin bringing justice to the lawless? Be it. Do you dream of obliterating an entire army with a single spell? Do it. With 24 unique starting characters featuring three different character types and eight powerful and unique magics you can create your own legends.
I have not seen any game with a magic system quite like this one. The spells do fit into common categories and several spells have similarities to spells from other ""Religions"" (schools) but the way each team uses its magic is so different it gives real character to the game.
If you want even more out of this game then look up Mantera's mod, adding more spells, improving the AI and giving you even more possible starting setups. (http://mantera.xorgate.com/) Mantera also supplies the tools to do modding yourself.
It may be retro, but it is also refreshing to play!

Combat: You can pause combat and give orders to each unit, then unpause and let them follow their orders.  You can pause and unpause as often as you like, so you have direct control over combat

After picking your lord's class(Warrior, Mage, or Thief) you choose their faith whereupon you are placed on the world map of Urak ready to battle hooligans inhabiting local dwellings. After leveling up your small army somewhat, it is time to liberate the Great Temple of your faith and claim the capital as your own where you may direct what your new followers produce(Gold, Ale, Crystals, and Fame). Every 7 days starting on day 7 if you have freed the Great Temple you get more followers which can also be trained at the Barracks, Thieves Guild, or Mage Tower to be new troops for your armies. You may also barter with the other faiths and build relations and if you have neutral or better relations with a faith that has not freed their Great Temple, you can free it and gain their lord and some of their units as yours to control and their lord acts as an heir if your lord dies. It does have clunky controls which are fine once adapted to. Instead of using screen side mouse scrolling, use the arrows on keyboard. Has several great mods such as Ellelone's Zero mod and GS5R3 or the unofficial U302 mod not made by Ellelone with great balancing and refining of gameplay including scroll speed controls.

As a time saver, I recommend making a hero that starts with an item that automatically fully heals you at the end of each battle, otherwise you are going to get bored really fast.  

You start off picking your hero type, thief/mage/warrior.  I recommend all newcomers play a warrior until you figure out what the other two can do.  The only exception I would make is creating an Air Mage with this one staff that lets you start the fight off casting a spell that lets you do a D.O.T. on a large swath of the enemy.  After you pick your type of hero, you will have to choose, Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Order, Chaos, Life.  Death only becomes an option after you beat the game once.  

I would suggest picking a Life Warrior and get purchase the staff that recovers your health after battle.  Then it becomes a matter of getting some valuable backup.  I suggest after freeing up your temple you go rescue Air's temple (to the west) and then immediately going south to free Order's temple.  With Order's temple you can train Order warriors in their barracks, knights are sone of the best units and when you get them to 5 you can change them into holy knights, the only unit like this that goes past level 5.

The game is great and the nostalgic feeling I get from it is amazing.  It's still difficult and challenging all these years later and it's a lot of fun. 

 That said, I would not recommend this game to other people unless those people played the game originally.  Although the game is fun, unless you have the nostaglic draw to play the game it can be very tedious at times, it has many bugs, such as, the art pictures of characters will start being very pixellated and messed up, that's stage one, after a while, the loading screens will take on that effect as well, stage 3 it can happen to the whole world.  But worst of all is stage 4, which may appear at any point beyond stage 1, where you buttons dissapear.  The only way to fix it is to relaunch the game, but can be upsetting because you literally lose the button to save your game, so you'll have to revert back to your autosave. (which I've done already today since I bought it)

The multiplayer in the game has never worked, and still does not work today, not so bad because steam let us know before I bought it, but it's still a bit of a dissapointment.

I love this game and it's always going to be one of my favorite games, but because of how it is I wouldn't recommend it to new people.  I don't think that the game would be appreciated by the audiance of people who only enjoy the more modern and polished games that are out today.  However if you like the old games with their bugs and all, this is a fantastic game.

Some of the coments talk about how the game is severly unbalanced, and to a point that is true.  But I never felt like it was a detrement, it is simply an aspect of the game, yes some characters are stronger than others in specific situations but every character of every race has it's strong suit.  Life archers have the most range, Earth Axe throwers have the strongest melee of rangers, Air slingers although weak can fly and as such go over terrain that melee characters cannot harm them.  Air and Fire warriors are very easily locked up, if you attack them with a couple people they get caught defending themselves and cannot attack, however to compensate for that they have insane damage if they can hit.  So I just have people in front of them to get hit and then stand in the 2nd row obliterating everyone.  The game isn't exaclty balanced, but because it's not you end up going around the world taking characters from each race that you want in your party to build a group that meets your play style.  And that's part of the fun of the game.  Learning their strengths and utilizing them.  Every race has units that are weak compared to the whole with the exception of death having units I would conisder to be stronger than average across the whole, but that's okay because they are the villians of your game.  And if they weren't stronger than you then what would be the point.

I've rambled on enough, but my point is, I love this game and if you're willing to give it a shot despite it's issues it's certainly a game you can enjoy, but that for the majority of players I wouldn't recommend it as it's just too old and flawed.

P.S.  Pro tip,  if you Ctrl click a character you can grab a single unit of a group of 3.",1519620963,1519620963,False,33,4,0.686201691627502441,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Loved the game! It has most things you look for in a strategy game. Stopped playing it when I went to Win 7 because it was not compatible. Now with STEAM I can play again on any OS. Great! 
  I can't believe so many people here autocalc the battles??? that is part of the fun. besides you can do MUCH better fighting them. I stiill autocalc the easy ones, but if I am losing people I back up and fight them and WIN! no losses. only healable damage. I always play on the most difficult setting, and with a few tricks, I beat it every time. 

Here is a few tricks to help win the harder battles without losing your weeker men:
1) keep one out of the three men from you groups likely to die back from the battle. 
2) you can even send them to the ""flee the battle"" flag. then when it's over you heal them and they're good as new. With experience! 
3) In the beginning, train the troops you want to keep, (leaders, archers, etc. But hire mercs as foot soldiers likely to die. they are cheaper initially. Then you basically sacrifice them in battle. this avoids the expensive upkeep.And gives the keepers the experience. Then once your leaders gain experience put them in the training places so they confer experience to the new recruits. (upgrading helps this) Then you go back and train footmen you want to keep. Do the keep one back thing till they are powerful enough not to die easily.
4) If an army attacks that's just TOO powerful, build an army of all mercs, attack them (NOT auto) then use them to take out most of the power players. They will be destroyed so there is no upkeep. Then attack them with your trained army and crush them for the experience. (you may want to leave the leaders barely alive so your trained keeper army gets the credit for destoying them) Their magic users will have used all of their mana fighting the first group so you won't have to worry about that. 
5) Save before every battle. then when you enter the battle scene make note of where the men are, and where you want them to be. autocalc to get back out. load save. switch your men around so when you re-enter they will be positioned where you want them. this is easier if you name your men. that way if you have multiple archers or whatever, you know which is which.

Графика, которая была приемлема и как-то даже будоражила воображение, сейчас откровенно уродлива. В ""стратегическом"" режиме из плохоньких текстур создается безжизненный пейзаж и плохо читаемая карта. В ""боевом"" видим анимацию характерную скорее для спектрума - кажется будто комп лагает или здесь 8 кадров в секунду. Что, 1997 год? Не оправдание: ""Warcraft 2"" вышел в 1995 - один короткий взгляд и все сразу понятно.

Механика - один большой анахронизм. Т.е. все максимально долго, неудобно, требует лишних действий и местами неочевидно. Пример: солдаты стоят денег + требуют зарплату (большую); хотите, чтобы юнит просил зарплату меньше, нужны последователи; хотите последователей, тогда зарабатывайте славу в бою и только потом каждый n-ый ход (при наличии замка) получите несколько штук. Оценили длину цепи для найма одного толкового солдата?

Еще пример: хотите исследовать новое заклинание? Сперва сходите в другое здание, наймите там волшебников, отведите в библиотеку и уже там выберите то, что они будут медленно исследовать. Зачем в такой простой вещи этот лишний микроменеджмент? Я не за упрощение всего и вся, но давайте представим, что в какой-нибудь Need for Speed для замены бампера нужно ехать в мастерскую и 5-10 минут стоять в пробке. Это ничего не дает и никак не обогащает.

Все-таки то, что можно сделать проще - делается проще.

Мне нравилась эта игра в детстве, но я ставлю палец вниз. Нет у нее какого-то уникального образа, нет хорошей истории, нет образцовой игровой механики и каких-то толковых идей, которые стоит тащить в настоящее.

I think what really makes it is the level of detail. The developers clearly spent a lot of time working on the lore. Each of its faiths has a great, distinctive feel. Every unit has their own separate portrait and voice prompt (these get repetitive but really add depth). The combat is really clunky and can be very challenging and seemingly random (I tend to just autocalc everything if I'm being honest), but there's just something so satisfying about building up your awesome army and conquering your neighbors. 

Although it can be kinda easy to get stuck in a gameplay rut, there's a decent amount of variation to be found through the various faiths and lords, the map editor (completely change up the map or even build your own... it adds way more variety than you'd expect), and the story mode expansion. That being said, I really wish this game had gained the popularity needed to get a sequel (or two or three). It would be awesome to see a more modern take on this. One thing I'd really like to see added is more expansion to the economy. A more robust trading system and financial management would really help the endgame (at which point your only options are really to kill off all of your allies, wander around fighting random dungeons, or just quit your hard-earned game.

My main annoyance is the game is very oriented towards save-reload gaming. Why:
- Death of your character = lose game.
- Enemy units pop out of fog of war and kill you the same turn. Much farther sight range would have been useful.
- Game loves spawning ""marauders"" (neutral units) that kill you randomly for above reason.
- Loss of any regular unit is very devastating early and mid game, so you end up replaying battles a lot until there are no losses (generous auto-calc also encourages this).
- Early game quest to free Great Temple doesn't permit any mistakes for harder factions.
- Stats are rarely explained by the user interface (e.g. spell effects) and so a trial and error approach is necessary.

There are all these cool things to research and build but you're not going to be able to afford them unless you expand wide and subjugate AI factions; i.e. there's limited opportunity to expand on neutrals without conquest. This is basically fine, but game would have retained more flavor if keeping other factions alive longer.

Tactical combat is generally hard to control, you need to be paused so much to issue orders that it's pretty similar to turn based combat regardless. If you want a modern game that is pretty similar and IMO has better tactical combat, have a look at Age of Wonders 3.

Factions are very asymmetrically balanced in the unmodded game, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also, the AI probably cheats a lot but it doesn't really matter that much due to the focus being on less on pure strategy and more on the overall role playing experience. Only persistent annoyance with AI is its diplomacy which again is inadequately explained in the user interface leading to frustrating experiences.

Most of my play time with this game comes from a decade ago (before Steam release).

now as a kid i played this, (played may be a strong word. ) 
the game barely ran whether it be from damage to the disc or just general incompatability.
The tutorials seem to tell you what to do but the game has a stiff learning curve and honestly may be the hardest strategy game i have ever played bar none.
This is mostly attributed to the fact that i have no idea what i am doing most of the time. i auto calc battles only now. because it seemed that even if i used a ""superior"" force my units would just fall like wheat to a scythe to enemies that by all logic shouldnt have been tough. 

Look, the game is old, i mean for a PC game its practically ancient. I get that in its Hayday it may have been a gem. but today my 22 year old brain simply cannot wrap itself around this game. i think i read somewhere that Life was the easiest to start with, and i even chose easy mode ( and sweet god if this is considered noob P***y level i dont want to see hard mode) but even still i find myself getting ruined.

the game tutorials state that the further you travel from your capital the harder the enemies, but Sh*t son i fought a level 5 hamlet that was basically my neighbor and was greeted with a Defeat screen 10 turns in ( was really 40 lol) 
You can station followers (obtained at a fixed period and their number depends on your fame. And you need your great temple first, found that out the hard way.) to different buildings in your base to generate resources. But you can only have a max of 8. meaning you can only generate 8 gold, or ale, or crystal or fame, or all 4 if you have 32 followers, per turn. upgrading your Base requires a seemingly large amount of resources as well. resources that if you choose to sit in your base and cower in fear of all the big mean baddies that want your booty like it did, will take forever to accumulate.

Again i dont understand the game. As i autocalc'd a level 2 hamlet, and recieved 38 gold and a fair sum of other resources, but did the same to a level 4 hamlet and was rewarded with practically pennies. i actually left my base, decided on a gamble and spent alot of money on cost effective swarms of units. only to find them all kick the bucket in one fight, and i recieved less than the cost of one for a reward. 
The lack of unit and item descriptions outside pictures with numbers is fairly standard for the time. sometimes it worked, sometimes you had people playing pictionary to figure out what stats they were looking at. this game, is the latter.
The artifacts too, have nothing but names ( or perhaps not. but i couldnt find the button to know) and they all have different costs at the setup before you play. I believe i heard someone say specific artifacts work better with specific factions but i dont know how you can possibly tell. hell, i dont even know what they do! 

I'm not saying its a bad game. Alot of people like it, i may be a total idiot who doesnt understand. but i do see alot of poeple who like it, enjoyed it during its prime. and i just wasnt one of them. Unless you're familiar with the game, i honestly cant recommend it without feeling like a jackass.

Play as Life, Order, Chaos, Water, Fire, Earth or Air as you attempt to defeat the evil Balkoth and ensure the continuation of your people. You are a lord of magic, leading your faith in this challenging game. Once you win one game, you can play as Balkoth and destroy the world if you want.

The game is filled with all manner of creative artifacts (weapons, armor, rings, amulets, scrolls, and potions) for your Lord and Champions to utilize. There are all manner of dungeons to explore. Battles take place on a tactical map, whereby you can utilize your horsemen, archers, mages, and ground units strategically to help win the battle. Battles are real time, but the primary map is turn based. Production of units is instantaneous if you have the resources, but resource production is turn based. The resources in this game are gold, ale, magic crystals, and fame. Gold is primarily used for ranged units, ale for melee units, and crystals for magic units, of which there are all manner of magic creatures to call to your aid depending on your faith.

Beyond the base game, there are also several scenario games you can play. For example, play as the wizard Merlin looking for hte next king of camelot.

If you are a fan of either RPGs or strategy games, I can say with confidence that you will love this game. That is, supposing you are not one of those that has to see sweet graphics in order to be interested. I can tell you that the graphics actually were pretty sweet at the time this game came out. I've kept coming back to this game since I first got it in the late 90s, but now I finaly have a version that works better with new operating systems. Maybe if we get lucky, they will come out with a sequel someday. 

Impressions Games no longer exists, and Sierra, who first published this game, later was bought and became a subsidary of Vivendi, from which rebellion bought the rights to Lords of Magic prior to the Vivendi buyout by activision. So the chances are slim, but who knows, maybe rebellion will take some time away from sniper elite, or the newly made Sierra (re-established in 2014 by Activision) buys back the rights and makes one?

Lords of Magic was the first game I ever played as a child. Gifted to me on Christmas eve when I had just turned 9 years old, it was a game that stirred my interest for turn-based strategy.  I did not even understand the language, but I loved the graphics, sounds and especially the music. I played this game so much I ended up having to re-buy it twice due to breaking two of my CD’s.

Looking back at it 20 years later, I am amazed how far this game was ahead of its time compared to other games. While it may be clunky, slow and outdated by today’s standards, it poses a real challenge to even the most hardened veteran, and it’s systems are still complex and tricky to figure out. The game’s diplomacy system, while not terribly advanced, still allows you to be somewhat tactical by befriending other nations via the use of gifts and trades. The magic is very tricky, requiring you to research your spells before using them, but once you get going, magic becomes a terribly force on the battlefield, allowing you to wipe out entire armies with your wizard alone. This would be a problem if the game was named anything else than “Lords of Magic”, but with magic being such a central theme of the game, I am okay with it being as devastating as it is.

For all the love I have for this game, it can be terribly frustrating at times though. Even your toughest  units die so incredibly fast in battle. Saving them feels like a hopeless and sometimes monotonous task, and in order to succeed you HAVE to babysit your units like crazy until they start leveling up. Even at max level however, they usually do not last very long on the battlefield, but at least they have a fighting chance.

I also heavily dislike the auto-calculate feature that allows you to resolve battles with the click of a button, as it goes way too easy on the player, often tempting you to auto-calculate simply because the result is more desirable. I suggest not using this feature at all if you want to have a good experience with this game, unless it is to quickly get rid of a small, meaningless army that would otherwise not pose a threat to you.

20 years later, this game continues to captivate and amaze me. The music, graphics and sounds are timeless to me, and completely one-of-a-kind. If you enjoyed games like Heroes of Might and Magic as a kid, you will absolutely love Lords of Magic. I seriously recommend it!

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] The story of Lords of magic takes place in the land of Urak the whole land has been laid to ash by the sorcerer Balkoth. The rest of the explanation is left up to interpretation... You choose your class, and faction/faith and set out to save your people... or die again and again because there's so much in this game you didn't know about before, but each time you come back a little more prepared and understanding a bit more then before. [i](Did we get a bit too real? Let me explain...)[/i]

Truth be told, I don't know that I'm really qualified to speak about Lords of Magic because I didn't play it as a kid. and even now, I'll need to spend many more hours before I'm familiar enough that I might actually stand a chance while playing.
However, I did play the heck out of Lords of the Realm 2. So how different could a game made by the same developers be? ...turns out the difference could be astronomical. To me the only similarity is the music (A+ music btw, absolutely love it) and the battles.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Lets just start with the basic set up for a Lords of Magic Game [i](not a Legends of Urak, because that's basically a story of King Arthur)[/i] You first chose between three classes: Warrior, Mage, and Thief. Each class has it's own strengths weaknesses and class abilities.
Then you choose your faction or ""faith"". There are eight faiths; Life Death, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Order, and Chaos. [i](you can't choose death until you beat the game by the way.)[/i] Again, each faith is specialized in a certain ways and with certain types of units.

Then you jump into the game and let the complexity begin!

It's not actually THAT bad when you're first learning how to play. As long as you just accept that things are going to end badly for you. You don't even need to battle, you can just let the computer Auto Calculate the battle for you.

There's Fame (You can beg for gold, in exchange for fame, or horde fame and get more people who join your cause!), Followers (followers can be put to work, or used to recruit troops), Gold, Gem's (Gem's are a bit tricky, they're used for magic, be it healing your troops in the capital city, or summoning creatures and magic users, and lastly pints of ale (Just another currently, and if I learned anything in Lords of the Realm 2, it's one of the most important! who doesn't love a good 'ol drunk  jk).

Everything is turn based, so you can move a certain distance with your army, and then end turn to receive new resources. The battles are real time though. (So very similar to Lords of the Realm mechanically speaking)

Cons: you are not able to set screen resolution inside the game. So on my monitor, I end up with just a little window in the center of the screen that the game is in.

I'll admit, without the mod, it is clear which factions sucks completely and not very fun to play; however the mod basically balances it, adds new features to every unit, new artifacts and additional effects/tweaks to existing ones, making it much more viable to start with any champion you want on any difficulty.

I've been waiting for this moment since I was 11. Hot damn does it feel good.

Alright, so way back when I was a wee tadpole, my mom got me a Sierra Strategy Triple Pack for Christmas. Cyberstorm, Caesar II, and Rise of Rule of Empires was on it. It also had a demo for LoM and I wound up playing that far more than the other games. Problem was, I was 11 and couldn't just go out and buy my own games. My mom wasn't any help either. And thus, for all these years past, I was never able to sit down and give LoM a real try. So thank you Steam for giving me this.

LoM is a strategy game where the goal is to defeat Balkoth, the evil Lord of Death who is attempting at sinking the land of Urak into the dark clutches of a death god. To do this you must build your army, liberate your Great Temple from enemy clutches, and forge various alliances with the other elemental factions in the game (Air, Water, Order, Chaos, Fire, Light, Earth, and Death.) Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses so there's a ton of replayability depending on which you choose. Do you begin with a sturdy Warrior based Earth faction, strong in melee offense or do you start with a Thief based Light faction, excelling in ranged archery?

LoM seems a little overwhelming at first but it's actually quite simple as there are only so many variables to pay attention to. Your resources are limited to Crystals, Ale, Gold, and Fame, with each Faction having their own dependencies on one more than the other. These resources are used to fuel upkeep costs of units and for creating them. Liberating various locations such as gold mines, crystal mines, and breweries provide these resources each round. It's that simple. Once you learn the pacing for each faction, playing through the game is largely up to you. LoM can be incredibly short or incredibly long, depending on how effective you are and how much RNG loves you during your attempts. This is a game that is meant to be played many, many times so never feel like you're enbroiling yourself into a 100 hour campaign every time you start.

The downsides to the game lie mostly with the RNG: some attempts the AI takes a more even pace; others its on the juice, plowing straight through you. Nothing felt better than having Balkoth roll up into my capital within the first 30 turns. I died very quickly. Sometimes enemy units move in a logical fashion; another time, Balkoth sat over the ocean, mere pixels out of my range, for nearly 20 rounds just to spite me, unmoving. If the AI is feeling cruel, you can get steamrolled very quickly in this game. Just gotta hit New Game and start again...

I cannot express how happy I am that this game has held up after all of these years. A chapter of my life has finally been completed. If you're a fan of classic strategy, you'll find an immense amount of fun with LoM.",1481248754,1481248754,True,1,1,0.539776504039764404,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A bit like Masters of Magic, this is a dudes-on-a-map strategy game, where you balance realtime combat with resource management. You play one of seven faiths fighting against the forces of Death.  You recruit heroes (Warriors, Mages, and Thieves) which lead armies of fighters, archers, and magical creatures.  I had this game on CD-ROM so my steam hours don't reflect it, but you will get tons of hours out of this game.  One of the best parts:  once you master one particular faith (Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Life, Death, Order, or Chaos), playing another one is a whole different experience.  Once you beat the game once, it unlocks Death as a playable faith, which is a great challenge in itself. The Special Edition shipped with pre-rendered quest games (one hidden), which are a delight to play.  You also get more maps to play once you master the main one, and a map editor that allows you to create your own.

It's not without its flaws though.  The graphics did not age well, though the characters do have their charm.  The combat is wonky, and you have to really learn the system. . . at the beginning it will be overwhelming.  The AI isn't that bright, and I am not sure if the steam version ships with a very game breaking difficulty bug. . . but it hasn't showed up for me yet.  There are some ways you can really game the system too. If you're having alot of trouble pick Order, Water, or Life, and tinker with the hero editor.  If all else fails, play a Water mage with the Staff of Drowning, which is essentially a hidden 'very easy' mode.

I cannot do it justice, it's really a diamond. 
I've played it since the demo came out 19 years ago, and I played it yesterday.

Overall: 9/10
Game Length: Hours
Complexity: Moderate
Replay: Infinite

The music has that rare perfection, it is atmospheric, beautiful, and yet blends into the background and doesn't annoy on repeat (unlike say, Civilization I and II). The gameplay itself is fun, sensible, and keeps getting deeper the more one plays. While the rules are simple, they mingle to form complex situations. The AI is unexpected, good even by today's standards. There's tons of customization without it being overwhelming or senseless. It's endlessly replayable, every New Game plays out differently. Of course, you can always play as the main villain instead for a completely different experience, or one of the expansion Quests. There's even a complete map creator if you want more. You literally cannot run out of game to play.

Everything matters, from terrain, to spells, to flanking, to army movement, and so on, there is no aspect of the game that is 'useless' or ignorable. Now it is also likewise quite unforgiving, rarely is there a chance to take back a bad decision, it's not that any mistake will spell your doom, it's that one could. Getting yourself stuck in the zipper of imperial overreach is very much a possibility. This is a challenging game, and it does not have much tolerance for tactless blind charges, dumb is dead. It is however true, just as in real war, that sometimes a misstep could not be foreseen, or luck sides against you, and in a close battle that can be the difference that causes utter defeat. The game is only <mostly> fair, not completely fair. Even a solid victory can be Pyrrhic.

I've seen it said that the game is well balanced, or not at all. I disagree, I think it has that always-sought after and rare perfect imbalance. Yes, some Faiths are easier or harder for beginners, because their strengths are intuitive or obvious to implement. But each one can win consistently, they just use unconventional tactics, and come into their pinnacle at different stages. Like, Life infantry may be weak, but that's because they're not meant to fight, they're meant to Parry in full defense, holding the line while your archers eat up the enemy. The Air infantry make terrible infantry, because you should use them like cavalry instead. The best Fire spell harms all units on the battlefield, but Fire Mages and Elementals are resistant, making them the ideal sacrificial mercenary strike team to soften a powerful enemy army at low cost. Chaos Stickthrowers are generally mistaken to be the worst ranged units, but their attack speed is the quickest, so they lock down powerful enemy melee units if targeting it together as a group. There's always a useful method to be found. Not every Faith fights best in a traditional style, and often their true strengths are meta - such as economics, mobility, recovery, or synergy. However, the balance between preparation and tactics, skill and luck, quality vs quantity, those factors are superbly arranged.

Lords of Magic did have troubled development, it was a buggy mess that was beloved despite that, and the game wasn't completely fixed until support was discontinued. Steam offers the 3.01 version, however it retains one significant Unit ID bug that replaces Brownies (tiny weak scouts) in some low level battles with Pegasus Riders (absurdly strong late game tank). To that end I completely recommend the unofficial 3.02 patch, dedicated fans took development to the finish line, removing the last bugs and improving the menu and game interface. As always, use at your own discretion.

That said, the game shines, not for it's functional but dated graphics, but the fluff. Each and every of the 160+ spells has it's own story text, revealing the culture, legends, and life of the people of each Faith. Every dungeon has a serviceable description, that unveils a deeper moral ambiguity than you'd expect. Sure, some Paladin Lord of Order is expected to liberate a sacred statue from miscreants, but what of robbing and pillaging the estate of a wealthy ex-thief? It makes no difference mechanically, but it highlights that victory is at all costs. It clearly takes influence from the Lord of the Rings, but it absolutely makes up itself. Even the building quotes hint at a rich and full culture and history for each Faith. When it's cheesy it's homage to Conan the Barbarian, Tolkien, Beowulf, King Arthur, and other classics. Even the hefty manual is more narrative than tutorial. In short, more than anything, it's voluntarily immersive. It lets you care. It brings you in and makes it believable that there's a whole world.

It is truly not very good.

Problems with this game pop up at the very beginning, when you are selecting a type of Lord to rule your people.  This Lord takes the form of a powerful hero, but sadly not all are created equal.  As a matter of fact some are completely unviable, such as Fire and Air Warrior Lords.  These two in particular have such long parrying animations that if they become engaged with three or more enemies (which will happen often) they will spend all their time stuck in the parrying animation and be unable to strike back.  This results in their eventual death, regardless of how feeble the enemy is.

Combat itself is awkward, and usually quite boring.  The most exciting combat comes when you take a lone thief lord and spend the fight stealthing around to gradually kill off all your opponents.  Otherwise you can expect a slug-fest that will eventually resolve itself with little input needed from the player aside from perhaps sending your melee fighters to a choke point.  Note that managing units is generally unnecessary, as many Lords are sufficient to carry the game solo until the final battle.

There are cities which you can manage to a very shallow degree.  There are other ""Lords"", though they provide little challenge.  Most of the game revolves around delving into enemy infested lairs to gain valuable experience for the final confrontation with the Death Lord.  It is only at this point you will actually need an army, since the Death Lord uses an instant kill attack which has several charges.  You must keep your Lord away (death of your Lord is an instant game over unless you have recruited other Lords by freeing their temples before they were able to) and send an army in his stead... rather dissappointing for the climax.  I'd prefer being able to have my Lord lead my army for the final battle.

There are a few special scenarios you can play based on old legends, such as King Arthur or Beowulf.  These tend to be irritating rather than enjoyable, and ask you to jump through silly hoops to complete them.

Avoid this one.  It is nothing short of infuriating by today's standards.",1459781710,1464643606,False,5,2,0.383067488670349121,14,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:

+ Excellent blend of real time strategy, tactics rpg, and good old 4X empire building. If you like Civilization, Total War, or X-COM, this should float your boat.

+ The soundtrack is as classy and ambient as anything. You won't exactly be humming the tunes, but it's immersive and enchanting all the same and never makes you want to turn it off.

+ Each faction feels unique in some way with different strengths and weaknesses, but you're never really locked in to the faction you choose in the begining. Taking over villages and great temples gets you access to buldings, units, and abilities from other factions and you can mix and match them to suit your own strategy.

Cons:

- The game is locked into a really low resolution and would benefit from an HD release like Age of Empires 2 did.

- There's not so much a learning curve as there is a learning cliff that you must hurl yourself off of and build your wings before you hit the ground. You will lose your first few games and to people who only started playing games after 2001 or so, that may be a tad frustrating. This is a very old school game with a less than helpful tutorial system in the form of in-game pop-ups so the only way to learn how to play is by actually playing.

Small glimpse of the gameplay:
The gameplay actually has a ton of depth to it, with each of the 8 Faiths (the game's factions) having their own unique advantages and playstyle. The game does a very good job of explaining things as you go too. Strategy and management of resources and followers is key, but is simple and straightforward. One aspect I loved about this is that the amount of followers you gain is influenced by how much  positive Fame your actions have brought, and how many monuments you liberated from faithless Marauders. You can try to barter with other Faiths. The Thief champions can stealth, try to steal from other parties, spy on other Faiths, or even kidnap and interrogate other champions, Mages can research spells, and experienced champions can even “instruct” newly produced units so that they start out at a higher level… There's just sooo many things I could list but this review is already getting too long. :)",1455087806,1455087806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But, I see now that this game could be so much better. If Age of Empires II can get a huge graphics upgrade yet maintain its style, so can LOM. Honestly I would love a remake using the same gameplay mechanics, but with more diversity in what each unit can do and improve what thieves are capable of. And more LEGENDS OF URAK.

I remember trying my hardest to win and when I won for the first time I remember jumping up in my chair shouting, ""I won!"" Fun fact, I did that in a rolling chair, and I advise none of you to do that....lesson learned, but doesn't matter. I won! 

Anyways, now that it is on steam I had to pick it up and play it again...oh where did the hours go?

This is a game that I highly reccomend. Do not let the dated graphics fool you, this is a great game for those that understand the differences this game brings.

That said allow me to explain what makes this game different from other strategy games.

First off, you pick a leader type - warrior, mage, or thief(ranged/stealth unit) and then your goal is to first liberate your faith's great temple. Once you do that your people build a stronghold in your capital and followers join your cause. You use these followers to work for you to produce resources in capital city, upgrade buildings or build new ones (at a conquered village) or join your army. You then adventure accross the map encountering other places to explore for treasure and loot and eventually find other faiths that you can either fight or parley with, but your ultimate goal is to kill the lord of death. This is not easy as he no pushover. 

However, you can unite the other faiths in the land to serve you against the lord of death. If you liberate the great temple of another faith they will join you. Another feature I have to mention is that your champions, (the warrior, mage, and thief) can use their xp to train new troops. This means if you have, for example, a high level warrior you can leave them in a barracks and every turn it will share its knowledge with new recruits, and if the champion has enough experience to fully train new troops you can then train brand new soldiers to start at max level. Not only does this mean in late game you do not have to worry about leveling up all your troops, but if your warrior shared enough knowledge at the barracks to train up future warriors to start at lvl 7, it makes loosing that warrior in battle less of a loss because you do not have to get another one fresh at level 1. It is a great system.

All in all, the game runs very well still on my windows 8 os. There is major framerate loss and slowing down when the map is zoomed all the way out. 

Sound and music still sounds beautiful and the gameplay is still great.

For the current price you are getting a lot of content. There are eight playable faiths, that each play very differently with different units and spells, and advantages. This is a game where I would not say there are weak factions/faiths. They are all really powerful in their own right. For example it is said if you enrage the worshippers of water you better travel by land or air... The water faiths has the best ships and can summon serpants and krakens, but lack extremly powerful land units. The fire faith on the other hand has some really powerful and destructive magic spells, but....well lets just say their naval ships suck...like a lot. That is what I got to love about the game, every faith you can play as has an amazing pick of advantages, but all come with a huge negative you have to overcome and work around.

There are only a few large maps to play on, but don't worry, it is kind of like a football game or a game of league of legands. You can keep playing on the same map and it is still be fun. Honestly, having played the game so much as a kid and a lot lately I am still, just now, letting myself finially try another map that came with the game. These maps are large. If you do desire more maps don't worry. A map editor is also included and you get to play the legends of Urak which allows you to pick a faith and go on a legendary adventure. These change the rules of the game and make it more like an rpg adventure as opposed to grand strategy. These are story-rich with a fair bit of voice acting and videos.  
Again, a wealth of content and replayablity for the price.

Furthermore the higher difficulty settings still feel fair. I have played my last several games at the hardest difficulty setting and I feel and enjoy that wonderful sense of challange while having never felt like the enemy is cheating. This isn't a game that just simply has the enemy cheating, but rather makes them play smarter. As a vetern of this game every smart move the enemy made, or the amount of resources and units they had seemed, to me, easy to understand how they achieved that. It is wonderful when a game makes the higher difficulties fun without having the AI cheat. Again, every massive army of the enemy or amount of area they control has never felt unreasonable to me, as a veteran, and I could tell myself how they were able to achieve that. It is hard, but a fair hard if that makes any sense.

In closing, this was and still is, one of my favorite strategy games and I am so pleased to see it brought to steam where it will once again work on my pc. I love it and couldn't reccomend it more. If you are okay with the differences this game has that I described, give it a go.

Extended Review:

Starting off this game gives you two options: The standard gameplay and the campaign. 
In the standard mode, you are given the choice of playing as a warrior, thief or mage as a main hero.
Then you are given 8 factions to choose from: Death, Air, Order, Fire, Light, Earth, Chaos and Water. 
Initially, you can only choose 7 untill you kill balkoth who is the leader of death. 

Once you pick a faction, you get to choose the difficulty, name your hero and customize further if you want.
Each faction has a total of 6 buildings. 
1. The Capitol, where you trade resources and put your followers to work.
2. Wizard building- you get to train mage heros and typically magic units.
3.Wizard tower- Here you can place mages to research spells.
4. Thief building- Here you can train thief heroes and ranged units.
5, Warrior building- Here you can train warrior heroes and similar units.
6. Faction type building *IMPORTANT*- Capturing this will give you control of your capitol, increase your benefit in trading and let you assign followers. After capturing this, you will receive followers every 7 turns.  This building also lets you build another building next to it with various effects across factions.  This also lets you build one legendary unit.

Here are your resources
1. Fame
2. Ale
3. Followers -Important if you want to train a unit instead of hiring a mercenary/ used to produce resources at capitol
4. Crystals - Important for healing units, in the capitol, click on the temple to do so. 
5. Gold

There are a bunch of random places you can travel to on the map.  This can be anywhere from a hut, to a brewery, to a crystal place, to a mine and much more.  
Usually a level 2 Brewery will provide 2 ale/turn, lv 3 brewery 3 ale/turn so long as you control it.

The goal is to kill balkoth or rule the world, whichever you decide. 
You get to make allies and trade buildings/units/rescources

You level up your units, they can die permanently. You get relics that you can equipt on heroes. IF YOUR STARTING HERO DIES YOU LOSE. 

Cons-
It's an old game, the graphics are terrible. 
It crashes every now and then so save often!

Conclusion-
It's a very good game, alot of fun, definitely made in a time where the gameplay was more important than the visuals itself. Although the game does tend to crash and that does destroy the immersion.. The gameplay is far superior and helps shed a blind eye towards it.  For $2.50/ $5.00 Its totally worth it.  I would totally reccomend this game any day regardless of its cons.

I'm too tired to keep writing/reviewing.  Just buy the game and enjoy :) I'll update this eventually.",1453179204,1453179204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Lords of Magic is a turn based strategy game that has an interesting mix of real time strategy for the battle environment.  There are 8 Faiths (ie races) in the game, and you pick to play as lord of one of them.  At the start, your main objective is to stop the Lord of Death as he seeks to subjugate (or just destroy) all else that will not obey him.  You can choose to be that of the Elves of Life with essentially the best archer units, or perhaps those of Order who are essentially the heroes of Arthurian legends, or any other Faith.

I've liked this game a lot because of how you can work with the other Faiths.  Say you're leading Life and liberate the Great Temple of Water (each Faith has one), they'll agree to join you (provided you're still on good relations) and their Lord will be come your heir.  So you essentially have two ""lives"" to work with while building up both regions.  You can still trade for resources, units, or research in other games but I always found that kind of alliance interesting about this game.

The RTS battles are more fun for me than the mass army battles.  In this game your army has a max of 12 ""units"" in 3 squads.  Each squad is composed of a hero/champion/unique unit and 3 generic units (footman, archer, calvary, scout, or summoned creature) and you can mix and match these as you like.  In battle, instead of having a host of units to macromanage you only have that small squad to micromanage long set paths in the various maps (some are open areas while others have corridors to bottleneck).  I've found that to be far more engaging.

The research aspect is only about the spells you have at your disposal.  If you don't use mages at all, then you actually don't even need to worry about the research (which is composed entirely of having a few mages in a building and waiting the number of turns needed based on the levels of the mages).

The other interesting part of this title (that they fortunately included) is the Legends of Urak quest pack.  Ever wanted to play out the story of King Arthur?  They have one for that.  What about Beowulf?  They have one for that too.  There are a couple other legends you play out the story off and it's adapted to the units and systems they have ingame which puts an interesting twist to it.  

I'll definitely be putting more time into this now othat I have it again.  Who knows...maybe I'll crush everything as Balkoth as I unlocked him with a bit of a speedrun I developed (check my guide if you're interested).  Or perhaps I'll slowplay it again as Life like I did when I first played the game.  Then again, playing out as King Arthur would be fun again too.  I remember that took me awhile, but perhaps I can do it quicker this time too.

I realize this is a long review/diatribe but if you're a fan of simplistic land management blended with squad based real time strategy combat then I think this would be a title for you!

EDIT: The only bad thing I guess is that they didn't add an ability to play windowed, or work in the Steam overlay.  It plays just like it did when I first enjoyed it though...so there is that. ;)",1451284044,1451284202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pour situer le contexte, l'histoire se déroule sur Urak , Terre où cohabitent plusieurs cultes antagonistes adeptes de la magie. 

Cultes antagonistes: 

- Culte de l'Air ( Pixies)  et culte de la Terre ( Nains)

- Culte de l'Eau ( reptiles)  et culte du Feu ( guerriers des flammes)

- Culte du Chaos ( barbares) et culte de l'Ordre (Soldats en armure)

-Culte de la Vie ( Haut Elfes)  et culte de la Mort (elfes Noirs)

Afin de répandre la Mort , le puissant dieu de la Mort , Morgoth , invoqua un sorcier maléfique qui se nomme Balkoth et lui fabriqua un artefact afin que ce Chef de guerre répande la Mort partout où il foulera le sol.

Le but est de vaince Balkoth ( si vous dirigez un culte différent du culte de la Mort) : c'est un Sorcier nécromancien qui chevauche un destrier volant ( sorte de chauve-souris géante). 

Afin de le vaincre vous devez libérer la cathédrale de votre culte et des cultes amis afin de pouvoir obtenier des disciples chaque semaine ( 1 semaine = 7 tours).

Mais aussi , vous pouvez améliorer vos relations diplomatiques avec les autres cultes en echangeant des unités militaires, ou ressources . Vous pouvez après avoir amélioré vos relations libérer les cathédrales des cultes ""amis"" afin que le dirigeant de cette faction rejoigne votre camp et ce si votre chef de faction est mort , il le remplacera comme héritier.

Si vous controlez Balkoth ( culte de la Mort) votre but est de vaincre tous les autres cultes jusqu'au dernier.


Plusieurs types de chef de faction et de champions existent: 

- les Guerriers ( très bien protégés et mus à l'art du combat au corps à corps) 

- Les Mages ( champions qui maitrisent l'art de la magie d'attaque et du support aux unités militaires) : chaque faction a ses sorts propres

- Les Voleurs ( champions qui maitrisent l'art de la discrétion , souvent utilisés pour espionner , faire de la reconnaissance , ou voler des ressources à des unités militaires d'un type différent du voleur. Ces champions maitrisent l'art de l'attaque à distance)

Une fois la cathédrale libérée, vous pouvez améliorer les batiments près de votre capitale mais aussi améliorer celle-ci afin de pouvoir auugmenter vos capacités de formation de vos futures unités par des héros ayant une forte expérience de combat/vol. 
Vous avez aussi la possibilité d'apprendre des sortilègess dans la tour des mages et d'invoquer des créatures ( sans expérience).  1 Emplacement de mage en formation par niveau de tour des mages ( 3 max).

Une fois la tour des mages au niveau 3 vous avez la possibilité d'invoquer via le batiment spécial ( que vous pouvez construire via la Cathédrale du culte) une créature légendaire qui combattra à vos cotés ( 1 créature légendaire max ).

Ce jeu est excellent pour les amateurs de stratégie en tour par tour avec une gestion des sorts.

Now for the review part.

The graphics have not aged well. This was designed for Win 98 if I remember correctly. One thing with more powerfull setups the loding times are next to none so that is great.
Still, the graphics are ""acceptable"" for a game this old.

This plays like an RTS style on the overland map and Real Time Combat for the encounters.

The first few levels can be brutal, specially on harder difficulties. And there is some grinding involving.

If you are new to this game I recommend picking up the Lif faiths since in my opinion is the easiest to start with.


The is a game breaking bug wich spawns a Pegasus for Chaos lvl1 encounters making this faith completly unplayable.
Also, on the custom settings, you can pick up OP artifacts like Staff of Drowning for water mages and a Sword (I don't remember the name) for the Palading Lord, making the game much more easy.


Still, the coombat is fun with some mechanics like Thief's stealth and Warrior parry.


It takes quite a while to complete a full game on the normal map and the Legends of Urak questlines are quite difficult for new players.

Lords of Magic is a classic game from the 90's, overshadowed by bigger titles such as Heroes of Might and Magic, King's Quest, Quest for Glory, and Baldur's Gate. It is a mix of strategy and RPG - you create armies that explore the world map, collecting resources, traversing dungeons and fighting neutral monsters/enemy factions to level up.

The game takes place in the high fantasy realm of Urak. Balkoth, the loyal discple of Golgoth, the god of Death, has gone on a rampage throughoutt the world, ravaging the kingdoms of the other seven faiths - Life, Order, Chaos, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. You pick one of the seven mentioned faiths and choose what role your Lord will be - Warrior, Thief or Mage.

When you enter the world, you will discover that you only have your Lord and a small army accompanying him/her. Every faith starts off in a weakened state, except for death and the faith ""opposite"" to yours (for example, Order's opposite is Chaos). Your first objective is to explore the area around your faith's capital, fighting neutral enemies and gaining strength. Once you are strong enough, you will need to take your faith's ""Great Temple"", which has been overrun with monsters. After you do that, your capital will swear fealty to you, and you will begin your quest to kill Balkoth.

Each faith has its own unique units, and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Life has some of the best ranged units in the game, with strong magical flying units. However, they have weaker melee units. Fire has units with very high attack, but low defense, and many of their units have low movement points.

The game does have some flaws, however. Combat has a tendency to be a bit clunky at times. The learning curve for the game, in my opinion, is very high. Finally, computer players will act oddly. For starters, they will often split their armies into tiny, easily defeatable groups. Secondly, there's diplomacy - the AI doesn't understand what a fair bargain is. Playing as Air, I once had Order ask me to give them my Air Drake (the legendary creature for Air) in exchange for a hound (an Order scouting unit). When I declined, my relations with them DROPPED because they were pissed off with me.

All in all, I find this to be a very enjoyable game, albeit with a few flaws. It is a solid 8/10.",1449825002,1449825002,True,17,0,0.638568460941314697,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Most each faith also has its own race but multiple faiths have humans, elves and giants to name a few. The main game consist of a sprawling map of land divided into 8 kingdoms with numerous neutral castles, fortresses, villages and simple caves to conquer for XP and resources. In addition each faith has a whole library of spells unique to them.

Here we have a RPG strategy with RTS elements staring us in the face, and it has been staring us in the face since 1996. The DOOM players overlooked it and the Diablo players were so blinded by Blizzard's genius that Lords of Magic was thrown to the wayside, never looked upon again until now.

Here we have one of the greatest video games in the past hundred years. A true diamond in the rough in which all visions of modernity have built upon and supposedly improved upon but they fall short of its greatness.

I was 12 then and I still think the gfx are pretty good. That was the main reason why I shelled out $40 at the time, not knowing that it would end up being one of my favorite games of all times for other reasons too. Namely the excellent soundtrack, 3D world map that makes for interesting exploration (even though originally there was only 1 map in the game), immersive diplomacy, good thief abilities for spying on or stealing from the enemy (also it's fun decimating weaker enemies with just 1 thief as they can ""hide in the shadows"") and a ton of spells that I never even got around to trying most of. Many artifacts to find for the champions, although it's often annoying to not be able to use them as they are often faith dependent. The combat system is clunky and somewhat tedious but basically strategic with missile units and mages usually doing most of the damage. It is often simple to trick the computer by having it chase one of your melee units around while you fire on them with missiles, and the enemy doesn't evade well if at all. I suppose you could have an army of mostly melee units, but you'd better find the best ones in the game because most of them are pretty weak. The redeeming aspect of battles is the rpg-like element of experience points that levels most units (not all) up to 5, and champions much higher.

I always preferred playing as the Life faith, and it may be the easiest one to start with as they have the best missile units (archers) in the game. A tip would be to free your great temple as soon as possible (before the first 7th day) in order to start gaining followers for gathering resources and creating new units. New followers arrive to your empire every 7 days, depending on how much ""Fame"" you have gained.

I really hope they fix the ""Pegasus bug"" as I have already run across 3 of these level 8 creatures and it takes an entire army with my best champions to take one down, usually losing a couple units in the process. Not neccesarily a bad thing as it adds challenge, but I really don't think a level 2 hamlet is supposed to spawn this creature.

I really really hope they make a Lords of Magic II, or at least an HD update for this game!",1449363068,1449363068,True,25,0,0.689222872257232666,1,True,False,False,False,,,

When you start a new game you can choose to be a warrior, mage or thief and then you can choose to be any of the eight elements, give you 24 fairly distinct hero variations you can try out. Once you have chosen you will appear on the main game map where you can see various buildings and places to interact with, where you will find monsters to defeat, giving you the ability to summon creatures to aid you, hire more troops that can gain experience with you, wizard towars research new spells, towns where you can direct the locals to work in certain industries to increase your income of the various resources in the game (fame, gems, ale, etc), so you can support larger and better armies, and also other heroes to aid you in your quest.

You can also find a number of artifacts which give many different bonuses to your heroes (or not as some you will find will only be useful for classes/elements you can't currently recruit). You can conquer the town/temple of other elements which will allow you to hire more heroes of that element to aid you in your quest.

The one area I always found weakest in the game is the combat - it is played in pausable real time (one of the main ways it differs from early Heroes of Might and Magic titles), and while okay it largely reduces to just everyone attacking each other in a big blob (apart from the missile/spell casters). It never felt very strategic or interesting, and I always tend to autocalc whenever I can get away with it, as you end up having a lot of fights during a campaign.

Overall this is a fun title, if very old and creaky, but it does guide you along a bit at the start of the game, although there isn't a huge amount of hand holding here unlike most modern titles. The user interface is okay if a bit cryptic, but it flows fairly well if you are willing to work with it, so overall I would recommend even to people new to it if the overall theme interests them, and the feel and flow of the game are different enough to HoMaM that fans of that series will probably like it, as it is different enough to not feel like an older and harder to use entry in that series, while still being in the same ballpark in terms of overall gameplay.",1449252938,1449252949,True,78,0,0.859793365001678467,0,True,False,False,False,,,
