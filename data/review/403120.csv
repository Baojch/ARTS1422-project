More opportunities to have children, more chances to buy a home and not being forced to pay for the wedding gift as you have to in Game of Life 2.  One of the biggest complaints both my fiance and I have (since we own both Game of Life titles and play all the time) is a lack of DLCs in the original.  Why Marmalade decided to forgo new maps is beyond me.  In Game of Life 2 there are several you can get (though the action cards are just a rinse and repeat never changing based on themes), and frankly is the reason Game of Life falls short.

One area that's never been fixed and probably never will are the achievements.  Having more than 5 kids is one that is broken (I've had 6 kids as has my fiance) and never got the achievement.  It's sad that Marmalade won't fix that, but being the game is from 2015 (9 years old now) with a sequel getting all the attention to updates, it's just gotta be dealt with.

I've read comments on Game of Life (before I made the purchase) where people whined about being forced into marriage, well it is only a game and not REAL life folks.  When you play a game then equate it to what you don't want in the real world is rather silly.  It is just a game.  Those of us that love the aspect of getting hitched and having a family Game of Life really taps in to that.

Having never played the original 70s and 80s table top (ironically I'm a Gen X'er and this was on my radar), I'm not sure how much license Marmalade took from the original Milton-Bradly game (in terms of layout, action cards, and various stop points).

This game does have a lot of re-playability (base this on at least 2 to 3 games a night my fiance and I enjoy playing) it is a great throwback to our childhoods, and it's very family friendly (as it should ALWAYS remain), and you actually can have different results (though being a film star or musician in the game is the best for my fiance and I plus having a lot kids).

Despite the issues I and my fiance have with Game of Life, we still enjoy it and recommend it.",1710707414,1710707414,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's about as simple as the board game and not an ounce more. I would have loved more game modes or mechanics, there are a few neat artistic touches like having your piece wear the clothes of your occupation or driving a scooter before you marry but other than that the board is quite uninteresting. The game is held back by lacking simple features like windowed mode but other than that it's unremarkable. Don't expect anything more than what you get Wal-Mart or Toys 'R Us.

Personally I didn't liked this version, the graphics are bad, mediocre at best. Which for a game released in 2015 could have been so much better. They tried to make it interesting with the animations, however those get boring after a while and cannot be skipped.

The cards you get are random, which is fine. However if you get the same card 5 times in a single game... I don't know. I expected more of this. The only reason why I made it to 7 hours in all those years is to get all the achievements. That is also why I wouldn't recommend this game.

1: Going for the lowest spin throughout the whole game will yield more cards and sometimes can be an extra benefit when trying to get babies or properties

2: Make sure to be careful using this method while on the risky road

This method works probably the best, since players may not always have money to buy good properties or become unlucky because an opponent screwed them over, babies are only worth 50k each and your luck could be ♥♥♥♥ if you try selling a high value property and get less than you anticipated",1700838025,1700838025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es ist die Digitale Version des Brettspiel Klassikers ""Das Spiel des Lebens"". Was soll man Groß sagen, jeder kennt es wahrscheinlich noch aus seiner/ihrer Kindheit. Man kann das Spiel mit bis zu 4 Spielern gleichzeitig an einem PC spielen oder man nutzt die Remote Play Together Funktion wo nur einer das Spiel braucht und andere Spieler Online einladen kann zum spielen. Man kann natürlich auch gegen KI spielen die auch recht ordentlich spielen. Es gibt 2 Spielmodi. Einmal den Normalen Vollmodus wo man, wie beim Brettspiel alles durchlebt (Job finden, studieren, heiraten, kinder bekommen, in Rente gehen). Dann gibt es den Schnellmodus wo am Anfang eine Siegesbedingung festgelegt wird z.B. 5 Ereignis Karten sammeln oder als erster ein Haus kaufen. Auf dem Spielbrett befinden sich neben den Ereignis Feldern, welche dem Spieler entweder Geld geben oder Geld abnehmen auch Minispielfelder. Es gibt aber leider nur 2. Diese sind super kurz & simpel, einmal muss man durch wiederholtes klicken sich an eine Wache anschleichen ohne gesehen zu werden und beim anderen muss man sich hin & her bewegen um Geld einzusammeln und Schuldscheine ausweichen. Musik ist passend und die Grafik ist für so eine Art Spiel ordentlich

[h1] Achievement Schwierigkeit 2/10 [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 10 Erfolge. Diese sind sehr simpel gehalten. Man muss einfach beide Spielmodi jeweils 1 mal gewinnen, den Vollmodus mit mehr als 5 Kindern gewinnen, beide Minispiele gewinnen ohne Fehler zu machen (Nicht erwischt werden & keine Schuldscheine aufsammeln), ein Haus kaufen und wieder verkaufen, 100 mal die Scheibe drehen & gewinnen mit 150 Millionen Geld auf dem Konto. Die meisten bekommt man beim spielen eh automatisch

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Nett für zwischendurch
+ Familienfreundlich
+ Grafik ist OK
+ Musik ist Passend
+ Remote Play Together Funktion
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Eine durchaus gelungene Umsetzung des Brettspiel Klassikers. Wer das Brettspiel mag und eine Digitale Fassung davon möchte, kann hier ruhig zuschlagen. Es ist ganz nett für ein paar Runden zwischendurch mit Freunden oder Familie. Ich kann es auf jeden Fall Empfehlen

Bewertung: ★★★★☆

The Game of Life ist eine digitale Version des beliebten Brettspiels, das die Spieler auf eine Reise durch das Leben mitnimmt. Mit seiner einfachen Spielmechanik, den nostalgischen Elementen und dem spaßigen Wettbewerb bietet The Game of Life ein unterhaltsames Spielerlebnis für Jung und Alt. Das Spiel verdient eine solide Vier-Sterne-Bewertung.

Ein herausragendes Merkmal von The Game of Life ist die Nostalgie, die es hervorruft. Das Spiel erinnert an die traditionellen Brettspielrunden, die man mit Familie und Freunden verbracht hat. Die bunten Spielbretter, die kleinen Spielfiguren und die detaillierten Ereigniskarten lassen Erinnerungen an vergangene Zeiten wach werden und vermitteln ein warmes Gefühl der Vertrautheit.

Die Spielmechanik von The Game of Life ist einfach zu erlernen und bietet den Spielern eine Reihe von Entscheidungen, die ihre Reise durch das Leben beeinflussen. Spieler wählen Karrieren, treffen finanzielle Entscheidungen, gründen Familien und erleben verschiedene Lebensereignisse. Das Spiel bietet auch verschiedene Ziele, wie das Erreichen eines bestimmten Vermögens oder die Gründung einer glücklichen Familie.

Die Interaktion zwischen den Spielern ist ein weiterer Höhepunkt von The Game of Life. Spieler können sich gegenseitig herausfordern, um Vorteile zu erlangen oder ihre Konkurrenten zu behindern. Dies sorgt für einen spaßigen Wettbewerb und eine unterhaltsame Dynamik während des Spiels.

Eine mögliche Schwäche von The Game of Life liegt in der begrenzten langfristigen Wiederspielbarkeit. Nach einigen Durchgängen kann das Spiel eine gewisse Vorhersehbarkeit entwickeln, da die Ereignisse und Entscheidungen ähnlich bleiben. Dies könnte dazu führen, dass erfahrene Spieler nach mehr Abwechslung und Herausforderung suchen.

Eine weitere potenzielle Herausforderung ist die Abhängigkeit des Spiels von Glück und Zufall. Manchmal können Spieler durch unglückliche Ereignisse oder Würfelwürfe benachteiligt werden, was zu Frustration führen kann. Dies kann das Spielerlebnis etwas frustrierend machen, insbesondere für diejenigen, die gerne mehr strategische Entscheidungen treffen möchten.

Insgesamt bietet The Game of Life eine unterhaltsame und nostalgische Erfahrung, die Erinnerungen an klassische Brettspielrunden weckt. Die einfache Spielmechanik, die Interaktion zwischen den Spielern und die Nostalgie machen das Spiel zu einer guten Wahl für Familien und Gelegenheitsspieler. Obwohl die langfristige Wiederspielbarkeit begrenzt sein kann und das Spiel stark vom Glück abhängt, verdient The Game of Life eine solide Vier-Sterne-Bewertung für sein nostalgisches und spaßiges Spielerlebnis.",1688469051,1688469051,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

""Das Spiel des Lebens"" kennen sicher viele. Es gehört wahrscheinlich neben ""Monopoly"" und ""Mensch ärgere Dich nicht"" zu den Spielen, die man irgendwann in der Kindheit mal mit der Familie gespielt hat, zu Weihnachten oder bei einem Geburtstag. 

Leider gehören diese Spiele heute noch zu dem, an das man denkt, wenn man an Brettspiele denkt. Dabei gibt es so viel bessere Titel als diese mechanischen Krücken der Frühzeit der Brettspiele.

Denn das ""Spiel des Lebens"" stammt aus dem Jahre 1960. Und das merkt man an allen Ecken und Enden. Nicht ohne Grund gehört das ""Spiel des Lebens"" auf der Wertungs- und Archiv-Plattform für Brettspiele boardgamegeek zu den schlechtbewertetsten Spielen aller Zeiten. Es steht auf Platz 24552 von 24559. Und das völlig zu recht. 

Spielmechanisch ist das ""Spiel des Lebens"" eine einzige Katastrophe. So ziemlich alles basiert auf reinem Würfelglück. Die Entscheidungen des Spielers spielen mechanisch keine Rolle. Zudem können Spieler weit vor anderen schon das Spielende erreicht haben. 

Aber worum gehts eigentlich. Wir bewegen uns mit dem altertümlichsten aller Mechanismen Roll & Move vorwärts und haben den Anschein von Entscheidungen. Wir erwürfeln ein Leben. Auf dem Weg machen wir eine Ausbildung oder gehen auf die Uni, heiraten, bekommen Kinder, kaufen Häuser und erreichen irgendwann unseren Alterswohnsitz. Gewonnen hat im Endeffekt der, der am meisten Kohle gescheffelt hat.  

Dummerweise können wir das alles aber so gut wie gar nicht beeinflussen. Und da kommt dann immer das Argument: das ist halt ein Familienspiel, das ist so glückslastig, damit auch die Kinder und Oma gewinnen können. Und das ist theoretisch ein gutes Argument. Allerdings gibt es inzwischen so unfaßbar viele Familienspiele, die dieses Kriterium erfüllen und praktisch alle sind deutlich besser als ""Das Spiel des Lebens"". 

Die digitale Umsetzung funktioniert zwar, ist aber auch nicht wirklich gelungen. Alberne Cutscenes und ein unübersichtliches Spielbrett beschneiden deutlich das Spielgefühl.

Das einzig tendenziell Positive ist die Integration von kleinen Mini-Spielen, die etwas Abwechslung bieten, im Endeffekt aber für den Spielverlauf ziemlich irrelevant sind. 

Eine schwache Digital-Umsetzung eines grottigen Brettspiel-Pseudo-Klassikers. Muß man sich nicht wirklich antun.

I mean, it's a video game version of a board game, can you really complain too much about it? I wouldn't think so. It plays fine, the visuals are nice and there's nothing I can see that's affected in anyway that would say this game isn't worth it.

This is basically just a digital recreation of your favorite childhood game. Not much more and not much less. 

There are a couple small interface issues, like for example sometime a card pops up for a few seconds and before you've figured out what the card even says you are being asked to select another player to apply the card to.... now I don't know if this card is going to take money away from them or pay them money becasue I can't actually see the card when slecting another player. So the two obvious solutions are to either make you select the card to continue so at least you have a chance to read it or acknowledge it before selecting another player or leave the card visible when selecting another player. But neither is an option here. 

There are lots of minor things like this, or at another point I was suddenly playing as a different color player than the one I started as and I had no idea when or why that happened. Did I miss a card, did i select a hot key, was it a glitch... why am I now spinning for yellow rather than green which I have played the whole game? Still no clue. 

It feels like there are some actions which take way too many clicks while others fly by with no interaction and seem to have a huge effect on the game. So you see arbitrary things like every round I am just handed 20k for no reason I can fathom, not related to salary, no card I saw ever mentions why this is happening, it just starts happening. 

It's also not always obvious what the life paths mean, it's easily been 10 years since I played this game on a game board so something like go to night school, I only had a vague memory of what that actually did. Is this path longer, how much longer? Does that mean I select a new job, does it mean I can keep my current job if I don't like the new job options or no? There is no description for these life paths so you have to rely on your memory of when you played on a physical game board or make assumptions about what each life path actually means. It seems like almost no work to just add a basic description to these paths but for some reason the designers chose not to? This game is filled with little quality of life problems like this that make it seem a little lazy and reliant on you remembering the physical board game. 

It would also be really nice to speed up other Computer generated players. If you are only playing against a computer I shouldn't have to wait for the full round of 3 separate players and all their spins to play out in real time, offer a skip button or increase the speed a bit. 

Overall it's a fun nostalgic time killer especially at the $2 sale price I bought it at. That being said I probably would not pay more than $5 for this game. But under that price point, it's a fun little time killer.",1635103712,1635104377,True,9,0,0.61922001838684082,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Гра на декілька партій. Під час першої ви весело читаєте написи на картках, обираєте кар'єру, будинок і родину, виходячи з власних поглядів на життя. Не до кінця розуміючи, яка різниця між будинком для пенсіонерів і особняком мільйонера, закінчуєте першу партію, і в принципі, на стадії підрахунку очок, вже знаєте про цю гру все.
Починаючи з наступної, гру може освіжити лише людина, яка ще не грала в неї. Якщо такої немає, то гра перетворюється в змагання ""хто викине менше число"", бо оптимальні маршрути і вибори вже давно відомі.

Не можу порівняти з настільною версією, але дуже сподіваюся, що оригінал складніший, і має більш варіативні механіки. Реалізацію ""The game of life "" для Steam сильно похвалити не можу, на пару разів для компанії згодиться, але не більше.

P.S. Якщо ви, як і я, зацікавилися порівняно незначним числом ігрових досягнень, і задумалися, чому за десяток партій жодного разу не зіграли в міні-ігри, майте на увазі, що вони відкриваються тільки в режимі гри ""один гравець + боти"", коли фішка одного з гравців (не важливо, бот чи ні) зупиняється на колесі фортуни.

Когда то расскажу историю, у меня был обычный Simbian. Установив кучу игр, я однажды запустил игру ""Game of Life"". Думал будет что то не очень. Но игра меня увлекла что я играл раз 20 и каждый раз выбирал новую профессию и другие варианты развития событий. Ну как вы уже поняли я решил написать отзыв, чтобы познакомить вас с данной игрой.

Как вы уже поняли игра про ""жизнь"". Но не думайте что всё будет так просто и я сразу расскажу поднаготную отзыва. *Хм, может поэтому у меня так мало просмотров*. А хотя знаете что давайте не тянуть, все таки вам интересны не ""буковки"" а сама игра.

Итак у вас есть сразу выбор: либо пойти в колледж и заплатить за обучение 100 000 долларов( да да много) либо сразу начать карьеру и бесплатно крутить волчонок. Дам совет. Если выбрать колледж и пройти его до конца то зарплата и работа будет лучше чем если начать карьеру.

Следующий момент это игра либо с ИИ либо с друзьями. Конечно интересно играть с друзьями но увы можно только с одного компьютера. И вот так выглядит в основном игра.
Я красный и как видите начал только свой путь. Внизу есть три игрока с которыми мне предстоит сражаться. Но не думайте что тут задача как в настольной игре быть первым. Нет, тут задачаа набрать как можно больше денег или завести детей.

*Дорогая я дома или у нас ад в семье*

Да да, тут можно заводить детей, играть свадьбу, покупать дома и машины и конечно же уходить на пенсию. Каждый путь будет прокладывать парень на мотоцикле и вам остается только крутить ""барабан"" и ждать пока ваши соперники походят. Но не думайте что все так легко. Ведь иногда будут рандомные события, которые будут вас злить.
Например тут вы видите что мне придется заплатить 50 000 долларов за бассейн. Ну скажем так это может принести и плюс, но денег лишитесь. Кроме того будут события где нужно будет выбирать или например показ фильма. В таком случае каждый крутит барабан и у кого выпадет большое число заберет деньги или приз.

В целом ваша задача простая: крутишь барабан, смотришь за доской, принимаешь решение, и выбираешь для себя профессию и дома. В остальном напоминает Монополию, только тут уклон в реальную жизнь.

Жаль что это фантастика, и в реальной жизни увы так не работает. Ну или в СНГ просторе.

Я же поставлю игре 4 балла из 10 . Спасибо за внимание, и за прочтение отзыва. Напоминаю, мнение автора, может не совпадать с мнением других.

Pros
+ Simple to learn
+ Nice graphics, presentation
+ Randomized events & luck-based elements make no two games the same
+ Skill based minigames add variety
+ Great for all ages

Cons
- After a couple games it can become repetitive
- Viewing the board is awkward, can only be done at start of turn, and can't change angle
- Minigames are great, but two is too few
- The AI is too easy to beat in minigames
- You need a lot of luck to pull off 6+ children achievement

The game is simple: Pick a career, roll the spinner, and make a series of choices along the way (paths, home purchase/sale, re-roll career, try to have children). Ultimately, though, your success or failure will be up to chance. There is a mild element of strategy here if you play against other people, since your final score is the sum of a number of choices you can make.

Fans of the board game will appreciate this digital upgrade, and the ability to play with friends or relatives online. If you're looking for wholesome entertainment for children, this is a great pick.

Achievement Hunters: Pretty easy to 100%, but note the following: First, only the host credits achievement unlocks. Even if you play a local game, 1P must meet the requirements to earn it. Second, the children achievement requires 6 or more (""over 5""), and this is very RNG dependent. Look at the board tiles and restart if you don't have it after you pass all chances to add children. All achievements can be unlocked in solo play. For fastest time, only add one AI opponent. Good luck!

 *No começo o jogo é bem legal (se você jogar com seus amigos), com varias coisas pra fazer, mas por ser um jogo de tabuleiro que não tem muita coisa diferente pra fazer, enjoa muito fácil, e o jogo não recebe atualizações a MUITO tempo, então depois de um tempo fica chato, eu sei que lançou uma sequencia mas não joguei ainda.

 *Além disso o modo online está totalmente vazio, você pode ficar o dia inteiro procurando uma partida, mas não vai encontrar nenhuma, então ou você joga com seus amigos ou com os bots.

 *Só existe dois modos de jogo, sendo que o segundo é só uma variação do primeiro que deixa ele ainda mais curto, colocando um objetivo bem fácil pra ser completado.

Conclusão: não é tão ruim, mas a falta de conteúdo estraga o jogo, se você ver uma boa promoção (no mínimo 60%) talvez valha a pena comprar o jogo.

Die Lücke wurde nun dank dieser Neufassung gefüllt. Ein spaßiges Brettspiel, das aber trotzdem nicht 100%ig perfekt ist:

+ ein quietschbunt gestaltetes Spielbrett, auf dem es viele Details zu entdecken gibt
+ kurzweiliges Brettspiel für zwischendurch
+ freie Wahl aus Computergegnern, echten Mitspielern oder natürlich Multiplayer
+ zwei Spielmodi
+ die Zahlenscheibe zum  Würfeln lässt sich verschieden stark drehen
+ kommt dem Gefühl des echten Brettspiels relativ nahe

- das Regelwerk ist ziemlich knapp gehalten
- die Zwischenanimationen sind immer exakt identisch, was auf Dauer einfach nervt
- die Ereigniskarten wiederholen sich sehr, sehr schnell, was auf Dauer auch nervt
- wer ganz alleine spielt, wird mit meganervigen Minispielen (Geschicklichkeitsspiele) konfrontiert.  Die haben in einem Brettspiel überhaupt nichts verloren! Der finanzielle Erfolg im Minispiel ist natürlich wichtig für den Ausgang des Spiels
- die Computergegner agieren komplett unrealistisch und sind daher eigentlich immer zu schlagen (also langweilig)
- vor jedem Zug wird vom Drehrad zur Spielfigur gezoomt, was die Spielrunde bei mehreren Mitspielern sehr zäh machen kann

Die meisten Punkte nerven aber erst nach einer gewissen Spielzeit. Bis man sich allerdings am Spiel und am Spielbrett satt gesehen hat, ist es ein durchaus schön gemachtes Spiel und eine optisch hochwertige Brettspiel-Umsetzung.

Drehe am Rad & dabei nicht durch, wenn du deine Karriere beginnst. Das Spiel ist so ziemlich in allen Details gut umgesetzt & kommt der Brettspielvariante sehr nah.

Die Umsetzung ist aus meiner Sicht auf dem PC gut gelungen. Die Grafik ist etwas einfach strukturiert, aber dennoch farbenfroh & bunt. Der Sound bietet alles notwendige. Multiplayerspiele laufen einwandfrei & bieten so Abwechslung mit anderen Mitspielern. Intigrierte Minispiele bieten zusätzlichen Spaß. Insgesamt ist das ""Spiel des Lebens"" empfehlenswert, der Kauf jedoch nur im Sale/Angebot! Bei Steam wurde der Titel bereits für €2,49 angeboten. Von mir ein Daumen hoch!

THE GAME OF LIFE 2 is $5 more but a MUCH better experience.

Cons:
- Makes players click the screen every time money moves. EVERY. TIME. This slows down the game for no reason.*
- The 2 ""minigames"" suck. They feel like flash games with heavy input lag. They give out way too much money for a win.*
- Board choices are not explained. You also can't see the spaces on the path you are about to choose.*
- Nothing ""extra"" to make the game more fun. Turns are boring. You press the space bar and occasionally pick a card. *
- Animations are far too long and don't look good.*
- Only 4 playable colors*
- No real settings
- Graphics are abysmal*
- Generally unclear and ugly UI*
- Sound is cheap
- Only 1 board.. gets old pretty quick*

* = Fixed or changed in the second game

Pros:
- Multiplayer is stable
- The game works
- You can mute the terrible sounds",1612058864,1612058864,False,10,1,0.578228533267974854,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a quote I've been thinking about a lot lately. Not just because it is an astoundingly well crafted summary of the learning process, but also because it reminds me a lot of the 2015 board game adaption THE GAME OF LIFE.

You see, THE GAME OF LIFE is a game about repetition. The more rounds you play, the more strategy you learn, the more miniscule details in its design you recognise, the more its thematic significance dawns on you. In a sense, THE GAME OF LIFE is inspired by the Rouge-like genre, though more extreme. A rouge-like you can win. THE GAME OF LIFE, regardless of how well you're doing, you can never complete.

THE GAME OF LIFE taking you through life, then, is not a coincidemce. In fact, if you study Buddhism you will quickly find similarities. The game, of life, that is, is fundamentally about Saṃsāra, the concept of reincarnation in Buddhism. You live in a loop, going to university, getting a job, getting married and having kids, retiring, and finally dying and repeating the cycle anew.

Buddhism teaches that the end of this cycle is Nirvana, an enlightenment. THE GAME OF LIFE has no such thing; if it has, no one has reached it yet. There lies a profoundness in that. So much so that despite a lackluster gameplay that gets extremely boring very quickly and a waaaay too big price compared ot the amount of content, I am giving THE GAME OF LIFE a 7/10.",1608848030,1626895115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Жизнь в игре.

[quote]  [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/11769719-Dreams-of-Genesis/] Не забывайте заглядывать в группу куратора, вам не трудно, нам приятно :3 [/url]  [/quote]

[h1] [i] От создателей ""ха-ха, я вышел замуж и родил троих детей""[/i]  [/h1]
Забавная настолка, этакая упрощённая версия монополии, делающая упор не на покупки, а на ролевую составляющую (вот, как загнула!). А если проще, то вам предстоит играть в совсем простенькую настолку, которая отображает жизненный путь вашего персонажа. Несколько небольших развилок (учёба/работа, рискнуть/жить спокойно), несколько обязательных пунктов (женитья/выйти замуж, попасть в дом престарелых), всё это приправлено парой простеньких мини-игри бесконечным вращением волчка. 
Вердикт? Забавно, но первые несколько раз.

[h1] [i] Потому что настолка - это звучит гордо![/i]  [/h1]
И всё-таки подобные игры приятнее играются вживую. когда можно подержать в руках карты, есть кинестетическая составляющая. На компьютере слишком уж жто куцо и бледно смотрится. Тем не менее, когда вы не можете встретиться с друзьями, неплохая альтернатива вечерним посиделкам. Но не очень многоразовая.
Победа больше зависит от удачи, нежели от стратегии. так что азартным игрокам, возможно, ""Игра в жизнь"" зайдёт больше. На мой же скромный взгляд. она ориентирована на детей.  [strike]еее, однополые браки![/strike]

[h1] [i] Общее впечатление [/i]  [/h1]
Хороший способ скоротать несколько вечеров (но не более) в компаниитаких же скучающих друзей. Очень быстро приедается механика, т.к. практически отсутствует вариативность. Рекомендую брать исключительно по скидке.

[b]Плюсы[/b]:
+ простая как табурет;
+ всё относительно неплохо оптимизировано и смотрится красиво.

[b]Минусы[/b]:
- небольшая вариативность;
- мало мини-игр.

[b]Итог[/b]: на пару вечеров поугарать с друзьями, если есть желание поиграть в настолки, то лучше брать тейблтоп.

[i]Кому понравится:[/i] тем, кто хочет от души посмеяться и готов к тому, что игра быстро надоест.

Taxes due!"" and then a comically unrealistic scene showing how my money was taken).

Seeing this game, my hope was that it would be along the same lines. Sadly, it was not.
Originally I thought the game froze as it sat on the Hasbro screen for a surprisingly long time (is this game a resource-hogging game beyond open simulation games like Planet Coaster or the like? Apparently!). Finally it got to a loading screen for me to wait even longer. When I was on the main menu, I searched for settings--but there don't seem to be much in the way of changing game settings.

So, let's launch into my first game. Oh, I spun a 1. Okay, the two computer characters go first. I spin a one. Again. Fine. Nothing special happens when things happen in the game, except for choppy video that seems like my computer is greatly suffering. I gave up, quit the game, and went for my refund.

I didn't really go into this game with high expectation, it's a boardgame adaptation that came out in 2015 but for £2 on sale I thought it was worth a buy. 

Problems with the game: 
<> There is no Borderless Window option or Window option forcing you to play in Fullscreen
<> The game is easy, there are very few squares that negatively affect the outcome of the game 
<> The game felt short even though we played normal mode and not the quick mode that has random victory conditions
<> The animations were pretty bad and you could literally see each pixel when you spun the wheel

What was good about the game:
<> The Minigames were a nice addon and added a cool aspect to the game
<> Multiple paths allowing each player to have a more unique experience compared to games like 'Monopoly' that has a set path

The game is nothing special but it's fun enough to play with your friends if you've got nothing better to do. I did prefer playing 'UNO' though which is also on steam.

Gone are the faces on the old LIFE money, and gone are some of the more humorous events on the board.  All of which are replaced with family activity spin-oriented games.  

I don't know, it's an okay time waster, but to be honest it lacks a lot of appeal of what LIFE has as a board game.  Again the board seems shorter, the events not as varied, lots of reliance on family activity, little in the way of money management, which is part of what LIFE is about, and there's no ""Poor House"" before you reach retirement.  

All in all it's a dumbed down version of the board game that doesn't really offer much in the way of variance.  Not recommended.",1601290952,1601290952,False,1,0,0.447883099317550659,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've played a couple of different versions over the years, but none of them have been as completely dull as this one. 

There was absolutely no challenge to the game. None of the decisions you make, such as you can make them, really make any difference. Very few of the spaces have any negative effects, and they're minor compared to the amount of money you can get on nearly every space. All of the games pretty much go the same way, with all players ending the game at pretty much the same time and totaling up their money. The games with people tend to end up being pretty close, with both players having about the same amount of money. The minigames you occasionally have to play are pretty boring as well. The game has a fast mode, where a random victory condition is met to end the game instead of going all the way to the end. I don't really know why it's necessary though, because the regular game doesn't really take that long to complete.

Are there any positives to the game? Yes. The game looks really nice. It also plays pretty well, I never had any technical issues with it. There weren't that many people playing online, it took a while to get even one other person in an online match, but there weren't issues with disconnects or anything. It also has Steam trading cards, and achievements that are pretty easy to get. 

Overall, 2/10. There's no reason the game has to be this bad. I've played better board games by this dev, and better computer versions of The Game of Life. It's pretty cheap and goes on sale for cheaper, so it's okay if you're interested in the trading cards, but if you're looking for a fun game to play with friends you can do much better.",1595976942,1595976942,False,9,2,0.546167194843292236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

impatient and playing at weird times of the day/night. I still haven't gotten to play with friends with Remote Play, but I may update this review when I do. Also the minigames help differentiate the online game from the physical copy and the version on tabletop simulator.

However I would prefer more types of minigames as this only has 2 at the moment. Also the play style feels extremely slow even with the 'fast' play which is why I don't really replay it as often. It feels like a complete drag. Especially when playing with CPU. Despite all that, I do enjoy the game occasionally but it keeps on freezing whenever I want to restart the game which is a big letdown as I really want to finish the achievements but don't want to wait for the next round to try again and as I said before it feels so SLOW even with fast play on.

The rewards of these cards basically render your salary useless as most of the money comes from action cards and minigames. 

Speaking of which... The minigames are too simplistic and lacking diversity, yet I still found myself enjoying the minigames more than the ""game"" itself.

Update: I just noticed that they released a new version a week ago (not as an update, but as a new game). Well, it still has the same flaws. The only improvement is that you can speed up animations and stuff a bit (x5), but it's still damn slow. And CPU players still cheat on the RNG. There it is:

Whenever the games were brought out, it was always on the top of my list. The cars and distinct people pegs, that unmistakable sound of the spinner turning, and all of the cool spaces to land on were just a few of the draws that I latched on to. Can that wonder hold up against an older, less forgiving critic?

The Game
I won't go into too much detail as I am pretty sure most everyone knows how the Game of Life is played. In short, the game takes the player from approximately being college aged to retirement, going through life events such as choosing a career, getting married, buying a house and having children. Between the major life happenings, the player can also experience plenty of other events that span the winding game track: some that could qualify as midlife crisis, like buying a beach house or plastic surgery, and other, smaller occurrences such as receiving stock, upgrading a computer, etc. The game ends when all players retire and the person with the most money is declared the winner.

I do want to note that the version that I am basing this review on is not the same version that I used to play as a child. This review will be done on 2002 version using the 10/02 rev.2 rule set and I can only guess at what version I used to play. It was during the 1980's when I was first introduced, so I am assuming that I played that decades version. I do remember driving Chrysler-esque minivans along the board and according to the Wikipedia entry on The Checkered Game of Life, the minivans were introduced in the 1980s reinforcing my theory.

Game pieces
It's not really fair for me to comment about the quality of the game pieces in this review as my ""gently used"" copy came from a local Savers thrift store at a whopping cost of $3.99. I will say, however, that the spinner has not changed much with this version. If you spin it incorrectly it will jam up and not spin, which is exactly as I remember it. As much as I love the distinguishing uniqueness of the spinner, no one should have to battle against a game to get it to function correctly. I also wish Hasbro would have included additional Bank Loan notes. Between the 100,000 in college loans and having to buy a house only a few spins later, my wife and I managed to eat up nearly all the notes in most of the games we played. If there were more players, we would have had to come up with a solution. It's hard to say if the problem was due to missing pieces when I purchased the game or if it was shipped with what I had, but it looked like the game was only played once before I bought it as only one blue and one pink people pegs had been detached from their plastic housing.

Gameplay
For such a complex looking board, Game of Life is one of easiest board games to understand and play. Spin the Spinner, move number of spaces indicated, and then perform action indicated on the space landed upon. Every turn is that or a variation of that, whether it be stopping for a required Stop space, paying out Pay Days that are passed regardless of stopping on them or not, and landing on an optional-to-play blue space.

There are some differences in this version compared to the 1980s version. One is that stocks certificates are purchasable and the player earns money for each time the Spinner lands on the number of the stock. Gone are the times of buying chances of hitting it big on the betting board, which makes me sad. I enjoyed spinning for the winnings Another variation is that no spins are made for money at marriage and adding children, instead you get Life Tiles (discussed below); how dull. I seemed to remember giving money to the person who ended up getting married first, which added some value to being in the lead. Also in this version kids are absolutely worthless. There is one, maybe two, spaces on the board where you owe money based off the amount of children you have, but other than that, they just add color to your car. And those Life Tiles, what are those about? They only make the game even more random. I could understand if there were more interactions with them throughout the game, like what happens with the Athlete career, but there aren't. There are a few other minor variations, selling your house (for potential profit) and purchasing a new one, night school, and changes in available insurances, but they are fairly insignificant to the game.

Final Thoughts
Whether it be the changes in the rules or just the fact that I am not a kid anymore, but the Game of Life just doesn't hold on to the appeal that it used to have for me. I still find the game fun, but I don't have that wonder of experiencing the story of the game that I used to. My mind is now more focused on critically examining the mechanics of the game and it doesn't hold up as it is completely luck based. It's all in the draw of your career/salary cards, the number that turns up on the spinner, and the value of the Life Tiles at the end of the game. For players who have fond memories of older versions, I would not suggest this version over what you are used to; however, if you have not had the chance to experience this game or want to play it with your children, then I say go for it. Your children will still enjoy this game with the excitement of experiencing all the cool events and will be fun for you as well, just not nearly as much as when you were experiencing it as a child. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.",1586553186,1586553253,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Playing with just people it's ok but if you use any cpu players the lazy programming shows everywhere.

Залезай в машинку и прокатись по жизни вместе с игрой ""Игра в жизнь""!
Объезжай неприятности, делай правильные решения и ты сможешь выйти на пенсию богатеем в этой захватывающей игре на умение и удачу!
Попробуй объехать всю доску, обзаведись всяческими благами, ценными жетонами Жизни и может быть даже семьей.
Но стоит тебе попасть на неправильное поле и ты поплатишься всем своим состоянием.
Игра каждый раз разная. Куда же заведет тебя твой жизненный путь на сей раз? Выиграешь лотерею? Спасешь планету? Или же все твои деньги прогорят на очередном Обвале Биржи? Крути барабан и увидишь. Сможешь сколотить самое большое состояние - выиграешь игру!

Цель игры: стать самым богатым игроком, когда все выйдут на пенсию.

Перед началом игры необходимо собрать игровое поле, установив на него вертушку, горы, мост и строения. Также нужно раздать жетоны Жизни, разделить карты на стопки, выбрать банкира и машинки с человечком для каждого игрока.

Ход игры:

По очереди вращайте вертушку и двигайтесь по доске, выполняя то, чего требует поле, на которое Вы попали.
Выберите, идти ли в университет, или сразу начать карьеру.
Всегда получайте зарплату, когда проходите или попадаете на зеленое поле Получка. Налог платится только, если попадаешь на Поле Налога.
Попадая на поле с надписью Жизнь, получайте по жетону жизни. Оставьте его повернутым лицом вниз!
Останавливайтесь на полях с красным знаком Стоп, даже если у Вас еще остались шаги.
Зарабатывайте деньги, вкладывая в Акции и копите деньги, покупая Страховку на дом или машину.
После того, как достигнете Финиша, выберите, куда уйти на пенсию.
Посчитайте наличные и стоимость жетонов Жизни, чтобы выяснить, кто выиграл! Выигрывает самый богатый игрок.",1585901847,1585901847,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/403120/discussions/0/496880203079299377/] Here it is [/url] .

It amazes me that when the devs originally released this game onto Steam, they only had hotseat multiplayer and no kind of online whatsoever.  The people who already owned the game wanted to add an online feature and the devs did just that.  I feel like this game would've been bland without the online multiplayer. If you have friends to play this game with, I highly recommend it. I was gifted this game along with 3 of my other friends. We play it occasionally and it's quite fun.  The Game of Life is one of my favorite board games and seeing it on PC in this form is just great.

The game was fun I played it with my friend then right when my in game Peg / Person, got married. I realised I wasn't playing anymore. I couldn't control any of my Choices, collect money, and ETC.. I couldn't do ANYTHING. An AI took me over. Which was annoying I ended up leaving in my first few games and I wish I could get a refund.

Things I like: 
It's a nice 3D version of game of life I have the board game for this but, it was nice to not think so hard counting money and moving my arms. 
Not to laggy.
Fun for about a hour.

Things I dislike: 
Gets very boring.
AI can take over.
It does lag when a loading screen happens.
Takes a long time to join a real friend.
No chat (In game)
Is only fun for about a hour.
Costs way to much money for what you get.

[i][b]THE GAME OF LIFE[/b][/i] est l'adaptation en jeu vidéo du jeu de société du même nom, ""[i]Destins[/i]"" chez nous les français. Le principe est le même que le jeu de société : tourner une roue pour avancer sur un plateau et atteindre la fin. En avançant, on passe par les différentes phases d'une vie bien formatée, c'est-à-dire entrée dans la vie active (obligatoire), mariage (obligatoire), cours du soir pour un diplôme tardif et un ""meilleur"" travail (ou non), enfant(s) (ou non), crise de la quarantaine/cinquantaine (ou non), et enfin retraite (qui ici ne s'éloigne pas de plus en plus en rajoutant des cases sur le plateau...)...woooooooo. Et à la fin, on prend le liquide et les bonus pour voir qui a le plus d'argent et donc qui a gagné.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1926152664
Bref, pour ""changer de vie"", ce n'est pas le meilleur des jeux. Mais pour passer une petite demi-heure tranquillou histoire de passer le temps, c'est pas mal. On peut jouer en local jusqu'à 4 joueurs, avec ou sans IA, et également jouer en ligne. On ne peut pas changer la difficulté de l'IA, celle-ci est standard et, sans être mauvaise, n'est pas fameuse non plus. 
Il y a deux modes de jeu : le mode classique, qui consiste à atteindre la fin du plateau et avoir le plus d'argent, et le mode rapide, qui consiste à atteindre un objectif aléatoire en premier (par exemple atteindre la chapelle en premier, être le premier à gagner 300K, etc...).
La faiblesse du jeu se trouve dans son contenu, car celui-ci n'est pas très étoffé. Il y a peu de carrières différentes, peu de cartes ""action"" différentes, seulement 2 mini-jeux différents, et le plateau ne contient pas énormément de cases à parcourir. Comptez un petit 20 minutes pour une partie 1 joueur contre un IA, et 45 minutes pour 1 joueur et 3 IA. Notez d'ailleurs qu'à chaque carte de duel, l'IA choisira le/un joueur à affronter.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1926152366
Du coup, malheureusement, on en fait vite le tour. On relancera le jeu pour jouer une partie ou deux avec les amis, ou pour gagner tous les succès (qui, à ce propos, ne tombent que pour le 1er joueur et hôte de la partie), mais c'est probablement tout. Néanmoins, les quelques heures qu'on passera dessus seront agréables et tranquilles, pour peu qu'on apprécie le concept du jeu au préalable. 5€ n'est pas bien cher, mais je vous encourage tout de même à attendre une petite promo si le jeu vous intéresse.

[b] 1.Задумка [/b]
Суть игры в том,что мы,вращая колесо, продвигаемся по своему жизненному пути и попутно получаем образование,зарабатываем деньги,покупаем недвижимость, создаём семью и т.п. По пути мы подбираем карточки с различными событиями,которые призваны разнообразить геймплей. В конце же подсчитываются наши накопления на основе полученных карточек,рождённых детей,купленной недвижимости.Игрок, сумевший обеспечить себе более достойную старость, побеждает.
[b] 2.Мини игры [/b]
Они так же,как и карточки попадаются нам на пути и вносят разнообразие.Всего существует два вида.В первой мы должны подбирать летящие на нас купюры и уклоняться от нежелательных объектов.Во второй мы подкрадываемся к охраннику и пытаемся либо подобраться как можно ближе,либо вовсе дойти до конца.Учавствуют все игроки и независимо от занятого места получают прибыль по результатам игры.
[h1] Не понравилось [/h1]
[b] 1.Боты [/b]
С ними очень скучно играть.Они довольно глупые,всегда выбирают низкооплачиваемые профессии,все карточки применяют на игрока,не покупают недвижимость, их поведение очень предсказуемо.А ещё их нельзя добавить в игру с другом.

You start right after graduating highschool, you are an 18 year old male or female (unfortunately the game does not allow you to pick a third option), and you are very poor because you only have $250000, with this money you can either start a career or go to college, while college can sometimes land you a higher paying job, it unfortunately costs $100000, which subtracts from your final total. After any additional schooling is done, the game putters along just like real life, until marriage. At this point you are sent into a church and allowed to select either a male or female partner, from there you continue until you are given the option to return to college for an additional $100000 and select a new career, or continue on with your life.

Every abortion loses you $50k, and honestly, with the current state of the economy, we can't afford this. Things like this, is why China is winning the trade war, unless everyone has as many kids as possible, our way of life will be extinguished. Once you have acquired as many kids as will fit in your car (a house is optional when raising 7 children with your partner), you continue on until you reach the cross roads of life, here the choice comes down to the risky road or the safe road, the safe road will continue in the monotony of life (random world cruises, law suits, winning $100000 in a pie eating contest, and other ordinary events) or you can take the risky road for a high risk/ high reward. From the risky road, you go home to retirement, which location you and your 27 infants choose to go to, will have no outcome on the end of the game.

The second reason which is the negative part is that the game is too simplistic and it lacked creativity.

Rather than playing all the way through retirement, you can choose a random end point, such as ""First to get married"" or ""First to earn $750K""  As you would expect, these are pretty heavily dependent upon which person goes first.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Simple to learn
+ Nice graphics, presentation
+ Randomized events & luck-based elements make no two games the same
+ Skill based minigames add variety
+ Great for all ages

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- After a couple games it can become repetitive
- Viewing the board is awkward, can only be done at start of turn, and can't change angle
- Minigames are great, but two is too few
- The AI is too easy to beat in minigames
- You need a lot of luck to pull off 6+ children achievement

The game is simple: Pick a career, roll the spinner, and make a series of choices along the way (paths, home purchase/sale, re-roll career, try to have children). Ultimately, though, your success or failure will be up to chance. There is a mild element of strategy here if you play against other people, since your final score is the sum of a number of choices you can make.

Fans of the board game will appreciate this digital upgrade, and the ability to play with friends or relatives online. If you're looking for wholesome entertainment for children, this is a great pick.

Achievement Hunters: Pretty easy to 100%, but note the following: First, only the host credits achievement unlocks. Even if you play a local game, 1P must meet the requirements to earn it. Second, the children achievement requires 6 or more (""over 5""), and this is very RNG dependent. Look at the board tiles and restart if you don't have it after you pass all chances to add children. All achievements can be unlocked in solo play. For fastest time, only add one AI opponent. Good luck!",1556053352,1556053414,True,20,1,0.70114368200302124,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I like to give them an hour or two, and if I make a mistake and get a bad one (Which I have done a few times) I bite the bullet and accept my losses. I have not refunded a game on Steam.

Until tonight.

I saw a video of people playing this, and decided to check it out. It looked fun enogh, and if it wasn't a complete piece of garbage I probably would get it for a friend so I would have a playing buddy. My optimism at the game was running high. 5 dollars? Pretty cheap, but I could easily get that much use out of it.

That optimism was not meant to last as I started up the game. I click the icon, and lean in, ready for a fun experience playing a game that was a cornerstone of my childhood. I grin as I click pass and play. I don't know anyone who has this, so I set up a CPU, and clicked start. I spin for the right to go first. I am ready to rock and roll

I go second, decide to go to college, and get three spins in. Suddenly, I can't hand money over. I click and click and click. Nothing changes. I assume bug, exit to the main menu, and resume. I do this a few more times, and eventually restart. Same problem, except it was sooner. I did this three times, and it never failed to damper my day further.

I spent the last hour of my life debating if I should write this, before deciding that this is what I need to do. I also decided to refund it. I'm just grateful that I got 5 dollars back. It's 5 dollars I can spend on a functioning game.

Verdict: Buy the real life Game Of Life instead. It's pretty much guaranteed that it'll function better than this.",1526286618,1526286618,False,6,4,0.369566887617111206,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I played the physical board game of LIFE as a kid, I'm a massive fan of this game, which is why my friend got the computer version for me. This game is actually a really nice, relaxing way to spend an evening. It stays true to the original spirit of the board game and has added some creative minigames and a few extra features that weren't present in the original physical board game, which was a welcomed surprise for a seasoned player like myself. Oh, and major props for being able to choose your spouse's gender, regardless of your own gender. LGBT visibility is always a major selling point for me and I wasn't expecting that kind of progressiveness in a board game that was originally made in 1860, with the modern version we know today being released in 1960. Big thumbs up for that!

On top of the extra minigames and neat features, including being able to play online with your friends, it's just a really nice-looking game with a good soundtrack and cute cutscenes and animations for big events in the game, like getting married, graduating from university and having children. I found the entire thing really enjoyable and I was a bit sceptical going into it just because I am such a huge lifelong fan of The Game of LIFE and I didn't want to be disappointed. Not only was I not disappointed, I was actually pretty impressed. For the $5 it costs, it's a fantastic steal to add to your library if you're a fan of board games.

The only criticisms I can think of for it are when you're playing against computers, they can take their turns a bit too fast sometimes and I can't always follow exactly what they did on their turn. It would be nice if that was slowed down by just a couple seconds. Also, buying a house seems to be optional rather than mandatory in this version of the game. Not 100% sure if there was a rule change in 2016, my tabletop version of the game is a few years old by now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I played it with my parents and only finished it because I felt obliged to. This 2016 edition finds a way to make the players feel like spectators and generally disjointed from the experience. I've owned several other PC versions of this board game that were way more interactive than this. I believe that Atari's 1999 version seriously blows this one out of the water which is sad considering technology has advanced SO much since then.

There is very little that the user actually does then just click through dialogs. Some of the other editions find an interesting way to make you feel more attached to your choices. That is not the case with this 2016 edition- you choose a faceless peg and watch it drive around the board. To say there is no personality to this game is a gross understatement.

The most cringey addition are the odd prompts they've added to LIFE cards. I awkwardly laughed through forced interactions like ""choose an opponent and compare your best karate chop"". We also had incredible difficulty with the spinner which probably accounted for an additional 15 minutes of gameplay. I was happy when the game was over and promptly returned it.

I LOVE board games but I do not recommend this version at all. It seems like a shell of a game and even a bit transactional...which is not a feeling I attribute to fun.",1466382687,1466862963,False,18,0,0.600746512413024902,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Purchase: $3.34 on special on Steam

Achievements: 10/10 - another 100% game
Fun Factor:  1 hour, the rest was an interminable grind
Trading Cards: Yes

The game of LIFE board game was one of my favourites growing up and there is plenty that could have been done around the cards you pick up on the board to make them fun and interactive but I'm sorry that I expected something better than this version which makes the one on my iphone look good (and I thought that was a waste of money).

The animations are cute and kid friendly but they draw out an already unengaging experience and make it more painful than watching golf, particularly as you watch the same animations without a speedup or instant click through for each player whether human or npc and unlike the board game where spinning was fun, here it's just another chore.
 
The minigames are a neat diversion from the monotony but occur too infrequently to save this and after the first hour I was simply playing to get the last two mini game achievements for 100% and idling to get the last trading card before uninstalling.

In every game bar one I had the same job and there seemed very little variation or reason to want to play again.  I had played and won games with 5 kids, no kids, having gone to college, been a farmer etc.

If you have a spare wall in the house spend your $5 on a can of paint and watch that dry, it will be far more entertaining.

I had played a previous version of the Game of Life on the computer, and I loved every second of it.  There was a lot added to make it feel unique, such as mini-games, video clips and cut scenes, an announcer.  It was pretty fun.

While this version may stray a lot from its original counterpart, I don't really see that as a bad thing.  I will say that compared to the other computer version of this game, this one just feels kind of bare bones, but it does still have the charm of the original.

The lack of online multiplayer is an odd choice, and I don't like the fact that the mini-games are exclusive to single player.  I would have also liked new themes or layouts of the board just to add a little more variety (much like Mario Party).

Overall, I think that this is a pretty good game to play when you need to relax, because it is very easy to win, even against three AI players, and the mini-games are a joke (except for Spin to Win, which is just roulette).",1461660861,1461660861,True,5,0,0.499779969453811646,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I disagree with the notion that it doesn't matter it's no fun to play because it's only $5.  I wouldn't pay $5 for a pile of dog crap even if it was on sale.  I almost didn't buy it when I read that it isn't the board from the actual board game of the same name, but it's certainly possible for the game's board to be improved as long as they hold to the original mechanics.  They don't.  And the result is a much flatter game without dynamic options like Promisary Notes and Stock purchases.

As far as options go, you can adjust music and sound effect levels.  And while alt-return does activate windowed mode, you can't adjust the size of the window past its full-screen size.   The graphics have bright colors and sparkles, but no anti-aliasing, so it's a pretty rough clash.

Lots of times the cards you get dealt from landing on tiles aren't up long enough for a slow reader like me to absorb.  Consequently during many of the unnecessary minigames I find myself saying, ""Wait, what the hell is going on?  What happened to the Game of Life?  Is it my turn?  Where did I set the bong?""

In that light, I wouldn't recommend it even for a 5 year old, partly because of the game's assumption that you read quickly, and partly because a 5 year old can be amused by an empty egg carton.

Но оказалось не так. Обычная настольная игра. Игра о жизненном пути. Суть заключается в следующем - Вы ребенок проходите обучение, выбираете профессию. После происходит становление семьи -свадьба. Далее Вам предоставляют выбор, сменить профессию или просто продолжить играть, в данном случае можете поменять свою профессию или продолжать играть с той которую получили в начале. После Вам предоставляется выбор обзавестись детьми или продолжить свой карьерный рост. После уже будет выбор пройти по трудному пути или по легкому. Ну и в конце Вас ждет выбор сельского дома или особняка миллионера. 

На первом этапе Вы выбираете профессию - она дает Вам дополнительный заработок к деньгам, на выбор предоставляется карточка с описанием профессии, заработной платы и числом на циферблате волчка. Если Ваши оппоненты попадают на число которое вы выбрали при получении карьеры - вы получаете деньги. Становление семьи - это своего рода то же получение денег, но только разовое. Вам предоставляют выбор пола вашей фигурки, мужчина или женщина, а так же выбор жениться или выйти замуж. После свадьбы раскручивает волчок и от числа выпавшего зависит сумма подаренная Вам. После чего Вы можете сменить профессию, если Вам не нравится, или продолжить путь, в зависимости от выбора - от выбора зависит путь на поле, в одном из случаев он будет сокращенный в другом увеличенный. Как и перед всеми семьями встает вопрос о детях. Предоставляется выбор обзавестись детьми или продолжить путь, если выбираете детей - то попадаете на поле в котором Ваша семья может увеличится численно, если прошли мимо, то Вы укоротите путь к финишу, но на поле так же можно встретить клетку с ребенком. По пути к финишу Вам предоставят шанс сократить маршрут и пройти по безопасному маршруту или опасному. Безопасный маршрут имеет большее количество клеток чем опасный, но на опасном маршруте можете повстречать клетки, в которых Вам предстоит заплатить большую сумму денег в банк, но путь будет сокращен. Ну и на финише выбор сельского дома или особняка миллионера в котором проведете старость. В конце игры ведется подсчет всех средств, детей, карточек выбранных Вами, домов приобретенных в собственность, начисление денежных средств к пенсии, и денег выданных банком, которые банк заберет с процентами. После подсчета и выявляют победителя. 

Как и многие настольные игры имеется поле, фигурки и волчок с циферблатом от 1 до 10. Каждое поле несет в себе карточку, в которой может попасться соревнование с выбранным Вами игроком, соревнование со всеми игроками, бонус к денежным средствам, штраф в виде уплаты налогов или денег за какое-либо действие. Все конкурсы связаны с раскруткой волчка, Выигрывает тот у кого выпадет больше число на циферблате, или тот игрок который угадал цифру на циферблате в начале конкурса. Так же конкурс на красное и черное, при выпадении красного цвета Вы получите бонус в виде денег или при выпадении черного Вам придется заплатить деньги в банк. Игра красиво анимирована, все фигурки меняют свой внешний вид по ходу прохождения, от обычной до большой машины полностью набитой детьми.

Итак, пробежимся по плюсами и минусам:
Плюсы: спокойная и приятная игра, подойдет всей семье. играть можно до четырех человек, цена.
Минус игры: управлять нужно одной мышкой всем игрокам. Контроллеры в данной игре не предусмотрены. Но тут не могу не рассказать Вам один нюанс. Что бы не подбегать постоянно к мышке вашего компьютера, проще всего обзавестись гироскопической мышкой и спокойно включать игру на большом телевизоре. Гироскопическая мышка мала по своим размерам, ее удобно передавать из рук в руки сидя на том же диване. Да и вообще нужная вещица.
Позже на своем канале сделаю видео-обзор гироскопической мышки, так что присоединяйтесь. [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6pmcX56A_NKGwpnl9ZRoBg] youtube channel [/url]
