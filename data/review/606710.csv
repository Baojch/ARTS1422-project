INT. VENTURE TOWER - NIGHT Lacroix, Beckett, Strauss, Isaac, Velvet, Jeanette, Gary, Tung, Jack, Nines, and Damsel are gathered in Lacroix's opulent office. A massive screen flickers to life, revealing Lacroix with a game controller in hand. 🌃🎮

LACROIX (trying to sound cool) Ah, my esteemed associates, gather 'round. Tonight, I present to you a masterpiece of gaming - Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy. 🕹️🔥

The group exchanges skeptical glances, but Lacroix presses play. 👀🎮

BECKETT (grinning) Well, well, Lacroix. I never thought I'd see the night when the Prince himself indulges in video games. What's next, karaoke? 🎤😂

LACROIX (dismissive) This is merely a momentary diversion. I have an appreciation for ancient artifacts, even in pixelated form. The game starts, and Sphinx appears on the screen. 🎮🏛️

ISAAC (raising an eyebrow) And who's this fine feline fellow? Your long-lost ancestor, Lacroix? 🐱🤨

LACROIX (ignoring the comment) This is Sphinx, our daring protagonist. Swift as a Nosferatu in the shadows. 🦇🌑

VELVET (smirking) More like swift as a Malkavian on a particularly cryptic rant. Laughter ripples through the group. 😜🤣

JEANETTE (teasing) Oh, Sphinx, the charming cat-man. Reminds me of someone I once knew. Except, of course, without the allure. 😻💋

LACROIX (looking unamused) Watch and learn. There's more to this game than meets the eye. 👀📖

GARY (raising an eyebrow) Lacroix, my man, you're playing like a Tremere trying to grasp the concept of subtlety. 🤔🧛‍♂️

LACROIX (annoyed) I assure you, my skills are unparalleled. Meanwhile, Sphinx is struggling with a puzzle. 🧩😅

TUNG (laughing) Even I could handle that puzzle better, and English isn't even my first language! 😂🌍

LACROIX (grumbling) Enough banter. This game requires strategy and finesse. Sphinx encounters a boss, and Lacroix faces a virtual defeat. 😤👾

STRAUSS (dryly) It appears that even in the digital realm, your plans crumble, Lacroix. The group bursts into laughter as Lacroix scowls at the screen. 😆🤣

VELVET (smirking) I must say, Lacroix, your virtual escapades are more entertaining than a night at The Asylum. 😈🎭

NINES (chuckles) Who knew the Prince had a soft spot for ancient cat-themed adventures? 😼😄

JACK (snickering) You're making our vampire overlord look like a fledgling trying to grasp undead reality. 😂🧛‍♂️

JEANETTE (playfully) Lacroix, darling, if only ruling a city was as easy as navigating this game. 🏙️🕹️

DAMSEL (rolling her eyes) Typical. The Prince can't even navigate a simple pitfall. No wonder our city's a mess. 🤦‍♀️🕳️

As the game continues, the banter intensifies, creating a night of camaraderie and laughter in the most unexpected of places - Lacroix's office. 🌃😂🎉

LACROIX (grinning) Well, my dear colleagues, while I may have faced a few setbacks in the digital realm, I must admit that Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy offers a refreshing diversion from the nightly politics. 🌌🕹️

BECKETT (smirking) So, are you saying you enjoyed getting your pixels handed to you?

LACROIX (nodding) Indeed. It's a testament to the game's challenge, a puzzle in itself. Much like ruling a city, wouldn't you agree? 🧩🌃

STRAUSS (inclining his head) An intriguing parallel, Prince Lacroix. The dynamics of power, even in a virtual landscape, are quite captivating.

LACROIX (raising an eyebrow) Precisely, Herr Strauss. Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy provides a unique blend of strategy and entertainment, much like orchestrating the delicate dance of Kindred society. 🩸💃

JEANETTE (grinning) Well, I never thought I'd see the day when our stoic Prince would find joy in a game. Perhaps there's hope for you yet, cherie.

LACROIX (smirking) Hope, dear Jeanette, is a rare commodity in our world. Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, however, managed to deliver it in spades, even if it was virtual. 🃏🎭

	I feel like a fucking fossil, but I need to tell the zoomers reading, before every game tried to be a Dark Souls clone, a similar trend was to try to make every game a Zelda clone. These are adventure games with varied but necessary inventories to give players the illusion of power and choice, when there's actually a fairly strict progression that's expected to be followed. For my money, the best titles in this ""knock-off"" genre are Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, and 3D Dot Game Heroes.

	What sets Zelda-like apart from actual Legend of Zelda games (at least, before BOTW) is that real Zelda games tend to be obsessively focused and exhaustive. I mean, even with how much the 3D entries' exploration made full use of those 3D environments, they didn't even bother to include a real ""jump"" button; When Nintendo wanted you to leap across a certain location, they had to give you enough room for a running start. When they wanted you to go up, they'd give you things to climb, elevators and air currents to ride, things that didn't need a dedicated ""jump"" button. So, if that's how much attention they could give to NOT binding one function to a whole-ass button, it's no wonder that those games often feel so full and fleshed-out.

	Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, on the other hand, is endemic merely of the Zelda-like. You've got unique tools that are needed only a couple of times, and then, never again. They make up a rebindable inventory that's not really big enough to justify rebinding. You use these things to explore a world which, while massive, much of the promotional material and ""making of"" shows was cut down significantly from what could have been. Every time something looks like it's going somewhere, the game reins you back and pushes you in another direction that, while still entertaining, usually doesn't go far enough.

	This type of constraint is most pronounced in the flow of the story. It starts off okay, slowly opening up as wrong turn after wrong turn gives excuses to explore a little further in new directions. Things lose cohesion, though, as the story plods along a tired path that doesn't do anything very creative. (Young apprentice, jealousy and betrayal, chosen one, yadda yadda yadda.) Characters are introduced, and then sort of fade into obscurity if they aren't killed outright. Especially toward the end of the game, the plot feels rushed, like someone just ran out of time, and strung things together with the thinnest possible threads. With some of these bosses, I really felt like I didn't know who I was fighting, with a bare-bones explanation of why. To top it all off, as a final insult, it concludes with the stupidest, most abrupt cliffhanger ending one could possibly write. I wish that the parts that either felt so shoehorned or under-explained had showed up earlier, to not only give themselves more relevance, but to provide reasons for a little more variety and length.

	Speaking of variety and length...

	On a gameplay level, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is generally fun, but fleeting. It divides into two types: the open-world Zelda-type game with Sphinx, and Tutankhamen's stealth-driven linear stages that culminate in platforming and lever puzzles.
	With Sphinx, it sometimes seems like it's just moving you onto the next ability or item as soon as possible, which sounds good, but that means you're rarely exploring their real potential. You CAN use acid darts to melt chains anywhere (not just in the dungeon you're told to go to after you receive them), ice darts to freeze several types of enemies (not just in the dungeon where you get them), and captured Slim Burbles as a weapon (instead of just as a general bomb tool for blowing up rocks and shit.) Most of the items you get have multiple possible applications, but the game rarely uses them after their dedicated introductions. To that end, a lot of the equipment ends up feeling useless in the long run. It's like buying a new game, playing it once or twice, and then letting it rot on your shelf.
	In contrast, Tut's isolated levels often feel like they're combining unlocked abilities for the sake of building more complex puzzles and stealth segments. The irony is that the more restrictive design actually makes these sections feel fuller. I never spent as much time in these parts thinking about what could have been as I did in the rest of the game.
	So, I need to ask, were more intricate puzzles really not an option for the open world, where the player spends far more time? With so much space to work with, I figure that that would be the best opportunity to pack some of the locations choc-full of brain teasers. It just doesn't, though.

	To try and cover for the emptiness, Sphinx will try to keep you captivated by the style. When I first played this on the Gamecube, it looked pretty weird coming at me through a fucked-up CRT TV that I bought at a garage sale, with overemphasized greens and reds, and some weird kind of astigmatism effect. This having an Egypt theme, a lotta shit is red, and a lotta shit glows, and I'm glad that I've now gotten to fully appreciate its style through a better resolution on a clearer screen. (On a side note, I did encounter some spazzing light effects here and there, and some texture popping. There was also an occasional audio glitch where the music would stop playing for no real reason, but this is probably just my own hardware issue, because I'm playing this on an abacus. It's an acceptable trade-off for being able to change the FOV.)

	This is a pretty good looking game, even nearly twenty years removed. The character and enemy designs are just cartoony enough to not let them be taken too seriously, appropriately speaking in Zelda-like grunts and squawks, and some of the locations they populate are downright beautiful: a sprawling desert that crawls right up to a looong shoreline, a city built on top of electrified water, a bigass wall that makes the USA-Mexico border fence look like it's made outta fucking popsicle sticks, an imposing castle that looms threateningly over a volcanic wasteland. There are quite a few impressive settings that nonetheless manage to fall under the umbrella of its Egyptian theme, and many are pulled off perfectly. For when this game originally came out, the combination of scale and detail is still impressive to this day.

	Yet, in spite of its physical size, it all feels minuscule due to its lack of depth. The puzzles for Sphinx are few and simple because most of them exist as tutorials for his equipment, which is itself such a small assortment that it will never be competing for space on your controller (unless you feel like binding captured creatures to your buttons. Again, that's not really necessary.)
	The soundtrack is memorable, and I like it, but it's quite repetitive. You're gonna hear the same pieces of music over and over.
	Being able to capture almost every land-dwelling non-boss monster after wearing them down, and use the collected enemies for your own purposes, à la Pokémon, is cool. However, this cornucopia of potential is damn near empty. Only a couple of caught enemies have any use for puzzles or combat, while the rest basically exist for the sake of being collected.
	This game could have used more of everything. A more cohesive plot, a few more puzzles and locations, a few more tools, and a few more types of enemies is all it would've taken to make it great.

	As it stands, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is the archetypal gelded 3D Zelda-like, something that could have been much more, but instead played it safe. I'd love to see a sequel, but I doubt it's gonna happen. I wish I had the patience to learn the authoring tools for this release, because I think that's where most of the potential for this game now lies.

The explorations and dungeons are very fun but the dungeons themselves are extremely short. And the mummy sections feel tacked on despite being the most fun of the game (also extremely short) but sincerely when this game is doing puzzles it's doing what it does best.

Sadly the combat is not good at all and that extends to the bosses that are really boring. 

And finaly the story is basic but fun, the pantomimes that all characters do to compensate for the lack of voice acting is great though if they are too cartoony for a some what serious game is up to you to decide. The ending though, it left a cliff hanger through a serious cop out, if the last 10 seconds of the story didn't exist I'm sure I would be completely satisfied from what I got from this game now I'm kinda bummed that there is a small little kink that will never get resolved on the story (and it was one I was really interested in to leave the cherry on top). 

TL;DR: good exploration and puzzles, bad combat and bosses, buy if you aren't bothered by cliffhangers that will never get resolved.

Well, it's finally done. This game has been itching the back of my skull ever since I lost my PS2 copy without completing it way back in the day. Now that I've finally scratched the itch, I'm pretty much satisfied. It's a good-but-not-great Zelda clone with top-notch graphics for the time, decent gameplay and progression with lots of room for improvement, and spectacular sound and art design.

I give this a tenuous recommendation. Zelda does this style of game much better, and there are a countless amount of good copycats of the top-down Zelda game style, but there's a good chance this might be the best 3D Zelda clone, as it's the only one I can think of.

It is a product of it's time, in both good and bad ways. 

Originally released back in 2003 for the PS2, Xbox and Gamecube, it seems to have all the trappings of a genre game from the early 2000s. Yet, these comparative examples to other games are mostly surface level, and why there is only a handful of games today that feel like Sphinx. Today, budgetary concerns impede the developer's freedom to use their imagination more than ever before. In the PS2 era, this risk was mitigated, which allowed more creative risk to be taken.

Set in mythological Egypt, the game follows not only titular hero Sphinx, but also the mummy Tutankhamen. Sphinx is tasked with breaking the curse that is ravishing the lands, so that he might stop the main villain Set. He'll travel to the city of Abydos, the land of Heliopolis, and more. All of these areas are sprawling with interconnected zones, dungeons, NPCs, sidequests, and collectibles. When in control of Sphinx, you have a simple sword to fight monsters and an energy shield to block projectiles; all other items are for puzzles and progression, or collecting monsters. 

At various intervals in the story you will come across Canopic Vases which hold part of Tutankhamen's soul, which magically teleport to him. The undead mummy, being held in Set's tower, gets his own moments to shine. The Tutankhamen segments are a unique juxtaposition from controlling Sphinx, for there is no combat involved. The game turns into a straight up puzzle platformer which consists of exploring the tower to find important stolen jewels, upgrades, and unique currency to send to Sphinx. The puzzles in these segments start simple but by the end of the game are pretty devious in their complexity. At various places you can find ways to light the mummy on fire, electrocute him, turn him into a flying dragon, etc. All of these are used to alter the environment to get to your end goal, but sometimes the environment will get in your way as well. You can't get through watery areas if you are on fire, or if you are electric. Late in the game you even come across ways to split the mummy into three, which you need to swap between to help solve large puzzles. They're good cerebral moments in the game, offering a nice of accomplishment when you solve the problems at hand. 

The synergy between segments, both in how it progresses gameplay and narrative, while offering refreshing changes of pace is brilliant. On top of that, they both add to the lore of this mythological setting in a way that culminates in a satisfactory way. You don't see many games that explore mythologies of the world in such imaginative ways, that also try to have a serious story in the end.

Now for the negative aspect that comes with games of the early 2000s: the controls. While mostly serviceable, due to the remaster, enough jank is apparent that it needs to be talked about.

Fighting an enemy can be a chore when they are running around you and the camera doesn't know how to adjust properly, or when it literally gets stuck on objects. This is made even worse when you try to collect rare monsters, which is further exacerbated when there are many on screen at once; when three or more enemies are attacking you at once the game simply sucks.  Using the blowpipe with a controller is a pain, as the sensitivity and deadzone makes it too much of a nuisance. For certain situations I had to switch to mouse control, which forced me to turn invert controls on every time: if invert was off, pointing the mouse up would actually move it down. Other issues crop up here and there, like grabbing ziplines and ledges when you know you should, but it's not too bad.  Lastly, all the bosses are quite frankly, awful.

The positive elements of the game really make the negatives easy to bear. The imaginative setting and story, diversity in design, and overall vibes culminate in something that is something to behold. The closest example to Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is Beyond Good & Evil, which ironically came out the same year. And if you can appreciate all that, this game is a 100% recommendation.",1663381469,1663381469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Questo è un gioco che ha fatto parte della mia infanzia che all'epoca avevo abbandonato in quanto non riuscivo a superare un determinato punto. E' stato fantastico una volta ripreso su PC poter superare tale enigma e poter giungere al finale, anch'esso azzeccato e soddisfacente. Da quest'ultimo ho sempre sperato tuttavia in un secondo capitolo, ma credo che non ne vedremo mai la luce! :'(

Detto questo ho notato con piacere come il gioco, con il suo gameplay, non sia invecchiato affatto male, anzi!
E' stato molto divertente e stimolante riprendere un titolo di questo genere con tutti i suoi enigmi a tema egizio in cui dovremo superare ostacoli, intrappolare mostri e progredire con la scoperta dei piani del villain. Fantastico anche dopo quasi 20 anni!

The story is bare bones and uninteresting. It isn't worth paying attention. You switch between two characters Sphinx and Mummy. Sphinx can fight but combat in this dog sh*t game is terrible.

If you count smashing vases as action then we can increase that time. Mummy only solves puzzles which involves getting burned, electrocuted, or flattened, and you use those same gimmicks every level which gets old pretty quickly. The game throws puzzle after puzzle in your way. You go to place and there is a locked door, you try another place and there's an item you need to find, you try another place and the list goes on like that. Enough with this bullsh*t already.

The game throws you in a large area with no sense of direction at all and expects you to find the necessary items and progress without any help at all. Trying to find a small collectible in the corner of a large and multi segmental zone is a pain the as*! Without reading a walkthrough, don't even try to play this game. The platforming is bad because this game has one of the worst cameras ever. It is hard to judge distances, and sometimes your guy won't grab a ledge for no reason. There is also no voice acting, and the levels aren't very interesting. Compare this doney t*rd to Jak & Daxter 2 which is released in 2003 and it fails in every department. Jak & Daxter 2 is how an action platformer game should be. Good voice acting. Decent action mixed with platforming and an engaging story. The sphinx hasn't got a redeeming quality at all.

Something you should know if you ever decide to give this game a shot - there is no autosaving\checkpoints. If you die, you're sent to the last save you made, which can only be done in specific save points. No worries, though, as it's not at all as intimidating as it sounds. There are savepoints pretty regularly and you really get used to saving very quickly. You also don't die so easily. Most of your deaths, if you'll even have any, will come from trial and error of not knowing certain enemies\boss fights beforehand. Most cutscenes are skippable so trying again is as effortless as it can be. Just maintain the habit of going back to a nearby savepoint if you feel like you're dangerously close to death.

There's something oddly comfy about the Egyptian setting in videogames as made in games like Serious Sam TFE, Crash Bandicoot: Warped and others, in a colorful way that's very eyecatching. Sphinx pulls that aesthetic off beautifully.

The puzzles are very fun and interesting, with very few exceptions. The progression is satisfying, which also feeds to how great exploration feels. Sphinx does a great job at making it easy to figure out where you have to go and what you have to do but without flat out handing you the solution.

I'm glad this game has been brought back and updated. The sheer amount of work that has gone into this re-release is incredible. You need only look at the game's patch notes dating back to 2017 to see that this is an effort worth commending.

Playing it now I realized its basically egyptian Legend of Zelda and I love that about it, it gives off Ocarina of Time vibes with creepy ominous whispers in dungeons contrasted with fun happy music in the sun on the beach. There are games to be played and prizes to be won in the city and on the beaches, a museum to collect for using a Pokemon-like creature capture system (which is also used to solve some puzzles with creatures that have special abilities) and tonnes of clay pots to smash and hanging lanterns to whack in exchange for a few coins. There are multiple worldspaces to explore using the zip-line, swimming, bird riding and sprint pad mechanics to get around with ease - and thats just the part where you play as Sphinx! There's a split story line (not unlike how GTA V's story works, just obviously more primitive) where you get to play as a mummy and explore the enemy's castle while solving fun puzzles that will 100% of the time require you to set yourself on fire. By the end of the mummy's level you will have collected a new ability for Sphinx to use so it blends well in terms of progression too. 

The only downside is the common issue of older games where they make you wait a lot, not a big deal to be honest I know I'm impatient but it does sometimes mess up the flow of the game's combat or platforming. Combat can be unforgiving and if you get cocky you'll pay for it, but it can also be rewarding when a creature/item/ability is used properly.

TL;DR
Overall a great game even now almost 20 years later, highly recommend if you enjoyed Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask. Music/Vibes - 10/10. Gameplay - 8/10. Egyptian cat man go brrrrrr

Sphinx propose une petite virée dans l'Égypte mythologique. L'histoire se centre sur le jeune Sphinx, qui se trouve plongé dans une lutte contre Seth, qui a lui même notamment transformé Toutânkhamon en momie. Sphinx va donc, au travers de ses aventures, tâcher d'aider son prochain, de contrecarrer les plans de Seth et d'essayer d'inverser la malédiction qui pèse sur le futur pharaon. 

Le jeu est une sorte d'action/aventure avec quelques éléments d'exploration. 
[b]Le jeu est séparé en deux parties :[/b]
[list] [*] les passages où l'on incarne Sphinx, le personnage principal. 
Ce dernier évolue entre deux zones principales, où certains passages se débloqueront au fur et à mesure de l'histoire et de son avancée. 
Son gameplay est lui même décomposé en plusieurs parties : l'exploration des zones, des mini jeux (tir, course d'obstacles...) et quêtes secondaires dont une sorte de Pokemon like, où il s'agira d'attraper tous les monstres que vous croiserez, les phases de puzzle et les phases de combats. 
Énigmes et combats plutôt bien pensées, avec notamment des combats de boss où il ne suffit pas juste de taper comme un sourd pour l'emporter. 
[*] et ceux où l'on incarne Toutânkhamon, uniquement dans des phases de puzzle, qui sont de manière générale plutôt intéressantes. [/list]

La quête principale alterne donc entre les deux personnages de manière assez fluide.
Les mécaniques ressemblent d'ailleurs beaucoup à Beyond Good and Evil, sur les différentes phases de gameplay.

En revanche, contrairement à ce dernier il a malheureusement quelques faiblesses dont :
[list] [*]la non possibilité de sauvegarder lorsqu'on le souhaite, et pas de checkpoints. La seule possibilité est donc d'aller manuellement devant des balises pour sauvegarder. Sur le principe, pourquoi pas ? Malheureusement, on se retrouve, notamment au début à risquer de recommencer des pans de 15-20 minutes de jeu pour une mauvaise chute, ou un combat à la c**. Alors qu'il aurait juste suffit de créer des checkpoints avant les combats, ou les boss, par exemple, pour résoudre le problème. 
[*] les sauvegardes sont d'ailleurs à l'ancienne avec un emplacement unique. Ce qui veut donc dire : pas de retour en arrière possible. Et forcément, dans ce type de jeu, le risque sans soluce est de passer à côté de certaines choses, notamment secondaires et donc tout  recommencer de zéro si vous vous en rendez compte après coup.
[*]des mécaniques parfois peu claires, notamment au début. 
Du type : un objet qui est censé exploser quelque chose en le déposant sur un pan de mur mais ça ne marche pas - mais en fait ça marche car il fallait décaler ledit objet de 10cm à gauche ; ou une quête qu'on vend comme secondaire - mais qui en fait est juste complètement déterminante pour la suite, puisqu'elle débloque un objet nécessaire pour avancer ; ou la capture des bestioles qui au départ n'est pas forcément super bien expliquée.

Il m'est donc arrivé plusieurs fois d'aller fureter sur le net pour aller comprendre des choses peu claires, là où ça ne m'est jamais arrivé dans Beyond.
[*]et un peu déçu de la fin, sans spoiler, globalement torché en 40 secondes chrono.[/list]

Cependant, je ne lui jette pas la pierre. Datant de 2003, il est juste assez fidèle à son époque dans ses mécaniques et ses faiblesses.

[b]Il reste donc une bonne expérience en termes de jeu d'aventures pour une vingtaine d'heures, avec une ambiance plutôt réussie, et graphiquement largement regardable de nos jours[/b]

[i]PS : et sinon l'acolyte de Seth ressemble à Tournevis dans Astérix et Cléopâtre, et je parle bien entendu du film d'animation.[/i]

I didn't get much in terms of new video games but I did get something that made me feel like a big kid, three Gamecube games rated T for Teen. Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3: Rebel Strike, 007 - Agent Under Fire, and of course, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy. I alternated between the 3 a lot that day and the following ones, giving them their turns in the purple lunchbox out of hype before eventually doing extended sessions with them. I can't recall the events after that, but I know I sat down and jammed with Sphinx for quite awhile eventually. Subsequently completing it for the first time, I thoroughly enjoyed it (though I was stuck at the Uruk Temple for quite a bit trying to figure out the puzzle and hating that were no save points inside so interruptions would cause a progress reset but that didn't hurt my opinion at all) and had replayed it a few times, picking up a few new things along the way, even filling out the museum too. I'd watch the making of now and then and wonder where some of those other places were, being mesmerized by how much depth was here. I even encountered the old Mummy softlock if you saved your game and quit at the wrong time during the second sequence. (bummer)

Though time passes, you move on, discs get worn and torn, and emulation seems a bit out of the way at times, or you just forget. But I'd recall this game every now and then, and eventually I learn it was on Steam, actively supported and ripe for PC gaming. So of course I pounced on buying it when it was on sale for stupid cheap, as it would allow me to own it on a platform where I could play it easily. Looking at its small but heavily dedicated community was sure inspiring and I had played it for a bit before other things sapped my time, outside of an arbitrary bug I had spoken to a developer to the game was the same, but better.

It's Sphinx, just as I remember it. No clutter, supported actively and given a few modern things like resolution improvement and some settings that are tweakable for PC (mods included). If you're interested in a Zelda-like with an Egyptian-mythos flavor, then this will suit you, if you're a returning player, see if it lives up to how you remember it.

To people new to Sphinx: keep in mind this game is from 2003, ported to modern hardware and maintained as such. Aside from the resolution increase/options, cut content being moddable into the PC version (among other mods) and the options given to the PC version, the game is presented as it was back in '03. If you're pining for features you've been spoiled with from larger companies/franchises or from much later video games, this probably won't stomach well for you.",1611302108,1675676686,True,4,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros - Fun world and story, decent platforming and combat challenges, a lot of fun and interesting abilities to unlock, the best mummy in all of video games, genuinely good puzzles for said mummy gameplay.  Great soundtrack.  Cheap as dirt and runs on anything.

Cons - old school camera, old school combat, old school save system.  No voice acting.  It ends on a cliffhanger that will almost certainly never be followed up on.

Never knew about this game as a kid, so I have no nostalgia for this game, and with that I can confidently say this one is a hidden gem.  The game, as is, clearly shows its age and budget, and has some issues that persisted into this port, but it plays to its strengths and is actually pretty ambitious.

I'll get my little nitpicks out of the way first, which really all come down to some quality of life improvements that would be appreciated.  The camera is a bit clunky and has a tendency to run up and get stuck on walls, making platforming in tighter spaces hard to judge, especially with a lack of a shadow to show where you're landing.  The camera is also a bit of a problem when trying to catch monsters, as the camera locks up, and that now controls your capture bug.  While it's nice to be able to move the bug and yourself at the same time in theory, in practice, it makes capturing something mid combat incredibly risky, especially with hard hitting enemies.  Speaking of, Sphinx himself doesn't seem to have much, if any iframes when taking damage, meaning against foes that make multiple attacks at a time, if you get hit, you can take a lot of damage very quickly, leading to a game over and sending you back to your last save.  The save points are also often a bit out of the way in dungeons, and regularly having to save after almost any progress in a dungeon is tedious, and neglecting to do so can loose a lot of progress if you then die later on.  Being able to save from the pause menu would be a very welcome addition.

Also no voice acting, but the game's not dead silent and it clearly wasn't really in the original's budget, so that hardly a nitpick.

Now onto the good shit.  Everything else about this game is incredibly solid.  Combat is fun, the game overall provides a decent challenge, it's surprisingly not hand-holdy, and the soundscape is great.  But the best part of this game are the few Mummy sections.  Several times through the game, you get to play a puzzle section as a charming mummy man.  Being an undead being, Prince Tut cannot be harmed, and the developers run wild this concept.  As the mummy, you ignite, electrify, squish, and chop yourself to get past several obstacles, and it makes for some incredibly unique and fun puzzles.  Honestly, this is something I wish we had more of, and deserves to be its own standalone game, even moreso when with every completed segment, Tut puts on a big, dopey smile, gives a thumbs up to the camera, and the most charming ""Yeah!"" in all of video games, before sauntering away.  For how good the character and puzzles are, its almost a negative how little time you get to spend play as Tut.

So, yeah.  This game deserved way more recognition than it got back when it released, and it's a damn shame it never got a follow up with how much promise and talent this game's mechanics and setting has.  Maybe someday someone will make the mummy puzzle game of my dreams, and the more people that buy this game, the more likely that is to happen.",1610522836,1610522836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I originally had it on PS2 but did not play very much of it. I believe it was because I did not understand the game well when I was younger so I could not appreciate the puzzles. I do appreciate the art and aesthetics of this game and what it was trying to convey. A platforming and puzzle game that is worth the time put into it. I love the Mummy sections (except that pentagram puzzle). The Mummy has so much character and then with each special ability he gets there is a different music track for it. There are so many great ideas in this game that I wish I saw in more games. I am kind of disappointed this game didn’t get a sequel and that not many people probably know about this game in general. 
I must admit there are some wonky game mechanics that could be improved or just little changes that would make it over all more enjoyable. For example, when selling monsters in the Monster Shop to be able to sell multiple instead of one at a time and going through all the dialogue every time. Also, when doing some of the time trials on Heliopolis it would have been better to see the timer or some indication on how you were doing. One has to keep in mind that this was originally a PS2 game released in 2003 so there is no autosave and you cannot rotate saves. 
The combat can be a little frustrating since there is no lock on. You really have to work the camera in this game at points. The camera does not go through objects/walls either so that can hinder you in a couple of places, but the game is playable and completable.

Very solid game, fair balance of platforming and puzzles to keep it from growing stale. 
I really liked how they take advantage of their characters to certain puzzles and ideas and make it seem natural.
I thought I would hate the mummy sections but they have some nice thought into them and the Mummy has some charming animations which makes him one of my favourites.

Any issues I have had so far the developers are still active on the forums to help out and try to help you with so kudos to them for still caring about the game! Would love to see a squeal to this because much more could easily be added/done.


I am disappointed some characters just disappear from the story and never given a reason why, you either assume they were killed or just became so unimportant they had no use for them. Kinda sucks for those wanting closure on some of them.



- Music often cuts out
- A few bugs/glitches
- Missable achievements


Music will often disappear, making me have to exit the game completely and reboot it for it to come back, not really stopping you from playing but can take you out of the game to near nothing but the sound effects. Some sound effects will also overlap each other constantly and not go away which is more annoying than no music, again you need to reopen the game to get rid of this or mute the sounds.

I did run into a bug/glitch or two that either stopped me progressing or just killed me, one being after a cutscene, something that was meant to appear did not, lucky a save point was just used so nothing really lost but you cannot skip the cutscenes so this can be an issue.
Another bug caused me to be unable to swim underwater but be stuck at the bottom of the water (this was due to somehow I slammed down into the water, slide across the wall and it put me in my walking animation) This caused me to game-over so bewarned to save often to not lose a good chunk of progress.

Lastly, around 5 achievements are missable, 2 are at the start of the game so not too hard to get but one you can easily miss without a guide and I can see this being annoying having to restart from scratch and redo everything just because you missed one thing you couldn't return to in the story.


Overall it is a solid game but you have to remember it is a 2003 game and I say it has aged well, the models still look ok and the environments look lovely to just run around in.",1598646785,1598648698,True,6,0,0.578661322593688965,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The two characters are different and fun to play, the world is nice to explore and the puzzles are quite interesting.
Everything is a bit rough of course, it's an old game. The camera can especially be frustrating, especially during the (short) platform sections.
But I can't recommend this game because of its save system. The save points can be very long to reach and losing your last live means that you return to your previous save.
This is maybe how it worked at the time but in our days it feels really dumb. I finished a 45 minutes dungeon  without any save point accessible, then went back to the world and died by drowning, just because I wanted to explore. I was very sad to respawn at the beginning of the dungeon that I just finished, having to do all over again. Needless to say, I stopped playing on the spot.
So this game does not respect the player's time, so that's a major no-go for me.

The graphics at the time were pretty to look at, the gameplay was overall fun, the story was engaging enough and easy to follow, and overall I just greatly enjoyed it.  My only critique against it was that the ending was pretty bad and seemed like it was going to try setting up for a sequel that never ended up happening.

The Steam/GoG version emphasizes what I like about the game.  The soundtrack is still pretty awesome to listen to, the gameplay is still overall fine (though I do dislike that it was built more around a controller...unfortunately you learn trying to play with a keyboard that the game doesn't feel right without a controller), and on top of that the HD sharpening and whatnot just really shows how well the graphics still hold up in my personal opinion.  They didn't go for complete realism, but they also didn't go the cell shaded route and went more for an in the middle cartoon-ish CG type of look, and it actually still looks pretty good today.  Not ""Wow"" worthy compared to newer games, but I'd still place it in the same category as, say, Kingdom Hearts when the 1.5 HD collection came out.  The graphics still look phenomenal even compared to games from the PS3-X360 era, and it easily looks like it could have been released around that time as opposed to the PS2 days.  Hell, this could release on the newer consoles and I'd be okay, because it looks like a remaster that could easily do well on the PS4 or Xone.

But this is also because the game just runs so much smoother as well, which lets everything show itself off without the stutter and sluggishness from a lower framerate which the PS2 was known for (though it looked and played fine on the Gamecube).  I always love seeing an older game I remember being shown more of its potential in looks alone when they're able to get into that higher FPS and make everything run that much smoother.

Overall...is part of my excitement for this game nostalgia? Absolutely.  It brings back some great memories of games from back in the day when they first released, like Okami (another game that got a great HD remake), Sly Cooper, and various others.

Não fosse eu ter um disco aleatório de demos da PS2 há 30 anos atrás, não teria sequer ideia de que o jogo existe. Mas eu tinha o tal disco, e consequentemente, reconheci o dito jogo quando o vi nos saldos do Steam. E esta é a história de ""How I met your mummy"".

O primeiro aspecto positivo que quero realçar é o design das personagens. São fixes e são memoráveis. Afinal de contas, o jogo persistiu na minha memória desde a era da PS2. Havia vários outros jogos de plataformas com mascotes, e então era natural que o Sphinx, com a sua cara de bad boy rebelde que não acaba os legumes ao jantar e que tira dois pacotes de leite com chocolate no final do recreio, em vez do um a que tem direito, não tenha tido tanta popularidade como os Ratchets ou os Marios, seus contemporâneos.

Note-se, então, que esta versão é um ligeiro remaster dessas versões da década passada. É compatível com comando XBox One, felizmente. Tem achievements, e aumenta a resolução dos modelos e das texturas, mas nota-se perfeitamente que o esqueleto é antigo.

E por falar em esqueleto antigo! Este jogo desenrola-se no antigo Egipto. Tem dois protagonistas: um jovem com cauda de leão chamado Sphinx e um outro rapaz que fica transformado numa múmia amaldiçoada.
Acho um bocado estranho que, no jogo todo, ninguém comente sobre o nome dele... ""Prazer em conhecê-lo, Sphi... Espera lá, Sphinx, tipo esfinge? Tipo aqueles monumentos? E aquele é o teu amigo Pirâmide, ou quê?"". Acho que poderia ter havido mais esforço no nome, pronto.

Quanto ao jogo em si, é do género CAIRO (Characters Acting Independently but Rotating Occasionally), e é sobretudo feito de plataformas, exploração, combate assim-assim, e elementos de Metroidvania ou RPG-à-la-Zelda, em que novas habilidades desbloqueadas ao longo do jogo abrem novos caminhos ou níveis inteiros.

A história é um bocado dramática, e obviamente o mauzão é o deus Set, mas felizmente não se leva demasiado a sério. Normalmente os vilões querem dominar o mundo, destrui-lo ou uni-lo. Mas aqui, o Nilo é apenas um rio!
 
As missões vão alternando entre os protagonistas, que têm estilos de jogo bastante distintos.
Os níveis com o Sphinx têm combate, exploração, diálogos e um mundo mais ou menos aberto. Os níveis com a múmia são à base de puzzles. A múmia é basicamente um zombie imortal, e para resolver os puzzles temos de nos incinerar para destruir obstáculos, electrificar para activar mecanismos, ou ser esmagados por uma pedra gigante ao ponto de ficarmos 2D, para passar por entre grades.
É divertido e, parece-me, bastante original.

As missões (ou capítulos) são relativamente longas e alternam seguindo uma ordem linear, ou seja, não é estilo co-op nem em tempo semi-real como o GTA5. Os dois protagonistas vão lentamente cooperando à distância para proteger o mundo da devastação.

A propósito, há um elemento particularmente interessante, que é a possibilidade de capturar e usar monstros em combate. Como se fossem, digamos... monstros... de bolso! Usando escaravelhos de captura, podemos coleccionar os inimigos que combatemos ao longo do jogo. Se o Pokémon já tem pontos de moralidade questionáveis, então aqui é como se as pokébolas também fossem seres vivos!

Seja como for, capturar os inimigos tem duas vantagens. Uma é que podemos doar espécimes ao museu, em troca de recompensas. Outra é que podemos usá-los em combate ou para encontrar segredos. Por exemplo, um dos bichos é o ""Fire Armadillo"", que, depois de capturado, pode ser usado para destruir obstáculos de madeira com as suas chamas. Sucede que ele depois explode e falece, mas enfim, sempre podemos voltar e capturar mais dos seus familiares, portanto não faz mal...
Antes de acabar o jogo fiz questão de capturar todos os bichos e completar o meu Pokédex. Acho que foi uma sidequest interessante.

I grew up with it. I'm very happy to see it remastered on steam for PC, now I can hold on to it forever.  I used to originally play this game on the PS2 10-15 years ago. If anyone has good memories playing this game when it first came out, I would totally recommend buying this 100%. It's amazing to see this game still alive on PC with HD graphics. It even got a port to the Nintendo Switch!

This game has a great ancient Egyptian mythology setting with it's own unique lore and concepts.  They even have locations named after real life Egyptian cities. Heliopolis was a real city. Abydos is a real city still standing today. One of the Jewelry exhibits mentioned the location of Thebes. The plot involved ancient Egyptian cultural names, references, gods, and creatures such as Osiris, Set, Anubis, Sphinx, Imhotep, and Horus.

I just wish they made a sequel for this game. The developers obviously intended for a sequel to close the story. The ending was left on a cliff hanger. I won't spoil the ending but they made it so that it was set up for a sequel. But it seems that the game was not commercially successful enough for a sequel. I hope that someone could at least revive the concept of capturing monsters along with the Egyptian mythology theme. Getting to find, hunt, capture, buy, sell, donate, and collect monsters is such a great gameplay concept. I hope they can at least bring this concept back on a next-gen console game. Or maybe they came remake this game and it's concepts on a future console. 

There are a few things the original vanilla game could have improved upon: a lack of voice acting, a lack of meaningful protagonist dialogue, sometimes it isn't obvious on what to do next so if you don't know what you are doing then you might get stuck on a puzzle. I can imagine a lot of people did not finish this game originally when it came out because they got stuck on an area/puzzle and could not figure out what to do because there were no good in-game hints.  There is a part in the game where you are supposed to buy a monster from a shop in Abydos and then donate it to the museum in order to further progress in the game and story, yet there are absolutely no hints at all that the player is supposed to do this. You're just going to have to figure it out on your own along with many other things.

As for the port itself, the game was upgraded with High Definition graphics so now it looks better than ever! There is so much more detail in the textures now, it looks beautiful. In some settings you can see the light beams shining into palaces and in other settings in the distance you can see pyramids. However, the high level of graphics causes the game to freeze quit frequently, and this is not typical on my PC as it runs other next-gen games on 11 GB of RAM very smoothly. If the game is laggy, just crank down the graphic settings in the menu and/or adjust the resolution. Also, there is a glitch for the soundrack music in the background. Sometimes after an hour or two of playing the game the music soundtrack in the background will will stop playing and it will sometimes have weird audio noises and hiccups. It does not stop the progress of the game but it is annoying enough to make me quit then restart the game. The vibe of the game really dies down if the music in the background stops playing. Other than that this is a great port that lets me relive this game!",1592067394,1592067394,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The reviews were so positive and an early 2000 3d adventure game i was expecting crash or spyro or jak and dexter, ratchet and clank, etc. Boy was I wrong. First off, theres such a bare bones and uninteresting story it wasn't even worth paying attention to after the first 30 minutes. You switch between two characters. First off the guy that can fight, the combat sucks, you only have 1 attack so you just mash that. Then the other guy only solves puzzles which involves getting burned, electricuted, or flattened, and you use those same gimmicks every level which gets old. Most of the puzzles are overly tedious, convoluted and just not interesting or inventive but have a ton of steps that need to be done in 1 specific order. Other parts involve finding 1 small collectible in 1 corner of the very large and multi segmental zone without any waypoints, map, or any clues leading to a definite need for walkthrough unless you want to wander around forever unsure of what to do or where to go. 

The platforming is bad because this game has one of the worst cameras ever, and with the 3d and bad camera it is hard to judge distance, and sometimes your guy wont grab a ledge for no reason. Theres also no voice acting, and the levels arent very interesting. Theres just nothing fun or worthwhile to do here. Just solve annoying tedious puzzles for the sake of it and mash attack.

No voy a hablar de él comparándolo con títulos actuales puesto que seria injusto, si no comparandolo con los de su misma época.

Hablamos de un juego original que entra por la visto por su ambientación y sus protagonistas, pero no es oro todo lo que recluce. Sphinx es un juego mediocre en sus combates, en sus secciones de plataformas y en sus puzles que muchas veces caes en lo tedioso. Repito eso si lo comparo con juegos de su mismo estilo y de su misma época. Star fox adventures es más o menos igual de antiguo y siendo un juego de aventuras en 3d le da mil patadas a Sphinx en absolutamente todo y por mucho.

Significa eso que Sphinx es totalmente insastisfactorio? pues no, el juego tiene sus bondades, y pese a sus defectos logra entretener. Pero solo recomiendo su compra si te apetece mucho rememorar viejos tiempos y ya has jugado a practicamente todos los títulos simiares. Si no, hay muchas mejores opciones, Psychonauts por ejemplo es una gran alternativa de este género en pc sin necesidad de tirar de emulador.

This game brings back so many childhood memories. My biggest question is WHERE IS THE 2ND GAME!!! A second game needs to be made. Alright enough ranting for part 2 let's get into the review. 

Let's start with the pros:

- Beautiful graphics
- Very solid story line
- Simple and easy controls
- Not too difficult (Gameplay wise)
- Excellent music
- Very fun overall

Now for the cons
- Very short (Completed it in almost less then 12 hours)
- Very little to no voice acting
- Not enough quests or things to do
- Weapon/item selection is very limited
- Lore is very weak

For the cons here is my reasoning:

""Very short"" if you really focus on the main story and don't do anything else, you can easily beat this game in about 12 hours or less. If you want to 100% the game, about 13 hours or more.

""Very little to no voice acting"" the game depends on very heavy dialogue reading, some of the characters make specific noises but all of it is reading.

""Not enough quests/things to do"" what I mean by this is the game is very limited when it comes to fun things to do. There are four different mini games that can all be beaten in less then an hour. And you can fill the museum with monsters and jewels (the jewels are story based). Essentially, there are little quests that you can do but they rely on moving forward with the story.

""Weapon/Item selection is very limited"" all the items in the game have some sort of a connection with the story (obviously), but there are really no items that you can get for fun. There are no other weapons that you can acquire but aren't necessary to acquire. There are no items that are just there for fun.

""Lore is very weak"" this one is kind of obvious. What do we know about Sphinx? (other than he is a demi-god) who are his parents? Where did he come from? How did he become part of the prophecy? It's little things like that is what puts character depth into a game and makes it more worth investing in if we know who we are playing as rather than knowing that his only main purpose is too destroy evil.


And that's the end of this review. Overall this is a super fun game, I have only had this game for a few days and I already beat it twice.

Nel complesso il gioco non presenta un elevato livello di sfida, ma è molto divertente, si lascia giocare anche se il gameplay, per certi aspetti, è ciò che più di tutto sente il peso degli anni (stiamo comunque parlando di un action-adventure del 2003) ma gli enigmi sono abbastanza soddisfacenti.

Originally a console game, it was intended with a controller in mind. The controls for KB + M are actually fine for the most part, but in order to remap the keys you'll have to go within the files and do so manually, playing around and learning how to edit a .ini file.

There's not much of a story to the game, though what is interesting is that there are 2 protagonists; however, you're mainly using the first one you play as.
The first character's story just boils down to him happening to be the good guy who gets stuff done and is strong enough to beat the bad guys. Story NPC says they need something, hero gets thing and the NPC happens to have something important that progresses the journey as a reward.
The other character is very different; he's a prince who was killed off and comes back to life as a mummy to help out the first character through puzzle solving in a cartoon-y & slapstick manner.

The combat is very barebones when you're actually fighting; even the 4 boss fights aren't really anything too amazing either.

The pacing for the game isn't very good. 
The first part of the game takes an extremely long time before you have to fight the first boss of the game, which marks the end of the first chapter. Afterwards, it suddenly speeds up and before you know it you're already fighting the 3rd boss.

The puzzles are the highlight of the game and they're actually pretty good for the most part, at least in the sense that you just have to remember the tools available to you in order to get through something and have a memory for where particular objects are located. They're not difficult exactly, but it still feels nice when you solve something.
There are some secrets in this game, and what may constitute as a ""secret"" in a modern game is likely a required thing to find in this game in order to progress; in other words, being observant is just as important as puzzle solving.
Actual secret rewards, however, aren't really any more special than health upgrades.

The game seems to have just been ported to PC with only making it run on modern hardware properly in mind as a lot of features in the game are very outdated and limited. The only technical issues I've come across is a repeating music clip bug.

Sphinx plays somewhat like one of the N64 Zelda games, except with some precision platforming.
The developers of the port have increased the resolution of most of the textures in the game (there were two that were pretty blurry), so the game looks pretty nice. Of course the levels are pretty sparse since they were designed for more limited systems.
There is no voice acting in the game at all, not even Rare-style gibberish, so it is a fairly quiet game. The music is Egyptian-themed of course, but there isn't that much of it. What there is isn't grating or anything though, it's good enough that I didn't feel the need to plaster my ears shut.
Gameplay consists of some combat, some platforming and a fair bit of puzzle solving.
The first two parts (and indirectly the third) are hampered by what is every 3D platformer's greatest enemy: the camera.
If you're familiar with the N64's C-Stick camera in a lot of 3rd person games, it's similar in this game.
You can somewhat freely turn it around, but it will also often stop turning as if it's run into a wall.
And the game will often take control of it and change it, sometimes positioning it in the sky above you or facing you or wherever.
This can make combat and platforming more frustrating than it needs to be. 
In combat a lot of the enemies use some form of charge or jump move to avoid being hit and/or hitting you.
This makes the camera control very important to keep track of them, but as mentioned it's not great and won't always cooperate with the player. I did quite a lot of swinging my sword around blindly in the hopes of hitting something.
Platforming is already tricky since platforms often have some issue with their bounding box which makes the edges somewhat slippery and because jumping is somewhat influenced by momentum. Meaning you can jump further with a running start, although this is also a bit finicky.
Combine this with a camera that isn't great and you've got some frustrating jumps.

There are two playable characters with different play styles, which is interesting.
Sphinx has the more traditional action-based puzzle platforming sections, while the Mummy has more logic-based puzzle platforming sections. 
There are a lot of timed sections in the puzzles unfortunately (unless you like this obviously).
Especially in the Mummy's sections where he can acquire certain abilities for an amount of time which he loses when he acquires another ability or touches liquids.  I personally found this to lead to a quite a bit of frustration since I would have to reacquire said abilities often and this usually meant having to backtrack and watch an animation of him getting the ability over and over again.

The game relies on save points in order to save and these can often be spaced quite far apart. 
Usually you'll have to complete a whole puzzle platforming action section (say 15-30 minutes depending on how you do) before you can save. 

All in all, I enjoyed my time with Sphinx. I actually had a copy back in the day, but never finished it so I'm glad someone took the time to port it to PC.
I had fun with the two protagonists and their different play styles and the game is of a decent length.
So I would recommend it if you like 3D action puzzle platformers and can deal with the clunkiness of a game that was designed many years ago. It does end on a bit of a cliffhanger though and they never made any sequels as far as I'm aware.

Iniziando a giocarci ho notato subito che è un porting (presumo quindi fosse originariamente uscito su console)  del gioco originale , ma a parte qualche modifica per renderlo funzionante sui sistemi più moderni  e qualche ritocco grafico  , non è stato toccato altro .

Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is an amazing game that deserves more praise and recognition.

Graphics: The graphics are colorful, vivid, and really charming. The game is more cartoon focused so don't expect realistic graphics. Plus, this game was originally for PS2, Gamecube and Xbox so it's an older title. Nevertheless, the visuals are beautiful. The amazing art inspired by ancient Egyptian civilization is a wonder to stare at.

Story: The story is amazing. Although there is no voice acting, much like Zelda games, the game tells a great story through dialogue. I won't spoil anything but everything is explained very well and it's all very interesting. The story has an amazing pace and is very original.

Gameplay: The gameplay is almost perfect. The combat is pretty smooth and the platforming is fun, easy and satisfying. Additionally, the puzzles are amazing and cleverly made. The game offers plenty to do with collectibles, mini games and entertaining sidequests. The only issue I had was the camera occasionally getting stuck at an angle that didn't let me see what I was doing. Also, enemies sometimes have ridiculous hit boxes that end up hurting or killing you when they really shouldn't have. But these are very small issues that don't affect the overall gameplay experience. I recommend a controller. 

Sound: The sounds are fantastic and the music is beautiful and memorable. I honestly was surprised by how much I loved the soundtrack. The sound and music fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly.

Verdict: 9.8

Truly an amazing  game. The visuals are fantastic, the sound/music is expertly crafted, the story is great and the gameplay is almost perfect. What a shame that this game didn't sell well back in its time, otherwise we would have had a sequel. Even after 25 hours of playing, I still wanted more. The full price is completely worth it. If you like Zelda, Mario or Crash Bandicoot, do yourself a favor and get this game.

+The concept and world is wholly unique
+The type of game-play in Sphinx is probably the closest we'll ever get to having a perfect Zelda adventure that isn't Zelda
+The mummy segments were really fun puzzle dungeons
+Graphics were top notch and still look great despite being around 15+ years old
+A lot of the faults you'll have with this game are due to it being earlier in the 6th generation of consoles

But there are minor faults

-This game isn't super polished (I heard it was worse when it was first ported to Steam); it's probably about 80% of the way there.  I'm speaking particularly about the platforming, because it needs tweaking
-The story could've been more compelling and interesting
-Sphinx NEVER changes that weird grin on his face the entire game
-There are audio issues and on top of that the music wasn't much to write home about
-The world is great, but the magic of Egyptian landscapes and ancient temples does wear off; a little more variety in atmosphere would've gone a long way, because most of the game feels very samey
-The combat is really bad and I just never got why the game is littered with so many pointless enemy encounters

Despite these complaints I highly recommend Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy; it's fun, and has some incredibly interesting game design that makes it stand apart from any other game.  I REALLY hope Sphinx get's a revival via a sequel - I think that now having somewhat of a cult-status following, making a second installment with improvements would have great sales if done right.  THQ, PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL TO SPHINX!!!

* Sphinx feels slow and unsatisfying to move and control (the game's framerate is fine; he just moves at a turtle's pace)
* Jak is snappy, moves fast and is satisfying to control.

* Sphinx's combat feels equally sluggish. You spend the first 20-30 minutes of the game laboriously throwing fucking rocks. C'mon!
* Jak's combat feels nice and is, once again, snappy, as it implements a simple melee fighting system with interesting enemies. Oh, and there's the eco, too. Different eco gives you different powerups.

* Sphinx's tutorial stage is just awful. I haven't been this bored by a tutorial since Runescape.
* Jak and Daxter starts you out in an interesting area that swiftly teaches you the mechanics of the game without being overbearing.

* The enemies are boring. The first couple enemies consist of exploding flowers, exploding frogs, eyeballs on sticks that lock the gates if they see you (trust me, it's not as cool as it sounds), and spiders. 
* Jak and Daxter has Lurkers. They're like a whole civilization of varied purple animal people with their own rudimentary technology. <3 lurkers.

* Sphinx implements game overs and will literally take you back all the way to the save point (or beginning of game) upon death. Not only are the save points few and far between, but the game doesn't even telegraph this fact correctly, because you can fall into death pits or lava and go back to a checkpoint just like in Jak and Daxter. But if you take too much damage, for some stupid reason, you get to *slowly* sit through a game over screen, and have a shit load of progress sucked away. This is not good design.
* Jak and Daxter (and all of the later games in its franchise) does not implement game over. If you die, whether by taking too much damage, by falling to your death, getting scorched by lava, blown up, falling in a pit of dark eco, etc, you will respawn at the last check point.. You will never randomly ""die for real"" and get sent back to a save point, as there are no save points in J&D.

The deal breaker is definitely the slow everything. Slow gameplay is boring gameplay. Fast, tight or self-paced (e.g. turn-based combat) gameplay is always better.

You can't say that I've never played and enjoyed 3D retro platformers, because J&D, a game that is simply better in every respect, came out in 2002, a year before this game.

Eurocom, take some notes from Naughty Dog, please.

--

So would I recommend this game? Absolutely not. In fact, fuck it, this is now a review for Jak and Daxter.

Jak and Daxter is an amazing and quirky 3D platformer lite-collect-a-thon game where you play as Jak. During a trek in a forbidden zone, Jak and Daxter run into some baddies and Daxter falls into a pit of dark eco, turning him into a furry little otter/weasel hybrid dubbed an 'ottsel'. Daxter gets over it pretty quickly, but they get reprimanded by the sage of green eco, and embark on a quest to turn Daxter back to his human form. During their quest, they run into lots of charming and quirky characters who offer rewards in return for favors in a charming fantasy world.

Thanks to a bevy of visual upgrades and careful engine rewrites, we're left with something more stable than a good number of triple-A ports in recent years. 

The game itself is split between Zelda-esque Sphinx sections and the more puzzle-oriented Mummy sections, switching back and forth as the story demands. Thankfully the majority of puzzles are environmental or timing-based, with block pushing kept to a minimum. There isn't any sort of lock-on for combat in this game, so they compensated by giving Sphinx massive, over-exaggerated swings. It works pretty well and feels similar to using the wrench against trash mobs in a Ratchet game or something.
Overall it's [i]way[/i] better than it was ever given credit for. I remember walking into a Gamestop back in the day and seeing 10 copies in the bargain bin. That was over 10 years ago, and it's only just recently started to receive attention. You'd think this was Anubis II or something. 

Two big visual highlights are probably the animations and environments. The environments have really cool color palettes (which range from soothing purples to bright yellow) and are absolutely massive in scale which, unfortunately, also means frequent loading zones (though this isn't much of an issue on modern PCs). The animations just stood out to me as really fluid and detailed for the era.

A few complaints would be that the menus are somewhat barebones and there isn't an easy way to rebind your controls ingame, as well as the fact that a few visual effects from the PS2 version are still missing since they used very specific hardware tricks to pull them off (though the developer's working to add them back in). IIRC that's also the reason why they weren't in the XBox release, which is the version this port is based off of.

I'm glad this game was brought back to Steam and revamped it, in a way. A nice new retexturing, the bugs have all been fixed, however this game is not as good as I remember.
The combat is very repetitive and the game has an outdated game development. By that I mean, this game was developed in a time where checkpoints were not commonplace and neither was fast travel. There is some backtracking that comes with this practice, unfortunately. 
Besides that, the boss fights are where the game drops off a bit. They're repetitive, sometimes frustrating, sometimes boring, fights that aren't really all that satisfying. There's only a small handful, 3 I think, so it's not too bad. Just make sure you saved beforehand. 
However, the game has a lot of personality and soul to it. The npcs are charming, as are the enemies. The game looks and feels like there was a lot of effort put into it, the only thing it's missing is quality-of-life tweaks.

THE GOOD: Seems like a bit of a Zelda clone on the surface, and definitely took influence from it's world stucture/puzzles. However, if it is a Zelda clone, it's by far the best one. The overworld is small but extremely memorable, and constantly expanding as the character gains new abilities. The puzzles, specifically the mummy levels, are awesome and the platforming as Sphinx feels smoother than any zelda game I've played. The actual moveset given to sphinx is fairly limited, but the variety of enemies mixed with their unique attacks and weaknesses makes fights feel very engaging in harder segments. The music is suberb, the artstyle is beautiful and the game looks great to me even today. It's a game you can tell the developers were passionate about, and for them to release a port of this quality for long time fans is a beautiful thing.

The Bad: There are no keybind options in the menu, remapping the keyboard is extremely hard to do. The default controls aren't unusable but could definitely be better. Uncapped frame rate seems to cause slight physics issues (Gauntlet 3 is practically impossible). Save points act as checkpoints, and are very poorly placed. There is a fair amount of VSYNC but not unplayable. Unksippable cutscenes. No voice acting (Personal Preferences)

Anything bad about this game is extremely minor in my opinion.

I purchased it as soon as i saw it on the first day it was released. The gameplay is good and fun. there are unique features that still hold up to this day. The soundtrack is awesome (maybe thats more nostalgia for me). The sphinx gameplay is largely different from the tut gameplay which really helps add variety to the game. The graphics still hold up too (in a nintendo sort of way).. But even better, the awesome group who ported the game over are also restoring the game and modernizing it. They have slowly been implementing fixes for bugs even from the original console version, they are updating and adding in new textures to make the game feel younger than it really is, and they are attempting to create a workshop section so other players can mod and create their own content.

I would have been happy even with the old game but never thought I would see a remaster as THQ & Eurocom were defunct.

Now, coming to the game, I only played for a while and I am pleased to say that I still love the game. The textures are really nice. The game works smoothly on my FX 6300 & Nvidia 760.

The game recommends a controller (rightly so) but the game is playable with the keyboard as well.

WSAD for direction. Tab to Interact. Esc to crawl. F for the fight. Spacebar to jump. Direction keys for selecting various items.

Overall, highly recommend to fans & New to the series. The game is a Platformer + Zelda type puzzle solving game. Music is fabulous and suits the theme of the game amazingly.

This version of the game runs buttery smooth and they also fixed a huge game-breaking bug that was present on the console versions. I only encountered 2 glitches in my playthrough both of which were fixed with a loading screen.

[h1]Short Review[/h1]
This a great platformer that focuses mostly on puzzles and has a bit of combat. There are some annoying features like the lack of checkpoints and the unnecessarily large overworld, but it is otherwise an enjoyable and simple game with an Egyptian theme. So if you like platformers and Egypt give this one a try.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Although this is a platformer you don't really do that much platforming in this game, instead you will spend most of your time, solving puzzles. You take control of 2 characters, Sphinx and Tut. Sphinx plays similarly to a Zelda game, meaning you will have some basic combat and platforming and a lot of dungeons that use one specific mechanic to solve them. That is one problem of the game however, since the abilities you get are almost never put to use after getting through their dungeon. A great example is the bouncing darts which you have to use only once in the entire game.

The second character you play as is Tut the mummy. His gameplay is based entirely on puzzle solving but his puzzles have a nice twist. Since he is already technically dead he can't die agaub, so you can set him on fire, electrocute him etc. in order to solve puzzles. The game can get creative with it and his puzzles are very interesting. I do wish they had some really challenging puzzles considering how many interesting things you can do with the mechanics but alas the puzzles are overall kept simple.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Considering the game came out in 2003 it looks absolutely incredible. The character models, in particular, are very well made with some crisp textures. Since the game takes place entirely in Egypt I thought it would get boring with similar environments, but the artists did a great job of differentiating every area and keeping it interesting. The soundtrack is nothing mind-blowing but it was fitting and enjoyable to listen, I do wish however that the game had some voiceover because the characters do talk a lot but it is just text. Because of that everyone is really animated which gives the game a lot of personality.

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
In the end, I definitely recommend this game to people that love puzzle-platformers for sure. I do have to warn you though the game has a very lackluster ending with a huge cliffhanger that never got resolved since the game didn't sell all that well.",1547987934,1615737320,True,13,1,0.681053221225738525,0,False,False,False,False,,,

No es que abunden los juegos inspirados en el Antiguo Egipto, más allá de las excavaciones de Lara Croft, Pharaon y quizás uno de los últimos Assassin´s Creed, así que el momento histórico y ambientación ya es un punto a favor en el juego. La historia gira en torno a la eterna lucha entre el bien y el mal, algo recurrente, y que se desarrolla desde tiempos inmemoriales y parece seguirá hasta el final de los tiempos; en este caso el bien encarnado por Osiris, y el mal encarnado por Set, el juego nos pone en la piel de Sphinx (y Tuthankamon, del que luego hablaré), un aprendiz de Imhotep que debe ayudar a Annubis y convertirse en el elegido de la profecía de Ra, y así salvar el mundo. Típico argumento de elegidos, con los dioses y algunos faraones egipcios como actores secundarios. 

Estamos ante un juego de plataformas, por lo que se hace imprescindible el uso del mando para mejorar sensiblemente la experiencia de juego, una vez adaptado, las teclas son fáciles de asimilar, pues no hay demasaiada complejidad. Aunque los comienzos del juego pueden resultar desoladores pues no podremos hacer gran cosa y será lineal, cuando salimos de la especie de tutorial el juego comenzará a mostrar su potencial, con tres grandes zonas a explorar y dentro de estas sus llamémoslas ""mazmorras"", en este sentido recuerda bastante a la saga Zelda, tanto por el sistema de manejo como por la forma de interactuar a través de los escenarios. La ambientación es agradable a la vista, con bonitos templos antiguos, una ciudad, playas, parcos en detalles eso sí, pero lo compensa con el buen rendimiento que ofrece y la interesante paleta de colores elegida.

A medida que avancemos, se nos abrirán nuevas posibilidades, ya sea realizando quest secundarias, buscando secretos por los escenarios, o realizando pruebas de habilidad, entre otras, cada logro nos otorgará mejoras en nuestra salud, inventario, nuevas habilidades, acceso a nuevas zonas; si estáis acostumbrados a este tipo de juegos todo os resultará bastante familiar en su desarrollo. Aquí nos vamos moviendo por el escenario abierto, y cuando nos asignen una misión, se nos abrirá alguna mazmorra, llena de enemigos pintorescos, y obstáculos a superar; hay mucho plataformeo en el juego, sin llegar a niveles de frustración absurdos, algunas se nos pueden atascar más que otras, sobretodo si hay tiempo de por medio, los puzzles poseen cierta complejidad en su desarrollo, y no suele ser obvia la solución hasta haber explorado a conciencia los escenarios. En cuanto a los citados enemigos, son animales equipados con armamento de diversos tipos, originales, aunque fáciles de superar y escasos. También existen varios jefes finales, igualmente sencillos de vencer. Contamos tan solo con una espada y nuestra habilidad para superarlos...suficiente. Los personajes secundarios tampoco aportan gran cosa, están por exigencias del guión, debes ayudarlos para continuar la historia o para que te den objetos, o incluso comprar equipamiento.

La otra parte del juego es El Castillo de Uruk, donde manejaremos a Tuthankamón, una momia que debe recuperar su esencia vital poco a poco; son las partes más divertidas y delirantes del juego, pues no puede morir, así que puede chamuscarse para quemar madera que impida el paso, electrificarse para llevar corriente o dividirse para trabajar en equipo, aquí son los puzzles los que deberemos resolver, apartados de la lucha de Sphinx, y utilizando el sigilo para pasar desapercibido de algunos enemigos. Son fases bastante divertidas a la par que frustrantes en ocasiones, hay que tener muy claro el paso siguiente pues si vamos a ciegas no sabremos que hacer: exploración a conciencia del escenario, buscar todos los elementos con los que poder interactuar y pensar con lógica.

Las pruebas de habilidad son divertidas de realizar, todas con tiempo cronometrado, pruebas de memoria, acertar con la cerbatana, pruebas de velocidad, habilidad, todas con la lógica recompensa al conseguirlas. En el menú podremos ver en todo momento los objetos de la misión, los trofeos conseguidos, los monstruos capturados (sí, tiene ciertos momentos Pokemon el juego, imprescindibles para avanzar), o las misiones asignadas. Correctos en este sentido, sin destacar.

En cuanto a nivel sonoro, los sonidos son parcos y normalitos, no existen voces en el juego, tan solo leves quejidos y gruñidos animales. Lo que sí es de elogiar es su banda sonora, todas con claras melodías inspiradas en el Antiguo Egipto, con sus estilos propios; a veces existen ciertos problemas o conflictos con el sonido, puede dejar de escucharse la música o entrecortarse, basta con reiniciar el juego. 

En definitiva, muy buen juego de plataformas, bastante adictivo, aunque pueda parecer algo desfasado lo compnesa con algunos puzzles interesantes y buen ritmo general del juego, nunca cansa y el hecho de jugar con dos personajes muy diferentes le aporta variedad, aderezándolo con una gran banda sonora.

Fairly short in a casual run ~14 hours
Requires backtracking several times but has semi-fast travel options through cheap boat rides

I grew up with this game and played originally on the GameCube, ""borrowing"" my Mother's saves whenever she passed an area that I wasn't able to complete and continuing from there. I still remember the first time I managed to take down Set. I was so happy and proud of my accomplishment I actually stayed on the final dialogue in order to show my Mother that I had finally beaten one of my video game experiences ever! My first playthrough wasn't the most complete or ""honest"" but I still enjoyed the game and went back for another round shortly after. 

The game has two different protagonists that play very differently from one another. You have Sphinx, the double-jumping, sword-swinging, kick-ass superhero you've always looked up to. Then you have the Mummy, a clumsy, dopey, ridiculous dork of a main character that I've ever laid eyes onto and played, but I love him to death. Both of their segments are very well done and decently separate from one another, so you really don't get tired of playing one or the other for too long. 

Sphinx is who you will spend a vast majority of your time playing, and he is an absolute joy to play. As you collect more and more abilities and become stronger and stronger he just becomes such a fun character to slay enemies left and right with. You can feel the true power from his swings and the impact of the blade with every strike, you truly feel like a hero in Sphinx's shoes (or feet, rather).

The Mummy is the secondary character who still play a major role in helping Sphinx progress and become more powerful at the same time. Being dead, the Mummy can use a vast variety of abilities to solve the many puzzles he stumbles into. Light yourself ablaze to burn down that pesky wooden gate that stands in your way. In need of a spark? No problem! The Mummy can carry an electric charge to wherever he finds himself needing power. Is that gap in the wall a tad too small to fit into? No sweat! Just get yourself smooshed and the Mummy will fit right in and grab that final key to finish the puzzle you've been stuck on. 

Switching between the two is very enjoyable and gives you a bit of a break from one another in order to keep you entertained. You've got your action segments with Sphinx where you can hack and slash your way through tons of enemies and rescue that damsel in distress. While the Mummy gets the gears in your brain turning and forces you to find a solution where there appears to be none. It's this back and forth gameplay that I find so appealing to this game and wish more games nowadays would use to their advantage. 

While I adore this game to death, no game is truly without flaw. This game suffers similar issues from the Legend of Zelda series. At times, you will grab a new item in a dungeon and only use it for that specific dungeon (looking at you bouncing darts). Granted, this is a small problem with very few items, but it still exists and shouldn't be overlooked, Other than that, the original release versions of the game suffered from glitches and major problems that would make the game harder or actually unbeatable. These have thankfully been fixed and aren't even something to worry about in this release. (thank you Swyter!) But the lack of using some of your items after their introductions doesn't go unnoticed. 

Some of the lower points aside, this game overall is a fantastic experience that I will 110% say you indulge into and go through for yourself. The gameplay is amazing and still holds up after all of these years. It's an astounding looking game, even for the time of its initial release. The music is award worthy, earning spots in my head for songs I can never get rid of. and the environments are beautifully and painstaking crafted to cause your jaw to drop when you remember that this game released originally in 2003. 

Overall, this game still holds up today and I would even argue is better than a lot of the AAA titles we see drop yearly. If you have the money (which is totally a steal of what I think this game is worth) and the time to sit down and truly experience this masterpiece for what it is, I highly, HIGHLY advise you grab this one. This is THE hidden gems of hidden gems. There's a reason that I will always remember this game as one of my absolute favorites. 

I may be biased, I may be blinded by nostalgia, but, I love this game and I'm sure you will, too.",1537463355,1537463355,True,5,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A completely underrated gem I must add. I adored playing this as a child but I never had gotten around to finishing it and when I saw this pop up on steam, I just had to get it.

Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is a 3d platformer along with some puzzle solving qualities, RPG elements and a collect-a-thon side quest; which is quite fun. Set in the Ancient Egyptian Mythos, you play as Sphinx for the most part, about 70% of the game is all about playing as Sphinx, the rest is all about the Mummy.

As Sphinx you do your usual 3d action platformer would do; Explore, Attack enemies, solve some small puzzles, doing some RPG stuff here and there, devling into dungeons and getting rewards. As the Mummy, it is highly emphasised on puzzle solving, but in a funny and entertaining manner; from being set on fire, electricuted, squished into a paper thin version of yourself or even cut into three Mummies!

The Atmosphere of the game is breath-taking, especially that this game was out in 2003 where most games on average didn't look or play that well compared to this. Instead of the usual pale yellow, sandy colour you'd get from the likes of Prince of Persia or any other game that is set in the Desert or is Egyptian themed, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy has a wide arrange of colours that burst out from the dunes and even the night sky, from maroon red to deep cosmic blue.

The soundtrack is just awe inspiring, absolutely magnificent and fits the Egyptian theme down to a T. From the relaxing tune when you read from your journal to the attentive and choir-like intro music when you boot the game up. It is a must listen.

However, I do not own a controller when I'd played Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy on the PC so I had to resort to playing it with the Keyboard and Mouse. It didn't harbour any difficulties when playing mind you, merely trying to get used to the controls at first was a bit jarring but luckily the beginning of the game lets you test things out.

But for those that don't have the patience to delve into any of the default key binds, here's a quickie:

TAB =  use, open, etc
ESC = crawl/stand
F = attack
SPACE = jump

With all that said, this is a must play for those looking for a 3d platformer or just something Egyptian themed.",1533190363,1548943629,True,8,0,0.609004735946655273,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Bien que la console et le jeu sont dans un carton et dont j'ai la flemme en plus d'un manque de place de les ressortir, j'ai pris sa version PC.

Tout de suite, j'ai retrouvé mes marques d'une manière générale, que ce soit par rapport à son environnement que pour son gameplay. 

Gameplay toutefois original puisqu'il se décompose en deux parties: la première, vous la jouez avec le personnage de Sphinx qui sera le perso avec qui vous allez passer le plus de temps, aussi bien pour découvrir les lieux que pour ses quêtes annexes, les minis-jeux et combats de boss. Tandis que l'autre gameplay se fera avec la momie qui, elle, est capable de supporter tous les pièges du secteur en question pour activer des interrupteurs et récupérer divers objets nécessaires pour la suite. 
Vous allez faire ""souffrir"" cette momie (elle s'en fout, elle est déjà morte, ha ha) en la faisant brûler, écrabouiller ou bien l’électrocuter et toujours avec de l'humour que ce soit pour son personnage que pour ses musiques durant ces phases.

L'histoire est prenante, on a envie de continuer à en savoir un peu plus, bien que la quête principale se fait assez rapidement. Le jeu ne surpassera pas, bien entendu, un Legend Of Zelda et d'un côté, ce n'était pas trop le but. On voit que les studios ont voulus faire leur propre jeu sans chercher à copier untel ou untel, faire un jeu en posant les bases d'un univers et de voir si cela marcherait au niveau du public.

Et ils avaient prévus le coup, dans l'éventualité, où cela marcherait puisque la fin du jeu faisait comprendre qu'il y aurait une suite: suite qui ne verra jamais le jour, ce qui est assez décevant. Pourtant, il y a du potentiel pour la suite d'un point de vue histoire car certaines questions restent encore sans réponse à la fin du titre.

Le jeu est très bon dans l'ensemble, les lieux sont magnifiques (j'aime énormément Héliopolis pour ma part), les personnages répondent très bien, des musiques superbes, une histoire prenante et des minis-quêtes optionnelles qui rallongent la durée du titre.

There are several locations that you visit such as a town where you trade and purchase game items, egyptian temples for puzzles and battles, and a two-sided area where you visit various characters for plot and learning new abilities. 

For keyboard users if you dont have a controller:

TAB = X (use, open, etc)
ESC = Y (crawl/stand)
F = B (attack)

I haven't gotten far enough along for LB and RB yet lol, but If you have a mouse that allows custom quick keys, it was much easier to set the mouse buttons to tab, esc, F, etc to play the game. :)

Take a look at this pinned thread in Discussions: https://steamcommunity.com/app/606710/discussions/0/1483235412204767496/

The only thing to keep in mind is that you won't see the key prompts or layout in-game, but you can customize most keybindings via configuration files. We are working on having actual in-game keybinding support, but as Sphinx was originally released as a console exclusive it entails rewriting big parts of the input code. So it may take a while.

We have received reports of people completing the game without using a gamepad, and while not ideal, seems to be perfectly doable. Let me know if that helps."

Sphinx y la Maldita Momia (anda que vaya tela con la traducción del título) es un juego que bebe bastante de Zelda. Está dividido en dos partes jugables: unas con Sphinx, más enfocada a la acción (aunque con puzles del tipo de pulsar interruptores y conseguir llaves) y otras con la momia, sin combates pero con mazmorras con más chicha.

Los segmentos con Sphinx son los principales (por algo da nombre al juego), y viajaremos por distintas zonas aumentando nuestro catálogo de armas y habilidades, lo que nos dará acceso a nuevas zonas. El sistema de combate es el punto flojo del juego. A pesar de basarse en Zelda, no se ha implementado un sistema de Z-targering, y la cámara no acompaña. Además, hay un escudo, pero es lento de usar y clava a Sphinx al suelo, así que salvo algunos enemigos, no será de gran utilidad. Un sistema de lucha bastante torpón, pero realmente la gracia del juego son sus puzles, por suerte.

Las partes de la momia, aunque al principio parezcan secundarias, acaban siendo de lo más divertidas. Hay mazmorras muy chulas, y las habilidades de la momia hacen que resolver los puzles sea muy gratificante. Al no poder morir, la momia puede usar su propio cuerpo sin miedo alguno (recordando a Wario Land, por ejemplo). Así, nos quemamos o nos electrocutaremos para superar los diversos acertijos.

Gráficamente no está mal para ser un juego relativamente antiguo, y hace unos días han actualizado con texturas HD, y se nota la mejora. Es cierto que me han saltado algunos bugs (por ejemplo, al principio del juego me bloquee con un objeto y tuve que reiniciar, u otra vez que el sonido petardeaba y hasta que no reinicié no se arregló), pero son cosas muy puntuales. Las melodías están bien, y no dispone de voces de ningún tipo (salvo los típicos gruñidos al golpear o saltar).

Una cosa que no me ha gustado nada es el tema del guardado, y sobre todo, la muerte. Al morir, no regresas a un punto de checkpoint o a la puerta de la mazmorra, sino que vuelves al último guardado. Al principio me cogió desprevenido y por un descuido tuve que repetir bastante juego, ya que solo me preocupaba de guardar cuando iba a dejar de jugar. A partir de entonces, he ido guardado cada rato, pero se hace tedioso, hay veces que vas con el miedo de que te maten por cualquier tontería y repetir los últimos 20 minutos. Y teniendo en cuenta que el sistema de combate no es el mejor, y que hasta bastante avanzada la aventura no puedes aumentar tu nivel de vida, si te descuidas con algún enemigo pueden matarte con facilidad. No es un juego difícil, pero hay secciones que no son bondadosas con el jugador, especialmente si por cualquier motivo avanzas con la salud baja (no es fácil recuperar vida).

Tampoco me ha gustado que al final del juego te metan en un punto sin retorno. Es cierto que te avisan de que a partir de cierto momento no vas a poder regresar, pero como no puedes copiar slots, al final vas a tener que avanzar y guardar sin poder regresar. Puedes meterte en la zona final y no guardar allí, pero aun así, sigue siendo un problema de diseño (si te mata el jefe final, tendrías que repetir todo el tramo final en ese caso). Y bueno, qué decir del final, lo dejan abierto de cara a una futura secuela que en su momento nunca llegó.

A pesar de la simpleza del combate y los problemas que estoy comentando (que realmente es por aportar algo negativo, no empañan demasiado el juego), me he divertido mucho y me ha teletransportado a una época donde este tipo de aventuras abundaban. Me ha durado unas 15 horas (y me he dejado muchas sidequest por el camino), y nunca me he aburrido, me ha tenido enganchado de principio a fin. Hay mazmorras muy chulas, especialmente con la momia.

It's really great and of the ""buddy game"" variety of yore; like Jak & Daxter meets Zelda, only the Mummy and Sphinx aren't playable at the same time. Lots of good puzzles, humor, setting, music, etc.

I do wish they'd opted for voice acting, though and I hope the devs improve some aspects of the game like hit detection on ziplines or the camera. The game also uses a save-point system that was antiquated even back in '03. I also wish that for the Sphinx parts of the game, they had just ripped off Ocarina of Time's lock-on system as combat is kind of unwieldy.

I also see they released a modkit for the game via proprietary Eurocom software, so I can't wait to see what new stuff the community will create for the game — I think this may be the first, or at least one of the very few, console games that has had official mod tools released for it when they could've easily gone the DLC route.

The  puzzles in this game are phenomenal and really make you think because they often are designed across the entire dungeon or map. I loved the utilization of the mummy in the dungeons. I've played a nice amount of platformers from this era of games, and some of them had puzzle elements, but not to many have had puzzles that were designed this beautifully. The theme is wonderful and the characters are fun placesetters to help put you in the world that you will be running around in. From what I've seen of the original game, the graphics have been overhauled making it really great to look at. The controls are really nice and you never feel like a missed jump or rough landing was the games fault. Best played with a controller. Another great feature was that your saves are backlogged, so if something messes up or you miss something important and can't go back like an achievement, you can make one of your backlogged saves a save from the game just by changing a name in the saves folder. You will easily sink almost 20 hours into this game just beating and completing it and if you really enjoy it, like most of the people who picked this up for the nostalgia, than I'm sure you'll play it again. Well worth the $15 usd or anything less you can pick up on a sale. Maybe there's a hope that the second one can get funded because of this remasters positive reception.

I remember playing this game throughout the mid 2000's and beating the game around 3 times on both XBox and PS2 and was very glad to see the game remastered for the PC where I am working on my 4th playthrough. From a nostalgic point of view I love this game but I can see what would turn people off from it. The game has its fair share of flaws but in my opinion none of them are outright deal breakers and arguably make the game more satisfying to complete as they provide an element of challenge that is not too often seen in games released in recent years. I would recommend this game to more than just the nostalgic old players on the condition that they don't mind the following constraints:

- The controls in this game are ported over from XBox and are not the easiest to use on PC which can make the game irritating at times. I would strongly advise bookmarking a page online that has the controls aswell considering there are no real ways to determine what button does what in game.On a side note if you have a controller you will likely have an easier time.

- There is quite a bit of backtracking in this game and the objectives may not always be spelled out for you or outright obvious so it is a smart idea to actually pay attention to the story, explore the zones and make note of stuff you may not be able to do ingame yet.

- The level design is not the greatest at times, some jumps will seem impossible but are just in fact very difficult, making full use of the double jump feature obtained early on in the game.

- There are bugs in this game however most of them have been fixed however I will post 2 that I encountered for the sake of awareness: 
+ Left eyes of sarcophagi are invisible
+ A rare bug where conversation is inescapable and uninteracable with the NPC that runs the Heliopolis obstacle course.

- Voice acting is pretty much non-existant outside of incomprehensable noises made by the characters in cutscenes. 

Despite the game's buggy behavior It has solid replay value and is a great fit for anyone that liked to play older action-adventure platformer games.

Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a remaster of an action adventure game from 2003. As of writing this review the game has only been released on PC but I hope that the game will receive a console release (Again) in the future so more people can enjoy the game.

The game is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology and it features many of the gods and heroes from the time period, like Imhotep and Anubis.

The story follows two characters, the first is named Sphinx and he’s used mostly for combat, while Tutankhamen is used to solve intricate puzzles. The game frequently alternate’s between the two of them and in doing so it makes the game a lot less boring.

Each area of the game is beautifully designed and the HD enhancements look great considering the game’s age. Most of the areas are quite large as well and often have side quests for you to complete. Doing side quests also has benefits to the game itself but there are some that aren’t required to complete the game, like capturing monsters for the museum, as an example.

As you progress through the game the puzzles that you encounter with Tutankhamen become increasingly more intricate and complex. Since he’s a mummy for the majority of the game, he’s immune to death and this fact is utilized in each of the game’s puzzles. He can be set on fire, electrocuted, split into 3, and flattened. Each of these unique states lasts only for a short period of time so you must move quickly to solve each of the game’s puzzles. If he’s on fire or electrified, falling into the water will get rid of the effect and you’ll need to go reacquire it again. Getting any of the effects will also automatically replace the existing effect too.

When you’re in control of sphinx you’ll be able to use the Sword of Osiris to battle enemies. Enemies come in many shapes and sizes and each have their own unique abilities to them. They’re pretty limited in skills though, so you can easily learn their moves without much effort.

At the start of the game, Sphinx’s skills are pretty limited but as you complete major points in the story, he’ll acquire items that grant bonus abilities such as fast swimming and double jumping.

Overall, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a very entertaining game and the developers did a great job on the remastering of it. There are some minor issues that I ran into like the usage of items being rather cumbersome and until recently the font being too small (Which has now been fixed thankfully). Outside of those, I’ve been having a lot of fun with the game and I look forward to finishing up my video playthrough of the game. If you’re a fan of action adventure games and want something that’ll take up a lot of your time then Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a great choice.

Swyter did implement original art assets but these clash horribly with the low resolution art that is still from the PS2, high resolution source artwork was lazily pasted onto the game world with no thought of how it looks next to a texture made for a console with 32Mb of RAM, combine this with the ugly shading and you have a game that looks like a bad texture pack rather than a remaster

All I need do is compare Swyter's port to the PS2 version running in PCSX2, this port is an insult to the original game and is not how you should play this game, grab yourself a PS2 ISO and play it on PCSX2 at 4K 60FPS with the original graphics intact, this isn't a bad port but it's a lazy quick cash grab by THQNordic done by a programmer who can't control his ego.

Also pro-tip, if you see any negative reviews from a previous date than this with the reason being a bug, it's already been fixed. Everythings been fixed. The developer is a saint when it comes to making this game proper for pc, he has been working extremely diligently to make sure all bugs are patched ASAP. Want an example? I came across a bug that after a death made my game unplayable because of black screen. I posted on the forums about it, and LITERALLY within 3 minutes the developer responded, recieved the information, and within the day the bug was patched. 
THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASSIC  GEM OF AN ADVENTURE GAME. IT IS 100% WORTH YOUR MONEY. IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, AND ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW GAME TO TRY, THIS IS THE GAME YOU NEED TO PLAY. 
Don't play on keyboard and mouse though, get a controller. Keyboard controls are hard to use for movement, and the mouse controls for the camera is horrible too. BUT HEY ITS ORIGINALLY A CONSOLE GAME. IF YOU AINT PLAYING WITH A CONTROLLER YOU AINT DOING IT RIGHT ;o

[i]Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy[/i] is a surprising title to see remastered but it is a welcome surprise. Its strong 3D puzzle platforming and sense of nostalgia will endear it to a niche audience. Remnants of old game designs may frustrate those looking for a modern experience. Poor keyboard controls are hopefully only a temporary flaw in this otherwise good quality port. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1][list]
[*]Puzzles that continually introduce fresh mechanics
[*]Great pacing between Sphinx and Tutankhamen sections
[*]Vibrant colors and character animations

[h1]Cons:[/h1][list]
[*]Story never deviates from what you'd expect
[*]No autosave function; semi-infrequent save points
[*]Small moments of frustration add up

[b][u]Expanded Review[/u][/b]
Even as a newcomer to [i]Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy[/i] I felt pangs of nostalgia from playing it. Not because I recognized anything but because its designs and features felt so familiar. It is a puzzle action platformer that draws obvious inspiration from the [i]Zelda[/i] series. Coming from an era predating physics based puzzles ([i]Half Life 2[/i] would be released a year later) means you'll be solving puzzles with good old switches, buttons and an ever growing selection of equipment and environmental factors.

As the title suggests you'll be splitting your time between playing as Sphinx, the lion tailed hero, and Tutankhamen, the cursed mummy. The pacing is excellent as you swap between the two at predetermined times in the story. Sphinx plays like a hero should. He swings a sword, double jumps like a champ and knows how to use the tools he finds. And he does it all with a confident air and swagger in his step.

Meanwhile Tutankhamen, once called ""the Misfortunate Mummy"" in the title, plays the slapstick comic relief. He is imprisoned from early on and his mission is one of stealth and thievery. There is no combat in his sections and item use is limited. Instead he uses his undead body as a tool. Among other things, he can be lit on fire, smashed flat and sawed into pieces. For all his misfortune he keeps a cheery demeanor.

With a launch price of 14.99$ and a run time averaging around 16 hours I'd call this a solid value for a niche audience. It took me just over 18 hours to 100% complete it. It will primarily appeal to those of us that were gaming back in 2003. Those looking for more 3D puzzle dungeon delving outside of the Zelda series should also find enjoyment in it.

He has been a great help fixing the bugs in the first week of release and more. He come to the discord server too highlighting us with more and more. Was a pleasure helping him also ironing out the italian translation (which had some little hiccups but nothing major).

+Dev team has been appreciably responsive and quick to address reports
+Sweet baby Osiris, automatic save backups
-HUD and text are too small at higher resolutions, although a dev said this would be fixed
-Shadows are missing
-Occasional minor sound bugs
-Rare bug where talking to any NPC will softlock the game, forcing you to reload your save

+Well written story and characters if cliche
+Best Zelda clone I have played personally
+Great puzzles, decent combat

Yesterday in the Eve, while i was surfing through the Internet, I randomly saw this Game.
My Favourite Playstation 2 Game ! I was excited like a little kid on Christmas haha ! Was it Fate ? However... 

This HD Remake looks beautiful, the ambient atmosphere is gorgeous and the music quality much better than I had it in my Memories
If you use ReShade, this game looks partially better than Assassins Creed !

But there a some things, that must be patched !

1) 2

Gestern Abend, während ich im Internet surfte, sah ich aus Zufall dieses Spiel
Mein lieblings Playstation 2 Spiel ! I war aufgeregt wie ein kleines Kind an Weihnachten ! War es Schicksal ? Wie auch immer...

Dieses HD Remake sieht wirklich schön aus, die Umgebungs Atmosphäre echt herrlich und die Musik Qualität ist besser als ich sie in Erinnerung hatte.
Wenn man ReShade benutzt, sieht es teilweise besser aus als Assassins Creed !

Aber ein paar Dinge sollten wirklich gepatch werden !

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patch List:

01.  There is no Thundersound in the Intro (Before Main Menu/ Press Start)
02.  No Setting for stick sensivity
03.  unnecessary FOV Slider (my opinion)
04.  Fight Music and Hit Sound (epic Strings) not dynamic and too quiet ! (quieter than ambient)
05.  No Option Section for key assignment
06.  Letter size in Subtitel and Inventory way to small ( TV / Caoch Mode ? )
07.  The HUD is to small ( make it adjustable or able to turn off)
08.  If you use the Restart Button in the Graphic Section, but took Screenshots, the Game won't restart from it self
09.  adjust Monitor Position option doesn't work
10.  Way more here [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/606710/discussions/0/1483235412211930360/] Link [/url]",1510485902,1511463250,True,2,1,0.518633544445037842,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The same developer that made Crash Bash. It originally released back in 2003 on the PS2. It's set in a fantasy world inspired by ancient Egypt.

It's a very competent game. The levels look really nice, the characters have nice designs, the platforming is competent. But it doesn't really stand out in any real respect. The story is bog standard and generic and you really stop paying attention to it. At one point you unlock a second player character who is a mummy but all this really does is shift the game towards a more stealth focus. There is also no voice acting and this really drags the entire game down and makes it feel like it lacks personality compared to something like Jak and Daxter. 

Sphinx is interesting less because of it's value as a game but moreso how it was completely forgotten after it released and only gets discussed nowadays because of a massive oversight on the developers part with the original release. In the NTSC release, if you used a specific save game station. It locks a specific door you need to get through and makes you unable to complete the game. This massive technical problem affects almost everyone who played the original release and as a result very few people actually completed the game. 

This is why I'm somewhat shocked that this game was ported to PC 14 years later since I was surprised someone else remembered it. This version does fix that bug and is fairly competent aside from that. But that's the word, competent. It doesn't do very much you haven't seen done better elsewhere.

Only 978 MB space required. It looks great, considering its age. Anti-Aliasing. 60 fps. It's cheap and even cheaper on sale right now. Why can't ports always be like this?

According to the Steam forums, lots of bugs have been fixed, the devs are going to add proper keymapping and fix the other issues (windowed mode, 1440p support,...) people are complaining about right now.

I've only played it for an hour so far, but as it was a great game back then and this is (will be) a great port, I clearly recommend it.

Show your support for good ports of classic games! After Jet Set Radio, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and Sphinx we might have some great things coming.

Update: 
Apparently the broken windowed mode has been fixed already. The devs are actively communicating with the community, especially regarding technial issues. Thumbs up for that.

Update 2:
The dev (yes, this port is actually done by a single person) still pushes hotfixes nearly everyday.

It was my birthday and i was allowed to get 2 or 3 games for my PS2. I remember seeing the box art for this game and being fascinated. i had always had an interest in ancient Egypt, my favorite movie of the time was The Mummy, and i couldn't wait to get home and play it. I'm glad I did, too, Because it wound up becoming one of my top ten favorite games of all time. Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I find out that Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is coming to PC. I haven't been so excited. I thinks it fair to say I love this game. However, I do have a few minor issues with this port.

First, the text is far too small. When i'm at my computer desk playing it's not that much of a problem. However, in the living room, on my big TV, it's impossible to read. I've also noticed a lot of artifacting and broken bits of letters in the text box. I hear that a fix is coming for that and I hope it's soon. 

Second, there seems to be a few minor graphical bugs. I'm running a GTX 1070, so i doubt it's my computers fault. A few cases of random things losing their eyes, one or both, and other cases of Sphinx's model nowhere near lined up with objects he's interacting with. Hopefully these issues can be fixed and if so, it will be done soon as well.

Overall, nothing I've noticed has been game breaking or messed up my experience with this port. They're all just little things I notice while playing that make me chuckle and wonder what happened. Sphinx continues to be a pleasure to play and seeing it in HD makes me that much happier.

It's good that they don't stretch unnaturally, but the subtitles and button display are quite small and currently have no options to increase them. Developer Swyter has confirmed on the Community Hub that this will be fixed. I've only experienced one minor freeze so far, but I think this happened when my Xbox Controller suddenly became disconnected from the computer. 

As mentioned above, it looks and feels just like how I remember, upon visiting a YouTube video for the original version on the Gamecube/PS2, it definitely has been improved! Then again, in all of our collective memories, childhood games always look better in our minds than they actually did in reality. I can see how certain elements have been made HD, and with 60fps support the game. it truly is nostalgia overload. 

I may come back and update this review as I progress through the game, as I am currently still in the early stages. Aside from the minor freeze I had, and the GUI elements looking tiny, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this classic.

UPDATE: I have experienced some more freezes, these are rare and last for about half a second each time it happens, not sure as to the exact cause, it's a minor nuisance and something I can see genuinely affecting other players who may understandably not be so lenient towards issues such as these. Other reviewers have mentioned sound stuttering bugs, I hadn't experienced any of these until I reached the level where you play as Tut and must find the Moon, Sun and Earth Planetarium Keys. It seems to continue every now and then from this point, but it is sometimes fixed by pressing the Back button and then again to go back into gameplay. At one point, I had to restart the game to fix it. Minor issues, but this won't stop me from enjoying the game! Hopefully these minor annoyances get fixed.

UPDATE 2: The sound bug has now been fixed, I've only experienced very minor bugs since then and these do not affect gameplay. I'm nearing the end of the campaign and this has been an absolutely terrific nostalgic trip. Swyter has been extremely involved in the community in ensuring that everybody is able to play the game just as it was meant to be played, little bugs and big bugs have been ironed out and continue to be ironed out today. Very much worth the purchase.",1510333959,1511376728,True,32,1,0.738285362720489502,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a bit of an annoyance but will hopefully be patched, for me it's too good to pass up as this was my childhood. It's still a bit clunky but just as gorgeous as the original, doesn't feel too HD but it looks great and plays pretty good too! I reccomend playing with a controller until they fix some of the issues. Long live Sphinx!",1510326132,1510326132,True,31,0,0.662483513355255127,0,False,True,False,False,,,
