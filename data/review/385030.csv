นอกจากจุดขายของเกมจะเป็นซาวด์แทร็กฮิปฮอปที่ติดหูแล้ว (และก็คิดว่าหลายคนน่าจะชอบ) นี่คือการหยิบเอาหนังเรื่อง Citizen Kane ในปี 1941 มาตีความใหม่ในธีมโลกอนาคตผสมแก๊งสเตอร์อะไรไม่รู้มั่วไปหมด ระบบเกม RPG โลกพิลึกในสไตล์ Earthbound ยั่วล้อผู้เล่นที่กำจัดศัตรูในเกมว่า เป็นส่วนหนึ่งที่ทำให้สัตว์สูญพันธ์ ซึ่งอาจนำไปสู่จุดจบของโลก ประเด็นใหญ่ๆอย่างการล่าฉลามหรือสัตว์ต่างๆ หรือแม้กระทั่งคนด้วยกันเอง ยังคงตามหลอกหลอนในใจของพระเอกอยู่เรื่อยๆแม้กระทั่งฝันร้าย ทางเดียวที่จะหยุดยั้งวาระสุดท้ายของโลกใบนี้ได้ นั่นก็คือ Rosebud เวทย์มนต์ลากเลื่อนที่มีพลังมหาศาลในการเปลี่ยนแปลงโลกได้ เปรียบเสมือนการเริ่มต้นใหม่ในสิ่งที่พลาดไป บอสแต่ละตัวจะต้องใช้วิธีสู้ที่ต่างกันตามธาตุที่มีอยู่ ไว้มีโอกาสจะมาเขียนให้อ่านกันในภายหลัง

บอสทั้ง 5 ในโคลอสเซียม (เอาเท่าที่พอระลึกชาติได้)
- แมวน้ำ/ สู้ตามปกติ ไม่ค่อยมีอะไรให้ทักมาก แต่ระวังหน่อย มันโจมตีแรง ฮีลบ่อยๆด้วย
- หุ่นยนต์ + เครื่องเสียง/ หุ่นยนต์อมตะ ให้โจมตีใส่เครื่องเสียงด้วยเวทย์น้ำเรื่อยๆ ไฟจะช็อตที่ตัวหุ่นยนต์
- หุ่นไขลาน/ ให้กำจัดหุ่นไขลานทั้ง 4 จากนั้น คนทำหุ่นจะกลายเป็นหมา ก็โจมตีหนักๆไป
- ปลาหมึก/ ให้กำจัดหนวดปลาหมึกทั้ง 5 ก่อนตัวปลาหมึก เพราะตายง่าย ลดภาระรับแดมเมจเพิ่มด้วย
- พ่อพระเอก/ ไม่ค่อยยากนัก ถ้าผ่าน 4 ตัวแรกได้ ที่เหลือก็ง่ายแล้ว
หากสู้ครบ ก็จะปลดล็อก Clown Mode ซึ่งไม่มีอะไรมาก ก็แค่ใส่จมูกตัวตลกเฉยๆ ไว้โชว์เท่ๆ

ส่วนบอสตัวอื่นๆ
- โคลนนิ่งพระเอกบนยอดภูเขาไฟ - อย่าโจมตี เพราะเดี๋ยวมันก็จะแห้งเหี่ยวตายไปเอง
- ฉลามหุ่นยนต์ - ให้ใช้ท่า Libel ของพระเอก ลดพลังป้องกันไปเรื่อยๆจนกว่าจะโจมตีโดน
- บอส The End of The World - ไว้ชีวิต Getty เพื่อรับพลัง Rosebud แค่ยิงใส่บอส 2 ทีก็ตายแล้ว

It was slapped together with the godawful OHRRPGCE (Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Construction Engine) JRPG construction kit, giving RPG Maker a solid run for it's money as the worst construction kit to ever infest Steam.  

In this case, some effort was expended in creating custom retro pixel ""art"" and greyscale visuals, the former being due to lack of budget/talent, the latter for artistic purposes to mimic the film the game is lambasting.  At least this is better than the usual flipped assets that most construction kit spam has. 

As a result of the poor quality engine, the game displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of construction kits is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.  While it might be better if this had never been released on Steam under the guise of a professionally developed game, the developer has done the right thing by making their RPG construction kit effort free.

The overall quality of this ""game"", plus the general limitations of the poor quality game engine and associated defects, plus the non-serious nature of the game prevent me from recommending this, even for free.

The developer has weighed in to inform everyone they didn't read the [url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews]Developer Usage Rules[/url] for Steam ""partners"", or they deliberately ignored the part where Valve says:

It's also not a good idea to use this feature to refute customer opinions. Your direct attention can be seen as validation or a defensive attempt to silence your customers.[/quote]

The developer seems to have about the same attitude towards the Steam community, gamers and reviewers as they do towards the quality of their products.

Built in the OHRRPGCE engine, C Kane is a rather old-school turn-based RPG. Most battles come down to attacking/healing/buffing/debuffing but are never mindless. The solution to each battle is usually very puzzlesque and figuring out the tricks to each enemy encounter is satisfying.

The game is only 2 or 3 hours but has a satisfying arc of engaging in fights, discovering weaknesses, and leaning new abilities. There are no random encounters, only deliberate battles, and I think that's what pushes me over the line into recommending this game.

The story is not really important. C Kane is a game that acts as a vehicle for jokes. The quality of those jokes is debatable. I found the game was at its funniest when it dealt with the titular character's inner monologue. There's a “moral choices in video games” joke that wouldn't be that funny even back in 2007. 

The game's soundtrack is another source of comedy, it's idiosyncratic to say the least. Contrasting with C Kane's black and white aesthetic is a hip-hop/pop soundtrack with comical lyrics about walking around RPG towns or using the world map. The themes loop too quickly but the charm of the musical themes works a lot better than many of the jokes in the dialogue.

It's an enjoyable romp. Maybe you'll find it funnier than I did, and if you do find it funnier you'll have yourself a good couple of hours.

C.Kane attempts to boil all of these RPG tropes down into a simple format and lean message about what actually constitutes the hero's journey and questions whether the hero is even really a hero.

Charles Kane is just your average RPG hero, well, media mogul with an absentee father if you want to get technical, who goes around town and listens to the pleas of townsfolk who wish him to locate their junk for them. Along the way, he fights monsters and bosses, as that's the only way he can please the people. But as he journeys from one corner of a post-apocalyptic United States to another, he gradually comes face-to-face with the greatest moral questions that an RPG hero can face: Is he doing the right thing?

C.Kane isn't just a game about killing monsters (even though it kind of is). It's a game that dives deep into a series of philosophical questions that challenge our understanding of what makes a good man good, or a good man into a monster. It's a game about moral choices, and deciding what makes a choice moral. It's a game about talking beavers, clowns, and hip-hop talking wizards. And it has a soundtrack that reminds you that, even though you are having to make tough choices about whether you should slay that monster or dump your wife for the ""hot chick,"" you are still playing an RPG, one that should take only a few hours to finish.

Should you play C.Kane? Only if you enjoy a good story, thought-provoking character dilemmas, and don't give a lick about random battles, except for those against mega sharks, zombies, walruses, and pure evil.

Oh, and don't adjust your color. It's meant to be in black and white. It's based on a film from the 1930s after all. This applies only when clown mode is inactive.

However, even though this is a blatantly flippant joke game, it's tightly designed to achieve what it sets out to do without overstaying its welcome.

The RPG gameplay is minimalist to the point of its own minimalism being a running gag. The world map is not only so tiny it fits in a single screen, the overworld music itself is a rap track about all the locations on the map (there's about 6). There are no random battles, and of course, the battle music has some vocals about wanting to fight some monsters. Acquiring better gear and expanding characters' spell and ability repertoire is stripped down to the bone, yet still satisfying. The small amount of battle situations that occur in the game's 2-3 hours have just enough variety and call for strategic planning - usually by exploiting elemental weaknesses or smart usage of stat debuffs - to be interesting.

The story is farcical and full of pop culture references, as well as skewed references to Citizen Kane itself. It even upholds the lineage of Barkley Gaiden by featuring basketball as a token plot element. Actually, if you enjoyed the style of writing in Barkley Gaiden or Dog of Dracula 2, you'll probably feel right at home here.

From a gameplay standpoint, the game stands. The RPG mechanics are clear, present, your party is small and every character has a decent amount of strengths and weaknesses (except Leland, who has no weakness), and the bosses have some interesting gimmicks at times. It's challenging, but never too insanely difficult -- I think I died once in the entire game while fighting the hidden end game boss. The game is only about two to three hours long if you choose to explore the world, less if you just run through.

When it comes to writing and story, C. Kane is a love it or hate it. One thing that would DEFINITELY increase your enjoyment of the game is seeing the film Citizen Kane, as there are a few amazing references to the film and world. However, the writing occassionally gets a little flat, and just starts seeming weird for the sake of being weird. I wish there was a little more substance to the story, as I felt like it had potential that it didn't use.

The soundtrack is actually my biggest gripe in the game. It's very limited, and all the loops are very short. The songs are hilarious at first, but quickly become repetitive -- especially during some of the longer fights.
