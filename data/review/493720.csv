The puzzles are sensible and well-integrated into the world. Some trial and error is required, but it's never too much.

The one time I really got stuck (for an hour and a half), I'd missed an object I hadn't realized I could interact with. This is a recurring issue. The first puzzle you come across requires pulling a lever, and if the conditions aren't right, the lever simply snaps back to its original position indicating it didn't work. This is what you expect to see, but most of the objects you can potentially interact with are instead inert if the conditions aren't right. You can't click on them at all. This makes them look like they're just a part of the background, and it makes you wonder if the game is buggy, or if maybe you're not clicking the right button. It's not a big problem, but you'd expect anything you can potentially interact with to have some sort of feedback in a game like this, even if the conditions aren't right.

As many have pointed out, Haven Moon deliberately follows in the footsteps of Myst. And for the most part, it does so adeptly. The Victorian setting and atmosphere invoke a Myst-like nostalgia, most of the puzzles are logical and can be reasoned out by careful attention to detail, and the soundtrack augments the whole experience nicely. 

A few things to be aware of, however:
--It’s a shorter game (about 5 hours). Still very impressive considering a single guy made it all. Just don’t expect a typical length game.
--A few of the puzzles could have been designed better. On one or two of them, there’s no indication you’ve done the right thing once you’ve done it. Since nothing appeared to change, I ended up being “stuck” when I shouldn’t have been. At another point, I had to look up a hint and found myself saying, “I was supposed to pay attention to THAT??” There was no in-game nudge or reason given for doing so.  
--The ending was underwhelming, which was disappointing given that the story started out promisingly. Multiple major questions were left unanswered. 

Overall though, I still enjoyed the game and would recommend it to any fans of the puzzle adventure genre.

The atmosphere and art are spot on, music is good.

It's got sprint, which is nice, because sometimes the walking is the worst part of games like this. And it's got faster travel options that you unlock as you go through the game. 

Story Line - short, very short, and relies heavily on fantasy-science. You have to accept that it's just the window dressing to tie all the puzzles together. 

Puzzles and Gameplay - it's obvious the creator tried really hard and I loved playing the game. But the intuitive, look around and find the clues, aspect that made Myst so successful was lacking here. The puzzles rely heavily on trial and error which is difficult because sometimes there's no clear indication of what a switch is going to do, or where the reaction is going to happen - and since you have to bounce between 4 islands it can be tedious trying to check every possibility. The game could have benefited from additional, more subtle clues along the way. We did check a few walk throughs and hint lists to get to the end of the game. There are 3 items you pick up in game that go into your inventory - you can't access your inventory at all, if the puzzle requires one of the items you have, you'll automatically use it when you click. 

Over all - Loved it. My husband and I play these games together for date nights. This felt like Myst and Riven all over again (at least I didn't have to swap discs every time I went to a new island!!) and I definitely recommend it. I got it on sale and only paid a couple bucks so it was well worth it. Even at $12 it's not a bad price. Expect to take 3-10 hours, depending on your experience and if you use cheats.

Why with caution? The developer, Francois Roussel, made this game with the intent of recapturing the essence of Myst. He did succeed in some ways, but didn't succeed in others.

When people think of Myst, they think of the engrossing mysterious and alien worlds with the strange but logical puzzles integrated into the worlds themselves. Haven Moon definitely has integrated the puzzles into the world, and it's science-fiction/fantasy enough to help you suspend your disbelief, but it's far from being alien and mysterious. And that's okay; but it's not all of what made Myst, ""Myst.""

Myst did not hide the next step of its puzzles. When Myst ""hides"" a section of its puzzles, it's either staring at you in the face and you've overlooked it, or it is in a book. Myst also almost always rewards the player with an immediate and unmistakable signal when the player makes progress, usually visual, sometimes auditory. This is why Myst's puzzles are altogether challenging, fair, and satisfying to complete. Thanks to Myst's generally good puzzle design, other than one or two nudging hints that ""clicked"" things into place for me, I was able to complete all of Myst, Riven, Myst III, and Quern without a walkthrough.
Haven Moon, unfortunately, has several moments where you'll make progress and go, ""okay, what do I do now?"" If that is the case and it is not due to the lack of signaling, it's because the next step is essentially a god damn pixel hunt. So the only means of moving forward is to look up a guide, and that is the definition of ""bad"" for a puzzle game.
I was also surprised at the amount of tedious backtracking for such a small game.
So it should go without saying, I did not find the puzzles of Haven Moon satisfying.

The game also still has few bugs. Twice I spontaneously fell through the ground. And I found a notable number flickering textures.
And there are a number of QoL matters in how to operate some of the puzzle components. You might find yourself holding down your mouse button for a long while because Francois decided to make the operating mechanism a rotating nob or wheel rather than a button.

Ultimately, i cannot not recommend this game because Francois developed Haven Moon all on his own. For all its faults, it's still a decent Myst-like game. To accomplish this much alone, I must say ""bravo."" Francois shows great promise, and I would like to see him improve his skill further and make more games like this.",1688111818,1688113743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Haven Moon is a short, linear puzzle game with a light narrative, which has ended up being one of my favourite Myst-like games, despite its brevity.

I don't understand why so many reviews are so harshly critical of this game. It has a few flaws, but it's by no means as bad as a lot of these negative reviews are making out.

I agree that a few of the puzzles could be improved by having a few more hints, but it's certainly not a 'hunt the pixel' situation. A few of the puzzles make use of sound rather than sight, which is a rare phenomenon in this day and age, and I think that has thrown a few people who have been hunting by eye when they should have been using their ears. There's also another puzzle that has some well-hidden hints that I think people are just assuming requires guesswork simply because they haven't noticed the hints.

Haven Moon is definitely a game that rewards [i]good observation[/i] and the [i]careful reading[/i] of notes.

Also, travelling between islands is by no means 'slow'. It's not instant, but it only takes a few seconds. What other people are calling a 'loading screen' is actually just a travel animation. I agree that being able to skip it would be nice simply because the animations become repetitive after a while, but I don't think it's slow enough that that should be a genuine gripe. (Obduction for example is [b]far[/b], [b]far[/b] worse.)

With that out of the way...

[h2]Positives[/h2]

[list]
[*] Great world design.
[list]
[*] Lots of nice architecture and stylistic elements. 
[*] Sort of like a cross between Steampunk and Art Deco.
[*] Good use of wood and brass.
[/list]
[*] Some interesting and clever puzzles.
[*] Nicely paced.
[*] Island maps are provided in-game.
[*] More or less all of the control panels are intuitive enough to understand without any additional direction.
[/list]

[h2]Neutral[/h2]

[list]
[*] The plot is nothing special, but I don't think it really needed to be any deeper than it was. A bit of extra lore might have been nice, but I don't think its absence is a negative.
[*] A few spelling mistakes in some of the notes. Most notably 'canon' is used instead of 'cannon' a handful of times, and 'lightnings' instead of 'lightning bolts'.
[*] I never thought I'd say this: I wish the walking speed were a bit slower so I could stop and admire the view more. The running speed is fine, that's what I want when I'm trying to do something quickly, but the walking speed was brisker than I would have liked. I'm not classing it as a negative because it didn't make the game worse in any way, it's just something that would have made the game better.
[*] It would have been nice if a few of the decorative objects were interactable, especially considering this game was inspired by Myst and Myst did the same. I'm presuming that was left out either due to time/budget constraints or to avoid people confusing unimportant things for puzzle elements.
[/list]

[h2]Negatives[/h2]

[list]
[*] It's shorter than I would have liked. I certainly wasn't rushing it, I stopped to admire the view, but I finished it in under 4 hours.
[*] The puzzle that relies on sound can be tricky if you don't realise that it relies on sound, particularly because in the first case the sound is a little far away from the player.
[*] One of the puzzles is quite easy to overlook.
[*] A few puzzles would have benefited from more/better feedback.
[*] Not many in-game settings, so configuring graphics, audio, and input is limited.

Big props to this dude for the aesthetic/vibe. I loved the environments and the music. I felt Feelings walking down concrete hallways and hearing the rain splashing against the glass on a stormy island.

I did not like the gameplay, puzzles, or story.

There was a lot of traveling between islands to figure out what to do next, and the loading animations get tiresome after a while. A few puzzles made no sense; I had to use a walkthrough. Certain puzzles had zero feedback to tell you that you'd made the correct move, so you wouldn't discover that you solved it until you happened to move into a different area to see what changed. Several of the puzzles involved trial and error but there wasn't clear feedback about what different levers or switches were even doing. Which is frustrating when there are also puzzles that straight up don't work without being powered on, but the difference between the former (just needs trial and error/affects something in a different area) and latter (nothing is happening without power) is unclear.

As for the story...

[12/20⭐, 5h🏅, 3/5💡]

[b]Context[/b] Haven Moon is a Myst-like game, a fact assumed from the start by the dev. It's also clear that it was made with a lot of effort and care by a solo dev. But in the end of the day I have to review the game by what it is.

[b]Writing[/b] You land on an deserted island and have to solve puzzles to get a teleport running again to escape. One thing that Myst always did well was intricate world building, with a lot of details that were not central to solving the puzzles but to give context. Unfortunately, Have Moon feels hollow in this regard, almost like never leaving the main island of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/63660/]Myst[/url]. The world feels empty and, honestly, the (few) written notes are also not that well written.

[b]Aesthetics[/b] The game takes place in a steam-punk setting. It looks good, but nothing extraordinary for a 2016 game. The soundtrack is also pleasant.

[b]Gameplay[/b] The puzzles are at the typical level for Myst (cryptic hints with a lot of guessing and bothersome traveling around islands). [spoiler]Although can you really do a Myst-like game without hiding buttons behind opened doors?[/spoiler] Unlike most Myst entries, movement is continuous in the 3D world (like realMyst). You can't die, and there are deadends. The game auto-saves at any place.

[b]Value[/b] The game is rather short, taking about 5h to complete. Although to be fair, the price tag is also low and it is often on sale. There is a single progress slot, but you can always re-visit previous areas. The achievements are related to progressing the game, and don't require multiple playthroughs (once you finish the game, you respawn back in the main island). I don't see many reasons to replay this, maybe for the puzzles.

I think the presentation is fantastic and I can tell a lot of heart and passion was put into this game, and I hope the creator continues to expand on this if they ever make a sequel

The puzzles are:
A: Illogical at times, such as flipping a pipe valve, but with no indicator where the pipes go. Or flipping the power switches on the cannon island. It's also unexplained WHY you can't go from the House Island from the Telescope Island, but CAN from the Lab Island.
B: (The most detrimental) tedious, for example at one point the player will need to warp from the Telescope Island to the House Island, flip a valve on a 1/3 chance they guessed correctly, warp to Telescope Island, to the Lab Island, then take the airship back to the House Island, pray they got it right (repeat backwards if wrong), and then go back to the lab, back to telescope, 
C: Too similar to the point of confusion; The player will need to activate beacons on each island which will provide the player the radius needed for the telescope, which in turn is needed for the teleporters, HOWEVER the player also needs to rotate the telescope vertically as well And the rotation of the angle is NOT correlated to the beacon, but instead the teleporter (Which geographically doesn't make sense). The player will also pick up two keys, and when one unlocks a door on the Canon Island, I figured the other would unlock the other door... Which it did not, causing me to take the airship, warp back and repeat.

It makes me sad writing this review, cause I thoroughly enjoyed the first two hours of the game and tried to solve everything on my own at first. The Ah-HA moment when I finally unlocked the door to the Lab Island was very satisfying. But after having to warp back and forth again and again and guessing for over an hour, it really dragged this game out. My paitents ran out and had to resort to a guide several times till the end. I think what would of really helped this title was if the puzzles were contained to their own island, akin to Myst having separate Ages with their own unique puzzles and challenges. I feel Haven Moon shares more in common with Riven than its predecessor.

Sometimes nothing changes but a hidden item is now clickable.   
This takes way to much time without some logical prerequisite.
There should be logical reasons to push a valve switch in one direction vs. another.
The towers in the Cannon Island are a prime example of this but there are more examples.

In addition, while solving a puzzle, you are not given an indicator if you're on the right track or not - no lights changing to green and stuff like that - so even if you DO figure out what the puzzle is about, you're still completely in the dark as to whether you're going about it the right way or not (to those who already played the game: I'm especially thinking about the electrical grid puzzle here).

En effet, on se retrouve souvent à faire beaucoup d'aller retour pour savoir si ce qu'on a fait a une action, et comme chaque zone demande d'avoir une animation de transition un peu longue et un chargement, un mode fast travel serait un gros plus. D'ailleurs, comme souvent dans ce genre de jeu, les aller-retour représente bien la moitié du temps de jeu, heureusement que chaque zone n'est pas trop grande et qu'on peut courir.
Ceux qui ont aimé ce jeu adoreront Quern, qui a été développé en même temps avec des idées assez similaire fortuitement. L'avantage de Quern c'est qu'il est le travail d'une équipe plus conséquente et cela se ressent sur beaucoup d'aspects.
Haven Moon serait parfait pour la VR avec quelques adaptations. La durée de jeu et les interactions s'y prêtent bien, plus le plaisir d'explorer ces décor de façon plus tangible.

If you are good at games like this, and maybe a bit more observant than me, it will probably only take you two hours.

The game's playing space is not very big and a lot of time is spent running back and forth between teleporters and loading screens. The story is very basic, not much to say about it. The walking is also very choppy - it almost feels like you are moving on a very fine grid and don't have free movement. Hard to explain. The puzzles - well, maybe I am not observant enough, as mentioned, but I have not understood some of the puzzles and could not find any hints in the very small world. There is also some hunting for hidden switches, which is annoying.

The island you start on is pretty miniscule and hardly suited for any structures to speak of, but there they are anyway, precariously balancing on top of a group of small rocks. The island is deserted and the only sounds are those from the vast ocean or the wind in the trees, which somehow sustain themselves by growing right out of the rock. It’s peaceful. Everything is inviting you to start exploring and learn more.

The other islands are in the same style as the first. There is no stress and no one to disturb you on any of the islands, so you can take your time exploring, solving puzzles, and admiring all the buildings on each island, which are welcoming with lots of detail, while the underlying landscapes, on the other hand, feel a bit lacking, although they do work well enough as a foundation, so it’s a minor complaint.

The puzzles are what make up the gameplay of a Myst-like so that’s what you get and they are properly executed with little exposition. All puzzles are about mastering an unknown device by mastering other unknown devices.

There is a bit of fast-travel once you’ve unlocked it, which is always a lovely bonus, because it avoids what could otherwise become tediously repetitive.

The story was a standard piece of morality and choice, but was of no real consequence for the game. It did have some world building, which was nice, but the story still felt mostly like a container for clues. If I could, I would wish for more in-depth backstory.

It’s easy to tell that Haven Moon is a game for Myst-fans. The puzzles were challenging enough. The environments were well built and detailed. The story was pretty thin, though, so don’t expect to be particularly amazed or excited by that. There’s no free exploration. This game wasn’t my favourite in the genre, but I enjoyed it.

I had a wonderful time playing this. It was a great way to spend all of the 6 hours it took to 100% it.

Apparently the Steam community doesn't agree. It has only a rating of ""Mostly Positive"" which is a score usually reserved for controversial, or ambitious but unfinished games. What did the Steam community have to say about this one? [i]""IT'S NOT MYST!!! IT'S NOT MYST!!! DONT BUY THIS!!! IT'S NOT MYST!!!""[/i]

Well, one can't argue with that. Haven Moon is indeed not Myst. It's also not Half Life or Fallout: New Vegas. So you win this round, Steam community. Your sentiment is factually correct; Haven Moon is indeed not Myst.

Did they even play the game? It's not a flawless game by any stretch. There are some solid points one could make against Haven Moon if they really wanted to. In fact, here are...

[h1]Three points that really got my goat:[/h1]
[olist][*]It takes FOREVER to get around. Whether it's elevators, teleporters, or flying dirigibles, they all take way longer than they should. Given how much backtracking there is in a game like this, these commute times really add up and can break your soul. It's not world building. It's just padding.

[*]At least once, I couldn't progress because I had the game's volume down. I was watching shows while I was playing the game, and naturally I was more interested in hearing the show than the various steampunk noises the game had to offer. So I turned it down. Little did I know how important it is to hear steam. A couple puzzles depend on it.

[*]At one point, I was so desperate for progress, I was checking every single brass bolt on a giant steampunk lighthouse for a hidden keyhole. And what's really troubling isn't that I had so little to go on I had resorted to looking for a needle in a haystack. It's that I actually found it. [b]One of the brass bolts actually [i]is[/i] a hidden keyhole. You're literally supposed to check each and every single bolt, without any hint given that's what you're supposed to do.[/b] That was the worst part of the game. Just wow.
[/olist]

My point is, if you want to hate Haven Moon, there's enough here to work with. You just have to actually play it first to find things to hate. ""It's not Myst"" is not a valid reason to hate Haven Moon.

Anyways like I said, I think it's great. It's a fun snappy little bite-sized Myst-like game that you can complete in a day while you watch a playlist or something. It was a wonderful way to spend my Friday night and frankly, I was just glad to be playing a game that can eventually end at some point.

They should put that on the box: ""Haven Moon is a game that will eventually end. 10/10""",1651375465,1651375574,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game's story is told through notes that you find, which were written by the person who built all the machinery that you're trying to figure out. But I'm reluctant to call it a story to begin with, it's very vague and superficial and really just serves as a backdrop for the puzzle-solving. You do, however, have a choice between two endings, and they transport a simple moral.

Gameplay consists of finding things that you can interact with, experimenting with them, understanding the function and purpose of strange machines, and using them to progress to new locations. Interactable objects are indicated by your focus point (in the middle of the screen) turning green, but some of them are very small and/or hard to see. In many cases, an item will seem inert until you solved a different puzzle first, at which point it will suddenly become interactable. You will have to study minute and seemingly insignificant details carefully to find interactables and clues.

The notes provide you with a rough idea of what you might need to do, but they never tell you _how_ to do it, so you're mostly left to your own devices. The game does not hold your hand - there is no quest marker telling you where to go next, no comments from the protagonist to deliver clues, and no indication why something did not work. This ""oldschool"" adventure gameplay is cherished by gamers who appreciate the increased immersion and challenge, but of course it also bears a higher risk of getting stuck.

Personally I found most of the puzzles logical and not too hard, but I wasn't really in the mood to search for mini-clues for an extended amount of time, so I used a guide for those parts. There's a decent one in the game's community section that gives hints instead of telling you the solution outright - this worked very well for me, as it enabled me to skip long searches that I did not have the time for. Your mileage may vary. I don't think the puzzles themselves will give a seasoned adventure gamer much trouble, but be aware that the game gives very little feedback if something does not work. You basically just have to keep coming up with ideas until one of them works.

While the environments are extremely small (and still show some copy/pasting), they are beautifully designed with crisp high-resolution graphics and fitting environmental sounds. Occasional slow, subdued orchestral music contributes to the solemn atmosphere, but never pushes into the foreground - very well done. You'll have to spend a fairly large portion of your time just getting around (mainly because a puzzle at one location requires changes made at another location, so you'll keep traveling back and forth as you're experimenting with different settings at one place and then check their effect somewhere else). The beauty of the environments makes this less of a problem than it could be.

There is no voice acting in the game (not that it would really need any).

From an accessibility perspective, the experience is fairly decent. By default, the game can be controlled solely with the mouse, though you can optionally use the keyboard for movement. Mouse directions can be inverted. All controls can be rebound in the standard Unity launch window, which is very useful. There is no head-bobbing, but also no FOV slider. Colorblind filters are not present, but not needed either. Players who are deaf or very hard of hearing may run into problems in one area that has several audio cues, though the respective puzzles can be solved based on visuals alone, it's just harder. The game autosaves everywhere - manual saves are not possible, but never needed, though this also means that you only have one save state that keeps getting overwritten. Unfortunately the game uses the Windows registry to save its state, so you cannot transport saves to a different machine.

In short, Haven Moon is a snack-sized myst-like puzzle adventure that I'm recommending to fans of adventure games who do not need much guidance to get through a game like this. I'd suggest getting it on a sale since it doesn't have a lot of content, but that shouldn't be an issue, as it's several years old by now.

- Don't play the German localization. The translation is awful and misleading. Careful reading is crucial though.
- Do look around carefully. Some of the interactive objects are easy to miss, as they either don't look interactive or they're obscured by darkness. And yeah, it doesn't help that a ton of interactive-looking assets are decorative only.

As of last month, you can buy an HD reimagining of Myst on Steam. Now, as somebody who rarely pays more than $5 for a Steam game, you can bet that I'm not going to be buying Myst until at least a couple of year's time. If you're like me, and are patiently waiting for that price to drop, in the meantime, I recommend you play through Haven Moon.

Haven Moon is a beautiful game. The setting is sometimes serene, and other times mysterious and imposing. The graphics are pretty stunning, and with no HUD to interfere with your view of the world around you, everything feels just that smidge more immersive. Finding a way to reach each new location is a satisfying discovery.

The soundtrack and sound design are subtle but brilliant. Occasional orchestral swells enhance the feeling of wonderment, and the ambient sound of the weather shifts the mood between areas.

Haven Moon wasn't particularly long, but it might have been considerably longer if I hadn't looked up a certain solution at one point. Playtime will likely begin to stack up if you get stuck on a section. I'll leave a hint here in case you find yourself in a similar situation to myself at some point: [spoiler]BOLT[/spoiler]. Otherwise, everything logically fell into place, and progress felt earned rather than random. The key to success is to stop and observe your environment as often as possible, and the visuals of the otherworldly setting make it much more tempting to do so of your own accord.

The world of Haven Moon draws you in, and keeps you on the hook throughout. It's inspired by Myst, but stands on its own as a well-executed, self-contained adventure.

The developer is self-taught and he should at least be commended for making a game, which is more than I have done. It's my hope that he'll take this constructive criticism in the spirit with which it was delivered. 

I enjoyed the game's graphics, ambient sound effects and music. Sadly, that was all that I liked.  The game description says the puzzles are intuitive. I would have to disagree with this. The very first puzzle with the two wheels was intuitive, but the lack of clues forced me to either play a game of spot the hidden object or brute force a solution. 

There are also things that seem like clues, but are there to throw you off the correct solution -- the cannon island map, for example. I matched the walkways to the map and discovered that it does not solve that particular puzzle. 

A bit more clues, or some direction, would have been helpful. I eventually had to break down and open a video tutorial. The solution confused me even more as I went back to try and find where any potential clues might have been hidden, but was unable to find a single one. One puzzle had me checking every bolt on a tower for the one magical one that I could use.

I personally would not recommend the game in its current state. I can forgive what looks like puzzles that have been removed. (Any adventure game player is used to this as it is a normal thing for the genre.) I really think it would have benefit from having more QA players so that things that aren't apparent stand out a little more. It took me an hour to find the handle inside the airship.

In the end, I got so frustrated, even while watching a walkthrough and not understanding how they found the solutions, that I just quit and uninstalled it without finishing.",1620709574,1620709574,False,4,0,0.56795501708984375,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It has everything you would want in a Myst game, so if you're a fan of that style, you'll enjoy this and will know what to expect.

The game contains enough clues to show you the answer to all the puzzles it contains, and none are so obtuse that you have to wrack your brain for hours over any of them.

It has the standard array of puzzles: decipher how machines work, get access codes, arrange the world in a specific order to progress, etc. There are really only a couple of points you need to consider before purchasing:

-One puzzle (with three steps) REQUIRES you to be able to hear. If you are deaf, you will need to use a guide at some point or you will not be able to finish the game.
-There is a soft-locking bug on the Home island. If you walk onto the roof of the house, there is a section you can fall through. This plummets you to the ground with no way to get back up (the elevator isn't activated at this point).
-Not a big deal, but there also seems to be a bug with the achievements. I have all 10, but it says I have 9/10 on my Steam page. This may actually be a bug with Steam, though.
-The game is incredibly short. I have 2.9 hours clocked, but it's only that long because I had to restart the game after the mentioned bug. 
-There is a good amount of backtracking. The game is slowed down a lot by needing to use a boat between islands and having to wait for the boat animation to complete (leaving port and docking) each and every time. There is nothing to do but stand still while this is going on. You can't even tab away to check emails because the game pauses in the background.

The game isn't expensive at $10 (I got it for $7), but ~2 hours of gameplay (a good portion of which is just watching the same boat animation over and over) is disappointing.

It's important also to precise that, contrary to what Steam says, it's obviously not a point and click, it's your classic ""I can move around and look at 360 degrees"" exploration game.

The atmosphere is great, it's definitely working with great graphics and cool music. However there aren't many islands and, honestly, there isn't much to do on them. Hence the very short life of the game (less than 5 hours of me and I got stuck twice because of some weird gameplay i'll explain just after).

There's little to no puzzle in reality and it's just some going back and forth between islands. But what really pissed me off, is that I got stuck twice because I dismissed a spot I've already noticed but wasn't actually working. Well... It turns out the spot was the right place to look, but it wasn't ""activated"" yet because it was just a bit too early in the game. The problem is I never checked that spot back because I thought it wasn't a thing, until I checked the walkthrough and shouted ""omg but I already checked that it's not working!"", well it is when the time is right >:( and that happened to me twice!

So that's my point: if you find the place where the keyhole is but don't have the key yet, shouldn't the spot be revealed anyway? It makes no sense to render the keyhole-spot inactivated, that just throws me off course!

here's the 2 spoilers of what got me stuck: [spoiler] I noticed the place where the boat is (at the base) was pretty deep, with stairs going down. I tried to check the place but guess what: you cannot go down! I thought it wasn't an actual spot.... Until it was >:( And the other one was even worst: When at the house I heard the hissing sound coming off the bolt. That bolt was bigger, shinier than the others and it had hinges on it. It felt obvious there was something with that bolt, that I could open it, but no, it was just an element of decor... That is, until you actually get the key, then suddenly you can open the thing and discover a keyhole -__-'' , something I never did, because I had already concluded that bolt wasn't a clue. [/spoiler]

And because of those 2 things, I had to do something I hate when playing those games: looking at a walkthrough, and I had to do it twice, with the same shocking discovery that something wasn't logical about the game!

Oh and talking about logic, the story isn't always very clear. With plot holes (how did I ever get into a teleporter on my planet to get there in the first place?) and inconsistencies [spoiler] (if the teleporters have to face each others, how can the one at the cannon be INSIDE a building) [/spoiler] etc etc. I dunno I was never clear on why I was really here and what that dude wanted to show me / explain to me.

IN CONCLUSION: Buy this game (on sale because it's too short) if you're a myst fan, or a fan of exploration games like this, you'll still enjoy the otherwordly atmosphere, but if you're not a fan, you're not gonna have fun with it, I guarantee you!",1613600399,1613600399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Actions in one part of the world effect things on other parts but you can only know by trial and error, not by logic.

As an avid fan of adventure games from the moment I first played Zork I, I was not a fan of Myst at all. The game's claim to fame is the same as Doom's: It was a much later game in the genre that was heralded as the first. Neither of those titles were as good as many of the games that preceded them (such as Return to Zork or Wolfenstein 3D, to name games from shortly before their overrated counterparts), and hearing that this game was heavily inspired by Myst had me worried.

But honestly, the game itself isn't that bad. It's a free-roam adventure (what kids these days call a ""walking simulator"") with good graphics, sound, and animations. Not the best, mind you, but that just gives it a classic atmosphere that takes you back to the good old days.

The problems begin with the puzzles. This game falls into many of the same pitfalls as Myst did, and one of the biggest problems is that you have to struggle to figure out the coordinate system with very little in the way of clues. In fact, MOST of the puzzles give you little hints here and there that you'll probably miss.

More important is the story. It's sparse but interesting. Unfortunately, it leaves some serious plot holes that are never explained beyond pointing out they exist. It makes this feel as though there should have been a third ending which was left on the cutting room floor. You will also spend most of the game running back and forth (thank the Implementors there's a sprint!) and staring at the screen waiting on travel animations you can't skip.

But overall, there are some good elements to this game, and the basis of some good worldbuilding. It also needs to be noted that this was made by a single person. It won't hold up very well against many of the adventure games of the '80s or '90s, but does scratch an itch without drawing blood in the process.


No score for this, but I'd say it's a bit above average with a few extra points for it being a solo Dev project.

Movement is clunky and awkward and it makes the pixal hunting parts of this 'game' awful. Some of the 'puzzles' are just trial and error until you get it corrrect. You have to control a number of machines and they all are setup in a stupid way. For instance you have a telescope that you rotate. Can you go up from 359 degrees to 0? NO! You have to go all the way back around, going down from 359 to 0, and it takes forever.

In another part you need to input a specific number but you can't see the number from the controls. You have  to go back and forth between the two! This terrible planning occurs throughout the game and is indicative of the overall quality.

Probably the worst aspect is the the game gives wrong information!!! It tells you to do something that is demonstrably wrong. Only looking up a walkthrough did I discover the game used the wrong word in its directions. Awful.

Jedoch gibt es auch einige Punkte, die mir nicht wirklich gefallen haben, auf welche ich hiermit eingehen will:

Rätsel & Lore:

Was mich ein wenig gestört hat, war der Inhalt allgemein. Inseln, die man via Luftschiff/Teleporter erreichen kann, mit wenigen Rätseln, die ich von der Schwierigkeit her als Medium bezeichnen würde, denn auch ich habe bei dem ein oder anderen Rätsel mehr Zeit benötigt, als anfangs gedacht. Grundsätzlich hätte ich mich jedoch über weitere Rätsel gefreut und etwas mehr Lore zu der bereits vorhandenen (ich werde hier nicht spoilern und es deshalb allgemein halten), da ich doch einige Fragen habe, die mir das Spiel so nicht beantworten konnte. Geht so in die Richtung: ""Was ist passiert?"", ""Warum ist es so passiert?"", ""Möglichkeit, in Raum und Zeit einzugreifen und es zu verhindern?"", etc. ;)

Für längeren Spielspaß, hätte ich auf den Inseln entweder mehrere, kleinere Rätsel versteckt (für Lore z. B.) oder generell ein etwas komplexeres Rätselsystem eingebaut, genug Luft nach oben ist auf jeden Fall vorhanden, vor allem für eine der Inseln, wo man Rätsel für Lore implementieren könnte, gerne auch als Aftergamebonus, wenn man die Haupträtsel gelöst hat.

Ergo hat man hier eher einen linearen Rätselverlauf, anstatt eines dynamischen oder sich verzweigenden Rätselverlaufes, was nicht verkehrt ist, jedoch für mich persönlich nicht meinen Geschmack getroffen hat.

Weltaufbau:

Auch, wenn bei mir 11,1h Spielzeit stehen, war ich nach ca. 5h mit dem Spiel durch und habe mir im Anschluss die Landschaft angeschaut, welche sehr gut geworden ist, bedenkt man das Alter des Spiels. Alles sehr fein detailliert und mit viel Liebe positioniert und animiert. Auch finde ich die Implementation von Wetter gut gelungen, allerdings wäre dann ein Tag- und Nachtsystem nicht verkehrt gewesen, um das ganze abzurunden ;)

Dies wird aber von all den kleinen und großen Details wieder wett gemacht, sein es die hinterlassenen Notizen, Zeichnungen, Karten oder die Raumgestaltung generell. Auch die beweglichen Objekte, egal ob Groß oder Klein, sind perfekt aufeinander abgestimmt, dabei gefällt mir die Liebe zum Detail am meisten, egal ob Buch, Notiz, Schraube, Mauertexturen usw., ja selbst Rost wurde hinzugefügt, an manchen Stellen, was ich sehr schön finde :)

Gameplay, Ambiente & Sound:

Das Spiel kann klassisch mit Maus aber auch mit Tastatur+Maus gespielt werden, so wie man es von Mystgames kennt.
Dabei übernimmt die Maus die üblichen Hauptaufgaben, wie das Interagieren mit interaktiven Objekten, etwa für eine Codeeingabe oder zum lesen einer Notiz. Etwas schade ist es hierbei, dass der Gamecursor leider nur ein weißer Punkt ist, welcher zu einem grünen Punkt wird, wenn man mit einem interaktivem Objekt interagieren kann. Hier hätte ich mir zum Designstil einen passenderen Cursor gewünscht, etwa eine klassische Lupe, jedoch etwas auffälliger gestaltet, wenn man interagieren kann. Als Gegenpart, hätte ich mich hierbei für ein Zahnradgeflecht entschieden, welches z. B. eine Uhr darauf antreibt, animiert natürlich. Dies wäre so der Feinschliff gewesen, meiner Meinung nach ;)

Da auch dieser Mystableger auf Musik verzichtet, finde ich es um so wichtiger, passende Sounds zu implementieren und die gab es auch, egal ob vom Wetter oder von sich rotierenden Objekten, jedoch fehlte mir der Bewegungssound, denn anders, als wie in dem ein oder anderen Mystgame, wo mittels Klick ein Kartenabschnitt einfach geladen wird, ist hier eine Gehanimation vorhanden, sprich, das Kameraobjekt, welches der sich bewegende Spieler ist, bewegt sich dynamisch in dieser Welt, auch wenn dafür kein physischer Körper entwickelt wurde. Hier hätte ich mir dennoch passende Bewegungssounds gewünscht, je nach Untergrund. Bei Holz z. B. ein knarren der Dielen und bei Schotter das übliche Knirschen. Aber auch dies ist wieder ein kleineres Detail, welches für mich persönlich wichtig ist, andere Spieler, könnten da auch anderer Meinung sein ;)

Zum Ambiente kann ich nur so viel sagen, dass es meiner Meinung nach perfekt ist. Auf der einen Seite hell, auf der anderen etwas düster. Für mich ein gut balanciertes Verhältnis. Nur das fehlende Tag-/Nachtsystem, macht die ein bzw. andere Beleuchtung obsolet, ansonsten sind die Akzentversuche doch sehr gut gelungen und vor allem die dahinter steckende Symmetrie. Ja genau, alles ist, so weit es mir aufgefallen ist, symmetrisch angeordnet, ohne Versatz dazwischen.

Abgerundet wird das ganze mit ein wenig Natur (Bäume), dem Meer und dem Wetter, wobei es von letzterem ein wenig mehr hätte sein können ;)

Fazit:

Ein sehr schönes Game, wenn auch für Rätselprofis/-experten schnell durchschaut. Für Rätselanfänger, aus meiner Sicht, ein guter Einstieg, ehe man sich den originalen und doch komplexeren Mysträtseln stellt, da das Volumen an Rätseln hier viel geringerer ist. Durch den linearen Ansatz, verpasst man zudem weder ein Rätsel, noch die in dem Spiel eingebaute Lore. Hinzu kommt, dass ich, trotz meiner obigen Anmerkungen, nichts an dem Spiel ändern würde, außer einem Tag-Nachtsystem, da es, so wie es jetzt ist, perfekt harmoniert.

Es ist somit definitiv den Kauf Wert und eine sehr gute Ergänzung, als Myst-Like-Ableger und von mir auf jeden Fall sehr zu empfehlen :)",1602429547,1602429547,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After receiving a comment on this review I've regained a little hope that this game WAS logical after all and was able to complete it with this newly acquired hope.
The game has gradually evolved into a sensible puzzle for me to my huge surprise. I thought I was done with it forever.

- The game looks gorgeous
- The story makes sense
- The ending is kinda nice
- It has that steampunky feel style to it, that many games fail to convey properly

BUT if you're planning to pick this game up, please be warned 

- The clues are scarce, especially visual ones, the game won't hold your hand (even when it's necessary for a good experience). But if you know that the puzzles are logical after all, you'll be able to figure them out (sometimes after a lot of time depending on your luck)
- the game takes its freaking time. It feels like I'm still sitting in one of its vehicles waiting for it to arrive to the destination. And there's no good excuse for these long vehicle animations. Everything is loaded, but the game is still keeping me inside an elevator. And that's provided you'll have to go back and forth a lot.
- The game doesn't seem smooth for some reason even on a high end PC 4 years after the game's release

I decided for up, even though the game has some serious flaws.

The pros: it perfectly, *perfectly* captures the aesthetics of Myst. Lost island in the middle of an endless ocean, steampunk constructions and devices, grandiose architecture. The mood is perfect.

Lots of elements seems to be inspired from original Myst titles. From the original Myst, we have [spoiler]the beacon switches, the lightouse/telescope combo, the polygonal fortress in the middle of the sea[/spoiler]. From Riven, we can recognize [spoiler]the island formation linked by airships and teleporters, the inhabited lab island, the elevator puzzle with a non-obvious 3rd floor[/spoiler]. The [spoiler]teleporting spheres[/spoiler] from Obduction, the [spoiler]Coordinate-based puzzle[/spoiler] from Myst 5 and/or Uru.

However, where the Myst series raveled in little unsignificant details that brought much to the mood, Haven Moon is very minimalistic in that regard (although it's already an outstanding result for a one-man effort).

The disappointment came mostly from the length (the game space is quite small, smaller than all Myst games, i'd say) and from the puzzle design. The original games were full of intricate devices, whose function would originally be obscured, but ended up being quite logical; in a couple of instances, you had to go pixel hunting and find a tiny detail to unblock a path, but those were rare.

The game is maximum three hours long, and consists of one single puzzle that gets completely convoluted and hides pieces in places that can only be found via walkthroughs instead of guiding the player to discover it via context clues and exploration the way Myst did.

Overall, the game does have a Myst-like atmosphere, especially the style of the islands, the controls, and some of the story.
Visually, it looks quite good and there was definitely a good effort put into it by the developer.

However, as others have mentioned, this game suffers from a couple of major flaws. The first flaw involves the puzzles themselves, and the issue is that some (though not all, maybe 20%) are quite illogical and needlessly time-consuming. One example is the ""hissing bolts"", as nowhere in the game or its instructions does it say that audio is required to complete the game. Some other puzzles are also not intuitive and require pixel hunting, or very far fetched assumptions (like the condenser puzzle.)

The second flaw is the low amount of actual puzzles, especially ones that deal with analysis, logic and deduction (vs. the random testing of possible solutions/configurations.) It feels like this is compensated by the game's location structure which requires the player to spend tons of time travelling between various islands just to activate one obvious button or lever.

Overall the game was a decent effort, but in my humble opinion, the above issues push it's recommendation level from a weak ""Yes"" to a weak ""No"".",1595030258,1595030258,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is quite an accomplishment for a 'one person' development team!

There were a couple of aspects that I was not thrilled about. First, prepare to do A LOT of traversing between islands. There are 4 and you can teleport or take an 'air boat.'  Often puzzles require steps in multiple locations. So, if you have forgotten something, you will be backtracking again and again.

Additional travel is required by the fact that some puzzles give no obvious signal when they are correctly solved. You may pull a switch in one area and have no idea what changed. You may have effected something close by or activated something in another area and the only way to tell is to start looping back through the islands looking for a difference.
The game saves on exit so you will not lose progress at any point and it allows you to replay the ending so that you can experience the result of making different choices.

This game is an adventure/puzzle game. Heavily inspired by the [i]Myst[/i] series of point-and-click games, [i]Haven Moon[/i] follows a very similar format. You must travel around the world you find yourself in, gather clues, and solve puzzles. Indeed, as a big fan of the [i]Myst[/i] games, this game immediately caught my interest due to its similarities.

I thought the graphics in this game looked pretty good. Because my computer is a little older, I did have to turn down the graphical settings to get the game to run, but I was still impressed with the detail in the game. The game does a great job of invoking a [i]Myst[/i]-like setting with its steampunk-esque aesthetic and inspiration taken from the stories of Jules Verne.

The music was another great addition to this game and I was really impressed with the variety available that suited the various environments and situations encountered.

The actual gameplay was a little bit more mixed for me. As many other reviewers have noted, this is not a long game. I went into this game pretty much blind and did not use any walkthroughs or hints to get through the game. It only took me about five-and-a-half hours to complete the game which includes the two endings. Perhaps being a veteran of the [i]Myst[/i] games gave me an edge, but this is not a game that will entertain you for a long time and also has very limited replay value. I found most of the puzzles to be fair. There were definitely a few frustrations with some of them, but I did not find any of them unreasonably difficult. It does take some trial-and-error since you often have to experiment just to figure out what certain levers or switches do.

I was disappointed with the story in the game. Being a puzzle game, there is a not a lot of focus on the story, but I still felt much more could have been added. There are hints in the game of an interesting background story, but it is never expanded upon. This really felt like a lost opportunity for more detailed world building.

More or less is to give power to a certain machinery and to unlock an area. When you unloack an area, usually, in this are you find the clues to unlock the other area and so on. At a certain point there is a somehow ""hidden puzzle"" but if you think better also this puzzle is realted to a small area that before was not accessible.

        [td][b]an AVERAGE game...[/b]

This is a Myst-like little indie game barely average, almost mediocre... Yes it hurts me not to be able to say better things about this game because I realize perfectly how much effort was put into it by only one man. However, it is very classic/dry, it is much too few and short in terms of content, the puzzles are very dry and not very entertaining, the story does not take you away... I believe it could have been a student/art project that would THEN lead to gathering a team and making a complete game out of it - then it would kind of be Myst all over again for a good, 80%-ranked game. As is, I am sorry, I had no fun, I just finished it because I am Myst fan and it gave me a little feeling of it. I believe the author is gifted though and I look forward to seeing his future works. To sum it up: if you really need your Myst fix, you may try it, but you would not miss anything by forgetting it.

I'm always on a lookout for games in this mold and this little gem, together with Quern, is one of the better ones I have played in recent years. 

Nitpicks
There are a few instances where feedback could be a bit better and it is possible to lock off one ending by leaving the vehicle at the house, then disabling the alternative arrival method but departing via the same. But, as typical for the genre, playing through a second time when one knows what to do is done rather quickly, so I was able to get the second ending and 100% the game.

I have read some of the critical comments before and must say that most of the complaints made do not ring true to me: Sure, the puzzles may seem contrived at times, but that is true for pretty much any game of the genre, especially the myst games themselves and in the end this game gives you all the information you need to solve every single puzzle and there is never really a need to guess or try super vague stuff.

Although it has a very polished feel, it is the work of an individual who so loved Myst that he constructed his own game - thank you, sir!

In a way, this game is like one of the worlds in Myst - as such there are linear elements.  Puzzles must be solved in a particular order.  From a constructive coaching perspective, it would be helpful to have the cursor turn to a question mark or X when encountering a control that doesn't work until something else is done such as enabling power - I admit it confused me a number of times when a control that should have worked didn't, and in some cases I didn't try the control again right away because I didn't think it was a control since nothing happened.

Storywise: [spoiler]I would have loved to know what happened with Ektor. The mystery of the lights in the ocean should have been solved somehow...[/spoiler].

Puzzlewise: Like Quern, I found the puzzles a bit too linear. I would have liked to have multiple puzzles at the same time, where you don't know which one to solve first. I feel this was almost achieved here (in contrast to Quern), but as the game was so short and the world so small, there was not much room for that.

Enginewise: I got a bit annoyed by the travel animations. While beautiful at first, after having to go back and forth by the different means available to gather clues, I would have loved an option to skip that.

It takes a number of cues from ""Myst"" but successfully creates a world of its own. Overall, I enjoyed playing ""Haven Moon"" due to its nice graphics, good sound, good puzzles and decent atmosphere building. 

However, the game is not without flaws, AFAIC. It is rather short and not strong on story. Progress is pretty linear as well and I find unnecessarily so. The setup would have supported more player-driven exploration/progress but I guess increasing opportunities for non-linear progress would have made the game larger and that would have been unfeasible for the single developer. 

Sadly, for some reason I could not proceed at one stage even though I had exactly the right idea what to do. Apparently,[spoiler]the levers for the airship controls needed to be swapped regarding their settings, even though the ordering never appeared to make a difference before.[/spoiler] I find such hindrances to be very annoying because what should have been a rewarding moment -- confirmation that I figured out the correct solution -- and a fluid continuation of the story/progress, turned into a stumbling block, sending me around the locations looking for clues and ultimately to the internet trying to find a soft hint. Too bad. 

With one exception, all puzzles were nice and fair. Again, the one exception -- [spoiler]the hidden puzzle on telescope island[/spoiler] -- is a bit of a deal breaker in my view as one does not get any hints whatsoever as to where to look / what the next sub-goal should be. In other cases, it wasn't clear to me what I had achieved by actuating a lever. That's fine if you have a chance of figuring it out somehow, but personally I hate it when the best available strategy for doing so is to look almost everywhere for a change. I much prefer when cables/pipes leading away from the lever give me a clue about what it affects. I felt the game started excellently in that regard, but later on used obscure effects which I personally don't like at all.

On the whole, environments where beautifully designed and pleasant to look at, but there could have been more world-building / creation of atmosphere by allowing the player to learn more about the former inhabitant(s). There is a bathroom in the game which is really nice looking and surely has required a lot of work to create but it serves no purpose at all except lending some credibility to the location. Such a room could have contained some personal items that one could have inspected and thus received a better sense about the person that once used the bathroom.
 
I found the standard walking speed to be too fast. This type of game should not be approached with speed running in mind. One should be able to enjoy the scenery and get a sense of calmness that the environment otherwise implies. I found that the slowest speed at times made it difficult to navigate in tight spaces. Perhaps the speed should be adaptive, depending on the context. I very much liked being able to use the Shift-Forward fast speed and don't mind if this running mode is unrealistically fast. Zipping through areas when one knows where to go is fine, but the standard speed should not make one feel rushed or impede navigation in tight spaces. 

I expected to be able to have more control over graphics settings, e.g., what amount of anti-aliasing, etc. but there are no choices, except over display resolution. 

Despite my niggles, I found playing ""Haven Moon"" to be an enjoyable experience. In fact, I felt the ending came too soon. I hope the developer will create another title in that genre sometime in the future.",1541854498,1541854662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich habe das Game nun 2 Stunden gespielt, oder eher gesagt ""versucht"" es zu spielen und ich mus sagen dass es das schlechteste Puzzel/Rätsel Spiel ist was ich je gespielt habe (und ich habe viele gespielt).

Klar sieht es gut aus und man erwartet hier etwas sehr interessantes und aufregendes, aber leider ist dem nicht so.

Die Rätsel sind sowas von unlogisch, das man da entweder nur drauf kommt wenn man ein Super-Genie aus dem Welltall ist oder der Entwickler selbt. Ich habe es in den 2 Stunden ohne Web-Hilfe jedenfalls nicht geschafft.

Beispiel 1:
Man reist zu der ersten Insel, dort gibt es eine Tür mit [u]vierstelligen[/u] Zahlenschloß die man öffnen muss, aber weit und breit kein Code. 

Den Code erhält man durch folgende Tätigkeiten: 
- den Leuchturm der auf der Insel steht einschalten. Dieser blinkt dann in Abständen 2 mal
- man fährt zurück auf die andere Insel und richtet ein Teleskop auf den blinkenden Leuchtturm aus. 
- Durch das Ausrichten sieht man auf der dazugehörigen Amatur die jeweils 2 Felder mit 3 Zahlen hat eine Kombination aus Zahlen, in diesen Fall 6 Nullen.
- Hierdraus ergibt sich nun der Code für die Tür, der wie folgt zusammengestellt wird: Zwei Lichtzeichen vom Leuchtturm und 3 Nullen aus den 2 Feldern ergibt?........RICHTIG!........2000

Der Code für die Tür lautet also 2000

Wer zum Hänker denkt sich bitte solch einen Schwachsinn aus???

Beispiel 2:
Auf der nächste Insel sind 12 Antenen mit Schaltern, die man entsprechend einstellen muss damit eine Voltzahl stimmt.
Leider ist die Anzeige auf der man die Voltzahl abliest nicht in der Nähe, nein sie ist versteckt in ein kleinem Raum zu den man immer hinlaufen muss und damit das ganze nicht zu einfach wird sind die 12 Antennen nur über Brücken zu erreichen, die man vorher mit anderen Schalten zurechdrehen muss um überhaupt ran zu kommen. Und nein, man kommt nicht an alle Antennen gleichzeitig ran, das wäre ja zu einfach, man muss immer schön die Brücken drehen und schalter betätigen und ablesen gehen.

Das ist praktisch wie Lotto spielen und eine reine Glückssache und hat nichts mit Rätseln zu tun, sondern nur mit in die länge gezogene nervige Aufgaben.

Ich habe dan aufgehört mich zu quälen und mir den Rest der Web-Lösung des Spiels angeschaut und ich mus sagen: 

""Das ganze wird und wird nicht besser""

In den Option ist ein Button ""Lies Mich"", hier erzählt der Entwickler ganz stolz das er ein großer ""Myst-Fan"" ist und er ganze 20 Jahre gebraucht hat um Erfahrung zu sammel um dieses Spiel zu entwickeln.

Ich glaube er hätte ruhig noch weitere 20 Jahre draufpacken können und es wäre nichts besseres bei raus gekommen.

________________________

+ If you like Myst and can't get enough of that kind of realm then you will fall in love with this game
+ Once you 'get' how the machines work they become quite intuitive (I see a lot of complaints that some puzzles were random but I assure you EVERYTHING has a reason)
+ Beautiful areas, scenery, music and machines.
+ Only get to interact with what is important.  You can't open every drawer and flick on and off every lightswitch.  Haven Moon is not a walking sim, it is a puzzle game and it keeps you focused on what is important to solve the puzzles at hand.

Cons

- Could do with a better save system.  Even a 3 slot save would suffice.
- I would have liked to have seen more back story,  (Maybe this is something we will see in a future release?)
- Some areas felt like they were set pieces for bigger things to come but they were never fully used (The Laboratory looked like it had so much more purpose.  Bit of wasted potential there.)
- Unsure who I am, why I was brought to this land and where I ended up

La plupart des évaluations que j’ai lues font part de cette similarité entre Myst et Haven Moon. Edité & Développé par François Roussel, Haven Moon semble être, par conséquent, un Myst-like.  Mais je ne peux ni le confirmer, ni l’infirmer puisque je n’ai jamais joué à Myst !  J’admire cependant la volonté de monsieur Roussel et notamment son obsession pour Myst, et je l’admirerais certainement davantage encore si j’avais joué au produit de sa psychose.

Mais passons aux choses sérieuses, dans l’ensemble j’ai apprécié Haven Moon mais il y a tout de même quelques détails qui viennent tâcher ce tableau. 

En tant que Myst-like, Haven Moon est donc un jeu de réflexion et d’exploration. J’dois avouer avoir un peu de mal avec la trame narrative, je la trouve introduite peut être trop facilement et j’ai l’impression que tous les documents que je trouve s’adressent directement à moi. Sachant ce qui est arrivé à ce charmant Ektor Turren, je dois avouer ne pas comprendre tant de bienveillance et d’optimisme à l’égard d’un intru potentiellement dangereux. C’est le cas surtout pour les premiers documents, plus on avance et moins on a cette impression. Autrement je trouve que l’on est plutôt bien porté et que l’exploration se profile toute seule.

En ce qui concerne les énigmes, outre une d’entre elles, je trouve qu’elles ont un degré de difficulté très intéressant. La susnommée différente repose à mon avis trop sur l’aléatoire plutôt qu’une vraie logique… Ce qui du coup frustre un tantinet, et ce pour pas grand chose. 

Je n’ai, pour finir, aucun reproche à faire au niveau des graphismes ni au niveau de la bande son, ou alors très peu et je ne m’en souviens pas. Quant à la fin du jeu, je la trouve pleine de moral et très intéressante bien qu’au final assez “simple”… A vous de la découvrir.

Personnellement, j’ai apprécié Haven Moon, mais il mériterait plutôt un “[i]A titre d’information[/i]” à mon sens.

Aufgrund manch negativer Bewertung war ich skeptisch, nun im Summer Sale habe ich den Kaufen-Button geklickt und es nicht bereut. Auch wenn nicht alles perfekt ist, bot mir das Spiel im Großen und Ganzen das was ich erwartet habe: Myst-Feeling.

[b]Pro[/b]

Die Spielwelt ist toll gestaltet und es macht Spaß sie zu erkunden. Die Steuerung ist einwandfrei und für passende Atmosphäre sorgen Hintergrundmusik und Soundeffekte.

An Grafik und Sound gibt es nicht viel auszusetzen, mir sind lediglich Kleinigkeiten aufgefallen, z.B. flimmerte mal eine Textur, manche Lichtreflexe wirkten irgendwie seltsam unnatürlich (kann beides aber auch an meinem System liegen) oder die Musik erschwerte das Hören eines für ein Rätsel wichtigen Soundeffekts (möglicherweise habe ich auch nur den Lautstärkeregler für die Hintergrundmusik übersehen).

Die bemängelte Kürze der Spieldauer kann man gut oder schlecht finden; für 2€ (im Summer Sale) hatte ich 3 Stunden gute Unterhaltung, ein super Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis. Dass man dabei noch problemlos 100% der Achievements abstauben kann ist noch ein netter Bonus obendrauf.

Loben möchte ich auch, dass Linux bei den unterstützten Betriebssystemen berücksichtigt wurde.

Nun aber zu dem, wo Haven Moon definitiv noch Potential nach oben hat:

[b]Con[/b]

Vielleicht bin ich nur zu doof die Rätsel zu verstehen, aber manchmal kam ich mir vor wie der Ochs vorm Berg und selbst als ich mir mal nen Tipp im Netz geholt hatte, fragte ich mich wie man da hätte drauf kommen sollen oder wie die Logik dahinter ist.

Zwei Beispiele, wo es besonders zutrifft:
[list]
[*][spoiler]Ich habe nicht herausfinden können, woran man einen defekten Kondensator - Ursache für den ""erratic current"" - auf ""Cannon Island"" erkennen soll. Ich habe die Notizen nochmal gelesen, mir die Karte von ""Cannon Island"" nochmal angesehen, geschaut ob Kondensatoren defekt ausehen und gehört ob welche komische Geräusche von sich geben, doch letztlich musste ich die Lösung zu Rate ziehen, da stupides Ausprobieren für mich nicht in Frage kam.[/spoiler]
[*][spoiler]Die Logik hinter dem Koordinatensystem zur Positionsbestimmung hat sich für mich nicht erschlossen. Nehme ich an, dass die konzentrischen Kreise auf der Karte ""Island Installations"" bedeuten, der Teleporter auf ""Telescope Island"" ist der Mittelpunkt und 0° ist senkrecht nach oben, etwa zur Mitte von ""Laboratory Island"" hin, dann müsste der Beacon dort bei etwa 5°, der Teleporter (wenn ich richtig verstanden habe also die Signalquelle) bei ca. 390° liegen. Wieso aber ist beides bei 0°, nur unter unterschiedlichem Höhenwinkel, zu sehen? Auch hier habe ich nach etwas Ausprobieren in die Lösung schauen müssen - schade, das Rätsel hatte mir anfangs besonder gefallen.[/spoiler]
[/list]

Dass das Spiel die Spracheinstellung von Steam und vom Betriebssystem (beides bei mir Englisch) ignoriert ist auch irgendwie unsauber gelöst. Bis ich herausgefunden hatte, dass man ohne Neustart oder -installation die Sprache wechseln kann, spielte ich auf Deutsch anstatt auf Englisch und kann nun auch was zur Übersetzung sagen: Diese ist wirklich holprig und dadurch teilweise recht unverständlich. Beispiel: ""Once triggered"" im Englischen ist auf Deutsch: ""Wenn man den knops anlässt"" ... ähm ... genau ;-)

Ein wenig schade finde ich, dass Schubladen und Schränke nicht zu öffnen und Bücher nicht zu lesen sind. Das ist zwar für's Spiel nicht notwendig, würde die Welt jedoch detailreicher machen - z.B. könnte man in den Büchern nicht mehr geschützten Werke anzeigen lassen, wenn man die in reinem Text abspeichert und mit nem netten Font anzeigt dürfte der Speicherplatzbedarf vernachlässigbar sein. Zugegeben man müsste sich dann noch was mit dem Cursor oder den Hinweisen einfallen lassen, da momentan alles mit dem man interagieren kann fürs Vorankommen wichtig ist.

[h1]Haven Moon[/h1]
[h1]Ou : Les mécaniques du passé [/h1]

Commencer une critique d’un jeu qui a été développé par une seule personne est toujours quelque chose de difficile (surtout quand cette personne dédie ce jeu à son fils) ; car j’ai le sentiment d’agir en monstre sans cœur. 

Alors je vais mettre de l’eau dans mon vin en commençant par faire mon mea-culpa et en citant les qualités de ce jeu, avant de lancer tel un parpaing ses défauts. 

[u]Mon Problème :[/u]

Premièrement je ne me considère pas comme une personne douée pour les jeux de réflexion en général, pour l’instant je n’ai réussi qu’à finir l’histoire principale de » The Talos Principe » par mes propres moyens et donc m’attaquer à un jeu d’énigmes se la jouant « odl-school » a surement été une trop grande difficulté pour moi.

Et justement vu que l’on parle du côté « old-school » du jeu, je n’ai pas encore eu la chance de jouer au jeu dont l’auteur s’inspire, je veux parler de : « Myst » donc il se peut que j’ai raté les hommages et idées que Haven Moon Fait à Myst.


[u]Les qualités:[/u] 

Il est clair que si je dois donner des qualités au jeu c’est tout son « emballage » ; les décors et shaders sont magnifiques (peut être tirés de Myst mais peu importe), il y une musique qui accompagne magistralement les zones de jeu et une histoire qui a le mérite d’être claire et logique.
Puis vient le reste …

[u]Les défauts:[/u]

Le principal a mes yeux pour Haven Moon est tout simplement ses énigmes (en particulier une) qui varient de la logique au simple hasard (comme tourner tous les leviers sauf un POURQUOI JUSTE UN ?), il m’a été impossible de finir le jeu sans solution, et je ne suis pas le seul.
Ensuite, il y a clairement des problèmes d’ergonomie : pour changer de zone vous devez toujours revenir sur l’ile de base ce qui devient vite lassant. 

Mais tous ces problèmes s’expliquent tout simplement car le développeur a pris pour exemple Myst un jeu sorti en 1993 et qui (d’après les joueurs s’étant essayé au titre) est dur, donc évidement Haven Moon allait suivre ce même mode de jeu : ringard, et donc être moins accessible pour un public actuel.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]

C’est donc avec une certaine tristesse que je vous déconseille Haven Moon car malgré son univers et son ambiance, il n’est clairement pas pensé ni adapté pour un public « casual » donc je fais partie, ce qui a fait de mon expérience avec le jeu un moment frustrant où on se sent débile.",1530145236,1608994815,True,0,0,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Plot[/h1]

The plot is definitely not the selling point of the game. 
The story is fairly simple. You arrive through a teleporter on Seleos moon. The place appears to be deserted, so you start exploring, following clues from notes left behind by the inventor of a complex teleportation system. 

I found the story not very developed and a few points stayed unanswered in the end. [spoiler]What exactly happend to planet Menra? Where did the inventor go? What were those mysterious lights he saw? And can the player really go back home? This was not really clear.[/spoiler] Maybe a sequel is planned? I really would like to.


[h1]Puzzles[/h1]

I enjoyed the puzzles very much. They are few (about 10 I think) but very creative, their main goal being to reactivate a huge teleportation system. 


[h1]Exploration[/h1]

Seleos appears to mostly be a world of water with 4 different islands to explore. 
The way teleportations worked in the game reminded me of Obduction (but with a short loading time...).

The aspect of the game I was disappointed in was the feeling of emptiness imparted by the different places in the game. There were nearly no object to interact with. Closets and drawers could not be opened. Books could not be read. And it did not feel like a place where someone used to live.


Despite its flaws, Haven moon was a very enjoyable puzzle game and I quite liked the twist about what the treasure is. I hope there will be a sequel.",1529838114,1529838152,True,2,0,0.526749014854431152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Haven Moon ist ein Point and Click Adventure im Stile von Myst. Die Story ist dabei recht simpel im Stile von: Du bist auf dieser Insel und nun versuche wieder weg zu kommen. Dabei kann man jedoch durch einige Notizen ein wenig über die Welt erfahren, auf der man sich befindet. Es ist jedoch nicht so tief, dass man sich drin verlieren kann. Grundsätzlich gilt in diesem Spiel, dass die Rätsel manchmal einfacher sind, als man denkt. Versucht nicht die Karten abzuschätzen, es gibt andere Wege. Und spielt das Spiel mit Ton, sonst entgehen euch Hinweise.

Zudem der tolle Soundtrack. Sobald man einige Bereiche betritt fängt eine Melodie an zu spielen, welche sehr schön ist. Das kann sich sehen lassen. Auch Soundeffekte sind ok und nicht störend. Grafisch sieht das Spiel überraschend gut aus, obwohl es mit der Unity Engine erstellt wurde. Die Steuerung ist typischerweise einfach.

Ich schwanke, ob ich das Spiel empfehlen soll, jedoch hat das Ende sehr überzeugt, so rein Message-mäßig. Oder viel mehr die beiden Enden. Darum gibt es auf jeden Fall einen Daumen nach oben.

[b][i]Alors que je profitais enfin de vacances bien méritées, je fus soudainement téléporté sur la lune d'une planète lointaine. Passé le choc et la surprise, je constatais qu'un singulier réceptacle s'était ouvert en face de moi. Regardant aux alentours, je remarquais que je me trouvais sur une sorte de place ornant le sommet d'un affleurement rocheux au milieu d'une gigantesque étendue aquatique. Le style architectural des bâtiments n'était pas sans rappeler le steampunk à la [/i]Jules Verne[i]. M'approchant du réceptacle susmentionné, je vis qu'il renfermait une lettre manuscrite. Surprenant, pensai-je. Même sur une lune d'une planète éloignée, on parle la langue de Gérard Bouchard. Du coup, ça tombe bien, je vais pouvoir comprendre ce qui est écrit. En l'occurrence, ladite lettre m'informe qu'un trésor est caché sur une île et que je peux potentiellement en prendre possession. Bah, c'est cool, ça va me permettre de payer mon loyer... Si j'arrive à rentrer chez moi. S'en suit alors une suite d'énigmes plus ou moins capilotractées pour atteindre le trésor. Cependant, ce qui me frappait, pendant mon séjour sur cette lune, plus que le fait qu'elle soit assez grosse pour posséder une atmosphère dense et respirable et assez bien située pour présenter de l'eau liquide, c'est le manque de logique des transports en commun. Quel ingénieur a pensé que ce serait une bonne idée de ne pouvoir choisir sa destination que depuis une seule île, obligeant à faire des aller-retours pour voir les autres ? Si je le trouve, je ne réponds plus de rien ![/i][/b]

Bref, ce petit récit résume assez bien mon avis sur ce jeu. Faisant partie d’un groupe de curateurs, j’ai reçu une copie gratuite, mais je m’efforce de rester impartial. Je [i]recommande[/i] ce jeu, car je ne vais pas faire une évaluation négative, ce serait injuste. Cependant, j’aurais préféré pouvoir sélectionner la catégorie [i]à titre d’information[/i]. En effet, je ne peux pas dire que je me sois vraiment amusé en y jouant. Ce n’est d’ailleurs peut-être pas le but du jeu. Le développeur (chapeau au passage, c’est un sacré boulot) présente son jeu comme un [i]Myst-like[/i]. N’ayant pas connu ce jeu, je ne peux donc pas saisir la pleine dimension de son hommage, mais j’imagine que [i]Myst[/i] doit être assez similaire au présent jeu. Ce qui signifie qu’il s’agit de résoudre des énigmes et des puzzles pour arriver au bout du jeu. Malheureusement, ces énigmes sont souvent trop capilotractées pour ne pas devoir la solution au pur hasard. Là où un jeu comme [i]Portal[/i] fait chauffer vos neurones pour trouver la solution d’une salle de test, [i]Haven Moon[/i] (traduisible par [i]havre lunaire[/i]) est plutôt du genre à vous faire chercher dans tous les coins de la map un petit détail qui vous permettra d’avancer, sans forcément faire appel à votre réflexion, mais plutôt à votre chance. De ce fait, le jeu est assez laborieux, voire parfois frustrant. Je pense en particulier au système de déplacement du jeu. Les téléporteurs servent l’intrigue et le gameplay, mais le fait de devoir TOUJOURS retourner sur l’île de base pour choisir votre destination finit par se révéler assez pénible. N’aurait-il pas été possible d’ajouter un tableau de commande sur les autres îles qui se déverrouille après avoir trouvé leurs coordonnées ? 

Peut-être ne suis-je pas assez réceptif à ce genre de jeu. C’est aussi pour ça que je ne peux pas lui donner d’évaluation négative. Certains joueurs apprécieront ce gameplay, mais ce n’est pas mon cas. Mis à part cela, ce jeu a plus ou moins été développé par une seule personne. Rien que pour ça, je dis respect. Les graphismes sont on ne peut plus corrects et je n’ai pas rencontré le moindre bug. Je conclurai donc mon opuscule de la façon suivante : ce jeu est assez frustrant mais il en vaut la peine. Plus que la morale d’altruisme qu’il essaie de faire passer, je trouve que c’est la difficulté qui donne toute sa valeur au trésor final. Si c’était trop facile, ça perdrait son intérêt.

A sole developer made this game, and has better overall quality than most other such games.  Want to recommend the game, but cannot.

The game lacks depth.  Most of the scenery, while pretty, is repetive.  Very little interaction.  For instance, have a library, but cannot read any books.  Have doors and closets, but cannot open them.  Have faucets, but cannot turn them.  They are all for show.

Spent most of the game determining the magic pair of angles for each island to teleport between them. However, those coordinates are RELATIVE angles to the FIRST island.  The coordinates are NOT absolute. So going to the FOURTH island at the end and using the SAME angles to point the cannon there at the SECOND or THIRD islands makes no sense.

Haven Moon seems closer to the old-style of puzzle ala Myst than people probably should give it credit for. I remember being stuck for days on a certain puzzle in Myst back before you could simply Google an answer, or whinge on a forum. HM gave me that same feeling in a few places. I could easily, lazily, blame the logic on the game - or refresh my ego and look at the puzzle from a different vantage.

I've played a lot of puzzle adventure games in the flavor of the classic Myst series and I count Haven Moon among the good ones. The visuals are great and the puzzles are mostly clever. I noticed that some people have complained about the puzzles being too convoluted or the mechanics being too arbitrary (sometimes games force things to be a certain way for no logical reason other than to force a puzzle onto you), but I'd have to disagree here. The way some things function seemed silly and arbitrary to me at first, but once I thought about it and connected the mental dots, I realized they actually have a reasonable purpose. I can't really explain them here because of spoilers, but I have my suspicions that the people complaining possibly just didn't see the whole picture.  That being said, there are things like buttons/switches/levers that you could interact with without there being any real clear indication as to what they were for or whether they were working.  It's a minor nitpick, though, in my opinion. After a little experimentation it eventually comes together.

The puzzles aren't really too difficult, either. I found myself missing solutions not because they were hard to find but rather because I was over-complicating things myself.

The game isn't very long, either, depending on your problem solving ability. Took me just a few hours, but they were an enjoyable few hours.",1518250971,1518251330,True,2,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Paradoxically, the game manages to be very similar to its inspiration but at the same time very different. It's a feeling very hard to describe in words, and one should probably experience it for themselves. Playing [i]Haven Moon[/i] ""feels"" like playing a mini [i]Myst[/i] game (a shorter and an easier version),  but at the same the game introduces a handful of new and unique elements that do not have a correspondence in [i]Myst[/i] games, yet fit perfectly in that atmosphere.

From all the games in the [i]Myst[/i] series, I find that [i]Haven Moon[/i] resembles [i]Riven[/i] the most. The setup is similar: while [i]Riven[/i] consists of 5 islands connected by trams, [i]Haven Moon[/i] is a world composed of 4 islands between which you can travel using an airship or a teleporter device. The architecture of the buildings share a common style and is in both games based on a mix between iron contraptions and stone.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1295852424

Although the story from [i]Riven[/i] is much richer and consists of several layers, [i]Haven Moon[/i] provides a pretty straightforward, yet very complete experience. The story itself unravels only via the notes you can find lying around - all of them being addressed to you. Unlike [i]Myst[/i], in [i]Haven Moon[/i] there are no cutscenes and no extra locations where you can enlarge your knowledge about the games' lore (there is a library, but the books are non-interactive).

The notes progressively unravel your purpose in game. The [i]Myst[/i]erious world in which you are teleported straight from the beginning is Selos - the moon of planet Menra. In previous times, Menra suffered a cataclysmic event which had only one survivor - the writer of the notes, Ektor Turren. He discovered this world before the cataclysm and built a safe heaven for himself in there; he explains that he chose you as the heir of his belongings and guides you through these notes in finding your way back home. In the end you're faced with one choice that triggers either a good or a bad ending, both of them leaving a lot of space for interpretation of what actually happened to Ektor Turren.

Needless to say, the gameplay is based on exploration and interacting with different contraptions, finding their secrets in order to solve various puzzles. In [i]Myst[/i] games, it often happens that a mini-puzzle represents just an isolated piece of a greater puzzle and understanding how all of them fit in the master plan takes a lot of patience and vast exploration. In Heaven Moon, the puzzles are more straightforward, one can say that they're designed to be solved one after another and there's little space for doing them wrong. However, a couple of these puzzles rely a bit too much on trial and error (example: finding some specific coordinates) - after you reach the solution everything makes sense and it seems to you that it was logic all along, but sometimes there are not enough hints to guide you to that logic, or the elements that one would naturally use as ""hints"" (example: specific markers on the map that could hint to those coordinates) are not actual hints. However, these are isolated cases and most of the times the puzzles are very intuitive, but at the same time rather challenging. You know what the goal is, but reaching it takes some effort.

For me, the puzzles were very enjoyable and finding the solution to them was overall a thrilling experience. There is one thing that bothered me slightly during 1 or 2 puzzles, namely that the consequence of performing a specific action was not clearly shown to the player. For example, by inserting a key in a key slot, a mechanism was triggered, but there was no animation to show you where the mechanism was, you were only able to hear a sound of it activating, but not being able to localize it. For that, you had to scout the island again and check what changed. Considering that the islands had only a few locations each, this was not a big trouble, but still a bit bothersome and it would have been nice to also have a graphical depiction of the mechanism activation, in addition to the sound.

[i]Haven Moon[/i] takes on average 5 hours to complete. With its recent price sink and newly added achievements, it's a very strong recommendation from my part and a must buy for [i]Myst[/i] lovers, especially during sales.

From all the [i]Myst[/i] ""clones"" out there, I find [i]Haven Moon[/i] to be the first game that manages to raise up to my expectations regarding a [i]Myst[/i]-like game and it does that without being a copy-cat of its predecessors. On the contrary, it conveys a new and distinctive experience.

My only complaint would be that the game was pretty short, it took me about 3 hours to complete. I don't mind it normally, I like short games, but in this case it felt like it ended abruptly, with some important stuff unanswered.

属于可玩性操作感不太好，但视觉很棒的类型

音效/场景都很棒，操作中规中矩吧，极其单调的点击，左右前后走，跳也不能跳，当第n此从传送点走上瞭望台和电话亭时我是崩溃的。场景细节和整体环境真的很棒，但有限的互动限制了整个感官，我也看了制作者的话说希望做一个不急躁慢慢探索的可以静心欣赏的游戏，但在只能够对有限的几个地方进行点击互动外什么都做不了的环境里摸索了一个多小时还是完全没有头绪，哪怕再平静也有点急了吧，毕竟这也没有那些步行模拟器那样的自由度可以真的随便玩，你不解锁一些东西这个游戏根本没有任何进一步反馈给你操作。

中文翻译好像叫月亮庇护所，但网上一搜就知道这个游戏别说汉化，玩的人也没几个。
英文的攻略也只有在steam里看到两篇，研究了好久还是一头雾水。最终还是卡在了house island和炮台岛最后，完全找不到攻略所说的puzzle是在哪搞出来的。但天文台的望远镜调整角度时看着头顶的光线，开启传送器之后在空中遥望岛屿，和在house island 楼梯那看着自己的飞行器，在暴风雨中穿过阴暗的回廊，三个岛屿的设计都很独特，但可惜我觉得还有很多可以细化。那位科学家留下的信件通篇的花体字对非母语者实在太不友好了，看得我脸都贴到屏幕那了。所以这个游戏最后玩得一知半解的，也不知道该怎么继续了。反正现在打折便宜大家可以试试，也许是因为我英语太差了呢？

It indeed has a very ""Myst"" like. My only major problem is too many puzzles are solved through trial and error or by finding a tiny hotspot. 

Breakdown:

Graphics: Running at the lowest setting and the graphics still looked great! 

Sound and Music: Excellent, sounds sounded realistic and music accurately convaide the atmosphere of each area. 

Atmosphere: This is what made the Myst games so great and ""Haven Moon"" is no exception. I love the 1800s version of the future the game presents.(some called it a ""Jules Verne"" version of things but I have not read his works, so I don't know how true that is) 

Story: There is not a great amount of story but it's not needed. 

Gameplay: You can play entirely with the mouse like RealMyst or Myst V in free mode. I encountered one bug and the issue with the puzzles which I stated at the top of this review. 

Overall: I don't know about most gamers but if you like Myst and Riven, I'm sure you will enjoy this game even with the not so great puzzles. It's definitely worth the full asking price of $5.00, though I got it on sale for ~$1.00.(yeah Steam sales! :)) 

NOTES:

Most of my time with the game are off-record as it's DRM-free. I have a common Linux Steam bug where Steam takes a long time to load, so I ran the game without Steam most of the time I played it.

Also note that one puzzles does require you to be able to hear well. Sorry to disappoint the people with poor or no hearing.",1511925711,1511972361,True,3,0,0.533577322959899902,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you really like Myst style games then you'll most likely enjoy it. It's really only about a 5hr game I just left my PC on after a night of margaritas and Stranger Things.

Positves
1) Beautiful
2) Thought Provoking Puzzles
3) Super Cheap

I have a couple of negatives. 

1) Some may find parts a bit obtuse. I personnally got hung up at one point and used a guide to figure out how to find a hidden key. That was the only truely obtuse bit I felt, but I may have not read one of the notes laying around thuroughly enough.

2) Graphical Issue: The FPS on Cannon Island was about 30-45 (compaired to 100fps locked in every other area) for me on a I7-4790k, 1080ti, 16gb build @ 1440p. It was managable but I can only assume it'll be a lot worse on a weaker setup. 

The story isn't bad or amazing. It's very light and didn't have me thinking too much about it. This is basically a bite size Myst game. There are 2 endings and saving is automated, but the game always boots you back to just before the endings to allow you to see them both with minimal effort.

Overall a great effort for an Indi dev and a steal at $0.99 when on sale. Hopefully they continue perfecting this style of game development.

With that said, I cannot recommend Haven Moon.  Yes, the graphics and rendering are excellent, and the music is atmospheric, if limited.   However, there is not much to hold this game together.  There is no culture or back story.  It's just a series of tasks to achieve a promised ending that I found to be anti-climatic.  I won't go into it because I don't want to issue any spoilers, but really, the end was an extreme letdown for me as was the alternate ending.  The games just stops in the same manner that it just starts.  It's more a segment of a larger game than a freestanding game of its own.    I found the islands to be far too similar with the exception of Cannon where the storm is raging, but even here, the interiors were very much the same.  Also, I guess I'm too much a fan of MYST, but I expect to be able to interact with objects in a setting where here, they're just decorations.  I also found that the controls were problematic, and although the movement didn't make me sick as it did others, I found it bizarre that using the arrow keys would not allow me to turn, only go sideways and backwards through a scene.  I love the puzzles of MYST and Obduction because you can ascertain what you have to do.  Here, there are things that have to be done that are totally cryptic and must be found by sheer luck as I did once or twice or by tedious repetition.

The soothing ocean waves...the breeze...the peaceful isolation.  It's all there.  From an aesthetic standpoint, Haven Moon delivers.  Everything looks pretty and all the gold thingies are nice and shiny.

Haven Moon places you in the role of an unnamed person who finds themselves transported to a mysterious moon.  Upon arriving is a letter from someone named Ektor Turren, who reveals that they are the last survivor of their civilization.  He tells you that he spent his lifetime stockpiling treasure and encourages you to find it.

And that's it.  That's the story.  It's probably the weakest element of the game, with very little actual notes to read.  I wish more had been done to flesh it out.  For example, you never do find out why Turren's civilization was destroyed, although there are some strong hints.  I would have liked to know about the planet Menra and its people.  But everything is done in such broad strokes that when the end of the game comes (there are two endings), it's hard to really care about the choice you make.

But the puzzles are the real star of a game like this, right?  Those on display in Haven Moon are fairly logical, based around gathering clues from the environment or trial and error fiddling with the machinery.  Although at one later section the game does commit the sin of pixel hunting (something Myst never did).  At the very least, it would have been nice to have some slight visual clue to tell you when you were looking in the right place instead of just having to scroll your mouse over every little thing hoping the cursor will turn green.

And that's another thing: interaction with objects in this game is kinda odd.  When you move your mouse over something, it turns green but then locks you in place so you can't move.  I imagine this was done to help people realize they found something to interact with, but it just feels awkward having control taken away from you.  You have to look away from the object before you can move again (EDIT: this is not the case anymore due to an update...you will no longer be locked in place while looking at an interactable object).  It's also weird that for certain things you can't go backwards.  For example, if you move a lever one space too far you can't just pull it back one.  You have to pull it all the way to the bottom then back up, which is just unnecessary.

The controls are another oddity, with the default being left mouse button to move forward and right mouse button to go backward.  Fortunately, you can change this in the launcher to something more suitable to your tastes (EDIT: an update changed the default control scheme to the more familiar WASD format).

Overall, Haven Moon is a decent game in the vein of Myst.  It has the potential to be better, but a weak story coupled with odd movement and interaction controls holds it back.  The game was made entirely by one person, so I can't fault it too much.  But as a lover of Myst myself, I can't help but want a little bit more out of this game.  At five dollars on sale, it was worth it for me.  So give it a shot if you have a craving for Myst-like games.",1498677256,1527791836,True,2,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really wanted to love this game, I truly did.  I'm always on the lookout for a good Myst-like game, unfortunately, Haven Moon falls well short of being a great game.  All of the elements are there but they're not utilized to their full potential.

Pros:
-Graphics are very well done
-Several puzzles to solve
-Like Myst, you must pay attention to detail
-The description says “point and click” but I would classify it as a 3D adventure
-The controls are as simple as it gets

Cons:
-The environment (islands) are much too small
-Not enough clues to solve some of the puzzles
-Needs more puzzles
-Some of the key holes are hidden (Oh joy, pixel hunting)
-The game is much MUCH to short

At the time of this review, Haven Moon was selling for $14.99... is it worth it?  Not by a long shot.  Even without the cons I just listed, it's not worth it because of how short this game is.  I would say $4.99 is closer to the mark, so if you really want to play this game, I'd wait for a sale.

I guess with the first 5 seconds of the game where I realized that contorlling the game won't be fun at all.

Haven Moon unfortunately commits many of the worst crimes of point-and-click puzzle games of this sort (Myst-like):  Pixel-hunting -- a cardinal sin in 3D games, mandatory incorrectly-hinted large search-space guesswork, ""precise"" maps that actually represent inaccurate geometry upon which puzzles depend, buggy and badly-hinted puzzles, nearly silent but crucial audio ""clues"", and visual hints that are nearly impossible to pick up on when one's display gamma is a bit too high.

I personally found the navigation to be nauseating when played on a computer (there's no vertical intertia), so I used my TV, which was absolutely fine for splendid 3D puzzlers like Obduction and Quern, but the increased distance and TV-style gamma/color made some of the puzzles' hints difficult to detect, especially when they must be ""hunted"" down.

Pixel-hunting was to some extent an acceptable game mechanic in the days of 2D, when screens were fairly static and one could reasonably spend a finite amount of time looking for the ""hidden object"", but it's a poor excuse for a ""puzzle"" when you have three full degrees of freedom and no static screens.  Myself, I far prefer being given an object that is completely visible and the problem is figuring out how it works, what its purpose is, and what it affects.

A good, if underwhelming Myst-like.  8/10

[h1]Ps & Cs[/h1]
+ Beautiful visuals
+ Interesting world
+ Subtle puzzles
+ Streams well
- Bizarre control scheme that seems to reset itself each play
- One puzzle specifically required sound which led to wandering for hours (I tend to play on mute/low volume)
- Clues can be too subtle or overly vague leading to a lot of back and forth
- Abrupt ending

A beautiful Myst-like that captures the spirit of its source.  From the screenshots I thought this was going to be a mouse only game and was delighted to find out it was in full 3D.  There was a weird issue where the system really wanted you to use click to walk and would automatically re-assign it each time the game restarted.  I was never blown away by anything that was shown/happened, but I was never disappointed.  I will definitely keep an eye on this developer and hope his next game doesn't take another 20 years.  8/10",1483395645,1483395645,True,2,0,0.498601436614990234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Your objective is to figure out how to activate teleporters on the island chain. The game is relatively short, shorter than Myst, and I would say something between 2-3 hours for an experienced adventure player or maybe 4-5 for someone new to the genre. Puzzles are environmental, not inventory based. There are a few puzzles which require finding hidden switches, but mostly the game is about using your brain and I feel all the puzzles are tough but fair.

If you're going to play the game, I recommend giving it a chance and really thinking through your options before looking up answers to puzzles. Try fiddling with switches, thinking about the next thing you want to, and writing down what you find. Pay attention to any information you get from letters. Play with sound turned on, because directional sound cues are important for several puzzles. If you think through everything, you'll get through the game.

The game is beautiful (it really nails that old timey Victorian brass, books, and spiral staircases feel; great architecture in general!) and the score is lovely to listen to. If there are drawbacks, I think they mostly stem from the game's scope. It was made by a single developer. Most of the areas in the game are shown in the screenshot carousel. There are limited configuration options. Controls are a little wonky. Movement is a little slow. And as I said it's a fairly short game for the $15 asking price ($10 in the current sale). But I think if you're wiling to forgive the rough edges, you will find a very solid contribution to the genre.

[i]P.S. You can map the movement to WASD in the Unity launcher. The default controls are mouse-only and the default keyboard bindings are arrows. You can also run by holding shift. [/i]

Dear developer, thank you very much for making this game. I really missed this kind of a games, where you are alone in peaceful place, and scenery in this game is breathtaking.
Also, I really wanted to fix my big mistake in childhood - completing Myst and Lighthouse with walkthroughts. And this game is a perfect opportunity for this :).

Anyway, here comes a bit of review in my review. As I mentioned, this game has a peaceful and calm atmosphere, and almost in all locations you can just stop and watch the scenery. I think I'm close to completing this game, and I didn't experience any slow-downs or bugs.
If I'm correct about nearly reaching the end of the game, then I have only two complaints. The first one is that this game is a bit short. But maybe I was just tranquiled by the game and didn't notice the time passing.
The second one is a mistake in Russian translation in one of the papers, when it tells you about beacons. It says ""fragments"" instead of ""flashes"".
I was lucky and managed to accidently solve one or two of puzzles that I could spend a lot of time solving. For example, [spoiler]The place where you find the key to the house.

[spoiler] Самые откровенные на мой взгляд в доме. Причём сразу две. Во первых на болт нет действия пока нет ключа - игра должна явно показать что ты действуешь правильно но не всё сделал.

Overall, I think Francois Roussel did an impressive job recreating the ambiance and spirit of the Myst games, particularly as a solo developer.

The Good:
[list]
[*]The visuals are downright excellent, considering the whole game was developed by one person. What an achievement!
[*]Both mouse and keyboard controls are easy and straightforward.
[*]The puzzles are challenging, but mostly fair.
[*]Captures the mood of Myst pretty well, being stuck in a strange place and having to figure out what has happened, how things work and what you're supposed to do.
[/list] 

The Bad:
[list]
[*]The story is kind of bland, and there are no other characters at all.
[*]There's not much variety, both in the environments and puzzles.
[*]Some hotspots only become interactive once you have the right item. If you discover something too early, the game makes you believe that you can't interact with it.
[*]There's some pixel hunting involved, though usually there are enough clues if you pay attention.
[/list] 

As mentioned, this game is inspired by Myst and Riven. So even though it may be unfair, I have to compare it with these games. And then it becomes obvious that Haven Moon lacks the imagination and variety of these games. Similar to Riven, it takes place on a couple of connected islands. But unlike Riven, these islands are pretty generic. History, culture, flora and fauna, all the things that made Riven and its puzzles so special, are missing. So in this regard, the islands feel more like Myst - more constructed than natural. But then Myst had a lot more variety in its worlds and puzzles. So while Haven Moon implements the Myst formula well enough, exploring the world is not as satisfying and rewarding.

Having said that, I still enjoyed Haven Moon. It's a nice and challenging first person puzzle game with great visuals, and if you like this kind of game, then it's well worth its price.",1471683693,1471683693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Haven Moon is a relaxing diversion into a visually pleasing world.  It's almost criminally short, however, and at times its puzzles can be a little obtuse and arbitrary.  I give it a thumbs-up because it matches the description in the store, kept me entertained for a time, and is quite an impressive game when you take into account that it was the product of a sole contributor.

[h1]The long of it:[/h1]
The environment and buildings have obvious nods to Myst and Jules Verne.  In particular, the influence of Myst is incredibly strong.  Gameplay elements such as powering things up before you can solve their puzzles, traveling between small, isolated environments using fanciful means, and deciding on an ending once you've collected everything all make appearances.  For those who enjoy a world that itself is a puzzle, rather than a world that happens to have puzzles in it, by and large this fits the bill.  The locations have matching music that subtly adds to the mood of each space, and I believe a lot of people would want their interior decorator to take inspiration from the places you visit while playing.

There are some minor technical hang-ups which can take away from the experience somewhat.   For instance, the Unity graphics engine isn't terribly efficient, causing some areas to lag in framerate despite simplistic environments regardless of how impressive your gaming hardware.  There are also numerous spelling errors in the written pages and even signage in the game, which may be due to translation issues, but when ""Canon"" and ""Cannon"" are used interchangeably more than once, there clearly needed to be some extra proofreading done.

Outside of more nit-picky things like the above, the story itself is very minimalstic and not particularly well laid-out.  You only gain understanding of what's going on in the larger world through the written pages you find, which unfortunately have signficiant plot holes which leave much to be desired in terms of working out what your role is as the player.  The game's moral lesson is simplistic, and and clearly designed for kids. This on its own isn't bad, and the fact that the game has no violence or visible death means it's a safe one for the kiddies to enjoy.  (Granted, there is reference to the island creator's world being destroyed, but we never find out how or why, nor is there any real gravity to this knowledge since it is literally only mentioned once in a single sentence.)

My only other gripe is with some of the puzzles.  Some are incredibly easy to the point of being almost a joke, while others are frustratingly difficult because of arbitrary and inconsistent ""rules"" of the universe which the game's creator has written but decided not to tell us about.  The most frustrating of these is at the very end of the game, where a previously consistent coordinate system was suddenly in total violation of all laws of geometry.  In addition, the maps of where the islands are located are disappointly meaningless, since their relative positions have no bearing on where they're pictured cartographically.  

This is a fun one for younger audiences and can keep an adult busy for a few hours.  It's not mind-blowing, nor is it perfect, but if you're in the mood for something casual, relaxing, and ultimately not very challenging that can distract you for a short while, Haven Moon is precisely that.",1469995935,1529173409,True,3,0,0.551729083061218262,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The soundtrack and sounds are high quality and the puzzles were fun to figure out.  If you are new to adventure/puzzle games, I would recommend that you pay attention to every detail while looking around each island.  Do not cheat yourself by looking up an answer in a walkthrough video, use your thinking cap and bring your magnifying glass (metaphorically speaking) and observe and think your way through each puzzle or area.  It is very rewarding to figure out the puzzles without help.  Also note that the game has a good and a bad ending so make sure you try both, it will let you try both endings without having to restart the game from scratch.

I've played and enjoyed Myst-like games for decades. I only recently heard about Haven Moon so I had no expectations going in except that it was supposed to be a Myst-like game. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a nicely designed and cohesive game taking me right at 16 hours to complete. Is it perfect? No. I'd definitely recommend some improvements if I were beta testing it, but I feel it's a good game overall.

I almost always need a walkthrough for at least one puzzle in adventure games. This is the first adventure game in years that I was able to complete without any help from a walkthrough. The puzzles do require some patience, but patience is essential for Myst-like games just like fast reflexes are necessary for FPS games.

I did have to take two breaks from the game when I got stuck on puzzles. One puzzle solution came to me as soon as I returned to the game after an overnight break. I had simply made an incorrect assumption instead of just following the evidence presented to me. The other solution occurred to me while I was doing something else away from my computer. I suddenly remembered something I had read in one of the game documents. I immediately returned to the game and solved the puzzle.

Good things:

[*]The world created looks great and I loved all the working mechanical parts. Attention to detail is amazing.
[*]Puzzles aren't arbitrary. They actually make sense and are solvable without too much brain strain. Some just require patience and/or observation before the proverbial light bulb turns on.

That much is pretty obvious. I give credit where credit is due because it's an obvious homage to Myst, which is exactly what we were all expecting, right? The puzzles are right in the middle somewhere between too obvious and too subtle- most falling right in between and a few on each end of the spectrum. (Infact, if I didn't see on the forums how to power on the teleporters, I may have just quit playing the game altogether.)  For this reason, the challenge alone is why I recommend that you play it. 


BELOW ARE QUASI-SPOILERS! 

Here is my critique, however. This game reminds me of something akin to DLC for Myst. He created 4 more islands worth of puzzles that would have fit perfectly in with the island of Myst. I feel as if it wasn't until the end of his supposed ""20 years in the making"" that he realized he needed to create his own story. 

I am a huge Riven fan, and part of that reason is that even if you couldn't solve a puzzle, even if you couldn't figure much of anything out, you still wanted to play and explore the game because it had -character.-  Riven was a living, breathing world. It had ancient symbolism, inhabitents both human and nonhuman, it's locations looked lived in. It was organic.

This game, for all it's success on the puzzle side, lacks any sort of personality. The clues and story all come from the same source- perfectly penned papers that are neatly displayed on a desk in each of the locations. It's bland, and if I have to be harsh to be honest- it's boring. Why lay the clues out so obviously on each desk? Why not hide the combination to the first door in the margin of a notebook, as you're reading the diary and sketches of this particular lone genius, who has a storyline perfectly tailored to make him a bit of an odd duck. With personality. Anything. Give the game some sort of memorable flavor. 

Now I understand that videogame creation is more work than I could ever imagine, but I feel like the content creation between a few pages of sketches and notes with the clues hidden within is about the same amount of man-hours as a perfectly placed piece of paper on the desk just spelling out the answers. If you're just going to leave the answer to the combination out on the desk, why even bother hinting at it? Why not just write the combination? WHY EVEN LOCK THE DOOR?! 

Ontop of the bad clue mechanics, the storyline itself is full of dissapointing holes and out-of-nowhere conclusions. For one, the scientist himself is a mystery- and not in the ""oh he's so mysteriously awesome"" kind of way. He completely lacks context. How did he get to the moon? Why was he the first? How did he build all of these buildings? Did he have a team? A lover? How did myself, The Player, come to be on this moon? The first note suggests that his teleporter scans the universe and brought me here, but you later find out that the teleporters only work if there are two identical pairs, right? So how did I get here? Where did the Scientist go? To a pulsating light and loud sound on the moon somewhere? Why not SHOW us that same anomoly at a certain point of the island and just not write about it? 

Also, and this is my last critique, the double ending. You can leave the moon in the Lab, or leave the moon with the gold. But... leaving the moon with the gold gets you a one way ticket to a lonely death?  

Where on Menra did this theme of ""right vs. wrong"" even come from? Was I supposed to be under the impression the whole game that my morality was being tested? Why did the multiple endings have such polarized consequences when there was absolutely no indication that my sense of worth was being questioned. 

So I use the teleporter in the room with gold, and you sentence me to a life of solitary confinement on an empty planet where I will slowly die from thirst and starvation?  Because I teleported from the room with the treasure YOU OFFERED ME?!  Look buddy- you teleported ME here... mostly likely against my will, and OFFERED me your treasure! Then you expect me to ""make the right choice""??   Nah. It feels empty to me. 

All of these questions and out-of-leftfield morality could have easily been addressed by giving more flavor to the notes. Make the pages of notes not laid out neatly. Make the player delve into the mind of this mad-scientist Tesla figure. Make the player AWARE that this scientist has a duality driven, unapologetic evil streak. Then I might actually be aware that there are consequences for taking his gold? Idk. 


Overall, it's worth the $14 for the puzzles alone. The graphics are wonderful, the music is serene, the sound effects are visceral.

- Замечательная и разнообразная музыка;

Минусы:

- Сохранение в один сейв. Это самый большой минус; 
- Игра постоянно подвисала;

Myst and Riven are two of my favorite games so I was excited to explore another fantastic world.  François Roussel has done a great job creating a world that captures some of the look and feel that made Myst so appealing.  The visuals feel like something right out of a Jules Verne novel and look quite stunning.

Like Myst, gameplay revolves around solving a series of puzzles and piecing together a narrative.  This is where I felt the game a bit lacking.  I really enjoy puzzles that I can think through and use observation to figure out.  The best ones (in my opinion) are seamlessly integrated into the story or environment.  While some of the puzzles in Haven Moon are wonderful, there are a few that are rather inelegant.  One puzzle in particular required me to enter a code.  I tried a few combinations before figuring I needed more information and continued to explore.  After a while quite a while with no progress, I broke down and consulted a walkthrough.  From the guide, I learned that the only way to progress would be to bypass the code through the brute force method.  For me, I enjoy puzzles that are difficult because they require acute observation, non-lateral thinking, problem solving, and resourcefulness, and not simply due the number of tumblers within the lock.  Another critique of the gameplay was how linear it seemed. 

While it has its faults, Haven Moon also gets quite a few things spot on.  One is its graphics.  The environment is stunning.  Everything has so much attention to detail, and are wonderfully animated.  I can’t tell you how many times I entered random coordinates into the telescope just to watch the dome turn.  (Seriously, the shadows, the reflections, the viewer, it’s that good.)  That said, I noticed a few areas where perforance was a little choppy.  I have a decent system, and since the islands are so small, my guess is a few objects have a bit too many polygons for their own good.  Its not horrible, but may impact players with lower end systems.  The sounds and music are also well executed.  The sounds are natural and the music, when present, definitely sets the mood for each location.  The story was interesting if short.  It left a lot of unanswered questions, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Who knows, maybe someday there will be a sequel (or prequel).  While not perfect, Haven Moon is certainly a fun game.

I feel like it is a stunningly beautiful person (in my case a woman) who lacks any personality worth mentioning. Great to look at but will not keep your attention beyond a few hours. It is very Mystesque but lacks Myst’s depth, story immersion, and length. Actual casual, non-rushed, and lazy play time is 5 hours (possibly less for others). My time played says 14 hours, however I spent more than half of my time on projects in the house or watching Netflix, but did not exit the game, I just left it on the ESC menu. While the story concept is fairly good, but it lacks any real depth. The story part of this game is in written notes, and there are not very many to read.  As with all Adventure/Puzzle games replay ability is minimal at best so such a short playtime is very disappointing. When I read the Dev’s comment “It is neither too long nor too short”, I thought to myself “well then I should be able to get at least a good couple of days out of it. Not just a few hours. To sum up, the game itself is good but I cannot recommend at its current price due to lack of content. I would rather pay more for something more developed and not just a beautiful painting.

While it's fun to find these places, it becomes a little difficult when traveling back and forth requires a loading screen each time. Overall this isn't too big an issue. 

The storyline is interesting if not a little short. More closure at the end would definitely be nice or some more notes delivering some more aspects of the story.

Bei diesem Spiel handelt es sich um ein Ein-Mann-Projekt. Der Autor gibt an, sich bei der Erschaffung dieses Spiels an der Myst-Reihe orientiert zu haben. Dies ist ihm zum Teil auch sehr gut gelungen, aber das Vorbild wird dann doch nicht erreicht.
Die Grafik ist sehr schön. Ebenso die Animationen. Zusammen mit der unaufdringlichen Hintergrundmusik kommt hier eine intensive Stimmung auf, welche den Spieler in das Spiel hineinzieht. Leider hat das Spiel einige nicht unerhebliche Nachteile:
1. Es ist sehr kurz. Ich habe es an einem Abend durchgespielt.
2. Die Rätsel sind sehr leicht. So leicht, dass man hier kaum von Rätseln sprechen kann.
3. Das Rätsel auf der Hausinsel hat mich zur Verzweiflung getrieben. Nicht wegen des nicht vorhandenen Schwierigkeitsgrades, sondern weil es gilt, ein Schlüsselloch zu finden, welches extrem gut versteckt ist.
4. Das Schalterrätsel auf der Kanoneninsel war sehr nervig. Zu einem Schalter laufen, diesen verstellen, zur Anzeige laufen und die Auswirkungen anschauen, zurück zum nächsten Schalter, diesen verstellen, zur Anzeige laufen...usw. Das Ganze unzählige male.
5. Eine nennenswerte Geschichte ist nicht vorhanden.
6. Keine Video- oder Sprachdateien. Nur Text. Dieser aber in deutsch. Allerdings entsteht der Eindruck, dass deutsch nicht die Muttersprache der Texterstellerin ist. Das Deutsch ist gut aber stellenweise mit deutlichen grammatikalischen Fehlern durchsetzt.

Das Spiel hat zwei möglich Enden. Hat man das eine Ende erspielt, wird man zurück zum zentralen Teleporter versetzt und kann von hier aus gleich das andere Ende erspielen. Sehr nett!
Insgesamt kann ich das Spiel, trotz der oben aufgezählten Nachteile, jedem, der die Myst-Reihe oder vergleichbare Spiele mag, absolut empfehlen.

This is doubtless the most impressive One-Man-Project I have seen for a very long time. If you are a fan of the ""Myst"" you will like Haven Moon very much. Another point which should be not taken for granted is the graphic design&quality, which is on quite a high niveau, especially if you consider that it is a single mans work. Even if you are unimpressed by the graphics and the well tought-out leveldesign, the OST/Sound is something that immediatley draws attention. Not only the musical pieces, but also the ambient sounds are easily able to compete with more popular games. Last but not least: The Gameplay itself. The puzzles are enjoyable and doable, the overall course of action is also quite elaborated. I do not want to spoil the story to much so I'll just leave it at that.

I cannot recommend this game -- at least not at full price.

[B]The Good[/B]
[list]
[*] Looks like MYST
[*] Sounds like MYST
[*] Feels like MYST
[*] Some puzzles are elegant and enjoyable
[*] There are hints of an interesting story
[/list]

[B]The Bad[/B]
[list]
[*] Does [i]not[/i] play like MYST
[*] Some puzzles are profoundly inelegant
[*] Without the walkthrough on the forums, I would never have finished
[*] Numerous objects with which the player interacts have no clear connection to the goal (switches with no on/off indicator, levers pointing to unclear targets)
[*] The written notes are choppy and unsatisfying (the choppiness may be a translation problem, but the extreme brevity and shallow story are not)
[*] The locations in MYST have cupboards and drawers and books, all of which can be explored. This game has cupboards and drawers and books too -- but [i]none[/i] of them can be explored
[*] Travel seems like it will be speedy, once certain steps are taken. This never happens -- going from one place to another is tedious until the very end
[*] The intentions behind several objectives are unclear; as a result, the ending is very unsatisfying
[/list]

I don't wish to be overly negative, because I have tremendous respect for the developer -- again, his love for MYST is clear. He's done a fine job with the visuals and the audio, but the deeper problems of puzzle creation and world interaction leave me annoyed and unhappy.

As it promises, it's very relaxing and serene while also being challenging but not to the point of being frustrating. The game is very visually pleasing and heavily stylized, something I'm sure any Myst fan will appreciate.
If I have to pick a few critisizms it would be the controls, which are really bizzare at first but in the game's defence I did get used to it after a while and if you really don't like it you can just change it through Unity.
The other thing would be the length of the game, I finished it in just under 3 hours and got stumped many times along that journey. However this really isn't uch of a critisizm since the game doesn't have much of a price tag and was made by one guy.
Speaking of which, the effort and attention to detail and the labor of love that went into making this game very clearly shines through.

Итог. Плюсы игры:
- графика в стиле Мист/Ривен.
- полное 3D, а не ""экраны-сферы"" как в Мисте.

Минусы:
- Сюжет никакой.
- Дурацкое управление.
- Головомки частью понятны, а частью нет. Прочитал [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/493720/discussions/0/358417008723518730/] прохождение [/url], но так и не понял, откуда там беруются координаты телепортов.

Ставлю минус исключительно из-за глюка и невозможности отката.

Обновлено. Начал заново и прошел таки. Выбрал хорошую концовку. Если сказать, что она ни о чем, это ничего не сказать. Бред полный.

Я выше писал, что сюжет никакой - так это не так. Сюжета тут попросту нет. Попадаем на планету и некто неизвестный приглашает нас побродить по округе и использовать построенные им механизмы. Зачем? Кто он и почему его планета погибла? Ответа нет.

[spoiler]Разве что получаем комнату с десятью книжными шкафами и сообщением, что в них собрана вся мудрость погибшего мира.[/spoiler] Это как-то даже не смешно. Ради того, чтобы получить плохую концовку, тратить час жизни не хочется.

Like many other gamers I've never forgotten the experience of playing Myst for the first time. It was one of the first games to come out on CD-rom and like The 7th Guest was used to promote the sale of CD-rom drives. The combination of a beautiful and carefully designed 3D world with interesting lore and difficult puzzles was unlike anything I had played before. It has inspired many games that came out afterwards and will probably continue to inspire developers for many years to come. 

The influence of the Myst games is unmistakable but this game doesn't recycle any of the plot or puzzles from these games. The designer has created his own little world (well, moon actually) with it's own lore and original set of puzzles. The game focusses on the manipulation of devices rather than on cryptology or advanced math puzzles that you'll find in the Myst games. In order to solve Riven I needed several pages of notes for all the different puzzles. For this game I only needed one sheet of A5. Since it was developed by just one programmer it shouldn't come as a surprise that the scope of the game is much smaller than that of any of the Myst games. But luckely that which is there is of high quality and the puzzles might be a lot easier, they're no cake walk either. 

The world has a distinct steampunk look with lots of brass, wood, marble and iron. A lot of care and attention has been given in the overall design of the different islands you visit and everything looks and behaves very realistic. This is only let down by a relatively low level of antialising (probably a limitation of the engine used) so you'll notice jagged edges and interference patterns while playing. 

The interface is clean and simple. While you can use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move around, there is no need since you can play the entire game using only the mouse. Left clicking will move you forward and right clicking will cause you to step backwards. This is very similar to interface of RealMyst. There are a couple of items that you'll pick up and they are displayed as small traslucent white icons at the bottom of the screen. The cursor changes from white to green when you can interact with an object and you can turn handles and valves by either left or right clicking. Useable objects are automatically taken from your inventory when you click the correct object. Puzzles are locked when you've solved them, which is helpfull since you won't loose time trying to manipulate things that no longer need manipulating. 

The story is told primarily through a number of notes left by the man who built all the buildings and machines. Unlike Myst and Riven there are no audio or video clips. Very much like Myst you'll have to make a moral decission at the end of the game which will lead to the good or the bad ending. I wish that some of the books in the library you find where readable so you'd be able to get to know this world and the man who created the machinery better. But I can see how that would be too much to ask from a one man development team. I can only hope that a possible second game will delve deeper into the lore of this world. There is enough background story given so you'll understand how these islands came to be and where the inventor went but it leaves me wanting to know more.

The sound design is also very good, featuring ambient noises when you're outside and subtle music when you enter certain buildings or visit certain places. One of the puzzles relies on the use of sounds and some of the machines use sound to let you know when something is or isn't working.

Once you've completed the game there is not much reason to hang around or replay it. While the islands look nice, they're small and there isn't much to see or do once you're done with figuring out how everything works. The notes hint about the existence of a nautical vessel (a boat or sub) and you'll find a harbour on each of the islands. But you won't find this vessel, since the inventor used it to visit an unkown location that you won't be able to reach. 

I haven't been able to find out if the developer is planning on creating a sequel, but I honestly hope he does. With a bigger budget and maybe some more programmers and designers by his side a sequel (or prequel) could be much bigger and contain more puzzles and background lore. There is no reason why there shouldn't be many more islands or even a big land mass on this moon. And since the inventor was able to transport you from earth to this Haven Moon, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to visit other moons or planets. 

Despite the short playing time I have to say that I'm really impressed by this game. I enjoyed solving the puzzles and discovering the different islands. I think that the current price of €15,- is fair for what's offered and I'm glad I could help support the developer by buying it. If you find this too expensive for a 4 to 5 hour game than you should definitely get it whenever it is on sale.",1468023350,1468070072,True,19,1,0.583590269088745117,0,False,False,False,False,,,
