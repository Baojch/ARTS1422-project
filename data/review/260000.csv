like the idea. great voice over but with out much funny material. the timers combined with A high level of voice over skill that lack joke content soon becomes abrasive and annoying! the way the questions are written combined with the all out emphasis narration mean that its not so much the question your figuring out but what the hell he trying to say in the 1st place. so if i dont want to hear the 'right' answer where is the skip button? also the films didnt seem that relevant to me, for eg you know what my good friend jack burton always says about the eye of the storm?? open yr eyes and watch some GOOD movies, gone with the wind SUCKS and i am happy not  to know shit about it or its boring friends.SKIP BUTTON!. Over all i found my answers to be, dont care or shut the hell up already!
pretty glad i dont know about alot of these film tbh.

couldve been good if they..
watched some better movies.
wrote some gags and stuff
it wasnt a bitchy nag (like 25% less)
S-K-I-P   B-U-T-T-O-N!!
And why the hell put A timer on category selection? (this ended the fun for me!) 

it would be good to see these more inventive selections, it seems that they are mostly what the jibberish vs fact premise derives from, why limit the introduction to the subject matter, let us take it on before you slag us out the door with a gob barrage of pebble dash shrapnel! iam not having problems jumping out of a plane here, IAM JUST SELECTING!",1696120643,1696760643,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[b]you don't know jack[/b] is the best trivia game series of all time. this one is from 1997, so it's pretty outdated by now and [b]it's always been us-centric[/b] (though with movies both are less of an issue than in other entries), so you'll either find it very challenging or very frustrating if you're from somewhere else. or a piece of cake because you know all the answers.

it's your typical multiple choice deal, but there are [b]a ton of other question types over the series[/b], like dis or dat (or sometimes both) or gibberish question. you can play a game of [b]7 or 21 questions[/b], some question types only appear in the full run, but they both end with the [b]jack attack[/b]. there's a clue and you have to match things accordingly.

[b]local multiplayer is available for up to 3 players[/b], you can even screw each other by buzzing in and forcing another player to answer. save for a few occasions way back when, I've always played it alone and always had a blast.

it's all [b]presented as a tv show[/b] (there was an actual short-lived tv show as well, should be on youtube), there's some behind-the-scenes chatter at the beginning, fake commercials at the end (don't you dare skip them!), fake money to win and all that, and [b]the writing is fantastic[/b]. if it was a simple text-based thing, it'd still be excellent stuff, so much creativity, but [b]the voiceovers take it to a whole new level[/b]. lots of characters, one-off or recurring, great hosts, also one-off or recurring, and again, the whole thing is just great.

[b]the attention to detail and variety elevates it even further.[/b] sure, if you play long enough, you'll see repeated questions (though I don't think the game will show them again until you've seen most of them), but there are a lot of different ways to introduce questions, a lot of remarks if you chose the wrong answer or hesitate to enter your name (in which case the host will give you one) or pick a category or answer, a relevant joke for most choices, right or wrong, and of course the commercials, man... the game also starts differently based on the time and date, so on certain holidays, early in the morning, late at night, on friday evening, and so on. and for answers that need typing, you can try some profanities, see what good they do.

[b]there was nothing done to modernize the game[/b] for the steam release, so it runs in 640x480 (a very tiny window with a black background, you can set the .exe to run in that resolution or something closer and fill the screen more with the actual game), there's no steam overlay, there's only a single volume setting (it's fine in this case, though lowering it completely didn't let me raise it again until a restart) and controls aren't rebindable. each player gets a buzz hotkey scattered on the keyboard, the screw is the same for everybody, and if you play alone, no need to buzz and space works just fine for that too.

I literally don't know jack and I've been having fun with the series since it first came out, most of it played alone. if you don't mind questions about older stuff (or that's your specialty) and can handle a lower resolution, definitely pick these up.",1673781760,1673781760,True,11,0,0.583069264888763428,1,True,False,False,True,,,

Die Spielreihe kam urspr√ºnglich f√ºr die Playstation 1 raus und wurde nun, Jahre sp√§ter, auf Steam ver√∂ffentlicht. Der Daumen geht nach oben, aber bitte das ganze Review lesen, welches stellvertretend f√ºr die gesamte Spielereihe steht!

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Die gesamte ‚ÄúYOU DON`T KNOW JACK‚Äù ‚Äì Reihe ist ein Quizspiel, die sich durch abstrakte Fragen und viel Humor auszeichnet. Man kann ausw√§hlen, ob man alleine oder im Partymodus spielen will und bekommt anschlie√üend 7 oder 21 Fragen gestellt, wobei man aus einer von drei fragw√ºrdigen Kategorien ausw√§hlen darf. Wer den ‚ÄûBuzzer‚Äú dr√ºckt, darf antworten: Ist es Richtig, gibt es die Summe aufs Konto, ansonsten wird sie abgezogen.  Gelegentlich gibt es dann noch Zusatzspiele, wo man Begriffe assoziieren muss und √Ñhnliches. 

[b]Story[/b]
Klar, das Spiel ist eine Quizshow und hat damit keine Geschichte. Allerdings sind die vertonten Stimmen einfach der Hammer und rei√üen st√§ndig sehr geile Witze. Am Ende gibt es auch verst√∂rende und lustige Werbeclips zum Anh√∂ren. Auch die Kategorien sind ziemlich durchgeknallt und die Fragen werden manchmal so merkw√ºrdig und verzweigt gestellt, dass man erstmal √ºberhaupt die Frage herausarbeiten muss. Zudem beinhaltet das Spiel oft Fremdw√∂rter oder √§ltere politische Themen. Hier liegt aber das gro√üe Problem: Das Spiel ist nur auf Englisch verf√ºgbar! Normalerweise keine gro√üe Sache, jedoch werden wie bereits erw√§hnt, viele Fremdw√∂rter benutzt, die man sich auch schon schwer ins Deutsche √ºbersetzen kann und dann noch selten wei√ü, was eigentlich gemeint ist. Zudem zielen geschichtliche, gesellschaftliche und politische Fragen auf die USA ab und nicht wie in meiner Playstationfassung, auf die Deutsche.

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Die Aufl√∂sung ist leider nicht einfach so skalierbar, wodurch das Spiel nur in einem kleinen Fenster ge√∂ffnet wird. Ansonsten ist das Spiel grafisch nicht aufwendig, da es zum Einen sehr alt und zum Anderen eben ein Quizspiel ist.
Die Musik klingt sehr flockig nach einer typischen Quizshow und die Vertonung ist in der englischen Version und damals auch in der Deutschen einfach super gewesen.

[b]Fazit[/b]
‚ÄûYOU DON`T KNOW JACK‚Äú ist ein super Spiel, was mich fr√ºher auf der Playstation st√§ndig zum Lachen gebracht hat. Leider wurde die Steamversion nur auf Englisch ver√∂ffentlicht und ich habe wirklich fast alles versucht. Ich habe die deutsche Vertonung im Internet gesucht und habe die Entwickler angeschrieben, jedoch ohne Erfolg. Den ersten Teil kann man allerdings nachgebaut im Browser spielen, den Link werde ich aber hier logischerweise nicht ver√∂ffentlichen.  Auf jeden Fall Danke an diesem Typen, dass er ein super Spiel nachgebaut hat. Wer wirklich gut im Englischen ist, kann sich die Spielreihe gerne anschaffen, ansonsten w√ºrde ich stark davon abraten.

I have always liked the ""You don't know Jack"" games - having played them since their first incarnation many window platforms ago.  They can lose their magic a little because they follow the same formula, but it's bit like having different trivial pursuit games, enough different topics and a bit of fun to play with someone else, or by yourself.  

As I am from Australia the only downside is that there is a lot of content that is not relevant or is specific to US (eg: some comedy and tv shows that may not be shown here), although if you have a good general kinowledge of movies then this is only a very minor criticism.  I would like to see some Oz movies included of course.  Note that I have played this game a lot more than the 2 hours it says on my steam account.

Recommended for those who have a good knowledge of movies, enjoy other ""Jack"" games and get on sale.

Our Man Flint
Reality Bites
Song of the South
She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Myra Breckenridge
all of the seven dwarf's names
most titles of Jerry Lewis' filmography

Nur wie spielt sich YDKJ ohne deutsche Synchro? Normalerweise ist das tats√§chlich ein Problem, denn es geht nicht nur um das blo√üe Verst√§ndnis, sondern auch um das Hintergrundwissen. Die Spiele beziehen sich gerne auf amerikanische Eigenarten, wer sich also nicht mit Footballteams, TV Sternchen und typischen Speisen auskennt, wird bestimmte Fragen trotz besten Sprachkenntnissen nicht beantworten k√∂nnen. Hier punktet das Filmquiz, denn Hollywoodfilme sind ein internationales Thema. In meinen bisherigen Runden gab es keine Frage, die mich frustriert denken lie√ü: ""Das kann man aber nur als Amerikaner wissen!"". Man kann dieses Spiel also guten Gewissens auch deutschen Spielern empfehlen, die sich Sorgen machen, ob die Fragen zu schwer sind.

Allerdings gibt es auch einen kleinen Nachteil: Da es sich tats√§chlich um reine Filmfragen handelt, f√ºhlt sich das Spiel weniger chaotisch an als die YDKJ Titel mit gemischten Inhalten.
