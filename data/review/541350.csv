This game is nowhere near as good as those. 

It does work, it's not an asset flip, it is genuinely made, so those are some plusses here.  There's even 4K support.  The voice acting is pretty good, but I feel bad for the actors, because the story and dialogue is not. 

The first thing that put me off here was the generally poor graphics.  It's hard to tell if they were going for a retro pixel aesthetic, a pre-rendered low poly aesthetic, or trying to make the game look realistic without any ability to do so.  None of those is an acceptable excuse for the poor visuals. 

Gameplay itself is pretty plodding and clunky.  It doesn't take what feels like half an hour to get from one side of the screen to another in Monkey Island.  It does in this.

Despite not being in Steam Early Access (where this arguably belongs), the game is missing features and is apparently incomplete, with mention of additional chapters that never saw the light of day.  Due to the lack of meaningful progress from the developer, it's unlikely the game will be completed at all, yet the developers reprehensively have their hand out for money for an incomplete game.  This is a good reason for gamers to avoid this.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 7 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""Calm Waters: A Point and Click Adventure"" has the laughable price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.",1694601469,1694601469,False,4,1,0.251879185438156128,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I have been playing point and click adventures since the amiga days and I can honestly say this is one of the worst. The voice acting is nothing short of awful, if you are going to develop a game you need use more than 2 or 3 voices and not use them with terribly false accents. 
Graphically poor but as a pnc lover I would still play it if that was the only issue, the voice acting and poor story really do make this one of the worst of this genre.
Avoid, there are plenty of good pnc games on Steam, this is not one of them. If I had to put a price on the worth of this one, it would be around the 5 pence mark, no more.

and that includes waiting forever for the character to move from one side of the screen to the other because  running / double click to the next screen were not programmed in.

If this game were a graduation project for whatever course, than I would gladly grade it with an A.  For a commercial product which is being sold for ~11$, I feel that it's too underdeveloped in the sense that it feels more like the cliff notes version or the Demo version of a game rather than the game itself.

The story is nice, but definitely has the potential to be deepened, widened and extended.  


The game world is as simple as they come, in my opinion oversimplified. Almost no redundant items to interact with, feedback on using items in a false manner is limited to few non item specific comebacks.  It's all pretty linear and straight forward: go from A to B, from B to C and pick up D from E if you want to get to F.  


All in all, it's worth the play, but I just can't recommend it for the price in which it's currently being sold.

Cool premise, does a great job of building suspense, and overall worth the cost and time to play.  I would recommend it, so kindly forgive that the following list of criticism exceeds my compliments.

It lacks DEPTH.  The few characters involved are very undeveloped, the dialogue options also seem irrelevant.  The story's resolution is disappointing and shallow, and more than once, reaching dead-ends requires pixel-hunting or, more annoyingly, the repitition of a repeated, previously unsucessful action several times, without indication of a changed response, before you can progress with the game.  

Overall, the technical aspects of the game deliver all that is expected, but without a very specific walkthrough you may get annoyed at the tedium of the very specific actions required to progress, often with an arbitrary time limit.

The good:

- Gameplay is solid (no lag or anything)
- Story keeps you interested
- Sometimes you are stuck, which I like, personally I don't like
point and click games that are too easy.
- Generally good voice acting

The less good (but not really that important in the end but still):

- There is too much grain (or film grain) 
- Voices are too loud sometimes (especially the one from the inspector)
- The length of this game is a bit shorter than I expected,
I guess you can speed walkthrough it in under 30 minutes or even less (of course
only if you already know how to walk through the game)

All in all these are only minor points in my opinion. The fact that this game 
was created by one person (except for the voice acting of course, or am I wrong?) is incredible
and I admire it highly. I know about how much work went into it (I am myself an AC user).
