🤖1 (Thomas): (adjusting helmet) Alright, Daft Punk here, and today, we're diving into Beatbuddy: Tales of the Guardians!

🤖2 (Guy-Manuel): (nodding) That's right, Thomas. A game that claims to fuse action-adventure with beats. Let's see if it's as funky as they say.

[DAFT PUNK STARTS THE GAME]

🤖1: (excitedly) Woah, check out those hand-painted visuals! It's like we're in a disco ball's dream.

🤖1: (laughing) Clef, you sly note! These jokes are cracking me up.

🤖2: (groovy voice) Comedy level: disco ball.

[LEVEL TRANSITION]

🤖1: (amazed) Each level is a hand-painted masterpiece. It's like we're wandering through a futuristic art gallery.

[GAME INTENSIFIES]

🤖1: (getting into it) Dodging obstacles, solving puzzles – Beatbuddy's a rhythm master.

🤖2: (slamming buttons) I feel like I'm in a Daft Punk concert, but with more puzzles.

[b] **Title: Winds of Groovy Destruction Review: Beatbuddy vs. The Guardians**

[INT. MEMES OF LIBERTY - NIGHT]

🗡️ Raiden: (cracking knuckles) Alright, time to review a game. Beatbuddy: Tales of the Guardians, here we go.

💪 Senator Armstrong: (flexing muscles) Let's make this review as strong as my nanomachines.

[THE WINDS OF DESTRUCTION ENTER]

🌪️ Mistral: (playfully twirling her winds) Hey there, boys. Ready for a breezy review?

🔥 Monsoon: (surrounded by flames) The heat is on. Let's spice it up.

⚡ Sundowner: (cracking electrified knuckles) Shocking revelations, I hope.

🌊 Bladewolf: (barking in binary) Woof, let's byte into this game.

🗡️ Jetstream Sam: (elegantly unsheathing sword) Apologies for the entrance, gentlemen. I'm here for the slicing critique.

[BEATBUDDY GAMEPLAY STARTS]

🗡️ Raiden: (watching the hand-painted levels) These visuals are sharper than my HF Blade. It's like I'm in the VR mission of a high-tech ninja.

💪 Senator Armstrong: (stroking his beard) It's like an art exhibition in cyberspace. Reminds me of the good ol' days of war.

[BEATBUDDY APPEARS]

🔥 Monsoon: (smirking) Beatbuddy's got moves, huh? Let's see if he can dance with the winds. Maybe he'll join the Winds of Destruction fan club.

⚔️ Jetstream Sam: (nodding) A rhythm game, you say? Interesting. I shall evaluate its blade-worthiness.

[EXCLUSIVE SOUNDTRACK PLAYS]

⚡ Sundowner: (headbanging) Now that's what I call an INVINCIBLE soundtrack! *Nanomachines, son!* I mean, *Metal Beat*.

🌪️ Mistral: (creating a wind symphony) Austin Wintory and crew did a bang-up job with these beats. It's almost as beautiful as the sound of slicing through cyborgs.

[CLEF'S JOKES APPEAR]

🌊 Bladewolf: (processing humor.exe) Clef's jokes are making my circuits laugh. It's like the Codec calls, but with more rhythm.

🗡️ Raiden: (nudging Senator Armstrong) Even more entertaining than a political debate. Maybe we should recruit Clef for Desperado Enforcement.

[LEVEL TRANSITION]

💪 Senator Armstrong: (adjusting sunglasses) These hand-painted levels are a visual feast. It's like the VR missions on a psychedelic drug.

🔥 Monsoon: (emitting flames) The colors are hotter than my fiery temperament. It's like I'm back on the African battlefield.

[GAME INTENSIFIES]

⚡ Sundowner: (unleashing electric attacks) Dodging obstacles and solving puzzles. Beatbuddy's got some skills. Reminds me of dodging Blade Wolf's bites.

🌪️ Mistral: (twirling with enthusiasm) This game's got the rhythm of a thousand winds. Just like my L'Etranger's dance.

🗡️ Jetstream Sam: (elegantly slicing through enemies) The gameplay has finesse, much like my katana techniques. I shall cut through this review with grace.

[FINAL BOSS APPEARS]

🔥 Monsoon: (raising fiery eyebrows) Prince Maestro, huh? Time to bring the heat. I hope he's as tough as Jetstream Sam.

⚔️ Jetstream Sam: (readying sword) I shall handle this, gentlemen. Stand back.

[BEATBUDDY DEFEATS PRINCE MAESTRO]

🌊 Bladewolf: (barking in binary) Victory confirmed. Good job, Beatbuddy. Reminds me of when I took down Jetstream Sam.

[ENDING SCREEN]

💪 Senator Armstrong: (leaning back) Final thoughts, everyone?

⚡ Sundowner: (smirking) Beatbuddy: Tales of the Guardians – it's electrifying, visually stunning, and a musical joyride. It's like fighting Metal Gear Excelsus, but with more rhythm.

🌪️ Mistral: (blowing a playful breeze) Couldn't have said it better myself. This game's as refreshing as a Mistral wind.

[THE WINDS OF DESTRUCTION LOG OUT]

🗡️ Raiden: (nodding) Another successful mission. Now, back to saving the world and slicing through cyborgs.

I guess the game had a story but not sure what it was other than save your sister from the bad guy.  The game has two locomotion types, one where you swim and another where you pilot a submarine type of vessel.  You do not choose these modes, they are dictated by the level.  More of the game is swimming, and that also has more of the puzzles as you can interact with the world more.  The sub hops to the beat when moving and can shoot and regenerate so those areas tend to be easier and quicker.  The puzzles are pretty straightforward and mainly consist of setting up some bouncers so you can destroy obstacles and timing based sequences where you need to carry power to a new source while dodging dangerous environments and enemies.  There are some other interesting things going on like perspective changing devices but these mostly felt like a novelty.  The rhythm aspect, in terms of gameplay, is kind of limited and can largely be ignored and just helps you avoid damage if you time things right.

The game has it's good points, mainly in the presentation and music.  Nice 2D graphics, great animation and a soundtrack that all the enemies pulse to.  The gameplay itself is somewhat fun, but nothing to get excited about.

Negatives would mainly be the movement (playing with the mouse).  Your character is swimming and has a certain momentum, which makes stopping where you want pretty tough sometimes.  Unfortunately the game will often require you to stop to avoid bullets or whatnot, which is awkward.  Also it is controlled by where your mouse cursor is currently positioned.  That's fine but sometimes you just lose track of where it is and have trouble going where you want.  Normally it's not a big deal but you will often be required to do some precise movements, especially late in the game, and this can be frustrating.  Some of the late game puzzles/challenges also were not so fun like a big maze you need to move walls around for with little direction.  Fun at first, but became tedious and wasn't helped by having to it twice as I was supposed to kill all the enemies in there but was never told that.  Also there are places in the game where you can get stuck or triggers fail to happen and have to restart the level (luckily you can).  Happened to me once and saw others mention it for other areas.  Beyond that, the puzzles are all pretty simple.  The only tough aspects are sometimes figuring out what you are supposed to do, where you are supposed to go or just getting there fast enough.

Overall, the game is fine but not my cup of tea.  If you are looking for something to occupy a handful of hours, it fits the bill but likely won't be anything you remember for very long unless you really love the music.",1683945144,1683945144,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

At first it was a fairly standard puzzle collectathon - but then numerous issues emerged.

First, the ""enemies"" - they're not really enemies - they're obstacles.  And yes, I realize that enemies typically are obstacles - but in this game that's pretty much all they are.  
You could take away the art and replace them with circles and you'd get fairly the same effect - they're just in the way, for the sake of being in the way.  I don't know if the developers thought they would be a ""challenge"" - but they're just maddening.  
In the beginning it's rare to see enemies - but then you get an ""upgrade"" later that essentially combines two of your abilities into one.  And they teach you how to use it in 
a training ground - but then they just swarm you with enemies almost immediately thereafter and it doesn't really matter that there's health orbs - the upgrade 
isn't that useful in that situation, you essentially have to time *running away* until you finally get it and are able to deal with it.

But that takes way too long, in a game with very diminishing returns.  Let's talk about the collectathon aspect for a moment.  You get introduced to the purple 
""shiny trinkets"" early on and are told that they're good, for reasons. So if you've been trying to collect them, great.  Except for the stage design.

Since most people won't be following a guide directly, there are forks in the proverbial road.  So if you veer left and that's the way the game progresses,
too bad, so sad! You can't go back to get those purple collectables that you missed unless you restart the level.  And this game isn't good enough to restart 
a level.

All the trinkets do is open up a game dev gallery anyways, as far as I can tell.  And I don't care what happens if you get all of them.  That's the problem.
The game makes you not care.

Eventually vehicle sections are introduced, allowing the player to shoot certain enemies.  And while this is satisfying, it gets increasingly obnoxious when 
you realize that although you have limited ammo, your gun overheats - and the enemies respawn - meaning that unless you time it just right, you'll get hit
even though you should be able to shoot.  And be hit you will.  Over and over again, ping-ponging back and forth between enemies.  The slight saving grace
is that the ship auto-heals, but even that's not enough.  If the overheating was removed, it would be so much more pleasant to do the ship sections.
But again, I think that's the developer's idea of challenge - I call it a *slog*.

And I hope you like autoscrollers!  Because although the initial levels take a metroidvania-esque exploration aspect, the ship levels tend to be autoscrolling,
and there are some parts where you need to go in one direction very fast - regardless of the shiny trinkets you are missing - because again, you cannot go back.

The musical choices are also very strange.  I *know* that at least two, maybe three music tracks in this game have vocals.  But I couldn't tell you what the heck
the lyrics were, because although I checked (and all I found was a simple audio slider) for sound options, for some reason the backing music is so muted
I cannot hear the lyrics except in certain parts.

With all the forced ""keep going"" in the game, it tires you out and you lose caring about the plot.  You just want to finish the game to finish the game and move on,
those eight feared words, ""I don't care what happens to these people"" - or in this case, Symphonians?

The puzzles are mostly OK, but there was one and pretty much only one that was out of place, or at least I don't recall being taught the basics of the solution.
You have to grab a power generator that is opening a gate, and bounce around and then dash to get out of the gate that's closing with the generator.
However, since that was like the only one that did that, I kept trying (and failing) to take the generator with me through a red portal that will only transport
you.  Other than that one, the puzzles were fine.  And since there's a lot of puzzles, that's a good thing that didn't really add to the frustration.

The other big frustrating part was the health system.  Essentially, there's a health bar and you hit orbs to get health back.  But it's pretty pointless.
Checkpoints are generally pretty good in this game, so if you die, who cares.  But it does matter with these spiky things that you can temporarily disable.
It seems very odd that some of them are one hit kills and yet some of them aren't.  And when you try to get through them, very often the controls lead you
to getting caught on the side and then bam, one hit kill.  Or in the ship sections, bounced around enemies.  The controls of this game aren't the controls that
the game really should have shipped with - better tiny movement options would prevent the sticking that occurred with the enemies.  Also,
with the health, the only real reason to keep it high is because the developers made the terrible decision of making the colors all messed up when the health is low.
It's more annoying than the Zelda low heart announce sound - so you'll get the orbs, even if you probably could have used them later, just because the UI is now awful.

All in all, this game isn't worth the experience and the gameplay gets really old really fast.  I am glad I don't have to replay this.  
I think you should be glad if you never played it in the first place.  
And I'm kinda sad I have to write this out, because I know developing games is hard work and I know the developers tried - but it just didn't take.

I have a relatively good PC. Its meant for handling VR, 3D modeling, and server hosting, so it's equipped to handle tough graphics and processing.

I'm personally just stalled out there in the parasite nest ""shortcut"" area with no way to fix it so it will go again. 

I do have good things to say about the game! It's very cute and simple in a good way. The puzzles are elementary, but fun enough to solve.

Visual and graphic quality : 9/10. The graphic quality is good enough and I really love the artistic choices.

Music & Sound vibe : 10/10. The idea of each level starting with very few beats and slowly ramping up to the full tune while you progress into it is a trully cool idea. It really gives a special thing to the sound ambiance of this game and that's what's make it really enjoyable.

Gameplay : 8/10. Overall simple and efficient. You very quickly get the grasp of it and that's all what matters. I found the ""skill"" which makes you find hidden sounds (don't have the name in english sorry) a bit underused tho.

Game Design : 6/10.  I found the game design to be the weak point of this game. Nothing ruining it but sometimes it makes BeatBuddy a bit less enjoyable :
- There is plenty of time when the game design makes it that you have a split second to react, or miss some pink crystals because a vacuum plant or an event will forbid you from erh, swimming back? This result in a certain amount missed and at some point I was like, yeah, fuck the 100%. 
- The rhythm of the game is a big slow overall due to its puzzle nature. It tends to desync you with its core : beats, as you slow down and focus more on solving it rather than playing in rhythm.

Нам нужно перемещаться по зонам, решать иногда головоломки и задачки, иногда убегать от клыкастых рыб и обрушивающихся потолков. И все это мы делаем в ритме танца. Есть бит, к которому мы должны прислушиваться и двигаться четко по нему, чтобы аккуратно проходить туннели с препятствиями. 
Честно говоря, музыка хоть на всех 6 уровнях разная, но какая-то задалбливающая. Я надеялся на что-то приятное, типа трипхопа хотя бы, а тут тыцтыцтыцтыц, бумбумбумбум. И все такое монотонное, что просто ужас. 
Загадки и препятствия в скором времени перестанут удивлять и будут представлять собой смешения один одного. Был один шипастый колобок? Ок, вот вам два. Потом будет три. Потом будет уйма. 5 секунд вам давали на прохождение лабиринта? А вот вам 4 секунды. В игре может 3-4 момента было всего, которые у меня вызвали чувство восторга. 
Графика - ничего особенного. Инди.
Меню - как будто в старом ДВД. 
По итогу я честно заставлял себя пройти до конца. Меня что-то не торкнуло. Хотя в целом я не могу сказать, что игра плохая. Она вполне забавная, недлинная, но просто не моя.

This game is a music based rhythm game with a minor focus on exploration. It has beautiful visuals, fantastic music, and it runs pretty well on weak hardware. But as for the gameplay, it's quality, but an acquired taste. I should start off by saying that this is a really unique game. Even amongst the niche genre of rhythm games, this game makes some innovative choices.

One example would definitely be the movement system of this game. It's not often that you see a rhythm game that doesn't streamline your choices into left/right, yes/no, now/later options. Most rhythm games are very binary/limited in their decision making. It's usually just pure timing as opposed to any dynamic decision making.

This game isn't like that - you traverse the world with full access to all 360 degrees of movement, but rhythm based. You can choose whatever direction you want and float along to the beat of the song. That's really rare, and it makes the game both freeing and difficult to control at the same time. The reason why most rhythm games force the player to make binary choices is because it is both easy to create (as a game developer) and easy to control (as a game player). And having control is integral for a rhythm game. If you get caught on a corner or accidentally misalign your direction, you may not land on the spot you need to be on time, and it can cause you to get punished in-game. This makes sense - a rhythm game is about being perfect, or getting punished for it. On paper, I don't have issues with this, even if there are some seemingly unfair punishments.

What I take issue with is that, your character is really floaty. Your character is underwater, so your not really walking or hopping to the beat, you are swimming to the beat, and that carries its own sense of momentum and weight that is not very easy to control. Imagine playing a 2d underwater level in some platformer, but the level focuses on sharp timing and aiming. Chances are, it would get frustrating quickly. But that's the thing - it all depends on what you are trying to do in this game. If you choose to do the basic path and don't try and dig around to find stuff, traversing the world isn't that hard, and you should get by relatively fine. However, if you dig around, you may find that the controls are holding you back from being able to have as much fun with this game.

Which leads to my second point about this games innovation - this a rhythm game with a healthy focus on exploration. That's definitely new to the genre, and the reason why they are able to do this so well is because of that 360 degree movement. Points should also be given to the beautiful art direction encouraging the player to look around certain areas of the map. Since you are able to go in any direction you want, you find yourself naturally exploring the level. And the game typically rewards exploration with a collectible shard that I haven't quite discovered its purpose yet, but I'm told it has value later on.

Yet another point to this games innovation is the level design - these levels are huge. I cannot emphasize that enough. Now, checkpoints are very frequent (<5 minutes apart), so you can quit out without losing much progress at all. More importantly, you don't really need to remember where stuff was before if you come back - all you need to remember is the game mechanics you learned near the beginning of that level. It really feels like the game is aware of how big the levels are, and intentionally plays with that in mind. But as I was saying, this is really innovative because, most rhythm games have levels that are confined within a small room (or on-rails levels like Beat Saber). Focusing on not just the timing of your presses, but where that is respective to something that is really far away can change the way you play this game compared to other rhythm games.

That more or less wraps up my thoughts on the games innovations. I know it was a lot, but I talked so much about it because I really feel like this game is worth purchasing if you're looking for something new. This game tries a lot of new things - most of it works, some of it not-so-much. But that's part of the fun of trying something new.

As for the rest of the game, I more or less voiced my thoughts in the beginning of this review. The only other thing I would add is that, while the levels of this game are fairly wide and open, the game itself is very much linear. There is usually only 1-2 ways to beat a level, though occasionally the game will let you be open ended about it (usually when you get inside a vehicle for parts of each level).

I would definitely recommend this game at full price if you are trying to find something new. This definitely fits the bill. On top of that, the music is fantastic, so I would encourage you to buy the soundtrack along with it. But if you just want a fun rhythm game, maybe wait for a sale, as the inconsistent maneuvering might get in the way of the fun.


UPDATE -- I forgot to add one other thing. There is one part of the game where something didn't load properly, so my character was stuck in the room with no way out (softlock). Thankfully, the frequent checkpoints meant that I only wasted about 5 minutes of my time. All the same, it is important that you know that softlocks exist, and they may occur once or twice in your playthrough.

UPDATE -- Ok, I have to take back a few things. When I wrote this review, I was more than halfway through the game, so I figured I was safe to give my thoughts. Well, I hate to say it, but the water physics start to become a pretty big problem once you get to a certain stage. Up until this point, precision maneuvering was only necessary for secrets/optionals, but once you reach this level, they start asking precision just to traverse the levels. I got through it, but that was officially too much to ask for. On top of that, I ran into yet another softlock. I still give my original verdict - if you are looking for something new, this is worth exploring, but now I really need to emphasize that this doesn't work very well as a rhythm game.

UPDATE - Finally beat the game. All in all, I would say it's worth my money, and thankfully, the final level made use of less annoying features than the second to last one did. In fact, the final level was a pretty good one to close on! Typically, I would consider replaying the game on whatever New Game+ option there was, but I won't even think about it for this game. I'm glad I got to experience it, but I don't plan to come back to this game unless I want something new again, or I'm looking for creative inspiration/guidance.",1608599447,1609370775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Early-to-Mid game the levels music is almost entirely produced by the enemies and objects in the environment!
+ Some good music with a beat that'll stick with you well after turning off the game.
+ Gameplay mechanics are for the most part fun and creative.

The Bad:
- Late game the environmental music is just there like any other game, and is no longer the product of enemies/objects.
- Gameplay starts to become a bit stale once new concepts stop being introduced.
- Story and characters lack any depth, and the incredibly brief and underwhelming ending does nothing to change this.
- Has known bugs with story dialog not appearing, and one bug which can cause a levels logic to completely break (softlock) requiring the level to be restarted from scratch.

Final thoughts:
Being a 'music-focused underwater puzzle action adventure' puts it in a unique position that there's really nothing else out there like it. It's a shame that the developers never fixed the various technical issues, but even with them this was one of the more enjoyable indie games I've played. I don't think it's worth the full asking price of $10, but at its typical sale price of $1-2 I'd definitely recommend checking it out.

The highlight of this concept is how the music dynamically changes, with some enemies doing actions to the bass, or adding a high-hat to the music or shooting to a synth melody.  It's pretty neat and the music is good overall.  I could imagine it being a bit more catchy and responsive to what the player does, but it is pleasant. 

The game mostly consists of puzzles and avoiding/attacking enemies.  The puzzles aren't necessarily about keeping a beat or rhythm going, but more about navigating the environments as everything moves to a beat.  However you only have to be aware of this with enemies that you need to avoid.  Although I think there could be more player choices connected to the beat or rhythm, the puzzles are well designed and there's enough variety.

I did have fun with this and even chuckled at some well-written dialogue.  It is very easy and forgiving, which I actually did appreciate.  I died a few times, but there were generous checkpoints throughout which I was very grateful about.  The art looks good and level design is clear.

Что собой представляет эта игра? А она из себя представляет собой незамысловатый платформер, где вам придется ""плавать"" по игровому миру и разрешать головоломки под аккомпанемент из весьма годных треков. Особенностью игры (и по совместительству её фишкой) является то, что большинство действий в игре происходит в ритме музыкальной композиции на фоне, а элементы окружения будут издавать различные звуки, отлично гармонирующие с проигрываемыми треками. Итак, давайте перейдем к плюсам и минусам игры! ВОУ!
ПЛЮСЫ:
+ Геймплей. Незамысловатый геймплей играет огромную роль в игре. Особенности связанные с синергией геймплея и музыки, интересные головоломки, над которыми вам даже иногда приходится попотеть. Разнообразие. Вам дают поиграть не только за собственного персонажа, но и за некое подобие батискафа. Разнообразные противники;
+ Музыка. Музыка в игре отличная. Не сказал бы, что треков очень много, но их вполне достаточно для полноценной игры, где данные треки являются стержневым элементом. Плюс именно с этой игры я познакомился с творчеством Parov Stelar, что открыло мне дорогу в мир электросвинга;
+ Дизайн и стилистика. Игра отлично нарисована, анимации плавные, приятные. Элементы фона и основные декорации превосходно дополняют друг друга. Бывает, что фон сильно отличается и контрастирует с основным визуальным контентом, но это не про эту игру;
+ Интересные персонажи. Хоть персонажи и не играют основной роли, но они также сделаны в стиле игры, их речь также является музыкальной (нечто похожее на битбоксинг). Персонажи также отлично отрисованы и анимированы;
МИНУСЫ:
- Сюжет. Сюжет очень простенький и существует лишь для галочки, к сожалению;
- Продолжительность игры. Игра сама по себе небольшая. Является ли это достоинством или недостатком - решать вам. Лично я считаю, что хронометраж игры напрямую влияет на запоминаемость игры, да и треков хотелось бы побольше)
___________
В целом все, если есть какие-нибудь иные достатки и недостатки, о которых я забыл, то пишите о них в комментарии к обзору. Удачки вам и печенек :3

Pros in no particular order:
+ weird but nice story
+ great soundtrack
+ sweet yet simple graphics
+ responsive controls
+ beginner friendly

Cons in no particular order:
- feels like there is an ingame ad that constantly remind you of bying the soundtrack
- controls are responsive but yet bad: constant underwater physics and a stupid mixture of mouse and 1 (!) keyboard button
- since it is rythm based you either are good at it or not but ""learning"" rythm is kind of pointless
- ridles are on elementary school level
- no self zooming but stupid auto-zooming; this gets really annoying because there are several chase sections where the game zooms in very close to artificially increase the difficulty which I call poor level design; same problem occurs when you have to deliver the time bombs
- autosave system which cannot be redone so you loose some parts of the game (i. g. gems) because you cannot go back or you have to replay the whole section
- dialog boxes must be hit to be closed (no keyboard or fast click button)

Conclusion:
I do not like this one though it is done pretty well. It felt boring. And the zooming reminded me of the 90s where bad AIs simply cheated to increase difficulty.

哎呀~别想了~你的肚子是制作人特意搞大的啦~
你永远都没法把它减掉的啦~哪怕你再肿么按照音乐的节奏来运动~
[/h1]
游戏解谜似乎并不算太难~
可为啥我玩了这么久都没解锁一个成就呀~emm~那就看来很难吧~

~游戏音乐节奏感非常强~而且主角场景和音乐的配合也很完美~

Historia jest dość prosta. Świat jest w niebezpieczeństwie i musimy go uratować. Gra jest podzielona na 6 części. Każda z nich ma inną nutę melodyjną. Pierwszą przeszkodą, którą  poznajemy są muszle ślimaków. Blokują one przejście i jedną z możliwości ich przejścia jest wybicie się na bębnach, które rytmicznie pulsują. Następnie poznajemy lustra które pozwalają zmieniać kierunek w którym bębny nas wystrzeliwują. Odbicia można łączyć by w krótkim czasie przejść duży dystans. Dalej poznajemy takie elementy jak jeżowce które chowają kolce na pewien czas jak dezaktywujemy kraby, dzbaneczniki które pozwalają się przemieszczać w niewiadome miejsca. Urządzenia zasilające drzwi, bąbelki które trzeba przechodzić w rytmie i wiele innych. Gdzieś w połowie gry zaczynają się pojawiać wyzwania czasowe. Nie są one wybitnie trudne ale czasem nie wiedziałem którą drogę wybrać.
	Są dwa tryby sterowania. Pierwszy punktowy. Polega na tym, że postać porusza się w miejsce gdzie kliknęliśmy. Tego trybu bardzo nie polecam. Postać nie omija w nim żadnych przeszkód i często się blokuje. Drugi tryb, w którym przytrzymujemy klawisz i postać porusza się w wybranym kierunku. Zdarza się, że musimy coś podnieść i przenieść. Wydaje mi się, że postać nie zawsze chce chwycić przedmiot, który wisi w wodzie. Też jak jest kilka przedmiotów obok siebie to ciężko wybrać konkretny. Poza normalnym ruchem mamy jeszcze zryw. Pozwala on przemierzyć szybko krótki dystans. W połowie gry odblokowujemy wariant zrywu który pozwala go wykonać do określonego celu w formie ataku. Poza tym mamy jeszcze jazdę pojazdem z regenerującym się życiem i karabinem. Karabin zawsze jest skierowany w jednym kierunku i można go obrócić z pojazdem na specjalnych strzałkach na planszy.
Grafika jest dość spójna kolorowa i miejscami niezbyt czytelna. Czasem zastanawiałem się czy dany element jest tłem czy nie. Plansze są dość ładne ale ciekawi mnie jak bym odebrał grę gdyby użyli zmienili styl na jakiś z szkiców koncepcyjnych. Muzyka jest jak dla mnie całkiem przyjemna. Nie mogę tego samego powiedzieć o dubbingu. Nie przemawia do mnie koncept bitowania, to jest dźwięków typu bumcypuf, prytypum, pomiędzy wyrazami. Okropnie mi się tego słuchało i tylko czekałem aż dialog się skończy.
	Gra jest w miarę krótka bo zajęła mi 7 godzin. Jest w niej osiągnięcie za przejście gry w 3 godziny więc na pewno da się krócej. Większość czasu szukałem kryształów. Pozwalają one odblokować szkice koncepcyjne. Klejnoty są zazwyczaj na głównej trasie ale też niektóre są poukrywane na planszy. Poziom trudności nie jest wygórowany i młodsi gracze powinni sobie poradzić. Mam pewne wątpliwości co do rytmicznego przechodzenia przez bąble. Wydaje mi się, że czas w jakim przez nie przechodzimy jest za długi i jak użyjemy zrywu w rytmie to trafimy w barierę. Dużo lepszym sposobem dla mnie było użycie zrywu w momencie jak bariera jest zamknięta. Praktycznie za każdym razem udało mi się w tedy przez nią przejść.
Podsumowując. Gra dość ciekawa. Niezbyt długa. Dobrze stopniuje poziom trudności. Dosyć tania. Fajna muzyka. Nie angażująca fabuła ale i nie satysfakcjonujący ending. Mimo wszystko grę polecam.

После знакомства с шедевральной Crypt of the Necrodancer я решил поглубже копнуть ритм-игры и понять, в музыке их успех или все-таки в прочих игровых механиках. Как выяснилось, ритм-игра - это дополнительная механика, решает все-таки основной жанр. В CotN это был рогалик, а вот Beatbuddy - это приключение-головоломка. По-своему неплохая и заслуживающая прохождения, но больше главы за раз я не осиливал.

Удивительное.
В этой игре я нашел для себя две удивительные вещи. Во-первых, это осознание того, что для ритм-игры музыка недостаточно хорошо увязана с геймплеем. Грубо говоря, танцуя (поймав ритм) за монитором вы не станете играть лучше. Да и в тех редких местах, где ритм решает, попасть в него проще простого, игра не наказывает за отсутствие слуха. Так что можно смело считать Beatbuddy не столько ритм-игрой, сколько игрой про музыку с неплохим саундтреком. Вторая удивительная вещь - я реально не понял сюжет и не видел никакого смысла в нем разбираться. Серьезно, можно пройти всю игру, очень поверхностно понимая смысл действия героя, когда он по факту решает кучу головоломок. Понять сюжет в том числе мешает адовая озвучка в сценах и роликах (с музыкальностью местного королевства переборщили).

Плюсы.
- Для меня самым ярким плюсом наверное стала даже не музыка, а красочная картинка, фоны игры, живописующие подводный мир.
- Но музыка тоже хороша, пусть и своеобразна.
- Есть интересные головоломки и игровые механики.

Минусы.

The mechanics can get a little repetative,  along with puzzles that are almost too easy, but it's short, sweet, and fun. 

I'm surprised this game doesn't have more attention. It's not groundbreaking, but it is definitely a solid example of an indie platformer. The underwater mechanics are often done quite poorly in games like these, but Beatbuddy manages to make an all around smooth experience. My only issues with the controls were when trying to ""fast swim."" The turns became as wide as a schooner's radius, and hard to navigate some tight passages where dashing was quite necessary to get through. 

The puzzles are simple, and mostly based on rhythm. Getting through unharmed was quite difficult for me, but I am musically challenged. Luckily, there's plenty of healing items and checkpoints scattered throughout the game. Actually dying was a rarity, and when I did, I didn't lose much progress. This game may be too easy for most, so if you're seeking a challenge, this may be the wrong game for you. If you're looking for a family friendly game to play with a young, budding gamer, or if, like me, you find yourself in a mood where you just want to play a game without thinking too much or working too hard, this would be an excellent choice. 

The story is brief, and linear. It's more about gameplay here. I wish they had done a little more with the story, because the premise of the guardians of the world waking up, disrupting the very rhythm of everything, sounds quite a bit more dramatic and epic than ""chase down the prince who is making this happen."" It would have been quite the thrill to actually run into these guardians, and have a bit more of that backstory expanded. 

All in all, Threak did quite a nice job with their first full fledged game, and if they ever put out a Beatbuddy 2 with more focus on their universe, I'll be all over it. 

7/10 

P.S. Collecting the gems unlocks a behind the scenes ""Making Of"" slideshow of Threak from their very beginning. Well worth it, imo. Harkons back to the days where every game had unlockable concept arts and whatnot.

The gameplay is fairly simple.  There's exploration, some puzzles, and a few quasi-rhythm-game elements.  There are a number of collectables to find, but as best I can tell they only unlock extra art and background outside the main experience.  The puzzles are just hard enough to make you think, but still pretty easy.  The mostly involve figuring out how to open doors in the right order, or navigating mazes.

The rhythm-game aspects are most interesting, particularly as they also tie in to the setting.  Some obstacles can only be passed on the beat of the music; many enemies attack on the beat; some objects can only be interacted with in time to the music.  This helps build the world, one where music is the underlying fabric, and helps the excuse plot have more weight.

[h1] I really thought I was going to love this game... [/h1]

I took one good look at this game and I said to myself: “I’m going to have a good time with this game” and I did, during the first level… and after that first level I couldn’t have been happier when I saw those credits roll.

[h1] So, Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians? Sounds epic right? [/h1]

Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians is basically a swimming simulator with a few puzzles along the way and a neat twist that, unfortunately, gets old really fast. You play as the game as Beatbuddy, a cute little humanoid blob who is one of the three guardians of Symphonia (an underwater kingdom). Symphonia is, apparently, powered by music and music is generated through the three guardians who are always sleeping and dreaming of it. So after beatbuddy gets awoken by his sister, it’s clear that trouble is afoot. 

[h1] For a guardian, Beatbuddy sure doesn't look all that powerful [/h1]

While being a guardian of an underwater kingdom sounds like a powerful title, Beatbuddy sure doesn’t feel like a powerful guardian. In fact, he feels like a regular resident of symphony. Using his “powers”, beatbuddy must find what is causing a disturbance in the music, fix it and go back to sleep with his siblings, or at least, that’s how I understood the story. It’s not told very well. It starts well enough where you get this German-ish narrator who starts telling the lore and after a few lines, he goes quiet until the very end of the game, where he delivers the closing lines. What happened there? 

[h1] Easy controls and cute graphics [/h1]

The game looks pretty with its cartoon graphics. The controls are very easy to learn too. All you need is your mouse and occasionally the space key.

[h1] What do fish do? [/h1]

So, what is the gameplay like? Well, you control Beatbuddy with your mouse and you are trying to get from point A to point B through a 2D underwater levels. Like I said above, Beatbuddy can’t do much but swim and maybe dash. Later in the game, he learns how to attack but it barely feels like a power up since it doesn’t add much to the game. So what you do is, just like Dory from Finding Nemo says “Just keep swimming, just keep swimming”.

[h1] Move to the beat with some awesome tunes [/h1]

The neat twist this game has it the music. Every stage has a different song and the each level pretty much plays the song. So at first, you will only hear the most basic melody but then you will discover jump pads that add their own sounds to the song you are listening to, which enhances it. As you discover more things in the world, the song gets better. By the time I finished level 1 I was blown away. The level started with a catchy theme but as I kept going and finding things like crabs, jump pads, lasers and other stuff, the song kept getting more instruments and sounds. It’s truly a marvel. This is the case in each level too. The developers seem to be rather proud of their music as, even at the pause screen, you get the link to buy their soundtrack.

Unfortunately, having good music that improves as you keep going through the level is the only redeeming quality I found about beatbuddy. As much as I loved the first level, it because clear very soon that this was the only good thing the game has going for it. 

[h1] Music alone isn't enough to justify such a boring game [/h1]

Music aside, this game is just boring. You swim around, sometimes you solve a very basic puzzle, every other chapter you drive a submarine and the levels all look the same. The game never makes any daring attempts to spice up the gameplay and plays it very safe until the very end. Yes sure, you listen to some catchy tunes but they really don’t make up for the not so innovative gameplay.

Luckily, the game is kind of short. I managed to beat it in just under 5 hours but it’s possible to beat it in less than 3. Other than that, you have some gems that you can collect which unlock pictures of the developers goofing around in their office.

[h1] The music is nice but the game is boring [/h1]

My final rating: don’t play this game. Buy the soundtrack and play it while playing a better game that doesn’t have great music.

From my personal experience it's pretty forgiving and you actually don't need do be THAT rhythmic. It took a bit of time until I ""got"" the controls which is a bit rhythm based in some situations. Sometimes you fight things. It's pretty simple in a way that you just have to have some timing.

It was a couple times in bundles (I got it in one some years ago), but you can also get it for less than 2€ in a deal. I would say it's definitely worth it, if you like the music and the puzzles.

In this game you are some kind of musical thing that lives in a musical subterranean world where the prince is ruining things and kidnapping your musical sisters. By moving through stupid maps and completing boring and frustrating puzzles, you must save them. 

The worst thing is that, actually, the game starts being really funny and it could be a great platformer... However, 
 there are several reasons wich makes the game a 'meh' one. The most important ones, in my opinion:

* It sells itself as a 'musical platform' however rhythm doesn't have any kind of prominence.

* Controls are **NOT** responsive. It feels clunky and you'll die a lot of times because the response is slow and/or wrong. At least with mouse.

* It's repetitive. Despide the timing puzzle I can't pass, the rest of the game is basically the same puzzles over and over, being difficult by adding more frustrating elements, not clever ones. The game has a feeling of progress by ""cheating"" with more elements that will kill you thanks to the clumsy control of the thingy.

Pros
- some story (save the princess :D)
- nice art and animation


Cons
- framerate up to 800 really drives the gpu up and
consumes allot of power and no way to stop not even
from the nVidia control panel, awful

- clunky menu system 

- beat based movement is way too annoying and cumbersome,
 just leave  me to go already, i have faster reactions
and button presses than this beat

- the constant zoom in and out
without player controlling it is horrible

- the scenery constantly getting in my way obstructing my vision,
 this is a side scroller but if i put myself into the character i
would be able to see forward and the sides, it's just unreal

- sometimes everything is falling apart and you are rushed this is
heavily forced upon the player at the end, suddenly gets harder
and the mechanics are interfering

- constant game breaking bugs at each chapter, have to restart
each time, i just stopped playing this game after each hour or two
because it got way too annoying to just start over because the game
suddenly stopped all the mechanics and you can't advance,
the game is effectively broken

- the annoying amateur beatboxing and half voice acted normally
half just gibberish is unacceptable, i stopped all the music and
sounds effectively rendering the mechanics of the beat based
gameplay useless, just played the game as a platformer and got
annoyed because the buttons didn't work when i pushed them,
the game started to feel as a bad platformer

- puzzles are very boring after a couple of hours, same ones
over and over, also carrying the keys from A to B on a timer and
sometimes because of the checkpoints the game gets you stuck
making you unable to get to the key again or unable to go back to
the point to bring the key so again restarting the chapter

with a program called Dance eJay, just a fun music

you made your own samples, this game soundtrack is very generic

Note; it would be very hard to make the achievements for the
secrets that i haven't even found one and the completing of the
game under 3 hours would be horrible because of the chapter

Drei Hamburger Studenten gründen die Indieschmiede Threaks und veröffentlichen 2013 auf Steam Beatbuddy Tale of the Guardians. Das Spiel ist eine äußerst gelungene Mischung aus Rythmus, Action und Puzzle Plattformer.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Die Geschichte ist schnell erzählt. Es gibt unsere Spielfigur, den Beatbuddy, der im Unterwasser Reich Synfonia ein chilliges Leben zwischen Wasserbläschen, Krabben und Pflanzen zu führen scheint. Alles in Synfonia bewegt sich im Rythmus zur Musik und das ist natürlich elektronische Musik. Irgendwie fühlt es sich an, als wäre man in der Repeat-Schleife eines Disney Kino Titels gefangen. Alles, wirklich alles, hat den Beat in Synfonia. Jedes Objekt verursacht irgend einen Ton oder eine Melodie und alles zusammen ergibt die Musik. Aber eines Tages taucht ein Bösewicht auf, der alle nach seinen Bongos tanzen lassen will. Das wollen sich Beatbuddy und seine Freunde natürlich nicht gefallen lassen und so planen sie den Bösewicht zu sabotieren und seine Pläne zu vereiteln.

Sonderlich viel Tiefgang ist hier nicht zu erwarten, aber wer würde einem Comic-Heftchen schon vorwerfen wollen, dass es ihm an und Bedeutsamkeit fehlt? Beatbuddy ist ein Spiel für Gelegenheitsspieler und die Zielgruppe sind eindeutig eher Kinder und Jugendliche. Einmal abgesehen davon ist das Spiel im Wesentlichen ein Plattformer und seit wann müssen die unbedingt eine sensationelle Story haben? Die Geschichte ist kindgerecht und einigermaßen witzig und charmant vorgetragen.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Das Gameplay in Beatbuddy Tale of the Guardians ist ein wenig speziell. Zunächst einmal befinden wir uns unter Wasser und die Steuerung ist bewusst ein wenig schwammig und träge, weil so ähnlich würde man Bewegungen unter Wasser auch erwarten. Wer sich hier über eine schwammige Steuerung beschwert, hat irgendwie nicht kapiert, was das Spiel abzubilden versucht. Nachdem man sich nach einer Weile an die Steuerung gewöhnt hat und mehr oder weniger ziellos durch die Level schwimmt, beginnt man ganz unweigerlich auch die Spielfigur im Rythmus der Musik zu bewegen. Das Spiel selbst begünstigt das, denn alles in Synfonia ist irgendwie leichter, wenn man es im richtigen Rythmus tut und unter Wasser kommt man am besten vorwärts, wenn man auf den Beat der Basedrum hört. Das weiß doch jedes Kind.

Wer Musik im Blut hat, dem wird dieses Spiel zufliegen. Wenn man auf die Musik hört, spielt es sich über weite Strecken wie von selbst. Ein paar vereinzelte Puzzle oder auch der ein oder andere etwas größer geratene Levelabschnitt können erstmal verwirrend erscheinen, letztlich überfordert einen Beatbuddy aber ganz sicher nicht, denn die Lösungen sind immer reichlich offensichtlich.

[h1]Grafik & Sound[/h1]

Sowohl die handgezeichneten und oft ziemlich bunten Levelhintergründe, als auch die Spielfiguren und Objekte im Spiel sind wirklich schön geworden. Für mein Empfinden passt hier alles wunderbar zusammen.

Der Soundtrack ist eine klangvolle Reise durch das eher unbekannte Genre des Elektro Swing (& Funk). Hier kann Beatbuddy ganz groß auftrumpfen. Verblüffender Weise ist es den Entwicklern sogar gelungen, Parov Stelar, den Gottvater des Elektro Swing, für ihr Spiel zu begeistern und er hat direkt den Track für den ersten Level geliefert. Hut ab, hier kann man nicht nur ein ausgezeichnetes Gespür für Musik erkennen, sondern offenbar auch ein gutes Händchen beim Verhandeln mit Musikern.

[h1]Kritik[/h1]

An einem Indie Titel rumzunörgeln ist immer leicht. Solche Spiele sollte man nicht mit Triple-A Titeln vergleichen. Innerhalb seiner Möglichkeiten hat Beatbuddy wirklich ganze Arbeit geleistet und so will ich mich mit meiner Kritk auch mal ein wenig zurückhalten.

Über mehr als einen Schwierigkeitsgrad hätte mich schon gefreut, denn das ist die offensichtlichste Schwachstelle dieses Spiels. Mir war es ein wenig zu einfach und so manchem unmusikalischen Grundschüler oder Puzzle Anfänger ist es vielleicht zu schwer. Auch der Wiederspielwert ist für mich ohne weitere Schwierigkeitsgrade so gut wie nicht vorhanden. Ein bißchen schade, denn so hätte man mit vergleichsweise wenig Aufwand deutlich mehr Spieler erreichen können, als mit dem Spinn-Off DLC ""Beatbuddy on Tour"", das ich komplett überflüssig finde.

Beatbuddy ist überraschend leistungshungrig. Das müsste vermutlich nicht sein. Mit einer etwas besseren Programmierung wäre das bestimmt zu vermeiden gewesen.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]

Beatbuddy Tale of the Guardians ist ein Nischenspiel, das ich nicht unbedingt jedem empfehlen würde. Man sollte für das Genre Elekrto Swing oder elektronische Musik ganz generell empfänglich sein. Den Soundtrack findet man leicht auf youtube und ähnlichen Internet Seiten. Hört also ruhig mal rein, bevor ihr das Spiel kauft.

Man sollte auch etwas für leichte Puzzleplattformer übrig haben, denn wer nur besonders schwere Spiele wie Flame Over und Geometry Dash mag, wird sich hier drei bis vier Stunden lang zu Tode langweilen.

Ich liebe diesen Soundtrack und so fällt es mir nicht schwer zu sagen, dass mir Beatbuddy großen Spaß gemacht hat. Die Art und Weise wie hier Musikspiel und Puzzle Plattformer mit einer Unterwasserwelt verbunden wurden, ist ganz sicher etwas Besonderes. Ein Spiel wie Beatbuddy gibt es kein zweites mal und allein das ist schon ein gutes Kaufargument. Nachdem ich es mehr oder weniger am Stück durchgespielt habe, habe ich es ohne zu zögern in die Liste meiner Indie Favoriten aufgenommen. 

Am meisten Spaß dürfte jedoch die Zielgruppe der 5-12 Jährigen haben, denen man das Spiel mit gutem Gewissen schenken kann. Im Sale bekommt man es übrigens für unter zwei Euro. Beatbuddy ist ganz klar ein Geheimtipp für große und kleine Musikliebhaber. Daumen hoch!",1499357299,1499696615,True,9,0,0.529795348644256592,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I got this game in a humble bundle for years ago but couldn't get myself to finish it until now for several reasons

Firstly, the good parts: The soundtrack. It's excellent, no doubt about it. Also the game got some rather nice backgorunds and coloring for the most part, The humor kind of works for the most parts and the ""sound"" the characters does is charming. The story serves it's purpose but not much beyond that. Everything else is a mess with this game.

Now for the bad parts: It got some real serious bugs. I had to restart chapters 4 times because some objects in the world wouldn't allow me to interact with it thus making me stuck. 3 of these instances happened during the last 2 chapters of the game. Also, sometimes the music wouldn't load which is kind of damning in a game which requires you to time dodges and attack with the music. 

The game have a tendency to introduce a mechanic and then repeat it and puzzles involving this mechanic for far to long which makes the mechanic overstay it's welcome and starts feeling rather tedious quickly, especially since the level designers never really plays around with it enough to make it very complicated. Also, the level layouts can be maze-like and very confusing from time to time.

The controls just doesn't feel good. It often feels like you have no real control over where you'll appear when you dodge and if a enemy (or you) will register a hit. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but also you'll later get a power-up that is for some strange reason bound to the same key as your attack which is annoying. The game claims that you can rebind your buttons but it wouldn't let me when I tried. Not sure if that's a problem with the game or with my gamepad setup though.

If you have any passing intrest of this game, I'd recommend you to buy the soundtrack and leave the game to the sidelines.",1499177696,1499177696,False,4,0,0.528389334678649902,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What I liked about the game was that although a level is about 30 minutes long, it is divided into 5 checkpoint sections. You start off swimming around as your main character, but every other checkpoint you get to swim with an awesome vehicle that shoots and automatically regenerates health. This change of pace every two checkpoints keeps the game from feeling samey. I actually enjoyed these sections the most.

Another great thing are the collectibles. In your adventures you collect crystals to unlock pictures about the development of the game. Normally I don't care much for concept art, but this game shows quirky pictures of the development team with funny captions and a bit of an insight in the development of the game. I really enjoyed these. 

I also really liked the hand-drawn art-style the game had to offer. However, at times it was a little bit hard to see if a section was actually passable or a wall. This is just a slight annoyance, but to me it was worth it for such a great style. 

My favourite thing however, has to be the music. Every time I finished a level, I thought to myself: let's play something else. That was until I heard the music of the next level and decided to stay and play another one. The catchy guitars, amazing singing and grooving beats kept me nodding with my head almost the entire playthrough. The fact that different creatures add different sounds to the music is an amazing touch. 

Negatives: At times, the control of the character felt a little bit too slow and unresponsive for me, especially when I used the ""run"" (or in the case of this game: swim faster) button. There weren't many spaces where I felt I could utilize this skill. However, when there are timers in the game, they are forgiving and you do not need precision swimming to get through most of the levels. The dash ability that you get usually gives you enough speed to make it to certain points in time, and the ""run"" skill is therefor not needed to finish the game. 

Another thing that bugged me was that sometimes it was unclear if a path was a secret path with gems or a path to the next goal. This sometimes led to points where I realised I missed a secret, but was unable to go back and get it. It felt unfair that I had seen the path, but that it locked me out of that path for taking the ""wrong"" route. I guess this adds replayability, but I don't care much for it.

Overall I would say it is worth playing even if for the music alone! If you like funky, groovy music mixed with a little techno, this game is for you. Also, if you like an easy-going, casual side-scroller where you can just enjoy the surroundings and play through without too much effort, you'll like this one.",1497473037,1497473037,True,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Beatbuddy es uno de esos juegos que intimidan por la cantidad de menciones y premios que luego presumen en la portada. Respiré profundamente y decidí esperar lo mejor; estos juegos indie, algunas veces, se destacan por ser más bonitos o aspirar a romper ciertos límites narrativos antes que… no sé, jugarse bien. No es el caso de Beatbuddy. Afortunadamente hay un juego sólido e interesante detrás de la música y de las gráficas.

Supongo que el videojuego también inspirado en Ecco (habría que estudiar cuántos son hijos del delfín) porque todo ocurre en el mar y en estas plataformas, en vez de correr, te toca nadar. Beatbuddy presenta la historia de unos espíritus acuáticos que son los guardianes de la música y de algún océano. Tu papel es explorar varios mundos acuáticos al ritmo de música electrónica y en el camino recuperar algún artefacto para restaurar el balance. Típico pero chingón. La música, como lo promete el juego, es sabrosísima y el progreso afecta su ritmo; surgen los instrumentos y su beat acelera conforme avanzas.

Las gráficas tienen un estilo caricaturizado de alta resolución y calidad. Cada escena (personaje, fondo y enemigos) parece una caricatura que verías en MTV de los ochenta (muy ad hoc con el tema musical del juego). Es muy guapo apreciar cómo se mueven los villanos al ritmo de la música, y ello parece una invitación al jugador a incorporarse dentro del ritmo. Predomina cierta intención de evitar a los enemigos, bailar con ellos, en vez de la destrucción (ojo: el juego sí tiene sus pedazos de destrucción, aislados, pero los tiene). Beatbuddy también consta de algunos acertijos de velocidad y movimiento los cuáles, bueno, pueden tomar un par de intentos y podrían interrumpir el flujo, pero nada grave.

¿Recomiendo Beatbuddy? Simón, es un juego hermosamente detallado y su vida musical es pura gozadera. No tiene una gran historia, algunos diálogos están chafones, pero querrás explorar su fascinante mundo acuático y sus escenarios estridentes.

Мы играем за эфирное создание по имени Beatbuddy (или как его локализовали в описании - Ритмобрат), которое мирно живет себе в стране музыки Симфонии. Все бы хорошо,  если бы злой принц Маэстро не вздумал прибрать всю музыку к своим рукам. Его коварный план включает в себя похищение Гармонии и диктатуру своей собственной музыки.
Разумеется, Beatbuddy не может допустить такого кошмара и пускается в опасное путешествие.
Геймплейно эта игра представляет собой аркаду. На протяжении шести уровней, разбитых на пять глав каждый, нам предстоит проходить лабиринты решать загадки, сражаться с врагами и даже отбивать ударами ритм. Все четные главы представляют собой покатушки на странном батискафоподобном аппарате с возможностью пострелять. Это позволяет разнообразить и без того, в принципе, нескучную игру.
Но самое главное, самое чудесно и потрясающее здесь - это графика и звук. Все уровни, каждый фон, каждая детаь нарисованы вручную. Смотреть на эту игру одно удовольствие. Яркие, детализированные локации словно затягивают тебя и погружают в атмосферу Симфонии. Немало этому способствует и саундтрек, которые с его неизменными битами и легкими, невесомыми мелодиями.

The soundtrack is superb, the dialogues blend in perfectly with it (some of them are not words at all, but beatboxes that go along with the music).
Story is nice, simple and interesting, not pretentious at all (unlike some games that try too hard hard in this aspect and end up failing miserably).
Controls are good. On rare occasions t might be a bit difficult to execute some moves, but I found it so rare that I can never say the controls are bad. It plays well both on a keyboard+mouse and on a controller.
Graphics are gorgeous, really well done.
You can see the devs put their heart in this game, everything has that extra tounch on it, like the sounds, graphics and dialogues.

Unfortunately, Beatbuddy's gameplay is not as great as its aesthetics. It felt like a chore to play. The puzzles were tedious and weren't mentally challenging at all; that's basically the majority of the game (from what I played). The controls on a gamepad are passable, but the movement is floaty and I never felt like I was in total control. The music aspect, while a fun concept, ultimately hindered movement (especially while in control of the submarine), and felt more like a gimmick more than anything else. Timing button presses to move to the beat was rewarding, but often times you went too fast for the camera to catch up, resulting in Beatbuddy hugging the edges of the screen constantly and being unable to see the dangers that lie ahead.

3 hours in, I managed to softlock the game by simply dying. I restarted at a checkpoint, and the bass drum plant that I needed to break a wall to progress wasn't working, and there was no way to backtrack.

Naja auf jeden Fall ist Beatbuddy so was ähnliches wie ein Platformer nur eben, man schwimmt. Und das ist ziemlich cool gemacht.
Fans von Hardcoreplatformer werden hier enttäuscht, denn der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist moderat und nur ganz gegen Ende gibt es ein paar etwas herausforderndere Stellen, aber auch die sind nach einigen Versuchen und dank der fairen Speicherpunkte gemeistert.
Das Spiel dient mit seiner sanften Herausforderung, der coolen Musik und dem wunderbaren Stil v.a. eine eher relaxteren Partie. Für mich war Beadbuddy ideal zur Entspannung auf dem Sofa.

Fazit: Wer gemütlich eine Runde zocken möchte zur Erholung ist bei Beatbuddy perfekt aufgehoben.

优点
+BGM不错，适合喜欢节奏感强的音乐的人，节拍也在不同的细节上配合了游戏的进程
+解谜不难，节奏感不差的话不难通关，不是很卡操作
+游戏的手感与BGM配合还不错，踩在拍子上会比较带感

缺点
-过于中规中矩，不论在节奏、关卡、画面还是操作手感方面都只能给7分左右，没有特别优秀的部分，有些可惜了设定
-奖励机制略弱，只能收集水晶用来解锁EXTRA，对于不少追求刺激的玩家来说缺乏爽点
-惩罚的表现力也略弱，玩家撞到会扣血的尖刺之类的东西时会红屏但画面震动很不明显，角色也没有明显的击退一类的动作效果，让人感觉好像轻飘飘就死了，有点失衡

В первый раз я сталкиваюсь с музыкальной игрой, в которой музыка выступает в качестве элемента геймплея, а не только как фон и усилитель атмосферы. И конечно же в самой игре очень сильные композиции, которые сопровождают вас на протяжении уровня, однако, если задерживаться на уровне больше 40 минут, то уже начинает надоедать, что ещё удивительно, у каждого героя есть своя музыкальная тема, такое я вообще вижу, точнее слышу, впервые, пусть они не сильно интересные, но композиции в некой шуточной форме отражают характеры действующих лиц.

Сюжет здесь сказочный и простой, к сожалению, каких-то неожиданных поворотов игра не принесёт.

Beatbuddy : Tale of the Guardians.

Beatbuddy : Tale of the guardians is an unremarkable game. A game where the soundtrack seems to be the only saving grace.  Usually, I like games like beatbuddy where there are some good puzzles, an interesting character, a good premise, tight controls and then a fabulous soundtrack to accompany it. But Beatbuddy tries to carry the whole title on the soundtrack. 

Gameplay
You play as Beatbuddy, who awakes from his sleep and then embarks on a quest to save his own immortality and his companions. You move to the sound of the beats that are present in an underwater world. The controls “feel” clunky even though they are not. As beatbuddy moves underwater, you can sense a slow movement scheme where you want to move him faster. The puzzles in the title are fairly easy and present little challenge.  The game is also very repetitive in nature.
Visuals
Beatbuddy : Tale of the guardians features hand painted levels which are gorgeous to look at. Though there isn’t much variety in the environment so after sometime, they begin to look stale. In the start though, it is a joy to transverse through these levels. The level design is pretty decent but not excellent. Overall, in visuals Beatbuddy looks good without having much variety.
Soundtrack
Soundtrack is the meat of the Beatbuddy: Tale of the guardians. The music kicks in depending on the mood and never lets go. As I said, you can’t carry a game on the soundtrack itself, so as you play Beatbuddy further, your only focus remains on the soundtrack which then ruins the mood itself. Even then, the soundtrack in Beatbuddy is excellent to say the least.
The Verdict
Beatbuddy is a wholly unremarkable game. Repetitive, Bland, Uninteresting are a  few words that can be used to describe it. I couldn’t bring myself to finish the game, as it felt so tedious to play through it. But if you want to give Beatbuddy; Tale of the guardians a try, wait for a sale as paying full price for this game will disappoint you to say the least.

音楽を全体のデザインに取り込んでいて、
キャラクターの行動や仕掛けのオンオフとBGMとの連動だったり

このゲームはリズム、パズル、アクションの属性を含んでいるが
リズムとアクションの融合が上手くいっておらず爽快感に欠け、
また、パズル、アクションを単体で見ても少々退屈だと感じた

せっかくノリの良いBGMでステップを踏むようなダッシュが出来るのに
マップは細い道が多く複雑で、すぐ壁のデコボコや敵キャラにぶつかって

HOWEVER, when the game is working fine, it's ridiculously good fun. A really unique play mechanism with some puzzles having a nice and challenging level of difficulty. They've nailed the difficulty curve.

Its standard price is £6.99 ($9.99 US I think?) which is *probably* worth it due to the amount of fun I've got out of it.

Felt very run of the mill. It's not awful or bad even, it's just a way to pass a few hours I guess. But there are more or less objectively better ways to do that (like I'm sorry, I understand that it's opinion but I really think that if you're a person that's been playing video games for any semi-significant length of time at all, you will think this is very generic--I think that's a fairly reasonable assumption to make). The game just doesn't feel like it has any identity or reason for existence beyond ""another indie 2D platformer/puzzle game in a sea of indie 2D platformer/puzzle games"".

Its underwater so you're not tethered to the ground in the 2D space. Has some strong music (I mean it's called Beatbuddy and it's sorta music-themed in concept so the music is fairly varied and not bad). 6 Levels, about 40-60m each. Really not challenging at all, even near the end as the difficulty ramped up, everything was fairly easy. Honestly, any difficulty or annoyance came almost entirely from the annoyingly floaty controls (I used mouse option, there are ""Keyboard"" and ""Gamepad""  options as well. It's never bad enough to hinder progress though, as the difficulty isn't high at all as mentioned for it to become a massive headache. The ""puzzles"" are all very on-rails, you don't have to think, it's just sorta ""pull lever, push crate"" (figuratively). A lot of repeating puzzle pieces just thrown together in different ways throughout the game, more pieces as you go further.

The game seems to be into this idea that the beat of the music tracks in each of its level is synchronized to various environmental elements and mechanics of its puzzles, and while this might be technically true (i.e., an object you can interact with that serves as like a bounce-pad is pulsating to the beat), in practice I never found myself actually concerned with using that to help me *play the game*, which it sort of advertises as a selling point, but also via it's early tutorial. This might be somewhat subjective, as maybe other people would use that more as a play tool, but I found it far easier to just ignore all that and use visual cues as in any other game (i.e. if there are like spikes that drop and raise, even if they ""cycle"" with the song, it's easier to just watch the spikes and then time your passage...).

Graphics are uh, fine. Somewhat pretty , levels look repetitive (similar art assets I mean) but they all sort of have a cartoony stylization. Really nothing eye-popping, definitely far from the most beautiful 2D game I've seen, recently or otherwise. Look at some screenshots to judge of course.

I encountered a bug in Level 5 , where upon going through a door and the camera starting to zoom out on the environment after a certain puzzle, the client crashed literally every time (Unity engine error). Was not a 1-time thing, always hapspened as I moved the character through this point. After looking around and finding no solution, I verified game cache and that seemed to work. Notably, the game hitched and stuttered , but didn't crash at that point still. 

Also , the game has no v-sync option, v-sync force doesn't work via Nvidia control panel. I'm running a GTX 770, and it was basically just eating the card to run at like 1000+ frames per second (no, that's not a zero too many. Over 1 thousand frames. Basically if you have a dedicated gpu of any description, beware). Was incredibly annoying, and I ended up artificially capping the frame rate with RivaTuner. Which caused the game to occassionally experience some weird stuttering. Sort of amateurish that there's no Vysync option tbh, or anything else that'd solve that issue.

If you skip this title, you're not missing much. I don't feel like my time was wasted, but there are more interesting games out there that I can't say pick this one up.

I'm only giving it a thumbs-down because I don't ESPECIALLY recommend it. If there were a more neutral option I'd give it. It's not an involving game, so if you need that then it might suit you.

Its one of the better ones Ive found in a rhythm game, and I like how they incorporated it into the actual gameplay and environment. I liked having to time my hits to break through bubbles or to break those flower things in the later levels. I can see how some people might get irritated with it though because the game is set underwater, and you have a bit of lag/delay. It isnt too bad to get used to though.

Graphics were pretty nice too. I loved the animations, especially the idle ones. The environment was a little same-y after awhile (lot of recoloring it seemed like), but still gorgeous. 

Controls (especially vehicle ones) werent my favorite, but luckily they dont stick you in the bubble car very often. Trying to actually time the speed boost in the vehicle was a bit irritating, but holding the right click seemed to do it automatically, so I cant complain too much. 

The puzzles themselves werent too bad. None of them were overly complicated or frustrating, but some did get a little repetitive in the earlier levels. Still pretty enjoyable though.

The story is one of the weaker parts of the game. It isnt the strongest story out there, and the characters arent very memorable. Personally, I think the gameplay more than makes up for the weak story though.

Its different, which is nice to see with so many puzzle platformers out there. The controls take getting used to, but once you do it plays very well.

I disagree.  This is more of a bullet hell rhythm hybrid.

There isn't much in form of a story, sadly, but what's there is enough to at least give a sense of purpose and the characters created are rather colorful and entertaining to view/interact with.

This is more of a relaxing/casual game than anything, so keep that in mind.

Beatbuddy is, mostly, a rhythm game before everything else. Of course you have some puzzles, you have some exploration, action, even some auto-scrolling... plus, regarding how you're playing, it can be a point'n click, and that is quite funny, I love it that way. You can choose between gamepad / keyboard or mouse. Not keyboard AND mouse, but keyboard OR mouse.

So yes, it's a rhythm game. You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.

Because what I like is this kind of ""flow"" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're ""in"". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.

Pros:
- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)
- easy controlling
- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?

Cons:
- not really hard
- low replay value

Desde luego no podemos negar que este juego destaca principalmente por su estética y su apartado musical, los cuales, para mi gusto están sorprendentemente bien cuidados.
En cuanto a jugabilidad, BeatBuddy cuenta con unos controles muy simples y cómodos para jugar con mando, y responde perfectamete en todo momento. Esto, unido a unas mecánicas simples y a una dificultad bastante baja, hacen de BeatBuddy un juego sencillo y fácil de jugar.
Tanta sencillez, tanto en mecánicas como en dificultad podría convertirlo en un juego repetitivo y tedioso, de no ser por su corta duración y su variedad de escenarios. 
BeatBuddy consta de 6 niveles temáticos de 1h aproximada de duración cada uno, en los que alternaremos entre el control de Beat y su nave, lo que aporta un poco de variedad en la forma de juego. Durante estos 6 niveles, dará tiempo de sobra a que se desarrolle la historia, el punto más flojo de este juego para mi gusto: Eres uno de los 3 guardianes de la música, que despiertan cuando el príncipe intenta controlar todo su poder, y debes frustrar sus planes. 

En definitiva, estamos frente a un juego con un gameplay sencillo, de corta duración e historia simple, aunque fresco y novedoso a la vez, con una estética y música que conjuntan a la perfección, consiguiendo una inmersión total en el mismo que te dejará con muy buen sabor de boca.

Let’s get rocking (and rightly so with this one).

The Good

To be honest, I hadn’t even heard of this game until it came with last week’s Humble Bundle, but am I glad that it came in that glorious bundle of games. Beatbuddy is easily one of the most satisfying games I have ever played and an multiple levels at that. The whole game is, quite literally, moving to the beat. Do you have any idea how good that feels?

Not only was the whole game keeping rhythm, the music was excellent. I’m personally a big fan of Parov Stellar, so, when I found out about that contribution to the soundtrack, I was pretty stoked. Every level features a different song from a different artist, but manages to keep the same flow.

The design in Beatbuddy is simply marvelous (for the most part). It’s rare to see such a creative game in terms of world building and (especially) naming things cleverly.

The Bad

I’ve got nothing bad to say about this one, sorry.

The Meh

There are some parts of the game where it becomes overly difficult to maneuver with your character. It’s not a huge problem or anything (and maybe I just suck), but it can be quite frustrating.

Verdict: Yea

You have absolutely zero reasons not be playing this game within the next week or so. If you’ve been looking for something new and something far different than most platformers, Beatbuddy is the game for you. You can find it here on Steam if you’re interested (and you should be). It may end up on Humble Bundle’s End of Summer Sale too so keep an eye on that. As always, thanks for reading.",1441172643,1441172643,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Everything around you moves to the beat of the music. Even your own vehicle gets a speed boost every other beat. 

This all comes together to make a game that *usually* feels great to play. While the developers have obviously put a lot of thought into designing each level, there are still segments that are simply not fun to play. In many situations, you will find yourself punished and killed for making a wrong decision in a fast-paced segment. This happens often enough and comes with a large enough punishment that it really does detract from the gameplay.

It feels like this problem comes from over-attachment to problematic gameplay elements. For example, throughout the game, there are these ""music sources"" which are unstable and explode after you've held them long enough. You have to deliver these sources to an appropriate receptacle or risk restarting the segment. While having segments like this helps the game from feeling too same-y, it's a bad choice and should have been scrapped or re-imagined.

To be honest, though, these flaws are the kind of thing that most games have. It might have a few more of them than average, but they only stand out because they occasionally disrupt the magical experience that this game has to offer. Despite my occasional frustration, I finished this game in a single sitting and came away delighted that I'd put in the time. I would recommend this game to anyone who's at all interested by the trailer. Just don't expect it to be perfectly polished.

Bugs suchte ich vergeblich, die Steuerung per X360-Controller ist weitaus besser als mit Tastatur/Maus.

Gesamtbewertung: 80/100

GAMEPLAY: Sehr flüssige, eingehende Steuerung, die bei dieser Spiellänge aber nicht zu simpel und einschränkend wirkt. [90/100]

STORY: Süße, kurze Story, welche perfekt in den Spielfluß eingebaut ist. Einen Blockbusters darf man natürlich nicht erwarten, doch auf Indie-Niveau absolut in Ordnung. [80/100]

GRAFIK: Sehr netter Grafikstil, keine Unschönheiten, die Produktbeschreibung verspricht nicht zu viel! Auch die Animationen des Beatbuddy sehen cool aus. Allerdings finde ich den Look der Menüs abstoßend [90/100]

SOUND: Die rhythmische Musik ist definitiv das Kernelement dieses Titels. Die Musik ist immer auf die derzeitige Spielgeschwindigkeit abgestimmt (oder anders herum :D ) und ist eingängig. Allerdings findet sich hier keine neue 'Star-Wars-Musik', die sich jedermann nach dem ersten Hören merken kann; auch nicht im Soundtrack. Somit: [85/100]

=> Alles in allem ein nettes Indie-Game mit einer für dieses Spielprinzip genau rcihtigen Länge und netten Ideen. Sehr guter Zeitvertreib -> [80/100]",1438894084,1438894084,True,6,1,0.621481418609619141,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The story isn't something to write about as I felt there really wasn't a story. The Deus Ex Machina at the end really ruined anything that was going on in the game and then it just suddenly ends. The story feels tacked on and hardly there. 

The Soundtrack is nice but doesn't really compliment the game in any way. It's a very Electro Swing heavy OST by some big names but overall I felt that it's more of an advertisement for the artists than anything. 

Overall this game is very mediocre. It isn't really fun and only held my attention for the first couple levels. The last levels just left me dissatisfied and overall perturbed when I completed the game. This game is okay, but there are pleanty of better games available.

In der comichaften zweidimensionalen Unterwasserwelt bewegt sich alles zum Bass der Musik. Die Hindernisse, die Gegner und bald schon man selbst.

Die Entwickler legen offensichtlich großen Wert auf [b]Innovationen im Gameplay[/b]. Entsprechend knapp haben Sie die Geschichte und die Spielwelt gehalten. Böser Prinz entführt Schwester um alle Musik zu kontrollieren. Der Spielheld muss das verhindern. Mit Blick auf das Gameplay ist die durch Einblendung von Sprechblasen erzählte Geschichte mehr als ausreichend. Der Fokus liegt auf dem Spielgefühl.

Und das begeistert, jedenfalls zu Anfang. Was in anderen Spielen die Hand-Auge-Koordination ist, ist bei Beatbuddy die [b]Hand-Gehör-Koordination[/b]. Schnell lernt man, die Entwicklung der Spielwelt mit Hilfe des eigenen Gehörs vorauszuahnen und das eigene Spiel daran anzupassen. Durchschwimmt die Spielfigur etwa eine knifflige Passage, welche sich nur zu bestimmten Rhythmen öffnet, so muss sie den richtigen Zeitpunkt erahnen. Das ist [b]ausgesprochen innovativ[/b] und macht gerade zu Anfang sehr viel Spaß.

Umso bedauerlicher ist, dass die Entwickler weder das Innovationstempo, noch das Musikkonzept konsequent durchhalten. Zum einen beschränkt sich die Auswirkung der Musik auf die Spielwelt im Grunde auf den Bass. Und der ist binär. An. Und dann Aus. An. Aus. Da wäre so viel mehr möglich gewesen, selbst wenn man nur Takt und Bass genommen hätte. Zum anderen driftet das Spiel [b]mit fortschreitender Entwicklung wieder ins Koventionelle[/b] ab. Irgendwann muss sich der Spieler mit Parasiten rumschlagen, denen die sonst so harmonische Welt egal ist. Sie greifen einfach immer an, ohne Rücksicht auf den Beat. An vielen anderen Stellen gerät das Spiel einfach zur Geschicklichkeitsübung, ohne dass die Musik eine Rolle spielt. 

Weniger begeisternd ist auch das Leveldesign. Obwohl die Welt des Beatbuddys [b]optisch durchaus schön anzusehen[/b] ist, ist die zunehmende Labyrinthartigkeit der Level doch nur vorgetäuscht. Tatsächlich bleiben sie linear, die Wegfindung minimal und ein ganz erheblicher Teil besteht nur im Durchschwimmen kniffliger Passagen. Ganz besonders markant ist aber, dass die immer [b]gleichen Konzepte permament wiederholt[/b] werden. Sei es nun eine Art Wagen, der in Parasitenpassagen durch die Reihen des Gegners schlüpft. Die Spielfigur, die sich über Spiegel gegen Korallen schießen lässt, damit diese zerplatzen und den weg frei geben. Oder die schießenden Schnecken, die sich in puncto Nervigkeit mit schwimmenden stachlichen Amöben abwechseln. In den ersten zwei Leveln ist alles neu und innovativ. Aber dann kommt leider nur noch wenig. 

Immerhin, und wie sollte es anders sein, gelingt den Entwicklern eine [b]tolle musikalische Unterstützung[/b]. Die elektronischen Klänge mit zum Teil ambitioniertem wortlosen Gesang sind jedoch absolut gelungen. Was die Spielmusik angeht läuft dieses Indiegame einfach mal AAA-Titeln den Rang ab. Allein dafür lohnt Beatbuddy. 

Da verzeiht man auch den [b]recht einfachen Schwierigkeitsgrad.[/b] Von Beginn an ist das Spiel keine Herausforderung, nicht einmal für Casualgamer. Wenige Passagen fordern ab und an ein ausgesprochen schnelles Handeln, aber abseits dessen ist das Spiel kaum Herausforderung.

Im Ergebnis bietet Beatbuddy vor allem eins: [b]Innovation[/b], was das Spielgefühl angeht. Das das nicht durchgehalten wird, bleibt verziehen. Gerade die Spielmusik gibt des Spiel einen [b]Indiecharme[/b], der einem einfach ein gutes Gefühl gibt.

Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians ha sido una sorpresa absoluta. Obtenido de ""rebote"" a partir de un blundle hace un par de años parecía que este juego iba a ser uno de esos que se tienen y nunca se juegan. Sin embargo, también sucede que a veces jugamos a algo ""por probar"" y nos quedamos maravillados. Este es el caso de este juego.

Beatbuddy es un juego que se desarrolla en un fondo marino donde tendremos que salvarlo de un malvado principe que quiere hacerse con la música. El argumento es realmente trivial y queda en un segundo plano cuando comenzamos a jugar, ya que sin lugar a dudas lo más destacable de este juego es su impresionante música. 

Tal es así que mientras jugamos vamos acompañando nuestros movimientos con la múscia que suena, no porque nos obliguen, sino porque el ritmo es realmente excelente. Música funky, electrónica y varias notas de jazz y blues hacen que desplazarnos por el fondo del mar sea realmente espectacular.

Su aspecto gráfico, por otro lado, es fabuloso. Es una auténtica maravilla ver los paisajes, enemigos, y elementos que configuran los puzles para darse cuenta del gran trabajo que han realizado los desarrolladores. Colores vivos, dinámicos y con una gran personalidad.

En su aspecto puramente jugable, el juego es una mezcla de puzles, arcade y shoot 'em up, dependiendo del nivel, y todo, como es normal, irá complicándose mientras más avanzamos. Aún así, su dificultad no es demasiado elevada, y aunque moriremos en numerosas ocasiones, hay gran cantidad de puntos de control que nos permitirán seguir cerca de donde lo dejamos.

El control, jugado con mando, es realmente fabuloso y responde perfectamente a las órdenes dadas muy rápidamente, algo fundamental ya que muchas veces habrá que pasar por recobecos en poco tiempo mientras nos persigue algún monstruo marino o un artilugio mortal.

La duración del juego no es demasiado larga, unas 5-6 horas como mucho, y su rejugabilidad es bastante limitada, a no ser que volvamos a jugar por disfrutar de la música nuevamente mientras jugamos. Este aspecto es el más limitado del juego, pero la experiencia que te deja al acabarlo es muy positiva.

En resumen, Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians es una pequeña maravilla que sin duda encantará a todos los amantes de la buena música, los puzles y el arcade frenético. Muy recomendable.",1428461332,1545168265,True,19,1,0.6923828125,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Don't let the look fool you, this game is kinda tough! If you're good with timing your moves right, it may not be, but if you're a little impatient sometimes, it can turn into a really rough playthrough. That being said, it's a fun, challenging game with some cool little puzzles as a result. The story's not much to write home about, but the art style and music are the biggest highlights of this game. 

The developers managed to bring together a variety of musicians of all sorts (including Austin Wintory of Banner Saga and Journey fame), giving each level a nice, distinct beat to match the changing environments and increasing difficulty. Even more impressive is that the sound effects of the various objects in the game complement each song, making more challenging sections even more enjoyable as you experience the full form of the background track. 

The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward swimming about, grabbing objects to open doors, swiping at enemies to defeat them or to hit switches in the environment. However, much of it is interwoven with following the rhythm of certain obstacles to solve puzzles by fitting into enemy movements and/or creating openings in moving obstacles to roll with the flow to get further along. It's not hard to figure out, but getting it just right can take a few tries, and it's pretty clever design to match with the overall theme of music embedded in the game from the soundtrack to the land of Symphonia's own little mythos. 

If you want a lighthearted, charming experience, that doesn't over stay its welcome too long, I highly recommend checking this out. It's lots of fun, though I might recommend a controller. =)",1425717567,1425717567,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Also Beatbuddy ist aus meiner Sicht wohl eines der besseren Indies, die man hier auf Steam findet. Es ist nicht ganz eine Indie Perle, wie ich es gerne nenne aber nahe dran.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Gameplaytechnisch bietet das Spiel einen angenehmen Aufbau. Der Spieler und Beatbuddy lernen nach und nach ein paar kleinere Fähigkeiten und auch Abwechslung ist geboten. Jedoch können einzelne Passagen doch recht langwierig werden und etwas Eintönigkeit kommt auf. Jedes Level wird getauscht ob wir rumschwimmen oder mit dem Gefährt fahren. Die Rätsel sind durchaus machbar, manchmal musste ich ein wenig überlegen aber im Grunde sind sie eher einfach. Genau wie die Rätsel ist das Spiel relativ Casual gehalten: Gegner sind leicht zu erledigen und ich bin nicht oft gestorben, wobei dann auch die Checkpoints sehr angenehm gesetzt sind. Das Einzige, was man finden und sammeln kann, sind die Kristalle. Diese dienen aber nicht irgendwelchen Aufwertungen, sondern jeglich Freischaltungen von ein paar Bildern, wie das Spiel programmiert wurde. Waren auch nen paar lustige Bilder dabei ;)

[b]Story[/b]
Die Story ist eher mäßig bis schwach. Man wacht auf, trifft ein paar Charaktere (glaube 6 im ganzen Spiel) und es kommen nur wenig Dialoge. Die sind jedoch recht schlicht gehalten aber dennoch recht amüsant geschrieben. Aber die Story ist ja hier wieso nicht das Hauptaugenmerk.

[b]Musik[/b]
Die Musik ist wohl das Wichtigste an Beatbuddy. Viele Gegner und Gegenstäne im Spiel verursachen eigene Geräusche und dadurch kann man die Musik ein wenig kontrollieren. Zudem wechselt auch die Hauptmelodie des öfteren in den verschiedenen Kapiteln.

[b]Grafik[/b]
Die Grafik ist ungewöhnlich, gut und durch den ""Zeichenstil"" wirkt das Spiel wesentlich einladender und symphatischer.

[b]Fazit[/b] 
Leider ist Beatbuddy eher kurz geraten mit etwa 5 Stunden Spielzeit, man soll sogar laut Erfolg das Spiel innerhalb von 3 Stunden abschließen können. Dennoch macht die Musik Laune und man Beatbuddy wunderbar relaxt mit einem Controller vom Sofa/Bett aus spielen. Es ist trotz der kurzen Spielzeit ein lustiges Spiel gewesen und ich kann es nur empfehlen :)

本作是工作室花了4年时间做的节奏动作冒险游戏，主人公是一只蓝色的的软体动物，在类似海底的音乐世界里为保护世界和大Boss王子进行战斗。游戏过程主要是操纵主人公Beatbuddy 和潜水艇在6 个大关卡里穿梭，所谓的节奏元素也主要集中在移动和战斗方式上。每个大关都有一首主题BGM，而所有敌人和机关的运作都遵守着BGM的节奏，这一点是本作比较独特的地方。

优点：
[list]
    [*]画面。画风就是截图中的厚涂手绘风，应该可以算是颜色鲜艳、角色可爱。不同的场景有自己不同的主色调和特色，细节也非常丰富和生活化；角色们像果冻一样，感觉手感应该不错，出周边应该能火。
    [*]音乐。作为节奏游戏，音乐太差说不过去啊……本作的音乐是电子风，和整个游戏搭配的非常好；而且节奏感很强，不会让玩家在游戏过程中为此而卡关。本作的BGM已在美帝水果店上架，不过没有美帝水果店账号的只能望洋兴叹了……
P.S.现在已有原声DLC
    [*]解谜：本作的解谜不算很难，虽然会死个几次不过还算轻松，检查点的设置也相当贴心；谜题设置也算多样，而且主角也会随着剧情发展学到新能力，唯一的问题就是后期有点模式化，而且感觉难度变化不大，缺乏挑战性。
[/list]

缺点：
[list]
    [*]剧情。本作剧情流程不长，通关大约也就2-4小时，即使刷个全成就也就5h不到。剧情本身只能说是比没有强点，由于过场全是对话，所以对不仔细看动画的玩家而言就是各种过关……相信很多玩家到最后也就是知道王子是Boss，而且最后通关通的莫名其妙，虽然蛮搞笑的……
    [*]操作。虽然本作支持鼠标键盘+手柄，但不支持混合操作，因此实际上游戏过程相当难受（鼠标党表示手疼= =）；而且游戏中的各种操作也得顺着节奏走，偶尔会产生死活动不了 or 半天踩不到点的情况。
    [*]其它。本作说实话解谜的提示给的相对不足，笔者之前在第一大关卡关了，直到看了别的玩家的攻略才发现那关要坐潜水艇……另外，大部分差评里提到了严重的 Bug 问题，虽然我没碰到什么Bug，但是游戏有时候会出现卡慢现象。

First off, the main character and his friend are awesome. Little things like leaving him to stand still prompt him to choose one of multiple dance moves that align to the beat, are a nice touch. There is some awesome music and having gameplay and mechanics align with the music and beat are a new and inventive touch. Some of the middle levels lose the quality music and just seem like opera music that doesn't really fit the level and the gameplay doesn't rely as much on it which is disappointing. Also multiple different beats and songs per level would have been better than just one. Problems are a lack of difference as levels, as each one looks and feels the exact same. Another problem is the game uses the same few puzzle, enemies, and game mechanics for the entire game, leading to way too much repeition. There are also numerous reported bugs, some of which you must restart the entire level over again for, such as I had to, which can lead to 20-30 minutes of lost time. Seeing as how the game has been out a while not as many bugs should persist as you see reported on the message boards. The ending is anticlimactic. More of the game should have been spent platforming/fighting enemies etc as opposed to just breaking barriers which bouncers and moving gateway triggers. The levels are big and have multiple branching paths which can be confusing because you have to spend way too much time solving similar puzzles. Some levels such as running from something, or guiding the way for someone, break up the monotony, but are too few and far between. I would there would have been more of those different type of levels. Each level boils down to using the ship and the guy, each of which feels like the last time you used them. Still a fun game and inventive way to incorporate music into it all. Also there is the cuteness factor. 7.5/10",1420164387,1420164387,True,7,0,0.529657661914825439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The level of adorableness of this game is too damn high. So let's take it from the top.

The environment is underwater. The beautifully made areas are hand painted, and filled with rock formations, plants, and cute sea creatures. It is all very pleasing to the eye, and generally forces me to smile throughout the whole experience. Also, the environment is not motionless, it is all vibrant, pulsating, bouncing, and swinging to the soundtrack.

The main character is called Beat Buddy. It's a small, blue, bubbly creature with big eyes, and... earphones. Whenever you stop to figure out a puzzle, he floats in the water bouncing his head and swinging his arm, like a real DJ. Did I mention it is adorable?

The game is basically an action-adventure with loads of puzzles, all focused around the music playing in the background. Each obstacle, element, creature has it's own unique sound which always incorporates nicely with the music, creating a beautiful, energetic soundtrack. From jazzy oldschool sounds, through clubby electronic, and even funky-rocky sounds.

While you can solve any puzzle and go through any obstacle without even turning the sound on, listetning to the soundtrack gives you an advantage. The beat, the sounds actually give you small tips and clues, when and how you should move to go through a challenge effortlessly.

The puzzles slowly progress from absolutely obvious to very complicated. It requires logical thinking, timing, and a good ear.

For me, the game is very relaxing. As I traverse the underwater environment, searching for my friends, hoping to save them.. as I bounce, float, punch my way through complicated labyrinths, I feel myself unwind. The music, the soft but vibrant colours, the sweet personality and feel of the game have a wonderful, positive impact on my mood.

So if you would like something gentle, soothing, and adorable. Something that will make you smile, but will still challenge your gaming skills, try ""Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians"". And don't forget to wear good headphones or turn your speakers up.",1419801033,1419801033,True,3,0,0.542009949684143066,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall? 7/10

If there weren't game breaking bugs, I would most certainly give it an 8/10. A great sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game in the spirit of Donkey Kong under water levels. It's not perfect, nor is it the most in-depth puzzle scroller I have played, however... It's a beautifully executed casual game. The music is enjoyable to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out after listening to it for 10 minutes.

A lot of the controls/environment effects are themed, of course, around the beat of the music... and timing according to that. Though I don't think it adds anything particularly ""unique"" to the game, they implemented it well... and it fits in with the world and story.

Pros:
-Very beautiful game, the hand drawn environments added to my enjoyment.
-It's really fun. When you aren't stuck with a bug.
-Not entirely unique, but it puts a good focus on timing your movements with the beat of the music.

Neutral:
-Controls are a little looser than I would like when interacting with objects, not enough to be a con.
-Puzzles, they aren't too hard.. and they arent too difficult. Very casual. This could be a con or a pro.

Cons:
-Game breaking bugs.

Beatbuddy má neotřelý námět a herní mechanismus. Nemůžu říct, že je to vyloženě špatná hra, ale  mě nesedla... Přitom to vypadá jako dobrý nápad. Jednotlivá kola se točí kolem jedné skladby a vy se budete točit taky, protože vám nic jiného nezbyde:-) Podle rytmu hudby se totiž pohybují nepřátelé a pasti. Tohle spojení přináší (ne)evidentní problém - pokud se vám nebude líbit styl hudby a to, že jedno kolo trvá kolem hodiny, neodnesete si úplně nejlepší dojem. Což se stalo mě. 

Beatbuddy je pořád celkem hezká hra. Ručně malované prostředí vypadá na nezávislý titul dost dobře a je vidět kolik práce do něj autoři vložili. Ovládání myší funguje celkem slušně, čas od času sice sednete do ponorky, která se pohybuje tak nějak těžkopádně, ale za tím bych viděl spíš záměr, než chybu. 

V recenzích si lidé čas od času stěžují na bugy, ale já si nevzpomínám, že bych na nějaký narazil. To už se mi častěji stalo, že jsem tak nějak nepochopil záměr autorů a nevěděl co dělat. 

Hru jsem měl rozehranou přes rok (mimochodem nedávno byl vydán patch, který vylepšil třeba menu - autoři se evidentně pořád snaží). Nakonec jsem se příměl se k ní vrátit a dohrát jí, ale nějak to nebylo ono.

The art style with its bright colors is also easy on the eyes, but the music certainly is the game's strongest point. I terribly suck at music games, but here I kept bobbing my head to the rhythm here out of sheer enjoyment of the tunes. This, of course, helps a lot in playing as you benefit from doing certain actions within a rhythm.
But anybody entirely unable of keeping a steady rhythm needs not to fret either, as the game is rather forgiving.

If I had to criticize anything, it would be the fact that it's entirely possible to miss collectibles on your first trip through a stage. Take the wrong turn, and you can't go back. Sure, that's a minor complaint, but for a completionist like myself, it can be a bit jarring as you need to replay a stage at least once to grab all trinkets and possibly once more to finish a stage in as little time as possible for the ""beat the game in under x hours"" achievement.

Also, the controls feel wonky at times, but you get used to it, and in no time you'll swiftly sway though the ocean.

On the other hand game isn´t fun. It is confusing in parts: beautiful paintings doesn´t show you your way through in some places. Although it is kind of easy it fails to learn you something about the environment: like that beautiful yellow crystals are bad. They looks like purple/pink one but these will kill you.

Meine Review zu Gamebudy:

Allgemeines:
Ihr spielt in einer Unterwasserwelt, in der die Musik alles beherrscht. Euren Charakter seht ihr hierbei in ""Super Mario""-Manier von der Seite. 

Grafik:
Oft zurecht gelobt. Die Grafik von Beatbuddy ist wunderschön designt und stimmungsvoll.

Die Musik:
Die Musik gefällt mir eigentlich recht gut. Leider habe ich das Gefühl das das eigentliche Konzept, nämlich durch die Musik dem Spiel einen Rhytmus zu geben leicht verfehlt wurde. Oft wir der Flow der Musik durch irgend ein dummes Rätsel unterbrochen.

Steuerung:
Habe ich in einigen Reviews als Minuspunkt gefunden. Ich selber bin mit der Steuerung sehr zufrieden. Man kann das Spiel auch einwandfrei mit einem Controller spielen.

Story:
Leider sehr öde. Die Story regt nicht wirklich zum spielen an. Es geht, wie so häufig um die Rettung der Welt.

Spielspaß:
Langzeitmotivation bietet das Spiel eher nicht. Dafür spiele ich es immer gerne wenn ich mal noch 20 Minuten Zeit habe. 

Pros&Cons:
+ Grafik
+ Steuerung
+ Spielspaß
- Konzept
- Story
- Schwierigkeitsgrad

FAQ:
Kann ich das Spiel mit Controller spielen?
- Ja!

Wie lange sitzt man an dem Spiel?
- Vielleicht 4 Stunden. Es hat 5 Level mit je 5 Kapiteln.

Was hast du gezahl?
- Ich hatte das Spiel in einem HumbleBundle. Ein guter Preis sind 2€.

Warum empfiehlst du das Spiel?
- Zum Einen: Die Entwickler sind schon sehr sympathisch. Sie haben ein paar Making-Of Bilder beigelegt und man merkt wie viel Herzblut in Beatbuddy steckt. Zum Zweiten: Es macht in kurzen schüben immer wieder Spaß. 

Fazit:
Beatbuddy ist ein klasse Spiel für zwischendurch. Aber der Metascore von 75/100 ist schon gerechtfertigt.",1410954591,1410954591,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

While it's got a lot going for it, I just can't get past how buggy it is. Although I did manage to complete it, it wasn't without some serious issues. Several times I got stuck in various ways that prevented further progress - sometimes it was a matter of a game event not triggering properly, and sometimes it was due to going some way the game wasn't expecting me to (apparently). I also encountered issues where the controls would just stop working for no reason. Restoring to the last checkpoint sometimes fixes the issue, but this is rarely the case. Most times, there is no choice but to start the level (or entire chapter) from scratch. Do you know how annoying it is to have 30-40 minutes of progress wiped out, have to start over again, and hope you don’t make the same game-breaking mistake again (whatever it was)? Let me tell you - it's really f%@*&g annoying. I ended up having to do that multiple times. And would you believe, as a final bug-ridden cherry on top, the very end of the game also glitched out on me as well? Well, believe it. So on top of all the other frustration I experienced just getting through the game, I didn’t even get to see the full conclusion of the story. 

Now, putting all of that aside, what’s actually good about Beatbuddy? Quite a bit, actually. The hand-drawn layered 2D graphics look great, the controls are responsive, the puzzles are generally well-designed, and the music is decent. And that’s a good thing, because the music plays a large part in the gameplay - the environment works in time with the beat of the music, requiring specific timing to pass obstacles or solve puzzles. The first couple of hours are great, as the basic mechanics are introduced. Unfortunately, it starts to lose its luster a little bit after that, as most of the subsequent puzzles are pretty much variations on things you’ve already done several times. So you might start to get tired of it after a while (or maybe I was just burned out from having to replay several areas). I would estimate the overall playtime to be somewhere around 4-6 hours.

Overall, the game is not bad, and I enjoyed it while it was working properly. The frustration from all of the technical issues I had just ended up being too much for me to give it a full recommendation. If you enjoy action/puzzle sidescrollers, music-themed games, and/or games with pretty 2D artwork, it’s definitely worth a look. Just be aware of the potential issues. I suppose it could very well be possible that you'd encounter no glitches at all… but I doubt it (several posts in the Steam forums seem to corroborate my experience).

The scenes of undersea here aren't dark and quiet but lively and bright. The design of the stages with the concept of the beat sound from objects which are interative and those which aren't have their own styles.
Second, the puzzles here are simple. However, the standard about difficulty of puzzles is different based on players' different gaming experience and the experience they're seeking from thie game. To me, puzzle games don't have to be hard to challenge but simple to relax myself.So, in my opinion, if you don't want to beat it one day after playing several hours but just relax yourself by playing games, it's good for you, too.

Es war allerdings sehr kurz wie die meisten Indiegames, die ich kenne. Die Story war nicht erstklassig, aber in Ordnung. Die musikalische Untermalung insbesondere mit den Beats und Rhythmen, die man teilweise nutzen muss, empfand ich als wirklich innovativ. Die Steuerung ist allerdings gewöhnungsbedürftig.

Pros: 
- Grafik ist hübsch
- Leveldesign (wenngleich die Level unheimlich groß sind)
- Intro und Outro (diese ""Sprache"" fand ich super)
- Musik

Neutral:
- Story (war ok, aber nicht weltbewegend)
- Spielzeit (könnte länger sein, allerdings für ein Indiegame nicht unüblich)
- Steuerung*

Cons:
- Steuerung*

* Ich kann mich nicht endgültig entscheiden. Man schwimmt quasi in diesem Spiel wodurch die Steuerung verzögert ist und die Figur auch gerne mal im Beat noch einen letzten Schwung nach vorne macht, obwohl man sie schon nicht mehr bewegt. Einerseits ist das nervtötend und stört, weil es die Kontrolle verschlechtert. Andererseits passt es zur Athmosphäre und Umgebung des Spiels.

Fazit: Wer sich mit der Steuerung arrangieren kann und 2D-Scroller mag, darf ruhig zugreifen. Ich bin nicht der größte Anhänger dieses Genres und hatte trotzdem meinen Spaß. Insbesondere im Angebot kann man nicht viel falsch machen und man unterstützt einen deutschen Indie-Entwickler.

Beatbuddy spielt sich sehr smooth, tolles Gelegenheitsspiel für zwischendurch. Am besten zu vergleichen mit dem letzten Teil der Raymen Reihe, nur in Beatbuddy ""schwimmen"" wir quasi rum.
Die Musik, auch von bekannten Interpreten wie Parov Stelar, in Beatbuddy ist eine Mischung aus vorgefertigten Tracks Electro/Electroswing/Lounge und vielen Samples, die durch die verschiedenen Mechaniken/Monster/NPCs akutisch mit in die Melodie eingebunden werden. Da gibt es dann zum Beispiel die Snare-crabs - wie die klingen kann man sich denken oder wenn die Texte der NPCs erscheinen läuft ein, im Hintergrund passender, Beatbox. 
 
Ich bin kein großer Fan von Puzzleplattformern, aber Beatbuddy kann ich nur empfehlen - dazu muss man sagen das es genau meinen Musikgeschmack trifft. :)

For the first half hour roughly you'll learn what ""Beat"" can do and how the world works around him. There is some awkward, slightly whimsical story that surrounds everything but it's not always clear what is happening. 
Gameplay is derived from moving around fluidly while creatures and things in the world all move to a beat. This is where I say musically the game shines. At some points you get an almost Fantasia feeling as a selection of sea creatures all make their own music, animating to the beat of the tune for the environment.

The music itself is catchy and immersive. My favorite moments in the game was when I would transition from just playing as Beat to navigating the watercraft vehicle. When this transition occurs, the levels music transitions to a chorus of sorts, making the song pretty powerful.

Unfortunately with all the cool rythmn actions happening, this is where gameplay tends to become awkward or constricted. Often times you'll struggly to effeciently pick up the object you need without spamming the mouse button. It just isn't a clean action, and since it's used heavily, you'll have moments of pure frustration sadly.
Movement is fluid as I mentioned, which once you learn the small nuances is easily adaptable. I was able to navigate almost all regions with ease.

The overall game is good and worth a play certainly, if not just to experience the cool music and beautiful 2d art and subtle animations.

First of all, there's the  story.
In terms of plot you don't really have that much to start with. 
You're in symphonia, a world moved by rythm and music, that is provided by 3 ""buddies"", that wake up when there's any sort of crysis, and you are one of them, then it all gets a bit boring, as you are thrown in the midst of a story without knowing anything about any of the characters, other than there's this bad guy that want's to steal the rythm to himself, and thats pretty much it.
No side quests, no background stories, no explanations, you just start swimming towards you objective, because the dialogues say so. 
the ending is quite disappointing, as the game ends as abruptly as it started, and there are no answers in the end, is just a sort of ""and our heroes did the job, until the next time""
You get rewards if you catch all the gems hidden in each level, but it's mostly sketches and artwork, so You haven't that much replay value in it as for the moment you end the game, you have no remaining objectives or bonus levels that justify replaying the same levels from which you wanted to leave as soon as possible.
then there's my main problem with this title. The gameplay.
You play mostly as buddy, but there's also some parts of certain levels where you control a ship, and shoot bigger enemies. I'll focus on the parts you play ""by feet"" as that's most of the game.
It's not that the gameplay is bad, is just plain old repetitive.
At first, it may seem compelling - i had it on my wishlist for a while, and even tried out the demo first - , swiming in a wonderful underwater-like world, exploring every corner and noticing how everything works along with the beat of the soundtrack. 
And then... you realize you've been listening the same song over and over and over for the whole level, and the past 2 levels. 
And that you've been doing the same thing repeatedly for hours - find a key or a switch, carry it to a gate, smash some shells blocking the way, hitting enemies, and repeat the process minutes later as you'll find a new closed door. You have some cool puzzles, but it's mostly the same sequence i described above.
 You have to do things with the rythm and if you're playing for a relaxing time, you may end up getting frustrated with a parasite you have to hit in a musical order, that you miss because you pressed the button a second too early.
In the end is a fun game, that can get boring a little too fast if you're playing it for the story, but still has a beautiful artwork and interesting soundtrack.So I just finished this one, and I just got the urge to review it.
If I only judged it for the art and soundtrack, I'd give it 8 ou of 10, as the hand drawn scenarios are really beautiful and rich and the soundtrack has some really nice beats, but we also have to consider the gameplay and other aspects of the game, so, I'll stick with a 6.

First of all, there's th story.

In terms of plot you don't really have that much to start with. 

You're in symphonia, a world moved by rythm and music, that is provided by 3 ""buddies"", that wake up when there's any sort of crysis, and you are one of them, then it all gets a bit boring, as you are thrown in the midst of a story without knowing anything about any of the characters, other than there's this bad guy that want's to steal the rythm to himself, and thats pretty much it.

No side quests, no background stories, no explanations, you just start swimming towards you objective, because the dialogues say so. 
the ending is quite disappointing, as the game ends as abruptly as it started, and there are no answers in the end, is just a sort of ""and our heroes did the job, until the next time""

You get rewards if you catch all the gems hidden in each level, but it's mostly sketches and artwork, so You haven't that much replay value in it as for the moment you end the game, you have no remaining objectives or bonus levels that justify replaying the same levels from which you wanted to leave as soon as possible.
then there's my main problem with this title. The gameplay.

You play mostly as buddy, but there's also some parts of certain levels where you control a ship, and shoot bigger enemies. I'll focus on the parts you play ""by feet"" as that's most of the game.
It's not that the gameplay is bad, is just plain old repetitive.

At first, it may seem compelling - i had it on my wishlist for a while, and even tried out the demo first - , swiming in a wonderful underwater-like world, exploring every corner and noticing how everything works along with the beat of the soundtrack. 
And then... you realize you've been listening the same song over and over and over for the whole level, and the past 2 levels. 

And that you've been doing the same thing repeatedly for hours - find a key or a switch, carry it to a gate, smash some shells 
blocking the way, hitting enemies, and repeat the process minutes later as you'll find a new closed door. You have some cool puzzles, but it's mostly the same sequence i described above.
 
You have to do things with the rythm and if you're playing for a relaxing time, you may end up getting frustrated with a parasite you have to hit in a musical order, that you miss because you pressed the button a second too early.


In the end is a fun game, that can get boring a little too fast if you're playing it for the story, but still has a beautiful artwork and interesting soundtrack.

- considerati questi difetti che lo rendono ingiocabile, i produttori non lo hanno mai aggiornato a dovere con dei fix.

Turns out that Windows was the key to enjoying this game.  I loved the art style, the music was awesome, the level design was exceptionally well done especially considering how it could've been extremely easy to get lost (yet I never seemed to), the only issue I really had was the controls.  On the Mac side, the mouse controls were terrible and a 360 controller didn't function properly.  On the Windows side, everything worked great on the controller and it made the game enjoyable since the controls were so tight.  If you only have a Mac, avoid this game.  If you have a PC or dual boot (and have a good controller), it's absolutely worth a buy.


V.1 - I want to like this game.  The music seems cool, the art style is interesting and the concept is a fresh take on the genre, but technical problems (at least for the Mac version) are holding me back.  The game crashes more often than it runs and the menu navigates without fail via 360 controller, only to have none of the buttons work once actually in the game.  Mouse control feels supremely subpar compared to what a gamepad setup would allow.  I'll try this game again on the Windows side later, but as it stands now, I'd pass if on a Mac.",1404079625,1405567378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Verdikt: Beatbuddy je hrou, ktorá na pevnom disku veľmi dlho nezotrvá. Hlavným negatívom hry nie je hracia doba, ale stereotyp a bugy, ktoré znechutia postupne každú sekundu strávenú hraním tejto hry. Pre niektoré bugy je dokonca potrebné reštartovať úroveň a dúfať, že sa opätovne nevyskytnú, aby sa hra dala vôbec dohrať. Krátkosť hry ďalej zdôrazňuje aj absencia MP. Kladne sa dá hodnotiť celkom slušný soundtrack, jednoduché ovládanie a hlavná postavička spolu s jej animáciami. Celkovo je ale Beatbuddy sklamaním.

Vaya por delante que lo más destacable del juego es el aspecto musical. Casi todo elemento del juego emite un sonido a tempo con la melodia del nivel correspondiente, lo que genera pasajes variables que no nos dejarán de sorprender. Los gráficos de los decorados son también de una calidad artística fuera de lo común, tanto que en conjunción con la música convierten a este juego en una obra de arte jugable. La jugabilidad se basa en puzzles y partes de acción en las que es muy importante moverse con sentido del ritmo para superar los obstáculos. Nada insalvable tampoco, es bastante accesible y está plagado de checkpoints, así que la mayor parte del juego será un bello paseo por parajes de fantasia y músicas hipnóticas. Algo bastante chulo es que si recogemos unas gemas que abundan en los niveles, desbloquearemos una cachonda galeria donde los programadores nos explican con mucho humor el largo y dur peregrinaje que supuso la creación del juego, incluyendo numerosos bocetos del desarrollo. De veras, valen la pena.

¿Lo peor de Beatbuddy? Pues que tiene un gameplay interesante, pero pronto se acaban las novedades y todo empieza a ser una repetición cíclica de los mismos elementos barajados con mas mala leche. No pasa nada, no es tan largo como para echar de menos muchas mas cosas, pero llega un momento en que nos damos cuenta de que la idea no da mas de sí.

El aspecto artistico del juego es muy bonito, con un raro ""3D"" en los personajes (no se si se puede considerar 3D) y graficos 2D con distintas capas, haciendo que el mundo cobre vida por si mismo.

La banda sonora es muy buena, es casi el principal motivo por el que adquirir, jugar y disfrutar el juego. Es mas, el propio juego la aprovecha muy bien, jugando con ella a placer, haciendo que muchos de nuestros actos hagan cambiar la musica.

El juego no dura mucho, pero lo suficiente para el dinero que cuesta. 
Si te guste este tipo de juegos, lo mas probable es que no te lamentes del dinero que cuesta, pero recomiendo mas comprarlo en oferta, ya que es una experiencia extraña, que puede gustarte o no.

Beatbuddy's concept of fusing catchy music with puzzle/adventure gameplay is an appealing one. At first glance it looks like Beatbuddy does a good job of bringing that concept into reality. Unfortunately that just isn't so.

On the 3rd of 6 levels I ran into not one, but two different level breaking bugs that required a restart from the beginning of the stage. Exiting to the menu and continuing from last checkpoint did not fix either problem. I stopped playing the game after that. Normally I would persevere through these kind of issues but this brings up Beatbuddy's other fatal flaw: it's not fun to play.

At its core Beatbuddy is a pretty simple 2D exploration game. The environment moves to the music but your character does not. That detachment from the beat makes playing the game feel like any other average 2D adventure game. Couple that with collectable shards that are completely worthless unless you get every single one within a level (e.g., 411/412 won't cut it!) and you're in for a ho-hum experience.

Если кто-нибудь из старичков вспомнит допотопную игру Ecco The Dolphin, то сразу поймёт о чём будет геймплей. Beatbuddy целиком заимствует геймплей Ecco. Разница только в том, что геймплей сопровождается музыкально. Фишка вроде бы интересная, но не удержит за игрой долго. В основном процесс рутинный: найди предмет, который откроет вот этот завал, пройди здесь, убей два моба там, проскочи тут. С трудом заставил себя её пройти. К сожалению, оказалось скучно.

Beatbuddy is a 2D exploration game with the whole game universe based on Music. The presentation is really creative, and the art original. The worlds are varied (with the exception of enemies only two in the entire game...) the Musc is very enjoyable and the fact that it builds up as you explore further gives a really gratifying feeling.

However while the artsy part of the game is great, the ""Game"" part really doesn't keep up.
For starters the narator has a tendency to mimic DJ scratching when he speaks. While it is a very interesting idea the result of it are cutscenes that are painfully long because of him, delaying any sense of conclusion at each and every sentence. Thank god they appear only rarely in the game.
The whole game is underwater which makes it impossible to have granular control. You'll often find yourself restarting mutiple times parts where very precise tasks are required to be done in very little time. Furthermore as you don't gain short invulnerability when hit and enemies love to push you around when they hit you [i]will[/i] find yourself being bounced about to your inevitable death. This happenning quite often it is one of the main reason while you will start cursing the game for not being forgiving.
Level design is not very well thought out either, you will often find yourself trying to find out why you can't go there, if you are actually supposed to be there and stuck because you went somewhere you weren't supposed to be.
All these issues lead to a hot mess of frustration and anger, powerless against a game that punishes you for being to curious.
And it really is a shame that the actual gameplay is the worst part of the game, leaving what otherwise would've been a enjoyable experiment.

Even though BeatBuddy has the looks of a fun rythm/exploration game, it's faulty game mechanics and ill conceived levels put an swift end to any enjoyable experience. Therefore I cannot recommend this game.",1401145139,1401145238,False,6,1,0.521071016788482666,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians is a short indie game that has emphasis on music quality. The music style is closer to electric, beatbox, and dubstep.  (Sorry dubstep fans, I didn’t hear any wub wub wub) The gameplay itself was more focused on solving puzzles. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u7hb9yM6ug
[b][u]-Detailed breakdown review-[/u][/b]
[b]Story:[/b] There are two cinematic throughout the game, the beginning video and ending video, you  are the character “beat” who has been awoken from his sleep and must save the other two guardians and go back to sleep. The guardians are the ones who create the music for the world, so it’s of the utmost importance that they all go back to sleep soon.

[b]Game Play:[/b] The game itself plays to the music, everything is done in rhythm, if you’re boosting, you need to do it in rhythm, if you’re hitting a parasite, it’s in rhythm. There are two “play modes” that you experience in the game, one in a “beatbuggie” where you’re in a vehicle that bounces along to the music on its own, the other is when you’re just swimming through the water as Beat.
As I indicated in my quick review, the game is quite focused on the music quality, and but to me the gameplay was focused on rather simple fun puzzles. I had been playing the game A Virus Named TOM for the past week, so the puzzles were very simple and relaxed compared to my earlier game.

[b]Achievements:[/b] First time playing through I got the majority of the achievements (this pleases me, I want to get through my indie games sometime this year) There are the notorious “speed run the game” and “collect all the things”  achievements, but as a whole most of the achievements you will earn simply by playing through the game once.

[b]Price:[/b] Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians costs $9.99, that’s a consistent price for indie games on steam apparently, I’d suggest waiting for a steam sale, or purchase the game in a humble bundle. I noticed there is also a demo you can download and test out. As always; if you’re really interested in getting a game, checking out a demo is always a smart way to go.
For me on my personal value system (price divided by time equals value) I only played 5 hours of the game until I had It completely beaten, I do intend to go back and try to get tougher achievements, however 5 hours of entertainment for $9.99 would be too hefty for me. For most other people though, that’s a perfectly reasonable price.

 [b]Conclusion:[/b] I really enjoyed this game, I found myself bobbing my head with the music as my character dodged with the music. I would recommend this game to anyone who really wants to play a game with A) Great music B) A beat-based music Game.

This type of game is meant to make the player use the clever beats and rhythms the designers implemented to go along with the level environment. BE the Beatbuddy!

I highly recommend it for those players who like games for their art, music, platformer and puzzle/problem solving elements a game offers. Great game. It kept me busy for some time. Don't zip through the levels, just take your time and really take in the hard work the makers put into it.

Beatbuddy is a rhythmic platform puzzle game... Of sorts. The thing is the game world is, presumably, underwater. So your character (and all others) swim, so it's not like you jump, making the platform part kind of moot. I say it's a rhythmic game because the entire world runs to a beat, each level has it's own song, sadly there aren't many levels. Within each level are several puzzles which, of course, you have to do to progress.

Games that incorporate music into their gameplay are kind of my thing, and to the game's credit it does start out VERY strong. The first half hour or so is incredibly fun and inventive as you experience how the game layers beats on top of each other to create the main song of the level, and discovering each new creature and how it interacts with the soundtrack and Beatbuddy gameplay wise is incredibly novel. Sadly the gameplay fails to stay fresh for very long, relying on the same bounce pad and reflector tile gameplay for the majority of the game, which is pretty disappointing for a game that's only 3 hours long. 

The first thing you'll notice are how floaty the controls feel. The game (appears) to be set underwater, so that point can be somewhat forgiven, but if you're playing with a keyboard and mouse the poor controls are really put front and center. The majority of the game is based upon interacting with your environment, using keys in locks, hitting things to the beat, etc. However this quickly becomes INFURIATING when Beatbuddy simply refuses to pick up an object or swim a certain direction, ESPECIALLY in time sensitive situations. I can count on one hand the times during my playthrough that Beatbuddy picked up or placed an object where I wanted to the first time without having to click the mouse repeatedly. Another totally bizarre control issue is that Beatbuddy will occasionally just stop listening to your commands altogether and swim in completely random directions, sometimes coinciding with your mouse being over the foreground art but sometimes due to nothing at all. All this leads to a very obnoxious gameplay experience at best, and a potentially maddening one at worst. Eventually you get used to it (about 30 minutes before the end, unfortunately) but when the game throws handfuls of enemies at you at once and you're being helplessly knocked around while the game ignores mouse input, or given a time sensitive puzzle and Beatbuddy flat out REFUSES to pick up an essential piece of the puzzle in a timely manner, you can't help but feel let down. 

Thankfully Beatbuddy is forgiven some of its gameplay missteps with a very charming art style, which is a 3D character model on top of very beautiful layered 2D art, although for a musically driven game the soundtrack is surprisingly mediocre, save for a few standouts. While the first level is designed extremely well in regards to introducing not only the layers of song throughout the level in a gradual and fun way, but also the creatures of the world and how they interact with you and the song, that detail seems to go out the window past the first few levels. The soundtrack becomes just the backdrop as the game progresses instead of a major gameplay element, with a few exceptions of course. The fact that the game forgoes a lot of these fun ways to introduce the song of the level compounded with the hit or miss controls and the fact that you see most of what the gameplay has to offer very early on makes the Beatbuddy segments seem like filler until you get to the next vehicle sequence, which is when you get to hear the level's song in its entirety (or as much as they were allowed to play, as the ""level's song in its entirety"" actually only ever ends up being maybe a 15 second loop of a chunk of the chorus). It began to feel like I was just chugging through the same old bounce pad, reflector tile and collect the gems sequences as Beatbuddy until I got to play the next vehicle segment, which turned out to be the game I ACTUALLY wanted to play.

As for the story, it serves its purpose. For a 3 hour game it does its job. The characters are all very likeable and cute, too. Their designs are pretty unique and fit the world well, and they all speak in their own style of beatbox which is pretty endearing. The game has some decent humor in the way of your companion, Clef, dismissing the very clearly falling apart vehicle you both ride in and the Prince character doing some very tongue-in-cheek villain things. Slight spoiler alert here, but the ending seems to happen all at once and with very little fanfare which is very disappointing. For a big, boisterous music game I was expecting a large boss battle with some rousing music, but the ending really comes out of nowhere and happens very quietly. For a short little music game like this I suppose it's fine, I was just hoping for more.

Even with all that being said, there's still something about Beatbuddy. I'd be totally lying if I said a few of the songs weren't still stuck in my head, and I beat it in one sitting and didn't want to stop, which is saying a lot nowadays. Maybe it was because I wanted to see what the next level was going to look like, or what new mechanic they would introduce, or maybe I just wanted to hear what the next song would be. Unfortunately with the gameplay flaws and short gametime Beatbuddy comes off as less of a good videogame and more of a really enjoyable interactive music video. If that's fine to you, by all means pick up this game. If you're really pining for a new music game, pick up this game. For everyone else I'd say maybe avoid this one. Pick up some of the greats (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, etc.) or maybe get it on sale.",1396212089,1396219579,False,80,1,0.81148761510848999,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Puzzles are generally of the right amount of effort and complexity, with a decent learning curve to all the various moves, enemies, and obstacles in the game.

The major problem I had with the game is that the levels are on the long side - 30-40 minutes, and while the backing song does change with the various sections of each level, you're listening to the same basic music over and over again.

Each level takes around 30 minutes to an hour to complete which works well and the levels flow nicely.

The best thing about the game is definitely the music and how it syncs to the gameplay, and how everything just moves together. You can definitely tell how they really wanted to integrate rhythm based gameplay into the game and it works well. 

In most of the game, you'll play as Beatbuddy himself, opening up paths to progress and also solving various puzzles that usually require you moving a device to another area to open doors and so on. But in other parts, you'll be in a vehicle with a companion doing the same thing which keeps the gameplay fresh.

The only downside I found, was sometimes the movements can be a little clunky and frustrating but that's mainly in the vehicle parts and not so much when you're just controlling Beatbuddy himself.

Beatbuddy tells the story of the 3 awaken guardians of Symphonia, a land moved by music where everything including life itself, acts in response to the music. That's probably the strong point of this game, the synchronization of the animations with the soundtrack itself is just perfect. To be honest the game is not exactly nothing out of extraordinary, in my honest opinion, it's good at most but like I said, the soundtrack turns Beatbuddy into something much more enjoyable. The game takes about 5-6 hours to complete and each level has several chapters. There's checkpoints spread throughout the levels in which you save your progress. Overall the levels are pretty well designed along with the background artwork. Most of the game involves bashing walls using the ""bass plants"" which propel you foward and you might change your path by going against mirrors and rotating them in order to go to the right place, there's also times in which you drive some kind of submarine which is actually pretty fun because it moves in bumps synchronized with the beat, other than that is basicly just beating down enemies and moving some kind of devices from one place to another in order to open doors. The game was surprisingly fun for me to play through and relatively short.

As such, the actual game isn't very fun. When swimming ""on foot"", half the time you're going through tight spaces, which gets tiring very quickly. The controls have a laggy feel, since you are supposed to be under water. They should in reality be much tighter for this kind of game.

It gets even worse when you're in the vehicle. Suddenly you jump synchronized to the beat and have to press the button every 2/4th to get a little boost. This isn't very fun either. Trying to move synchronized with huge bubbles that are slower than you is really a pain in the ass.

Beatbuddy has apparently been painstakingly patched by dedicated developers.
Beatbuddy, however, is broken by design, at least gameplay-wise.

The game seems to attempt to relate its gameplay formula to rhythmic cues and boy does everything seem really nice, in theory, until you actually start to move around. The issue is very simple, and very hard to fix for a complete game.

Automatic actions happen between set intervals, following the beat of the song - but your movements don't. This is partially fixed by the vehicular sections, that set your movements to the beat, although not responding reliably to input.

Dashes, punches and other actions happen in their own time and generate offsetting audible feedback, making controls feel even less responsive than they already are. This becomes clear since the start of the game, as soon as color-changing bubbles and spiked crabs appear.

Obstacles clear their paths within the song's rhythmic call, as you dash through 0.3 seconds later causing annoying dissonance.
Crabs swing to the beat, as you punch them as fast as you can click, ignoring any sort of timing or planning there could ever be.
Vehicle dashes are timed to the second beat! Except holding the button does the same thing, while attempting to click on-beat results in failed half-dashes.
Jellyfishes move to the beat! Move along with them in synchronicity so you can survive! Except they move less per beat than you do, forcing you to either ignore the song or smash your face every sixth beat.

The issues pile up as new elements are added, it seems.
Playing only with visual cues might actually be more helpful than attempting to follow the song.",1393725750,1393725750,False,87,1,0.696762621402740479,1,False,False,False,False,,,

ゲーム紹介を見る限りノリノリの音楽の中、海の中を探索し仕掛けを解いていくアクションゲームといった感じですが肝心のリズムゲーム要素が薄いのでそういった方向に期待すると肩透かしをくらうと思います。悪くもないが良くもないといった感じ
敵はリズムに合わせて弾を撃ったり移動したりしているのですが、こちらが取るべきアクションが必ずしもリズムに乗る必要がありません。リズム要素が皆無ではないが無音でもクリア出来そうという印象です。
また目先の仕掛けをクリアすることよりも、次にどっちにいけばいいのか迷う時間が結構ありました。タイムアタック要素のために敢えてこういう作りにしているのかもしれませんが余計なフラストレーションが溜まる作りだったと思います。

一方で難易度はやさしめなので、Electoronic Super Joyみたいにとにかく難しいアクションゲームに嫌気がさしている人にはいいかと思います。

雰囲気ゲーの作りなのに肝心の雰囲気がゲーム性に活かされてない惜しい作品という評価です。",1393486914,1393486914,False,13,0,0.603332936763763428,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The music however wasnt coming out of Spotify or iTunes but from the spiky arms of the treble crab and thumpy leaves of the bass flower. This is the world of Beatbuddy, where everything breathes harmony, rhythm and melody. Beatbuddy is a product of the recent resurgence of the indie game industry, an original, lovingly crafted title that is brimming with child-like joy and fun.

In Beatbuddy you explore a world that moves to the beat, each level has a soundtrack that weaves in an out as you encounter various creatures and obstacles. In terms of gameplay there is nothing under the skin that is particularly revolutionary or unfamiliar. You float around the world a la Flyn or Aquaria, solve puzzles to open your way forward and avoid dying horribly by terrible traps. So far nothing new you say, but it's Threaks approach these familiar mechanics that makes the game a really cool experience. Life threatning bubbles are only damaging every other beat, the spiky crabs that prevent you from continuing are actually playing the treble line of a Parov Stelar song and that clanky ship you're driving, it only moves every second beat.

Unlike other games where the soundtrack may complement the on-screen action to create a mood or an emotion, Beatbuddy actually incorporates the music into your movements which means you better have good rhythmic sense otherwise you're gonna hurt that cute little buddy a lot. Movement in Beatbuddy is all about timing.

The stellar soundtrack is not let down by the graphical prowess of Beatbuddy, the world is hand-drawn with equal parts wonderous beauty and charming silliness that is easy on the eyes and makes you smile inside. I particularly like what you could describe as the chubby technicians that beatbox to eachother complaining about things not being broken or stuff getting stolen.

Beatbuddy is a great product that overflows with love and is just a fun game. The music is fantasic and will often have you dancing along with the on-screen protagonist. So turn that music up and get ready to rumble.

As a little blue dude, you are summoned to go talk to your sister, an 'Etherial' who is one of the main caretakers of the world (I assume). You work your way through worlds that react to the rhythm around them, and by interacting with things, you can progress. But sadly, it's just a glorified platformer that doesn't bring anything new or fun to the table. Nothing even FEELS music based - it just so happens that things pulse to the beat, but you're not really rewarded for good timing or anything - you just move through a world that plays music.
The first level took me half an hour to complete, going at a reasonable pace. In that time, I could see that the game was trying to be funny and trying to have intriguing plot elements, but by the end of the first level I was bored, nothing had me hooked, and I quit the game without caring where the story was going.

I sadly cannot recommend this game, but to try and give a positive outcome to my review, I would recommend that you, the reader, try playing Aquaria.

This game has really great music and the gameplay really synchronyzes you with music's beat. After playing this game i couldn't help singing over and over these musics.

Ich habe gerade Beatbuddy durchgespielt und mal ein paar deutsche Reviews gelesen. Die sind mir leider alle viel zu ungenau, deshalb mach ich jetzt selber eins.

Ich möchte in paar Worte zu den Hauptkategorien des Spiel sagen:

[u] Grafik [/u]: Super. Sie gefällt mir sehr schön. Gut gezeichnet und wirkt auch sehr stimmig. Warum allerding der Hauptcharakter 3D sein MUSS (ja MUSS sagen die Entwickler selber in den Ingame-Extra-Kommentaren) und daher etwas künstlicher wirkt als seine Umgebung ist mir nicht klar.

[u] Sound [/u]: Der gefällt mir soweit ganz gut. Man muss natürlich auf so eine Musik stehen. Viel gibs da eigentlich nicht zu zu sagen, weil er hat speziell ist.

[u] Balance [/u]: Ist einfach nicht da. Es gut mir leid, aber ich frag mich ernsthaft ob da Tester an dem Spiel waren. Es gibt teilweise so lächerliche Savepoints. Damit meine ich. Entweder zu viel oder zu wenig. Hinzu kommt, dass man sich durch bestimmt Passagen einfach ""durchquälen"" muss. Ich liebe Dark Souls weil es verdammt schwer ist aber fair. Dieses Spiel hier hat einfach lächerlich behinderte Stellen die nicht fair sind.

[u] Atmosphäre [/u]: Naja hier würde ich es aus zwei Seiten aus betracht. Musik ist super und passt zum Rest der Welt die schön Funky ist und einfach Freude bereitet. Jetzt mal die andere Seite betrachet. Warum zur Hölle gibt es ständig diese dummen Rätsel? Sie reißen einen KOMPLETT aus der Atmosphäre raus. Tragen dabei Null zum Spielspaß bei und sind einfach nur Beschäftigungstherapie. Hätte man eher ein Konzept wie bei Runner 2 benutzt wäre das Spiel im gesamten wesentlich besser.

[u] Bedienung  [/u]: *Hust hust* also... ich spiel ja nicht gerne Flug Simulator und sowas weil man einfach ewig brauch sich zu drehen bei voller Geschwindigkeit. So ähnlich habe ich mich hier gefühlt. Ich bin mir mehr in Sirup vorgekommen als in Wasser, weil der Beatbuddy einfach so schwerfällig ist.

[u] Umfang  [/u]: Naja.. 6 Level hatte ich in locker 4 Stunden durch. Was soll ich dazu groß sagen? Froh nur 1,80€ gezahlt zu haben. Kein Interesse groß weiterzuspielen fürs erste weil die Erfolge auch Null motivieren.

[u] Handlung [/u]: Rette die Welt. Ende.

[u] Rätsel [/u]: Stumpft. Wohl auch einer der Gründe warum ich mir wünsche es wären keine Rätsel im Spiel.

[u] Sonderpunkt --> Wie das Spiel mit der Musik umgeht [/u]: KAUM!!! GROßE GEFAHR HIER!!!! Das Spiel verspricht einem ""Boah wir sind so toll mit unserem Game. Hammer crossover hier mit Mukke und so. Ey du spielst im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes die Musik selbst."" *ERROR* Ist kaum der Fall. Man merkt es leider kaum. Es gab wenige Momente im Spiel wo ich dachte ""Hey cool ich nehme hier gerade Einfluss auf die Musik"" bzw ""Ich spiele mit der Musik"" aber es ist eher so, dass die Musik den Takt vorgibt wie man zu spielen hat. Mehr ist das nicht.


[u] Zusammenfassung [/u]: Im Spiel kann man sogenannte ""Extras"" freischalten um zu sehen, wie die Entwicklung des Spiel vorangeschritten ist. Warum ich das erwähne? Nunja man sieht da ein Paar junge Typen die eine coole Idee hatten und dachte ""Hey lass mal ein Spiel daraus machen und Geld verdienen"". So wirkt das Spiel leider auch. Nur voller ""netter Ideen"" aber nichts Halbes und nichts Ganzes. Ein paar Spieledesigner haben sich ausgetobt ohne auch nur etwas von ""gutem Gameplay"" zu verstehen. Das Spiel hat einfach großes Potential verschenkt indem es gute Sachen aufgegriffen hat und dabei schlecht umsetzt. Man merkt, dass hier einfach noch jede Menge Erfahrung von etablierten Spieleentwickler fehlt. Das Spiel ist daher ""nur ganz ok"" Ich würde sagen:

6.5/10

Отдельно скажу про саундтрек - мало того, что сама по себе музыка прекрасно подобрана, так ещё всяческие игровые действия преподносят музыке какой-то новый звук, а там недалеко ещё ""трамплин"" - ещё один новый звук.

The story is really engaging due to how your actions affect the world.

Even though that's where it loosely gets lumped by genre, it already gets a head start on not being just ""oh no, another one of THOSE"".

For one thing, the underwater theme allows the levels to wander off in arbitrary directions and be designed around exploring them and using the game's other unique mechanics, rather than the usual focus on precision running and jumping. And those mechanics? That's where the ""beat"" comes in. Nearly every interactive object and enemy makes a sound that's part of the (pretty groovy) soundtrack of the game, and even things that don't make some kind of instrumental sound (e.g. swimming into a wall makes a nice, percussive drum-thump). Fighting/evading enemies, zipping past barriers, and solving puzzles in general ends up having a flow to it that matches the feel of the song used in that level, but without being as restrictive about it as an overt rhythm game is. Kind of like the same basic musical interaction concept as 140, only taken in a completely different direction.

The art's rather nice, with enough little details thrown in to give each level a different tone and personality, but clean enough that everything's immediately identifiable. Lots of deep colors going on, which is nice for a change. The characters and story are amusing enough and keep the game moving along. Probably most importantly, the music is good and actually works for what they're doing. They actually pulled off creating a world around half a dozen electro swing songs and stuck a game into it.

The objective of the game is to solve puzzles and get from one point to another on a 2D plane. The puzzles are boring. They are fairly simple and are pretty much the entire game. The stages are extremely long, about 30 minutes  a piece with the same 3 minute track on repeat.

Esteticamente è molto bello anche se di fondo si nota una certa semplicità nella costruzione dei livelli. 
Ha una serie di tracce musicali che scandiscono ogni livello che, nonostante non siano tutte efficaci alla stessa maniera, sono veramente fighissime. 
Il character design l'ho trovato disgustoso, la storia ignobile, skippata alla grande. Ma sono solo futili dettagli perchè il gioco è divertente. Il flow dei comandi sulla base regala momenti esaltanti, altri incantevoli.
È un gioco, comunque, rilassante, non impegnativo che regala qualche ora di spensieratezza.
Consigliato alla grande.

You travel the world of Symphonia as Beat, one of the 3 guardians that hold the rhythm of their world in balance. It's an explorative puzzler of a game that will have you dodging obstacles like the conductive hand of the Hi-Hat crab, or bouncing your way through the water on Bass drum plants on the quest to stop the evil prince attempting to take total control of Symphonia's music.

Each stage of the game hosts its own unique tune, and it's incredibly fun seeing just what part of the environment is playing each instrument in the composition, with parts picking up or slowing down depending on where you are in the map. They've got all sorts of genres in store here and you're sure to find a favorite or two during your time playing.

The art style is also gorgeous, with several layers of hand drawn visuals across every inch of the screen. Every new level hosts  a barrage of eye-popping visuals. From giant coves of crystals, to wide open expanses of sunset colored anemones.

I do have a few complaints. Portions of the game that are more fast paced and on the clock can be a bit tricky to maneuver with the underwater controls, as you'll sometimes find your little Beatbuddy drifting in another direction or bouncing off the walls from trying to move too fast. I almost find it better just tapping the fast movement button for a quick burst as you're first taught in the game, rather than holding it down.

Another bit of an issue can be the combat. It's not too often at the start, with just a mere enemy or two to smack. However when a multi-targeting system is introduced about 3-4 stages into the game, it can be a bit dodgy to use when 5-6 targets are constantly moving about. Thankfully there's usually enough health pick ups to make up for the health loss when I resort to spamming the punch button on everyone in the room.

Gripes aside, the main pull of this game is in it's core mechanic, rhythm based puzzling. And that is where it definitely succeeds. There is an incredible charm to seeing the stage move in perfect harmony to the musical score as you solve it's mysteries to move to the next area.

I also do enjoy the story and characters dollaped on top. This sort of game could've easily been done with no plot tying it together and more abstract environments, but the plot adds just enough without being too serious or overbearing to affect any enjoyment you'd get. All the characters have fun designs and quirky dialogue to carry it all along, and none of them overstay their welcome or take away from the gameplay. (Even if the character's various beat-boxing voice boxes can get a little jarring to hear after the 12th time that it's looped)

I'm getting a real kick out of it, and as of writing this review I happened to pick it up for a steal at over 75%, so it's MORE than worth the money if you catch it on sale. It has it's quirks, but not enough to completely ruin the fun you're sure to have.",1388646251,1388646251,True,2,0,0.532346069812774658,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Beatbuddy is a rhythmn platformer in which you play as a little dude swimming through a world where music is (literally) life. Nearly every moving object on screen has a set sound, which all combines into a really cool beat that plays throughout your adventure. You must dodge, remove, and blast through many of these objects in order to solve puzzles and clear your way through each level. Think the swimming sections of the old Ninja Turtles game, but without the electricution every two seconds.

The world created here is absolutely gorgeous, with smooth animation and vibrant colors. The puzzles themselves aren't typically too difficult, but it will take a little over half an hour to clear each zone with numerous auto-saving checkpoints along the way. You'll run into various other characters, and there's quite a bit of humor and charm with this.

The main draw, of course, is the music. The way the various ""creatures"" and objects in the game combine to make a solid rhytmn is marvelous. It's not like a lot of music games that claim objects fit the beat; here, you can see everything bobbing and moving in time with the song. Crabs become hi-hats, jump platforms pulse with bass, snare bubbles open chambers, and lasers are, well, laser beats. What results is an incredibly chill experience that will leave your own head bouncing in tune while you play.

Rather, the main draw here is Beatbuddy's personality and soundtrack: every time a character speaks, the text box is backgrounded by a different beatboxing track, and, as you move through the stages, the music changes in complexity depending upon what's happening around you.

This sense that features of the level design are actually creating the music doesn't seem as potent or as 1:1 as in some other games that have done similar, most notably 140, but the music itself is good.

The way the controls and the actions you take just blend seamlessly with the music is so great. I was sitting here bobbin my head the whole time i was playing, and the tunes are great. Kinda hypnotizing really. If you ever want to distract me and steal my wallet just turn this on and hand me a controller.

so, i HIGHLY reccomend this game, i give it a 10/10 with ease. And im not one to do such a thing after only playing an hour. BUY IT!",1386835233,1386835233,True,18,0,0.58409881591796875,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Much of the flora and fauna in the game both move along with the beat and in some cases provide percussion.  It's a charming experience and it's easy to find yourself stopping just to listen and watch them  all do their thing.  Being in time also helps in moving around and in solving some of the parts of the puzzles.  Even the beatboxing that musically represents the character dialogues fits in well.

Not to say Beatbuddy offers nothing else but that was my first thought as I spotted this brilliant looking game. It seems to me often indy games either focus on game play or art and usually sacrifice one for the other. It is an unfortunate decision when it comes to the meager budgets such studios often have to work with. Beatbuddy certainly focuses on the visuals with some amazing eye candy that I can tell was lovingly crafted by a very hard working artist and on top of that it incorporates some amazing music into it as well.

So the game looks amazing and features some pretty good music. But the ultimate question we always have to ask ourselves, how fun is it? Visuals are great but in my experience after a few hours of playing the wow-factor always wears off no matter how pretty the game is. At that point I just focus on the whole purpose of the game, playing it! Steam classifies Beatbuddy as a “Casual Indie Platformer Action Adventure” game. And while it does fit into the extremely generic Action Adventure classification, platformer seems not to do the game justice. Was Echo the Dolphin a platformer? That is what reminds me most of Beatbuddy’s gameplay style. And it is refreshing to see something similar with your little Beatbuddy swimming around the world rather than jumping from platform to platform. If anything its more of a puzzle action game as you traverse the beautiful looking water caves of ‘Symphonia’.

Part of me feels like there was some sort of checklist over in Threaks’ development studio. What does a good action puzzle game have to have? Launch springs? Check. Vehicle sections? Check. Teleporters? Check. Dashing Combat? Check. Collectibles? Check. Open and closeable doors? Check. Moveable walls? Check. While nothing is particularly ground breaking it is certainly full of your typical puzzle elements. The vehicle section seems to offer the only really unique little caveat with your vehicle only being able to shoot in one direction and you have to find these arrow points to rotate you around so you can blast through different parts of the maze. Overall it’s a pretty good set of puzzle game components but I have one annoying complaint. Beatbuddy introduces one element at a time and gives you time to master each element before adding a new. This is a good idea and all but I feel they take too much time introducing new elements. Because of this the first 4/5 of the game feels like little more than a long drawn out tutorial where you master each element and then mix it in with some old element, then move on.

This makes the first few levels feel incredibly unchallenging. Frankly I was starting to get bored but kept plowing through anyway. The visuals and music were almost enough to make up for the slow increase in complexity but the game was really lagging halfway through. Yet when I reached the last level and all the different complex systems were used together, the game was really quite fun. The only problem was I had about 45 minutes of fun after about 4 hours of meh. If the game had kept going, had a few more levels with all the toys in them, I’d have been really really happy with this game. Yet it left me somewhat disappointed when it ended. And the game is really much too short. Even though I was taking my time (flower sniffing as my MMO friends would say) I still completed the whole game in under 5 hours. That seems a bit of disappointing value for the $15 cost of entry even with the great music and visuals. Hell, you know a game might be too short when there’s an achievement for beating it in under 3 hours!

The music system however is really quite good. I actually hope mainstream game developers might take a few chapters out of Beatbuddy’s book here. Each level (or track) has a unique song that flows in the background and changes dynamically based upon what you are doing. It will kick up into full gear when you’re in a vehicle or lulls back to a simple beat when you’re just mellowing in empty water. It is further enhanced as enemies add their own tracks that work into the rhythm of the song. This gives me ques as to upcoming enemies such as snare drums means I’m going to be running into some spike guys soon or a throbbing base drum means there’s a springy thing around. The best use of this is the snail mounted turrets that shoot at you in beat to the song. It’s really quite clever and makes me really feel the rhythm as I try to dodge deadly flying objects.

For the most part I felt like Beatbuddy might be too easy. The game is incredibly forgiving most of the time with your character able to take many hits and plentiful sources to replenish health abound (heck your vehicle automatically restores health after just a couple seconds). None of the puzzles are mind bendingly difficult and only one or two near the end even take more than a few moments of thought to figure out. I almost feel like the developers didn’t want you to have any troubles in seeing their beautiful art/music project and made sure the game did not get in your way. There are a couple places that I got a little frustrated at but nothing so bad as to make me rage quit and generally I was able to figure out a way forward and continued my progress.

While the game seems fairly well polished I did run into a few blemishes along the way. The intro and ending cut-scenes (which featured a horribly annoying beat-bop voice that I just wanted to strange!) had a white border around the hand drawn visuals. And then the caption, in white, bled over the border making it hard to read what was said. Since the voice was trying too hard to be beat-ish I could hardly understand was was said either. Also I found a few places when running from a collapsing ceiling (check) where I would get stuck. The ceiling collapsed down then stopped and locked me in a small box with no escape and I ended up having to quit and launch the game again to go back to the most recent checkpoint. For that matter, checkpoints? I thought we were past that ancient system! Another thing that really drives me bonkers is the camera constantly zooming in and out. I wish they’d pick a zoom level and stick to it, preferably far enough away that I can see where the hell I’m going rather than the tight shots that make it far too easy to get lost.

Also don’t look for much in terms of story here. I think there might have been somebody somewhere with a nice story but almost none of it is portrayed in the game. It feels like it was ripped out of your typical tropes, some army invades some temple, kidnaps the princesses, and you have to rescue them. Also once you finally catch up to the end boss don’t expect some climactic final fight, the ending is more anti-climactic than doing laundry.

The title suggests this game is all about music and in a way it is, but don't expect something like Bit.Trip Runner, Symphony or Audiosurf here. Beatbuddy is an action adventure where your enemies produce the sounds resulting in a track for each of the six levels. The levels themselves are big and should take you around 30-45 minutes to finish. So completing the game will take you about 5-6 hours. I can tell you that that's more than enough because Beatbuddy just doesn't have enough variety to keep things interesting for much longer than that. True, it introduces new puzzles and enemies in every level that you play, like so many other games really, but for Beatbuddy is just isn't enough. 

Plus, the fact that I experienced 2 game breaking bugs made me realize that Beatbuddy is a good game, but nothing groundbreaking. I can understand that a game has bugs, as long as they don't break the game but for a game that's 2D and somewhat linear it's unforgiving. Especially if it's such a short experience.
On the other hand; the levels are well made and have beautiful art so it's not all bad.

My advice to you: grab it when it's on sale.

Dadurch ist die gesamte Spielmusik alles andere als langweilig (auch wenn ich sie alleinstehend nie hören würde), aber ingame ist sie in ihrer gesamten Wirkung nur ""catchy"" (das englische Wort drückt einfach besser die Bedeutung aus).
