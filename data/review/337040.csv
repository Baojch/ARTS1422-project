However, there's a big problem with it...it's just too random.

There's four missions that you complete, you cannot complete more than that or less (unless you die). So by the fourth mission you would hope to have good weapons. Well having good weapons doesn't matter if you don't have the armour, and you need the right armour as well. How many types of armour are there? There's 16 armours, and you only have 3 missions to actually get the armour you want because after the fourth mission you've won! So usually you might get one or two of the types of armour that you need (sometimes I've all the armour I need, but that's 1 out of 10 times). How do are these armour made available? They're random.

But wait...because we haven't talked about the weapons yet. These are random too. And there's one class of weapon that you should NEVER pick; the explosive weapons. You are entering ships which are very fragile (pistols and small rifles can damage them easily), so explosives are BAD. The developers spent time creating a part of the game that you shouldn't be using. And remember that the weapons available are randomly selected, so you can have these useless weapons picked at random. So you might not have the weapons you need by the fourth mission.

All this means that you often don't have the firepower needed. I've had to go against enemies on the fourth mission using the starting weapons! Sometimes I have good weapons but don't have the armour required. Sometimes I have the armour but don't have good weapons.

That's the main complaint...that you don't get the equipment that is needed. It's the most random game I've come across.

The last complaint is about a bug that is widely know about. If you are going up against portal enemies you can get your deadnauts teleported if they step to close to a portal. This can teleport them into a wall, which means they are lost and you have to leave the mission without them.",1636816954,1636816954,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's Real Time Strategy for certain, however how it is handled is quite unique. When you launch the game from your Library you'll be presented with two choices. Launch Game and Read Manual (Recommended). My advice, even though you will be as eager as me to just jump in is read the manual. Otherwise you'll start the game, fumble your way in beginning a mission, usually purely by chance and then fumble along until all your little Deadnauts are KIA, or like me you achieve the Objective and Evacuate.
However, even if you win you will not know what winning means for the campaign nor how to replace your losses (Market Place or Cloning). So, you will, if by playing you are intrigued by what you've seen so far, you go back and read the manual.

Many reviewers have compared the game with ""Aliens"", and I can see why but to be honest if you are aware of the [b]Warhammer 40,000[/b] universe, I'd compare it more with ""The Deathwatch"", with your little Deadnauts being Deathwatch Space Marines in a Kill Team. Where this analogy falls down is the roster, found to the left of your three-faced monitors. It is made up mostly of female operatives and of course there are no women in the [b]Adeptus Astartes[/b], despite many dissenters now demanding equality. Let's face it, though. A brotherhood has no women, but I am getting off the topic.

As I said, your screen, on booting the game will be presented with a circular monitor being your navigation chart. Here you boost your ship to a target and drop your troops. There is much to explore on this screen, and I have only just re-started playing after being away from the game for some years. In fact on my first run after years away, I won my very first mission (I lost all my teams previously).

The screens to the left are for your troops, equipping them and viewing their stats, amongst other things.
The screen to right (and these screens are accessed by using the [b]Q[/b] and [W[/b] keys) lists your Objectives, the Marketplace to buy items or soldiers, or Clone those you've lost in your mission, assuming you've enough Alien corpses to pay for this.

The gameplay is, as I've stated real time as you move your little circles, representing your troops (or Kill Team as I think of them) through a ship, or Space Hulk as I see it. Some of your 'nauts are equipped with sensors and equipment to unlock doors, Hack terminals to restore power, or lock doors. Move through, looking for your Objective and perhaps killing the occasional alien along the way (I think of Genestealers). Once you've achieved your Object, say ""Locate the Ship's Journal"", you must then escape back to the room you were inserted into (by boarding torpedo, as I imagine), but by achieving the Objective you'll have awakened the aliens (red blobs) that swarm you as you run, unlocking doors and locking them behind you as you go. Once you've reached the blue extraction circle, you press a button on the panel to the right, where the game is played and extract what is left of your squad (teleporting out in my mind).

That's the game, in essence. Of course there is more to it, as I've written, by equipping your troops with more or different equipment as you purchase them, replacing troops and finding your next target in the Campaign. For the price, especially on sale, the game is a worthy addition to any RTS player's library. Watch a gameplay video if unsure, but as I say at the this price, it's worth the time, and effort.

I had originally given this game a positive review. But after more hours of play, im sad to see it is completely RNG based (as opposed to skill / wits based), unbalanced, and very poorly implemented.

You have tons of stats like damage & defence types, but almost never the tools (weapons shield types) to exploit them. What you get is 100% RNG based. For example, you face enemies succeptible to say beam weaons, but oops! RNG decided there are no beam weapons available. And this happens most of the time.

You are tasked missions that (again, based on RNG) will probably be IMPOSSIBLE to complete. And i do mean Impossible! Like destroy things that are in a room that is about to collapse, except weapons fire Damages the room! so how do you complete it without blowing up the room? oops! ""RNG"" dint favor you this time. Start the whole camaign over!

That, plus a TON of UI / QOL ""little"" annoyances that become unbearable over time. E.g. you cant sort your crew members the way you want (yep, even THAT is RNG). So its impossible to say 1 and 2 are soldiers, 3 is hacker, 4 is shields, etc. Add to that that on every campaign the game assigns different Pictures to your team (you guessed it! RNG!) and its impossible to become acustomed to a team.
And many other ""little nuances"" like that, wich add up to suck all the fun out of the game.
Get Duskers instead. Its a very similar game, but FAR superior in every way, plus the devs of Duskers DO know how to implement RNG properly on a game.",1608122310,1608286610,False,17,0,0.659878730773925781,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A dark and chilling Sci-Fi squad management game where you're team aren't ever completely safe and death can wait behind any door.
The low tech world you as the pilot and commander of your ""DeadNauts"" must navigate around is one that tells many dark and horrific stories of the inevitable fate of extinction and of failing against something superior to your own self.

Life isn't fair and neither is your game, everything is procedural.
Heres a list of some of the ways my ""nauts"" got butchered:
1. Sent my independent scout to scan for ""artefacts"" so that she'd keep morale, The ghostly creature melding through a bulkhead and dragging her into a storeroom negated the need to keep her happy as she was dead.
2. One of my combatant armed with an axe and shield didn't stand a chance when he opened a door to find a sentinel turret behind it, cut into him like paper.
3. Sent my heavy weapons guy into a cargo hold to sacrifice himself for the rest of the team, I had him cloned after that mission but didn't expect the rest of my ""nauts"" to insult him for being fake.

The sound design is phenomenal with the screams, radio chatter and clanking having me glued to the screen and jumping out of my skin as the household cat unexpectedly rubs against my leg.

The log system is also a cool feature as you can garner information about the ships and the enemies you have to deal with, with the small chance of being able to unlock new armour weapons and tech.

This game is unfair, chilling and dark but you should buy it if those three things appeal to you. fans of the alien franchises could probably enjoy this!

PROS
+ Interesting idea
+ Decently built atmosphere

CONS
- Confusing gameplay all around
- Boring
- No tactics
- No music?
- What's the story again?

I loved the idea behind the game. It reminded me of Lt. Gorman from Aliens when the Colonial Marines went into LV-426 to investigate and he was on the dropship watching and directing their movements. Then I was dropped into the game with no tutorial. I took a minute to work my way across the console. Very interesting idea. I like it. There could be a lot of things streamlined, but it adds to the almost steampunk nature of it, in my mind. I think I understand the console well enough. I find out how to breach my first ship.

I work my way across the ship realizing there are no tactics. You just select all your people and move them together... they shoot together... You could take the time to individually move each person, but by the time they all got into position the alien they faced would be dead or gone. There are no tactics. So I continue investigating the ship and collecting data. I figure out how to read ship logs and get some idea of a story. I keep searching. I have no hacker so I can't hack. Don't know what hacking does anyway. I have some defensive player. Don't know what she really does even though I read her gun stats. Battles happen way too fast for me to make use of her anyway. I keep searching. Where's the music? This is getting boring. The graphics are basic, obviously, so there's nothing to really look at. Even reports on the aliens lack any identifying features. No photos. You're fighting orbs. I finish and evacuate the ship.

I find another ship. Repeat everything from ship 1. Hey, one enemy orb shoots rockets or something at you. A new enemy! It looks like the other enemy orb. Oh, somebody died. I can't really read this health gauge properly. I try to move my people to cover or something but it's just a wild west shootout. A couple more die. I decide I don't care. It's either death or the lonely blackness of space with no music. I don't know which is worse. I keep playing for a while. I'm bored with it all. I quit.

That's esentially the game. The negatives could have EASILY been corrected. Add ambient music or radio chatter (chatter comes through in text). It should be a turn based system with cover to add some excitement during battle and allow us time to use our weapons and gadgets, not just a shooter. There needs to be a better explanation of what everything is and why. The messy interface is interesting, but make it logical so people know where to go to find things they are picking up.",1508806337,1508806337,False,10,2,0.572726905345916748,0,True,False,False,False,,,

bislang muss ich sagen das ich vom Ersteindruck auch ziemlich beeindruckt bin, kurz zum Spielablauf, man könnte sagen ihr seid der Anführer einer Rettungscrew die div. Schiffe im Universum durchsuchen, verschiedene Gegenstände bergen und retten müssen und auf dem Weg dorthin noch div. andere Informationen sammeln solltet. Ich habe nun meine ersten 2 Bergemissionen erledigt und kann sagen das Spiel ist wirklich sehr spannend. 
Eure Crew interagiert miteinander, ihr solltet wirklich auf jeden achten denn jeder Schritt könnte der letzte sein, mancher möchte nur ungern allein gelassen werden, der nächste hat Angst vor Toten usw. all diese Vor-und Nachteile die ihr auch selbst einstellen könnt, denn ihr dürft über einen Editor auch eine eigene Crew erstellen.
Das Spiel ist wirklich sehr interaktiv eure Crew kommuniziert untereinander ihr seht das über eure Statusbildschirme und könnt so auf Ängste, neue Gefahren und/oder auch auf Missionsziele reagieren. Sie geben euch je nachdem auch hinweise wie man mit dem Feind arbeiten/verfahren sollte. 

Alles in allem ist das Spiel wirklich anspruchsvoll, man muss viele Dinge beachten die Missionsziele sind oft hart und man muss zusehen das man alle Crewmitglieder im Auge behält und durch die Vielfalt der Schiffe und Ziele wird das Spiel nicht langweilig man muss jedoch auch mit echten Herrausforderungen rechnen die man evtl. nicht alle meistern kann, bei meinem ersten Spieldurchgang wurde ich in wenigen Mintuen platt gemacht! :( 

Wer auf Herrausforderungen steht, SciFi im Stile von Event Horizon, Alien und Konsorten steht. Der sollte definitiv zuschlagen, wünsche euch viiiiiiel Glück in den höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden.

This was just frustrating. I gave it a go, but in the end I achived nothing.

I had 2 or 3 missions my team didn't even get passed the first room!

The first thing I noticed is my team always hated each other, which gives you big penalties. I even tried taking perks so that my guys makes friends easy. but after a few minutes and they hated each other anyway. You'd think a team of professional could put aside their dislikes to survive, but I guess your team is just a group of yahoos with no sense of survival. Because the penalties are heavy.

I played arounf 2 dozen missions and failed horribly each and every sigle one of them. Maybe it's just me who sucks at this game and don't understand the basic of it. But no matter what I tried, I only achieved total and utter defeat. Even with a full team of combat oriented crew I had trouble engaging even a single alien (some of them are easy to engage, but I encountered them sparsely). You need to gather a lot of intel before you start to get a faint idea of how to engage the enemy. By then most of the time most of your team is already dead or dying. Even when it says you can simply engage them your team does poorly, most of the time. One of the rare times I got lucky enough to get aliens life forms my team could actually manage, the room with the log, I needed to retried, was protected with a turret. Which your team has NO WAY to defeat (afaik), unless you hack it (but even that is temporary). But guess what, my only teamate that could hack it managed to die, before I spotted it, so fuck me. This was the only game I even came close to comple the first mission.

After half a dozen failed attempts, I realised I really needed more info about the game so I read the game manual. That didn't help one bit. For example, I read about scanning rooms. So I got a guy with high detecting skill and equiped him with a scanner. But for the life of me, I could not figure out how to scan a room. So it was useless.

Which bring me to another frustrating part of the game... the hacking. Your hacker(s) can only hack what your team visually had contact with. That makes no sense to me. So if there's a turret to hack you need see it and yes the person who's going to need to spot it will more than likely get shot at by it and very likely will die from the encounter (but not always). the one time I managed to hack a turret without anyone dying in the process. I left my hacker on the console in case the nasty thing that reset the ship parameters passed by (because there was no firewall I could set up to avoid that) so the rest of my team could get back.... but my hacker got ambushed by 5 aliens (you know that ones that my whole team have a hard time to handle a single one). So my hacker died horribly and as I predicted it, the turret got reset and the rest of my team was stuck in a room. So much fun!

An other annoying thing is your team is set randomly, and you can't move you guys around. So you can't organize them. For example, you can get your combat crew on the top of the list and your hacker or whatnot arranged a certain way. Since you die all the time you always need to figure out who what and where all the time and it gets annoying. Just that would've made that game super frustrating to simply annoying to me. Also, you need to take the time to equipe them every single time, you can't give them a default equipment build.

All that being said, if you somehow like frustration, swearing and the like... this is the game for you. Otherwise stay away from it.

I still thing the game has potential and is an intresting concept, but I did not enjoy playing it.

Корабли генерятся случайно, в них можно найти трупы бывших членов команды, живые и агрессивные формы жизни, охранные системы корабля (которые можно взламывать), чертежи нового оборудования (которые можно захватить и использовать) и журналы мертвых членов команды (которые можно почитать).  Наших подчиненных можно создать самостоятельно или тоже довериться случайности, у них есть четыре главных аттрибута, с десяток умений, симпатии/антипатии к другим членам команды и индивидуальные психологические бзики.  Агрессивные формы жизни постепенно каталогизируются, а наши члены команды - прокачиваются, обвешиваются оборудованием и при необходимости - возращаются к жизни при помощи клонирования.

Проблемой номер один для меня стало то, что вся хитрая игровая механика скрыта от глаз игрока и несмотря на обилие факторов, влияющих на ход игры, самому-то игроку в каждой конкретной ситуации выбирать почти не из чего. Ладно, если вы чувствуете себя уверенно - можно перевесить всю экипировку отряда, позже вроде бы можно выбрать, что произвести по найденным чертежам. На корабле же выбор сводится к: пойти прямо/направо/влево, исследовать/не исследовать непонятный предмет на полу (исследовать конечно, в чем вопрос?), ломать ли терминал хакером (ломать, но на какую-то мини-игру не надейтесь) и прикрутить ли мощность на генераторе (влияет в основном на якрость освещения в комнате - при ярких лампах вы будете видеть лучше, но и ВАС будут видеть лучше). Ещё можно рассадить взаимно неприятных персонажей в разные отряды, но здравый смысл и опыт просмотра ужастиков всегда подсказывал мне, что гуртом и батьку бить сподручнее, а разделяться - плохая затея. 

В общем, у нас как бы и признаки непрямого контроля, но местами и микроменеджмент в духе старкрафта - например, попробуйте успеть во время боя выделить щитовика и накинуть щит на какого-нибудь члена отряда, или пустить ракету, рискуя зацепить соратников или окончательно доломать обшивку реликтовой космической посудины. Умной паузы с отдачей приказов, кстати, не завезли  - всё происходит в безжалостно реальном времени и наверное, должно способствовать погружению в атмосферу игры.

Тому же погружению должен, по идее, способствовать интерфейс, но он стал для меня проблемой номер два. Интерфейс выглядит интересно и разработчики, видимо, вложили немало труда в него. Игрок как бы сидит в кабине перед тремя панелями с множеством экранов, переключателей, аналоговых шкал со стрелками. Игровое действо мы наблюдаем на центральной панели через круглое, как иллюминатор, окошко радара. Корабль, который мы исследуем, представлен в этом окошке очень схематично: вот эта серая прозрачная коробка - медблок, это белое пятнышко - найденный объект, а вот это красное - враждебный иноплянетянин. Сигнал нашего радарчика иногда слабеет и может вообще оставить нас на время без связи с отрядом, опять же вследствие тщательно просчитанных игрой, но совершенно непонятных для игрока факторов. Что-то прояснить можно из второго основного источника информации - окошка с репликами членов отряда, которые будут комментировать всё происходящее, компенсируя художестыенными текстами скудость графического оформления.

Разработчики как будто специально хотели сделать интерфейс как можно более неинтуитивным и ненаглядным - мол, вы же опытный командир, а не какой-то ламер, впервые севший в кресло в кабине управления. Никакого вам туториала, толко короткая справка об управляющих клавишах. Никаких всплывающих разьяснений, когда вы наводите курсор на непонятные индикаторы, кнопки и характеристики персонажей - вы что, не знаете что означают цвета в диаграмме отношений? Или для чего персоналу космофлота интуиция и как её замеряют? Или между какими основными подсистемами распределяется энергия корабля? Нет? Назад, в академию, на переподготовку! Или вперед - штудировать мануал, что Deadnaut настойчиво предлагает сделать ВМЕСТО запуска игры.

В общем, игра заставляет меня удивляться - с одной стороны, как всё тут круто продумано, просчитано и прописано, а с другой стороны - как неумело всё это донесено до игрока. Кто-то возможно и сумеет проникнуться атмосферой, зазубрить мануал и, продравшись через все грабли интерфейса, обнаружить интересную и самобытную игру, но сама игра вам в этом деле помогать не намерена.",1441704244,1441713939,False,23,0,0.660814106464385986,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Each randomly-generated campaign is four missions long, each mission being a crawl through a randomized ship with randomized enemies, layouts, and corpses to loot. Most missions either have you nabbing the ship's log from the bridge or clearing out all hostiles, and scanning the bodies you find earns you Knowledge which you can use to buy new gear between missions or clone dead 'nauts. What sets this particular roguelike tactics game apart, however, is the presentation. You command your squad from the safety of your ship through some 1960s Soviet submarine-looking monitors. The actual action is all wireframe and icons on a fuzzy radar screen, with rough readouts on health and sanity and radio chatter marred by glare. The real draw of this game is basically roleplaying Gorman from Aliens, commanding your troops on lovingly-rendered low-fi hardware and despairing helplessly as they get picked off one by one.

And they will get picked off, because there are very few limits on what the RNG will throw at you. For some reason, your Deadnauts and their alien foes have a ridiculous number of stats, including combat skills, sanity modifiers, specific weapon resistances, and more. I say 'for some reason' because despite the enormous depth to the characters, you cannot affect these stats and skills in any way. You have the option of customizing Deadnauts before you start a campaign, but once you begin everything is locked in. There's no training or buffing. Worse than this, however, is the enemy generation. Enemies can be anything from ghosts to mutants to cyborgs (all depicted as plain red dots, mind you) meaning their health, attack patterns, and resistances can be all over the place. But you don't know this going into a mission and you can't re-gear once deployed, so if you picked beam weapons and end up fighting things that resist beams, game over, man, game over. Diversifying your team between different weapon types and shields and such could mitigate this, except that (A) you won't get nearly enough Knowledge to effectively diversify and (B) you won't have the focused firepower to take down super beefy enemies.

The strangest limitation by far, however, is the lack of combat orders you can give your team. You can move your Deadnauts around as you want, order them to investigate points of interest. You can give hacking specialists orders to open doors or commandeer automated security systems, and you can have defensive units shield others or debuff enemies. But when it comes to actual fighting, and it ALWAYS comes to actual fighting, all you can really do is stand and shoot. You can't even effectively order 'nauts to attack a specific enemy because the game seems to factor in their sight lines, attention span, and sanity to decide if they're going to listen. There are no cover mechanics, no flanking, nothing. I wasn't kidding when I called it a Gorman simulator, because your orders will end up being as effective as his were.

It's such a strange and ultimately disappointing game, because the foundation for something amazing is all there. The presentation and atmosphere is spot on, and there's a huge variety of situations and systems to plan strategies around. But the game never actually gives you the tools to realize those strategies. Stats are meaningless if you can't do anything with them, and tons of weapon and damage types are actually a liability if you don't know what you'll be fighting next and can't afford to diversify. Even the systems that are really fleshed out have severe drawbacks. Your connection to your Deadnauts can crap out, forcing you to boost audio or video connections to stay in contact. It's a neat touch that does a lot for immersion, but it can also send your Deadnauts into a depressurized room to die en masse because the bad audio connection makes them mishear the order (yes, this happened). I've beaten the campaign once, and I can honestly say it was because I got a lucky combination of gear and easy enemies to use it on. In the final analysis, it's a strategy game where your strategy isn't going to determine whether you win or lose.

You're Lieutenant William Gorman! 

Taken directly in that context, this game succeeds quite well atmospherically. The console is chunky lo-fi-sci-fi and the viewscreen reminds of the installation map they looked at in the movie. This is a nice way for an indie developer to get away with less compelling graphics in the viewscreen. The game continually reminds you that you're not personally with the squad. Your video, audio, data connections fluctuate and commands sometimes aren't heard. 

The gameplay is quite good in that you have a small squad of highly specialized guys (you can customize them a bunch) and you have to micromanage them carefully to succeed. The game is very challenging but I find I've usually lost due to a moment of carelessness, in classic roguelike fashion. 

Excellent replayability. I've won, I've lost many times, and I'm still playing it and having new experiences each time. It's enjoyable to fail, tweak your squad members, and try again. 

The flavor text generation is a nice touch. The ship logs, the overarching story, the alien descriptions, the enemy characteristics, and the lengthy descriptions for all of the above, are quite well done. Though much of it doesn't really matter from a gameplay perspective I still enjoy reading about it. 

The enemies are different each game, sometimes quite substantially. It might be ice zombies, ethereal specters, leaping hordes, etc. Between each of the 4 ships in the campaign, you have a chance to buy equipment. Your purchasing decisions are based largely on how well you have investigated the ships, and how much you have learned about the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. Reading the logs is really quite important, and making decisions based on them will make or break your campaign.

I might update it at some point. 

All in all a great roguelike game. Great atmosphere, superb sound design, fitting (if somewhat minimalistic) graphics, creepy enemies and lots of equipment to research and outfit your Deadnauts with. The game does a great job making you feel like a remote mission planner.. you feel very distant and disconnected from the life and death struggle of your Deadnauts on a strange alien ship. Yet, at the same time, you become more and more attached to these sensor blips on your screen after each (usually harrowing) mission.

But there are also a few things I find lacking. While I do like the challenging difficulty, the game just sometimes grabs you by the b***s and doesn't let go until you're dead. And that can happen in the very first mission, which makes this game rather frustrating for newcomers. If you can't handle RNG and missions going from everything is dandy straight to hell in a matter of seconds, you should stay away from this game. But that goes for any roguelike, really. 

Another complaint I have, is that you can't seem to hire new Deadnauts during a campaign. You can only clone your existing five Deadnauts.. which makes playing the game with randomly generated characters completely unappealing, because you can just create five very good minmaxed Deadnauts since you're stuck with the same guys for the entirety of a campagin anyway. Which makes the game's claim that Deadnauts are expendable (says so in the intro) untrue. 

Another thing I found annoying is that you can't abort a mission. You have to complete the objective, before you can evacuate your Deadnauts from the alien ship.. why? It would be cooler, if you could abandon missions, xcom style. Also, the mission objectives themselves seem to be lacking in variety. In about four hours of playtime and probably 10 - 15 missions I only ever had two objectives: to either find the ship's log or to destroy mysterious artifacts. But maybe I have been only unlucky sofar, since the missions are randomly generated. And the missions themselves (layouts) have been fairly varied.

It would also be nice, if the game would allow you to carry over researched equipment from one campaign to another. Starting at zero every single time you start a new campaign can become quite tiresome.

Despite those flaws (well, they are flaws only in my opinion ofc.) I still think this is a great atmospheric and in style unique game which deserves a closer look. There is a demo available on Screwflie's Deadnaut page, as far as I am aware.

In it's current state, I would give this game an HONEST 7/10 (honest as in 5 is average and everything above that is good). A great, but not perfect, game!

UPDATE: It took me about 7.5 hours to complete my first campaign (including character creation, so actual playtime was probably closer to seven hours). Sooner than I expected.. but then again, the game does offer high replay value. Mission objectives have become more varied since I started over, so that's good. 

But I did notice another annoying thing: you perform actions by clicking on ingame popup texts (such as investigate, hack, etc...). The problem is that your Deadnauts can sometimes only interact with those, if you rotate your camera to a different angle.. which can be really infuriating in situations where every second counts. Luckily this bug happened only infrequently. I can still recommend this game to roguelike fans who don't mind the other stuff I have listed.",1434835262,1434918381,True,8,0,0.576452255249023438,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have played this game for about 3 hours, and it's been teeth-grindingly frustrating. I am being completely honest when I say I have absolutely never felt this level of animosity towards a game. Here are the biggest problems I can list, if and following that I will lay out in more detail my frustrations to anybody who wants to read that far. 
1: Totally random. It's entirely possible to gear up your team and send them into a 100% impossible mission
2: Even when you know what you're doing, impossible scenarios will be thrown at you
3: No mod support. Don't like a feature? Too bad. You're stuck with it. (Devs have said it will come with enough player demand, but I doubt it very seriously just from their phrasing about the work it would take)
4: Some of the character flaws can make a character impossible to use. In an already ball-busting difficulty curve, do we really need that?
5: While in pressured suits, you can die of vacuum exposure. Excuse me?
6: Sentinels. Big evil guns that kill in one hit, can only be hacked once you've seen them, and tend to sit out in the open where you won't see them by any means until it's far too late. 
7: You will be SEVERELY outnumbered and there's a good chance you'll find yourself swarmed by a very large group of armed to the teeth aliens
8: You'll unlock new weapons before you have armor capable of supporting it. Hope you didn't waste your currency on it too early. 
9: Some of the contextual actions have to be activated from a certain camera angle, or else the menu will disappear. 
10: Replacing squad members is too expensive for this kind of game. 

So right there we have 10 good reasons to dodge this one. The concept kicks butt, no denying. I LOVE the atmosphere. I love the isolation. You, as the character, are the pilot of some nondescrepit kind of 1980s tech powered spaceship, and you control all the action through a series of 3 screens and a viewport. I have really felt the pangs of loneliness just staring at these screens, and overall Screwfly did a fantastic job of setting the backdrop and stage for their game. Truly fantastic. However, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, just like Zafehouse Diaries. I hate that game, simply because it's impossible. Every little thing you do will end in disaster constantly because the gameplay is half-baked and poorly implemented. But we're not discussing that here, we're talking about the poor gameplay in ANOTHER game by the same developer. First up is the gearing. You may either create your own characters, or roll the dice. There are 4 classes, as follows:
Combat (carries weapons as primary)
Tech (Carries hacking gear as primary)
Field (Carries shield projectors as primary)
Sensor (Carries sensor pingers as primary)
All of these have a place in the squad except for Field. Because of the limitations of the armor, if you only have one field unit, you have to play favorites with your soldiers. Sure, you only need to extract 1 Deadnaut from the ship to be successful, but at a whopping 3,000Kn to revive the dead, it's pretty much a death sentence to do that. Now then, for the first 2 1/2 hours, I died in the first ship. Every time. I'd get somewhere close, and then I'd die. But this last mission is what did me in. I went into it as carefully as I could. I got lucky: Melee only enemies in a tight ship with decent integrity. That's the best setup you can get. I even caught the Sentinel on board and was able to disable it safely. But it all broke down as I was pulling the log. Would you know, the gen engine decided to place a teleporter on the bridge. I have 2 options: Either destroy it and safely extract the data, or let it be and face a steady stream of enemies until I can get away. I chose to destroy it, and for some reason that vented the bridge. Now here's where it got fun. Noticing that all of my characters were dying from vacuum (which above... Pressure suits. Explain this immediately.), I instructed them to grab the log and run back out the door. The door is now locked thanks to Watchers, which patrol the ship and look for ways to cause you BIG problems. Either way, the instructions were ignored. All of my signal bars were full, and I should've been able to get out fine, but nope. Nobody was taking orders at all. It wasn't until the first person suffocated that everybody else got in gear, grabbed the log, and another died before the door opened. So even in the most optimistic scenario, I lost 2/5 because of 'random' factors. I feel the need to say that I don't oppose the idea of rougelike games. I enjoy them from time to time. But when I encounter a game that I can sink 3 hours into and STILL not beat the first level, well I consider that to be a failure on the part of the developer. Do not buy this game if you enjoy your sanity. If it's the atmosphere you want, go buy Elegy for a Dead World.

After playing for a while, it began to grow on me. Its damnably hard and unforgiving.... I've never cleared more than 2 missions without losing my crew.
The game itself is a real-time, tactical top-down/isometric game with strong elements of team management. You play a controller, safe on board your own ship, while your crew of Deadnauts goes out to explore derelicts. You have absolute control over your crew, but they have their own personalities and agendas which can influence others on the team and mission outcomes. The crew can operate autonomously (and may have too, but I'm not going to spoil that), but they don't seem to do much without your direct input.


Graphics are extremely mediocre. You're controlling your team via a radar screen.... enemies are shown as dots, the team is shown as dots, and areas of interest are shown as dots. It makes for an intense, immersive feel, but those who like a bit of eye-candy are going to be disappointed.
Both sound and music are OK... muted and muffled, they add to the claustrophobic intensity and are well utilised, but again aren't anything special.

But to be honest if you buy Deadnaut out of appreciation of ZD, it's very likely you will find this game kind of disappointing.

The biggest difference between a real time RPG and a turn-based one is the involvement of reflex and speed. Although Deadnaut doesn't lay much stress on them, this still makes Deadnaut more like a Point&Click game instead of an intriguing board game, which unavoidably weaken the depth of strategy and jeopardize the easiness of scheming. However I'm not against real-time RPG; Deadnaut just did it the wrong way. Squad die out almost instantly in most encounters if outpowered, but the lack of pause feature leaves player little time to arrange plan and issue orders, not to mention carefully analyzing battlefield and monitoring team conditions, especially when your squad members are seperated in different rooms. The simplification in interaction doesn't help either: you just click every clickable button to hack, investigate and unlock and then move to the next room, which makes up the majority of exploration and is in no way fun at all.

In the end, it is still a strategy game, not a squad tactic FPS.

I might as well explain why I recommend this game.

First up is the premise of the game. You play as the commander of a team of Deadnauts who's job is to explore stange and alien ships in varying degrees of decay/destruction, your team are ""deadnauts"" because they aren't expected to survive. The game is set during a time in which knowledge has become the standard monies of the day and so that is why your errant band of suicidal explorers are doing this . . . for the knowledge . . . which is money . . . anyway, over the course of the game you will seek out new life, and destroy it cause it's trying to eat you, and dead civilisations or at least the friendly aliens are dead . . . cause all the hostile ones are trying to kill you.

Next up we gots us some gameplay. Well the game plays very much like you are sitting at a console and are keeping tabs on your guys through use of the ship's scanners and com systems . . . actually i think that is exactly what you are doing. At times this can be an issue when you lose connection to one or more of your crew members while at other times you may even see something your guys don't and so you can have them investigate. In terms of combat, you will undoutably encounter lots of this as many of the derelict ships are derelict for a good reason and that good reason is hungry after a few thousand years of having already eaten everyone onboard. There are also automated systems like the ever unhelpful 'watcher' and the delightfully ill-placed sentinals . . . I hate sentinals with a passion and every time i encounter one it wipes out my entire team in a matter of seconds because they are always in killzones so i waltz into a room and three people are dead before I even know what killed them.
Customization is a thing in the fact that you can create custom team members, even import custom faces for them if you so chose but there are a couple ones there already and you can just stick to random team members for extra challenge but I like the story you can create with a custom crew. Crew members will also react to each other's flaws and traits through dialouge which is the only way you will know if that flaw is currently active because someone will mention it. Team mates will also banter a little, especially after they just saved the life of a team mate (""I better be getting a christmas card for this . . . "") and this makes things all the more interesting.

overall I think this game is actually pretty good but I think the small size of it is a little bit of a flaw because it's campaign will only go for about 4 missions can theoretically only lasts an hour at most but fortunately there is permadeath to up the hours it takes you to win. In my own personal opinion, I am waiting for the ""real deal"" with this being an experiment and the sequal being a much larger game with far more content and story but even if that isn't the case, this game is more than deserving of it's price tag and has enough content to make the hundreds of replays you will do worth it.

According to the creepy gameplay watcher, I've played 4 1/2 hours so far, and that sounds about right. A full campaign lasts around an hour to an hour and a half, maybe two if you like to take it slow. I just finished my first successful campaign; all others failed on the first ship... within about 5 minutes of breaching the airlock.

So what is Deadnaut? Basically, it's Space Crusade, except, instead of 7 foot killing machines in power armour, your squad bears a greater resemblance to the crew of the Serenity, or maybe Red Dwarf, depending on the characters you end up with; they're pretty good at what they do, even impressive at times, but they're hardly intimidating. You sit back on the mothership and command your squad through the interfaces that you can see in the screenshots up at the top of this page, pointing out which terminals you want hacked, which doors you want opened, and which -OH HELL WHAT IS THA-JUST SHOOT! KILL IT!!!!- and which centuries-old corpses you want rummaged as you go about completing your objectives. Meanwhile, your crew are chattering away amongst themselves about their stim habits, love of blood-soaked gore rooms, and what kind of card the techie wants for their birthday.
Do a good job, and next time you'll have the opportunity to die a meaningless death a million light years from home with some slightly swankier gear. Pretty cool, huh?

I only have one complaint about the game, apart from my wails of dismay when my entire team is, yet again, suffocated or torn to shreds by indescribable horrors – within the campaign, you unlock new equipment for your crew... none of that carries over between campaigns. Personally, I'd prefer a persistent meta campaign between the campaigns; develop the crew over a series of missions, replace the losses, say goodbye to the retirees and wish luck to those get attention from the powers back on Earth. I think that would add even greater depth to an already brilliant game, but it is what it is, and what it is is brilliant.

In my opinion, it's easily a 9/10. (Add that meta campaign in, devs, and I'll give it a 10! :D)",1421627479,1421627479,True,7,0,0.569527387619018555,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It may be cruel at times by that give this undecidable feeling of survival, do i go here a risk turrets or go through the nearly destroyed areas and risk slowest and pain.

(Game version: v1.2.3)
In a nutshell: 

Imagine you are the leader of a group of derelict ships scavengers sitting in your command capsule somewhere, and the latest in scanning technology only allows you to see the internal structure of the ship and detect any life forms as blips on the screen. Other than their natural response to shoot at any hostiles they encounter, provided they can detect said hostiles, your crew depends on your radio-transmitted orders to navigate them through the interior of these long-dead ships. You might not be able to see what your crew sees, but you will definitely be able to hear ghost echoes and phantom screams through the radio transmitter.

Deadnaut is a real-time, squad-based tactical (and almost simulation) game which should be played in the dark so as to immerse in, and appreciate the ambience presented by the game setting. Random generation and various dynamic factors  provides replayability, but a relatively short campaign only gives a sense of accomplishment upon completion but would not quite give you the euphoric fist-into-the-air kind of feeling. 

Gameplay: 

A campaign consists of only 4 missions, and each mission might take between 20 minutes to 30 mins to complete depending on how thorough you want to explore the ships. However, players are likely to spend more time on planning and suiting up for the missions. Primary interaction are the usual right-click to move, left-click to interact with doors and computers, and middle-mouse (or Ctrl-left click) to activate personal item like sensors, and to project shields. A large portion of the game is randomly generated, from different hostiles with strengths and weaknesses, to the blueprints of equipment you might come across. If you prefer so, you can start playing with a randomly generated crew of 5, each with their own character traits and flaws, which might or might not sit well with the rest of the team. The class of a character is largely dependent on the equipment, and although character traits predispose them to a certain role, flaws might raise conflict against that very same role (e.g. a combat-centric grunt that does not like combat nor be around dead bodies). Alternatively you can customize your own crew, so as to improve your odds very slightly. Investigating the dead bodies scattered around the ship yields ‘knowledge’ about what had befallen upon the ship’s crew, and ‘knowledge’ acts as a form of currency to acquire new weapons and equipments. The dynamics of all these random factors provides an open field that tests players on their ability to make do with what’s available and adapt the appropriate tactics. 

Aesthetics:

The somber color scheme is only fitting for a game of such tense nature but for a game with minimal graphical stimulus, the audio warrants special mention as being very much up to the task of putting you on edge of your chair. Crank up the audio and the random shrieks during radio-silence of space will sends goose bumps up crawling on your skin. The UI is reminiscent of a submarine (or in this case subspace) command chair and is very much simulator-like, with many buttons to click on, switches to flip and several monitors to look at, including heart rate and brain wave monitors of individual squad members. All these features add to the immersion factor by providing background and flavor reading material. 

Final word:

Deadnaut is a very interesting game with a slightly niche market, likely appealing to those who values immersion over graphics. That said, the game contain the essences of game longevity; dynamic randomness and replay value. The short campaign encourages strategic planning with available resources, but does leave one with a desire for more missions. On the other hand, having a long campaign runs into eventual content exhaustion whereby players will have everything available towards the end, and thus causing players to gradually lose interest and shelving the game until their next craving for a game with similar nature. It’s almost like a choice to have your favorite food as a snack everyday versus stuffing yourself to your heart’s content.

To put it mildly this game is not for everyone, it can be rather slow paced at times as with many good tactics games where you must take your team of units from a to be without any of them dying, and it shows of something that i keep saying time and time again, ""you do not need graphics intensive visuals to make your game good"" it has a simple set up with some rather nice texture work but i have seen better while at the same time i have seen far, far worse. This game i feel hits its marks faily well when it comes to atmosphere and the ""lore"" You command a team of ""Deadnauts"" who's task it is to investigate derelict vessels and then recover the ships log to determine how they ended up abandoned and unresponsive, you do this from your ship which has three screens that you can switch between as if you were acctually sitting infront of them. Now i dont know if you have seen many sci fi horror scenes but this game plays out like the most cliche one i have ever seen...but this is a VEEEEERRRY good thing. The graphics are primarily icons on a screen in a semi 3d space that you make these icons navigate through and deal with obstacles and...what remains of the crew. This backed up with the text communications of your team and you have some very evil imagery. For example on one mission my team entered a room where two of my deadnauts got jumped by aliens and dragged into the corridor leaving my last member fighting off two larger aliens by himself, they were then killed and the screen died with the message ""signal lost"". that was one of the most horrifying experiences i have had in a game and i enjoyed every minute of it.

Но мне она не понравилась. Причин тому несколько.

1) Интерфейс сделано ""под реализм"" - типа ты сидишь в каком-то шатле и управляешь своими бойцами. На практике это означает что то, что в других игрушках занимает весь экран, в этой занимает кружочек в центре экрана. И в этому кржочке не то чтобы ничего не видно, но глаза приходиться напрягать изрядно. Плюс еще время от времени изображение начинает покрываться помехами и/или солдаты перестают слушаться прикзов (типа, помехи в сигнале). В 99% случаях это НИЧЕГО не меняет (просто надоедает), в оставшемся же 1% - верная смерть.
Еще одна проблема такого интерфейса - враги. Они все отображаются одинаковыми красными кружочками (ну, может размер отличается). То есть понять что за враг достаточно сложно, соответственно, сложно выбирать приоритеты для атаки (очень ""помогает"" отсутствие актвиной паузы). Я личино никогда даже не пробовал менять цели: солдаты на месте, им виднее по кому стрелять.
Ну, и по мелочи - трудно читать описания (сливаются с фоном), трудно одевать солдат (интерфейс инвентаря делит место с интерфейсом характеристик солдат).

2) Нет туториала. Разрабы типа говорят - читайте мануал у нас на сайте. Ну, прочитал. У меня это заняло час. Тогда как банальные всплывающие подсказки и еще пара информационных экранов (тех, что всплывают в первой миссии) позволила бы разобраться за 5 минут. Если это тоже сделано в угоду реализму, то, как по мне, оно того не стоит.

3) Отношения между людьми. Это одна из ""фишек"", перенсенная из предыдущей игры студии. Суть в том, что если двое солдат друг друга не любят, то они могут получить на некоторое время минус к навыками. В итоге - либо разделяешь людей на группы (что очень негатвино сказывается на их эффектвиности и требует куда больше микроменеджмента), либо через каждые три минуты стоишь и ждешь, пока спадет эффект от этой фигни.

В итоге - вроде бы и не плохо, но через часик глаза начинают болеть от попыток прочитать очередной кусок светло-коричневого текста на темно-коричневом фоне, а потом прибегает толпа маленьких красных кружочков и сьедает твоего любимого хакера, на которого ты просто не успел кинуть щит.

Each ship is randomly generated which gives it a rouge-like element. It is also about dying a lot but that is okay because the games go fast and easy.

You are playing the squad commander from your safe control hub back on the ship. The interface takes getting used to but I wouldn't change it at this point. You turn dials to boost power, you press buttons that click and you have to look away from the action to access information. It adds a touch of realism and a low-tech science fiction vibe like the first Alien movie.

I am usually terrible at real time games but Deadnaut is fairly generous. The squad will shoot at anything hostile and if guns won't kill something then well, nothing you can order them to do is going to help much. I die a lot in this game but it is because of poor planning and not my crappy reflexes.

Be sure to visit the manual web page and even then, I reccomend starting with a squad of five fighters. Get the hang of the controls, get squashed and then slowly add the other classes. There is no tutorial and it throws you into the deep end but after two hours I felt confident with all the options present.

First attempt at playing, I try to create a custom crew. I was unable to access any of the custom face pics that are available to auto generated crew, so I quit out of the game and downloaded pics of Jagged Alliance mercs from google. I put all the effort into creating a crew, but they quickly died in the first mission because I didn't have enough mercs good at combat.

Second attempt at playing, I allow the game to generate the crew for me. There wasn't a single merc generated for me that was good at hacking, so I ignored that aspect of the game altogether. The mercs kept bitching about each other with repetitive dialogue, and that seemed to affect their stats. However, I quickly realised that the best way to beat this game was to ignore the bitching and just keep the mercs bunched together, as ultimately it came down to superior firepower being enough to get through the whole FOUR levels of the game! The whole ""watcher"" interference mechanic was an interesting aspect of the game, but all it did was occasionally distort the screen or leave me unable to issue orders for a few seconds. As I ignored hacking there was no way I could defend against the watchers, but this made no difference to me getting through the game easily.

Some people have compared this game to Jagged Alliance; the reality is this game doesn't come close. There are only four levels, the merc dialogue is repetitive and boring, and the mercs really don't have any personality. All of the ship's crew logs are randomly generated, and ultimately this game has no story to uncover, just get through the four levels until you reach the game over screen. In my second attempt of the game not a single merc was killed, it was simply a case of methodically clearing all four ships of the bad guys by keeping my group together, Not fun at all.",1419047385,1419047385,False,9,0,0.556882858276367188,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When I bought Dreadnaut and entered the game, I didn't expect much based on the trailers available. It seemed just like all those top-down squad RTS games, which there are hundreds of. It was only 10 euros, so I decided to jump it and test it out.

I immediately reached out for the character creation. I've always been one for creating my own party/character, since the game experience feels a lot more personal. The character creation has two minor bugs, which I did not realize were bugs until I read the forums for a tutorial on character creation. The bugs:

[list]
[*]You cannot proceed ""Early Career"" -phase without having at least 1 extra point.
[*]Selecting flaw [b]Attention Seeker[/b] bugs out, so it disappears from the list, making it impossible to deselect.
[/list]

Other than that, the character creating didn't seem to be that extensive, but it lets you fleck out certain bits of personality on the character. There are a certain set of different charasteristics you get to choose, if you want to spend a point on them. For example, ""He likes combat, he doesn't like ruined rooms, he likes tight corridors"" etc.

It took me nearly 2 hours to flesh out my squad consisting of five Deadnauts. After that, I finally got into the game. And oh boy, here comes the best part...

The game itself plants you, the ""Commander"" in the charge of leading your squad through those derelict ships, looking for whatever the mission is. On the way, you collect [b]Knowledge[/b], which is the currency in this game, from bodies, artifacts, killing enemies and simply finding new rooms. After you've finished your mission, which might be ""Destroy artifacts"", ""recover ship's log"", ""eliminate all resistance"" or something along those lines, you simply reach your starting room's [b]Escape Hatch[/b] or you use any of those you might've found during your search on the ship. The combat is pretty straightforward. You say where your guys go, your guys (might not) do that, and when they reach there they shoot the baddies IF THEY SEE THEM. You better pack a scanner with you, because those damn Spectres are near invisible. You can also manually target a single enemy, which gives you a great freedom on choosing the most important target first.

Now, why should you call this [i]creepy[/i]? Because the goddamn soundtrack is goddamn creepy. All those howls, yells, screams and growls make my hairs stand up. They sound extremely authentic. You're a commander behind a radio, giving orders to your squad, when you suddenly hear your squad firing their weapons, and you hear loud, unnatural screech. Your squad starts backing away, but on the comms, a message, ""We've lost Johns!"". Soon the enemy, whatever the hell it was, lies dead on the ground. Your squad makes your way through the derelict ship, completing their mission and encountering little resistance. However, when you're heading back to the escape hatch, you encounter one last enemy. Again, on the comms arrives a message. ""Wait, is that Johns?"" as you notice your squad starts rupturing apart like flies.

This game is minimalistic on the graphical side, although the UI with the scanners, character profiles and information screens are just like you would expect on a high-tech commander's station on a spaceship. The UI isn't that user-friendly, and takes a lot of getting used to. It is confusing at first, but when you learn how to use it, it becomes effective. Replayability on this game is a huge 10/10, since the missions are dynamically generated. The story, the enemies you encounter, the ships you go on, the stuff that happens, it's generated. Aside from the bugs on the character creation, I haven't encountered any major bugs in game. You can import your own character portraits, which is great for more personality.

My personal score for this game is 8/10, and a place for top 10 games of 2014 on my list. It isn't on the top 5 of the games, but it is still high. This game is for dedicated rogue-like fans, with lots of imagination and patience to get through the not-so-userfriendly firsthand experience.

The missions are randomly generated, meaning you'll never hit the same ship twice, and the enemies are widely varied.

If you want to try this game, but are for some reason not interested enough to invest the $10, there is a demo that can be found on the website for the game-deadnaut.com. However, the gameplay will be much more challenging than that of the base game, because of a reduced squad size.

Pros-

-Very unique UI and aproach to an RTS styled game
-Incredibly atmospheric and immersive, in a minimalist style that really drove the point home.
-Just the right balance of difficulty, while very difficult to learn, once you get in the groove of things you will have more success, but not too much.
-Reasonable length, each campaign is only four missions, which, while leaving you wanting more, makes restarting much less of a loss as far as real time goes, but still grievous enough to make you regret each mistake.

Cons-

-The tutorial really leaves a lot to be learned, which some will enjoy, but will deter some players. There is a manual on the game's home page that goes much more in-depth about the mechanics, but it is not mentioned in-game.
-It feels very brief the first time you finish. I did not know that the campaign was only 4 missions long, and upon completion I immediately had the pang of sorrow I feel each time I complete and FTL run-""But I only just started playing!"".
-Some of the more mundane parts of exploration do get a bit routine after a few runs, primarily investigating corpses and the like, but they are still worth it to gather knowledge.

The goal in this game is simple, you have four missions to complete, each one introducing a new procedurally generated enemy type somehow related to the theme of that mission. After the first three missions you can us the knowledge (the game's currency obtained through exploration and investigation) you gained to purchase schematics from Earth. To my knowledge these are randomly chosen, but not procedurally generated.

The first thing you need to learn about this game is its UI, it presents itself as if you really were giving orders to a crew exploring a derelict ship. For starters, all you ever see of your squad is a profile picture (you can import one yourself if you like), and an icon on the main viewer. You start out with limited equipment and no knowledge of any of your enemies, as you fight and study your foes, you learn more about them... in what way they sense your crew, how they damage them, and how they defend themselves will all be learned, in time.

The only downside I see to this game is that it is only in four mission bursts, and yet at the same time it makes it more bearable. I say this because, as a game in which every decision can take an excellent run to disaster, I worry that if the campaigns ran for too long, each mistake would only become more and more infuriating, and then the game just stops being as fun, but I do feel that the campaign is a touch too short. Perhaps an option to adjust the length of the campaign, with an adjustment to progression for longer campaigns.

Overall I would definitely recommend this as it is a great game at an incredible price. It offers a very unique outlook on the RTS genre that I would love to see occur more often. I would love to see a bit more built on this game from the devs, a handful of new game modes.

There is much more I would like to say about this game, but I will leave it to you to discover in an attempt a brevity.",1418286521,1420651082,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Roguelike的なランダム要素を備えた宇宙船探索RTSです。
プレイヤーは探索チームのリーダーとして、隊員に指示を出しながら探索を進めていきます。
緊張感のあるプレイが楽しめますよ！

良い所：
・バランスのとれたランダム性
進行に合わせた難度の上昇、欲しい装備が手に入らないもどかしさなどなど、ランダム要素が良い味を出してます。

イマイチな所：
・変化のバラエティに乏しい
宇宙船の構造、装備の性能、敵の能力。繰り返しプレイしていると段々新鮮味がなくなってきます。ゲームバランスとの兼ね合いもあるので大きな変化は難しいとは思いますが。

以下、特徴的な部分について紹介していきます。

・物語
宇宙に進出した地球人類はエイリアンの宇宙船に遭遇します。しかし、その乗組員は全員死亡していました。何がエイリアン達を死に追いやったのか。原因を探るために調査チーム「Deadnaut」が派遣されることになります。プレイヤーはチームのリーダーとしてこの謎を解明しなければなりません。

・ゲームシステム
1回のプレイは4つのミッションで構成され、キャンペーンと呼ばれます。4つのミッションをクリアすることでキャンペーンのクリア、すなわちゲームのクリアとなります。
各ミッションは全て異なる船で行われるため、キャンペーンを通して4つの宇宙船を探索することになります。宇宙船の構造、損傷具合、セキュリティの強度、敵の種類、ミッションの目的などはランダムに決まりますが、キャンペーンの進行に合わせて段階的に難しくなるようになっています。

・ミッション
ミッション中はRTS風の操作になります。プレイヤー自身は自分の宇宙船に残り、エイリアンの宇宙船に乗り込んだ5人の隊員に随時指示を出してミッション完遂を目指します。
センサーで扉の向こうを探る、敵を攻撃する、ハッキングを行うなどなど、状況に合わせた的確な指示が必要になります。

・敵
物語のところでも書きましたが、Deadnautに攻撃してくる敵はエイリアンではありません。エイリアン達を殺した「何か」です。
キャンペーンスタート時点では敵に関する情報は皆無です。戦闘をこなしたりエイリアンの残した情報を調べたりすることで徐々に正体が明らかになります。敵の能力や弱点はキャンペーン毎にランダムに決まるため、同じ名前でも同じ能力とは限りません。また、キャンペーン中は複数種類の敵と遭遇することになります。さらには船内の環境に応じて強くなったり弱くなったりもします。

・セキュリティシステム
エイリアン達は死亡しましたが、宇宙船のセキュリティはまだ生きています。Deadnautは「侵入者」であるためにセキュリティシステムが探索を妨害してきます。開いた扉を閉める、タレットで攻撃する、隊員との通信を妨害する。それ単体ではさほど脅威ではなくとも、敵との組み合わせで致命的な状況を生み出します。
セキュリティの中で何に重点が置かれているのかは突入前に確認が可能で、事前に対策を立てることが出来ます。

・戦闘
隊員は視界に入った敵を自動的に攻撃します。センサーを活用して視界を広げることで戦闘を有利に運べます。
注意を要するのは船体の損傷です。流れ弾が当たるイメージですね。状態の悪化した部屋にいる隊員は環境ダメージを受けます。さらに、宇宙船全体の状態が悪化すると爆発四散、隊員の全滅でゲームオーバーになってしまいます。
グレネードランチャーのご利用は計画的に。

・前作との比較
Zafehouse Diariesに比べて総じて楽しくなっていると思います。前作で不満に思ったのはプレイヤーが介入できる余地が少ない点でした。生存者グループの人間関係が最重要課題なのに、そこに干渉する手段がほとんど無い。
今作では装備の選択、ミッション中の操作や判断に応じて結果が変わっていると実感できます。これならあれこれ試行錯誤するのも楽しい。
批判的な書き方になりましたが、前作のZafehouse Diariesも捻りが効いていて面白いですよ！

お金や装備、隊員の死亡など書きたいことは多いのですが、とりあえずこの辺りで。

A VERY early review. Literally had two attempts at the first mission, and died both of them. (Should've rolled my own characters, I guess, and not relied on random ones!)

But so far it's utterly compelling - a very different take on the usual roguelike or Space Hulk-type games. The display screen system is inspired, the graphics are clean and incredibly good, and it's definitely going to get a lot more play going on. I especially like the character generation system and some of the in-game comms (both the character banter and having to tweak the system power to reduce interference). Sound is atmospheric, controls are fairly intuitive, and whilst it's a touch unconventional, it really is a bargain.

I've only scratched the surface of Deadnaut so far, but it's looking to be a corking indie title. Well worth a try.",1418255864,1418255864,True,6,0,0.549561679363250732,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Don't be put off by the real-time aspect of the game, your Deadnauts aren't idiots and will automatically fire at any hostiles they detect. ***

Searching derelict ships from ancient civilizations in deep space is pretty much as deadly as it sounds, however, a well balanced party with the appropriate equipment can brave the dangers and emerge relatively unscathed.  While your first few attempts might result in you getting your party horribly maimed, a little attentiveness and situational awareness will go a long way and allow you to play an entire game with no casualties.  Make your own party and name them after friends and family, and if they die, no worries!  You can clone them!  Just don't get too attached to the clone...

There will be incredibly tense moments in game that are not arbitrarily forced on you via a streamlined story and can't be replicated every game you play.  Each ship has it's own challenges and enemies that can potentially shorten your life span.  Since enemies, loot, and ship layout changes with each new campaign, there is no reliable way to game the meta and ensure victory each play through.  

Between traditional zombie-like space enemies that want to disembowel you, giant Sentinels (laser turrets!) that can gun down your entire party in a matter of seconds, and artifical intelligence programs known as Watchers that are essentially cyber ninjas patrolling the ship's network you have your work cut out for you.  Running around guns blazing might work in one campaign and get you killed within five minutes in another.

Imagine the following scenario : Your hearty crew breach a new room and as they cautiously advance are suddenly swarmed on nearly all sides by almost a dozen enemies.  Fear sets in and bullets fly in every direction, your non-combat oriented Deadnauts not having the best accuracy under the pressure.  Inadvertently, the stray rounds bounced around the room far more than recommended and comprimised the structural integrity of the room you're in.  Life support fails and your crew is mercilessly exposed to the vacuum of space.  You quickly dart towards the door you just entered from, when unexpectedly, your video feed dies, you can't issue orders to your men because your audio feed has been cut, and the door they're attempting to reach has been sealed.  Congratulations, a roaming Watcher just ruined your day because you forgot to install a firewall earlier to counter it.

The watcher can't maintain the jam for a long period of time, and your audio/visual feed comes back just in time for you to realize the majority of your party is at half life from standing in the destroyed section of the ship.  Your Deadnaut hacker hauls ass to the door, opens it, and everyone throws themselves into the safety of the adjoining room.  Or maybe everyone dies horribly because your hacker got dragged off and flayed earlier.  Unfortunately, it takes 15 seconds to open the sealed door and everybody dies in the mean time.

That is just a sample of the fun you can expect!

As far as party composition goes, your crew of five's roles are determined by the type of suit they're wearing, as it will allocate different slots for equipment in weapons, tech, sensors, or protection.  When you complete missions, find blueprints on the ships you're searching, or purchase new ones on the marketplace afterwards, you might have a suit with slots for weapons and tech.  This changes each game, however, and the slots each type of suit has is different every time.

But just because there is no class system in Deadnaut's does not mean you're going to assign a dumb grunt the role as the group's techie responsible for deactivating turrets or installing firewalls to keep Watchers off your back.  Characters have four stats that correspond with eight abilities, and where an interesting aspect of the game comes into play is character creation.  You can customize your roster of Deadnaut's to fulfill specific roles.  

These aren't going to be Master Chief's with flawless personalities and sparkly clean criminal records, since only the desperate or deranged would seek what usually amounts to a one way trip into deep space aboard alien derelict ships.  If you want a character with extra stats to allocate you're going to have to decide if you want to assign them extra flaws, such as taking stims without being ordered or maybe they periodically steal money from the group.  Is that trade off worth the extra firepower?

At the end of the day this game offers a lot for $10 and while I probably won't be investing 100s of hours into it, I've enjoyed the short time I've spent and will log more later.  For me it scratches an itch and even reminds me a bit of Firefly, in the way that you have a motley crew, all with different motivations, just trying to make ends meat in the darkest corners of the galaxy.


Pros :

- A unique game that pulls no punches, you're punished for your mistakes and rewarded for careful planning and positioning.

- The game changes with each campaign, one might have you searching medical ships discovering what went wrong, while others will have you salvaging military warships with active turrets around every corner.

- Good amount of character customization, I was able to reconstruct my family with pretty accurate detail (or, what our futuristic Deadnaut alter egos would be).  Each Deadnaut had their place in my party and if one of them died it made the mission harder.

- Intense atmosphere, the sound is well done and when alarms start going off, you start to panic.


Cons:

- Even after reading the manual it still took trial and error in game to figure out what was happening and how to use abilities in game.  It didn't take very long, but it could be a potential source of frustration.

- While the atmosphere is pretty interesting, the crew logs aren't particularly intense and are repetitive.  Once you've read the log of one ship, you've pretty much read them all.

- Replayability might be questionable for some people.  My first successful campaign completion took 2 hours, and my second one took barely 66 minutes.  That doesn't mean I'm done with the game, however, as each campaign has individual challenges and I've only succeeded on about 2 out of 9 attempts.  Others might finish one campaign and be done though.

- Confusing relationship mechanics.  I couldn't tell why one of my characters with high cohesion (the charisma stat) was hated by everyone else.  Sometimes your characters mesh really well together, and other times they start fighting within minutes of a new campaign, even with the likeable trait.


TL;DR = Even if the game doesn't receive substantial updates, this is a game worth trying if you're into strategy games or rogue likes/lites.  Or dying surrounded by friends and family on an alien ship in deep space sounds really fun.",1418187474,1418307501,True,77,1,0.854701995849609375,1,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is absolutely brutal the first few times out, what with there being no in-game tutorial to advise you on how to survive and what to do.  With that said, I feel compelled to learn more and master its secrets namely because I love the idea of managing a team that is tasked with exploring a derelict.  The control panel (where you issue your team orders and view their status) was well done and had a ""B"" movie feel about it.  There is a character creator similar to the one found in Zafehouse Diaries (same developers) and I plan to play around with that feature as well.  My advice is to check out the manual before buying the game to learn more about it and to see if it's something you'd be interested in playing.

I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with it right now and I mean that in a very good way. I love it for the atmosphere, the asthetic, the tense moment-to-moment gameplay, the customization for your crew and the unrelenting difficult of the game. At the same time, the unrelenting difficult of the game also makes me hate it. I don't mean hate as in 'despise' it, I mean hate as in me going through a mission carefully and methodically and either making a mistake or getting a bad room and completely wiping after several successful missions. All it takes is one slip up and the entire campaign can be over! This definitely isn't a game for people who don't embrace the 'Losing is fun' mindset that comes with many roguelikes and games such as Dwarf Fortress. I have more speciifc thoughts that I'll list below.

The atmosphere and aesthetic of this game is fantastic. You, the player, are a character in the game. Specifically, you are the overseer of the Deadnauts, your crew of five you send on missions to derelict ships to discover just what happened on board the ship in question as well as to complete various missions, like recovering data from the ship, restoring power to the ship to initiate a sterilization procedure, destroying mysterious artifacts on board and so on. To this end, you use the games UI to order the Deadnauts about. The UI resembles something you'd see onboard a submarine, with a radar screen with all sorts of switches and knobs and whatnot controlling various functions of your display. It's very 'hard sci-fi' with plenty of retro love thrown in. Perhaps retro isn't the right word. It's along the lines of the type of equipment you'd see on board the Nostromo from Alien, only more primitive. This display is your only window into the world your crew is entering. It gives you all information you need to know in the form of health displays for your crew, a log window and a chat window to show your objectives and your crew's responses to what is happening and the center view screen, which gives you a very light but detailed look into the action with each of your crew members represented by their last name and first initial and the Deadnaut insignia. Here, you move them around and instruct them to interact with the environment-things like opening and closing doors, unlocking doors, investigating objects and bodies, initiating hacks, attacking hostiles and so on.

Since you are not actually with the crew and are instead onboard the Deadnaut ship supervising the mission from afar, there are many ways for the display to fail. It will never fail completely, of course, but there are forms of interference that can and will affect your ability to issue orders to your crew as well as to see just what is happening within the derelict ship. These different types of interference can be something within your control or something out of your control. An example of one within your control is a Flaw that you can take for one of your crew to get more points to customize them that causes the Deadnaut in question to occasionally interfere with the display, causing static to flicker across the screen and some lag to occur between what is actually happening and what your scanner is telling you is happening. As well, for one that is out of your control, certain enemies can interfere with your scanners when they are nearby your crew. This can provide some really tense moments when your display is washed out with static and you are left not knowing just what is happening.

The customization for the Deadnauts is great. When making a character, you start off at their birth by allocating points to the four stats in game Vigor-physical ability-, Acuity-accuracy and detection ability-, Wits-intelligence and hacking ability-and Grit-mental fortitude and cooperation ability-. You then move onto their education, which has you spending points to pick what kind of education they received. The different typs of education provide training in specfic stats. After that, you move onto their early career and select a flaw to give you more points that you will need to select what kind of training they have received. Again, what kind of training they receive provides training in particular stats that will decide what your character will specialize in. It is absolutely possible to either go with a general 'jack/jill of all trades' type character that will be good at everything for you to fall back on if a specialist dies or run with a full crew of specialists at certain tasks. After the Early Career, you can save the character and use them right away. You can also choose to select their Late Career and their Wisdom, both of which also provide further training and bonuses to the character to make them better at what they do while also forcing you to take more flaws to be able to afford these abilities. Once you have a full crew of five Deadnauts, you are able to jump into the game. If you do not wish to create your own Deadnauts, you also have the ability to just jump right in with Deadnauts created by the game.

So far, I can't get enough of this game. I have written quite a lot about everything I love about it. I suppose now I'll have to talk about what I dislike about it. While the punishing difficulty is certainly fun and I certainly feel that it is a core aspect of the game and it's 'one more run' type of gameplay, it can also be unfair at times. More often than not, if you end up losing a crew member or getting a wipe, it is your own fault for not being more careful as far as scouting out a room and ensuring that those crew members of yours that are better suited to taking hits for the team and returning them are out in front or rushing into a room and having a defensive turret open fire on your crew and kill them, there are times when the randomly generated nature of the game can rear it's ugly head and remind you that randomly generated levels and such aren't always a good thing. I recall one campaign where I started the mission, opened the first door and before I even stepped through the door, a turret on the otherside of the door with a clear line of sight to the only exit to the inital room of the ship opened fire and killed two of my crew. There was no way to get around it so I ended up quitting and starting a new campaign. Stuff like that hasn't happened a ton for me but it has happened. This is when the game's difficulty goes from 'punishing' to 'unfair'. It doesn't happen often, as I said, but it would be nice if stuff like that could be prevented from happening. If there was another exit to the room then alright, that was my bad for opening the wrong door. With only the one exit and what is basically an instant kill turret aiming at the doorway, though, there isn't much I can do other than quit and start a new game.

Don't let that last bit deter you, though. If you like tough, challenging games, games within the 'rougelike' genre and games that demand that you play them one more time for a better run, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It is a fantastic experience and one I will continue to enjoy. For the price as well, it's hard to beat. If any of this sounds like something you might like, I hope you come to enjoy it soon enough as well.",1418160873,1418315429,True,5,0,0.542030513286590576,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- A good range of customization and tactical planning.

DO NOT READ PAST HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GAME ELEMENTS TO BE SPOILED---------

A few key bothers I have because the game is so short:

- Crew morale and relationships is a dynamic that slowly deteriorates after each mission. I thought that I would need to worry about this in the long run and try to be very efficient in my mission times before my crew started killing each other. However, the campaign ended before I saw any of that become a factor. A main factor of the game is these derelect spaceships causing crew members to go insane. Isn't that something I should worry about happening to my team as well?

- There's a wide variety of weapon types and similarly defense types. It goes from standard, light, medium, to heavy.
... I finished the game just as I got my first Heavy items. I was still using tier 2 weapons on the last mission, no problem. Not only that, Because it was my first run though, I just defaulted to run and gun, simple weapon choices and keeping my group together at all times. I expected to eventually be outsmarted or something, but it never happened. If I can just muscle my way through this game, what's the point?

- Crew deaths. you only get 5 crew members in this game. If one dies, you can clone him again for a cost of credits and also a significant hit to his or her stats. It was a terrifying revalation, and I was incredibly worried that deaths late in the game would cost me a victory, but I beat the game shortly after my very first death. This factor would be a lot more terrifying if I actually had to worry about long-term effects of making a mistake and losing a crew member.

- Storyline. Once again, this is probably one of the best elements of the game. Everything they do is kind of perfectly built around the ability to set the mood for this story, but just as I was getting curious about where the plot would go, it ended. ""Congrats, you found all the things. Have a gold star."" What? There was no closer to this storyline, just me making money, spending that money on better gear, and going on a harder mission thereafter for more money (rinse and repeat.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, great potential, but a let down in the end. This could've gone so much further and been so much greater. 6.5/10 is my rating, but up until the ""Campaign complete"" screen it was going on a solid 9/10.

Hopefully in the future Screwfly can add a little more meat to the game before sending it out.

Finally, I don't regret paying $8 for this, but if they had filled in the holes, this game could be worth at least $30 in my book. It reminds me of great old strategy games like fallout and dungeon keeper with the creepy setting and unforgiving cost of messing up.",1418156719,1418156745,True,6,0,0.531343340873718262,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yet in another campaign you may be contending with the possessed remains of a former crew driven insane by unknown artifacts, behemoths throwing your soldiers around as artifacts obscure your command and control with horrifying visions of death and torture.

Deadnaut's is a game that wants to immerse you in its universe. Your hud looks akin to something from a WW2 submarine simulation and your control over your soldiers is sketchy at the best of times. There are a large amount of things to take into consideration with Deadnaut's and many ways for those under your command to come to harm or die, this may be the one area the game faulters in. It is a real time tactical squad based game, essentially a rogue like.

So what do you do? You command five ""deadnauts"" as you scour decaying alien ships from a long gone era. Your objective is typically to figure out what happend to the crew, learn more about this civilization and clear out any hostile remnants, examining the dead crew and reading their logs. Your characters are divided into four seperate roles, a Assaulter, Shielder, Hacker and Scanner. Assaulters carry the big guns and are more hardy, however too much firepower could result in you destroying a section of the ship if not outright blowing up the ship. Shielders can project a powerful shield onto your deadnaut's, as well as allow your men to move through area's of the ship with no air, however they lack on offensive firepower being forced to only use pistols or knives. Hackers can hack into the ships systems, open locked doors, establish firewalls and alter the ships power levels, creating two whole levels of combat between the ship's anti-virus systems and its ""crew"". Finally the Scanner can scan areas of the ship to locate hidden enemies and for you to plan out your attack.

Your charactes can be customised fully, and have unique, and random, backgrounds and relationships. You may get one crew who are all on good terms with one another, or one that is divided into two groups and hates the other. Character creation is in depth with you assigning points to areas to boost their statistics, you can get more points by applying negative traits to your character.

The ship itself is dying and decaying, parts of the ship may have no lifesupport and its defence systems are in a varying state of readness. The ship itself has several ways of defending itself. Doors are its first line of defence, simply closing them or keeping them locked can slow you down, the second level of defence are Watcher's, moving programs that will attempt to undo any hacks you've made, so closing doors you've opened for example. The final level of defence are sentinal turrets, extreamly lethal but they can be hacked to your side, until a Watcher reverts the hack.

The actual enemies themselves also vary, as you would expect from a roguelike. Fast moving aliens, zombified crewmembers, etheral ghosts, plague carriers and much more. Each enemie type has to be respected and observerd to determin their weaknesses. Some may die from a single bullet from a ballistic firearm, others may be impervious to bullets but not to lasers. Some might be hidden to your sight but your scanners can pick them out easily, they may move through walls or drag your men away from you. There are many combinations that will keep you on your toes.

However, for all the good I can talk about this game, it does have downsides, like any game good or bad.

Death can be quick and sudden, and the difficulty can vary from easy to impossible at times. You may enter a room only to see all your men drop dead instantly. The game is also glitchy, some time's you may not be able to select something to examine in game, or log entries will be jumbled or unselectable. Losing control of your soldiers can also be frustrating, having your men decided to run away and get killed because of a misclick or some wierd personality trait that caues them to ignore your orders.

There is also no real in game tutorial, just some one off tool tips. There is a manual that you can read (and I highly recommend you do) but even that can be hit and miss.

The game is also heavily RNG dependant. You may never recieve the tools on the market, meaning if the enemies are vulnerable to Beam Cold weapons, yet you may never be able to buy a Beam Cold weapon. Also you may never recieve vital equipment like uprgraded suits.

However, at 10$ this is a solid game that is very immersing. There is a lot to do and see, a wide range of tactics to apply and a lot of replayability. It can be frustrating but at the same time your skill can surmount many obsticals.

I only wish the game had more to do, such as a XCOM style game of sending out Deadnaut's to difference areas in space to explore and more of a metagame. Or even just a way to carry over a team from one campaign to another. Nonetheless, this game is fun.",1418141427,1418292078,True,15,1,0.603766858577728271,0,True,False,False,False,,,

---

Deadnaut's concept has real potential, and the devs nailed the visuals/audio here in my opinion - a wonderful cramped aesthetic combined with atmospheric sounds and visual effects really creates a claustrophobic feeling and oozes tension, whilst allowing the devs to utilise a very minimal graphics set for the primary ""gameplay"" portion, fleshing it out with the logs you find and the descriptions of the enemies you encounter that you'll analyse between missions.

Most of the ""tactical"" portion comes in determining how to leverage your squad's innate skills with the available equipment and dealing with whatever negative traits they have. This isn't as much fun as it sounds - I've not found any reason other than people not getting along to want to split your squad up (there doesn't appear to be any other tactical advantage to doing so - the squad that stays together has an innate firepower advantage), so it feels a bit like a forced carryover from Zafehouse that probably could have been left out, or the relationship factors made an optional ""bigger challenge"" difficulty.

Combat feels a little uninspiring - your guys will exchange fire/blows with the enemy, and whether you've kitted them out properly (in accordance with the intelligence you've collected in previous outings) is going to be the primary determinant of success, meaning if you screwed that portion up, there's no way you're going to recover. I'm yet to make it past the second mission in each set of four though, so I might be missing elements that get introduced later.

Exploring was great fun at first, but I was hoping for a bit more variation in what you find on ships - every single ""investigate"" icon I've clicked on has been a crew corpse - some more descriptive flavour text from your troops on what they see when they enter a room would probably also make it feel less like I'm exploring the same randomly chained set of rooms over and over.

I'd love to see this fleshed out further in a sequel - perhaps with an XCOM style ""base"" mechanic, where you send Deadnauts off to explore derelicts, research tech, and lose hundreds of ""volunteers"" in the process, perhaps collecting information that will stop you suffering the same fate as the aliens whose ships you explore.

In summary - much like Zafehouse, it's a great concept that draws you in, but some of the execution will leave you wishing parts were more fleshed out.",1418127288,1418127288,False,222,1,0.891319572925567627,1,False,False,False,False,,,

You are the captain of greath intersteller salavage ship 
Your mission will be diffrent eachtime often suicidel
Your enamies wont be easy nor the same
Your crew will be a bunch of hero's or a bunch of fools
However

Your willing to give it all inorder to become a rich legend


[b]Gameplay[/b]
The first thing that stands out in the game would be the Ship Command panal ( Interface)
This really give's you the feeling you are in charge of a old salvage ship and you have
to managed your missions & crew & database.

Durning missions you will face random problems like radios malfunctions to interfance storms 
ussualy if the captain ( player) deals with them cool headed, he will be able to solve most
upcoming problems, however sometime's one small ship malufction could lead to the dead of your team

This will make the game more tenste & interesting ontop of that you will allso have to deal with
the aliens, you will come across diffrent kinds and each of them is diffrent some are weak against bullets
while others are slow.. However sometime's you will come across a really deathly kind and for those
you might want to try to counter becauce if you dont. . . it might cost you a couple of crew members 


[b]Storyline[/b]
The storyline is simple you are a captain of a salavage team who's going to salavege xenos vessels 
Eachtime the game will generate random background story 

the game is mostly build around the idea that you will have your own storys to tell however
i feel the game is build too mutch around this and the fact there's no voice storyteller in the game
Just saddens me

[b]Technical[/b]
The game is fairly well programmed, I dont have problems regarding frame drops and i havent encounteted game
Breaking bug

You only need a decent Ram card for the rest a simple CPU & Video card will do fine


[b]Mechancis[/b]
There are allot of random generator mechanics build into the game.
For example there is a R.G for encounters / Missions / Enamies / loot / Crew / lore

One partically interesting Random generator mechanic would be the one
that they have build for the aliens,  you will never come acorss the same kind alien 
in another campaign offering a refreshing & interesting expirance eachtime

i have Allso noticed there's a deep charater creation mode where inn you can 
add new possible Crew members for your salvage missions, The CC mode is
well build and give you the option to give a crew memeber a real background

However there are mechanics that need inprovement like combat & Ingame Acitions
they are fairly limited, Allso the loot mechanics needs inprovement 
the game simply lacks interesting loot


[b]Sound[/b]
The music & aliens & Background sounds are really well done, it slightly reminds me of watching one of those old 80 sci-fi horror movie aside from that what's allso interesting that sound plays a role in the game for example it help you reconise what kind of enammies are behind a certain doors

Gameplay 8/10

It has a great feeling of curiosity to it where you want to play more than once to see the different kinds of enemies and the different...things...that happen with some of them.

The gameplay mostly consists of top down tactical movement with your Deadnauts firing automatically. You can use certain items during combat such as a rocket launcher or a 'field' that can slow enemies or shield your allies. There's also hacking sub part that fits in pretty well with your signals being interfered with if you just ignore it, but it doesn't feel forced at the same time. There aren't a ton of graphics, but it doesn't feel like it needs them, though the small viewport does take some getting used to!

There's also a shop after missions where you trade 'knowledge' for equipment. You also get to create your own Deadnauts too which is fun in of itself. Figuring out which perks and flaws you want can take a while and makes the game more interesting. Also custom portraits so you can kill off your friends if you want.

Overall I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-fi and atmosphere and can stand dying. The game definitely has a mildly steep initial learning curve. To me the only real downside is the length of campaigns and really it's not that bad since the way the game works is that you'll want to play it multiple times.

Cons
No tutorial
Frustrating

Deadnaut, is really not an accurate name for this game as more often then not im dead again. Luckly for me i can be a glutton for punishment which this game has in spades.

Im mainly going to address my con list here as i feel like although the game has cons they are also part of the gameplay. 

No tutorial is a con simply because there is so much to understand and if you just go straight to new game you'll just die instantly with no idea why. Such as what each part of your UI does, took me three campaigns before i figured out where to see what an enemies health was, and i still dont know how to see the HP of my own crew members.

Frustrating is certianly gonna happen, mostly at the start of the game because as mentioned before there is a small amount of information given to you

Over all though it is a game i would recomend because although it is hard to understand and frustrating at times. It has the great quality of being able to make you want to play it one more time because this time you know how to do it better.",1418094563,1418094563,True,42,0,0.698421597480773926,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Okay, rogue likes, rogue lites, rogue whatevers have made not only a comback but have crept into the mainstream; these aren't just for the hardcore nerdist anymore. Deadnaut is one of the most atmospheric games in any genre I have played ever. Period. [I've been a gamer since the Amiga, Atari St, and C64 days].

Deadnaut has a gritty aesthetic, this isn't Star Trek with everything looking shiny and somewhat sterile. In fact, Deadnaut feels more ""primitive"" than being aboard the Nostromo. It sort of looks like the interior of a World War II sub yanked into the future. It feels somewhat claustrophobic and that adds to the tension. Moreover, your sensors aren't exactly Star Trek issue either. As you monitor your squad to their impending doom, the viewscreen - or port to be more accurate - will sometimes experience staic due to radiation levels. As in Alien, squad life signs are monitored and that too is rather panic inducing as you try to get your squad out of harm's way - and there is a LOT of harm lurking in these derelict ships you are exploring.

Character creation is deep. You have points to spend on each phase of each crewperson's stats. But, Deadnaut goes beyond mere D&D type stas. You are creating a sort of skeletal bio of each member. Their education earlier in ""lie"" directly impacts their performance on missions and even more interestingly it impacts how each individual squad member interacts with the rest of the squad. Yiu get a sense that these are truly mercenary type space scavengers and there is no noble quest to fulfill. 

The action is in real time though the pace is not frantic. The sensor representation of the derelicts and your crew are somewhat abstract but rather than that being a distraction, it actually adds to the atmosphere of this gem out of nowhere.

I have played as of this writing only 21 mintes or so. All but one of my squad died and we are talking perma-death here. That said, the game is not unfair as many rogue type games can be. I suppose I would call this a successful (so far) marriage of RTS, RPG, and Rogue like.

It's fun, dark, grimy, and weird - like my girlfriend but without the Satanic tattoos.

See you out there sister and brother Deadnauts!!",1418093093,1418093147,True,92,1,0.656126797199249268,11,True,False,False,False,,,
