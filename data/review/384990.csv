At only 99 cents you may be skeptical but it's a good arcade game if you like the Popeye and Kangaroo arcades though this is much more like Popeye (just as fun too). Walking around in the room to mess with stuff like the radio you can turn on for music in the room is neat but just a novelty to me. 

A really cool aspect beyond just a good arcade game is the well placed spots you can choose to for the camera to be as you play. Walk up to it and click to play like it's a item to pick up. Camera doesn't zoom into it nor transition to the game, just the game on it's screen starts and you now movement is the character instead of camera. You can zoom in your view with a button press and in the options you can select to have it just display the arcade game. 

One other really cool option in the settings is webcam for reflection. If you turn that on, it will show you on the arcade machine's screen reflection. Why is that neat? Because it looks like you are in the game standing in front of the machine playing. The way it displays the reflection makes it really look that way and not just a cheap gimmick. 

Some settings (such as sound sliders) will be off and you will want to turn those on. You have a image quality slider, bloom to turn off/on and other things so do check settings first. I turned everything on and up 100%. I have a powerful gaming laptop (MSI GE75 Raider with great specs) and while it handled it without issue, right away my fans came on at full blast like I was running a high end resource heavy game. I didn't test turn some things off and lowering quality. I played with an Xbox Elite 2 controller, worked fine.

Upon starting it up and playing it I realized this is basically the arcade game Popeye with slightly modified gameplay. Rather than collecting hearts from Olive Oyl you're collecting paper airplanes, for example. Popeye is replaced with Savvy the otter and Bluto is replaced with Gon' E-Choo Gator (whose real name is a secret spelled out by the paper airplanes you collect).

There are just three levels to the game, just like Popeye, and upon beating them you're sent back to stage one with some of the secret letter revealed to you. The more times you complete the loop of the game the more of the letter you get to read and find out more about Gon' E-Choo Gator.

Now here's where the game gets weird. Gon' E-Choo is actually a webcomic that ran for a whole year a while back. Scenes and events in this game correlate to the comic including the significance of the paper airplanes. Gon' E-Choo Gator receives a letter by way of a paper airplane and although the contents of the letter are not revealed to the reader the letter is profoundly important to the character. The contents of that letter are actually what the paper airplanes in this game spell out. In order to read the full letter you have to complete all 255 levels of the game. I suck at this game so I've never read the full contents sadly.

Overall this is an enjoyable game for the price especially if the whole ""ARG"" aspect of the game linking to the webcomic interests you. There are secrets to discover in this game that according to the developer few people have figured out. I'm not really sold on the blatant undertones of furry vore in this game because whether it's cartoony or not the developer isn't fooling anyone, lol.",1669237947,1669237947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

TLDR: Showcase level of depth for what feels like a tech demo of an arcade cabinet. Game inside that cabinet was unengaging.

You are trapped in a small room with the arcade game. There are a few decorative assets but otherwise its locked doors and a small empty room. The arcade game itself feels unsatisfying. It is sort of an atari2600 donkey kong derivative where you have to basically play cat and mouse until you fill up on collectibles. The hitboxes for capture are annoying, and you cannot actually trick jump out of reach and can only evade through pre-existing changes in Z levels. Xbox 360 pad detected and working correctly.

All in all it's a fun game. Normally I'm not a big fan of old school arcade genre, but this is well crafted experience with someone that knows basic and good arcadedy gameplay. Complete with kill screen and full screen mode. Worth the two bucks it'll cost ya.

Probably the greatest thing from the Furry fandom since Bad Dragon. Uhh...I mean fundraisers.

 Just like those old games there is limited mechanics, you don't fight the bad guy you just keep running to avoid him while getting enough keys (in this case paper airplanes) to progress tot he next level.

Так вот в той игре нужно было управляя котом Томом собирать бумажные самолетики, отбиваясь от назойливых пчёл при помощи йо-йо. Самолетики (они же письма) падали с неба и нельзя было допускать их падения в воду. Письма вероятно принадлежали перу Джерри, причем посылал он их, по понятным причинам, уже с небес. По другой версии  письма принадлежат Чебурашке, но она не выдерживает никакой критики. Новым антогонистом Тома выступал пресловутый крокодил, олицетворающий Империю Зла, который невозбранно и очень натуралистично поедал кота при всяком удобном случае, проявляя чудеса ловкости и изобретательности на нелегком поприще котоулавливания.

The others seem too focused on delivering the aesthetic (usually with too many colors) alongside gameplay that conforms to modern videogame expectations: there has to be an overarcing story, a metagame, a save system, character growth, a difficulty curve that gently guides players to credits. Gon' E-Choo! doesn't do any of that. This game only sets out to deliver a new-one-of-those, and absolutely succeeds.

While there's no explicit campaign, the game does give you an overarcing goal: a notepad tells you the game can be broken to the point where someone can play it all day on a single quarter. But the only way to do this is the same way you'd exploit a classic arcade game: by learning the AI patterns to the point where nothing can surprise you. (There is a helpful cheat code, but even when it's used I can only make it to stage 57 or so.) I currently have a text file full of AI notes and stage strategies; it seems like I have it all worked out, I just need to get my reflexes to the point where I can do this in my sleep.

There is a motive for getting as far in as you can, from a this-is-merchandise-for-an-actual-brand standpoint: the webcomic has a cryptic side to it, related to the gator's origin. The comic teases a letter that may hold some answers, but it's only shown the first line so far. The whole thing appears to be in this game, however; it's drip-fed line-by-line with every three stages you complete. But that's only a motivator if you're interested in the lore of a silly furry webcomic (which -- and I'm going to take a wild guess, here -- [i]I bet[/i] most people aren't).

Awesome comic strip to read for lore and immersion.

The Bad:

Game tries to pass itself off as a ""Wowie, look at us! We're super famous."" in its universe when I doubt its ability to have more than a cult following at best.
Gator game too strong???
Absolutely no explanation as to why you're in what appears to be a storeroom. Are you a fan who curates Gon' E-Choo paraphernalia? Are you just some weirdo who walked in and decided it was okay to play this random arcade machine?

The Ugly:

Oh my word, the sensitivity on this is WAY TOO HIGH.  I set it to lowest in options and put my DPI on lowest it could go, and I STILL was flying about. Is this because it's a VR-focused game and head movements are supposed to be minimal?
Thankfully, you have the option to skip using the hub entirely and go straight to the game, without any ""trappings of reality"", but a lot of the magic is misssing when you do that.

The Verdict:

Come on, its got an otter protagonist. How could you NOT play this?

It's a lot like if you took a few early 1980s arcade games and mushed them together - it's mostly like Popeye - you collect falling floaty things before they get to the bottom of the screen while this big angry guy chases you, unless you get the power-up that moves about at the sides of the screen. The animations are very reminiscent of that original game, as well as the mechanics.

The animal theme and the inventiveness of the second level, with the big tree and the way you can jump and springboard from one side of the level to the other remind me of Peter Pack Rat. It is a looooong time since anything made me think of Peter Pack Rat!

And ""getting a power-up and eating the bad guy"" makes me think of Pac Man. :) 

The arcade game is, for some reason, in an arcade machine in a tiny dingy room containing spare arcade parts, flyers for the game, and a tape deck with a piece of music that's like real people recorded the game's theme. I guess it's to add ""atmosphere"" to the experience, but to me, this just felt kind of lonely and claustrophobic. So I went into the options and made it display the game only.

The graphical style, the font chosen for the text, the music with its authentic sounding bloops and bleeps, and gameplay are all the atmosphere I need. They are very faithful to arcade gaming of that era; I feel that a lot of love has gone into getting the small details right.

The one drawback is that the game has too few levels before it repeats. It's only got 3 levels. I mean, to compare, Mr Do had 8 levels before it repeated, and I think that's a fair number.

So - I would recommend this game, but really only to people who already have fond memories of early 1980s arcade gaming. I don't know if it would hold the attention of anyone else.",1453152099,1453162966,True,2,1,0.541420996189117432,0,False,False,False,False,,,

pros- 

-the style of the game is very similar to nintendo's popeye, being you have to collect paper planes to advance to the next stage, use a power up to beat out the gator who is chasing you.etc 

-the music is authentic to the arcade games it is trying to emulate, i could definitely put this in a arcade and it would fit right on in. 

-the ammount of detail in the arcade parts and how the flyers make my arcade nerd squerm with enjoyment, a really REALLY nice touch to make the game feel more authentic. 


cons

-no joystick support, yeah this has controller support but i planned to play this with a usb arcade joystick to get the full experience of playing a arcade machine, but noneless keyboard controls can do. 

-(i know a lot of pepole are gonna attack me for this) the vore, now i dont mind vore one bit, im not into it but im surely im not sexually aroused by it. i see this game as a homage to its webcomic and the arcade games of yesteryear, not ""oh god furries and kinky crap ima buy this and downvote it"" thats not the point i see here, i see someone who made a game to make a tribute to arcade games and the source its referencing...and they did a damn good job at it.

do i recommend this game?

why yes i do, if you can accept that theres anthros and eating in it then go ahead, its worth the 2 bucks and if you get it as a gift, accept it..you might just like it.

[url=http://i.imgur.com/E01TUXx.jpg]I mean look at this.[/url] What the heck am I supposed to say? I can't defend what this comic series is about. I don't know dick about it, but it kind of sickens me. However, if I astral project myself away from this and just think of the game as its own thing, well, I'll explain why I like it.

When I first started it, I was confused. ""First person perspective? Being able to move around? Why?""

Then it hit me when I was playing: The noise. The atmosphere.

The sound of the joystick, the click of the button. Playing with a 360 controller, I could swear I was playing with an arcade pad. There's no way you can replicate that in an emulated fashion unless you get yourself one, but even then. There's something about staring down into a simulated CRT monitor of an arcade machine that playing it as any other game wouldn't have given you. Arcade machines were something special - like a big bulky advertising box that wants to sell itself to you. (Or maybe a [b]pros[/b][b]titute[/b] comparison is apt here?) Arcade machines were the kind of thing you dreamed of taking home with you, as opposed to some crappy home port no doubt Acclaim had something to do with.

""Gon' E-Choo!"" (I kinda don't like that name) is as it says on the tin: A 3 stage ""platformer"" where you collect letters (The paper kind. Although for awhile I thought they were white hats for some reason) while avoiding a gator and bees. Avoiding the gator is just plain fun, like a primitive stealth game, where obfuscating simple AI patterns feels like you're tricking something - like showing a dog a mirror and it thinks its own reflection is another dog. There's not a whole lot to discuss here besides the sublime, simplistic design, which yes, does take its cues from Popeye - but you know what? I like Popeye, but the game is different enough from it that it's not an outright clone. At worst, I'd call it an extremely well done rom hack that adds new levels, as opposed to how I think of it as an homage to a classic. (It even has similar Thru signs.) 

In fact, the game feels very much like a love letter to arcades. If you look around the room you're in, you'll find fictional flyers and the guts/parts of an arcade machine you can examine. There's also a tape player you can blare over the music and sound of the game. (A nice touch is that you can turn off the arcade machines music and just leave the SFX on, which is pretty awesome. Custom music tape mod when?)

So I've gushed about it. Any problems? Well... there is kind of one, but it's not in the way you think. You see, it's the controls. They're far too precise. With a keyboard, the game works as you'd expect,  the problem is the Xbox 360 controller. It was never truly precise, it's a good controller that fits a lot of games like a glove, but for Gon E-Choo, I got myself into a few too many pickles I knew I could have prevented if I was using something better. At the same time though, I want to use a controller for this game, cause it's the right kind of game for it.

For minor problems, I guess the side panelling of the arcade machine could be more eye catching. I mean I could be wrong, but how common are arcade machines with black and white comics on the sides of it? Maybe the power up could serve more of a purpose than letting you eat the gator? Maybe a mini game like a lot of later arcade games started adding? I don't know, at this point I'm nitpicking.

I know furries are a punchline, but this more than anything proves to me that a person can have bad taste in fetishes, but they can have supremely excellent taste in video game design. I think a lot of indie devs that think they're ""totally like, making retro games, man"" could learn a lot from this title. I recommend it.

Okay, I've played a couple of games, and looked around the back room, and read through the tumblr archives of the comic to the beginning, for good measure. 

My initial opinion of the game itself is that it plays a great deal like Nintendo's ""Popeye"" from 1980. You pick up paper airplanes while running from the gator and killing flies with your yoyo, and once per life you can pick up the power-up comic book(?) and devour him instead. Picking up all the airplanes lets you advance to the next lavel.

The back room in which the game is situated is an interesting device in itself. It's a dirty back room that looks like a workshop, given the bins of parts and pile of speakers. I'm wondering if there's eventually going to be an easter egg that lets you open that door and see what's beyond. Perhaps something having to do with the letters that appear when you retrieve each airplane.

Overall, worth a look for $2, and it'll be interesting to see what'll be coming in the future.",1439996472,1439996472,True,27,3,0.740479946136474609,0,True,False,True,False,,,

As in, the mechanics are simple, you can get caught off-guard easily, there's a good bit of challenge as your pursuant gets faster and pauses for less time before grabbing for you, and if you know how the mechanics all work then you can try to pull off risky manuevers or just game the system and all that. Not to mention, besides the game, there's the whole arcade-cabinet-in-basement/garage environment where you're actually looking at the screen, hearing the music in that close environment through speakers, click of the joystick and buttons and all?

At any rate, for 2 bucks it's not bad. It's simple, the levels repeat (with growing difficulty), and the gameplay isn't hard to pick up, but grows challenging over time. I come back to it fairly often, mainly to give it another go and get farther, and also because I want to beat my friends' high scores because we're one-upping each other. So yeah, I think it's a fun little game.

By the way I should throw this disclaimer on here, I was the one who made the bleep bloop sounds and music, yeah. I didn't have anything to do with the gameplay or art or deciding mechanics or anything, though, I just supplied noises. I do legitimately think the game's decent, though, but yeah just putting that bit of transparency out there in case people think I'm reviewing my own product or something.",1439345936,1439550294,True,14,1,0.640335261821746826,1,True,False,True,False,,,

This is a fun and charming game that fans of old early-to-mid 1980s cabinet arcade games are definitely going to like. I don't remember playing a modern retro-style game that has transported me back to my quarter-crazy youth so enjoyably and thoroughly. 

You play the role of a derby-wearing pink cat who is trying to collect letters in the form of paper airplanes that soar back an forth to the bottom of the screen. While running around collecting them, there is an alligator trying to eat the cat. Also, there is a power up that allows you to turn the tables and eat the alligator. This simple premise, like a good arcade game, is addictive.  A lot of quarters would have been pumped into this back in the day.

The sound is spot on for the chips that were used at that time and the music is a happy little jingle. The characters are unique yet familiar and could have had their own Saturday morning cartoon. The CRT screen emulation, animations, and graphics are straight out of a time-warp. For me, it really captures the atmosphere of playing an old cabinet game and it offers the fun of learning to master a new machine. 

Some might not like the simplicity and repitition of a game with only three different screens (a treehouse in the woods, a backyard and a shopping mall) or appreciate the charm, but I think those people are going to be few and far between. And even at full price you can own it for less than 8 plays on a real quarter-operated game.
