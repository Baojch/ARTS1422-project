-needs trigger warnings because it handles sensitive topics & poorly at that. (to list a few kidnapping, drugging, murder, what can be explained as sexu@l harassment at best r@pe at worst)
-plot holes aplenty
-questionable MC. her motives in the beginning seem good but throughout her thoughts tend to be questionable about how relationships are handled. Often you choose a choice not quite knowing if it's what will actually happen or if it's the opposite.
-how it handles Poly relationships was simply bad. It made the poly ending a bad ending when there was so much more that could've been selected for Kotoha's bad ending, the poly one could've been its own good ending. 
-The fact Sara is cheating on her fiance.

It leaves a lot to speclate on), Mission It's complicated (superheros and silly misadventures in love both platonic an romantic), and her tears were my light (this one was 2.99 but worth it for a cute yuri love story with good pol content.

The themes themselves aren't the problem, however their execution is. It's not glorifying the bad actions, however they don't convey how bad they actually are, the[spoiler]insinuated non-consensual ""intimacy""[/spoiler]in particular. At which that route was somewhat rushed when it could have delved more into the psychological and supernatural aspect and gone more into the thriller/horror direction throughout.
On a brighter note what I did like is the music. It fits the atmosphere and overall has quite a few nice tracks.
Also the implementation of RPGs is quite a delight to me and comes across rather realistic and organically with one of the characters introducing the others to them.
Additionally I do appreciate how Kotoha’s Bad Ending reads as her Bad Ending given that[spoiler]her feelings get disregarded by herself as well and it’s easy to see how harmful that relationship will be because of this toxic mindset the characters have over it.[/spoiler]
So the overall direction wasn't bad, but there simply wasn't enough time to flesh everything out properly, so it's all rather half-baked and somewhat boring as well in parts. They could have committed to/played up the mystery aspect in the first half more to spice up the mundane daily scenes and later explored the different abilities of everyone. The prank-scene was a good idea in service of these suggestions. It introduced Kotoha’s ability organically, something Erica in particular lacked.
On account of the other negative reviews I'm giving it a recommended with an asterisk to keep the overall reception as ""Mixed"", although I’d definitely prefer a ‘meh’ option. It's not long and doesn't cost anything, so if you are curious about the concepts this story brings forth you may read it. However if you are looking for an actually good visual novel you won't find that here.
There is a full version of sorts, however while that one does add to the story the reception of it is only slightly better.",1653463033,1653463033,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The premise isn't explained at the start about why 3 women are suddenly on-board a spaceship. The main protagonist is given an opportunity to explain the premise in the plot, but chooses to brush it off and/or ignore it as unimportant. You only find out what the premise is much later in the story, but at that point, it makes literally no sense to the overall narrative of the story.

While there is technically VA, it is just a few generic phrases the characters sometimes use in between dialogue; except most of the time, it doesn't really fit into the mood and/or context of the dialogue. Music was alright, but the scenes pace too fast for the BGM to make any meaningful impact. One second it's an intense tempo and the next it plays what sounds like angels singing. Turning them off provides a less distracting experience.

The art direction is awkward too. While the characters themselves are fine, the background art is very confusing. It gives this impression that the spaceship has a very large interior space, coupled with dialogue that makes mention of several facilities for recreation, food and water production, etc. Yet you can't help but wonder why just 3 people would need a space this large and how it made sense to the premise and overall narrative of the plot.

The biggest offender is the story/plot itself. The plot and premise makes absolutely no sense and the character development compounds this further. The decisions they make are questionable at best, and invokes a sense of mental unstability, that I feel does not work well in a yuri VN. Also, the VN touches on some really strong and sensitive themes in some of the bad ends; while there is fortunately no art depicting them, it is explictly mentioned in the dialogue. While I do enjoy the occasional plot twists and/or unexpected turn of events in a VN, this one takes it too far, resulting in an unpleasant read.

If you still do want to give this VN a shot, I would recommend Kotoha's endings, especially the good end first since it's the most pleasant of the 4 endings relatively speaking. Sara's route, both good and bad ends, is a trainwreck.",1624436655,1624436655,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Blossoms Bloom Brightest isn't a long game - I'd wager you could complete all routes in just a few hours. Nor is it anything particularly special, if we're being honest; the plot isn't groundbreaking and it doesn't do anything that no other visual novel has ever done.

Having said that, a game doesn't need to be groundbreaking and original to be enjoyable. Blossoms is still a pleasing title, if you're into your romantic visual novels. This one's pretty wholesome, the characters are delightful (and by characters I really mean Kotoha, most of all) and the visuals are colourful. The soundtrack's decent, and though there isn't full voice acting, there is a little bit in terms of flavour text.

Overall, a recommendation from me.

Игра ни о чём, вот просто ни о чём! Никакой смысловой нагрузки, абсолютное отсутствие внятного сюжета!
События разворачиваются на космическом корабле Blossom, капитаном которого является Эрика Мэтьюс. Сразу же нас знакомят с ещё двумя членами экипажа, которые сами того не подозревая, оказываются на корабле, но как-то быстро и непринуждённо мирятся с этим явлением: позитивный механик Котоха и чёрствый, быдловатый доктор Сара.
Вот и всё, вот Вам и весь экипаж. Никаких уборщиков, поваров, охранников и прочих рабочих профессий, никого.
На протяжении двух недель героини болтают о всякой ерунде, подкалывают друг друга и постоянно жрут (серьёзно, кухню и бар показывали так часто, что можно сказать, это была основная локация игры!). Для чего они здесь? Почему именно они? В чём их главная цель путешествия в космосе? Куда держат путь? Ответов на эти вопросы не ждите, даже не надейтесь. Есть четыре концовки, разница лишь в том, с кем Вы лучше подружитесь. Ещё отмечу музыкальное сопровождение, оно просто отвратительное!

Pros:
- The different paths offer up different information about the characters and their situation, so it's worth doing a few playthroughs.
- The game allows you to save on the decision screen.
- The control menu allows you to modify the skip function among other things.

Cons:
- It has a rather anti-polyamorous feel to some endings, which definitely diminished my enjoyment of the game.
- The writing is understandable, but clumsy. There are quite a few spelling mistakes and misused words. Rather a lot like an average fanfiction. So if the quality of the storyline is a big deal for you, you may not like this game.
- The art is limited. The same few rooms over and over again with very little detail (however this lack of detail does suit the setting). The biggest issue I had with the character art is that it is simply flipped when a character faces the opposite direction. It's hard to ignore when someone's entire ponytail switches sides, or a person's wedding ring switches between hands based on which direction the character is facing.
- Each character only has two outfits - their day clothes, and their underwear. I would have liked to see a bit more variety, especially as their clothing isn't appropriate for any scenes in the story.",1552277986,1552277986,False,3,0,0.51024937629699707,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ścieżka Kotohy pozwala nieco lepiej poznać całe zaplecze fabularne gry i dowiedzieć się nieco więcej o postaciach, czego zabrakło w ścieżce Sary, która natomiast oferuje bardziej drastyczny podział na dobre i złe zakończenie.

เนื้อเรื่อง 

เป็นเรื่องราวเกี่ยวหญิงสาว 3 ที่เพิ่งตื่นจาก Coldsleep ในยานอวกาศที่มีชื่อว่า Blossom ที่กำลังล่องลอยออกไปกลางอวกาศอย่างไร้จุดหมาย

ถึงเนื้อเรื่องมันฟังดูแล้วเหมือนยังกับเนื้อเรื่องแนว Survivor แต่ที่จริงแล้ว มันคือ Visual novel สายยูริของแท้ที่มีแค่ตัวละคร 3 คนในเรื่องคือ 
กัปตันเอริก้า(เราจะรับบทเป็น เอริก้า) โคโตฮะ และซาร่า ในเกมจะมีแค่ 2 รูทคือ รูทโคโตฮะและรูทซาร่าและการเข้ารูทจะขึ้นอยู่กับคำตอบที่เราเลือกตอนต้น
สำหรับการดำเนินเรื่อง มันจะวนอยู่แค่ 3 ตัวละครนี้เท่านั้น และเป็นข้อเสียของเกมตรงที่ ตลอดทั้งเนื้อเรื่อง เราจะเห็นบทสนทนาในชีวิตประจำวันที่ค่อนข้างจะซ้ำซากจำเจมาก และกิจกรรมในยานส่วนใหญ่
มันจะหมดไปกับบทสนทนาที่แทบไม่มีผลต่อเนื้อเรื่องอะไรเลย  ตอนเล่นหาวไปหลายรอบนะ เพราะมันซ้ำซากจำเจมาก 
ตัวเกมจริงๆ มันแค่ 2 ชั่วโมงกว่าๆ ก็จบแล้ว แต่ด้วยความซ้ำซากของบทสนทนามันเลยมีความรู้สึกว่ามันยาวเป็นพิเศษ

Girls only, [spoiler]monogamy or polyamory[/spoiler]. Multiple important choices, most of them are pretty obvious.
[h1]Story[/h1]
The story has a decent length for a free game.
There are four endings. Two of them are (kind of) good and two are bad (warning: [spoiler]people can die[/spoiler], but there is no visible gore).
I must say I didn’t really enjoy the story. First of all, you’re alone in a spaceship with two girls… There’s no one outside of the spaceship and everything goes somewhat the same every day as if you’re stuck in a loop. Secondly, you need to choose sides all the time. I constantly felt guilty with every choice. [Spoiler] Whether it’s polyamory or not, there is always someone that doesn’t feel comfortable with your decision.[/spoiler]
[h1]Art[/h1]
The art quality is nice for both characters and backgrounds. I only had issues with the facial expression… They reused the 'special' ones a lot, but also in the wrong moments. This confused me many times because the expression didn't match the dialog.
There were no sexual scenes, only bikini’s. :b
[h1]Extra[/h1]
It’s hard to call it voice acting since it was incomplete. Most sentences aren’t and even if they are, only a few words or it doesn’t match with the text at all.
The background music with the voices was a little too noisy for me. It didn’t have a relaxing effect on me. (which I guess it should have had?)",1541791534,1541791602,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I believe the dialouge is the same between both games. 

The art, bg, and music are different than Galaxy Angel's. But betweem both versions I likle them both. If anything the biggest huge difference is there is anitjer character in Galaxy Angel's who is Emilia. There is also some voice acting here that wasn't present in Galaxy Angel's. Wish Galaxy Angel's kept some va too.

All in all just like Galaxy Angel I love this version too. Also as before I don't vare about Sara at all. Kotoha is still best girl:) Plus since this is a free to play makes it even better:)

Also the picture with ""that"" ending in Sara is just freaking creepy........",1539176484,1539176545,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]Pros[/b=]
[list]
[*]YURI
[*]2 love interests (although Kotoha is best girl - [spoiler]and given even her bad ending is only bittersweat, and she has no breakup/death endings in GG, I think she's the closest to a cannon love interest)
[*]Nice character art - I actually preferred this art to GG, I liked the style more and thought the sprites differentiate the characters better e.g Kotoha is actually shorter in this, and Sara is tall and lanky, while in GG all sprites are the same height and their differing body shapes is more focused on bust size.  GG does however give more dynamic elements, such as blinking during cg scenes, and changing clothes during scenes.
[*]4 endings (2 good, 1 ok, 1 BAD - really really, do not play for anything but the achievement BAD!).  GG has about 11 endings.
[*]Free
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The story that got the 3 girls onto the space ship is 70s B-movie level silly, but we're not really playing it for the story, we are playing it for the cute girls and Kotoha makes up for it.  GG sadly doesn't improve on the story, but its a longer game so gives us more character development once we're past the cheesy reason they 3 strangers are on a spaceship together.
[*]Of the 2 love interests Sara is pretty forgettable and has none of Kotoha's charm. [spoiler]In the BAD ending she develops a character, sadlly it involves her going insane and killing Kotaha, so do yourself a favour and date Kotoha and forget Sara exists - I am so glad that in both my Blossoms and GG playthroughs I cared so little for Sara she was left to last, if I'd gotten her bad endings in my first playthough of either I may have rage quit the series.  Kotoha's bad ending by contrast is you (Erika) just breaking her heart by being non-committal[/spoiler]. Again, the full game Galaxy Girls gives all the characters more time to develop and adds a 3rd love interest, Emilia, and a good harem ending option.
[*]Limited cg, but again its free - GG provides a bucket load",1537222661,1537262700,True,2,0,0.530516445636749268,0,False,False,False,False,,,

""There’s a lot of mixed feeling going through my head as I write this review. Blossoms Bloom Brightest isn’t really a good visual novel, but it’s not a bad one either. It could have been a better visual novel, but not without major changes to the story and characters. It just doesn’t leave you with any satisfaction no matter which route you choose and that’s just a shame.""

Still, I think it has many, many problems and it's easy to see this was both a game jam entry and the first project by a small, inexperienced studio. To be more specific:

- The main intrigue is explained very briefly and goes nowhere. Halfway through the game, we learn the meaning behind the heroine's kidnapping and the mission of the ship, but nothing interesting happens after that.
- All the characters lack common sense and while the story gives some ""reasons"" behind their attitudes, especially at the beginning of the game, they just don't act like human beings.
- Everything happens too fast, especially in Sara's route. In two weeks (both scenarios end at day 14 after the characters are woken up from stasis), she goes from being devastated by the kidnapping and the fact she was taken from her fiancee literally days before their wedding, to falling in love with the protagonist - it doesn't even feel right.
- There's little variety in expressions and voice cues (that's all that the ""partial voice acting"" amounts too), meaning they don't always fit the dialogue and situations you read.

What's good then? Well, there are definitely some cute interactions, especially when Kotoha is involved and she also isn't a bad character, even though her initial characterisation is quite over-the-top. The general quality of writing is also not-awful, even considering the serious gripes I've listed above. I would most likely list this game as ""neutral"" if I could, but as it's not available, I didn't have such a bad time reading it to tell people to stay away from it at all cost. If you like yuri and don't have anything more interesting to read - give it a try.

I have a lot of petty criticisms about this game. The painful, ear-ringing background music. The way it constantly pushes DLC. The fact that it's basically been abandoned for the not-free remake with even more DLC. The way the sprites are mirrored, so that the character with an asymmetrical hairstyle constantly mirrors it like this is an 8-bit pixel game. The way the protagonist sometimes [spoiler]does the opposite of the choice the player selected, because she doesn't have the required amount of relationship triggers collected for a particular ending.[/spoiler] But really, there's such a deep, fundamental problem with this game that those issues are kind of irrelevant overall.

Even after the first ending, I was feeling uneasy.
After the second, I was cringing.
After the third, I was upset.
And then the fourth ending occurred.

This game is not about romance. It is a collection of vignettes about traumatized, trapped women, exposed to constant mental stress, until at least one of them inevitably breaks under the pressure.
The writing was unnerving even on the less disturbing paths (Kotoha), with the entire concept of having three girls [spoiler]trapped for the rest of their lives on a tiny spaceship together against their will[/spoiler]. But the organization behind this [spoiler]tore an unstable woman with the power to spread her emotional state to others away from her life as part of some perverse experiment, under threat of death.[/spoiler] Great start to a ""romance"" novel.
While a poly relationship isn't a bad thing at all, the writers clearly have some strange ideas about what such a relationship would entail and the consent that would actually need to go into that kind of thing. Let's be clear. [spoiler]What Erica wants is a harem, not a polycule. Kotoha and Sara hate each other and Erica is splitting her time between the two of them, even though that's clearly not okay with Kotoha.[/spoiler] And it's obvious that, if you [i]don't[/i] go for that ending, [spoiler]either Sara or Kotoha, depending on whom you are pursuing romantically, is very much not okay with the result.[/spoiler]. Every scene, I found myself thinking ""This is not okay. This is not okay. Why does she think this is okay?""

And then [spoiler]Sara's bad ending happened, in which she murders Kotoha, and then drugs, paralyzes, and repeatedly r a p e s  Erica.[/spoiler] And I should have been surprised, but honestly this just seems like the same thing that would have eventually happened on every other route. These people are not stable. They are not safe to be together. And they are [spoiler]equipped with mind-control powers, the ethics of which the game barely touches upon, that Erica even says will lead to a catastrophe when used by someone as traumatized and mentally hurt as Sara.[/spoiler]

This game needs a CW at the start. It's far too easy to accidentally come across disturbing content, and the way this game handles sensitive issues is disturbing on multiple levels. If you can handle disturbing content and don't mind the author's offensive views of poly relationships and mental trauma, the sprite quality and variety is good, the voice acting is decent, and the setting is kinda interesting on a surface level.

Да, нарисовано неплохо, однако на этом достоинства заканчиваются. 
С самого начала нам представляют трёх персонажей, два из которых оказались на корабле против своей воли(!). Ожидаешь, что сюжет будет вертеться вокруг этого: какая миссия у команды? Почему весь экипаж - трое девушек? Почему нельзя было набрать добровольцев и т.д. Но вместо этого персонажи болтают ни о чём, смотрят аниме, едят.. Вопрос - зачем тогда нужен космический антураж? Весь сюжет прекрасно бы смотрелся в slice of life, а так ждёшь чего-то большего.
Впрочем, нет его толком, сюжета. Одна болтовня без событий. Даже CG почти нет для услаждения взора.
Можно возразить, мол, чего ты ждёшь от бесплатной новеллы, но среди бесплатных попадаются такие, что и коммерческие за пояс заткнут. А тут... в лучшем случае демка, да и то неинтересная.

There is literally no transition between events and makes you feel like you're""time jumping"" from one event to the other.

This game barely has any choices, the writing is awful, and there are confusing spelling errors.  It is very strange to play a VN written in the third person.  The decision to distance the player from their character didn't make sense until the copious underwear scenes, in game watching of ecchi, and unnecessary blushing at everything.  This game was obviously made for straight men to get off to.  

There are only two NPCs.  In Sara's route the MC is drugged even on the good ending.  In the bad ending Sara murders the other NPC, permanently paralyzes the MC to the point where they can't even speak, ties them up and talks about how excited she is to start experimenting sexually with the MC.

And yeah, achievements are only four and you can obtain them within 5 or 6 playthroughs, if you skip everything it takes literally nothing but let's go on.. there are guides for this :P
This visual novel, as I said, is free to play and has got a particular art style and graphics in general, I liked them a lot.. they're not the stereotypical Japanese girls you'll find in many visual novels (I love them too of course), they're a bit more personal - and I see that this developer has only this game on Steam, don't know anything else though.
I saw many negative reviews that, for me, this visual novel really does not deserve.
Yeah, it's short, but it's well designed and written and it's also free.
Plus, apart from the artworks the whole game takes place in a sci-fi environment (Blossom is the spaceship in case you're wondering xD); three girls are the protagonists (you're Erica, the captain) and you have to work together getting different endings for one girl or the other one.
The mechanisms are the same as the usual visual novels, some endings, many choices, well-written text and so on so, nothing new (apart from the fact that it isn't love-centered and there are only girls xD).
The game will take two or three hours if you read almost everything, and it's not wasted time. I really enjoyed it and I'm replaying it now after some months :)
Idk, I'm happy to make a positive review for this game that really to me deserves it if you like visual novels in general!

Released on the 28th of April, 2017, this is a science fiction, yuri (lesbian), visual novel that has an aspect of mystery to it.

Trigger warnings for this game: suicide (following one of the endings)

In this game, you follow the story of three women that awaken to find themselves on a spaceship named The Blossom. Stuck together for two weeks, what adventures will they get on together, and what will become of them all?

I started this game not expecting too much. This is a yuri visual novel, and yuri is usually marketed to men with very oversexualised women. When this did occur, I wasn’t too shocked, but disappointed. There is a lot that happens on the form of sexualisation, with women just standing around in their underwear, some revealing costumes, and characters with large breasts that really wasn’t needed in this visual novel. It was rather annoying for me to come across in this, but as I said before, I was expecting it, so it didn’t ruin anything for me.

Going through the choices we had, I found I had quite a bit of fun. I liked the characters, I could relate to them on a small level, and I found that the story actually kept me pretty hooked. It was enjoyable.

One thing I didn’t like was the suicide out of nowhere when following one of the story lines, which was really a shock to me. Warnings really need to be included as it made me quite shaky and I wasn’t expecting it. 

Other than this, this was really enjoyable. It was rather basic, and it was definitely marketed to men via sexualisation, so it lost quite a bit of charm. However, I did enjoy it, and if you like visual novels, I’d definitely recommend giving this one a try. I enjoyed it and it took me less than an hour to complete the game. Definitely a bit of fun, and a lovely story line to follow.

This game is a sideways thumb from me, and I wish we had that feature on here. Giving this a negative recommendation, purely because I only gave it two out of five on another site, rather than a higher rating.",1503509914,1503509914,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This visual novel is centered around Erica Matthews - the captain of the ship in which the story takes place - and the two women she's tasked to look after for an important mission, Kotoha Ichinose and Sara Evans. I would start with Erica herself, but you know virtually nothing about her, which makes her very hard to sympathize with or root for. Her personality is pretty bland but that's par for the course with love sim leads, so we'll move on to Kotoha.

My immediate problem with Kotoha is that she doesn't ""feel"" human. She's excessively upbeat to the point where she doesn't react like a normal person would in the situations she's thrown into, such as playing pranks on the other two girls and inviting Erica to play video games with her on the very same day that she wakes up on a mysterious ship and learns that she won't ever be going home again. And as if she weren't annoying enough, if you pursue Sara or give her any attention at all, Kotoha turns into a massive insufferable brat, as she apparently fell in love with you the moment she saw you and thus feels entitled to your time. She's very juvenile in her appearance and personality, and that's just not a quality I find appealing in my yuri.

Now, onto Sara. Sara is...incredibly unlikable. She's understandably hostile given that she apparently has a fiance whom she'll never be seeing again, but the creators of this VN seem to think that a woman who spends 80% of the game crying about her fiance and lashing out at you makes for good relationship fodder, so later she inexplicably falls in love with you? She basically asks you to [spoiler]replace her fiance,[/spoiler] which is a very sad and disturbing request that made me want to exit the game and go play something where my sapphics are happy and healthy. Last straw was when she [spoiler]DRUGS YOUR FOOD AND BEGINS TO DISSOCIATE THAT YOU'RE HER FIANCE? AND THAT ISN'T EVEN THE BAD END.[/spoiler]

Putting aside the characters for a moment, the story's setting doesn't exactly make sense either. The three are on a MASSIVE, self-sustaining ship that's being closely monitored, and they're the only ones on it. Why? And even more baffling, they apparently have all the time in the world to spend every chapter playing video games, eating, and going on dates. What of the vital mission that the three are even on this ship for? Not that vital it seems, as you don't hear about it again for the rest of the story.

The cherry to top this crap sundae is that you're only given the illusion of choice in Blossoms Bloom Brightest. I was impressed by some of the darker dialogue options presented to you and the shocked reactions that they garnered from the other girls, but my hopes that there might be a single redeeming quality in this VN were flushed down the toilet when your character essentially says, ""Haha I was kidding!"" afterwards every single time without fail, and everyone laughs it off. Why? It's such a cop-out to present you with an actually interesting idea or response, then hide it behind the guise of a joke so that the writers don't have to think up the consequences that would follow such spicy dialogue. In fact, the writing in general is pretty poor, since even though you're playing from Erica's point of view, you never really get a glimpse into her character enough to understand why she's attracted to either of the girls. She's a classic example of loving someone because they love you, even though fleshing out a romantic relationship and each character's feelings is kind of the point of a romantic visual novel. But alas...

Not everything's bad, hard as I am on this game. I like the art and the character designs, I think the voice actresses sounded nice, and I'm always up for sci-fi theme (especially when lesbians are involved). Hell, I might even try Galaxy Girls when it's released, which is advertised as a more substantial sequel to Blossoms Bloom Brightest, and from what I've seen looks promising. Unfortunately though, you're better off waiting for that, as this will ultimately feel like a massive waste of two hours of your time.

sara's plotline is weird as hell. she seems like  a better choice since she's more age-appropriate and less codependent, but she drugs you and almost assaults you, and your character totally just... brushes it off. it's kinda messed up. it's pretty weird and i feel like they definitely could've written a better romance for both of the charcters involved without mentioning assault or non/con so much.

the second girl (i literally forget her name and i played it twice) is kind of juvenile and childish, she isn't given much depth honestly. (it's free though so.) it just feels weird to romance her. we aren't given erica's exact age but it's a noticeable difference in demeanor and physicality, so i'm guessing late twenties-early thirties, which is quite the difference when you take into account she's also the captain, which creates a pretty big power dynamic.

but like, again. it's free. it's low calorie. it'll pass the time. also, it's gay, wich if you're lgbt+ like i am is a huge plus because there just aren't that many games with romance AND queer characters. play at your own risk though.",1500499953,1500500437,True,2,1,0.525547444820404053,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]The good route[/h1]
Well the redeeming factor of this game is the route with the gamer girl, where the backstory is explained for starters but that is not all, the relationship with her is well structure, the events make sense and overall it is kinda of an enjoyable experience on my opinion however you kinda have to play the awfull starting sequence that has such a weird voice over and the lines arent exatly great either but if you can overcome that bit you are fine.

[h1]The bad route[/h1]
And here it goes the route with the older girl that got kidnaped and put on the ship with you leaving her fiancée behind. The problem I have with this route is that the creators wanted to make story involving a romantic relationship with this character kinda has episodes of madness because of losing her loved one however they failed in if they wanted the main character to fell in love with her since going from full on madness and hatred to I love you is a bit extreme in the small amount of time that happens if you consider the good ending, however if the bad ending is the true one for this route then the fix to that would be simply to eliminate all the parts where main character suposedly has feelings for her which simply dont make sense.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This game game is way too ambitious for what it wanted to make at least on the bad route and the intro sequence with that awfull voice acting and the bits of voice acting here and there dont really do the game any favours. However it has a good route that is relatively enjoyable and both endings of that route have an interesting conundrum after you see both of them.",1500228287,1500228345,False,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Don't waste your time with Blossoms.

The music is forgettable, the art is inconsistent, the voice acting is annoying and actively hinders comprehension in some places. There are 5-6 generic voice lines for each character and many of them are used over the top of text that isn't even close in meaning to the voice line.

Kotoha's Route is ok. If you feel the need to play this game then do her route and aim for the good ending. Her character and story are decently written and generally makes sense.

Everything to do with Sara is nonsense. She absolutely hates you (which makes sense... she thinks you kidnapped her) until she inexplicably falls in love with you. No, seriously, there's almost no interaction with her that could be considered bonding or romantic in any way [spoiler]and she even drugs and almost molests you at one point,[/spoiler] but suddenly you're on a date swooning for her.

The main plot is no better. The whole concept [spoiler]sending three mutant women into space as ""Humanity's last hope""[/spoiler] makes no sense at all, and there's no effort spent in the writing to explain why. There's mystery for the sake of mystery that literally resolves itself halfway through the story, then the rest of the story focuses on these horribly flimsy romantic relationships. Also, the whole game takes place in the span of 14 days. It's not nearly enough time for the characters to progress through the arcs that they do.

The plot is a mystery for most of the game, and then is revealed near the end - unfortunately the reveal only shows that the plot makes no sense. The cast does its best to hold up the stilted lines being delivered with some okay voice acting, but the characters they are playing (otaku girl, jerk evening gown woman, and captain moron) don't hold up. Why would you have three people piloting a large spaceship? Why would you pour flour into the central air unit while you are in space?

There's three people alone on a huge spaceship that's not only large enough to house hundreds (based on the size of the dining hall, represented by what seems to be a generic school cafeteria background), but full of inefficient open spaces. Apparently the ship can fly and maintain itself, since the crew has nothing to do but eat, sleep, and play video games. And they don't have to ration food or water, since the ship can also grow meat and vegetables without human oversight. So humans have such great advances in efficient energy sources (since the ship apparently has so much to waste), automated computer systems, and food production, and [spoiler]no one thinks to use them to solve Earth's resource problems?[/spoiler]

I could maybe look past this if the premise was actually used for something interesting, but it's just an excuse to get the characters under the same roof. The story ends abruptly as soon as the romances are resolved, completely abandoning the sci-fi plot threads.

My only criticism is with the sound. The music does get a bit repetitive, and there isn't much variety in tracks. I feel that the partial voice-acting did not add much to the game, and actually detracted from it because I just found it odd. The dozen or so voice clips that ranged from one to a few words were reused multiple times even if it didn't match the line, and some of them were so oddly placed for the situation that I giggled a little at how out of place it was. It does have its charm though, I'll give it that.

Another minor gripe is that I wish there was more, haha. I don't know how to say this, but after I finished the endings, I felt like it was only the beginning, you know?

as for the voice acting i think it would of been better if it was actually working with what you read instead of just randomly added. so my concern is valid since galaxy angels is something you will need to buy and will be longer. if they were to repeat the same thing i can already see people being upset with it. so again the artwork and story was fine. it was just the music and random voices that turned me off.",1493864928,1493864928,False,3,0,0.439832061529159546,3,False,False,False,False,,,

-Good, quick fix for when you need some cute purity action
-Yuri is good for your kokoro
-possible JoJo reference spotted

You play as Erica, and you have two romance options and they lead to a good or a bad ending. [spoiler]Sara’s bad ending tho. Thanks for the nightmare fuel![/spoiler] 

This VN is quite good, and it surprises me that it’s free. The art style is cute, BGM gets a bit repetitive after a while but nothing that bothered me that much, and the partial VA is okay. The characters say a few random words, and even if they’re not speaking the exact lines that we’re reading, it still gives the game a certain charm.

8/10. I hope that the remake (Galaxy Angels) will be good as well! Also, Kotoha is the best girl. <3",1493401423,1493401423,True,48,0,0.825342059135437012,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Each route will take approximately 30-60 minutes. Soundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are good after factoring in appropriate background music for the futuristic space and romance themes in the story and animated sprites for each of the main characters. It would be nice to have an extras section featuring CGs and music gallery in the game.
