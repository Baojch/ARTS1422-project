赛车有温度和能量的设定，不同的操作包括使用道具都会增加温度或消耗能量，如果引擎过热则必须等到完全冷却后才能进行会增加引擎温度的操作。IES的赛车拥有最多的能量，并且可以产生电磁脉冲攻击敌人；Nitroid的赛车拥有最强的动力，并且可以在引擎过热状态下仍然进行攻击和booster，不过再超过一定程度则会自爆；Nanofabric的赛车总体比较均衡，并且不容易被道具命中。

赛车部件有六种：
Weapon：主武器，攻击时会增加引擎温度，三种类型的武器总体区别不大。
Armour：归0后就自爆了，同时决定赛道上的某些物理表现。
Booster：使用需消耗能量，同时增加引擎温度，可以一定程度突破最大速度。
Cooler：决定引擎的最高温度和冷却效率。
Engine：决定速度和加速度。
Shield：消耗能量形成的护盾，能量耗尽后才会伤害到Armour。

比赛形式主要有八种（另外还有各种不同规则的boss战）：
Against the clock：每隔一段时间淘汰最后一名，对于非Nitroid赛车有一定压力，容易开局就变最后一名。
Courier：捡拾赛道上的包裹，最多可以携带三个，每次路过起点可以交付身上的所有包裹。
Damage control：每隔一段时间并且速度在一定百分比上可以获得一级速度标记物的提升（增加最大速度），不过一旦受到伤害则标记物清零。
Death match：比较人头的比赛，伤害系数会增加，比较看脸。
Defeat the enemy：消灭指定敌人的比赛，由于同时有AI赛车会一起攻击，不算太难。
Hit the target：通过赛道上的多个标志物，否则会有罚时。
Single race：普通的和AI一起的比赛。
Time trial：没有AI的纯计时赛。

每条赛道都算各有特色，赛道上也会有些会产生互动的物体（比如热气会增加引擎温度，有些物体会和赛车相撞），而且每条赛道都可以双向，反过来会有不一样的体验。不过高级档赛车速度太快，在某些赛道上会出现飞出赛道的bug……",1532868597,1532868597,True,5,1,0.579223334789276123,2,True,False,False,False,,,

- steep learning curve, neither easy nor fun to start
- no tutorial
- complicated menu navigation
- complicated hud. Hard to read health/shield state.
- awful damage registration (when you didn't hit a wall visibly, but damage is registered)
- crude effects and camera work, feels unfinished
- gamepad issues (analog controls are hopeless without BigPicture tweaking, menu navigation is difficult)
- way too much things to keep track of, with useless gun and heat level, energy level, multiple pickups - lack of focus
- if I need unlockables to play more effectively then it causes ""chicken and egg"" issue - the game is harder to new players when it would be better to help them.

Pros:

- price compared to other AG racing games in Steam. Still not much fun for the price.

Meh:

- music. Mostly forgettable, sometimes annoying. I hate ""Almighty"" track for example, and it seems tracks are attached to maps, so no way to disable certain tracks. It also gets repetitive quickly when you trying to beat a map over and over again.

For an AG racing game, it feels unfinished and leaves a lot to be desired.
Pretty picture in trailers (more or less) but not so fun gameplay.

TLDR: Works alright but A.I. is tricky to keep with, controls are unconventional on the Xbox remote and the powerups are a tad boring and poorly executed. No splitscreen and Redout is more audiovisually impressive in a similar genre. Otherwise it is a decent single player pod racer type game with a sci fi fighter as your vehicle. However I am not a huge fan of that genre and would rather play the best on the rare occasions I do fire one of these game so I am removing for declutter.

Game has a variety of simple modes, from racing, to collecting coins, sudden death or bounty hunter. They all feel rather samey but it is nice to have the diversity. The tracks and environments are decent, the speed feels good, and the tracks do not have too many crazy turns to handle or obstacles, offering to reward players who do well with powerups rather than stall those who do poorly. The AI is hard to keep up with, the odd control scheme makes it tricky to nitro, throttle, aim the ship and combat all at once which it really should not struggle with if it used sticks correctly. This has no splitscreen features, and in my experience the powerups are rather boring, as they are just light particle effects that act as protective auras or small energy attacks. I end up prefering to rely on the blaster fire which at leasts as some authentic sci fi feel to it. However, it is single bolt, and rate of fire remains low, in a high speed situation that is not terribly helpful. There are no splitscreen so play with A.I. will be your only option.",1510411804,1510624931,False,0,0,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You're in a RACING game. But you're also in a deathmatch mode. If you go well ahead of the pack, it would result in you not seeing anyone else; nothing to shoot at. So you've to slow down just so you can achieve the mode's objectives of shooting down X number of competitors. 

Slowing down in a racing game. Let that sink in.

Not worth it even if F2P. 0/10.

I tried this game again after an extended absence. I do this thing where I stop playing a bad game in hopes that it will get improved by the devs and/or that my opinion (if it's holding me back) will change. On this latest playthrough, neither of those have changed.

Relevant to my gameplay: I used the 360 controller only (didn't attempt keyboard, don't think it would be any better).

Ultimately I can't write a full review on this because I can't get past the first race. And it's not a problem of skill, though I am not very good at this game. The problem lies with the laggy controls, confusing powerups that do almost nothing, the extreme slowdown when hitting obstacles (or being completely stopped), and the AI players that never hit a side wall or get shot by you (unless you are extrememly lucky). 

So this current playthrough, I attempted the same 1st race 7 times and my best place was 8th. It falls back on the flawless AI and the maps which aren't designed for travel, they're designed to slow you down and stop you. That's not racing. In fact that's not even gameplay, Especially when you add in that the controls almost always over compensate and only do so after a lag on the input so you don't turn at all when you hit the turn, then you hit the wall, then the overcompensation comes in and you hit the other wall immediately after. So in order to turn, you have to try to turn well before you even get to the turn, then magically stop turning and use the bank breaks to slow yourself down from hitting the inside wall. What? 

Anyways, this game is going in my crap section since it is virtually unplayable and nothing else about the game has any appeal. It comes down to: 
*so-so graphics and music
*bad racetrack design
*flawless AI
*unforgiving obstacles
*and terrible controls. 

I admit, I am not good at this game. But from a basic game creation standpoint, the first map should be relatively simple and a tutorial to ease people into the gameplay and controls. This game literally fails at the onset. In fact, even the menu screen is a fail because it's unintuative (other then pressing A or B a bunch of times) and the devs didn't even bother to map the D-pad to navigate the menus.

[h1]Portable Description[/h1]
Quantum Rush Champions is an anti-gravity single-player racing game. Boasting a Career Mode with 9 different challenge (race mode) types, 21 Bosses and 14 racing tracks, a considerable amount of time will be required to see everything this game has to offer. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[u][b]Career Mode[/b][/u]
Career mode starts with choosing one of three racer Manufacturers. Ion Energy Systems specializes in racers with extraordinary shields. Nitroid Racing focuses on improving their racers' boosters while Nanofabric Motorworks aims to produce the most balanced and steady racers. After choosing a Tier (racer), 6+ different Challenge types must be completed in order to progress. Each subsequent Tier (7 Tiers for each manufacturer) is unlocked by achieving a required number of medals and defeating the Tier's Boss. These medals are received upon fulfilling certain challenge requirements. The following 9 challenge types are listed below. 

[b]Challenge Types[/b]:
[list]
[*]Against the Clock: Every few seconds, the last-placed player will be eliminated
[*]Courier: Collect as many packages as possible
[*]Damage Control: Don't take any damage in order to increase top speed
[*]Deathmatch: Eliminate as many enemies as possible
[*]Defeat the Enemy: Destroy target enemy as fast as possible
[*]Hit the Target: Pass through rings and finish as fast as possible
[*]Single Race: Fight for the best placement
[*]Time Trial: Beat the best time
[*]Boss Race (Career Mode only)
[/list]

Throughout the race, an on-board weapon can be used to shoot enemies down. These weapons are part of random awards received at the end of each successful challenge. Some of the weapons include pulse-fire shooters or lasers. Due to the curvature of the track and the weapons' inability to lock-on, it can be very difficult to effectively utilize them. To supplement this, pickup items at designated locations are also provided for support. Three items can be carried at once and toggled for situational use. Unfortunately, these items can not be fired backwards (excluding mines). Some of the items include: armor, shields, lock-on rockets, AOE fire and straight-fire rockets. Although using these items are crucial to success, the hitbox for the pickup items are rather small. Even though they are presented as holographic squares that are the size of an average racer, a direct collision through the center of the item is required for it to register as received.

[u][b]Arcade Mode[/b][/u]
Arcade mode provides freely configurable challenges to allow customized races. Every challenge type is available for modification with the exception of boss races. The race parameters that can be altered are listed below.

[b]Arcade Settings[/b]:
[list]
[*]Race Track
[*]Direction: Forwards or Backwards
[*]Number of AI Opponents
[*]AI Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, Nightmare
[*]Number of User Respawns
[*]Number of AI Respawns
[*]Challenge Specific Settings: Boost Time, Elimination Time, Packages etc.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u]
The graphics and aesthetics for QRC is very similar to other high octane/anti-gravity racers. A futuristic feel is generated with the use of the darker spectrum of the color palette and many vertical lines, imitating a sense of traveling through tubes, tunnels or wires. The tight level design helps create a sense of speed. QRC is a far cry from the common indie graphics seen in many shovelware that utilize the most basic native engine assets. 

[u][b]HUD[/b][/u]
The HUD presents three different meters located at each corner of the screen (Energy, Speed, Heat) and an armor meter with 3 item pickup icons located at the top. Due to the nature of the high speed racing and intense action, it can be very difficult to look away from the center of the screen to observe the various meters. A more centralized location with the 3 meters in a condensed form would allow for more effictive utilization.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
[u][b]Controller Support[/b][/u]
Although QRC has full controller support, this game should have went through more QA testing to fix all of the minor grievances observed while playing with a controller. One such grievance is the fact that the controller does not work on the title menu. Continuing with the troubles, the item toggle button is mapped to a very difficult to reach location and re-mapping it causes the ""Summary/Detail/Custom"" options to be unusable with any other mapped button. Also, the Alt-Tab feature has caused the game to freeze multiple times.

[u][b]Racer Handling[/b][/u]
Even with these minor annoyances, the handling of the racers during gameplay is fairly fluid. The racer is responsive enough to the analog control and the two airbrakes sufficiently allow for fine turning around sharp corners.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[u][b]Current State of the Game[/b][/u]
The current state of the game may be a bit troubling to some players. The developers seemed to have moved on from this game to their other IPs. It's been exactly one year from this review's posting since an official update was published; Steam News announcements involve GameArt's newer titles. A quick look through the Steam Discussions will reveal a lack of developer-authored posts. What the game has to offer in this state is essentially its ""complete"" form. 

[u][b]Verdict[/b][/u]
With everything taken into consideration, Quantum Rush Champions is only recommended to those that are fans of anti-gravity single-player racers. The minor bugs and problematic UI navigation can be forgiven, but the lack of online multiplayer/local coop and continued updates will be difficult for many veteran gamers to accept.

A cool Anti-Gravity indie racergame stated in the future, Quantum Rush is an nice way to spend some time gaming! 
The game has different entertaining game modes like ""deathmatch"" and ""race against the clock"". In some of the game modes there are power-ups you can use to win the race. 
A few of the power-ups are: [list] 
[*] Rockets.
[*] Bullets that deal more damage.
[*] Boost. [/list]
Quantum Rush Champions reminded me a lot of the Star Wars podrace series, which is a good thing in my opinion.
It gave me a special mindset which encouraged me to play even more of the game!

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b][list]
[*] Apart from a few fps drops the game is not hard to run and you will be able to run it with almost any kind of device.
[*] Nice music which fits the game.
[*] Beautiful user interface, good looking buttons, fonts, loading animation and dialog boxes.
[*] Easy controls and a low skillcap so it is not hard to learn how to play the game.
[*] Short races, a race takes 2-5 minutes total.
[*] Racing and fighting game in one!
[*] Really good diversity in circuits, vehicles and modules.
[*] The game has a lot of action because of the different types of power-ups and bot difficulties.
[*] 3 independent campaings with various challenges.
[/list]
[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b][list]
[*] In a race you might experience a few small fps drops.
[*] There is no training mode to learn the controls, luckily the controls are not that hard and you can easily find them through the options menu.
[*] Free to play mode is a little too 
[*] The game is a little unbalanced when you play on the top tier, the bots are hard to beat. 
[*] A lack of depth, after 1 hour of continues racing, the game will get boring for some people.
[*] The price may be a little off, in a bundle it might be worth checking out.
[/list]

[b]Overall experience:[/b]

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic Anti-Gravity racers, the game is however overpriced in my opinion.
Despite a few fps drops the game is stable enough for almost any system.


[b]Rating: [/b]

I would rate ""Quantum Rush Champions"" a descent 7.5/10.

The idea and the theme is great. But execution (like always) is where is really resides. I mean I could love a shitty graphics game with awesome execution much more than a poorly executed fancy graphics game (which is this).

It's a futuristic racer/shooter. Kind of like Crash Team Racing or Mario Kart. Here's the pros & cons:

+ Nicely designed futuristic setting on levels (seriously)
+ Nicely and DEEPLY designed vehicle customization that is consistent with the futuristic theme. What I mean is, your vehicle has multiple parts that affect your racing;

1) Engine: How fast you will go
2) Booster: How good is your situational turbo (press for extra speed)
3) Weapons: How much damage do they inflict
4) Cooler: All of that shit above creates heat. Gotta cool it all down.
5) Energy: All of that shit above consume energy. Your energy depot size
6) Armor: How many hits you will take before you explode
7) There is more that I can't remember right now.

^ See all of that, you don't see in every race game. Nice execution there.

+ Diverse weapons types: They are fun to use, I'll give em that.
+ Diverse vehicle types AND the vehicle manufacturers. I mean they might have just created 3 vehicles and released the damn game. No, there is like 15 vehicles.
+ Sound effects and menu music is nice. Didn't like the race music.
+ Diverse race types (elimination, destroy target, destroy all, race, timed, head2head, etc.)

OK... cons:

- THERE IS NO TUTORIAL. Come on. Do I really need to check the damn options screen? The very first time I load the game? Really? To see what button does what in the game? Seriously who does that? I'll tell you who. ME (because I'm a perfectionist maniac) BUT HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO USE THOSE BUTTONS? I may know what the shooting button is. But wtf am I shooting at? What weapon does what? WTF is a booster? When and how am I gonna utilize it for best performance? WTF is going on in general? Serious flaw, no tutorial.

- Uh, opponents are really fast? I mean, maybe I'm doing it wrong (cos I'm still at the exploration phase) but as soon as the race starts, everyone except me, just bolts into the horizon with incredible speed. And I'm left behind, holding my dick in my hand and pushing the accelerator and the booster and hoping that I'll catch up with them some day before the race ends. Seriously I haven't been able to win a single race since I started playing. Maybe I'm not skilled enough. My best position was 3rd, and I was pushing it, AND I was extremely lucky too.

- Bad music. The race music I mean. The menu tracks were nice but the race music is really bad.

I am going to be able to give this game a sad 5/10. Could have been executed much much better, because the idea and the theme is great. I love racer/shooters, there aren't many good ones around (at the time of writing this anyway). Well I think you might be better off downloading Crash Team Racing from a PSX iso site, and playing it in an emulator with your controller.

Плюсы:
- Есть ощущение скорости и крутые виражи. Иногда.
- Довольно приятная графика.
- Хорошая физика. Можно классно подлететь не вписавшись в дорогу во время заноса и всё равно интуитивно ощущать вес и скорость трансорта в почти свободном полёте.

Минусы:
- Плохая оптимизация. ФПС постоянно скачет, вот идеально ровная анимация, вот слайдшоу, вот среднее качество, вот опять ФПС высокий, а вот он упал. И всё в течении одного круга. Видно, что старались, но не осилили.
- Низкобюджетные звуки и такая же музыка.
- Плохое управление даже на геймпаде.
- Меню запутано и так же не удобно возиться в нём с помощью геймпада.
- ИИ вынесет вас из всех орудий от лица всех гонщиков ещё на старте.
- Постоянные взрывы от столкновений. Иногда даже не понятно во что ты мог врезаться в центре дороги, а иногда столкновение происходит едва заметно.
- Оружие бесполезно, так как на подъёмах выстрел попадёт в дорогу прямо перед игроком, на спусках он улетит выше дороги, на поворотах точно не получится подбить врага несколькими точными попаданиями, а прямых участков почти нет. Но для ИИ это не проблема.
- Геймплей безнадёжно испорчен перегревами двигателя, опустошением батарей, глупым оружием, плохим управлением, ненужными параметрами.

A heavy chicane series in the third track. Until engines and boosters are upgraded, races are a tedious slog to, at best, a silver. Weapon pickups have a hitbox a third the size of the boost pads, and the same goes for the packages of Courier mode. Weapons, for the most part, rely on either perfect straights, or getting close to other racers (Which is somewhat difficult when said racers have upgrades you do not. Like engines and boosters.) What is worse still, my upgrades in one tier count for... Nothing beyond being able to beat *that* Tier, of *that* campaign, with *that* craft. And Time Trial times require not only those upgrades, but a flawless line.

I want to like Quantum Rush Champions. But it doesn't let me. Needing multiple attempts and specific unlocks to achieve even a silver medal is not fun. Needing to do it every racing class is not fun.

To sum up this game simply, it's basically a Wipeout clone. For those unfamiliar, Wipeout is a game originally released for Playstation systems. It's a ""futuristic"" racer that excelled with strong AI and great mechanics. This game wants to be a spiritual succesor on the PC, but it doesn't quite get there.

That's not to say it's entirely awful. It looks very good. While the tracks lack oomph or big moments, they're fine and the art designers should be proud of the work they did on this game. There's one track that goes into an underwater tunnel and I liked the way the tube was designed. Things like sound effects and music, while not spectacular, do the job and do not take away from the experience. I also liked the weight that the vehicles seemed to feel. Turning was not cumbersome and for the most part bar one key gripe, ""driving"" was well done.

Where this game truly suffers is in races, which for a racer is obviously a really big problem. AI is bland and the lack of depth really hurts the game. I found myself bored quickly, and considering how high I hold the aforementioned Wipeout, this really sapped my interest in Quantum Rush. The lack of a multiplayer mode hurts replayability as single player races, despite varying modes (i.e. Death Match/Courier/Career etc) just don't feel fleshed out or interesting at all. Another aspect I found really tough to adjust to was I never felt the speed. The odometer reads over 800 km/h and it just doesn't seem like you're going that fast. There's a variety of different weapons you pickup over a course, but they lack any pizazz or help keep the race interesting. It would have also been nice to have an intro/tutorial immediately upon starting the game, but this gripe would've been overlooked if the final product itself was better.

All in all I cannot recommend Quantum Rush for a purchase. If you find it as a part of a bundle, I'd say to go ahead and give it a whirl, but the lack of depth really makes me doubt I'll bother with it ever again.",1433914977,1433914977,False,42,2,0.713602840900421143,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Was ist Quantum Rush Champions?[/h1]
Quantum Rush Champions [i](von hier an als QRC abgekürzt)[/i] ist ein sehr schnelles Rennspiel, welches in der Zukunft handelt. Fahre mit über 1000 km/h durch einen Unterwassertunnel, eine Raumstation oder über einen Strand und versuche, den ersten Platz zu erreichen und dabei noch die Gegner zu zerstören. Neue Karten oder Bauteile sowie bessere Fahrzeuge schaltet man im Karriere-Modus frei, in dem man Herausforderungen absolvieren muss. Es gibt verschiedene Spielmodi, welche von einem einfachen Rennen über Paket-Einsammeln bis zu Deathmatches gehen. Auch gibt es viele Powerups im Spiel, welche jedoch meistens zum töten von Gegnern gedacht sind.

[h1]Detailliertes Review[/h1]
Erinnert sich hier noch jemand an ""Quantum Rush Online""? Es war fast das exakt gleiche Spiel, jedoch kostenlos und komplett online, dafür aber mit Pay-To-Win-Mechanik. QRC ist der bessere Nachfolger von QRO, wobei QRC nur Singleplayer bietet. Die Computergegner sind im Karriere-Modus leider viel zu stark, wobei die Schwierigkeit im Arcade-Modus auswählbar ist. Es ist nervig, dass man die Karten für den Arcade-Modus erst über die Kampange freischalten muss, aber es motiviert einen im selben Moment auch, weiter durch den Karriere-Modus zu spielen. Die Grafik von QRC ist sehr gut und futuristisch, und der Soundtrack passt auch. Die Sounds sind ebenfalls passend. Die Standard-Steuerung mit der Tastatur ist nicht besonders gut, jedoch ist sie in den Optionen anpassbar - Gefällt einem das Spielen mit der Tastatur nicht, kann man jederzeit auf einen Controller umsteigen, sofern man einen hat. QRC hat mehrere Spielmodi, wobei die meisten von ihnen Spaß machen. Generell macht der Arcade-Modus mehr Spaß als der Karriere-Modus, da der Karriere-Modus zu schwer eingestellt ist - Man muss jedoch die Karriere spielen, um mehr Karten, Fahrzeuge und Bauteile für diese freizuschalten. Insgesamt macht das Spiel Spaß, jedoch ist es sehr herausfordernd - Es ist also nichts für Leute, die es einfach haben wollen. Für jeden, der eine Herausforderung sucht, kann ich es nur empfehlen.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]
Quantum Rush Champions ist ein in der Zukunft spielendes Rennspiel, in dem man mit mehr als 1000km/h über die Rennstrecke fliegt. QRC ist sehr herausfordernd und demnach nichts für Spieler, die es einfach haben wollen, aber ich empfehle es jedem, der ein herausforderndes, schnelles, futuristisches Rennspiel sucht.

The graphics are probably good, but my build at the moment is not great so I play on lowest settings. There used to be some lag in tracks like Chthonic Crater, but now it is much better. On that note, the devs are really supportive. I asked for optimisation because of this lag, and it was implemented really quickly!

The gameplay is also very good. The difficulty is pushed towards the extreme, and a simple thing such as a time trial can take very long. I do not mind this at all, however, as I like a challenge. The gamemodes vary greatly, and go from fun (boss battles, that speed freak mode) to annoying (package collection). The game lasts for a very long time, and it seems like there will be more careers as I have only got up to tier 5 in the first NMW championship.

I like the music, but I eventually turned it off after it started repeating and used my own. The crafts handle well, but I'm not so sure on the airbrakes (I use them too much and they slow your craft down a lot). The only time I use the gun weapon is is the death races, so it proves quite useless.

- The graphics are nice (tracks are awsome!!!)
- The gameplay is a bit deeper than Wipeout (you can store up to three weapons to use, you can choose between them, you can use an accelerate button which overheats your engine and there's also a primary weapon you can use even without picking up anything which also heats the racer up).
- The soundtrack is in the same style as Wipeout. Not my favorite in any case but fits the game.
- Another plus I didn't expect is that the game is running very smoothly, eventhough my machine is 8 years old (Core2Duo 2,4 GHz, 3 GB RAM, GeForce 9800 GT 1 GB)

Now the bad parts.
- It has gotten stuck a couple of times during the loading screen. 
- The game menu isn't so clear and easy to use from the beginning. You'll need some time to get used to navigating the menu.
- The cursor remains visible always.
- Difficulty of the game is unsensible.

Neutral
- Would be better to have access to more tracks and racers from the beginning.
- I guess it's made for XBOX-like gamepads so my Rumblepad 2 is recognized as an XBOX gamepad, which makes it difficult to set custom controls, but it still works fine after.

Como los anteriormente mencionados, aquí utilizarás una potente nave anti-gravedad para competir, pero a diferencia de los otros (excepto Star Wars) aquí podrás utilizar diferentes armas para tomar ventaja en la carrera.

Mientras eres propulsado a gran velocidad gracias a los poderosos cohetes anti-gravedad, tendrás que derrotar al resto de los competidores que no te lo pondrán fácil, en diferentes modos de juego que pueden ser mas divertidos o no que la ya mencionada campaña te enfrentarás a multitud de desafíos diferentes que pondrán a prueba tus habilidades.

Durante el transcurso de la carrera irás recogiendo diferentes boost que te ayudarán a eliminar a tus rivales, cortinas de humo, cañones frontales e incluso cohetes serán algunos de los que podrás hacer uso.

También podrás hacerte con diferentes boost que potenciarán las habilidades de tu vehículo, incrementado su velocidad o desafiando la gravedad para lograr alocados saltos. Al inicio tendrás que elegir entre un par de fabricantes, que determinarán algunas de las estadísticas iniciales de tu nave.

An excellent Anti-Gravity Racer, QR is well worth picking up. Especially when you consider its indie price tag. 
For those who insist on drawing comparisons to other games -
F-Zero focuses more on speed and wide, flowing tracks, WipEout focuses more on technical tracks with tight handling and narrow roadways. QR is a happy middleground. It feels competitive with F-Zero in terms of pace, but has some more technical tracks that feel more remiscent of WipEout. 

Gameplay is well paced and deep enough to keep players engaged for a while, without being overly complicated to deter new players. There are plenty of game modes that keep the game varied and interesting. Track variety is still expanding at the time of writting. With over 10 tracks, each of which with a forward and reverse variant, the game is already ahead of most WipEout titles.
Control-wise the Racers feel a bit stiff. Other AG Racers tend to have more ice-like vehicle handling but here the vehicles behave like they were superglued to the road. Hopefully this is something that Game Art Studio will address in the future.
It's also interesting to note that this games Airbrakes cause the vehicles to rapidly decelerate, which is rare for this sort of game.

Racer variety is disappointing. The vehicles are divided by tier, and they plan to have 10 tiers in the finished game, which should be cool. Unfortunately, there are only 3 vehicles per tier to choose from, which just isn't enough variety. Race grids quickly become samey and boring. Compared to any other racing game, 3 Racers is a tiny selection.

Keyboard controls are impossible to use, so I strongly recommend using a controller. The Controller configuration is excellent and as a former WipEout player, I found them instantly recognisable.

Visually the game is very nice. Nothing amazing, but you'd be hard pressed to complain. When you're flying past scenery at 1,000Km/H or more it doesn't really matter.",1424724434,1424795403,True,6,1,0.530788064002990723,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is an example of a game that could be very good, but because devs choose not to listen (just look at the forums), its a flop. All this game has going for it right now is pretty visuals. If the devs fix things my opinion may change, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Beautiful game 
- Runs smoothly
- Music is good I guess (nothing for or against it)
- Normal race event is fun

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- No Dpad support is a huge oversight. Using RS for the menus is annoying and slow and using it for the hex grid in-game race menu up is a g0ddamn nightmare
- Unskippable race intros, if you have to repeat a race get ready to re-watch the intros for the umpteenth time.
- Unenjoyable and frustrating race events.
- Extremely obtuse item pick ups. Whenever you pick-up an item you'll be left with this exact thought ""What did that do?""
- Collision detection feels off at times, I missed quiet a few pick-ups, bumped into walls while on the ceiling exiting a tunnel which reduces your speed and in one event causes your boost timer to restart.
- Boss battles are garbage, boss gets a 3+ second lead and you have to drive through certain rings to send shock blasts until you catch up as pick-up are restricted for bosses. 
- Game lacks attention to details making the races feel rather dull. During some races you drive over water or sand and there's not even a particle of water or dust kicking up or spreading out from the base of your vehicle. You might as well be driving over metal.
- AI is the perfect cheater, it takes corners at full speed disregarding the brakes entirely without even bumping into the walls. They sometimes however crash into walls so I don't know.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
This game needed more time and play testing to figure out the quirks. Now before anyone says you're only judging it so harshly because you played WipeOut. Let me say this, I never played a Wipeout or F-zero game. The only futuristic racing game I played and loved was Roll Cage, Roll Cage: Stage 2. Those games were the sh!t and this game lacks everything that made those games fun.

After playing QR online for some time, I immediately bought QR Champions in early access tu support the devs. And as usual, I regret having bought an EA game... Here are some of the obvious flaws I've encountered, I've already listed that on the forum, and other players complained about them too, but it seems that the devs just don't give a damn about user feedback :

- the menus with a gamepad don't work really well, it's OK sometimes, and other times it's a chore, almost impossible to navigate

- the mouse cursor doesn't disappear when using a gamepad

- there is absolutely no damage feedback, most of the time your shield and armor just suddenly disappear and you don't even know who or what hit you

- primary weapon is useless, most if the time you just shoot the ground because the tracks aren't made to use this kind of weapon. Also you have to push the button each time you want to shoot... when it's supposed to be a rapid fire weapon.

- ""collisions"" problems. And by collision I mean the hit detection of boosters and items. Sometimes you will take a booster even if you miss it by 2 meters, and sometimes you will be exactly on the booster but you're ship doesn't accelerate. Same for the pick-ups, I even saw an enemy behind me get the item I was going to take

- there is absolutely no way to know what an item does, most of the time the icon sucks, and even when you use the item, you don't really know what it did

- there is ""that guy"". You know ""that guy"" ? Almost every racing game has it, it's the nearly unbeatable ennemy that is always first, way ahead of the others for no reason because he is supposed to have the same ship, and seems completely cheated. Even when you get ahead of him, he manages to save and use all his energy at the end of the race to overtake you.

- they removed the cash. In QR online, even when you lose a race, you earn some cash, so you didn't play for nothing. It's not the case here, and the game is so difficult that you'll have to restart again, and again, and agin, the exact same race, earning nothing, just to beat ""that guy"". The game becomes a useless grind really fast, except that there is nothing to grind...

- stupid game modes. For example there is a mode where you have to grab packages on the track. Thing is, the AI doesn't seem programmed to do the same, so they just run a regular race, shooting each others and trying to reach the line first. And, as YOU have to kinda explore the track to find the packages, you will spend the entire race alone. It would be nearly impossible to grab the packages with the other guys around anyway...

- death race sucks. Yup, generally death races in racing games are fun, really fun. Mario Kart, F-Zero, Gas Guzzlers Extreme, it's fun. Not here. Here it's a chore, too. First, for the reasons I already mentionned : primary weapon shooting straight into the ground, bad hitbox on items icons making you miss them all the time, weapons that do nobody-knows-what, and generally useless... you got the picture. But there are even more flaws I didn't talk about. For example I noticied that ennemies don't give a damn about their energy, they generally don't use the  blue tracks to regenerate it, but still they manage to be hard to kill. Also, you never know your position during a race like that : are you first with the most kills ? Where are you on the track compared to others ? Are you far behind and you have to boost to join them ? Generally, the AI manages to go really fast, using their boost like they don't have any energy limit, while happily shooting at each other to have a max of kills, and leting you far behind. They also take almost ALL the items, leaving you with nothing but useless ones, when you are already struggling to keep up with them. This makes the game absolutely not enjoyable, I re-started a death race like 10 times and the best I could do was 7th with 3 kills... IF you manage to got a good weapon that does some damage, it's generally not enough to kill a guy, you will just damage him enough to allow another ennemy to kill him...

- the upgrades we win makes no sense : why do they seem weaker than the base equipement ? 

- most of the musics really suck, I deactivated it after 2 or 3 races. But the game is even more boring without it... I have nothing against electro, it's generally the norm for futuristic racing games, but those ones just suck.

Well I could go on and on listing everything wrong with the game, but it takes time and I have better games to play. I've waited for months for them to correct the flaws of early access, and they kinda did nothing ( well at least they corrected the menus with the pads... ). Too bad, QR Online really seemed to have the potential to bring back the old F-Zero and Extreme-G feeling.

The feeling of speed is great, and while some things tend to be a bit annoying, it makes them feel extra rewarding when you finally manage to win. This would be different if you´d be penaltied for things you have no influence on, but especially boss levels that feel unbeatable and unfair at first become very easy once you figure out the best strategy. For example, if a boss has strong forward-directed weapons, it might best to stay close behind him and overtake him just before the finish line. Or, on tight, twisting tracks, you might be able to get an advantage by using all your boost immediately so you are always one turn ahead and lock-on weapons or straight missiles can´t hit you.

It has different race modes, including Normal races, Death matches, time attack, hit the target, and damage control - a mode where you get faster and faster as long as you manage not to hit the walls.

In the arcade mode there are also many ways to customize your races. You can set the amount of laps and opponents, change AI difficulty and even change things for the specific race modes. For example for Death matches you can change weapon damage or you can change how fast your speed increases in the damage control mode.

The career mode is separated into different tiers. At the end of every tier you have to defeat a Boss with special abilities like a special weapon arsenal. After defeating them, you unlock the next tier that uses faster ships. The first tier may feels a little slow, but it definitly gets a lot faster on the higher tiers.

On the downside the gameplay mechanics are not always smooth, and the features don't always make sense as a whole. I have played many arcade racers before, and in my opinion for example the balance between having slower, harder and faster, easier tracks is not right. Generally it is good to have different track Layouts, but in this game some tracks are really tight, while other tracks are extremely wide with very long straights so that you get bored on the faster tracks after you have played one of the harder tracks. Also you can't change difficulty for career mode. The medal requirements are balanced in a way, so that getting gold is hard while getting bronze is easy. Especially for Boss races that is a problem. You get bronze for defeating him, while silver and gold require a certain time. While the Bosses can be very challenging for casual players, they only feel like a normal time attack race for good players. After a few seconds you will have a big enough gap so that you will never see them again for the rest of the race. The gold medal requirements are still hard, but it isn't really a race against the Boss anymore.

Overall the game is still fun and has a fair amount of content for a game that is in Early Access and only costs 5 bucks. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a sidenote: There is another reviewer claiming that a friend of the devs would spam negative comments on his review and downvote his review using alternate accounts. I wrote a few comments on his review and I am sure he is talking about me.

I just wanted to say, that I am not a friend of the devs, I didn't downvote his review. using alternate accounts and I also didn't ask friends to downvote his review. (Look at my other posts in the game discussion, I gave positive AND negative feedback before)

The only thing I did is correcting him in one point. He claimed that Bosses would ""rubber band hard"" and would be too hard to beat. Of course saying that they are too hard is okay, that is just an opinion and I know that others also have problems beating the Boss. But it simply isn't ture that they are ""rubber banding hard"". I think it wasn't his intention to spread false information, instead he just misinterpreted the fact tha first Boss has very low acceleration and very high top speed, so that they naturally will be slower in the beginning and faster in the end. So that's really not a big deal. 

But after I commented on his review and said that this isn't true, he simply deleted my comment. (I was really surprised that authors of a review can simply delete comments they don't like. How are we supposed to criticize bad reviews if they simply can delete any criticism?) I posted it again, and he deleted it again. The next time I asked him whether he could tell me why he is deleting my comments and why he can't just explain to me why he is deleting my comment, but he also deleted this comments. I asked him again... and apperantly this is enough for him to call me a ""spammer"" and also enough to claim that I would manipulate his reviews. And ALSO enough to also make false claims about the developers of the game and therefore trying to damage their reputation. So... please be careful when looking at the reviews.",1416087680,1416087680,True,7,0,0.570445477962493896,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Bosses rubber band hard. You hit everything and not miss a single boost and eventually get ~3 seconds ahead of them? Haha don't worry, they'll be right up your back-side any second now to smash you from 100% to 0% armour in no time with their overpowered and limitless weapons.

The free/basic weapons every ship has are nigh-useless and a waste of time and distraction. Should limit all weapons to pick-ups only.Destroying pickups should replenish some of your armour--as far as I've seen there isn't any way to replenish your armour aside from being destroyed.

Hard to recommend this game, it really is. It's still in early access but these games rarely fly off well over time. I really want a futuristic racer (anti-grav), I really do. But taking a game like this seriously only slaps your face.

To the devs; play and take note of the WipEout series. The closer to this you'll be, the better.

Update: 10/11/2014

Still no way to replenish armour--again, unless I'm somehow missing something.

Airbreaks are still pointless if you do more than just tap it. If you ever hold it in you'll do much more harm than good.

AI racers seem to never airbreak and seem to turn around every corner at full speed while players need to perfect the track in their mind and muscle-memory to ever come close. High-turn tracks are nigh-impossible to come first place in.

The game seems more and more to be a achieve first-place in the first 10 seconds of the race and maintain it or you'll never get it. So many times I get first place very quickly and hold it with no competition at all. Not a single thing hits me or comes close. Here I am at first place with the second racer ~5 seconds behind with all the other racers fighting eachother and keeping eachother back while I'm boosting ahead and hitting every boost.

There's no come-back mechanic at all. Because once first place has first place and gets a couple second advantage, it's over. Second, third and so on keep fightning and smashing eachother to just keep first place in first place.Not a single weapon/pick-up helps this at all. There are just a handful of close-quarter weapons.

Upgrades for your craft are too few and far inbetween. Especially since each tier has their own set of gear/unlocks. The system should be in points and you get points after every race you complete and you pick what you want to level up. Want more speed? Upgrade your engines. Want a stronger hull? Upgrade your hull. So on and so on. Not this random, rare drops that don't even seem to change much to begin with. By the time you finish a tier you have a few unlocks where some things are still stock-standard.

The basic/free weapons that every ship has all the time are awful and very distracting. Again, these really should be removed. They do very little damage and if you ever plan on hitting something, you'll be focusing mostly on aiming and shooting rather than racing. These are a really bad idea and I struggle to think of any good idea (let alone concept) as to why people would this this is a good idea, then add it in and then actually keep it in. It'd baffle me if anybody actually likes these.

The vehicles release a constant black smoke when they're low in hull/armour which constantly fills out ~90% of the track with black smoke. Makes it impossible to properly race if you're anywhere behind them since the smoke trail is very long and lasts a long time. Covers most of the width of your average track.

There's no minimap either which is another con.

Conclusion: Game is still very frustrating and painful to play. It isn't a casual game and seems as if the devs don't want for it to be. This just makes the game extremely more annoying to take seriously at all. So, game still sucks at this date. Game is riddled with cons with very few pros. Don't buy it.

There was some content patch recently. Didn't seem to do much but add some content (ie ships and tracks) I've noticed the main menu mid-race actually pauses now. Prior the race would still go on.

Also nice that the shills of the game keep thumbing this down with their alt accounts (yeah I know who you are)

This makes me want to plug my PS3 back in and play the only good anti-grav racer: WipEout.

Do note: I'll be deleting and resubmitting this review since a particular friend of the dev kept spamming the same negative comment to this game review for over a week while making an alt account every day just to thumb my review down. This kind of attitude is sickly and this is all I can do about it.

Said person is monitoring and policing all reviews and forum posts about this game and can not take a single hint of negativity for this game. A shame yet another game is riddled with devs and friends of devs that can't take critcism at all. This has never brought anything good in the long run. Only cancerous people.

The menu screens are very unresponsive, and the loading screens take a very long time.

The racing feels pretty close to Wipeout or FZero.  That's what I expected.  I'm going to enjoy this game once it gets polished a little and has its major bugs worked out.  I recommend waiting until the game is more playable before buying it, but if you want to take a leap of faith, go ahead and buy it while it's on sale.

Though the engine is stable, nice-looking, and generally very functional, there is little depth or challenge to the movement physics, leaving even casual fans I've introduced the game to playing dull, easy races. Though I certainly applaud the developers for trying something new, the addition of heat tracking, a permanent rapid-fire weapon, and the ability to pick up and store three weapons instead the traditional one adds little to the game as they are currently implemented, instead cluttering what has proven to be a very focused and effective formula in other series.

My experience playing a number of Wipeout and F-Zero games has colored my opinion, without question, but the fact of the matter is GameArt Studio are making a game in a subgenre that has produced some of the best racing games ever created, and that's hard to live up to, no matter who you are. Unfortunately, the current state of the game, though technically solid, lacks a focused enough design to make an impression, not only in the hovercraft-racing subgenre, but the racing genre as a whole. I would be more than willing to give future builds a second chance if the design moves toward expanding unexplored elements of the genre, instead of the current design, which seems little more than ""What was done before, but with more stuff tacked on.""",1414121114,1414121114,False,11,0,0.609941661357879639,4,True,False,True,False,,1415190426.0,"hello,

It's not Wipeout nor F-Zero, with that out of the way, it's fast. It doesn't look great, it doesn't handle sharply as other hover racers. But damn, it gets fast.

Game currently has 7 tiers of racecrafts (each faster than the previous)

It has all the classic modes you can imagine, death match, classic race, time attack and it also has a boost race which gets insanely fast.

The new batch of circuits and game modes is great but some suffer from significant FPS drops in modern systems that should be able to handle this game without a problem, once you go tier 5 and up, the pace completely changes, circuits are 3 times bigger and have a lot of loops and corkscrews, different paths and obstacles to avoid.

Tier 7 reaches the 1800 km/h without boosting. 

New game modes include a thread the needle checkpoint race, a deathmatch variant with objectives, a package pickup race (whoever picks up more wins) and new varied boss battles.
