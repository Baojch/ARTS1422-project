All of this is in addition to the change of mechanic where it is no longer a 'search and find' puzzle, it is staring at your screen for half a lifetime waiting for something to move and for a lifetime more to realize that the last item is smaller than your cursor (again, pretentious). The shifting items was a fun little side quest in other games like 'Dire Grove' but it is deplorable as a main mechanic.

Поэтому когда они появились на Стиме (да ещё и по весьма приличной цене), я купил их все...

...и немедленно пожалел. Старые, первые части интегрированы со Стимом из рук вон плохо: они идут в окошке, в ""родном"" для них разрешении, которое не превышает 1024х768. А для Hidden Objects это катастрофа, если на экране с трудом можно что-то разобрать.

Наконец, перебирая их все подряд, я дошёл до первой рабочей -  13th Skull. Ничего особенного, обычная Hidden Objects новой волны: простенькая адвенчура, в которую плохо интегрированы собственно картинки с поиском предметов.

Сейчас, от нечего делать, запустил Escape From Ravenhearst, чисто потупить перед сном. Начало ничем не выдающееся (разве что Hidden Objects-картинки выделяются, но об этом ниже), и поначалу это всё то же, всё так же: инвентарь на несколько предметов, три-четыре локации, простенькие головоломки. Но стоит пройти чуть дальше, загадки начинают усложняться, а потом игра внезапно превращается ... в абсолютно полноценную хоррор-адвенчуру в духе 7th Guest! (Ну, во всяком случае, в ""экспертном"" режиме, не знаю, как там в Basic). С 7th Guest они очень похожи: здесь тоже героине противостоит злобный маньяк с паранормальными способностями, и тоже сюжет состоит в последовательности более-менее мрачных сцен (ну, честно говоря, и сюжет здесь тоже, как и в 7-м госте - не самое сильное место, но тем не менее на нервы давит. И звуковое сопровождение весьма этому помогает). Но что куда важнее, тут тоже всё набито очень неплохими головоломками! Более того - редкое явление даже в мире полноценных адвенчур - все головоломки совершенно логичны, и если решение не самоочевидно - где-то есть чёткое указание, что именно и как надо делать. Вот только догадаться, где же ключ (и что это именно ключ) бывает очень непросто (зачастую это указание находится к тому же за несколько локаций от самой головоломки - и это отдельный плюс). Лично я, к стыду своему, завалил две задачи: у той, что с ростом, я не нашёл, куда ключ применить (при том что, задним числом, это было очевидно, блин), а в финальной ключей просто не заметил. :(

Так вот, об обязательных Hidden Objects: здесь они интегрированы крайне своеобразно: тебе не говорят, что именно ты ищешь, как это бывает обычно. Тебе известно только общее количество, а найти надо предметы, которые изменяют форму. При этом сама сцена интегрирована прямо с игровой локацией, без непонятной фигни в оформлении. Свежее решение! Не говоря уж о том, что позволяет избежать всех этих опостылевших сцен ""чтобы найти ключ, надо сначала найти яблоко, четыре шахматных фигуры, две пары очков и жука. Не спрашивайте, почему.""

Единственным серьёзным недостатком игры является её нестабильная работа в Win10. Временами (прямо с третьей большой локации и до самого конца) при нажатии кнопки перехода в другую комнату ничего не происходит, а игра зависает навсегда. Переключиться в окно, вызвать менеджер задач, снять задачу, зайти в игру обратно: другого решения у меня нет (игру-то можно закрыть и ""крестиком"" в окне, на самом деле - только она не закроется, менеджером всё равно снимать придётся). Подозреваю, что может помочь режим совместимости с Win98, но это от отчаяния: совместимость с ХР не помогает никак (а проверить 98 я не могу - сохранения игра делает в реестр, и при выставленной совместимости всё слетает, потому что реестр 98-я отрабатывает не так). Попробуйте в начале игры, вдруг поможет?

В целом - очень рекомендую любителям головоломок - и 7th Guest в особенности.",1594247250,1594361521,True,12,0,0.693006634712219238,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[i]Review based on Steam (SE) version. [/i]

People are disappearing in Blackpool, bringing our detective back to the gates of the now-ruined Ravenhearst Manor once again.

Options include separate sliders for Music, Effects and Environment, Windowed, Custom Cursor, Hi-def and Subtitles.  Choice of Casual or Master Detective (""Quit Holding My Hand!"") mode.

What can I say about this game?  Big Fish was once again pushing the envelope when they developed EFR, so the gameplay is not like any other game out there.  There are no lists, no silhouettes, no items to return to the scenes...  Instead, what we have is an adventure game with [b]M[/b]orphing [b]O[/b]bject [b]S[/b]cenes.

[b]How it works:[/b]

The ghosts of Ravenhearst cannot help you directly, but they can alter the appearance of objects for a brief time.  When you come upon a [b]MOS[/b], the number of items you need to find will be pictured in Emma's locket, which you carry with you during the game.  Finding these spiritually-charged articles will enable the spirits to call your attention to a specific area of the scene.  In other words, they help you find items that will be helpful in your investigation.

There IS a rapid-misclick penalty... Morphing items you've already found will be returned to the scene!

[b]Story:[/b]

The story is told in a variety of ways, from encounters with the ghosts of Ravenhearst to journal entries to news clippings to live-action cutscenes.  The acting is pretty good, with the occasional over-the-top, [i]CAN YOU FEEL ME NOW?[/i] performance. *snicker*

If you read the game's description, you will have hopefully noticed the [b]WARNING[/b] there.  When they say that this is an intense psychological thriller, they mean it.  I won't spoil anything here, but some of the scenes you'll encounter and tasks you'll be required to do can evoke feelings ranging from discomfort to disgust to dread to Oh-my-god-I'm-going-to-have-nightmares-tonight!

[b]Sights and Sounds:[/b]

Some of the artwork in this game is absolutely breathtaking.  I do have special feelings towards this game since I was at Big Fish's pre-release party, but this is not just nostalgia speaking.  I so wish that the devs had included wallpapers in the CE version, as there are some I-want-to-frame-this-and-put-it-on-my-wall scenes.  Lucky me, one of the artists shared some of the promo posters with me, so I actually have them on my wall! :elkgrin: 

The soundtrack is beautifully mood-setting, as you would expect from a Ravenhearst game.  Quality sound effects and environmental tracks round out the sound package nicely.

[b]Interface:[/b]

We have a retractable, scrolling toolbar that holds any items we find, per usual.  We do NOT have [b]HINTS[/b] during the adventure portion of the game, although hints are available during the MOS scenes.  The rate at which they refill depends on which gameplay mode you choose.

[b]Puzzles:[/b]

We have a lot to read in our [b]journal[/b], but even if you're playing on Casual Mode, there will be neither hints, nor puzzle solutions documented by our intrepid detective.  You're going to have to actually write the clues down yourself, folks!  Since this is the standard edition of the game (hence no strategy guide), you'll very likely need the [url=https://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/walkthrough/mystery-case-files-escape-from-ravenhearst-walkthrough/]WALKTHROUGH[/url] at some point, so enjoy that handy dandy link!

Puzzles are [b]SKIPPABLE[/b]... Mostly.  When a puzzle requires the use of an inventory item, there is no SKIP available.

[b]What is the CE Content?[/b]

For those curious about what Bonus Content was included with the CE, I'll list it here:
[i][b]NOT available in the Steam version[/b][/i]
[list]
[*]Strategy Guide (pictures only, no text)
[*]Morphing Items in the Journal (find them all to unlock two black & white, classic-style hidden object scenes)
[*]Door tokens
[/list]
Door tokens, for those who aren't familiar, are small circular partial-images that go into your inventory.  You have to ""charge"" the tokens by placing the images back into the scenes from which they were taken.  There is no distinguishable pattern to where these pieces might have come from, so it's a real challenge to find where they all belong.  You cannot proceed past a certain point in the game until you charge and place them all, so the CE is actually much more difficult than the SE version!

There is no bonus chapter in the CE, so you won't be missing any of the story if you play this (Steam) version.

[b]Verdict:[/b]

This third visit to Ravenhearst manor is not for children or the faint of heart, as the story is truly twisted and disturbing.  Although the idea of morphing object games never caught on, [i]Escape from Ravenhearst[/i] is beautifully put-together, and outstanding as only a Mystery Case Files game can be.  Absolutely recommended for adventure-lovers and fans of the Ravenhearst storyline.

The content warning was inadequate. I didn't blink through any of the gross out or gory parts, but I don't think one has to be ""faint of heart"" not to want to listen to ambient child abuse sound effects while playing a casual hidden object game. I'm not talking about a scene within the *context* of the story - I am talking about using it as background noise. If someone on the development team said ""Is this possibly in poor taste?"", please listen to them next time. If no one on the development team said that, please reconsider your hiring practices.

With those sound effects muted, there are other points that can be used when determining whether or not to recommend this game ...

The use of morphing ""hidden"" objects almost exclusively (I remember one list-style hidden object puzzle) was a negative for me. Imagine playing a classic hidden object game but the objects you are looking for blink occassionally. To me, it feels like cheating. The only challenging ones were the letters (because of their size). Many hidden object games will scatter morphing objects for achievement hunting, but this is the first I played that made it the primary mechanic.

I found it strange that there wasn't even a single sentence to explain the puzzles. A couple were completely unintuitive and visually cluttered, making it difficult to know what was part of the interface versus the scenery.

Dennis Kleinsmith did a great job as Charles. He reminded me of some of the classic, eloquent Dr. Who villains that children can be scared of while still having fun. It's really too bad this story couldn't back off its more unseemly elements and be accessible to younger players. The writing is split between adult and juvenile content in such a jarring way. The grubby old degenerate chicken-dancing in the final level is a testament to that.

Good Lord - I didn't think I would ever write that sentence in a review. This game is just too much of a mess to recommend.",1541386032,1541386127,False,5,7,0.540627658367156982,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual and Master Detective.

The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.

There is no map available in the game. Plenty of backtracking from location to location.

There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel does slide up when it is being moused over.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Morphing objects (beyond items.)

The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.

Miscellaneous

There are seven different trading cards to collect. Only four of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1520918282,1605076695,True,8,0,0.605656981468200684,4,True,False,False,False,,,

A lot of people were displeased that it changes to a game where you have to search for objects that shift in shape instead of objects on a list. I suppose some don't like change, but this did not bother me. I will admit it does get slightly easier than it was before, but they do attempt to raise the difficulty by replacing still, picture environments to search in, with moving backgrounds. Twitching leaves, running water; things that catch your eye more than the shifting objects. If you're really bothered about that I would stay away from the game, because the search and finds are less prominent in this game. As before mentioned, it made no difference to me, because in the Ravenhearst story, it's not really the gameplay, but the storyline, that's the main feature of the game.

If you've ever played the original MCF: Ravenhearst, you will know this to be true. The entire point of the first game is finding out the story behind Charles and Emma's relationship, and their affiliation with Rose and her two daughters. The second game is mostly the story of Charles' crimes; the story of how you find the mansion, find out what Charles has really been doing with the place, and attempt to stop him and save what's left of the poor Rose and her daughters.
This game is Charles' story. As with any criminal, the backstory has a lot to do with their actions, and this game gives you a nice walk through Charles' memory lane (against your own wishes). I won't lie. It's messed up. But if you know what his crimes are, you'll probably expect that. If you don't know, then good luck. The game lives up to its name by the fact that you have to escape from Charles' meticulous trap and save Emma, Rose, and her two daughters. Again.

The art is fantastic, and I must give credit to Charles' actor. He really catches the sadistic and tormented side of Charles, and seeing as he appears to torment you quite often, you always have that cruel voice waiting for you wherever you go. I can't even fault any of the other actors, though Victor's dancing is the best comedy aspect of the game. That is just... wonderful. The story is a good level of creepy and shocking, and amongst all the puzzles and problems to solve, you get to do fun things like blow up Charles' mom with a pie.

All in all I don't think this game deserves the hate it's got, but maybe I'm biased because I'm not too bothered by the search mechanism. Sure it's a short game, but most search-and-find's are. The art is great, the actors are good, the storyline is really interesting, and the puzzles are challenging in a good way.
