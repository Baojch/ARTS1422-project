A very fun classic top-down shooter with a simple gameplay loop and variety of guns, perks, and game modes that runs perfectly on the Steam Deck.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Simple fun
+ Still holds up
+ Works well on Deck

[b]Cons[/b]
- Repetitive

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Crimsonland is a fun classic old school top-down shooter with a nice simple gameplay loop, a large number of guns, perks, and power ups keeping each run interesting and challenging along with extra game modes to give some variety. The sound work is decent and the graphics still holds up. The game runs quite well on the Steam Deck and can run for hours.

[b]Notes[/b]
Started playing Crimsonland on PC years ago and booted it up again on the Steam Deck to finish it off. Can attest the game runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck and can be played for hours. Although there is 1 game mode where you need to type out words to shoot enemies and it is a little finicky to play on the Steam Deck.
The game also allows you to bring in 3 other people to play with but I have not gotten to try this as I am mostly a Solo player.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
There are multiple game modes and a quest mode which is basically a ""story"" mode with 3 different difficulties to be completed sequentially. Quests can be quite challenging especially at the higher difficulties, coupled with the randomness of weapon drops, perk choices, and in my experience completing them it seems there are some weapons or perks that are disabled for some levels making things much more of a challenge in the higher difficulties.
The multitude of modes gives a nice variety to gameplay allowing you to choose how you want to play at the moment. The most biggest draw to Crimsonland is really the classic survival mode that it originally came with before having all the extra modes added over time. The simplicity of the gameplay loop, trying to survive as long as you can picking up new or your favorite weapons, picking up power ups to quickly wipe enemies, and choosing new perks to help you survive longer to get the highest score possible.
You are provided with a basic pistol at the start of most game modes and pick up other guns as you kill enemies as drops. There are a significant number of weapons to choose from but they need to be unlocked first by completing levels in quest mode. Each gun shoots differently and some have different effects giving a range of options to choose from or just a choice in what gun would be your favorite you'll likely stick with and look for whenever you're going for a run.
Perks are also a big component of the game and need to be unlocked in quest mode just like guns. Unlike guns perks aren't found like drops but as you ""level up"" from killing enemies and racking up points you're given a random set of perks to choose from. Similarly there are a ridiculous amount of perks to unlock and choose from, some are situational while others are probably a staple that you'll always take as soon as they show up.

[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]
Crimsonland has a top-down view and decent graphics, other than being a pretty old game at this point it really doesn't need anything more than what it is. Enemies are obvious, pickups are easily seen, and everything moves smoothly from enemies to bullets. So it really still holds up probably for many years to come.
Audio work is on point with enemies being fairly obvious when they enter the arena so you know what is coming, while guns have unique sounds and are distinct from one another. Music is limited with only a few that loops but its inconsequential.

Initially, the game may seem lacking in content, but as you progress through the campaign, it steadily introduces more and more content. Ultimately, the game offers a diverse experience, and its progression system opens up new possibilities for the player instead of simply increasing statistics, as many games with meta progression tend to do.

It might remind many of very popular game, Vampire Survivors, as there are indeed numerous similar elements. Both games involve destroying hordes of enemies with a top-down camera perspective. However, unlike Vampire Survivors, Crimsonland does not have auto-attacks, and in addition to movement, players must aim, shoot, and reload their weapons. This, in my opinion, makes Crimsonland more dependent on player skill than on building specific character builds, although build creation still plays important role, albeit not as significant as in Vampire Survivors.

In conclusion, I recommend Crimsonland to all fans of intense top-down arena shooters who prefer relying on pure gaming skill rather than intricately builds creation.

喔喔！和以前一样的感觉，和以前一样的味道，和以前一样的打法！还有比以前优化了的碎尸效果。
在我们的旧时代中，到底有多少游戏是不论多久都不愿意忘掉的？
不论放了多久，都仍然想要跟以前一模一样感觉去再打一遍的？
就是这么一个游戏，就因为它，我在日后的时光中玩遍了《孤单枪手》系列，玩遍了《R.I.P》系列，奋战过俄罗斯的《怒斩千军》，还耍过《邪灵入侵》，还有一堆那些记也记不起来名字的，最后一直到我被以撒的结合给彻底坑爹了我才缓下来劲。
可是！现在呢？今天呢？
好吧，就为这么一个简单的破游戏，我再一次就这么欲罢不能了……
你看你看！就因为它，让我激动得连好好地写个评测都不能了……
不在这废话了，我继续浴血奋战去了！！！杀啊！！！！！！

It is too indie for my taste and not entertaining enough to enjoy. Gameplay is pretty good, very enjoyable killing zombies and spiders, and the variety of weapons is vast. The roguelite elements are a gimmick and not really necessary, but it can swing your playstayle favourably. A lot of the perks are very creative and I wish other games would do the same. I think quests is the worst part of the game but to be honest, without it there would be only maybe 4 hours of gameplay.

-Gameplay: It is a basic twin stick shooter with a very annoying enemy AI that will try to surround you. All you do is arena kill enemies and survive. Not really the most entertaining repetitive gameplay loop as enemies do not really get stronger, just more plentiful and get annoying special abilties. It is good for maybe 4 hours, gets insanely boring and repetitive after that. 

-Quests: It is possibly the most annoying part of the game. Pigeon-hole an excessively tedious process to get 100% achievements just to elongate the game. Basically they are padding the numbers for hours played by forcing you to play each quest three different times, each one being a bit more difficulty. Really pathetic and tedious.

-Weapons: If most games of similar genres had the amount this game has, we would be spoiled. It is such a fantastic experience being able to try all the guns because of the random gun drop mechanic. Simply each gun feels unique and enjoyable to use. Some feel terrible like the ""Blowtorch"" but it has its value one you know how to play well, like most other weapons which have situations were they excel. Frankly, you will want an area of effect gun that can destroy everything.

-Random Drops: You want to have a high score? Get the ""Lucky"" perk and just watch how ""nukes"" and other random drops will destroy your enemies. It is fun to get around 8 drops in a row but it gets less fun and more essential, to the point that you might not get a single drop and it will ruin your run. It is great mechanic but maybe show up too often.

-Roguelite: It is really not strong. Sure some perks are highly creative and I found them refreshing, the maximum level I ever got was lvl 10 maybe. There aren't really any builds you can make and there are obvious perks that are insanely strong like ""poison bullet"" and just this perk can beat every single Quest in the game. I find the roguelite elements to be very poor.

-Co-op: Bloody fantastic. Who knew controlling 2 controllers at a time is exactly how you are suppose to play this game? Most of the tedious achievements, just use a 2nd controller and it will make everything trivial. Having Co-op is fantastic and I would be playing this with friends if there was an interest. Great implementation.

장점:
- 빈약해보이는 그래픽과 달리 의외로 폴리싱이 잘 되어 있다. 새 무기가 나오면 무조건 다음판에 첫 무기로 나온다던가.
- 호쾌하고 난이도가 크게 어렵지 않음.
- 기본에 아주 충실함.

단점:
- 도전과제가 좀 빡세다.
- 뭐 좀 해보려하면 스테이지가 클리어된다.
- 충돌 판정이 살짝 애매하다.

호드류 서바이벌의 기본을 아주 잘 지키고 있는 게임. 추천.

Можно записать в минусы, но энтропия тут довольно справедливая: удачная игра может быстро превратиться в неудачную. И наоборот. Как в камень-ножницы-бумага.

В целом норм. Я оригинал смутно помню, так что отпишусь без ностальгических очков.
Самая суть в игре это режимы выживания. Но нужно пройти ""одиночную кампанию"". Проходится за 30-60 минут, поэтому можно потерпеть. По ходу разлочишь все оружие и перки.
А потом начинается самое веселое - выживание. Было интересно подбирать тактику, чтобы продержаться подольше. Суть такова: [spoiler] если до 200-300к очков не нашел телекинез, то ты труп. На первых порах идеал это ионные пушки + заражение. Особенно хорошо против бесячих пауков, которые половинятся при смерти. А потом начинайте выискивать перк, усиливающий пламя огня и берите любой из дробовиков - я беру обрез или jackhammer. У первого разброс большой, у второго скорострельность. Потом нужны будут перки на спаун бонусов. повышенный уров во время замедления. Короче, под конец монстры просто забьют весь экран и у них будет много здоровья. И важжно постоянно подбирать бонус ускорения стрельбы и огненные пули. А потом что-то из трех: защитное поле, заморозку монстров или хотя бы замедление времени. Тогда просто постоянно будешь крошить монстров и набивать очки. 40 минут ушло на то, чтобы набить 200 млн в режиме ""волны"". [/spoiler]
В каком-то смысле это азартная игра, т.к. никогда не знаешь, какие перки дадут на выбор при прокачке, поэтому опасно :) а ведь интересно. Поубивать минут 30-40 самое оно.",1692865885,1693280049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

""Одного из"", ибо у истоков стояла и вторая игра - Alien Shooter, с которой я знаком хорошо

Однако несмотря на общую похожесть концепции, Алиен скорее про прохождение собранных вручную сюжетных уровней, а вот Кримса, как бы я выразился, скорее про ""рогаликовую"" вариацию, где на первом плане разовые забеги, перки и т.д.

Важность этой игры еще заключается в том, что в данный момент у жанра происходит перерождение, запущенное горячо любимой мной Vampire Survivors, и вот без существования Кримсы мне кажется этого бы не случилось 

Что до самой игры - она чудесно проходит проверку временем!

Т.к. это считай полноценный ремейк, в релизных обзорах присутствует много критики относительно сомнительности ряда решений, которые впрочем, как я могу понять, разрабы со временем исправили/изменили
Ну и приятным бонусом является то, что в комплекте идет и оригинальная игра 2003-его, которую я советую пройти перед обновленной версией, она коротенькая, лично прошел ее часа за 4, после этого ремейк смотрится еще лучше

Да и ремейк это эталонный - освежили визуал, баланс, добавили даже не щепотку, а прилично так нового контента, и лично по моим ощущениям играть в обновку сильно приятнее, чем в оригинал

Игра вышла в 2003 году, но получила переиздание в 2014 году с улучшенной графикой и новыми игровыми режимами.

Игровой процесс Crimsonland состоит из серии глав, каждая из которых состоит из нескольких волн врагов. Игрок должен уничтожать врагов и выживать по мере того, как волны становятся все сложнее и сложнее. В игре есть различные режимы, включая классический режим, режим выживания, режим ""Миссии"" и другие.

Одна из особенностей Crimsonland - это широкий выбор оружия. Игрок может использовать более 30 различных видов оружия, в том числе пистолеты, автоматы, ружья, лазерные пушки и многое другое. Кроме того, в игре есть различные бонусы, такие как ускорение, усиление оружия, дополнительное здоровье и т.д.

Графика в игре яркая и кровавая, что добавляет атмосферности и разнообразия. Кроме того, игра имеет хорошее музыкальное сопровождение, которое помогает создать напряженную атмосферу.

Общее впечатление от Crimsonland - это игра с простым, но захватывающим геймплеем, которая может заинтересовать любителей аркадных шутеров. Игра также поддерживает многопользовательский режим, что позволяет игрокам играть вместе или соревноваться друг с другом.

I find the visuals more crisp and clean, and I appreciate the reworks and balancing. 

The game's core is the endless survival mode, where you play for high-score. Enemies spawn in pseudo-waves, and every ~50k points a boss will spawn. Killing enemies drops weapons and power-ups, and score drives leveling which offers perks to increase your power. 

There's definitely a ""meta"" in order to get a high-score, consisting of both a good perk order, a good weapon (a shotgun-based), and understanding the super-late cycling of power-ups that is necessary in order to survive.

Сегодня на повестке дня у нас Crimsonland

Знакомство:
О игре я узнал из видео на ютубе ,игра мне понравилась,но тогда я как человек ,не знавший о стиме и игровых магазинах 
Спустя год или два ,я как уже почётный пользователь STEAM искал TOP-Down Shooter , тогда я снова встретил эту игру ,а также легендарный Helldivers


Геймплей:
Ну он прост как кирпич.Ходи ,стреляй во врагов (Несколько рас) ,хватай баффы ,при повышении уровня выбирай перк .
Казалось бы ничего сложного,но в игре (в компании) есть уровни сложности ,а также звезды за прохождение уровня без урона.
В кампании всего 7 глав , 3 уровня сложности , ииииии...
Выживания .
Это самое интересное в игре.
Введена система соревнования в виде таблицы результатов
Всего в игре 7 выживаний:
1.Базовый
2.Натиск
3.Сбор оружия (по моему мнению один из интереснейших режимов)
4.Ядерное безумие ( один из сложнейших )
5.Разгром (он же блиц)
6.Волны
7.Typ'o'shooter


Оружие и перки:
Оружия :
1. Пулевые (одни из самых бесполезных )   
2. Дробовые (дробовики)
3. Оружия Гауса (очень мощное ,но медленное оружие)
4. Плазменное 
5. Ионное 
6. Огнемёты
7. Ракетницы / Гранатометы
8. Огнеметы 
9. Особое (все остальное)


Перки :
Перки можно поделить на полезные ,слабые/бесполезные , имбовые 
Есть перки дающие странные эффеткы ,хилящие ,отнимающие хп ,улучшающие оружие и тд.

Саундтрек :
Все прекрасно. Металл и рок ,но треков маловато.


Итог :
По цене 1 игры мы получаем 3 версии одной игры . С огромным арсеналом ,списком перков и разнообразие 
Моя оценка игре 10 из 10

Alternatively, you need to take a break from work, but you can't start anything new on your work laptop? Crimsonland could help you in both cases. It's a traditional top-down shooter that bets everything on well-mastered game mechanics, a huge number of levels, weapons and monsters, and bloody satisfying gameplay.

From the very beginning, Crimsonland doesn't play games. It doesn't bother you with the story, it doesn't overwhelm you with elaborate or complicated graphics, and mechanically it is as primitive as it can be. You control a character who has found himself in the middle of a situation from which it is only possible to shoot through. And so you shoot in all directions, because problems are coming at you from all sides. Blood sprays in geysers, limbs and other body parts fly through the air.
The individual missions of the ""campaign"" aren't just about waves of enemies mindlessly rushing at you. Rather, on the contrary, each of them is in a way planned in advance and functions as a certain form of challenge. Enemies appear in a predetermined composition and are also cleverly designed in terms of movement, reproduction and attack. It means that you have to play each mission in a different way, because the tactics you mastered in the last mission may not work completely in the next mission. And don't be fooled by simple visuals or game mechanics - Crimsonland is a really hard game. [b] 20% [/b]",1659466588,1659466588,True,13,0,0.624835371971130371,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For example the weapon and perk pickup games are based entirely on the game deciding for you whether you're going to be allowed to live as you have no control over where the items spawn and what those items might be. It seems the game takes particular pleasure in never spawning a good weapon or speed perk when you really need one. 
The Waves and Blitz modes along with the traditional Survival mode are good though. 
You'll breeze through the Quest on the first two difficulty levels although some levels are very dependant on luck on the hardest ""Grim"" difficulty: If you don't get a good set of perks and weapons spawn then the levels with the ""Russian Doll"" spiders are impossible.

[h1] 不计其数的敌人们已经被老子一个人包围辣！ [/h1]

如果是在90-00年代国内盗版横行的游戏环境中成长起来的玩家，几乎都不可避免地接触过这样一个以搬运国外小游戏而闻名的合集作品-《幻想游戏系列》。

而《血腥大地》就是此系列中几个经典的扛把子代表作之一，一款经典的俯视角射击…如今这个年代应该叫“类吸血鬼幸存者游戏”了…
不过论资排辈，这个才是祖宗级的，游戏正式发售于2003年，该Steam版本为重制版，不但加强了画面、添加了新武器新天赋新任务，还支持了官方中文。

这游戏就主打一个爽。
以俯视角在山呼海啸般的敌人围杀努力存活，通过不断战斗升级武器天赋，最终杀出重围…

尽管乍看上去有点Kuso，但这玩意能在一代人童年占据一席之地还真不是浪得虚名，一上手就会发现《血腥大地》各种武器的射击手感出奇的优秀，打击感竟然不逊于第一人称！
游戏画面非常粗糙，但“糙”反而成为其爽快的根源，每干掉一个丑陋的怪物都会血浆四溅，伴着重金属摇滚和子弹时间尽显暴力美学，尤其爆炸清屏特别解压，臭豆腐般的浓烈芬芳扑面而来…

当然以现在的眼光，游戏的体量实在太小，普通难度不到十小时通关，当你多年来遍览各种3A大作后，偶然间再把本作翻出来体验，《血腥大地》给予玩家的爽快显然已经不是来源于画面技术或游戏设计，而是源自于那逝去的美妙童年。",1656928043,1707041086,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,True,,,

However, I was young and easily entertained back in 2003. Terrible design decisions, erratic balancing, and repetitive gameplay were easily paved over with the satisfying click of gauss weapons and the screen getting painted red. Nowadays, though, games have just generally gotten better to the point where Crimsonland's archaic design doesn't hold up.

First and foremost, the game is centered around random pickups. The weapon itself (with few exceptions) is fairly secondary outside of its relationship to the Fire Bullets pickup. This also spills into the Perk pool, where most perks are fairly pointless and every quest becomes trivial when you get Telekinesis. Because of the focus on pickups, there is little opportunity to have a ""build"" and gameplay quickly becomes repetitive.

The quests (campaign mode) are absurdly easy other than a few on Grim difficulty, where if you're unlucky on your initial weapon, initial perk, and a few pickups, you basically just lose. Otherwise, the main way to take damage comes down to enemies spawning on top of you.

I suppose if you want a mindless twin-stick shooter to play on the side, this game might be satisfying for a bit. Unfortunately, after playing games for all these years, I just find it boring now.",1656154282,1656154282,False,2,0,0.497487455606460571,0,True,False,False,False,,,

游戏难度中等，想要挑战高分排名，唯手熟尔！某些挑战，运气方面是关键，本地同屏联机也不失为一个好办法。
至于每一关想要打出无伤获得星星，设定上是有取巧成分的——系统判定只要过关时是满血状态，就能够获得无伤评价（玩过的朋友应该都懂我意思，知道如何达成）。

随着通过游戏中一个个关卡，你会逐步解锁各种武器和技能，这里重点说一下最后两把武器以及最后一个技能的解锁方法——
最后两把武器：只需要通关最后两个难度便会依次解锁。
最后一个技能：找到菜单里的“制作人员”选项，点进去后，拉到最下面会有一句话“这里隐藏着一些东西”，使用鼠标左键点击这句话会听见效果音，多点击几次之后，就会进入一个类似2048的小游戏。游玩这个游戏并且达到最低记录分（约五万三千多分），就能解锁最后一个技能。（说实话，没找到诀窍之前，我觉得这隐藏游戏比无伤关卡难多了！）

最后是性价比方面，史低价（9r）良好，经典老游戏也进过包，渠道购买就是骨折价。不管是刚入肉鸽坑的菜鸟，还是想为之前补票的老鸟，都是不错的选择！你TMD还在等什么呢？赶快购买入库吧！",1651936202,1651936895,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Dating back to Robotron 2084 in the arcades, I've long had an affinity for this breed of game when done well. Looking to scratch that itch, I picked up Crimsonland from my Steam backlog and gave it a twirl. First, I'll mention that it's an old game, originally released in 2003. So it isn't a modern-day looker, but I nevertheless found the visuals clean and impressive in their limited scope. There are a variety of ways to play from a quest mode with 70 levels along with three difficulties to a variety of survival modes and a Typing of the Dead kind of mode called Typ'o'Shooter. The main quest mode was fun and engaging. I finished the game on the first two difficulties, but 'grim' proved to be, well, grim. Hardcore - the middle difficulty - was a nice challenge as the levels progressed, causing the nice type of stress where you're so engaged that everything else falls away and you find yourself in a state of flow - a hallmark of a good twin-stick for me. The most fun I had with the game was in one of the survival modes called 'Blitz' though. It's an accelerated version of the regular survival mode where things amp up more quickly. The basics of this mode, and the main quest mode, is that you gain experience while playing stages, and that levels you up allowing you to select from a variety of 'perks' to aid your man with a plan. These perks can range from being radioactive, which causes sustained damage to the baddies in close proximity, to perks that grant you faster re-load, better firepower with your current weapon, faster experience, more power-ups appearing, having those power-ups be magnetized to your player causing them to float towards you, among many others. So as you level up and progress, there is this nice sense of strategy about picking the right type of upgrade, knowing that you'll have only so many as you try to stay alive as long as possible. It's also a fun type of lottery in the randomization of offered perks. On some chances to pick a perk, you'll not find anything that you're particularly interested in on the current run, and on others, you might want them all. There's also a perk to allow more perks to appear at each level gained, giving you a better chance to find just the right one. There's also a huge selection of weapons that drop in the killing spree. Some are significantly better than others, but most are viable, and many appear differently, both visually and in their practical/strategical application. There are also the aforementioned power-ups that are dropped which can really lead to greater havoc. From nuclear bombs that clear out big hordes around you, to spinning waves of fire, slow motion, increased movement speed, freezing all enemies, health bonuses and on and on, there are many beneficial drops that you want to desperately pick up - if you can get to them. When you're in a zone and you've got the right set of perks and power-ups dropping with hordes surrounding from all sides, the screen really comes alive in a beautiful dance of frenetic chaos that keeps you poised on the edge of your seat. Overall, I really had a good time with this in the 17 or so hours I played with it. It's not the cream of the crop in the genre, but it's great fun and I'm very happy I gave it some of my time. I can see myself returning for another set of runs on Blitz mode from time to time just to see if I can climb higher on the leader boards or just for the sheer enjoyment of the action.

Sin embargo por lo que más recuerdo esta belleza de juego es por lo atascado, es un verdadero deleite ""pintar"" ese suelo de rojo (de allí el nombre del juego).

Lo jugue hace muchísimo tiempo, y ahora que lo vuelvo a tomar me sorprende mucho... es como el de antes, pero mejorado y actualizado. No solo le agregaron logros, tarjetas de steam e integración para jugar con remoteplay, sino que también le han agregado varias mecánicas con los años, todo ello vuelven a hacer que valga la pena.

No recuerdo cuanto pagué por él, pero no es un juego caro, y si es un juego que vale cada centavo que costó. Se puede jugar con varios amigos al mismo tiempo y eso lo hace todavía más entretenido. No es un juego revolucionario, ni siquiera es un juego original, pero les aseguro que si le dan una oportunidad los mantendrá bastante entretenidos por unas buenas horas. Actualmente me encuentro enfrascado en un duelo con varios amigos de la época, queremos sacarle todo y ver quién logra los mejores marcadores ¡para esto son estos jueguitos, para sacarles todo el jugo posible!

No es un juego complicado (aunque si necesitarán un control con dos palancas si quieren ser pro) ni un juego con una basta historia, creo que la belleza de este juego radica en su sencillez y en que es muy directo: vas a machacar zombies, aliens y plagas en un festín de sangre que hará que te regocijes, en el camino probarás diversas armas y poderes que te ayudaran (o aumentarán el reto).

Right off the bat, if you bought this and just started, go into the menu and activate perks and 1.5 game speed. In my opinion that should be the default, but hope you find it in time before the game grinds you out.

So theres no story here, visuals and sound are quite simple.
Gameplay is a horde survival mode. Enemies spawn and you need to kill them to progress to the next level. Or you can play endless survival mode. 
Most levels you start out with a pistol, which becomes increasingly useless the further you progress. Enemies will drop a random weapon in the beginning and keep dropping random weapons the more you play. The more levels you complete, the more different weapons and perks you unlock that can be dropped. Map is always the same rectangle without any obstacles or modifications.
Im not sure if this is an issue or its by design, but a lot of later weapons are just improved older weapons. Like plasma machine gun instead of AK. The higher you go up, the less viable older weapons become, purely because they dont have the punching power. So its quite possible you can lose a round because you had a bad drop and it couldnt carry you long enough to get a better one. You also cant lock a weapon choice. Meaning if you accidentally ran over a weapon you didnt want, you will still pick it up.
Now the hordes. A lot of them are just variations of a default grunt. They change a skin for them when entering a new zone. There are unique ones as well. Invisible, fast and deadly, shooting, tanky, exploding. But the round variety usually is the default one with a unique one. It feels that way for me at least.
You need to kite them in a smart way, because they drop stuff when you kill them, so you need to be in a position to pick them up. They drop either weapons or power ups like health, nuke, freeze, other stuff. Problem is it can become so many you dont really have anywhere to kite to, unless the power ups clear some of them out.
You also dont see how enemies attack when they get close, leaving guess work if you will be hit or you can dodge.
Almost every level is a variation of you being swarmed. Sometimes it starts directly with units, others it puts pawn points you need to destroy.
The perks give you a random bonus once you kill a certain amount of enemies, it adds some variety. But the game doesnt show which perks you have active. Remember - turn the perks on in the options menu.
The gun spread can be quite annoying as well. Enemies are pretty small on the screen so aiming can be a hassle.
Weapons dont feel like they have a punch.

Apparently, this game (or a version of it) was originally created in around 2004. That makes a lot of sense. The simplistic graphics and gameplay, the disproportionately high review score. For a game from 2004, likely a free browser one, yes! I can see why people liked it back then. But for a game for 2014 and especially 2021 its very outdated in a lot of categories. Maybe while listening to something in the background to keep yourself busy, but not as a main experience.

TLDR - outdated, repetitive, tedious.

Every single level pretty much goes one of two ways:
-You get a decent weapon and/or perk, mow down all the enemies, get showered with powerups and can basically beat the level with your eyes closed.
-You get a worthless weapon and/or perk, you die to the massive hordes of bullet sponge enemies because you have zero damage or mobility whatsoever, and you can't spawn powerups because of the aforementioned zero damage.

Still, it's a surprisingly entertaining game, and for the little amount of money it costs these days, is definitely worth considering when deciding where to spend your cheddar...

It's a rogue-lite top-down twin-stick shooter with multiple modes of play, in which levels are beaten by killing everything in them with the various weapons & powerups you find there.  There's very little level ""design"", per se; each is a floor composed of different kinds/combinations of mobs, sometimes with respawn nests and sometimes without.  You never have the ability to see what's happening on the entire map, so discovery is limited to what your screen shows at the time.

This may sound boring, but it's more nerve-wracking than anything else.  The different mobs have varying abilities, but en masse, they're all dangerous.  Some move faster than others, some shoot or poison you, some split into multiple smaller mobs when shot, etc.  In most levels, they swarm at you from some part of the floor that you can't see, and thus don't know if there's a spawn point that needs to be killed or not.  Your own movement is frustratingly slow, and so you quickly discover that you need to do more than simply kiting mobs around the map (although that certainly is a large part of the gameplay.

You'll also discover that being able to hit things from a long ways off is both key and difficult.  You have an aiming reticle that shrinks when you're stationary as well as not firing; movement and gunfire decrease your weapon's accuracy, as indicated by an expanding reticle.  Let me be clear: you're almost always moving, so accuracy is something you have to manage.  So is ammunition, which never runs out, but forces you to have to reload at often very inconvenient times...

Luckily, the number of weapons and power-ups is significant.  Killing stuff also grants XP, and during the level, gameplay stops each time your level increases, allowing you to choose one of the perks the RNG offers you.  The combination of perks guns and powerups (which never last long enough) allows you to create effective builds, albeit limited by the way the components are randomly available to you.

The campaign consists of beating several tiers of levels at a specific difficulty.  Once you hit the highest difficulty (aka. Grim), the game becomes almost merciless, forcing you to rely upon focused builds.  Still, there are challenges (in-game achievements) to keep you busy as well - all of which lead to weapon/power-up unlocks.

[b]Crimsonland[/b] на пару - переиздание классического мясного-соусного инди-выживача.

Игровой процесс заключается в уничтожении или несчетных попытках уничтожения [strike]синюшным[/strike] синим [strike]думгаем[/strike] космодесантником всяких жуков-пауков, зомбей и креветок. Данное действие приправляется случайно появляющимися бахалками и бонусами, а также приобретаемыми по ходу забега умениями.

+ Включает в себе оригинальную версию 2003 о.-р.г., а также выбор визуализации между DirectX 9 или 11 
+ 70 заготовленных сценариев битв и 7 режимов бесконечного выживания
+ Плюшки-пушки-рок'эн'ролл
+ Локальный кооператив на 4-х (необходимо закупиться 3-мя грибковыми геймпадами!)
+ Gembine

- Сюжет, который подается только названиями уровней
- Для двух открывающихся сложностей 68 сценариев довольно просты
- Одно пустое (в геометрическом плане) поле битвы, на котором меняется только текстура поверхности
- 4 сопроводительные музыкальные композиции - Вы серьёзно?
- D3D11 всего лишь как-то пестрее и рисованнее
- Вшита реклама собственных игр
- Долбежка в Gembine за ачивкой сильно изматывает

Легко втянуться, тяжело отвернуться, можно никогда не вернуться!
Для тех, кому тема ""размазывания"" близка по духу или роду деятельности.

Отличия оригинала от новой чисто субъективные ощущения:
1. В новой перс еле ползает, что бесит, в старой по ощущениям бодрее.
2. В старой больше понравилась картинка.
3. В старой удобнее и информативнее интерфейс.
4. В старой при повышении уровня ты сам нажимаешь на повышение, когда удобно, в новой все прерывается часто в самый неудобный момент, в результате чего после повышения уровня меня убивают.

Короче игра хорошая, но зачем она сделана, когда первоначальный вариант гораздо лучше и бодрее играется - загадка...

Originally released in 2003, then remastered and re release for pc in 2014.

Playing from a top down perspective, Crimsonland is an incredibly arcadey twin stick shooter with very straightforward gameplay. While each level has an “objective”, you basically just have to kill everything in sight. Along the way you acquire different weapons, perks, and special attack pickups that are a great help when surrounded by alien hordes.

As you play through the quest mode you progress to different worlds, each looking the same, except for a different color background, you unlock new perks and weapons. These systems keep the missions from feeling too repetitive as you play through the same levels with different enemy skins over and over. Switching from a plasma rifle to a rocket launcher(or Gauss rifle) truly feels different and changes your playstyle. Which is a nice change up and really makes you think whether it’s worth it to run head first into a swarm of enemies to grab that upgrade.

After you venture through quest mode to unlock some new perks and weapons, then the fun begins now. SURVIVAL mode is the bread and butter of Crimsonland. Hordes and hordes of creepy creatures surrounding you while upgrading and upgrading, to see if you can beat the high score on the leaderboard. While playing in this mode your choices are crucial, make a wrong turn and all too easily you will be surrounded with no moves left to make. If you feel you don’t have enough perks or weapons to survive...well jump back to quest mode to unlock more upgrades.

While Crimsonland is a solid twin stick arcade experience, the progression system and level variation is left wanting. It will be one of the foremost choices of those who have an interest in the genre.",1610062770,1610062770,True,9,0,0.640240132808685303,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm a huge fan of Smash TV, Super Smash TV, etc., and have dumped more hours into those games in my formative gaming years than most other shooters of any kind except the Contra series.  Crimsonland is simple, tough, full of power-ups and different types of enemies that are out to give you nothing but a bad time.  

The level design is simple though it hardly matters and the whole point of Crimsonland is staying alive by dumping as much firepower in every direction that you can to get the job done.  There are other modes besides the campaign, so even after you've finished the basic game there's plenty left for a super soldier like yourself to do.  Your sole job of kill, slaughter, destroy and decimate (that's a few jobs, isn't it?) is made easy as pie in theory by responsive controls that allow you to turn in any direction needed while letting loose a torrent of rounds with the other buttons.  You'll grab gun after gun, some great and even a lousy one that pops up from time to time and screws you over, giving you limited range until you can find something better to blast with (damn you blowtorch!).  Additionally, you'll find a plethora of other power-ups that'll do everything from freeze enemies to blow up everything on the screen to give you super speed...all of the classics you'd expect in an addictive arcade shooter.  

As you punch a hole right through the center of enemy forces, the further you get will unlock power-ups that give you a slight edge against the unstoppable and relentless waves of enemy forces.  While the game lacks bosses, some of the later level enemies are dangerous and deadly enough that you may as well consider them the main troublemakers because they'll make your life a hell on Earth if you don't use some strategy to take them out first; struggling as you try to keep a throng of underlings off your back at the same time.

I mean...yeah, there you go.  It's as in-depth as that with no more words really required.  This decorated and striped gaming mercenary threw nearly 20 hours of his life into the game to complete as much of it as possible.  A few small challenges were left behind but I did most of the things I wanted to do in this game including completing several of the alternate modes and conquering the higher difficulties.  Crimsonland might be stripped to the bare bones in terms of gameplay bells and whistles but it doesn't need 'em.  You'll have to think on your toes and strategize your shooting to beat it and that's all I was hoping for when I picked it up.

Игра Crimsonland произвела на меня, ещё шестилетнего пацана, сильное впечатление. Тогда, в далёком бородатом 2006-ом, она была хорошим вариантом провести вечер для владельцев слабых ПК. Сейчас же игра нисколько не потеряла в драйвовости и стала ещё краше.

Сюжета как такового нет - просто мы в роли неизвестного Трупера месим орды инопланетной мрази, параллельно обрастая перками и навыками. Однако от того, как ты выстроишь свою ветку перков, зависит твоя жизнь.
Можно набрать бесполезной херни и потом помереть в самый ответственный момент, перезаряжая дробаш. А можно грамотно всё подобрать и быть подобным Думгаю, истребляя чудищ неземного происхождения одним взглядом.

Игру рекомендую, взял её по скидке. В комплекте две версии - старая и новая. Поигрульки в старую версию вышибут слезу из всех олдфагов, а новая версия заставит поёрзать на стуле от набегающей орды врагов. Также присутствуют новые пушки.

Спойлер: дабы открыть последний перк - наберите в рубрике Credits слово GEMBINE, и там возникнет головоломочка в стиле 2048. Наберите больше установленного рекорда - и перк ваш.

The graphics are little dull to be honest however the game play is fun and fast and has a bunch of crazy weapons.  Its a twin stick shooter with new weapons added every so often. Might be over priced since Tesla VS is much cheaper plus Tesla looks a lot better with color graphics galore. 
Crimson just has one map with a highway that is some times placed in a different area. Still a fun game even after this many years.

The inclusion of the original as well as the new updated version is an amazing value, and highly worth snagging.

I played the original with mouse and keyboard. I actually enjoy playing the new one with an xbox controller. It's less pinpoint accurate which adds some extra challenge.

There is no story. It's just killing. There is no campaign mode. It's just killing. There is a survival mode, but guess what... It's even more killing.

There are some unlockables, and while you're killing you level up and pick perks. There is definitely some RNG element to the challenges and what perks you get. A challenge scenario might need you to have a decent weapon, and you end up getting something awful for the enemies you're fighting. So there's definitely a roguelike element here. Challenge games are fast paced, either you die or you manage to get through, either way it's not taking a real long time. Survival mode has the potential to go longer, but still, it's gonna be shorter than a game of FTL by a fair bit.

Also, great soundtrack fits the bill perfectly.

1) Мощным шутером. Понравилось что с каждым уровнем начинают приходить более серьезные красавицы, есть и в том числе этакие ""мини-боссы"".
2) Локальный кооп. Так же при желании, можно изгалится с ремоткой для игры ""в онлайне"".
3) Рандом. Тут я скажу прямо - данная игра не для казуалов, так как дроп пушек и навыков здесь постепенно становится более богатым. Поэтому на определенном уровне вы смело будете материть бабушку таракана!
Ну а теперь о прелестном:
1) ОЧЕНЬ жесткое однообразие, кроме геймплея вы больше ничего не получите!
2) Рандом и достоинство проекта и в тоже время проклятие для игроков. Не думаю что стоит вдаваться в подробности ""почему?"".
3) Сказать честно: глаз может порадовать токо перекрашенный в алый тон пол, с какими-та останками костей и кусками плоти. Язык не выворачивается назвать ""зрелищной картину"".

最重要的是游戏性非常高。游戏采用了塔防玩法，玩家需要在每波攻击中抵御敌人的入侵。游戏中玩家可以购买和升级各种武器、技能和防御设施，以应对不断涌入的敌人。这种升级系统让游戏具有很强的策略性，玩家需要根据敌人的类型和数量来合理搭配武器和技能。

此外还具有丰富的游戏模式。除了经典的 Wave 模式外，还有生存模式、挑战模式等。这些模式各有特点，让玩家在游戏中不断挑战自己的极限。

总之这是一款值得推荐的策略塔防游戏。它具有丰富的游戏内容、独特的画面风格和高游戏性，让我沉浸在其中，无法自拔。如果你喜欢策略塔防游戏，那么绝对值得一试！",1592064068,1711104034,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Wcielamy sie w żołnierza którego zadaniem jest przeżyć na niegościnnej planecie pełnej obcych, mutantów, pająków i innych groźnych potworów. Jak oryginał gra oferuje 2 tryby rozgrywki: questy będące tutejszym odpowiednikiem kampanii fabularnej, czyli po prostu przechodzimy kolejne coraz trudniejsze poziomy wyżynając każdego niemilca który pojawi się na ekranie oraz survival w którym staramy sie przeżyć jak najdłużej. Survival ma z kolei kilka podtrybów jak np. Rush w którym stajemy naprzeciw hordzie uzbrojeni jedynie w karabin maszynowy czy Nukefism w którym nie mamy broni i wrogów przyjdzie nam zabijać za pomocą pojawiających sie losowo na mapie bonusów. Gameplay urozmaicają rozmaite perki jak i wspomniane bonusy, te drugie wypadają z zabitych wrogów a dostęp do tych pierwszych otrzymujemy po awansie na wyższy poziom. Gdy zabijemy wystarczająco dużo kosmicznego paskudztwa i zapełni nam się pasek expa dostajemy nowy poziom i możliwość wybrania jednego spośród czterech perków rozwijającego naszą postać. Od standardowego szybszego przeładowywania czy zwiększonej celności po kaszlenie kulami ognia czy roznoszenie zarazy wśród napierających na nas robali poprzez dotyk. 
Dodatkowo ten remaster posiada więcej broni, dwa dodatkowe rozdziały w kampanii, poprawioną grafikę i interfejs oraz dodatkowe podtryby w survivalu. Jakby tego było mało możemy też zagrać w oryginalnego Crimsonlanda z 2003 wybierając po prostu taką opcję w menu startowym.
Warto też wspomnieć o ogólnej przyjemności z rozgrywki, wielkie hordy potworów, hektolitry krwi i metalowa muza przygrywająca w tle, no po prostu zajebioza. 
Wadą Crimsonland jest z pewnością zbyt wysoka cena jak na tego typu grę, 20zł góra ale nie 50,99zł. Najlepiej czekać na obniżkę lub szukać po taniości w internetach.
Drugim mankamentem jest monotonia. Na dłuższą metę gra może się zrobić nudna bo ciągle robimy praktycznie to samo. Mi to nie przeszkadzało i nie zdążyłem się znudzić podczas tych 4 godzin ale warto o tym wspomnieć.
PODSUMOWUJĄC: Crimsonland nie jest może dla mnie takim klasykiem jak Alien Shooter czy Shadowgrounds ale i tak jest bardzo dobrą izometryczną strzelanką. Strzela się przyjemnie, bonusy i perki wzbogacają rozgrywkę a potworki rozpaćkują się malowniczo pod naporem ognia z naszej spluwy.

I use a mouse and ps3 navigation controller (with xpadder app and scp toolkit), which works very well here.

The game is basic, but very enjoyable. The constant flow of new gun options, pickups and upgrades (based on kills, i.e. xp based) keeps things progressing quickly. You are not going to get 2 games the same within an hour long play through. It allows for many different ways of progressing. There is no 'best way' to play! Each level and achievement can require different tactics. 

There are certainly some very powerful combinations that can fit almost any situation. BUT, I'm 30 hours in and still finding some combinations that I've overlooked previously, that are (almost) essential for certain maps. i.e. Poison projectiles for the splitting spider bots, if you are going for a 100% health clear! 

Do you find a very powerful, but slow firing gun early on? e.g. a rocket launcher. Maybe you look for movement speed and gun upgrades so you can circle strafe the hordes? Maybe this level's enemy setup (they spawn at  the outside) needs you to hunt out a new gun/tactic if that doesn't work. 

Maybe you find something fast firing, but weak and go for a strategy of sitting in the centre gunning down anything that comes close and working the pickups to destroy monsters quickly. You could utilise some regeneration, dodge and telekenesis (draw pickups to you) tactics. Or maybe you find the monsters spawn in the centre and you have to adapt in the middle of the fight.

Yes, this game includes a LOT of randomness, not enemies, but weapons, powerups, traits; which can require a number of restarts until you get some combinations you know how to work with. Or can work with the level. But I never found that overly frustrating.

With 70 levels you aren't likely to memorise them on the first few play throughs.

Honestly, if you're into this genre, the number of different options (if you are going for achievements) are sufficient to give you likely 25+ hours of gaming time.",1588013809,1588015075,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Por lo tanto me da un poco de nostalgia.

 PROS:
- Tiene muchos niveles para pasar y disfrutar, con una dificultad algo fácil para mi gusto, pero no le quita todo el mérito de lo que realmente es.
- Mucha variedad de modos de juegos secundarios, más allá de los típicos ""Score-Attack"",son algunos como escribir una palabra para disparar a un enemigo, otro estilo ""Gun game"" de ir cambiando armas con munición limitada y hasta uno de solo utilizar elementos secundarios como los disparos de plasma.
- Gran variedad de armas y de tipos de ellas. En el juego podemos encontrar las normales de balas, otras estilo ""Ion"" que vendrían a ser como de electricidad ponele. Después tenemos a las de plasma muy similares a las balas comunes y por último los rocket launcher.
- Una gran variedad de ""Perks"" (Habilidades al estilo Fallout), como por ejemplo, regeneración de vida, disparos que envenenan al enemigo, eludir, etc.

CONTRAS:
- Se que dije que no le quitaba el mérito, pero la dificultad podría llegar a afectar a los más exigentes. La razón principal de esto es porque por ejemplo, en la máxima dificultad, solamente los primeros niveles se sienten más pesados de ganarlos, pasando hasta más o menos la mitad pareciera como que se olvidaron de programar el resto hasta el final.
- Las armas tiene una gran variedad ciertamente, pero están desbalanceadas. Solamente con las armas ""Ion"" o las ""Rocket"" podemos terminar tranquilamente el juego sin preocupaciones. Las normales y plasma son bastante inútiles.
- Los""Perks"" así como en las armas, pocos nos serán útiles, y si nos llegará a salir una buena combinación (Que es casi seguro, porque en muchos casos, salen repetidos) podremos ganar el juego sin problemas x2.
- Quizás la verdadera dificultad del juego se encuentra en jugarlo solo, yo el las últimas horas que le dí, jugué con mi hermano y se hizo más fácil de lo que ya era.

 Se que tiene quizás muchos puntos negativos sobre los positivos, pero realmente no le podría dar una mala reseña, porque cumplió su objetivo de entretenerme y mantenerme hasta sacar todos los logros.

Crimsonland is an aptly named twin-stick, overhead shooter, as killing hundreds of enemies stains the floor red with their blood.  This is the primary focus of the game, as there's no story or rationale for what's going on.  You're simply thrown into a situation where you need to blast away waves of enemies, being given plenty of fun toys to make that exciting.  With no other complications to address, here's the breakdown.  


[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
	• There are 7 types of survival mode available, each with a unique twist.  Unless you're incredibly good though, many of these attempts will end quickly, because the game holds nothing back.  I don't find these modes very engaging due to how soon you're killed off.  I know I'd die eventually, but having taken down the game on the hardest difficulty, I'd expect to put up a better fight. 
	• The main game mode contains 7 worlds, each made up of 10 levels, with the last level always being a boss fight.  You can't skip around in the game, having to unlock every stage in order.  There are three difficulty modes available, but they work the same way, requiring you to beat the game on one to advance to the next.  You start on normal, progress to grim, and end on hardcore.
	• There's a reasonable amount of enemy variety to fight through including lizards, aliens, zombies, spiders, crabs(?), and beetles.  There's different types of them as well, such as ones that shoot projectiles.  
	• As you fight enemies, you earn experience and level-up.  For each level-up you're given four perks to select from, get a temporary shield, and all nearby enemies are shoved away.    
	• The rock/metal music is just the right accompaniment for a game like this.


[h1] Cons: [/h1] 
	• The harder difficulties in quest mode don't feel very different from normal mode.  Playing the first stage on grim mode is a punch to the gut, as it's surprisingly hard.  However, this is an anomaly, as following stages mellow out again.  As it turns out, enemies don't take any more hits and typically aren't replaced with stronger foes, there's simply more of them.  Looking at the number of kills for stage 1-4  for each difficulty, I killed 180, 216, and 252 enemies, while on stage 5-7 I killed 224, 283, and 307 enemies.  5-7 had enemy spawners, but I focused on them early each time.  Assuming these numbers are typical for every stage, each difficulty increased the number of enemies by about 40?  
	• The perks are really unbalanced.  For instance, fast reload, health regeneration, and poison bullets will almost always be worth getting.  Others rely heavily on the stage or weapon you have, such as stationary reload or the laser sight.  Some seem completely worthless, such as the death clock, which grants more points but kills you in 30 seconds.  Since these are randomly generated each level-up, you're at the mercy of dumb luck.  
	• The final boss is lame, especially in contrast to bosses from earlier worlds, which seemed to be building up to a daunting final challenge.  However, it's so anticlimactic that I wound up beating it with full health the first time through.  Plus, it's not even thematically interesting, like a boss-spawner or the presumed source of all the problems (like an alien mothership).
	• The difficulty isn't consistent.  Some later world stages are rather difficult, but stages before and after those difficulty spikes will be as easy as ever.  Additionally, different attempts on the same stage can vary widely, from a walk in the park to a desperate bid to survive.  
	• Frankly, I think the character is too slow.  Some enemies are faster than you, and due to how badly you're outnumbered, you sometimes can't kill them fast enough.  It's one reason the Spideroid boss is so broken, as the small spiders outrun and corner you.  
	• Sometimes enemies will walk in from the edge of the screen, but they often spawn randomly in the middle of the stage.  There's no warning they're coming, so they can spawn right on top of you and wipe you out.  


[h1] Tips: [/h1]
	• The weapons you're able to fight with, besides your starter gun, will show up on the map randomly, but it only shows the picture for it.  You'll have to memorize your preferred weapons and know their general effects to know when it's good to swap out or if it'll only worsen your situation.  
	• There seems to be no disadvantage to playing with other people, as there aren't more enemies present and they don't take more damage to kill (based on 2 player coop on quest mode).  


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
Having conquered quest mode, battled through a few rounds of the different survival modes available, and left with only a few achievements to complete, I've got just under 17 hours invested into this game.  I don't expect it'll take much longer to polish off the rest of the game, at which point, I don't see myself coming back for more.  So, at $14 I would say the game is a bit high, especially with gameplay that doesn't change much from start to finish.  Despite satisfying a basic urge for mayhem, the main downside to a mindless shooter like this is that once you run out of objectives, you lose anything to focus on and to drive you to play further.  When I was younger I could have played a game like this exhaustively, but my tastes have changed since then.  As long as you have a goal to works towards though the game is quite fun.  Therefore, I recommend it for those in search of a challenging twin-stick shooter that's not a bullet-hell.",1568405621,1607221397,True,23,1,0.7426300048828125,7,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Review[/h1]
This game is super fun. A twin-stick top-down shooter with a crazy amount of weapons, perks and modes to play. By doing the campaign I kept unlocking more and more and that felt really good, and due to the variety in weapons and perks I occasionally experimented with them to check which combinations I like the most. While some would argue that some weapons are downright useless, I have used at least all of them once and combined them with perks to at least get some use out of them. There are some slight and weird difficulty spikes throughout the game however. Gamers who have played this game are probably familiar with the first stage on the hardest difficulty, or the almost endlessly reproducing spider boss stage. And after that, it just becomes really easy again. The same goes for the extra modes, but this only applies to achievements as they are endless modes.

A full video review of the game can be viewed here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn_k2d3T9RQ

Gameplay:
Of what issues I have with Crimsonland, they are only minor and don’t affect the gameplay as a whole, resulting in an excellent top-down shooter experience that you are bound to come back to time and time again. Playing through the newer and updated version of Crimsonland has been an absolute joy. It has everything that made the original so much fun and expands on that making a bigger and better experience that will keep you hooked until you have mastered everything the game has to offer.

It is action-packed, fast-paced and has as much replayability as any roguelike game will ever have. And if you love playing games from time to time that is just mindless and over the top bloody mess action, then Crimsonland is going to greatly satisfy your chaos craving.

Atmosphere:
The atmosphere of Crimsonland is great. Throughout the whole experience, you have this fantastic rock soundtrack that fits in perfectly with the over the top and frantic action that the gameplay presents. But it isn’t just the soundtrack that makes the atmosphere of Crimsonland work, but the sound effects too.

From the sounds of the weapons firing to the splattering effects of enemies being hit and shredded to pieces to each of enemies death sound effect. They all add to the atmosphere which is one of chaos that complements the equally as chaotic nature of the game. It is such a strange atmosphere, almost alien but it is one that completely absorbs you into the game and its strange world of absolute destruction and monster slaying madness, all the while making you feel like a total badass in the process.

Conclusion:
Crimsonland is one of those games that you just tend to go back to time and time again. Whenever you are looking for that frantic and chaotic action-packed experience, Crimsonland is always the game that satisfies that craving. Its gameplay is at first glance simple, but there is a depth to it that only truly reveals itself the further you progress into the game. And the more you play the more you become absorbed into it.

The gameplay is solid, action-packed and an absolute joy to play, the weapons and perks varied, plentiful and full of experimentation. The atmosphere is chaotic and frantic fitting in with the gameplay and the survival modes are a varied and fun bash that will keep you occupied for hours. Crimsonland is an absolute joyride of action, gore and exploding enemies that was great in 2003 and has only gotten better with the re-release. And with that, I give Crimsonland a 9 out of 10.

Crimsonland is a top-down shooter from 10tons Ltd.  It has simple controls and simple gameplay, and yet it has amazing replayability.  You can do the quests and try to get perfect scores on each, or you can play one of the many survival modes.  Monsters drop various weapons and power-ups, and each kill gets you closer to a perk that can give you regeneration, increase your damage, reduce your reload speed, or have a special effect like flipping a coin to see if you get a fat chunk of experience or a fat chunk of dead.

My buddy gave me Crimsonland, and I have since gone on to purchase a large portion of 10tons catalog.  It is a fun game that you can play for a few minutes or a few hours, over and over again.

Это моя первая игра, купленная в стиме, ибо такое сокровище - заслуживает покупки :)

Казалось бы, простейшая игра, бегаешь по полигону, уворачиваясь от толп (тут реально толпы) разнообразных монстров и стреляя во всё что движется вокруг. Но затягивает просто жуть как!
Оружия тут действительно много и оно имеет свои особенности, радиус действия и скорострельность. Даже более того, разным монстрам разное оружие может наносить разный урон. Например пауков гранатомёт ложит с одного выстрела :) А вот пулями вы их запаритесь выносить... Ну и огнемёты против пауков и ящеров диво как хороши ;)

Вся суть игры - зачистить территорию и ВЫЖИТЬ. За победу без единой царапины - дают звезду. Читеры могут поднять перк регененрация и не добивая последнего монстра восстановить жизнь ;)

Кстати о перках: Да, тут есть множество перков, как в Фоллауте, которые могут очень облегчить вам жизнь. Вы можете стать ниндзей, который уворачивается от всех укусов, быстрым бегуном, или пироманьяком сжигающим всё и вся!
Но есть и вредные перки (чтоб жизнь малиной не казалась), типа ""часы смерти"", потикали - и ты умер. Или ты можешь стрелять без перезарядки, но твой опыт уменьшается (прощайте новые перки).

В общем игра отлично подходит для отдыха после дел и работы, либо для тех, кому адреналина в крови не хватает ;)
Особенно на карте с паукороидами ;))) И особенно на втором уровне сложности, в 100500 попытках пройти без единой царапины (я так и не смог).

[b] 5 euros [/b]

Cimsonland's strengths lie in it's gameplay, which is fast paced but also requires thought and strategy. Pummeling through waves of enemies is incredibly fun when combined with the perk choosing at each level that makes each survival game different. 

Unlocking a greater variety of weapons and perks through a campaign mode at first sounds like a roadblock but is actually a fun detour from the core gameplay to tighter more specific challenges that require using weapons/perks in specific situations tailored to them.

The biggest flaw is the visuals, which have aged poorly, being incredibly dull and monotone, specially in the early stages of a round, and even when filled with particles and energy blasts still of low quality. Also excessive blood make the visuals even more of a mess and sometimes can even get in the way of gameplay.

Crimsonland is one of those rare gems that allows your PC to be a local gaming machine, allowing multiple players to join in coop survival an campaign.

Я столкнулся сразу с этой игрой и был приятно удивлён тем, как эта простенькая на первый взгляд игрушка развлекает и расслабляет. Казалось бы, что тут такого: бегаешь по локации и отстреливаешь противников, да? На самом деле да. Вот только игра предлагает настолько большую вариативность в этом деле, что просто глаза разбегаются.  [/b]

Никакого сюжета, никаких заумных записочек. Эта игра полностью сконцентрирована на игровом процессе и ни капли этого не стесняется. Она игнорирует любой нарратив и даёт такую вариативность в геймплее, что просто не хочется отрываться. 

Перед нами top dawn шутер, в котором мы спавнимся на арене с пистолетом в руках, убиваем моба, получаем с него какое-то оружие и готовимся убивать сотни таких же противников в надежде на то, что нас не сожрут. Вот и вся схема Crimsonland. Вот только вся соль в том, что в игре имеется около 40 видов оружия и больше 60 различных перков, которые меняют игровой процесс в корне. Каких-то врагов лучше бить точечно, каких-то лучше бить из дробовика при помощи «веерного» урона. Кого-то лучше сжигать из огнемёта и так далее. Не подумайте, враги одинаково крошатся от любого вооружения, просто, к примеру, толпы пауков удобнее сжигать, а кучи зомби лучше простреливать из «гаусса», который пробивает на сквозь все цели в ряду. Дополняется всё это перками. Для того, чтобы открывать эти самые перки – нужно проходить кампанию. В течение прохождения мы получаем перки, которые сохраняются в библиотеке и будут выпадать во время игры. Получаете уровень за убийство мобов и вам выпадает какой-то перк для использования. На выбор даётся четыре, а выбрать можно только один. Перки могут быть трёх видов: полезные (регенерация, усиление урона и т.д.), бесполезные (из врагов обильно хлещет кровь и т.д.) и вредящие (вы умрёте через 30 секунд, но получите кучу опыта). Геймплей очень часто зависит от того, какие перки вам выпадут. К примеру, очень хорошо, если поначалу вам выпадет регенерация, или же увеличенная скорость. Тогда и играть будет проще. А если же с перками не везёт, то тоже можно играть, но будет намного сложнее. Но всё же можно. В любом случае, вы всегда сможете перезапустить игру. 

Ещё одним полезным изменением игрового процесса являются бонусы. Из убитых врагов иногда выпадают бонусы, которые способны существенно облегчить вам жизнь. Аптечки, круговой урон, огненные боеприпасы, заморозка врагов, бомба и так далее. К этим вещам нужно стремится иногда даже ценой здоровья, так как они способны уничтожить очень большое количество противников махом. К тому же, есть перк, который спавнит бонусы даже без убийства врагов. Просто на ровном месте. 

Играть же предстоит во множестве режимов. Есть кампания, которую нужно пройти для открытия всех перков и оружия. Есть режим «Выживание», где нужно до бесконечности отбиваться от врагов. Есть такое же выживание, только без оружия, на одних бонусах. И ещё множество режимов. Зачем этим заниматься? Просто так, для получения удовольствия от игрового процесса. Ну а если вам этого мало, то можете померится чувством собственной важности на всемирной доске рекордов. Вот только там на первых местах такие задроты сидят, что у вас вряд ли получится их выбить оттуда. Такие дела. 

Визуально игра выглядит хорошо как для представителя своего жанра. Неплохие фоны для сражений, хорошо нарисованные монстры и огромное количество кровищи, которое постоянно заливает пол. И при всём при этом игра прекрасно оптимизирована. Настолько, что играть в неё можно практически на любом железе. И даже когда на экране одновременно находится несколько сотен монстров – ни один кадр не пропадёт с вашего счётчика FPS. Да и звучит игра не плохо. Монстры стонут и воют, а ваше оружие постоянно звучит в зависимости от выбранного ствола. Жёстко, резко, монотонно. Да и музыка на фоне играет весьма неплохая. Задорная, не напряжная.

Если вы хотите как-то убить время и у вас слабый компьютер, то данный проект для вас. Он вызовет у вас бурю эмоций и ладошки временами будут прямо трястись от того удовольствия, которое вы получите. Доза адреналина вам гарантирована и вы почувствуете истинное облегчение, когда пройдёте сложный уровень. Это реально хороший проект за свои деньги.

С незапамятных времен 2000 годов в мир геймерского пространства пришло нечто чудо нето юдо и имя этой игры величалось CRIMSONLAD. Культовая игра во всех её осмысленных жанрах ибо это был некоторый фурор, для обладателей дисков такого формата. 
А формат был таков что главный вид передовал ощущения геймплея от 3его лица с обзором сверху, и дико суховатой графикой, хотя ранее на те года этот графон был более чем лучшим.
Не знаю кого этот обзор заинтересует но думаю для формальности стоило сказать предыстория о данной игре, именно с неё мы поняли какого это играть в соло, именно с неё мы поняли что значит ""один в поле воин"", и именно с этого момента начинается обзор о душевненькой и простолюдивой почти как #javaandflashgame, со своей харизмой двоякой сущность и просто приятной разработкой.
Моё знакомство с данной игрой произошло в 2007 году, тогда не особо парились насчёт графон и ютьюб не был таким востребованных платформер ом для летсплеев, а все обычные граждане обладатели персонального пк ходили в компьютерный магазин покупать не видеокарты с RAM-памятью а за пластиковыми кругами с записью на 100ю Мб, и были довольны что получили тот или иной продукт даже если он был шедевром или каллом.
Тогда мне было пофиг как движется моделька куда мне стоит ходить или нет, просто пос-рать просто играл в свое удовольствие слушал свое сердце заставлял свой разум молчать. И именно этим игра и прикалывала что она не давала сурьезных вложений в ПК или какой то логики, тебе давали момент жизни одинокого парня который смог бы проникнуться тем что он является последним саботером в шутерском режиме против толпы НИГАНОВ из ходячих мертвецов.. Ххехехе...
Можно подумать это не обзор а ТРУ-стори, но щас погодите.. Щас щас.. Оп.. Да,.. Все. А нет. Чуть пониже здесь.. Да  отлично. Застегнул, а то воды много утекло

So kann man das Spiel ganz gut beschreiben, muss aber nicht heißen das es schlecht ist.

Es ist ein Twin-Stick Shooter mit vielen starken und schwachen Waffen. Die Waffen braucht man um irgendwelche Alien Insekten/Tiere/Menschen zu killen, die alle unterschiedliche Wege haben um die effizienter zu killen. Und dann killt man so für 10 Stunden seine Insekten mit Waffen die es in jedem Futuristischen Shooter geben soll, und sammelt nebenbei paar Items auf den paar Maps ein welche die so schon geilen Waffen NOCH geiler machen.

Das Spiel hat nicht viele Level, dafür sind die so schwer das man die meisten erst nach 10 versuchen schaft.
Und dann startet man neu, und wieder, und wieder, bis man keine lust hat oder die Mom einen zum essen zwingt (dumme Hur3 geh arbeiten...).

Man schaltet die Waffen als auch Items durch siege frei und das ist immer sehr ""befriedigend"" (klingt sehr schwul ich weiß), EGAL bei welcher Waffe.

Ich kenne das Spiel nun schon seit über 5 Jahren, und das nur weil ich das Spiel damals als On-Rails Version auf dem Handy hatte (auf meinem ersten TOUCH Handy <3), es macht heute wie damals süchtig.
Für mich ist Crimsonland wie für andere Binding of Isaac.

[Обзор] Crimsonland. Крови богу Крови!
Чистых ""спинно-мозговых"" шутеров нынче не так много. Какие-то из них пытаются зацепить головокружительным сюжетом, какие-то чертовски хитрыми механиками, а какие-то под завязку наполнены секретами. А ведь иногда хочется просто пострелять врагов, не заботясь ни о чём лишнем. Для таких случаев есть Crimsonland, игра, где нет ничего лишнего.

Добро пожаловать в мир смерти.  500 убийств/минуту - не предел.
Добро пожаловать в мир смерти. 500 убийств/минуту - не предел.
Вообще, Crimsonland - это весьма старый top-down шутер. Первая версия датируется 2003 годом, но сейчас она не так интересна, как ремейк 2014 года. Он может предложить всё тоже самое, но куда качественнее. Кроме того, в Steam вы получаете обе версии.

Графика.

О ней многого не скажешь. Крови много. Врагов много. Они отличаются как видом, так и цветом. Через минуту-две игры поле превращается в красно-разноцветное безумие, где трудно себя-то увидеть. Спрайты оружия красивые, иконки бонусов - легко различимы. Никакого особого дизайна и отвлекающих от геймплея вещей.

Звук.

Тут тоже ничего лишнего. Всё оружие звучит по-разному и благодаря этом даже если случайно подобрать оружие, ты узнаешь какое. Противники имеют простейшую озвучку и помирают с приятным хрустом. Из озвучки персонажа - только болезненный стон при смерти.

Геймплей.

Самая сочная часть. Здесь есть всё, что нужно чистокровному мясному шутеру и нет ничего лишнего. Огромный и разнообразный арсенал. Множество противников со своими особенностями. Множество режимов игры.

Есть, конечно, некоторые оговорки. Во-первых, почти всё оружие и перки приходится разблокировать в кампании, по мнере прохождения. Сама же кампания - миссии по убийству n-ого количества врагов, поделённая на 7 глав, а так же 3 сложности. Но не бойтесь, для разблокировки почти всего контента достаточно пройти её лишь раз.

Сам же геймплей максимально прост. Убиваем врагов, подбираем бонусы и оружия, повышаем уровень (за это нам дают навыки) и стараемся как можно дольше не умереть. Ничего лишнего.",1559413723,1559413723,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game has received many updates throughout it's release on Steam and I think the game is currently at a good state of balance.
Including many other changes, the biggest is that previously you could not use perks in the quest game mode, which you now can by enabling it from the options menu, which was a part of the original 2003 game.
I don't understand what made the developers think it was a good idea to remove these things at launch, but I'm very glad they changed their mind and added them back in.

I have not played co-op in this game as I have no friends with interests in this game, but I've watched many videos of co-op gameplay before writing this and it looks super fun, so if you have friends looking for some games to play, this should definitely be on your list.

If you're planning on getting 100% achievements in this game, which I love to do with games I thoroughly enjoy, no matter the difficulty, good luck, you'll need it.
Completing the game is a big enough challenge, completing it while remaining at full health at the end of each level, even if just on normal difficulty, is, well... a long and fun grind. The sense of accomplishment once you manage to do it is just great.
[i]Tip: Disable blood in the settings. You can't have it on if you plan on beating this game on Grim difficulty or completing normal mode with full health at the end of each level, it makes the thousands of enemies too hard to spot fast enough with the blood obscuring the battlefield.[/i]

The game has 7 extra game modes apart from the main quest mode:
Survival: Survival mode with perks, power-ups and weapons.
Rush: Assault Rifle-only mode.
Weapon Picker: Randomly spawning weapons, each weapon only has 1 magazine.
Nukefism: No weapons or perks, survive by collecting power-ups in a strategic manner.
Blitz: Ultra-fast survival mode with perks, power-ups and weapons.
Waves: Wave-style gameplay.
Typ'o'Shooter: Use your typing skills to kill enemies.

This is where I have some negative things to say.

Apart from Typ'o'Shooter, Rush and Nukefism, the rest of these game modes depend purely on luck[i], and before I continue, in case it needs to be said, of course you need to be at a certain skill level, of course if you're bad at the game you can get the perfect combination of luck and still lose 30 seconds in.[/i]

Anyways, apart from the aforementioned game modes you lay in the arms of lucks mercy.
No matter how good you are there's only a few weapons in these game modes that will get you anywhere, which doesn't sound too bad, just restart until you find the weapon you need, sounds easy enough, right? Not really, because on top of the few weapons you also need an almost perfect combination of the first 4 or 5 perks.
If you do not get these, you need to restart and try again to see if you get lucky the next time, so if you want to get 100% achievements, which includes getting pretty high scores in these game modes, get ready to click the restart button hundreds of times, [b]literally[/b].

Apart from that they are still really fun, and once you actually do start to get a really high score you feel really good, again it's just super fun, but it takes a really long time before you get the needed combination of weapon and perks to get a high score.
I understand that is it difficult to balance such a game mode, that doesn't mean it should be ignored though.

The game also offers a 2048-style 'combine the gems' hidden game mode which gives you an achievement if you beat the pre-set high-score. This is an incredibly difficult puzzle game and honestly not fun at all, but hey... gotta get that achievement, right?
Upon purchase you also get the epic, original 2003 version of Crimsonland.

Это простой в своей сути аренный шутер, однако, с дикой реиграбельностью.
Вы бегаете по небольшой арене, убиваете чудищ, коих довольно много разновидностей и они имеют разные свойства.
Вам случайным образом выпадают паверапы и разномастные пушки, коих десятки.
Получая опыт за убийство монстров, вы прокачиваете уровень и можете выбрать один перк из предлагаемых четырёх. Перков тоже десятки и предлагаются они тоже случайным образом.
Вобщем, это полностью рандомный сессионный мясной убийца времени.
Однако, если не хочется так уж бесцельно месить противников, есть режим прохождения квестов. Где 7 глав по 10 уровней, и это всё ещё проходится в трёх уровнях сложности.

А по сути это стрелялка с видом сверху, ограниченная ареной. Вы один или в компании других игроков перемещаетесь по этой пустой арене и выносите орды инопланетных супостатов. Супостаты имеются разнообразных типов и вам предлагается вынести их все. Есть разные режимы игры - ""Компания"" и ""Выживание"". Есть перки, которые постоянные и выпадают с набором уровня. Есть различные бонусы и оружие, которые выпадают на арене. Арена вообще никак не меняется - из уровня в уровень это всё то же замкнутое пространство, которое может меняться только цветом. 

Рекомендую поклонникам бездумных стрелялок. И то только из-за наличия русского языка и других плюшек стима. Но этой игре не помешала бы компания с полноценными уровнями, а не аренами. Притом этот мужичок просто крайне медленно перемещается, а если возьмёт в руки пулемёт, то вообще превращается в улитку... На мой взгляд из мясных стрелялок лучше взять ""Alien Shooter"". 

К тому же раздражает нелепый разброс пуль. Понятно, что может руки устают у персонажа, но всё равно разброс пуль имеет случайный фактор и прицел нужно держать очень близко от персонажа, чтобы хоть как-то уменьшить разброс. С контроллера плюс только в том, что разброс фиксированный, но он всё равно есть.",1556037345,1556224018,True,2,0,0.530350029468536377,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I thought I would try for fun. It was a nice little shooter experience that I could pick up and play when I wanted to zone out.

Unfortunately, 10tons failed to create a satisfying experience. The whole concept of RNG on top of RNG combined with bullshit mechanics that were just not designed to enable no damage. Most of the levels are possible and even easy, but randomly you will hit a level that is really shitty. Shooting enemies, huge groups (enemies that spawn enemies when you kill them etc).

You play it over and over hoping the first weapon drop is good. You wait for the right perks to be offered. It is a miserable experience.

The way I see it, the problem is the levels weren't really designed. They just dropped a bunch of ingredients in a pot and hoped for the best.

Go to your kitchen, randomly select 5 ingredients and prepare them using a random cooking method. It's probably going to taste like shit, just like this game.

Note: The original experience is available, and it's actually good. It knew the limits of it's mechanics. If you don't care about doing no damage runs, you will probably have a lot more fun with this.

Gameplay progression: You start out with just a pistol and run around shooting creatures and zombies until either you die or eliminate all hostiles. That’s every single level, which you start on Normal mode, then progress to Hardcore, then Grim.
There is some uniqueness in a few of the levels where you start out with a specific weapon and can’t change it, but the level is usually created in a way that favors the weapon you are given. 

Weapons: Crimsonland has a whole lot of them. You’ll find out that some weapons are trash, and others are the next best thing to Christmas day. There are powerups that favor certain weapons to make them even better, which is nice if you can get the right ones. 

Cons: What makes this game really frustrating is the problem of randomness. All weapon spawns are random, all perks are random, and all powerups are random. The only way to progress through the survival modes and certain levels is to get the exact combination of perks and weapons that favors a certain style, otherwise you are going to die pretty quickly. 

Pricing: I wouldn’t pay full price for this game because of the lack of customization, but on sale it is an amazing steal.

Предисловие
Ещё до стима, когда стоит «местного кота» сидел лишь в игры с торрентов, попробовал я эту игру левой версии. Понравилась. Запомнилась своей сложностью. Особенно последний на то время 180-й уровень, который бил я с перерывами месяца 3-4! Почему так долго спросите? Потому что на той пиратской версии не было никаких бонусов, их просто нельзя было активировать. А без них игра превращается в сущий ад! Уж про то, чтобы пройти все уровни на звезду (без царапин), проще говоря быть на финише задания со стопроцентным здоровьем, про это и думать не приходилось – было просто нереально!
Приобрёл эту игру и в стиме. И на днях решил пройти, заценить тот 180-й уровень уже с бонусами. Как оно будет, сложно или нет… На удивление обнаружил, что игра пополнилась в уже ушедшем 2018 году новым эпизодом. Их стало 7, а уровней естественно стало на 30 больше, то есть 210. Ну после этого я уж точно не пожалел, что приобрёл эту игру так сказать легально.
И так про эти бонусы. Их 50 штук. Лезут как на дрожжах, один за другим. С ними не игра, а просто самое натуральное читерство)) Как же с ними легко! Тот уровень, который меня изматывал месяцами, я его прошёл за 10-15 минут! А мог и с первой попытки положить его на лопатки, но в самом конце побоища неожиданно получил по щам. В итоге довольно быстро прошёл сюжетные семь миров.  Следом без особого труда одолел задания с выживанием. А уж напоследок осталась мини игра с фигурами, побив рекорд в которой я бы открыл последний 50-й перк и тем самым прошёл бы игру. Но чёрт побери, та мини игра оказалась самой сложной частью всего прохождения… Бился безрезультатно 3 дня с теми фигурами. Не понимал, какой же тактике нужно придерживаться. И лишь узнав про неё в одном гайде, я с первой попытки перевалил за 50к, а уж за нужными 53к долго ходить не пришлось!
Crimsonland вроде пройдена 22 из 22.

PS. Но расставаться с «кримом» просто так не хочу. Должок за игрой имеется! Грех не пройти все уровни на звезду без царапин. Читерские бонусы мне в этом помогут!",1546959707,1546959862,True,3,1,0.559748470783233643,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Tons of weapons, perks, and a decent amount of modes. Playing through all 180 levels of the campaign (60 levels at 3 difficulties) truly feels like an accomplishment, especially with the difficulty of the final set. You'll be required to to get all weapons, anyway.

Zu Zeiten der Jahrtausendwende wurde dieser Topdown Shooter geboren. Horden um Horden von Gegnern verfolgen bloss ein Ziel, dich auszuradieren. Und das wirklich gut gemacht. 
Man startet mittig auf einer Map, bewaffnet mit Pistole und nach und nach spawnen die Gegner, die bei ihrem Ableben teils Items wie Waffen, Rüstung oder Atomsprengköpfe, die den ganzen Bildschirm von Feinden befreien, droppen. Es handelt sich bei den Gegnern um Mutanten, Spinnen und solche Konsorten, manche sogar unsichtbar.
Es existiert ein XP System, man sammelt Erfahrung, durch die nach kurzer Zeit bei einem Level Up sogenannte Perks ausgewählt werden können, die man im Singleplayer freischaltet. Beispiele dafür sind zum Beispiel schnelleres Nachladen, oder Items praktisch magnetisch Richtung Spieler zu bewegen.
In diesem Topdown Arena Style reiht sich Crimsonland ganz ganz oben ein, meiner Meinung nach in dieser Kategorie sogar unerreicht. 
Das reihenweise (auch sehr blutige) Zerfetzen von Gegnern macht tierisch Spass, und auch im Multiplayer ist diese Schlachtplatte ein Hammer, wenn auch vielleicht nicht auf eine unfassbare Dauer.
Außerdem ist es ein super Game für Zwischendurch, gerade im Kampagnenmodus hat man zügig die ein oder andere Map erledigt.
Definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung, gerade im Sale. Erste Wahl, wenn man auf diese Spiele steht.

Una pena que los records en el modo survival sean una exageración y por lo que veo son records cheteados a lo que es imposible poder llegar a alcanzarlos.
Tiene un montón de modos de juegos por lo que no se vuelve tan monótono.
También cuenta con una gran variedad de enemigos, desde arañas, zombies, aliens y muchas otras criaturas de todos los tipos y colores.
No podría faltar nombrar la cantidad de armas que hay, y es que son impresionantes, habiendo las clásicas como las pistolas, metralletas, escopetas, bazookas, lanzallamas, hasta pistolas que lanzan ondas de sonido, bazookas de 6 disparos a la vez, metralletas con munición eléctrica, y algunas que ni sé como ♥♥♥♥♥♥s nombrarlas. A pesar de eso, no vas a contar con todas las armas en el momento, tienes que ir cogiendolas a medida que aparecen en el mapa matando a un enemigo y en orden aleatorio, por lo que muchas veces toca dudar si cambiar de arma o no.

Pros:
-La variedad de enemigos.
-La variedad de armas y mejoras temporales.
-Muchos modos de juego.
-La música, aunque no sea variada está muy buena.
-El detale gráfico. 
-Modo coop local.
-Cromos.

A flat-map arena shooter where you simply kill waves of various forms of boogins, it's deceptively strategic without getting too up its own ass like real strategy games do.  With a monstrous roster of fun powerups and almost as many crazy guns, it'd take years to have the same run of a level.

Дошли руки до обзора Crimsonland.
Вроде бы, на первый взгляд, простенькая игра без претензий на славу. И это так. 
Кажется, огромнейшее количество смертоубийственных пушек, куча различных перков и разнообразные полевые бонусы не дадут заскучать, но есть определённые «но». Оружие, скажем прямо, не совсем сбалансировано, и есть как откровенные аутсайдеры, так и нефиговые имбы. Но кто заставляет брать первое, что появится на поле? Перки – тоже половина «хлам», но в соответствующих режимах при повышении уровня есть выбор из нескольких! Вот только жаль, когда 4-5 левел-апа подряд предлагают выбрать именно из хлама. Другой вопрос, что прохождение (или непрохождение) уровня здесь занимает не больше 2-3 минут, и проще бывает переиграть карту, чем мучаться и ждать, пока тебе перестанут маниакально впихивать «фонарики» (Blowtorch) или Узи.
Разнообразие в игру также вносят открывающиеся по мере прохождения игры различные режимы. В них вы обязательно подохнете, но в этом вся соль и есть: продержаться как можно дольше, или набрать миллиарды очков, или там ещё что. 
С удовольствием провожу время в этой игре на PS-Vita в больничных очередях, при езде пассажиром, в «гостях у тёщи» на ночь глядя и пр. На взрослых компуктерах, пожалуй, откажусь. Но рекомендую, как недорогую и отличную замену тетриса (т.е. времяубивалку), которая не раз подожжёт пукан на 10-х уровнях, выкидывая фортели с рандомом при выпадении пушек/перков/бонусов!

Toisaalta miten voisi edes mennä pieleen, kun pelin promokuva on apinoitu täysin Doomista.

Eli pelihän noudattaa tuttua kaavaa: juostaan ympyrää pakoon hemmetinmoista vihulaumaa ja koitetaan kaupan päälle vielä ampua ne vihut. Rundi alkaa yleensä pistooli kädessä, mutta ase pick upien avulla sitten otetaan parempaa tussaria haltuun, jotta homma olisi hieman helpompaa. Aseiden lisäksi kartalle ilmestyy kaikenmaailman power upeja, joiden avulla voi hetkellisesti helpottaa oloaan. Näiden lisäksi Crimsonland tarjoaa vielä ""kehityssysteemin"", jossa jakson sisällä levelataan ja vielä sitäkin kautta saadaan passiivisia apuvoimia käyttöön. Näitä on niin moneen lähtöön, että menisi ikä ja terveys niitä luetellessa, joten todetaan nyt vain, että ovat hyödyllisiä.

Pelimoodeja on useita erilaisia aina quest-moodista survivaliin jne. Quest-moodi kannattanee pelata ensiksi läpi, koska sen avulla avataan uusia aseita, voimia sekä pelimoodeja. Kenttiä on ihan riittämiin, elikkäs noin 50 kappaletta. Siinä ajassa kyllä ehtii saada ihan tarpeekseen vihulaumojen teurastamisesta.

Miinuksia pelissä ei oikein ole, mitä nyt kaikki jaksot ovat graafiselta ilmeeltään samannäköisiä ja vielä kaiken lisäksi erittäin tylsännäköisiä. Hieman variaatiota ja elävöittämistä olisi ehkä kaivannut ympäristöön. Lisäksi peli voi olla ikävällä tavalla satunnainen asedropeissaan, eli jos jossain vaikeassa jaksossa lyödään ihan turha ase käteen, niin on aika sama tapattaa itsensä ja toivoa parempaa onnea ensi kerralla.

There is something absolutely satisfying about Crimsonland. It's the same kind of drive that makes classic games like Geometry Wars so much fun, albeit packaged in a totally different way.

You can pick up power ups, unlock new guns, earn perks, and change up the game in all kinds of ways.

I'm trying to figure out why I love this game so much, especially local co-op. I think it's the pure chaos of being swarmed by enemies, only to see a powerup on the other side of the level and completely changing up your strategy. It's unbalanced, as you can be completely screwed when starting a level if you don't get a good gun pickup, but the nice thing is that these levels are designed to be played quickly and restarted almost every time. Bonuses are given for not taking damage, something that is both impossible and absolutely possible in a span of two restarts.

I found this really tacky and intrusive, not to mention annoying (I own all the games these ads were trying to push). 

That being said, this game is still a rock solid horde-based top down shooter. I'm currently slaving on getting without a scratch for the normal campaign, which at times has difficulty spikes bigger than a walrus penis. This game revels in unfairness at times, so if that's a deterrent for you, I wouldn't reccommend this game. Shooting feels fluid and responsive, and the arena quickly becomes saturated in blood from your kills, resulting in a primal satisfaction.

The music for this game is cheesey and bad. I turned it off fairly quickly, and I listen to Avatar or some other nice melodeath band to get the ambience right. Your death sound is fairly close to what i'd imagine an old man sitting on a traffic cone would sound like. It's goofy, moving on-

+Спустя несколько лет таки добавили возможность поиграть в оригинальную версию

-Баланса в игре нету ни в уровнях(все кроме трех очень простые и проходятся даже на максимальной сложности с наскока) ни в оружии(все кроме 2-3 мусор который даже подбирать нету смысла)
-Вагон рандома. Сложных уровней всего 3 но зато сделаны они так что без идеально подходящего билда на максимальной сложности вы их не пройдете как ни старайся. А значит если не везет можно пол вечера сидеть и рестартить один и тот же уровень надеясь что с 200 раза тебе таки выпадет нужная комбинация оружия и 2-3 перков. Весело пи#дец
-30 пушек это полуправда, на самом деле их штук 10 а все остальное это бесполезный хлам который чуть полезнее стартового пистолета и абсолютно неюзабелен на сложности выше нормала. 
-Один из перков открывается миниигрой, чтоб вы сильнее заeбались в процессе выбивания ачивок
-Респ противников внутри персонажа

-- Arcade Action where, basically, you take on waves of enemies, from a top down perspective, as a single trooper.

-- Tons of weapons, and power-ups

-- Lots of maps in the Story Mode, lots of Survival Modes

-- The one semi-unique thing about the game, I think, is that you basically get a random or starting weapon, and you can't change it until you ""loot"" a different weapon in the field of battle.   Last weapon you loot is the only weapon in your arsenal, so skip weapons you don't want to use.

-- Over 50 different weapons

-- Over 50 different power-ups or modifiers to your trooper, picked up as you go, fresh for each scenario in the Story Campaign, random basically in most other Survivor Modes.

------

Good graphics, well optimized at least for an Nvidia 750 Ti.

It is more fun than Nation Red, in that it is easier and each map takes less long to play, but Nation Red is harder and also very good.

-----

I'd get this game, if you don't have an arcade soldier shooter, and would like one.   I found each map took a minute or 2 to complete if you succeeded, some needed a few tries.  

I got this game as part of a large bundle from Fanatical.com when it was the old Bundlestars.com (just a name change), which is a reputable site and sometimes has great bundles or deals.   So I probably paid under a dollar for this game.

Sending tons of ugly critters back to hell (or wherever dimension they came from) while collecting weapons and an occasional powerup that blows up everything in sight never gets old.

The other reason being the developers. The game came out in 2014 and I recently started having technical difficulties with it (as in ""crash to desktop upon every start"").

This game is really one of those deceptively fun little gems where it is all about killing mass amounts of enemies on screen. The graphics are simple, but good given the nature of it.

Pros:
Twin stick shooting goodness with bar none amazing control.
Lots of Action
Lots of Perks
The quest mode gives you something to strive for.
GREAT WEAPON SELECTION. So many weapons that play so differently.

Cons:
No terrain to speak of, maps are a bit flat
Graphics are dated, given the age of the game this is expected.
No real end game.

Recommendation: If you find it on sale get it, don't look back. If your a twin stick shooter fan though wait for a sale, even though it is amazing beyond compare there are a few other games out there that will scratch your itch at a better price when it isn't on sale.

В игре нет записок, отсутствует дизайн уровней, зато есть много видов врагов и большое количество оружия. В ней нет персонажей и раскрытия их характеров, нет антагониста и нет богатого лора, зато есть прокачка, уровни и перки.

Присутствует два режима игоы: Quest и Survival. В первом нам нужно пройти 70 уровней, существуют 3 вида сложности (я пробежал их все и мне ни разу не наскучило). Прохождение уровня заключается в уничтожении определённого набора противников, характерных именно для этого уровня. Сами карты представляют собой плоские участки земли без какого-либо рельефа. В течение прохождения этого режима нам открываются новые перки и типы оружия.

Второй же режим заключается в набивании очков путём умерщвления всякой нечисти. Существует несколько подрежимов, типа ""в оружиях всего одна обойма"", либо ""убивай, печатая слова"", но в их подробное описание вдаваться не буду, скажу лишь что они скучным и легко проходятся для ачивок (кроме натиска, о нём позже).

Поможет нам в этом деле оружие, сыпящееся из вражин. Оно представлено очень разнообразно: огнеметы, дробовики, снайперские винтовки, автоматы, энергетическое оружие, ракетницы. В целом, с каждым типом оружия довольно интересно играть, большинстао из них хороши в одних ситуациях и плохи в других, но есть и просто имбовые пушки. Так же есть различные power-up'ы (замедление времени, взрывы, увеличение скорости персонажа и т.д.) и перки. На перках остановлюсь подробнее: убивая монстров мы накапливаем опыт и в какой-то момент повышаем уровень, за что нам дают на выбор один перк из предлагаемых четырёх. Все перки так или иначе интересны и полезны, кроме совсем уж ситуативных.

Мне, как фанату жанра rogurlike, очень понравились его элементы, вплетенные в игру. Хоть в режиме Quest и за каждым уровнем закреплено точное количество и виды врагов, но выпадаемое оружие, перки и power-up'ы совершенно отличаются из-за чего значительно повышается реиграбельность.

Из минусов хочу отметить уже упомянутый режим ""Натиск"", его прохождение требуется для ачивок. Он очень скучный и лишен всего классного в игре - уровней, перков и разнообразного оружия. Нам просто дают автомат и ""иди кроши нечисть"". Ещё меня порядком достали эти сраные пауки, которые умирая делятся на два, а затем ещё на два и так далее. Очень уж долго они ковыряются.

В итоге хочу сказать, что это отличная драйвовая игра в жанре Top Down Shooter со своей особенной механикой, которой хватает на то, чтобы не заскучать во время прохождения на всех сложностях и выбивания всех ачивок, а так же останется на пару часов, чтоб побегать в выживании. Чего тут говорить, даже после полного прохождения и удаления игры, я её раза три скачивал, чтоб ещё немного поиграть, очень уж геймплей понравился.

По поводу отличий между оригиналом 2003 года (он идёт в комплекте) и этим римейком не очень много могу сказать, так как играл всего полчаса, но по первому взгляду значительно улучшили практически всё: графику, геймплей, интерфейс, музыку. 

Отдельным плюсом идёт то, что игру до сих пор поддерживают.

До речі обкладинка відсилає до гри Doom, створюючи певний набір очікувань.

По своїй суті – це Shoot 'em up з видом зверху на арені з елементами RPG. Розпочинається рівень в середині карти, ціль завжди та сама – знищити всіх ворогів. Кожне вбивство додає певну кількість одиниць досвіду, поступово підвищуючи рівень, а в нагороду дають обрати один перк зі списку (аналог навичок в інших проєктах). Арсенал налічує майже три десятки видів пристроїв для ліквідації. У короткий час, над трупом з’являються різні бонуси та зброя, яка може бути лише одна, бо інвентаря немає. Все це зберігається лише в межах поточної локації, на новій все потрібно починати спочатку, що потребує кожен раз нової тактики. Супротивники мають кольорову градацію, яка інформує не лише про їх небезпечність, а й об’єм здоров’я та винагороду. Проходження можливе також у багатокористувацькому режимі до чотирьох осіб.

Проєкт надає можливість урізноманітнити ігровий процес, шляхом 7 ігрових режимів:
– Quest. Набір з шестидесяти рівнів, котрі мають різні особливі умови, в які ставлять гравця (вимкнені перки, один вид зброї тощо), а також спеціально дібрані набори ворогів, включно з босами кожного розділу. Є 3 рівні складності та можливість розширення початкового набору навичок.
– Survival. Повна свобода дій, у межах гри з єдиною ціллю – протриматися якнайдовше.
– Rush. Маючи на озброєнні лише АК-47 без бонусів та перків, необхідно швидко відстрілювати та маневрувати навалу істот з обох боків екрану.
– Nukefism. Перки та зброя відсутні, єдина можливість знищувати ворогів – швидко підбирати бонуси.
– Weapon Picker. Відсутні перки та бонуси, знищувати можна лише набоями, які присутні у випадковій зброї, що з’являється на карті, перезарядка відсутня.
– Blitz. Ускладнена версія Survival.
– Gembine. Секретний додатковий режим, що представляє варіацію відомої гри під назвою 2048; сітка має розмір 4х4.

        当时很多同学玩的QQ堂，现在虽然还能上，但是已经没有人了。之前玩过的QQ幻想现在也已经没有了（自由幻想和QQ幻想并不同步数据，我里面还有几个仙桃呢T_T）。当时玩的红警2，现在虽然出了红警3，但是估计红警4也不会出了，而且联机模式也不能用了。暗黑破坏神当时还是2现在虽然出到了3，但是刷刷刷的模式已经没有当时的精彩了。星际争霸也是，虽然出到了2，但是现在怕是也快凉了（星际2刚一出我就买了，对于高一时期的我来说，90块钱已经不便宜了）。盟军敢死队我也买了，也算是补票了。生化危机当时玩的还是2，也是苏苏带我玩的，当时我特别怕僵尸，但是为了不被说怂，还是强撑着看他玩，尤其是追击者（当时是这么叫的）来的时候，我都不敢睁眼睛（笑）。现在也已经把生化系列买完了，之后如果HD重制版打折的话再买吧。暴力摩托，极品飞车都是在黄黄家玩的，现在还没补票呢，等过段时间打折再说吧。还有就是大富翁4，当时几个朋友可以玩一天，可以说是非常快乐了。我记得有一次除夕夜，我就是自己在家玩大富翁和电脑对战了一晚上，过年的时候我爸让我玩很长时间，平时都只能一周玩半个小时的，但是现在没怎么近视也是因为这个原因吧。

       好像就这些了吧，玩的游戏不多，但是很快乐。有时候和黄黄上4399玩一些双人小游戏都能在他爷爷家度过快乐的几小时，但是现在买了很多游戏，其实大多数游戏都没有开过，唯一能享受到的估计就是购物的快感了吧。越来越大，朋友们都各奔东西了，哪怕是在网上一起玩游戏的机会都少得可怜，大家都有自己的事情，都有自己的经历，喜欢的游戏也变得不同，暑假和好朋友一起玩甚至都不知道一起玩那个游戏好。再也没有了年少时候的那种单纯的快乐了。想当时，看着自己被大富翁里150点券的飞弹砸中的的难受，也是欢乐的另一种形式吧。现在就已经沦落到只有吃吃饭，看看电影，走进网吧都不知道玩什么的程度了。实在是不应该呀。

       跑题了，这个游戏是一个挺好玩的割草游戏，主要就是用枪打源源不断的怪物。最近才知道这个游戏在steam上居然有卖的，果断买下。第一次接触这款游戏居然是在小学4-5年纪的微机课上，当时有些同学会把U盘带去上机，U盘里面会拷贝一些小游戏。我还记得那天我去上机，坐在我的位置上，忽然发现电脑上居然插着U盘，安奈不知心中的求知欲打开了U盘。里面具体有什么东西已经记不得了但是当时玩到了一款令我印象特别深刻的游戏，就是血腥大地（当时并不会英语，但是文件夹叫这个名字）。当然之后U盘被那个遗落的同学要回去了，但是这款游戏令我印象深刻。买了游戏发现居然还可以运行2003版的游戏，但是由于分辨率很低的缘故，现在玩起来不是那么舒服。但是新版本的核心内容和之前的版本相比，并没有什么变化，也算是给儿时的游戏补票了。话说那个同学好像是叫武希尧，之后在初中的时候和我的另一个好朋友反目成仇，自从我们初中毕业后就在没有见过他。虽然当时他很调皮，但是希望现在的他生活的不错吧。

Старую версию игры я не застал, так уж вышло, поэтому мой обзор, полагаю, будет чуть более объективен, чем отзывы ребят, сравнивающих, как я понял, очень разные вещи. (старая версия в релизе тоже есть. Для страждущих, так сказать. Но речь всё-таки не о ней)

Безсюжетный кровавый боевик. По идее на этом можно ограничиться, описывая Crimsonland. 
Сваяно детище не плохо. На пару десятков часов оно может увлечь. Во всяком случае, если хочется открыть все ачивки, как я и поступил. 

Всё действо развивается на тупо пустых картах - никаких укрытий, никаких препядствий. Ничего. Игрок появляется в центре, затем на него начинает бежать орда монстров. Убиваем тварей, качаем перса перками (это придётся делать снова и снова, ведь в каждоой миссии мы начинаем всё заново), подбираем бонусы, заканчиваем, а потом всё заново.
Сложность игры довольно небольшая. В принципе, реакции горения нижней чакры не вызывает ничего, кроме одного откровенно УДОЛБИЩНОГО режима в выживаниях. Nukefism - так называется эта вакханалия рандома. Суть в том, что вся игра стоит на относительном рандоме, но там прям-таки квинтесенция. Хрюпало из концентрированного рандома, я бы сказал. 

Обзор положительный но, опять же, считаю что имеет смысл брать игру только по достаточно большой скидке.

Минусы попробую обозначить отдельно, чтобы было понятно, чем я не доволен.
- Отсутствие мультиплеера. Тут можно играть хоть вчетвером, но только на одном экране, и только при условии, что у вас есть геймпады со стиками. В наше время такие игры должны и даже ОБЯЗАНЫ иметь мультиплеер. (кстати в старой версии игры можно поиграть вдвом на одной клаве (!))
- Однообразие. По сути дела, всё, что вы сможете узнать об этой игре, вы узнаете, пройдя самую первую кампанию, на самой низкой сложности. Дальше всё то же самое, просто немного сложнее.
- Nukefism. Этот режим для меня является самым большим минусом игры. Это настолько тупо, что спустя десятки попыток, достигнув наконец желаемого результата, я не получил радости от победы. Скорее это было облегчение от понимания того, что больше никогда не придётся зайти в этот бред снова.

Как итог - ""нормально"". Не ""хорошо"" и уж тем-более не ""отлично"". Но и не ""отвратительно"".

Az out.

[h1]Плюсы и минусы: [/h1]

[b]+ Элементы RPG:[/b] есть прокачка персонажа. С каждым уровнем можно выбрать перк, который не только даёт преимущества, но и частично вредит игроку. Например, вы можете стать бессмертным. Круто, правда? Но всего на 30 секунд. После чего вы умрёте.
[b]+ Многообразие режимов:[/b] помимо обычного прохождения уровней, так же есть выживание, ""Rush"" режим и прочие. Стоит отметить, что в игре есть режим клавиатурного тренажера. На нас прут монстры с именами, и что бы прикончить их, нам нужно набирать имена.
[b]+ Разновидности оружия: [/b]базуки, дробовики, ионные пушки, огнемёты и т.д. всего около 50 видов. 
[b]+ Отмечу плюсом что разработчики всё ещё поддерживают игру[/b]. В начале 2018ого добавили седьмую главу в квестах, переделали некоторые перки, вернули некоторые режимы из старой версии.
[b]+ Кооператив:[/b] Хоть и корявенький, но по фану можно попробовать сыграть вдвоём. Возможно не зайдёт, ибо второй игрок очень ограничен в действиях и зависим от первого игрока управлением.

[b]- Нет нормального кооператива.[/b] Было бы не плохо, если бы добавили прохождение по сети.
[b]- Приступы ностальгии и грусть, по старым добрым временам.[/b]

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
[i]Если вы фанат Crimsonland, то ремейк игры десятилетней давности вас не разачарует. Всё самое хорошее и запомнившееся нам перекочевало сюда, попутно добавив нового контента. Если же вы впервые слышите об это игре, стоит ознакомиться с ней поближе. Вы будете приятно удивлены динамикой и хардкором. Наглядный пример того, как нужно делать игры жанра shoot'em'up. Был очень рад возвращению этого шедевра спустя сотню лет. Восторг и приступы ностальгии переполняли меня и я с трепетом ждал, что же нам подадут господа из ""10Tons"" в ремейке. 
И самое главное - я не был разочарован. 
Всё то же мясо, треш и куча оружия. Всё те же эмоции, что и десять лет назад. За эту игру не жалко любых денег. 
Спасибо ""10tons"".

А также его ремейк. По цене одной игры. 
Если оригинал, который добавили в прошлом году в игру нареканий не вызывает. То ремейк вызывает и даже не одно.
1) Квесты -  7 глав по 10 заданий на главу. На трёх сложностях. Практически не отличается от оригинала, кроме 7ой главы,добавленной  в 2017 году. Эти ракообразные выглядят коряво. В остально нареканий нет.
2) Перки  и опыт- и это самая главная претензия. Их стало МЕНЬШЕ(Убрали, например, очень важные перки как EVIL EYES, pyrokinetics, другие отбалансили в худшую стороу). Падают они вроде как рандомно, но гораздо РЕЖЕ.  Гораздо реже.. К примеру, в старом Crimsonland я в Survival режиме взял 1,2 кк очков за примерно 12 минут. Убив при этом 3к монстров.
 И получив при этом 55 УРОВНЕЙ. То есть я  собрал все перки воообще которые были в игре. В новом Crimsonland я взял те же 1,2 кк очков в том же режиме, за примерно то же время и то же число монстров, но получив при этом 18 УРОВНЕЙ. То есть в ТРИ РАЗА МЕНЬШЕ.  К слову, о перках LEAN EXP MACHINE теперь опыт только увеличивает, между тем раньше он убирал опыт за убийства вовсе.
3) Оружие - балансили,балансили и забалансили в край, с крайним обновлением, играть стало не очень уютно - большинством оружия. Особенно ION-shotgun,и всей плазменной серией.
4)Режимы - есть старые добрые: выживание, ускоренное выживание, typoshooter и RUSH - из этих 4 х, Rush был самым дурным(ибо тебе дают автомат с бесконечным боеприпасом, и огромную толпу врагов - нужно продержаться около минуты - для ачивки). Так вот добавили ещё один  такой же дурной режим NUKEFISM, - который чисто рандом на выпадение бонусов. Ещё такой же Weapon Picker, и тот и другой играется без перков, так что абсолютно не интересны. 
Ах да, в Rush  вместо автомата может выпасть другое оружие, и тогда получается другой коленкор, но эта ситация чрезвычайно редкая, и лично мне оно ни разу не выпало.
5) Достижения - большинство простых, но некоторые могут заставить вас попотеть. Одно из достижений заставило меня пересмотреть отношение к Blow torch - blow torch вместе с перком Pyromaniac жжёт. Одно из самых простых оружий для получения 500к Survival.

В целом же, отличная игра,  с прекрасным геймплеем и подходящей к нему музыкой.",1517317859,1517504707,True,4,0,0.523787558078765869,0,True,False,False,False,,,

При прохождении открываются новые перки и стволы. Некоторые из них довольно бесполезные (огнемёт, например), какие-то очень даже имбовые. Суть игры, в целом, в нахождение правильно билда – сочетании оружия и необходимых перков. Я уже не могу припомнить, какова игра была в своё время в момент выхода, но этот ремейк довольно-таки годный получился.

+ Бодрая музыка, под которую одно удовольствие выкашивать орды врагов.
+ Куча различного оружия и перков. И хоть, в целом, тактика, как правило, всегда одна и та же, всё равно игра довольно аддиктивная. Я периодически её запускаю. Кто-то играет в косянку, а я в Crimsonland (ಠ o ಠ)¤=[]:::::>
+ Есть довольно неплохие ачивки, для выполнение которых приходится изрядно попотеть. К примеру, ачивка на прохождение нормального режима игры без получения урона.
+ Простота и минимализм. В игре всего 1 карта, но в этом и её прелесть.
+ Ультранасилие. Сейчас этим уже, вероятно, никого не удивишь, но в своё время в школьные годы это было нечто.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1282086662
+ Разработчики читают обсуждения, фиксят баги и добавляют фичи (к примеру, добавили сохранения в облаке).

Сложно мне объективно эта игру оценить. Всё же, моё мнение, по большей части, основано на чувстве ностальгии. Но парни молодцы, годный ремейк сделали. 
Если вы много лет назад зависали в оригинальном Crimsonland, то однозначно советую игру. Тем, кто не знаком с 10tons Ltd, игра может и не зайти, но в любом случае рекомендую ознакомиться с классикой.

There's a few game I would recommend over this one, Nation Red and Versus Squad, namely, but I will be sure to check 10tons Ltd new game as well, Tesla vs Lovecraft.

It is. But as it were free I tried it before dinner, and it was so fun I played for one hour and a half (growing hungry up to the point of quiting the game). Somehow the recipe works more than usual and you just get your delicious daily dose of twin-sticking shooting.

Pros:
+ Very fun.
+ Fast and forward.
+ A good diversity of weapons
+ The system of perks works very well and adds some real fun
+ Co-op looks juicy!
+ The difficulty seems to be just the right amount of challenge
+ You can restart a level several times, but each time you know you can beat it
+ Manage to add some variety between levels despite the barebones gameplay mechanics 
+ It takes less than 100Mb on your hard drive (less than a picture of a coffee!)

Cons:
- Achievements are not very bright
- Sometimes some levels are a bit luck-based (your survival chances relie a bit too much on the weapon you receive)
- You could shoot as well towards moving pellets or vegetables, you wouldn't quite notice the difference
- It remains a mindless barebones arena twin-stick shooter, after all...
- The music is sometimes quite bad
- Invisible walls of the arena so you get stuck without being able to anticipate it
- And the things at which you shoot, they can get through the wall, so you can die just because they were hidden off-screen behind the invisible walls
- Indecently overpriced out of sales. 4 bucks/pounds/euros should be your maximum buying price.

Verdict: On 80% sales with a free trial, it's a honest yes. You'll get your fun. It works well, and as we say in French, 'la sauce prend'. At full price, I'd say your money is easily better spent otherwise for there are much better games for the same price tag, and it's nothing more than a bland graphics mindless shotter with loop music and shapeless foes. Be warned, and enjoy.

Хоть компьютер у меня появился несколько позже, но как-то об этой игре я не прознал. Время навёрстывать упущенное.

[i] Crimsonland[/i] - аркадное рубилово с видом сверху. И сразу же первый минус – никакого особого смысла и сюжета в игре нет. Игра предоставляет нам возможность выбрать 2 режима. Первый – Quests, большая тренировка в 60 миссий, именно с неё и стоит начинать. Здесь мы познаём мир игры, открываем пушки и перки, которые пригодятся нам в дальнейшем. Также присутствует 3 уровня сложности, изначально доступен только нормальный, и только после полного прохождения на этом уровне сложности нам дадут следующий. Все последующие уровни сложности представляют из себя мини выживание на определённое время с определённым типом врагов. Второй режим Survival – это, собственно говоря, самое главное в этой игре. Этот режим разбит ещё на 5 подрежимов, но они все плюс-минус похожи. Из себя режим представляет бесконечный отстрел мутантов. Замочили столько-то гадов, попадёте в таблицу рейтинга, именно за этим и гонятся многие.

Насчёт оружия, его много, оно разнообразное, что-нибудь по душе да найдёте. Проблема, что не всё оно эффективно. Есть так же проблема на уровнях режима Quests, мы начинаем прохождение с пистолета, чтобы получить другой ствол нужно кого-то убить. Монстры же спавнятся толпами, и иногда проблемно подойти за желанным, плюс ко всему иногда попадается какая-то ерунда вроде огнемёта, с которой потом в итоге быстро огребаешь. В Survival совершенно противоположная проблема, уже с перками, как карты лягут. И одной общей проблемой является спаун, иногда возле вас может возродиться компания, но, если стоять в центре этой беды не случится, понятное дело, что стоять в центре не будешь больше 30 секунд.

Вроде как [i] 10tons Ltd[/i] обновляли графику в 2014 году, но как-то не слишком чувствуется этот момент, благо остатки нечисти не исчезают на поле боя, думаю, лидеры турнирной таблицы образовали новый плодородный слой почвы. Музыка не навязчива и это главное. Звуки пушек радуют. Технических проблем с игрой не наблюдалось.

[i] Crimsonland[/i] ориентирована на старых игроков, завоёванных в начале и середине нулевых. Пусть и дошли мои руки до этой игры недавно, я не считаю это упущением ни тогда, ни сейчас. Я хотел бы поставить [i] Crimsonland[/i] оценку нейтрально, но Steam этого не предусматривает, положительных моментов в игре несколько больше, поэтому я поворачиваю палец вверх.",1515365720,1515365794,True,26,0,0.711410582065582275,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Crimsonland is a game developed and published by 10tons Ltd. and reminds me of a top down version of Doom and you can clearly see that this game is inspired by said games

The game offers over six different campaigns all varying in gameplay styles and mechanics with three different difficulties and some hardcore bosses. Crimsonland has over seven bonus game modes and over 55 perks and roughly 30 weapons

The game offers local party mode which I couldn't try because I have no friends and of course, Crimsonland offers a lot of achievements and a ton of Steam trading cards!

The online downside to this game is that there is no online mode and it seems that 10tons Ltd. will not be implementing online mode which is a shame because it would have been fantastic especially for people who have no friends...

Crimsonland is a bloody good game to try out and play in short bursts!

de juegos finlandeses y me he encontrado con esta joyita que
tanto tiempo queria añadir a mi humilde bibllioteca,estan
desarrollando otro juego del mismo estilo.

Crimsonland es un juego que pertenece al género top down
shooter,es decir,un juego de disparos con vista isometrica o
cenital.

Creo que es una de las mejores apuestas que hay publicadas
en Steam actualmente,se que existen muchos más,por ejemplo
destacqaría la saga Alien breed que fue lanzado tanto en PC
como en consolas domesticas.

La historia sobre este juego no esta explicada en ninguna parte
es pura jugabilidad,nos desplazaremos por varios menús que
son bastante intuitivos,una gozada vamos.

Encontramos dos modos de juego diferenciados por un lado,
la campaña que esta formada por unos nueve niveles mas o
menos que se desglosan en otros nueve,de manera que
de manera total existen 81 niveles.

Cada nivel de capitulo cuenta con un epigafre o sentencia,
una pequeña descripcion para que nos entendamos que
me parece muy clave y necesaria.

Ademas en cada uno contaremos con una barra en la
parte superiror de progreso para aclararnos en que
punto concreto estamos.

Durante cada nivel iremos desbloqueando nuevas
armas para utilizarlas en el siguiente,al subir un
nivel nuestro personaje nos daran a elegir entre
diferentes privelegios que nos ayudaran.

Por otro lado los power-ups o potenciadores
nos haran las cosas mas sencillas.

Existen tres niveles de dificultad y un modo
adicional llamado supervivencia o modo
horda.

Un juego muy recomendado que cuenta con
cooperativo local,por si tenemos a alguien
cerca y deseamos echar unas partiditas.

Eso es todo se despide b_H89.

Игр в стиле «убей их всех» много, но вот уже почти 15 лет  все они сравниваются со «Страной крови». И да, монстров убивать не жалко, так как они анонимны.

Это ремейк от 2014 года, что возможно не так уж и плохо, ибо количество обещаний/ожиданий по поводу разработки Crimsonland 2 может сравниться разве что с Half-Life 3 (через два месяца после написания обзора [i]внезапно[/i] вышел «духовный наследник» [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084019881/recommended/636100/]Tesla vs Lovecraft[/url] от тех же авторов). «Графон» тут абсолютно не важен, и этот фактор активно используется современными «[url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084019881/recommended/357070]клонами[/url]» ибо главное — это агрессивная реакция без задействования мозга, что даёт искомый отдых этому странному органу, который даже в покое требует 25% от всей потребляемой энергии...

[h1]Игровой процесс[/h1]
Левая рука на wsda отвечает за передвижение, правая на мышке — за стрельбу по монстрам. Делящиеся пополам пауки — это страшно и поэтому тысячи их тушек украсят ваш победный бег по заляпанной их кровью земле. Победить здесь — это всё равно, что выиграть в тетрис.

Квестовой режим — это возможность познакомиться с врагами и оружием «Багровой земли». Основной режим, который и является притягательным способом освободить свои мозги на десяток минут, — это режим выживания. Вы всё равно умрёте, но жить так хочется, даже мелкому компьютерному альтер эго, поэтому приходится немного думать. После знакомства имеет смысл почитать разного рода руководства по выживанию, дабы почерпнуть золотые крупицы информации, например, что оружие победы — это скорее всего плазменный дробовик, а остальные несколько десятков типов оружия не так эффективны. 

Так же имеет смысл глянуть, чтобы размять руки, на режим Typ'o'shooter, ибо тут мы убиваем монстров, называя их по имени. Во истину, чтобы убить что-то — познай это.

[h1]GNU/Linux[/h1]
Никаких проблем при запуске и прохождении Crimsonland на  ноутбуке со встроенной графической картой Intel® HD Graphics 4400 не было. Дистрибутив Ubuntu 16.04. При переключении из полноэкранного режима по ALT+TAB приводит к зависанию, поэтому лучше воспользоваться оконным режимом.

Crimsonland really was a pleasant surprise to me. This type of game normally will not hold my attention long, but this, after 20 hours and every achievement its still got my attention.
 
Although the question is, will you love Crimsonland? Let discuss some of the features the game offers.
 
 
[list]
[*][b][u]Graphics[/u]-[/b] So the Steam version of Crimsonland is the remade version of the 2003 game of the same name. As you would expect the graphics did improve, a pretty decent graphic jump it seems.
 

[*][b][u]Gameplay[/u]-[/b] The game is all about surviving the infinite hordes of aliens, zombies, lizards, and giant spiders. That is exactly what you do. Although it is not quite that simple there is six different types of gamemodes including quest mode. You can even team up with 3 of your friends in four player co-op, sadly it is only local co-op though. Here is a clip of some gameplay of the Survival gamemode. Take a look and see what you think. https://youtu.be/kGBCdXIgCnI 
 

[*][b][u]Combat[/u]-[/b] Like I mentioned above Crimsonland is all about surviving against infinite hordes of enemies. You would think that would get stale FAST, but it doesn't. You get armed to the eyeball with 30 different weapons and 55 crazy perks! You do have to unlock them of course but that is easy enough, plus that gives you a chance to play with all the new stuff.
 

[*][b][u]AI[/u]-[/b] In a Twin-Stick Shooter like this you would pretty much expect a follow or chase type of AI. Well that is what you get, but it's not quite that simple. You don't get to just kite everyone around like you can in some of these types of games. Some of the enemies will just follow you around  while some will figure out how to take a shortcut and catch up to you.

 
[*][b][u]Story[/u]-[/b] Like I mentioned in the gameplay section there is a quest mode, and that is the closest to a story you are going to get. To be honest it is NOT a story it is just 60 missions of increasing complexity. Although when you play it on any of the three difficulties they will be different enough to keep it fresh.


[*][b][u]Replayability[/u]-[/b] Crimsonland is one of the rare titles that will probably always stay installed and ready to play in my library. The five alternate game modes offer such a variety of experiences that it will always keep me coming back. Even the most basic survival mode is nearly endless fun trying to always improve your high score and try new weapons and perks.
 

[*][b][u]Value for Dollar[/u]-[/b] I think the pricing is pretty spot on here. The game is simple enough that anyone can get into it yet complex enough to keep long term players around. If you aren't necessarily into Twin-Stick Shooters or never played the 2003 version, you might wish to wait for a sale, but if you made it this far into this review I think it'll be worth it for you.


[*][b][u]What Would I do Different or add?[/u]-[/b] Anyone who has read some of my other reviews will know I love detailed statistics, I think Crimsonland could have really benefited from that. I would have really loved to have known how many total enemies I have killed, what my favorite weapon and perk is, Etc. Etc. The only other thing I would have changed is the local co-op, I would have liked for this to be online, but I understand why it is not.


[*][b][u]Author Notes[/u]-[/b]
This review is solely based on the 2014 version of Crimsonland not the 2003 version.

I definitely enjoy the new game modes, especially the typing game mode (something I feel more arcade style games like this should have in it). But if I were to mention something I've found annoying about it was the fact that during Survival mode, after around 200,000 points are reached, the monsters are so quick, and many of them are buffed so much that it renders gauss weapons ineffective as there's no more piercing happening. You have to rely on either ion weapons, or if you've completed the quest mode on the hardest difficulty, The Splitter.

That aside I hope that someday the person behind this game takes another fresh look at it and improves it even further, maybe get experimental with it a tad. Or even, perhaps, find a way to make it moddable so that the community can tinker around in it a bit and make their own fun.

Под столом стоит мой первый ПК, а на столе лежит пиратский диск с названием «Сборник Reflexive Arcade». Перечитывая оборотку, натыкаюсь на громкое название Crimsonland и решаю заинсталить. Меню встречает меня аркадной металл темой, пока что всё гладко и всё устраивает. Стартуем...

Вид сверху, маленький человечек с пистолетом, под моим управлением бегает по полю, со всех сторон на него начинают переть разного рода, непонятные ублюдки. Выстрел, монстрик разлетается на куски кровавым фаршем, с него падает автомат, подбираю, стреляю в следующего, он аналогично разлетается в мясо... на экране начинает происходить тотальное мессиво. Это мессиво затягивает меня на 1 час и я решаю слегка передохнуть.

На следующий день, рассказываю товарищу со школы, он просит дать диск. Через день встречаемся с ним и он приветствует меня фразой «ВОТ ЭТО МЯСО! ШЕДЕВР!». С этого дня, мы всё чаще сидели у меня дома и проходили режим «Выживание». Да, там можно было играть вдвоём на одном ПК. Друг управлял правой стороной клавиатуры, я левой и целился за нас двоих. 

Спустя время, познавая легкое понятие «хакерства», мы узнаем что в игре можно заменить музыку. На тот момент мы не умели пользоваться конвертерами, поэтому мы просто выдрали OGG саундтрек из не менее популярного на тот момент Painkiller-а. Теперь мы выживали по колено в мясе и крови под музыку группы Mech. Да, мы убегали с уроков, лишь бы поскорей прибежать ко мне домой и поставить новый рекорд... и это было круто! [/i]

 

Это игра легенда. 
Это не обычный и тупой инди проект, которых сейчас 80% в стиме. Это шедевр со времен когда умели делать игры и она была одной из первых... ОТЕЦ жанра top down shooter. Это игра из моего далекого прошлого, которая осталась в памяти навсегда. Моего товарища поглотила взрослая жизнь и быт, мы с ним не общаемся уже несколько лет... а наша любимая игра всё еще есть.

Суть. 
Есть прямоугольная карта, по которой бегает Десантник. Со всех сторон на него прут разного рода твари аля пауки, зомби, мутанты. Задача проста: выжить. Из монстров, при убийстве выпадают бонусы, которые помогут вам выжить как можно дольше. Аптечки, слоумо, огненные пули и тд. Убийство монстра дает вам опыт. По мере роста опыта (а соответственно и убойности) игрока монстры тоже не дремлят. Они увеличиваются как в количестве, так и качественно. Накопление опыта в определенном количестве позволяет повысить уровень который позволяет выбрать так называемый «Перк». Излучать радиацию, при перезарядке выстреливать в разные стороны фаерболлы, возможность курсором доставать бонусы выпадающие с врагов. Отдельного упоминания заслуживают одноразовые способности, которые действительно предлагают, например продать свою жизнь (то есть мгновенно умереть) за +18% опыта... Опыт является мерой крутости игрока, и в таблицу рекордов заносится именно он.

Огромный выбор средств уничтожения монстров: от привычных и банальных пистолета, УЗИ, автомата и дробовика, до совершенно фантастических, но все равно отменно сбалансированных Плазменных пушек, Гаусс пушек. Это если выражаться коротко...

Никакого сюжета. Никакой наворочанной графики. Никаких DLC с 1 пушкой и 1 картой за 9.99$. 
Это старая школа, сынок! ЭТО МАТЬ... ЕГО... КРИМСОНЛЕНД! Это Серьезный Сэм, Дум и Пейнкиллер в 2D.

Музыку же, играющую во время дикого замеса, обычно не особо слушаешь, но тут она мне даже чем-то напомнила думовские мотивы, а DOOM плохим быть не может.

I've played it off and on since it was first released thru Reflexive Arcade back in '03. Which is also the source of the ""reflex boosted"" powerup icon, if anyone didn't know =) I've bought this game a number of times on a number of platforms since then, and will happily buy it again if it comes out on some other thing I own! Where do I even start...

Graphics - 3/5 No, they aren't spectacular compared to many...or any...of the AAA titles that have come out in the last few years. It is a top down, twin stick shooter, what are you really expecting here? Everything can be clearly and easily identified, and doesn't hurt to look at. Nothing spectacular, but then...I doubt that's what anyone was going for. Good enough really is good enough!

Story - lol/wtf Once upon a time, there was a guy standing in the middle of a field for no reason. For no reason, aliens and spiders and beetles and zombies all started running at him. For equally no reason, all sorts of guns and powerups appear from the corpses of these things. Guy kills things until the reaper gets him. That's it, that's a summary of the story, narrative, and all the characters. What, were you expecting some Dickensian struggle? Some moral dilemma? Nope. Top down. Twin stick. Shooter. Kill things until you die. That's it, that's all there really needs to be for the genre.

Sound - 4/5 Both at home and at work, for varying reasons, I play without sound usually. However, I do really like the soundtrack for Crimsonland! Best described with *slow heavy metal music plays*. It fits the rest of the game experience, without being too repetitive or irritating. My wife dislikes all the gunfire...sorry, can't be helped lol! The death sound is great for laughs tho!

Controls - 5/5 It is, as stated, a top down twin stick shooter. The controls are intuitive and responsive, simple and complete, easy to change. I see no way this could have been better.

Balance - 3/5 Good difficulty curve, except for any level involving spideroids. Seriously, fuck those things.

Gameplay - 5/5 Over the years, me and my employees have sunk literally thousands of combined hours into this game, between survival, and some of the hidden minigames. There is the right combination of luck and skill and planning involved to make different playthrus feel actually different and not repetitive. Hell, the monster spawns are more or less ""procedural"" and random in survival, maybe they can cash in on the ""roguelike"" tag that has become so abused and misused lately ;)

Overall - 4/5 Balance in the campaign mode gets a bit rough in places, but overall, this is a very solid offering for the genre. Price is right. A great buy for any fan of the genre!",1503302052,1503302052,True,2,0,0.545056819915771484,0,True,False,False,False,,,

大量の敵を撃ち殺していく全方位シューター
お勧めしない理由として主は主に３つ

①爽快感を失わせている特殊Mob
この手のゲームと言えば大量の敵をバッタバッタと倒していく爽快感が醍醐味でありこのゲームもその例に漏れないのだが、強力な特殊Mobの存在が倒す敵を選ぶ必要を生み爽快感を失わせている
具体例としては倒すと一回り小さい同モンスター２体に分裂する蜘蛛は可能な限り１体だけに集中攻撃をして数を減らさなければ圧殺されるし、遠距離攻撃手段を持ったMobがあちこちに沸くステージはさしづめ面白くない弾幕シューティングである

②アホみたいな運ゲー
このゲームには３０種の武器と５５種のパークが存在する。各ステージでは最初に倒した敵がランダムな武器を確定ドロップし（一部のステージでは例外あり）、ある程度敵を倒すたびにランダムに３つ選出されるパークの中から１つを選択し取得できる
そして武器とパークは強さに大きな格差が存在しており、高難易度ステージではリセットを繰り返して武器厳選とパーク厳選を潜り抜けてようやくスタートラインとなる。特別難易度の高いステージでは有効な武器とパークはそれぞれ数種類程度なので、厳選の時点でかなりの時間を消費することになる

③強すぎるドロップアイテムとその連鎖攻撃による大味なゲームバランス
このゲームは敵を倒すとアイテムがドロップする場合があるのだが、これが強すぎる
敵全てを一定時間凍結させるもの、銃の弾を一定数だけ貫通し直線上の敵全てをほぼ即死させる弾に変更するもの、一定範囲の敵全てにほぼ即死させるものなど、多くがとても強い。そしてなによりアイテムで大量の敵を倒すことで更にアイテムがドロップする可能性が高い。
殆どのステージは、アイテムを拾える隙を見つける→アイテムを拾い大量の敵を薙ぎ払う→そいつらが落としたアイテムで残党を薙ぎ払うでクリアできてしまうため爽快感はあるにはあるが流石にゲームバランスが大味すぎる

ここまで長々と書いたが、結局のところ①と②の合わせ技で超高難易度の3-2-10のステージが何十回やってもクリア出来ないのでこのレビューを書いているのである

The game really shines on survivals though. I found myself playing over and over trying to beat highscore, play different weapons or get luckier in rng perks.

实话实说，普通模式从头打到尾，我没有考虑过技能组合，射爆就可以了。这和我英文不好没有关系，对，完全没有。3个小时所有时间都在按鼠标，但给我感觉也不是那么无聊，属于那种让人感到无聊前游戏就结束了的那种。要是生活中的叽叽喳喳男也能这样就好了，没什么好说的就给我闭嘴啊，同班同学B，同班同学C。
平衡性的话也是拿脚做的，本来还以为是一个基于现实的社保游戏，到了后期，变成了科幻社保游戏，RPG都可以做成冲锋枪了。有些枪直接拿了前期的过来单发变散弹再加个连发大弹夹，对，说的就是你，gauss minigun。导致到后面就产生一个疑问，前面那些枪有什么用？答案就是稀释你出牛逼枪，变身帅帅侠的概率。掉枪很多情况是随机的，再加上这个游戏的奇怪设定，第一个怪必掉枪，然后基本不掉枪，有些关就是看脸过了。但难度摆在那里，多SL几次就能社保了。
至于敌人，我个人感觉减少点数量，增加点类型会好一点。到了最后，都是满地图的虫子或者僵尸，我甚至怀疑开发者为怪物的行为只设置了两三套方案，打到最后有点心累啊，包夹再包夹，大家弱智一点不好吗？怪物数量继续往上升的话就变成kuso game了。
总体来说，如果我还在帅气的小学阶段的话会很喜欢这款游戏。然而，然而。

Crimsonland was my first ""top-down action shooter"" of this sort. Super Contra/Super C are the earliest examples of this sort of play, and Serious Sam came out a few years before, which could reasonably be considered a relative, as well. But having the top down mode, waves of differing baddies, a huge variety of powerups and alternate weapons, and requiring very quick thinking and decisionmaking in a highly satisfying package was ALL Crimsonland's doing.

There've been many successors since then. Alien Shooter by Sigma Team added a much more fully realized campaign, Shadowgrounds by Frozenbyte was the first finished game in this style presented in 3d. Even Valve got on the bandwagon with Alien Swarm, in a way. 

Crimsonland may not have been THE first to do everything it does, but it was definitely MY first. So certainly I have a bit of bias here, but I think it's well-earned bias, at the very least. The core of it is extremely simple and requires very little learning. Move, shoot monsters, grab powerups, don't die. The wide assortment of weapons, enemy types, and powerups means that you're constantly reevaluating everything you're doing as the situation changes, playing defensively at times, offensively at others, trying desperately to avoid picking up the dreaded blowtorch...

 - unbalanced difficulty in some Survival mode situations, where a huge wave of enemies attacks that is impossible to be destroyed
 - occasional spawning of the enemies on the top of the player, which results in instant death

ウェーブごとに湧くエイリアンや、エイリアンを出現させるジェネレーターを、ひたすら始末していくというシンプルなものだ。
最大4人のローカルco-opに対応していることもあり、プレイ感は往年の名作『ガントレット』に近いか。

クエストモードは1面が短く、ノーマルで全部回って2時間といったところ。
本番はあくまでサバイバルモードなのだろう。
クエストモードを進めることで武器やPERKがアンロックされていき、それらを駆使してサバイバルモードを遊ぶという構造になっている。

武器はライフル、ショットガン、火炎放射器、ミサイル、ロケットなど合わせて30種類。
それぞれに個性があり、敵に合わせて使い分けていくのが楽しい。

ストイックかつ単純なゲームがら、頭を真っ白にして遊べる良作。
定期的に実施される値引きのタイミングで、ぜひおさえておきたい。

ちなみにサバイバルモードの1つとして、敵の頭上に表示される文字列をキーボードから入力することで、エイリアンを射撃するという『ザ・タイピング・オブ・ザ・デッド』のようなゲームモードも用意されている。
タイピング練習ソフトとして遊べるのは、なんともお得だ。",1496771096,1496771096,True,1,0,0.513536334037780762,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Crimsonland is a very simple top down shooter (twin stick), almost the most simple basic arcade version of the genre.  It is a level based game where the enemies spawn around the map and you must simply survive by killing everything on the map.

The core gameplay is very simple: point, click, enemies die, and dodge enemies.  There isn't much else to this game, it has a progression system by unlocking guns that do various different things.  It feels good when you beat a hard level, but I don't know it just isn't very complex.

One of them is, I'll admit, I've been playing it off and on since..around over 10 years ago?  I don't remember when it came out, but a buddy of mine showed it to me and we played it constantly.  So there's some nostalgia and attachment there for me.

But I'm honestly surprised that, as old as it is at this point, it still has received updates in the past few years.  

Crimsonland is a top-down shooter, fast paced and at times brutal, but in a fun die-click-repeat-die again till you win kind of fashion.  It's one of those great time killer games, where maybe you want to play something cool, but don't have time to fire up something as cool as The Witcher 3 for example, and just need to get in a quick fix.

There are several modes to choose from, plenty of weapons and perks to unlock, and for what it's worth, there are leaderboards, but I don't pay much attention to those personally.  The music is decent and fits the game, though I usually opt to put on something from my personal collection if I'm gonna go a few rounds, which suits me just fine.  Some modes I don't really care about, but to each their own.  Survival is by far my favorite.

The game offers seven different game modes which splinted in two categories “Quest” and “Survival”. 
In the quest mode, you have 6 chapters with 10 levels each which are getting harder constantly. Also you can unlock two additional difficulties if you have beaten the levels on normal.
In the Survival mode you have 5 different game modes, which all play different. 
Like a normal Survival mode (see how far you can get), Weapon Picker which playes like Gungame (you need to pick up new weapons constantly since you only have 1 magazine each). And even a mode in which you “type” the enemies down.
            
The game has 30 different weapons and a ton of perks and power-ups, which allow you to customize your gameplay till a certain degree. (Whit each level up in a round you can choose between 3 to 6 random perks)

Игровой процесс не изменился за эти годы, хотя графику и подтянули — это просто шутер с видом сверху, без укрытий, без разнообразных арен, вы всегда появляетесь на пустыре один, убиваете первых монстров, берёте рандомную пушку и... начинаете веселье. Море кровавых пятен на земле гарантировано! Сюжета нет, диалоги... кому они нужны? Убивай!
Для более удобной и разнообразной игры вы накапливаете опыт за уровень, который тратите на Перки облегчающие дальнейшее прохождение уровня. Чтобы получить все Перки нужно пройти кампанию полностью. Разнообразию способствует большой арсенал вооружения, и никогда не угадаешь какой ствол тебе попадётся первым, от чего играть намного веселее. Видов монстров не слишком много, но я бы сказал, что это кол-во оптимально — они не дадут вам заскучать пока вы проходите основной режим. Хотите сложнее? На ваш вкус три уровня сложности.

The review turned out longer than I expected, so I will include a summary of my thoughts at the bottom.

Like a lot of people, I remember Crimsonland from back in the day. I first encountered it on a demo disk that came with a magazine I used to buy. With only the first chapter of the Quests mode being playable, I remember replaying it over and over again. Some years later, I discovered the Internet and what it had to offer, so I managed to obtain the full version of the game, finally being able to play through the entire thing. Rediscovering it again on Steam was quite a surprise, with a new look and a tempting price tag. However, having found out that perks are no longer present in the Quests mode, I decided against buying it. 

Forward a year later, and what do you know: Crimsonland is on sale, 80% off. Not only have the developers  re-added Perks into the Quests mode, but the game now comes with the classic version from 2003. It was a steal at the discounted price and I immediately bought it. 

A few weeks have passed since then and after playing through the game and going for some of the achievements, I'm happy to say that Crimsonland has not only retained everything that made it great (and a tiny bit frustrating at times), but has also managed to slightly improve upon it with a couple of new weapons, perks and game modes.


[b] The game has two main game modes, Quests and Survival, both with their own gameplay elements. [/b]

Quests mode is separated into 6 chapters, each one having 10 levels. There is no story that follows these, but they're all thematically different from one another. They also have replay value as you unlock difficulty levels and achievements. 
You start each level with a pistol, and pick up different weapons and powerups as the level goes on. You can't however switch between weapons you've picked up, but are instead stuck with the last one you did. Kills earn you XP which can be used to select perks that can help you through the current level, as they reset at the end of each one. Beating a level will unlock a new Survival game mode, weapon or perk. Everything you unlock will then be present in Survival mode, as well as future Quests levels.

Speaking of the Survival mode, it is devided into 6 other modes, each with its own set of rules. For example, Blitz is just like Survival, but sped up, with an increased number of monsters and powerups. Nukefism on the other hand has leveling and weapons disabled, allowing you to only use powerups if you want to survive. 

All  game modes provide a good challenge. The powerups and perks feel usefull and make a notable difference. Some weapons may seem underpowered, but each has its benefits in a specific situation. However, the randomess of it all, accompanied by some difficulty spikes may give the feeling that the game relies more on luck rather than on skill.

Even though all of the game modes are playable co-op with up to three other players, and each survival mode having its own leaderboard, there is no online play.


[b] The sound and graphics present the game well, but are lacking in some departments.[/b]

The game has a very clean look to it, so you'll be able to tell whats happening at any given time. Over a hundred monsters can be on the screen, with particles from your weapons, perks and powerups flying all over the place, the bits and blood of the monsters you killed clearly visible on the terrain for the remainder of the level. All this while the game manages to run smoothly all the way through.

Although the graphical update of the new version boasts plenty of advantages, I feel as the developers didn't go as far as they could in some places while, at the same time, toning down the visual noise in others. For example, the only purpose for the maps you battle on may be to provide a mere background for all the carnage, but they could have greatly benefited from a bit more detail, adding to the game's atmosphere. It's something I feel worked better in the classic version, as it had grittier visuals and a less vibrant color palette. 

On the contrary, all of the weapons still share the same model, which is something worth changing that, unfortunately, carries over from the classic version. I also consider the look of the menus in the classic version superior to those in this one, which look bland and generic, as if they were ripped straight out of a mobile game.  

The soundtrack isn't that memorable for the most part, but some of the songs, like the menu theme, are great at setting the tone and exciting enough to not get repetitive.  
As an added bonus, the soundtrack also comes separate from the game so you can listen to it at your leisure.


[b] In conclusion: [/b] 

Despite some slight missteps and wasted opportunities in remastering the visuals, Crimsonland retains its best qualities and adds onto them with new game modes, weapons and perks. It still looks and sounds good, while running and playing out with no issues. Some difficulty spikes and randomness in weapon drops and perk selection can make certain levels frustrating, but other than that the game is a blast to play and tempts you into getting all of the achievements. You can play co-op with up to 3 other people locally, as opposed to just 2 in the classic version.
There are leaderboards for the Survival portion, but the game lacks online multiplayer. Thankfully. 10tons has announced that they are currently working on three new top down shooters, so we can hope that Crimsonland 2 is one of them. 

The time for a sequel is high, just as the score and the recommendation.

... Which is ironic because I really wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. I'm pretty positive that I got this from a bundle of some sort (HumbleBundle, I'm looking at you), and so kind of tossed it in my never ending backlog pile. It was buried so deeply, in fact, that I can't even tell you how long ago I added it to my library. 

What I can tell you is not playing this game sooner was a total mistake. Although Crimsonland might look like your stereotypical top down shooter, it's far from it. 10tons LTD puts their own spin on Doom-inspired mechanics and themes, and really takes the top-down genre to a whole new level. Sure, Crimsonland might not be the most graphically impressive game, but trust me - this literally does not matter whatsoever. The mechanics of the game run as smoothly as a hooker covered in lube. Or blood. Or something ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

The basis of the game is simple - you start with a pistol (and yes, it totally packs a punch!), and in the early levels you encounter only handfuls of enemies. As you play, powerups and different guns are dropped (which, by the way, you unlock a wide variety of new ones as you play through levels). I'm not going to lie - the powerups in this game are absolutely amazing, and range from freezing enemies in ice to freezing time. A certain amount of tactical prowess has to be applied to each different level, as this isn't any simple top down bullet hell.

Last but not least, the game modes must be mentioned. There's a ""quest"" mode in which you unlock all the available powerups, guns, etc. Annnnnd then there's the ""survival"" modes, which offer a bunch of different and unique flavors of the game. Amongst these are a typing mode, an actual survival mode, a powerup-only mode, an AK-47 only mode, and a limited ammo mode, as well as a la mode. Wait, no, I lied about the last one. That's for pie and ice cream or something :D

Gory, gritty, and intense, Crimsonland draws you in with its fast pace, delicious mechanics, and lots of zombies. If you enjoy top down shooters and don't own Crimsonland, you should.

I have played the original back in 2003 (which is included) as well as the re-release.

There are several game modes, the main mode is called Quest Mode and it offers 3 difficulties. You are placed in the middle of the map while enemies are storming at you in waves and you have to defend yourself from a top down perspective. Weapons (shotguns, rocket launchers, plasma rifles and many more) and powerups (for example bullet time, fire bullets, shields) are randomly dropped by dead enemies. While you shoot your opponents you will gain experience points and level up. Those levels offer special perks you can pick and they range from faster reload times to poison bullets. Each stage in Quest Mode has a distinct layout and starting weapon and by completing them you unlock new perks and weapons. The more you progress the more difficult the stages become.

Of course there is a Survival Mode, where you have to survive as long as you can as waves of enemies come after you. It features all perks and weapons that have been unlocked in Quest Mode. Or you try the Typ’o’Shooter or Rush mode. The game also offers local multiplayer of two players on the original and up to 4 on the re-release.

Crimsonland's Quest Mode and multiple side modes offer enough content to have you entertained for hours. Each round feels different, depending on the perks you pick and the random weapon drops. I tend to play the game in short bursts, you can easily drop in and out. It controls fine with both mouse and keyboard or gamepad. Tech-wise Crimsonland only shows age in terms of graphic options, the overall look and mechanics have aged well.

+ Many perks to choose from whenever you gain levels in a map.
+ KB + Mouse works well.
+ 3 Difficulties to choose from + extra game modes after beating normal mode.
+ Bunch of anchievements to unlock.

Cons: 

- You will need good RNG to get through Chapter 2 Stage 10, c4s10, c5s6 and c6s10 without taking damage (for achievement + star rating) if playing alone.
- Would have liked to see better weapon balance. No point in using a movement speed slowing inaccurate minigun when you can use any shotgun to clear much more.
- Levels are pretty simple in design. Some levels with walls (or whatever) would be nice.
- You can't see where enemies spawn and they can spawn under you, making you take damage.
- Sometimes the enemy is just too overwhelming even if not going for star rating.
- All but the typing minigame feel unbalanced - enemies overwhelm you too easily most of the time.

Agilidad en los dedos y una falta de interés por la salud del botón izquierdo del ratón, son los únicos requisitos que nos va a pedir el juego para ir resistiendo oleada tras oleada, bicho tras bicho. 

Así de simple, así de sencillo. 

El presupuesto para el juego se lo tuvieron que gastar la primera semana en whisky y muchachas ligeritas de ropa porque lo que es en los escenarios o en la variedad de los bichejos desde luego que no . Escenarios vacíos y de cartón piedra que se combinan con oleadas que sospechosamente se parecen mucho a la anterior nos van a acompañar a lo largo del juego, así que apañados vamos. 

Claro que no nos olvidemos que esto va de lo que va. Aquí no hay trama, ni personajes, ni situaciones... solo disparar, esquivar y decorar el suelo con los sesos de los enemigos. 

Pero si bien es cierto que se echa de menos más variedad en lo escenarios y las misiones, al menos el juego lo compensa con los diferentes modos de juego, muy variados y divertidos. Un acierto que alarga la vida del juego más allá de las misiones principales.

Para acabar, decir que este es el típico juego que viene bien para esos ratillos muertos que no queremos complicarnos la vida con nada. Si lo juegas bien, porque entretiene y se deja jugar, pero si no lo juegas... pues bien también, tampoco es que te vayas a perder gran cosa.

It is an incredibly simple game in terms of gameplay. Simplicity is a double edged sword, it can be a great element or a terrible one, it all depends on the execution.

Crimsonland is  a twin-stick style top down shooter.  You spawn in a square map, enemies appear from all over and you must kill them all or die.  Simple as that.  There is more added in the form of unlockable weapons, “leveling”, power-ups/drops, and perks.  During each round you kill enemies, gain experience, level up, defeat all enemies, rinse and repeat.  Each time you level you can choose a perk.  Playing the “quest” missions steadily unlocks additional weapons and perks.  Both the weapons and perks are enjoyable and are a meaningful reward for the completion of a level.  There is enjoyment to be had from trying out each new weapon and perk.  Additionally during combat power ups will drop, these are things like temporary shields, health packs, temporary fire/damage boosts, speed boosts, etc. The perks do not carry over from level to level, which I kind of understand.  I think eventually if they did carry over you’d be far too OP.  The drawback is that it can be a bit jarring to go from a level where you’re powered up (and much faster than normal) to suddenly back to zero.  I died a few times on some levels readjusting.  It’s not a major problem by any means, and was the only real issue I have with the game.

Although Crimsonland is ostensibly a generic and basic game, the extra touches in the form of tons of weapons and perks elevate this game above it’s generic base. I highly recommend Crimsonland. It’s a great deal of fun. I would however recommend waiting for a sale. Not to disrespect the devs (in saying they’re hard work isn’t worthwhile) but $13.99USD is far too high a price. Pop Crimsonland on your wishlist and wait until it’s $5USD or less. Crimsonland is great, and worth a purchase, just not at it’s normal asking price. Good luck, may all your games never crash. :D

If you like twin-stick or arcade shooters, Crimsonland is one you'll want to check out. Lately, I've been on a shooter gaming kick, but FPS are not generally for me, and permadeath is also a feature that I tend to avoid. Crimsonland is a top-down shooter with responsive controls, full controller support, and the ability to begin or resume the game where you left off.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The game consists of 5 levels, each with numerous ""quests"" that serve more like levels than quests. The [b]graphics[/b] and [b]soundtrack[/b] have a more [i]retro[/i] feel to them, and while appropriately understated, these really weren't the aspects of the game that impressed me. It was the gameplay itself that kept me playing all the way to the end.

To start with, you have multiple difficulty levels, which make it a great game for casual gamers and also for hardcore gamers looking for a ""tough-as-nails"" challenge.  For a casual gamer like me, normal difficulty can be completed in 4 hours or less. During the game, a certain number of achievements are unlocked through gameplay, but it also includes [b]achievements[/b] that are unlocked on greater difficulties, such as those for unlocking all perks, accuracy, or not taking damage. So, if you're a maniac achievement hunter looking for a real challenge, this game may be intriguing for you.

There are a wide variety of weapon drops, power-ups, and perks that keep the game fun and make each playthrough unique. There are also many different monsters to kill, each with its own characteristics. In addition, there is a local co-op feature which makes it possible to game with friends.

[h1] [b]Overview[/b] [/h1]

Crimsonland is an action-packed top-down twin-stick shoot-em-up. You, a single human (or more if playing co-op, which is even more fun),  must face off against thousands of bloodthirsty enemies at once. With the aid of game-changing perks and screen-shaking weapons, you will conquer the levels, only to do it all again on the next difficulty up. And after that, there's an impressive variety of unique survival modes to hone your skills. Crimsonland is one of those games where a level may take 5 minutes, but a gaming sessions last hours.

[h1][b] Components[/b] [/h1]

[b]Visuals[/b] - Crimsonland 2014 (which has been updated so it's now a 2016 version) is an impressive overhaul of the freeware game Crimsonland. The graphics are scrumptiously HD and there's delicious new graphical effects. Killing the hordes of the enemies results in juicy crimson splatters, which permanently stain the environment. The permanent splatter and corpses allow for an incredible aftermath experience that most games can't even fathom. The glowing plasma is splendid and the ion weapons are stunning. The glows and explosions and colourful effects all add up to make a visually pleasing experience. Amidst all the effects, the actual graphics quality though is fairly mediocre to today's gaming standards. The background environments are vast but bare and bland, and the enemies are uninspired and indistinctive. The visuals of Crimsonland play a vital role for the action, providing a colourful experience, but still lacks in quality.

[b]Audio[/b] - The audio in Crimsonland is awesome. As soon as you start the game, you're greeted with the rock (I don't know genres, but I'm sure it's rock) music in the main-menu. The music is intense and gets the blood pumping, puting you in the mood for the massive hectic slaughtering of the impending onslaught. The sound effects provie solid feedback, from the gunshots to the projectile impacts. All guns sound unique, which makes them all stand out. However, the explosions lack proper oomf and the avatar's death sound is hilarious. Enemy deaths are appropriately satisfying and do a good job of letting you know you've killed your foe. Overral, the audio aspect of Crimsonland is pretty good.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Crimsonland is gameplay-centric. There are many different guns ranging from blowtorches and shotguns to plasma miniguns and missile swarmers. Bonuses drop during gameplay, and these temporarily buff you with speed or fire bullets among others. Beating levels in the campaign unlocks perks and weapons which can drop in any game mode. Contrary to the store page description, there is actually 6 survival modes (the Typoshooter gamemode added in version 1.1.0). Having 6 different forms of survival really improves this game's longevity. However, the classic survival mode is probably the one you will play the most. Crimsonland also includes global leaderboards so you can show off your skills (or your hacks) to the world. This game's massive variety of survival modes is really awesome, and more games should follow in the vein of Crimsonland for this aspect. Survival mode is arguably the prominant feature of Crimsonland, however I believe the campaign is the best bit. The manually crafted levels offer unique scenarios for you to battle through, but even the same level will be a unique experience for different plathroughs. This is due to randomized weapon and bonus drops, and the almighty perk system. Kill enough enemies and you get to pick from 3 perks. They can improve and massively alter the gameplay but they only last for that level. Perks range from standard fire rate increase and reloading time speed, to bearing a contagious disease that slowly kills off enemies. You can get multiple perks per level and there's a massive amount of perks that allow for unique game experiences. Some perks are even multi-tiered, so that means you can get a seperate perk that improves a previous perk. The amount of perks and perk combos means you will be always experiencing new and exciting gameplay styles. Overral, the gameplay of Crimsonland is hell of a lot of fun, and local co-op opens up opportunities for even more fun!

[b]Story[/b] - N/a

[b]Functionality[/b] - Crimsonland has a couple of graphical settings and minimal options. This game is highly optimized and runs very smoothly even with thousands of enemies on screen at once. I am glad to see this game still receive attention even after its initial release in 2014. Overral, Crimsonland is a perfectly functional game.

[h1][b] Pros[/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Perk system allows for unique and interesting combos and abilites
[*] A fully fleshed out campaign that can last 20+ hours (especially if you try to beat every level on the hardest difficulty without a scratch, which I succeeded in eventually)
[*] 6 unique survival game modes, like the typoshooter where you are required to type the specified words to kill enemies.
[*] Stunning visual effects
[*] Sound effects for every moment in the game, plus some nice rocking music.
[*] Hectic action
[/list]
[h1][b] Cons[/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Mediocre graphics
[*] Fairly repetitive
[*] Nothing truly innovative
[*] Flat, bland environments
[*] Most enemies are identical or similar in behaviour
[/list]
[h1] [b]Conclusion[/b] [/h1]

If you're looking for crazy top-down shooter that you can play with your friends, then I highly suggest Crimsonland. This game will give you plently of fun and offers many gamemodes for different playstyles.
I give Crimsonland a 6.5/10, great hectic fun, but offers nothing substantial or innovative.",1481980353,1481980853,True,6,0,0.467388153076171875,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Jestem zaskoczony, jak tak prosta gra, potrafi sprawić tyle radochy. Czytałem wcześniej pochlebne opinie, ale patrząc na screeny myślałem, że chyba ludzie zbyt optymistycznie podeszli do tej gry. Jednak się myliłem. Gra się świetnie.
Jest to w zasadzie prosta strzelanka. Nadciągają chmary przeciwników i wszystkich trezba rozwalić. Nadaje się idealnie, jeśli mamy akurat 10-15 min wolnego czasu i szukamy jakiejś niewymagającej myślenia rozgrywki. Ale uwaga. Jeśli będziemy chcieli przejść wszystkie poziomy na Normal z gwiazdką, czyli bez utraty choćby najmniejszej ilości życia, to może się okazać, że gra wciąga na długie godziny. Szczególnie ostatnie poziomy dają popalić. A to dopiero początek. Potem mamy trudność Hardcore, której nawet początkowe poziomy są wymagające i na koniec Nightmare dla nolifów ;)
Oprócz tego jest 6 poziomów gry Surwiwal, w których staramy się zdobyć jak najwięcej punktów, które to potem można sobie porównać z wynikami przyjaciół, lub globalnie.
Do dyspozycji mamy mnóstwo broni i perków, które tymczasowo potrafią dać dobrego busta.
Ta gra, jak niewiele jej podobnych, udowadnia że grafika się nie liczy, jeśli gameplay jest bardzo dobry. Do tego można ją wyhaczyć na G2A za 10 zł.",1481800740,1481800740,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Откровенно сложно понять почему многие здесь рекомендуют этот шутер. Но нужно  попробовать по порядку разобраться в сути игрового процесса данного переиздания довольно старой игры. Потому что на фоне очень положительных обзоров вдруг станется, что возникло лишь какое-то недопонимание. К тому же это ремастер оригинала, который в своё время оценить не удалось, т.к. время было занято более красочными и драйвовыми произведениями.
 Итак, погнали:
 
  - ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ. Сюжета здесь как такового нет - просто убиваем толпу монстров на практически одной и той же плоской арене, которая к тому же ещё и ограничена невидимыми заборами по периметру. Оружие здесь выпадает в большинстве режимах случайным образом, как и бонусы из врагов. Есть разнообразные режимы, но арены всё те же и отличие только в параметрах игрока. Есть режим просто квестов, где нужно подряд проходить уровни и открывать перки с оружием. Есть режим выживания, где просто тупо выживаешь против толпы монстров. Есть режим выживания с одной только пушкой. Есть режим выживания с ограниченным набором патронов у каждой пушки... И т.д. В общем, разнообразие слабое. Хотя всё было бы симпатичнее, если бы у персонажа и стало быть у игрока была мотивация всё это проходить. Ну проходишь нормальный режим и открывается хардкор, проходишь хардкор и открывается мрачный. Сетевой поддержки здесь не нашёл, и это ещё один гвоздь в гроб местного уныния. Игра затачивалась под консоли и игре на одном экране с несколькими контроллерами. Хотя и на контроллерах удовольствия немного, т.к. персонажи бегают довольно медленно и чуть быстрее, чем враги, но если замедлят без перка, то обычно сразу труп.

 - ГРАФИКА. Ну про графику тут вообще можно молчать. Всё как будто на флеше. Так что изысков нет. Взрывы, ошмётки... кстати, трупы здесь не исчезают, что в плюс небольшой. т.к. особой фишки в этом нет. Менюшки крупные, как для смартфона. 

 - МУЗЫКА. Ну она здесь хотя бы есть и вроде бы соответсвует общему ритму игры, но особо не запоминается.

 - РОЛЕВОЙ ЭЛЕМЕНТ. Это ложь, здесь такого нет на момент написания обзора. Просто открытие перков и оружия. Перки выпадают случайной группой при определённом количестве убийств. И прокачки как таковой нет, ни у оружия, ни у персонажа. Каждый уровень начинаешь с пистолета. 

 В общем, даже сложно порекомендовать. Для олдфагов в комплекте с игрой есть оригинал 2003-го года, но тоже поиграл и всё так же уныло... После того же алиен шутера, ну мяса явно не хватает и к тому же сложность порой дикая. Одни карты проходятся вроде легко, но другие уже дико сложно, особенно со стреляющимися насекомыми (Эх сделали бы хотя бы одну карту по мотивам ""звёздного десанта"" тогда уж...). В общем, если есть поклонники оригинала, то они может и возьмут, но другим лучше обойти, т.к. просто смысла не вижу в это играть. Пар здесь особо не выпустить - т.к. оружие тухлое какое-то и взрывы маленькие.  От однообразия можно уснуть и игра на непрерывное прохожждение не захватывает. Так и не понял, что здесь фанаты игры нашли...
P.S. И в порте на линукс нет оригинального кримсонлэнд.
P.P.S. И после прохождения данного шутера на всех только убедился в полной бесполезности данного творения. И никакого послевкусия... По-моему, мясные шутеры должны оставлять после себя чувство удовлетворения. А тут кроме нервяков и трясущихся пальцев ничего больше и нет. В общем, кто любит такое - играйте, остальные лучше проёдите мимо. Потому что судя по отзывом тут любителей такого убожества довольно много. Это как в РФ - все жалуются на плохую жизнь, но поддержка президента 86%. И тут тоже самое - игра пустышка, но люители бездумности её боготворят. Паршивая тенденция...

The simplistic graphics actually help, as they dont distract and one can plainly see what happens at all times. And it still is satisfying to see an arena filled with body parts and blood (crimson blood).

The sound makes the weapons very fun to use; and the excellent metal/rock music fits the game perfectly.

Moreover, the game has a plathora of modes to make the game highly replayble (alone and with friends).

I've played the original game for more than I am willing to admit, and this game has a nostalgic factor for me.

Yeeessss! Mam platynę! 😁😎😈
A jak się udało? W sumie prawie jak planowałem,  czyli w Coopie! A dlaczego prawie? Bo miałem wykorzystać Żonę do pomocy A wykorzystałem... Starsze moje dziecko 😉 Sterował drugim ludzikiem i razem się udało nabić tego cholernego Nuke Fish! A ostatni achievement wpadł jakoś sam 😁

Tak więc grę polecam! Da się przejść na każdym stopniu trudności! Z tym że przyznaje że to trochę loteria! Bo po prostu wszystko zależy od tego jaką broń nam wylosuje! ALE! Miałem też akcję że myślałem że nie mam szans i przegram bo miałem broń z dupy, a jednak dałem radę! I później dostałem spoko broń!

In generale è un gioco che crea dipendenza; semplice inizialmente, difficile quando si arriva più in alto, con un alto livello di sfida e il motivo non sta nella difficoltà in se, ma in altro e lo andrò a scrivere dopo.
Una grande varieta di armi e di abilità e varie modalità di gioco, non tanto differenti fra loro ma vi intratterranno comunque per abbastanza tempo.
Possibilità di giocare in Coop in locale; peccato, un piccolo online coop non avrebbe guastato.

La grafica non è miracolosa, ma non ci si aspetta un granchè da un top shooter poichè le qualità da valutare sono altre.
La colonna sonora è molto monotona; avrei aggiunto un pò di tracce.

Come già detto in precedenza, è un gioco che può creare dipendenza: Solo un altro livello e poi spengo (sehhh) e devo dire che sono rimasto sorpreso poichè non è un gioco di chissà quale caratura e qualità, tuttavia fa il suo dovere: intrattenere il giocatore.

Il vero lato negativo di questo gioco è che il drop delle armi durante i livello è realmente troppo casuale, spesso e volentieri ci ritroveremo con armi brutte che non centrano nulla con il livello in cui ci troviamo e oltretutto il gap fra alcune armi rispetto ad altre è realmente  ASSURDO.

Thank you then, 10tons, for proving that repetition doesn't need to result in monotonous, stale gameplay. Just monotonous, stale writing from me.

Crimsonland is a simple game. A topdown arcade shooter fending off hordes of enemies with all the old-school trimmings: weapon pickups, score modifiers, bonus powerups, and generally being pretty bloody difficult. I assumed that I'd pick it up for a few hours, get bored fairly swiftly and face a bit of a grind to reach the end of the game. Surprisingly, despite my general disdain for wave-based shooters and zombies, this didn't happen.

There are two chief game modes - Quest is the 'story' mode, with sixty missions varying in difficulty and enemy types, and the progression through the game felt fairly natural. It's worth saying that this mode DOES have perks; in all game modes, you unlock perks within each level as you gain experience via slaying and wanton destruction. In earlier versions of the game, they weren't present, but have since been patched in. The perks and weapons that you unlock are varied and random, which lends plenty of replayability to each mission. One run you might open up with a Gauss Shotgun and absolutely massacre the opposition, and the next you'll be sprinting away wielding your piddly Blowtorch. Add in different enemy types, three different difficulties and the added lure of completing each mission without being hit, and there's plenty of content there.

Survival Mode is the other chief enterprise, and other modes come under this banner too, as you unlock them. This is a true arcade experience - you're just out to live as long as you can, and take as many abominations as possible with you. It gets very difficult very quickly, and you'll need to be more than just a decent shot to survive. Strategically strafing around the compact map towards powerups is a must, otherwise you'll be cornered and devoured before you know it.

Ultimately, the visceral gameplay is what underpins everything, glues it together. The visuals and audio are bland, dull, functional; the story nonexistent,  But it's damn fun to use all the different weapons, to repeatedly (but not mindlessly) butcher wave after wave of meatbags. I found myself wanting to come back to play a few more rounds, just for the satisfying feedback I got from using the weapons - I feel like the sound effects must have played a decent role in this.

It isn't perfect, and it won't be for everyone, but Crimsonland is as fun as hell. Hardcore and Grim difficulties await you beyond the main quest, and you even get the original Crimsonland (dated, but still fun) to boot. Pick it up at 75% off or better, and you're golden.",1474921443,1474921443,True,3,0,0.563358783721923828,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- the perk popup window that show up everytime player level up is really breaking the immersive. it's better to use right click to open perk window like the old game so people can upgrade the perk anytime without feeling forced to upgrade everytime player level up

- maybe it's better to put the powerup timer not in the cursor but in static place like in upper left of screen like the old game. it looks pretty but it's hard to follow the number because the cursor moving around so quickly

- the killer wave you get from when you level up, I don't remember if it exist in the old game, I think it's unnecessary and it's kinda ruined the level design of some level that need some strategic shooting . Like that one level which you get gauss gun as starter and the enemies are queueing linearly around you, they got killed by the level up wave and I can easily complete the level.

В далёком 2003 году, на свет появилось два великих шедевра, жанра кровавый Топ Давн шутер. Первый это был Alien Shooter и его продолжение, который я застал в детстве, и в последнее время в него переодически гоняю. И собственно Crimsonland, о котором тогда, ну вот мы не слышали совершенно. И вот только недавно я о нём узнал, и прикоснулся к нему, ибо классикой тоже считаеться как никак. И что сказать...

А про такие шутеры многое и не надо говорить в принципе, ваша цель проста: раскрасить весь уровень в красный цвет, применяя различные методы для этого, хотя и с единым для врагов исходом. Игра представляет вам несколько режимов, но основые из которых это кампания и выживание. В первом случае вы проходите миссий, открывая при этом перки  и новое оружие. А вот втором режиме и скрывается вся главная изюминка игры: на вас до бесконечности будут переть толпы врагов, а ваша задача их уничтожать и продержаться как можно дольше, зарабатывая миллионы очков. И поверьте, в это лучше действительно поиграть самому чем читать отзывы, режим выживания затягивает только в путь, хочется убивать врагов и красить карту ещё и ещё, и это не надоедает. 

+ Бодрая динамика.
+ Тонны крови и различных врагов, тут тебе и инопланетяне, и пауки, и зомби, и ящеры, и жуки, всё что ты скорее всего ненавидишь.)
+ Куча разного оружия и умений персонажа.
+ Вид сверху всегда лучше.

Что даёт Steam версия? В комплекте идёт оригинальная версия образца 2003 года, лично я сначала начал именно с неё, и да, она очень хорошая тоже, по своему ламповая и наверно даже более простая чем ремейк. Ну и собственно в комплект идёт и ремастер версия, которая имеет свои отличия от оригинала, а именно:
+ Улучшенная, полностью перерисованая графика, отпугивает не так как оригинал.
+- Немножко другой баланс, вот здесь немножко спорный момент, ибо одни недостатки вылечили тем самым, но некоторые другие вещи наоборот покалечили.
+ Чуть расширенная кампания, больше уровней сложности, хотя и сама по себе она стала хардкорнее, а также больше режимов, чуть больше перков и пара новых образца оружия и монстров.

Однако у меня есть и пара своих придирок, но они не очень значительны:
- К сожалению, но как минимум 50% ситуаций и смертей, происходят именно по вине рандома, а не умения игрока. То оружие не то выпадает, то нет нужных перков, то нет и того и другого.
- В версий 2003 года слишком имбуют дробовики, другое оружие можете выбрасывать. В ремастере ситуация чуть по лучше, хотя дробовики всё равно очень сильны, впрочем я видел большие рекорды и с ракетными установками.
- У ремастера на мой взгляд очень странная и не отзывчивая сенса у мыши, и её никак нельзя регулировать, из-за этого мне убивать врагов в нём чуть сложнее чем в оригинале, хотя и привыкаешь в принципе.
- В ремастере не стали менять звуки, не скажу что они плохие были в оригинале, но всё же попахивает халтурой, но хотя бы музон добавили новый.)
- К сожалению все уровни здесь, представляют с собой одну ровную поверхность с какой нибудь однотипной текстурой, как то после Алиена очень бедновато. С другой стороны и врагов ничего не мешает убивать, но всё же.
- Немножко дороговато по стандартной цене мне кажется, но скидки всё исправляют.:)
+ Я слышал жалобы что мол ремастер убил игру, потому что из кампании вырезали перки, но я вошёл в игру и всё было на месте, да их можно отключить, но по факту то ничего не делось. Не знаю, может изначально их и вправду не было, и вернули только с патчами, но в любом случае всё уже хорошо, и в целом ремастер абсолютно не хуже оригинала, и во многом даже лучше, хотя и хардкорнее. Но хардкор это не всегда минус :)   

Ну чтож, я думаю вам и так понятно уже что вас тут ждёт, также много крови, врагов, стволов и просто веселья. И эта игра, как и Элиен в своё время, дала мне все нужные ощущения и эпика которого тут творится. Она полностью себя оправдала, учитывая что я её упустил в своё время, поэтому моя оценка всему этому сборнику 10 Джекхаммеров из 10!

P.s. Здесь также есть один маленький, но очень приятный подарок, странно что в магазине о нём ни слова. Откройте папку с игрой и вы найдёте там официальный саундтрек.)

[b]Review:[/b]
From a content perspective, this game is pretty bare-bones. There isn't a story, just chapters you progress through doing the same as you did before, which is killing stuff, discovering new perks and weapons. You can beat this game on normal within 2 hours and then get to the real fun and action which is hard difficulty and survival.

Out of all the wave shooters, I have to say that this one has aged really well, especially because of updates to make it look and run better. I spent hours playing this game a few years ago and starting it up again feels as satisfying as I remember.

There aren't any negatives for me to point out. Don't expect too much of this game, it's really just a simple, fun time-waster, but it does go to show that games don't have to have the most beautiful, exotic graphics, most compelling story or bestest-best game play to be a fun experience.",1469156148,1692008135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1]全成就后更新[/h1]

童年的无数个下午，用那不知道关机了之后还能不能再打开的破电脑，在这款略邪典的游戏上收获了无数的快乐。打开幻想游戏合集，一句英文都不懂，几个月之后才搞懂如何跳过教程进行主线游戏。也不知道有升级菜单，硬是无升级打通了主线，后面有机会了才学会用老人机上网查中文攻略和升级菜单翻译，打通了加强难度主线。

这款游戏虽然看着比较老派古早，但是一点也不简单，不是完全的割草。主线没有任何剧情介绍，但是玩家会在每一章遇到新的敌人，他们有着不同的外观、攻击能力、刷新方式，以及特殊的行为，需要自己去分析战略。以及很多隐藏的内容需要玩家自己探索。

这款游戏还支持Steam徽章，其中的闪亮徽章是旧版游戏标志性的死神（Grim Reaper）图标，低调奢华有情怀。
[/i]

这是我在其乐上的评测（原其乐论坛已倒闭）

[i]Crimsonland（血腥大地）是一款垂直射击小游戏，其内容简单粗暴，没有任何剧情，只有纯粹的杀戮。伴随着敌人的叫声和摇滚乐，把一波又一波的敌人打成碎片，让红色和残肢布满屏幕。[/i]

[b]游戏历史[/b]

因为这是个很有情怀的游戏，所以允许我在这说一下他的历史。Crimsonland（血腥大地）旧版本 是来自芬兰的开发商10tons于2003年制作的第一个游戏，发行于PC平台。在2012年或之前，10tons计划重置血腥大地，并于2013时登上steam青睐之光，2014年正式发行于各大游戏平台（全平台，可以运行于PC, PSV，PS4，PS3，Xbox，WP8，Win8，Android，iOS，Mac OS X，Linux上）。

[b]游戏特点[/b]

血腥大地是一个关卡式的垂直射击游戏，每一关的内容都不太相同，但目标都是把所有敌人都消灭掉。游戏内包含着几十种科幻式武器和perk升级，多种可捡拾的临时升级的power up，还有四大类敌人：外星人，蜘蛛，僵尸，蜥蜴。

游戏并不是完全割草，主线没有剧情介绍，但是每一关遇到的敌人会在外观、攻击能力、刷新方式都不同，特别是有些关卡的敌人还有特殊的行为，比如脆皮高攻能秒杀玩家的复仇敌人、会分裂的敌人、会跟随首领并且命运与共的敌人，以及在旧版中隐形的敌人。这些都要求玩家分析每一关的战略。游戏每一关还有无伤（Not a Scratch）挑战，要求你有更高的技术以及运气才能达成。

游戏的风格非常old school，无限子弹+有限弹匣，开场第一枪击中敌人都就会响起躁动的摇滚BGM，每一个敌人被杀死时都会伴随着它的叫声，并且根据枪支和子弹类型留下一片血迹。一款简单垂直射击游戏也许能在2003年时留下好口碑，但未必能让人在2014年时为其+1。这款游戏不管是2003版还是2014版，都有各种彩蛋和隐藏内容。2003版的在9月12日（血腥大地的生日），圣诞节时会在主菜单出现气球或雪花彩蛋，在制作人员表单击所有带“O“的文字可以开启一个小游戏，此外还有各类隐藏武器。2014年版彩蛋相对较少，可能是没什么人钻研的缘故，目前为止发现的一个彩蛋就是在制作人员表下输入gembine会出现一个小游戏，类似于”2048“，把通关后会解锁一个新perk。2014版的隐藏武器应该不多，获得方式也不是很特别。以及旧版和新版都包含一些隐藏武器，需要一些特定的仪式才能召唤出来。这些隐藏内容让这款游戏变得小而精。

[b]相较于前作[/b]

增加了几个模式，Blitz（闪电），Weapon Picker（武器捡拾者），Nukefism，以及后续某一年推出的狂潮模式。其中闪电模式是快进的生存模式。武器捡拾者模式玩家的枪只有一个弹匣，需要不停地捡枪。Nukefism模式玩家没有枪，只有不停地捡拾陆续出现的power up才能生存下来。狂潮的敌人刷新总是一群一群出现的，前期比较方便打。总体而言，我觉得闪电和狂潮是比较好玩的。

perk升级不再是储够经验值后点击才会弹出界面，储得多了可以连续几次升级。新版改成了每次储够经验值自动弹出界面，并且不能不升级，直到经验值到下一个等级才会再次弹出升级perk界面。

另外大部分武器的数值都重新修改过了，旧版T0级的很多武器都被大量削弱，其他本来是很弱的武器得到了增强，虽然对老玩家来说有点反常。但平衡性确实做得不错，还多了几把新枪。不像前作只有几把武器是好用的，新版大部分武器都能在生存模式支撑很长时间。

修改了一些机制，比如无法无限换弹，就相当于削掉了旧版中声波枪＋愤怒装填的bug玩法。个人来说不喜欢这样，因为这游戏的精髓在于小而精，有很多隐藏的东西，能找到这种怪异的开发者没想到的玩法也是游戏的乐趣之一。以及隐藏武器分裂枪被大量削减，这不太合理，因为隐藏的武器本来就应该更强，或是更有乐趣。

使用非手枪时的武器掉落率高了。（在血腥大地正常的模式中，使用手枪每次杀死一只怪就能掉下一把武器，在掉下的武器到时消失前，但手枪杀怪不会继续掉武器，即屏幕内不会同时有两个武器掉落。在选择了一把非手枪武器后，极少几率会掉新武器）新版中使用非手枪时的武器掉落率增高了，可以说是优点也可以说是缺点，优点是选了差武器时有机会换掉，缺点是选了好武器时容易被“隔空取物”技能捡到差武器。

perk和power up的改动现在来看改动挺大。比如旧版的随机武器真的就是随机武器，新版的则可以手动选择，增强了游戏性，不再充满了随机。power up中的火子弹逻辑大改，导致旧版中的武器选择逻辑和新版略有不同。

UI方面，2003版的UI的组成是黑色为底，银色金属和裸露电线为框，文字是发蓝光的怪异字体。子弹和游戏内各种选项的调整条是一个个格子，发偏蓝的白色光。2014版的UI就变成了简单的深蓝色边框黑底悬浮面板，加科幻字体，其他各类UI都变成了比较卡通科幻式的，敌人身上的颜色更加多彩了。能看出开发商没有刻意想保留原有的UI设计，但是确让这个游戏少了一些风格。个人来说更喜欢旧版那种比较邪典老派的风格

敌人的巢穴有修改。不同种类的敌人巢穴形式不同，前作都是用一个图标的。枪支图标改了，变得更加卡通。perk也增加了图标。游戏地图删掉了一张雪地图，个人来说不喜欢这样，因为把白色的雪地用怪物的血液染红也是我喜欢的玩法。

BGM没有多大变动，增加了两首游戏时的BGM:gt3_3cwonder和gt4_claddon01，都很不错。

[b]缺点[/b]

游戏在后期时不会有更多新的变化，关卡设计和难度增加也就是添加更多和血更厚的敌人而已，总体不会有太多改变。但某种程度来说，有些玩家就是喜欢这样的设计。以及不得不提的，游戏随机性很大，不管是每一局武器的掉落，还是无伤挑战中面对开局就远程攻击的怪物，使得玩这款游戏经常面临重新开始的问题。

[b]总结[/b]

作为一部古典风格的射击小游戏，血腥大地出生的时间有点晚，但是这并不妨碍它成为我包括很多人的童年回忆。若血腥大地曾经也给你带来了快乐，那现在何尝不+1一下，支持一下开发商，回忆一下往日的好时光呢？",1468665706,1710341644,True,2,0,0.531914889812469482,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Wraz z masą broni dostajemy również ponad 50 perków z których każdy jest opisany ze specyficznym dla tytułu humorem, i tak na przykład możemy kaszleć kulami ognia, wybuchnąć po śmierci, zamrażać wzrokiem czy nawet podpisać pakt z diabłem. Do tego dochodzi kampania składająca się z 50 misji (w odnowionej wersji jest ich 60), oraz masa innych trybów - od hardcorowego aż do typo-o-shooter w której musimy wpisywać słowa, które są nad głowami przeciwników.
  Jeżeli chodzi o nowszą wersję (tą ze screenów) to jest tym samym co można było zobaczyć w 2003 roku tylko że w innej oprawie graficznej, z kilkoma nowymi broniami i perkami, oraz 10 nowymi misjami w kampani. 
 Sam tytuł jest bardzo grywalny i z czystym sercem mogę go polecić każdemu arcadeowemu graczowi.",1467987389,1467987389,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
Crimsonland is a 2014 reboot of a very good arcade game released 11 years prior. The top-down shooting mechanics are complemented by pleasant graphics and a surprisingly large arsenal. So you will never complain that this title got boring fast. It actually provides enough fun and diversity, that even its “story mode” is enjoyable. The titular sanguinary gore is as always, a sight to behold. The only flaw I could find to this game, is the difficulty which scales wildly and can push towards rage quitting even a Buddhist monk.  Throw in a co-op mode plus a complex perk system and you have yourself one of the best top-down shooters in recent memory. 

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Interesting graphics and gameplay mechanics.
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Unbalanced difficulty.

Waves of enemies trying to overrun your defenses.

Obviously this game has changed a lot since the early versions.  New game mode, different enemies, more weapons, perks, etc. have only enhanced the experience for me.  There's a lot to do.  My biggest complaint would be that the four-player multi-player is local co-op only.  Given that this version is on the Steam platform, it would be amazing if you could hook up with players on your friends list to really go at it.

That doesn't make the single player any less exciting however.  There's a lot of things to unlock through the missions (and they appear to have added leveling to the missions, unlike when I was playing it on Steam earlier, which does make the missions a lot more fun as well), as well as several extra modes to choose from.

The campaign content is balanced so that it isn't entirely luck based, because the guns and power ups that eventually spawn are extremely good and you will be able to mow down 100s of mobs easily. The perks can also get super crazy the more you stack. This game is fun because no two runs will be exactly the same. Each level or survival run will reset your character's progression, so you will level up and choose new perks within each run.

You may cringe at the RNG aspect, but it won't seriously screw you over until survival. In survival modes, a power up or gun may spawn behind a sea of mobs, and because getting hit by mobs slows you down and their pathing is design to swarm and overwhelm you, you will not be able to make it.

I got this game years ago. Even now, I can't say this is worth shelling out 14 bucks for.

Crimsonland, now [u]actually Crimsonland[/u], with perks in Quest Mode! \o/

Once upon a time, before we had Nation Red, the jolliest ""run around topdown and kill stuff"" video game known to humanity was Crimsonland. Then came Steam, and it brought with it Nation Red in 2009, and it was jolly, but what truly would have been jollier... Crimsonland.

Fast-forward to the year 2014, and our cries were heard. The [i]Lord GabeN[/i] (or rather the dreadful Greenlight system) brought us Crimsonland on Steam. However, as you can read below, not everything was well in this newfound land of milk and honey... it wasn't the Crimsonland we wanted, nor was it the Crimsonland we deserved. It wasn't even the Crimsonland we needed. In this limbo we suffered, admittedly with enough other games to play in the meantime.

With a bang, March 2016 brought with it much-needed game design adjustments, as well as the free addition of 2003's Crimsonland. All the inhabitants of Earth rejoiced, and a time of serenity arrived, such as was not known to them before. And [i]10tons[/i] did this mighty act, that there might be no more evil upon Earth. Now go forth and play this game, dear reader, so that all the alien opponents in it get turned about like pottage in a cauldron. And die. Make sure they die.

First of all, let me say that indeed the quest mode is LESS JOLLY than it was in the original game. There's no perks there so it's way more of a boring grind than it needs to be. Also, the way the game handles 'reference resolutions' and whatnot is pretty odd.

However, there's still arousing Crimsonland gameplay to be found in this 'HD' upgrade.

Beside being a nice twin stick shooter with balancing issues, Crimsonland is first and foremost a serious statement about the opportunity of ripping audio samples out of pornographic material.

Seriously, the player's death screams (plural, as they made more than one!): they would make John Holms blush! After 20 times of hearing your character ""deeply enjoying"" his death, you become a master of ""Esc pressing and restarting"", just to avoid that part.

Putting the more erotic aspects of the game aside, it's a very enjoyable shooter with a lot of replayability, coop mode, and a number of modes. It doesn't properly ""shine"" in anything, but everything is from adequate (music, graphics) to very good (gameplay, weapons).

The only major complaint that takes the 5th star out of the title, is balancing: there is one single level that literally *ruins* the game (2.10, Spiderdroids) and is so difficult, that finishing it in normal mode is more difficult than all other levels on all difficulty settings combined (and let's not even speak about the possibility of getting the ""no scratch"" achievement...). 

Very recommended, especially for the price tag.

Что хотелось бы отметить - в отличие от многих разработчиков 10tons не забросили проект сразу после выпуска и самым внимательнейшим образом прислушались к коммьюнити - оперативно, а главное бесплатно добавили многое из того, что просили игроки, изменили механику работы перков, приблизив их к старой версии. И, что забавно, игроки просили сделать недорогое dlc с саундтреком и версией 2003-го года, но разработчики сделали лучше - просто с последним патчем закинули все это всем игрокам бесплатным патчем.
Еще хотелось бы отметить, что в игру добавили ачивки, над некоторыми из которых приходится попотеть :)

As part of a Humble Bundle pack I did not regret buying it, however I sadly cannot honestly recommend buying it on PC, for 3 reasons.

1. This isn't the game we loved back then. It has an awful new gigantic UI and ""click in the corner for a new player to join"", making it very clear they relased the android port on PC instead of simply re-relasing the old client with added compatibility. Sadly, much of the nostalgia factor is killed off because of it.

2. The game didn't age very well, on it's own and relatively to the rest of the market. We just passed or may still live in years where mass wave survival shooters are getting relased every week, and among them Crimsonland simply cannot stand, for it's extremely cheap looking and while undoubtedly fun but very unimaginative and boring powerups and weapons just doesn't offer anything that could make it stand out and say - buy me over this or that, because... ?

3. The price. It's unreasonably high for a game that is about 15 year old, and adds nothing to the original other than an uncomfortibly huge UI and steam achievements.

However, as I mentioned I picked up the game in Humble Bundle, and it also came with it's android version. I played that a LOT. I mean, a LOT. I remember spending days, added together easily weeks at work (yeah... well, we had nothing to do for hours a day quite often those times...) and having so much fun with it. The touchscreen controls and the higher difficulty levels together really create an extremely challanging gameplay and obviously the new UI is designed to work well there.

Pick up the android version, and just remember the old PC version as something you had fun with as a kid, and let it be remembered that way instead of ruining it with this new PC version. If you haven't played it, ever, still recommended for phones / tablets, but you are better off spending your money on a similar but better arena survival game on PC.",1457990921,1457991093,False,1,0,0.44321674108505249,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The game is clearly based on the classic with the same name from 2003 - with the most recent major update, the original game is even presented for free when you buy [b]Crimsonland[/b] on Steam. Just as the original one, the new version is a no-nonsense game in which you get several different gamemodes which offer access to just the one thing that really counts: slaying monsters, aliens and zombies. And there are a TON of those, so you need some decent gear, don't you? Happily, [b]Crimsonland[/b] offers exactly that: the number of weapons isn't overwhelmingly large, but they are very different from each other and most ask for an appropriate playstyle to make the most of them. You'd better stay out of the melee with the Ion Cannon and take on the mob from a distance, but a flamethrower just wants you to get in there are clear a small ring of safety around you.

Thankfully, 10TonsLtd have also included a fairly large number of power-ups which appear during the fights and which come in most welcome when the crowds get bigger and bigger. Make no mistake: this is no easy-going game, and the going gets really tough towards the end of the different scenario's. Happily that's where the dozens of available perks come in: they offer a permanent of way of buffing your character, and allow for some degree of ever so slight character building, especially with regard to a playstyle which suits you best.

Graphically, the game gets the job done, but not more than that. Some extra effort and more visual appeal would have been welcome. Sound is pretty good though, with all weapons having a very clear identity of their own. Steam cards and a bunch of interesting - and some quite difficult - achievements make sure this game offers quite some playtime.

 --------------------------4 Mayıs'ta gelen güncellemeden sonra---------------------------


En çok eleştirdiğim Telekinetic perki eskisinden 3 kat daha iyi olmuş! (2. kat, nişan aldığımız magneti alabildiğimiz için; 3. kat, silahları mıktanıslayamadığımız için.) Biraz oyun hakkında yapılan yorumlara göz gezdirdiğimde; sanırım bu oyunun güncel versiyonu yapılırken, neden bu kadar kritik yanlışlar yapıldığını anlıyorum şu anda. Sebep, geliştiricilerin konsollara da hitap etmeye çalışmaları... Zaten genel olarak video oyunlarını giderek daha zevksiz hale getiren birinci sebep de buydu aslında. 
Şimdi gelelim oyundaki kanamaya devam eden yaraya, DENGE SORUNU. Ortalama bi Survival mod oyununda, level 5-6 gibi tıkanma başlıyor, ve yaptığımız hatalı hamlelerin telafisi olmuyor. Beyler, bu oyun amaçsızca yaratık öldürdüğümüz bir oyun; neden elimizi daha fazla güçlendirerek, ortalama bir survivalda bütün perkleri açabildiğimiz ve en az 15 dakika süren bir hale getirmiyorsunuz bunu? Sebep akıllı telefondan oynayanların sarjları çabuk bittiği için mi? Yazık.... Eski level sistemiyle(2000xp*1.8*1.8*1.8... şeklinde) yeniden ayarlansa, çok daha iyi olabilir aslında. Hayır, bizi daha az yaşatınca ve bir sürü perkten beşini altısını kullandırınca elinize ne geçiyor anlamıyorum.

2003 versiyonu için konuşmam gerekirse, gerçekten özlemişim fakat bu oyunda da denge sorunu mevcut. Buradaki sorun ise, level atlamak için gerekli xpler uygun seviyelerde, fakat yaratıkların güçlenme katsayıları çok yüksek. En kritik perkleri açabiliyoruz rahatlıkla, ama yaratıklar o kadar güçleniyorlar ki; en az 5-6 dakika kafa kafaya gitmemiz gerekirken, sürekli eziliyoruz.. Size tavsiyem; oyunun ilk 8-9 dakikasını karakterimizi inşa ettiğimiz, sonraki 4-5 dakikasını yaratıklarla kafa kafaya savaştığımız ve son 1-2 dakikasını da ölmeden önce ne kadar xp toplayabiliriz şeklinde, toplam 15 dakika civarlarında sürecek şekilde dengelemeniz.

Özetlemem gerekirse; ""DENGE"" kavramının olmadığı bir oyunu tavsiye edemem.

When this game was re-released on Steam, it was missing a lot of things that vets would be expecting to see there, like the perks in quest mode and the functionality of perks in survival mode.

You can also opt into the beta client to test out other new perks before they make it into the final build. The UI and HUD still feels like a mobile game but whatever.

Sadly, it is nothing more than a watered down version of the old game. Several key features that made the game great are now missing.

- No perks in quest mode. This is HUGE! For some reason 10tons removed perks from main campaign mode. Which basically took all the fun out of the core gameplay. 
- No weapon switching. You are now only able to have one weapon at a time, which not only limits your fun, but also your ability to win.
- No choosing when to take your next perk. There used to be a button for leveling up, which was very handy. It is now gone and instead the player simply levels up immediately via a pop-up menu. Not only does this detract from the overall strategy of the game, but it's also horribly disruptive. It will cause you to lose focus on the action, make mistakes, or even worse: accidentally pick the wrong perk. Because you have only one second to stop clicking before the perk menu pops up, you risk clicking on a random perk if you don't stop shooting. 
- No timer on powerups. It's a small thing, but again, it takes away from the subtle strategy of the game. There used to be a small timer for each individual powerup off to the side of the screen. That has been replaced with a generic circle icon surrounding the player character. You won't know how much time is left on any of your powerups except the most recent one. 

Without these features the game is, as one user said, butchered. It simply isn't as fun and doesn't contain the depth of strategy it used to.

Deixaram o maluco largado sozinho no meio do nada com hordas de bichos feios querendo um pedaço dele, e é sua missão meter bala em todos até não sobrar nenhum vivo! 

O sistema de armas é bem variado, com dezenas de opções que vão sendo desbloqueadas aos poucos conforme se avança. Ainda existem bonus/""pick-ups"" que auxiliam o jogador (e você vai precisar deles) que aparecem no cenário e podem ser coletados. E existem as ""perks"", que são habilidades que são liberadas com uso de EXP.; essas são bem variadas e podem ser combinadas para garantir sua sobrevivência.

O gameplay é repetitivo: você contra todos os bichos em uma arena que muda os cenários minimamente de fase para fase. Para evitar o enfado e aumentar o replay do jogo, este dispõe de de 6 modos de jogo diferentes:

- Quests: é o modo principal do jogo. 6 cenários com 10 fases diferentes cada. Este modo de jogo dispõe de 3 níveis de dificuldade. 

- Survival: nesse modo de sobrevivência a dificuldade vai aumentando gradativamente e o jogador é desafiado com inimigos cada vez mais fortes e numerosos. Este é o mais semelhante ao ""arcade"" dos fliperamas.

- Rush: o boneco, uma ak47 intermitente e monstros velocistas. 

- Nukefism: nesse modo o jogador não tem nenhuma arma, somente os bonus/""pick-ups"" que aparecem no cenário para avançar.

- Weapon picker: esse é interessante e requer um pouco de estratégia. O jogador dispõe das armas que aparecem no cenário, com um detalhe: só tem um clipe/recarga daquela arma. Acabou? Tem que pegar outra arma no cenário.

- Blitz: igual ao modo survival, só que muito mais rápido. 

Crimsonland ainda tem um jogo escondido. É só digitar ""gembine"" na tela dos créditos. Gembine é um puzzle que utiliza um quadro 4X4 onde, para ganhar pontos, deve-se combinar gemas iguais para criar gemas maiores. Quando se cria diversas gemas, é preciso ter cuidado para não fazer o movimento errado e colocar gemas que não combinam próximas, pois isso limitará o movimento do quadro e aí é game over.



Algumas dicas pra quem gosta de fazer todos os ""achievements"":

- Nas quests, pause o jogo e digite ""grim"". No menu secreto selecione ""perks em quests"" e seja feliz (vale principalmente para terminar o jogo em todas as dificuldades);
- Em ""Gembine"" fique ligado sempre na próxima gema que virá. Não faça vários movimentos afobados para formar as gemas maiores, analise o quadro todo primeiro. Procure sempre fazer os movimentos de tal forma que as gemas que se combinem fiquem próximas uma das outras. Assim você ampliará o seu tempo no jogo e a possibilidade de bater o ""high score"";
- Tenha paciência em ""Spideroids""... (armas como o ""flamethrower"" ou outra de tiro/recarga rápida são boas opções - eu consegui ""not a scratch"" usando a metralhadora de plasma).
- Entenda o sistema de perks e combine-as bem, principalmente nos modos survival e blitz. Quando o jogo vai avançando muito nos pontos, você vai depender dos pick-ups para manter-se vivo.  Perks como ""telekinetic"", ""my favourite weapon"", ""uranion filled bullets"", ""poison bullets"", ""greater regeneration"" são boas opções para conseguir pontuações altas.


Recomendo o jogo. Gastei mais tempo com ele do que imaginei que gastaria. Comprei em um Humble Bundle, mas se você curte jogos semelhantes, pode pegar em uma ""steam sale"" qualquer que não se arrependerá.",1454678001,1454683118,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Иногда просто нет желания решать головоломки, читать тексты или наслаждаться виртуальными пезажами. Тогда я просто включаю КЛ, и вновь погружаюсь в атмосферу насилия и хаоса, почти ощущая запах гари и мокрые брызги.

遊戲本身跟你的技術沒什麼關係，
打不打的贏，可以打多久都要看臉，
撿到什麼武器拿到什麼道具，抽到什麼 perk 完全看運氣，
辛辛苦苦打十幾次都不過有可能突然莫名其妙就過了，
所以就沒有什麼「研究什麼樣的武器跟技能組合來通關」這種事。

perk 機制真的很莫名其妙，一般遊戲模式是無法使用 perk 的，
你還要輸入特殊指令才可以開啟 perk 模式，
每場遊戲你還必須先打一定量的怪物獲得經驗之後才能「點技能」，
重點是有什麼可以點還是隨機的，那一開始的 perk 根本就沒必要搞解鎖啊！

「高超的走位技術來通關」在這個遊戲裡面也是不存在的，
因為地圖實在太小，你怎麼繞最後就是被包圍，
速度已經比怪物慢了，被怪物咬還會有硬直，
要過關你就只有「用超強大的火力迅速消滅怪物」這一條路可以走，
沒有其他的方法了。

順便譴責一下唯一難纏的怪物「分裂蜘蛛」，這到底是什麼鬼設計？
移動速度比你快，攻擊他他就會分裂成兩隻，
而且還會分裂好幾次，想從他們身上取得道具幾乎不可能，
因為分裂出來的怪會直接無延遲的往你走來，
你根本就不可能避開分裂出來的怪物海去撿 power up 或武器，

The graphics are okay for this type of game, but there is no music/sound if you just walk and aren't shooting.

The gameplay is too slow for me.  There isn't an option to skip through to the harder levels.  You are forced to play through the easy levels.  The game controls are simple, WASD to move and click to shoot.  Aside from the slow gameplay, the biggest problem for me was that mobs can spawn anywhere.  They do not come in off of the screen, so it's possible to die with full health because they spawn where you are standing.  You literally have no chance to move or defend yourself (this is the only way I was killed twice in the 30 minutes I played.  Level 2 - 8).  The levels appear to be static, so you can learn where they spawn and stay away from those areas, but I didn't like this aspect of the game.

The power ups appear where you kill a mob.  If you are skilled and kill mobs across the screen, due to your slow movement, there's a good chance the power up will disappear before you can loot it.  When a nuke drop (destroys all mobs close to you), you sometimes have to kill the mobs that are close to you to get to it.  By the time you can get it, there are no mobs to destroy with the power up.

There are spawners that pop up (think Gauntlet) which the mobs also spawn from.  I think the game could be a lot better if it had random spawning (off screen) or if they had pure spawners.

The gameplay is simple. You control a guy from a top-down perspective and you have a crosshair you aim at different enemies and you shoot them before they overrun you. The game can get very hectic at times but there are weapon pickups and perks that give you a fighting chance against the onslaught of monsters.

The weapons are pretty standard, with some sci-fi ones added in to the mix, ranging from a sub-machine gun to a swarm missile launchers and plasma cannons. They do a good job in being varied while still being simple and useful.

The perks are pretty fun, there is a wide variety from faster experience gain to faster reload or having a poison cloud around you that damages enemies and other quirky things. You get a choice of a few random perks every time you ""level up"".

This game is deceptively addictive. It is easy to pick up and  play and it will keep you entertained for a little while. It is also good game for an older machine or a netbook to pass a few minutes on a break.

But things start to pick up after the first chapter of the quests.

I decided to try this game out this week while waiting for my card drops on it. Started the ""campaign"" (which is basically just some levels with different enemy placements and different enemy and weapon selection for it), finished it in like 3 hours or something. I don't really know if there was a story because I really didn't care, I just wanted to shoot some stuff and see some blood. And it worked. Starts slow with shit weapons and normal enemies, and gradually introduces new enemies, new enemy types, new weapons and perks (which are useable on the Survival gamemode). So yeah, it starts slow and builds up into something cooler quite fast.

Gameplay: Normal top-down, twin-stick shooter, with quite a lot of weapons and different perks. Not many enemy types, but they work in ""races"", like, aliens, giant spiders, etc. Enemy design is quite okay for a game like this, and the shooting is really solid. Campaign was fun but the Survival gamemode is what really shines here. Lost another 4 hours playing the different survival modes to try to get a highscore. The game IS fun.

Graphics: Well, it was a 200mb download if I remember correctly. There aren't many different scenarios (they are just like a board of dust and sometimes some grass or some urban hangar stuff), which is something I didn't like that much. Enemies have cool designs, wouldn't say ""original"" but they're cool, you can see the difference from each one. Your character is quite simple and the animations are just fine. Overall, acceptable, though could have some more stuff in scenarios.

Sounds: The menu song made me instantly turn all sounds off because I didn't like the mixing in it (quite low quality), but won't say anything about game effects because I just wanted to kill stuff listening to some prog/death metal.

Story: heh.

Overall: 6/10. Cool game, can easily get you to waste some time of your life playing it and it is fun. Get it for the gameplay if there's a discount and you think this might be for you. Was quite a surprise for me.",1449194061,1449194061,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its just that for an update to a classic its terrible. The original didnt look as good, but this update just ruins several key gameplay mechanics, while slapping a fresh coat of paint on it.

The reason everyone liked the original was because of the gameplay, even at its release the original was a pretty ugly looking game that [i]played[/i] beautifully which is ultimately what matters.

Its pretty obvious that it has been dumbed down for a controller friendly playstyle

While this still has enough of the original in it to be a pretty good, fun game, honestly just play the original instead of this watered down version.

If the developers just added a ""classic mode"" toggle in the options which reverted the changes to the perks (specifically telekinesis), put perks back in campaign, basically an option to play a 100% faithful port of the real game with the new improved graphics (which I'm ambivalent on, its not really important for me.), I would gladly give it a thumbs up.

Edit (March 2016):

Well the devs delivered. They fixed every single thing I had a problem with.

Also they gave me what I really wanted all along: The original Crimsonland on Steam. And they gave it away for free as part of the deal along with the remake. I can finally play the original on steam, to add to the couple of hundred hours I have put into it over the years.

Спешу заявить, что ремейк получился отличным. У нас тут и улучшенная графика, и система достижений, и интеграция рекордов в Steam, а также много другое. Что же это за игра? Это один из лучших Shoot 'em up’ов нашего времени! Хотите знать почему? Сейчас я расскажу вам обо всё по порядку.

Во-первых, отличный дизайн игры, рисовка персонажа, монстров и оружия. Музыка в игре превосходная, подходит под весь этот ад, который происходит у вас на экране. А происходит вот что: вы совершенно один на неизвестной планете, у вас в руках пулемёт (или, например, ионная пушка), а вокруг вас сотни мутантов, нападающих со всех сторон. Они давят своим количеством, кажется, что наплыв не закончится. Вы стоите до последнего, но рано или поздно вы падёте, успев покрасить гигантскую территорию почвы неизвестной планеты в красный цвет. Если не мутанты вас прикончат, то это сделают реки их крови.

Во-вторых, невообразимое разнообразие различных видов вооружения: пистолеты, дробовики, винтовки, пулемёты, огнемёт, плазмамёты и ещё с полсотни других видов оружия. Вы где-нибудь такое видели? А как насчёт такого же количества различных перков для вашего персонажа? Всё это добро вы получите, проходя сюжетную кампанию. Правда, назвать её сюжетной сложно, сюжета здесь вообще нет. Просто набор уровней с разными условиями, количеством монстров и их видами. Закончите «сюжет» на нормальном уровне сложности – добро пожаловать на высокий и безумный. Вот тут-то вы сможете показать себя в полную силу. 

В-третьих, самый сок начинается тогда, когда вы пройдёте основную кампанию и откроете все виды оружия и перков. Добро пожаловать в режим выживания! Именно здесь «Багровая земля» показывает свою суть: бесконечные волны кровожадных мутантов и вы. Вопрос здесь только один: как долго вы сможете прожить на красной планете?

В-четвертых, в игре есть мультиплеер. Да, вы действительно может играть с вашими верными товарищами по оружию на одном компьютере. В таком случае вы возможно и проживёте дольше, но вас всё равно задавят. Сразу отмечу, что крошить армии монстров с друзьями значительно веселее, чем в одиночку, оно-то и понятно. Для тех, кто играет не сам, существует свой рейтинг выживания – групповой. Это сделано для того, чтобы игроки, которые выживают, в одиночку мерялись своими достижениями в одиночном ладдере. А те, кто предпочитают совместные операции – в кооперативном.

В-пятых, интеграция со Steam принесла свои плоды. Теперь в игре присутствует целый набор хардкорных достижений, выполнение которых может занять вас и не на один десяток часов. Игра действительно очень сложная. Появились списки лидеров по режимам, можно сравнить свои результаты с другими игроками со всего мира. 

На этом перечисление явных плюсов закончилось и начинается небольшая критика. Любая игра имеет свои недостатки, и «Багровая земля» не исключение. После прохождения примерно 15 уровней в одиночной игре, весь этот сочный отстрел мутантов может просто надоесть. А идти в режим выживания без открытых оружий с последних уровней кампании – самоубийство, вы не поставите высоких рекордов. Факт необходимости прохождения не очень-то интересной «сюжетки» может оттолкнуть игроков, слоняющихся в поисках игры, за которой они могли бы скоротать несколько вечеров. 

Главная «фишка» игры – рандомность. Ваш результат на половину зависит от того, насколько вам повезёт в той или иной ситуации: выпадет ли нужный павер ап из монстра, где он появится, сможете ли вы его подобрать и т.п. За сим, приходится перепроходить уровни десятки раз, для достижения желаемого успеха, а это – утомляет. Но постойте ка - это ведь Crimsonland, здесь и должно быть больно и кроваво, так?

Tiene un montón de modos de juegos por lo que no se vuelve tan monótono.

That being said... Crimsonland, sadly, isn't prefect. There are a few minor ni99les that keep this title from being worthy of it's full retail cost:
--The soundtrack is hugely lacking. I shut the in-game music off (which oddly only worked sometimes?).
--There is only art-variation in the different lands visited. No rocks, trees, ruins, hills, bunkers....nothing.
--The guns are a little basic and similarly designed. I think the devs could have had a TON a fun here, but sadly they stuck to a set design of weaponry.
--The online leaderboards are completely ruined by l33t-H4X0Rses posting moronic scores and kill counts (wash yer $#!+ once in a while!)

Jest to remake gry z 2002 roku - autorstwa studia ""10tons entertainment"". Dwuwymiarowa strzelanka z widokiem z góry w której kierujemy żołnierzem któremu przyjdzie zmierzyć się z niezliczoną ilością wrogów. 

Gra nasycona jest szybką i wartką akcją - każda nasza potyczka będzie unikalną a każda decyzja może okazać się brzemienna w skutkach gdyż wybór niewłaściwej broni czy też krok w złym kierunku może kosztować nas odrobinę życia (odbieranego nam dwojako - poprzez zetknięcie się z wrogiem czy też trafienie nas przez niektóre z wrogich jednostek strzelających). Czasami podjęcie innego typu broni czy też zebranie odpowiedniego bonusu zmienia dalsze losy walki.
W tej grze nie da się wygrać - nasza wygraną są dalsze sekundy życia a cała zabawa polega na tym by przeżyć jak najdłużej. Z każdą sekundą jest coraz trudniej - wrogowie przyśpieszają, jest ich coraz więcej i więcej - stopień trudności rośnie a nam zaczyna brakować miejsca dokąd możemy uciec...
Natrafiamy także na mniejsze jednostki które trudniej jest trafić. Dodatkowym utrudnieniem jest to, że niektórzy z wrogów nie chodzą po prostej - ale potrafią kluczyć co chwila zmieniając nieco kierunek poruszania się co uniemożliwia czasami ich trafienie. Gra wymaga niezłej zręczności i koordynacji oko-ręka by móc ustrzelić wroga i przewidzieć dokąd można będzie uciec przez zbliżającymi się przeciwnikami bądź też którędy strzelać by wyrąbać sobie przejście...

Do dyspozycji oddano nam pokaźny arsenał broni - zaczynamy z pistoletem lecz po zabiciu obcych możemy zebrać karabiny, miotacze ognia, shotguny czy też broń gaussa lub jonową. Bronie te odblokowujemy poprzez przejście kolejnych, coraz trudniejszych misji.
Dodatkowo odblokowujemy tzw. ""Perks"" czyli umiejętności - dają nam one szybszą regenerację, szybsze przeładowanie broni, umiejętność szybszego poruszania się - do użycia w trybie survival. Prócz tego - także bonusy które pojawiają się losowo na planszy w miejscu zabicia któregoś z przeciwników - i są to miedzy innymi takie możliwości jak zamrażanie na chwilę wrogów, pole ochronne które pozwoli nam przeżyć o chwilę dłużej dotykając wrogów, nuklearka która wybuchnie rażąc wszystkich wrogów wokół, szybsze przemieszczanie się, .

Gra udostępnia kilka trybów rozgrywki i są to ""Quest"" czyli tryb misji ze zdefiniowanym scenariuszem tj. potworami które będą się pojawiać (co jednak nie znaczy iż każda rozgrywka będzie identyczna - oj nie...). Po przejściu każdej z dostępnych misji odblokowujemy nowe bronie, bonusy i umiejętności które możemy później wykorzystywać w trakcie rozgrywki.

Kolejnym trybem jest ""Survival"" który dzieli się na kilka podrzędnych i to właśnie ta kategoria dostarcza nam największej frajdy z gry. 
Wspomniany ""Survival"" to rozgrywka gdzie mamy za zadanie przeżyć jak najdłużej przy pełnym arsenale sił i środków którymi dysponujemy - tj. bonusy, broń i umiejętności - a które odblokowaliśmy przechodząc tryb ""Quest"" czyli misje.  Oznacza to, iż są tu dostępne wszystkie odblokowane umiejętności i bonusy. Jedynie od naszych umiejętności... i szczęścia... zależeć będzie co nas spotka i jak długo będzie nam dane przeżyć przy stale rosnącym poziomie wytrzymałości potworów...

Kolejny to tryb ""Rush"" - podobny do trybu survival z tym, że tu nie pozyskamy innej broni - dysponujemy tylko karabinkiem Assault Rifle z nieograniczoną ilością amunicji bez konieczności przeładowania magazynka. W tym trybie nie ma dostępnych perków ani bonusów więc nie przeżyjemy tu nazbyt długo. Wymagany wyjątkowo szybki refleks i umiejętność wymijania przeciwników...

Następnym trybem gry jest ""Weapon picker"" - gdzie jesteśmy limitowani pojemnością magazynka - broni nie da się przeładować za to co chwila pojawia się gdzieś obok następny egzemplarz. Wystarczy wybrać tą której potrzebujemy i zaplanować w którą stronę wyładujemy magazynek...

Dalej mamy tryb ""Nukefism"" gdzie nie możemy używać broni a jedynie zbierać wszelakie bonusy i dzięki temu staramy się przetrwać jak najdłużej. Musimy planować... i oczywiście liczyć na szczęście.

Jednym z najciekawszych trybów (prócz questów) jest tryb survival. Pozwala on na grę z użyciem wszystkich odblokowanych broni oraz bonusów i w sam raz nadaje się na szybkie odreagowanie...

Ta gra wciąga i można ją polecić każdemu - jest doskonałą odskocznią na szybkie walki z niezliczonymi oddziałami wroga i w tym sprawdza się doskonale. Posiada także tryb kooperacji który dodatkowo urozmaica grę - na jednym komputerze możemy grać wraz z przyjaciółmi do 4 osób jednocześnie i wspólnie zmierzyć się z niezliczonymi hordami obcych.
Sama gra nie zatrzyma cię na długo ale zawsze można do niej wrócić by odreagować po ciężkim dniu...",1441169882,1441169882,True,3,0,0.482563763856887817,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-= About the game itself =-

Game's campaign consist of 6 chapters and each of them have 10 levels. Depending on your skills and guns you pick up each level takes no longer than 10 minutes, but with every new level your enemies become harder to kill same as their count on map grows. By completing levels like in any other game you unlock new perks and guns.

Campaign kept me busy for around 3,5 hour, while after the finish game still offers you a replay in harder difficulties. If you feel that you don't want to start it all over again, you always can choose one of 5 different survivals. Each new survival unlocks as you progress in a game's campaign.  

On top of that you can play this game with up to 4 friends in co-op which makes it to be even more fun and later compare your highscores with the rest of the world.

Personally I don't have nothing to say bad about games mechanics and or gameplay, it is really entertaining, but one thing kind of bothers me and it is that when you pick up a gun your previous gun disappears and there are no possible way to scroll between weapons, so you have to kill with a gun you take. At some point, accidentally picking up a worse gun can cost you a restart, so you have to be careful on what gun you are about to take.

That's the game I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. 

The review below is talking about the remake.

What a disappointment. I lost weeks and weeks and failed many exams because of how fun and addictive the original was.
First of all, the style of the game is changed - I assume they wanted to give it a more modern look, but it just looks like an amateur designed it. Menus, illustrations of weapons, even sprites of your player and the enemies, they all look so ugly and plastic. Sure, they made the terrain more detailed, but who gives a shit about that? Also, you are now much closer to the ground and your player, so you don't see as much field as you used to. Meaning, less room to move. 

The gameplay is basically the same, and many people will think that it is enough - perhaps before they play the game. Important part of the first game was perk selecting (there are still power-ups that you can pick up in the game, they appear after you destroy a random enemy) you could basically level your player in every part of the quest, and start over in the next chapter. It was so fun to choose perks while playing, you had to make the choice between those offered and sometimes it was really choosing the lesser evil. Now, you want to choose perks in a quest mode? Fuck you. You can't.

Energy bar is shown in a circle around your player, this is another annoying thing because it draws your attention from enemies and the level. It's bright blue, yeah, seems like someone at 10tons has a bright blue fetish. 
A HUGE miss is the fact that your ammo count isn't in the corner or at the top of the screen - it's NEXT TO YOUR CROSSHAIR. How are you supposed to aim if often you aren't sure what your crosshair is? I really can not understand what were they thinking while redesigning this game.

-------

I stand by my words - the redesign made the game worse. This game is worth the money because you can play the 2003 version, and that one rocks so damn hard. Play it, enjoy it (quite annoying that you have to run it from Steam every time so that you'd get a pop-up asking you which version you want to run; if you just click on the shortcut on your desktop, you'd get the shitty version and no one wants that).
Redesigned version is useless.

That's about it. I mean, really. Things come from all sides and you shoot them.

And it feels pretty damn satisfying! 
I've got to say, this is a game that I'm in 2 minds about. On one hand, it has a pretty bad design, in the places where it counts. On the other hand, it's glorious to paint the field red with the blood of your enemies!

The game has a ton of different weapons, which is great on survival mode! On the survival modes, you also have a ton of perks that alter your play a bit, almost like modern rogue-lites. The game has no bosses, no maps, no levels, nor anything else of that sort. It does have quite a bit of enemy variety, although the differences between the types are very subtle.

The game also has a ""campaign"" of sorts, with different levels. The campaign is dreadful. If you read the reviews, you can see most people calling the game out as ""randomness instead of skill"", and it's absolutely true. On these levels, you have to rely on the ""right"" weapon dropping for you to beat a level. Sometimes that being insufficient, requiring additional power-ups at the right moments. 
Beating it on ""Normal"" is fine, but on Hardcore, there's one particular level that requires astronomical luck. It's called Spideroids and it's dreadful. It features these Spider enemies that work as follows: big, slow spider -> kill it, you get 2 smaller, but faster spider -> kill it, get another 2, smaller and faster -> this happens like 8 times or something ridiculous like that. Your character doesn't run faster than the small spiders, and to add insult to injury, they actually gain speed overtime, so you'll be overrun after a while.
Unless you get a very specific set of drops, it's impossible to win.

The AI in this game is both great and bad. It's more intelligent than to run directly at you. On Spideroids, though, it makes things impossible. I'm not even sure if the game was actually playtested (as in, without cheats -- without choosing weapons and powerups at will, making sure that it is possible, regardless of the chance of those conditions happening)... 
Some enemies run at you, while others observe where you're going, and they adjust their direction to meet you at that point. 

Each type of enemy also has different characteristic that are quite interesting! For example, zombies are slower and then to flock, while spiders are quick and unpredictable. That sort of thing. They all try to get to you in a swarm, but they have different details that are very much appreciated!

Overall, the campaign is very situational. Fortunately, where the game shines is one its Survival Modes. There are 4 or 5 different ones that you can choose from. The game and your character are rather slow, which is boring. There is one mode, though, called Blitz, where things are a bit faster, and it's freakin' awesome! I really enjoyed that mode. 

The sound design is solid, but the music was very uninsteresting to me. 
The weapons' sounds are very distinct from one another, but I feel that they lack a bit of power, in general. Nothing too important, as the game still feels great to play!


There isn't much to say at all, here. It's a very old-school type of game. It's like the analog of Painkiller and Hard Reset in 2D. While 3D shooters have the great advantage of a fully fleshed physics and first person perspective to make things visceral (God, bolt weapons in Bioshock felt so good!), Crimsonland swarm you with enemies from all sides, each hit splashing blood on the floor and leaving bodyparts behind. Ones that don't actually vanish! 

There's something fantastic about these mindless games that really appeal to me! And if this sounds like your cup of tea, go for it! As I said, the campaign isn't very good (beat it once to unlock all of the weapons and perks), but the core game is great!

The game has many different kinds of enemies that are sufficiently different from each other, and even more weapons and perks. Perks are used in the survival mode, where you can activate a new perk every time you cross a certain threshold in scores. They, too, are very diverse, and I like their descriptions that are spiced with some dark humor.

The game has just the right learning curve. The levels get tougher the further you proceed, but you never feel like a level is unwinnable. Sure, you may have to try it five, ten, or fifty times, but you can always see your progress bar at the top of the screen and see that you actually did slightly better than the previous time.

Every single mission will place you on a flat map without any obstacles or anything else but monsters that keep spawning.

Each mission will spawn different combinations of enemies, but in each mission your goal is the same and that is to kill everything on screen.

Now can a game without a story and map design be fun? Absolutely! Unfortunately this is not one of those games that managed to pull that off and it's just not fun.

So what's wrong with it? Well you'd expect this kind of game to be fast paced action-filled shooter right? Well that's not really what this game is. Your character is very slow and that really ruins the gameplay in my opinion.

Another issue I have with the game is that weapons aren't balanced. A lot of them are simply underpowered and not worth using. Also the way you get weapons in this game is random. When you kill enemies they sometimes drop weapons or power-ups.

The first enemy you kill in a mission will almost always drop a weapon. So what you'll probably end up doing is keep restarting the mission until your first drop ends up being a good weapon so you have a better chance of beating the mission. You might do that even in easier missions because beating a mission without taking damage will give you a star on that mission.

When it comes to beating missions without taking damage in order to get stars, picking up power-ups is important. However due to your character moving very slowly and enemies moving at your speed or faster and in packs, picking up power-ups without taking damage can be very tricky or near-impossible in certain missions.

Usually in challenging games I feel good when I finally beat a hard level, it feels like an achievement. In this game however that's not the case. I don't end up feeling good, nor that I achieved something. I just end up being glad I got that mission over with and ask myself do I really want to go for another mission or should I just close the game.

I wouldn't recommend this game even if it were freeware as it's just not enjoyable. I really don't know why they think their game is worth 14€.",1440161868,1440162200,False,8,0,0.461351662874221802,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I really wanted to like this game. I played the original version in 2003 and loved it. Now 80% of the time I spend playing Crimsonland I am angry or frustrated or both.

I don't know exactly what changed (aside fromt the obvious nerf to the Telekinesis-Perk). Maybe I as a player have a different approach to games now. Back then it might have been less important to me to finish a game 100% before playing something else.
Now I mostly strife for completion or at least getting as close as I can. And in the case of Crimsonland that turned out to be  an incredible pain in the behind.

So maybe it's due to my attitude and not to questionable gamedesign but my experience with this new iteration of Crimsonland was mostly unpleasant.

What bugged me most was the random factor when it comes to your weaponry. In most levels and Survival runs you start with the pistol and one of the first 3 or 4 monsters you slay will drop another gun. This game has alot of weapons. Most of those are way underpowered. If they were better balanced or if I as a player had at least some kind of influence over which drops I see and which I won't see, that would make a huge difference. Restarting a level over and over again until finally one of those 5 or 6 viable weapons pop up is NOT fun. In most levels that is not necessary but trying to complete the harder ones with a suboptimal gun is just a waste of time.

I have to say though, the carnage and frenzy of the original are still there. The soundtrack is awesome and if you get one of those (sadly) rare runs where everything falls into place and you get the right weapons, perks and drops in the right moment then it is indeed a wonderful experience. Full of bloody gore, splattered enemy-corpses and agonized screams.",1437687363,1492354812,True,2,0,0.560185134410858154,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Pour l’ultra-hostile, vous jouez un Légionnaire de l’Espace (les américains parlent de « Space Marine » mais tout le monde sait qu’ils ne font pas le poids face aux Légionnaires de l’Espace) et votre vaisseau s’est écrasé sur une planète peuplée que de prédateurs. Vous êtes le seul survivant. Il va falloir tirer, tuer, massacrer avant de devenir la pause quatre heures d’un quelconque prédateur de cette planète.

Just like back then it's extremely addictive by being hard yet rewarding. I lost track of time until I beat the game and realized several hours had passed. Surprisingly relaxing for a high pace shooter though, but that could also be because of the high level of nostalgia.

The game itself is great. It's a classic and as such it also got some secrets hidden within it. Like, hidden minigames and unlockables. That's always a nice touch ;)

The graphics are pretty simple, but that is to be expected for this type of game. Even so they're definitely not bad looking and they still fill their purpose. It's easy to keep track of what's going on (except one time when two mobs look very similar, that was the only time I got a bit confused).
The sounds and music are nice, I'm tempted to play other games with this soundtrack in the background sometimes. The only thing I want to complain about when it come to sound is that when some mobs fire, they use the same sound as some of your guns. 
That was probably the only thing that bugged me about this game in general besides only having local coop. I don't really see why they wouldn't add coop online, unless they're afraid lag would make it too frustrating to play over the net since it can be pretty high pace at times.

I do recommend to check out the flash game first if you hesitate on getting this game, personally I do not regret getting it on steam since I simply love the game (and it was on sale). But if in doubt: always look things up, which in these cases are very easy since the flash version is free to try online.

Делали под консоли, поэтому управление стало хуже, перки из квестовой части убрали, играть совсем не интересно.

upd Написали разработчики, попросили оценить обновленную игру. 
Что же я вижу: во-первых, жирный плюс им в карму - доступ к классической, старой доброй версии игры. Это на самом деле замечательно, теперь можно рекомендовать игру к покупке хотя бы из-за этого. Купить старую версию прежними способами уже давно было нельзя, а теперь вот появилась такая возможность легально прикоснуться к классике.
В новой же версии всё не утешительно: да, теперь перки доступны в квестах - окей, но их нельзя ""отложить на потом"", получил - сразу применяй и никак иначе. Тупо. Да и кампания делалась без учёта их доступности, поэтому стала очень сильно рандомной сложности (попадётся удачный перк - очень легко, не попадётся - всё равно будет легче, чем задумывалось). Ну и да, эта функция была в игре и раньше, просто как чит, а теперь её сделали доступной по умолчанию. 
А, ещё написали, что телекинез вернули. [strike]Он куда-то пропадал? Как был кривой консольный магнит всего что рядом, так и остался.	[/strike] Да, действительно, телекинез теперь работает как надо: подбирает предметы, на которые наводишь курсор. Дополнительно примагничивает бонусы, но только бонусы - оружие остаётся лежать там, где лежит.
В общем, я остаюсь при своём мнении: этот кримсонлэнд делали для консолей, чтобы срубить с них побольше денег, а версия для пк делалась по остаточному принципу, вот мы и получили то, что получили. Грустно, что разработчики сами не понимают, как сильно они накосячили и где.

upd2 И всё-таки после нескольких часов игры, нормально. С перками в квестах, игра на самом деле затягивает и почти приближается к старому доброму кримсонлэнду. Старая версия всё равно лучше, но играть можно и в новую.

Ну і звичайно ж, 10tons не забули про режим ""раш"", в якому ми відстрілюватимемо нескінченні орди використовуючи автомат. Кому режим виживання здавався розтягнутим, є прискорена версія.

Зайшовши в гру, одразу помічаєш, що камера стала ближчою, інформативність значно зменшилась. Кількість ХП показана кружечком навколо героя. Також навкого героя відображається тривалість дії щита. Не густо, а коли навколо тебе орди монстятини, то ще й достобіса незручно. Теж саме стосується і лічильника патронів. Він знаходиться над прицілом. Нащо було корявити майже ідеальний в своїй простоті інтерфейс? Забув додати, тривалість бонуса на спринт тепер ніде не відображається! Шик!
Стосовно самих бонусів, їх стало трохи більше. До заморозки, щита і інших ""ветеранів"" додали плазма-карусель і плазма-перевантаження. Також певні бонуси змінились у плані механіки: Fireblast і Fire Bullets підсилили до ступені ""ух ти ж ні [censored] собі!!!"", заморозка тепер не розповсюджується на всіх і вся, підкріплення, які прибули після активації не перетворяться на кригу, таймер так само потрапив під ніж.

Стосовно монстрів. Ввели новий вид: жуки-олені. Варіюється від ""тьху"" до термінатора, який знімає 90% хп за один укус, стріляє і стає невразливим. Ящірки скоріш за все посиленно тренувались на стадіоні впродовж розробки: тварюки середнього розміру чухають так, ніби в них реактивна тяга!
Арсенал зброї також поповнився цікавими зразками. Але як завжди 70% цьої машинерії буде просто ігноруватись через слабкі показники (виживання) або недоречність (квести)
Перки також зазнали певних змін, додали нові екземпляри, а старі переробили. І от тут мені, як фанату, захотілось просто повисмикувати руки розробникам! ЯКОГО ПСА ВИ РУХАЛИ ТЕЛЕКІНЕЗ?! Хто пограє, зрозуміє мій крик душі. Теж саме стосується відсутності прокачки у режимі квестів. Без перків проходження певних рівнів перетворюється в лютий абзац!
Графон став більш мажорним: отримавши пару куль після смерті, монстри розлітаються на запчастини!

Maybe some old fans dislike the changes implemented in the past years, but the fact remains: Crimsonland is still one of the best top-down arcade style shooter games ever released.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Crimsonland was originally released in 2003 on the now-defunct Reflexive Arcade, where it quickly raised to fame and glory among the indie game players. With good reason. It features constant action against a horde of aliens in several game modes (chief among them are the campaign and survival) with a plethora of weapons and special player perks– both which have been expanded over and over throughout the years.
Yeah, there is no story, no voice acting, and only a handful of music tracks, but, frankly, they aren’t needed even in the least bit.

This version has some controversy among the older players though. Crimsonland started as a simple 2D top-down shooter, but between its original release and the 2014 debut on Steam, the whole engine was remade, along with most of the game modes. Perks and weapons received an overhaul (new ones added, some powerful ones removed or rebalanced), the typing shooter game mode was replaced with some not so original ones, and campaign mode now lacks perks completely.
But even though if you miss the über-powerful old telekinesis ability and dislike the number of barely useful new weapons, Crimsonland is still a damn good and fun game to play, one that will probably won’t be replaced for at least another decade.",1430226661,1430226661,True,4,0,0.53924638032913208,2,False,False,False,False,,,

No story, no cutscenes, only pure violence. You need to kill as many enemies as possible or they will kill you. But they have some advantage - they will kill you, no matter how hard you will try to survive. But with every death you will be better and better and you will want to try again and again.
I remember playing that game about 10 years ago and it was a great experience. How is that now? As you can see, When I'm writing those words, I have 15 hours played and I still play it from time to time. Maybe it's not as good as it was long time ago, but it's still a good game, so I can recommend it without hesitation.
But I have to warn you, this is not an easy game.

VERDICT:
If you're a pacifist, better stay away of this game.
But if you love to slay monsters in bloody way, you'll have plenty of fun here.

Now onto the Steam port...

+ Now you can play co-op with 4 players, but only 1 person can play with keyboard & mouse.
+ Nice arsenal of weapons. Of course there are many tiers of weapons, but no gun is super weak, just some are more powerful to certain enemies. The new Splitter Gun is difficult to use but it's super overpowered in certain maps.
+ Nice variety of monsters
+ Nice perk system. A few are missing from the classic game but it's not that big of a deal.

If you are a fan of the top-down shooter genre, get this game, this has been an inspiration for A LOT of newer games. Yet imo no new game has succeed Crimsonland yet.
The only negative thing, this game is way too overpriced on Steam.

Original review below.

-----------------------------------

Original review: Inferior to the original. The survival mode isn't as fun anymore. They disabled levelling and perks in the campaign, so now its just boring. ""Hardcore"" mode feels much too easy - I've beaten several levels without even trying, whereas in the original I struggled even playing on Normal mode.

I used to sink hours into the original just playing the survival mode and trying out different combinations of perks and weapons. But in the steam version? I have only made it up to around level 7 in survival, then some OP enemies come along and I die every single time - no matter what weapon, or the perks I choose. 

They ruined the majority of the fun the original had. Its not the same at all, and that makes me sad.

Avoid this version. Buy the original somewhere off the internet instead.",1428626214,1492727013,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The main formula of the game is simple: Massacre all the bugs, aliens, zombies and other creatures of the map and while you're at it destroy their hives aswell. It's a formula that has been done in dozens of games. 

Everytime you beat a level, you either earn a new weapon (30 in total) or a new perk (50 in total) which are suppose to help you ofcourse. Most of the weapons are fun to play with but obviously some are better than others. I did not really care much about the perks, the dev could've just made the creatures more difficult to kill but instead gave you these perks. 

In my experience the difficulty in Crimsonland was mostly based on sheer luck. Every level you start of with your pistol. The first creature you kill drops a better gun, if you're lucky you gain one of the better weapons which already makes the level a lot easier. 

Crimsonland also relies heavily on powerups, since they often make the difference of surviving a level. Powerups like: slowmo, frozen enemies, plasma ammo and even a nuke will make the game much easier, sometimes even too easy, especially if you get 6+ powerups next to each other. 

Graphically, the game looks pretty good for a top-down game, killing hundreds of creatures is satisfying and the game really makes you feel like you're a total badass, even if you're not.

Overall, Crimsonland is a solid top-down shooter, It's probably the best game of it's sort right now. Although I believe the game is more about luck than about skill, it's still fun and enjoyable.",1428354103,1428354103,True,3,0,0.552004992961883545,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Well, there's still a lot of randomness involved. Every level or match you get random weapons and pickups. However, the developers just released an update which pretty much buffed everything in the game, making it a lot more accessible. They've also added several new game modes and made various quality of life improvements. Finally, the original Crimsonland is now included.

I'm impressed, this game has been out for a while but it's still being updated and improved. I'm changing my review to a thumbs up.

But the original Crimsonland came out over ten years ago, and a ton of overhead shooters have been released over that period.  The genre has moved forward, while this new release of Crimsonland has either stayed stuck in the past or even regressed.

Character movement is sluggish and balance isn't even a concept.  Luck is a major factor in surviving, both in the form of getting the right weapon drop and in the battle-reversing power of certain random power-ups.

You can play Quest mode or Survival.  You can unlock weapons and perks as you progress, but both only randomly appear as you play and perks only appear in Survival.

Quest Mode has you facing preset monster waves.  Defeat a wave without taking a hit in order to gold star it.  This pretty much makes your lifebar pointless, as there is little point in beating a stage without getting the gold star.  Further, as said earlier, luck is a major factor.  The starting pistol doesn't do enough damage to control some waves, and bad luck could see weapon drops appearing in groups that you cannot navigate without taking damage (and thus losing that gold star).  On the other hand, getting the right weapon means you can stay ahead of enemy hordes even with poor play/aim.

Survival Mode has you facing screen-filling waves of enemies that have just been thrown together.  You level up as you kill enemies, and leveling up allows you to choose a new perk from a random selection.  The problem here is that Survival mode is simply boring.  You mindlessly mow down colorful bullet sponges, triggering power-ups as they appear, hoping to grab and maintain the best crowd control gun for your style.  Eventually you get overwhelmed and die.

The game lacks ""oomph"".  Weapons are boring, and most don't feel like they have impact. Movement feels sluggish. Unlocks are largely meaningless, when the game gives them randomly anyway.  There isn't any variety to play.  There is no excitement, and plenty of games have since done the graphical trick of gradually bathing the area in blood.

There is nothing else to Crimsonland.  It may be (based on) a classic, but it is a relatively expensive and fairly mediocre entry in a crowded field.  It has Steam Trading Cards, but the game isn't interesting enough to earn more than one card legitimately (through actually playing the game) versus just idling for cards.",1427595983,1427595983,False,1,0,0.480657011270523071,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Get it!!! I haven't tried the Local CoOp yet, will update the review once I am done.

First of all, this game isn't Serious Sam or an equivalent to it. Its old-school arcade top-down shooter. If you have played Alien Shooter (1 or 2), and you liked it. Then you will LOVE this one!

Its such a great time-killer. I am sure that it will be twice as fun with Local CoOp. Can't wait to try it out on CoOp.

Pros-
* Many game modes- Quest Mode (10 levels in 6 worlds), Survival Mode (has 5 sub-types).
* Great Sound track
* Many many many Weapons to kill enemies with
* Many many many types of aliens (Spiders, Beetles, Zombies and many more!)

Cons-
* No story. Well who cares? Its a twin-stick top-down shooter! Not really a con.
* You can't use Perks in the game, unless you circumvent it. (more at bottom..)
* Can't choose the weapon that you wish to you

Circumventing to enable Perks in Quest Mode:
Press Escape key, once in menu trype ""GRIM"" and you should get a dialog box, just tick ""Enable Perks in Quest Mode"" and you are done.
Everytime you level-up you will get to choose a perk!

Des monstres en veux-tu en voilà avec des boss ? -1 Y a pas de boss, c'est dommage ça aurait pu rajouter de la difficulté.
Des capacités spéciales que l'on débloque en passant des niveaux ? Alors là je mettrai un +1 et un -1 Car effectivement, a chaque map du normal on débloque soit une nouvelle arme, soit une nouvelle capacité, et autant vous dire qu'il y en a un sacré paquet ... LE SEUL problème c'est que pour toute la campagne les capacités ne SERVENT A RIEN !

En fait elle ne servent que dans DEUX modes parmis les QUATRE proposé en survie ... Soit dit en passant, dans chacun de ses modes si vous arrivez à atteindre le niveau 20, et autant vous dire que c'est coton, le jeu bug invariablement et vous fait passer un niveau toute les 3 secondes en permanence sans aucun temps morts, donc au début on se dit chouette ! vais pouvoir prendre tout plein de capacités ... jusqu'au moment où en fait on ne peux plus jouer car le passage de niveau continue indéfiniment et on se laisse tuer, difficilement. 
Dans les fait débloquer des capacités et armes en campagne je trouve ça bien, mais franchement les devs ... abusez pas, on veux pouvoir les utiliser ses capacités en mode campagne. Alors faire, par exemple, une création de perso pourvu d'un certain nombre de capacité disponible que l'on remplirai comme on le sent ça serait bien car c'est un peu barbant de se taper les 3 niveaux de difficultés avec ses 180 missions au total pour au bout du compte voir qu'il y a une capacité indébloquable, probablement buggé et qu'il existe une arme qui n'est ni listé et dont l'obtention est impossible normalement ...

Crimsonland is a simply fantastic and fanastically simple game to just kill time with, with a very rewarding pace and progression.

On releasing this new version at Steam, the devs removed ""Perks"" - powerful abilities which you can obtain by killing enemies - from main quest mode. Of course this is just a challenging move which every developers wanna try, and this time it made quest mode standing in another good balance. Yeah it's great.
But the problem is, the dev have left an option to enable those perks, while you can achieve any achievements with it on. And hid it like a cheat command, but wrote its method by themselves on forum.

Now, one player tried to achieve something difficult without perks, but didn't make it by his own and searched threads for tips.
Then he found many people saying:
""Nah it's too easy""
""This perk is useful: ~~~""
""The other stage was much difficult, since I couldn't use perks""
He even found some people saying ""Woohoo! I got this achievement by using these perks!"".

I wonder why the dev hid it like a cheat while saying it is ""an option""? And why allowed to unlock achievements saying ""without perks are balanced and recommended""? 
You should get noticed if it is a fair option to enjoy the game, and if the game is balanced without perks and enabling it would be like cheating, the results should be separated from normal play.

Now, no one is talking about without-perks playing on forum and achievements become worthless, though newcomers trying to achieve them without perks.",1426195880,1426196465,False,15,0,0.463900655508041382,5,False,False,False,False,,,

クエストモードをノーマルで全クリ、サバイバルモードをひと通りプレイした上での雑感。

とにかく主人公の足が遅いため、敵の数が多いとステージの外周を回りながらちまちま撃退し、隙を見てドロップしたパワーアップアイテムで巻き返しを図るのが定石。というかこれを守らないとダメージで一瞬停止する上無敵時間が無いので即座に囲まれて死ぬ。
ただでさえスポーンする敵の数が多いのに、スポナーやら分裂する敵が複数出てくる。それを優先して破壊しようとしても際限なくスポーンする肉壁によって阻まれるという事態が頻繁に起きる。
よって単体にしかヒットしないライフル系、マシンガン系は絶対に主力足りえず、ほぼクエストモードの序盤かサバイバルモードのウェポンピックアップでしか輝けない。(ウェポンピックアップに於いてはほぼガトリングガン一択だが)
範囲攻撃武器を持ったとしてもまだ安心は出来ない、このゲームの一番いやらしい敵キャラ、死ぬと一回り小さくなって二匹に分裂するクモ(長い)がいる。何回分裂するかは数えていないが兎に角ものすごく増える。殺してもそこに二匹スポーンするため道を切り開けず、ほぼ引き撃ちするしか打つ手がない。前進できないというのがここまで辛いものかと痛いほどにわからせてくれる。
ちなみにクエストモードの最終ステージはこのクモを含めたボスラッシュという鬼畜ステージ。クリアするまでに何度死んだかはわからないが二時間かかった。

この苦行を終えたらとうとう楽しいサバイバルモード。
レベルが上がるごとに4つランダムで表示されたパークの内の1つを取得して様々な特殊能力を得られ、クエストよりも立ち回りに自由度が出る上、使用武器によっても育成方向が変わってくるのでリプレイ性が高い。
しかしクエストと違い全方向のステージ外から敵が攻めてくるので囲まれやすく、何を優先して行動するかが鍵となる。


かなりのめりこんでプレイできたので個人的にはオススメ、惜しむらくはローカルcoopなところか。
定価はちょいとお高めだと思うのでセールかバンドル入りの時に是非。

Ein Topdown-Shooter der Extraklasse. Mit teilweise extremen Schwierigkeitsgrad.
Man ballert aus der Vogelperspektive alleine oder mit bis zu 3 Freunden Monstermassen über den Haufen.
Selten ein so frustrierendes Game gezockt, das einen aber trotdem immer wieder motiviert weiter zu machen.

Es gibt insgesamt 60 Level mit jeweils 3 Schwierigkeitsgraden. Dazu gibt es noch 5 Survivalmodi.
Man kann aus über 30 Waffen wählen und es gibt ca 50 Perks. Dazu noch jede Menge Powerups zum einsammeln.

Pros:
-Viele Level, Waffen und Perks
-Lokaler Multiplayer
-Gembine Minigame
-einfaches RPG-System

Contras:
-Kein Onlinemultiplayer
-Teilweise schlechtes Levelbalancing
 
Wer schauen will wie es aussieht. Hab hier ein paar Gameplayvideos auf meinem Youtubechannel.

Loads to do with many modes, and given the random nature of things even replaying a previous level for a better result never feels the same.

Graphics are ok, could have been better but for accessability to lower systems they are just fine and the music could not have been better compliments the game very well and is high quality.

This time with updated graphics, weapons, perks, and game modes.

I was a huge fan of the original and was ecstatic to see it get rereleased on Linux.

When it comes to top down shooters, Crimsonland is by far the best out there. Controls are very percise and mappable. The graphics update is beautiful when compared to the original and quite nice for being a 2D game. The interface also got a face lift. Orignially, your ammo count was an image on the top that showed you how many shots you had left. Now, it is a counter above the mouse. I prefer this seeing as I'm mostly looking at the mouse. In the original, any bonus you picked up would give you a count down in the upper left. Now, if the bonus affects your gun (firing rate, fire bullets, etc.) you get a yellow countdown around your mouse. If the bonus affects your character (shield) you get a clock like counter around your health bar (which is also now around the character instead of in the upper left hand corner). There are no countdowns for 2x, Freeze, or Speed bonuses. Some indication would be helpful, especially for the Speed bonus. But, I won't fault them too much on those. Lastly, the perk selector was overhauled as well. Originally, a window would pop up that listed the perks in a vertical list with a discription on the bottom. Now, they are images listed horizontally with the name under it when the mouse is hovered over it and the discription on the bottom and the biggest difference is that in the original you would hit Tab to open the perk selector. In the new version it appears automatically and you are forced to pick something to continue.

Some of the weapons updates are nice but I feel that there are too many. While they are nice, since the weapon drops are completely at random you might never get the gun you really need for late game. Also, before the 1.9 patch of the original there was a trick to using the Pulse Gun and using the Angry Reloader perk that just made you dominate the map early on. This was ""fixed"" in 1.9 which was a huge let down in my opinion.

I can't really say much about the perk other than telekenisis. This perk was changed heavily. Originally, you would hover your mouse over a bonus for a full second and you would pick it up. This made you have to be looking in its direction, which made it hard if you had enemies behind you. You basically had to stop shooting at them to pick up the bonus or time it so you could position them between you and the bonus to shot them. Now, the closest bonus will move towards you. I actually prefer this new method over the previous. Lets you focus more on the fight and less about trying to pick up the bonus. My only complaint is that I think the longer the bonus is traveling, the faster it should move. If you are running backwards, the bonus will never reach you because you can out run it. Still a better approach, though.

They also added a new game mode. Nukefism gives you no weapons and only bonuses to pick up. Very hard game mode which is why the achievement is unlocked when you get 75,000 points in it. 

With all of this being said, I feel that the price may be a little bit high considering that the original was only 10 dollars USD in 2004. By no means do I consider this a 14 dollar title, especially when they removed a great game mode and didn't really add anything of a story. When Survival mode will last, at best, 10 minutes before you get overwhelmed by enemies, these quick matches, I feel, makes the 14 dollar USD price tag a little bit much. However, on sale, this is a great buy.

The biggest drawback to Crimsonland is that it relies a bit too rmuch on the random factor. I would have loved to see a game mode like Survival but where you can remove, say, 10 weapons and 15 perks from the pool. This would let someone get rid of some of the bad weapons and perks (like the Blowtorch... seriously, the Blowtorch? Why? I'd rather take the Pulse gun over the Blowtorch).

Lastly, the Linux port was amazingly done. Performance was as expected. Some reports of reversed X axis on game pads which I believe are fixed as of this writing (or will be fixed soon). I did experience 1 random crash but I think that was caused by something else happening at the same time.

If you are a fan of quick match top down shooters, storyless and senseless violence, or simple time killer games, I highly recommend this game. If you were a fan of the original, you might be left with a bad taste, but I was not.",1419188928,1561780121,True,4,0,0.542569339275360107,0,True,False,False,False,,,

但是当我看到14美元的定价时，我犹豫了一下。
最近它入了 indiegala ，我觉着是时候尝试一下了。

尽管它有着重绘过的画面，并且我感觉还不错，更多的关卡，排行榜以及成就同时改善了之前游戏中一些不合理的地方。
但是
重做的 UI 完全没有初版的感觉
完全去除了任务中的Peak，改为了任务中解锁，生存模式中使用，同时任务的每一关的长度降低了不少，20分钟玩通一大关（我知道可以在隐藏菜单里调出Peak，但是如此隐蔽的方式意味着开发者根本没打算把他开放）
Peak其他方面的修改也大多不怎么合适，比如 Telekinisis 简直是在逗我，原来的鼠标悬停使用哪里不好了？为啥要变成磁铁？还会自动换武器，简直坑爹啊
有了多人合作，但是只有本地合作……你一定是在逗我

总体上来说，生存模式变得比之前稍稍有趣了一些，但是，任务模式的可玩性大大降低，并不是所有人都把生存模式当作主要模式的，比如我。

Basically a classic 2D, top down shooter with multiple game modes.

For quest, there is varying arenas of difficulty, with different challenges and enemy combinations to overcome. There's not really a story to quest mode other than ""Shoot 'em all!"", which is good enough for me!

There are also several different kinds of survival modes, including seeing how long you can last without a gun.

Fallout may have popularized Perks in games, but Crimsonland was the first to bring it to shooters, which is probably one of the things that makes it such a great game. The massive amount of guns combined with numerious perk combos ensures you never get the same game twice.

And if you like secrets, there are several of those scattered around as well. ;)

This game is about destroying aliens, critters and other vermin. You move around the map, which is basically your screen, and have to shoot lots and lots of enemies while picking up perks, weapons, ammo, upgrades and dodging your enemies and bullets. 

Graphics and sound is ok, controls are ok and tuned well to this kind of gameplay. Levels and missions are a bit dull.

The game strongly reminds me of Red Nation, which has zombies instead of these guys and is imo slightly better tuned and balanced.

I played a hell out of it and I think it is safe to say that story only begins after the campaign has been finished. Survival is addicting as it only can be.

Before you'll read the rest of the review please bare in mind, that I like this game, so don't get too negative image from upcoming sentences. It's just thera are some problems that will start bothering you after 15+ hours in the agme. If you don't intend to play that long, stop reading and just buy it, especially for local coop.

Unfortunately game tends to be a bit annoying. After a while, I know which guns and perks will work and which will not. Since it is all random it may (and it repeatedly will!) screw you over. I'd like to explore more exotic guns and perks combinations, but the game simpli will not let me - because it is all random.

In the end I was hoping for a little bit more - like a mode with a bit of control over gun drop, or mechanic (perk?) that would allow it. Also, I think there should be sandbox mode since a lot of perks are not well described and also a lot of stuff doesn't work together at all (e.g. rockets don't seem to apply the poison bullet effect).

The game has all the elements to be a good twinstick shooter, but it's just lacking balance. The game itself is split up into questmode where you have to earn all your perks and guns.. Somewhat of a lazy way of lengthening the game lifetime, instead of actually focusing on the game modes themselves.
Once you've got all the guns and perks, you're all set! ..right? No..

The survival mode is much like the quest mode, in that there's an red thread going through most of the game. Being that there are hives spawning all across the board, and you've got to clear them out, else you'll be swarmed and die..
And the guns are just a major lackluster.. There's so many useless weapons, as in slow as **** to reload, or not a big enough clip.  So what this basically forces you to do is to start whichever level and gamemode you're on, until you get a gun that's decent enough.

But the red thread is impossible to avoid, and it'll catch up to you no matter what. And that's fine! It's just not fine when it happens in a matter of 5-7 mins.. No matter what! The hives constantly pour out more and more mobs, and eventually they overrun your pathetic little person.. and then you die. And this happens over and over again, really not differentiating the way in which you die. You always die of being overrun, about 5-7 mins into a game.
It almost feels like the game is forcing you to play it with 1 to 3 other people, completely killing the singleplayer experience.

So the AI mechanics are disapointing, the weapons are mostly disapointing.. What about the perks then? Surely they are the saving grace? Nope..
The perks are plentiful and very helpful (obviously), but they're as cryptic as hell. They pretty much all have lengthy descriptions and tryhard humor on them, and doesn't really help you get the right upgrade in the heat of battle.. Instead you have to pause, break immersion and ponder WTF this actually does to your character. And a lot of them are just plain stupid, like instantkilling you for a better ""score""... Yeah, that's helpful! ""Gotta get those points!"" :P

All in all, the game isn't horrible, as it's got all the right elements and the right idea.. The execution just doesn't seem that well thought out. It doesn't seem tested enough somehow. It's very short lived and anticlimactic when you've died for the 30th time to the same damn problem.
It just makes me want to play Nation Red instead.. Maybe not a fair comparison as this is an indie dev and all, but that's like saying ""don't judge an Early Access game as a complete game"". It's in the same genre, so I'm gonna.

So yeah, if you want a real solid twinstick shooter, try Nation Red.. Atleast they got it right and let's you play for more than 5 mins at a time. The game has a lot going for it, but it doesn't seem like it's ever going to change. Can't really recommend it at all, for more than a 3-4 hr fun time-killer. It doens't really have much replayability once you've gotten all the unlocks really.. hard difficulty is fine, but impossible is not.

Для меня, как и для многих тогда, игра была условно бесплатной. В то время диск с сотней казуальных и аркадных развлечений стоил около ста рублей. И среди разных вариаций тетриса, арканоида и зумы, мне посчастливилось наткнуться на игру, которая нещадно высасывала мое время, которое я должен был тратить на выполнение домашней работы.

Десять лет я ждал перезапуска игры. За это время я успел закончить школу, заняться первым нелепым подростковым сексом и даже немного определиться в жизни. И вот, в 2013 году, на площадке Steam Greenlight появилась страничка долгожданной игры. А еще через год я начал проводить ночи, не смыкая глаз и прорубаясь через орды пауков, зомби, ящериц, инопланетян и непонятно-кого-еще.

Сама по себе, игра не привносит каких-то особенных техник или необычного геймплея. Это обычный 2D-шутер с видом сверху, где все, что требуется от игрока - бегать и стрелять под тяжелую музыку. Монстры респаунятся всегда в одних и тех же местах, и проходя один и тот же уровен в сотый раз, вы будете знать, в какое время и на каком участке появится медлительные зомби, а в каком смертоносные маленькие красные крабы, но эти знания никак не спасут вас он неминуемой гибели.

Хардкорность в Crimsonland такая же вымышленная и бессмысленная, как в Dark Souls. То есть без нее вполне можно было бы обойтись, но тогда у игры не было бы фанатов. И это развлечение вряд ли увлекло кого-нибудь больше, чем на один вечер.

Итак, вкратце о сюжете - его нет. Ну то есть вообще нет никакого сюжета. Вы - человек, который должен отстреливаться от орд монстров и это никак не объясняется. Непонятно на своей ли вы планете или на чужой. Непонятно откуда эти монстры взялись. А с кем вы сражаетесь можно только догадываться, если читать названия уровней. И эта бессюжетность - она просто идеально вписывается в игру. Думаю, что именно сюжет погубил серию Serious Sam. Я серьезно.

Игра в обычном режиме представляет из себя шесть глав, в каждой по десять ""квестов"". Суть каждого квеста заключается в уничтожении всего, что может двигаться. По ходу прохождения, вы будете открывать новое оружие, новые перки, новые уровни для игры на выживание (ну и если мамка дала денег на лицуху в стиме, то и ачивки).

Но в режиме квестов вы не почувствуете всю боль, которую разработчики приготовили для хардкорных игроков. Даже уровень сложности Grim (самый высокий) не сравнится с игрой в режиме выживания.

Только в режиме выживания у вас получится воспользоваться перками. В Crimsonland перк - это аналог пассивных умений из RPG. Перки бывают разной упоротости от урановых пуль и пироманьячности (когда вы обжигаете врагов, находящихся в интимной близости) и до неотвратимой смерти через 30 секунд, но зато очков заработаете вдвое больше.

Режимов выживания четыре штуки. В классическом (survival) вы просто убиваете монстров, меняете оружие, набираете опыт, начиняете своего бойца перками и так, пока персонаж не погибнет. А в режиме выживания он обязательно погибнет. Rush-режим ограничивает нас одним типом оружия - штурмовой винтовкой, в остальном он схож с survival. Weapon Picker предоставляет нам невероятно много оружия на карте, но с одним условием: одна пушка - одна обойма. Закончились патроны? Ищи новое оружи или умри. Nukefism вообще лишает нас оружия. единственный способ уничтожить врагов - подбирать Nuke-бонусы, которые взрывают противников в небольшом радиусе от игрока. Ну и blitz - это survival на повышенных скоростях.

В версии 2003 года был режим выживания, когда игрок стоял на месте, а на него шли монстры с именами. Чтобы убить монстра необходимо было ввести его имя. Но, видимо, из-за выхода игры на консолях, от этого режима пришлось отказаться. Зато теперь мы можем играть на геймпаде и в кооперативе до четырех человек.

Эта игра подойдет, владелецам консолей, у которых много друзей, а спортивные симуляторы поднадоели. Или если вы одинокий гик, чурающийся всего живого, и страдающий от недостатка хардкорных игр.

Which in my opinion is the only mode you should play. I'll leave the review as is other than some rewording and change the negative to a positive since they DO allow you to play the classic version which is still super fun. 
However my opinion on modern mode still stands since after playing it recently again, not too much has been fixed. It still gets hard way too fast and doesn't let you really enjoy it too much. However thanks a lot to 10Tons for reaching out and attempting to fill the gap with the classic version.

The modern version of this game has a lot going for it...but not enough.


Lets start with the positives:

I love the updated graphics, the new perks, the more streamlined leveling system, the ability to have four players at once, and many other details about this reboot of the classic crimsonland. Killing enemies is as fun as ever and almost every weapon is great and feels good for different situations (except you blowtorch!) and has a legitimate strategy. Perks are incredibly important and add a deep aspect of thought to the game (Do I get regeneration to keep my health up or choose fast reloader so I can kill enemies more?) and the sheer addictive nature of the gameplay will keep you hooked. Its a solid title...or should be...

Which leads me to the negatives:

Outside of the story mode this game isn't really as fun as it used to be. They took out a lot of things that made it fun. In solo survival the average player can expect to get to level 8-9 if they get a decent weapon before being absolutely annihilated by the hordes of enemies. If you add friends to the mix the difficulty ramps up even more and you will be lucky if you clear level 6. Its almost a broken level of hard. Theres no fighting it. No matter which perks you pick or which weapons you have the survival mode reaches a certain point early on that just immediately kills you. 

Your choices feel useless and it becomes kind of a drag when you get the perfect weapon combo with the perfect perks and then you just get slaughtered anyways by the sudden wave of splitting spiders and zombie lords that surround you out of thin air instead of coming out of the sides of the screen like they used to. The previous version of crimsonland slowly spiked the difficulty more and more making the survival last longer. It really felt like you were, you know, surviving? 

This version of crimsonland has no such subtlety or flair. They let you gain a couple levels and then just murder you outright with a frustrating amount of enemies that are impossible to fight. Let me put it to you this way. I was the 3rd highest ranking player IN THE WORLD in the previous crimsonland but in this one I can barely top level 10 in solo survival. They have taken one of the greatest and most fun modes of the game and just smashed it and made it unplayable. If they had a difficulty choice I think it could mitigate this. This is the only game I think actually NEEDS an easy mode.

Another thing that is absolutely broken in this game is the enemy spawning system. In the previous crimsonland enemies came out of all 4 sides of the screen giving you a chance to plan ahead. You could see a horde of zombies and decide which way you want to bait them to try and get an opening to dive for that powerup or weapon. You can find the big monster that is spawning little ones and put that sucker down before he overwhelms you.

This crimsonland has destroyed that too. It is quite common now to have enemies spawn on top of you and immediately kill you. Nothing sucks worse than to be 10 minutes into a boss battle and to be killed by a horde of tiny red aliens spawning right on top of you. Or to be doing a survival round with your favorite weapon and perks and to have a lizard king spawn right next to you and one shot you instantly. Its painfully frustrating and can make you want to chuck your keyboard across the room. It has happened to me in almost every mission of this game and is the most common way to die. Some enemies still come out of the sides of the screen, but more than half of them just appear with a flash wherever they feel like regardless of how inconvient it is for you.

So in conclusion, the game is fun but ultimately frustrating and not worth your money. They could have had a solid remake of a fun arcade shooter on their hands but they've instead destroyed it by breaking the difficulty and spawning and made it virtually unplayable. If you do buy this game, you'll discover its fun palls rather quickly because of its major stumbling blocks. It is a shadow of its former self and if you want to play a fun arcade shooter, ONLY play the classic version of this game and ignore the inferior modern mode.

Play the classic mode. That part is fun, but skip the modern version. Its just not fun anymore.",1413017737,1597441373,True,1,0,0.512256145477294922,8,True,False,False,False,,,

However, there were some really badly missed opportunities with this game. For example, can somebody please explain why in the hell you earn buffs (faster reload, faster running speed, increased damage, increased xp gain, increased power-up drops etc.) if you can never activate any of them in the quest game mode. Who cares if you can use them in survival mode, I want to beat all the levels on every difficulty setting, but, quite frankly, without being able to use a buff or two, beating many of those levels once you get to Hardcore and beyond depends entirely on what your first weapon drop is. By the time a second weapon drops so many baddies have spawned that getting to a specific spot is next to impossible, you're just in full on kite mode. Not only that but your character moves slower than many of the enemies and is slowed briefly by taking damage, meaning one hit equals death in most cases because the brief pause allows the hoard to overtake you. Perfect time to activate the faster run buff you unlocked, but no, it's worthless. C'mon guys, with a few minor adjustments, this could be a real good time.

1) I do recommend this game. But it's not a very strong recommendation. 
2) My decision to purchase was largely nostalgia-driven. 

Those two caveats disclosed, my review is relatively simple. This is a fun top-down shooter that is a bit stuck in the past. It's a game that for me, back in 2003, was a pretty big deal for something that today would fall into a much more competitive indie genre. The basic premise is: you're a guy, you run around in circles, you shoot things and they bleed. Eventually you're going to die, but along the way you can level up to gain perks which propels the arcadey gameplay.

The game is effectively untouched except in superficial, and relatively inconsequential ways. It really needs much more than that to be anything but a game people like me are willing to purchase because they have fond memories of playing. You can use modern resolutions now! The UI is updated (but it's bland)! But that's about it. Effectively, this is a PC game from 2003 ported to a PC platform of 2014.

The gameplay is still fun. But the asking price, and the lack of change and balance to the game over the course of a decade is unlikely to bring in much of an audience beyond people who played Crimsonland prior to its launch on Steam.

I wanted very much to see some new game modes, some new weapons, some new perks, some new something. But really, I have the same game on a new computer with a new UI. Pretty unimpressive.

On sale, this game is worth the time and money I think. Though it's very hard to make the case for something old that isn't doing much to take advantage of a huge sea change in what a game can be, and what the PC platform is able to do. I was happy to buy the game hoping against hope that maybe some additional content will be added, or Steam Workshop integration will come along. Though I doubt that is likely, and I doubt you'll feel as nicely as I do about this game, I think you can still have a good weekend's worth of fun if you give it a shot.",1412017253,1412017394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Хотелось чего-то нового, но в реалиях этой игры, поэтому мне и захотелось поиграть в ремейк. 
Я помню те времена, когда в кримсе было только четыре главы и по-настоящему хардкорным считалось пройти 4.10 на второй сложности. Помню времена, когда небезызвестный русский сайт публиковал свои рекорды на время, поскольку в онлайн-таблице было много читеров, а результаты с отрицательным временем, как, например, в 2.10 (видела я там рекорд с ракетной батареей в -52 секунды, и это было круто, я вам доложу), игра попросту не учитывала в качестве рекорда.
И этот кримс совершенно не такой. Начать стоит хотя бы с того, что система перков претерпела значительные изменения. Дело даже не в том, что перки в кампании теперь включается с помощью спецкода (хотя, надо признать, и в этом тоже), а в том, что они теперь сродни обязаловке. Чуть только происходит повышение - и повышаться необходимо. То есть, фишка старой версии с экономией 1 перк=1 секунда, больше не котируется. На этой системе перков была завязана основная фишка - дружеское (и не обязательно дружеское) соперничество, присущее игре, когда, к пример, лишним неиспользуемым перком по времени выигрывался уровень, скажем, 2.8, с гнёздами. 
Сюрвайвал претерпел похожие изменения и стал куда более сложен (быть может, дело просто в изменённой системе начисления очков). Это не тот плюс, которого ждали от игры, поскольку после определённой отметки жить в сюре можно было только за счёт удачно подобранных бонусов и правильной экипировки (оружие+перки на него). Жизненно важный телекинез стал полным отстоем, рассчитанным, видимо, на консольную версию и просто подтягивающим любые (даже нафиг не нужные) бонусы прямиком к вам. Выпала газовая горелка, когда у вас в руках плазмошотган, джекхаммер или разделитель? Это никого не интересует - либо берите, либо убегайте от бонуса, кусаемые толпами мобов. 
Многие полезные перки и связанные с ними баги, пофиксили. Это фикс, к примеру, с ракетной батареей и столь любимая игроками связка Pulse Gun + Angry Reloader. 
Сюжетка приобрела одну новую главу (по сравнению с последним обновлением), которую сделали пятой, а бывшую пятую оттеснили на место шестой (было бы странно, если бы 6.10 по эпичности хоть что-то превзошло). 
На деле же получается, что сюжетку на всех уровнях сложности (если включить перки с помощью ""grim"") можно пройти за пару дней, ещё пару дней поиграть в сюр и другие режимы, попутно обалдевая с количества читерастов в таблицах. В итоге - совершенно не то, что было раньше. Что понравилось мне - так это лишняя глава сюжетки, да новое оружие вроде гаусс-минигана. 
В целом, конечно, нельзя сказать однозначно, что игру испортили. Оказуаливают сейчас многие игры, но вот то, что под раздачу попал и любимый когда-то игроками Crimsonland - печально.",1411877176,1412146746,False,8,0,0.530629754066467285,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Сразу скажу, что играл в классическую версию много лет назад, и купил эту игру в Steam сразу же, как только увидел её. И не пожалел.

Толпы монстров набегают со всех сторон, никаких укрытий и регенерации. Во время игры из монстров падает случайное оружие, с которым приходится провести большую часть времени на уровне. Это сильно увеличивает реиграбельность игры из-за того, что каждое прохождение не похоже на предыдущее, каждый раз другая тактика. Бывает, что выпадает какая-нибудь пукалка и бегаешь с надеждой, что скоро выпадет другое оружие.

Правда, в режиме квеста не хватает перков, которые были в классической игре. Они вносили ещё больше разнообразия и всегда были случайными. Здесь они тоже есть, но только в режимах выживания. Перки дают игроку уникальные способности типа лазерного прицела к оружию или возможности убить всех монстров на карте, если сам умер.

Отличная игра для рабочего места, так как не требует глубокого погружения и достаточно легко играется, при этом имея отличную реиграбельность и доставляя массу удовольствия от убийства каждого монстра.",1411730797,1411730797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Weakness
- Some issues has bugged like game crashed when started
- Monster Vision removed, let 3.4 Hidden Evil is almost impossible to No-Damage clear
- Friendly Fire cannot set in option, must customize by GRIM
- 1st quarter set of weapons is too useless when against final chapter but frequently dropped

+ Plays with both mouse & keyboard and Xinput (360) controllers.
+ Includes 2-4 player co-op.

CONS:
- No online multiplayer...yet.

You have good arsenal of weaponry at you disposal. Different mods of firearms, flamethrowers, plasma-ion-gauss toys, rocket launchers and some other weirdness. Most of them are quite playable and offer unique experience, but, some just really bad and get you killed very quickly :)

Enemies are not too diverse in form and even less then that in essence, but hey, they come in different colors !!! Nevertheless, while number of enemies will usually be your biggest concern, towards some of them you'll develop quite special feelings ...

And also there are powerups, popping-up all over the place. Not too important at first, but later, picking them up in right order (or just being lucky) is pretty much the only way to finish a campaign level.

Before you'll read the rest of the review please bare in mind, that I like this game, so don't get too negative image from upcoming sentences. It's just thera are some problems that will start bothering you after 15+ hours in the agme. If you don't intend to play that long, stop reading and just buy it, especially for local coop.
 
Unfortunately game tends to be a bit annoying. After a while, I know which guns and perks will work and which will not. Since it is all random it may (and it repeatedly will!) screw you over. I'd like to explore more exotic guns and perks combinations, but the game simpli will not let me - because it is all random.

In the end I was hoping for a little bit more - like a mode with a bit of control over gun drop, or mechanic (perk?) that would allow it. Also, I think there should be sandbox mode since a lot of perks are not well described and also a lot of stuff doesn't work together at all (e.g. rockets don't seem to apply the poison bullet effect).

Overall, I think the game is great, but longevity is crippled by lack of improvements compared to the original game.",1408281699,1408281699,True,4,0,0.523421287536621094,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Obviously, I was quite hyped when I heard about the updated version on Steam. And I have to say that I am quite disappointed with it. 

The HD graphics are just... meh. Sure, it is in high resolution, and new level backgrounds look nice, but everything else looks like garbage from year 2000. Really, the old version just had better overall design. The new monster graphics are ugly, the weapon icons are beyond any recognition, and the new UI is not just ugly, but it is also less usable. It is virtually impossible to determine how much of your Shield is left when surrounded by enemies, and it is also very hard to determine the exact time left in reloading (why not just leave the clear and accurate ""clock"" from the old version?).

The game is now released on many platforms. Usually, there is nothing wrong with that, but for Crimsonland it meant that some content was removed because it was unusable on consoles. I really miss the Typ'o'Shooter mode, and some perks like Pyrokinetic and Evil Eyes. 
Speaking of perks: the new Telekinetic is just garbage. Instead of allowing you to hover the crosshair over the powerup and wait for a few seconds, ALL powerups are now gravitated towards you even when you really don't need that. Ever wanted to lose the game because a mysterious force made you pick up the Blowtorch? Well, now you can. Say thanks for consoles for one more butchered PC game.
I was also really disappointed by having perks disabled in Quests mode by default. Sure, one can say it is more challenging that way, but I've always perceived Quests as an extended tutorial for Survival mode, where player unlocks the perks and tries them out. Without the perks, the difficulty becomes just absurd on Grim, and the luck factor starts to account on your success way more that your skill. Why not just make an achievement for finishing the game without the perks? I believe that'd have been the best of both worlds for both hardcore and usual gamers. 

Some quite significant changes to the game balance were also made. And while I appreciate the new way Fire Bullets powerup works, I will never understand why rockets weapons are THAT powerful now, and why the almighty Splitter Gun is reduced to a useless garbage when compared to the old one. Still, the balance is better than it was in general, I think.

I really dislike new Survival mode. You can barely get 6-9 levels if you are really good (and lucky), and that really limits your chances of survival. The game session is also much shorter now, as monsters gain power and health much quicker than before. I miss the old epic 1+ hour battles.

Online highscores are implemented really well and provide a lot of additional info that helps to identify cheaters.

In conclusion, Crimsonland is still a fun game. Not as fun as the old version for me, but if you are new to Crimsonland - just wait for the sale and go grab it.",1407963322,1407965407,True,5,0,0.543985843658447266,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Так же, поменялась анимация монстров. Инопланетяне теперь выглядят ну настолько убого, что аж играть не хочется.

Une seule arène (avec tout de même quelques variations de couleur), assez peu d’ennemis différents et un personnage au déplacement bien trop lent pour ce type de jeu, on pourrait penser que Crimsonland était un échec total.

Pourtant, une fois les premières heures d’ennui passées (ou les nombreuses pour les fous furieux qui voudraient boucler le mode principal dans les trois difficultés différentes), il faut bien avouer que les cinq modes survie sont variés et addictifs ! Le système de perks est réellement amusant et permet de jouer encore et encore sans avoir l’impression de faire deux fois de suite la même partie. Les armes sont très variées et le mode multi jusqu’à quatre est génial.

Брать только по скидке.

Если вы вдруг никогда не слышали, то Crimsonland - это игра про то, как в одиночку вы убиваете сотни и тысячи жуков, ящериц, пришельцев, пауков и т.п. Игровой процесс прост, но крайне затягивает. Игра вышла в 2002 году, регулярно патчилась на предмет исправления ошибок (причем некоторые игроки даже оставались на старых версиях из-за личных предпочтений), стала довольно известной благодаря тому, что никто ее нормально не смог склонировать, хотя были самые разные попытки, вплоть до вариантов от первого лица. Пожалуй, лучшим подражателем стал Nation Red, который благодаря многолетней (!) поддержке до сих пор актуален и куда более продуман. И вот, в 2014 году игру переиздают в стиме, обещая минимум исправлений, отличный способ легализовать свое пиратское детство, а?

Плюсы: основу игры, к счастью, не изменили, мы все так же весело носимся по уровням, собирая оружие и перки (по умолчанию только в выживаниях, авторы решили что надо проходить сюжетку без них). Особых багов не замечено, отрисовано неплохо, есть энциклопедия перков и оружия, добавлены достижения, глобальные доски почета. Теперь при повышении уровня монстров отодвигают, а нам дают ""щит"". Телекинез работает автоматически и притягивает самостоятельно ближайший бонус (это и минус). Есть возможность играть вчетвером. Splitter Gun теперь не убивает игрока, угол разлета пуль поменяли в меньшую сторону.

Минусы: новые перки полная хрень и скорее вредят. Проходить одиночную компанию без перков на нормале интересно, но дальше это какой-то мрак, хорошо хоть это отключаемо. Разделение бонусного урона на огненные пули и плазменные сильно напрягает, т.к. последние едва ли что-то дают на поздней стадии в выживании. Перки теперь выдают ОЧЕНЬ редко, если раньше вы их могли набрать штук 15 в среднем, то теперь хорошо если доберетесь до 7-8. При повышении уровня теперь нельзя его отложить. Телекинез стал бесполезен в угоду консольщикам с их геймпадами. Новые игровые режимы какой-то унылый шлак - выживание только путем подбора бонусов? Пушек с ограниченным боезапасом? Даже раш с калашом остался в неизменном виде, после одного раунда в нем вы скорее всего больше никогда не запустите. Достижения делятся на элементарные и неадекватно сложные - набрать 50к очков в том же раше получится у тех, кто задрочит уровень и поймет единственный путь к этому. Другие режимы вроде nukefism вообще не имеют ничего общего с игровым опытом и зависят целиком и полностью от удачи. Наконец, разработчики даже не попытались балансировать геймплей, оставляя в игре самый раздражающий вид врагов - делящихся пауков, которые сожрут ваши нервы 2 раза за всю игру. И пройти их по-прежнему можно только с одним-двумя видами оружия. Игровой экран теперь специально немного уменьшен ради того, чтобы вы брали перк Eagle Eye, после которого все возвращается в норму. Издевательство. Кооп работает только локально, не через интернет. А ведь на дворе 2014 год, игра работает через стим, но разработчики даже поддержку Steam Cloud не добавили в игру!

このゲームに対する率直な感想がコレ。

良い点
・豊富な武器
・基本的なスコアアタックから、リロード不可、武器使用不可等の多様なスコアアタックを実装
・余計なストーリー等が一切ない、アーケード感覚なゲーム性

悪い点
・プレイヤーの足が遅く、簡単に敵に喰われる、加えてボーナスアイテムも取れない
・ボーナスアイテムが敵の集団に飲み込まれるため取得が非常に困難
・終盤はボーナスアイテム頼みのゲーム性
・豊富な武器→産廃武器が豊富になり、第一ドロップ武器によってはリセット必須
・豊富な敵→大量の敵を薙ぎ倒す本ゲームにそぐわない特殊能力持ちが増えた
・グラフィックが十年前から進化していない

プレイ最初は、十年前に良く遊んだゲームのリメイクという事もあり楽しめたが
敵の攻撃が熾烈になる終盤になってきたあたりから、コレジャナイ感が漂い始めた。
見下し型のガンシューターの中でも高品質だとは思うが、要調整な面が数多く残されているように思う。
特に、武器面に関しては種類の豊富さを押す割にはバランスが悪く、使える武器は実質5個あるかないかだろう。

ちょっとした暇つぶしとして遊ぶ分にはお薦めできる。

В году 2005 играл в нее и сходил с ума от шикарного сочетания геймплея, музыки, прокачки и стиля игры. И за проведенное время в стиме не раз юзал поиск в надежде увидеть и приобрести ее в коллекцию.

И вот свершилось! Она тут!
Собсн первое что смутило, это цена. Не дoхpенa ли за игру 10 летней давности? :-\
Ну да ладно, это же мать твою Crimsonland! В нее ибaшилa даже твоя бабушка попивая чай с сушками.

В общем намутил, запустил и-и-и... сразу видно что меню изменилось, царские режимы не доступны, надо начинать с первой главы, поехали!

Старт первой миссии и вижу что новый дизайн реально не круче прошлого. Какой-то он детский что ли, все гейски гладенькое, камера расположена близко, не то в общем... Стоп! Что за йхуня! Где перки в миссиях!?
Что бялть за! Почему я не могу с любимого джекхамера(+огненные пули) устроить чистилище на экране?!
И тут я наступают разочарования . :-(

Окей, ведь режим выживания все любят, я бялть до момента запуска тоже любил. Но что за деpьмo меня там ожидало?! Любимый перк ""телекинетик"" обоcpали, и теперь он притягивает бонусы вместе с ненужными... Тут я уже начал ругаться матом...
Мало того что перки нельзя юзать в квестах, так еще и в выживании тебе их надо обязательно выбирать при LevelUp, а выше 7 левела набить уже реально сложно. Жизнь боль короче...

Так а что тут нового в итоге!?

ОБОCPАTЬСЯ!!!ЭТО ЖЕ РАССЕЛ КРОУ!!!!

Новые режимы, кооператив и ачивки?!  пф... тот геймплей который я любил, попросту испоганен.
По факту, данная версия не стоит своих денег!


P.S. Можете сказать что я не прав и это классная игра бла бла бла... Но мне есть с чем сравнивать, я как и другие фанаты, провел времени в этой игре больше чем за просмотром пoрнo. Короче знаю о чем говорю.

Раньше - к 1000000 очков у вас однозначно были все эти перки + ещё несколько непринципиальных.
Теперь - игра заканчивается на отметке 250000, если у вас нет именно этой комбинации перков. При этом это соответствует 6 уровню, то есть рандомно дающиеся перки должны идеально выпадать при получении уровней. Шанс, что у вас будует на 6 уровне имеено нужные шесть перков из 40 представленных близок к нулю. А ещё должно быть оружие, представленное всего двумя экземплярами.

Краткая выжимка.
Плюсы:
- графику подтянули
- ввели новые режимы
- ввели достижения
- ввели глобальную статистику
- разработчики охотно идут на контакт и продолжают трудится
Минусы:
- новый интерфейс сделан с учетом кроссплатформенности и довольно аляповат на PC
- за привычный взгляд с высоты птичьего полета теперь отвечает перк
- телепорт сделан в угоду планшетам
- в survival опыт копится медленнее чем в оригинале. Можно забыть про предыдущие подвиги, ведь все очень быстро, перков мало, ты обязательно умрешь.
- нет статистики по миссиям. Побить рекорды друзей в краткой схватке, выработать идеальную стратегию прохождения и урвать пару милисекунд - все в прошлом.
- перки в миссиях включаются через код. Я конечно видел прохождение 6.10 на грим без перков, но это слишком сложно. Один шанс на тысячи траев. Никакого удовольствия.

Список минусов больше списка плюсов, но игру мне это пройти не помешало. И получтить все достижения тоже. Хороший челлендж с прохождением всех уровней без ущерба - это интересно и запоминается.

Обещают таки ввести более классический survival с быстрым опытом, множеством перков, позволить выбирать начлаьное оружие как в nation red. В такой режим я бы мог играть чисто ради удовольствия и бОльшего количества очков. В текущий survival - нет. Слишком много бесполезных рестартов.

А пока я ставлю свой личный кубок на полку и переключаюсь на другие вещи.

Оценка: ★★★☆☆

Впечатление от нового ремейка Crimsonland 2014:

Как бывший поклонник этой замечательной аркадной стрелялки вышедшей еще в далеком 2003 году, я не могу пройти мимо этого современного ремейка. Почти сразу же взял ее в стиме даже особо не вдаваясь в подробности новшеств, а жаль...Мой некогда любимый кримс претерпел не самые приятные изменения. Все, за что я любил эту игру, разрабы, мягко говоря, пересмотрели. Теперь сурвайвалов аж два, но толку, если в них живешь не более 5ти минут, добавили пару идиотских режимов типа ""схвати перк"" и ""схвати оружие"", имхо, старый Type'o'shooter был даже интереснее. Карту увеличили и что бы ее подогнать под нормальный размер нужно взять соответствующий перк. Плодящихся спайдеройдов теперь нужно ебурить как рейд босса, серьезно, я финальный уровень быстрей прошел в квестах чем этих долбаных спайдеройдов. 
Плюсы конечно есть, но они скорее для ньюфагов которые впервые будут знакомиться с этой игрой, олдфагам же стоит пройти мимо.
Из плюсов могу отметить то что особо не тронули квесты (разве что убрали из них перки, которые, слава яйцам, включаются через небольшой чит в меню, если бы и чита не было, то это был бы полный провал), это, пожалуй, единственное ради чего я купил эту игру, так как сурвайвал меня вообще не интересует, чтобы в него пошпилить, я лучше запущу старый кримс. Да, визуально все стало симпотишнее, но опять же, непонятны здоровенные менюшки которые адаптированы под экран телефона чтоли? Да, добавили кооп, но почему бы не прикрутить к игре сетевой движок и сделать этот кооп не ""за одним компом"", а через сеть? Игра требует кооперативного безумия!

Хочу ремастер, а не ремейк, короче говоря. Баланса ради поставлю палец вниз.",1404398292,1668799331,False,76,5,0.636685609817504883,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay lengh: 7 hours to finish the 120 main quests but otherwise as long as you want - It doesn't have a story, or even any purpose other than to rack up points during late game. It's much more of an arcade focused game akin to very early 90's arcade games of this kind.
Required skill level: medium
SPECIAL WARNING: As already shown in the screenshots on the storepage this game includes [i]Spiders[/i] and a lot of them in various sizes and shapes and from there it even get worse. You should refrain from playing this game if you suffer from arachnophobia.

[h1]About this game[/h1]
There we have it, the amazing game [i]Crimsonland[/i]. I still remember this game as a Freeware title in 2001 before it turned into shareware. And wow, the game inproved massively over the course of 13 years. This game was inspired by the, back then, famous game ""Phobia II"" in 1998, which in turn is very similar to the game [i]Threat[/i] in 1995 and [i]Smash TV[/i] in 1990, but Crimsonland made this subgenre of frantic top down shooting popular and very well deserved so. Unfortunatly I forgot about it after 2007 and thought it would never see the light of day again. Until recently...

So what is it all about? It's really simple to explain. You are a [b]Manly Space Marine[/b] with the important mission to kill various types of [i]Aliens[/i], [i]Zombies[/i] and [i]Bugs[/i]. It sounds like childish fun on paper and thats exactly what it is. It's called Crimsonland because you basically paint the ground blood-red from pulverizing anything that shows up on screen. That basically sums up everything you need to know.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The core gameplay for this game is very simple. You control a soldier from a very retro-esque top down perspective via the WASD layout and aim and shoot monsters for score. Sometimes, monsters drop power-ups, which you can choose to pick up, or not as you need to conserve them while they're on the ground in order to get the fullest potential out of any of them. Having a strategy on how to progress properly is essential in this game so besides blasting Aliens it requires some forsight and mental preperation of things to come. Often your chances of survival your way to the power-up itself so you can pick it up isn't even big as the ever coming monster waves keep you occupied otherwise.

Two of the basic main game modes are a [i]Quest mode[/i], which provides the Player with a set of ""Missions"" where the term only is used in the loosest of senses as the only thing you have to do in each mission is to kill a specific set of monsters until the bar of the upper side of the screen is filled out. It gets interesting however if you like to survive the round without taking a hit since the game at least acknowledges it so you can honor your skills with this game.

Being good at [b]Crimsonland[/b] gets rewarded with a star and an achievement for survivng all normal missions and this game has some of the most difficult to get achievements I've seen yet, apart from [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/65300/]Dustforce[/url]. As it requires a lot of partience to be rewarding, only the most hardcore of players may ever see one of the more difficult to get achievements. By completing missions you can unlock new Weapons, perks and Game Modes.

The other mode is something that gets unlocked during the first few missions and that is the [i]Survival Mode[/i]. Survival mode is the Flesh and Bones of this entire game as this is the game mode where you can get level ups to attain the perks you previously unlocked in the Quest Mode. There is a very well structured On-Line Scoreboard so if you feel competitive you can always try to reach the Top 100. 

[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]
To get straight to the point the graphics feel a little bit dated but I do believe that in this case it seem appropriate given the age of the game of it and how fluid the gameplay is. In terms of art direction I say that it all feels very pleasant to the eyes, as you can already tell from the pictures on the Steamstore for this game.

In terms of sound effects this game feels a little bit lackluster and is the worst thing this game has to offer regarding everything else [i]Crimsonland[/i] as to offer. Shooting your guns doesn't feel as strong as it should in my opinion and even launching a nuke doesn't feel as good as it should be. However I believe that the Music is pretty spot on given the gameplay as shooting up monsters and Metal seem to go hand in hand with carnage-themed games since Doom 1.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I believe that this game is a fine example on how gameplay throughout the simplier ages of video game design [i](think about Smash TV or Robotron)[/i] can still be this refreshing. Sometimes you just want to shoot some monsters and rack up points with not much else. So if you believe that it's the game for you I hereby highly recommend that you should pick it up even if it isn't on a sale right now, as this is one of the genres finest.

Десятки раз пробегал кампанию на хардкоре, потратил кучу времени в режиме выживания. Это была одна из моих любимых игр. Когда я увидел ее в Steam, обрадовался неимоверно. Купил. Ну... признаться, я в печали.
Да, суть осталась та же самая. Бегаем, отстреливаемся от толп пауков, зомби и прочей злобной фауны. Даже звуки остались те же, что и в оригинальной версии. Любителям веселого мясца должно понравиться. Но это не тот Crimsonland, что был раньше.

Начну с плюсов, наверное. Благо, их мало, много времени не займет.
 + Похорошевшая картинка. Не хит, конечно, но модельки монстров стали выглядеть чуть более внятно.
 + Улучшилась эргономичность игровых менюшек. Получили уровень - извольте, вот вам на выбор 4-5 картинок с описанием. Все оружие и разблокированные бонусы помещены в аккуратненькую табличку. Пустячок, а приятно.

На этом и все, пожалуй. Ну, или я недостаточно глубоко погрузился в обновленную игровую механику.

Теперь минусы:
 - Играя в кампанию, мы больше не получаем опыт. Соответственно, не улучшаем персонажа. Ну ничего себе, праздник. Кто это придумал, интересно? Лично мне эти самые перки львиную долю радости от геймплея и доставляли. Сначала подумал, может, так только на легком уровне сложности? Ведь действительно легко. Ан нет(
 - Слегка изменилось поведение некоторых перков. Стоит схватить телекинез, и окружающие предметы начинают медленно ползти в нашу сторону. И на кой черт он такой нужен? Ведь телекинез тем и был полезен, что можно было из тыла врага всякие ништячки выхватывать. А сейчас - появился в толпе бонус, и что? Ты от толпы как раз бежишь, а бонус еле плетется за тобой, пока не исчезнет. Потрясающе. Плюсом к этому, нужно еще как-то убегать от неугодных видов оружия, которые тоже начинают свое неспешное преследование. Бред.
 - Один исходный вид выживания разделился на пять подвидов. С одной стороны, круто! С другой - играбельны только два из них: обычный и ускоренный обычный. Остальные - ересь неимоверная.

Резюмирую вышесказанное. Если кто хочет просто и незатейливо побегать, попинать мясцо, реинкарнация Crimsonland тому, может, и понравится. А если нужно не просто мясцо, а то самое, как раньше - лучше не берите. Во всяком случае, если разработчики не решат патчами вернуть старые фишки.",1404211816,1404216670,False,15,0,0.589877665042877197,7,True,False,False,False,,,

The original game required activation from their server. A few years ago, they shut that server down, meaning that you no longer had access to play the game you paid for.

Personally, I feel that if a company is going to shutdown hardware required to use purchased software, they should be required by law to provide a working solution, be it a patch to remove the dependency on the server, source/binary for the server, etc.

But in a sea of EAs, and Activisions, and Ubisofts, 10tons has decided to honor the purchases made. Well done.

This new version is mildly disappointing though.  Partially because I was wanting access to the old version I'd enjoyed before; this is a ""remastered"" version.  This version is shinier than the version from 2005, but if feels like the character has put on about 40 pounds since then.  The movement feels very sluggish compared to the orginal, but mostly its the inevitable ""improvements to balance"" that developers think they need to make in order to justify asking for more money.  Several key power ups have been drastically weakened making several stages that were near impossible before, now just not fun.

The low price and high replayability makes it a really solid mini-game to pick up and play when you need a break from quest dialogue or crafting in <insert some other game>

I especially like the Survival mode where you gain xp and activate new perks that drastically change your playstyle. Said perks are unlocked through the story mode (by story, apparently they mean the name of the level can SOMETIMES be linked to the stuff you'll face in the level :p )

I have an xbox 360 controller plugged in and ""hey presto"" I can play local multiplayer with a friend (or 3)... Great fun :)

Steam version is not what I know as Crimsonland. Sure they preserved the game style, but messed up with too many things.
- Most of the screen is covered with gun / health / join 2nd player vs.. parts. 
- Most graphics changed to be ""modern"" which makes game look like a flash game. Old graphics were far better
- Perks removed from Quest mode. Why? It makes game too easy? Try handling a thousand of bad guys in hard mode.
- In the Survival mode you can use Perks, but you can not select when, it just pops up and removes from you the zone.
- Some most useful perks removed from game. Why? Is it too hard to not delete code lines?
- It does not support steam cloud, so my settings and level data is not synchronized between my computers.

Other than that, it is still fun. But if you really want to enjoy this game please buy old version if you can.",1403856866,1403856866,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Als Crimsonland vor einer gefühlten Ewigkeit veröffentlicht wurde, war ich ein begeisterter Spieler. Ob allein oder im Co-Op-Modus - das Spiel wurde einfach nicht langweilig. Jedes Level ist kurzweilig und gerade für Neulinge ist es spannend, welche abgefahrenen Waffen, Perks oder Extras als nächstes freigeschalten werden.

Das Spiel ist absolut aufs wesentliche reduziert: Waffen, Monster, Blut, fertig. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger.

Die neue Spieloberfläche finde ich nicht so gelungen. Vom Flair des Originals ist da nichts mehr. Vielleicht ist es aber auch einfach zu viel Nostalgie, die mitschwingt, wenn man das alte Menü, Programm-Icon usw. vermisst.

Damals wie heute ein echt geiles Game! Die solide Steuerung, das Waffenverhalten und die garstig gute KI sorgen für ein angenehm forderndes Spielerlebnis. Der neue Content, hält genug Stoff für viele spaßige Spielstunden bereit und ist auf Grund der vielen verschiedenen Missionen sehr abwechslungsreich. Das Niveau der Grafik und die geschmeidigen Animationen lassen die meisten anderen top-down shooter sehr sehr alt aussehen, was nur einer der Gründe ist, warum es für mich immernoch der unangefochtene Meister dieses Genres ist. Auch die neu implemtierte Controllerunterstützung, welche nun lokales Coop mit 3 weiteren Spielern ermöglicht, ist ein schönes feature, bei dem man sich gemeinsam den Rücken deckend durch die Massen schießen kann^^.

Warum nur 9/10?
So sehr ich dieses Spiel empfehlen kann, finde ich für ein Rework den Preis von 14€ ein bisschen happig.
Maximal 10 Euronen hätte ich als Preis angesetzt. Für alle die bei Spielen nicht nur auf den Preis schauen, ist es
also trotzdem eine gute Investition! Der Kosten-Nutzenfaktor ist auf jedenfall hoch und somit ist der Kauf schon lohnend.

I've been playing Crimsonland since it came out in 2003 (over 10 years ago!) and it is still as much fun today as it was back then. This HD remake has everything I loved about the original Crimsonland and more.

Yes, there are changes from the original version, but I feel that these were in good taste. One of the biggest changes I've noticed is that telekinesis no longer lets you selectively pick up powerups. Instead, it pulls all nearby powerups to you.

Additionally, Typ'o'Shooter is nowhere to be found. This was one of my favorite modes and I REALLY hope that it gets brought back in an update.

The gameplay is as insane as it was in 2003, if not moreso. There are so many enemies on the screen sometimes that it's hard to comprehend, and yet the game never skips a beat. The monsters now gib when you kill them, and this effect looks really great.

Although online multiplayer would propel Crimsonland to new levels of awesomeness, the couch co-op is a ton of fun. I just tried it for the first time with a couple friends and we had a blast. The game scales the difficulty based on how many players there are, so be prepared for even more carnage.

All in all, this is mostly the same game it was back in 2003 but with updated graphics and a few (good) tweaks here and there.

1. В режиме квестов НЕТ ПЕРКОВ. Т.е. нет того, ради чего я, собственно, и играл в оригинал! И зачем мне тогда вообще играть?
2. Выбор перков НЕЛЬЗЯ ОТЛОЖИТЬ. Отлично, теперь, когда остаются совсем ненужные перки, их всё равно придётся брать. И уж не буду говорить о том, как бесит самопроизвольно открывающийся блокирующий экран в разгар экшна.

Кроме графики, не могу найти ни одного положительного изменения, а вот поругаться можно много на что. Раньше я любил ионную и плазменную пушки, теперь же они стали практически бесполезны из-за изменений в игровой механике. Особенно плазменная пушка с её взрывной волной, кидающей монстров прямо тебе под ноги.

При множественных попытках пройти последний уровень без получения урона (чтобы получить ачивку) начинаешь проклинать кривой генератор случайных чисел, когда довольно часто по пять-шесть попыток подряд выскакивает по пять-шесть fireblast'ов, когда ждёшь выпадения оружия. Там же снова проклинаешь разработчиков за убранные перки.

Бонусы стали менее сбалансированы, бывает, когда plazma overload оказывается менее эффективен, чем текущее оружие. Заморозка теперь действует только на активных в данный момент монстров.

Телекинез, по сути, важнейший перк, стал абсолютно бесполезен, да ещё порой и вреден из-за своей неразборчивости в притягиваемых бонусах.

Одного не понимаю — зачем было оставлено оригинальное название? Меня это ввело в заблуждение и я без раздумий купил игру, даже не читая описания. Сделали бы приписку remastered или т.п.

This game is a remake/improved verison of the original Crimsonland game, which I absolutely loved and spent hours trying to get a decent score in Survival Mode. I instantly bought this one when it was released, and while I liked it at first, I had to give it a thumb down after couple of dozens runs in Survival. My main issues with the game were:

1) Low camera altitude: can't see the field of battle clearly
2) New perk and experience system: no perks in quests (kinda), leveling up is extremely slow, some important perks altered for worse.
3) Interface: power-ups are displayed on crosshair, hp and shield are displayed on player model.
4) Survival Mode: added monster-spawners, average game longevity is ~3 times shorter than in original game, harder to get a weapon you want.

After update 1.1.0, review was changed to positive, mostly because of the inclusion of original Crimslonland game for free. Changes to he game were good, but not good enough, since it didn't fix the main issue with survival mode: toned down exp gains in comparison to the old game, which resulted in very short survival matches, without any feel of buliding up your character.

But now with update 1.2.3 I can totally recommend this one. Increased exp gains and some changes to perks made the game as enjoyable as the original. While in previous versions you died on level 6-7 (my personal highscore was around 350k points), now level 30 is not even impressive (50+ million points is pretty much a real thing). Of course, you're still pretty much screwed, unless you get at least few of the vital perks in first ten levels, but overall, now this game wrecks you with RNG (in terms of obtaining perks, weapons and power-ups) even less than the original did.

Final thoughts:

A great top-down shooter, with the potential to suck you in for dozens of hours, if you're into getting the high scores. The ""story"" mode (i.e. quests) is more of a training ground before survival, so I don't think it's worth to buy the game if you don't plan on playing survival. But if you do, prepare for absolute carnage, because Crimsonland is finally back.

I got mine within a couple of days and simply can't complain and I wish them all the best.

Sollten aber dennoch ein paar Pedanten auf eine Zusammenfassung bestehen, so kann man diesen Filme wie Starship Troopers ans Herz legen. Eine Art Soldat sitzt auf einem Planeten fest und kämpft sich durch eine Horde Insekten, Eidechsen und Mutantenwesen und versucht zu überleben.

Crimsonland bietet dem Spieler zunächst den Quest-Modus an, bei dem man 6 verschiedene Welten mit je zehn Missionen durchspielen kann. Pro Mission werden einem dabei verschiedene Waffen vorgestellt. Während den ersten Missionen schaltet man den Survival-Modus frei, bei dem es, wie der Name schon sagt, darum geht, so lange wie möglich zu überleben. Dort hat man die Waffen zur Verfügung, die man im Quest-Modus freigeschaltet hat. Dies gilt auch für Perks, die im Prinzip wie Skill-Punkte funktionieren. Hat man eine gewisse Anzahl an Erfahrungspunkte gesammelt, kann man aus den freigespielten Spezialfähigkeiten, wie zum Beispiel dem schnelleres Nachladen von Waffen, auswählen. Aber Überleben ist nicht gleich Überleben. Dies ist in Crimsonland auf fünf verschiedene Arten möglich. Während man im normalen Survival-Modus Welle für Welle überstehen muss, geht es im Rush-Modus darum, ohne Erfahrungspunkte und nach Sekunden zu überleben, während von Anfang an schon riesige Horden von Gegnern auf einen zustürmen. 

Grafisch gesehen hat sich Crimsonland gegenüber dem Original-Titel kaum verändert, was aber auch nicht weiter problematisch ist, sondern den Charme des Spiels unterstüzt. Das Spiel präsentiert sich in einer GTA 2-Optik, bei der vor allem die Farbe Rot im Vordergrund steht. Teilweise war beim Spielen der Boden so blutig, dass ebenfalls rote Gegner darauf nicht mehr erkennbar waren. Die etwas ältere Grafik hat den Vorteil, dass Crimsonland selbst auf ganz alten PCs und sogar Laptops einwandfrei läuft, selbst wenn der Bildschirm voll von Insekten und Eidechsen ist.

Die Steuerung gestaltet sich klassisch mit WASD und der Maus. Controller werden ebenfalls unterstüzt, sollten allerdings nur zweite Wahl sein, oder unbeliebten Freunden in die Hand gedrückt werden, da sich die Steuerung per Gamepad als sehr ungenau und anstrengend erweist. Appropos Freunde: Sämtliche Modi sind auch im Co-op mit bis zu vier Spielern möglich. Dies allerdings nur Lokal am heimischen Rechner und nicht online oder über ein Netzwerk. Schade, mit einer Online-Funktion hätte der Titel sicherlich noch einmal einen ganz anderen Spielspaß hervorgerufen.

Crimsonland bietet eine Menge Spielspaß, der über Stunden hinweg beschäftigen kann. Da spielt es auch keine Rolle, ob das Spiel nur ein simples Remake des zehn Jahre alten Originals ist. Vor allem im Co-op macht der Top-Down-Shooter richtig Laune, was es um so trauriger macht, dass kein Online-Modus unterstützt wird. Retro ist ja gut und schön, aber manche Dinge sollten im Jahr 2014 dann doch angepasst werden. Trotzdem, Crimsonland ist ein Spiel, das einfach fetzt und begeistert. (Und für das momentane Angebot von 8,39€ (bis zum 18. Juni) kann man auf jeden Fall zuschlagen.)

However there are some features in this new remake version which I have ...even despise.
- First of all, why on earth it is not any longer possible to level-up and use perks in the quests!?
- The Progress bar in the quests is pretty annoying. In my opinion it should be much smaller.
- The new healthbar and reload system doesn't look very pretty although I understand the point behind it: the player doesn't need to take his eyes off of the player when there is alot of action.
- In the survival, it is absolutely horrible when you can't no longer deside yourself when to pick a perk after leveling. There is usually very much action going on and therefore sudden pop-up windows can really ruin the game session.
- I mainly play the game by myself, so the ""Press fire to join"" infos in each corner are very irritating.

After all that complaining, there are also good new features.
- It is nice how you must unlock the weapons and perks in the quests to be able to use them in the Survival.
- The menus are more graphical, although somewhat crude-looking. (And some menus lack some buttons I'd presume to be there; like replay after winning a level)
- Now it is possible to see each wepon's individual specs.
- The star ranking in in each level (for beating it without taking a hit) adds playability a bit more. However I would like to have even more achieavables (stars) per level, like for instance >40% accuracy or complete the level under par time.
- Four player co-op is nice! (hopefully in the future it will be possible over the net)

All in all it is close to the good old legendary Crimsonland, but I don't completely agree with the new change choises the 10ton team has made. Alse the 14€ price is somewhat steep (at least in my and my wallet's oppinion).

Well actually that's not true; I tried the demo once and the game didn't really seem like anything special. After reading some great impressions from a friend, I decided to check out this new and improved Crimsonland and I'm very glad I did. It's addictive, bloody, intense, and just one hell of a fun satisfying shooter.

In terms of story and gameplay, Crimsonland is as simple as can be. You and hordes of hundreds and hundreds of creatures on the battlefield, kill them all. But while the actual mechanics are not complex, Crimsonland adds a layer of strategy underneath the run and gun gameplay, turning a game that might seem shallow from the screenshots into a compelling thrilling experience. Every moment consists of countless decisions. Which gun is best for the current situation? Should I rush for that power-up but risk having to run through a horde to reach it? Which order should I use power-ups? Which perks should I choose?

I think the most interesting aspect is how the varied enemies require you to totally change your tactics and influences the weapons and perks you'd want to use. It's not like some shooters where you can just get the most powerful weapon and kill everything. If you're facing fast spiders that replicate when they die, then you're going to want a weapon that's accurate and precise but that fires and reloads fast enough that they won't close the gap, and power-ups that focus on crowd control and defense. Hordes of zombies? You'll want to go for the spray and pray type weapons or explosives and all-out offensive power-ups. Thankfully your arsenal is just as varied as the enemies you face. Weapons range from a simple pistol and shotgun to all manner of flamethrowers, plasma cannons, automatic weapons, and even more exotic weapons. Power-ups slow time, shield you from damage, restore health, imbue your weapon with devastating plasma energy. The RPG-esque perk system offers diverse ways to customize your playstyle. Sacrifice health for damage, move faster, have more ammo, poison enemies, gain a melee attack, and many more perks make each survival attempt feel fresh and exciting

Crimsonland is a must play for top-down shooter fans. Besides the 60-mission campaign (and three difficulty levels), you can test your skills across several survival modes, all of which adds its own twist of the core gameplay. The visuals and effects are stylish, the gameplay is deeper than you'd might expect, and seeing the screen literally turn red with blood and gore as you mow down hundreds of creatures is very satisfying.",1402606019,1402621328,True,37,0,0.736326217651367188,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A couple of months ago I've learned that 10tons, the developers of the original Crimsonland, are making an enhanced version of the game and are bringing it to Steam (and also PS4). Needless to say, I was very excited. I have played it way back in 2004, and at the time I didn't even have the opportunity to obtain it legally (I live in Russia, and back in 2004 the digital distribution model was unknown to an average Russian gamer). And now, 10 years later, it's a perfect chance for me to thank the developers by buying a copy of a game I really love.

The gameplay is self-explanatory and very fun. You've got a gun and countless hordes of monsters on the screen - the rest is up to you. By using different weapons and perks you shoot your way through till you're the last man standing.

The highlight of the game for me is the Survival mode. In this mode, you fight against infinite waves of enemies, using perks and weapons unlocked in the main campaign.

This edition of the game has revamped UI - personally, I love it - it's nice, clean, and suits the game pretty well.

All this also comes with the support of HD resolutions, it's great to finally enjoy the game in 1080p instead of the original 800x600.

The perks is enabled in the Quest in default, that's much better.

As a Crimsonland old player, I prefer the old UI and hope the perks could be used in Quest.
Perk Telepicks instead of picking the bonous by mouse, the bonous would move to the player, prefering the old one.

===Старый обзор===
Как игрок, прошедший вдоль и поперёк оригинальный Кримсонлэнд, набив там 400 часов и более 15 миллионов в сурвивале, попробую оценить ремейк культовой игры. С первых же секунд запуска уши радуют знакомые звуки - они те же, что в оригинале многолетней давности. Музыкальные композиции остались также на месте, добавили парочку новых треков - они отлично вписываются в атмосферу игры. Справедливо рассудив, что без пушек и перков делать в сурвивале нечего - идём выполнять квесты. Тут и ждёт первый неприятный сюрприз - в квестах нельзя брать перки. Это жутко раздражает поначалу от непривычности, но потом раздражает ещё больше, когда на hardcore или тем более grim сложности любая тварь убивает с одного укуса и единственным шансом пройти уровень становится death clock или breathing room. Ладно, ничего, привыкнем, тем более квесты - затравочка перед настоящим МЯСИЩЕМ! Открываем любимый плазма-шотган, идём в сурвивал, потираем ручки и... Втыкаем первые минут 6-7, почему так медленно идёт экспа (вряд ли вы поднимете больше 6-9 уровней), почему такая откровенно дебильная камера, из-за которой процентов 40 поля боя просто не видно (для нормальной каноничной камеры придумали, sic, ПЕРК!!)??? И наконец, почему взятие перка просто нельзя пропустить или отложить? Ну не нужен мне Death Clock, Grim Deal, Highlander, Ammunition Within сейчас и никогда позже. Со старыми перками - отдельный разговор. Телекинез стал откровенным УГ, который просто притягивает к вам почти РЯДОМ лежащие бонусы (да, вместе с трэшовым оружием). Уважаемые разработчики из 10tons кормят нас отборным говнецом, играя на струнах ностальгии и заставляют скрипя зубами привыкать к новому велосипеду, притом, что старый работал отлично! Система бонусов на поле боя хоть та же, но работает опять через глубокую жопу. Бонусы перекрывают друг друга и имея на руках джекхаммер с огненными пулями можно запросто просрать победу, подняв plasma overload. Новые режимы, вроде блица (тот же сурвивал, только быстрее) или нюкифаера поначалу смотрятся неплохо, но потом приедаются. Расписывать то, что не нравится в игре - можно долго. Старый добрый Кримсонлэнд, увы, канул в лету... Помянём старичка добрым словом. И да, красная цена - 1.5 бакса на распродаже, а никак не почти полноценная десятка баксов.

While the aesthetic is still tablet-like, the feel of the quest game play (my favorite mode) is very similar to the original.. With a couple of caveats. This version is defiantly one I feel I could play through and not just be a watered down copy of the classic (which is also included).

I've only played a few levels but have an understanding of it works, perks are now included in quests - no cheating required. It is however forced upgrades unlike the classic, once you level up you get a popup to choose a perk. It can interrupt the flow of a level, and forces you to take a perk even if you didn't feel you needed one, e.g. when the level is complete, or like I used to do in the classic, find some breathing room and upgrade them all at once xD... I guess that was a bit silly too.

The other glaring omission I miss a lot is the local quest scores, I loved replaying levels, using different strategies and guns, trying to get the best scores and times.

I'm happy with the result now, the game is much more fun to play with perks in quest mode, Its certainly worth a buy, especially as you get the classic version too.

This game has some new perks and a few new game modes, but that's about all that is new.  All of the sound effects and music, for example, are 100% reused from the original-- in 2003, this kind of audio quality was acceptable, but in 2014, it feels tinny and underwhelming, especially with regards to the music, which sounds like it was saved and then resaved as lossy 64kbps mp3s. The graphics are pretty much the same as well, just barely updated for wide screen resolutions. This is such a non-remake, in fact, that the flavor text for perks is exactly the same, poor English included! In 2003, coming from a tiny indie dev, this was acceptable. But to have this in 2014, from what is now a well established, modestly successful casual PC and mobile developer...that's just shameful and embarassing. (If you've played any of 10tons' games on iPhone or Android, that is the kind of quality I expected.)

Now for the new gameplay-- for some reason, someone thought that it would be a good idea to remove perks entirely from the Quest mode. This is such a poor decision. A major part of the 2003 game's charm was getting to make choices and develop your character gradually over the course of each level, with a clear progression in your power as the enemies became stronger and more numerous. Now the quest mode is just a boring grindfest in which the only interesting choices are when to pick up a powerup, and whether to use a shotgun or a plasma rifle. What's worse is that the game forces you play through this quest mode in order to unlock the guns and perks for use in survival mode, which does let you choose perks and develop your character. It's a poor design choice to force your players to trudge through a boring mode so that they can better succeed in the more fun game mode. Please change this back to the way it was!

Perhaps the biggest feature of this ""remake"" is the introduction of achievements, but half of them are predictable, ""complete chapter 1 of quest mode"", ""complete chapter 2"", type achievements. There's also one achievement which is particularly irritating for completionists like myself-- the ""no damage"" achievement. You now earn a star for each Quest mode level you complete without taking damage, and you have to collect one from every level to get the achievement. Sounds simple, right? Not when your character now moves at 80% of the speed they used to, your success on a level is heavily dependent upon which gun drops from the first monster, and the poor level design is such that monsters sometimes spawn right on top of you (this was rarely an issue in the original). This achievement also goes against everything the original was about: wading into mobs of aliens like a badass, and shrugging them off as you blow them away. To actually get every star for this achievement, you would have to restart your game hundreds, if not thousands of times. Meanwhile, you have to play the game as a super perfectionist SHMUP where you die instantly, rather than the messy, Smash TV style slaughterfest it is meant to be.

Lastly, the UI...I don't know why they decided to change this. In the 2003 game, your health and ammo were shown in the top left corner, in a bar with a black background. You could clearly see how much health you had, and how much ammo you had remaining in your clip. In this remake, they moved it to the aiming reticle, converting the health to a very small blue circle around you, and the ammo to a blue number next to the crosshair. While this does mean you don't have to shift your eyes away from the battle to see your stats, the tiny graphics and the light blue coloring are a pain to read, and they often blend right into the scenery or your enemies.

Unless they patch this game to make it more interesting and closer to the original, I can't recommend it. You will have much more fun with the 2003 version, believe me! And it costs almost the same. I was SO excited about this remake. I wanted badly to love it, and I was looking forward to improvements to the original. Instead, I got a product that is actually worse, and that feels like it was rushed in a month or two for the sake of a money grab.

Edit: The devs have made a post in the Steam discussion forums about how they did include a hidden option to unlock perks in the main Quest mode by typing ""grim"" at the menu. However, this doesn't solve the deeper underlying issue, which is the super short Quest levels (and to a lesser extent, the poor level design). The original Crimsonland was about starting weak then growing in power over time. The length of these levels is so short that this feeling of progression has been greatly diminished.  So while it's a band-aid, it doesn't fix the actual cause.  This feature (one that shouldn't be hidden, btw) also doesn't make up for the generally poor production values and other issues, such as the unclear UI.

- You still have to play the campaign to unlock all the fun toys in Survival mode
- The campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that goes on way too long. If you can still grab a saved game off the Internet and plug it into your copy, not only will you get to play the real Crimsonland but you all get all those mad cheevos.
- The game itself has been slightly changed, so that enemies spawn outside the map, the game has you choose a perk on the spot rather than let you choose one at the time you want, no perks in the campaign... seemingly minor changes, but they affect the game in subtle ways. I don't mind it so much, but hardcore veterans might not like these changes.
