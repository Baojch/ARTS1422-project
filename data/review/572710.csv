I do enjoy the fact that it wasn’t a spooky setting for once so it’s a more “chill” game. I do also love the underworld set, I think it was nicely done.

However those are probably the only 2 things I actually liked about the game. First of all, I find that I do not care for any of the characters at all. *minor spoiler ahead* Like somehow even a certain character being all mysterious and sketchy about his past doesn’t actually make me curious? 

Secondly, I feel like the game doesn’t flow nicely. Like the sequence of events doesn’t really make sense and I found myself stuck a couple of times.

Overall not an enjoyable Nancy Drew game, it’s not exciting and when I was 70% through, all I could think of is getting it over with.",1646624207,1646624207,False,6,0,0.620253145694732666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When you finally get down to the set of the theater, it just gets really confusing.

I've played 21 Nancy Drew games and this one was easily one of the worst I've played. There are so many better ones that unless you want to beat all of them, I can't say this one is worth your money or time. I'm a HUGE fan of Nancy Drew games, Greek history, and theatre. Given how much I enjoyed Secret of the Scarlet Hand (one of my favourites) and Tomb of the Lost Queen, I expected to love this game, but I found it very disappointing. 

For most of the game, the pacing is incredibly slow. This seems to be a result of two things. First of all, much of the story could be characterized as you waiting for the curator to get back so you take care of some small jobs and babysit some suspicious actors in the meantime. Something went wrong with a shipment and some artifacts went missing. The curator goes to investigate. Sounds exciting right? Too bad you're stuck at the museum. It's not even a suspenseful wait. The story is pretty predictable. The other factor is that many tasks you complete are accomplished by triggering things that don't really have a logical connection. Here's a pretty early example that I will make as spoiler-free as possible: the curator has left Nancy a list of tasks some of which involve using the computer. The computer is password protected, but Nancy is not able to call and ask for the password (which she will do later in the game to access a specific program). After some searching it's pretty easy to predict where to find the password, but you'll need another item to get it. Getting that item requires you to do something that has no logical connection to it. It's pretty frustrating when you're aimlessly wandering around this often and this early in the game, waiting for things to happen. 

Another thing that really bothered me about this game, was that you really NEED to make backup files because you can get stuck to the point you'll need to restart. I don't think this has been possible since the second game in the series which was released in 1999. To put the situation in as vague terms as possible, Nancy goes through a door and down a hallway. At one end of the hallway is a timed puzzle that if you fail results in a game over. However, you will not be able to to attempt the puzzle unless you have the required item. If you try and go back out the way you came, you'll find there's another puzzle on the back of the door you entered from. This puzzle requires a different item and you will not be able to attempt it unless you have it. Thus if you enter the hallway without one of those two items, you will not be able to leave the hallway. Unless you made a backup at an earlier point, you will have to restart. It's also worth noting that this inability to attempt puzzles you don’t have the items for can also be frustrating if you already have some knowledge of ancient Greece. You may be able to solve some based on your pre-existing knowledge, but will not be able to attempt them, until Nancy reads the book required for that puzzle.

One last annoyance I would like to add is that the characters keep talking about something world-specific and no one ever really explains what it is. It's possible that I might have picked some dialogue options out of order and missed that conversation though.

There are of course some good things in the game. The backgrounds look gorgeous. Although I wish they had put the same effort into Grigor's face (light haired man from the pictures in the steam store). It's a shame since he has some pretty entertaining dialogue, but I've played many games with worse faces so it's fine. The end of the game is easily the best part.  Things finally start to get exciting and the pace picks up. The epilogue is pretty comprehensive. This is something I really appreciated as it was a real weak point for Secret of the Scarlet Hand and The Tomb of the Lost Queen. I still had a couple of questions remaining, but this was one of the better epilogues in the series.

The sad thing is that the quality of the epilogue doesn't matter while my disinterest in my remaining questions are telling. The majority of the game is so dull, slow and frustrating it's difficult to get invested in the story or the ending.",1530221885,1530221885,False,41,0,0.825006663799285889,1,True,False,False,False,,,
