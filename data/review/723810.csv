That led to having to run around looking for med supplies so you can survive the time. I'm not sure if players can heal other players or not but team buliding will be a big aspect to this game as well as not trusting who is with you.

In conclusion the game has some great aspects to it liking making you collect supplies to survive while you wait so the infection doesnt take hold.

MY health kept draining and im assuming it because of the fog but the gas mask wasnt usable so good luck on that one. i switched threw all the servers and it looks like im the only one that bought the game because it says only 1 person is on on all the servers and you need 15 to start a match unless you go in by yourself. none of the options on the main menu work. 

you should have greenlighted this game built it like that got backers and worked that way instead of trying to sell off some ""finished game"" on an advertisement campaign.

21/01/2018 - Tried again this morning and still unable to play. The game reports that there are 2 players in my region and I appear to be stuck waiting for at least 15 players before the game can begin.

21/01/2018 - Tried a third time this evening. If you click the public (green) button before hitting the start button, you can launch a solo game. Doesn't seem to work if you hit start before toggling the public setting. And. Wow. I actually had a higher opinion of the game when I was stuck on the loading screen. If you climb to the top of a hill and look out at the horizon, you see... nothing. There is a thick ""fog"" that prevents you from seeing anything further than your immediate surroundings. Shortly after descending the hill I was attacked by a zombie that took 2 swings at me and then disappeared. Walking further into the fog I eventually found 2 houses which contained several items that were scattered across the floors at even intervals as if the house floor was built out of very large squares of floor that could only hold 1 item. Some of the items were consumable but didn't seem to have any real purpose.
