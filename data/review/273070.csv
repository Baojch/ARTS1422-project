When I first picked it up, I was a little worried that it was going to be a spreadsheet game, balancing one set of numbers against another, mixmaxing the right formula to convince the AI to do what I wanted.

Luckily my fears were unfounded. There [i]are[/i] a lot of numbers, but you don't have to dive any deeper than you want to--while the AI races are simulated to a deep level, you only need the surface stats to see what's going on. And while a lot of the gameplay requires numbers to go up (your influence, interplanetary relations, planetary conditions, etc.), you have a wide variety of tools to affect those numbers: tactical space combat, treaty-making, influence-peddling, even long-term research/mining/construction contracts. It never felt like ""I need to increase this number""--I was always [i]doing[/i] something.

The other thing I really liked about the game was how different the races were from each other. There were the warlords who only respond to bribes, blackmail, and duels to the death. Or the robotic capitalists that want to see the profit in every action. Secretive spymasters that get annoyed just from talking to you. Or the hive-mind that will only negotiate on matters concerned with its current priority, but is susceptible to irregular mood swings. It's a bustling solar system that truly has a life of its own. I could just watch the simulation play out if I wasn't so concerned with preventing them all from killing each other.

There's one caveat to my recommendation though: It is an old game and doesn't play well with some modern systems. It crashes fairly often on my laptop, though the autosaves mean I never lost [i]too[/i] much progress. I've also run into a bug that effectively froze time in my solar system, meaning I couldn't complete that game.

The objective is to form a federation of up to 8 different races, each with their own specialty and their innate biases against everyone else.

You try and build up your own influence with other races and help foster the races influence with each other. There are several ways of accomplishing this, by helping build up their economy and ship armadas, cooperative research, forming trade routes with each other, etc.. all the while trying to stop them from killing each other.

You can also do hostile actions against a race if you don't particularly like someone and want everyone to gang up on them.

The 2 DLCs gives you 3 different game modes you can try.

Betrayal mode is when you play as your own race and own planet, and try to take over all the other races. This plays more like a 4X game.

Invasion mode is where you and the other races have to defeat another new race that is stronger and technologically more advanced all the while trying to foster relations between the other races. This mode is probably the hardest one to accomplish.

The last mode is a tech race in the same format as the original federation mode, but winning is only possible by getting all the techs before anyone else. This mode isn't as difficult but it just takes a long time to accomplish with a lot of tech to research.

The 2nd part of the game is a top down turn based bullet hell ship combat, similar to Space Rangers HD (a game I think is vastly overlooked), which occurs when destroying pirate base, attacking other race directly, doing missions that pops up, etc..

A very unique game, like pretty much every game by Arcen Games.

This is a combination of a 4X game and a Tactical Action Combat game where you control one ship. How does that work? Well, you are in a 4X game, but you are one single alien with a really powerful ship. The 4X game is the world in which you inhabit, but you do not actually control any of the Civs. To put it another way, you are in a simulated 4X game world, and you are one quite powerful individual who seeks to influence this world. 

What happened is that you were part of an ancient and super powerful Civ. This Civ held universal sway, controlling and ruling other smaller Civs. But they were all destroyed. You are the last survivor of this Civ. You have one ship left, so you are very powerful, but you are only one person. So you have a much out-sized impact on galactic events for one person, however, destroying a whole Civ army by yourself is probably out of the question.

So you watch and wait while the many civs that currently exist, but which are not spacefaring, learn spaceflight and join the galactic community. This waiting period is short, and you can raise any Civ you wish to spaceflight immediately. However, when a civ is space-faring, they become aware of all the other Civs that exist but not at that tech level, and they place their own satellites their planets to watch. So whenever you fly to a planet to lift a Civ, you have increasingly difficult time sneaking through the array of satellites above a planet, because the more people that are space-faring, the more satellites to avoid. This feeds one of the most important mechanics, which is how much each Civ likes you. A Civ will get a boost to how much they like you if you raise them to space. However, every other Civ that detects your action will dislike you somewhat for this act. And it is this balance of actions that drives the experience.

Every Civ likes themselves, so helping them makes them like you. But every Civ fears the other Civs, so your actions to help one Civ will make others fear you and dislike you. This seems impossible to manage. However, Civs will form bonds with other Civs. So if two Civs like each other, then helping one makes the other one like you as well. This is why getting Civs working together is so important, because your actions are liked by more people. But this process is difficult. 

Every Civ has their own political system. One may be essentially a democracy with favours as currency, but another might be a hive mind with one insect leader. The currency of favour for one Civ is completely useless for every other Civ. They have very different desires and buffs and debuffs. However, they all use roughly the same technology.

You may worry about how to unite everyone into a single federation. That is actually hard, and not required. You can kill or save whoever you want. You can choose what your goal is, and decide whether you were successful or not in dealing with all the various randomly generated events.

The set of actions available to you is mind boggling. It is very vast, but they are all labelled to show you the actual benefit you will get to important things like how much every Civ will like or dislike you for an action. However, some actions have additional benefits and it will take a while to understand those things. It is also the case that there may be multiple pages of actions available. As in, you cannot just open the interaction page for a civ and see everything there. There are multiple pages of different possible actions. The categories make sense, but until you get a real hang of what you can do, it is possible there will be whole sets of actions available that you didn’t even know existed. Time moves forward, but you can speed or slow or stop it as much as you like.

I said there was combat, but I haven’t talked about it yet. Remember how I talked about satellites surrounding planets and sneaking past them? This is one of the things you actually perform via the tactical action turn based combat. I say turn based, but it is a weird hybrid, where it is real time divided into bits. You are in an overhead view, and control your one ship. There will be many other ships and structures and turrets and other things. This is a type of bullet hell game, but without reflexes. Time is divided into maybe one or two second chunks. For each chunk, you control how you move and where you shoot, and with which gun. You also control where your energy for the turn goes. It can be divided between Gun power, movement power, and shield power. There is an absolute amount of power, so you choose priority levels. Gun power increases are obvious. Movement power increases both how far you can move for the turn, but also how tightly you can maneuver, which is useful for dodging bullets. Shield power increases shield regen. Guns are quite different, and you also have some special abilities. You may wonder whether frozen time makes it impossible to tell where bullets are moving, but the bullets are shaped so that you can tell where they are moving even when frozen. I don’t remember ever being hit by something I didn’t know was going to be where it ended up being. You can get in combat quite a bit, not only through choice, but through assassins trying to kill you. You cannot die and lose the game, but dying means you spend time regenerating to fully working again, which means lost time to influence the universe. Time will move forward and you have no control over what happens. 

The Last Federation is very unique. It allows you to do things you would never have thought possible. But that variety can be both difficult to understand, and possibly not interesting to do. Your interaction with the universe is mostly like a 4X. So if you are routinely use your imagination to turn number representations into real felt experiences, then this will be more acceptable. However, even though you have a lot of choices, its not like you are managing completely different mechanics systems. You are largely dealing with a limited set of mechanics with a lot of apparent variety, but not really in that you are picking between different options that largely move the same meters different amounts, and choosing between those things. But also dealing with individual complicated political systems that will take quite a bit to understand. There are also a lot of possible outcomes, because of the inter-relations of many unique groups.

 The game has changed a lot over the years. When I first played it when it came out, I played for something like 10 hours without resolving a single play through. The second time, years later, I played for three or four hours and completed a run, so there are massive changes that have happened over the years. 

The Last Federation is very novel, but your interactions can be somewhat obscure, and might not be as varied as you may think at the start. But there is a lot to inspire the imagination. I recommend it, but it is very weird.",1668057287,1668061984,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

You have many ways to manipulate the races and it can be fun to experiment and behave like a good (or bad) super galactic independent diplomat. 
I'm not all that keen on the battles though. The combat is very different than the strategy map. In the map you play more like a leader, influencing and manipulating subtly (or not) but in the battle you're right in the mixer, piloting your lone ship in a top down 2D turn-based tactical, bullet-hell space shooter. These two very different modes are in a awkward juxtaposition. I suspect most people will have a clear preference for one mode only, and try to avoid the other.   

Battle difficulty is dependant on game year and what your trying to do, so ranges all the way from 'Can't lose on purpose' to 'Completely impossible'. Different weapons seem redundant, and there are obviously better weapons so you'll never use some weapons once you've tried them. 

It has a moderate learning curve and will seem more complicated than it actually is. Not a great tutorial but serviceable although many concepts are not explained well or at all. Can be a little frustrating and sometimes feels a bit tedious. Hasn't got great replay value.
Information overload. Events are happening all the time and you kinda feel you need to be aware of all of them so it can feel overwhelming at times, and there is a fair bit of reading required to keep up.

The grand strategy game is fairly interesting and very original, if a little tedious, but I would 
 mostly recommend it for being something different. The battles aren't bad they are just a bit repetitive and auto-resolve doesn't work very well sometimes. The DLC adds some modes that flesh out the game a little but come with their own frustrations. Overall I'd say 7/10.",1666462337,1667187042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's a lot more text based then I feel like the advertisements made it seem, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if it's well written (I found it pretty flat). The turn-based bullet-heck space combat system was weird and felt a bit unpolished to me, but I also wouldn't mind playing a game where that mechanic featured more prominently than this game. The one thing that I think they did objectively poorly was in the way you interact with the various races. Why they all have their own individual governments and behind the scenes personalities, the options I had in how I interacted with them, and how they interacted with me felt pretty much the same between all of them. I would have appreciated a lot more flavor in that regard, but it's also possible that they get more distinct as the game progresses and I just didn't have the patience to get to that point.

The only game that I can think of that has a similar mechanic is Drox Operative but that is an action/RPG.  Your goal is to form a federation with the other races, which you do by helping, manipulating or hurting the other races.  Each race is different, with a different leadership structure and different attitudes.  The Burlast are very warlike, the Evuck are sneaky guys, etc.  The other races are basically playing a 4x game and will attack other races, form alliances, build up their planets, research technologies, etc.  You need to bend the races to your desires by intervening.

The gameplay consists of visiting planets and doing tasks (friendly or hostile) that will have various effects.  Friendly acts will gain influence with the ruling race and will usually gain you some credits or have other effects such as improving their planets, fleets or relations with other races.  Hostile acts will hurt the race in some way, destroying fleets, killing population, etc and will make the race like you less.  Some acts will lead to battles also, even friendly ones such as destroying a pirate base or removing spy satellites.  When that happens you will enter turn-based combat where you control your ship where you need to meet certain objectives (destroy bases, destroy capital ships, dock with a station, etc).  Your ship is loaded with different weapons and special abilities that can change over the course of a game.  Weapons have strengths and weaknesses against ship size, shields, etc and abilities can do things like launch fighters, destroy small ships around you or bring your shields back to full.  It's pretty fun but some larger battles can get a bit grindy as you are just one ship.  You often have help but I don't usually notice the allies doing anything that major though.

This game was really hard to for me to rate.  I enjoyed my time with it but after winning a game, I really had no desire to play it again.  It's hard to see that the game would play out much differently on each play through.  Sure you might have different allies and enemies, but you will still be destroying pirate bases, improving influence, helping build structures, etc like you did in previous games.  I guess I will give it a very minor recommendation because of the originality and my initial enjoyment of the game.  If you like the concept and you are okay with maybe only getting 10-15 hours worth of playtime out of it, then I would recommend it for you.

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

The game gives you a very simple framework of being the last member of a race who wants to create a federation that will unite the solar system. There are two major layers of strategy and tactical. Unlike many games I've played with that design, the strategy layer is ""realtime"" and the tactical layer is turn based. During the strategy layer, you're making decisions on how to help or hurt the races, choosing what battles to go into, or making deals with the planetary governments. In the tactical layer, you're adjusting your ship's shields, attack, and engine and pursuing an objective of some kind (whether that's to destroy enemy capital ships, defeat smugglers, or protect a trade convoy.) 

If you've ever wanted to be a giant space monster influencing solar system politics, this is your game. Even if you're not too hot on the space monster bit, it's not thrown in your face very much, so you can ignore it.

You are the last of a species called Hydrals. Basically giant hydra-esque dragon things. You were a sort of ""rebel"" that acted alone to help the other species your race was keeping down but then got captured and taken prisoner right before the Hydrals were wiped out in a genocide planned by a few of the enslaved species. The politics can be interesting, the races directly responsible for destroying your species could be destroyed and cut to the quick as revenge, or since you were rebelling against the oppressive system the Hydrals had set up you could end up allying with them. Peaceful religious critters, nerdy science aliens, furry warmongers, capitalist robots, there is variety but they tend to act mostly the same with each playthrough once you figure them out.

There was a system in space with nine inhabited planets, each with their own race. One of these races, the Hydral, got spacefaring technology first and proceeded to prevent the others from doing so by shooting down all their manned space missions. The other races obviously began to conspire against them. One race ruined the Hydral homeworld through disease, environmental means, or both, and another race straps rockets onto a moon and destroyed the planet. You are the only remaining Hydral, and your goal (in the standard game mode) is to bring peace to the galaxy by forming a federation. You win when only your federation remains and you fly off into the unknown.
Gameplay:
Imagine a space grand strategy 4X game like Stellaris, except you don't lead any of the nations, you fly around pulling the stings in your favor. I should say the there are only three possibilities for what you are doing in terms of gameplay (besides deciding what to do next). Those are: turn-based bullet-hell 2D ship combat, waiting while you do a thing, wait while you do a thing and but looking at the map more carefully for activity. But there are a lot of possible ""things"" that your ship can be doing: influencing a race's attitude towards another, building up a planet's infrastructure, researching, sowing dissent, aiding planets, defending or attacking armadas, orbital bombing, harvesting space junk to earn credits to blow up a planet, et cetera. You will have to keep in mind all the consequences of your actions to succeed. Winning the game isn't easy, and winning the game with all of the races surviving really isn't easy.
My thoughts:
I like it a lot, however, I think the game requires a lot of patience and planning. Expect to go through multiple play-throughs to figure out all the mechanics.

Let me explain.

TLF pretends to be a 4X game with extremely deep diplomacy and subterfuge. But after playing a single playthrough of the game I have realized that it is basically even lesser than something like Master of Orion 2. maybe more akin to the first game to be entirely honest. Heck, even that would be a stretch, considering in that game you can colonize and straight-up build your own empire.

In TLF, you do not pick your race. Nope, that race is picked from you cause of story reasons. The only choice you have is which races you ally yourself or not.

Now, to get races to like you, you basically just throw money at them (which is extremely grindy to gain, may I inform you). Then, in order for other races to like each other, you just throw money at them as well.

Not like races liking each other actually matters because in my playthrough I have managed to get two races to basically be in love with each other and yet, for basically no reason, they declared war on each other anyway. These two races quite literally eat at the same table, listen to the same music, probably wear the same brand of clothes... and yet they are like ""ya know what, lets burn all of that"".

I love when the main feature of a game is absolutely broken. I have spent ten hours grinding money in really boring missions or basically looking at the screen as I felt my cells slowly die. Then I have finally thrown that money at the races to understand that maybe it would be better to be together against the big spooky robot people who for some reason have armies in billions where the rest of the galaxy has armies in maybe one billion.

But nah, war is it anyway. And you cannot even try to broker for peace cause of the races has a mechanic where their leader ""does not feel like even listening to peace"".

Oh boy, has nobody tested this? Not a single human hand has touched this game? Cause this seems like a pretty bad mechanic that surely has been reported (and yes it has been but devs and fans seems to just shrug and be like ""oh yeah, works as intended"").

Combat started pretty nicely, it is turn-based, you pick weapons, each weapon has different effect, you fight whatever is on the other side. Pretty solid ground I thought to myself. I have wondered just how much deeper is this system gonna go.

It does not go any deeper.

It stays the same for over 10 hours.

It never. At all. Changes.

So yeah, combat is sheit. The screen very quickly becomes busy with basically millions of bullets like I am playing some Bullet Hell game, but do not worry cause nothing in the game can really hurt you. Enemies have TONS of HP, but since you do as well, you usually win most encounters.

It makes me ask myself why is this even in the game and makes me understand why Master of Orion 2 was such a amazing game. Cause the devs actually put more than ten minutes into thinking about their combat.

The only good things about this game are the music and art style. Seriously, whoever made the music should be fished-out by a proper studio and work on a good project. Same with the art team. I am sure Paradox could give them a job.

Anyway, that is all. This game had potential but it turns into a rather terrible grind way too quickly where you basically just go from planet to planet, click one to two buttons and then watch as nothing actually matters cause the AI does not care about the values that you can affect. Buy Stellaris. It is much more worth your money. I would rate this game about 4/10. Maybe 3/10 without alcohol.",1564933419,1564933419,False,11,1,0.567799270153045654,0,True,False,False,False,,,

默认的游戏目标就是让幸存的种族建立起星际联盟，但这并不是一件简单的事情，因为每个种族都有自己独特的政体机制和倾向性，稍不注意，强大的种族就会把弱小的种族消灭掉。

每个种族不同的政体也带来了不同的外交选项，有些种族可以主动干预其他种族之间的外交关系，有些种族可以直接干预其他种族的经济建设，想要让他们使用这些特权，就需要玩家与对应种族搞好关系，并花费信用点数来说服他们行动。并且，这些能力并不总是可用的，大部分都需要对应种族当前有对应的执政党派，如果急需使用某个能力而对应能力的执政党派落选，玩家就需要像想一些办法，让想要的党派能够上位。

科技在这个游戏里也是很重要的内容，一场战争的结果往往可以由一个关键的军事科技而发生两极反转，甚至连整个星系的外交局势都会因此而改变，所以在赠与科技时一定要慎重。我就曾经为了帮助一个弱小种族抵御入侵赠送了他们许多军事科技，结果战争局势马上就发生了转变，原本快要被屠杀殆尽的种族摇身一变成了贪婪的入侵者，顷刻之间就吞并了几个相邻的星球。

玩家也可以直接介入战斗，但是随着游戏的深入，玩家在战场上的作用会越来越有限，因此对于玩家来说更重要的依然是利用各种宏观调控来操纵全局。

Only bought it during sale because it had been 75% off in the past.

For my first game, I decided I would simply observe (there's an observer mode). I wanted to see what would happen without my intervention. Here's what I recall happening:

> First thing of note was that the communist space owls (the weakest race), had their homeworld right next to the ravenous hive mind (strongest race). Nature took its course and the poor hooters were devoured within two decades.
> Should be noted that the space owls, despite being the weakest race, are awfully good at making alliances with the ""good guys"". Without them, alliances would be more difficult.

> The warlusty Doom demons discovered space-flight and proceeded to raid all their neighbors. Their living standards weren't great so many demons defected to become pirates out in asteroid belts. 
> This only contributed to the raids.

> The solitary, territorial boar-people- in a stroke of sheer RNG luck- had their homeworld spawn in the corner of the map. They kept to themselves.
> Should be noted that these boars tend to ally with the war-like races more often than not. Since they were away from everyone else, they felt no need to ally. This was good for all the other races as they now had a fighting chance.

> The capitalist, morally-bankrupt robots were having a blast constructing outposts and shipyards. You might think they were gearing for war with the absurd number of outposts they built- until the war-orientated corporation was one-upped by the entertainment services. The alloy-smiths of the shipyards were consumed by the coldness of space as the robot residents threw a party.
> Should be noted that, unlike all the other races, every single citizen of these robots counts as a soldier (they can augment themselves at will). Their entire population can and will fight- there are no children or civilians. They also tend to ally with war-like races, etc etc.

> At this point, the hive mind and Doom demons were going to town, pillaging everything in sight. However, they weren't necessarily allied... or on good terms for that matter. The two slowly conquered the solar system over the course of 150~ years.

> In a complete surprise twist, the honory bill nye sciency aliens actually conquered the hive mind homeworld. Should be noted that this race isn't actually supposed to take other planets- they don't believe in that sort of thing because ""honor"". The game's narrator (your ship computer) even acknowledged this as a possible glitch in the system. 
> Pretty soon, these guys take over the Doom demons.
> And the capitalist robots too. All their outposts (now essentially entertainment complexes) are destroyed. 
> It would seems these honorable bill nyes made a complete heel turn with their honor code as they now own four planets (in all fairness, they only conquered the ""evil"" races).

> All the other remaining races are terrified that the bill nyes are too powerful.
> Bill nyes are too honorable to conquer the other races because the rest are ""good"". 
> Every race hates them while the bill nyes don't particularly seem them as enemies. 
> It's a standoff.

> Right when I was about to call it as a tie, the capitalist robots made a come-back.
> Despite losing all their planets, there were so many robot pirates in the fringes that they had formed their own pirate empire many decades beforehand. I had completely forgotten about them.
> They retake their homeworld.
> They pull a Planetary Annihilation and strap rockets to one of their local moons and collide it with the bill nye homeworld, explodifying it.

[b] Overview: [/b]
So this is a mix-bag of ideas that comes together and works rather well.

You start off as the last of your race with the most advanced space ship in the solar system. However, that won't last long!
 Each planet is working hard to increase their technology at a break-neck pace and it's up to you to decide how you want the events to unfold.

Essentially, you play as a manipulator behind the politics of this world.... solar system I guess would be the right term, with the end-goal being to create a federation that every surviving species becomes apart of. The game does not end until every remaining race is under your federation.

There is space combat and it's done in a unique turn-based mode so you can dodge any incoming attacks ahead of time and not get overwhelmed by the bullet hell. You need to upgrade your ship up to a certain point in order to stay ahead or even with the powerful races. Otherwise, you'll have to try and tell 1 planet to go to war with another and have them do your dirty work.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] (Above Average)
I beat the game on normal after 5 attempts which may be average to most players. The game does well or at least means well with trying to tell you how it works, but I feel it over-complicated the system. They block off certain actions that you can do until a certain trigger. I just go back and think, ""ah well if I had the option to do that a few seconds ago!..."" I'm glad they tried to teach you the game in parts, but with a game like this, it's just a lot of information overload to begin with. It's a safe tutorial that may or may not cost you a run just to learn how to play the game. You can always try playing on easy if you want to get the best grasp of the game, but normal was pretty rewarding to me even if I did lose or restart.  
So in short, don't get too attached to your first couple of runs. Use them to learn the game and hey if you pull a win out of it you're better than me!

[b] Oddity: [/b]
The only snag I have with the game is that I feel there could be more options to choose from in regards to what you can do and how you influence each race.

For example, without giving away too much, there are a set of races that can potentially create a federation of their own during mid-to-late game. The problem with this is that the game gives you 0 way to sabatoge that federation. In a game where the key concept is manipulating politics, I don't understand why this was left out. Whenever you do meddle negatively with a planet, you do get negative influence anyways, which means you would have to rebuild trust with that planet regardless. So why block that option out entirely? 

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
Aside from that, and I guess trying to over-think situations which I do a lot, this game is really solid. There are planets that you can manipulate rather easily, and there are others that will require a lot of work and you can decide whether you're gonna put up with everyone or destroy an entire race because they said ""no!"" . It's all up to you!",1542266116,1542266116,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Here you are offered the role of the power behind the throne. You are the last member of your specie, destroyed during power struggles by other species. Your goal is to prevent more wars and destruction, so you go on a quest to unite the universe as a federation. Your only tools to achieve this are your powerful ship, the knowledge of your race (you can easily achieve scientifical superiority), shrewd diplomacy and ultimately crippling ennemies in a number of ways, either directly in battle or using shady ways.

There are many possibilities really and there's a fair share of randomness that will make it close to a sandbox game (in one game you might find that your favourite alien race starts in a strong position, in another it will start weak for exemple). Help some races to develop their planets and grow strong, convince powerful races to fight and exhaust themselves in a war so that they don't threaten the weak ones, suggest that a race straps rocket on a moon and throw it on the ennemy planet or throw toxic waste on the ennemy, share technologies to tip the balance the way you want, these are things you can do here. Each race is pretty unique and will be interacted with differently differently on how it is governed (if it's a democracy, a tribal system, a hive mind,...).

Overall the system is pretty deep, but there's quite an heavy random factor that will too heavily impact the game I'd say. It's a bit too easy to simply achieve your main objective to form a federation, but the hard part will be to make sure that all races survive and be part of your federation.

Combat isn't bad and you've got quite some leeway in how you can customize your ship and fight but it's a bit tedious at times, especially some battles barely feel like they can be won, even with massive technological superiority.

The Last Federation is a game developed and published by Arcen Games, LLC

This is a very different strategy game to others, and that makes it unique! 

Combat is asymmetric: the AI has a huge empire that's not focused on you and you start out really weak. With time you learn some new unit designs from the AI by conquering planets, but you always have to weigh aggression against attracting too much notice

There are a lot of different units so there are plenty of different strategies that you can emply. I'm really enjoying the parasite/leech ships, which will reclaim enemy ships after they have been killed

Turning the enemy's armies against their former friends is very satisfying! It's an older game with simple graphics, and the tutorial is excellent though a little wordy

The tutorial is a definite unless you want to be frustrated with quite a few unintuitive UI choices. Fortunately, it's a pretty quick tutorial, lasting no more than a half hour

Overall, this is a extremely deep game and I'm very happy with it. I think you'll enjoy it if you have a history with 4x/RTS game hybrids, especially if you got really into a few of them

I love the concept behind this game and it's clearly a product of passion, but much of it is an exercise in tedium, unfortunately. Combat is repetitive and the learning curve is quite steep. Still, there's a lot to love in the Last Federation. Every race is different, has different politics, and requires a different approach. The races do not have symmetrical starts, so every game is going to feel fairly different.

My first game had me trying to go the nice route.... carefully inserting my influence into the governance of every race and slowly trying for galactic peace through the influencing Skylaxians... but then the Burlusts wiped all my friends out one by one, and I wasn't able to defeat their leader in a duel. Sadness.

Next game I started out with the Skylaxians as my enemy, so I thought I'd try the complete opposite and go for galactic conquest. I quickly made close friends with the Burlust leadership and united the Feudal bovines and the capitalist robots in a ""Strong Federation"". The rest of the galaxy was quick to form a counter-federation and after a liberal application of diplomatic sabotage and poison, we murdered everyone else in the galaxy.

Because you have little direct control, you need to work out how to nudge things to get the result you want, especially if playing with the aim of ensuring that all the different races are in the final federation. A lot of your time will be spent on 'dispatch' missions, while you watch galatic events around you, building up money and favour with particular races. 

The diplomacy of the game is the really interesting part, much more so that the combat. Different alliances can form depending on circumstances, not just the Federation the player wants, and as the interact with other races, races can become bitter enemies or firm friends. Overall, it's not a game for everybody, but if you are looking for a really different variant on the 4-X genre, I highly recommend it. 

Arcen is also amazing at keeping the game updated and doing bug fixes and balance changes as well, which I think really help the game.

The graphics aren't bad. The sound track isn't bad. Where this game fails is a LACK OF PLAYER CHOICE, and issues with the combat mechanics.

What I mean by a lack of player choice is while many options are always presented in a sandbox-type open environment, the simulation mostly plays itself and the effects of you actions are unclear.

To win my first game after experimenting with various actions trying to see what I could do I figured out that the most important aspect toward forming the federation was getting the races to like each other. However, most of your actions don't impact this. You have an option to directly promote relations between two races but all that is displayed is a ticker of the influence gained each month. Click button and wait is not a game.

Slightly more interesting is you can suggest a race build certain buildings that have positive and negative influence gains, but there is no net gain under the current version. You sacrifice relations with one for gains with others.

For my first game I simply built hideaways on four of the races and set myself to help build armada for the federation. then 2x speed to the end and Yay! Victory with a federation of 4. Kind-of lame though to just 2x speed to the end.

The issue I have with the combat is some of the ships are too hard to hit. The just zip about and you don't seem to have a reasonable counter to this behavior because your targeting doesn't work well against this.

I liked the writing style, but it doesn't really have anything like a story, so gameplay is the primary concern.

The big problem of Last Federation is that fighting everything is the fastest way to achieve pretty much any goal. And fighting, while fun at first, quickly gets very stale. There is no tactical depth to it - some cool ideas are there, but you will quickly figure out how to beat a battle (if it is even challenging) and then you need to do exactly the same thing every time this battle happens.
E.g. at some point you will have several pirate bases up, let's say 6. That means 6 absolutely identical combat missions to take them all out - and not doing it is simply the wrong move if you want to win the game (they give a bunch of everything you want).
If you don't put combat difficulty on maximum, fighting will be effortless and even more boring. If you do, you will just sometimes be bursted down and the already tedious battles will take ages.

If you don't fight, you will simply pick a ""dispatch"" (effect over time) and stare at the screen while the simulation runs. While the effort put into making a simulation with so many variables is admirable, all of that stuff becomes pretty irrelevant when, for example, one race randomly conquers another before you can react at all.

At the end of the day though, the game is actually pretty straightforward, it's just very unique:

You are playing a roguelite game whose setting could be roughly understood as a 4X game. Imagine a game like stellaris or civilization being run automatically in the background while you play your roguelite spaceship game on top of it. The two bubbles mostly operate distinctly, you can only slightly effect the simulation that's running on the planets in the background.

Given this, the game has a bit of a learning curve just because it is not a goal that any other game I know of has in common. That said, after you get a feel for it, the game is pretty straightforward. The game is in some ways a bit spreadsheety, so part of what's overwhelming about picking it up is learning what numbers you should care about and how to make money in the first few years (""property development"" and build buildings, focus on the ""attitude"" ones that let you sway how the races feel about each other).

Now, with that massive preface out of the way, the bottom line: The game's fun after you figure it out, and it isn't that hard. There are two difficulty settings, ""combat"" and ""strategy"", I played on Normal / Normal and won my second game without the dlc active. It honestly was pretty straightforward even with some flailing to figure it out towards the start, I beat most ship encounters without paying much attention to the power distribution mechanic (either max guns or some extra in engines), though it does work pretty well and I imagine would be very important on the higher combat difficulties.

I think a fair amount of the difficulty in the game stems from the number of possible victory conditions. Going for a perfect 8 man federation is going to be much more challenging than exterminating the solar system alongside one power species (though both are probably among the harder choices, for different reasons). I've only played two rounds and won by doing what I feel is probably the easiest choice: Piss off one of the two warmonger races and unite the galaxy destroying them, then crush the remaining evil hive race for refusing to assimilate. As far as the game is concerned this victory is no different from working to convince them both to join the federation, but it would've been much harder and I would have needed to play the game completely differently. (There are specific achievements for various victory conditions and alliances that can occur over the course of gameplay, for what it's worth).

For this reason, though I recommend the game and think it's a great example of a unique idea executed well, it definitely requires a certain mindset to play it. Only pick this game up if you're okay with an open-ended win condition. The difficulty (at least on Normal, this probably changes at the higher difficulties) means you will probably win somehow or another. It's more about the story of how you tried to get an alliance working before it fell apart due to a war, so you formed a different alliance instead to force a peace, or something akin to that. Or the alliance that formed without your planning and started to take over the galaxy before you could react. You have a plan and things go wrong and in the end you either have a galaxy under your control (in other races names) or not under your control (in other races names), the end is basically the same either way (because as I said, the background setting of the game is basically a game of Civilization or any other 4X... In the end someone gets one of the victory conditions whetherit's diplomacy or conquest). At the end of the game you're still just one person in a spaceship and your species is dead, so even though you ""win"" in the end, it's really the story of those other races and what happened to them.

I haven't played the DLC yet but so far I recommend the vanilla game for a fun game about being ""the man behind the curtain"" and pushing much more powerful empires around with careful nudges. If you want a game about fighting or winning wars, this is not the game for you. This is very much so a game about [i]influencing[/i] wars.

It's a combination of Drox Operative and SPAZ, except with far more complex and intricate mechanics. It's surprisingly approachable and accessible despite its depth and complexity, due in part to the excellent tutorial. (If only Paradox games had tutorials like this one, introducing concepts in a casual tone at a manageable pace...)

Like most other Arcen games, The Last Federation has myriad gameplay customization options to tweak your experience for the challenge you want. Separating combat and strategic difficulty is especially interesting; the game involves a great deal of combat, but if you don't like it much, turn down the difficulty and you can breeze through encounters to return to strategizing. The combat isn't the game's strongest aspect, but it's definitely an interesting tactical take on 2D space battles. Combat is simultaneous turn-based: you set your flight path, your weapon, and your firing mode, then you watch it take place in real time. It's similar to Frozen Synapse's turn model, except that there's a great deal more to do here. The real-time segments are the perfect length, and you can adjust their playback speed depending on how much you like Star Wars. There's a lot more complexity involved in making combat decisions, but those are the basics. You can customize your loadout (weapons and special abilities) when not in combat, adding strategic depth that requires planning: what kinds of ships will I be fighting? Lots of turrets/defenses? This complexity only grows as the game progresses and more options and possibilities open up to you, but it's never overwhelming.

The real meat of the game is the strategy you employ in creating a universal united Federation. This part of the game (all of it except the combat) takes place in real time with the option to pause at any time. Essentially, you're an independent agent in the middle of a 4X game and you have to influence the civilizations to achieve your goals. Unlike in Drox Operative, a conceptually very similar game, in The Last Federation you have significant power at your disposal. Drox Operative has you doing odd jobs for the warring civilizations, looking out only for yourself and helping or hindering the factions as it suits you. The Last Federation, however, centers diplomacy in the primary goal: you win by uniting all the surviving races. Everything you do is in order to accomplish that goal. How you do it, though, is the interesting part. You can affect nearly everything; from personally working to improve a planet's environment, to advising a race to mine their moons and brokering trade routes with the resulting resource surplus, to sabotaging a planet's infrastructure or aiding a ground invasion, you have great influence over every aspect of the 4X game playing out around you. This only scratches the surface of the intrigue and strategy involved in every playthrough. Carefully manage the balance of power, make sure the right races have the right allies (including yourself, of course), and hope no one gets too resentful of your noble quest for peace... or for supremacy.

I highly recommend The Last Federation to anyone who likes Drox Operative, SPAZ, any space 4X, or complex and replayable strategy games in general.",1496383972,1496383972,True,11,2,0.659185945987701416,0,False,False,False,False,,,

My first impression was quite negative. First it was, what?! I've chosen the race and I'm this? The 2nd was, ok, where is my planet, no planet? And the last was, where is my fleet, only one ship? What the? And this battle screen, what is going on here in first place? A 2D combat with average graphic and something between real-time and turn-based?
So in short this is not a regular 4x space strategy, if you are looking for some kind of the ancestor of Master of Orion this game is not for you.
...BUT...
Best described I would call this game an Open World Space Strategy Menager. At first all seems so simple, build a federation, no problemo, but that's where I found out the complexity of this game. Each race has it's own characteristics, political system and have it's own unique traits (positive sites and negative sites), each planet has many prosper statistics like medical care, economy, and so on. Add random events and relation values between each race to that and suddenly nothing is so easy anymore. The best thing in this game is you can become anything, you can support anyone, be helpful or make carnage, it's all up to you. And game has high replay value as every play is different, as things are always goes differently, not only due changes of your strategy. 
The 20Euro seems much for the game of mediocre graphic, however the content is far larger then it seems and justifies such price. Game also has multiplatform support and it run flawlessly on my crappy laptop with old Intel integrated card.
Highly recommended.

Since I watched the biscuit federation movie which are linked on the right here goes my story of wining :)

It is also very content rich, as the other races might form a few different kinds of alliances against your federation and different kinds of empires (for example, if a planet has a sufficiently high population of criminals, it will become a Smuggler Empire), and if warfare erupts and the technology is there, the Acutians might start destroyng planets, while the Evucks are particularly fond of igniting gas giants and so on.

This game is OK , its not as good or balanced as an real strategy game, but it has his points somehow. the plan is to gave a balance to all and collect all, seams simple, it isn't the AI is some tough and there a diffrent solutions for a win, politically, wars, connections,... Overall it can be bought for a quick play between.

The most problem of this game is the try to mix things. it want be a space shooter and want try to be strategic. both failed in some points. the space combat simple makes no fun, because of lack on upgrades, diffrences and after all ever 2 second a brake timer. the fights are realy fast anoying and you dont like to get into them. as far the game goes as more useless your ship seams to be.
The strategy part is simple to unbalaced. they are races that always win and ones that always lose/died. if you try to get the good inventions and gave it to a weak factions it mostly absolute makes no diffrent. if you know the ropes its easy to know what actions you have to take, to take them down.

On pourrait se dire qu'avec un tel mélange, chaque aspects n'est pas au top mais je pense qu'ils restent sufisant pour offrir une bonne experience... Enfin, si on se débrouille avec l'anglais.

Pour résumer, vous dirigez un vaisseau surpuissant et avez pour objectif de former une fédération qui regnera seul sur l'univer. Libre a vous de recruter toute les races existante ou de ne garder que vos chouchous. Ce genre d'objectif libre est vraiment chouette quand on est pas quelqu'un qui a besoin de suivre une fleche pour savoir quoi faire. Reste que la tache n'est pas si simple car votre vaisseau tout puissant qu'il est ne fera pas le poids si vous gerrez mal votre diplomatie... A moins de jouer en facile.

L'univer compte... euh, j'ai la flemme de vérifier donc on va dire au pif 7 races qui ont toutes des spécificités tant en matière de strategie (plus de pop, d'armée, de science) que de diplomatie.

Après le début de la partie, chaque race démarre plus ou moins en avance sur les autre. La plus en avance aura tendance à vous détester mais le reste est aléatoire. Pour commencer, vous devrez vous allier avec en général 2 races grace à la diplomatie. Pour cela, rien de tel que les actions amicales pour les aider de manière totalement cheaté mais en gardant à l'esprit que vous êtes seul et ne pouvez donc pas être partout d'autant que certaines actions sont assez longues. Vous pouvez par exemple accelérer la construction de leur flotte, construire un batiment à vous tout seul ou booster l'une des stats de leur planette comme l'économie ou l'écologie. Ca semble facile mais booster l'armé d'une nation peux la rendre un peu trop confiante alors que trop booster l'environnement peux rendre jaloux les autres race qui vivent dans des environements moins propices. D'ailleurs, si les actions amicales augmentent votre popularité pour votre cible, tout ses ennemies ne le verront pas d'un très bon oeil.

Les actions hostiles permettent d'affaiblir vos adversaires mais pas que. Si vous concidérez votre influence comme une ressource, rien ne vous empêche d'afflaiblir vos ""amis"". 

Pour finir, vous pouvez interagir avec leur gouvernement et la, on rentre dans la partie compliqué du jeu. A partir de certains seuil en influence ( le premier étant à 0), vous pourez influencer l'IA dans ses choix, construction, guerre, alliance, etc... Le soucie étant que chaque race a un gouvernement différent. Si traiter avec les skylaxiens est relativement simple et demandera juste un peu d'argent, vous ne pourez traiter qu'avec le parti au pouvoir de l'Andor ce qui limitera vos choix, ou avec les 3 plus grandes entreprises des Acutiens ce qui vous forcera à contruire ou saboter des batiments. Les Boarines quand à eu n'accepteront que les conseils sur les sujets qui les préocupent ce qui vous forcera par exemple à saboter leur stat médicale pour avoir acces à certains choix... Tout en en verouillant d'autres.

Chaque gouvernement offre aussi quelques choix distincts. Beaucoup peuvent commercer par exemple mais pour les choix un peu plus distinct, L'Andor peut par exemple envoyer de l'aide aux autres races, les Boarines peuvent forcer deux races à s'aimer ou se détester et les Acutiens peuvent carrément nucléariser une planette entière. Vous ne verrez pas tout en une seule partie.

Pour ce qui est des combats, je ne suis pas fan mais les accumuler n'est pas obligatoire. Le jeu se passe au tour par tout, un tour valant 4 secondes en temps réel et les ordres sont donné à votre unique vaisseau entre chaque tour. Les combats sont plus ou moins simple en fonction du contexte et la diplomatie peut aider. Affronter des assassins envoyé par une nation surpuissante qui vous déteste est affreusement dur et mal joué. Au final, il n'y a pas tant de paramettre à prendre en compte pendant les combats. Répartition de l'énergie, choix de l'arme, choix de l'itinéraire et choix des projectiles qui vont vous toucher car oui, il est relativement impossible de tout éviter si vous voyez ce que je veut dire.

Et les derniers points vite fait. Des musiques excelentes, une interface un peu trop chargé et inutilement remplie en texte, quelques bugs d'interface mais rien de méchant, une map un peu petite à mon gout avec une seule planete par race et un tuto assez bien fichu qui supprime les 3/4 des fonctions du jeu pour les ajouter au compte goute pendant la partie ce qui n'est pas un luxe. Et aussi 5 niveaux de difficulté pour la diplomatie et 5 autres pour le combat. N'allez donc pas me dire que le jeu est facile avant d'avoir maitrisé le plus haut.

All tragically killed by the Burlusts

The Skylaxians will avenge your deaths due to their giant technological superiority over the Burlusts

Long live the Skylaxian Empire.

I just wanted a federation that started with a strong military backbone, (Burlusts) and great political influence (Skylaxians). 
Through my help the Burlusts gained power quickly and went on an unstoppable murder spree.
At this point I ran to the Skylaxians to help the create a strong defence against the oncoming horde and hopefully help them create a defensive force to help defend the remaining races, unfortunately I was too late to help any but the Skylaxians, who then proceeded to use the tech I gave them to begin taking the universe for themselves.

PROLOGUE OF THE REVIEW:
After reading a ton of reviews, seeing some gameplay vids, I've concluded those people are just shills trying to make an ""avant garde"" game sound like something it totally isn't.

Why would they do that?

Because no one would buy this FRIGGIN' type of game as-is, at-all, ever--if they truly knew what genre it is. UNLESS, they've been duped into buying it cuz others have misrepresented its genre. OR, they're familar with this genre, or want something entirely fresh, or are cult-like followers of the developer (we've seen them folks around before, haven't we people?).

So this devolves into semantics, which is not good start for this game.
It appears to me: fans seem to go out of their way to paint it incorrectly.
Despite that, IS THIS a GOOD game?

GENRE IDENTITY CRISIS:
First, let's clarify the game's genre.
It's unique. That sums it up.
In my opinion, it's a TURN-BASED PUZZLE GAME in a SCI-FI STRATEGY SETTING, with some ARCADE-LIKE ACTION SEQUENCES.

GAMEPLAY:
You START out at the menu with a plethora of gameplay options.
Honestly, these don't mean diddley squat because the game is like NOTHING you've ever played, it makes no sense to tinker around with any of this. Seriously. Instead, just try to pick what seems like the ""default"" gameplay, and start. This way, you'll get an idea of how it is. If you want, you can adjust things to make it ""easier"" for noobs, err, newbs. Which is hilarious because...

...after you click through the pages of still images reading all the text telling the story, you'll be dumped into the game and have ABSOLUTELY NO BLOODY IDEA WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON.

There is a MAP of ""space"". Fans call it ""map of the galaxy"". 
What a joke.
It's roughly around 10 planets/locations.

SO, you play this monsterous alien hydra titan that looks like it could devour Cthulhu. 
Your the last of a race whose world/people are wiped out, and you can work to unite the races or destroy 'em or whatever. You don't control ""your own empire"". You're more of guy ""behind the scenes"" spending the entire game manipulating the other races.

Other races have 1 Planet. 
NOT some ""empire"".

So how do you PLAY THIS?
You basically spend almost the whole game clicking on menus.

You can click on the other worlds/places and you immediately ""zip"" across to there.
Then, you get to access THEIR menus, to see the things you can click on to do.
Like: hire some guys, hire some researchers, help them develop something, sell them some tech, help with something else.  Very detailed menus (and everything is detailed UP THE WAZOO with descriptions), explain the PROS and CONS of each option.

Approx. 80% or more of anything you find on any of the menus you are told YOU CAN'T DO, because you need to raise rep, or do something else, or get special points in something, and there's a huge plethora of INFO about each of those things to figure out what the hamhock-heck they are.

If you CAN ACTUALLY find something it WILL let you do...SHOULD you do it?
AND THAT'S where the genius of the strategy/puzzle aspect encompassing this game is at!
Doing an act, might lower relations with another race, for example. You might upset ""the balance"" or whatever.

If you decide to do the act, you...CLICK to do it.
Then, just spam END-TURN until a text pops-up and says something like ""OK, THAT'S DONE"".
Actually, it's way more ""wordy"" than that. But...""SAME DIFFERENCE!"".

So you see if you got credits or points in something, it goes from 500 to 625 or whatever.
Big accomplishment! Rep with these guys goes 100 to 105 and THOSE guys, moves 95 to 85. Or whatever.

That's it. 
At some point, you get to do other things. You just have to do all this kind of stuff alot.
AND I MEAN, ALOT.

Making it easier, is you can set the ""End Turn"" thing on a sort of ""AUTO-PILOT"" so you don't have to tire your fingers spamming. Rather, the game will end the turn for you, sparing you the tediuous monotony.

Some ""things"" you get to do, will take you to an ""ARCADE GAME"" where you have to dodge spinning balls, and stuff.
Reminds me of the simplicity of Space Rangers 2's ""Arcade Sequences"", but in SPACE, like above a planet, with way better graphics. The Arcade Sequence, like most Arcade Games, plays out in ""real time"". Get hit too much by the bullet/object spam orgy things, you die. 

So, don't let that happen!

After that's over, it's back to the ""space map"", clicking on menus to see what else teh game will ""let you do"".

The SPACE-TECHNO soundtrack, makes this all feel REALLY important.

What makes this game so cerebral, is that YOUR decisions AFFECT the huge galaxy...of like around 7 measily planets. Maybe one races destroys another, ALL OF THE SUDDEN! Or destroys the one that are your puppets...it feels like a historical gaming industry moment!

Incredibly thought-provoking, worthy of thousands of pages of forum drooling! 
So deep and provocative, and IN NO way randomly generated. It makes the game feel comparable to the Encyclopedia Britannica, reading Aristotle, or Homer. 

No, literally on that first one. Just one page about anything in the game, is loaded with so much detail, it's like a novel. You should get a Steam Achievement if you actually read just one of the pages (in its entirety).

And some fans claimed this was a 4X game, where you build fleets and conquer them like in Master of Orion, GalCiv, and other well-known 4X games. Others, compared it to being ""just like Drox Operative"" (which is an open-world ARPG arcadish space-ship game).

It ain't. Not even close!
Others know FULL WELL, the type of game it is...like an overwhelming aroma that splashes into the mind, then swirls, and swirls around.

**OVERALL RATING** : E=mc^2 out of 10.

PROS: So many menus you get to click on, surrounded by really good static backgrounds with great artwork, some animations. Visually, it's very colorful. It's like reading a 1000 page Isaac Asimov dribble with rainbow rave-party club lights dancing on the pages. Sometimes GREEN txt, sometimes another color. The artwork is top-notch, the story setting itself is very good, and I enjoy the idea of playing some mastermind behind the scenes. The game offers differing gameplay types. Given how enriching the moving dots & triangles on the ""space map"" are, the entertaining evade and/or blow-up everything Arcade sequences are, I decided the route of wiping out everyone. (Any surprise?).

CONS: I can't think of cons with the game, but rather, with the rabid fans that misrepresent what type of game this is. THEY ARE THE REAL CONS. So are some reviewers with their videos, only showing the (few) ""mass-appeal"" aspects of the game [example: skipping CORE GAMEPLAY, and showing only the ""arcade"" sequences. Many ""REVIEWERS (and THE DEVELOPERS EVEN), do this]. That's really LOUSY. Many ""reviewers"" give-up early (and maybe the DEVELOPERS TOO?) and say ""HEY, BUT IM SURE IT'S COOL AND YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID."" and then END their video.

In truth, they don't want to waste another minute to play it more. 
That sucks of them. Right?

SO BEWARE all the false reviews. Take the time to watch an ACTUAL gameplay vid that's like AN HOUR LONG (at least), that DOESN'T EDIT OUT THE CORE GAMEPLAY (all the menu-clicking action).

CONCLUSION: This is a PUZZLE game at its heart, involving lots of menus, clicking and waiting for something to happen. You're more likely to have to take a dump before anything does. 

There's nothing wrong with that.

You need patience. 
If you're a NORMAL gamer who prefers DooM or CoD, you probably won't enjoy it.

If you're a gamer with SPECIAL NEEDS in gaming, with matured, refined tastes, you'll appreciate a slow, ""cerebral"" challenge. 

And if you love reading, like a vampire loves blood, this game (and this review...) WILL leave you sated and quenched.",1478131783,1478147783,True,23,3,0.640787959098815918,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Options can seem plentiful at first glance but looking  deeper I found myself using the same options again and again and discounting many others because of the poor return or the hit to reputation with other factions.

Dull, confusing at times, and a bit of a nuisance to be honest.

You start with three weapons on your ship. Along the way you discover or buy new weapons. But there is no way to know whether these are better or worse based on the descriptions. You just have try them on battle (or battle exercise) and guess what; each ship takes damage differently from different weapons. I tried a few new weapons but basically I finished the game with the starter weapons.

Other than these eccentricities, and there are many, the game is actually fun. You try to keep things balanced or unbalanced based on the situation. There are a lot of options to achieve goals.

Now go back to the start, we are at a solar system, in a Sci-Fi game, so more or less that's the concept of The Last Federation, very easy to get and learn how to play, but highly difficult to learn how to deal with all those assholes that keep trying to steal, kill and conquer each others and all the events that keep happening while you're trying to do some good in the galaxy and finally achieve this Alliance.

The Last Federation is a turn based space shooter with 4x elements with a particular focus on diplomacy. Take control of the last of your race, a race of powerful and ancient Hydras, and use your advanced technology and superior power to lead the galaxy as you see fit. You have the choice of raising up the civilizations or crushing them into dust. Do you want only one civilization to survive or will you try to save them all? There are a multitude of ways to play this game giving it great replayability. With only a few minor grievances, if you like what you see in this video then you should definitely try it out.

8種族の仲を取り持ち、同盟を結ぶことを目的とする変わったゲーム。
プレイヤーは8種族のために戦い、取引し、勝利を目指すことになる。
紹介映像では戦闘シーンが前面に押し出されているが、実際に戦闘を操作することは殆どない。
紹介映像で示されている通り、「AI War: Fleet Command」を作った会社と同じ。

悪い点
・内容
　・戦闘シーンが空気
　　自動で終わらせる機能があるのでプレイヤーが操作することはあまりない。
　　というか、自動で終わらせないと何分もかかるためやってられなくなる。

・機能面
　全体的に未完成であるとしか言いようがない。
 「AI War: Fleet Command」とは違ってショートカットキー、オプション、GUI全体が非常に乏しく、「AI War: Fleet Command」のUIに感動した方は今作で非常に落胆することだろう。
　その所為か、前回に比べてキー割り当て画面がスカスカになっている。

　・キャンセルが決定になっている
　　意味が分からないかもしれないが、そういうことである。
　　右クリックでキャンセルの挙動なのだが、実行ボタンの上で右クリックするとなぜか実行になり暴発することが多々ある。

　・行動中断キーが無い
　　今作では経済などを援助する行動があるのだが、それをキャンセルするキーが無い。
　　そのため、他の星をクリックするなど、いちいち面倒な行動をとる必要がある。
　　一時停止、倍速、加速のショートカットキーはあるのになぜ...

　・自動化できない
　　同盟に入っている種族をできるだけ守る必要があるので、戦力が落ちていないか常に見ておく必要があるのだが、「戦力が一定まで落ちたら自動的に時間を止める」等の機能は一切ない。
　　経済力など、その値は2000までプレイヤーが上げることが出来るのだが、「値が一定の値になったら自動的に終了」等の機能も一切ない。

　・通常速度に戻すショートカットキーが無い
　　一時停止を2回繰り返さないといけないので、地味にストレスが溜まる。

　・行動をまとめて行えない
　　技術や、建設物など多くの種類が用意されているのだが、一括で研究したり建築したりすることが出来ない。
　　そのため「研究開始」→「完了」→「行動画面を開く」→「研究を選ぶ」→「研究開始を押す」→...と繰り返すことになり、非常にストレスが溜まる。

　・指令を一括で出せない
　　プレイヤー自身が周りを駆逐する形態で遊ぶこともできるのだが、十数ある艦隊に対して1つずつ攻撃の指示を出す必要がある。
　　DLC「Betrayed Hope」紹介映像でもポチポチしている画面があるがまさか直さないつもりなのだろうか...。
　　無論ストレスが溜まる。

　・自動保存が貧弱
　　時間ごとの自動保存が出来ず、場合によっては何年も前にさかのぼる必要がある。
　　「AI War: Fleet Command」は可能でしかも間隔の設定までできたのに...。

良い点
・内容
　飽きが来ない。
　[u]DLCを入れれば[/u]遊べる種類が増えるため、対策をたてたり、勝利への道を試行錯誤することでいつまでも遊べる。
　特に「Betray」は自由に行動ができるため非常に面白い。
　因みに、DLCを入れないと遊べるのは1種類しかない。

・グラフィック面
　背景の作りこみは素晴らしい。
　多くの背景が用意されており、何度見ても飽きない。
　また、一隻一隻の設計も細かく行われている。

・音楽面
　良い。

今のところは未完成としか言いようがなく、買ってもストレスがたまる一方だろう。
序盤は楽しめても中盤終盤はつらい。
残念ながら、2014年販売でこの状態では恐らく改善の見込みは無いのだろう。
公式Wikiもさして更新されていない（「AI War: Fleet Command」の方は鬼の様な増え方）。
どうしても買いたい...というならばDLCも一緒に購入して遊べる種類を増やして遊んだほうが良い。

1.	Never use quick start
Reason: The tutorial in my opinion is terrible. It hinders the player a lot. It locks the key element of the game away: the Federation progress button. The information with in this button should be available at the start of the tutorial and then lead from there. Also the space battle tutorial is needs to be all at once not spoon feed to the player. There is not much to it. The ship has 3 main guns, 6 abilities, and power distribution to weapons, shields, and thrusters. Later you can swap out guns and abilities later in the game. That is very simple and that is the compressed version.

My opinion on the game: (Note: I’ve only played on normal difficulty and 15 hours)

There is a lot of waiting in this game and can snowball out of control if you don’t watch the relation races have with each other. Winning is really simple start the federation with one of the more war faring races and make them super strong and make them angry with the other races. Winning with all the races is the challenge and the problem. I’ll put it simply there is no reward nor reason for the player to do this other than bragging rights. There is nothing that makes me, the player, want to bring these races together other than the opening cut scene and I kind of wish there was more. So that lead me to say 5/10. Yes I skipped over the graphs and spreadsheet parts. Why? Because they can be mostly ignored really unless you are a mid-max person or playing on a higher difficulty (though I can’t confirm that). It's a game that's not for everyone.",1464595547,1531037600,True,3,0,0.474331557750701904,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You see, for a game where you supposedly work from the shadows to shape the world order you want, your most effective actions by far are the most direct ones. Unless you play as a pacifist, it's incredibly easy to just buff the races you want with technology and massive fleets, and eliminate the troublesome races. You can tell a race to produce fleets twice as fast, and then sit at their planet while adding literally a 20x modifier on top of that. Then when they go to invade the race you tell them to, you singlehandedly wreck the opposing armadas and then commit genocide by nuking the planet from orbit. It's beyond ridiculously overpowered, it's broken. Maybe the Invasion mode from the first DLC works better due to being combat-focused, but most ways to play the standard Federation mode are rendered incredibly easy if you use the direct methods. Serious rebalancing is needed to make it into the shadowy cabal-simulator it's made out to be, but in lieu of that, just removing the armada construction option and the orbital bombardment would go a long way towards making the game more challenging.",1464071857,1464071857,True,8,0,0.624536037445068359,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a nonstandard 4X game with heavy emphasis on diplomacy, and is extremely niche in an already niche genre. If you don't think manipulating everything from behind the scenes is fun, then walk away from this game and never look back. However, if you do enjoy that, then this game might be for you.

The Last Federation is a well-designed strategy game with a surprising amount of depth. You play as a lone mercenary, and watch as the AI builds its empires. Your goal is to nudge the AI in a way that will ultimately create a Federation that spans the solar system. Your actions rarely have an immediate payoff, but over time you can decide which planets become wastelands and which ones become paradise. It's a thing of beauty, to subtly change a few numbers early on, and watch the butterfly effect go. 

The combat system is a turn-based bullet hell, where you can manage power distribution, plot out movement, and use weapons/abilities. The tutorial places a lot of emphasis on combat, but managing RCI and influence is far more important. While you can hold off an overwhelming invasion force for a while or smash apart a stalemate, combat is only one tool out of many in your arsenal. It's up to the player to figure out when to get their hands dirty, and when to sit back and help build up armadas.

The game has an excellent soundtrack, shiny art, and a very coherent design. The story is solid, if a bit cliche. The game has a rather light-hearted tone, with blurbs of snark and sarcasm coming from your AI assistant as the solar system evolves. The screen does get cluttered later in the game, but the option to clean it up does exist. Critical information is very well presented and accessible, but may get overwhelming to new players despite the tutorial. The developers have given an incredible amount of attention to detail, to the point where I can still discover new interactions after 40 hours of playing the game. There are many mechanics and interactions that go unexplained, although there is a bit of appeal in discovering them for yourself.

It's impossible to do much on your own in The Last Federation. You just can't hope to make or break interplanetary empires with your single ship.  You will have to rely on the various AI races to do the dirty work for you. The DLCs add in new game modes, but the gameplay patterns stays the same: AI does the heavy lifting, and you guide it and stack the deck in your favor. With a randomly generated solar system, there's a healthy amount of replayability. The game does stagnate after you figure out the optimal strategy, but there's a lot of fun to be had as you learn it.

The Last Federation is a solid, niche strategy game. If you're looking for a standard 4X game, you will be disappointed. If you're interested in this game solely for its combat mechanics then I would advise against getting it, because it's only a small portion of the game itself. But if you're looking for a strategy game with heavy emphasis on diplomacy and manipulation, then I would strongly recommend it.",1460450634,1460450921,True,35,1,0.762398600578308105,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Really enjoyed the start of the game, and the combat, but nothing is well explained, and the tutorials are frankly pretty confusing. My main issue is that I'd spend a bunch of time building up relations between two empires, only to have them form an ""anti-federation alliance"" before I get a chance to form any kind of federation, despite the tutorial saying they'd only do that AFTER you formed a federation. Sounds like a glitch, but maybe I just missed something?

On a more meta level, the game doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a spreadsheet simulator, or a bullethell space game. The devs took the middle road of just using the worst features from both genres and making a sub-par game in both genres. 

Bullet Hell:
The bullethell ship-battles are much too busy and convoluted, and none of the abilities seem to have much impact, even on ultra-easy mode. Having to switch between anti-shield and anti-ship is cool, but it's impossible to tell what are fighters and what are missiles, or what team any ship is on. Dodging attacks isn't really even an option with all the chaos going on in a large battle, so you just have to hope your shields are up to the task.

The 4x style management sim is even more bland and confusing. Every task you attempt takes months to have any meaningful impact, locking you in one place while you fast-forward through tons of war and politics and have to just cross your fingers that the galaxy hasn't imploded while you were collecting space debris. On top of this, every single empire seems to have a different method of interacting with the player, none of which are explained at all. Mechanics like the diplomat seem to serve no purpose at all except to make you click a spot in the menu every time you meet an empire, since there doesn't seem to be any downside to having them and they're essentially free to purchase. There are quests, but I was never able to figure out how to actually go do them, since visiting the relevant planet never made them turn up in menus.

I'd recommend not wasting your money on this lemon.",1455671916,1455671916,False,16,0,0.59698188304901123,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The staggered tutorial does an excellent job of making it easy to understand the mechanics and how the different races act and interact, and there's still a lot of depth to play in. Fairly short compared to a lot of other strategy games (eight planets, with no breakdown of area beneath ""planet""), but there's a high replayability factor from trying different approaches and having different races be ""first landing"". As others have noted, you're a lone diplomat in this one - all your efforts are through diplomacy, but that will sometimes be gunboat-flavoured.

The Betrayal gamemode DLC doesn't have a lot of replay to it (you're out to paint the map) but *is* rather cathartic after having to deal with bickering races doing stupid things and adds some fun planet-management mechanics. Certainly the closest to classic strategy games.

Invasion (the other DLC gamemode) is interesting, as whilst it's relatively easy to get the various races to agree to attack The Deadly Invaders™ the difficulty really lies in having them be strong enough to win, and agree to help protect each other. The resulting Federation, though, feels probably the most natural all-races one of them all.

The Last Federation has you play as an almost godly last survivor of an extinct alien race, who's now made it his mission to attempt to unify the remaining 8 alien races across the solar system (or unify as many as he can and destroy the rest!). To do this he has to gain credit and influence with each race by doing tasks for them. There is a lot of alien politics involved, and each race is quite different to the others, meaning the same approach doesn't work for all the races.

The game can be a bit hard to get into at first, as there's a lot of stuff suddenly being introduced at once. It can easily turn away some players, but I'd really recommend to keep playing, because eventually you get familiar with it all. The normal difficulty is pretty laid back and you have plenty of time to learn the ways and can afford to make mistakes.

The combat sections have you partake in a sort of bullet hell spaceship battle. They might seem pretty difficult at first, but again, they're actually a lot easier to grasp than they look. The battle is broken down into turns. You select where to go and which enemy to shoot at. The game then plays it out and you get to pick your next move. In addition to that, you can even change how much energy goes to your weapons, shields, and propulsion, as different situations require you to adjust it. For example, if you get swarmed and start to suffer damage - divert more energy to shields. If you need to take something out fast - divert it to the weapons. And so on.

Perhaps what I liked the most was how well-developed the lore and background on each alien race was. Each of them has their own political agenda and attitude to you and the other races. Some are diplomats and peacekeepers, whilst others are very warlike and territorial. I've had a lot of fun learning about each race and their likes and dislikes.

Music in the game is also fantastic. Each race has its own unique theme music, which was a nice touch. The visuals are pretty simple though and a lot of the gameplay, particularly the political side of things, is text-based, whilst the combat looks like a regular space shooter. So that aspect might not appeal to some people. But don't let that put you off if you enjoy a good strategy and political intrigue.

Just for those who are a bit unsure of how to start off and get going, here is some advice on methods that worked for me:

1) Start off by giving space-faring tech to 2-3 races you find most trustworthy. Normally Andor, Skyllaxians, and Peltians are pretty reliable, though it is up to you! This will get you plenty of starting Credit and Influence early on.

2) Start doing friendly tasks for those races and increase influence with them further. Cooperative Research is pretty good, as you can then gift this research to the other races and get free influence with them!

3) Expanding Unused Area and Colonizing/Mining Moons is great for getting some quick Credit.

4) Make sure to open up some Trade routes between the races you've allied with, so that they start to like each other as well (this is found in the Political page for each race, not in the Friendly Actions page).",1454177007,1454177007,True,15,1,0.698143184185028076,9,True,False,False,False,,,

I try to do this with most of my reviews.  I'll give you choice of checking out my Let's Play, or, further down, my written review.  Something, for everybody!  :)

A quick word about Arcen Games in general.

I saw this game was being made while I was working on my Bionic Dues Let's Play.  I was already a fan of the work Arcen Games does by this point and I followed the development.  When I finally got my hands on The Last Federation I was super eager to jump in and just take over the galaxy.  Something you'll learn over time, with Arcen, you never jump in and just take over anything.  Arcen has a way of adding a million things to games that you have to absorb, learn, and take care of.  I won't lie, it's a pretty daunting task.  If you don't hunker down and commit to playing their games in full, you'll miss out on some fantastic games.  My final word about Arcen is that they don't just make games and move on, they continue to work on them, add to them, and improve them.  It may sound like I am drinking the Arcen Koolaid, but I feel GOOD developers don't get enough credit.  My proof would be A.I. War: Fleet Command was made in 2009, even in 2014 they released yet another DLC/Update.  :)

Now onto the actual review for the game!

I'm a sucker for Turn-based Strategy games, it's no secret.  Having seen The Last Federation in development I was eager and excited to check it out.  You are the last of your kind, the dominant species in the galaxy, the Hydral.  Your race was a cruel one, the dictators of the galaxy.  Unfortunately for them, they sort of got obliterated.  You allowed yourself to be captured and bided your time.  Finally, you decide it's time to break out and save the galaxy from itself.  You steal a highly advanced prototype ship and, after your escape, you start to shape and mold the galaxy.  The game isn't all about fighting, it's about strategizing, diplomacy, and alliances.  There are 8 races of aliens in total, each with unique strengths, weakness, characteristics, and governments.  Your ultimate goal is to create a federation, or alliance with all the races.  Unfortunately, not everyone likes everyone else.  To add fuel to the fire, the race you stole your ship and escaped from, don't like you very much.  Make your Federation and all who refuse to join you must be eliminated.  You have to convince your allies to take them down!

The turn-based combat is very well done.  It's turn-based combat, but more like simultaneous turn-based combat.  You choose where you wish to move, which weapon or ""Special Attack/Operation"" you want to use, and who you want to target.  Many enemies have shields, or heavy armor, and you have to use the correct weapon for the job, changing as shields go down, or a swarm of small fighters are deployed.  You have multiple targetting solutions as well.  You can fire at anything in range, focus fire, fire at a direct point, or not shoot at all.  Choosing the right weapon, in the right situation, while manuevering in the right place is the key to success.  In addition you can choose to divert power more to your engines, guns, or shields to maximize their effect.  Special Attacks or Operations play another big role in combat.  Operations allow you deploy extra ships to fight for you.  They range from tiny fighters, to lance weilding heavy ships.  Your special attacks can be as simple as jettisoning garbage to blow up incoming projectiles, to hitting your afterburner to give you a few turns of extra movement and speed, to cloaking.

While you can't directly eliminate anyone, you still have all the power.  The game's diplomacy system and how many different ways you can and NEED to influence is second to none.  You can build up your relationship with a race by helping eliminate pirates, researching technology, assist in building a space station, building up their economy and tons of other ways.  Additionally, you can cripple your enemies by more or less doing the reverse of those very things.  Claiming a space station from an enemy and giving it to an ally to boost their production is one of my favorites.  You can go beyond that, gaining voting proxies with their government, dueling a warlord to unseat him from rule, damaging the reputation with another race,  even planting false evidence.

The Last Federation has a ton to do and it's quite challenging.  Often times your best laid plans get waylaid and you must  adapt and change how you wish to arrive at your ultimate goal.  From beginning to end the game pulls you in, gives you more and more stuff to keep track of and will leave you scratching your head on more than one occasion.  How do I get Aliens A to not want to murder Aliens B, but go to war with Aliens C?  When you finally succeed you'll feel like you accomplished the impossible and you very well may have.  There are plenty of different difficulty settings, including ironman mode and permadeath.  If all of that hasn't convinced you, the comical writing and voice acting brings it all together.  

The only thing I would have considered a con is a personal preference.  One that, amazingly enough, was addressed in one of the DLCs of this game.  I wanted to be able to be my own faction and take over the galaxy myself.  Forget the federation of happy aliens living in harmony.  I wanted to be in the Federation of ME!  :D  As I said, the DLC Betrayed Hope did exactly that and more!

Speaking of DLC, there are two out right now.  Betrayed Hope and The Lost Technologies.  Each DLC brings it's own share of updates, upgrades and unique things to the game.  Not to mention their own game modes.

So, in summation:  I highly recommend The Last Federation.  It has fantastic writing, fun combat, amazing depth in how you can effect the galaxy, an outstanding, deep, and rich diplomacy system, and tons of choices on how you want to play.  In addition, it is an Arcen Games product, so you know they are going to keep working on it, supporting it, and improving on it.  YES!  BUY!

Playing the last federation is like playing God.

You control only a single starship, which isn't even terribly powerful.  Your job is to kill just the right butterflies so that the universe walks into your goal scenario.

Along the way you get to play a number of turn based bullet dodging missions in order to accomplish your objectives.

Your guns aren't really upgradable, even though you have choices - a rock, paper, scissors style damage system.

Your control cannot expand.
You do not own any resources to exploit.

The Last Federation is a very odd game idea.  4X games and games which employ diplomacy aren't necessarily new.  Nor are turn-based space shooters, but putting them together isn't something you see everyday.  So naturally when I heard stories from TotalBiscuit on the Co-optional podcast about how he eventually got everyone to stop killing eachother by comitting genocide I was both amused and intrigued.

I then ignored it for about half a year.  I needed something new to stream and since I don't have a particularly good internet connection I'm really limited in my choices. I decided to try a few different things out and Last Federation simply blew the competition out of the water.

In the Last Federation, you are the last Hydral in a solar system of races that hate your guts since your race was a bunch of asshats that decided to stop everyone else from getting into space.  Karmic retribution in the form of rockets attached to your homeworld's moon turned out to be the last thing anyone did to interact with your people in a very permanent fashion.  The only reason you're not dead is because you smuggled space faring technology to another race.  That race plops you in prison and everyone goes about their business.  A long time later they make it to space with a strong flagship. You break out of prison and take the flagship.   

So thus this is your starting scenario.  One race hates your guts and the  rest are pretty neutral to you.  Time to create a federation and stop everyone from killing eachother off.  Kind of, but we'll get to that later.

This is a 4X game where you don't have a race.   You are just a powerful diplomat running around the map.  If it was just this, then it would have been an interesting, if ultimately shallow, experience.  But Last Federation takes it further with an interesting turn based space combat game that takes the place of automated combat in other 4X games.  

You can do everything here from attacking or aiding defense armadas in wars, to killing pirates, stealing techonology, space stations, assassinating leaders, or giving space faring tech to races not yet in space.   During this mode you get the ability to move, damage with your weapons, or use special abilities that clear shots from around you and affect the battlefield. I specifically mention the shot clearing because enemies spam the battlefield with shots in practically every direction.  It reminds me greatly of bullet hell games in this respect.  Usually your best defense is to dodge out of the way.  But sometimes you don't get that option and you get shot down or have to run.

With a few exceptions, the penalty for this is time. If you get shot down you're out of the action for a year and the races get left to their own for a while.  Which will likely wreck any plans you have in some way.  But doesn't end the game.  It can be quite fun to just roll with the punches when you make mistakes and see what happens.

Despite all this praise, the game does have some drawbacks.  Graphically the battles are very pretty, but the 4X mode leaves alot to be desired. It is essentially a flat picture with icons above the different planets that races own.  There is no real ability to zoom in on these or get any more details about the worlds you are looking at save the occasional drawn art.  While this is serviceable, it could definitely be better.  

Next the game employs a staggered tutorial system that introduces concepts as you get further into the  game. These tutorials are fine, but they are very information heavy and sometimes introduce concepts that you can't really utilize for a while.  For example, the tutorial about research explained that you can research your own stuff at space stations you control! The ability to control a space station didn't pop up for me until much, much later. As a result I kind of forgot to make use of this until another playthrough.  The tutorials get you where you need to be, but they could be cleaned up a bit.

Finally the game's win condition is maybe a bit too simple given the story.  Basically you need to create a federation and then either kill off everyone not in the federation or absorb them into it.  The only real failure conditions are the death of all Federation races or your own (This can happen in only a couple of situations.  But yes there are a couple fights that can end you permanently.)  The implication at the beginning is that you are trying to prevent genocide from occuring again with the Federation, only to turn around and do it yourself.  Actually uniting all of the races without one of them dying is very, very difficult. There are different types of achievements for accomplishing this with limited sets of races.  And this I'm fine with, but it seems like the game was designed for the solar system peace situation and less so for the others. It's not a big deal, but it does feel weird. 

Beyond this the game has a great deal of statistics available to you which help decision making should you desire it.  It can also come across as a bit intimidating, but I found it very worthwhile to get a handle on it all and use it to help my chances of success.  Ultimately, I was really happy I learned it all and really ended up loving this game.  If you enjoy Civ, Galatic Civ, the Endless series, or really any other games in this genre then give this a try. You'll probably really like it!

(Note: The DLC does introduce some backstory variations to help some of this make more sense.  It also adds the ability to join and control a race so you get The Last Federation and a more traditional 4X experience at the same time.  I have not tried them yet.  But given the base game I probably will look into it and update this at some point.)",1448648027,1448648027,True,32,3,0.761353552341461182,1,True,False,False,False,,,

You have 8 races, all with very identifiably anatomies ranging from small furry barn-owls to Metroid style Chozo-esque utopian robots to a planet of robots who act like Bender from Futurama to a warlike crab? people (what the hell is a Burlust). The main game mode has you trying to make a unified Federation to stop genocides like the one that happened to your awesome 4 headed dragon race. You can research technology on you rown or with other races to improve your relations with them, help build structures on planets that can either strengthen defenses, help production/livelihood, or just make a bunch of TV channels that help different races learn that they're not supposed to hate everyone.

All this is done through an interface that shows some incredible artwork of each planet and an entire solar system, and text-based explanations that are written as the actual dialogue of your snarky, spunky female ship AI, whom I may add is a fully fleshed-out character who will actively react to the events that occur in-game (she does NOT like when computer virus diseases pop up. Also she can be legitimately surprised if you can pull off things like getting the Peltians to successfully conquer a planet).

And in-combat you have a pretty well rounded bullet-hell style 2D shoot'emup complete with special abilities that can help kill enemies, keep you alive, and help circumvent the power management. Oh, did I forget to mention your ship acts like the old Star Wars TIE Fighter game where you divert finite power between weapons, shields, and engines?

The achievments in this game are a sort of guide to playing. Sure, you *could* just win by completely destroying all races except the ones who are easy to get into a Federation, but some require some finesse (and multiple saves to be honest) like trying to get a Federation of only the Acutians, Burlust, and Thoraxians for the ""Look Upon Your Creation And Despair"" achievement when the fastest way is to....make a Federation of Acutians-Burlust-Boarines, then find a way to get the Thoraxians IN and the Boarines OUT.

And yes, you will end up loving some races and hating others. The hiveminded bug people are going to grate at your nerves as you fly to their planet every few minutes to let them know the hard way they're not allowed to have a military just so you can be absolutely sure they don't end up ruining your attempts at a clean, genocide-free Federation where nobody has to play planet hop-scotch and move their entire remaining race.

To top things off the DLC adds new scenarios, one in which you actually have your own faction and one where the Federation exists and you need to keep it from being taken over by a 9th race of Touhou-style bullet-hell ship-piloting bacteria. You have to stop everyone from fighting each other to have a chance against these things and as the Burlust, Acutians, Thoraxians, and Boarines will have taught you well enough, fighting is something a lot of people like doing, no matter how much you hate it.

The game never seems to drag on too long like the inevitable Civ comparison in the long-running marathon games and never seems too short like Civ games that barely hit the iron age before victory (of course the game can be cut short by you dying but that can be said about a lot of games). You can use the standard galaxy or give everyone dice rolls and just hope the people you hate end up starting out on a planet that's ill-suited to them so they don't explode in population.

The soundtrack fits the game *perfectly*, with each track set to each scenario (trade ship raids, resistance fighter smuggling, invading, defending, etc.) all culminating in an ending song that makes it well worth the trouble those Thoraxians give you DID I MENTION I HATE THE THORAXIANS?

Last, I leave you with an excerpt from one of my games: I was attempting to get the achievement for having the three peaceful races in the Federation and nobody else. I focused ENTIRELY on building up their research, technology, defenses, etc. until their planets were fully equipped with everything they could ever want or need. I just ignored the other 5 races and let them go kill each other for a while. Until....until I saw a small little skull icon with a red outline across the other planets in the system. Turns out when you let one race conquer 4 planets they form a nigh-unkillable Fear Empire. This Thoraxian-created Fear Empire literally could NOT be defeated unless I conquered EVERY planet they owned and on their last planet I had to exterminate over a hundred BILLION bug-people. I had three races completely blot out the sun with their fully upgraded warships, I bombed every single building they ever made into dust, I poisoned their environment so much literally nothing could live on their planet, I undermined their economy so they could never even think of building a single spaceship, I poisoned the population until disease was so rampant babies were born on their deathbed and that only took out about *half* of their population. After just hitting the Orbital Bomb dispatch and setting the game to extreme-speed for about 20 minutes I FINALLY killed every single one of these 100+ billion bugs amd wiped them from the galaxy, which allowed me to finally establish my peaceful Federation of pacifists.",1444296398,1444296398,True,14,10,0.687096178531646729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Last Federation is a 2D (4-1)X space strategy game that combines politics and battles. It is (4-1)X because exploration does not exist. Also, player does not control a race but manipulates other races by using politics and by helping battles.

In this game, player is the last survivor of a murdered race (Hydrals) that was the dictators of the solar system. But one of them betrayed the race. His (Its?) goal was to make the space technology available to other races and then creating a federation to unify the solar system. After Hydrals' homeworld got destroyed, the last hydral (i.e. the player) crashed into one of the rivals' planet. When that rival race built their first capital ship, he managed to steal it and escaped. That's all the story the game has. It is not deep but enough to make things clear, at least to a point.

The game does not have a separate tutorial. Instead, when player starts his/her first game, most of the game elements are locked and these elements are unlocked and explained as the game progress. Its execution is very good. Although there are lots of things to learn, player is never overwhelmed by them. Most of the information and choices have very informative tooltips. They are especially useful when some option is not eligible. This way, only thing the player needs to do is reading the tooltip which explains the reason. That said, some of the advanced information, such as which conditions are required to capture a planet, are never explained.

Every race has a different political structure and has a different opinion of life. Some values military strength and are more aggressive, another is all about peace and quiet. This makes the player approach them in different ways to gain influence and convince them to join the federation. It is also possible to agitate a race against another, resulting in starting a war. Of course, these actions do not happen directly. There are lots of friendly and hostile actions player can take. When player visits a planet, possible ""missions"" are listed under their own menu. These missions are the main tools to manipulate races. By using these ""tools"", player achieves his/her goal for a certain race. I won’t go into details because this is not a guide.

Combat is different than classic turn-based combat. Units don't move/attack like in a chess game. It is actually more like Dragon Age's pause-order-continue style but pausing happens in periodic intervals called ""turns"". In each turn player issues a move order, then an attack order, and fight continues until next turn. There are also abilities that consumes one full turn. Player can select 6 abilities to use in battle and if an ability's ammo is depleted it is replaced with another ability of the same type during battle (Abilities have three types, i.e. ""offensive ability"", ""operations"" and special ability”). Starting abilities are random, but how many abilities of a certain ability type a player can use, depends on which race's first ship was stolen by the player at the beginning of the game.

There are some points that make the game less “believable”. For example you can make a planet’s environment go bad, but race itself does not take any counter-actions to fix it. It will stay as it is, even if it cost billions of inhabitants.

The main soundtrack is similar to 90s arcade games’ low bitrate sounds. Other soundtracks are smoother and easy on the ears. Sound effects are decent. Also when a very important event occurs, a female –I am guessing AI- makes funny comments.

[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]
[b]+ Good Simulation:[/b] Every planet advances depending on the status of planet and race. Strategic elements and properties of the races affect outcome.
[b]+ Humorous:[/b] Game has some humor in comments, descriptions etc. It is always a good thing.
[b]+ Chaotic Battles:[/b] This is both good and bad. Bad side is below. Good side is that it makes battles more challenging.
[b]+ Replayability:[/b] Every time a new game starts, planets and their inhabitants change. Due to compatibility factor between a race and planet type, a different race becomes more effective. This effectively changes how that game progress.

[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]
[b]- Overcomplicated:[/b] Finding which information is important and which is just for ""decoration"", takes too much time.
[b]- Static UI:[/b] This means, UI size is static and the higher the resolution is, the smaller the UI becomes. Therefore, when the resolution is set to full HD, UI elements become too small and very crammed.
[b]- Chaotic Battles:[/b] Bad side of this is what the name suggests. When every small dot-sized ship fires another dot, screen gets covered with dots.

[h1][b]Verdict:[/b][/h1]
Game has a different approach to space strategy games and the formula worked well, enough to keep me in the game until I unified the solar system without taking a break. So I recommend it.

[i][b]P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.[/b][/i]

Replayability is ok but we are still locked in one system and one ship.
With the extension you have more game mode but you don't have access to the ultimate tech like time travel and god Mote...

And the extension add just kill all other race with mindless robot or try hard to make them survive against obscura with your only ship win in manual battle obscura wipe your allies fleet faster than in auto....

Betrayed Hope also seems to double the number of background songs playing for each of the planets, and the music is outstanding.  Beyond that, the gameplay and AI diplomacy on the system map is as finely crafted as anything else I can think of.

Arcen do claim that you should use the fast forward often and as much as possible, but for me I've found that this is usually suicidal.  The problem with the interface is that it tends to be moderate-to-long periods of tedium interspersed with sudden and astounding events that suddenly change the game world to such an extent that it isn't possible to avoid; more work should have gone into a system that allows interruptions of ""dispatches"" when various events occur.  Pair that with the fact that some things you do will have absolutely no consequence (e.g., after I wiped out a five-armada Burlust invasion of the Evuck homeworld, somehow the Burlusts still instantly conquered the planet) and the game can be an exercise in frustration.

I read some of the reviews and wishlisted it for a long time. It looked really different and exciting so went it on sale in the summer sale, I picked it up.

Pluses:
+1 star for gameplay. It runs stable. doesn't seem to have any bugs. Never crashed, or froze.
+1 star for graphics. I like 8-bit style graphics, the planetary icons are well developed and informative.
+1 star for combat. The combat runs like Star Control's melee mode, only a bit more strategic. This was really entertaining at first, but then became a serious bore later on.
+1 star for concept. It really is interesting idea and gameplay was random/fresh each play through. Different events occur that you have to respond and adapt to.
+1 star for the comedy. A lot of the dialogue and events really get a laugh. They did a good job there.

Minuses
-1 star for gameplay. It was interesting at first, but in the long run, I was bored. I think I spent an hour on maximum speed trying to get the last race to join the federation. Just got tedious trying to achieve the goals.
-1 star for balance. even with the entire galaxy blockading/bombarding the murderous bug people from basically day 1, they still didn't die and would continue to send out fleets to attack the others' home planets.
-1 star for size. The galaxy is really small. So small in fact that its really quite boring. it might have been more fun if the races could colonize other star systems and attempt to conquer the galaxy or something. But instead, you just have 7 planets to work with.
-1 star for notifications. There can be a ton of notifications but they don't really detail anything. Andor science station attacked. Ok which one? Where? Can I repair it? Steal it?....
-1 star for story. The story was interesting but not really developed. Apparently your entire race of powerful, nearly omnipotent beings is destroyed by 7 races that don't even have warp capability...",1435731033,1435731033,False,21,2,0.592021524906158447,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its not very lore heavy and if you have it on max speed after your done with whatever you will see that someone is dead. There is no indication that a war has started or anything like that besides when someone is dead, then the ai will tell you that the species is dead but by then you will have muted her.

장르에는 시뮬레이션, 4X라고 되어있으나 실제로는 4X적 요소는 거의 없다
실제로는 폴아웃과 비슷한 형태의 스페이스 오페라이다.

플레이어는 우주 역사의 일부가 되어 멸망한 종족의 대표이자 사회의 일부로서
약간의 기술적 우위를 가지고, 모든 종족을 연합시키고 전쟁을 근절한다는 목적을 이뤄야한다.

이를 위해서는 각 종족의 뒤를 닦아주거나 협박하거나 더러운 일을 대신 처리하거나
아부를 떨면서 뒤로는 전염병을 뿌려, 괴연합에 가입해서 밖에 살아 남을 수 없는 상황으로 몰아가거나
하하 웃고 떠들며 깡패들에게 지시해 자신과 의견이 다른 국가 수장을 암살하고
때로는 결투를 통해 살해하거나, 이간질하고
자신에게 이득이 되는 정당에게 자금을 대고 선거를 유리하게 조작하는 등
온갖 더러운 짓을 다 해야한다.

중간중간 주인공 Hydral 종족의 나레이션인
""어오, 누가 컴퓨터로 장난을 쳤네~ 기계 종족에 전염병이 퍼졌습니다~""
""xx 종족이 우주에 진출했네? 사실 쟤들은 우리를 멸망시킨 놈이랑 다를게 없지!""
같은 소리를 듣다보면 누가 악당인지 모를 정도

종족별로 특징이 잘 표현되어 있으며
이에 따른 정치적, 기술적인 제약과 외교적 불화도 잘 만들어져있다.
중간중간, 플레이어의 연합 세력이 너무 커지면 반연합 세력도 나타나는 등
몇몇 이벤트는 잘 짜여있다.

하지만, 두 가지 단점을 지적하고 싶은데
첫째로 UI가 너무 불친절하고 난잡하다.
화면 왼쪽에 위치한 메세지바는 익숙해지는데 매우 많은 시간이 걸리며, 알아보기도 힘들다.
테크트리는 밤에 자취방에 동전 하나를 아무렇게나 던진 뒤,
눈 감고 더듬어 찾는 것과 동급으로 불편하며
튜토리얼 구성은 게임 진행에 방해가 될 정도로 길고 복잡하다.

(그리고 실제로 방해된다. 다행히도 튜토리얼 해제 기능이 있다.
물론 1회차에는 튜토리얼 없이 진행이 불가능하다.)

두번째로는, 외계종족들은 빠른 속도로 기술격차를 쫓아오는데도 불구하고
플레이어가 함선을 업그레이드 할 만한 방법은 몇가지 없으며
그 마저도 절반 정도는 아무 짝에 도움이 안되는 쓰레기라는 것이다.

DPS는 무조건 1위로 표시되지만 실제로는 그 30%도 되지않는 스프레드 샷,
있으나 마나인 디스럽터, 버그인지 명중률이 0%에 육박하는 기가 캐논,
극초반에 밖에 도움이 안되면서 후반에 나오는 클록 디바이스
썼다가는 집중 사격으로 벌집이 되서 터지기 쉽상인데,
발진 시키가마자 2초 안에 전멸하는 전투기 출격 명령 등...

그 대신인지 몇몇 경우에는 동맹 함선이 참전하기는 하지만
노말 난이도 기준으로도 배경의 일부가 되어 화면에 약간의 변화를 주는 것 외에는 도움이 안된다.

하다못해 함선의 몇몇 모듈 변경이라던가
특별한 승무원 고용이라던가, 배를 갈아 탈 수 있거나 하는 요소가 있었다면 좋았을 것을...
아쉬운 점이 많이 남는 게임.

재미는 있지만 쉽게 질리고
호불호가 많이 갈릴 것이 분명하므로 추천하고 싶지는 않다.

확장팩인 배신당한 믿음에서는 플레이어 개인만의 함대를 조직하거나 밸런스 조정,
여러가지 능력이 추가된 듯 한데 이쪽은 안해봐서 아직 뭐라고 할 말이 없다.....

With turn based gameplay, no less!

To clarify, the ship to ship combat is turn-based, while the strategic map can pause to show the state of the entire galaxy in one fraction of a second, or can skip many months in a minute, dependant upon the players wishes.

The main basis of the gameplay is that you play an unaligned mercenary piloting a stolen ship, aiming to herd 8 warring intergalactic factions into a galactic Federation (one of whom is somewhat perturbed, as you nick your ship off them in the first place). The races seem perfectly content to squabble among themselves for all eternity, and take a very apparent glee in making your job all the more difficult.

In terms of accessibility to levels of player dedication (and patience), it is varied in difficulty. The easiest difficulty still provides just enough challenge that your tactics will adapt beyond your comfort zone, allowing new 4X empire builders a campaign-length sandbox to test their strategies in, whilst the toughest difficulty is, I would presume, challenging enough for even a master of turn-based space combat.

I would not be able to say too much more about Hardest difficulty, as I can barely get past the tutorial level on it.

In conclusion, if you like the idea of a text-heavy 4X political strategy game with a refreshing turn-based top-down spacecraft shooter with dakka levels set to optimum, then look no further than this game.

If, however, you are attached to your retinas, then better luck elsewhere (those myriad bullets, shells and lasers dotting the screen can give some wicked migraines if you look too closely to the screen).",1418943729,1418943729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Since it was on sale though, I decided to give it a shot, and was immediately surprised by how inuitive a lot of the aspects of the game were, but also how impressive the tutorial was(Perhaps a little too hand holdy for my taste, but definitely did a good job of teaching what was going on).

For a strategy game, the difficulty was probably just about right for my tastes, with a learning curve that was not too punishing, but still required you to master most of the game to get a perfect win on normal.  What I was not expecting however was the storytelling that the game managed to do, and while much of the story is determined by your own actions(and very much read between the lines subtle in a few spots), the setup and the closure was extremely good.

Replay value is a /little/ questionable, but that is more of a personal taste thing.  I felt the only weak points were in that department, and largely a consequence of the player's effect on the game being pretty Illuminati-ish.  Instead of the player taking immediate actions that had dramatic immediate effects, the most effective impacts are from long drawn out planning that typically leads to the same roads (dealing with the warmongering races typically boils down to crippling them by destroying their world's ability to make effective war, or by setting them against each other, and tipping the scale occasionally to be sure neither side ever comes out on top for instance).

I'd still give the game an arbitary 9/10, especially if you can pick it up on a sale, and enjoy turn based(this is ""real time"" in a lot of ways, but very much meant to be played with a lot of pausing) strategy, sci fi, abstract gameplay, or a combination of all three.",1417699189,1417699189,True,3,0,0.498038262128829956,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm a big fan of 4x games and strategy in general.  This game makes almost no sense to me.  Strategy seems a vague and ambitious term for this.  You do your own thing and influence other civilizations in the vaguest possible sense in order to accomplish the feat of you, the civilization that was destroyed, starting a federation of the remaining others to win the game.  You do this by being omniprescent through their development and literally nudging them in the direction you want. 

The concept is interesting but the gameplay is slow and impotent in that decisions have very little impact on the civilization you are ""manipulating"" which gives very little differentiation in games.

Now, that out of the way.  The battle.  You spend 80% of your time manipulating and 20% enjoying the hell out of excellent turn based strategy.

The interface is surprisingly intuitive and the perks/abilities actually make a difference in combat.  The strategy component is great, and aside from some short periods where you feel like you are grinding it really feels like the piece of this game that works.

That's the problem.  You have here a 1/2 great game here.  Bipolar in the worst of ways for a 4x, the strategy seems useless and the battles are great.  This is like the exact opposite of Endless Space, and there is going to be some people who love it, and others who don't.

Also for this game in particular they have already given out tons of free content when they released the first expansion, and are giving out more now that the second expansion is almost done. In fact, they are on version 8 or something for one of their previous games, AI war, and they are almost done version 3 for this game.

Now let's talk about the game, this is a hard game to decribe so give me a break if I fail at describing it, it is a simulation sand-box like game with turn-based schump like combat, sort of. Basically you play as a Hydral, the last of your race, your goal is to unite the galaxy, whether you are doing this by making everyone friends or exterminating all the races except for 1 is up to you.

The simulation aspect involves you flying around to different planets helping the very unique alien races or hindering them. You can also start wars or end them. The biggest negative aspect of this simulation mode include some of the options not being as usefull as others and their is quite a bit of grinding late game. The positives are that each of the races are very unique, there are some very good stories that come out of this simulation aspect, and there are some very interesting thematical events that happen. *SPOILER ALERT, DONT READ THIS NEXT PART IF YOU DONT LIKE SPOILERS* An example of a good story that came out of the simulation aspect was when I created an alliance out of the Boarines (isolasionist ice boars), the Burlusts (hyper aggresive chicken people) and the Acutians (Capitalist Cruel Robots), I then backstabbed the Boarines by convincing the Skylaxians (honour bound stereotypical grey aliens) to wage a war of extermination on them so that there were only 2 races left in my grand federation. Wanting to fill the gap I recruited the Thoraxians (bug-like hive killing machines) into my federation. After years of fighting (the grinding I was talking about) it came down to my federation (about 5 planets) and the Skylaxian Empire (about 3 planets), and after all these years of fighting, my federation then betrays me and became an axis of evil, causing me great troubles. 

The combat aspect is very schump like and turnbased (more turnbased than schump like). The combat is very hard to explain so I wont really try, but all I can really say is that it starts becoming repetitive after about 50 hours to the average person but otherwise is quite enjoyable.

Finally, just want to mention some things I did not mention before, the music is really great and the expansions add SO much to the game but sometimes the game is really hard to lose so you will get into positions where it would take about 5 hours of grinding to win and 5 hours of waiting to lose. Also the learning curve is super steep.

TL:DR
+Developers are awesome
+Races are unique
+Great stories come out of this game
+Game is very open about ways to complete your objective
+Great Expansion (soon to be Expansions)

Pretty much the only complaint I have is the combat: the enemies are too damned tanky. It takes hours just to kill one guy. And god help you if you want to challenge the burlusts (a race in this game that is all about war). Your fingers will die before the god damned enemy does. You could decrease the difficulty, but even on normal, it takes so damned long, and nothing damages you. Why even have a combat sequence at that point?
Other than that, the simulation aspect is pretty in depth, though it definitely seems species other than the warlike ones need constant babysitting. if you have it accelerated to x2 fast forward, a race is going to get wiped out before you even see the ships.
The aspect of play, though, is unique. You play as something of an agent behind the scenes...except for whenever someone's getting attacked, because no one can defend themselves. You run around, and do diplomatic stuff. But, not too much, or else those you've united will form an alliance that's opposed to your federation...even though you were the one making them not kill eachother...yeah. I don't get it either.
Talking about diplomacy: Each race has a drastically different diplomacy screens. So different you'd think they were from different games. And this would be fine if some of them weren't really clunky as hell. As mentioned above, if you want to talk with the burlusts, you have to commit to a 9 hour duel (as such, I almost always get everyone to gang up on them. they are such  pain in the ass). And the Peltions and their damned vote system. So few things give votes, and that's the only thing that powers their diplomacy. You need 300 votes to get them into your federation....you get .5 after taking out an entire pirate camp. And as mentioned, combat is this game's weakpoint.

Allow me to explain my experience with the game like a story, so that I can make clear why I don't recommend it (warning: this is bound to contain minor spoilers):

First thing I face is the intro music of the game; very good music, it gave a good first impression. I always try to start custom maps in games, so I tried to do that in my first try, and I got a popup suggesting I try QuickPlay instead. I took the advice. Then came the picture of the hydra and the story of what happened to you, what are you doing and why are you doing it. I have a weakness for mythological monsters so the idea of playing a space hydra was just too cool to miss.

Unfortunately, the game's use the word ""race"" and the typical ""-ian"" ending for their names (Acurian, Peltarian, etc)) gave me the impression the game's lore would be very cheesy (just like in games like Galactic Civilizations and Master of Orion, which were enjoyable but definitely cheesy story-wise). All according to my prediction, the game presented good-old mostly anthropomorphic aliens (even the completely robotic race had an unnecesarily human body), with a very juvenile view of politics, ""economy"" and intrigue; the lore was more or less a repetition of old soft sci-fi tropes, nothing special.

What could have been Mount and Blade in space, turned out to be mostly a game of Spreadsheet Commander; even though the game does have unique mechanics for each ""race"", for influence and credit gain, it is still just 2 abstract and lifeless concepts that you are trading back and forth: credit, and influence. And even beneath this apparent layer of complexity the game _feels_ just like the same in every planet. The purported ""Grand Strategy"" element of the game didn't get to play out. But man was the music catchy.

I didn't get to enjoy trade or cooperation or diplomacy, it really, really felt like Spreadsheet Commander for the short time I got myself to endure it.

And then comes the combat... I will skip it, I don't even want to explain it, but it's really mediocre. It's fun the first few times but, I just can't get myself to see anything interesting about playing turn-based combat with a single ship; and maybe in the future you get to do more interesting things with other ships, but I will quote the very game's Logbook here ""in battle, you just have You and whatever allies you managed to get, against your enemies"", and when I fought enemies with allies by my side, I still could only pilot my own ship. So I'm going to assume the game will always only let you pilot or give orders to your own ship; this is hardly a ""Grand Strategy"" combat style. I consider the combat system so mediocre, that the game would've been better without it; it could be replaced with an abstracted combat method, in the Spreadsheet Commander spirit that the rest of the game took.

Do I think the game has no merit at all?, No, I think it has some, but I'm very picky with games, and this game just couldn't get me hooked. But the music is really good, and so is the art. So... I will just pretend I paid for a music album and a nice hydra picture and leave it at that.

Also, so you can get an idea of what games I enjoy (and you can tell whether to trust my taste or not):
Mount and Blade: > 500 hours
Crusader Kings II: > 100  (this game is quite the map-painting simulator, but it had <something> that made it feel a little more than that, and so it did get me hooked).
Civilization V: > 400 hours
Starbound: > 100 hours
Dota 2: > 100 hours

That's an example of some of the games in my library.

ONE play session lasted me for a full 8 hours, unlike Civ, You seriously cannot rush this game, atleast not when new like I am.

If you're worried if the game's fun, don't, I enjoyed every minute, when i wasn't getting upset, crying, almost internally dying at my own stupidity as the game screwed me a good 6 times each.

This game is very rather unique in it's own way, I'm fairly sure you won't find another like it for years to come.

You will get your money's worth in this game. Despite the looks, I love this game almost as much as Civ 2: Test of Time, my all-time favorite.

The feeling you'll get when you beat the game for the first time is even better than killing a hard Dark Souls 1 boss. The bliss I am now feeling is... beyond words right now.

In the game's current state, it is now actually decently easy to play in comparison to past versions, if before wasn't a good time to get it, now's good.

The game itself is a clever blend of strategy and shooter, seeming ot be able to go from Real-Time strategy game with a ""galaxy"" map and a pause button, then go into battle and it's more like Demonstar, only a turn-based, tactical, strategic shooter version in combat.

Combat is simple, but complicated at the same time, with just enough to not be too much to new players.

The game has you trying to unite a system composed to 8 civilizations, all crowded together, in an alliance. Each race has their own ideals and even their own way of doing things and personalities, no two races are the same, and that's where the challenge comes from.

A couple will always pick a fight, two or three will always be technologically ahead, there is a rather weak race who is easy to get in good terms with ofcourse, but everybody is different.

There's so much to do in this game, all that one really needs to do is find what they need to do and do it.

The soundtrack and art design is simply wonderful, I personally love it, now that races will be on randomized planets, it makes it even better.

The tutorial is Very well done with new players directly in mind as it explains EVERYTHING at an even pace, and does so in-depth aswell, unlike many other games on Steam today.
There is no tutorial level thankfully, the tutorial itself is integrated into hte game itself, and entries can be called upon later in the menu, later in the game if you've missed how to change power levels on your ship, or start making the federation.

Beating this game for the first time on the lowest of difficulties gave me a feeling that not even beating Dark Souls 2's bosses gave me.

Ultimately, this game gets a 7/10 in my books; I can't describe it, it's just this game is so nicely done in every way, it oozes creativity, quality and it is clear the Developer has put their heart into making this game.

As it turns out the only people in the Fed who hated the acutians enough to go to war with them were the Pelatians.  So i have to spend some 50 years dragging the acutians reputation through mud before everyone finally agrees to go to war with them.  Problem is at this point the acutians have finished the tech tree in its entirety largely thanks to the boost I had the skylaxians give them.  So begins a long drawn out war of attrition between the alliance and the acutians.  After 30 years of war with no visible progress, I decide that I need to finish out my tech tree, so I can actually fight all these assasins the acutians keep sending after me.  So I finish out the tech tree taking about a century to do so.   Now at this point i had essntially gotten infinite money.  So i thought to myself how will i kill the acutians when they keep breeding like rabbits.  Then it hit me.  I'll just pay the evucks a crap-ton of money to poison the environment and ruin the medical capablities of the Acutians with their probes.  So a few million later and the acutians planets are cesspools of disease.  At which point a virus springs up.  I then hire a small army of 60 bioterrorists to infect every last acutian with this virus.  5 years later the acutians are dead, and I win the game.

I'll share my favorite experience of what I've played so far:  I was still trying to get my feet under me and I decided to try to steal some tech from the robootic capitalists.  Now in doing so I ended up obliterating their fleet.  I was pleased with myself at first until I saw one of the other races jump at the undefended opportunity and assault them with their fleet.  Now this attacking race was not one I wanted to have a terrotorial lead, so I intervened and destroyed their fleet, severely damaging my reputation with them.  Then another ""bad guy"" race attacked the planet, forcing me to intervene again.  Then the hive-mind race attacked.... Eventually I had effectively pushed a huge ""reset button"" and reduced most other races fleets into rubble.  The people I had stolen the tech from were safe.  Of course now half of the system hated my guts for playing galaxy police.  At first I was a bit frustrated with the game because of this, then I really appreciated the story that had just unfolded as I basically repeated the mistakes of my in-game species all over again.

-Endgame can be a bit of a grind.( depending on how you play)

I definitely will be playing through again.And probably again after that because there are many ways to handle the different situations in the game and because the underlying sim/Ai/random gen can make each game play out different.

The game has a very Tactical feel,The Time Controls on the starting map allow you to accelerate until something happens then pause and think about what to do next.And planning out your moves a few seconds at a time during the combat portions feels great.

There seems to be a deep sim under the surface,it's there if you want it.But on my first game I largely ignored most of the numbers sheets and still enjoyed the game.I suspect if you really want to play the game well you may need to dig into this portion,but it's still perfectly possible to succeed at least somewhat without paying any attention to it.

It's a fantastic concept that I don't recall ever seeing in another game like this. You start as the lone survivor of a tyrannic race of hydrals (large hydras) in a solar system that has eight surviving races. They are all weary of you, some of them having led a destruction of your fellow hydrals. You retain a technology superiority throughtout the game, but because you play as a single ship, you must direct the course of the solar system by proxy, through a spectrum of diplomatic, political, and economic options (though admittedly, they are little more than number modifiers). The combat's effects are limited to earning credits, new ship equipment, and changing the races' opinions. 

I found the tactical combat fun for the first couple of hours, but not entertaining enough afterwards. Luckily, there's an effective auto-combat feature that lets you skip the combat.

The strategic gameplay is well-balanced and varied. In the last game that I finished, I unified the solar system by doing the following:

1. Asked one planet to start trading economically with another, building goodwill.

2. Asked another planet to start ""lauding"" another planet, building goodwill.

3. Transferred technology to a third planet to buy influence and gain proxy votes in their planetary assembly. The three planets I worked on until now qualified to form the federation at this point.

4. Built credits and influence, waiting for the fourth planet to develop its economy and technology enough that it changed from an isolationist society into an outward looking civilization amenable to joining the federation. The fourth planet joined.

5. Kept dueling the leader of the warrior society planet until I built enough respect to browbeat them into joining the federation.

6. Bought my way into having the sixth planet join, with a ton of credits.

7. Asked half of the federation member planets to attack the seventh planet, the one that the game spawned as having destroyed the Hydrals. Their hatred of my player character had deteriorated too much for a diplomatic solution. The seventh planet was taken over by one of the federation planets.

8. Destroyed the medical and environmental infrastructure of the eight planet, while having the federation planets wage war on the planet. They lasted a while before finally succumbing to the federation.

9. The game ended, and I enjoyed a really nice song to accompany the ending screen.

I can't remember ever playing a game like this with such a varied approach for all the races. The fact that the scope of the game was limited to a single solar system where all the races resided helped, as opposed to a traditional 4x space strategy game where the numbers often got bloated. It's not a game I would play repeatedly, but I enjoyed the two days I spent with it.",1407185121,1407185121,True,4,0,0.529295444488525391,0,False,False,False,False,,,

je ne recommande pas ce jeu !

quand on vous dit, gestion d'un vaisseau spatial, création d'un empire, recherche de technologies, établissement de traités commerciaux et militaires, quêtes ...

vous vous pensez comme moi direct : c'est un 4X !

bah ... oui et non.

Il faut reconnaitre que pour une fois les devs sont sorti des sentiers battus. Ils ont voulu proposer quelque chose de différents. Malheureusement je ne sais pas si ça tient au fait qu'ils est été trop feignant pour nous créer d'autres images de fond que la sempiternel galaxie avec sa dizaine de planètes à tout casser ; ou bien si c'est le fait que l'on ne peux PAS colonier notre planète d'origine OU prendre le controle d'une planète adverse OU annihiler totalement une faction ennemie sans passer par 15 millions d'écran différents...

franchement quoi ... j'envoi mon vaisseau sur une planète ennemie, pour l'attaquer faut que je click sur ""hostile action"" ensuite dans l'autre écran je choisis d'attaquer l'armada en présence, ce que l'on me déconseille parce que soit disant trop dangereux, je le fais me voila sur le champ de bataille je poutre les 6 pauvre vaisseaux en face je reviens à l'écran de la galaxie. La normalement dans ton bon 4X qui se respecte, la planète n'a plus de défense, on la colonise en réduisant en esclavage la population locale ... normal quoi ? bah là non. Vous aurez beau chercher dans tout les menu que vous voudrez, les actions amicale, les actions hostile ou même demander à parler au gouvernement en place, on ne peut pas leur dire de capituler ... alors j'ai acheter un ""informant"" un espion quoi, j'ai fait assassiner tout les membre du parlement, enfin je pense ... entre 60 et 360 personnes tuées pour chaque essai sur un total de 400 et j'ai fait assez d'essai pour réussir ... normalement y a PLUS PERSONNE DANS LEUR PARLEMENT !!! j'ai atteint les -2500 et quelques dans la réputation que j'entretiens avec eux, autant dire que je suis en mauvais terme .... bah non, ils ont plus de gouvernement, ils ont plus de défenses orbitales, mais je peux toujours pas les coloniser !!!!!!!!!!!!!

foutage de gueule quand tu nous tiens ...

bon à part ce léger soucis ... qui représente quand même 70% d'un jeu 4X normal.

L'arbre de recherche ... lol.

vous faites donc des recherches qui servent ... A RIEN. Enfin si, elles servent si vous souhaitez les échanger vis a vis des autres factions pour gagner de la réputation ... OMG !!! c'est quoi ça !!! et bien sur si tu échange ta recherche avec la faction X la faction Y va t'en vouloir et donc tu va baisser ta réput avec eux.... le but étant de former une fédération avec TOUTES les races ça en deviens ridicule.
Encore si les recherches permettaient d'upgrader ton vaisseau ... mais non, totalement useless dans la plupart des cas. 

Le vaisseau parlons-en tient !

Un peu comme dans les simulateur de dog fight spatiaux classique vous gérer l'énergie que vous envoyer dans les différents systèmes à savoir l'armement le bouclier et la propulsion ... pour vous donner unn exemple récurent de mes combats :
j'attaque, je poutre un vaisseau, je met maxi propulsion et fonce sur un autre vaisseau qui prend la fuite ... et pendant les 4 tours suivants j'essaie de le ratrapper ! au moment où je le fais je le dégomme et hop fin du combat ... mais ... et les autres vaisseaux la bas loin derrière ? ah bah ils ont fuit dans la direction opposée à la tiennne ... ok ... génialllllllll ...
L'un des rare moyen pour tout dégommer est d'attendre la dernière minutes pour bouger, quand tout les vaisseaux ennemis vous encercle, comme ça même si vous en dégommer un vous pouvez etre sur d'avoir un deuxième dans la foulée sans avoir à jouer à chat et de partir sur un troisième ...

Another is a collective of capitalist robots. All of these races have different political systems. Of course when said first race eventually takes up arms against you it's time to defend yourself.

It seemed like some approaches were not actually feasible, which was made even more egregious by the fact that there were achievements for them. Like ""win a game with only one race in the federation"" for each race. 

Changes have made that kind of thing more viable.

I kind of knew going in that it had problems, but I felt it was a concept worth endorsing. A kind of strategy game where you don't control armies, but make suggestions and take specific actions. I'd like to say ""and you don't have much impact"", but when you can convince one race to strap rockets to a moon and send it crashing into another race's homeworld, destroying the planet utterly? That is making a pretty significant impact. In a literal and figurative manner. 

How you interact with each race is a little different. Sometimes you deal with a democractic society. In those situations you might bribe individuals or make speeches for or against parties. Some civilizations have an insect queen, so you bribe them with tasty food in order to have them mood swing to something that suits your purposes better. Sometimes you'll kill their leaders. One race will respect you more if you do that. One race consists entirely of corporations. So you can help the corporations that do the things you like get into power by helping them construct buildings. 

The setting is creative, and the writting is pretty good too. There is little voice acting, most of which takes the form of your ships computer, whom I kind of love. Lots of personality. If I was the last member of a tyranical alien race I think I'd want an onboard self aware computer a lot like that too. 

What makes this game interesting is the way you approach diplomacy. You have a goal, in forming an interplantary federation. Several alien races working together. But how you manage that is pretty open ended. You don't have to be a nice guy about it. I for one am having a bit too much fun getting those ""win a game with only one race left"" achievements. See, you can't actually form a federation unless at least two races like each other. Which means one of them has to die. And the best way to ensure that happens is to influence another race to betray them. And then help the remaining race in your federation commit genocide on planatary scales. 

You can also try and do things in a less transparently malevolent fashion. And I feel that's kind of the way you're supposed to do it. But at the same time there's something kind of awesome about forming an alliance out of literal capitalist robots, a race that is so death metal that they like you MORE when you defeat their leaders in personal duels and sell the pilots you ""rescue"" into slavery, and insects that eat everything ruled by hive queens that undergo constant mood swings.

That one is actually pretty tricky because they can decide they're better off without you, and kick you out of your own federation you formed. But figuring out some kind of strategy is why it's fun.",1400838377,1400838377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has a lot of interesting features but the overall result is that those features could have been handled in a better way.

The first and most horrible turn off for me in this game is the amount of information this game gives : Whoa ! I never saw  so much information in a game. From the planet info to the history log, this is too much for me to enjoy playing. It's like I spend most of my time reading instead of actually playing the game... 
What's more, a lot of those information are not really needed and as many others already said, the game just requires you to make friends with who you want and do missions for them.

Which makes me come to my second point : Too repetitive. When I saw the battles were in real time, I thought it was a really interesting game but after going throught dozens of battles, well it got quite boring. Just move and choose the weapon and let the game do the rest. Yeah, it includes some strategy but battles are such a mess that most of the time, it'll be more like a rock-paper-scissor battle, just find the good weapon and avoid missiles. I thought there would be more customization for the weapon like the ability to purchase and evolve your ship parts, but what we have just make it the same whatever weapon you use. And being interrupted each second to give orders is rather annoying.

Another small point that annoys me is the UI. I don't know why but I feel like the UI is not clean, the typo is not easy to read and the information display ticks me off, like it's not at the level it should be for a game worth 20$. But maybe it's just me.

All those points together makes it a no for me. If you enjoy space strategy games, I'd rather recommend other games (such as Endless Space which is a must have for me).",1400249444,1400249484,False,8,0,0.501290977001190186,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game in it's current state isn't complete and you can feel  those kind of echos as you advance through various play-throughs. This feeling usually goes up as ""how does helping X get me closer to Y or how can this impact relations with race A."" Some of the newer patches make the game feel more complete and I really feel like the devs will keep making updates for this game.

The price is worth it in my opinion, you might be turned off at first by the fact that this is a 4X game where you control only a single person. This is why the game works, you feel like you ARE the last of an advanced race and that you ARE going to give fire to the other races. I really felt like It was my job to watch over these other races (most of the time) and the game seems balanced between being this merc and the actual race. You can't just nuke everyone off the galaxy (by yourself, any way.) 

Alliances work pretty well in this game. A certain race can give aid to other planets, another can dump toxic waste and disrupt  the economy, another can create deadly viruses and crash moons, and planets can even be destroyed. You can kill a Queen of a race, the senate of another, undermine a CEO's company, and kill the leading warlord in an honourable duel in order to get a better pull of that race decision making or to ruin their strength.

Combat is a bit simplistic but works very well and I found myself enjoying the combat system. It does get easier as you get stronger and more experince, so you can turn up the combat difficuility without making the strategy harder. Or you can turn up the strategy part and turn down the combat to make for a more decision-making gameplay. This is a very cool feature and I wish more 4x games would have this.

The solar system is a bit small in my opinion, but gets VERY VERY packed later in the game. After very long games, I loose the ability to speed through time because my computer ran the game very slowly due to the mass population of the system. This is likely more of a reflection of my system and less of a reflection of the game itself; besides the HUGE amounts of populations later in game, the game is pretty smooth.

Races are diverse and unique, but seemingly are in small numbers. I would love to see more races that can appear in different games (or not appear.) Planets seem to be quasi-random and I notice that race locations vary among games. Events are random and I've never had a game play the same twice (some times a ""bad guy"" race and befriend a ""good guy"" race and literally form a fear empire, or ""good guy"" coalation can form a union of planets.) These alliances are your competition and can overpower the federation you are trying to create and kill you.

On joue derrière les coulisses d'un systeme solaire dans lequel chaque race est influencée par nos décisions.
Les manigances et manipulations se font pour le meilleur ou pour le pire. Car même si l'objectif final est d'unir le système solaire au sein d'une fédération unie, les moyens pour y parvenir ne sont pas toujours honnete.

Toujours est'il que vous aurez beaucoup de choix possible pour faire évoluer les choses à votre avantage (Si vous êtes près à en assumer les risques).

Parmis ces choix on à :
- Accelérer la progression technologique d'une race (en leur donnant des technologie ou en les aidant dans leurs recherches).
- Ameliorer les relations entre les races pour qu'elles soient plus enclin à rejoindre votre fédération.
- Détériorer les relations d'une race pour les isoler diplomatiquement (et qui sait, declancher une guerre).
- Attaquer et capturer un avant post spatial d'une race et le donner à une autre.
- Saboter les instalations d'une planete.
- Assister une planette pour améliorer son économie, écologie, santé de la population ou ordre publique.
- faire s'attaquer entre elles les races qu'on arrive pas à faire entrer dans la fédération (une race rayée du système solaire est une race de mois à faire entrer dans la fédération).
- Demander à une race de jeter ses déchets toxique dans l'atmosphère d'une planete ennemis.
- Et beaucoup (ennormement ?) d'autres choses encore...

Niveau Gameplay, on alterne entre plusieurs vues :
- Vue du système solaire ou l'on voit les choses de manière générale. Les planetes, les avant postes, la position des armadas de chaque race...
- Vue des planetes, avant postes et salle des dirigeant des planetes. Ce sont des menus dans lesquels on peut choisir d'agir en bien ou en mal selon nos besoin et selon l'aprécation que la race à pour nous.
- Vue de combat. C'est la partie action du jeu. C'est un mélange entre tour par tour et temps réèl.
Le jeu altèrne les phases de pause (le joueur choisis ses déplacements, armes ou compétences à utiliser parmis celles équipées, cibles sur lesquelles tirer), et d'action.

A very good game made by talented, hardworking, humble and just plain nice developers.

Plus they support their games for YEARS! that is indeed plural, 5+ for AI war now constantly updating, improving and expanding features for free as well as a yearly expansion pack that adds a mass of new content.

Now this may not apply to anyone else but me, but hey in case it does, I wanted to make note of it.
All that depth and strategy is great but in all the other games I've played they were also confusing as hell to get into.
Even the ones with tutorials are usually done badly and/or don't cover everything.

This game however was very easy to learn - but still has tons of depth to it.
Even better - they keep updating it and improving things all the time - even if the game wasn't updated all the time this review would still be positive, but would mention more cons, however they keep updating all the cons that I used to have so...

The game is difficult - or at least uniting a federation and winning is difficult. Combat itself is pretty well balanced I think.
you can dodge bullets like a bullet hell game (nowhere near as extreme though, which for me is a good thing =P)
and at the same time shoot out your own. There are different kinds of weaponry, and each race gets it's own unique ship with different abilities and weapons. If your bad at those kinds of things don't worry - I am too, but you can change how strong or weak you are in the difficulty settings, as well as the type of race you choose to crash land with (and use their ship)
It's turn based, which is really cool - since you can take as much time as you need for everything.

As of this review my pros and cons:

Pro:
Constantly updated.
Easy to learn, yet difficult to master.
Races feel very different from each other.
Customization up the wazzoo.

Right of the bat it should be said that the general concept is a twist on the old grand strategy formula of ""unify the world to win"" but excecuted in such a way that your character aren't a contestant among others as much as the one that decided that an ensured galactic peace is something to work for. As such your job is to first create the federation, and then persuade the eight races of the galaxy to join it.
Actually, it would be more prudent to say that your first job is to make the rest of the galaxy not hate you enough to actually listen to what you say :). You see, your character is an Hydral, a space-hydra that the game tells you subjugated the whole galaxy and basically made everyone cross with them on a level that made them exterminate the entire race, save yourself. And since the other races is as aware of this as you are (however repentant you may be) their general opinion of you will be colored by this the entire game.

The game switches between being a strategy game to being a turn based shooter in the same vein as critical mass, with focus on dodging enemy fire and proper weapon and ability management. For those who don't fancy this, an auto resolve function was recently added in, but aside from fights being somewhat repetetive the combat is a nice touch of thinky action that ends up feeling significant while taking up no more space than it has to.

Management of the different races opinion of you is key during the game. It starts out negative but can be altered to the positive through friendly actions, such as giving a race back the power of space flight, and altered to the negative again by doing things the race doesn't like, such as giving the power of space flight to a race they don't think should have it.
Thats the key challenge of the game, to keep building up influence by helping the races while trying not to burn bridges as you go.

The relations between you and the races however is only the one part of the puzzle. As you might expect, if helping different races can put you on the wrong foot with someone, then naturally that someone will probably not like that race autonomously of what you do. All the eight races will either with or witout your help eventually reach the stars, and when they arrive, they will start to develop relations to each other. Some races, like the peace loving Andor will often (but not always since every game can play out very differently) ally themselves with others enjoying peace, while more warlike beings like the Boarines will more likely attempt to conquer other races.
This is where you as the player comes in as someone who can make sure that the different demeanors a race is having will work for them and the final goal of a unified federation. For a federation to form the races must like each other enough to actually want to unify. They wont do it just because you ask them and as such the relations between races are just as important as the ones between them and the player.

So, how exactly do you make the races do what you want them to? Through the friendly and unfriendly actions mentioned before. The game provides you with a plethora of different ways to affect a race ranging from helping them research technology to improve living standards or military prowess to providing more hands on medical help if a planet is in plight. Doing actions like that will provide you with positive relationship points as well as power up the race in some way. But these are only examples of the positive actions. On the negative spectrum there are things you can do ranging between attacking the race head on to weaken them, to instigating coup or undermine the relations between different races -a needed tool as other foci of power can crop up to challenge your federation.
The actions will affect the different stats of the races and allow for you to guide a race to a higher power level than the others, make them ripe for conquest or just as a tool to make you more popular with them. And the popularity is needed for the last thing il talk about that allows you to suggest things to a race. Namely:

The actual governments of the race. Through them the player can suggest bigger changes than just the general assistance or misdeeds otherwise open as options and ask a race head on to do something for the player. A race can for example be asked to stop makin war on another race, or to focus their attention on getting their economy straight. It is also for the most part here that the player can ask a race to join or found the federation. This is where most of all the different quirks of a race is visible as the government they utilize differ greatly from one another. This demands the player to change the way they approach the races initially as some cannot be bribed and others require another set of in-game resources to allow you to suggest things for them to do. It also means that both before and during the time the race is part of the federation the skills they bring to the table allows for different ways to work around your enemies.
They can be acessed when you are popular enough for them to actually care for what you say but some actions require more popularity than others and these levels differ greatly from race to race.

I dont know, this kinda went on, but the point is that if any of this sounded appealing to you, then the game is worth checking out. For what you get, 20 money is cheap and during any kind of sale it is a steal. The devs have been working full time on patching and adding to the game since launch and have so im told a reputation of doing so on all their games. 
It is deap but easy to get into, hard to master and different every time. Combat and AI both feel like they are nailed down pretty good and the players choises are always at the center of the experience while they at the same time never take the cake from the eight races that act as both the pieces, the board and sometimes opponents in this game.

It's a game where a lot of care has been taken with it's development and mechanics, and it shows.

The Last Federation is a hybrid 4X strategy game developed and published by Arcen Games, most notably known for their AI War series.  It also serves as something of a counterpart to AI wars in concept: whereas AI wars was about carefully dismantling a much superior foe, The Last Federation is centered around you playing as the lone survivor of a race that subjugated the entire sector before one of the subjugated races uses a superweapon to wipe you out.  The central concept of The Last Federation is that while you otherwise have all the typical elements of a 4X strategy game, you don't directly control the civilisations involved - instead you must use diplomacy, manipulation, intimidation, your superior technology, or your superior firepower to manipulate the course of events.

In essence, you go to different worlds in your super-starship, deciding which races to uplift with spacefaring technology, how you want to help the ones you want to ally with, how to undermine your enemies, and so forth.  This takes the place of going to different worlds and stations and having several options of what you can do presented to you.  You can do all the standard 4X stuff, but instead of it being for you, rather, when you're helping research a technology, build an improvement, or do one of the many other tasks at the planet, you're doing that for the other race.  The benefit is furthering along a race you want as an ally, giving them better tools to succeed, with the ultimate goal of uniting the galaxy, by hook or by crook.

It's a different spin on that 4X genre, and to Arcen Games' credit, they've obviously put a lot of thought into how these mechanics will work in that context.  Tutorials are provided and go into just enough depth without the amount of babying hand-holding most AAA games do.  Most everything feels intuitive and easy once you get into the game.  If there's anything that's a little rough around the edges as regards that, its that sometimes the data pertinent to the given task at hand isn't presented in the clearest fashion.  There is a metric tonne of different things being simulated for each armada (unit), each planet, and each race at any given time, so it's a very dense amount of information to digest.  For the most part the game does an admirable job of giving you the directly pertinent information but sometimes there's related data that doesn't get displayed.  To give one example at time of writing, one of the tasks you can perform at a world is cleaning up space junk from battles, which clearly outlines what you get for doing so quite well, but what it doesn't tell you is how much space junk is up there - for that you have to go into the extended information of the planet and through dozens of detail fields to find the one that tells you how much junk is in orbit.  It's not a game-breaker by any means, but it makes more work for a player that wants to play optimally than is strictly necessary.

The tactical combat when you get into direct combat is reminiscent of a sort of turn-based SPAZ.  It works pretty well, although I would recommend if you want a challenge you kick up the difficulty.  I played on the normal setting and once you got into the tech progression it pretty much became a cakewalk.  One presumes, however, its more challenging on the harder difficulty levels.  Especially so since you can enable a ""permadeath"" mode whereby if that ship of yours gets blown up its game over.  (As opposed to otherwise, the game forcing you to flee if you get critically damaged.)

Production values of the game are good to high; as said prior there's a lot of thought that's been put into the game and that extends to the design as well.  Sound design is good, the soundtrack is very melodic and is something I'd even listen to outside the game as something ambient, and the graphics while 2D are pretty neat, especially the world background graphics which has hand-painted scenes.

A lot of heart went into this game and it shows.  Whether you like it or not will depend on whether that spin on the typical 4X formula agrees with you, but its worth the look and the purchase.  Speaking on a personal level, I think this game will be a contender for game of the year for me this year.  It's a really brilliantly-heartful and excellently-executed game.  Whether you love it or you don't, I doubt you'll find anything else quite like it.",1398354356,1398354356,True,30,0,0.667263984680175781,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are some issues with the game not really ""putting"" you in strategic situations which easily results in very simplified stat grinding instead of actually doing the whole strategy game thing. If you are willing to spend some time thinking and planning on more sadistic things, this game offers A LOT of depth.

Also in the beginning I didn't quite understand the concept of time in it. I felt like I had to hurry (because of how quickly some races ascend to space), but in actuality you have a lot of time to perform your actions. Putting 12-24 months in to tech research for example is only a fraction of time you will, eventually, spend in converting races. I would have preferred non-realtime related numbers for things. E.g. Relative time of 10 minutes for someone's ascension feels like you seriously have to hurry things up when infact it's a very long long time in game.

Enjoyable, but fundamentally flawed. The Last Federation is a game with a lot to offer, but feels as though it needs more patches to become what it really should. At present it swings between ridiculously easy (use the Acutians to dump toxic waste on some planets, murdering all but a million people there and bam, no more enemies) and absurdly hard/grindy (fight AFA insurgents on the highest difficulty, spend thirty-odd minutes fighting a tiresome, repetitive battle.).

The core concept is excellent, and the gameplay starts out good, but it's simply not well balanced. AI War's brilliance was in that the more you did the harder the enemies became to defeat. Conversely, TLF doesn't have some form of inherent balancing beyond the formation of non-Federation empires, which are easily defeated by using the native abilities of your Federation allies even if you decide to simply never engage in combat.

Where the game is enjoyable and clever, it's easy. Where it's hard, it's boring. Combat is so tiresome I've gone from playing on the highest difficulty to the second-highest to the lowest, simply because spending all my time carefully observing projectiles and maneuvering around them while staying just in range of an enemy ship, kiting it down and eventually blowing it up and repeating the process thirty or forty times is unenjoyable. While just clicking through combat until I win isn't stimulating, it's not any more boring than regular combat.

Despite all this, The Last Federation is a game with a tremendous amount of potential. The numbers need to be better balanced - it's too hard to impact some stats, and too easy to impact others, and some options are simply useless compared to others, but after a few patches, I believe it'll be a game well worth playing.",1398215199,1570411564,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1) This is not an original or new concept. Space Rangers and Drox Opertive both have the same ""rouge operative in a 4x universe"" gameplay - and they both execute on the idea in superior ways. Also note that this is not a sandbox or open-ended game – it has a very specific goal and nothing really to do but work for that goal.

2) The ""strategy” part: There is only 1 solar system and 8 planets. That is it. No exploration, no undeveloped planets, nothing to find.  Make sure you understand that. One single very small, crowded solar system is all there is to play in.  The gameplay revolves around running the same missions over and over to gain favor. The upgrades are very few and not impressive. You can’t get allies to give you tech, so if you want it you have to find someone without it and research it with them or, often, steal it from you allies. (edit: I understand this and other things are being patched in, but this is not an early access game and I’m going to judge the game I’m playing as it was sold and not what it might be in 6 months.) All in all, there is little or no grand “strategy” to be had.

3) Turn-based bullet-hell. The trick to a good SHMUP is control and the ship controls like a giant brick with a ton of inertia. More realistic maybe – but not conducive to dodging millions of bullets. Your abilities, heath, shield and ammo all automatically regenerate at the end of combat so there is not much depth to the “tactical” part. Actually calling this “tactical” seems disingenuous. Making something turn based does not make it tactical. It makes me really miss the turn-based fighting in Space Rangers. 

4) Simulation: Charts galore. Stats that influence nothing! It’s an amazing collection of information that is ultimately pointless as several other reviews have pointed out.  Super-deep political and economic simulations are great, but since gameplay basically boils down to influence and bribery the effect of those simulations are negligible at best.  The races are very different, but you use the same tactics on each one of them (i.e. running the same missions over and over for influence) so it doesn’t matter if you are doing it for space chickens or capitalist robots.  Also, I have run the simulation in observer mode and it just seems to end up in stalemate after stalemate. Not sure the A.I. is up to actually winning, but it’s great at providing endless conflict. I’ve seen planets be under “attack” for decades with nothing, literally nothing else happening in the universe. Also note that you will never just be “attacked” unless I missed something the only fights you will ever get in are the “missions” you choose to go on.

I know I have not played for 1,000 hours – and I would never review a true 4x game with this little time under my belt. But let me assure you that the few hours I’ve had are enough to show me how shallow this dish is. The scope of the game is so narrow and confined that everything just feels arbitrary and repetitive. Maybe with a great deal of work this could be fun – there is a foundation to build something great here; but this is not that great game.

This game was rushed out the door with serious issues such as: AI not initiating ground combat, Numerous typos like ""Peacekeeers"", Missing diplomacy options (Boarines have no option to join the Federation even with a Solar Unity regent), Broken special weapons, but I'll just leave it at that. A lot of this game just dosen't work, or has been band-aided to kinda work.

Still considering buying it? I suggest waiting until they release about a years worth of patches before jumping in or wait until it's on sale for $5.99. Otherwise welcome to paid beta.

This game takes ""Indie Game Sloppy"" to the next level. I like the concept, but the implementation and execution is horrid.

Drox Operative is definitely the closest analogue (another game I love) but the minute to minute gameplay between the two is entirely different.

There are some rough edges, but the polish level is up there with other Arcen titles.  Early support for it looks strong and Arcen has a great history of patches and add on content for their games so I expect it to only get better with time.

Strongly recommended if the idea of a living universe and/or turn-based bullet hell space combat appeals to you.

You can assasinate the leaders you don't like and provoke all kind of nasy things to push your dream of creating the federation (Like assasinating the borine leader will make them attack the race they hate the most.

You can decide to try to include all the races in your federation (very difficult, but doable) or only the races who gets along. You also have to help build the planets of your ally so that they get stronger and have more ships to invade and kick the butt of your ennemy races! You can also help with research or go steal research from your ennemies. The possibilities for backstabbing and diplomacy are endless!

You also spend much of the game in battle with your ship, which you can find new weapons and abilities to help depending on your situation (attacking planets, raiding cargo, destroying armadas, etc.) The graphics are no biggie but nice (the game is 400MB, which is insignigicant nowaday!)

There is lots of depth in a way, but most of it is irrelevant. Most of the gameplay just boils down to slowly getting opinion modifiers to grow. The most efficient way to play the game seems to be to just ignore most of the game mechanics. For example, in my current game I have two epidemics on two different planets. It's plunged the health meter to -40K and it's sinking by 100 every month. Vaccines show up as available tech in the tech list, but I can't actually start a research project with the affected race to unlock it. Despite this massive plunge in health, the races effectiveness doesn't seem to be hampered much at all, and the only real problem for them is that they have close to no ground power, but their space power is completely unaffected. 

The computer advisor also mentioned planetary bombardment at some point, but I've yet to find a way to actually do it. The other races seem to just kill themselves by throwing their troops at the Burlust homeworld meatgrinder. Solving anything in a military faction without having the Burlust at your side and space superiority seems very hard, and certainly not worth the effort. No, the far easier (and more boring) road is to just play the opinion slider game. After starting a federation it only took me about 5 minutes to get almost all the planets to join it by spamming influence tasks and giving away technologies. It's kinda weird that the game has so many mechanics and charts and such, and 99% of it is completely irrelevant and unimportant.

In addition it almost seems nigh impossible to actually lose the game in a legitimate fashion. The only things that have killed me so far has been fucking up a battle, rather than performing any overall strategical mistakes. As someone who has put more than 500 hours into Europa Universalis 4, I find calling this a grand strategy a huge insult to the genre. There is no strategic difficulty to be found here. The biggest (only) decision seems to be what order you want to do things in (which races to found your federation with). 

The game also seems to have its fair share of bugs. In addition to the epidemic thing I mentioned earlier, I was also trying to get rid of insurgents on a planet and it put me up against 90 ships. The race I had selected to help me didn't send anything. I tried again with different members of my federation, but every time I didn't have a single ally in sight when the actual battle started.

And then there's how a boatload of the game mechanics make no sense at all. Take technologies for example: You can easily convince a race to give away a tech (any tech) free of charge (for the other race, you have to cough up a few credits) to another race without any difficulty at all, but there is no way whatsoever to make them give or sell it to you personally. It's pretty retarded that someone who is literally worshipping the ground you walk on wont help you outfit your ship (forcing you to attack them for their technology if there is noone who can, or is willing to, research it together with you), but they will give away their national secrets to a competing country for just a few credits.

Bottom line, in it's current form this game just seems to be broken on so many levels. It's not fun, most of the mechanics aren't important, although they seem interesting, and they seem to be implemented extremely poorly (I'm looking at you, epidemics and unbeatable Burlust ground power). The only thing that is keeping me playing for now is the potential for what the game could have been. But that's not what it is. There is the possibility of the game being hugely improved down the line through patches and DLC, but as it is right now I can't really recommend it.

Edit: If you feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to comment on it in the comment section (click the ""Not Recommended"" text on the top of the review - it's a hyperlink). If there is something about the game you'd like explained which I haven't adressed, I will try to explain it if you ask (and if it's relevant for the full review, I'll put it here). If you think I have some factual errors feel free to point it out and we can see if we can clear it up. If you just disagree with my opinions it'd be nice if you didn't rate it as unhelpful, as a review is just a collection of such opinions. If you feel that something I think is negative wouldn't affect your enjoyment of the game (or the other way around), the review would still be helpful to you since it gives you information about it : )

---------------

Updates since initial review:

What's been patched to my knowledge: 
Testing during patch v1.002:
- You can now research techs with other races even if they already know the tech, giving you access to them without raiding. This seems to be a patchwork fix, though, as it thematically makes no sense that you help a race research something they are already supposed to know. 
- Races with incredibly strong ground presence are now actually beatable. I'm not 100% sure exactly what caused this change, but I'm assuming it's the other races actually using planetary bombardment now (because the races I saw attack the Burlust in my game should not have been able to beat them in a ground battle).
Example graph: http://snag.gy/WMgtB.jpg
The dip in the red/purple graphs is post-patch. Before that you can see the Acutians repeatedly dipping due to just being slaughtered over and over although the federation has complete space dominance: http://snag.gy/l84SR.jpg
Federation members are Acutians, Andor, Evuck, Skylaxians and Peltians. 

Testing during patch v1.003/v1.005
- While ground combat seems to be fixed now, space combat seems to have taken a trip to nonsense land. Here is a screencap from my current campaign: http://snag.gy/IGiJg.jpg
You can see the Acutians constantly sending ships to the Bovarine home planet, and in fact they have around twice as much total power on their planet right now (25026 vs 13332). Even so, the Bovarine completely annihilate the Acutian fleets over and over without any problem whatsoever. In fact, before that screenshot I completely wiped out all their ships with a direct assault and the Acutians started their ground assault while in orbit, but it took them literally seconds to kick them off their planet through their production alone from scratch. As the Acutians control 3 planets and have way better quality ones as well, this doesn't exactly make sense (not to mention their technological advantage). Illustrated in a power graph: http://snag.gy/Adp7z.jpg

- The devs have now implemented ""Federation points"" which more or less represent a races desire to join a federation. If anything, this implementation shows how this is clearly a beta product right now, as this is a completely new feature coming out of nowhere.

Additional complaints:
- Attacking anti federation insurgents is a horribly bugged mess. I once managed to get an ally to actually join me in the fight instead of sending nothing, and their ships turned up... hostile to me and allied to the insurgents. That said, combat is ridiculously easy on the normal difficulty, and I can kill a fleet having 10-15 flagships (you have one) and outnumbering me maybe 100 to 1 (counting medium/small ships) without diverting ANY power to shields. I'd play Ironman if the combat was skipable, but I'd hate to replay an entire campaign because of a single mistake in a combat (although it's easy, you can die fast if you mis-play with no power to shields, but play correctly and you should be able to kill a fleet of almost any size).

Anyways, this is apparantly around the max size of a review, so I can't really document further testing.

至少在AI War之后Arcen Games终于回来做太空策略游戏了，这次依然有着超级棒的想法，是一个玩家不进行4X而围观AI进行4X的游戏（如果你期待4X元素你就输了），在一个太阳系里面有着8个种族陆续进入太空争霸，但玩家并不直接介入竞争，仅仅是开着一艘小船四处周旋作为幕后黑手来操控局势，诸如帮某个种族获得科技、进行暗地里的破坏活动、煽动种族间的战争之类的旁敲侧击，即便玩家袖手旁观8个势力自顾自也会自顾自形成各种有趣的局面（游戏甚至提供了一个旁观者模式用来围观），而玩家的目的是联合所有还没灭绝的种族建立一个大联邦（于是不愿意合作的必须借助别人之手全部消灭），每个种族都有完全不同的政治形式和习性，需要用不同的方式来进行交涉才能说服其加入联邦

玩家也会亲自上战场，游戏中的战斗是同步回合制，每隔2.5秒算一个回合玩家做出一次决定，选择移动路径、武器和攻击对象，然后所有人一起行动，不过子弹移动缓慢而且非常密集需要规避，于是这其实是一款回合制的弹幕游戏……玩家只能控制单机，舰船自定义程度非常有限，主要是决定辅助能力和武器，玩家在一场遭遇中有若干有次数限制并且CD较长的辅助能力，诸如保命回盾或者召唤援军之类的，而武器和辅助能力都需要做任务或者在黑市随机获得。战斗方面只能说有人喜欢有人讨厌，我属于讨厌的那一派，感觉重复读过高，舰船美术风格也过于单一，好在后来制作人引入了自动战斗（在战斗中任意时刻都可以委托电脑立刻进行计算结果，玩家并可以选择是否接受这一结果，不满意可以继续手动打），对于我来说是一个很好的解决方案

势力操控方面玩家经常会感觉到在大局之下一人所能影响的事情相对有限，有时候感觉效果十分微妙，必须依靠蝴蝶效应来进行放大（也有人挪揄这款游戏的副标题应该是Chaos Theory - The Game，这导致了评价的两极化，媒体经常攻击这点），游戏的战略难度决定了各种不安定事件发生的概率和各个种族自发获得星际航行科技的时间间隔，在高难度下更容易爆发多方星际战争，很容易让局势变得非常混乱脱离玩家控制，玩家需要经常关注局势，在战争爆发初期尽快仲裁停战（如果不希望其中一个种族从星图上消失的话），避免势力间过度敌视以至于无法和平解决问题

如果仅仅是要达成胜利目标的话，在非极端难度下（在后期更新中引入了两个新的难度来方便大家自虐）上手以后应该可以再几小时中完成一局游戏，我觉得其实真正的难点在于尽最大可能操纵局面，让玩家想要存活的种族存活，想要灭亡的种族灭亡——比如去挑战游戏内成就，达成特定的胜利方式，比如最后只让一个种族存活、让全部种族都加入联邦、或者故意让反联邦联盟或者叛徒出现再把它们消灭等等，那么玩家需要一定的运气以及一个好的计划，游戏的策略性也主要体现在这里

8个种族（算上玩家种族就是9个）的个性塑造应该是最为成功的地方，加上插图和音乐都很出色，令人印象深刻，应该是AI War以来最平易近人的一作了，尽管可能依然难以被大众接受（媒体评测已经黑的够惨了，不过作为Cult向游戏依然拥有不少粉丝，Arcen也在不断修正问题），如果欣赏TLF的创意或者喜欢太空游戏的话，还是非常值得推荐的",1397920961,1402936160,True,62,2,0.835114836692810059,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Yet, it is not difficult to learn. The myriad mechanics are introduced gradually enough that the player will not become overwhelmed and can learn at a pleasant pace. Learn the basics of combat and missions before being launched into race relations, diplomacy, trade, and interplanetary balance of power. Be introduced to the finer details of the game as they become relevant, and even the intimidating series of graphs and charts are easy to learn and very intuitive. It won't be long before you and your Hydral avatar have mastered the art of bullying, bribing, and ""generously helping"" the alien races to serve your own ends.

That last statement was a bit false. Arcen's games are never easy to master, but this one at least is very easy to learn, and you won't find yourself frustrated by an unintelligible wall of statistics like many similar titles. Not that there are many, as TLF is an extremely unique and original game in and of itself.

In short, yes.  While I can’t vouch for the accuracy of the “numbers” behind the scenes (I’m still learning the game’s ins and outs), gameplay was smooth and rewarding.  The nice thing about “The Last Federation” is that you don’t need to fully understand the numbers to play the game…the game’s features can be learned while you play.  Granted, your chances of winning increase as you learn more about the math, but you can still influence races and shoot things down without it.  Overall, “The Last Federation” is an exceptional game and quite possibly the best one Arcen Games has released to date.  There’s a lot here for twenty bucks and I highly recommend that you at least go check it out.

The setup is original (you are a single mercenary pulling the strings behind the scenes to unite the system - instead of being one of the planetary powers of the solar system), the eight races feel fresh (there is everything from insectoid killers to communist barn owls and capitalist robots) and the combat model is just an ingenious creation that I am fairly sure has not been done before - ever.

Unlike most hybrids, however, this game could stand on its own for either genre.  

The Grand Stratetgy is deep, but for a new player the heavy details  are not necessary...but they are there if you are curious! Each of the 8 races you interact with are distinct and serve their owns uses both as allies and as enemies.  

The concept as a concertrated force influencing a dynamic galaxy is not common and very satsifying. You can swell up a (potential) ally race into an even mighter one, save a weaker race so as to distupt your enemies, completely shut down an enemy by yourself , or a variety of other things. It is very dynamic. You change the galaxy somewhat, but you also have to react to the galaxy's own logic. The strengths and weaknesses of each race is constant each game, but their combatablilty with their starting planet and when they become space faring means each game will have a different balance of power to start with. The result is each game is different.

When you take part in battles you enter the tactical turn based game. The mode can either be slow and methodical or fast and quickly depending on how difficult your parcticular situation is. It is enjoyable to devastate enemy forces if you manage to get a tech edge. If you fall behind...just use tactics. 

I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a mild interest in grand strategy games or turn based games. This game has the depth to be enjoyable for dozens of hours as is. The devlopers already say that they have a framework for years of expansions, (and even better, free content as well!)

Arcen's newest game manages to do this exceedingly well. I got into the open alpha fairly early, and so had a chance to watch this game evolve into the gem that it is now, and to be clear, this review is aimed at the final alpha build.  

In a normal game of TLF, you're an independant agent with the self-appointed task of unifying the system through any means possible. And there are quite a number of means to achieve this goal. Head of state being stubborn? Bump him off, the next will surely be more pliable... maybe. Entire race running amok? Pay another to crash a moon into their homeworld. 

The combat side of the game has changed quite a bit since its original inception, now resembling something like a turn-based shmup. Combat is, in general, quick and messy. Often, you're not really expected to defeat all comers, though don't let that stop you. An average combat mission involves you warping in, determining what needs to be done, then moving to accomplish your objective. If all you need to do is destroy a space station, why bother with taking out every individual ship and risking health loss or failure? 

With eight races, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, dispositions, and deals to make, things can get complicated rather quickly. A few will band together naturally, while most of the time each faction is pretty much out for itself. Of course, you have the power to influence this as well, and it's often necessary to get two races to work together to take on a much stronger foe. The amount of deals you're able to make is pretty staggering, ranging from simply killing pirates to smuggling freedom fighters onto a planet and starting a revolution. 

As a fan of simulations, I love watching the races squabble and toil in their sandbox solar system with Observer Mode, in which the player is now just a bystander watching everything unfold instead of actually doing anything. 

All said, I would recommend this game to any fan of strategy or simulation gaming. It does have faults, of course. Combat can be pretty tedious after a time, and despite the sandbox-y nature of the simulation, it does tend to unfold fairly similarly. Certain races, assuming they aren't gimped by a bad roll in planet generation, which is often the only factor that determines how successfull a race will be, will always become a major problem and have to be dealt with, invariably by wiping them out. I have yet to finish a game in which all eight races survive to the end. 

Arcen has proven again that they are a truly unique development team, making the game THEY want, rather than the game they think WE want.
