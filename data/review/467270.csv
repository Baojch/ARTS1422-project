The battles themselves are very straightforward with the only options being attacking in melee, casting offensive spells (all but one are just single target damage spells the are almost identical) or cast a heal spell.  That's it.  Your characters have stats that you can upgrade after winning campaign battles.  You can also earn gold from random battles where you use monsters from the campaign.

This is a weird game where you need to repeat campaign battles to earn enough upgrade points to win the later battles.  The same goes for the random monster battles so you earn enough gold to unlock the important spells for your important characters.  Through the campaign you unlock maybe 8 characters or so, but weirdly you mainly just use two of them in the campaign.  The rest just show up in 1 or 2 battles.

(Good but very short little game)

============

Review:

Weaves of Fate is a simple and very short turn-based RPG.

I really like its art-style - the pixel graphics look very nice, and it has pretty good music and sounds, too.

It basically tells a short tale about a demon invasion - you start with Thanatos (the reaper) and you get more party members as you play.

The mechanics are very simple, you just move once a turn and if you're next to an enemy you can attack once.

There are spells that certain characters can do - but its basically just a few elemental spells and a heal.

============

Besides being very short - it is also very easy. Probably one of the easiest games I have ever played.

Because even if you fail a mission - you can just go back to an earlier mission, win it and upgrade the characters again.

Not that you need to grind or anything - but this system just makes it easy for anyone, and the characters strength spikes quite a lot after each mission.

============

It's a nice little side game when you don't have time or inspiration to play any of the bigger games.

I bought it on sale for around 1 euro - is it worth it? Maybe - but its not worth the full price. If it was longer, had more content and levels then it might be - but like this, I'd say its worth that 1 euro I paid for it.

So if you want a very short and easy turn-based RPG - grab it from a sale.

Well, while there's a considerable number of titles available in the market, this one called my attention for two basic reasons: The graphics looked interesting and it also had a really affordable price. Now, what can I tell about my experience related to it?

So, the game offers this story that in the future, some scientists have found this ancient crystal, and while they were studying it as a new source of energy, yep, something bad happened (as you could easily guess), and now the demons came to this realm, spreading throughout time and etc. That said, the immortals decide to take action, and send Thanatos (a.k.a. Grim Reaper) against the fiends.

Being a turn-based sort of game, you can control your character(s) through the map, attack enemies and use spells against them. After you win a battle, you get experience points, which you can use to develop your party. Now, if you want to buy yourself some spells, you need to play the random battles, which comes in three different levels of difficulty; depending on the path you take, you can get more gold in the end.

As mentioned previously, the graphics look really nice, with some animations and everything. The music and sound effects aren't bad either; the gameplay is simple, and the levels are divided into different chapters. Now, I really don't want to spoil anything, but I feel that I really have to say it: That game had much more potential than what it was presented, especially when it comes to character development. The whole experience is way too short and it makes you feel like you're actually missing something when it's over.

The thing is – I [i]totally[/i] didn't expect anything good here. But guess what? I ended up loving this game. That's right, not just liking, [i]loving[/i] it. Maybe it's just because I'm old. I mean, the visuals remind me a lot of [b]Ultima VIII[/b] and [b]Halls of the Dead[/b], gameplay feels a lot like a very basic version of [b]HeroQuest[/b], etc. But the thing is - [b]Weaves of Fate[/b] doesn't feel like one of those games that try to make money from nostalgia. It doesn't have that cheap “[i]Hey, look! It's almost like real 8-bit![/i]” aftertaste. It is what it is. A cute little RPG.

The “little” part is a bit of a problem, though. Quite big, to be honest. See, [b]Weaves of Fate[/b] is another one of those “one man projects” ([b]BC Kings[/b], [b]USC: Ultimate Space Commando[/b], etc). Aside from soundtrack, it was fully made by only one person. And, unfortunately, it shows. Don't get me wrong, though, the main gameplay feels great. Too great, actually. Those basic but charming turn-based battles are the exact reason why I love this game so much. Those are so cute that you'll want to waste a lot of time doing them. Unfortunately, [b]Mr. Kingston[/b] (that's the name of our guy, [b]Thomas Kingston[/b]) didn't have enough time and resources to make anything else. As the result, the entire game is just that - a short (very, [i]very[/i] short) series of battles. There's nothing else. No world to explore, no dungeons to rob, no loot to collect, no quests to do, nothing. Zero. Zilch.

So, how do you at least level up in this game? Well, first of all, you go back to the level selection screen (you're free to re-play any previous mission any time you want). Then you select “random encounter” option. You finish one of those - you get some experience to increase your stats (no level cap here, as far as I know, so, you can become laughably overpowered as long as you're ready to invest enough time) and gold to unlock spells. That's pretty much it. There's nothing else in this game. You can beat the entire thing with every single achievement in about an hour and the story is also pretty basic. It has some twists and the atmosphere is sure there, but... it's basic. Very basic.

So, if you're expecting a proper RPG experience here... just keep looking. This game is a hour long series of basic old school battles and that's it. But the thing is – those cute little battles are so charming that it's almost impossible not to love this game. And since [b]Mr. Kingston[/b] asks only [b]$ 3.99[/b] / [b]£ 2.89[/b] for it... I'd say, it's totally worth it. You weren't born yesterday, you have an hour of free time and some change from your last meal? Check this game out.

Were it any more expensive than it is, I wouldn't be able to recommend it, because of how short the game is. It barely took me one and a half hours to play through the game and gain all achievements, so keep the short length in mind if you consider purchasing this.

That said, it's a good game following the gameplay style of Japanese SRPG titles such as Tactics Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics. You control a small group of pre-generated characters and fight out turn-based battles in tightly designed, hand-made encounters. The story is completely linear, there are no branching paths or even dialogue choices. The meat of the game is fighting through the battles and witnessing the story unfold after you beat each encounter.

As for the development of your characters, you get some leeway there. You can invest points into any stat of any character, increasing the health and attack of your sorceress instead of investing into her magic skills, if you want to go for unorthodox character builds. Every character has a handful of unlockable special abilities that add more tactical variety to the battles (heals, damage spells, etc).

You can also play through a bunch of random encounters if you want to squeeze more playtime out of the game than the main campaign offers. These random fights set you up with a random assortment of troops, facing off against a random assortment of enemy troops, rather than letting you play with your leveled up characters. They add some variety, but become repetitive quick.

There's also a New Game + mode where you re-play the main campaign at a higher level.

Other than that, there isn't much more to the game. A decent little turn based SRPG romp that takes you about 2 hours at the max. Since the game costs about 3 bucks, and even less when there's a sale, it's decent value for the money.

- J'ai bien aimé l'histoire et l'ambiance générale, ainsi que le style combat au tour par tour.
- Le character design des personnages est bien pensé (alliés ou ennemis, la patte graphique rétro est sympa)
- On apprécie suivre l'histoire avec les différents personnages principaux (qui sont loin de manquer de charisme!)
- La bande son est vraiment sympa (J'ai découvert Yui Hisaishi/Ora Chaya que je ne connaissais pas, et ses compositions au piano sont de toute beauté! Le Main thème est bien pensé, j'adhère totalement!).
- Les possibilités lors des combats sont assez limitées, mais on se prend tout de même au jeu (combat au corps à corps, magie...)
- Compter environ 3-4h pour terminer la trame principale, ensuite on peut jouer en difficulté maximale

- Evidemment il y a pas mal d'imperfections techniques, et alors? On voit que le developpeur a vraiment essayer de transmettre ses idées et sa passion pour son jeu (ça se ressent dans le titre).

Es un juego que no se hace repetitivo para nada, los escenarios cambian así como los enemigos y a más nivel más estratégico se volverá y más entretenido. 

La Banda sonora acompaña durante todo el juego, cambiando en cada escena y en cada batalla. La historia nos la pasaremos en suspiro, pero intentar completarla con todas las estrellitas nos llevará horas. 
Y los encuentros, poder cambiar de bando, elegir un equipo mezclado de buenos y malos, solo de demonios, o en solitario y probar cuanto duramos, es lo más divertido de este juego.

Su precio no es muy elevado, y además lo ponen muy a menudo de oferta, aparte de que como digo estará amortizado por horas de juego, a no ser que hagamos la historia y ya. Pero el juego te invita a más.

Since this game is really good, and for the pricepoint its not half bad.   For once the creators knew how to balance price point and gameplay!   This is an SRPG where in the future humans unearth a crystal that accidentally releases demons onto the planet, which are also sent back in time.   The story jumps around a lot, but your goal is to prevent more demons from coming through.  And since you can replay stages you essentially have an infinite number of experience points.  Which is helpful since at the base stats you have the later stages of the game are impossible.   


The reason for the neutral would be that a couple of stages (I think 3-2,3-3, and 3-4) actually cannot be perfected since the counters don't work properly OR that the requirements for the stage are impossible to accomplish.   In the one after the tavern with the slave camp the suggested number of moves to beat is 3.   This is impossible since even with max movement (move area is capped at 20 speed I think) you are 1 space away from being able to attack the enemies with Cain.   There are 3 enemies and they are spread out too far for Medea to hit 2 of them with one rain of fire, so the minimum amount of moves is 4.  One to move Medea and kill one demon, the next to move Cain closer, a third with Medea to kill another demon, and the fourth to have Cain kill the last one.

-Shallow combat, eventually battles devolve into a turn based attack competition without any strategy (No buffs, almost no crowd control, most spells are elemental damage spells and there isnt even a deep elemental weakness system to back those up)
-Broken progression system, you can become totally OP extremely easy BUT since characters are limited to certain stages you can also waste all your skill points on worthless characters and become unable to finish the story (maybe some grinding of optional missions can help you, but I doubt it)
-Broken economy, you can only gain gold in optional missions and those are RNG (the units you can control, the enemy units and all of their positions is random) so there is no reason to go for the ""easy"" or ""medium"" ones since the ""hard"" ones give you enough gold to buy every skill in the game early
-BAD UI (selecting ""move"" to move instead of clicking WHERE to move is bad)
-Needs more hotkeys (almost everything is controlled with the mouse or the arrows)
-Mediocre (but working) camera controls (2D game, no rotation either)
-Extremely short (almost 2 hours with grinding included, but it DOES have a NG+ option and some optional scenarios that can extend its playtime to I guess 4 hours at most)

IF you decide to buy it be sure to upgrade Cain, you could probably pass the whole game multiple times with no grinding if you focus all your skill points in him, and maybe upgrade Medea a little since she has the only Crowd Control Spell worth using.",1517339957,1517340791,False,8,0,0.639898002147674561,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are many interesting playable characters, but you soon realize that, despite their customization potential, they are ancillary. Only two characters are ultimately worth upgrading.

Since I awaited something like the old heroquest, I am a little bit disappointed about the lag of play depth. Nothing to loot? Maybe I didn't play so far, simply. But instead there is the upgrade-option, which I like. 

You can happily forget about the german translation (google translated?). Its a bit confusing, that the font changes with the language. But I don't care much. Its such an basic english, its totally understandable.
The stats could be a bit more obvious. You cant really compare, which enemy has how much power. You see how much HP and MP they have, but you have no idea if hitting them make them laugh or if one hit of them can crack your bones to dust. 

But what I am missing the most is a support for higher or at least wider resolutions / aspect correction. Would be nice to see the whole map if you have ""enough"" res.

Beside that I enjoyed the few minutes playing so far and am looking forward to continue.

Edit: sorry, but at all love I have for this little game, the system is too messed up for a thumb up. The Turn-counter does what it wants, but counting... the moves? ...the turns? ...the actions? ...the enemies actions? So it seems impossible to reach 3 stars. Why should one make such an efford anyway? 
Alltogether its so many little bugs, its frustrating. The game is playable and nice and everything, but you can forget about serious refinement.

Mouse support - Control is keyboard only (arrow key style), no mouse even in menus.
Mutiple resolution support - Windowed mode at a small resolution only. Cannot modify resolution or play full screen.
Display bug - When playing sometimes assets, like an enemy will not be displayed. Once this happens additional assets seem to go black. Currently I'm fighting a battle with only my party on a black screen.

It's also a bit pointelessly grindy, you can replay any mission you want as many times as you want to earn points. Those points can be used to increase the stats of any character. You end up grinding the same levels over and over to pump stats to keep getting 3-stars on missions. Go overboard and gameplay is pretty much broken.
