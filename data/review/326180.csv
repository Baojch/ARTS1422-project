My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1709685765,1709685765,True,1,0,0.4879494309425354,0,True,False,False,True,,,

El juego está bueno. Es mucho más breve que el anterior mencionado (lo jugué tres veces en 5 horas).

Además de ser más breve, también tiene puzzles muchísimo más simples. En sí, la dificultad avanzada simplemente te indica menos cosas.
La historia está buena, bien contada. A diferencia del Alchemy M., donde se respira misterio, esta historia es un poco más cómica. 
Quizá me gustó un poco menos, pero aún así me lo pasé bien.
Tuve un único problema, y es que cuando me lo estaba terminando por segunta vez y ya no me quedaba nada, se me bugueó un poco y no me dejaba hacer clic sobre el item que necesitaba.

For starters, you play as a male protagonist looking for his fiance, which is already somewhat rare in this genre. Even more rare is how deliberately goofy the game is. It's both a parody and a satire on vampire fiction, with lots of references to vampire books and movies. It's all rather tongue-in-cheek and breaks the fourth wall frequently.

The game is also entirely in 3D, except of course for the minigames and backgrounds, complete with animated talking. By the way, all characters voice-acted (and the voice acting isn't half bad either! It really fits the campy style of the game).
There are many hidden object scenes and only a few puzzles, but it's a great game for people who prefer to focus on ""look and find"" puzzles that actually have a bit of challenge to them.

The only downside is that the game is a bit janky. There are times where you have to leave to the menu then return to the game to avoid a glitch that doesn't let you click on anything. Sometimes, areas for you to search aren't immediately obvious unless you click around or play with highlights enabled. Also, I have played this game a few times and discovered that if I uninstalled the game, then re-installed it, all of my achievements are wiped out and I have to obtain them anew (maybe this bug has been fixed by now, however).

All in all, I recommend this for the sheer novelty and campiness alone. HOGs are often cliche'd, serious and cozy, but this HOG breaks the mould.

Game has both achievements and cloud save which is a plus.
It only has Easy or Advanced difficulties. 
It has VO and so far so good, Also, in case it wasn't clear at the beginning of my review, the game starts with a funny gimmicky intro, just so that you aware of the tone it is setting. 

The game has really easy/decent puzzles and somewhat okay HO scenarios, It also blends a slight point and click movement mechanic. 

For the price, this game is entertaining enough. As i mentioned, it is a bit cringe but I think that's what they were aiming for. I actually do recommend the game if only just for the giggles.

Сюжет игры рассказывает о приключениях Джона, который ищет свою пропавшую невесту Нину. Он узнает, что она попала в лапы злого вампира, который хочет жениться на ней. Джону предстоит проникнуть в замок вампиров, сражаться с их слугами, использовать разные устройства и зелья, а также обманывать и уговаривать персонажей.

Игра состоит из множества локаций, где вам нужно искать разные предметы и подсказки, а также решать логические задачи. Некоторые из них довольно интересные и оригинальные, а некоторые скучные и повторяющиеся. Если вы застряли, вы можете использовать подсказку или пропустить головоломку.

Графика игры неплохая, но не впечатляющая. Музыка и звуки подходят к атмосфере игры, но не запоминаются. Перевод игры очень плохой, полный ошибок и несоответствий. Персонажи игры не вызывают симпатии или антипатии, они просто выполняют свои роли.

В целом, игра “SINISTER CITY” может быть интересной для любителей жанра поиска предметов и головоломок, но не для тех, кто ищет захватывающий сюжет или качественный перевод. Игра не сложная, но довольно длинная. Я бы поставил ей 5 из 10 баллов.

Sinister city является представителем жанра point and click адвенчуры и имеет все вытекающие из этого характерные черты но и с небольшими особенностями.

Сюжет игры предоставляет возможность сыграть за Джона у которого случилось несчастье - его невестку украли ! Он не может сидеть сложа руки и отправляется в город в который по слухам  и увели его драгоценную Нину и который населяют вампиры . Сама история не является чем-то невероятным , а скорее комедийная и сатирическая а также  лёгкая и непринуждённая и следить за её развитием было приятно . Пройти игру можно хотя бы ради сюжета .

Графика в игре средняя . На full hd мониторе несмотря на то что написана дата выхода 2014 год была мыльноватость в фонах . Модели персонажей сносные и претензий нет . 

Механики игры стандарты для этого жанра - идёшь по сюжету , нужно что то найти , тыкаешь в место на экране и открывается это место но в приблеженном виде и там куча предметов которые ты ищешь а потом используешь на первом экране . Отличительна эта игра наличием карты по которой мы передвигаемся , возможностью направлять героя туда куда надо кликая по области и наблюдая как его моделька шагает то тут то там и наверное особенность в том что мы общаемся с персонажами в диалоговом окне .Помимо прочего игра оснащена режимом лёгким и режимом сложным ( за прохождение на сложном дают достижение ) и скажем так на сложном не так уж и сложно ну по крайней мере мне , хотя палки в колёса он может кому-то и вставит . Головоломки не представляют из себя что-то для гениев и мне это нравится - не сложные и не лёгкие . Игра полностью озвучена что также приятная деталь .Игра внесла нотки необычности в структуру своего жанра при этом не нарушив устои  игры и это приятно .

Музыка в игре ну достаточно приятная , но сильно не запоминается 

Игру на удивления проходил в первый раз почти 5 часов ( видимо и вправду недалёкий человек ) , а во второй спустя достаточно продолжительное время всего за почти 2,5  часа и наверное вторая цифра более объективна , хотя в любом случае игра даёт нам насладиться собой достаточное количество времени и при этом не надоесть растягивая продолжительность .

Игра переведена на русский язык сразу с стима и этол приятно , но как выяснилось в игре имеется и русская озвучка и её тут уже нет , но это не сильно портит впечатление и к этому можно отнестись спокойно если вы только не ярый патриот который будет проходить игры только с русской озвучкой)

В игре есть достижения и получить их совсем не сложно . Получить их можно спокойно и на первом прохождении . Однако есть нюанс - я удалил игру и скачал заново для прохождения на обзор и все сохранения слетели и вместе с ними и достижения ! вот с чем с чем а с таким я не встречался , но да ладно , получить их снова не составило особых проблем.

В игре имеются и карточки стим которые имеет довольно низкую цену , что порадуют тех кто собирает значки стим 

По итогу мы имеем :
1) Добротный сюжет 
2) Среднюю графику 
3) Неплохой саундтрек 
4) Несложные но и не лёгкие головоломки 
5) Продолжительность в 2 - 3 часа 
6) Наличие достижений стим , получение которых не составит больших проблем 
7) Недорогие карточки стим
8) Хорошую цену

Игра звёзд с неба не хватает и имеет достойный сюжет который поднимет настроение и задержит ваше внимание на как раз подходящее время  а наличие достижение для тех кто ими увлекается а также недорогие карточки стим  и приятная цена что по скидке что без ещё больше радует . Продукт достоин вашего внимания .

- Fast-travelling map;
- HO with various puzzles;

CONS:

Теперь поподробнее.
Сюжет. Sigh, вот тут как с Алхимиками, история неимоверно странного фильма, пытающегося в городское фэнтези, а в итоге получается что-то странное и непонятное. У гг украли невесту, и он, как доблестный рыцарь, едет бабу выручать. Но тут вам не песня Сектор Газа, пришлось нашему Джону встретиться не с одним вампиром, а с целым городом нечисти. Мне кажется, что если любимый человек вам врет о своей семье, даже если вы ему ""сразу не поверили"", то вы все равно хотите убежать от него в другую сторону. Нина потом сама признается, что чего только про нас не подумала, пока мы бегали туда-сюда, выполняя квест по ее же спасению. И в конце нас обращают. Такие вот дела.

Ляпы/несостыковки. Из самой игры столкнулась разве что с тем, что звук в диалогах порой подлагивает, ну да это скорее всего проблема совместимости. В алхимиках был черный экран смерти с пылью, в этой игре просто отключаются активные зоны на карте. Лечится баг так же, выход в меню и обратно продолжить игру. Герой порой зависал в воздухе у двери отеля.
Сама игра. Только прибыв в Зловещий Город и с горем пополам заселившись в гостиницу, мы просим помощи у дедули-клерка, который, вот сюрприз, как раз располагает механизьмой, способной помочь нам найти любимую. Как с этим связано подсознание - непонятно, это вам не Персона с ее Бархатной Комнатой, но еще непонятнее - почему детали от этой машины лежат в совершенно неподходящих местах. Ладно, это гибрид квеста и поиска предметов, тут и не такое встретишь.
Вернувшись из мира сознания, собираемся на вампира бочку катить. Торопимся, пакуем снаряжение, бежим к себе в номер за картой города, но нас тормозит режиссер-сосед, и мы, как добрый самаритянин, конечно помогаем найти сценарий. Видимо, режиссер еще и электриком в отеле подхалтуривает, иначе как объяснить то, что пара листочков находится в электрощитке? А, и еще пара на тележке горничной. Эх, и  мало же нынче режиссерам платят! Найдя сценарий, узнаем, что кругом обман, а на снаряжении написаны три заветных слова. Made in China. Отправляемся в замок отца нашей невесты, по пути починив подъемник, видимо мы нифиговый такой механик. В самом замке прямо на глазах будущего тестя варим зелье правды, которое он не распознал из-за сценарного чуда, идем отговаривать от свадьбы соперника Ипкиса. Помогаем и ему, узнаем что граф обращался к психологу.
К психологу попасть мы так просто не можем, сначала нужно прокачать наш скилл психологии. Но и книги рядом в ларьке мы не можем взять, потому что ""Меня можно много как назвать, но уж точно не вором"". Да, ты всего лишь подделал свою личность, чтобы попасть на киностудию (на секундочку, как охранник нам поверил?), украл чьи-то камни, чтобы обменять их на шестерню у низкополигональной вороны, насильно заставил Орлока рассказать тебе правду. Но вот за книги нам нужно заплатить. Так что мы идем воровать мелочь и ключ от почтового ящика, где лежит предназначающаяся кому-то книга по психологии. Но мы не воры!
Дальше следует диалог с психологом, которая видимо плясала лезгинку по всему своему офису, раскидала весь свой чай, дотанцевалась до мигрени, а нам все исправлять. Мда уж.
Идем к будущей теще, чиним ей кондиционер, порывшись в мусорной корзине у ее ног (представьте как это выглядит со стороны, да, вы сегодня спать не будете), устанавливаем ей бухгалтерскую прогу на комп, состоящую из какого-то эльфийского скрипта, варим кофе и завоевываем доверие.

You talk to several other characters. The dialogue was funny at times!  Good writing,  ""Where else would a blood sucker with the gift of persuasion work? - at a real estate agency in the Vampire State Building.""

You have a nice map to drive around on.  You'll know when you need to go somewhere.  

You have to click around to find the HOS. In addition to the objects in the list, you have to find a few specific items to, for example, fix something else at your location. So that means you have to go back and forth between the various HOS to collect them all.  The HOS will NOT close out automatically to let you know when you're done. If you think you're done, go to another HOS because you can always return.  They never become inactive.

This is not a scary game.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I relied on the hint button at first until I got the hang of how the game play worked.  The ending and ""out takes"" are hilarious.",1655503691,1655503691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hidden object game of 2014

Who would name their city Sinister City? Vampires of course! When John's bride-to-be is kidnapped by Sinister City's chief bloodsucker, there's only one thing to do - seek hidden objects and slay vampires! Or at least insult them until they give the girl back.

You can tell it's an old game. The graphics are mediocre and the gameplay is just so-so.
But technically everything works. The main focus here is on the texts and the story you collect, so to speak. The texts and the designations are full of puns and hidden allusions to well-known stories, films and companies. Quite difficult due to the nature of the game design and its implementation.
But everything is doable and you can skip the minigames if necessary. Still to be recommended.

[h1] Sinister City [/h1]
Wimmelbildspiel von 2014

Wer würde seine Stadt Sinister City nennen? Vampire natürlich! Als Johns künftige Braut vom obersten Blutsauger von Sinister City entführt wird, gibt es nur eines zu tun - verborgene Objekte zu suchen und Vampire zu töten! Oder beleidige sie wenigstens so lange, bis sie das Mädchen zurückgeben.

Man merkt deutlich das es ein altes Spiel ist. Die Grafik ist bescheiden und das Gameplay ist auch nur so la-la.
Aber technisch gesehen funktioniert alles. Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt hier bei den Texten und der Geschichte die du sozusagen ersammelst. Die Texte und auch die Bezeichnungen sind voller Wortwitz und versteckten Anspielungen auf bekannte Geschichten, Filme und auch Firmen. Ziemlich schwer aufgrund der Art der Spielgestaltung und seiner Umsetzung.
Aber es ist alles zu schaffen und die Minigames kann man Überspringen wenn nötig. Durchaus noch zu Empfehlen.

Bugs, yup, and glitches. To solve the bad stuff you only need to exit to menu and return to the game. No crashes. Runs fine on Win 7.

Overall, very casual. All the puzzles are no-brainers and you can skip them. The story is somewhat entertaining but not that good. It makes fun of the classic movies and books starring vampires. It's very short, so you can finish it in one sitting. It includes cards and achievements and is very cheap. If you want an easy time-waster for a single gaming session, this could be the one.

首先从游戏的视觉呈现来看展现出了出色的艺术风格。游戏采用了独特的暗黑画风，使得整个游戏世界充满了神秘和压抑的氛围。场景设计精细且富有层次感，光影效果的处理也非常到位，为玩家营造出了一个充满悬疑和恐怖感的城市环境。角色设计同样出色，每个角色都有着独特的外观和性格，使得整个故事更加生动有趣。

其次游戏的剧情设计非常出色。故事发生在一个充满罪恶和黑暗的城市中，玩家需要扮演一名侦探，逐步揭开隐藏在背后的真相。剧情发展紧凑且扣人心弦，充满了意想不到的转折和惊喜。同时游戏中的角色关系错综复杂，玩家需要通过与不同角色的互动来推动剧情的发展，这也为游戏增加了更多的可玩性和趣味性。

在玩法方面，同样表现出色。游戏中的探索和解谜环节设计得十分巧妙，玩家需要仔细观察环境、收集线索，并运用自己的智慧和判断力来解开谜题。同时游戏中的战斗系统也相当精彩，玩家需要运用各种武器和技能来应对不同的敌人，保持警惕并制定出合适的战斗策略。

此外游戏的音效和配乐也为游戏体验增色不少。背景音乐深沉且富有感染力，能够很好地营造出游戏所需的氛围和情感。音效处理也非常到位，无论是角色的对话还是环境的声音，都让人仿佛置身于游戏世界中。

最后从性价比的角度来看同样值得推荐。相较于其他同类游戏，它在视觉呈现、剧情设计、玩法等方面都表现得相当出色，而且价格也相对合理。对于喜欢冒险解谜和暗黑风格的玩家来说，这款游戏无疑是一个不错的选择。

综上所述，这是一款非常出色的冒险解谜游戏。它以其独特的视觉风格、扣人心弦的剧情和深入人心的角色塑造，为玩家带来了一场难忘的暗黑冒险之旅。如果你喜欢这类游戏，那么一定不要错过。",1640890471,1711463674,True,0,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

i've played a lot of hidden object games, and Sinister City deviates from many standards of the genre. the cursor never changes when it's over something you can interact with, which leads to a lot of aimless clicking just to figure out what you can actually do. it also has trouble starting in Windows 10 (there's a topic in discussions that tells you how to get around this) and is buggy in places, but restarting the game made it work again for me.

once i got used to it, though, i realized that its story is also unusual for a hidden object game - we know they tend to be cheesy, sometimes unwittingly so. but Sinister City revels in the cheese, yet doesn't try too hard, and has surprisingly good voice acting. it made up for my frustrations with the gameplay with an enjoyably camp experience. recommended if you like b-movie horror aesthetic that doesn't take itself too seriously.",1624322283,1624322707,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I enjoyed the independent vibe from it all and most of the character models actually looked alright, it feels like it had some effort put in and I appreciate it.

Tyto hry obvykle mívají i příběh, od kterého mám minimální očekávání. Příběh Sinister city je pro mě ale úplný dno. Je možné, že se tvůrci prostě jen netrefili do mého smyslu pro humor, ale za sebe musím říct, že by hře hodně prospělo, kdyby žádný příběh neměla a postupně by se procházelo od puzzlu k puzzlu.

Ruku v ruce s příběhem jdou i nelogičnosti řešení:
- Často musím najít 7 stejných věcí (např. ozubených kol), abych ve výsledku mohl použít jedno z nich.
- [spoiler]Přímo před upířím tchánem, který se mě chce zbavit, namíchám lektvar z pochybných ingrediencí a on má obrovskou chuť ho vypít.[/spoiler]
- [spoiler]John si nechce vzít noviny bez placení z držáku na noviny a taky nechce bez placení vzít věci z opuštěného stánku. Zvláštní, že nemá peníze, když si předtím kupoval v restauraci burger, ale ok. Peníze najde pod držákem na noviny (to mu už tolik nevadí), nechá všechny peníze ve stánku, kde si vezme věci. Dejme tomu. Ale pak nemá problém si vzít věci z držáku na noviny, který může ale nemusí patřit ke stánku.[/spoiler]

Brr, už se mi nechce na nic dalšího vzpomínat. Když k tomu přidám ne moc líbivou grafiku, ne moc líbivé animace a značnou nepřehlednost (např. hledání na místech, kde se hledalo dříve nebo nutnost při hledání předmětů něco nejprve odsunout, což vede ke zmatenému klikání na všechno), vychází mi jedna z nejhorších hidden object her, co jsem hrál.

I played through the casual mode with only one very minor bug that required me to go out to the main menu and then back in again.  I lost no data and all my achievements triggered correctly both in-game and in Steam.  The puzzles/games are definitely on the easy side.

The most unusual feature of the game is that HO ""scenes"" work differently than in most HOPA games.  In Sinister City, there are a few random objects that can be picked up as you go, but generally you are asked to perform a task (for example, fix an air conditioner), and then you have to search the area for the pieces listed.  The area can be as large as 2 screens with each screen having 2-3 places (boxes, junk piles, wardrobes etc.) to search.  The cursor does NOT change shape, which makes the situation more challenging.

I strongly recommend playing on Casual mode first, just to get a feel for the game, and because the sparkles for key features is important until you're used to the mechanics.  I disliked the way it worked at first, but later found it a nice change from the norm.  Each major area has at least one HO scene that has both a word list and objects from the ""task"". In each case, the word list must be completed to uncover the last of the missing task objects (which may be screws, ladder rungs, etc.).  HO scenes are suited to the location.

The game is actually quite funny.  As the story progresses, you realize that the whole thing is a satire.  While the humour doesn't always hit its mark, overall, it's not bad.  There are small homages to the genre (vampire fiction and movies) scattered throughout the game.

Overall:  Better than I expected, though clearly an older game.  I ended up being quite happy with my fifty cent purchase (it was 50% off in the bundle).

- The game assumes a 4:3 and will be stretched (distorted) to whatever display size you have.
- The game can be toggled to windowed mode, but the window can't be resized. (But you can force-resize it using some external tool, such as ""Sizer"" from ""Brian Apps"".)
- The game will auto-select a font size based on your display height or something. If it gets the font size wrong, you're stuck with very tiny unreadable text or with very large text that goes outside the game area.
- Similar to the font issue, the clickable areas might also be at the wrong location or non-working.
- The game will crash before the main menu if your steam display name has non-latin characters.
- The developers will not go back to this old game to fix or change anything. If the authors don't care, why should you?

Will this game work on your computer? That's a gamble.

If you manage to actually play the game, what do you get? Well, a mediocre hidden object game. Some objects are hidden behind others. How do you know you can move some of those objects? You don't! They look exactly like everything else! But after a while a ""hint spark"" will show up.

Eines der seltsamsten Spiele im Wimmelbild-Sektor, die man wohl spielen kann.

- Für ein Spiel von 2014 sieht es ziemlich furchtbar aus, vor allem in den ersten 10 Min, danach gewöhnt man sich schnell daran.
- Anfangs glaubt man auch, dass durch die klobigen Zeichnungen überall ""Bugs"" wären, z.B. beim Verlassen von John im Hotel. Ist aber alles nur optisch und da die Optik sowieso gruslig ist, passend zum Setting, who cares.
- Das Spiel ist mit 2 Stunden auf leicht (hatte erst schwer gestartet, aber nach 5 Min meine Meinung bei dem Farbmatsch geändert...) sehr, sehr, sehr kurz. Die markierten Stellen haben tatsächlich hin und wieder geholfen, sonst wäre wohl noch mehr Klicken und Zeit draufgegangen. 
- Die Story ist wirklich... individuell... im Kino würde man sagen, sie ist so trashig, dass es beinahe schon wieder gute Kunst ist. Überzeugt euch selbst davon. 
- Wimmelbilder und Rätsel sind mittel bis leicht. 
- Vertonung auf Englisch passt, Übersetzungen sind solide.

Fazit: Mit Sicherheit nicht das Beste Jetdogs Spiel, aber aufgrund des offensichtlichen Alters durchaus akzeptabel. Wer das Game irgendwo gratis dazu bekommt, kann ruhig die 2 Stunden Spielzeit in Kauf nehmen.

+60FPS
+Purposefully cheesy
+Easy story to follow

[b]Cons[/b]
+Buggy
+Short! (under 3 hours)
+Needed a better PC port

Sinister City is a purposely cheesy, bizarre and short hidden object game. The story revolves around your fiancé getting kidnapped by a vampire and you must save her. In your playthrough, you help a character with a task (fix an air conditioner, find tea bags, find floppy disks, etc) and then you can progress the story. Rinse and repeat. 

First off, you can clearly see this is a mobile port. Not a negative, but there wasn’t enough work put into the PC port. During the HO scenes, the clickable area for an object is big. There is also no click penalty for spamming the screen. Most likely leftover remnants from just “tapping” on your tablet or phone. 

The game knows it’s cheesy. It has bad jokes and terrible voice acting. However, it has a charm to it that I liked.

Echoing the other reviewers, this game has some bugs. Luckily, I only encountered one. After putting the clock together, I couldn’t click anywhere to go. The fix is to simply exit to the Main Menu and Continue your game again. I also had 1 screen where a while box appeared instead of an item. 

The HO scenes themselves are ok. I would say they are of average detail but most scenes are washed out and dark. The items are generally easy to find. One big issue in the scenes is that there’s no cursor difference when hovering over an object that moves. For example, a typical HOG will switch from a pointer to a hand to signal something you can interact with. In Sinister City, this doesn’t happen. So, you end up clicking around on all the major objects on the screen until one of them slides out of the way to reveal what you were really looking for. 

The puzzles are not very challenging and are all self-explanatory. 

The graphics and sound are below average and look pretty dated for 2014. I did enjoy the actual 3D modeling though. Typically, hidden object games are just 2D.

I can’t help but recommend this game, even at a 5/10. It won’t take up much of your time and you’ll get a laugh or two.

Багов, как-то влияющих на игровой процесс я не заметил, саундтрек не впечатлил, ачивки получаются за одно прохождение.
К покупке можно рекомендовать как идеальную игру на вечерок=)

[h1]Сюжет.[/h1]
У нашего героя пропала невеста, да не кабы где, а в городе вампиров. Придется теперь спасать любимую из лап кровососов, ну а попутно узнать тайну её родословной, познакомиться с Люмьером и снять фильм.

История здесь по сути сатира на фильмы про вампиров, с разными приколами типа осиновых колов сделанных в Китае, вампиров с кризисом 500-летнего возраста, и прочее в этом духе. Есть довольно забавные гэги, но в целом на 3-чку сюжет, скажем вежливо.

[h1]Геймплей.[/h1]
Реактивные псины решили извратиться и сделать ""ищуху"" с видом как у point`n`click квеста. В итоге получился стремный мутант. Персонаж любит выходя из здания высовываться наполовину из двери в полуметре от пола. Почти весь игровой процесс заключается в схеме - поговорил с персонажем - пошел искать 10-20 одинаковых предметов на сценах поисках, попутно разбирая мусор на этих сценах - сдал предметы - решил пазл - повторил. Выглядит это все нудновато и в целом не очень. Одно прохождение на эксперте - 2 часа от силы, ибо пазлы тут примитивные, сложнее найти точки сцен поиска, ибо расположены они по дурацки.

[h1]Графика и звуки.[/h1]
Для point`n`click`а все выглядит так себе. Для ищухи... В общем вместо адского гибрида лучше бы разрабы сделали что-то одно жанрово-определенное. Музыка норм, озвучка такая что хочется выпустить кровищу актерам озвучивания. 

[h1]Как итог.[/h1]
Не сказать что полное г., но очень слаба для жанра и тем более для Реактивных Псин. Обычно они делают годные вещи. За неимением знака со средним пальцем, палец будет вниз. Лучше сыграть в нормальные их ищухи.
5 киношных кровососов из 10

[h1]The name is sinister, but is this game?[/h1]

[i]Sinister City[/i] is a pretty basic hidden object / point-and-click game that one could assume is horror from the get-go, but in reality, it's more fluff than snuff and is well-suited for all ages (that's how light it is).  The whole goal is to find a way to free your fiancee from a vampire...but with an interesting twist that will throw you for a loop and (at that same moment) throw all elements of horror out the window.

The hidden object portions are decent, but the point-and-click areas don't feel too refined.  The areas look good, but the character models often behave like things you'd expect from a Unity made title.  The models themselves look fine, but just behave primitively.  Though, my biggest complaint is the achievement system which has one element to listen to every piece of dialogue (you cannot skip even when they're one syllable away from finishing...or even before they finish their breath) and all achievements are tied to your playthrough.  Meaning that if you load up a new file, all your achievements will be wiped.  But if you load up your old completed file, you'll be instantly granted all your achievements again.  Keep that in mind when hunting for achievements (that said, if you're hunting for achievements, you should boot it up on the hardest difficulty to avoid this frustration of replaying the game multiple times).

In terms of difficulty, this game is actually quite simple.  Though there are a few slightly frustrating areas in terms of puzzles while some objects feel well hidden.  If you end up getting stuck, there's always your local YouTube, but the solutions are simple when you figure them out.

Basically, I enjoyed a fair chunk of [i]Sinister City[/i] and only hesitate to replay it due to that achievement bug that ties all of your Steam achievements to a single playthrough.  If that sort of thing bugs you, you might want to avoid this game.  But if you do end up playing [i]Sinister City[/i], you'll be enjoying about 3-4 hours of a hidden object / point-and-click game.  Speedrunning takes about 60-90 minutes (if listening to all the dialogue), so....really you're looking at about 1-4 hours of gameplay with this title for only $1.  A fair price for what you're getting.  I recommend trying this one out.

6/10  A well-made game, but in need of quite a bit of refinement and a few personal edits.

I thought that the story alone was definitely worth at least the 49 cents I paid. Your mileage might vary as to whether you find the story funny or just stupid, but either way, the game isn’t scary and it isn’t meant to be taken that seriously. Some people had trouble with glitches, but I have Windows 10 and I didn’t have any problems running this game and getting all the achievements. 

The gameplay is mainly two different types of hidden object puzzles. The first type is the hidden object list where you get a list of objects to find on one screen. This seems to be the most popular type of hidden object puzzle. The second type is fragmented objects where you have to find fragments of the same object scattered in different rooms. For example, finding all the pieces of a broken mirror. This part is like a point and click adventure. I think a good hidden object puzzle should have objects that you can actually spot if you look hard enough. Unfortunately, some objects were covered by other objects. I recall that one object was hidden under a hat. Technically, it was “hidden”, but I think it would be more accurately described as “covered.” If I have no reason to suppose that there is anything under a hat, then it’s not a fair puzzle and just becomes a game of “find the hotspots.” Fortunately, the easy level has sparkles to show you where an object might be found if it is covered. The sparkles even indicate if you should go to another room. This might make it too easy for some, but I actually wanted to find out how the plot was resolved. I finished the game twice. First on easy, then on advanced in order to get the last achievement. I’d recommend that order if you’re trying to get all the achievements.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es ist ein sehr simples Hidden Object Spiel wo wir Gegenstände finden und zwischendurch mal ein Minispiel lösen müssen, die ebenfalls sehr simpel sind. Die Draufsicht wie man sie in Point & Click Adventuren kennt ist hier total unnötig und man hätte es genauso gut in der First Person Ansicht machen können weil wir sowieso nur Wimmelbildszenen und Minispiele lösen und keine Objekte kombinieren oder sonst irgendwie typische Point & Click Sachen.

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 17 Erfolge. Man bekommt alle sehr einfach in einem Durchgang, wenn man das Spiel im Fortgeschrittenen Modus spielt, keine Hinweise benutzt & keine Dialoge überspringt

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Musik OK
+ Voice Acting OK
+ Sound OK
+ Günstig
+ Sammelkarten
+ Achievements

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein Kurzes Mittelmäßiges Hidden Object Adventure, aber für den Preis von 0,99 Cent kann man sich nicht beschweren

cons

- game is little bit buggy. Sometimes you have to exit to the main menu and re enter the game to be able to proceed. 
- often times it is not really easy to spot which areas on the screen are accessible and hidden object scenes.
- when you complete finding items in a scene (when you found all objects) there will be no indication that there is nothing left to find.
- Some glitches (floating characters on pre rendered graphics)
- game is short
- The game seemed to have very little polish 

overall, this game is a mixed bag.  it's not easy to decide whether to recommend this game or not.  I don’t think it’s a bad game but not good game, either but I would recommend Sinister City.

""Sinister City"" is a really weird experience. It took me about 15 minutes of ""What the ____?"" situations before I realized, ""Oh, they are trying to be funny!"" Once I shifted my frame of reference from ""A crazy person made this game."" to ""Whoever made this game tried to make it humorous.""  I was able to just accept the weirdness. It did not make me laugh, but at least I understood the attempt.

This is not a good entry into the hidden object genre because there is no penalty for blind clicking. In fact, you will need to do that on many scenes to shift things out of the way so that you can access concealed objects. The puzzles are slightly better than the hidden object scenes, but are still among the simplest in this genre (and that is saying something). It almost feels like this was supposed to be a kind of ""Monkey Island""-esque comedy adventure game but the budget got cut, so the scraps from the pre-alpha were turned into a hidden object game at the last minute.

I will recommend this for hidden object game players who like weird, goofy humor. It is a complete and functional game that should give casual players a few hours of simple diversion. I found no bugs and encountered no crashes. The achievements are easy to obtain, but I am not sitting through this again to get the one I missed - not skipping through the dialogue.

Обычно в подобных играх, не обращаешь особого внимания на оформление, больше всего интересует сюжет, а все остальное, для меня лично, уже на второй план отходит, джае те же самые головоломки. 

[h1]Сюжет[/h1]

Здесь он, ну очень короткий. Подано оригинально, интересно, даже  с неким юмором. Обыгрывается проблема отцов и детей. Подано в мрачном стиле, но все сделано в легких тонах хеллоуина. 

[h1]Головоломки[/h1]

Тут они очень легкие и простые, но не скажу, что не интересные. Если бы сюжет не на 1,5 часа был, а хотя бы на 3-5 с такими же головоломками, то вообще все отлично было бы. В основном здесь поиск предметов, но все очень хорошо обыграно.

[h1]Достижения[/h1]

Получить все достижения можно за два прохождения. Одно на легком уровне сложности, другое на сложном. Что я собственно и сделал.

[h1]Минусы[/h1]

Короткий сюжет, хотелось бы более серьезную, мрачную атмосферу, в принципе, все. А, нет, есть еще один нюанс со стабильностью. Иногда придется перезапускать игру, потому что бывало, не реагировал на действия персонаж, либо резалась картинка и вместо некоторых предметов были белые квадраты или прямоугольники. Так же не все в порядке с 3D моделями персонажей. Не корректно отображались на локациях в некоторых местах. Но особых проблем или испорченного настроения я не получил.

[h1]Купить или пропустить?[/h1]

Если вы не играете в сложные игры или приходите с работы уставший, как собака, то расслабиться за этой игрой у вас вполне получится. Даже если какие то моменты заставят вас, вдруг, задуматься или поставят в тупик, то на легком уровне сложности вам всегда подсветят, что нужно делать и разумеется клавиша помощи так же работает. С очень короткой перезарядкой. Если вас напрягает одна из головоломок, то через определенное время ее можно пропустить полностью. Все как всегда. 
Люителям казуальных игр, если вдруг пропустили данный продукт, рекомендую к ознакомлению. Для всех остальных, если вы не понимаете такие игры, то можете смело проходить дальше. Для вас это будет слишком нудно)

TLDR: Broken hotspots and stuck progression. Cannot leave scene early game. Ruins a cheesy but polished haloween game with easy puzzles and hints.

I was kind of mentally riffing on this game on easy mode, trying to zoom through it as fast as possible to see the content. Was kind of surprised by how closely it ressembles a point and click adventure game. With a character model walking around, some voiced dialogue and surprisingly polished visuals. The hidden object scenes did not ask for too many items at once, the hint system recharged fast and had a funny Looney Tunes type sound effect when activated and you could literally machine gun the screen with clicks with no penalty.

Was a nice change of pace, the really cheesy writing had zero credibility but also helped give the game some charm. Unfortunately very early on while I was still being ushered in the Hotel by the clerk, I got teased by a vampire that I would be trapped in the dreamworld and even though the engine would flash at which hotspot I had to activate next, and the hint system was still functionning and showing me items within that hotspot I had to go fetch, the game would not register the activation of said hotspot.

I could not click any other hotspot either, or click to navigate to a different screen even though there were other ones that I had previously been to and had been going to and from back and forth. The game was not frozen either. This was at the - Repair the Mirror- objective.

As such the game is more or less unplayable, and even if it did work, the novelty of the cheesy writing would had eventually run off and the puzzles were not engaging enough despite some occasional trippy looking scenes to really warrant soldiering on. With the bugs on top this makes it a no brainer.

I've played better ones but on the other hand it's only 99 cents, making it one of the cheaper HOG games out there. 

The longer I played this game the more I liked it. Sinister City has a quirky sense of humor mixed in with a Vampire B-movie satire type story which kept it fun.

 The narration is done alright along with the sounds and music. The graphics are fine, not great, but good for the price. A minor point is that I could not change the screen solution to 1920x1080 which didn't help the graphics of the game. So I suggest playing it in windowed mode on wider screens.

The hidden object items are pretty difficult to find, sometimes the items you are looking for is really hidden too well (black item in a black background) or sometimes badly described giving it an extra level of difficulty. 

Also when you complete finding items in a scene (when you found all objects) there will be no indication that there is nothing left to find, while later in the game you even have to   backtrack to the same scenes to find more items. So that adds another little level of difficulty. Good thing there is a hint button. The other puzzles are pretty straight forward and fun. 

If you are new at Hidden Object games I suggest you try another easier HOG game first. If you play HOG's 24/7 this one will give you a good challenge.  

All in all, it's a good game for 99 cents with about 2 to 3 hours of fun, depending on how often you click that hint button. 

Good
+ Cheap (especially on sale)
+ Finding some items are challenging
+ Good narration
+ Fun B-movie story
+ Achievements
+ Steam trading cards 
+ 2 difficulty modes

Bad:
+ Cannot change resolution
+ Some glitches (floating characters)
+ Some puzzles could be more difficult


15 minute gameplay so you get a good impression of the game:

Dracula though has long since been overused making appearances in books, movies, and HOGs probably somewhere around the thousands at this point, so it was nice to see him in a different role for a change. This combined with the game's cheesy jokes are what tipped this review to the more positive end for me, because lord knows after I encountered a game breaking bug about a third of the way through the game during a cutscene of all places I was ready to hit that dislike button so freaking quick. I didn't though, because this game's unique twist, dad jokes, and poorly dubbed dialogue made this game memorable for me.

Очередное готическое творение от именитой компании [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Jetdogs%20Studios]Jetdogs Studios[/url] - на этот раз это [b]кликер[/b] с элементами [b]Поиска предметов[/b]. Являясь одной из первых самостоятельных игр данного разработчика, она вобрала в себя кучу почивших условностей и допущений, которые в нынешних представителях жанра с огнем не сыщешь. Управление за персонажа с видом сбоку, искомые элементы в сценах поиска, исчезающие только группами, взаимодействие интерактивных объектов друг с другом, присутствующее здесь лишь для галочки... Всё это в совокупности выглядит достаточно самобытно и нетривиально.
[b]Сюжет[/b] повествует о [u][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1283878921&tscn=1517113497]юноше Джоне[/url][/u], желающем спасти свою суженую из лап самого графа Орлока. Этот граф примечателен тем, что является главной звездой шедевра немецкого экспрессионизма - немой черно-белой картины ""Носферату: Симфония ужаса"", вышедшей на экраны в далеком 1922 году. Логично, что и действие данной игры разворачивается примерно в то же самое время - в эпоху нуара и винтажа, неоновых вывесок, жутких отелей, прокуренных офисов, обставленных дубом и тусклыми лампами, а также классического кинематографа - с его студийными павильонами, прожекторами, хлопушками-нумераторами и театральными декорациями. 
В распоряжении у нашего персонажа имеется яркая живописная [u][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1283878728]карта[/url][/u] для комфортабельного перемещения по четырем основным территориям - отелю, киностудии, замку Орлока и Вампайр-стейт-билдингу (отсылка к известному небоскребу). 
Угловатая и архаичная трехмерная [b]графика[/b] показалась мне неуместной. Кривой [b]интерфейс[/b] с допотопным [b]управлением[/b] (когда любое случайное нажатие на экранное поле сопровождается знаком ""Х"") может вызвать лишь отторжение у более взыскательной публики. [b]Музыкальное сопровождение[/b] с печальными отголосками идиофона и рояля едва различимо для слуха. Ну, и под занавес стоит отметить злосчастную цикличность сцен поиска в совокупности с примитивным линейным сюжетом и маленьким хронометражем. Однако при этом большинство мини-игр вызывали во мне лишь азарт и восторг.
А еще в игре имеются карточки, русскоязычная локализация и невеликая стоимость. При этом почти все достижения являются сюжетными, остальные же зависят от заданного стиля игры.

[b]Вердикт:[/b] Как и в случае с [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/alina_nomie/recommended/396790]обзором на Dracula`s Legacy[/url], я поставлю игре положительную оценку. Однако это решение довольно условное и номинальное, поскольку в [b]Sinister City[/b] имеется куча престранных и неприятных вещей (включая единственный баг, который я отыскала в самом начале). Также благодаря зловещей и жуткой фигуре антагониста я настоятельно не рекомендую игру к приобретению лицам младше 10 лет.

The basics of these type of games aren't here. The cursor doesn't change so you're can't be expected to know where things are. On Easy, a sparkle with show you interactive/HO areas but I have no idea when that happens. Things are shrouded in darkness (and/or blurry) that even moving my head around didn't help. Some objects were miscolored too. HO scenes don't close when finished. Some interactive objects only work when you've progressed the story but I'll let that slide.

I discovered there [b]are[/b] hints available but they're never shown that they are a feature. That glowing question mark in the bottom-left corner was just background noise to me.

It's both terrible visual and GUI design.

Incomplete clues are present. (Musical) note and (Paper) clip being in the same scene.

You can skip the credits but not the stinger.

I can only hope the bad acting and story were played for comedic effect.

Also, I get ""Tap anywhere to continue"" prompts which makes it seem like a mobile port.

BUGS! Five times this happened: HO scenes close everytime you click the mouse. Two of which didn't even load in properly! Restarting the game will turn everything back to ""normal"" 

PROS:

Are you a fan of Hidden Object games? Then yes... but approach with low expectations.
If no, then don't.

This game's story is charming to an extent though a bit too silly to be taken serious at certain points.
The game itself is buggy, your character walks around on top of the background even when he shouldn't, one of the achievmentes involve not skipping a single line of dialogue which is impossible at certain points since you have dialogue that plays without warning during gameplay sequences.
The artwork is decent though items are sometimes hard to notice on the scenario. The low poly models are not distracting and add to the overall theme of the game.

And one of the worst things in this game that you start without knowing where to go, what to do, and when the hidden objects scene starts and when it should end! You have to click 'back' in each scene once you are done from it, and perhaps you are not even done so you'll have to go back there and search for more. I've encountered different glitches during my gameplay too.

Pros:
+Fast travel map.
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
-Bad story
-Bad graphics.
-Bad music (it gave me a headache, especially the main menu music made me really dizzy!)
-Very bad and cheesy dialogue, none of them made me laugh.
-Bad ending.

Sinister City, as of writing this, has mixed reviews.  That, I think, is atrocious.  The whole premise of the game is so delightfully absurd that it becomes hilarious.  It does not take itself seriously in a world where hidden object games seem to take themselves way too seriously.  The voice acting is bad, and the settings are weird.  Nothing quite makes sense.  That being said, this game is clearly meant as parody.  It's so bad it's funny-- does that make sense? Sinister City embraces the cliches of hidden object games and the vampire genre and mocks them.

They can be too hard, they can be too dumb (it's true), they can be too rough, and so on. I've played plenty of games that were perfectly good at what they wanted to be, and what they wanted to be was bad. Sinister City is the opposite, in a way. It wants to be dumb and goofy in a charming way, and it would be, if not for being genuinely bad on the technical side.

You play John, a regular joe who looks a little like Tom Cruise with a painted on short-sleeve button-up and tie. His girl Nina gets whisked away by a vampire to Sinister City, an actual fucking place full of vampires that everyone is totally okay with for some reason. After getting his bearings and some vampire hunting tips from the melon-headed veteran, John makes his way into the auspicious burg to wrest his fiancee from the clutches of the undead.

It's nowhere near this epic, mind you, and that's a good thing for once. Whatever you're expecting of Sinister City is going to get upended because the story is acutely aware of its absurdities and tries to top itself constantly. Within minutes of starting the game (spoiler alert I guess?) the kindly hotel manager assembles a mystical hypnosis machine that sends you to the astral plane. To defeat the villainous vampire you'll need the help of his real estate agent wife and his therapist. There's a vampire Teletubby. And all of this is spilled on you not with a wink and a nod, or awkward tryhard dialogue, but with some refreshingly earnest humor and a willingness to just roll with the weirdness.

The reason I'm telling you all this up front is because despite the solid kookiness, you really shouldn't play Sinister City. As wonderfully campy as the story ends up being the gameplay cannot sustain it, and the technical issues just demolish what's left. The hidden object scenes here are a combination of the genre's worst habits: You can only seek five items at a time, you have to move completely unmarked objects to get at things behind them, the scenes themselves are hard to spot and tend to be in strange places, and you have to do them multiple times until you find almost every single item. This means that scenes are incredibly easy as long as you're randomly clicking on everything, which is the only way to find the movable objects anyway.

On top of that, you need to find multiples of items across multiple scenes or areas to get inventory items to use on NPCs or puzzles. These can be hidden anywhere, including hidden object scenes for OTHER items, and you get no indication that you've found everything in a given scene. Plus, you can't even pick up obvious items until you trigger the dialogue telling you to get them! On top of all this, some scenes are misaligned graphically which make it super hard to click the right things, and some objects blend far too well into the muddy backgrounds.

The amateur-hour graphics don't do Sinister City any favors either, with inconsistent 3D models and some incredibly blurry backgrounds. I must admit, though, the sound design is decent and features some nice, campy voice acting and appropriate music. But it is clear this was a mobile title first, with a lack of options and plenty of ""Tap here to X"" prompts. It wouldn't take you more than 90 minutes to beat even on the harder mode, so as decent as the story is in its goofy way, you're better off staying far, far away from Sinister City.

Clunky interface.  I had some buggy issues in the start of the game.  Disappearing graphics (like whited out boxes in some parts of the 'hog' scene) and when I was in a 'hog' scene at this part not long from the start every time I clicked on an item it would go out of the 'hog' back to the scene and I had to keep clicking back and forth to finish.  
I fixed both things by just going to the main menu and back in the game but at first I had to do it a couple of times.

After that I didn't run into any more buggy stuff like that.

Graphics are a bit clunky.  ( older game though)

 I didn't take this game to seriously and just played it for something to do. 

 The game is  short.  I think it says I played for 2hrs but I'd say you can finish this in less then that.  Those times are reflecting me trying to figure out what was going on with the bug parts and leaving game up when I afk'd so this is a really short game if you play straight through.

Humor is rather silly though I laughed a couple of times because it was so campy.   Dialog a bit corny and over the top and not particular well acted.  One vampire had such a terrible voice but I think that's supposed to be funny because [spoiler]he is an actor in a children's show. [/spoiler].

There is one voice I know I have heard before, he's an actor and that voice is unmistakeable however I can't place the name.  I didn't wait to read the whole credits so I may just look that up.   It's kind of fun to hear a recognizable voice in games. 

The Hogs, nothing special, kind of silly and uneventful.   Puzzles? uhm not really.

 you find yourself clicking a lot because the mouse icon has no visual changes to them like object icon, area icon and so on.  I played in advance mode though didn't get that achieve because at one point I simply clicked off advance in the main menu options to see what the other mode was like and then switched it back when I realized advanced mode for this game is better.   

anyway I'd say don't bother to purchase this game unless it's in some bundle sale ( which is how I got it) and it comes down to under a dollar or less.

Сюжет просто как две копейки. Молодой человек узнал, что его возлюбленная на самом деле из древнего рода вампиров аристократов. И злой папаня кровосос не желает отдавать свою дочуру за простолюдина, да к тому же еще и человека. Но наш протеже не пальцем делан, а придумывает хитрый план как расположить к себе графа.

Сами вампиры представлены  классическом образе Брэма Стокера. Не страшные как Носферату, а такие все стильные, властные и с хорошими манерами. 
Действие происходит в одном городе, передвигаемся по карте, но заплутать не дадут, свободы так таковой нету. Классические мини игры и места поиска предметов, стандарт для такого жанра.

 Понравились отсылки к творчеству разных людей о вампирах и оборотнях. Всякие книги, брошюры, плакаты. Надо просто внимательней смотреть локации. Тот же постер ""Дракула 1931"" года, висит в кабинете у графа Мордога. 
Музыка соответствующая, мрачная с примесью органа и пианино. Юмор тоже неплохой. Типа каждый вампир после 500 лет, нуждается в личном психологе, хочет быть Голливудским актером и вообще забывает какая кровь на вкус. 

3D модельки персонажей сделаны очень добротно, я знаю игры такого жанра которые стоят дороже, но с отвратным 3D, или вообще просто статичные картинки без озвучки.

Вообще этой игре довольно сложно поставить палец вверх. Многочисленные баги, глюки, ошибки и прочие жуки не дают нормально поиграть. Создается впечатление что она попросту не доделана, брошена и не тестирована совсем. Был глюк когда не срабатывал поиск предметов, я думал сам что-то не так делаю. Провозился пол часа. Потом перезашел в игру и  о чудо! 

Короче поиграйте, ироничная, немного стебная и глюченная на всю башку игра. И да,не смотрите вампиро-пузиков перед сном.

I honestly thought this was going to be a true horror game, but I quickly realize I was going to have more laughs than scares! 
As an HO game, the story has to be fulfilled, and although it's simple, It was nice enough to entertain me for a second playthrough!

The game has a minor glitch, where -by some reason, the screen becomes white, as some objects suddenly are missing. I had to restart my game twice. But since [b]Sinister City[/b] was the first game from [u]Jetdogs Studios[/u] (at least here on Steam), I have to give them a break. other than that the game works as it should!
The HO's scenes could use a much higher resolution to increase the objects quality, this is a common problem with tons of other games as well. There is no other spot I can press in terms of negativity, everything else works fine in a cool vampiric atmosphere!
The puzzles are interesting and not exhaustive, some are challenging, but far from nightmares that exist to annoy you. The characters are interesting and their role well played considering the storyline is short and doesn't make much sense other than to amuse you.
I also enjoyed the scenarios and the city map, although I wish I could visit randomly more places just for the fun of it!

I enjoyed the storyline, even though it's short and looks silly at times and extremely stupid in a funny way, I think most people would enjoy a good laugh or two from a trip to [b]Sinister City[/b]!

Последний раз запускала игру год назад, думала, что сейчас всё поправили, но нет, разработчики, видимо, забыли про свой проект!
Покупала игру ради самой игры, а не карточек и значков (не увлекаюсь этим делом).

Плюсы:
+сюжет и графика (на этом все плюсы заканчиваются);

Минусы:
-головоломки или не реагируют на клики мышки, либо подвисают (приходится перезапускать игру);
-персонаж идёт куда хочет, но только не туда, куда надо (глючное управление);
-скучные и неинтересные диалоги (не цепляют, хочется поскорее пропустить);
-расследование (нелогичное, неинтересное);

Например Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends. Хоть игра и чуть дороже, но я не встретила в ней ни одного бага и прошла с интересом!

But, to be clear, it's 1€ game, don't expect high quality and unforgettable experience. And, mixed review are right, i wouldn't recommend this game, but still, i am giving it thumb up. Why? Just because :) I will explain it:

Pros (+):
+ 1€ game
+ nice story (i expected worse), but still nothing extra
+ puzzles are fine, but mostly just find hidden objects
+ funny jokes, lines and references (i dont't want to spoil anything, but, you know, the line: ""Thanks, Mom, I'm going to kidnap Nina back!"" is not something you can use everyday :D
+ around 2 hours to finish the story
+ achievements (you can get almost all of them in one play)

Cons (-):
- bugs (i found some, but they can be solved by restarting the game)
- not really game in which you have to use your brain (especially in story, just let it go, enjoy that simple story)
- some of hidden objects puzzles are quite dark and hard to find some stuff (and also, you have to move some objects, because there is another object under them)
- that's all, you can't nitpicking every single thing in 1€ game (sorry, but it is true - indie game for that price can't have the best graphics and overwhelming soundtrack)


There's one more thing. Logic in some puzzles. Like, you have to install some computer software, but you have to find 10 floppy disks in the office. Well, one is in trash, because, why not. You will have to prepare a tea for psychologist. But you have to find teabags. And they are everywhere. Literally. Her office is messy, same as she is. So many issues, not even Windows Vista had those. But as i said, relax :) Enjoy that story as it is. Again, i will mention the price, which is pretty nice for this game. I've played much worse hidden objects game, which were more expensive and even sh*ttier in story and bugs.

So, that's it. Mixed reviews, so this is obviously not the best game, if you are looking for hidden objects game. But if you are in a good mood, and have 1€ to spend, you can spend it here :) Trailer is showing everything what you need to see to decide, if you will buy this game.

Sinister City ist ein typisches Wimmelbild Spiel das erstmalig im Jahre 2011 veröffentlicht wurde.
Für damalige Verhältnisse wäre es vielleicht ein ganz gutes Spiel gewesen aber mit heutigen Standarts kann es nicht mithalten. Da hilft es auch nicht, dass es im Vollpreis für 0,99€ zu haben ist. Der erste Durchgang spielt sich zwar ganz lustig, aber nicht weil es so unterhaltsam ist, sondern weil es durch seine eher lieblose Umsetzung öfter schmunzeln lässt. Obwohl das Spiel nun schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat, ist es nachwievor voll von Bugs, Übersetzungsfehlern und sogar komplett fehlenden Texturen! Auch die Bildschärfe ist für heutige Monitore nicht mehr optimal, es wirkt zum Teil verzerrt und sehr unscharf. Die Story selbst hat auch sehr wenig Tiefgang.

[b]Bugs etc. die mir aufgefallen sind:[/b]
[list]
[*]Im leichten Modus hatte ich in der Spiegelwelt in einer Wimmelbildszene einen Gegenstand den ich suchen musste, der eine komplett fehlende Textur hatte (weißer Bereich im Bild)
[*]Im fortgeschrittenen Modus hatte ich in der Spiegelwelt wie oben eine komplett fehlende Textur der normalen Szene die etwa ein 1/6 des Bildschirms ausmachte
[*]Im fortgeschrittenen Modus ebenfalls in der Spiegelwelt wurde es richtig zur nervtötenden Angelegenheit eine Wimmelbildszene abzuschließen. Jedesmal wann man den Bildschirm angeklickt hat, egal ob auf ein gesuchtes Objekt oder Fehlklick, hat man automatisch die Wimmelbildszene wieder verlassen. Danach habe ich das Spiel im 2. Durchgang abgebrochen.
[*]Teilweise starke Übersetzungsfehler bei gesuchten Objekten (zB.: Gesucht Palme - Gegangstand Hand). Das ist störend für 2 Erfolge: Bei einem muss man 5 Objekte innerhalb von 10 Sekunden finden und beim anderen muss man das Spiel abschließen ohne öfters als 3 Mal einen Hinweis bekommen zu haben. Weiters erschwert wird das ganze durch die sehr schechte Grafik.
[/list]

[b]FAZIT:[/b]
Ich habe das Spiel auf leicht einmal durchgespielt, für den fortgeschrittenen Modus hatte ich keine Geduld mehr, da mir vorkommt, dass die Bugs da noch mehr sind. Leider fehlen mir jetzt 3 Achievements für den 100% Erfolg. Das Spiel ist sehr kurz (2-3 Stunden) und lässt keine Spannung aufkommen, wie bei manchen anderen Vertretern in dem Genre. Auch wenn das Spiel um 0,99€ und im Sale für ein paar Cents zu haben ist, ist es kein Spiel das man nun unbedingt besitzen muss. Auch für Erfolgsjäger ist es eher eine ärgerliche Angelegenheit, da durch die ganzen Bugs das ganze noch erschwert wird. Ich rate zu anderen Titeln in dem Genre, die kosten zwar etwas mehr aber man bekommt auch ein besseres Produkt.

Plot:
What seemed, at the onset, to be a tale of a man rescuing his beloved fiancée from a wicked vampire, quickly plummeted into the lowest depths of Hollywoodesque sitcom. Seriously, the only real joke in this game is the fact that it got published.

It feels a very rough, low budget title. The kind with basic voice acting, graphics that can make you cring,
and other things that cry cheap.

Some of these titles can have a decent plot, but the plot is borderline bizzare, not interesting and short.
The puzzles are mostly basic and sometimes not very clear. The HO scenes are basic and require some 
extra clicks. Somehow I didn't get an achievement i definitely think i deserve.
They help you get objects, but there's so much wandering about for additional objects, it makes you
feel as if they wanted some fillers to lengthen the game.

On the pro side - It is short. I thought whether I should stop playing as i did feel I'm wasting my time, but i was
hoping the end was near, and it was. luckily.

So - If you are really bored or must do every HOPA you see - go for it.

본 게임은 헤라클레스의 12과업 (12 Labours of Hercules) 시리즈를 만든 게임사에서 제작한 히든 오브젝트 게임이다. 헤라클레스 시리즈와 같은 캐주얼게임은 잘 만드는 듯하지만 히든 오브젝트 게임에는 왠지 소질이 없었나보다. 같은 장르의 타사 게임들보다 그래픽, 스토리, 게임성 등 퀄리티면에서 뒤쳐지는 게임이다. 어떤 분은 이 게임을 B급도 아닌 F급이라고 혹평을 하셨는데, 어느 정도까지는 공감이 간다.
확실히 아티펙스 먼디사의 게임이나 빅피쉬 게임들에 비하면 비교가 안될 정도로 모든 면에서 별로인건 사실이다.

하지만, 본 게임이 여타의 동 장르(히든 오브젝트게임 장르)의 게임보다도 일단은 가격적인 부분에서는 월등히 싸기때문에(아티펙스 먼디게임이 보통 10,500원대인데 그 게임에 비하면 1/10의 수준이다.) 가격대비해서 게임을 평가하자만 딱히 나쁜 수준은 아니다. 스토리가 처음엔 공포스럽다가 나중에는 코미디화 되는 경향이 있을 정도로 다소 유치하게 흘러가는데, 본인이 보기에는 그런것도 그냥 귀엽게 봐줄수 있을거같다. 지금은 아니지만 2000년 초반까지 공포를 과장한 B급 호러 코미디 영화들이 꽤 있었는데 그런 영화들을 꽤 봐왔던 영향 일수도 있지만 본인이 평가하기에는 가성비와 도전과제, 적당한 난이도 수준의 미니게임 등을 고려해서 2~2.5시간 플탐으로 만족스러운 게임이라고 생각한다. 게다가 어떤 모게임처럼 게임의 목적도 알수 없고 스토리도 알수 없고 미니게임의 경우 하는 방법도 알수 없어서 헤메가 만들지도 않는 게임이다. 주인공의 목표성도 확실하니 그 점도 마음에 드는 게임이다. 모르면 힌트를 사용할수 있으니...

이 게임에서는 드라큘라가 퇴치대상의 괴물이 아닌 인간과 공존해서 살아가는 존재라는 것도 다른 게임과는 조금 다르다. 예전에 이런 흡혈귀와 인간이 공존해서 사는 설정의 영화나 드라마가 있었던거같은데 문득 그 생각이 난다. 도전과제도 쉬운 편이므로 어느 정도 학습(?)을 하고 임한다면 1회차에서도 충분히 100% 달성이 가능하다.

2~2.5시간 정도의 플탐으로 가격적으로 부담이 적은 1,100원짜리 히든 오브젝트 게임으로서는 괜찮은 게임이니 처음부터 유저평가만 보고 미리 저평가할 필요는 없다고 생각한다. 게다가 세일기간에 구입한다면 더더욱 가격이 내려갈테니 그때를 노리는 것도 좋을 것이다. 히든 오브젝트 게임을 좋아하거나 도전과제가 목적이라면 구입해서 꼭 해볼것으로 권하는 바이다.

★이 게임을 하기 위한 주의사항★
게임내에서 닉네임을 여러개 만드는건 나쁘지 않으나 게임을 한번 시작하면 엔딩까지 도전과제 100% 될때까지 한 닉네임으로 플레이할 것. 만약에 게임을 하다가 저장해놓고 지우고 다시 시작하면 도전과제는 리셋된다는 것을 주의할 것. 그리고 게임 시작시에 만들어둔 닉네임은 문제되지 않지만 도전과제를 모두 끝내고 나서 다른 닉네임을 선택하게 되면 도전과제가 일시 리셋된다. 100%달성한 닉네임으로 다시 설정하고 재시작하면 도전과제 달성한 것들은 모두 되살아난다. 그리고, 도전과제를 100% 한 후에 다른 닉네임을 만들려고 하면 에러가 발생해서 자동종료가 되는데 버그인듯하다. 이 점에 주의할 것.

66번째 도전과제 100% 달성한 게임.

[h1]优点：[/h1]
1.主角有建模型，而且可以以第三人称视角在场景内四处走动。可能我接触的解谜游戏比较少，我接触到的解谜游戏都是第一人称视角，也没有在场景内走动这回事。所以能看到自己的人物四处走动还是让我很新奇的。
2.人物的建模还算不错，人物动作也很流畅。
3.BGM很不错
4.寻物谜题和小游戏难度不高，所以很容易全成就。
5.一些小细节让人感觉很不错。男主角几乎没露出过的手的手背上有制作突出的血管；在旅店靠窗的那个柜子的寻物场景，窗外有时会飘过白色的鬼魂（这个鬼魂我在手机版上遇到过，PC版的宣传视频上也有，但我玩PC版并未遇到。应该是有的，只是因为出现间隔太大所以我一直没遇到）；在旅店2L房间桌子上寻找东西时门口闪过了一个吸血鬼的影子；男主角在城市内奔波时路过汉堡店还顺便买了个汉堡……
6.进入游戏后账户名称直接取自steam昵称，省的我自己输了，而且账户名称能为自定义的中文，我玩的很多解谜游戏账户名称都不能输中文
[h1]缺点：[/h1]
1.虽然可以以第三人称视角在场景内控制主角四处走动，但也因此主角和其他角色在有的场景内直接浮空
2.背景场景有些粗糙，而且分辨率不高
3.12年在手机平台发布，移植到PC之后14年登陆steam，然而有的地方忘了改动，比如拿摄像机帮那个男吸血鬼拍节目时候，显示的还是“滑动手指来移动镜头”。
4.遇到了两个BUG。一个是在催眠机器里有钟表的那个场景里，剧情过后突然就不能点进任何寻物场景了，也不能走到其他场景去了，不过退出游戏后重进就好了。另一个也是在催眠机器里，不过是那个爬梯子够鸟笼的场景，我在鸟笼的寻物场景里发现了一个雪白的长方形方块，点了一下居然是钥匙，看来贴图有些问题……
5.少量翻译错误。印象中寻物谜题的两个错误有把烟斗翻成管子，把杰克翻译成夹克。不过身为一个经常玩Artifex Mundi发行的解谜游戏的人，我早就习惯各种翻译错误了，并且知道了很多同英文不同中文的物品。所以这部作品里的同英不同中的翻译问题并没给我造成困扰。
6.寻物谜题中有些物品是可以移开的，移开后取得被遮挡住的物品。但是并不知道哪些是可以移开的，上面并没显示，鼠标移上去也没有显示，只能瞎点瞎找。
7.提示的方式有点蛋疼。在场景中我点提示，然后弹出个图给我显示了某个寻物场景中有某个东西，我还得自己思考显示的这个寻物场景在哪，这倒没什么；但是在寻物谜题的时候我点提示，他还是弹出个图然后在图上圈出东西在哪。就不能直接在场景里给我圈吗？非要弹出一张和场景一模一样的图然后再圈？我记得手机版就是直接在场景里圈的啊而且简单模式会一定时间没找到会自动给你把物品圈出来，这电脑版咋还不如手机版呢？还是我时隔四年记忆出现了偏差手机版其实没这么好？
8.寻物任务数量有点多。
9.游戏的剧情。一般解谜游戏我不会吐槽剧情，因为解谜游戏的重点在关卡设计上而不是剧情上，而且剧情优秀的解谜游戏非常少。但是这部游戏的剧情我不吐槽的话我估计我会憋死，[spoiler] 我当初在手机上玩试玩版，试玩版到修好催眠梦境里的镜子就没了。我觉得这游戏的剧情一定是我在吸血鬼城堡中冒险，最后打败那个老吸血鬼，救出我心爱的姑娘。于是我对这个游戏充满了期待，但由于手机没绑银行卡所以没能续费。然后我终于在steam上找到了这个游戏的电脑版，于是赶紧买下，从宣传动画和宣传截图上看也是我在吸血鬼城堡中冒险然后救出我心爱的姑娘。[/spoiler]
[spoiler]然而实际玩了才发现从试玩版那块结束之后的确是去了吸血鬼城堡，然而却是找老吸血鬼谈判，因为老吸血鬼其实是我未婚妻的爹，也就是我的准岳父！岳父把未婚妻抓走是为了让女儿嫁给一个吸血鬼名演员好让自己的女儿也进演艺圈圆自己的演艺梦！然后就跑出城堡跑回现代都市里去电视台演播室找吸血鬼演员，吸血鬼演员正带着天线宝宝状的头套拍儿童节目，然后说自己有老婆不想娶他女儿，于是又找心理医生想给老吸血鬼做心理辅导，结果心理医生什么忙都没帮上，最后又去找准岳母，帮准岳母修了空调安了软件，准岳母很高兴说小伙子真能干女儿就嫁你了！然后一家人最后拉着老吸血鬼去电视台拍了个节目圆了梦，于是老吸血鬼就同意女儿嫁男主角了，然后一家人就幸福快乐的在一起了！[/spoiler]
[spoiler]我擦这到底什么gui！说好的魔幻色彩呢？说好的城堡内大战吸血鬼英雄救美呢？结果却是在高楼大厦中四处跑以讨好自己的准岳父岳母？我算知道为啥试玩版在修好镜子那就戛然而止了，也知道为啥宣传截图和宣传动画丝毫没提城堡和旅店以外的地方了！这算不算欺骗消费者啊？？？[/spoiler]
10.封面上那个美丽的吸血鬼妹子从头至尾就没在游戏里出现过，而且那妹子也是手机版的APP图标。

总体来说，对于一个原价6块的游戏来说，已经大大的物超所值了。这游戏并没有那么的差不是么？很多人看价格便宜就买来挂卡，也不玩，并且还把挂卡写成了评测。我个人觉得这是对游戏作者极大的不尊重。当然我也没有权利干涉别人的行动，所以也就在这发发牢骚罢了。
另外很多人说那个made in china就代表假货，是在嘲讽中国。我并不这么认为，中国生产的东西遍布世界各地，而且绝大部分质量都不错。游戏里搞个made in china只是想表达这个木桩不是真是吸血鬼猎人的道具，只是影视道具或是玩具而已。搞个条形码或是普通商标的话没法做那么大，产地的标可以搞的很大。然后又因为中国生产的东西外国有很多，所以就选择了中国作为产地，并没有嘲讽的意思。毕竟要真嘲讽中国的话，这游戏就不会有简体中文而且还在中国发售了。",1468497771,1468497771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

CONS
Visuals sometimes broken - large white blocks where the background should be. (OTOH, when this happens in a hidden object zone, all you see are the hidden objects so you can select them and get on with the story.) This only happened sometimes - loading error, or something like that. Restarting fixed it.

Occasionally throws you out of an object zone after every click - this is a MAJOR bug; fortunately, restarting the game fixes it.

Annoying red X and zap sound when you click a ""wrong"" thing. (You get used to it.)

Objects often hidden behind other things; lots of random pointless clicking.

PROS
Story is hilarious... once you stop trying to believe it's serious.
Art is good. Music is nicely matched to the mood, including the over-the-top drama.
Ipkis is the most unique vampire character I've ever seen in a game.

For all I know, this is trying to be the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of hidden object games, and the bugs were left in as part of the ""charm."" (Note to devs: They are not charming.) This game deserves an MST3K treatment. 

I recommend using hints liberally to avoid frustration; focus on enjoying the story, and if you want all the achievements, go back through and play it without the hints.",1467995813,1498618569,True,1,1,0.526143789291381836,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Итак, сразу перйдем к плюсам этой игры:
+ Короткая. Я не большой поклонник игр, в которые надобно играть десятки часов. Эта же история проходится буквально за пару часов.. 
+ История. Милая местами шаблонна, местами скучная, а местами веселая история, после прохождения которой остается приятное ощущение удовлетворенности.
+ Визуальное оформление. Приятные рисованные подложки и колоритные 3D-персонажи весьма хорошо сочетаются. Неплохие ролики.
+ Атмосфера. У этой истории есть весьма необычная атмосфера дешевых ужастиков конца 80-х - начала 90-х годов. Любителям может понравится.
+ Достижения. Их все легко получить.

Минусы:
- Музыка. Бездарна, оттого очень быстро надоедает.
- Баги. Они есть, но не мешают играть.

Итак, оценки:
1. Игровой процесс: 6/10
2. Сюжет: 6/10
3. Атмосфера: 6/10
4. Визуальное оформление 6/10
_____________
Итого: 6/10

P.S. Конечно,от этой коротенькой милой истории не стоит ожидать чего-то необычного или захватывающего. Напротив, все достаточно просто и даже немного шаблонно. Но, на мой взгляд, это тот редкий случай, когда подобные качества идут на пользу проекту.

ポイントクリック＆HiddenObjectといった感じのゲーム。
良いところが一つもなく、欠点ばかりが目立つ。
・ポリゴンのクオリティが低い
・当たり判定がいい加減
・翻訳に誤訳が非常に多い。会話も意味不明な訳になってる。
・HiddenObjectが16個のアイテムを探すが、リストが5個ずつしか出ず、しかも全部見つけるまで次の5個が表示されない（当然表示されているものしか反応しない）
・通常画面とHiddenObjectの垣根がなく、HiddenObjectのリストが表示されている状態で、落ちているアイテムを拾えるため、非常に紛らわしい
・HiddenObjectの訳がひどく、手袋と地球儀が両方「手袋」となっていたり、蝶ネクタイが「弓」になっていたりするため、日本語でのプレイが難しい。
・全体的にテンポが悪い
・アスペクト比が狂っていて、全体的に横長になっている。ウィンドウサイズは変えられない。
・オブジェクトが小さく、探すのにかなり疲れる。
・表示されているものと違うものをクリックしないと現れないアイテムもあり、しかもカーソル形状が変化しないため、あてずっぽうでクリック連打する事になる。
・バグがあり、途中で操作不能になる。

最後が致命的なため、当然購入する価値はない。",1466556836,1466556836,False,3,0,0.497784554958343506,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Desculpem-me, não consegui evitar o trocadilho ruim pois é exatamente nisso que o jogo se baseia, em trocadilhos e piadas ruins. Mas não se engane, esse fato dà ao jogo todo um charme especial.

[i]Obs: Se quiser ler o resumo da análise pule direto para ""Considerações Finais"".[/i]

[b]◄ Estória / Objetivo ►[/b]
[quote=]Quem mais chamaria sua própria cidade de Sinister City? Vampiros, claro! Quando John descobre que sua noiva foi capturada pelo maior sanguessuga de Sinister City, só lhe resta uma coisa a fazer: vasculhar objetos ocultos! E matar vampiros! Ou ao menos ofendê-los até que devolvam sua mulher.[/quote]

Sinister City é muito mal visto talvez seja por sua estória porém na minha humilde opinião, é o que mais me despertou atenção. A estória é muito idiota, tão idiota que chega ser hilária e creio que era a intenção dos desenvolvedores. O jogo tem uma duração de aproximadamente uma hora e meia mas se você busca conquistas, esse tempo pode aumentar.

O jogo está traduzido para português porém se você consegue entender inglês de boa, coloque em inglês pois a tradução claramente foi feita por um amador e tem muitos erros, isso sem contar o fato que o nome do personagem ""John"" foi traduzido para ""João"".

[b]◄ Jogabilidade / Controles ►[/b]
A jogabilidade consiste em apontar e clicar, cenas de objetos ocultos e mini jogos.
Os controles do jogo são todos realizados pelo mouse.

[b]◄ Gráficos / Visuais ►[/b]
Nada para se destacar, gráficos e visuais simples mas pode-se relevar devido ser um jogo de ""objeto oculto"".

[b]◄ Efeitos Sonoros / Trilha Sonora ►[/b]
Efeitos sonoros ok. 
A trilha sonora até que é bem legal, não chega a enjoar pois os cenários são rápidos então estão sempre mudando a trilha sonora com eles.

[b]◄ Multijogador Local / Multijogador Online ►[/b]
O jogo não possui nenhum tipo de multijogador, seja local ou online.

[b]◄ DLCs / Expansões ►[/b]
O jogo não possui nenhum tipo de conteúdo adicional.

[h1]Considerações Finais[/h1]
[b]Prós:[/b]
+ Estória divertida;
+ Controles simples;
+ Boa Trilha Sonora;

[b]Contras:[/b]
- Poderia ter um melhor desenvolvimento da trama;
- Apenas uma hora e meia de jogo;
- Tradução para português muito ruim;

[b]Nota Final: 6/10[/b]

Apesar de barato e ter gostado do jogo, recomendo pegar apenas em promoção pois como disse, muita gente não gosta da estória e também por sua duração ser muito baixa.

The only con I had with the game is that there were probably a dozen or so places where the audio said something different from the subtitles. It kind of took me out of the story for a second, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

The game clocked in at right under two hours, and I was able to finish it in one sitting, but it sure was fun filled. I'm sure I'll go back through the advanced mode one day, so I can get 100% completetion, and to also enjoy the game again.

I'd be willing to play some more games from this developer in the future.

This is a Point and click hidden object game.


[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

There is a Music Volume Slidebar.
There is a Sound Volume Slidebar.
You can play fullscreen or windowed mode.
You can not change the resolution size.
You can have different ""player slots"" for multiple users.
There is easy and hard mode. (if you are Familiar with these kind of games then you know what they will do),

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

This is a point and click hidden object game. You have to search around for clues and equipment in order to complete a certain area. I don't get this part. You are not able to do a ""hidden object minigame"" unless you HAVE to do it. Why make it active or show? =/.

Character walks very slow and he will not teleport around to speed those things up. (like in some does).
Double clicking speeds up an action. Which i recommend.
You are able to skip through these ""Dialogues""
Game has Text and that is totally voiced over.
Click boxes to interact with an object are really bad.
Graphics are meh.
Animation is really reallly bad.
There is a help system.

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

They try to scare you with some random events. (not jumpscares)
Objects are sooo freaking small. Way too small. I randomed clicked alot of times just to be lucky to find it.
I have played a couple of these hidden and click games. But this one is really bad.

It's got glitches that do ridiculous but harmless things - like one screen where there simply isn't a floor.  The characters are badly written, but occasionally the cheesy acting or cornball jokes redeem them into being entertaining.

Третья игра, в которую я играл. Третий страйк. Если я вдруг захочу что-то ещё приобрести от этой студии - ударьте мне по рукам.
Как это ни странно, но игра понравилась больше более новых игр. Скатились... Поскольку желания знакомиться с играми этой студии нет, и эта самая ранняя их игра, будем считать её первой.
Во-первых, что сразу бросается в глаза - мышкой управляем главгероем, который идёт туда, куда тыкнем. Для игры жанра поиска предметов - это очень даже хорошее начинание. Для квеста - слабо, потому-что не надо собирать кучу всякой ерунды, чтобы применить её в правильном месте, но если сравнивать с дракулой и франкенштейном, где локации - анимированные картинки - это очень радует.
Во-вторых, геймплей - сплошной поиск предметов. Иногда нужно найти какой-то предмет, чтобы применить его в нужном месте, но основную часть времени игроку предстоит искать предметы. На мой взгляд это лучшее решение, чем в дракуле и франкенштейне, где надо бегать по локациям, собирать ключи, открывать замки, находить новые ключи и изредка искать предметы. Есть 3 списка предметов для поиска, каждый включает в себя 5 вещей, и пока все 5 не найдёшь, список не обновится. Предметы маленькие и не заметные, в отличие от поздних игр, что несомненно делает игру сложнее. Головоломки тоже интересные и не такие банальные.
В-третьих, заметно отличается графика игры. Это простительно для старых игр, потому-что в те времена технологии не позволяли добиться таких результатов, которые имеем сейчас. Ведь это было в далёком... 2014 году? Да они модели топором что ли стругали? Трёхмерный угловатый персонаж ходит по двумерному миру! Ну не умеют моделировать - пусть хотя бы красиво в 2D оформят! Хорошо хоть потом рисовать научатся.
В-четвёртых - сюжет. Идея интересна - у мужика похитили невесту, и он приехал её искать в город вампиров. Кое где юмор встречается. Есть несколько персонажей, с которыми можно поговорить, в отличие от театра двух актёров дракулы и франкенштейна, и на первый взгляд вроде бы всё хорошо. Однако с первых минут игры начинается ахинея. Приходишь в гостиницу, просишь номер у администратора - солидного дядьки в возрасте. Тот говорит, что растерял все квитанции, и просит их найти. Ладно, отдаём ему квитанции. Он говорит, что потерял все ключи, и просит их найти. Да тебя, старого пердуна, на пенсию пора отправлять! Так накосячить за 1 день, ещё и самостоятельно не можешь всё исправить! Отдаём ключи, жалуемся ему на свою тяжёлую судьбу, и он соглашается нам помочь, и совершенно обычный криворукий дядя-администратор гостиницы предлагает устроить нам телепатический сеанс связи с невестой.
В-пятых - баги. Ладно, бог, Иисус, Алах или Кришна не одарили сценариста фантазией. Ладно там, рисовать не умеют. Но баги то что мешает исправить? Особенно те, из-за которых невозможно дальше играть, и приходится перезапускать игру.
Игра хоть и стоит 30 рублей, но брать её всеравно не рекомендую. Как и любую другую игру от Jetdogs Studios	.",1460814349,1460814349,False,3,0,0.507287502288818359,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

I would say that this game is one of the first Hidden-Objects game of Jetdogs Studios with the smallest budget, the other hidden objects games are good to really good.

This game feature a third person point and click game. The story is so so but can be fun (foolish and some humour). Clicking can't be too precise sometimes so some objects or places can be unnoticed. But the good thing is that you can click as long as you want without a rectriction.

The game features a good mix between a puzzle / exploring and hidden objects. Hidden objects scenes are challenging, indeed some objects can only be found after interacting with the scene by combining one or several items or solving a medium puzzle. The only bad point is that you need to click everywhere to find an Hidden Object Scene. Also you'll have to find several items through your quest in these Hidden Object Scenes.

(*):
Some achievements required you to not skip any mini-game, hidden objects scene or cutscene. And some need you to find several objects in a required time but it's easily doable on your playthrough or by doing the first hidden objects scene of the beginning until you're fast enough.",1459785121,1459785121,True,3,1,0.464107871055603027,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In other words, she'll be wed to a vampire the next morning. Your only way is  to convince him that you're the one for her...

Sinister City has probably one of the worst plots in HO games if you take that seriously. In reality, the plot is a great parody of horror stories as the father wants to be an actor, the mother is a powerful businesswoman and that every vampire met is friendly.

The gameplay is the same as other games of the genre: list of items, objects to find and to use, puzzles to solve. Everything is quite easy. However, there is a game-breaking bug at the beginning and the only way to get past it is to exit the game and relaunch it. If you don't know that, you may be frustrated to be stopped so early in the story and that you can't do anything about it. Once past that, you can enjoy the game that isn't so bad as you could fear.

The graphics are correct, even if the vampires aren't really terrifying as they should but as it's a parody, it's normal to have them behaving comically. The soundtrack is correct too.

I played the game more than a year ago and I suppose that you can feel that with my review. But I remember clearly that I said to people: Once you get past the famous bug and if you can handle a silly plot, you'll enjoy the game.  So, while Sinister City isn't the greatest game out there, it's still a good moment to pass. Other titles from JetDog are better (Frankenstein: Master of Death is the best example) but well, Sinister City will not make a hole in your wallet and will not hurt you.",1456564505,1456564505,True,10,0,0.650524675846099854,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ta miejscami przez tekstury niskiej rozdzielczości, aż denerwuje, ponieważ nie możemy dostrzec pewnych przedmiotów, lecz nie można uznać tego jako wadę, gdyż gra ma juz swoje lata. Lokacje, które przyjdzie nam odwiedzić nie są może zbyt rozbudowane, lecz przynajmniej wyglądają realistycznie i nie widać w nich ""sztuczności"". Czas rozgrywki nie jest zbyt długi, jako iż przejście Sinister City zajęło mi niewiele ponad 2 godziny. Kolejnymi z denerwujących rzeczy są miejscami średnio przetłumaczone dialogi oraz bugi. Czasami zdarzy się, że jakaś tekstura się nie doładuje, bądź nasza postać z nieznanych nikomu powodów zacznie lewitować (jesteśmy w mieście wampirów, więc może nasza postać zamienia się w nietoperza?xD).

Sinister City is a point-and-click hidden-object game, in the vein of the Mystery Case Files series.  For only being 99 cents, it isn't the worst game in the genre.  It doesn't stack up to the aforementioned MCF series, but for what it's worth, you could do much worse.

You play as a human guy whose bride-to-be is a vampire.  Her father doesn't want her marrying a non-vampire (for hopefully obvious reasons), so he LOCKS HER IN A CAGE.  To free her, you need to complete a series of puzzles that aren't hard at all.  I played through the game in full, and only clocked in about 2 hours.

I have to give credit to Jetdogs Studios for getting some decent voice talent in this game.  Whether or not I recommend this game to you is dependent on whether or not it looks interesting to you.  If so, then yes, and vice versa.  This game gets my Seal of Approval.  Just, don't play for the plot.

Dieses fälschlicherweise als ""Spiel"" angegebene Ding ist auch in einem Sale nicht zu kaufen!!
Ich habe seinerzeit 19 cent investiert,dachte, bei dem Preis kann man nicht viel falsch machen, zumal es Sammelkarten hat!
Doch ich irrte mich gewaltig...
Nach einmaligen durchspielen stehe ich kurz vor einer Schmerzensgeldklage!!
Das Wort, welches auch nur ansatzweise dieses Spiel beschreibt, muss noch erfunden werden!!

Zu empfehlen ist dieses Spiel für Leute, die:
- Achievements bekommen wollen, die dann aber auch gleich wieder aberkannt werden!!
- auf exotische Mundbewegungen stehen
- anstatt nerviger Texturen ( die auch so schon nicht sonderlich gut sind) gerne auf einen weißen Bildschirm starren und dabei ein brennen in den Augen bekommen wollen, denn gerade das letzte Drittel des Spiels besteht praktisch nur noch aus solchen ""Leerflächen""
- etwas lernen wollen: Eine Stecknadel und eine Reißzwecke sind zum Beispiel exakt das Selbe, ebenso eine Taube und ein Hase
- gerne anstatt Rätsel zu lösen auf besagte ""Leerflächen"" starren
- und Leute, die auf richtig schlecht abgekupferte Geschichten rund um Vampire stehen!!

Aber wenn man sich einmal in dieses ""Abenteuer"" hineingestürzt hat, möchte man nicht mehr aufhören!! Man möchte alle Fehler des Spiels entdecken - ein schier endloses Unterfangen - was mir leider auch in großen Teilen gelungen ist!

Man kann mit dem Spiel Spaß haben, ich frage mich nur wie.... Vielleicht wenn man sich gerne an Bugs und fehlenden Texturen ergötzt!

Für mich ist/war es jedoch eher nichts!

O problema é que, como muitos jogos da jetdogs que eu tenho pego aqui no steam, o game está com alguns bugs:

1) às vezes, você está caçando os objetos e o jogo simplesmente te tira da tela de busca dos objetos;

2)traduçãozinha HORRÍVEL que fizeram nas legendas. Sério, péssima MESMO. Tem hora inclusive que prejudica você achar os objetos... Por exemplo, você precisa clicar em um dado, e está traduzido como ""morrer"", ou em um globo que está traduzido como luva... dá para acompanhar a história legal, mas se você souber inglês e comparar o audio, vai ver umas traduções ao pé da letra que eu tenho certeza que fazem um professor de inglês cair mortinho;

3)às vezes partes da cena ficam brancas, não carregando direito a cena. No modo fácil isso acontece muito pouco, mas no modo avançado isso acontece até nos puzzles, o que pode dificultar sua solução;

4)Eu tive um certo problema para conseguir todas as conquistas. Tive que jogar duas vezes, uma no modo fácil, outra no avançado pois, mesmo não pulando nenhum diálogo, no modo avançado o jogo não reconheceu isso.

Now you might find yourselves thinking who decided to give this city such an...inviting name, but from what we see of the town throughout the game describes it really well, so kudos to you, unkown peasant, you did well.

So our hero in the making has to find out whatever happened to his fiancee, by doing all kinds of silly stuff for the eccentric townfolk. The game itself is very straightforward and you can't get stuck on a puzzle if you wanted to, thanks to the unlimited hints system.
The puzzles are not at all difficult and won't be a problem to anyone, while the hidden object screens will occasionally annoy you with the low res graphics, but still won't be much of a problem.

The story is not trying to be serious at all, it almost felt like a parody in a way. The bad guy is a vampire that is apparently the one responsible for your finacee's disappearance, and you will have a chance to talk with him as the time goes on. The game is quite short, took  me less than 2 hours to finish.

I did encounter some bugs while playing, like sometimes the graphics of a certain objects will disappear, or while in the hidden object scene, every click of the mouse will exit the screen until you go back to the main menu and reenter the game from there.

Voice acting was ok, I've heard better, but it's tolerable. All in all, if you like hidden object games you are probably gonna like this one too. If you have never played a HO game, you probably want to try a better game to see if you'll like the genre.

+ decent voice acting
+ mostly bug-free
+ cheap

- quite short
- not  very innovative
- some low res graphics
- a few bugs

So, ignore the voice acting and story, both of which are either bad or hilariously bad.  As a hidden object game, it's okay.  It has two modes: easy mode and advanced mode.  I wish there were a middle one.  In easy mode, if you don't find an object or a location within a few seconds, it will sparkle for you.  So you might as well just mindlessly click wherever is sparkling and you could finish the game with absolutely no brain power on your part at all.  But in advanced mode, sometimes locations were finicky to find, so I spent several minutes just clicking randomly around the screen before giving up and switching to ""easy"" mode just long enough to get the hint, and then switching back.

Sinister City est un jeu d’aventure de type point & click avec des scènes d’objets cachés. Votre fiancée a été enlevée. Votre enquête pour la retrouver vous amène dans la ville des vampires. Menez l’enquête !

Je ne peux pas trop vous en dire mais sachez que vous découvrirez que les vampires sont autrement que ce qu’on peut les imaginer, ils ont des sentiments très humains dans ce jeu.

Le jeu est rapide, c’est un fait mais d’un autre côté, le prix est ridiculement bas, à moins d’un euro. Si vous aimez ce genre de jeu, ne vous en privez pas, c’est le prix d’un croissant !

Die Story ist flunderflach: Freundin wird von Vampir entführt. Wir müssen sie retten, auch wenn unser Drang dazu eher gering sein mag. Versuche des Games, sich selbst zu ironisieren, scheitern kläglich.

Die Grafik ist schwach, teils peinlich. Insbesondere die Gesichtszüge und Animationen der Protagonisten laden zum Lachen ein.

Der Vertonung ist schlichtweg unterirdisch. Würde man die Sprecher als Laien bezeichnen, es wäre eine Beleidigung für jeden Laien. 

Die Rätsel sind zwar an sich sehr einfach, meist aber kryptisch und unlogisch. So manchesmal weiß man nicht so recht, wo es eigentlich weitergeht.
 
Aber das Schlimmste: an allen Ecken und Enden merkt man dem Game seine Touch-Screen-Herkunft an. Es wirkt alles wie eine unausgegorene, schnell hingeschluderte Portierung.

Nach zwei Stunden ist das Ganze - erfreulicherweise - vorbei.

・良かった所

ヒントがすぐ光るのでそっちに行けば迷わず安心

・良くなかった所
アイテムを探す所が解りづらい
探しものパズルが終わっても収集すべきアイテムを見つけてないと
次のステップに行かないので（効果音とか無い）気が付かないで
ずーっとその画面を見てたりすることになったりする
ストーリーに期待してはいけない（戒め）
たまに捜し物アイテムで間違い翻訳が炸裂

パッケージから感じる雰囲気とは真逆の方へストーリー展開するので
色々割りきった方がいいのかな・・・という気持ちになりながらプレイしました
アイテム探しがいつ終わっているのかが判別つきにくいのが難点です
とはいえ、プレイ出来ないレベルのゲームではないです
セールで過去に￥9だったこともあるので
そのあたりの価格だったらやってみてもいいんではないでしょうか

ツッコミどころは満載なのでセール中なら買ってもいいんじゃないでしょうか

Эта игра о мире вапиров, где живут как ни странно вампиры.
В этой игре разработчики нам раскрывают историю о том, как могущественный злодей-вампир похищает невесту главного героя, а тому в свое время нужно её ""вырвать из лап"" этого злодея.
[u]Отметим плюсы данной игры:[/u]
 + Хороший, но банальный сюжет, местами смешной.
 + Перевод на многие языки мира.
 + Бесплатный саундтрек.
 + Около 50 мест, для поиска предметов.
 + Около 15 мини игр.
[u]Минусы:[/u]
- Не очень хорошая графика.

Покупал за 2 рубля по скидке 98-99%. Сюжет интересный, в некоторых местах смешной, но и банальный. Выбил карточки. Графика, конечно, хромает. Прошел всю игру на легком уровне сложности за 2.8 часа. Планирую перепройти на сложном, для получения ""Идеальной игры"".

Рекомендую, 9/10 вампиров! Любителям поинткликеров советую приобрести и пройти.

Что сказать о игре. В кратце, это простая, типичная point-&-click игрушка. Геймплей состоит на 70% из поиска предметов на экране. Остальные проценты приходятся на различные мини-игры (которых приличное количество). Если б не сюжет, игра бы возможно надоела в первый час. Так хоть есть диалоги и крохотный, но все же забавный сюжетик.

Своей цены игры бесспорно стоит. При всем при том, что я брал ее за 7 рублей, насколько я помню. Для отдыха игра в самый раз. А приятная музыка на заднем фоне создаст еще больший расслабон.

P.S Игра, которая может пополнить ваше кол-во идеальных игр :)

My favorite line was Ms. Seward's: ""Now, goodbye forever, you handsome manifestation of my childhood complexes!"" I agree with her. The voice acting was fine, except for Ipkis, who was overdone. It was hard to believe he was star material.

This game should be called ""Fetch Quest City""; and many of those quests were silly or illogical. A bunch of lazy characters waiting around for a needy fool to show up and do their work for them. The innkeeper was particularly inept at keeping track of stuff in his own establishment. Also, some of the HOG scenes closed after every click, requiring a lot of unnecessary work because I had to reopen those scenes and click, and reopen those scenes and click again, ad nauseum. Upon replay, I discovered that by exiting to the Main Menu and clicking on Continue, that problem was resolved.

The game has no help system to explain how the game saves. Since exiting to the Main Menu and clicking on Continue resulted in a ""loading"" message, I figured that it was a way to force the game to save, which was handy for working around the bugs. I saved a lot to avoid problems.

I have two issues with the game's graphics. The first problem was the screen aspect ratio. It was stretched side-to-side; so everything was wide, which was especially noticeable with circular objects like wheels and gears and the two globes on the HUD at the bottom of the screen. It looked like the game was designed for a standard monitor (4:3 ratio). I tried the only option available—Window mode—but the window was the same wide-screen ratio and everything was still distorted. And the window could not be resized to reduce the distortion. My nVidia graphics card is incredibly capable of handling aspect rations, but this game did not cooperate.

The second graphic problem involved HOG scenes and puzzles. Parts of the screen were blank. Meaning: solid white. In the case of the HOGs, I was able to able to access the Main Menu via the HUD and resolve the problem as described above. When I clicked on Continue and returned to the game, the visual problem was solved. However, there is no HUD available in the puzzle screens; so, there is no way to work around the problem, except to cancel the game via ALT+CTRL+DELETE. I was unable to solve one of the puzzles because of this problem and had to skip the puzzle; so, I didn't earn the Enigmatist achievement. Upon replay, I exited to the Main Menu prior to the puzzle and clicked Continue to fix the graphic issue and earned the achievement.

""Sinister City"" was cute and fun, but clunky. I'm surprised that such a recent release has these problems.",1448145882,1448145882,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

И у нас есть одна ночь на то, чтобы вернуть оттуда свою ненаглядную. Какие тайны скрывает этот городок?

В игре достаточно немало отсылок к поп-культуре и нашей жизни вообще. Взять хотя бы местного телеведущего-вампира детской передачи в образе телепузика-вампира. Или - ""Психологию для чайников"", в стандартной черно-желтой обложке. Или - вечный поиск порядка в нашем таком насыщенном хаосом предметов мире...

Конечно, стандартный от JetDogs пойнт-энд-клик, завязанный на поиске предметов, со слегка мистическим (в этот раз  - даже забавным) сюжетом про спасение своей возлюбленной. С постоянно шаблонными фразами и предложениями типа ""Поищи болты и кулеры, чтобы починить вентилятор, то бишь кондиционер, а то жарко что-то, или я с тобой не разговариваю!"". В отличие от других игр данного стиля, предметы находятся быстро и легко, паззлов мало, игру можно пройти в ускоренном темпе примерно за час (не смотрите на мое время в игре - я сначала карточки выбивал, потому дальше стартового меню не заходил). Сюжет, как я уже говорил, в игре забавный, и много наивного в нем - ох уж эта детская мечта 500-летнего вампира стать актером или за 6-7 монеток ""взять"" такое же количество книг по психологии! А чего стоит доверительное отношение любого персонажа, со спокойной душой позволяющего покопаться в своих вещах, не боясь за их сохранность и неукраденность...

Но это всего лишь придирки. Не смотря ни на что, Sinister City оказалась игрой довольно позитивной и, хоть не хватает с неба звезд (простите за шаблонную фразу), является продуктом неплохим. А что? Баги не фатальные, ачивки легкие, юмор не туалетный, время прохождения короткое. Игра в духе ""прошел-удалил"", но с остатком в виде легкой улыбки.

[i]Вообще, я любитель вселенной о вампирах. К тому же, если это связано с загадками или тайнами, от которых просто не хочеться стоять на месте. И не смотря на смешанные отзывы об игре, я вижу перед собой, довольно неплохой квест о вампирах. Да, в игре встречалось пару багов и что теперь, плакать? Описывая, что игра этим плохая и ставить палец вниз? Не бывает идеальных игр. Так что ставить игре минус из-за пару багов это полный бред. [/i]


[h1]Об игре[/h1]
[i]О квесте как всегда, можно сказать пару слов:
[list]
[*]Простенький сюжет
[*]Поиск предметов
[*]Головоломки
[/list]
В данном квесте мы возьмем роль парня, по имени Джон, у которого внезапно пропадает девушка и разумеется мы пойдем на всё, чтобы найти и спасти свою любовь.
На протяжении всей игры мы будем искать предметы и разгадывать не сложные головоломки, загадки. 
 
Это маленькое, но незабываемое приключение.[/i]

Sinister City это хороший квест в духе поинт клик. Интересные загадки и поиск предметов. Игра проходится за 3 часа и не успевает надоедать. По ходу игры мы можем получить 100 % ачивок , так как их получаем по ходу игры. На скидках игра стоила всего лишь 2 рубля, и мы можем окупить ее карточками. Советую поиграть :)

Скажу вам так, друзья дорогие...
Вы, зажрались!
Вас не устраивает игра, которая стоит 2 рубля, при этом вы получаете выгоду в размере карточек.
Видно, что разработчик старался, так поддержите его!
Скажу так... в игре есть казусы и неловкие, так скажем, моменты, но это не делает игру плохой.

Сегодня днём зашёл в раздел ""Скидки"" и решил, а почему бы мне не купить игру - SINISTER CITY. 

Начну сегодня я нестандартно - С МИНУСОВ: 

1) Стандартный сюжет. Ну это классика жанра, пропал любимый человек - ты пойдёшь на край света (в нашем случае в город Sinister)
2) Баги. Я встретил парочку багов, но всё же.
Ну впринципе, для меня это всё из минусов, перейдём к плюсам: 
1) Модели пресонажей. В этой игре они сделаны превосходно.
2) Цена. Цена в 29 рублей (я купил её за 2 РУБЛЯ) для такой игры (тем более она с карточками) - это отлично.
На этом у меня всё, если Вы любите игры в жанре Point&Click или просто хотите пополнить свою коллекцию - берите :) 
Если Вам понравился мой обзор, пожалуйста не скупитесь и поставьте лайк :)

[h1]Hidden Objectものとしては致命的なミス[/h1]
他のHidden Objectものと同じくゴチャゴチャした画面から必要なものを探すのがメインのゲームですが、書かれている日本語と実際に探すものが違うケースが2シーンに1つくらいの割合で見られました。
翻訳ミスなのか元のゲームがいけないのかわかりませんが、この種のゲームではやってはいけないミスだと思います。

[h1]いつ探索が終わったかわからないシステム[/h1]
他のゲームでは必要なものが終わったら一旦探索モードは終了しアイテムが得られるというシステムが一般的ですが、このゲームではそれとは別に進行に必須なアイテムを探すことを求められます。また必須アイテムはモノの陰に隠れていることもあり、動かせるか動かせないかはクリックしてみるまでわかりません。他のゲームではマウスオーバーでカーソルが変わるなどの工夫がありますが、このゲームでは変わりません。
そのためいつ探索を終えればいいのかがわかりにくい。それを補うためにカジュアルモードでは、行くべき場所へのヒントが（ヒントボタンを押さなくても）出てきますが、本末転倒感があります。

[h1]その他[/h1]
主人公と婚約者が婚約した経緯、吸血鬼と人間の関係、この世界での「映画監督」の位置づけがよくわかりません。ギャグなのかなんなのか…こまけぇことはいいんだよ、って感じのストーリーですがなんかのパロディなんでしょうか…

As a ""hidden object"" game it is not overly hard so you can actually get through it without using hints.

There is one small, somewhat annoying bug where the game sometimes doesn't let you click on a destination. When this happens, simply exit to menu, wait a few seconds and then continue and it should be resolved.

1) Когда во время задания я собирал вещи, меня выкидывало из ящика и приходилось заходить в него снова. 
2) В какой-то момент половина экрана стала белой.
3) В середине игры персонаж перестал реагировать на клики мышкой.
Чтобы исправить все это надо просто перезайти в игру.
Подведем итог.

1)3 карточки, которые окупают игру во время скидок.

3) банальный, но неплохой сюжет.
4)цена во время скидок

You're always forced to stay focused and look for subtle clues in your enviroment, and the aesthetics just makes the experience a whole lot better.

I knew from the Jet Dog Studios intro that this was, in fact, something I would enjoy.

The voices do not match up to mouth animations. I was not deterred.

First time leading man talks, his spoken lines do not match up to what is written in the text box.

Classic wheelin' and dealin' from receptionist. Thumbs up.

First creepy scene. You know what I mean(no spoilers). Was actually pretty good. Thumbs up. Short and sweet. 

In my youth, I loved Where's Waldo and the knock-offs, but I-Spy wasn't my thing, so the gameplay is knocked down a little due to a bias against. Although, the way the puzzles are introduced is well done.


-Glitch Report #1: After being locked in Astral Plane and told to search for mirror pieces, the game would not let me click on anything except to walk around. Had to return to main menu and continue. This fixed the issue.

-Glitch Report #2: When I reloaded to fix glitch #1, while I can click to search areas, when i click to check or pick up an item, it brings back to the walking section. Everytime. This makes searching very tedious. 

-Glitch Report #3: I reloaded, but #2 prevailed. So I continue, despite frustration. This lead to accessing a puzzle and half the items are whited out. Impossible to search for everything. Correction: I found everything very easily as they were about half of what was actually visible. Nice.... for a while. Until the items are in the white areas. Eventually have to keep using hints to show me where they are, so I can click them. Now I have to repair the mirror and half the screen is white.

-Glitch Report #4: I have one piece left. everytime i try to put it in place, it askes me ""Are you sure you want to skip puzzle?"" I keep saying no.

Glitches subside. Will let me take garlic and knives to a fight, but not the guns. I even had to find a bullet in a puzzle. I have at least one. Let me take the gun. Thumbs down.

Orlock didn't notice I was preparing a truth potion right in his fire? Got to Tv Station. I'm kinda bored, and was gifted two wishlist games. I'll go there for now.

Recommend: For ISpy fans, yes. Umm....4/5 for what it is. A find-the-item-puzzle game with a few walking sequences between puzzles and a very cheesy ""hollywood"" vampire love story. Might finish someday.",1447438893,1447439249,True,1,1,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In Sinister City gehören Vampire zum ganz alltäglichen Alltag und mischen überall mit.

Du spielst einen jungen Mann, der allerdings ein Mensch ist und gerne seiner Freundin einen Heiratsantrag machen würde. Doch diese verschwindet eines Tages spurlos. Somit beginnt deine Geschichte.


Zum Spiel selbst:

Bei diesem Spiel überwiegt vor allen Dingen das mehrfache Suchen von Gegenständen am gleichen Ort, z.B. 12 Lampen usw. Das wird auf die Dauer langweilig und monoton. Die gesuchten Gegenstände erschlagen fast einen und fallen einem meist direkt ins Auge, so groß wie diese gezeichnet sind. Allerdings bei wenig anderen musste man schon ganz genau hinsehen,da diese winzig in irgend eine Ecke geschoben wurden. Das wiederum frustet deutlich.

Aber das Größte Problem sind die vielen Bugs wo vorhanden sind wie z.B. Grafikfehler wo das Spielgeschehen drüben oder wo man sich auf der Karte nicht mehr bewegen kann und auf der Stelle eingefroren ist und so ein voranschreiten der Story nicht gewährleist. Die Bugs lassen sich aber alle beheben durch Neustart des Spiels, zumindest war es so bei mir. Die Story hat man in max. 3 Stunden durchgespielt, dies kommt aber auf euren Typ an.

Im Groß und Ganzen ist es ein unterhaltsames Spiel für einen Abend, dass auch witzige Szenen enthält und man manchmal schmunzeln muss, aber kein Spiel, das man mehrmals spielt. Ich von meiner Seite aus würde es trotzdem nocheinmal kaufen, aber nur wenn es im Sale ist und wer mit gelegentliche Bugs leben kann.",1447424114,1447431155,True,9,1,0.563343703746795654,0,True,False,False,False,,,

スマホ向けゲームの移植らしく、操作はマウスクリックのみ。

ゲーム内容としては簡単なパズルとアイテム探しだけ。あんまり楽しくはありません。

字幕とインタフェースは日本語に対応しているのですが、翻訳の精度に多少問題があります。
最初の探しものの時に「手袋」を探せと言われるが全く見当たらない。困ったぞと思い手当たり次第にクリックすると「地球儀」が正解でした。そうですね、GlobeとGloveの取り違えがあったようです。あるいは「弓」とあるのは「蝶ネクタイ」（bow）だったり、「ヤシ」とあるのは「手のひら」（palm）だったり、多義的な言葉にも弱いようです。幸いにもヒントは充実しているので答えはすぐに見つけられますけれど。

セリフの字幕にも多少違和感（主人公が女ことばになったり）はありますが、まあ物語の理解を妨げるほどではなかったです。たぶん。

背景の位置がずれてオブジェクトや人が浮いて見えたり操作がおかしくなるバグもありましたが、何せ9円。字幕の問題も含め、何か見つかるたび「どうせ9円だしな……」と優しい気持ちになって目をつぶってしまいます。

ゲーム内容が単純なだけに、本作に魅力を見出すには物語を評価するほかにないと言っても過言ではありません。
ストアページを眺めるとさらわれた花嫁とか吸血鬼とか古城とか「それっぽい」風を装ってますが、その実態は楽しいコメディです。
だいたい2時間くらいでクリアできますから、ちょいと安っぽい映画を1本見るくらいの気持ちで挑むとそれなりに満足できるかと思いますです。",1447334695,1447334695,True,2,4,0.527232825756072998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Even its puzzles are a laugh (to a point where one could theorize that maybe it wasn't intended as a parody of the vampire genre but of HOGs -hidden object games- in general).

Yes, it has a couple of funny moments here and there and yes, it's real cheap, but that doesn't make it a good game that's worth your time.

If you get it at it's current sale price (0,09 cents) you won't lose any money, since it has trading cards, but again, this doesn't make it a good game, just an affordable one.

If you like over-the-top, absurd comedies that feature vampires and don't mind glitches that could prevent you from finishing the game, then yes, it's worth it. You'll get a couple of chuckles and I have to admit, a funny HOG is a rare and refreshing thing. But that's about it.

I am tempted to give it a thumbs-up for it's campy glory, but it has some of the worst glitches I've ever seen in HOGs and that's one of the biggest faux-pas a game of this genre can have.

(By the by, just about anything published by Artifex Mundi should see you right if you're looking to get into the genre) But I'm writing one for Sinister City as I feel I need to come to its defence a little and share my own take on it.

It seems like such a cop-out when people say the only reason somebody doesn't like something is because they don't understand it. It's sort of a thinly-veiled way of calling someone stupid rather than accept they might understand it perfectly but just not like it, that they simply have a different preference than you. But after reading a lot of the negative reviews, this is one occasion where I actually feel like some people kinda didn't get it. As pretentious and w*nky as it is to say, there is a difference between something being parody, pastiche and just plain bad, and this game dips its toes into all three, which is where I think a lot of confusion comes from.

Let's get it out of the way and say what needs to be said, many parts of this game are bad, unintentionally so. Graphically it's kind of somewhere between looking like a PS2 and PS3 era game and there were quite a few times in the hidden object sections when I wished everything was clearer or more distinct. In other games in the genre these sections can have a more artistic slant with their high quality renders of interesting scenes and items. Here, everything is far more workmanlike and pretty forgettable; a straight on view of some open cupboards or top down into a box with a small handful of items in it. They don't feel hugely inspired. But worst of all are the bugs and glitches that plague the game. It happened to me a few times where some strange artifacting would appear in the form of white blocks across the screen and completely obscure my view, or every time I'd click anywhere in a hidden object scene it would kick me out of it forcing me to manually enter the scene repeatedly after every object I found. In fairness, this only happened to me in the second stage of the game then never bothered me again after (exiting to the main menu then hitting Continue eventually seemed to fix this for me. In some cases I think Steam pop-ups may have triggered this to happen, but I'm not completely sure). They were the only issues I had personally, but others have complained of far worse, like losing save data every time they closed the game or buggy achievements not registering properly, or in some cases, not even being able to start the game at all. And if anyone had these issues then they'd be absolutely right to give it a bad review as their experience with the title. But, thankfully, I had a far better time with it. Well... eventually.

You play as a sort of Tom Cruise lookalike trying to find his kidnapped fiancé and being lead to Sinister City in the search. A kindly old hotel receptionist tells him to stay away from there, that it's a vampire city, and the guy doesn't even bat an eyelid at the mention of vampires. Nor does he when he's invited to a session of telepathic communication to try tracking her down, he just accepts the offer and follows an old man into a darkened back room. I think pretty much everyone who plays it either laughs their *ss off at these points or else says it's stupid and loses all hope for the game, I know they were certainly my reactions. But then I got to a point where it just sort of clicked with me. I realised they understood these games are dumb and their stories make no sense, so they start having a little fun and going all out ridiculous with it. The head vampire kidnaps his own daughter to arrange for her to marry a kid's TV presenter to vicariously live out his own failed ambitions of movie stardom that he's secretly harboured for centuries. Oscar Wilde, this is not. But I love that they have fun with it rather than being so serious like most of the other games and I was surprised at how much I laughed at some genuinely funny moments in it. If you have to make a crazy, nonsense story, I think it's way better to go funny with it instead of trying to be respectable with how legit you are with your craft, and I applaud them for making that move here.

Like I said, if anyone had a bad experience with this on a technical level then I can't argue with that, and to begin with I was right there with them. But by the end this game thoroughly won me over and I had a great couple of hours with it. With some funny moments, some interesting hidden object play that I eventually came around to, and at least an attempt at a new variety of mini games for the genre, I can easily say this was the best 9 cents I've ever spent.",1446916908,1446916908,True,25,2,0.724684476852416992,3,True,False,False,False,,,

I have played several point-and-click, hidden object games at this point, and there are definitely some things that Sinister City does that I appreciate, albeit not well enough to not be a bit, frankly, dumb. 

Here's the break-down for me, + signs being positives and - being negatives.
+Incorporation of 3-dimensional character models. While most games of this type simply present you with a two-dimensional scene, in this you do actually have to move the protagonist, John, around in a space.
- However, on that same note, the areas where you can move are more or less two-dimensional and not all of them seem to have been designed with a character walking around them in mind. This results in some frankly hilarious looking scenes, like John and the TV Station security guard just hovering above the ground in front of the TV station, as if they were part of the door and not actual characters. 
+ Voice Acting - for a casual game of this type, it's actually really good.
- Except for John's voice. And he's the main character. So he talks all the time. (Ipkis is pretty bad too but you only have to talk to him a couple times)
- The background music isn't bad, but it is extremely repetitive.
- Game is short, even for a HOP game. 
+ Price. Guys for real, it's a dollar. Even if you end up despising it, are you really gonna cry over that dollar?
+ Story...it's satirical of your typical spooky vampire motif, which is actually genuinely amusing at times. Not funny, but amusing. Worthy of a slight smirk. Also, John and Nina's lovey-dovey-ness is so over the top that it becomes a humorous exaggeration of dime-a-dozen love stories. Whether or not this was intentional is debatable, but seeing it as satire makes it more bearable.
- Story ... buuuuutttt a lot of it feels rushed and nonsensical, even for a game about a town full of vampires (who completely openly exist and no one really questions it....?). Spoiler free example: When your character finds out his fiancee is being held in a town full of vampires, he at no point stops and says, ""Woah, man. Slow your roll. VAMPIRES? Vampires are real?"" He's basically Anakin Skywalker in Episode 3 of Star Wars, but without the death, (""Oh my god, what have I done? Waaaahhhhhhh""  ... ""So you wanna join the Dark Side?"" ... ""Yeah, okay."") He just immediately accepts something that you would think would be a hell of a revelation for your average human dude who just wants to get married.
- Saw the last bit of the ending coming a mile away.
+ All the characters actually have a unique design and personalities, however minimal those personalities may be.
+ Several objects in the HOPs were genuinely difficult to find, which I like.
- But all the other minigames were horrendously easy.

All in all, it really is a ""meh"" kind of thing for me. I didn't like it, but I didn't dislike it. Had it been fleshed out more into a bigger and longer story, and more time taken on animation, it could have been really good. The developers definitely have some skill; it's just in need of serious refinement. 
I labeled it as recommended in the end because of the price. It's only a buck, and there are definitely worse things to do when you're bored, and worse games that I've played for more money--on sale.",1446863048,1446863250,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sinister city is an Point & Click / Hidden Object game, that it's messed up. After 4 hours (4 boring hours), i have finished the game and i would like to give you my view points from this game.

- First of all the story doesn't have sense, as example you have to help a receptionist to find some documents, but 60% of them are behind him, is him so fucking lazy ?

- The graphic quality looks horrible (i don't care graphics like the rest of the people), have to say that to be a game made on 2014 looks horrible (like a PSX game) compared with other games from same dev.

- It has some bugs that makes you restart the game and start from the save point.

- It has teletubbies, seriously.

Something that i enjoyed was the voice actuation and some music background from stages.

I do not recommend you this game, unless it's on sale (just for a few cents), you have been warned.

PROS
====
1.) Pretty good puzzles and interesting locations
2.) Nice graphics
3.) Plenty of side puzzles to keep you amused
4.) $0.99, although I paid $0.49 with coupon

CONS
====
1.) Grphic glitches once in a while
2.) Game itself glitches (Sometimes won't let you click on stuff)
3.) Story is not the best, in fact it's not great at all
4.) Once in a while, some text doesn't match the voice
5.) Better to get it 50% off or better
6.) Sadly, there are better ""Hidden Objects"" games out there

Overall it's not THAT bad, but you may hate the graphic glitches it has.

+ Errungenschaften sind THEORETISCH beim 1. durchspielen erreichbar (Bugs)
+ Sammelkarten
+ geringer Preis (besonders im Angebot)

+/- veraltete Grafik und (steife unfreiwillig komische) Animationen

- Bugs, Glitches und Bugs
- seltsame Hitboxen 
- wildes Klicken und noch mehr wildes Klicken (Fehlen der Hinweise auf „interessante“ Stellen, sodass man in den Szenen und Wimmelbildspielen einfach alles anklicken muss, wenn man alles finden möchte.)

[b]Story [Achtung enthält kleinere Spoiler]:[/b]

Der Stiefvater in spe entführt die Verlobte von unserem „charismatischen“ Protagonisten (ich habe es irgendwie geschafft mir nicht mal seinen Namen merken zu können), weil dieser nicht gut genug für seine Tochter ist. Stattdessen soll diese zwangsverheiratet werden - mit einem Vampir seiner Wahl. Da der Protagonist John (ja, ich habe gerade nachgesehen) seine Verlobte dummerweise liebt, ist es nun an uns dies zu verhindern – mit allen Mitteln. 

[b]Zusammenfassung/Kommentar:[/b]

Dieses Spiel ist nicht total schlecht. Ich habe wirklich lange überlegt, ob ich das Däumchen nach oben oder unten gebe. Letztendlich stand der günstige Preis, für den man nicht so viel erwarten kann, gegen die negativen Aspekte, die dann doch überwiegen. 

Grundsätzlich finde ich den Preis für das Spiel mit 0,99 € in Ordnung, wenn da nicht die Bugs wären und die Tatsache, dass das Spiel irgendwie lieblos und unfertig wirkt oder wie ein Scherz der Spieleentwickler. 

Die Grafik empfinde ich als okay - natürlich ist sie nicht das Gelbe vom Ei. Und einige Animationen wirken unfreiwillig komisch aber damit kann ich gut Leben. Vielleicht liegt das einfach daran, dass ich bei einem Hiddenobjectgame, besonders für diesen Preis, nicht soviel erwarte. (Dafür hat man bei manchen Animationen ein bisschen was zum Schmunzeln. Ist doch auch etwas, oder?) 
Was bei mir jedoch den, bereits oben erwähnten, lieblosen und unfertigen Eindruck bewirkt hat, war der deutlich in der Luft stehende Charakter. Passiert in mindestens 2 Spielszenen und ist so deutlich, dass man es als Spieleentwickler eigentlich hätte sehen müssen. Liegt vielleicht daran, dass ich den Gedanken habe, dass man sein Werk als Spieleentwickler noch mal auf Bugs & Glitches prüft. Behindert nicht beim Spiel, wirkt aber nicht sehr professionell. 

In vielen Hiddenobjectgames gibt es einen Hinweis, wenn man über eine „interessante“ Stelle fährt. Meistens ist das wohl die Veränderung des Mauszeigers. Darauf wurde hier verzichtet oder es wurde vergessen. Die Folgen dessen sind absehbar: Man klickt ziemlich orientierungslos in den Szenen alles an, was verdächtig sein könnte. 
Und als wäre das nicht genug wiederholt sich das Ganze in den Wimmelbildszenen. Es gibt in diesen Szenen sehr häufig versteckte Gegenstände, die man erst findet, wenn man einen anderen Gegenstand verschoben hat. Somit klickt man wieder alles an, was man finden kann, weil es ein potenzielles Versteck sein könnte. Mich persönlich hat dieses stupide geklicke sehr schnell ermüdet und genervt.

Die Wimmelbildszenen sind von den versteckten Gegenständen mal abgesehen sehr einfach gehalten. Die meisten Sachen kann man sehr gut finden.

Die Hitboxen der Gegenstände sind teilweise etwas größer. Dies hat bei mir dazu geführt, dass ich manchmal Sachen gewertet bekam und eigentlich gar nicht wusste, was ich angeklickt haben soll. Das ist meist dann passiert, wenn die Gegenstände sehr eng beieinander waren. 
Kleinere Übersetzungsfehler haben sich ebenfalls eingeschlichen, hält sich aber gut in Grenzen. Ein Beispiel wäre: Palme = Handabdruck. 

Die eingebauten Minispiele empfand ich als sehr leicht, die meisten sollten daher kaum Probleme bereiten oder wirklich herausfordernd sein. 

Wer dennoch über die Anschaffung dieses Spiels nachdenkt, sollte sich mental auf mögliche Bugs vorbereiten. Ich hatte welche aber wenn ich mir die Reviews anschaue, muss das nicht immer zutreffen. Bei Interesse einfach mal Forum oder Reviews lesen dort stehen einige mögliche Bugs. 

Das größte Problem aber was ich mit dem Spiel habe: Es geht nicht in den Kopf. Zumindest nicht die positiven Dinge. Es sticht nichts wirklich heraus an was man später noch gerne zurückdenken würde. Es bleiben keine Minispiele oder Wimmelbilder wirklich hängen. Namen des Protagonisten und anderer Figuren? Bereits kurz nach dem durchspielen vergessen ...
 Was aber bei mir hängen geblieben ist, sind die Bugs und die Szenen in den unser menschlicher Charakter scheinbar in der Szenerie zu schweben scheint. 

[b][i]Fazit:[/i][/b] 
Ich habe mir die Frage gestellt: Würdest du dieses Spiel noch mal spielen wollen? Und die Antwort war: nein. Obwohl das Spiel nicht nur schlechte Seiten hat und mich auch mal herzhaft zum Lachen brachte, gibt es von mir leider keine Empfehlung – egal wie günstig es sein mag. Wer das Abenteuer dennoch wagen möchte, dem empfehle ich das Spiel im Angebot zu kaufen und dann Humor und ein paar Nerven mitzubringen.",1444405691,1444474427,False,5,0,0.587769925594329834,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Music and enviroment sound are normal, all characters talk to you but their performance do not allow them to win an Oscar :)

There are different kind of puzzles, mini games and tasks to find many objects from a list in the screen. 
 
The game is in third person and you move your character around different places clicking on the screen. There are some glitches but they aren't a big problem.

There is a hint button in a corner to help you. Depending on the level of difficulty, it refills quickest and tells you which are your next step.

There is no map available.

You can choose the difficulty between: easy and difficult but there is no difficult instead. 

The game has achivements and trading cards and you could finishit  easily obtaning all of them.

I think, this is one of the first games of this developer, because Alchemy Mysteries is much better because they learnt from the mistakes of this game.

A game to play if you are bored at home and  don't want to think a lot.

Tentei jogar Sinister City, mas a forma como o jogo funciona me frustrou bastante.

Prós:

- Legendado em PT-BR***
-Comprei o jogo num pacote por R$0,62 e o jogo dá cartas (bom para que vende, assim o jogo se paga e gera lucro e para quem gosta de fazer as insignias)

Contra:

-A interação dos Personagens 3d com o cenário 2D não é boa, muitas vezes o personagem aparece voando no cenário ou andando na parede. Além da movimentação do personagem ser desnecessária.

- Toda a tela é clicavel, então para encontrar o local correto para iniciar o jogo do Hidden Object torna o jogo chato, acaba não sendo um Click-to-Point  e sim um ""clique como louco em toda tela até encontrar o que procura"".

- Em 1hora de jogo ele ""bugou"" 2x onde... mesmo clicando no objeto correto, ou no local onde o se inicia o  Hidden Object nada acontece, quando isso ocorre tem se que voltar ao menu do jogo, clicar em continuar aí o jogo ""desbuga"". Isso é ruim demais! Pois quando aconteceu a primeira vez fiquei clicando em todo o cenário e nada... recorri ao botão de ajuda e este indicou um local o qual já havia clicado e continuei clicando. Fiquei com raiva e fui procurar informações na comunidade do jogo e descobri que quando isso ocorre, tem que sair do jogo e entrar novamente.

                                         -------------------------------------------------------

***  O único ponto positivo (ainda sim com ressalva) é que o jogo é legendado em PT-BR, Excelente que as Produtoras tenham essa preocupação em traduzir, porém se Você for jogar... Atenção. Alguns objetos tem seu nome alterado. 
Exemplo: ""Leque"" foi traduzido como ""ventilador de mão"".

caso tenha interesse em comprar este jogo, pese os prós e contras... Se Você não se importar com os Bugs ou simplismente aprender a ignorar; consegue-se jogar.

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Easy and Advanced.

There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary. The inventory panel automatically comes stationary.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists and Find 'x' amount. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions. (Please be aware that in one of the hidden object scenes, there is a bug/glitch, it causes you to exit the scene every time; when you collect the item. Reinstalling the game would fix the problem.)

The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.

There are seventeen different achievements to unlock from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.

Miscellaneous

There are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its' Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. Even though there was a glitch/bug in the game. The replay value for the game is low. I would not recommend this game.",1443365388,1601355815,False,10,0,0.621278822422027588,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It doesn't take itself remotely seriously, and there are some serious weaknesses in the game design.

If you're just looking for some brief, cheap, casual fun, though, Sinister City can be just the quick, entertaining, romp you need.  The puzzles are few, the HO scenes pretty easy, so there's little to distract you from running through the goofy, parodic story that plays around with the classics of vampire film.  While there's nods to [i]Nosferatu[/i] and Lugosi's classic portrayal of Dracula, Sinister City clearly draws its influence from schlockier fare like [i]Plan 9 from Outer Space[/i] and the low-budget Hammer Horror films.  If not laugh-out-loud funny, the story is at least far more entertaining than a typical HOG plot.

Gameplay is the weakness here.  Your next action is frequently unintuitive; you often cannot pick up an item you'll obviously need until explicitly told to collect it.  At one point, an object's graphic failed to load, leaving me to collect a white rectangle.  At another time, the game glitched so that I could not progress -- exiting and reopening the game solved the problem, though.  Finally, Sinister City relies on a mechanism where objects that are not your current targets must be clicked to move them, to discover target objects behind them.  This means you must click pretty much everything, rather than just hunting targets.  What's more, an object that was immobile in a previous visit to an HO screen might spontaneously become movable at a later time, requiring you to click everything on every visit to a screen, in order to not miss a potentially hidden target object.

At the price, especially if on special, I can't not recommend this game.  Tolerate the gameplay; enjoy the story.",1443328725,1443328725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- Very few objects repeated
- More objects to find in the puzzles than their other games
- Easy to follow story
- Steam Acheivments and Trading Cards
- Price
- Nice cutscenes
- Soundtrack Free as DLC (though I don't particularly rememeber the music for this game it's always nice when a game has a free soundtrack.)

Cons:
- Length, This game is easily completable in an hour and a half on advanced mode which means even longer of just leaving it open to idle while waiting for cards to drop if you want those.
- Whlle the voice acting was more varied in this than their other two games i didn't find it very enjoyable.
- No Replayability
- Bugs, This game isn't as polished, twice I encountered bugs where every time I clicked one of the objects in the puzzle it would back me out and I would have to go back into the puzzle. Only fixable by restarting the game.
- No fast travel, This shouldn't really be a complaint but when both of their other games have it and this one doesn't with even more back tracking it really needed it.
- Normal hints on the puzzle are fine but this game really doesn't tell you where you need to go most of the time where the other two did via their fast travel system.

Overall Score: 6/10 I was pretty harsh on this game, it was the first hidden object game I played by Jetdogs Studios and the least enjoyable. It's still a playable game and has a good amount of hidden object gameplay to it but it's just not quite the same quality as their other products. I would be giving it a 5 instead of a 6 due to the bug i encountered twice but I didn't see anyone else complaining about the same bug, Additionally the free soundtrack is a nice touch.

In the end if you need a hidden object game there are better to play and worse to play, If you enjoy games by Jetdogs by all means get this you can tell it's one of their games. But if you haven't played one by them play their other ones first, Save this one for later so you don't put yourself off of the experiances their games can provide.",1443234787,1443234969,True,3,0,0.563931524753570557,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is insane and the voice-acting is terrible but these seem to be the norm for the more basic games of the genre. 

It's okay, but far from the first Hidden Object game you should try. I paid 15p for it in a sale and i'd be annoyed if i'd paid any more than that for what the game offers, especially as in total it offers around 4 hours gametime for 2 play-through's on both modes.
""Normal"" mode though is a joke as if you just stop to look for 5 seconds then the screen lights-up telling you where everything is, it doesn't give you nearly enough time to search for yourself.

Objects to be moved bear no distinction to background objects. So often you will find you cannot see what you need on the screen and you have no way of knowing which objects can be pushed aside to reveal more.
The only way to get around this is to play it on ""Normal"" difficulty and have the game tell you where you're supposed to be going next then remember for the next time. I can't imagine playing ""Advanced"" mode without this knowledge; it would be uber-frustrating. 

The game is locked to a 4:3 image stretched to widescreen: there is no option to reset the ratio. This is the first and only game that has ever done this to me so i just ignored it and played regardless; not going to upset my gfx settings for 1 game.

Sinister City - очень приятный и несложный квест.
Обычно, меня квесты раздражают сильно - ту же Deponia выдержал всего 1.5 часа, 
а Sinister City прошел до конца и с удовольствием.
У нее есть много плюсов:
Достаточно короткая, чтобы не надоесть;
Приятная графика;
Удачно подобранная музыка;
Очень низкая цена;
Интересный геймплей;
Достаточно простые головоломки;
Карты Steam;
Есть несколько удачных шуток;

Любителям идеальных игр тоже понравится, т.к. получить все достижения достаточно просто.

Минусы:
Только одно разрешение экрана (хотя бы можно в оконный вид перейти - и на том спасибо)

Gameplay:

Sinister City - a very pleasant and easy quest.
Usually, quests irritate me greatly - the same Deponia survived only 1.5 hours,
but Sinister City i went to the end with pleasure.
She has a lot of pluses:
Short enough to not get bored;
Nice graphics;
Well-chosen music;
Very Low price;
Interesting gameplay;
Fairly simple puzzles;
Steam cards;
And some good jokes;

Lovers of perfect games like it too, because get all achievements is quite simple.

Minuses:
Only one screen resolution (at least you can go to the window view - and thanks for that)

Let me get the first thing out of the way; the graphics are terrible, the voice acting doesn't match the movements of the characters. I often found the main character standing in places that made no sence (Ie, outside of the hotel, floating in the middle of the door, or standing on top of the garbage can) That is the only bad things I am saying about Sinister City in this review - so if you can't over look those, you can move along now.

Now to the good points: It's very, very original. I love the storyline, I adore the characters, and despite not lining up correctly, I love the voice acters. You do enough moving around the game that it doesn't get boring easily, although at the same time I would love if it had some more variety to it - although that's not a big issue. It can be slightly hard to find your main objective objects in scenes if you're not sure what you're doing, so I reccomend playing on beginner's mode first.

Now the main conclusion... Even if you can't or don't want to get through this full game on your own, I promise it is worth it. It is a fairly short game (Maybe about 2 hours for me to complete), but the ending scenes are so funny, and really make a nice tie-in for the end of the game. Over all, I reccomend this game - more so to those who have good patience- and am definately going to play it again.

There are very poor tutorials and the graphics feel a little dated, then again this could be just a re-port of an older title.  When compared to other HOG games I have played this game does not seem very polished.  The voice acting is hokey,  Im not sure if it is intentional or not but it is not very good. The graphic are okay I guess but the lips of the characters don't appear to syc up with the speech.  The game comes off like a very jerky hybrid of a point and click adventure game that is trying to be an HOG game, and the soundtrack doesn't fit with the game in my opinion.

[h1]Pros :[/h1]
[list]
[*]This game do hidden object thing well, the objects are blend well with the background. 7/10
[*]There are many mini games and puzzles. It's not too hard and not too easy either, even a kid can play this game. 9/10
[*]Full voice over, though the actor is not experienced enough with voice tone. I give more scores to a game with full voice over than ordinary games. Voice actors are not cheap. 7/10
[*]Achievements are few and easy to get. I don't like games with plenty of hard and troublesome achievements. 9/10
[/list]

[h1]Cons :[/h1]
[list]
[*]Plain story. Really... The ending is awkward
[*]I see an object with just a blank white box. It seems that the texture is missing.
[*]In some screen, the background and the npc is not matched. See my screenshot. John looked like he's floating. He should had appear lower.
[*]The dialog between John and NPC is kind of weird.

It's a tongue-in-cheek vampire Hidden Object Game (HOG) that's got good graphics, nice puzzles and mini-games, and darn good voice acting (far better than the norm for the HOG genre).  The story is simple but interesting and the poking of fun at normal HOGs is really well done.  But, the game does suffer from bugs and some irritating design decision.

The poor design decisions are firstly that if you're playing the game in either Easy or Advanced mode, the cursor does not change to indicate hot, live, or actionable areas.  That means that as you search the scene, you have no idea if you can pick something up, use something, open a HOG or mini-game, talk to someone, or even just leave the scene.  Easy mode puts a sparkle on the screen after a few seconds for the next thing you should be doing.  But, you end up watching for that and blindly following it instead of thinking about what's showing.  In Advanced mode, there's no sparkle.  So, you're essentially reduced to just clicking on everything possible in the hopes that something will happen.  Secondly, the mini-games have no instructions at all.  It's not just that there's nothing telling you how you need to manipulate things.  It's also that there's no explanation of what the win-state (i.e., what you're supposed to do) is.  And finally, In the HOGs, the items you're searching for can be so small as to be indistinguishable.  Similarly, the HOG scenes usually have in-focus/out-of-focus, lighted/non-lighted areas implying where you're supposed to be looking for things.  Nope.  The items can be anywhere at all (the out of focus ones were a real treat).

As for bugs, I first tried playing the game in Advanced mode.  I quickly got to a point where nothing I clicked on would activate anything.  I could do no HOGs nor leave the scene.  I had to start a new game in Easy mode to play.  There are also several places where the character floats over the pavement.  In one such scene, there IS no pavement.  The characters are both floating in air.

It's a shame that those issues are spoiling an otherwise very good game.  But, at the current list price of $0.99, I can live with it (it took me 2.4 hours for my playthrough on Easy -- but I still have to go through on Advanced to get 100% Achievements).  So, I'm recommending the game.

EDIT:  I've confirmed the bug I ran into earlier.  In Advanced mode, once you're given the task to collect the magic keys to unlock the mirror, none of the active points will activate.  IOW, you can't enter the two HOGs in the area to get what you need and you can't leave the area to get some other items and unlock the mirror.  I worked around this by exiting the game, re-entering it, and selecting Continue.  When the game loaded up the scene where I was, I could finish the scene (and game) without further problems.",1441489629,1441548465,True,3,0,0.502713561058044434,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Abbiamo un buon potenziale da avventura punta e clicca azzoppato da una scrittura e da uno spirito del tutto fuori luogo. Forse sono io a non averlo preso per il verso giusto, ma il modo in cui è narrato fa piangere il cuore ad ogni appassionato di vampiri, sembra una manifestazione di ""american idiots"" in salsa Dracula.

Il gameplay è basico, si può muovere il personaggio per la stanza (a volte per qualche bug non si può), per osservare questa o quella zona di interesse, e lì bisogna cliccare su tutta una serie di oggetti da collezionare. Alla lunga è sempre la stessa minesta e ci si annoia, però la qualità di certi disegni lo rende gradevole. 

La traduzione italiana è volenterosa ma sballata e risulta del tutto fuorviante quando si vuole collezionare un oggetto che non corrisponde minimamente al nome indicato. Un pò a casaccio un pò per intuizione ci si arriva.

Paradossalmente, se avesse avuto meno pretese, sarebbe stato un gioco molto più interessante. Non c'era bisogno di animazioni 3D e di legnose animazioni, così come la scrittura di quei dialoghi e il loro doppiaggio fanno venir voglia di suicidarsi.

Ecco, avete presente i b-movie? Questo è un b-game, totalmente privo di atmosfera, con un finto umorismo fuori luogo.
Lo stile da punta e clicca funziona solo in parte, e troppa ripetitività.

Spoof parody of vampires and B-rated flicks in Hollywood, complete with an otaku vampire fan boy of Bela Lugosi and Nosferatu who wants to become an actor and play Count Dracula in his own film.  Since the otaku fan boy is having a mid-life crisis (at 500 years old), he is causing grief for his daughter and her fiance, who has come to find her.

For the amusement value alone this game is worth the playthrough (and the price of 99 cents).  How serious can the storyline (or the characters, for that matter) really be when the News Station is called ""Plan 9""? 

Trivia 1: Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) starring Bela Lugosi directed by Ed Wood is considered to be the worst creature feature ever made. 
Trivia 2:  Bela Lugosi's protrayal of Dracula (1931) in some circles is still considered one of the best. 
Trivia 3: The 1922 black and white German silent film 'Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror' is considered to be a cinematic influential masterpiece, and even by today's standards is still considered to be one of the best Dracula movies ever made.  (Dracula's name in the film was changed to Count Orlock.) 
Trivia 4: Jonathan Harker and ""Mina"" Murray were the bethrothed and eventually married ""lovers"" in Bram Stroker's 'Dracula'.

Gameplay is twitchy and glitchy (if stuck just exit the game then hit continue when coming back).  There are no  instructions for any puzzles, so previous puzzle experience and a bit of intuition is needed.  (I got stuck once and had to look up the solution, which is randomized I discovered on a different playthrough.)  Plenty of HO scenes to do, and not the usual type of getting an object at the end.  I sorta wondered the entire time why the HOs scenes were even there but they do serve a purpose.  In some ways this game feels like an experiment in third person play by Jet Dogs Studios and reminscent of how Syberia and Niburu plays, without defined instructions on what to do or where to look.     

Worth a look and at least one playthrough just for the campy cheesiness of it.  (This would be perfect fodder for MSTies  (Mystery Science Theatre 3000)).",1441298507,1488674657,True,10,1,0.648978710174560547,2,False,False,False,False,,,

おすすめしないの表示ですが、自分はそれなりに楽しめました。
とはいえセール時に9円で買ったからプレイしたようなものです。
というか9円じゃなきゃ見向きもしないと思うよ！

一言で言えばモノ探し(おつかい)＋パズルのミニゲーム集。
スマホとかでありそう…というかタップとか書いてる時点でスマホやタブレット向けだコレ！

ストーリーは重々しそうなテーマな割には真逆で軽いノリで進んでいきます。
B級と書かれてますがC級のノリです。そういう意味では先の展開が全く読めないと言っても過言じゃない。
最後のオチは…まぁあれでいいか。いいだろう。いいとしよう！

このゲームの特徴として、カジュアルモードにはガイド機能がついています。
一定時間なにもしないでいると次に探すべき場所が光ります。その光った場所でモノ探しをすればいいだけです。
そして、時間回復するヒントボタンが搭載されており、モノ探しパートでも難なく探しものが見つかります。

ゲームとしてはかなり単調、ただし[b]やってる間の没入感[/b]は意外とあります。
とはいえ、クリア後の達成感は先述のガイド機能のせいでほぼ無し…というか一ゲーム終わらせた後のなんとも言えない疲労感が襲ってきます。
そのため、クリアだけしたいならこれからプレイするジョン(主人公の名前)は買ってインストールしたあとぶっ通しでやってください。
途中で中断するとまず再開することはないでしょう。まずガイド機能を使わずとも2時間ちょっとでできますし。

最後に、Sinister Cityは悪いゲームでもつまらないゲームでもありません。
自分には終わった後に疲労感が大きく残ったので、あえておすすめしないをつけただけです。やっている間の没入感は本当にあります。
でも買うならセールの時に買うべきかもしれない。

しっかしこういうゲームの楽しみ方って何かに似てるんだよなぁ…

Cheesy B-movie acting, a plot that doesn't even pretend to take itself seriously, and some amusing jokes - for a mere $0.10 on sale I really can't complain too much!  It was a little dull at times, and the excuses for making you go find stuff were lame, but it was a couple of hours of mild entertainment for almost nothing.

The characters who inhabit Hidden Object Games are some of the messiest people I've ever seen - I'm no longer surprised by the piles of junk they seem to have in all their cupboards and corners and desks.  Unfortunately in this game, some of the objects you were asked to find were barely visible behind other objects (just a tiny piece poking out), were hard to see clearly, were named oddly, or were completely hidden behind other objects that you probably wouldn't know you could move unless the hint sparkles told you so...  

Speaking of which, the 'easy' mode was far too easy.  Pause in your random clicking for mere seconds and the game would show you what you needed to find, without you asking it for help.  That said, though, some tasks or locations seemed so obscure that I'm not sure I would have known I could look closer at a particular spot in the room if it hadn't shown me.

I did encounter one bug, where the game refused to respond to my clicking and I thought I'd have to restart, but it was fixed by going to the main menu and then continuing the game.  Other than that, the only issues I encountered were with the clicks picking up objects I wasn't actually clicking on in some cases, which may have something to do with it apparently being a mobile port (I presume, what with it telling you to 'tap here' or to swipe the screen in order to complete a mini game).

I had a few laughs while playing, and especially at the end credits - I'm not sure I would have been happy to pay full price even though it IS cheap, but on sale it's worth a play through.  Just don't expect anything serious and you'll be okay!  :)",1441078671,1444796872,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You will spend the entire hour or so of this game in constant fear and...Whoops!

Got my intros mixed up.

Your fiance has been kidnapped by a vampire! Are you a bad enough dud to rescue your fiance?! Action and adventure await in Sinister City!

Hmm..Nope...That one kinda sucks too.

Truth is, there's not much to discuss when it comes to Sinister City. Not too long ago, this game was on sale for around 10 cents. On top of that, it has cards, so you're all but guaranteed to profit off of the purchase. Therefore, I'm going to assume that you already own this game, and are just reading this review because you assume there will be some funny jokes.


You know what they say about assumptions right?

In the interest of being ""helpful"" I'll talk about the actual game. Sinister City is a hidden-object puzzler. Look for the object, find the object, click on the object, become a winner. I must warn you though, the objects tend to be hidden. Occasionally there are puzzles to break up the monotony, but nothing too strenuous. For those exceedingly rare situations that you're actually stuck, a handy ""HELP!"" button is always nearby.

Not all hidden-object games are equal, and Sinister City is IMO an example of a mediocre one. The images are of a lower resolution, which makes objects muddy and difficult to spot. Yeah I know, it sounds ironic when you think about it, but bear with me on this. Another unfortunate technical issue is the prevalence of bugs. These can range from disappearing images to the game no longer properly responding to your inputs. Thankfully, these are usually cleared up by quitting to the main menu. The game saves automatically and constantly, so all you have to fear is those wacky vampires, not the possibility of losing progress.

The following couple paragraphs include SPOILERS!


----SPOILERS----

This next aspect is not so much a complaint about Sinister City, but about adventure games in general. All too often they rely on this logic that is baffling to normal human behavior. At one point in this game you have to find some books so that somebody will talk to you. There is an abandoned bookstand nearby, but the protagonist doesn't want to steal the books. In order to pay for these $20 books, he finds 75 cents in loose change scattered on the ground. If that made too much sense, consider that the protagonist steals a key from the bookstore to open a mailbox. 

Sinister City's attempts at humor are also...pretty laughable. Early on the protagonist acquires some vampire hunting equipment. He's getting geared up to kill a vampire, but then some guy points out that not everything is as it seems. The protagonist takes a closer look at a stake he picked up, and he finds the words ""MADE IN CHINA"" engraved on it. The ""Made in China"" gag is as old as time, but it doesn't work when written on a stake. A stake is a piece of wood sharpened to a point. It's possible that the Chinese stake is actually made of soft rubber, but wouldn't the protag notice that? Here's a thought: Crosses are also commonly used to fight vampires. So how about having the Cross say ""MADE IN CHINA"". Eh? Eh? Okay whatever. The point is this, when you're trying to make a gag out of something that's almost impossible to screw up, it doesn't really work. Yes, I have a nasty habit of nitpicking. What can I say? I love talking about mistakes. 

----END OF SPOILERS! YOU CAN BREATHE EASY NOW.----


Even with its faults, Sinister City is still an enjoyable romp. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, the voice-acting is amazing, and the game ends before you get tired of it. I'm not usually one to recommend bad games - even the ones that are ""purposefully"" bad - simply because they take too long to complete. This game delivers on hidden objects and puzzles, which is always nice to have when you're not in the mood for more Counterstrike or DOTA2 or Sakura Angels. It's nothing difficult, but at least it'll give you something to do if you have an hour or so to burn.",1440958537,1440958628,True,8,0,0.633213937282562256,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Os puzzle é até interessante bem legal até que gostei. Mais não é nada impossivel qualquer um que tenha um celebro consegue fazer em menos de 5 min Qualquer um.

- Have 3D model and Voiceacting for such budget title

The review

This game is an extremely short and extremely easy hidden-object puzzle game. It's very silly and the whole plot is just finding your girlfriend, freeing her and [spoilers]kickstarting her vampire father's film career[/spoilers]. Voice acting is bad and the texts don't match the lines, but due to overall campy feel of the game I really didn't mind.

Gameplay consists of you mostly clicking a person / object and seeing what he / it wants / needs, finding the items from nearby and then usually solving a puzzle of sorts. Some of these necessary items are often hidden behind some other items that are involved in a hidden object game, totalling to about 11-16 items (5 at a time), the last of which usually has the final items you are looking for hidden behind them. It's really simple and usually you can just get through most of it by randomly clicking the obvious items in the scene. If you want all of the achievements though, check the items required and then click through 5 of them (the hidden objects, not the quest items) in 10 seconds to get the achievement, that's basically the only one needing bit more effort.

The puzzles are the most interesting part in this game (beside just seeing the silly plot and clunky conversations go by). Unfortunately there were like 2 or 3 puzzles requiring actual thought while the others were passable by randomly doing stuff or just matching things together. There's not much explanation to them, but they're so simple a child will understand their point, you really don't need the included hint system. (also there's an achievement if you don't!)

- Funnily, you can actually tell the main character to walk somewhere in the scene, but it really has no function as clicking on hotspots trigger them immediately. 

That's about it. Game really doesn't span far. I played it 100% through on hardest difficulty in ~2h. More lucky person can probably do it in less time. Well, here's the pros and cons.

Pros:
+ Cheap (like really, got it for 9 cents)
+ Campy (got a few chuckles from some events, couple unexpectedly silly ones too)
+ Money's worth of entertainment and ultra-light brain exercise
+ Achievement icons look pretty cool
+/- Easy even on hardest difficulty

Cons:
- Some bugs (backgrounds messed up or characters floating in the backgrounds, also one time (in the psychic dimension) game didn't let me click any hotspots, closed and restarted the game and it worked again though)
- Typos
- Lame story (and there's barely any of it)
- Harder puzzles can be calculated with a single quaternary digit
- Finger got tired from all the basically useless random clicking
+/- Bad acting
+/- Easy even on hardest difficulty

It really depends on who you are. Personally, I can't find interest in this game.

And more fetch quests. [b]And more fetch qu-[/b] 

[b]You get my point.[/b]

This game is a point-and-click game. Except, it's like one of those games from the old Windows 95 days. The ""scene"" is just a poorly made background that was quickly thrown together, the only 3D-ish models are the important characters (even the models are poorly programmed), and the diologue is bland as raisins. Now, when I say point-and-click, this will be NOTHING like The Walking Dead (trust me, being a VERY HUGE FAN of TWD, this is NOWHERE near comparable to the games) and like I said, rather it's more of an old point-and-click adventure game.

This game will appeal to you if you-
1. Love old classic games.
2. Love old classic point-and-click adventure games.
3. Don't mind incredi-bad voice acting.
4. Love dull love stories. Because that's what this game is.
5. Are over the age of 20 (because you'll know what an old point-and-click adventure game feels like)

This game will NOT appeal to you if you-
1. Are a normal person.


Cons:
- Incredi-bad voice acting
- Bland ""love"" storyline
- Bland environments
- Unintresting and nonmemorable characters and diologue
-  Horrible gameplay style (fetch-quests in a 2D environment)
- ANNOYING AS FUCK SOUNDTRACK

Pros:
- I bought this game for $0.09. So can you.

I have enountered a bug in the game but it was easily fixed by going to the menue and then continuing the game. This game is easily worth the 9c I paid when it was on sale and I am sure is worth the $.99 too. The biggest thing you need to remember as others have said this is not a serious game and I am sure you will enjoy it too.
One more thing afer now finishing the game, it is fairly short and is no more than 4 hours which I would say makes the price right.

It is visually appealing as far as character design graphics, but it has standard bland backgrounds and props. The puzzles are 99% typical hidden item interactions and mini-games, with only one that stood out as unique. The click and touch recognitions are wonky in spots, but a majority operational.  The audio and dialogue are bland at best. Support for the game is untested, as it was unneeded. I was able to complete the game on both easy and advanced in a total of about 4 hrs of gameplay. It has very little replay value beyond its second playthrough.

In short, on my 10-point scale of rating games based on Concept, Appearance, Content & Replay Value, Mechanics, and Sound I would have to give Sinister City a 5/10. This is an overall decent game, but has very little replay value, is short in content, and contains minor flaws.

Příběh se zdá být docela normální.. ze začátku.
Klasická hledačka ""staršího"" typu.

Poté co pomalu ale jistě postupujete v příběhu se vám otevřou oči.
Hned ve druhém ""levelu"" jsem narazil na první problém a to že při prohledávání lokace kliknutím na cokoliv (i na to co máte hledat) vás hra vyhodí ven z prohledávání místo toho aby se ukázal červený X. (Restart hry to opraví)

Pokud by vám ani tohle nestačilo, hra vám nabídne mnohem více! Například bílý čtvereček kolem předmětů.
Při otevření Steam Overlay ve hře mi hra spadla a NIC se neuložilo.
Postavy v některých úrovních levitují.. přesně tak! Jednoduše stojí ""ve vzduchu"".
Pozadí v některých úrovních vůbec nesedí a opět vytváří iluze levitujících postav.
Pravé oko postavy za kterou hrajete ""svítí"".. co je to.. robot?
V nastavení je možnost změnit hlasiost zvuků ve hře. Bohužel mi nefunguje.
V nastavení není žádná možnost změnit rozlišení obrazovky. (Kromě vypnout/zapnout fullscreen)
[spoiler]Vaše výbava proti upírům je Made In China.. jop. I ten otesaný klacek je vyrobený v číně! :D[/spoiler]

Při dohrání hry jsem získal 4 achievementy zárověň, získal jsem také achievement za ""Dohraj hru v advanced modu"" i když jsem hru dohrál poprvé na easy. (Ze 4 achievementů mám po restartu jen 2..)

A když už jsme u toho.. advanced režim. V advanced režimu se vám nezobrazuje ""jiskra"" u předmětů které máte najít nebo u lokací které můžete prohledat + nevidíte váš objective. Také je tam napsáno že jsou větší cooldowny u nápověd.. i když v easy režimu čekáte cca 3 sekundy, v advanced režimu čekáte 5.

Dále mě jako u každé hledačky dostane získávání informací od NPC.
Všechno postupuje následovně:
Váš úkol je promluvit si se ženskou aby vám řekla informace. ""Dobře vše ti povím ALE počkej najdi mi karty!"" (donesete jí karty a vyřešíte puzzle) ""Jsi dobrý. takže je to tak že.. POČKEJ kde jsou moje pytlíčky s čajem??!"" (donesete jí čaj) ""O čem jsme to mluvili? Jasně informace.. POČKEJ nejdřív musíš aktivovat tyhle kraviny!"" (o 1000 let později) ""Dobře, takže věc se má tak že POČKEJ bolí mě hlava, kde jsou moje prášky? Jsou na stole, přines mi je!"" (Vyřešíte další puzzle..........)

A co se stane potom?! Nevíte? Řekne vám že si máte promluvit se ženskou naproti a HÁDEJTE CO SE STANE..
Nic vám neřekne dokud pro ní nenajdete X věcí a neuděláte X zbytečných úkolů!!!!

Dobré prvky: Hra má konec, ""příběh"" a dá se dohrát. Achievementy a steam karty.

Příběh?
Co se stane když vezmete špatný horor, špatný humor, Drákulu, Detektivku a pár filmů o upírech a hodíte to do mixéru a stisknete tlačítko ""kaše""?

[h1]Výborné technické zpracování... nebo ne? [/h1]
Už po prvním spuštění vám bude jasné, že tohle nebude žádný extra zážitek. Čemuž také odpovídá cena, ale o tom až později. Kvalita grafického zpracování je celkem ucházející, i když postavy vymodelované v 3D moc nepasují do prostředí a působí tak jako pěst na oko. Animace tu také nejsou kdovíjak kvalitní a pokud bych měl ještě nějak okomentovat kvalitu dabingu, tak nic moc.

Co tu ale vyniká je hudba, především hlavní hudební motiv (což je snad jediná skladba hrající na pozadí), která je sice průměrná, ale tak nějak hezky doplňuje tajemnou atmosféru. I když... tajemnou... ehm...

[h1]Příběh jako z céčkového filmu[/h1]
Nekvalita technického zpracování by zas tak moc nevadila, kdyby se povedl aspoň ten příběh. Bohužel i zde musím všechny zklamat. A abych to dovedl do dokonalosti, vypíšu ho zde celý... Takže následovat budou spoilery.

[spoiler]Na začátku hry zjistíte, že vaše unesená snoubenka se nachází v Sinister City, což je město plné upírů a asi i dalších potvor. Posléze odhalíte, že ji unesl její otec (upír), který chce, aby se provdala za slavného herce (taktéž upíra) a byla z ní také herečka, i když ona po téhle kariéře netouží. Po zhruba půlce hry zjistíte, že její otec si tímhle léčí své komplexy, kdy sám chtěl být hercem, ale stydí se. Tudíž ho uspíte, unesete jeho dceru, on se pro ni vydá do studia a tam se s ním dá do řeči režisér, který jej obsadí do svého nového filmu. Tečka. [/spoiler]

Příběh je tu opravdu stupidní a i když je nepředvídatelný, tak je místy tak trapný, až si říkáte, jestli je tohle vůbec možné. Nejhorší na tom je, že hra se zpočátku tváří jako horor (nebo spíš tak chce vypadat), ale brzy se změní v trapnou komedii, která ničí odkaz upírů ještě více, než se to povedlo filmové sérii Stmívání.

Kvalitu příběhu ani nezachrání pozdější pokus o vtipy, které působí křečovitě a moc nepasují do hry. Jako kdyby si tvůrci ke konci uvědomili, že tohle nemá šanci moc uspět, tak si aspoň udělají srandu z některých věcí...

Postavy tu jsou takové nijaké, dost často mají opravdu stupidní dialogy, někdy se chovají v určitých chvílích tak, jak by se snad nikdo nechoval a mnohdy řeší totálně zbytečné věci. Dost dobrým příkladem je výroba lektvaru pravdy v kanceláři onoho otce hlavní hrdinky, přímo před jeho očima a v jeho krbu, přitom mu poté tuto dobrotu nabídnete a on ji bez váhání vypije...

[h1]Co mám dělat dál? [/h1]
Pokud se doteď nesla recenze v negativním duchu, tak vězte, že právě teď začíná peklo. Jako každá HOG hra se i tato spoléhá na hledání předmětů. Jenže! U lokací, se kterými můžete provést interakci (typicky dveře nebo nějaká HOG scéna) se vám nijak nezmění kurzor myši, takže jen slepě hádáte, na co jde kliknout a na co ne. Což vede k dost frustrujícím momentům, že prostě jen klikáte všude kolem sebe a čekáte, kdy se spustí ona kýžená HOG minihra.

A když už jsem se zmínil o těchto minihrách, musím dodat ještě další mínus. Grafická kvalita těchto obrazovek je strašně špatná, dost často rozmazaná, u některých předmětů navíc trčí jen malinký kousíček. A dost mě rozesmálo, že jsem kurzor myši neměl nikde v blízkosti oněch hledaných předmětů, klikl jsem a i přesto jich takhle pár úspěšně zmizelo.

Na druhou stranu musím pochválit hádanky, kterých tu bohužel není moc, ale jsou celkem originální a v této hře působí opravdu výborně (na rozdíl od zbytku).

[h1]Bugy, bugy všude[/h1]
Do 30 minut jsem narazil na čtyři bugy:
[olist]
[*]Hlavní postava se nějak naučila levitovat.
[*]U jedné HOG minihry mě po nalezení jednoho předmětu hra vždy vykopla z dané lokace, takže jsem se tam musel neustále vracet.
[*]Po jednom videu nešlo vůbec nic dělat na mapě.
[*] I když jsem na začátku hry vybral obtížnost Advanced, hra se tvářila, že hraju na Easy a já si toho všiml až tehdy, když jsem v menu našel položku Advanced Mode, která byla neodškrtnutá. Nicméně i tak jsem dostal achievement za to, ale pak mě Steam ten achievement smazal... Jako WTF?!
[/olist]

První tři bugy šly naštěstí vyřešit prostým vypnutím a opětovným zapnutím hry. Ale neměly by tu v první řadě vůbec být!

[h1]Plusy[/h1]
+ hlavní hudební motiv
+ zajímavý název hry
+ malá cena (po prodeji kartiček z této hry je možné si něco málo vydělat)

[h1]Konečný verdikt[/h1]
[b]Mé hodnocení: 1/10[/b]

Během těch dvou hodin, co jsem tuhle hru hrál, se ve mě střídalo tolik negativních pocitů, až jsem si říkal, že v tom nemá cenu pokračovat. Na druhou stranu ale toto dílo občas vynikalo, protože se tu navrstvilo tolik absurdností, až mě to rozesmálo. Což ale asi nebyl záměr tvůrců (kteří jsou mimochodem z ČR). Věděl jsem, že hra je to špatná, ale až takhle špatná? Snad nic tu nefunguje dobře, od trapného příběhu, přes otřesnou technickou stránku hry až po hromadu bugů.

If you want a short (about 2-3 hours for most players) HOG, this is a very good choice. I DO recommend getting it on sale however.

This game is especially a good choice if you have an older system or one that has overheating issues, as it will not put a lot of strain on the system like the modern games would.

Сюжет, не остается в памяти, и вы явно не будете пересказывать его друзьям сидя в баре или в другом богатым на истории месте.

Гемплей, ребят это Point to Click, гемплей уже описан в жанре. Тем более игра ничего нового в этот жанр не приносит.
Звук, порой будто слышишь бесплатные пресеты из рэпчика школьника о своих проблемах.

Игра типичный проходняк, по скидке за рублей 10-20 можно взять. Затем игра будет висеть мертвым грузом в вашей библиотеке. Любителям жанра понравится, но ничего нового они в ней не найдут.

Карточки с игры (коих 3 штуки) были проданы по 4 рубля за штуку, итого навару 10 рублей. И ладно бы если бы игра была плохая, но нет. 

[h1]Немного о жанре.[/h1] 
Это легенький квестик в жанре поиска спрятанных предметов, жанр просто, понятный и доступный всем поколениям. В последние годы набравший лютую популярность, но как и с хоррорами (страшилками) когдато так, и сейчас... Куча говноинди разрабов штампует мусор в этом жанре. И скажу честно, покупая игру за 2 рубля я не думал, что она окажется неплохой! 

[h1]Коротко о сюжете.[/h1] 
Как водится в играх данного жанра, акцент на сюжет нестоль большой! Ведь ключевой составляющей гейплея является поиск предметов, который затягивает игрока, а не сюжетная составляющая. Данная игра не стала исключением и в сюжете полно бреда и антиреализма, однако черный юмор и сарказм делают его более приятным для восприятия. Подкрепляет интерес и достижения которые легко и попутно получаешь. Если вы искали игру по сюжету которой будут снимать одноименный фильм, то вы одназначно ошиблись адресом! Однако за такие деньги с игрой одназначно стоит познакомится. 

[h1]Остальное[/h1]
Про геймплей писать смысла не вижу, т.к. он просто и понятный всем, а вот про графику стоит немного рассказать. Такие игры как правило не блещас какой либо запредельной рисовкой или графикой, ибо им это никчему. Однако в этой игре хочется отметить прорисованных в 3D персонажей, что немогло меня не порадовать. К музыке притензий тоже не имею. Головоломки средней сложности, при желании даже ребенок справится! Отдельная благодарность за локализацию игры на Русский язык с помощью субтитров.

[h1]Итоги[/h1]
Это игра с простым и глупым сюжетом, но переполнена юмором! С кучей простеньких головоломок и поиска предметов. С весьма неплохой для игр данного жанра графикой и музыкой. И все это с ачивками, карточками и по превлекательной цене! Вывод однозначный - [b]НАДО БРАТЬ![/b]

Do not buy at full price.  3/5

This is another grudgingly recommended game, which I would have preferred a neutral rating on.  This is not a horrible game, and I have suffered a share of stinkers on Steam.  It is just a hidden object game, not much more or less than that, and I suspect a lot of the objection here is due to the casual nature of the game.  However even as a genre, within hidden object games, there is something to be desired.  

The concept is seemingly inspired by Dracula and early vampire movies that novel inspired, but with a twist that comes off somewhat amusing but not pulled off as well as, say, a similar theme in Magicka.  Unlike most hidden object games, you actually get to play a character and move around some parts of the game.  The visuals are actually decent for the non-searching parts of the game, and the voice acting is not bad.  It feels like it would have been a well-received, even high quality game in 1998.  I am not saying that the graphics are that ancient, just that I can't help but recall the casual  games of that era.  

The game consists of exploring very small areas for hidden objects, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles.  Through playing, you effectively unlock search quests where you must find a certain number of specified items.  In some areas, there are item lists that must also be found before a quest item is revealed.  Once the quest is completed, a puzzle must be solved.  The puzzles are not complicated in the least.

Some HO games are difficult for various reasons, including devious trickery in design, such as putting similar looking objects, wordplay in clues, shifting images, interactive objects, and so on.  This game uses it's own method of frustrating the player, and it unfortunately is not very satisfying.  The objects are often hidden behind other objects that are not related to the puzzle (like a book or a plate), which must be clicked on to reveal the item underneath.  Makes it hard to search for something that isn't there.  Worst of all, the lighting and visibility of the objects is often terrible, to the point where I found myself clicking the screen randomly...and still succeeding!  Despite screen settings, the images can be so dim that they are practially not there, and I am sure on some monitors, would not show up at all.  And with the secret movable items and the poor display of items, and a lack of consequence for random clicking, it can become as much of a clicking game as Cookie Clicker...but without managers.  

Some seem to say that the objects are hard to find because they are not what people are expecting.  I have played many hidden object games, and as far as the genre goes, this one is actually very good at properly telling you what you are looking for.  

There are two major glitches, however.  If you are using Windows 7 or above, you will need to set the game to XP compatibility mode, or it won't even launch.  Sometimes during the game, you will not be able to interact with environments after a cutscene.  Going to the main menu then resuming will fix this.

All together, it is an acceptable HO game, purely casual and good for destressing or a waste of time.  On the easiest mode, there is no pressure and no consequence for wrong, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.  It was worth the 9 cents, but not the $10 full price by any means.",1440459171,1440459272,True,5,0,0.534219980239868164,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Weird bugs (but nothing game breaking that I encountered). It sometimes throws you out of a hidden object scene when you click on stuff. Exiting and restarting fixes that.

Short, decent hidden object game with a delightfully silly story. Some minor bugs and annoying mechanics are out-weighed by the exceedingly low price and the genuinely fun story and dialogue. If you enjoy the genre and you enjoy a good B-movie story, you should have a reasonably good time for a low price. 

[h1]Review[/h1]
You play as John, a generic American guy looking for his missing bride who apparently got kidnapped by her vampire father. You chase her to the titular Sinister City, the haven of all that is unholy. If that sounds rather silly, don’t worry, that’s the point. Not at any point are you supposed to be taking the game’s story seriously. That, combined with competent voice actors and well-written silly dialogue, provided a good amount of fun for me. Luckily the game does not last long enough (I finished it on advanced mode with all achievements in apparently 2.6 hours according to steam) or use the silliness too ham-fistedly for it to grow stale. I especially liked how they incorporated the silly story with the already silly “go find X items” or “go fix my Z” missions that are the staple of hidden object games. It made it amusing instead of just silly. 

The mechanics of the game were not the best admittedly. The hidden objects and mini-games were decidedly average for the genre coupled with an annoying tendency to have items hidden by other items with no indication that you can interact with the covering item. For example you are in a bookshop looking for item X. Item X is hidden behind a book… you need to click the right book to show it, but your cursor will not change as you hover over it. So basically you need to click all the books in the scene to show it. Sometimes it is more obvious which item is the covering one, but quite frequently you need to click a huge number of random items to find the right one. Which is not great design. However, there are no penalties for misclicks and there is a robust hint-system so when you get used to it, it’s not a huge deal (using the hint-system will costs you an achievement though if you care about that). 

Though old areas remain open as you open new ones, the items you need to find is always in the new areas or the game makes it obvious that you need to return to an old area (like, a character tells you to go back to the castle) so there is no annoying backtracking.

But these concealing objects won't move out of the way if you click on them before you've gotten the collection task for the object they're in front of, which seems to me like cheating, in a way. 

And since there is no apparent penalty for mis-clicks, and no clue that something is moveable in this way, the best strategy is often to just spam the screen with clicks everywhere, in case something comes into view. 

The hit zones for hidden objects are also remarkably large, so you just have to click sorta kinda *near* what you're looking for. Several times, I was able to pick up multiple things by clicking repeatedly in exactly the same place.

Besser kann man die Story nicht beschreiben, welche an sich genommen nichtmal so schlecht ist...

Aber!!! Jetzt kommt das große Aber!!!

Grafik ist eher nebensächlig, es ist die die beste, aber es gibt Spiele wie Tetris die schlechter aussehen ;)

Leider konnten sich die Entwickler nicht entscheiden, was sie eigentlich wollten... ein Third-Person oder First-Person... ersteres ist teilweise extrem schlecht umgesetzt, man fühlt sich teilweise völlig deplaziert oder man rennt in den Texturen rum, welche Wände oder Türen sind... Klickt man auf einen Bereich wird man sofort hinteleportiert, die Laufanimation hätte man sich so schenken können, die gibt es zwar, aber eigentlich nur zur unnötigen Dekoration.

Die Rätsel sind alles nur derselbe Suchkram, wobei es im Gegensatz zu den meisten Wimmelbildspielen in hektischer Klickerei ausartet, da man teilweise nicht weiß was man sucht, bzw. Gegenstände wichtig sind von denen man es bis dato garnicht weiß....
Oft genug verstecken sich die gesuchten Gegenstände hinter Dingen, die man erst beiseite schieben muss, nur weiß man das leider nicht... also probieren! Die ab und an eingestreuten Wimmelbildspiele sind meist sehr einfach und die Gegenstände völlig belanglos. Hinter dem letzten Gegenstand befindet sich immer etwas, was man zum Weiterkommen benötigt.
Sprecher sind ordentlich(Englisch) und die Texte gut übersetzt, der Sound ist nichts besonderes Ohrenkrebs bekommt man aber nicht da er kaum vorhanden ist oder mir nicht im Gedächtnis geblieben.

Was gibt es noch zu sachen... glaube nichts mehr^^

The problem with this game is the lack of the horror element in the game, this is a vampire game after all and therefore the characters should feel scared. It's also easy to beat the game, I beat it the first time in roughly 3 in a half hours, although that was on 'easy' difficulty.

Overall, I did enjoy the game, it was light-hearted, seemed more like a kids game than an adults game, especially with the 'find the items' part added into play. Do I recommend this to everyone, no, I only recommend this to people who want a light-hearted, puzzle related game that is kid friendly.

I get what they're going for, a comical deconstruction of vampire tropes strung together with hidden object sequences, but the jokes tend to fall flat.

Later on, at the big finale (...or what passes for it anyway) every click in a hidden object scene not only clicked something but also exited the scene. It was still possible to progress, but it was frustratingly tedious to automatically exit and then manually re-enter each scene after every single click.

In dem Spiel ""Sinister City"" geht es um eine Liebesgeschichte zwischen zwei verlobten Menschen (?), der Vater der jungen Dame ist ein Vampierlord und entführt seine Tochter damit diese einen lokalen Vampier-Fernsehstar heiratet. Der ""neue"" Verlobte hat allerdings gar keine Lust die Tochter des Lords zu heiraten, da er bereits in einer Beziehung ist. 

BEWERTUNG
Die Geschichte ist eine der typischen ""Ich-muss-meine-Verlobte-retten""-Geschichten und ziemlich oberflächlich. 
Hin und wieder haben ein paar Grafiken gebuggt, sodass der Charakter zum Beispiel mitten in einer Grafik steht, obwohl das nicht möglich sein sollte. 
Die Stimmen, Soundeffekte und Musik waren, trotz herunterstellen in den Optionen, immer zu laut und oft übersteuert. Nach den ersten paar Minuten habe ich meine Kopfhörer dann neben mich gelegt und das war immer noch zu laut.
Die Übersetzungen sind wirklich nicht gut. Das fällt besonders während den Suchbilder auf. So sollte ich zum Beispiel nach ""Zwiebel"" suchen, der Tipp hat mir irgendwann verraten, das die ""Zwiebel"" eine Weihnachtsbaumkugel ist oder eine der ""Palme(n)"" ist eine Hand. Das tritt leider ein paar Mal auf.
Die Suchbilder sind oft viel zu dunkel/haben einen schwarzen Bereich, auf dem nichts zu erkennen ist. Da genau dort aber oft Dinge versteckt sind, hilft dort nur ein Tipp oder wildes, wilkürliches Klicken.
Oft kann man Dinge, die offen herumliegen, erst nach x-maligem Klicken einsammeln, was sehr nervt. 

MEINUNG 
Meine persönliche Meinung zu dem Spiel: 
Die Story ist eigentlich gut gelungen, nur gewisse Logikfehler machen die Atmosphäre sehr kaputt. 
Durch die nervigen Falsch-Übersetzungen ist es teilweise nicht möglich ohne Tipps.
Es hatte Potenzial, das leider nicht ausgeschöpft wurde.

Jednak warto było ukończyć grę ;)

[Stara recenzja:]
Omijać z daleka! Niestety, ogromna ilość błędów w tej grze uniemożliwia rozgrywkę:
- w scenach z HO oraz zadaniami białe prostokąty zajmują cały ekran,
- w scenie z zadaniem do zrealizowania co 30 s. pada pytanie czy na pewno pominąć zadanie,
- dowolne kliknięcie w scenie HO powoduje wyrzucenie gracza do poprzedniej planszy,
- czasami na przedmiot trzeba klikać kilka razy, aby go zebrać.
Kolejną sprawą jest kiepski interfejs:
- brak kursorów symbolizujących możliwość przemieszczania się – w każdej scenie trzeba klikać na ślepo, bo może właśnie w prawym/górnym/lewym/dolnym rogu jest przejście do kolejnej planszy,
- w czasie rozmowy po każdym wypowiedzianym zdaniu trzeba kliknąć.
Już na początku gry okazuje się, że nasz bohater potrafi lewitować - w niektórych scenach unosi się metr nad podłożem. Kiepską grafikę oraz animacje można jeszcze przeżyć, ale w połączeniu z powyższym – nie warto zawracać sobie głowy tą grą.",1431020219,1490823379,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game is a bit rough around the edges. The objects sometimes don't look how you'd expect them to, requiring you to use the hint button. This is far from the H.O,Gs from Big Fish.

The achievements pop up as completed yet aren't. Steam says I've got 15 out of 17, but there are actually five missing. Confusing and irritating, I'd rather they be absent than not work.

The story is cringe worthy. It's just awful. I know it's supposed to be tongue in cheek, but the dialogue is the cheesiest going, and the voice acting really quite rotten. Sometimes the written text doesn't match up with the spoken dialogue, which throws one a bit. 

If you can tolerate the bizarre and insane hotel manager at the start, you'll probably have a good few hours of distraction with this game. But I can't recommend this, simply as it lacks any polish and an interesting story line.

Because this game is bad. Astonishingly, mind-numbingly bad. For starters, it fails as a hidden object game with almost completely empty scenes. Don’t put much hope in the puzzles either, they are about as complex as a slab of stone.
And there is the story. Oh gods, the story. It has an interesting premise, sure: vampires are an everyday part of society, they work like anybody else. But unlike True Blood, this one was written by dumb people for dumber people. The plot is stupid. The characters are even more stupid. And the dialogues… the dialogues make a five-year old child’s screenplay look like Oscar Award material.

But! If you can enjoy terrible movies like Plan 9, The Room, or Birdemic, then you will surely have a hilarious time with Sinister City.",1429893629,1429893629,False,3,2,0.537551522254943848,0,False,False,False,False,,,

2. po chvíli pri hidden object scénach vás po nájdení jednej veci vyhodí zo scény von a vy musíte opakovane vstupovať a vychádzať zo scény aby ste ju mohli dokončiť
3. po úžasnej scéne kde sa dozvedáme, že Ninu niekto uniesol sa mi nedá klikať už nikde, kurzor po kliknutí na hocičo ukazuje X. Vypla som hru a zo zvedavosti ju znova zapla. Problém bol vyriešený...na ako dlho?
4. lietajúci ľudia (bug kedy podlaha zjavne neexistuje)
5. príbeh - upír chce vydať svoju dcéru za upírskeho herca Telletubbies aby sa z nej stala Hollywoodska hviezda - wtf???
6. titulky nesedia s tým, čo postavy hovoria...pár krát som sa musela pozastaviť aj nad názvami vecí v HOS kde namiesto cranberry kľudne použijú cowberry (predtým som tento výraz nepočula a nie je to ojedinelý prípad kedy je označenie neobvyklé)

But that is the only thing good it has to offer.  If you are looking for a dark and scary story, forget about it,  there is nothing scary about this game.  
The story evolves around a silly plot that goes like this: Your girlfriend was hidden from you by his father who turns out to be a vampire lord.  Your future father-in-law is basically against your relationship because you are just a mere mortal.  Because you are more interested in the undead than the living, you still went out and searched for your bloodsucking girlfriend.  
You do this and that. Then followed by you look for this and that.  And a little more of you fetch this and that.  Then towards the end the story takes an odd turn which was absolutely ridiculous.  I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but believe me it was rather silly.
The puzzles are rather easy and the only challenge is when you are trying to locate objects that were microscopic and finding things that blend with their backgrounds, other than that it was smooth sailing for me.
In conclusion, I would NOT recommend this game,  I like the artwork and the graphics but I just could not stand the horrible plot.

** Si no les gustan las aventuras point&click y resolver puzzles medianamente dificiles, este no es su juego **

A diferencia de otros juegos de P&C esta aventura cuenta con un entorno 3D bien logrado a mi parecer, no es lo último en gráficos pero tampoco esta muy atrás. Aunque no lo he terminado, no me parece un juego mal logrado, las voces y la ambientación junto con la música crean una atmosfera bastante amena. Aunque la historia hasta el momento no es nada espectacular, tampoco es del todo aburrida, tiene varias cosas que en vez de dar miedo dan risa.

¿Cómo conseguí el juego, lo compré?
No tengo idea, lo compraria si tuviera un descuento de más del 50%

Me gusta el terror ¿debería comprarlo?
Si para ti terror es que los cromos esten súper caros, entonces si

Me gustan los point&click ¿vale su precio?
No tengo experiencia con otros P&C pero si te lo encuentras de oferta, lo recomiendo

Pros:
-Buen artwork
-Buena música
-Modelos 3D moderadamente buenos
-Dialogos, movimientos faciales y voces detallados

Contras:
-Cromos muy caros
-Bugs visuales (camina sobre paredes y esas cosas)
-Traducción al español decente con palabras desconocidas

Don't give in because of the cheap price, throwing that money down a gutter is a far better investment.

1) Saying the story is ludicrous doesn't even begin to cover it. It's not even funny bad, it is depressingly bad. Worse even...

2) You can't escape the story. No matter how much you try to fast click through things, the game will not allow you to go find some hidden objects or puzzles, it is *intent* on walking you through the ""story"". Then again, that would only be bad if you were eager to do the puzzles and HO segments. Which you aren't. Basically...

3) These are easily the stupidest hidden object scenes I have ever encountered, and I've played through alot of crap in my time. It's a hidden object game. Hide the darn thing! If I have a list of 6 items to find and I'm looking at a suitcase with 7 items in it, WHAT IS THE POINT?

4) And so as not to waste your time anymore, let's sum up everything else that's bad: There are zero redeeming elements to the gameplay and puzzles: when they aren't so boring they put you to sleep, or so easy a 2 year old would breeze through them, they're so unintuitive it's baffling. The voiceacting is so unbearably bad I was forced to mute it. As for the art and animations, cringeworthy is the only word that comes to mind. But hey, they are combined brilliantly with the game's general technical incompetence: There is a whole area where you consistently float around because they forgot to add a floor(!). And that's hardly a unique event, since there's a bottomless pit worth of bugs and glitches to enjoy here.

[list]
    [*]White boxes everywhere in a hidden object scene
    [*]In certain hidden object scenes each click will throw you out of the scene, rinse repeat (unless you restart the game)
    [*]You need to guess where the hidden object scenes even are, how many of a certain item is placed in each one + no indication what is clickable or whether there is an item hidden behind another one or not. In order to complete the scenes, you basicly need to click on everything..
    [*]You often need to restart the game because of bugs e.g. when the game doesn't register any clicks being made in a scene
    [*]Every time someone finishes a sentence you need to click to get to the next sentence
    [*]Generally the story is really poor concerning the dialogue
    [*]The English subtitles are even different from the spoken English
    [*]The graphics are not the greatest thing and sometimes the characters are floating above the ground when they obviously shouldn't.
    [*]The animations in the game are extremely poor. Especially the raven flying away at the castle.
    [*]The puzzles are really dull
    [*]The achievements are not unlocking in right order and there is a broken achievement - but they seemed to have fixed it today (20/11-14), so the game might be further improved.

が、しかし。

なんだろう。この作品にはこのまま捨て置くには惜しい、禍々しい魅力がある。実際、皮肉でも誇張でもなく、今年Steamで一番笑えたゲームがこれだった。初出はiPhone版で四年ほど前のようだが、なぜ全く話題にならなかったのか不思議だ。
まず冒頭のホテルのミッションからして、Ｂ級ハンターならきっと髪の毛がピンと逆立つほどの妖気を覚えるはずである。そして、その期待は最後まで裏切られることがない。セリフ・人物・ストーリー、どれも非の打ち所のないＢ級展開の連続で、二十一世紀の現代においては文化財レベルの駄作に仕上がっている。マニア受けを狙った似非Ｂ級ホラーは数々あれど、この作品はどこかが違う、「真性」の風格を備えているのだ。そして、それらの期待をも軽々と超越する中盤以降のドンデン返し。この先はもうエンディングが気になって、トイレに行く間も惜しんでプレイを続けてしまった。終わった瞬間の後悔の心地よさは、とてもこの場では言い尽くせない。「ジャンク」「ビザール」「トラッシュ」、こうした文句に胸を熱くさせる人ならば、きっと心の殿堂リストに加えたくなるはずである。

こんな駄文にここまで目を通してくれた貴方にもきっと素質はあるはずだ。安いバンドルやセールで見かけたら、ぜひ購入を検討してみてほしい。いや、むしろ定価の300円で買ってしまってもいいかもしれない。その方が以後ライブラリを眺めた時の苦笑が一層味わい深くなるだろう。いずれにせよ、こけおどしのつまらない新作ホラー映画を借りて見るよりは有意義なお金の使い途になると請け合います。",1415864980,1416413023,True,16,6,0.700201213359832764,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Plus there's a bug where sometimes the game won't register ANY area transitions as being clickable, so you're stuck unless you restart the game.

I bought this in a bundle with 6 other games for $1.89 and I still think I paid too much.

EDIT: Went back to finish the game. I think the area transition issue was fixed since I wrote my initial review, but I got some buggy minigames. (At least you can skip those.) The biggest issue for me was still the lack of a context-sensitive mouse cursor.

You will have to find your way through hidden object puzzles, collection puzzles, and many more different types of puzzles if you hope to rescue Nina.

Graphically it feels a bit dated, but then again judging from some of the wording used in the game I'm going to say that this was a port of a tablet game. That being said there's nothing wrong with the look of the game. You will be interacting in a 3d environment broken down into five main areas, and of those areas there are several ""rooms"" you wil get to interact with in order to advance the storyline. The vampire modeling makes the game feel like a cheesy B-movie, but I think that's what the developers were going for, so in other words they nailed it.

The voice acting was interesting. Almost every character sounded like they were just reading lines, and it just didn't feel like there was any energy put into it. The only character that was really believable was the vampire that was supposed to be the TV star. 

You are going to use the mouse for everything in this game, when it comes to controls. Basically you are going to click and drag, or just click your way through this game.

So here's the deal, as cheesy as the storyline was I enjoyed the game, when it worked, and that was the problem with this game. There were several times where after I solved a puzzle and I tried to go on to the next puzzle or thing, I had issues. For example when I am trying to collect items after solving a puzzle, I would go into the next piece of the game where several items are present and after clicking on the screen, anywhere, I automatically exited back out to the area. Then there was the issue of this game only has autosave, which is fine, but I really wish there was a reset button that would reset the scene of a certain piece of the game because during one of the times I had to collect several different items, I was unable to collect the last one, even with the hint indicator highlighting it. I tried restarting the game, steam, and lastly my computer. None of these things work, and so I had to start the game all over again from scratch.

There's also the subtitles, or text that the characters are supposed to be saying, you know when you hear the audio how it is supposed to line up to what is written on the screen? Well its all over the place, sometimes its correct, but most times its hit or miss. The context might be mostly the same but the phrasing and words are completely different. At the end of the day I'm going to have to say that even though this game was enjoyable there were just a couple too many bumps in this game to make it worthwhile for anyone who isn't willing to wrestle with the game doing strange things. So with that I have to give this game a 5.3 out of 10.",1414118197,1414118197,True,5,1,0.442363142967224121,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I am a fan of HOGs (hidden object games) thus it is not the genre that I have a problem with. I believe the devs intended Sinister City to have a B-movie campy feel. In some parts, they succeeded but the storyline ended up feeling jerky - for lack of better term. I can poke a lot of holes at the story but alas, it is not the main problem.

Game issues:

1) In this game, you are simply given items to search, eg. 5 rungs of a ladder, and you have no idea where the HOG scene is. In some games, this is part of the fun. In this game however, the ""fun"" is marred by the fact that those 5 rungs are spread among various hidden HOG scenes. You have no idea how many rungs this particular scene has. 

2) This can actually go hand in hand with pt 1. In usual HOG scenes, there are some items which are doubly hidden. Eg. You are to find a pearl. That pearl could be hidden in a oyster shell. Thus the game will show 'pearl' in your search list in a different color, to let the player know that it is a hidden item. This is the case for ALL the hogs I have played so far and I have played way more HOGs than my fingers and toes could count. Sinister City has NO SUCH THING. Thus you have zero idea if that item you can't find is simply staring at you right in front of your eyes or if it is hidden behind something irrelevant in one of the many HOG scenes.

3) In advanced mode, the game is not supposed to show you your task but on occasions, it shows up and then flickers off. This is likely another bug.

4) The game is pretty much fully voiced. This is supposed to be a good thing but the voice acting in all honesty, is crap. Furthermore, they don't match with the subtitles at all.

5) Despite being a HOG lover, I will be the first to admit that you often do some illogical things in HOGs. However, in this game, it takes the cake. Eg. Your task is to brew a truth potion and get the Count to drink it. What you do actually, is finding all the ingredients and brewing it RIGHT IN FRONT of the Count. After the potion is brewed, you hand it to the Count who actually said something along the lines of, wow, something healthy, give it to me quick. Like...seriously. What.

6) Achievements are bugged. They unlock out of order for almost every achievement. This is not a major issue but as of writing, the achievement for playing in advanced mode doesn't unlock. 
[EDIT: After a whole month later, the devs finally fixed the issue and the advanced achievement is now unlockable.]

I can go on but let's just say this is a do not recommend in my books. Being a HOG, the game can't even handle itself well on the gameplay and you end up randomly clicking items in hopes that one of them hides the item you are looking for. The only saving point is that the devs did not implement any achievement for ""have less than xxx misclicks"" because that is impossible.

Per pt 1 & 2, if you want examples of HOGs that do them well, try any of Artifex Mundi games or MumboJumbo's Midnight Mysteries.",1414110988,1416530943,False,52,0,0.771448671817779541,6,False,False,False,False,,,
