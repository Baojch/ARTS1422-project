When it's not on sale. You can hardly fuck up so hard that it won't be worth those 2 bucks. For me, it was worth about 7 hours of puzzling.

The game consists of 5 ""worlds"" with 25 levels each. Every world introduces new and different gimmicks, from speeding trains to waterfalls to machine guns to self driving lorry carts, elevators, etc. etc. Your goal each time is to blow up the big green safe and optionally the three piggie banks (and if you can and want the hidden object). Unfortunately, this being a mobile port, you need to destroy quite a few of those piggie banks to unlock later worlds, which is funny, because within each world every level is immediately available. To do so you have to generally blow up barrels and connect them with blackpowder lines. This is all pretty fun and stuff, IF NOT for the infuriating design decision to include timed ""drag"" levels. What I mean by that is that there are quite a few levels in the game in which you have to blow up an obstacle, ignite a fuse and ""drag"" it around the screen until the obstacle is gone and you can continue to the next obstacle. If you expect just a slow and peaceful puzzler, let this one go, as things can get quite hectic, especially later on, when you also have to manipulate the machinery and more in the levels. For example: In later levels it is crucial to change the direction of train tracks many different times while there is an on fire mine cart on its way. This can get very stressful.

If you can deal with that, however, you have yourself a nifty little ""action puzzler"" with ok graphics, ok music, incredibly annoying sound effects and the inclusion of a ""story"" for whatever reason. The 10 comic book style panels are just kind of unnecessary and don't even convey any meaningful information.

After you've destroyed enough piggie banks you can also unlock the ""hidden levels"", which is just another chapter of 25 that were supposedly scrapped from the game at some point? Dunno.

TLDR: Meant for touch tablet. Game slides into trial and error and twitch reaction stressful gameplay as difficulty increases. Limited appeal.

This is a somewhat well executed single screen puzzle object routing game with a twist. You have to make trails of gunpowder to connect kegs so that when you start fire everything blows up.

The idea is fun, but the solutions are not open to experimentation or play. There is one correct way of doing things, and that correct way of doing things is increasingly finnicky to execute as the game carries on. For example missions can require you to start the fire first, before allowing you to place extra kegs to connect everything.

The game sets silly time objectives which you have no hope in achieving if you do not know the solutions in advance. The click and drag interface also adds delay compared to simple touch which this was designed for.

Conclusion: Ultimately this is just getting something from point A to point B. It does so with a twist, and if it had a cleaned up gameplay it would be worthwhile. But ultimately the object routes genre really does not live up as a sit down PC entertainment genre, and what few games are worthwhile enough usually bleed over into other genres. For example Frozen Synapse does object routing with a tactical edge.

This game is quite entertaining despite not passing my yes/no recommendation which is largely in part of poor integration of the options menu, lack of sliders for music and sound although positive note being that they are, at the least, separate checkmarkable options.

Almost all of the settings that can be changed require a restart of the game.

Hacked clients / memory scores are allowed to make the leaderboards ( ie some levels where the minimum burn-time of shortest path of powder exceeds the lowest times on the leaderboard which is only possible by cheating / altering memory ). There are a few tricks that can be used to lower the time taken such as drawing a line of gunpowder to the fire and while it burns to the next target, draw another string of powder to the next target, and so on... But, the issue with hacked clients able to alter their time using memory editors and then allowing those falsified scores on a leaderboard is annoying, to say the least. Some of the times, however, are realistic, but only with the help of a macro system, otherwise there'd be little to no way of manually performing the tasks in the time recorded by the leaderboards.

Time starts when you load into the level instead of when you place the first object or the first powder and your view is blocked for the first few seconds by a window that opens giving you information or garbage to read.

Black powder can be buggy in the sense that it will not ignite all of the time; I've laid out multiple strands from a single point and not all of them ignited despite overlapping.",1453541362,1453541362,False,0,0,0.41788753867149353,1,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
[b]Gunpowder[/b] is a casual, two-dimensional puzzle game with a large amount of short levels, a 3-star system, and leaderboards. It is cut from the same cloth as games like [i]Angry Birds[/i], [i]Cut the Rope[/i], and the many other mobile-era puzzle games out there. Nevertheless, [b]Gunpowder[/b] does have its own independent identity. The gameplay is a perfect mix of planning and playing that combines well with the theme of the game to create a unique and charming experience.

It is a very simplistic game, so if you are seeking something with depth or immersion: this isn’t it. But if you enjoy playing casual puzzle games of this style, then [b]Gunpowder[/b] is probably going to be a good bet for you.

As I alluded to, the mixture of planning and action/reaction that is inherent in the puzzle-solving creates some really enjoyable gameplay. It will make you think a bit, but manages to not get overly confusing. That synthesizes brilliantly with the jovial, lighthearted theme of the game to make the whole experience unequivocally pleasurable. It is the perfect game to put a smile on your face in those moments you are just looking to kick-back and relax.

There are a lot of levels (150+), but they are pretty short and easy to solve; although some of the later levels are decently challenging. For all levels, once you find the solution there isn’t much reason to try again for the average gamer, unless you are someone who relishes in the opportunity to compete on the leaderboards. I was satisfied with the amount of content, but you will have to make your own assessment on that front.

So, while I understand not everyone is a fan of this genre, I posit that anyone who is a fan should have an easy time enjoying [b]Gunpowder[/b]. There was a good job done by the developers in creating a unique identity for the game, and it is one of the more entertaining examples of the genre.

L’histoire se déroule le siècle dernier aux Etats-Unis, à l’époque des cow-boys et des indiens.

Vous jouez Incendio, un jeune bibliothécaire qui est révolté par les injustices qui règnent autour de lui. Il décide donc de devenir l’équivalent d’un Robin des Bois. Il va voler les méchants en faisant exploser leurs coffres et redistribuer l’argent aux pauvres.

A travers les 150 niveaux du jeu, vous devez installer des explosifs à côté des coffres mais aussi des tirelires (pour débloquer les niveaux suivants). Déposez les explosifs, la poudre et soyez le plus efficace possible.

""So he can't finance his world take-over plans, of course!"" 

I'm enjoying the puzzles. They start simple to learn the mechanics, then increase in difficulty at a good rate. They aren't so difficult that I pull my hair out, but neither to I always get best time + 3 piggies on the first try. 

My only gripe with Gunpowder: the sound! I like to keep background/environment sound on while playing games but at a minimal level, with sound effects just above that. Gunpowder is an all-or-nothing setup for sound, and I was nearly blown out of my chair when it started up! The default volume was WAY too high! Even the sound effects were blasting. So that I had some game sound, I had to turn my system volume and speakers nearly down to nothing so I could play without wincing. My hope is that there will be an update later on to incorporate volume sliders. 

Overall I'm enjoying Gunpowder, and would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games to pass the time.",1437932460,1437932460,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Perhaps claiming some fame and glory along the way.

Levels start off simple but quickly increased in difficulty requiring you to take down entire walls, chain reactions that split into multiple paths, launch cannons on to moving river rafts and just time more explosions in general. Best scores come from taking out all the extra piggy banks which were often in more obscure locations that require careful planning. Puzzle fans who are perfectionists should find a rather addictive game and with the inclusion of a global high score board it certainly keeps you hitting the replay level button to refine skills. If not bothered can progress the story just by clearing the end safe.

While it's past history as a mobile game is rather obvious, it's far from being a terrible port. Gamepad support isn't provided given the drawing nature of the game but I had no issues with mouse control or menu navigation. Overall enjoyed Gunpowder enough to complete it as I have the spare time. Cheers folks. :)

Optisch lässt das Spiel keinerlei Wünsche offen und ist auch mit Mousesteuerung mittelmäßig gut spielbar. Trotzdem wundere ich  mich etwas über das Spielsystem. Sobald der Level beginnt, startet auch die Zeit und es gilt sofort die möglichst besten Verbindungen zu suchen. Da hätte ich mir eher gewünscht, dass die Zeit erst dann anfängt zu zählen, wenn die Feuerstelle aktiviert wurde und man somit mehr Zeit hat, darüber nachzudenken, wie der Level optimal zu lösen ist. So ist man jetzt dazu gezwungen, erst einmal einfach loszulegen und dann den Lebel so lange zu wiederholen, bis ein gutes Ergebnis erreicht wurde. Da auch noch Fässer per Mouse bei manchen Level in das Spiel eingefügt werden müssen und diese per angehaltener linker Mousetaste in das Spielfeld gezogen werden, kann also die schnellste Zeit nur schon davon abhängig sein, wie schnell ich mit der Mouse arbeite. Dies gefällt mir nicht so gut. Dies liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass das Spiel für Touchpad programmiert wurde und die Mouse dafür einfach nicht ideal geeignet ist. Da wäre die Idee, die Zeit nach der Laufzeit der Lunte zu messen besser geeignet gewesen. Da aber alle Spieler mit dem gleichen Problem zu kämpfen haben, bleibt es natürlich gerecht.Aus diesem Grund  Daumen nach oben, da mir die Spielidee ansich gefällt und die Grafik passend ist.",1436355622,1436362831,True,4,0,0.578651666641235352,0,True,False,False,False,,,
