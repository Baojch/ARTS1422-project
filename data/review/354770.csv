I enjoyed a lot of the mechanics. Probably due to my own inability to look at everything, I missed a few of the controller tips (middle mouse button to ""reload"") but it was otherwise good. I have spent way more money on substantially worse games.

My only few suggestions would be:

Have numbers over the item slots to show the key it is mapped to - had to fiddle around to find that ""5"" was the first column, last row.

Not sure if it's an engine limitation, but I often swapped context on a multimonitor system by clicking near the edge of the screen and out of the game. Upon switching back, the direction keys I had pressed down are still feeding input into the move system.

Like I said, though. Great game, fun story items, and impresive art - all by one guy? Good deal!

I enjoyed playing Trigger Saint but I feel it has some serious flaws. I liked this game enough that I will probably be buying any future games from this developer.

The controls work perfectly, the hitboxes are perfect. I've played too many indie games with sluggish, imprecise controls to not appreciate when somebody gets it right. Unfortunately, there is no key rebinding or controller support. This doesn't bother me, but it could be a problem for others. 

The hand drawn graphics are beautiful, but there is not much to look at. The game takes place on a flat featureless plane with a few kinds of destructible scenery. the primary difference between levels is the color pallet.  

The music is good, but it doesn't always fit what is happening on screen. It also doesn't quite hit the video game goal of being engaging without being distracting. It if frequently distracting. 

The challenge levels of the enemies seemed off. The mobs were too easy to kill and didn't pose any real danger. The mini bosses felt perfect. The level bosses felt way too difficult. None of the enemies have lifebars. This really only matters with the level bosses. Dying half a dozen times to a boss without knowing how close you are getting to destroying it is frustrating. This is especially problematic for the final boss. The final boss can only be damaged in one small area. I lost track of how many times I died before I figured this out.  The 8th level introduces an immobile, indestructible turret that fires faster, and has faster traveling bullets than any other enemy in the game. This changes the entire feeling of the game from an atmospheric exploration game too hectic dodging.   

The biggest problem I had with this game is the limited field of view. The Trigger Saint has very poor vision for somebody whose job is shooting a rifle. The whole game feels a bit claustrophobic. The enemies begin reacting to your presence before they are even on screen. Dodging enemy fire frequently moves the enemy firing at you off screen. It's not a game breaking problem, but it certainly feels weird.

Trigger Saint is a fun, but flawed game. I'm looking forward to future titles from this developer.",1471218641,1482540453,False,6,0,0.593364894390106201,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You shoot, you avoid enemies, their shots and you upgrade yourself (your hp is included here). The game forces you to get good or you won't get very far since taking damage is penalized severely since you either spend your skill points improving or healing yourself.

Plays somewhat like a roguelike in that you only got one live but there are savepoints so it's not too harsh, You may find that replaying some sections to be optimal as you learn the enemies and their patterns so you can conserve as much health as possible otherwise you not only lose out on upgrades but will have to sacrifice enhancements for your hp and that just sets you up for that much of a tougher end game and may force you to restart your game altogether if it gets too bad.

So... genre fans and those that are intrigued by the concept be sure to give the game a go at the regular price or wait for a sale if you are patient or not altogether in any hurry whatsoever to play it.",1452850950,1452850950,True,45,1,0.818845748901367188,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game is currently in early access and since the developer is adding a bunch of content he turned saves off, so I couldn't make it too far into the game as of the time of this review going up.

[b] Positives: [/b]
+Great sort of rich dark art style.
+Very nice models.
+Pretty original proof of concept.
+Nice back story.
+Collectibles and modifications rewarded for exploring the levels.
+Cool enemies and bosses.
+Nice sound effects.
+Interesting mechanics.
+Low price.
+Friendly responsive developer (Some people can argue that this is not really an important thing, but I think it is).
+Good controls.
+Very low price.

[b] Negatives: [/b]
-A few bugs here and there, nothing major though.
-Some sound effects are missing.
-This city feels more like a bunch of levels, I wish the game would more flow through and let you have some freedom to explore this flying city, but it's more of just a bunch of levels you can teleport through.
-No voice acting, and there is a lot of reading to do which some people find annoying to do.
-Levels are very similar to each other, just different colours.

Overall I rate this game a [b] 7/10 [/b]. This is a fun game overall but it is quiet linear and there are some parts missing, the developer is working very hard on this game and I think it's worth buying to see this game develop and to support the developer to manage to do that!

Trigger Saint really is a rare case. Rare enough is it for a game in Early Access to actually get finished, it’s even rarer for that game to get better over time. It’s even rarer still that the game has character and a developer behind it who clearly loves their product. Whilst it can be beaten in less than two hours, it will take much longer than that to learn how to do it in that time. And if you get into it, there’s even leaderboards for highest scores and largest combos. All this and for well under USD $10, you really should give Trigger Saint a good look in, if you’re able to handle having your ass handed to you time and time again!

Question gameplay, Trigger Saint s'approche plus d'un Rogue-Like que d'un simple jeu de tir en 2D :
Voyager de room en room, survivre, et avancer dans le jeu jusqu'a la prochaine room tout en ayant un boss à la fin, boss qui devient vite à s'en arracher les cheveux d'ailleurs.
Un point fort de Trigger Saint : Sa difficulté. En effet, où peut-être parce que je ne possède aucun skill en la matière, Trigger Saint est dur, et les potions sont à utiliser à bon escient, contrairement à ce que je fais.

Things I like about this game:
