you play as 4 roller girls that you swap between on the fly. each with a different weapon (think elements) and enemies will only take damage from 1 or 2 of the girls. you need to touch as many cows as you can before they get abducted or killed. most levels are side scrolling to the right though you can go into the background a bit. there are hidden secrets but i'm not sure what they give. they also have bike levels where your moving forward down a road but you only use 1 girl on these and you can not attack. you can unlock and reply levels you beat but i don't think there is a cow counter or anything to better if you do replay one. 

unless you want a relaxing cheap vr game there isn't much reason to get this. it looks cute but none vr has slowdown for me when ever i use the green girl so ofc most enemies are week to her and she has the worst weapon. i also got stuck on level 10 twice but the 2nd time when i reset the level it took me to the next one (i think the 2nd time i was next to the exit when i got stuck). there are a few ""coming soon"" in the menu. i have a feeling they are not going to be coming at all as this is from 2016. this has some charm but i don't see most people getting into it.",1688015069,1688018993,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This is one of the worst platformers I have ever played in VR. I'm just surprised it has any positive reviews. I was only able to play about 30 minutes before the game hard crashed (had to restart Windows). I took that as a sign that I should quit and uninstall this garbage. I don't even want to do a video review for this mess of a game.

First of all, it ran poorly on my 1060 GTX. Controls (gamepad) felt sluggish to respond (motion controllers are only used at the hub menu to select items). The rollergirls start out very slow from the gate. You feel like you're skating on molasses. The visuals are dated with poor lighting and textures.

The camera views are very poor. There's these parts where you ride vehicles. You're in third person view in VR while riding these vehicles and your AI friends obstruct your view. It's a simple game of Frogger during these portions of the game. Collect cows (save them from aliens) and avoid getting hit. 

The side scrolling is almost as bad. You have  a small field of view. You basically switch in and out of the different roller girls to take down enemies. Freeze it, switch and throw a missile at the alien enemies. There's some powerups that increase your speed and some upgrades that make your weapon stronger. Unfortunately, the game runs poorly, the controls aren't responsive enough, and the environments and level design are dull and uninspired.

This honestly feels like the quality of a 2013-15 free to play mobile game. It's running on the Unity Engine. It looks & plays ugly. Scantily-clad women on roller skates cannot save it.

[b]Rate 3/10. Unfortunately, I bought this back in a 2017 Steam sale for $4 USD and I didn't play it until now. Too late for a refund, but don't make the same mistake I did. Do NOT buy this game. You've been warned![/b]

Firstly, we really enjoy your reviews and the dedication you show to reviewing so many VR games. It doesn't go unnoticed that you have a deep understanding and involvement in the VR community.  Appreciate your views on this game. Yes as you mentioned it probably does seem dated by todays standards since it was released in 2016 in very early days of VR.. (since it took 2 years to create from 2014 onward by one person). I would take that as a given. This was before motion controllers were even on the radar, systems for working with VR were changing daily and all manor of issues actually completing a game. Having said that, not making excuses as we would love to update this game in the future and plan to do so however it is not the main focus currently. All fine with your opinions on everything as that is your prerogative, it's pretty harsh based on 0.5 hours of a 8 hour game, but understandable also since you didn't like it. All good. The only thing not comfortable with is telling others to not buy it at all. Seems like a low blow. As a VR only game company you can imagine we make no money at all and work for free always. So the $4 dollars you mention would have gone to paying a random license fee for unity for something else. So many VR developers are and have dropped out of perusing this awesome creative tech simply because they can't maintain even paying rent. So with that comment you help to contribute to that long list. I tip my hat to your sir. Please contact us at info@stonepunkstudios.com and I will personally refund your $4 and you keep to game. Because we are not in this to make money, just to explore the creative medium of VR. You didn't like this particular exploration and it's great you tell others also, I would not ever want anyone to be unhappy with a purchase."

This game is a good sign that the genre can be put into Virtual Reality to quite decent effect, though. It's the same platforming game, in which you and your sexy rollerblading girl friends defeat aliens and save cows from abduction. I'm surely loving the aesthetic here. Am I using the word 'aesthetic' to much in my reviews? Maybe. Anyway, you play the same game (with a controller or the vive wands) in like a space ship above from the main game action. The game action is part of the VR mode (it is not a 2d screen), but it very much is a glorified cinema mode. It works great though, because the environment you inhabit looks awesome. They also added some first person dance party experiences! Priced exactly correctly, and therefore a total gem for a sale.

The regular game version took some getting use to moving the characters through a deep depth in the platform experience but after I did I was having a blast.....literally. 

This is a sexy fun game.....literally. 

People were talking about problems. I had none playing with a keyboard and mouse. Just use the arrows keys to move through the menus amd the space bar to select. Easy peasy.

You have to use the character abilities together to kill some of the creatures,i.e.,freeze then blast. And change characters to kill certain mobs who are immune to other types of damage. The music is very good and driving as well. It changes with each character. This is a buy in my book and this is not a genre I like. 10/10 for sexy and fun. I liked the bike segment a lot.

The setup, so robotic professor has a charlie's angel like relationship with 4 Roller Girls, and calls them into action to help save the cows from abduction... Huh, so the plot isn't really important, mostly creating sections for weird dialogue cues. 

The game itself is a on wheels sidescroller where the charecters have about a streetlanes worth of space to move in 3D while most of the action is left to right variety.  This is somewhat alleviated by boss fights which employ a much bigger area, like a movie thater for example.  There  are some behind the back  driving  levels to.  

Grahpics wise, the game looks okay, large charecter models feel life size w/ VR. enemies are surreal mix of alien mosnters to hot pink devil cats, and some enemies that look like they are an inflatable pool float.  No perf issues for me at all.

There was some limited Vive contoller use, it appears as some sort of a tool/grasper thing, but the game is geared towards controllers, like and xbox pad, which was fine by me, Its a traditinal side scrowler beat em up (with a glaze of wierd sauce)  I didn't see much motion controllers would offer a game like this.

Once the girls get some upgrades (from saving  cows) and the enemy variety changes in the later levels it's great causing carnage and hot swapping girsl for combo attacks.
