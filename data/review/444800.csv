Si intento comprender este juego tan maldito y surrealista cuenta la historia de un oficinista el cual su vida es consumida por el trabajo y su única meta es ir ascendiendo puestos hasta llegar a la realeza... o... a la muerte? :S
El juego te repite constantemente que eres un simplest office clerk, y no lo dice solo para motivarte a ascender de puesto o pasar el nivel, es una crítica, es un código que te grita sal de esta vida tan banal!!!

El nivel 7 podría estar interpretando a la televisión de los años 90 que era una droga adictiva que te lavaba el cerebro, hoy en día igual pasa pero ¿Quién ve tele en 2022? por eso el nivel es tan difícil, estás horas intentándolo pasar, dejando de hacer todo lo que deberías (tengo 13.8 horas de juego, 13.7 las invertí en el nivel 7)
La velocidad en aumento, los efectos de sonido, una voz relajante, los diferentes tonos de colores suaves, la repetición constante del nivel, la forma en que suena y está compuesta la música, alguien que llegué ahí no puede decir que el juego no te hipnotiza... aunque, todos los niveles son así. Cuando pasas de nivel no hay ninguna pausa, la curva de dificultad está diseñada perfectamente para engancharte y no dejarte apretar la tecla escape, la hipnosis no se detiene.

Simboliza muy bien la vida de la gente y la consecuencia de los gobiernos totalitarios como los de Hitler y Stalin, consecuencias de la invasión a Polonia supongo (procedencia del estudio desarrollador)
Leí por ahí que está muy inspirado en la novela 1984 de George Orwell, no me gustan los libros pero por juegos como estos vale la pena echar un vistazo para entender el lore.

NO THING is a reaction runner in the vein of BIT.TRIP, Linea, The Impossible Game, Super Hexagon etc. It's a genre that I tend to enjoy, and I don't shy away from a good challenge. The inherent issue with the genre is that one minor error can reset your progress to zero. This issue can be circumvented is a couple of ways:
[olist]
[*]With the addition of checkpoints, like in BIT.TRIP Runner 2, where the amount of progress lost is minimized past a certain point, and players aren't forced to play the same beginning section over and over.

[*]With gameplay that immediately gets you back into the action, like in Super Hexagon, where the push of a button will throw you back into the game at full pace, making you quickly forget the progress you may have lost moments before.
[/olist]
NO THING does neither of these. There are no checkpoints on a level, and if you die, you start again at a much slower pace, having to tediously build up to full speed again. Then you inevitably die somewhere, and you're back to moving at a crawl again. Tedium and monotony are thematically appropriate to the game's core set of ideas, so I wouldn't even be surprised if these decisions were intentional. The problem is that these mechanics just make the game frustrating to play.

Speaking of themes, NO THING is trying something, for sure, but it comes off as pretentious and shallow. It feels like the writers listened to the anti-conformist, robotic drawl featured in [i]'Fitter Happier'[/i] off of Radiohead's classic album 'OK Computer' and loosely adapted the contents into a game. The thing is, [i]'Fitter Happier'[/i] makes more of a statement in two minutes than this game makes in 2 hours. And to follow up on that, the music in this game is sometimes listenable, other times irritating and grating. Once again, this could be a clever, cynical statement on society, but it's not made explicit, and doesn't make for a particularly enjoyable playthrough.

To break up the negativity, the game looks pretty unique, and the concept itself is novel. The controls are as simple as pressing left and right to turn your character at 90 degree angles. I haven't often seen such a basic idea utilized effectively. The game is mostly functional too, but there are a couple of irritating things. If you walk up an angled surface at speed (a factor which is largely out of your control), you'll gain a tremendous amount of height, and end up with so much air-time that it becomes utterly disorientating. There's always the looming threat of mistiming a button press on your blind landing, which could spell the end of your run. Sometimes your character pulls ever so slightly to one side after having turned, leading you to watch helplessly as you edge over the side of the map. If the game more immediately dropped you dropped you back into the action, then maybe deaths to these kinds of things wouldn't be so frustrating.

Otherwise, on account of a number of design choices, NO THING was just not that fun to play, and it's an experience I'm glad to have put behind me. If you want to play a reaction runner that's considerably more fun, try[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/302610/Boson_X/] Boson X[/url]. If you're less interested in the gameplay, and more the artstyle, then try[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/402060/Californium/] Californium [/url]for an equally trippy game with more interesting mechanics.

I could spend an hour talking about how ingenious the game and especially level designs are. But to make it simple it's full of very clever elements that aren't super obvious at first glance (visual elements  some random, some planned, but also lenght and junctions including the distance of those between ""roads"", inclinations and rotations etc) which will play with your perception of the space around you and the feel of your character in this environment. You really feel like you're walking there, there is a weight to your character and that is so enjoyable and relevant in the gameplay.

Which makes the levels harder in themselves but also never feeling repetitive as they all play on certains elements of the designs more than others and completely change your rythm. 

Iit is not a rage quit inducing game. You will have frustration but your own control on the character makes it a lot more entertaining and you have a clear sense of progression with the % when you die and the mapping of the levels. 

The story is super interesting even if cryptic as you try to put the pieces given to you by the disembodied voice accompanying you... Added to the music it gives off a very unique ambiance that will keep you there.

I absolutely despised NO THING after my first couple of attempts. It was frustratingly demanding, the graphics didn't seem to add anything to the exasperating mechanics, and the soundtrack seemed to be just a frustrating set of blips and bleeps. But then I beat the first level, and the game suddenly clicked for me. I still felt frustrated and annoyed, but suddenly the game's story had me hooked. 

NO THING, for those who are unaware (and fair enough, the game doesn't really explain itself) is a 1993 dystopic retro-futuristic ""semi-infinite"" runner game. It knows how runner games work, and it deconstructs the genre through the lens of something that feels like it should be distinctly unfun. It is punishing. You have to follow a track along, growing faster and faster as the level goes on as you try to fill your percentage to 100%. But every time I died, I felt a strange compulsion to keep going. I was going to prove myself against this game. 

So it's definitely not for everyone. It's very, very weird and surreal, and the gameplay is super frustrating. Even in spite of how addicting the actual gameplay is (because damn does it feel rewarding to beat a level), I can't help but wish that there was a ""story mode"" to play through the game for the story, with a less punishing speed for the protagonist.

It's a game that can be described as hypnotic, trippy and entrancing. I completed the first level in only a few attempts but the second level was much more challenging. Somehow I couldn't accept leaving the level unfinished. The second level evoked some strange feelings in me, especially due to how much it reminded me of Radiohead's ""Fitter Happier"". 

The music and writing in NO THING is really good. I like the visuals quite a bit as well. My only complaint, really, is the difficulty. I have a hard time seeing myself beating this game as much as I would really like to. I think NO THING is worth picking up on sale, especially since it's gone for as low as 60c on Steam. Not everyone will like it and even less will feel like beating it, but it's a different enough game to get a recommendation from me.

Но медлить нельзя, надобно ускоряться. Потому знатно потренируемся, поплюёмся и поругаемся. Так-то ничего сложного: знай себе, поворачивай влево да вправо и подбирай розовые кубы. Хотя, и без голубых иногда не обойтись. Ради чего? Так королева послание ждёт в конце концов. Шуруй, клерк, не задерживайся!

В своё время я играл её на смартфоне, но так и не прошёл, потому что были десятки провалов на седьмом уровне, которые прервались с жизнью аппарата.=] Тогда мне казалось, что не прошёл бы её в любом случае, не хватит терпения. А в этом году узнал, что геймерам дали возможность погонять клерка и на пеке, и понял, что путь непройденный ещё сидит занозой в подкорке. Как и ожидалось, на упомянутом уровне попотеть пришлось и с компа, но уже в разы меньше. В итоге прикончил эту беготню до финального ""кольца"" и радостно удалил к такой-то матери. А я не любитель раннеров, скажу вам...
Атмосферная, короче. Хоть и минимализм, а всё в тему: и музыка, и визуал, и нотации. Цветовые и прочие зримые эффекты пусть и мешали процессу, порой были вполне приятны. Минусом очевидным могу назвать отсутствие регулировки громкости. В затяжных уровнях приходилось оба звука отключать. Некоторые факторы, как разрывы меж плит в последнем уровне, например, были не столь сложностью, сколько техническим затягиванием прохождения. Особенно учитывая то, что с паузы нельзя уже ни в меню, ни обратно в процесс вернуться - почему-то игра ни на какие кнопки не реагировала, только Esc (а на мобильной версии такой проблемы не было). Поэтому приходилось тупо проваливаться, если хотел начать уровень заново. Правда, и срезать местами ничто не мешало. ^_^

It stood out to me because when he plays random Steam games they are usually horrible. This one however had an interesting aesthetic and simple yet compelling looking gameplay.

The game itself couldn't be more intuitive to control, you simply tap the left and right arrow keys to turn when you come to a corner. After the first level however, it becomes apparant that the deceptively simple control scheme is disguising a game that is hard as nails. At times it gets so fast that you need to respond with split second precision, and sometimes the speed is enough that you are pulling off difficult maneuvours in mid-air. It takes the concept of those endless runner games except with the difficulty ratcheted way up and with a finite number of unique levels. A bar at the bottom of the screen shows what percentage of the way you are through the current level, and it can get very intense when you know you're just a few turns away from victory.

As for the artwork, the trailer does a very good job of giving you a taste of what you're in for. Aesthetically it looks like you've been transplanted into a discoloured David Bowie video, and there are various visual effects (colour changes, distortion) that will happen during gameplay designed to distract you. This is quite masterfully paired with a robotic voice that will periodically drop (sometimes cryptic) hints about the game's world and your character's place in it. The story can sometimes be difficult to pay attention to due to the fact that you are concentrating solely on the next turn, but all I can say is that although it isn't the most inspired tale in gaming, it has a dystopian theme that very much fits in with the way the game is presented. 

All in all I can heartily recommend this game if you want a compelling game to pick up and play every once in a while. Really the only criticism I have of it is that the difficulty in level seven is absolutely absurd, and should probably have been toned down slightly since the subsequent and preceding levels don't even come close to the insane reaction times it demands of you. Despite this one qualm though, I'd say it's well worth your time, especially considering it will easily kill a fair few hours and is sold at a low price even when it's not on sale. It's also available on iOS and Android if you'd prefer to play it on your phone.

Something about the art and the audio of this game just caught me completely (and [i]really[/i] stood out where I first picked it up on the Switch.) I can't really explain it. I had the same feeling with Thumper. Ordinarily games in genres I don't much care for, but sometimes you just see a game that looks and sounds like something right up your street and NO THING is right up my street.

NO THING has only 10 levels. The only controls are a turn-left command and a turn-right command. And it's probably some of the most fun I've had playing a game all year. With each turn you make, the game gradually quickens, making the task of getting to the end of the level harder. I've yet to reach beyond level 5, yet to say all I am doing is turning left and right, there has been a good amount of variation. Some levels are circuits, some are point A to point B and there's at least one level with a surpising amount of verticality.

The music is different on each level, but cleaves to the same aesthethic. I can't say I've decoded much of the spoken-story but I cannot begin to imagine this game without that voice ringing out periodically. What I enjoy most of all however is the 'just-one-more-go' quality. Deaths can come quickly, but in a second you can get back into the game and try again. It's challenging, but not punishing. Great in snatched, small doses. And every time you fail you catch yourself thinking 'Again! This time I'll do better!'

1，预告片为实际游戏体验，如果对预告片的光影效果感到不适的人请远离此游戏！
2，对于手残和反应慢的玩家来来说这款游戏极不友好！很有可能你连第一关都过不了！

一款魔性的游戏，操作简单（只需要左右2个键）但是难度高得出奇，我在死了186次后终于通关了，相比于其他人花了5-10个小时通关的人来说，3小时已经是非常快的了。最后2个成就太反人类了，直接放弃。

整个游戏剧情比较无厘头，玩家扮演的是一个普普通通的办公室职员，某天被授予了为冰雪皇后传递消息的任务，需要开车闯过10个关卡到达皇后的城堡，途中会有个机械的声音在给你普及游戏的世界观。

游戏过程就是玩家通过左右进行转弯确保自己不要掉落到悬崖下面去，但是整个画面会不时地改变颜色，调整背景模型甚至出现各种幻觉特效来分散玩家的注意力，同时玩家的速度会逐步提升，稍微一不注意就会车毁人亡然后重新开始这一关。每一关的进度不短，所以请做好无数次死亡的准备，记住这个游戏没有存档点，除了每过一关后会自动存盘以外，你死了即便进程是99%都得重来！

掌握以下窍门会稍微帮助你：
1，玩家车辆行驶的速度并不是随时间而提高，而是你每转一次弯就会略微提升一点点（初始速度是1.5，达到3之前每转一次弯会增加0.05左右，速度过3以后每转一次会增加0.01）。转弯会有一定的延迟。速度3以后的转弯必须要提前不然车很容易冲出道路。
2，前八关出现的红色方块吃了以后会略微减少行车的速度。一些绕圈圈的重复关卡需要好好计算吃方块的时间。第八关以后会出现加速方块，除了第九关需要用到那玩意飞过桥其他任何时候都尽量避免。
3，一部分关卡是单一道路，直接沿着路线走达到目的地就行了，另外一部分关卡设计了绕圈子，需要在一个赛道里面多转几次找到出路才能过关。比较特殊的关卡是第四关，利用好飞车技巧可以少绕一些弯道。
4，第七关是劝退关，是第一关的加强版，将原道路变得更窄，减速的方块会更少，而且要绕4圈才能算过关，请做好无数次翻车的心理准备。
5，最后一关目的地城堡入口需要在最高一层绕1到2圈达到99%才会出现。",1541177950,1541177950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Be warned:  this is not for the casual gamer.  It just isn't.  If you do not want to reach the level of frustration that will make you repeatedly smash your keyboard and punch a hole through your monitor, do not, seriously, not even joking, do not play this.  This is the kind of game that makes you sweat, hold your breath and clench your butthole as it destroys your humanity.

Now that that's out of the way.... you play the role of an anonymous office clerk in a first person runner.  You have two buttons:  left and right.  You do nothing but turn left and right.  As simple as this should be, you will be getting stuck between walls, flying off the level and falling off edges.  There are a ten levels.  First five or so are okay.  It teaches you way the game plays.  After that, you're fucked.  Level 7 is especially notorious.  My progress was at a halt for many months because I never got past it.  Same goes for level ten.

The story isn't really explained, but there is this robotic voice that talks to you and tells you that you must deliver a message to the queen of ice and there is a totalitarian regime in charge.  Beyond that, I have nothing to say.  The visuals are vaporwave - inspired which is honestly my favorite thing about the game, being a huge fan of the genre.  The music somewhat fits, but it's the same melody just played in many different ways much like Super Mario World.

You'll know you'll like it from watching a video.  Totally self explanatory.  But be warned, this is really and truely a frustrating game.  You will go so fast that the tiniest bump - put there intentionally - will send you flying.  You won't know when to turn because the path you are supposed to be on will leave your field of view.  You'll have to make your best guess or die and learn the exact timing.  Another very frustrating part, perhaps the game's greatest sin, is that when you walk on the edge of the path, you will gradually, slowly, fall off even though you are not turning either way and the pathway is perfectly straight.  I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it occurs a LOT during the game.  This basically means that every pathway has a narrower area that you can walk on than what appears.  If you get lucky you will be able to make your turn when you need to before you completely fall off but that is a rare case.

The screen changes colors every few seconds.  It goes from blue to pink to green to red, sometimes it glitches out and that can mess up your concentration or distort the visuals just enough that you don't know when you're supposed to turn.  Like I said above, this is not for the casual gamer.  It's an acheivement to complete this game.  And the moment you do, you immediately see that it's made by... Evil Indie Games.

A no-death run would yield a time far lower than 1h50m, that was just how long it took me to start-to-finish - including deaths - with no sort of external aid.  There is also a mobile version of this game available with pricing equivalent to the Steam version.  The Switch version is the least expensive for some reason, at least at time of this writing.  For some reason the game has a bullet on the store page saying ""migraine inducing"", I didn't even get a mild motion sickness sensation when playing this so I don't know what that's about.

""No Thing"" is a first-person autorunner, which means you are permanently moving forward.   There is no mouse support for fine tuning, the only control you have is to make ninety-degree lefts or ninety-degree rights.  

Dying in this game is simple - you fall to your death.  You have a velocity that is determined by how many turns you have made, and what cubes you have picked up.  Orange cubes decrease your speed, blue cubes increase your speed.  Cubes add to your score, as does each turn you make.  When you die, your score is reset.

You can sometimes get stuck between two platforms, either from moving too fast or moving too slow.  You will eventually learn how to avoid these issues, but the first couple times it occurs, it's easy to misunderstand and think the game glitched and lodged you between one long platform, when in reality you just got jammed up or fell between two.

The game is narrated by a robotic voice, and the entirety of the game gives me a vibe heavily reminiscent of ""OK Computer"" by ""Radiohead"".  The story is open to interpretation, but the broad stroke of it is an exploration on the bleak nature of routine, feeling unappreciated, and wishing someone would notice you.  At times the game is moving too fast to really focus on what the narrator is saying, and though there are subtitles, glancing to read when moving at those high speeds will result in death more often than not.  If you really want to consider every piece of dialogue this game conveys, you're going to need to play through it a few times or watch somebody else play from start-to-finish.  If there's a particular section you wish to replay, there is a level select option.

The graphics are extremely simple, but blends well with the tone of the music and voiceover.  On first playthrough, there are times where the difficulty spikes will create a dissonance with the calm but lightly sinister existential tone of the game.  While it can be argued as perhaps being intentional as part of the game's message - routine, unappreciated, going unnoticed, and at times feeling hopelessly frustrated with the tasks presented to you - it feels jarring when it occurs and from a game development standpoint, just feels like a lack of attention given to balance and pacing.  The game is at its best when you're feeling light-to-moderate adrenaline from the speed and quick input demands, but loses its touch when it puts your feet to the fire with unnecessarily narrow platforms to accurately turn onto (level 7 being the biggest offender).  Again, these oversights may actually be intentional ""oversights"" to give controlled injections of bad trips into what quickly ends up feeling like a familiar, routine experience.

There is a bug that occurs sometimes, where you are running on a platform but your character moves at a very slight angle instead of a straight line.  This will usually result in an unavoidable death.  It's also possible to fall into the side of a platform so that instead of falling to your death after hitting its side, you instead get kind of hitched in it.  Sometimes this glitch provides you with the opportunity to save yourself if the platform is located above another one, you can adjust and turn to drop onto a lower one and continue with the game, but more often than not it's just a bug that slows down an inevitable death.

I played at 1080p and oddly enough there were times where the game would stutter a bit, but it couldn't be replicated.  It would just occur for no reason, and if I tried it in that section again, it wouldn't occur again.

Robot Unicorn Attack 2 solves this problem by letting you change the speed and acceleration that you run at, but these are both still free games on the app store. Now let's take a look at No Thing.

In Subway Surfers and RUA2, there are missions and upgrades, as well as in-game currency to give a sense of character progression. This does not exist in No Thing. I get that when you're going for this whole cyberpunk aesthetic, showing a character model breaks the fourth wall, as would upgrades and missions, but the game just isn't fun. To pass each level, it really isn't clear what you need to do, just play either until you die or until, magically, here's the next level. The music will get stuck in you head, and it's just a one-minute loop, so it becomes really jarring after a while.

As soon as you die, the weird robotic narrator talking to you in incomprehensible verses start over again. The same lines end up said over and over, and the gameplay isn't even interesting. It's just turning, that's it. Nothing else. You turn, and there's a bleep. There are floating cubes that don't do anything but change the color of the screen, and oh, have I mentioned the visuals?

Sometimes the screen get filled with ""artsy"" glitch-looking things that are like looking through a gummed-up contact lens. And everything is one color. It changes, but not much, and the colors aren't truly bright or varied enough to be interesting.

Let's remember, this is a paid game on Steam, not a free iOS game. And it's worse than a lot of free endless runners, even though it's basically a paid endless runner. There's no sense of progression, I'm on the third stage and I still don't even know who I am, who the narrator with the incredibly boring and repetitive voice is, or who the god damn Queen of Ice is. The visuals are a tiny bit interesting, but also jarring, the gameplay is completely uninteresting, literally just turning with a bleep sound effect, the plot is incoherent cyberpunk dystopian garbage, and the music is incredibly repetitive. This game is horrible.

P.S. I forgot to mention that very occasionally there are jumps. They are impossible to judge and control.

P.P.S. I know that someone must have worked very, very hard on getting the visuals, voiceover/plot and art just right, and maybe I'm just a simpleton who doesn't understand great art. But I do understand game design, and there's no effort put toward making actually satisfying gameplay in that regard.

Çünkü;
Baktığınızda basit bir yürüme / koşma simülatörü gibi görünüyor, değil mi? Değil. Şöyle minik bir hikaye var: Biz basit bir katibiz (clerk'in Türkçesi ne tam olarak?) ve Queen of Ice'a bir mesaj iletmemiz gerekiyor. Bunu yapmak için de, oyunun belirlediği yollardan giderek level atlamaya çalışıyorsunuz. 


Fakat bu 'gidiş' gerçekten hiç kolay değil; çünkü sizden bunu gerçekleştirmenizi isteyen oyun, siz bunu gerçekleştiremeyin diye ne mümkünse yapıyor. (Şöyle bir istatistik vereyim, 1. bölümü bitirince elde edilen başarımı kazananların oranı %25.6 Yani %75'i hiç kasmayıp bırakmış direkt). Birden ekranın rengini değiştiriyor, birden yolu önünüzü görmekte zorlanacağınız kadar piksel piksel yapıyor, birden sizi önünüzü göremeyeceğiniz yüksekliklere fırlatıyor (ve yolun nereye kıvrıldığını hatırlayıp ona göre dönmenizi istiyor, yoksa ölüyorsunuz). Her şey sabrınızı ve sebatkarlığınızı sınıyor sanki. Arka planda da sürekli dikkatinizi dağıtan cümleler duyuyorsunuz. 


Tanıdık geliyor mu? Bu, hayatın kendisi. Birilerinin sizin için belirlediği yollarda, sizin için konulan kurallara uyma zorunluluğu içinde yürürsünüz (zamanla bu kuralların anlamsızlığını ve bu belirlenen yol yerine sizin kafanızdaki yoldan gitseniz çok kısa sürede hedefinize varabileceğinizi fark edersiniz). + Bu esnada daima sizin ne kadar ufak, yapmanız gereken şeyin ise ne kadar yüce olduğuna dair şeyler duyarsınız. (Belki hayat bir oyun olsaydı %75'imiz de öyle ""Bu ne biçim iş amk?"" deyip intihar ederdi? Bilmiyorum.)


Bunu fark etmek insanı şöyle bir ikileme sokuyor: Ben inat edip bitirmeye kasarsam, bunun benden zaten istediği şeyi yapmış olacağım. Bitirmesem; hiçbir şey değişmeyecek çünkü benim görmezden gelmem / umursamamam o çarpık şeyi düzeltmiyor. O çarpıklık kendi kendine var olmaya devam ediyor.


'Sen ne yapıyorsun?' derseniz; 2. bölümdeyim henüz. Azmettim, devamını merak ettiğim için uğraşıyorum. Ama belki de sadece son bölümü bitirmeyip oyunun benden istediği şeyi yapmayarak şeklimi yaparım, kim bilir...

The first time I saw the trailer, I couldn't even see what made it a game!

The game is an endless runner, where you do nothing but turn left and right, trying not to fall into whatever abyss lies off the platform. The tagline- ""The year is 1994 and it is the future.""- sets up the unconventional setting, which is made even more quirky by the disembodied narration and surreal imagery.

The music is brilliant, and helps motivate the player to go on in spite of extremely tough levels. Level 7 ([spoiler] Damn dinner-eating neighbours...[/spoiler]) and level 10 are the toughest, which both took me 300+ attempts to complete. Anybody who completes this game deserves enormous credit!

The game is far from perfect, though. A game that requires such precise actions deserves precise gameplay. Sadly, there were many times when I pressed left/right, only for the ""simple office clerk"" to keep going in a straight line. As this ""phantom input"" happened multiple times in the very same point in a level, I call this a bug rather than player error. Getting stuck in between two platforms, with no choice other than to kill the clerk, is another frequent issue in the last levels.

Some other bad choices by the designers:

[list]
    [*]To compensate for the low-tech graphics, the colour on-screen frequently changes. This can unnecessarily spike the difficulty; in Level 7, when you have little margin for error in turning, a flash of red/yellow can cloud your vision, and next thing you know, you're dead.
    [*]The purpose of the red orbs scattered across the levels is not explained, until [spoiler] it's made crystal clear in levels 8&9.[/spoiler] The player's priority is to get through each level as fast as possible, so there is no incentive to go after any collectibles unless the risk/reward for doing so is made obvious.
    [*]Narration contradiction. I personally liked the narration, even with its cryptic hints upon cryptic hints about the nature of the world. What I [i]didn't[/i] like was when it seemingly contradicts itself in seconds: [spoiler]He mentions ""Our totalitartian regime"" and ""Democracy"" in quick succession. While that line may have been ironic, when he mentions your wife, then your husband straight after, it all seems annoyingly obtuse.[/spoiler]
[/list]

Still, despite these issues, I do recommend NO THING. Its surreal setting, bizarre narrator and terrific music all makes it a unique game, and if you fancy a challenge to boot, this game will be rewarding for you.

That is to say, objectively speaking, it should be an irrefutable downvote. Please read it on the premise that this is a NEUTRAL review more from a critical perspective. The reason of writing this relatively long review is that many problems that are commonly seen in indie titles can be identified in this game, which makes it a perfect case study subject.][/h3]

I have never expected a runner game to be this emotionally evoking. 

A narrator with synthetic voice apathetically repeats ironically poetic phrases, with retrofuturistic symbols of the 80s overwhelm the screen. Accompanied by 80s cheesy yet catchy synth-pop tracks while playing the role of a “simplest office clerk” in a totalitarian setting. Indeed, this game is literally a visualization of Radiohead’s Fitter Happier. Since Fitter Happier is one of my all-time favorites, I fall in love easily with this game.

However - there is always this however - my honeymoon with it ends in less than one hour, ever since the moment all the fascinating voice-over, visual and soundtracks faded away in my senses, leaving nothing but the never-ending path in my tunnel vision; the moment a somehow expressive and sentimental experience took a sudden turn into a tediously hard quicktime reaction and muscle memory grind, where the difficulty does not come from well-designed challenges, but from irresponsibly clumsy mechanics.

I will explain the reason of choosing the rather uncommon word “irresponsibly” (in terms of video game review) in following sections. But first to clarify, I beat the game in 4 hours, which is far below the average completion time according to online statistics, to say the least, it proves that difficulty is not the major reason that prevented me from enjoying the game.

People tend to use the term “with rough edges” when reviewing indie titles. Like I mentioned in my other reviews, I do also prefer flawed but unique games rather than perfectly polished indistinguishable titles, for flaw and weakness is what really defines one’s personality. However, the roughness of NO THING has way exceeded my tolerance threshold for rough edges, it’s more like a sea urchin whose only smooth spot is hidden deeply underneath. 

The level design starts reasonable, but gets increasingly random and messy as you progress. First we got this level 7, where you need to run through an extra-long sequence of extra-narrow platforms which are only half the width of normal ones with lighting speed (speed increases every time you take a turn), for 5 laps! More than half of my playtime was spent on this single level. After this cursed level is conquered, we got two of the easiest levels as level 8 and level 9, and the chaos eventually reaches its climax at level 10. It’s as if the developers finally ran out of all patience, and decided to just drop a bunch of platforms randomly into the space, then only made a little effort to get them connected somehow and call it a level. At the second half of level 10, none of the platforms are properly positioned and aligned (in any of the three axis!), which leads to unforeseeable gap or altitude offset everywhere. Since you don’t have the liberty to jump in this game, it means you’ll easily get stuck or launched sky-high at any time. BUT WHY???

It results from another disastrous design choice. The developers used Unity’s default physics engine based first person controller in full-scale without any optimization to handle such simple movement mechanism of this game. Player-wise, it means the “simplest office clerk” you control is actually a “capsule shaped rigidbody” which indeed has feet of a hemisphere as the name suggests, thus, thanks to the physics engine, any protrusion on the ground will easily launch you sky-high. Since there are barely any platforms that are seamlessly aligned like aforementioned, you’ll get high all the time, so dope. Now move on to the most ridiculous one, if you fall into one of the larger gaps between platforms, guess what will happen? Falling down? No! you’ll stuck there once the vertical part of your capsule body touches any vertical side of the platform, because of the existence of friction in the physics engine which the developers forgot (or never realized) to disable.

The point of listing all those defects in details, is to shed a light on the fact that none of these problems is that technically difficult for a responsible developer to fix. Therefore, all the confusion and misery caused thereby is per se a result of irresponsibility rather than inability. That, is an unforgivable sin of indie developer. 


Now, let's step back and take a look at the bigger picture, NO THING is just another victim of the haunting dilemma that got tons other indie games as well: [h3]unconfident developer got confused by their own creation in the development process and thereby forgot their original intention. [/h3] The symptoms including but not limited to:
[list]
[*][b]Ignorant/Unconfident about the strongest forte of the game (which is the unique aesthetic, in NO THING’s case), so instead of pushing this particular forte to its maximum, they distributed their resource evenly to all aspects. Due to the nature of limited resource as indie developer, most of the time, it ended up evenly mediocre. [/b] 

[*][b]Keep adding new features they don’t really comprehend of as a last resort to boost gameplay, but none of the newly added features has been properly deepened, as a result, turned the game into a bloated Frankenstein. [/b]
[/list]
[i]Such as the speed boosting/decreasing pickup in NO THING, which has been dropped at its most primeval state that is no better than nonexistent due to its extremely limited effect. Only in two scenarios of the entire game I can notice its existence that is level 7 and 9. If ever they could recalculate the extent of its effect and introduce more alternative paths to the level layout, a layer of resource management could be easily added atop the uninspiring routine of its gameplay, a game altering difference could be made thereby.[/i]
[list]
[*][b]Compromising in every way in attempt to satisfy all groups of player. They’re either too afraid of being criticized by conventional gamers as lacking of engagement and “gameplay” (quote gesture here), thus turned to raise artificial difficulty through brutally messing with parameters and death penalty and stuff. Or going totally opposite, afraid of being too hard or “gamey” for the art lovers, hence essentially making the whole game into a never-ending tutorial or preschool education program. [/b]
[/list]
[i]As of NO THING, the inhumanly artificial difficulty is presumably a result of some unilateral playtesting sessions. Nevertheless, it can still be simply corrected by reducing the increment of speed per turn and shorting the length of some levels, but they never give it a second try. Moreover, for whatever reason, the developer didn’t even round up the value of speed to a certain decimal place, leaving the number bouncing left and right on the interface constantly, showing stuff like 2.599999 or just 1.85 … sigh[/i]


The list can still go on a few more, but the rest is not within the scope of this review, so I’ll just stop it here to conclude this review by answering the question you might be having the whole time: Why give it an upvote since all I do is keep talking about its negatives? The answer lies in the one-of-a-kind memorable experience NO THING provides, especially if you’re into cult classic sort of works, you might even find it enjoyable, but for how long? That’s totally depends on your patience and tolerance level. NO THING is irrefutably a bad game in all standards, however, the irreplaceable temperament it has, in my book, means much more than most good yet replaceable titles out there these days.",1479805339,1577178438,True,11,0,0.59861069917678833,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Did somebody already mention that this game ist hard? Yes, this person was right.

If you can deal with that, I can tell you NO THING is a very good small game for a reasonable price.

All you do is push the left and right buttons to turn, and stay on the road. Sounds easier than it actually is. 

Its levels that are just a bit too long, so I really hate it when I lose near the end of a level, because that means I have to do the exact same thing yet again and hopefully not screw up and the end. 

Also, the runner doesn't run in exact straight lines parallel to the roads you run on, so if you land too near to the edge of a long stretch, your runner may fall off near the end. You can't really correct your errors - your runner can only turn every so often so for example, you can't turn then turn back again fast enough to move ""slightly to the left"" to correct your errors.

The game is irritating like that.

Thankfully, as you run, some charming electronic music plays and an electronic voice speaks, and it gives you something to ponder about the world of the game, whoever the voice is, and whoever your character is.

...actually, I switched the music off after a while, because it get a bit irritating after the first few hundred times because it becomes repetitive and was too chilled out and I wasn't.

[h1]评测正文[/h1]    
这里是1994年，你是一位办公室小职员，你第一次来到这座城市。伴随着机器声的旁白，你开始了你第一天的[strike]健身[/strike]工作。
    初看到这款游戏的画风，很难把它和跑酷游戏联系起来。钉死的视角，简单图形组成的地板，这些看起来和各种快速反应，高难度翻转、跳跃的跑酷游戏一点关系都没有的元素恰恰使这款游戏更为迷幻。
    伴随着迷幻风的电子乐，你所控制的人物颠簸着往前跑去，均匀的步伐，只能前进不能后退，永远平行于水平面的视角，除了碰到障碍物否则不会跳，没有感情的旁白诗篇，大量复制的纸片一样的城市的浮光掠影，使你仿佛置身在虚幻的电子世界，而你自己，也只是一个听命于程序的机器。这样的设定使得简陋的游戏内容变得非常合理，并且有一种科幻的美感。加上时常变化的屏幕色彩，突然出现的虚影和干扰，一个九十年代赛博朋客的画风就呈现在你的眼前。
    地板虽然简陋，但是每一关的路线都经过精心设计，当你的进度达到一定程度，或是你经过了指定的地点后，路线就会发生变化，新的路就诞生了。而即便是在路线还没有改变的时候，在你经过同样的地方，背景也会随之改变，这种微妙的变化，让你无从察觉你其实是在一个环形的路线上奔跑。这两点设计非常精彩，虚幻世界的虚无感大大加强。
    最后要说一下难度，这款游戏很难，正常通关应该是在8h以上，但是你在实际玩起来的时候并不会感觉太难，并不是所有的关卡都是单纯以速度提升来增加难度，不同的关卡地形也完全不一样，这就需要玩家通过死来慢慢摸索过关的技巧，当然不得不说，后期速度实在快的惊人，不过好在有办法减速。
    特别的要再次赞美一下原声音乐，就是因为这些音乐，才让我死了10h而不知疲倦。马上ost就要上线了，喜欢的童鞋千万不要错过。
[u]评分：9/10[/u]
[h1]小技巧[/h1]
    首先要记得转弯并不是瞬间转过去的，是有时间间隔的，因此需要打好提前量。
    其次地图上的黄色/红色方块是可以减速的，没关数量固定，连吃效果一般，建议如果是环形需要跑多次的路线，应该设计好哪几圈吃一个，哪几圈不吃。而从第八关开始会见到青色方块，它是用来加速的，加速不一定就没有用，在第九关必须要使用它才能过关。
    之后地图进度会决定你触发一些新路线的机关，只有达到规定进度，并且旁白说了对应的话的时候，地图才会发生变化。而如果地图压根不会变，那你如果有机会，抄近路是完全可以通关的。[spoiler]除了第十关，我还是不知道怎么过。。。[/spoiler]
    最后要说下关卡。全部游戏有十关，官方说后续会加入一个免费dlc再增加一些关卡。[spoiler]然而这和开头那段文字有什么联系呢？[/spoiler]没错，我必须要警告各位，第[u]七[/u]关难度惊人。。。不仅绕的圈数最多，这意味着流程最长，后期加速越多，而且居然有窄路，居然地上还有莫名其妙就飞起来的路障啊！！所以俗话说得好：你要么通关，要么卡死在第七关！@A Gentle Elf 
    另外强调一下，没关开始请听从旁白的指示，这不是史丹利寓言；除了地板所有的东西都可以穿过去；站的太靠边会走着走着掉下去；整个人飞歪了卡在路沿上有机会自己卡出去，当然会很慢；第八关是全游戏最简单的关卡，所以。。。为什么不把它弄到第一关去。。。还有，雪花屏真的好烦啊。。。还有作者你为什么不给屏幕颜色排下序，一个深蓝接一个金黄真是要瞎。。。。
    另附全游戏文本，有时候音乐声音很大，而你又专心过关会漏听文本，其实文本写的很好。

    最最最最后感谢@A Gentle Elf 的谆谆教诲，万分感谢。
[spoiler]然而截至写这篇评测前，我都没有过第十关。。。因为我依然找不到通关的路。。。[/spoiler]

Предложение в наш 2016 год звучит как-то подозрительно. Смею вас уверить, что подозревать тут есть за что. Когда в мире рождается очередная инди игра с сюрреалистичным сюжетом или декорацией становится понятно, что этот вектор себя не изжил и продолжает проникать в разум игроков. Некоторые из них становятся настоящей философией в минималистичных декорациях, а некоторые пытаются создать философию в похожих оттенках, но получается сплошной наркотический сон, например No Think.

Волей не волей хочется сравнить NO THINK с отшумевшей Superhot. Они умеют общие знаменатели. Упрощенная до однотонных геометрических фигур графика, таинственный указующий голос, неясная цель впереди и грубыми мазками расплывчатый сюжет. Правда после этого пути их расходятся. Различия начинаются с цены, она соответствует названию самой игры «НИЧТО». В этот комплект укладываются 10 уровней, которые разительно отличаются друг от друга, но имеют общую структуру в виде длинных и коротких панелек, находящихся рядом друг с другом, которые складываются в заковыристый путь. Глядя на все это вас не покинет мысль, что при создании уровней участвовала популярная штука под названием нейросеть, которая как ей и положено саморазвивается и делает ваш маршрут безумной головоломкой.

Сама по себе игра не вызывает трудностей. Её довольно быстро можно освоить. Всего две кнопки для управления и третья для «начать заново». Третья кнопка будет нажиматься довольно часто, так как игра построена так, что вы, как назло, будете умирать, даже зная в какой момент и какую сторону надо свернуть. Эта феерия поначалу будет даже подначивать вас начать снова и снова, но если вы долго не сможете завершить уровень, то этот синтетический голос, постоянно шепчущий обрывки философии и сюжета, эта музыка в стиле «чиптюн» и сменяющаяся цветовая гамма, приправленная постоянными гличами доведет вас до безумной злобы. Не пытайтесь сделать сделать пару-тройку заходов, когда чувствуете усталость. NO THINK требует максимальной концентрации и терпения.

Не ждите от NO THINK философского сюжета, за простой задачей доставить важное послание Ледяной Королеве в роли клерка-курьера кроется обычный раннер. Кроме того, чтобы доставить вам максимум дискомфорта и как следует позлить игра наполнена огромным количеством глитчей, шумов, артефактов. Думаете вы и с этим справитесь? Тогда приготовьтесь ко все более и более заковыристым трассам, постоянной смене цветовой гаммы от нежных песочных тонов до кислотных лимонных и случайным подергиваниям пальца. Одно не осмотрительное нажатие и начинай нелегкий путь по новой.

Don’t expect philosophical story from NO THINK, with the easy task to deliver a important message to Ice Queen in the role of a clerk-carrier. It’s usual runner. In addition, to give you maximum discomfort and frustration the game is filled with lots of glitches, noises and artifacts. Do you think you can deal with it? Then get ready for more and more catchy tracks, constant change of colors from delicate sandy tones to acidic lemon and randomly twitching fingers. One random slip and all over again

[h1] Overview	[/h1]

NO THING is a minimalistic surreal action game set in a future ruled in a totalitarian regime.  You play as an office clerk who is sent on a mission to deliver an important message to the Ice Queen.  The game progresses through a third-person omniscient narration which dictates the story as you make your way through the labyrinth.

[h1] The Good	[/h1]

Taking the form of classic runner games, NO THING is played with only the left and right arrow keys to dictate the direction your character will move.  As you make more turns, the speed at which your character moves also increases.  It is import to note that on every level, you must turn a certain amount of times in order to progress the narrative to 100%.  However you must also run through the map at least once to progress to the next level.  There are certain orbs you can pick-up that will decrease your speed but on each level they can only be collected once.

With such a simple game design, the driving point of the game is the story.  As you progress throughout the game, you can easily see where the developers pulled inspiration from; [i] 1984[/i], [i] Catch-22 [/i] just to name a few.  The third-person narration plays the role of ‘big brother’ extremely well by utilizing the structure of the leveling system to reveal information about the player and what they should be doing.  Players familiar with the thought process of Winston in [i] 1984 [/i] will quickly realize the similarities in the perception and sentence structure of the narration in NO THING as the game progresses.  

After about 2-3 hours, you will realize the brilliance in combining a runner game and a heavy plot, specifically one related to totalitarianism.  The simple and addictive gameplay hooks you in as a player and enslaves you into “delivering the message to the Ice Queen”.  The narrative voice is quite hypnotic, and will pull the player deeper into the game while the soundtrack will keep you wired, numb and autonomous, functioning similarly to slave songs.  You will effectively be fully immersed into roleplaying as the office clerk.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

The game is rage-inducing if you have poor reaction times.  In order to progress the story, you must be able to clear a level completely, or else you’ll be stuck in a loop; listening to the same lines again and again.  Repetition is good for keeping player attention, but too long and you will eventually break out the trance and just become frustrated with the game.  Often times, you may feel that the game is just ridiculously unfair and just quit because there is no other way to get around a level.

[h1] Overall Score [/h1]

I personally rate this game 7/10 for the thought-provoking storyline and great music.  Had the core gameplay included checkpoints and had been less difficult at the higher levels, the game would have been a solid 9/10.",1463279063,1536377913,True,3,0,0.548872172832489014,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some of the most memorable would be that the neighbors are eating dinner, also they happen to be watching TV, and I could not possibly forget the fact that I have also been taught about their relative location, specifically, that they are located behind the walls and doors.

Jokes aside, this game is a runner genre game, if that is a genre, never heard about it before I laid eyes on this game, it had me interested in it ever since I saw the cover picture in the store. At first I thought that somebody made a vaporwave meme come to life in the form of a game. I was baffled by the fact that the only gameplay is just switching directions by 90 degrees to the right or left and as I would soon learn, having to go a full 360 degrees to save yourself from the endless void underneath the pathways you navigate that make up the levels. The trailer had me hooked, the game is one of a kind if there aren't any other like it, which had me thinking about spending money on it.

So I did.

And I got what I wanted.

This is as simple as an indie about a simple office clerk gets, don't buy the game if you're not looking for uniqueness, it isn't even expensive, so I wouldn't say it's a waste of money if you don't like the game.

Not much to say about the plot as there's not much of a lead to catch onto, but you can make up your own ideas about what's happening in the game. The game has a pretty addicting soundtrack and it blends with the gameplay very well, the increasing speed as you turn makes it even better, in my opinion, all of that makes this game have a good replay value and a drawback effect, I just can't get enough of it. I've also found some exploits (level 3, turn slightly before the turned pathway and get stuck in the corner, press left/right repeatedly for a speed increase and point farming, if you want to place high in the leaderboards) and minor bugs (level 7 had me do some experimenting at the spawn point and I somehow had the character go diagonally, not straight, but this doesn't happen until you die repeatedly and respawn extremely quick, also can make you turn with little delay)

The soundtrack is stunningly amazing, can't wait for the DLC, will gladly pay for it, and would be even more glad to do so if the songs weren't simple loops ripped from the game, but I'll be happy with either.

I wonder what message the clerk was supposed to deliver though, probably a safety railing suggestion for every pathway.",1462997064,1462997064,True,3,1,0.522552251815795898,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Wow... Literally, wow. Evil Indie Games debut on Steam, [b]NO THING[/b], seems to come out of nowhere but man, it does a great job in screwing with our minds! Set in a futuristic dystopia in 1994, you are (and repeatedly referred to as) the simplest office clerk tasked with delivering a message to the Queen of Ice. The game, as I would like to call it, is a precision runner where you play in a first person view and there is an ending to each level after achieving the required number of turns, as in directional turns. It sounds easier in words but trust me, it gets hard, like REALLY HARD, as the pace would continuously increase throughout the level and made even worse with tight turns, bumps and jumps in between. Missed a turn or overshoot a jump and BAM, back to the starting line for you! It literally took me 30 minutes just to get pass the first stage!

NO THING consists of 10 levels in total and each of them are told as a story by the narrator. This is one of the best points of the game, the backstory is intriguing and fascinating that will leave you wondering why and what is going on. The monotone narrative accompanied by seriously catchy tunes will get you humming the thing even when you've stopped playing, especially if you're stuck at a level for a while. There are a score system implemented in the game but to be honest, I haven't quite got the whole thing figured out yet. 

Despite all the positive points, I guess the biggest flaw that NO THING currently have is the lack of contents. As I've mentioned previously, there's only 10 levels and depending on how good you are playing this type of games, it can be a pretty short experience. Luckily, they're planning to release a free DLC in the near future, titled EVERYTHING, which may be a new mode or a new story arc as a whole (if anyone have more information regarding this, I'd appreciate it if you can share it in the comments section below). Oh, and they're also planning to release the soundtrack DLC. Yay!


[h1]PROS[/h1]

[list]
[*]GORGEOUS minimalistic design fitting perfectly to the portrayed dystopia!
[*]Soundtracks that will literally stuck in your head, whether you like it or not (in a good way, of course). One of the few that I'd seriously consider in purchasing in the future.
[*]Simple and tight controls that are just nice and true to the minimalistic nature of the game.
[*]The game runs great! Performance are stable all around with all the Steam basic functionalities present and functional, except for the lack of Cloud saving.
[*]Global online leaderboard are available for you to keep scores.
[*]Graphics setting are from the standard Unity launcher. It's not bad but not great either.
[*]Free content DLC coming soon!
[/list]

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]

[list]
[*]Sometimes the game just feel too hectic for you to enjoy or at least get the sense of what the narrator is trying to say. It'd be great if they can add something like a casual or relax mode just so you can listen to the track and enjoy the narrative. For now, I'd recommend checking out Ryusaki Minoru's & Saint Simon's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665442979]Transcription Guide[/url] after finishing a level just to fully understand what the level is actually about. Spoiler alert, of course.
[/list]

[h1]CONS[/h1]

[list]
[*]Lack in contents in overall. Only one mode is available at the time of the review and the story mode only consists of 10 levels.
[*]Pressing the Esc button exits the game immediately. It would be so much better if they could provide a confirmation window first because you know, misclicked or rage quit and stuff.
[*]In-game option only consists of Sounds and Music toggle and also option to change language to Polish.
[/list]


[h1]To conclude, [b]NO THING[/b] is a solid precision runner game with an interesting setting and fair difficulty curve to boot. I give it a well deserved [b]4/5[/b]! Now, go fourth, Simplest Office Clerk![/h1]

For those who enjoyed runner games, or futuristic dystopia setting, in general and wouldn't mind a little challenge, I have no problem recommending this title to you guys! At the price tag of $4, this is a steal for this kind of gem.

NO THING is a game in the same vein as Temple Run and Boson X. Your character runs forward non stop and you move them left or right to avoid obstacles and death. I've always had a guilty pleasure for these games as they kill some time and can feel very rewarding when you finish a level after failing at it so many times.

This is what NO THING is but has a interesting concept behind it. You play as a office clerk who is delivering messages to people. As you run about the place, a robotic voice talks to you about a lot of different things such as Totalitarianism and Mundanity of everyday life. This is annoying in its own way though as you have to restart the level from the beginning    if you die, meaning you have to listen to the same piece of dialogue over and over again. 

After a couple of levels, this game does start to become a little bit boring. You end up finishing a level out of determination rather than enjoyment. The graphic glitches and colours that they throw at you can make it hard to concentrate which adds extra challenge but could also cause quite a headache. 

I would still recommend this game. If it goes on sale for a couple quid, I would pick it up. Its only about 2 - 3 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are at these type of games, and does try to do something interesting with a simple gameplay mechanic. 7/10.

On its essence it is very simple, it is a first person maze runner in which, as you play, levels get progressively harder and you start moving faster and faster. But on the other hand, it is rather weird in terms of story and overall theme.

[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]

In this game you’ll only be pressing the left and right keys to change the direction of where you’re going, which might sound easy at first, but once you start increasing in speed you’ll find that it requires precise timing to avoid falling off the level, especially on later levels. This makes the game really addicting, even more so if you get stuck on a level, which is perfect for either short minute sessions or hour long sessions, because it has that strong feeling of [i]”just one more run[/i]. Despite the fact that the game is based around just pressing two keys, the levels manage to keep things interesting, wich each successive level changing its setting and the structure of the tracks you’re running on. Some levels are flat but with quick turns, while others have a lot of verticality which allow you to save yourself if you eventually fall off, which you most likely will.

Still, when you get stuck on a level it gets infuriating because you’re constantly going through the same route and hearing the same thing over and over. Nonetheless, it feels amazing when you finally finish a level after so many tries and those last moments are ecstatic.

[b][u]Story, visuals and sound:[/u][/b]

Like I said, [i]storywise[/i] it can be rather weird, but it starts as it follows, you’re an office clerk and must deliver a message to the Ice Queen, which I interpret as either your boss or some sort of leader. As you play through each level, that get progressively harder and harder, this voice that sounds like it is coming from an old robot speaker keeps talking to you, telling you things, random things that initially don’t make that much sense but as you die and have to repeat the level and listen to it again, some sort of idea starts growing on your head. I also think that this is here to try to get your attention out of the game, because [i]it is kind of hard to pay attention to what is being said and to the game itself[/i], especially when you start moving really fast.

One thing that needs to be mentioned is the fact that the [b]music in this game is bloody great[/b]. The music, the stylish visuals, the chiptune sound effects and the setting all together make the game feel extremely retro and futuristic, at the same time.

The only [b][u]complaint[/u][/b] that I have about the game are the quick changing bright colors that can induce some slight headaches. I do really like the fact that the levels themselves become somewhat distorted, with some sort of graphical glitch.

I find this game to be immensely frustrating, as such, but I gave myself five before coming back to review it.

[h1] So what is NO THING? It's fast-paced, unforgiving, and challenging. It falls into the endless runner genre in which you keep on moving forward until you either crash into something or fall off of the track. It has a good--no *great* soundtrack and an abstract, funky art style. [/h1]

It's also frustrating as all hell. Due to my own failings, of course, so I can't really blame the game for that.

.Premise.
You're a messenger of sorts. The simplest office clerk. You're delivering a message to the Queen of Ice. You'll find out more about yourself through the robotic narrator as you run through and complete the stages.

.Gameplay.
Run. You move forward automatically and it's up to you to turn left or right to avoid death. That's all there is to it. The game tries its best to distract you with on-screen visual interferences (like colour changes and graphical glitching/blurring) and a nonsensical ""story"" that punctuates moments in your progress with a robotic voice reading a line of text that flashes across the screen. 

As you progress, things get more difficult. The speed of your run increases, and so the precision of your turns will need fine-tuning.

Focus is the name of the game here and if you're easily distracted, you'll fall out of your groove and go plummeting to your death. Once you die, you start the level again from the beginning. Then, you try again and again until, finally, you either finish the stage or hit the escape key and go play something else while you cool off.

You can use either keyboard or gamepad. Either works just as well.

.Soundtrack.
So good. I've only managed to get to the second level in my hour of play, but the first track was synthetic... upbeat... electronic... awesome and the second track was a slower, more mellow synthetic upbeat electronic awesome. I assume each stage has its own individual song that plays throughout the entire run.

.Graphics/ Art Style.
Trippy to say the least. The face on the game's banner appears throughout the stages, which are always awash in bright, solid colours. If you have a history of epilepsy, please do NOT play this game.

.Longevity.
That depends on your skill level. I'm god-awful at this game and it took me about fifteen minutes to get through the first level. The remainder of my time was spent floundering over level two. If you're an expert runner, you probably won't get as much time out of this as the average Joe.

.Bottom line.
If you're a fan of the runner genre, this game will be a great addition to your library. If you're on the fence about the genre or are new, you may still get some enjoyment from the soundtrack and surreal atmosphere.

NO THING. Run fast. Turn left, turn light. Deliver the message to the Queen of Ice. All those words in my head. I feel I am that office clerk. This is a fantastic and challenging maze runner with a touch of a platformer game. NO THING is also an addictive game, maybe one of the most addictive games aI ever played in years. Difficult and you need to be fast minded or you loose. I do not recommend to play it if you suffer headaches. Those changing and blowing neon colors, fast, fast,fast!

What did I love from No Thing? The background story of the game. But also, the shining colors, the music, the art. I loved the art, is just amazing. Minimalistic, with a touch of a not so retro future. I think every decade has a different concept of the future. The game is placed in 1994, and the future is so minimal, so colorful and so monotone at the same time.

Totalitarian regime? Maybe sounds like 1894. What do you think? Just follow the story.

I can't forget the music, the music is an electronic constant in my head right now, a retro techno of the 80's. Great for the art concept in general. This is more than a platformer game, really, more than that. 

No Thing is a quite a conceptual game, one of few ones. Actually, I don't remember the last time I played a game like this one.

The gameplay is simple: use right and left keys to navigate and run. Deliver the message, discover the story behind. Think fast and maybe you'll pass the game. Use the physics on your side or you'll have to start again and again and again. Happened to me. A lot of times actually.

And I don't play it if you suffer headaches. 

I recommend the game, not only for the difficulty, also the story behind and the concept in general.

The idea of NO THING is very simple: you are a simple office clerk with a message you must deliver to the Ice Queen. The gameplay consists of you navigating levels with nothing more than your left and right keys. Though it sounds easy at first, NO THING is anything but. 
You start on level one which is an easy introduction of what is to come. You must follow the path in front of you turning left and right when needed. There is a voice speaking to you as you play, telling you things, some which make sense and some which don't (not right away anyway) and a rather awesome soundtrack playing. You'll see images whilst you play that'll change depending on what's being said. You should spend your time playing NO THING listening and looking very carefully.

The levels progressively get harder, not just from level one to level two, but whilst you are actually playing them. Platforms will move, appear and disappear. Graphics will flicker, glitch (intentional) and change colour. Images will change, enlarge, shrink and move through platforms. Everything that happens is there to test your focus and concentration; [b]this is not a game for those who suffer from motion sickness or anything similar.[/b] NO THING is all about your perception of things and requires you not only to evaluate your surroundings quickly but to also ignore all of the background distraction. Platforms come in different sizes, some being thin and some wider. There are others which are slanted, some which don't properly connect and some which are slightly off centre. You must be alert at all times whilst playing because even clicking half a second too late could be the difference between winning a level and starting all over again. As you run you gain speed continually though I've not yet worked out if this is linked to the amount of turns you take or how long you've been running for. Your speed can work for you or against you, often being helpful for flying from one platform to others that would have been out of reach at a lower speed, but it also makes things a lot harder as your reaction speed has to increase with it. You can find red blocks in certain places to reduce your speed if things start getting a little out of control.
Falling from a platform doesn't always mean death though. Many levels weave in and out of each other and are on different heights so if you can react quick enough you can find yourself at another part of the level and just continue running.
Your paths will grow as you progress in the stage and some of them require you to repeatedly run the same path multiple times before something new opens. Often you'll find this will happen quickly and throw you off guard. You can also take different paths, though they'll all eventually lead to the same place, after all, choice is just an illusion in a totalitarian world. 

But the enjoyment of NO THING doesn't just come from the gameplay itself, what really grips you is the story and the way you experience it. Everything, from the dialogue to the music to the images, it just keeps you wanting to play, to find out more, to reach the end. You'll spend the game trying to work out what's going on in this world, with you, and the voice but slowly you'll piece things together bit by bit. 
I found NO THING to be oddly relaxing. When the gameplay wasn't frustrating because i'd failed so many times, the pressing right and left at the right time combined with the soundtrack was oddly calming. At some points when you find your rhythm the game flows perfectly and the levels are long enough that when they aren't too hard and you know the route you need to take, it just works. 

There are only two negative things I can really find about the game, the first is the lack of some kind of a free runner mode. Given the games intense difficulty it would be enjoyable to have endless (or large) levels to practice on so you don't have to continuously repeat a level you're stuck on until you beat it. This is directly link to my second issue which is the fact that the game can feel repetitive at times if you cannot complete a level. There was one particular part where I was reaching 99% and missing the last turn meaning I had to replay the entire level over and over hearing the same dialogue. Though the voice-over is what makes the game so good, hearing it for the 12th time after doing the same bit of a very long level 12 times is rage-inducing. I think a checkpoint system would help but in the same breath I think it'd take something away from the game. The grinding and repetitiveness is a good mirror of life in a totalitarian regime. 

[b]I don't know if it was the intention of NO THING to be a dark mirror of reality but I think it does it perfectly. I've never found a game for $4 that's as addictive as this and I really can't recommend this game enough, the experience has been amazing so far. Though difficult at times, the challenge is worth it. How hard can it be, after all, you are just the simplest office clerk. You have one message and you know what you should do.

I actually managed to get past the first two levels and the dialogue was the most interesting thing I have yet to hear. It's like a book that you have to read over and over to really understand the meaning. It's like Moby Dick (perhaps not AS complex) or As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner. At first it seems like it's all nonsense with seemingly poor sentence structure, awkward phrasing but then you realize it's like that for a reason, and since the arcade style game is actually challenging, it forces you to restart and really listen to what it is saying. 

****-SPOILERS-**** sort of...

The game talks about you, a supposed ""simplest office clerk"" and the third level especially talks about people in your ear and it tells you to think two times implying (what I think would be) that you think twice before speaking and that you're supposed to listen to what ""they"" tell you. It does say after all that it is set in a totalitarian regime. 

It gives off an almost ""what's the point"" sort of feel, as it also talks about you the ""simplest office clerk"" working 8 hours and sleeping 8 hours watching tv for 8 hours and things of those sorts, a routine that is mundane and what seems pointless. You having an office job that you work for 8 hours for, to bring bread to the table, only to be stuck in routine and do nothing in your spare time but something ordinary such as watching TV. 

Life loses its meaning as it also talks about all those pointless interactions with people you have on a daily basis, one line in the game went along the lines of 'they hear you, but they don't really care about you or what you have to say' because to them you're just another ""simplest office clerk"". Emphasis on ""simplest"". They could have just said ""office clerk"" but no, the simplest was added, and I think that was just to put more emphasis on the whole concept that maybe this really all is pointless, working 8 hours a day, and sleeping 8 hours with people telling you what to do in your ear and you having to think twice about what to say because you're in a totaliatrian regime.  

ANOTHER line that I really found interesting went along the lines of ""hoping for happiness"" after you do everything that they tell you to do. But I mean really, what happiness can you achieve when all you've done and will ever do is be a simple office clerk. It really (I think) focuses on the mundane aspects of life and puts a big emphasis on the whole ""what's the point ordeal"" and the repeating and following orders like a machine day after day. 

Play level 3 and you'll get EXACTLY what I'm trying to convey. It's a really fantastic game. It doesn't need to be complex to get its point across, and I love these sorts of games where it really makes you think, yet it's so simple. Like Papers, Please. Maybe I read too much into this, but if you make it to the third level, and really listen to the dialogue, even in level two, you can hopefully see what I'm talking about. 

Oh, another thing. What helps me pass levels is when you're turning, wait until half of the next platform horizontal to you is past your screen before you press to switch directions. I found it helped me with timing, and gave me a bit of reference as to when to turn. 

ALL IN ALL, GREAT GAME.

While the visuals are pretty unique retro-minimalistic and works on its favor, it also works against the gameplay. The game changes color after certain number of inputs, and going from soft colors to suddenly a bright neon red can and will blind you while you try to stay focus.

Pues sí, simplemente eso. Pero a medida que vas incrementado el recorrido ( giros ) la velocidad aumenta exponencialmente, además de que tus zapatos, si vas escuchando la voz, te dice: Cuidado suelo resbaladizo. Muerto. 

A medida que vas avanzando en el juego, la voz, te va a indicar alguna pista  que otra, sobre el recorrido, con lo cual debes ponerle atención a lo que va diciendo, de vez en cuando. Otras solo dice cosas metafísicas xD.

Incréible lo adictivo que es este juego, realmente. lo es. Ya que a medida que vas haciendo los giros, un medidor te va indicando, cuantos giros llevas hechos. Y además, el Tanto por ciento que llevas recorrido.

For a game with only two buttons it is surprisingly deep, both in execution potential and theorycrafting optimal routes; should I take this cube now? Next lap? Never? Players can tailor their choices to match their skill levels and try to complete this surprisingly difficult game.

What's also exciting about No Thing is the speedrunning possibilities. Given the technically optional nature of many of the blocks, the varying level completion requirements, and the opportunities to deviate from the intended course, you have a lot of unique ways for players to approach the challenges and try to finish the game as fast as possible. It's also a punishing game for a speedrunner; dying late on a level like 7 or 10 will set you back multiple minutes, meaning that there will be fairly big gaps between runs with 0 deaths and those with even a single death.

I would recommend this to most people who enjoy a unique challenge in their games. Level 7, for example, reminded me of the frustration I experienced in trying to complete Veni Vidi Vici in VVVVVV for the first time. The game lacks in depth of gameplay elements so if you're looking for something with a conceptually broad scope then you'd best look elsewhere. Additionally, while streaming the game I had a viewer experience some mild motion sickness. If you're prone to a motion sickness response from games, stay away.

Overall, this game is super satisfying and I definitely got more than my money's worth with the cheap price point. I plan to stream more of this game, and now that I've completed a run I'll be attempting speedruns of it as well. I encourage others to challenge themselves to do the same.",1460419037,1460419037,True,1,0,0.485773772001266479,0,True,False,False,False,,,

NO THING é bizarro, mas de uma maneira (estranhamente) boa. Basicamente, é um jogo do estilo ""runner"", um filho de ""FOTONICA"" e ""Velocibox"". Lembra muito o primeiro em seu gameplay, você não aperta nenhum botão para correr, a personagem está sempre correndo. E quanto mais você aguenta, mais rápido a personagem corre. Você apenas aperta as teclas direcionais para fazer as curvas. Lembra o segundo na dificuldade dos obstáculos, e a mecânica de movimento é um pouco parecida, pelo menos na sensação.

Ele diz ter uma história, igualmente bizarra. Comecei a prestar atenção nela no começo, algo sobre você ter que enviar uma mensagem à Rainha, um monte de frases soltas sobre diversos temas, algumas esparsas sem nenhum sentido aparente. Meio filosófico, meio político, inteiramente bizarro. Mas não dá pra prestar atenção na história por muito tempo, depois o jogo fica tão difícil que se você não focar 100% no que está fazendo, você não vai longe.

E é na dificuldade que NO THING tem o seu ponto forte. Como jogos do estilo, eles são feitos para te tirar do sério. E NO THING faz isso de maneira maestral. O primeiro nível é plano, horizontal, sem muitas surpresas. Mas no segundo ele te apresenta a verticalidade, e é aí que a coisa complica. Ele também não tem um caminho só, se você enquanto estiver no ar após pular de uma plataforma, e puder tanto continuar reto ou virar à esquerda, desde que o caminho tenha continuidade, você pode, e isso contará no seu progresso. Você acumula progresso apenas por correr, não importa a direção, até se você, de alguma maneira, seguir a ""contra-mão"".

Alguns caminhos, inclusive, são sem saída. E é aí que o jogo começa a testar sua memória. Você lembrará que aquele caminho leva à morte, mesmo tendo passado por ele várias vezes? É difícil. Me vi morrendo várias vezes assim, mesmo confiante de que conhecia o mapa com as minhas mãos.

O visual é lindo, todo monocromático com cores que se alternam. Faces bizarras, algumas de faces conhecidas aparecem aleatoriamente no ar, assim como alguns objetos. Surreal. A trilha sonora é ótima, lembra bandas do começo da música eletrônica como Kraftwerk, e a narração em voz robótica reforça essa ideia.

Resumindo, jogo dificílimo, para quem gosta de desafiados. Divertido, bonito e a um bom preço. Recomendadíssimo.

[h1][b]Prós:[/b][/h1]

- Atmosfera surrealista e retro-futurista 
- Ótima trilha sonora de música eletrônica, lembra Kraftwerk
- Bom preço, entrega bastante conteúdo pro seu valor
- Curva de aprendizado difícil de dominar
- Bastante desafiador, fazendo jus aos clássicos do gênero

[h1][b]Contras:[/b][/h1]

- É difícil entender a progressão de cada level, já que você não é punido por seguir caminhos diferentes, ele te deixa bem livre nesse aspecto, o que é um pouco ruim em um jogo tão objetivo

Textual summary:
A textual summary will never compare to a full video. Take a look at the video for the best possible impression.

So, Can i recommend this title? No.
Do i hate it? Also... No.

My problem with this game isn't it's very simple endless runner gameplay. It's also not the simple graphics that appear to hang around in the sky. 

My main problem is the very tight field of view, coupled with the pixelated, color-tastic psychedelic overlays. They are literally migraine inducing.
So yes, the game is cheap as dirt, and credit where due: The music is Fantastic, even if it does get repetitive on the 999th try for a level. also, the narrator and tightness of the (simple) controls are spot on.

But none of that matters, when i'm physically unable to keep playing due to migraines, and that's NO THING to joke about.

Levels get progressively harder as you get further into the game (level 7 gave me more trouble than bloodborne. Evil Indie Games is a literal game description btw) with more difficult challenges.  I died so many times on the first area alone, one at 99% complete -_- Music is really great and fits the psychadelic kinda style of the visuals. The story is so weird but interesting too in a way.

Will update as I play more but 10/10, would die at 99% area complete again.",1460019635,1460200963,True,44,9,0.605633020401000977,0,True,False,False,False,,,
