Like all endless/autorunners, you're moving and you can't stop.  All you can do is avoid the obstacles coming at you in this incredibly shallow shovelware game.  But there's a bit of a difference here as the game features a couple of different mechanics... which, while novel, don't actually improve anything in the old, dead formula.  What differences?  Instead of a single runner, you control a group of tribesmen (and a special ""shaman"" who holds all the ""xp"", if he dies that's reset).  You split the tribesmen, which has a couple of effects... it influences whether animals will be afraid of you or not, and it pushes tribesmen into different lanes... there's obstacles like bridges and so on, and your tribesmen need to be aligned to those lanes.  Likewise there's bushes and animals and you have to ensure your tribesmen hit them to gather stuff.

Speaking of gathering, there's our second gimmick... a food counter.  If that runs out, you die, so you need to gather food.  You do this by first aligning you tribesmen through the ""split/join"" mechanic, and you also need to equip a tool to do it.  There's 5 different tools for different pickups/hazards, like torches so you can see at night, empty hands to gather berries, a spear to kill deer things for meat, and so on.

Again, it's a gimmick that makes this more than your average endless runner, but it doesn't make it any better or more fun.  Let's get into the technical defects. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

While there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just point and click stuff like a browser/Flash game.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because this is designed for consoles, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Tribal Pass didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for finishing the tutorial, trivial to get, but less than 13 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, and isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 13 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who didn't bother engaging with this game?  Trading cards.  People will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.

That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with little merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

So, should you buy this game?

Tribal Pass has the insane price of around $7 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  For comparison, the $7 asking price for this game could get you games like ""Portal 2"", ""Fallout 4"" or ""DOOM"".  Quality, professionally made games like those are frequently on sale cheaper than this.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

---

Instead of being a single person running in a direction, you're the entire tribe.

Screen moves in one direction (running down, screen moves up with your group at the top facing down). You have controls for changing the formation of your group into different running channels and what weapon/tool they have in their hands. You have to collect food (by changing group formation and/or tools) and avoid obstacles while also managing food and group size while some people die and new recruits are brought in. Survive with at least some tribe members and you pass the day and carry on to the next landscape to run through.

Complete enough days and you unlock another campaign ""story"" (not that there's any real story beyond ""we run that direction to survive, follow the shaman"")

It requires some quick thinking, sacrifices to be made, and a little luck to overcome some of the random layouts that don't always provide enough food. Compared to other runners you're making quick tactical formation and weapon decisions rather than making turns or jumps.
---

Bottom line: It can be a fun little time waster, but it is ultimately still just a runner.

Tribal Pass, це ранер у стилі первобитних людей, але дуже нетиповий за своєю механікою і концепцією. Кожен раз проходячи забіг, треба враховувати багато факторів, щоб не просто пройти місію, але і не втратити людей, чи не довести до канібалізму. Якщо коротко, геймплейно, це дуже цікава і не звичайна гра, тут від мене просто респект. Візуал і музика, у грі доволі непогані. Візуал є приємним піксельним, а музика доволі проста, але вона гарно додає до стилістики епохи. Також у грі є повна українська локалізація, що дуже круто. Також у грі є доволі цікаві ачивки, які я з задоволенням пішов виконувати, бо мені було цікаво проходити усі челенжджи гри.

Якщо підводити підсумки про цю гру, то я вам дуже рекомендую її взяти, це дійсно не типова гра. Ви зможете пройти її за декілька годин і отримати новий і цікавий досвід, а ціна на гру доволі мала, так що не сильно вдарить по вашому бюджету. Бачу у відгуках апеляцію до того, що цю гру зробив український військовий, але я не хочу применшувати якість гри і вміння розробника, і казати вам купити її тільки через те, що розробник є поважним військовим, бо це применшить якість, вкладені сили розробника і творчу задумку. В першу чергу я рекомендую вам купити її, бо це якісна і незвичайна гра, а вже в другу, що це гра від нашого розробника.

L'objectif ? Rejoindre un nouveau lieu plus propice pour s'établir dans la durée.

Durant vos courses vous devrez tuer à l'aide de vos lances des cerfs, faire attention aux rhinocéros, aux fauves, aux ptérodactyles... ne pas tomber dans l'eau (ils ne savent pas nager!), dans les sables mouvants, récolter des baies, recruter (ou pas!) des nouveaux groupes d'hommes...
Vos premiers run seront difficiles, mais vous apprendrez au fur et à mesure quelques astuces pour ne plus perdre 90% de votre tribu... (on ne recrute pas de nouveaux hommes avec des lances à la main, ou vous pouvez effrayer les fauves avec les torches par exemple...)

Graphiquement ça pique un peu les yeux bien sur, on est sur un jeu pixels complètement assumé, mais le thème était, pour moi, suffisamment fort pour que je m'y attele assez vite.

Petit point sur les succès rien de très compliqué, il vous faudra entre 1 et 3 heures pour en venir à bout. Certains ne sont pas si évident, mais la plupart de déverrouilleront sans que vous ne le fassiez vraiment exprès.

Но в первую очередь, это раннер с видом сверху. Вы берёте на себя роль небольшого племени, которое безостановочно бежит вперёд. Одним кликом вы можете разделять толпу на разные группы и соединять их обратно. На пути племени находятся разнообразные препятствия (болота, реки, опасные звери и др.). Помимо препятствий на пути встречаются ягодные кустарники и животные. Но фишка геймплея в том, что племя не только нужно разделять, чтобы обойти препятствия, но и вовремя сменить элементы. Например, факел в руках освещает путь, когда наступает ночь. Копья помогают охотиться на зверей, а пустые руки идут для сбор кустов. По пути будете встречать другие племена, которые присоединятся к вашему в том случае, если у вас больше народа. Но увеличение вашего племени требует больших ресурсов. Чаще нужно охотиться и собирать пищу. Зато, чтобы завалить крупного зверя, нужно как-раз много людей. Ещё интересный момент есть. Перед забегом вы можете переждать ночь и бежать днём. В этом случае, вы теряете еду. А если бежать ночью, то нужно вооружать племя факелом.
Так же в племени есть шаман, у которого своеобразные примочки. Одна из них, например, каннибализм. Да-да, порой, чтобы выжить всему племени, кое-кого нужно сожрать:-)
Во время забегов можно выбирать более лёгкий путь или наоборот, более сложный. Различаются пути рельефом местности, препятствиями, а так же количеством еды.

[b][u] GRAPHICS -  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
''Tribal Pass'' is a pixel-art runner game. While it have a good colour variation its not pretty beautiful even for a game that's made with Unity.

[b][u] MUSIC - ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
The same sound loop going over and over again. (And not even a good one...)

[b][u] STORY -  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
The Earth gets destroyed from a asteroid and a shaman and his tribesmen must run trough the villiages to save the world. Well thats what the first and only 30 second ''cut-picture'' will tell you about anything which is about a ''story''

[b][u] GAMEPLAY -  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆  [/u][/b]
Tribal Pass is a runner game. You running down with a couple of tribesmen and need to split them while running or chance if they got nothing in their hands to pick up berries or speers to hunt animals. Thats everything. 
You probably guessed right that a game that can be summarized in one sentence will also be just making fun for one playtrough. And thats the case with this game. It functions and I respect every dev for making their own games but this one is just so terrible mediocre that you will be better off playing every other Steam Game under 5€ which is on Sale right now.

[b][u] WORTH BUYING - ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
If you want to play a runner game than there a two options. 1) Go on your smartphone and play one of the 10000000 runner games on it or 2) Go on a harsh search for a good runner game on steam. Unfortunately Tribal Pass is not such a good game - just a sandcorn in the sahara of games that will never be picked out and surely will be forgotten when time chances. This game will bring you a maximum of 1 hour of fun.

This could be good if there were some obvious hints, but there isn't really, and if you're accidently doing something and you don't know what it is then it can be very confusing.

У племени выбора нет и им приходится бежать. Tribal Pass настоящий хардкорный раннер, забеги получаются очень короткими, но насыщенными на действия. Местный мир крайне недружелюбен, из положительного только ягоды и олени. А всё остальное здорово прореживает ваших соплеменников. Загибайте пальцы - птеродактили, бронированные носороги, жуткие птицы, саблезубые тигры, надоедливая мошкара и вся эта братва желает полакомиться бегунками, добавьте быстрые воды, деревья и другие племена, плюс страшные ночи как в Играх Престолов. Условия забега меняются от выбранного маршрута, холодные степи бедны припасами, но чаще встречаются алтари; в джунглях гораздо больше провианта, но и враги многочисленнее. Ведёт племя главная тактическая единица шаман, чем дольше он во главе тем быстрее прокачиваются его умения., а их не мало. Мудрец способен не только разделять и соединять ораву, но и вооружать племя копьями и факелами. Главные же его фишки размножение на ходу за еду и каннибализм, трудные времена требуют жёстких решения, иначе племя обречено. Потеря шамана не летальна, но занявшему его место приходится выучивать все умения заново. По мере прохождения открывается большой побег, где вы вольны задать условия. Tribal Pass пробегается за час, за это же время выбиваются все 14 достижений.
Рисовка раннера выполнена в олдскульном стиле, что в игре про первобытные племена вполне оправданный шаг. Некоторые животные выглядят довольно солидно, особенно подлетающий ящер и степенно бредущий носорог. Но всё остальное воспринимается как детская мазня гуашью. Карты крохотные и мне непонятно почему на них так мало объектов. Уже на третий забег вы гарантированно увидите все предметы, что есть в загашнике Tribal Pass. С музыкальной частью вышло неоднозначно, основная мелодия хороша, звучные барабаны создают нужную атмосферу, а вот сэмплы звуков можно было бы сделать реалистичнее. Tribal Pass создавался на Unity, что всегда несёт определённые проблемы с оптимизацией, но к счастью разработчик с ними совладал . По крайней мере лагов и долгих загрузок я не наблюдал. Единственное, после первого прохождения она у меня крашнулась, но большой забег после перезагрузки всё-так открылся.
Tribal Pass, как раннер довольно неплох. Он вполне способен подарить один нескучный вечер. Хватит этого или нет, решать конечно вам, но лично мне хотелось бы больше контента и случайных событий.

[h1]МНЕНИЕ:[/h1]
Это до безумия простая игра с мимолетным, но необычным опытом. Я очень давно не играл в раннеры - да и не хотел... [spoiler](так как забил на мобильную игровую династию Gay-Ming и даже не планирую возвращаться)[/spoiler] но не пожалел, что потратил целых 30 рублей именно на это. Потому что, в данном случае, это действительно нетипичный представитель своего жанра. 

В игре разнообразные препятствия и необычный способ их преодоления. То есть, одной кнопкой мы разбиваем группу каждый раз на 2. А другой - собираем с такой же силой. Опасность препятствия зависит от вашего количества соплеменников. Чем больше - тем успешнее. Есть олени всякие. Есть другие животинки. Есть даже птеродактиль! Но его не убить... Есть носорог, но его малой кучкой не взять. Но вы сможете, к примеру, захватить чужое племя, если ваше больше. Вы сможете также замочить толпой целого носорога! Или напугать хищную кошку факелами!  И это классно, но стоит учесть, что вам нужно следить ещё и за количеством еды, которое ежесекундно убывает. Нужно также по карте собирать еду. Собирательством или охотой. Для этого нужно находить кусты (но не все можно есть, кстати...) и собирать их руками. Для охоты нужны копья для ваших товарищей. Они открываются на втором уровне шамана... 

Тут есть уровни? Да, тут есть уровень шамана. Они нужны для того, чтобы открывать новые скиллы на панели из 5 штук. А также для того, чтобы тратить их на какие-либо действия. К примеру, принять новых людей в племя. Или наоборот... съесть их... Да, и такое можно. Если еда на нуле, то это единственный быстрый способ выжить. Но недолгий...

И всё это сумбурное происходит в двух кампаниях. Есть обычны забег. Грубо говоря, вам нужно провести своё племя от точки А до точки Б. Однако, вам дают на выбор 2 пути к цели. Тут есть разные ландшафты, у которых свои особенности. Где-то больше еды, но больше опасностей. Где-то мало еды, но и мало живности и прочего. Вы должны выбрать для себя, какие минусы (или плюсы) вам подходят в данный момент. Также дается выбор: вывести свое племя в ночь, или дождаться утра. Переждать стоит лишней еды, а если выйти в ночь -то пропадает видимость без факелов. А по мере прохождения могут падать некие плюшки, которые могут облегчить вам перенаселение. К примеру, можно лишний раз (за кадром) поохотится или найти и захватить племя. 

Второй режим - большое перенаселение. Тут нужно контролить не только во время игры, но и до игры. Старый дом и новый. Единственный совет - не ставьте ползунок еды на 100%. Иначе... во втором походе ее вообще не будет. Имейте это ввиду.

В общем, это все, что вам нужно знать. И даже больше. Вряд ли эта игра затянет вас надолго. Не более часа-двух игры. Больше игра не может дать. После этого времени будет просто не совсем интересно играть. Механика надоест. А мотиваторов здесь, кроме таблицы лидеров, нету. В прочем, для меня эта таблица - очень сомнительная мотивация.

В целом, игра оставила приятные впечатления, несмотря на скоротечность. Мне понравилось. Было действительно классно. Могу пожаловаться только на завышенный ценник без скидки. Но в СНГ редко кто по фулл-прайсу покупает. Будем честны... [spoiler]С:[/spoiler]

A top-down runner game with limited replayability but interesting theme. Worth getting on a sale or as a bundle but otherwise there's not much on offer here.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The premise of the game is fairly simple: Avoid impending doom by crossing a number of zones with your tribe and keeping at least some of them alive by the end. The game is played from a top-down perspective and your tribe advances automatically. You have two main mechanics to help you do this Firstly, splitting or joining the group into halves will allow it to cover more area and avoid obstacles, which is required to bypass or interact with most of the obstacles in your path. The second mechanic is a series of actions your tribe can do such as equipping spears or torches, both of which lead to different interactions with the environment. In addition, you can create new tribesmen or cannibalize existing ones for food. 

Food is the main limiting factor of a run, as it depletes constantly according to your tribe's size and most of your environmental interactions that don't involve avoiding danger will be focused on gathering this essential resource, whether they involve hunting animals (or fellow tribesmen), picking berries or sacrificing your tribe at an altar. Between zones, you will receive a token which allows you to claim a one-time bonus and you have a choice of two zones for your next segment of the run with some variation in resources and threats, therefore offering a small amount of tactical decision-making based on your available resources.

All that said, the game has an interesting concept but a lackluster execution. Procedural generation means that, more often than not, a set of obstacles or simply the lack of food sources means your tribe will end up starving, often even during the first zone. The zones also don't really offer any surprises after going through them once or twice and learning how to deal with the various obstacles. The resource management aspect of the game could be great if elaborated upon or if the player had more influence on it compared to random chance but as it stands there's not a big reason to come back to it. This is one of those games where a neutral rating would be appropriate but as it stands I'd only really recommend it as part of a bundle, sale or other such deal.

[h1]Visuals & Audio[/h1]
The visual and audio design work well to convey the various obstacles in your path in a clear manner but there's not much else to say that the screenshots of the game won't reveal to you. Music-wise, the tribal soundtrack is fitting and enhances the experience but didn't feel especially noteworthy or memorable to me.

[h1]Completion[/h1]
Completion is a simple affair and can be done in a fairly short amount of time. Most of the achievements can be gotten either during regular gameplay or with a small amount of effort on the player's part and they cover most of what you can do in the game without overstaying their welcome.",1577365502,1577365523,True,2,1,0.530364334583282471,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏的核心玩法应该是策略而不是动作，我们只能在很小程度上操控角色的行动轨迹，所以这款游戏要是称之为跑酷还是不合理的。",1567078990,1567078990,True,0,0,0.126148954033851624,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The idea itself is an interesting twist on the runner genre. Whilst the graphics and sound are good sadly the gameplay itself is not. 

Basically you are totally at the mercy of RNG each time you play. And more often than not the RNG is not in your favour leaving the game with little in the way of fair or balanced levels. Add in some slightly cumbersome controls and the game quickly loses its appeal.

You split your tribe into groups to cross bridges, gather berries, and hunt animals. You need to equip spears to hunt, but animals run from large groups. You need to use torches to kill flies before they eat your food. Stuff like that. However everything is randomly generated. You could go a decent section of map without finding any food. Oh, and I did I mention your tribe starts dying of starvation if you don't have enough food? Yeah that's a thing. There's also bonfires where you're meant to add to your tribe but it seems totally RNG whether or not you get them or they just kill your own people. It seems like a good concept.

其中每个地图的资源相对固定，就导致了所谓资源管理的目的只能通过控制人口或吃人的方式来达到。单程游戏想达到人口最大化通关，就算六指琴魔下凡也做不到。所以就出现了一刷再刷强行增加你游戏时间的窒息操作：

攒印记。先简述下印记的作用吧

红印记：增加人口。（每关卡通过祭献叠加红印记，雪地祭坛祭献大幅度增加，过关时红印层数就给你一个红印记。）
绿印记：获得人口数量的资源，人口越多收益越多。（完成与果子鹿犀牛的互动叠加绿印）
蓝印记：重置关卡。（与关卡中的部落结盟叠加蓝印）<好像点火吓走狮子也会，游戏已删懒得验证，欢迎补充>

火焰驱恶虎，火矛镇犀牛。（火把把它吓住，掏矛杀，需要至少二十个人）
计划生育好，生多且做肉。
吃肉不容易，遇蝇且珍惜。（沙雕苍蝇偷食物）
散开躲飞龙，点火死翘翘。
雪地要血祭，渡渡要围杀。
沃土最稳定，雨林果带毒。（一般带毒的附近都有尸体）

最后最后最最后：
祭司苟着来，死了亏大发。（经历点随存活时间增长而增加，生孩子祭祀都需要一点，新祭司要重新累计）

注：游戏内有排行榜，按照单程和大迁徙完成后的分数高低来排，分数就是最后人口和资源加成。（我个人对这种排行不感兴趣，而且修改党居多）


总体来说，这游戏休闲性不错，音乐不错，但就价格来说，偏高，看个人喜好入吧。

It is unlike any other game in the genre. You are the Shaman who must lead your people to a safe area before the sky fire destroys your village. Along the way, you are faced with many dangers. From wild animals, rivers, fire, insects,quicksand, and others things that will kill off your tribe if you do not lead them in the proper formations. There is no stopping during your march across the lands, you must march forward ordering your people to change formation to avoid danger & collect much-needed food till nightfall, or your people will die off fast.

Released in later August 2016 by a collaboration of developers, including Tribe Tea, Stas Shostak, Evgeniy Yudin, Alexzander Protasenya, and Ruslan Viter and published by Stas Shostak. It is tagged as a Difficult, Action, Adventure, Runner, Indie title. The game holds up to the difficult tag, it will take a little time to get used to the mechanics of the game. The gameplay is fairly simple, using just your mouse to control the tribe's formations and the 1 thru 5 keys to control actions for the tribe. The game does have controller settings in the launcher even though controller support is not listed for the game. There is also a Leaderboard; Do you have what it takes to make it to the top of the list?

I would recommend you start with the Tutorial and get the basics of gameplay learned before you start the Single Run. Once you have the basics down it is time to play your first game. You will have a choice of multiple routes to get to the new grounds that your people are to call their new home. Along with choosing to run at night or day, day runs cost you needed food, so choose wisely. There are various Tokens you can enable at the start of your second level to help give you a little advantage. There are multiple language settings: EN, RU, ZH, EU, ES, PT, FR, IT. So you are able to read the dialog in your native language. Once you beat the Single Run, you will unlock the Big Pass gameplay, which varies from the Single Run. For Big Pass, you work to move all the people from your village as fast as possible before they starve to death. The balance of your resources become very critical in this game style.

With well-done Pixel Graphics, great sound effects and unique gameplay, for the asking price it is a nice little indie title to add to one's library. There is a medium replayability for the title. Though the title really is not very long. With unlocking the second play style and multiple routes for both the game styles, these options will give you continued play for a while. For you achievement hunters, the game has 14 achievements with most of them unlocking during normal gameplay, you can 100% them fairly easily.

I had a rather hard start with the game myself. After about 30 minutes of trial and error, I got a good grasp on the gameplay and was able to beat the Single Run for my first time and unlock the Big Pass. It was very satisfying when I beat it for the first time. I am currently trying to finish the Big Pass, as promised the game is Difficult. But I will finish this title one way or another. I am having fun playing, even when I get annoyed at my misclicks from time to time. I may cuss and rage at times, but my goal is obtainable as I continue to get used to the flow of the game. My worse problem with the game is the night play, I am half blind, half deaf & half crazy :P and games with a lot of darkness give me a harder time playing them. Though it does not stop me in the least from playing my heart out still. I will stop gaming when they pry my cold dead fingers from the keyboard LoL.

Now is your time to decide. Can you lead your people to safety?

Você joga dividindo e unindo a tribo com estratégias, certificando de que você tenha comida suficiente em estoque e tentar evitar que o seu povo morra. 

A sua tribo vai ocupar o topo da tela e vai ""correr"" sem parar até chegar no final do nível, e você deve dividir e reagrupar a tribo estrategicamente com 5 ferramentas à sua disposição, evitando obstáculos e fome. 

Os comandos são bem simples, e o jogo tem um rápido tutorial.

Oh, well..
A nice indie one! :)
This game's premises are quite simple - you've got to collect food for your tribe (hence the original name of the game, simply entitled The Tribe, but that's another story) in order not to let it die, through the days.
With its nice retro graphics, you'll be able of course to make many actions to get your goal. You'll be required to kill enemies  in order to get food, but you'll also be able to pick up from the ground berries and such.
With the left mouse button, you'll split your tribe in half - the tactical elements are quite nice - and in other halves, in order to avoid obstacles (you'll have for instance to cross rivers in selected numbers) and prehistorical enemies, get some food, kill enemies and so on in a different way. With the right mouse button you'll be able, always in a runner environment, to reunite the tribe again.
As I was saying, the basic controls are linked to keyboard buttons and apart from hunting animals and grabbing resources you'll also be able to light torches to see through the night (endless runner from day to night of course xD) or even increase your fellow tribesmen (if you've got enough resources). Sometimes, it will also be needed to kill some of your characters in order not to have too many guys around you and save resources.
I really liked the graphics and the historical environment, and also the changes from night to day and the different challenges with torches and so on, lighting up around you or scaring enemies and such.
And I also liked a lot the user interface - the buttons you can press are clearly shown in the upper side of the screen, and since the game won't ever get too fast you'll always manage somehow to balance food, ""population"" and the actions you'll have to do.
The main issue of such a game of course relies in its replayability - being an indie title, it's not that long and when you have explored every part of the game (the environments, the enemies, your actions, the night/day system, the point system after each day etc.) you're basically done. There's nothing more, and you need to love ""endless"" games in order to fully enjoy this title.
Still, for some hours it's a solid indie game and it adds some new and nice things greatly blended in the game setting. The options may be limited, but it's worthy to explore them all and build some levels :)
I didn't see a lack of tactical elements, as someone pointed out. You've got to manage lots of resources, to keep eyes on your tribesmen dying, to choose between spears, hands or torches, to split up and reunite your tribe and to get through the night to the other side of the map.
It's not that easy, but it's somehow addicting for many hours. The lack of a proper plot and, more than all, real trophies and accomplishments to obtain of course is something that goes against this title - it's just endless, without a real ending or even bosses or such. But the developers themselves said that it was supposed to be as it is, and in my view it's a very nice title. Tactical, endless and runner :P
I forgot to say something about the soundtrack, which matches the prehistorical environment but it's not that great - probably, the 2€/$ for the OST and the artwork aren't greatly spent if you don't get them as a gift or in some bundles, since they include only few musical tracks (extremely short, 15 minutes in total or even less) and all the game artwork, which is good in-game but has little use outside of it.
I think that if you like survival games based on an endless and somehow ""tactical"" engine, this one is a great game. It's for sure worth a try even if you're not into this genre, since it's greatly made (ok, just some spelling errors I think, I played only in English) and everything (tutorial included) works perfectly, as the developers wanted Tribal Pass to be.
The lack of upgrades/bonuses too doesn't help for the replayability issue, but still it's worth it in my opinion. I think you'll like it, you just have to be prepared and read something about it since the game will offer you everything you're reading here (I hope) and in other players' way better reviews than mine. 
You won't find many surprises in the endless night/day levels but still there's plenty of options and everything works perfectly, I didn't find bugs of any sort. 
I read many early access reviews, but fortunately now (and when I played it) is fully available and so don't worry about anything - if you like these premises you'll be addicted for some hours, just give yourself half an hour to fully understand the mechanics.. and have fun :)

[i][b]Tribal Pass[/b][/i] «est un jeu de type ”runner” [strike]très difficile[/strike] basé sur la gestion de ressources et les intéractions avec l’environnement – en pleine course.» C'est ce que dit la description du magasin, et c'est tout à fait ça.
Cependant je vous rassure tout de suite, il n'est pas ""très difficile"". Bien sûr, au début on échoue encore et encore, mais on comprend vite la plupart des subtilités du jeu dans la première heure passée à y jouer.

Alors comment ça se passe ? C'est très simple. Notre tribu occupe le haut de l'écran et va parcourir le niveau sans s'arrêter, jusqu'à atteindre la fin dudit niveau. Nous, on va faire en sorte que la tribu passe avec succès les 5 niveaux consécutifs en lui faisant éviter les obstacles et la famine.

D'abord, il va constamment falloir diviser et regrouper la tribu pour éviter les prédateurs et les rivières, atteindre la nourriture, etc... Avec le clic droit, on divise la tribu. Si on clique une fois, on divise la tribu en 2 groupes. Si on reclique, celle-ci se divisera en 3. Puis en 4 si on clique encore, et ainsi de suite. Inversement, avec le clic gauche, on regroupe la tribu. Donc si elle est divisée en 6, un clic gauche la ramènera à 5 groupes. Il faudra cliquer 4 fois supplémentaires pour la réunir en un seul groupe. Voilà pour les mouvements.

Ensuite, tout en divisant et regroupant la tribu, il va falloir utiliser 5 ""outils"" à notre disposition. En mangeant, le chaman qui mène la tribu va gagner de l'expérience et rapidement débloquer ces outils. On commence de base avec la ""main"" qui servira à cueillir les fruits pour gagner de la nourriture. Puis viendra la lance, permettant de chasser/combattre. En troisième, la torche qui sert entre autre à éclairer la nuit (elle sert aussi à d'autres choses). En quatrième, on débloque le cannibalisme, c'est-à-dire tuer des membres de la tribu pour obtenir de la nourriture. Et enfin en cinquième et dernier, l'inverse, c'est-à-dire échanger de la nourriture pour aggrandir la tribu en pleine course. L'ordre à son importance car on ne peut accéder au cannibalisme (4) sans avoir d'abord débloqué la torche (3). Le déblocage se fait automatiquement. On séléctionne ces outils avec les touches ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", et ""5"". Chaque élément rencontré dans la course réagit différemment en fonction de ""l'outil"" qu'on utilise.
Ah oui, si le chaman meurt, un autre le remplace, mais son expérience revient à zéro et il faut à nouveau tout redébloquer (ce qui va très vite).

Au final, [i][b]Tribal Pass[/b][/i] est un petit jeu bien sympathique sur lequel on passe agréablement quelques heures. En me fixant comme objectif d'obtenir tous les succès, j'ai mis deux heures pour en faire le tour. Les fanas du score pourront y passer plus de temps et chercher à atteindre la tête du classement, mais pour les autres, le temps de jeu sera assez court. Mais sympa. Très sympa.

Al principio, este juego te podrá parecer super dificil, asi que yo aconsejo matar a tu tribu ahogandola o algo asi hasta que tengas menos de 8 monos, asi será mas facil que no se te mueran de hambre mientras que aprendes a cambiar de lanza a mano a antorcha y como dividir y juntar a tus monitos.

Los logros son faciles, yo los saque al 100% en 3 horas, el mas dificil era juntar 10 grupos de campamento, ya que necesitas algo de suerte a que te salgan los 10 grupos en una sola corrida sin usar tokens azules.

Pero una vez que acabas tu primera corrida, una nueva opcion en el menu sale donde podras empezar corridas con 1500 comidas y 40 monos, con esto, es facil correr para juntar grupos de campamentos y otros logros locos que hay.

Si esta en oferta, lo recomiendo para pasar el rato y sacarlo al 100% pero no es aca mega bueno para que lo tengas que comprar, esta.. ""bien"".

Tribal Pass - забавный раннер, где надо спасать свое племя от апокалипсиса в первобытном мире. Игра довольно незатейливая и простая в освоении, но крайне затягивающая, несмотря на свое однообразие: локации и препятствия на них типовые.

Сюжета особого нет, присутствует только ведущий мотив. Очень интересны некоторые особенности геймплея - такие как каннибализм, синдром Томми Версетти, разгром других племен. Реализация воистину вызывает улыбку. 

Графика в Tribal Pass невероятно пиксельно-красивая, отсутствуют раздражающие глаз цвета. Следует отметить простое и качественное звуковое оформление, а также забавные достижения.

En clair, Tribal Pass est un jeu dans lequel votre but est celui de, accompagné de votre tribut d'hommes préhistorique, traverser une map parsemée d'embuches, tels que des feux, des animaux passifs ou non, et surtout des ruisseaux. Le tout se joue particulièrement dans la rapidité des clics de souris, car le clic-gauche vous permet de rassembler vos hommes, tandis que le clic-droit vise à les disperser, étaler en de de plus petits groupes sur la largueur de la map, plus pratique pour récolter la nourriture ( trop importante ), et qui donc augmente le risque de subir des pertes humaines.

Is this a bad game? No.

Is it fun? Debatable.

I wish I could give this a neutral review, but I can't--hence I'm sticking to a positive one with some caveats. If you're like me, you should probably avoid this game.

https://youtu.be/8oMrfQeCbxw

Runs are procedurally generated and this does not work in your favour--especially since the title claims to be tactical. There's no strategy that can save you from not being able to find food; pften times, you won't find enough to feed your tribesmen and they'll die. Even after thinning out your numbers in order to provide for the remaining members, it's still near-impossible to maintain enough food.

You can switch between bare hands, holding spears or torches, increasing your tribe numbers if you have enough food to sustain them, and even sacrificing members in order to create more food in a pinch.

Your run ends once you reach the other end of the map. Time passes when you run, so the next map will be played during the night if you first ran during the day and vice versa. There's the option to wait out the night, but this will cost more food than you'll likely have.

Unfortunately, night time is fraught with dangers and increases your risk of going hungry. In order to see what's in front of you in the slightest, you need to hold torches. Torches scare off animals and burn berry bushes, which means acquiring food will be even more difficult still. If you don't hold torches, however, you'll easily run into obstacles and predators and your tribe will die.

I have yet to see the tactical aspects of this game. There is resource management, sure, but the procedural generation makes it so that stockpiling anything is nigh impossible. Predators and other tribes will kill you on site and herbavores will run off unless you spread out your formation to groups of only a few spear-toting tribesman. Changing formation is often stilted by the environmental hazards, so I found it difficult to hunt if only because I'd smash into something shortly thereafter and kill half of my tribe.

There are no upgrades at all--none that can be earned during your run nor ones that carry over and make subsequent runs easier. As such, the procedural generation will continue to screw you until you're too frustrated to bother.

The game is presented in pixel art, which I'm a fan of. I also like the prehistoric theme. The music is a constant loop of tribal beats and I muted it after the first few minutes.

.Pros.
[list][*]Interesting mechanics like sacrificing tribe members in a pinch.
[*]Environment responds to what you carry in your hands.
[*] The gritty pixel art is suitable.[/list]

.Cons.
[list][*]The music is on a constant loop.
[*]The game relies almost entirely on luck due to its random generation.
[*] Huge difficulty curve with no permanent upgrades to help ease you in.[/list]

.Bottom Line.

For the price, you can do better. Runners are meant to be challenging, but typically you can memorize obstacles or you're given upgrades to make it so that you get a little further each time. Tribal Pass does neither and so it just becomes an exercise of frustration.

Об игре я узнал, путём выпадения мне от Иисуса Христа купона с большой скидкой на эту игру. Посмотрев скриншоты, на моих подростковых глазках потекли слёзки, ведь я вспомнил замечательную игру, в которую сутками я играл на своей нокии будучи в 3-ем классе на переменах. Называлась она ""Первобытные войны"", там своё племя которое можно совершенствовать, выбирать вождя, трахать тёлок и ждать потомства и нападать на вражеские племена людоедов. Недолго думая, я купил эту игру и это оказалось, обычным экшеном, с простеньким геймплеей, в ней не имеется уникальности, таких игр полно, но назвать её плохой игрой, это означает назвать себя умственно отсталым! 
Видно, как разработчик до мелких деталей прорабатывал игру, как он всей душой своего организма рисовал каждый пиксель и вкладывал душу в создания ШАМАНА!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Приятный геймлпей, практически нету багов, но наврятле данная игра станет хитом в STEAM, она больше подходит под мобильные платформы. 

И ещё, после того как вы сожрали тонны печени своих братьев по племени, помолились духу Шамана, стоит рассказать об достижениях, значках и карточках и то, что от них выпадает. 
Значки идеальны, они красивые и сделаны с душой, не абы как, смайлики таких милых австралопитеков, которых так и хочется взять в рабство ми-ми-ми, ёпта! 
Спасибо разработчик, что сумел сделать игру и с душой и со всей ответственностью подошёл к делу. Я ставлю этой игре - положительную оценку и желаю чтобы мои кровные шейкели пошли на новоё твоё творение!

- split it or gather it to cover particular grounds
- equip it with lances, torches or bare hands
- grow the tribe (increasing its food consumption) or sacrifice tribesmen (to get food when you ran out)
And with this, you must deal with various dangers and bring as many tribesmen to the end of the level. Sounds easier than it actually is ;)

An advice for beginners: don't overgrow your tribe. Actually, I found that the easiest way to finish a level was to play with just a few tribesmen: this way at least you can hardly starve out.
But the more people you bring to the end, the higher your score, so eventually you'll have to put that into the balance if you want to score high.

My main criticism would be the lack of a detailed guide or tutorial. There is a tutorial, but it's far from covering everything, so you'll have to also learn from game tips that appear occasionally or from experience. For instance:

You not only run forward to reach your goal, but you have to take care of your tribesmen in order to survive harsh environment they live in. You need (more than anything) food to feed your tribe.
No food = your unstoppable army of prehistoric people starts to die pretty quickly. 
Food can be obtained, by setting up the right formation so you can pick berries from bushes, killing a moose or other tribes ... in worst case scenario, you can degrade yourself to cannibalism with hope that you will survive until next level. Harder it is due to obstacles in your way. Rivers, quick sand; flies that will eat your food; bloodthirsty sabertooth, extremely tough rhyno - both can be killed (apparently), but with them in my way I found only death of my people. Easy ...
And doing this when night settles in and the darkness cover the whole world ... easy peasy.

Game itself runs well, controls well, there is nothing wrong with it - something is wrong with me, obviously.

Technically is pretty alright game, nothing stands out really - negatively or positively - that would need special mention. 

Overall it is a nice, little, neat game, where you can get easily lost and kill couple hours, if it fits into your wheelhouse.
I encourage YOU to give this game a fair chance. It might surprise you.

La prise en main n’est pas compliquée non plus, vos personnages avancent automatiquement vers le bas de l’écran et vous pouvez les diviser en deux groupes (puis trois, puis quatre) d’un clic droit de souris ou au contraire les rassembler d’un clic gauche.

Au fil de votre avancée, le chaman (le chef) gagnera de la puissance et vous aurez accès à cinq compétences différentes : la main pour récolter la nourriture, les lances pour combattre, les torches pour se déplacer la nuit, la possibilité de sacrifier des personnes pour récupérer de la nourriture ou l’inverse pour augmenter la taille de votre tribu.

Il faut conduire le plus de personnes possible en lieu sûr, mais c’est extrêmement répétitif et il manque beaucoup de choses pour donner encore envie de jouer après une demi-heure.

The Tribe has some cool ideas in it and tries to take the runner genre in a cool direction but it has some major issues that have only been partially address since Early Access. I think it's worth $5 but only if you're into the specific twist it's offering.

The basics are that you're a tribal leader who is trying to lead your gaggle of cavemen to a mountain on the other side of the world. You have to go through a number of levels to get there, each of which is randomly generated and can be made up of several environment types with different risks and benefits. The randomness of the level generation can sometimes be very unfair but that's the nature of the beast. Your tribe is always running and you can spread them out to various different pre-determined positions and retract them using the mouse buttons. You have to acquire food and grow your tribe as you go but the more tribesmen you have, the more food you burn. However, the more tribesmen you have, the more dangerous creatures and situations you can handle.

You have several abilities you can trigger and retract using the number keys. You have spears which have to be out to hunt animal food but will destroy fruit and scare the animals away if you have them out when on the same row as them. You also have fire which you'll need to scare some bigger creatures away and light the way at night, which you'll sometimes have to run through if you don't have enough food. You can also spend some of your food reserves to grow your tribe or cannibalise some tribesmen to get some emergency food. Yep, there's cannibalism in this game. You'll also encounter other small tribes and if you're big enough, you can recruit them or kill them for food as well.

Unfortunately, you're never really told how many tribesmen are needed to deal with the various threats you'll come across. This requires a lot of frustrating trial and error and will cost you many runs as you try to figure it out. The patterns your tribesmen take with different mouse clicks is also not made clear and this also takes a lot of practice and memorisation. Beyond this, not much needs to be explained to you, which is good because what English is in The Tribe is very poorly translated and some of it just makes no sense. There were larger, largely text based encounters that took place in between missions in Early Access that have been removed, I assume partially because of these translation difficulties.

The music and sound effects are fitting of the era being depicted in The Tribe. I originally didn't like the art style but it grew on me with time and I think that will come down to personal taste. The game runs fine, though its leaderboard implementation is not especially great.

For $5, I do still recommend The Tribe, even with its faults. It's a good take on the runner genre with a unique setting and mechanics to match. If you don't like runner games and learning and adapting on your feet, this probably won't be for you. But if you like a challenge and something that rewards quick reflexes, definitely give it a shot.",1475637443,1475637443,True,4,0,0.578077077865600586,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Cuantos más hombres más comida consumirán, en ocasiones siendo necesario sacrificar a unos cuantos en pro de la tribu.
Los reflejos y la anticipación dada por el scroll serán predominantes para dominar el juego.

De una forma jugable tendremos que tener una concentración o previa anticipación entre todos los elementos que salen nuevos por el scroll, y por medio de 5 habilidades y distintos tipos de formación divisoria, decidir la mejor manera de actuar.
Entre los elementos que aparecen en el camino podemos contar con los que nos dan y quitan comida y los que nos matan o nos dan hombres. Forman un cuadrado sin embargo solamente existirá un elemento diferente para dos de sus puntos, y varios elementos para sus otros dos.
Entre las habilidades contaremos con tres de utilidad: recolección, caza y antorchas para afrontar el cuadrado, y dos avanzadas: sacrificios y hacer crecer a la tribu por medio de alimentos, sirviendo estas dos últimas de conexión directa hacia su planteamiento básico.
Se cuenta como aliciente un chamán que lidera a la tribu y que mientras viva adquirirá experiencia para obtener bonificadores entre etapas o corridas. Si el chamán muere otro ocupará su lugar con nivel 0.

Como mayor cualidad y en primer lugar veremos, una afrontación distinta manejada por las teclas 1-5, esta será según los elementos que aparezcan. En segundo lugar por medio de los botones derecho e izquierdo del ratón, una unión y separación de formaciones hasta un maximo creo que de diez líneas o grupos; entre estos dos factores y cualidades conseguirán una jugabilidad interesantisima.

En general su sistema de juego es muy reducido, rústico y poco desarrollado para el tiempo real y el scroll que le va a tocar soportar, así que suspenso sin dudar.

分享一下自己摸索出来的一点小技巧：
①关于人数，我前四图人数控制在21-25，为什么呢？因为要杀一只犀牛需要20支矛，萨满不会战斗所以需要21人，而21人正好分两队可以赶跑野兽、可以打败别的部落、可以全图捕猎不惊动鹿群、粮食消耗最少而且容易操控（这21人我可以跑四张图不死一个）所以我一直都是用21-25，缺点在于杀犀牛需要一定的时机和技术。刚一点的打法是41人，41人基本就是全场清的打法，见牛秒牛，见鸟秒鸟，不然粮食跟不上，经常会有牺牲所以还要常补人。再多人我就不推荐了，粮食铁定跟不上。
②关于地图，尽量避开沙漠图，这张图不是一般地恶心，我有一次除了吃别的部落全图没有其他粮食，而且还有那迷之判定的渡渡鸟，有时真的躲不开。今晚冲分的时候，我一看地图路线避不开沙漠图的直接就重开了。跑别的图我21人能增加至少100粮食，跑沙漠图我至少要掉100。沃土是首选，相对平稳简单粮食也多。雨林的苍蝇比较恶心，有时苍蝇跟粮食在一起的时候就不推荐去捕猎采购了，但是雨林的粮食真的多，有好几波果实和鹿群在一起的情况，我一般是优先掏矛捕鹿。冻原上的犀牛比较多，先确保自己的人数足够杀它，然后那个遗迹我真不知道有什么作用。
③关于印记，你用火驱赶野兽和苍蝇会得到蓝色印记，献祭会得到红色印记，采果实会有绿色印记，推荐红色和绿色配套使用，先招募人，然后采食。蓝色的留一两个以防不备之需就行了。
④关于地图各种东西的应对方法 。犀牛是点火它就不动了，这时可以捕杀，需要足够的人数才打得过（上面有提到）。野兽会吃人，比起避开我更推荐点火走在它面前，它会逃跑，但是注意不要碰到它，逃跑时也会吃人。苍蝇最优先处理，点火赶走，粮食是迁陡的本钱，碰到苍蝇一次要被啃掉50，伤不起。毒果实旁边有尸体可以分辨，用火或矛都可以，鹿在毒果旁边的时候不要怂，操起矛就是肛。别的部落的话，小部落是5人，大部落是10人，空手或点火的时候，你撞到他们的小分队如果人数小于等于他们，会被吃掉，大于他们会加入你的队伍。你拿矛的时候就是开战了，你的小分队人数小于等于他们的时候会输，大于的时候就赢了。关于渡渡鸟，这是很迷的动物，捕杀方法是它们竖着冲上去的时候拿矛右键左右散开击杀，但是你根本就不知道它们什么时候会冲锋，而且大多数时候杀掉了，你人也死光了。至于飞天的那啥翼来着，听到声音看见阴影的时候千万不要慌，第一件事：按1、2关火，第二件事：狂按右键，第三件事，等它飞走后狂按左键。如果发现散开后被野兽吃掉几人也无所谓了。
PS：关于一个特别恶心的情况，大多数人都碰过的。当你分好纵列要过桥的时候。。。。天上传来了鸟声。。。。EXO ME???散开就是跳河死，不散开就是被那啥翼弄死。横竖都是死，我基本上都是在这里团灭的，只有蓝色印记能够拯救我了。
⑤  关于夜♂战，除非做成就，不然肯定要点火（人越多火越亮）。但是也不是一直点着，我推荐戴耳机听声音，赶路的时候要点火（特别是河流沙流）。点火的时候看画面最下方会有什么东西出来，有粮食迅速切换12捕猎后立刻按3点火。每做完一件事要立刻点个火看情况，再切换12干下一件事。犀牛要靠听声音，有专属的很大声的脚步声，听到声音后迅速关火，在半暗的画面中确认犀牛位置，点火，击杀。切记不要让萨满死了，新的萨满出点火技能的那段时间里够你死几次了。
⑥关于冲单程分，我的套路是上来50人，有献祭后果断献祭到25人（之后一直把人数控制在21-25），第一关粮食多敌人少，21人耗粮少，全场清第一关结束有个200多甚至300的粮食，前四关的任务就是储粮。第一关结束后地图出现，规划好路线，发现不能避开沙漠图的话就右下返回菜单重开吧，那图真心恶心储不了粮。印记的话把红色跟绿色的留到最后一张图，蓝色的留一两个防备过桥出飞鸟的情况。多夜战节约粮食，夜战并不难。 我262分那把前四张图打完有600多粮食，运气成分也很重要。第四张图后面就可以开始招人了，不推荐用5键加人，耗费粮食量太大了。看到部落就举火或空手去撞他们，用别的部落强大自己。第四张图结束就把红色印记全用了，加个10几人， 再用绿色印记，加100多粮食。最后一张图就把重点放在招人上了，一个部落都不能放过。当然粮食采集也不能落下，到最后发现人还是太少了就疯狂5键，加到七八九十人就够了，此时粮食也差不多了。这样打100多分不成问题，上两百就有点运气成分了。 
明天研究一下大迁陡的套路，都冲上第一后就不玩了，等着你们开发新套路来超我哦(≧▽≦)

——————————————————————————————————————————
——————————————————————————————————————————
现在是玩这游戏的第二天
大迁陡也上第一了\^O^/
分享一下大迁陡的套路：
迁陡的次数越多，分数的提升空间越大，所以最好把50天都利用起来，也就是打10次迁陡。
那么首先要确保原居住地人口不饿死，所以前20天我都是带80人 ，80多粮食出去。这样原居住地的人口会减少很多，而粮食相对充沛。
80人带出去后，80粮食可以保证出捕猎技能，然后捕猎采果撑到献祭后疯狂按4，把人数降到21-25，之后就是我上面冲单程分的套路了，把粮食和人尽可能多

地带到新居住地。
运气好的话一次迁陡能带500多粮食60多人。
有20天后，原居住地的人数已经减少下来了，那么就可以少带点人保证自己可以一直打到最后一天，粮食依旧少带点。
无论带了多少人，按4把人数控制在21-25，重复以上套路。
我打了10波，失误了有4、5波，都是在最后一张图的最后阶段大误伤，来不及自杀用蓝色标记就过关了，导致带出来的粮食和人都不多。
即使如此，还是刷了1100多分。如果想多试几遍的话肛到1700多分也是可以的，不过我就这样止步了，欢迎其他玩家来超（cao）我哦(≧▽≦)",1474655936,1474691375,True,42,4,0.816439330577850342,4,True,False,False,False,,,

1. 사람들을 목적지까지 도달하기.
1-1. 사람들을 마우스 좌, 우로 클릭하여 분배하거나, 다시 합쳐야합니다.
1-2. 동물들을 사냥합니다.
1-2-1. 동물들은 식량을 공급해 줍니다. 하지만, 동물들 앞을 그냥 지나갈경우 동물들은 그대로 도망쳐 버립니다.
1-2-2. 키보드2번을 선택해서 창을 설정한뒤에 사람들을 넓게 펼쳤다가 좁히면서 동물을 사냥합니다. 약 35? 25?정도의 식량을 얻을 수 있음
1-3. 사람들은 이동하면서 식량을 소비합니다. 대략 2? 3?
1-3-1. 식량이 부족하면 사람의 수를 줄여서 식량으로 만듭니다. 자세히 기억나지 않지만 사람수를 줄인만큼 일정한 양의 식량이 주어집니다. (이것이 키보드 4번키)
1-3-2. 식량이 많다면 사람을 늘리는것도 좋은 방법니다. (이것이 키보드 5번키) 
1-4. 가끔 부족이 캠프파이어하면서 모여있는곳이 있는데, 이곳은  확실하지 않지만사람이 적을경우 아군의 사람들이 잡혀 죽는것이 아니면 확률적으로 동료가 되는것 같습니다.
1-5.가끔 위험한 호랑이도 존재, 다리를 건너야 하는데, 사람을 제대로 펼치지 않으면 물에 빠져 죽습니다. 또한 벌도 있으니까 주의해야 하며, 거대한 익룡이 날아올때 피하지않으면 당신의 부족민들은 많은 피해를 입습니다.
1-6. 이 모든 장애물과 적당한 식량분배및 부족민들을 늘리고나 줄여가며 한뒤에마지막까지 도달 하십시요.
cf) 참고로 어둠도 존재합니다. 키보드 3번으로 횃불을 켤수 있으며 이때는 창을 사용할수 없습니다. 다시 창을 들면 주위가 어두어지니 주의해 주세요

[h1]The Tribe[/h1]
[b]is[/b] such a wonderful Hardcore-like Indie Game with Pixel Graphics! It starts off with the shaman that tells the tribe what they can and cannot do! You as the shaman control that as you explore the BC world. With only you and the tribe running towards the end of the level. The Controls are quite simple, hotkeys for actions (spears, torches) and left n right mouse clicks for group separation.

This game can be very hard and requires some time and skill in order to reach ""The End"".

[i]I would recommend checking out my review and my Serio Plays for more helpful review[/i]

[h1]Pros, Cons & Neutral![/h1]
[b]Pros: [/b]
• No FPS Lock 142 FPS+ tested
• Simple Resolution options 1080p!
• Pixel Graphics
• Cheap Price
• Developers are very nice and can sometimes can be active
• Nice Gameplay
• Good Sounds and Music

[b]Neutral: [/b]
• it's another Runner - Unless you like them

[b]Cons: [/b]
• No Borderless Window support
• Windowed Mode Fixed/Can't go higher than 1600 x 900 (no 1080p window mode)
• Sometimes the game can feel very unbalanced however the developers will listen to feedback
• No in-game options menu for controls (you can find in the launcher)
• No Adjustable Volume in-game (Simple On-Off)
• Gameplay quickly gets repetitive and boring
• No Blood Option

[h1]FPS LOCK?[/h1]
Nope, it's got no lock so you can play it at any refresh rate. Checked using Steam's FPS Counter.

[h1]Running Out of Food[/h1]
I don't know anything about balance but I felt like the food system is unbalanced. Most of the time I die because of lack of food on my screen. Deers, Dodo Birds etc. If you guys could increase the chances of finding some animals, bushes that would be nice. Yes it's hardcore like game but at least make it fair first. Without making the game too easy of course.

[h1]Steamified?[/h1]
Achievements, Trading Cards and it's even got Leaderboard! So Yes it's Steamified

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I would say that if you love yourself some cavemen, shaman and a bunch of trying to avoid the rhinos. Then yes I would recommend this game. But if you're looking for good bargain for your money I would look else where, unless you absolutely love runners (even though they have been done 2 death, a lot of them are free flash games)

В этой игре невозможно остановиться и одновременно с этим нужно принимать решения, решения, решения. Ощущение, что у тебя вечный ""зерлинг раш"".

Тебе уготовлена роль шамана, который отвечает за целое племя. Дабы твои люди не погибли, их нужно отвести на новую ""землю обетованную"". Обо всем тебе расскажут наскально нацарапанным шрифтом. А сам текст похож на древнюю шаманскую песню, где сплетается фольклорная тягучесть и метафоричность. На протяжении всей игры необходимо бежать - вперед, к цели, по дороге собирая еду, охотясь на вкусняшки либо людоедствуя по чуть-чуть с голодухи.

Во время бега придется постоянно принимать какие-то решения. Каждое решение - простое, даже примитивное: вооружиться, разделить племя на маленькие группы, собрать в один боевой кулак, чтобы напасть на доисторического носорога. Но поток задач не прекращается, а ресурсы истощаются практически моментально, и твои люди начинают умирать, как мухи. И все это набегу, и все горит, и ты в аду...ну первые несколько забегов именно так и ощущаются.

Остановиться можно лишь там, где позволят разработчики. А они решили: отдыхать племени положено только ночью, и то только если хватит еды на ночлежку. На исходе каждого дня наступает передышка. Игрок может выбрать: продолжать ли путь ночью, когда число опасностей еще больше, или дождаться утра. Ну а если утром еды не хватит, можно позавтракать соплеменниками.

Помимо того что The ##Tribe поднимает уровень адреналина в крови, она еще и ублажает тягу к прекрасному в самых разных проявлениях. Так, невозможно пройти мимо графики. Она проста, но продумана до мелочей. Пиксель арт - он бывает разный, но в этой игре, он чертовски помогает погрузиться в атмосферу.  Ахх, да... и озвучка, ее надо было бы послушать.

Настоящая благодать посетит вас после прохождения игры. Когда беговая горячка закончится, а подопечные ступят на безопасную и плодородную землю, ты ощутишь себя истинным шаманом. Тебе удалось спасти людей и дать им шанс на новую жизнь в раю, ну и что, что довел ты только 70 из 500.

Glücklicherweise erahnt der Schamane des Stamms diese Katastrophe und nun ist es unsere Aufgabe den Stamm in ein sicheres Land zu bringen.

Hierbei muss man verschiedene Gebiete durchqueren, zum Beispiel fruchtbares Land, Schneegebiete und Wüsten. Je nachdem welchen Pfad man wählt (man hat nämlich immer nach der ersten Mission die Wahl zwischen zwei Gebieten), existieren dort auf dem Weg mehr oder weniger Nahrung und Gefahren. Nahrung ist notwendig um den Stamm am Leben zu halten, weil sobald Nahrung auf 0 gefallen ist sterben die Stammesmitglieder wie die Fliegen. Aber auch mehrere Gefahren töten unsere Steinzeitmännchen in Sekundenbruchteilen. Zum Beispiel sollten wir nicht mit einem großen Rhino kuscheln, auch feindliche Stämme lassen sich nur friedlich überzeugen (oder für Nahrung abschlachten *mwhahahaha*), falls wir in der Überzahl sind. Ein Gebiet wird immer von oben nach unten statisch durchgelaufen und man kann die Bewaffnung der Truppen, sowie deren Aufteilung auf der horizontalen Achse wechseln. Hier ist sehr viel Geschick gefragt, da der Stamm mit Speeren in der Hand zwar Wild erlegen kann, aber Beerenbüsche zerstören würde. Für das Sammeln von Beeren müssen die Hände frei sein. Falls es mit der Nahrung absolut schlecht aussieht, kann man immer noch zur Not Kanibalismus betreiben und einige Stammesangehörige opfern. Hat man sehr viel Nahrung kann man auch den Stamm wieder vergrößern, was aber auch den ständigen Nahrungsverbrauch wieder ankurbelt.

Eine besondere Herausforderung ist noch die Nacht. In dieser sieht man eigentlich nichts mehr von seinem Weg, außer man rüstet Fackeln aus, aber dann kann man gleichzeitig nicht jagen und verbrennt Beerenbüsche. Einige Gefahren wie Säbelzahntiger lassen sich jedoch durch Feuer auch vertreiben.

Falls man das erste Mal es bis zu dem sicheren Land durch geschafft hat, wird ein zusätzlicher Spielmodus freigeschaltet in dem man den kompletten Stamm in Sicherheit bringen muss (500 Leute).

Also wer auf Spiele steht in dem sein Reaktionsvermögen gefragt ist und auch das Steinzeitszenario mag, der wird hiermit ein nettes kleines Spiel für nebenbei haben.

steam优惠卷买的，具体多少忘了，应该是3块以内，我这么抠，+1游戏一般都是要便宜才会去买的！

这其实是个披着策略外衣的动作游戏（如果预判不好，可以用看你的鼠标点的多快来弥补）。机制很简单，一看就会，虽然没中文，但是并不需要什么英文能力。而且游戏难易适中，教程也快速而又到位。音乐抖腿。。。。

游戏特色：
首先这个游戏，你扮演的是个领袖，钦定的那种~~而且你问全部落支持不支持，他们都是支持的。即使这任领袖死了，下任领袖也是电脑经过基本法选举出来的。绝对E克赛艇！棒呱呱~~~

其次游戏非常重口味！！！作为hentai，我很喜欢！！！原始人么，狩猎别的部族来补充食物什么的是常有的事情，实在饿晕了自己部落里的人也能变食物。残酷，真实，画面又莫名的喜感。

再次游戏流程设计的很好，通关流程就4-5张地图，怎么走，走什么地形看你自己的选择，刚刚上手会很容易死，但是又不由自主的再来一把，很魔性。等通关以后，又会出个大迁徙的50天版本，就是50张地图。让喜欢挑战的人感受一下。可以在全球榜上查自己的排名。

This is a extension of my ending thoughts on my first look of this game.
I have played it now for around 2-3h and it has grown a bit on me. 
The game is a mix of a runner and managment games in the sense you need to avoid certain parts of the map while harvesting/killing other parts, the managment part is to make sure that your tribe does not grow to big for your food supplies or grow to small as to not be able to survive certain tribulations or get a low score.

If you enjoy runner games I would recommend the game at full price but if you are a bit on the edge I would say wait for a sale and the game might even be better by then since it's early access at the point of this review.

[h1]What is The Tribe?[/h1]

The Tribe is what the developers describe as a 'tactical hardcore runner' comprised of resource management and environment interactions. Players guide their tribes throughout each run with the primary objective of getting your shaman through to the end of each run. If the shaman dies then it is game over. In order to accomplish this mammoth task, players can separate and unite their tribe with a single press of the left and right mouse button. The game is played entirely with the mouse. Consequently, I suggest that the gameplay is relatively simple to learn and accessible to everyone.

[h1]Rewarding Experiences[/h1]

I know that there has been quite a lot of people play the game. However, as of writing, I am ranked 42nd in single run leaders and 37th in big pass leaders. Getting through to the end of a single run is mighty hard work. However, the longer that you are able to survive the greater the reward legitimately feels. Consequently, having any sort of success should be considered an achievement. I recommend that players who are experienced at both strategy and runner style games would find something that they would appreciate here.

[h1]Graphics & Sound[/h1]

One of the highlights to date are the pixelated graphics. They help provide the game with a retro feel. However, the gameplay feels new enough that in playing the game I am never given a 'been there, done that' type feeling. The originality in the game is quite striking. For being as simplistic as they look the animations are quite well done. The game is relatively easy on the eyes and is the basis of a number of good game design decisions.

I am also a fan of the sound that is featured within the game. The tribal music matches the theme and the atmosphere of the game perfectly. The other sounds are basic and again retro in style but they accomplish what the developers have set out to do.

[h1]Starvation[/h1]

The only problem that I have in the game is that of starvation. Runs can be doomed from the beginning and through absolutely no fault of your own. If you are not presented with food early enough in the run your tribesmen will starve to death. This happens too regularly for my liking. I had several runs in succession where food did not generate on the screen until after everyone had died. It isn't a case of not seeing an event generate but a case of it never generating. It seems like it's all a little bit of pot luck at times. Hopefully this changes throughout its further development.

[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]

There are 7 trading cards to collect as well as 11 Steam achievements to unlock. The game also incorporates the Steam Leaderboard system into its mechanics. This most certainly makes the game Steamified.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I recently read a discussion on Reddit's /r/games about people finding it difficult to differentiate between a game being a bad title and a player simply not enjoying a game. This is a statement that I agree with to a certain extent. To be perfectly honest as much as I enjoyed certain aspects of The Tribe it isn't necessarily my cup of tea. However, to claim that it is a bad game would be entirely incorrect. It is a very solidly developed title to date. I am certain that its target audience would thoroughly enjoy it. In fact, I look forward to revisiting the game throughout its development. I'd like it to be an Early Access success. I think it deserves to be.

First - we are traveling using group of primitive men on the basis of four lines and combine them or separate them. We need to avoid traps, get food, try to stay alive with our group. Thius idea isn't bad, but some maps are so drawn by the game system, that there is no option to win. We have to lose due to f$%$% up RNG system.
Often, the game does not respond to the keys fast enough, causing tons of irritation when we play at night and we have to react to approaching things very quickly. Another time, the levels are bad designed/randomized, so we must lose at all or lose most of our men.
The game is difficult, this is fact and a challenge, but RNG causes peals of irritation when we lose... Why? Because we have to lose. We must lose. Not because we did something wrong.",1470668646,1470668646,False,11,2,0.331090062856674194,2,False,False,True,False,,,

And decent music, though it's a bit repetetive.  With a simple gameplay premise of a runner, a genre done to death and free to play on any modern phone.  It definately all works well, but if it does then why am I not reccomending this?

Well plain and simple; balancing.  ""What do you mean?"" I hear you asking!  Well I start a new game, and within at most ten seconds my whole tribe is already starving with no option of food, the first chance I get is CANABALISM.  And I have to wait for that due to a recent update, so I starve to resort to canabalism, then I am given a level lower than required to canabalise again, then guess what?  IM ALREADY STARVING AGAIN!  You can literally start a game and die before you can get any food (other than canabalising).  And for that reason I feel like it's not a ""tactical"" game (as the store page describes it) but more of a rouge-lite get lucky or die trying game.

Now this issue is easy to get around.  And I'll say multiple ways for it to be remedied.
1. Make the abillity to eat someone, available from the start.
2. Start the Shaman at a higher level so everythings available untill you die.
3. Allow saves / multiple saves.  This might make it less ""hardcore"" but really this can fix it in a way, you only have to get lucky once then you can start from there whenever.  Multiple saves in general is just an improvement.

Something that's absolutely unacceptable though is the lack of ANY options.  Unless you count muting or unmuting ALL SOUNDS or swapping between English and Russian.  Seriously, no in game sliders, or a selection between music and sound effects.  No capping framerates, or rather uncapping them, no resolution, no windowed select.  NOTHING. 

There's also the problem of it getting repetitive, really really quickly, but that's more of a genre problem; after all there's only so many ways you can make us split.

For five dollars though it's such a little expense, what I am worried about is for when it raises price.  ""Yes, the game's price will rise once the game is complete.""

Основной геймплей состоит из небольших забегов по доисторическим джунглям-саваннам.
Но нужно не просто удачно бежать (вместо прыжков, тут  - разделиться/объединиться). 
Попутно придётся использовать разные умения - собирать еду, охотиться, поджигать. Опасности подстерегают племя на пути. Это реки, зыбучие пески, львы,  носороги, и даже летающих кожекрыл. При этом нужно беречь шамана, так как от его опыта зависят умения племени. Утонул шаман /съеден зверями/ погиб в бою с чужим племенем - старые умения потерялись - беги в полутьме и подбирай фрукты, никакого мяса на ужин.
При этом у племени есть запасы еды, за которыми надо следить. Мало еды - люди умирают. Много еды - появляются новые люди. 
Но  и это ещё не все :)
В перерывах между этими походами-забегами нас ждут маленькие истории-квесты, рассказывающие историю племени. Придётся принимать решения и не всегда верные.
По графике и звукам/музыке - всё великолепно. Качественный душевный пиксель-арт, музыка, которую не хочется отключить через пару минут - всё работает на атмосферу.

Тогда как вам идея сыграть в игру, где все решения нужно принимать на бегу: не только где пройти, но и как пройти. И добавьте ко всему этому прекрасную текстовую стилизацию и квесты. Понравилось? Тогда вы на правильной странице.

""Племя"" - это игра, которая переносит игрока на многие тысячи лет назад, когда ̶н̶е̶ ̶н̶у̶ж̶н̶о̶ ̶б̶ы̶л̶о̶ ̶х̶о̶д̶и̶т̶ь̶ ̶в̶ ̶ш̶к̶о̶л̶у̶ ̶и̶ ̶п̶и̶т̶ь̶ ̶м̶о̶л̶о̶к̶о̶ ̶с̶ ̶п̶е̶н̶к̶о̶й̶ ̶  человека никак нельзя было назвать ""царём природы"". Под вашим контролем оказывается доисторическое племя, ведомое шаманом. Остальные - добытчики и охотники (а в некоторых случаях - еда для остальных).

Геймплей состоит в правильной расстановке людей по ходу движения посредством деления группы на равные части правой кнопкой мыши, и соединении обратно левой кнопкой соотвественно. Во время перехода необходимо следить за количеством еды, которая восполняется собирательством (ягоды), охотой (в основном травоядные животные) или же канибализмом (тут без описания).
Так же на игру влияет то, что у вас в руках: руки - собираем ягоды или берём с собой костровых (при наличии спец жетона), копья - убиваем костровых или охотимся, факела - освещаем дорогу ночью. Еще две кнопки позволяют принести кого-то в жертву, дабы накормить других, или же призвать ещё людей, если еды более чем достаточно.

Время между переходами в большинстве случаем занимают квесты, которые генерируются случайно. В них вам рассказывают какую-то историю о том, что случилось с племенем или с чем оно встретилось в пути. Есть варианты ответа со своими последствиями.

+ красивая пиксельная графика
+ не побоюсь этого слова ""потрясающая"" текстовая стилистика речи доисторических людей и стиль повествования
+ игра держит вас в постоянном напряжении, заставляя принимать множество решений
+ аутентичный саунд
+ квесты

- не нашел никакой информации об жетонах - они даются шаману за уровень?
- в пустыне всё как-то слишком однообразно выглядит, из-за чего только после смерти племени понял, что оно утонуло в оранжевой воде
- при проходе племени по мосту некоторые люди идут практически по воде, можно как-то визуально сжать людей в колонны, дабы такого не было?

Так же в некоторых разных локациях одинаковый животный и растительный мир, но разработчик указывает на это сам и уверяет, что это будет исправлено в следующих обновлениях.

В итоге - отличная игра в стандартном жанре с очень нестандартной реализацей и сюжетом. Случайные квесты так же вносят разнообразие. Однако как по мне, не хватает хотя бы краткого описания мира - в обучении ничего не сказано про бизонов, львов, птеродактиля и место для жертвоприношений (?).

The game is full of funny details and challenging mechanics, which it won't spoonfeed to you in order not to spoil your pleasure of figuring out yourself how to eat, hunt, fight, avoid traps etc.

About gameplay.
It's definitely a runner of new kind, without turns and jumps but with a game in positioning parts of a tribe. It's better to have a fast mind and fast hands to success in the game. Core gameplay is build around positioning of groups of people around the map and picking right tools in a right moment. You should be ready to be a hard hearted person. It is necessary to sacrifice a part of the tribe in a right moment in order to survive. But you always can invite new people to joint the tribe as soon as you have enough food.

Музыка: Шаман знает толк в музыке)

Игра: Для начала вы можете пройти обучающий забег, в котором подробно расказано и показано как играть и что нужно делать. И потом понеслась. Шамаи берет свою банду и попер, на всех парусах, при этом вся банда по дороге опустошает кусты, валит на мясо лосей, и кортит собой львов. Естественно вам нужно сохранить как можно больше жизней, а еще лучше увеличить свою банду, привлекая других членов с помощью еды. Игру можно назвать ренером, только бежать мы будем не справа на лево, или с низу вверх, а по первобытному с верху вниз, как шаман сказал, так и будет.

А между забегами нам предложат текстовый квест.

Bu sırada devamlı hareket halindeyiz ve önümüze vahşi yaratıklar, engeller, köprüler ve av hayvanları çıkıyor. Bu av hayvanlarından besin elde etmek şart, aksi takdirde yavaş yavaş kabiledekiler ölmeye başlıyor. Besin bitmesini engellemek için zaman zaman kabiledekileri feda etmek de gerekiyor.
