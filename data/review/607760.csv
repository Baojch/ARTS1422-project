However the project seems a little abandoned. What I mean is, there is one level with a single bossfight, you press continue & you're warped back to the homescreen. 

 I've seen other content displayed in this game than what I have experienced through reviewers & through mild-investigation I found there was a beta build of this game, and perhaps that is where those other levels come from, not entirely sure. 

The game in its current state & no hope for further development makes this game a hard recommend for $11.99. Especially when I beat the game twice & I've only clocked in about a half hour.  I should have heeded the red flag of this game being in early access since 2017. Steer clear of this game.",1593746890,1593746890,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I really like this game.  At first, I wasn't sure about it since I don't like the default control scheme but once I changed it to a config that I like (basically how most FPS controls normally are), I liked it a lot. Very impressive game from the few levels I've seen. I would absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE to see more content to ADD to this in the future. I'm perfectly fine with supporting paid DLC. This brings me back to the Atari days when I was a kid. I have over 130 VR games between Oculus, Vive and Oculus Go and this is right up there with the top experiences/games I've played. Perhaps maybe using another method for the shield disruptor? It's not easy in the heat of battle, to line it up. Aside from that, no issues. Played on Oculus with zero problems. 

This game SCREAMS Tron! Trust me, that's a good thing.  Paid $5.00 and its worth the full $10 even if it wasn't on sale IMO. Great Job Dev(s).  A+",1529880736,1529891638,True,4,0,0,2,True,False,True,False,,,

No teleporting. This seems to be a hard feature to find actually.
It feels like an indie game, but its cheap and not just a 5min tech demo, dead multiplayer arena, or empty open world.

I wish the shield was a bit bigger.
The enemies are mostly hovering spheres, triangles, etc  which is somewhat less interesting than in other games.
Soundtrack is fitting.

To turn in game pull the trigger for forward movement and tilt the controller in the direction you wish to turn to, strafing and reversing are also possible. I hope this helps but if you have any further issues please contact me. Thanks.

Hallo Akira, von der Verwendung einer Google-Übersetzung Ich denke, du hast nicht verstanden, wie die Bewegungssteuerung im Spiel funktioniert, da sie keine Sprachübersetzungen zur Zeit verfügbar sind. Um das Spiel zu drehen, ziehen Sie den Auslöser für die Vorwärtsbewegung und kippen Sie den Regler in die Richtung, in die Sie sich wenden möchten, Straf- und Reversieren sind ebenfalls möglich. Ich hoffe das hilft, aber wenn Sie weitere Fragen haben, kontaktieren Sie mich bitte. Vielen Dank."

PROS
- impressive world/environment (especially if you like Tron aesthetics) !
- music is perfect !
- love the free motion control with the trigger (i/o thumbpad) !!
- love the look of the gun
- wonderful dimensional gameplay!

CONS   (it's early access so there's room for improvement)
some ideas to improve:
-  lasers from the player's gun are a bit disappointing, could be better I think
-  sound effects could be better maybe
-  explosions could be improved I think 

Looking forward to future updates!!

《数码浪客》是一款复古风格的射击VR游戏，游戏中玩家将进入到未来科幻风格的世界中，由于所有的人工智能都已经陷入疯狂失控，玩家需要击毁这些失控的AI并且恢复秩序。

游戏的画风非常独特，类似科幻电影《创世纪》那种未来风格，但是画面偏暗，加上刺眼的荧光色彩，长时间游戏下来容易产生不适。游戏的玩法和其他射击类游戏一样，不断在场景中移动并击毁看到的失控智能机械。

游戏的移动方式采用手柄扣动扳机加体感的方式，实际移动过程中很容易产生眩晕感。游戏售价36元，游戏的可玩性一般，仅仅只是独特的科幻画风吸引眼球，建议玩家谨慎购买。",1494810370,1512981047,True,0,0,0.485576927661895752,0,True,False,True,False,,,
