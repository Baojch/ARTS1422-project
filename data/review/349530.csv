This is NOT a fully fledged cricket simulator. This is the Zynga of sports games. That's not a bad thing. It replicates table top cricket with plenty of detail, more than enough of a learning curve to provide a challenge... right off the bat.

Graphics are fine, they represent this table sized world with generous detail and colour.

Plenty of different shots to learn, and well as all the options when bowling. You can spin it like Warnie, turn the ball into a bullet like Brett Lee, and swing the ball like.... ummm.... no Aussies come to mind.

Bugs? Yep, lots. More bugs than moths on a lovely evening at the SCG. One guy hit the ball out of the ground - it went through the stadium, lost into the abbyss, and was only declared a 4.

- THE MOST FUN PART IS ONLINE MODE . I played like 4 matches till now and I cant get over it. I want to keep playing and playing. The shortest Format You can play in ONLINE is INDOOR rules. Where you play with anyone in the world or with your friends with Indoor rules.

If you plug in a controller after you've launched the game, you have to close and re-open the game all over again. The mouse cursor is also constantly spinning, and doesn't disappear even when a controller is plugged in. You can move it to one side, but why is it spinning (and why doesn't go transparent for that matter) in the first place?

There's constant crashes and hangs, which just continues to show the game has been badly ported or supported. This is in stark contrast to Don Bradman Cricket 14, which really shines on the PC.

Versus Mode doesn't even work properly (or at least it didn't at the time I wrote this). Sure, you can choose to play two players, but once you get into the game, it's just player one against the CPU.

I'm a massive Big Ant fan, so I'm not sure what they were thinking on this one, though I have a bit of confidence they'll patch a lot of these issues that really shouldn't be issues.
