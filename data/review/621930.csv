I bought the game on sale, so I think I got a very good deal. It's otherwise too short and non-replayable for the price.

Pros:

- interestingly tactical, given the multiple unit types
- on-the-nose sense of humor, sometimes it gets a chuckle out of you
- an enjoyable and different experience

Cons:

- not really re-playable
- research tree is linear, progression is a bit boring
- UI and interactions can be *very* annoying: right clicking seems to work 3/4 of the time, enemies take too long to move, can't tab to next character while another animation is in effect, etc.
- building on the above: watching the enemy turns can be exasperating on large maps, you spend more time staring at soldiers than make your own moves (e.g. mission 4)
- the game looks a bit ugly to me

Some minor gripes:

- Missions 3 and 6 are far too hard, not a lot of fun
- Enemy paths aren't predictable (as in Invisible Inc.), so player choices have a bit of randomness to them (instead of feeling tactical)

All in all, it's a decent enough game; but if you've played Invisible Inc., then Attack of the Earthlings might seem a bit unpolished.

This is cheaper than a movie and also has contains much more value!

I reloaded a lot, because I try to avoid any units. If you play more casually, this game should have about 9-10 hours of fun for you!
This game is polished! That means I didn't encounter a single bug or crash!
The game supports 21:9 WQHD ultra-wide. Unfortunately, the ""Junkfish"" logo and the wallpaper for the main menu are low resolution and look strange in ultra-wide.

The humor fits the theme and is partly brilliant, partly... childish and disappointing. I really liked: The turret (but I feel like there was something missing in the finale) and the birthday cake. I didn't like the names (Pecker, Dickinham *yawn*) and the missing deeper character motivations.
The game is not a lifeless hull, it was made with love. You can see that because of the countless details woven into the levels (references, easter eggs), the hand-written lines and voice acting for the important characters. There are even proper cutscenes (intro, events, ending). Unheard of for a <10 € game!

The gameplay is turn-based and the levels are not randomly generated. That means replay value is almost not there if you are not playing for the achievements. That being said: The gameplay mechanics compliment each other, allow for upgrade choices and are well made.
The turn-based strategy can be very boring though. There is one level with about 30+ mines and you have to wait for every. single. one. of them to rotate on each enemy turn. That was very frustrating.

One major point of critique I have is that you can't access the level menu freely to repeat missions. If I want to get all the achievements for example, I either have to make a save for EVERY level or play the entire campaign again. Because I couldn't just repeat levels, I had to play very carefully, save a lot and reload saves. That felt like walking on egg shells, broke immersion and wasn't fun to be honest.
Another point of critique regarding saves is that the game DOES NOT have cloud saves. I wanted to continue playing the game on my laptop when I was out of town and the game did not have the save files available on the other pc. That was disappointing.

According to the achievements, about 58% of people who own this game actually start it up and about 16% complete it. There is still room for improvement, but for such a small game this is probably quite good.

The game also didn't feel very challenging. Most of the challenge comes from prediction the patrol routes for the guards and hope for the best. So it's basically just figuring out the level structure etc.
The soundtrack was okay, but there was not a single head-banger in there unfortunately. So soundtrack choices could be improved. Sound effects in general were functional and flawless.
There should have been at least one ""wilhelm scream"" in this game. Unfortunately there wasn't.

I really like this game anyway! It's like a short entertaining novel with a lot of humor baked into it. I am hoping for a part 2 with more evolved humor and sentient turrets!",1694467310,1694468384,True,0,0,0.457848817110061646,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Comparing these games is like comparing Star Wars to Spaceballs and by that I mean everything that follows can be applied to either pair (i.e. the games/the movies): They're not the same. One is goofy and lighthearted and has less substance, but it's easier to enjoy for people who aren't into the deep, complex shenanigans of the other.

X-COM is dark, gritty and has complex base-building and strategic gameplay. AotE is easier to learn since it has less depth/options, a more linear story, and it's undeniably funnier than X-COM... not because X-COM was bad, no, but because AotE is not meant be serious.
(The 1st NPC that you kill in the tutorial is pissing down a mountain path with his back to you while calling his secrete the ""wrath of Neptune"". The announcements of the humans' administator, which serve as mission updates and stuff like that, are sarcastic and ambiguous, and it's hilarious how he tries hush up the aliens' (your) presence while you devour workers and guards by the dozens lol)

Long story short: If you want a true reverse X-COM (dark and complex), you won't get served.
But if you want a lighthearted, entertaining, still challenging but not hardcore turn-based strategy game that features solid gameplay, strangely appealing gore (like in a Scott Ridley/Simpsons crossover) and black humor, and also makes you lose track of the time, [b]Attack of the Earthlings is the right thing for you.[/b]

It's a turn-based strategy that allows for many solutions and tactics. Depending on the upgrades you obtain, each level can be played very differently.

Une pincée de cynisme et d'humour complète la recette.[/h1]

Acquis contre 2.50 euros en promotion, segmenté en sept niveaux et s'étirant sur une quinzaine d'heures, la proposition se révèle plus qu'honorable, n'affichant aucunes ambitions démesurées pour abattre les cartes de l'humour (parfois noir) et de la parodie.

L'être humain y confirme son statut de parasite ultime: débarquant pour s'implanter et coloniser, décimant les espèces endiguant son expansion puis ponctionnant les ressources lui étant utiles, jusqu'à leur épuisement.

Attack of the Earthlings met en scène une société d'énergie intergalactique, Galactoil, dont la nouvelle proie est la planète X13 ; sur laquelle évolue une espèce insectoïde, particulièrement agressive, que le joueur contrôle: les Essaimeurs.

Aussi cupides que stupides, nos colons sont voués à être décimés, assimilés puis recyclés ; afin que la Matriarche extra-terrestre engendre de nouveaux rejetons, se déclinant en sous-embranchements: Grunt (la troupe de base), Goliath (frappant fort et caparaçonné), Disrupteur (crachant une boule de bile corrosive) et Harceleur (posant des pièges). En outre, notre Matriarche est capable de prendre le contrôle d'un individu pour s'en servir d'éclaireur, conservant sa forme humaine mais devenant un légume sur pattes.

En découle un tour par tour tactique, se déroulant au sein d'un réseau de couloirs et de salles, mettant en relief l'infiltration et la coordination des attaques. Le concept est aussi simple qu'efficace, d'autant plus que l’optimisation se trouve réduite à sa portion congrue, se limitant à un arbre d'améliorations plus que réduit.

Dans l'esprit, l'humour proposé par Attack of the Earthlings s'inscrit dans le sillage d'une inspiration flagrante: Mars Attacks!. Le cynisme est au rendez-vous, les postures humaines tutoyant le grotesque, notamment celles du superviseur qui délivre des commentaires et des consignes stupides.

La direction artistique est aussi carrée que colorée, sans caractère particulier mais propre, les musiques inspirées s'étirant harmonieusement, en totale adéquation avec le contexte. Une bonne surprise les concernant.

L'expérience est concluante, Attack of the Earthlings se présentant tel un jeu d'appoint qui permet de souffler entre deux productions plus denses. Les mécaniques du gameplay sont vite assimilées et les à-côtés sont quasiment inexistants. Un titre qui ne retourne pas le cerveau bien qu'il induise un minimum de réflexion quand l'adversité prolifère, nous invitant à utiliser avec discernement les compétences propres de chaque entité extraterrestre.

Une introduction idoine pour ceux qui découvrent le tour par tour tactique, le titre allant droit au but, sans submerger le joueur, la pointe d'humour rendant l'expérience légère.

[b]1. XCOM[/b]
AotE's basic gameplay will be familiar to anyone who has played the new XCOM games. While it is not exactly the same, the purely mechanical changes are mostly just tweaks. You will be able to pick this up and start playing without a long learning curve. It is also not particularly difficult at the end of that curve if you're an experienced tactics gamer.

[b]2. Stealth[/b]
The main way in which AotE differs from XCOM mechanically is that this is very much about stealth. You move your units around secretively and create ambushes against the enemy. This is aided by most enemy units following clearly defined movement paths. I love stealth so this was definitely a plus for me.

[b]3. Indie[/b]
This isn't a knock. A good indie game knows its limits, and AotE is a good indie game. It knows it is trying to be a simple stealth XCOM game, and it does this well for a dozen hours, without adding unnecessary elements, and then finishes. There isn't unnecessary diversity of unit types, the levels aren't enormous, they haven't wasted lots of money on voice actors. The game doesn't need those things. This is a good indie game.

[b]4. British[/b]
The vibe is very, very British. You know what that means: wacky, sarcastic humour. Perhaps the best analogy would be to The IT Crowd. The pompous corporate boss even looks and sounds a lot like Matt Berry's character. Look out for lots of little jokes in the set dressing, for example by reading screens and information boards.

Your female protagonist, in-between a xenomorph queen and a Starship Troopers' bug, purges her territory from the latest British invasion, an evil oil evil corporation run by bickering egomaniacs. Just like the real thing, plus the office turrets.
The comedic story keeps bringing the laughs and the surprises.
The antagonist is excellently voiced by a clone of David Mitchell. Betrays the resources and tech at Team Junkfish's disposal.
Animation, sound, music... all perfect and fitting.

The base mechanics are great: You can consume your kills to increase a pool of biomass, spend from that pool to spawn units, and these units can add to that pool, or draw from it to upgrade themselves to a rogue (traversal, backstab,) a wizard (missiles, illusions,) or a warrior (armor, attack) unit.
Great tactical flexibility.
Plus the values are kept simple and the system beautifully balanced.

The gamepad interface is dandy.
Except in the menus, quite clunky and better navigated with a mouse.
The one big missing feature is a level selector, to replay a campaign level without having to replay all the previous ones. That's a strange oversight.

The aliens obviously have a reference to xenomorphs and the way the game works is you gain Biomatter by eating humans. Both the unarmed workers and the armed security detail. With this Biomatter, the queen can create a drone that later is able to evolve into three different creatures that have their own strengths and weaknesses.

There is a upgrade tree where you put your points on multiple branching paths. The fun and interesting part of this is that you can save before a mission and turn upgrades on and off so you aren't stuck with a certain build if you find that you don't use a unit that much or if you feel the points could be spent in better places for a certain mission you might be struggling with.

La mecánica del juego es sencilla, similar a muchos juegos de combate táctico por turnos, en los que los personajes controlados por el jugador disponen de ciertos puntos de acción y ataque, que les permiten usar habilidades, moverse, atacar, etc. Además, el juego toma elementos de los juegos de infiltración, como el ""cono de visión"" y alcance del ruido para los personajes no jugadores.
Y esto es todo lo que puedo decir del juego sin spoilers.
Repito una vez más que es un juego sencillote, más bien casual. Alrededor de 7 niveles que yo he completado en 13 horas más o menos. La dificultad ni siquiera es configurable.
El apartado musical se hace un tanto repetitivo sin llegar a ser monótono. Creo que 3 o 4 canciones en total.
La traducción al castellano es rudimentaria en algunos casos. No creo siquiera que hayan contado con traductor.
Por último, decir que me lo he pasado bien con este juego. Algunas veces incluso me ha hecho reir. Aunque no creo que vaya a rejugarlo, creo que te hace pasar un buen ratillo, siempre que lo cojas en oferta.",1666796138,1666796189,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Pro-
Fun writing - Light hearted and humorous writing 
Impactful upgrades - Change how you approach the levels
Interesting mechanics - start with 1 unit and grow your forces with each kill

Cons-
Short - only few levels
Controls - found a few times I would click a few times to get anything to happen.
End turn waiting - some levels you will have to wait each end turn for 1-2 minutes which adds up over 20 turns
Not much replayability - only one set of maps

10점 만점에 7점 정도.



적을 죽이고 -> 적의 시체를 자원으로 활용해 -> 병력을 생산하고 -> 병력을 진화시켜 -> 세세한 전략을 사용한다. 는게 대략적인 흐름으로, XCOM 시리즈처럼 운영파트가 따로 있는건 아니지만 그와 비슷한 요소들을 차용하고 있다. 

외계인의 입장에서 지구인의 뛰어난 기술력를 상대한다는 배경, 나름 괜찮은 난이도, 약간의 테크트리, 탱커/딜러/유틸리티로 분할되어있는 병력 구성, 그리고 각 미션마다 새로운 기믹과 새로운 목적을 제공하고 있다. 나름대로 턴제 전략게임으로서 구색을 갖추려고 한 흔적이 보인다. 

특이하게도 어떤 상황에서든 세이브가 가능하기 때문에, 매 턴마다 세이브해놓고 언제든지 세이브-로드 노가다를 진행할 수 있다. 하지만 그 덕분에 기본적인 난이도는 높은 편이다. 



문제는, 이 모든 것이 너무나도 얇다는 것.
게임성이 너무 넓은 것도 아니고, 너무 깊은 것도 아니다.

적들의 기믹과 전략은 조금씩 달라지고 추가되지만, 아군의 기믹과 전략은 제한적이다. 테크트리가 있긴 하지만, 매번 그렇듯 밸런스 문제 때문에 쓸만한 기술은 많지 않다. 덕분에 결과적으로는 거의 같은 전략이 미션마다 되풀이된다. 

게다가 후반으로 갈수록 더 불리한 환경으로 진행하게 되며, 쉬는 역할을 하는 운영 파트가 없고 전투가 계속 이어지다보니 긴장감이 너무 높아진다. 

전략의 한계 + 높은 긴장감이 합쳐져 플레이어 입장에서는 후반으로 갈 수록 전투가 더 귀찮아지는(지루해지는) 현상이 발생한다.

번역은 완전 개떡같지만, 그래도 아예 없는것보다는 나은 수준이다. 번역하기가 귀찮았는지 띄어쓰기를 제대로 하지 않은 곳도 많고, 어떤 곳은 “베히모스”로 되어있고, 어떤 곳은 “고릴라”로 되어있는 등. 단어도 그때마다 달라지는걸 볼 수 있다.",1646796171,1646796171,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The story is drip fed to you through intercom banter, where the two human leaders mostly play off each-others incompetence as you thwart their plans. The game is a love letter to classic B movie alien movies, and follows a pretty easy plot. 

AOTE is a turn based strategy game with an isometric camera, which is usually enough for people to scream ""OMG IT'S XCOM!"" despite the game behaving nothing like it. For one, there is no RNG element forcing you to reload saves and pretty much everything works/moves consistently. You start every level with a queen unit, who needs to eat a few folks so she can start releasing grunts into the level, who make up the basic building block of your forces and later evolve into other critters. 

Let's talk about why this game is good. The dry and off the wall comedy works well with the serious murderous advance of the Swarmers. The core gameplay loop of sneaking up and eating people is generally fun, you can even hide and use vents to further bushwhack enemies. Despite being called swarmers, you very quickly learn that you actually want your guys dispersed all over the level to flank the humans on every avenue. I love how the Matriarch is always dynamically entering the level. 

Now the bad. Z E R O Replay value! The game is only eight or so maps with the first handful being painfully linear introductory levels; the enemies and such are all in premeditated locations so there's not much replay value at all besides a MASS of achievements designed to trick you into perfecting the levels. Some of these levels are also painfully short and are just gimmicks native to the genre. 

For instance: There's the traditional early game stealth mission where we have to free the queen from a lab, a timed mission where we escape a self destruct sequence, and a map control mission where we have to stop VIPs from escaping. For those three levels, that's the one thing going on and it HEAVILY distracts from the actual game. 

This brings me to the fact that game would of been slightly better if it had adopted a more open world attitude where you were taking out facilities, hunting for people, and otherwise attacking with a more open concept. Many of the levels are straight A to B affairs with only the final map having a large open concept going for it. 

There's also an ""Evolution"" mechanic where you do linear upgrades on your guys. It's not actually evolution, and in general upgrades you get are not that good. In fact you can safely just make your queen a killing machine at first, the only time I NEEDED an upgrade what the level 7 boss fight.

LEVELS are ok though there isn't a lot of them. they are somewhat large maybe about as big as an xcom level give or take.

UNITS there are 6 i've seen and 4 can be upgraded with 3 abilities. 1) first is you're main character that can eat bodies then spawn a smaller alien. if you lose her your dead. 2) is a bug type alien that can crawl into grates but its main purpose is to evolve into 1 of 3 other bugs using bodies you've eaten. 3) a spitter type that can learn some other range stuff like distract. 4) an armored bug that can take more than one hit (so 2 hits) and it hits a little harder. this one has a armor up ability and some nice attacks if upgraded. 5) a rogue like bug that can learn backstab (though you can only melee from the side or back, rarly you can front attack by using a door) 6) you can bug a none guards face. these things can distract but will mainly scout though some parts they will just get shot on site. using distract can also lead to them getting killed.

STORY? this is funny and the best part of the game.

OVERALL i feel its a decent game but the abilities do not lead to different strategies. you play the level how the dev set them up and you do not have much variation of what you can do.

XCOM系のターン制ストラテジー。
「あっちは宇宙人が攻めてくる話だから、こっちは逆にしよーぜ」的なワンアイディアと思いきや、それだけでは終わらないのが面白いところ。

主人公のエイリアンクイーンさんは、倒した敵の死体を吸収することでリソースを獲得し、自らの眷属を生み出していくことができる。
生み出したユニットは遠距離系、タンク系、奇襲系の3つに進化させることができ、これらを駆使して戦うわけだ。
ただしエイリアンとは言っても、銃を持った地球人には敵わないので、コソコソ背後から近づき、集団でバッサリやるのが基本となる。

ユニットをマップ間で持ち越すことはできないが、クリア報酬を消費して各種のスキルを解放し、戦いを有利に進めることが可能だ。

全体的にコメディタッチでボリュームも少なめだが、なかなかどうして考えさせられる部分があり、よくできたタイトルであった。

You play the aliens against humans in tactical, turn based combat over a battle field grid. 

But this is a much simpler affair that X-Com. Almost all your attacks are melee. As this would be either too difficult or too simple there is also a stealth mechanic, where enemies have a cone-shaped field of vision that requires you to get flank attacks to avoid being shot when you it's your turn to attack. Yet this attempt to attack some complexity really isn't enough. There aren't many tactical options beyond moving behind an enemy and whacking them. And if that's impossible, either wait for them to patrol passed or maneuver your forces around for the next attack.

Enemy variety isn't very interesting. They all behave quite similarly with variations in their damage and health but little else. There is one melee focused Earthling that does require different tactics, but it's not hard to defeat them either.

Graphics are quite basic. Textures and environments aren't interesting as you move from one space installation to another. Some models are used to liven up the various areas; ATMs in the mall district, stock tickers in the accounting department, etc. but the scenery doesn't change. Animations are very stiff particularly when units are turning.
Sound design is fine and the music is satisfactory. The voice acting however is quite decent if you're looking for English snobbery this game has it in spades.

If this game has any selling feature it's arguably the story, which is mostly a parody of a large corporation with all the usual Hollywood tropes; greedy industrialists that don't care about their employees etc. These are well trod tired jokes, and short of a few chuckles there wasn't much I found amusing.

Rather than random missions, the game consists of 7 missions in a linear campaign. There's no branching choices, and missions don't really have many different ways to approach them, so unless you're hunting achievements replayability is a bit low. Even so, the game has just enough ideas to sustain its playtime (took me about 8 hours to complete, plus a few more hunting some achievements) - if it was much longer I think it would be too long. As you can probably infer from that, each mission takes an average of around an hour, so much longer than your typical mission on XCOM or Xenonauts.

Your playstyle will largely rely on stealth, as what few ranged attacks you have aren't great, but in melee your units are very strong. It can require some patience, and maybe some reloading if things go wrong. Given the nature of the campaign, it's been designed with this in mind, rather than being designed with players failing but carrying on in mind.

The humour is very much in the old Bullfrog style, and I wouldn't be surprised if the writers had either worked on, or took a lot of inspiration from, titles like Theme Hospital. It's silly and playful.

It was not a long journey through this game by any means. That said, it was an awesome one. There were laughs, there was fun, and a neat short story. This is a rather fantastic game.

From the screenshots on the main page, you can piece together what this game is at it's base: An X-Com game where you play as the aliens. Unlike X-Com however, your units are much more disposable. You also don't bring in any units at the start of each mission, only the Matriarch which spawns all of your units as you progress. Which I am a fan of, since it allows for switching up tactics when you need to. And it's all set up in a way that makes it easy to understand.

Overall, I loved most everything about this game. The story is funny, but still cool. The gameplay is simple to learn and fun to play through. I honestly can't find much bad to say about this title.

+ Very unique and brilliant concept for a storyline.
+ Great humor.
+ Very engaging gameplay, it's a turn based tactical game and you can use multiple strategies to proceed through situations.
+ Stealth is well developed.
+ Experimentation with upgrades.
+ Good wacky soundtrack.

- Controls are uncomfortable. Character select, action confirm and movement should be set for one button, but they are set for multiple buttons, there's no way to modify it to one button.
- Can't skip enemy turns.

The basic stealth turn-based tactics mechanics work great, tho, and the game play is mostly really fun, with some surprising depth to it. I'm going to do at least one re-play, to pick up some achievements and try to beat my score on the various levels. 

There are also some issues. I got stuck on the penultimate level for several plays because it wasn't clear I had reached the exit, so I kept looking for it instead of waiting there for the timer to run out. It took a while to get the hang of what I need to right click on and what needs left clicking, too. Finally, I think there's still no way to remap the zoom functionality, which means that if you don't have a scroll wheel (or function that duplicates it, like some trackpads do), you can't even complete the tutorial.

Final verdict, grab it when it's on sale if the core concept looks interesting to you. I would love to see something like this get the backing to get up to X-Com levels of content, but this is just a bite-size version.",1605924866,1605924866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Think Alien type aliens. They get understandably mad, and the tutorial mission is about the matriarch sneaking into the company's ship. Every mission is a different floor of the ship (logistics, accounting, marketing, etc) culminating with the CEO's office at the top. I'll get this out of the way now: this game is a linear puzzle with next to no replay value. It's also short! I beat it in 6.5 hours. I watched the finale and credits and have no desire to redo any of the missions/collect the rest of the achivements as the story is over and that's it, that's all I want.

Every mission starts the same way: the matriarch arrives as a single unit, and has to find a way to kill and eat humans so she can spawn more aliens. Aliens come in different types: basic, then three upgraded specialized forms. Your objective is to spread through the level and eat everyone, while also keeping the matriarch from getting killed as that's game over.

This is where I bring up Invisible Inc, as it feels a lot like that: stealth is important. Getting spotted gets you shot, and only a few specialized aliens can survive that. You sneak through vents, hide in convenient closets, set up ambushes, and use the coordinated attack so you can kill 2+ units in one turn without their death screams alerting others.

And, oddly, this is where I bring up the story: every mission features the corp's people realizing what's happening, trying to stop it, and panicking over the PA system. The main character (so to speak) is the CEO's personal assistant, Pecker. He talks a lot, and his dialogue is surprisingly fun as he copes with incompetence while trying to save himself. He's a horrible weasel and I enjoyed finding out his fate. The VAs are good too - speaking characters are annoyed, British, and bombastic. Great fun to listen to!

This leads into every mission being a neat twist so it's not a repeat of the same tactics. The first few are easy, but then new enemies are introduced, or new gimmicks. Every mission has a unique twist that made it fun and/or memorable, and I actually looked forward to the later levels because I knew they'd bring something new to the table, and they did! I've never played an XCOM game where every mission was its own unique puzzle, and it felt awesome.

Now here are the two things that either make or break the game for you: 1) the sense of humor. It's very dry, very droll and also very crude. The first man you kill in the entire game is urinating (which is why he doesn't spot you creeping up on him). The CEO sabotages the security operations because he's too busy watching movies upstairs. Every employee on this rock is miserable, and it's an obscene parody of corporate culture. I almost quit in the tutorial but kept going and it really grew on me with some surprisingly actually funny lines and moments. I'd recommend sticking through it until the first mission is over, then decide if you hate it, as the tutorial isn't the best introduction to the game.

2) The biggie. There are noticeable quality of life problems. There is NO ability to speed up anything in the game. You must watch every enemy unit move at the same speed when their turn comes. Some things are a bit finicky. Also, you cannot see where guards are going - you either have to watch them or guess and sometimes that'll get you killed. Invisible Inc solved this already but oh well, whatever. It's workable, but it just needed a bit of polish that it didn't get. Load times aren't bad but they're just long enough to make you regret loading too often too. Stuff like that.

But if you're willing to be patient and the humor works for you and you're into untangling every mission's puzzle so you can eat every rich bastard inside this horrible place.... it's a great game! It's kind of like if Invisible Inc had handcrafted puzzle levels.

Final note: it goes for 20$, and I forget what its sale cuts typically are, but at this point you already know if it's worth it to you or not. It's 6.5 hours of content roughly, so measure that as you will.",1596245698,1596245698,True,12,0,0.651006221771240234,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Today we will be looking at “Attack of the Earthlings” a turn based tactical game wrapped in the guise of humor and playing the aliens as the protagonists.   This game should check off all the boxes of a great game…only not.  Let’s Discuss!

We didn’t start the fire:  Let me start on the good things, the game is charming, no doubt.  The graphics are passing but also convey a since of character.  The audio and voice-overs are okay (though they do the Sims dialog style too much) and the game is complete, bug free (as best I could tell) and easily approachable…but it’s so boring!  I greatly enjoy the premise and the humor is spot on, the cinematics are enjoyable but he core gameplay loop just isn’t there; especially with so many amazing squad games out there to play.

Who’d thought the Apocalypse would be so boring:  I enjoy the idea of playing another squad based tactical game.  I enjoy the idea of playing as the aliens and showing the humans as the bad guys.  I enjoy the idea of a tactical game focusing heavily on stealth and sneak attacks.  But why did it have to be so bloody boring!  The gameplay is very shallow, the characters (that you play as) have no depth, no reason to care and the gameplay itself is trifling easily.  The game functions around your Matriarch (which is a nice take) but you spend most of the level sneaking around killing and acquiring biomass, this would be fun if it wasn’t so shallow.  Your units are all characterless but can get upgrades based on points you earn from performance (bad mechanic).  All of said units hold specific functions and the game practically screams at you when you need to use them for a specific function.  The game plays more like a stealth puzzle game and less like a tactical squad game. 

Groundhog Day: After playing for 2 hours I just couldn’t be bothered anymore.  Which is tragic because I love these styles of game, my library holding most of them; I’ve played my share of shallow games that I wouldn’t recommend but still got through them.  I really want to love this game, it has a lot of the core features I should love but there is no depth to this game.  The levels need to be drastically shorted and provided some level of depth because as is each encounter is just a puzzle.  Mayhap I’m not the intended audience; I’m not sure who is but with the reviews on this game I’m sure many are.  I’m not opposed to paying $20 for 8 hours of gameplay, just has to be engaging.  For the cost of many of the more functional Tactical Squad games this game needs a lot added depth wise. 

Overall, if you are an X-COM fan I’d probably pass on this.  There just isn’t enough meat on the bone gameplay wise.  If you aren’t and can live with passable but shallow mechanics with a decently humorous premise then I’d wait for a sale and grab this.  Unfortunately I can’t really recommend it as is.  It is in desperate need of some depth.  Enjoy!",1595117036,1595117192,False,4,0,0.424797475337982178,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That is, it doesn't have much replayability due to a linear design and there is no randomization. But it isn't fair to blame the game for not being something else.

A big part of the enjoyment is tongue-in-cheek humor making fun of capitalism and corporations. The earthlings are so focused on the bottom line of their mining operation, the executives shift blame around, the workers are harassed by disciplinary robots and have a timer that counts down when they go to the bathroom. It's a hoot. The aliens spread through the mining ship largely due to human incompetence.


The gameplay is fairly simple. You start each level controlling the Matriarch who, after consuming dead humans, can produce grunts who can be further upgraded into one of three specialist roles. Each level is essentially a puzzle but there are many options for proceeding. I never felt like I had to follow a specific strategy. Casual, relaxing, and not particularly difficult.

Integral to this game is it's sense of humour, akin to Borderlands and Portal in the video game world, and Office Space and Mars Attacks in the film world, with Galactoil (the corporate representation of space-faring humanity) as a pseudo-functioning corporate hegemony operating with a casual disregard for employees coupled with an ironic motivational propaganda machine in a modern office-space environment. There are so many little touches incorporated into the level design alone that really imbue this humour and help world and character-build in what could otherwise be seen as a very short and superficial game. This humour is also more obviously threaded through the hapless characters and their dialogue and interactions with each other and the AI/robots throughout, which as you play gradually reveals more of the antagonist's motives and frustrations as you pick them apart and upset their plans (or just overhear comedic character monologues and watch as robots respond benignly to your presence).

Gameplay is turn-based, alternating between your alien swarm followed by the humans (as opposed to individual mob initiatives), which allows for some fun tactical setups in destorying/consuming humans before sneaking off through a ventillation shaft, or just celebrating Carlos' birthday. You are the Matriarch of the aliens, and as you kill and devour the pathetic humies you can spawn expendable offspring to help kill them in more fun and exciting ways. As you progress, you gain mutagen points after each level, allowing you to mutate your alien offspring into different breeds (effectively: tank, ranged, and stealth units) that you can upgrade further as you go. Meanwhile, the humans inevitably upgrade throughout as well, and with a flexible point-allocation system you're encouraged to experiment and balance your squad according to the mission requirements (or just whatever methodoloy you prefer to apply when dismembering and consuming the human oppressors).

While there are only 7 levels, each one is a uniquely engineered environment, with different gameplay mechanics requiring different tactical approaches and alien units in order to succeed. Each level also progresses the story and introduces new characters and mob-types interspersed through the gameplay and cut-scenes. While the game is short, it has a tight, humour-laced narrative coupled with interesting combat mechanics, well crafted environments and clever/humorous sound-design.

The one down-side is that at around 15hrs it's rather short compared to most other turn-based combat games, and it's a shame there aren't any additional game modes or optional missions to explore as you're very much rail-roaded in both story and gameplay. As such, don't expect anything with the level of strategy, replayability and dynamism of other turn-based games like XCOM, but perhaps expect something more akin to the joy and narrative experience of playing Portal (replace puzzle-solving with turn-based combat). Thanks to Team Junkfish for a wonderfully satisfying and polished game, and hope it gets the wider recognition it deserves.

Plays perfectly on Linux.

Attack of the Earthlings garners many comparisons to reverse-XCOM due to it being turn-based as well as being aliens vs humans, although I found its stealth-heavy gameplay more similar to Invisible Inc. 

Its gameplay premise is simple but effective: every level begins with you controlling only the Matriarch. Although a capable fighter in her own right, she is vulnerable and cannot endure sustained combat; her true strength instead lies in (re)production - by consuming the corpses of fallen xenohumans, she can accrue biomass and eventually start creating Grunts. While physically weak, unlike the Matriarch they can traverse the ventilation pipes present on every level; but more importantly, these Grunts serve as intermediaries for more specialized forms: the stealthy Stalker, the tactical Swarmer, and the mighty Goliath. Each of these can be further upgraded between levels, further developing their distinct strengths. While the Stalker is by and large the most powerful (it's stealth-focused after all), there is sufficient enemy variation to strongly encourage the use of other units, and the interplay between them is often quite satisfying, even if not very complex.

In terms of writing, while most tactical games aim to maintain a certain level of seriousness or suspense, Attack of the Earthlings instead adopts a dryly whimsical, dark humor style of writing. A satire on corporate culture taken to the extreme, we see a ruthless but pragmatic supervisor taking more and more drastic measures to contain the alien threat, only to have his plans foiled, time and again, by the whims of a selfish and impetuous superior who is too daft to even realize there's writing on the wall. The writing isn't stellar, but it is decent and managed to elicit a chuckle from me from time to time.

What bogs the game down, however, is its greatly limited replay value and the less than smooth gameplay. Levels are entirely scripted, so there won't be any new surprises once you've finished them once. There are also no difficulty options, and the game is fairly easy, so players looking for a challenge might be disappointed. It is also rather short: there's only seven levels (two of which are basically tutorials), and the game will probably take an average of 5-8 hours to complete; and that would've been fine, were it not for the many unnecessary animations in between each action. The interface is also slightly buggy - the most glaring issue being the inability to cancel some orders without bringing up the escape menu.

-------------------------

To sum up:
+ Neat twist on the genre
+ Good gameplay with satisfying interactions between units
+ Decent writing with dry humor which is actually quite funny at times
-- Rather short, limited replay value
- Not very challenging
- Interface is slightly buggy/awkward
- Quite a lot of waiting in between actions

The story states that you're the alien race of a planet that a megacorp's drill spaceship is trying to drain of it's resources. As the angry alien you are you slaughter your way through their megadrill spaceship deck by deck (mission by mission) from the bottom (workers) to the top (CEO).

The gameplay is quite consistent, follows easily understandable rules and the game never throws something at you that you can't handle. It gets quite hard later on though, especially before the last mission. Still you're allowed to save anytime and as often as you want, restart or load whatever you want. The game begins simple and explains it's features without an extra tutorial for that. As the game progresses you first unlock further unit types and later on upgrades for them that grant them either new abilities or bonus values for certain actions.

In total you have 6 unit types:
1) Matriarch:
-spawns Grunts, the basic alien unit that can mutate into 1 of 3 types of more specialized units
-can't use vents
-can use hiding spots
-can later on receive upgrades to gain extra health, regenerate health, deal more damage, attack once more per round
-main unit, must survive
2) Grunt:
-worse vision distance than any other unit
-least damage of any alien unit
-can use vents & hiding spots
3) Stalker:
-attacks entirely bypass enemy armor
-can create traps that disarm the enemy stepping on or through for 1 round
-can later on receive upgrades to deal twice as much damage by attacking from behind, gain extra AP upon killing an enemy, sacrfice it's attack option for 1 round to gain +4 AP
-can use vents & hiding spots
4) Disruptor:
-only ranged attack unit with +1 range compared to human weapons but an attack so weak that only the most basic or already wouned units can be oneshot by it from a distance; the ranged attack also has a 2 round cooldown
-can also melee attack
-can later on receive upgrades to either lure / blind / deceive (enemies attack another) with special versions of ranged attacks that either cost AP or make the unit unable to attack this round
-can't use vents
-can use hiding spots
5) Goliath:
-+10 damage and armor compared to all other unit's base values
-can use special ability for +10 armor
-can later on receive upgrades for 1 field range 35 damage dealing ground slam, +1 attack per round, +15 HP selfheal
-can't use vents & hiding spots
6) Drone:
-created by your Matriarch turning a non-alerted civilian into a Drone by using the special ability for that
-good vision range
-treated as friendly unit by non-alerted enemies, attacked by alerted enemies
-can distract enemies close by
-can flip switches for you
-limit of 1

*AP = action points

The gameplay mechanics in detail:
-health: visible as health bar on each unit
-armor: reduces all types of damage by it's amount; indicated as icon next to the enemy health bar
-attack damage: indicated on enemies below their health bar along with the number of their attacks per round
-vision cones: different on certain enemy units (some get 360° cones with 3 fields distance, some 180° with 2 fields distance, some 45° 3 fields distance)
-alert states: green / yellow (heard something suspicious and wants to come and check) / red (civilians will flee to the nearest exit; guards always draw their gun now - remains active state for the rest of the mission)
-movement: 1 square = 1 AP; some special actions cost 2-3 AP
-special abilities: cost either AP, your attack move, bio mass and usually have a cooldown of at least 1 round
-attacks: all enemies can attack from a distance while all of your units can only attack in melee combat, except for the Disruptor unit; some enemies have multiple attacks per round; only 2 of your melee units (Matriarch, Golaith) can gain up to 2 attacks per round via upgrade later on, all others only have 1 attack per round
-vision: all units have a some squares ranging vision area, even through walls; only the basic grunts have actually bad vision range
-bio mass: gained by devouring enemy corpses; used to create your alien army by spawning Grunts from your main unit (Matriarch) at the cost of 4 bio mass; you can chose 1 of 3 unit types to mutate a grunt into
-mutagen: upgrade resource that's awarded at the end of a mission; you get more the better your mission performance was (fewer turns, no losses etc.)

The core gameplay is mainly about positioning, managing your actions, taking out single enemies efficiently and surviving each mission to get to the next. For groups of enemies you get disruptive abilities later on, mostly with the Stalker and Disruptor but sight-breaking level architecture can also help with that. Additionally to take out multiple enemies without triggering an alert there's the team action, which sadly only works for melee attacks, and lets multiple attacks of your units happen at once. This allows you to either take multiple enemies without one noticing the attack on / death of the other and triggering an alert or to kill a single strong enemy instantly by surrounding that unit with multiple of your units. The game's UI is quite clean and simple: You've got your action buttons per unit that you can either click or bind a hotkey to. Same for tabbing through your units back and forth. The only thing I missed at times was a map of all that I already had explored along with where my units are. The camera can be turned 90° 4 times. Each of your unit's actions forces some waiting time until it's performed before you can order the next unit to do something. All ingame cutscenes are skipable. The only thing you (sadly) can't skip is watching enemy movement inside your vision distance - that's always shown per enemy unit and can't be skipped.

I haven't encountered a single bug or issue in my playthrough aside from sometimes needing to adjust my camera view a bit to be able to click corpses to devour in corners. One thing I noticed, however, was a 6 GB RAM and 30% CPU drain solely by this program after playing it some hours. That's a lot for what it actually features.

Overall I recommend the game. I had fun, for me it's a good game. As always: not every game is for everyone. It's a turn based game with a gameplay of strategically taking out single enemies and some humor along with a main story that progresses through the missions. If you want some further impressions then either watch some gameplay videos made by other people or get it on Steam - but stay below the 2h gameplay time to still be able to get a refund.

And I think the steam page should put more emphasis on that. Although it mentions that it's a stealth game.

Pros:
- Unique way of getting units and gaining your resource biomatter
- It realy makes you feel like an alien infiltrating a human spaceship or base. 
- Visual design is comical simple but good. As an example: Vents have ""VENT"" written over them in huge letters. How can that not be hillarious but also draws your attention in a ""look, you have this option"" way.
- Abilities are well explained and easy to understand. Movement path effects, enemy vision and ranges are easy to read (not like xcom where you never know if you can hit an alien of if that fence post shaves of 90% of your accuracy or where you dont know if the enemy will see you when you sneak up on their back!)
- You can always do better. While the levels are static, you get a score at the end, which you can always try to improve.

Con:
- It's easy. Especially for xcom veterans and the like it's way to easy. While it's more puzzly then strategy, that also means the game can feel like a chore.
- While they are easy to use, Controlls are not what you'd expect from a game like this. You need to double click many things that should need single clicks, and it's easy to forget options or units you have around because it doesn't ask you to do anything with them. Worst is that the movement point counter (which is used for many abilities too) isnt displayed on the unit icon. Only on the unit itsself. And only if it has any left.
- You dont get the option to replay a level once you've pressed ""continue"" after finishing it. Which makes story sense, sure, but it is frustrating in a first time playthrough when for your first and second level you didnt get many points (which are used to unlock new abilities for your units) and you're always shy of 100-300 points for the rest of the game to get one more ability because you didnt get those points at the start cause you didnt know what the fuck you were doing!
- The levels are set. There's realy not any variety with playthroughs aside of you having more knowledge about the level and how to play the game. Thus you might not play it more then 1 to 3 times ever. The lack of more then the 3 units (of which 1 is a must use because it's the only ranged one and the only one with a lure) you have very little freedom in ""army"" compositions to go with. (combo of the Stalker with double dmg backstab and the disruptor's lure and range will beat anything except bosses in one hit. And the Stalker is the cheapest to upgrade and evolve a grunt into.)
- A price of 20$ is a little high I think. But it's not overly overpriced. And steam sales exist on anything bit the newest game. So this isnt as bad.

In the end, I would definitely recommend this game when it's on sale! 
It's a simple game and a lot of simple fun. Definitely worth playing through once if you like the alien movies, like stealth games or easyer turn based strategies.
But the main appeal of the game is just silly fun and enjoyment of being an alien group, sneaking through a base eating people to grow stronger, and finding many little simple comical jokes or laughing at the stupid humans.",1576866180,1576866180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Both narratively and mechanically this game is one-note.  But it consistently hits that note, and rarely outstays it welcome.

I've seen alot of comments comparing it to X-Com, but I'd say that it gives the wrong expectations. This feels more like a puzzle game dressed in a tactical paint job. There is a handful of set stages that you'll need to stealth your way, spawning the correct alien for each job, killing the humans in the correct manner. While you can vary some from the ""Correct"" path, it'll cost resources that you may need for an enemy down the line.

Despite it being a linear puzzle, it feels very good.

The rules are simple to learn so that you're constantly making informed decisions. You've planned each ambush, everything went according and you feel like the monster stalking the halls. By the end of the third stage you've mastered everything you need to beat the game, and while each of the 4 units has an upgrade path... few actually change the game.

But there were a few situations that dulled the experience, a few specific stages where I found myself frustrated or annoyed by the tedium required for something. Specifically, the pathfinding tended to fail in one mid-game stealth section and one late game minefield. I needed to micromanage it one step at a time. 

But these were exceptions in the experience. Most of it was well paced, with just enough humor to keep me smiling.

+ Уровни. (Считаю, что уровни достаточно проработанные и видно, что ребята очень старались над ними)
+ Есть разные войны и у всех есть своя ветка прокачки. (т.е уровни можно проходить каждый раз по разному)
+ Сюжет. (Мне лично очень понравилось, наблюдать за главными антагонистами было весело и интересно)

Минусы
их всего несколько:
- Игра достаточно короткая, хотелось бы увидеть продолжение. (На прохождение ушло 8 часов)
- Во время кат сцен, или новых ходов, к сожалению нет какого-то переключения, или отображения всех юнитов на пользовательском интерфейсе, из-за чего нельзя выделить, или переключаться между юнитами, а после хода, нужно их искать по карте.

まだクリアはしていないがプレイ時間が10時間を越えたのでレビューを。

数多くあるタクティカルストラテジーだが、プレイヤーキャラがエイリアンという視点は新しい。敵（人間）を倒して食べることによってエネルギーをため、子エイリアンを作ったり、進化させたりできる。進化は遠隔、暗殺、大型のそれぞれ独自のスキルをもった3タイプ。遠隔能力を持ったもの以外は近接のみなのも特徴。武装した敵に見つかるとほぼ一撃でやられるので、とにかく見つからないように行動しながら、敵の背後を取ったり無力化したりして仕留めていく。少々敵に見つかっても近くの敵以外は反応しないので、ステルス感はInvisivble Inc.ほどシビアではない。

シナリオマップを順に進んでいくが、マップの構造や敵は固定で、マップ数も少なく、ランダム要素はほとんどないので、再プレイ性は低いかも。隠れたり後ろから追いかけたりしながら人間を追い詰め、エイリアンとして振る舞うのは、それっぽくてなかなか楽しい。日本語に対応しているし、難易度もそんなに高くないので、カジュアルにちょっと変わり種のステルスタクティカルを遊びたいという方に。

The humour that isn't toilet related could be summed up as ""Durr, humans are stupid TOTALLY ALL THE TIME! Tee-hee-hee! Oh yeah, before I forget: PEE!""

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind ""low-brow"" humour, and I don't want to sound elitist, but there's gotta be something more... I dunno... Interesting...

I went in with the impression that the game would have some justification for this monster to want to defend its homeworld from this human invasion, but it turned out (at least on the first floor) that that justification was that the guy in charge was just an arrogant middle-manager, promoted to the level of his incompetence. Honestly, I started to feel sorry for the poor peons I was slaughtering.

Maybe it gets better as the floors progress, but one hour in, and (apparently) 1/7th of the way through the game, I can't bring myself to start it again.

Again, I want to like this game, but I just don't...",1572196081,1572196081,False,3,0,0.505953848361968994,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically, it is turn based tactical battles (think X-Com minus the % to hit), but it isn’t on procedurally generated maps, instead there are set levels to get through.

As you may have surmised from the title… the game focuses on the Aliens instead of the humans. You are the Matriarch of an alien species. I’ll be honest, they’re totally inspired by the Alien movies, but that’s okay, they give their own spin on it.

Anyway, a human galactic mining company decides to land on your planet and on top of some of your kids. So, as any upset alien mother does, you get on their drill-spaceship and start slaughtering the humans in retaliation.

You get to utilise a few tricks, hiding in storage areas, utilising vents to lay out ambushes. Most of your units are melee focused, so planning is necessary, especially since humans have nice big guns. There’s even a storyline here, believe it or not, told via the PA system on the ship, usually from the men in suits wondering what the hell is going on.

Surprisingly, dialogue in this game is quite funny, there were more than a few clever one liners and more than a few moments that had me smiling. The aliens themselves don’t talk at all, they’re killing machines after all, so it is funny listening to the incompetent human corporation and their reactions to your bloodbath. For those of a keen eye, there’s a few environmental jokes as well.

All in all, there are 7 levels to get through. You have access to five different unit types, three of which are specialised for their own style of combat. You get to upgrade these as the missions go by and you can spawn them via biomass, which is gained by chowing down on human bodies.

If you’re up for a turn based game where you play the aliens, and you like amusing dialogue, check this one out, it really did take me by surprise, however given its length I recommend picking it up at sale price. 7/10",1568986951,1568986951,True,2,0,0.546198606491088867,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The one REAL downside is they use that r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d ""engine"" called Unity. It is evident all over from the lack of multiple events, the inability to remember scene changes after reloading a ""saved"" session, and my favorite evidence (sarcasm) the cheaply animated movies or ""cut scenes"" that look like paper or cardboard with just the camera changing angles to give the appearance of subtle movement.

The game is turn based, its cool. The point of the game is the mechanic that your entire life depends on your ""matriarch"" unit, which is the only one that you start with in each level from which you can spawn grunts, that then proceed to convert into one of the 3 units in the game, the rogue, the ranger, or the knight. As simple as this sounds this ends up with a lot of depth in later missions considering you cannot change one units class at all, and you are left with having to spawn another one at the cost of your ""biomaterial"" that you get by eating dead humans and recycling some of the dead aliens of yours.

Any negatives to the game? Yes. Waiting to see the AI's moves gets to be WAY too cumbersome, specially when you have near total vision which  makes the camera jumps around all the time and you have to wait for it to focus before the AI even moves, and specially when ther'es a lot of enemies in the map, making the wait time even longer. I kinda wish it did like Xcom or Xenonauts and made the enemy movements hidden to cut time. But beyond that, there's no real obvious negative point to the game. The artstyle is fine and stylized.

Well let me start off by saying this game has a ton of personality and it will make you laugh at times. If you're a Sci fi fan like me, you've probably tried one of those classic sci fi horror/action games where you're playing as an astronaut on a space station trying to avoid getting eaten by some alien scum. Well in this fun and exciting strategy game it's pretty much the exact same type of scenario but you're playing as the aliens. There's not really much of a story to this game. Basically a massive company and it's rich owner has decided to mine your planet for resources cause why the fuck not? And you, the leader of the alien race doesn't exactly allow outsiders inside your territory. So you do the most rational thing and start assassinating the average joe workers of this massive company, then use their biomass to produce an army of lower lifeforms under your command to assassinate even more humans! :D You can create 4 different unit types and they're all totally unique creations with special abilities that fit different playstyles. In the beginning i thought i had to use all 3 different evolutions (Out of the 4 creatures you can spawn 1 of them is the default non-evolved alien drone) but it turned out that you should really only stick to the xenos that suit your personal playstyle. I didn't hear about this game from some big youtuber, or anything. I just happended to get it recommended by Steam one day and thought ''hey that's a neat concept and it's on sale!'' There's also a small progression system in the game that allows you to upgrade your units and give them new and improved abilities. The game takes about 11-12 hours to finish if you're just doing a casual playthrough and you fail a few missions (Like i did) Each mission is really fun cause no mission has the same objective. There's no difficulty options in the game, and there's unfortunately no new game+... This is the bad part of the game, you see you can't replay levels unless you have an old save file right before the level you want to play. If you don't then you need to replay the level until you get to the level you want to replay. However there is only about 7-8 levels in total so it's not like getting to a specific level is hard. Each level feels new and unique due to each level having it's own objectives that are all totally different from one another. Overall i'd give Attack of the Earthlings a solid 7/10. Would recommend, even at full price if you're into strategy games and don't mind the low difficulty.

[h1]人類貪婪的飛行船降落異星球準備探勘，異形蟲后帶領她的子民群起反抗！[/h1]

[code]Attack of the Earthlings 是一款看似 XCOM 的回合制策略遊戲，實際上玩起來也確實很像，至少在戰鬥這塊有著類似的架構設計，但規模與格局上沒有那麼大；遊戲充滿黑色幽默的劇情橋段，讓這款扮演異形獵殺人類的作品，在血腥殺戮之中帶來不少歡笑的元素。[/code]

[h1]遊戲特色[/h1]
在「地球人入侵」中，我們可以透過扮演蟲后體驗到異形的頑強性，遊戲內殺死的所有敵人，都能被連皮帶骨吃的一乾二淨，而吞噬敵人獲得的生物質，可以讓蟲后孵化出新的異形單位，也能用來進化幼蟲單位，成為三種不同戰鬥風格的成蟲單位。

戰鬥的進行方式類似 XCOM，但這次我們扮演的是異形，作戰方式幾乎都是近距離搏鬥，沒有強大的遠程火力可用，因此任何持槍的敵人都是嚴重威脅，在戰鬥上會更貼近偷偷來的模式，利用陷阱、製造聲響干擾敵人，在透過通風道偷偷繞行到敵人後方攻擊，這一點會讓策略部分的玩法比較不一樣。

[b]真正的透過殺死敵人，來壯大自己！[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1680962344

[h1]80年代的黑色幽默喜劇[/h1]
遊戲在美術用色、劇情上，很有80年代科幻電影的風格，故事講述一間貪婪的能源企業，駕駛一艘巨型太空船降臨一顆充滿異形的星球，在降落的過程中壓死了許多異形，並想掏空這座星球的資源，而異形蟲后則潛入這座太空船展開報復，以往這種劇情的電影我們都是透過人類的視角來觀看，這次則可以由異形的角度來欣賞，不過結論都是人類因為太好奇或貪婪，活該招惹異形啦！

[b]劇情非常搞笑，充滿各種黑色幽默[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1696501466

[h1]遊戲優缺點[/h1]

✔️ 扮演異形，體驗吞噬、生產、演化的力量。
✔️ 80年代電影的黑色幽默風格。
✔️ 不一樣的策略玩法。
✔️ 美術風格不錯。

❌ 兵種單位種類少。
❌ 關卡數量太少，僅7關。
❌ 戰鬥偏潛行向，節奏較慢。

[b]戰鬥更偏向潛行、偷襲，很難正面硬上[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1680962610

[h1]結論[/h1]
遊戲不論在玩法、題材與創意上都有自己的特色，唯獨就是內容不夠多，戰役只有7個關卡，讓人有意猶未盡的感覺，加上異形的種類扣除蟲后就只剩下三種特殊單位，也讓戰鬥的變化少了許多，相當可惜；不過由於臺灣區定價只有美區的一半，如遇特賣時，當作一款類 XCOM 的策略小品來體驗是相當不錯的！

A decent-ish take on the tactical squad-based genre. 
AofE is a competent enough game. The elements are all there - tiles, action points, overwatch, sightlines. If you've played X-Com or Jagged Alliance you know the drill. 
The gimmick here is you don't start with a squad. You have a single ""matriarch"" unit - an alien queen if you will - that spawns a basic unit. The basic units can then turn into larger units. The matriarch can pump out one unit a turn. All of this is powered by ""biomass"" which is a currency you get from consuming corpses.
This is wonderfully thematic, you get a Zerg or Tyranid ""conquer and consume"" kind of vibe that fits well with the lore. The problem is that what often works from a story perspective isn't great for a game.
It's extremely bloody slow. 
You start with one unit. It has to kill something and eat it. Then it pumps out another unit, which in turn kills and consumes. Yes exponential mathematics means that eventually you'll have enough aliens to conquer a planet, but damn does it take a long time for this snowball to start rolling. 
I'd rather start with a squad thanks. 
Attack of the Earthlings isn't a bad game. It's good enough, if not groundbreaking. And it doesn't pretend to be a AAA title - this is small time stuff and they do the job well enough.

""We at Galactoil better make sure this 'replayability' item is properly implemented in our newest game.""

No New Game+, limited character progression (3 upgrades per unit type for 3 total unit types, plus 4 upgrades for your hero unit), and the absolutely confounding idea of not letting players replay beaten levels.

Yup. For a game that has multiple achievements per level, you'll have to start a new game each time, losing all your progress, just to, say, go for the speedrun achievement. Obviously, achievements aren't mandatory, but still. Perhaps they don't want players to grind for every upgrade and have to pick and choose? I suppose that makes some achievements more challenging, but tedious at the same time.

It's a shame that the complete omission of replayability is such a deal-breaker for me, because aside from that, I genuinely enjoyed the experience (at least until finding out after beating it that I cannot carry over my progress). I can't say that the game did exceptionally well in any single regard (aside from the humor, which I adored, but definitely not for everyone), but all the pieces are serviceable, solid even, and so is the overall product. Even with the lack of replayability, I can still comfortably recommend it at $10, but $20 for a game that I cannot be asked to beat again just for the sake of achievements is a bit too much.",1552187156,1552187156,False,6,1,0.492623955011367798,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros: 
- Tight design space, a nice change of pace from other entries in the genre.
- Well made, with no bugs found, clear tooltips and visual design that is both pretty and readable.
- Occasionally funny.

Cons:
- Edginess. The annoying kind. I'm guessing that I don't need to say this, most people probably saw the black and red player character designs and correctly guessed that the story would embarrass itself a bit...
- The research level. Politely, it could be called experimental but it would be more honest to call it a mistake. It's over eventually.
- Bad jokes mean no replay value. They're not all winners and I can't imagine putting up with some of these lines twice. At least the voice acting is fine.

Overall, a decent game, far from spectacular but it does the important things right more often than some triple-A studios.

Attack of the Earthlings is a game developed and published by Team Junkfish

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Attack of the Earthlings overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a great strategy action game to play in short bursts!

Okay, maybe it might not be best to call it that, though at first glance, it certainly gives off that impression of being a reverse XCOM, since you play as what can best be described as a copyright-neutral version of the Alien Queen: The Matriarch.

As the Matriarch, your goal is to sneak into a massive drill/corporate office and generally murder everything in sight... stealthily of course, because as we all know, bug-like aliens without any sort of firearm are pretty vulnerable to bullets. As in (die in one hit) sort of vulnerable. Fortunately, you have a lot of special abilities that can level the playing field!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Due to the high lethality in this game, you're gonna approach the humans stealthily, with your basic grunts utilizing vents to avoid enemy patrols while also eating the corpses you leave behind to collect biomass. At the first mission, it's really only used to create more grunts, though you are encouraged to not throw them into suicidal situations as you get penalized through fewer upgrade points that are introduced in the second mission (at that point, you unlock the full extent of what the alien arsenal has to offer

The grunt, while not having sort of upgrades, still provides a level of utility since it can crawl through vents as I have previously mentioned. Not only are they a hiding spot, but they also allow you to teleport to connected vents, which can prove quite effective when bypassing (and possibly murdering) enemy patrols, and dead people means more biomass. More biomass means evolutions (Goliath/Disruptor/Stalker).

The Goliath as the name implies, is a pretty big guy, being able to take TWO bullets to the face instead of one. From my personal experience, he seems to be a pretty decent pick if you're expecting to be put into a situation where you absolutely have to tank damage, and has the ability to increase his armor at the expense of the current turn's attack action. He also deals additional damage, which can prove handy when attempting to one-shot the tougher security guards.

The Disrupter is your ranged unit, and while their spit has a two-turn cooldown, is still a very important aspect as they still have a longer range than the security guard's vision cone, so you can probably expect to use him a lot in larger rooms where you have that level of maneuverability.

And finally, the Stalker. Essentially a stronger version of the Grunt, he can still crawl through vents and ignore armor with his melee attack. He can also be upgraded to deal backstab damage, which i'm expecting to be extremely useful in the later levels (Have only played through the first two missions, tutorial excluded)

Well... Okay, i say finally, but one ability that's shared with all the aliens is the Group attack, where you queue up multiple attack actions on the same unit, and press a big red button to overwhelm that health sponge before he can shoot back at you.

The execution is well... I really only have two complaints about Attack of the Earthlings: the game's length. Those complaints are...

[h1] The game's length[/h1]
 As soon as you finish the first mission, you get a mission select screen which reveals the full length of the game: 7 missions. I dunno how such a thing would be implemented, though I can't help but think there needs to be some form of procedural generation so that if you DO replay older missions, you're never gonna see the same layout as you did the first time you played it.  Onto the second complaint

[h1]Voice acting[/h1]
During the game's cutscenes where you're not looking through an overhead perspective, it seems kind of odd to do textboxes instead of voiced dialogue. So far, i've only seen generic workers in these scenes and I think it'd be good to have the devs do the voice actors since well... you don't need famous voice actors to do your regular joe shmoe.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
There's very few bad things I can say about this game since it does the whole ""alien perspective"" thing very well and for the bad things I can say about the game... It isn't exactly worth a thumbs down, but it is worth putting yourself on a discount waitlist such as IsThereAnyDeal or just simply adding the game to your Wishlist in preparations for the Steam CHRISTMAS SALE.",1532492963,1532493574,True,1,1,0.477714955806732178,1,True,False,False,False,,,

You play as the Swarmer Queen, who must rid her planet of Galactoil, a corperate franchise that stripmines planets for their resources; as cliched as that sounds, what makes this game so charming is that Galactoil is such a bumbling, incompentent business with few scrupples and even less of a clue, and their mundanity is nice contrast to the usual super evil corps of most sci-fi games.  Helping the game a long is a cute artstyle and some fun mechanics (seriously, the ability to co-ordinate attacks to strike at the same time is something the next XCOM needs), and while hardcore strategy fans may find this to easy, its low difficulty curve makes it great for newbies to the genre or for those of us who simply suck at these types of games.  Check it out if you are up from some XCOM Lite with a sense of humour, well worth it.

The foundations are there for a really great game, but there's a lot of aspects that feel they could be expanded on. In no particular order:

1. There's only 7 levels. The levels and objectives were fun, and there's a lot of strategy and careful patients that needs to be employed at times. But it's over far too soon. I was hoping for either a second world/location, or some bonus levels after the campaign was done. Unfortunately there's neither of these, and while the levels were enjoyable, I find little replayability in them. I would have loved to have seen more environments, especially with the setting/theme of the game.

2. There's only 5 units. The Matriarch acts as a moving base, able to attack and spawn basic units (Grunts) on the go. The Grunts she spawns can be evolved into 1 of 3 different units: a 'tanky' Goliath, a 'ranged' Disruptor, and a 'stealthy' Stalker. The reasons for the quotes is these units feel like they have the bare essentials to be considered those classes. The Goliath initially seems cool, with the ability to make themselves slightly tankier, dealing more base damage, and the only unit with an AoE attack, but there's rarely an occasion where he feels needed after you initially get him, and the AoE seems pointless as I can't think of an instance where 2 enemies were actually next to each other. I stopped using him all together after level 

3. The Disruptor has ranged abilities, but its basic attack is still melee ranged. This starts to feel extremely clunky, as only one of the abilities actually deals damage and it has a 2 turn cooldown. I only used these when I absolutely had to. The Stalker is easily the best pick, and I often found myself just creating an army of theses and eliminating everything I came across. They're the cheapest to evolve in to, they have the best mobility, and end up being your best source of damage if played right. It would have been great to see more variety and balanced design.

3. Each unit only has 3 upgrades. At the end of levels you earn points for a number of things (turns it took to complete the level, if you completed side objectives etc), and those points can be used to upgrade your units and unlock new abilities. And given that the Grunt cannot be upgraded, it amounts to a total of 12 potential upgrades. But as mentioned previously, the Stalker is the only unit that these upgrades feel worthwhile. It wouldn't have been hard to earn enough points to unlock all potential upgrades, but after fully upgrading the Stalker to be even better than it initially was I didn't bother. The concept honestly feels like an afterthought as a means to incentivise replay, however given I already wasn't using one of the units and barely using the other, it failed in this regard.

4. Plot is simple, but works. I found the humour hit the right levels of silly without getting stupid and annoying. There were some bits where I genuinely chuckled at a good line or moment. I would have liked to see more characters, but with only 7 levels it's understandable why the plot essentially revolves around 2 bickering protagonists.

Let me start by saying this game is very funny.
Its a turnbased strategy game with a lot of (dark) humour.
The story is actually the upside down version of XCOM. This time the humans have invaded your planet. You play as an alien to get rid of those nasty humans and save your planet.

The game doesn't really play like XCOM. You have at the beginning of a turn AP (around 8) you can use this AP any way you like: every step costs 1 AP, fighting costs AP, eating the bodies costs AP, etc
The Matriarch is the most important creature, if she dies it is game over. She uses biomass to spawn Grunt offspring. You earn biomass by killing humans and by eating bodies (humans and aliens)
Your Grunts can be upgraded in different creatures.
Also you can mindcontrol 1 human at a time to trick other humans.

The graphics are very good. The cutscenes are hilarious. The music is good. Only the voiceacting could be a little more extensive.

There are no difficulty settings, which is not a good thing. There is little replayability this way.

In total there are 7 levels. I have played the first 3 levels upon writing this review. The levels are big. Of course you could rush through the levels like some people like to do, but if you want to complete all objectives in a level including the optional ones the game has a fair length for its price.

There is a very good tutorial that takes you by the hand, so you can learn every new feature.
I wish all games used a tutorial like this game. 


I think €22.99 (base price) is a bit to steep for some people, but in my opinion it is worth the price.
I would give this one an 8.5 out of 10. Really enjoyed this strategy game.

On a 1-10 scale we rated the game as the following: 

Design: 9
The overall look and feel of the game is great and very well done. The mechanics are not overly complicated, are easy to understand and work pretty well.

Challenge: 4
It’s a pretty straightforward though not overly challenging game. With a slower pace, being turn-based, and the ability to spawn and upgrade plenty of minions you should be able to get through it without too much trouble.

Fun: 6
Between the quirky humor, getting to run around the levels as a matriarch spawning various other alien cronies to attack and gobble up the evil humans invading your home, this was fun to play around with.

Longevity/Replay: 3
Other than a mission on the 3rd level which I found a little annoying, playing the game was enjoyable but I’m not seeing much of a reason to replay this once completed - unless you’re hunting for specific achievements.

Price: 4
At $25 it is a little higher than I’d be looking to pay for a game like this especially with only around 10 hours of playtime.

Overall Rating: 5.2  (Middling)",1522340305,1522340305,True,1,1,0.507092177867889404,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Un jeu de stratégie tour par tour très rafraichissant. L'histoire est assez simple, des humains attérissent sur une planète peuplé d'extraterreste, vous contrôlez dans un premier temps une sorte de reines qui décide de détruire ces humains.
Vous infiltrez le vaisseau et progressez au dans les étages de celui-ci.
Vous débloquez de nouvelles unités / capacités au fur et à mesur de votre progression dans l'histoire.
Vous allez découvrir une histoire sympatique avec quelques touches humouristiques qui peuvent être surprenantes au début. (Attention le jeu n'est pas disponible en français pour le moment, donc il est possible que vous passiez à côté de certain jeu de mots si vous ne comprenez pas bien l'anglais.)
Le gameplay allie le tour par tour traditionnel avec un système d'infiltration, l'IA des ennemis n'a rien de particulier mais reste correct.
Les graphismes sont plutot bon, vous trouverez également des petits détails dans le design des niveaux qui sont cool et qui je pense apporte beaucoup à l'ambiance du jeu.

Points Négatifs: Je n'ai pas encore finit le jeu mais à la vitesse où l'on avance j'ai peur que le jeu soit très court. Comme je le disais précedement on est en présence d'une bonne IA mais sans réelle difficultée.

Full review above. 

For those that don't want to watch it : Attack of the earthlings is a pretty good indie strategy game in the vein of xcom. Instead of taking the side of humanity, you play as the aliens as humanity's super corp is invading their world. 

The game focuses more on a humoristic storyline (which was pretty funny at times) with some great voice acting.

I found this game easy; not sure whether it was the settings or whether it was intentional, I chewed through the game.  Once you know the objective, you can quickly finish the levels quickly.

The enemies are a double edged sword; unlike invisible Inc you can't brute force them as they need to be taken out in one shot otherwise you will lose units, no recovery.  High health can only be taken out by the brute, fast melee at range, armoured units taken out by the stealth units.

The problem is they make monty python's holy grail knights look competant; they fail to communicate, the pattern to take them down is painfully easy and they wall hug everywhere meaning overwatch abuse is constant.

Secondly, killing enemies allows you to eat them and buy more units meaning you can have a large number of units and losing a unit (except the leader) is just a road bump unlike Invisible Inc which makes every mistake requiring a change of plan very quickly to get back on track.  At one point I had enough resourcces to rebuild a large force twice over.

Thirdly, while there are some changes during the missions; they are not enough to change the challenge.  There is no time pressure; now I know that the Security Level was contraversial in Invisible Inc, but time pressure was required to make you feel like a skilled thief.  While you have the post mission loop, it just doesn't feel enough, apart from one or two buffs, the incentive to level up units is not there, you probably could complete all the game with the base units.

So while I recommend it for the laughs and tropes it works off and the idea of reverse Xcom.  If you need the challenge, Invisible Inc wins out.

Quite a few of people have compared this to Invisible Inc. as well as XCOM but I think that where the game stands out from these is how the Biomass mechanic causes each mission to develop: it pays to be stealthy early on, when there's few of you, but each unit you can produce gradually increases your tactical options, gradually favouring more aggressive behaviour until even a dense group of enemies has no hope of stopping your onslaught!

Creativity with your units is also a major asset; I rarely felt the need to play it safe as I do in XCOM and Invisible Inc. The upgrades to your units can seem a little too powerful sometimes, but the real trick is chaining them with one another; when combined with good positioning this will allow you to handle every situation the game can throw at you.

The comedy occassionally went over my homicidal insectoid head, but attention to detail is where the game really shines here, keep your eyes peeled at all times!

在过去的不少策略游戏里，外星人往往是那个强势的一方，登陆地球，无恶不作，而奋起反抗的英雄人类一般都是主角，不知不觉，这似乎已经成为了一种正统，以一敌百的机枪勇士，脆弱但是群体出击的虫群和外星人，这些形象太过经典，也偶尔会让人觉得审美疲劳。

但在这款别具一格的《地球人侵袭》里，你操控的角色却是被夺走了家乡的虫母，一个人类的采掘公司占据了你的家，这使得我们的主角不得不奋起反击。如何潜入人类复杂的安保系统，夺回属于你的星球，成为了这款潜入策略游戏的主题。

游戏中，我们的虫后不仅拥有强悍的战斗能力，最重要的是，她有随时生产的能力。孤身一人想要挑战几十个安保守卫确实太过困难，但在吞噬了敌人的尸体获得了生物质之后，她就能创造出新的幼虫，并把他们变成巨兽，干扰者，追击者三种不同的兵种，发挥他们的优势，打败强大的敌人。

而游戏中的反派，当然就是那些腐朽昏庸的人类了。加拉托利能源公司显然是一家唯利益论的公司，游戏中，除了钱和小木马什么也不爱的老板迪克汉姆，和奸诈狡猾的管理员派克，在配音演员生动的呈现下都显得相当有趣，有一瞬间让我想起了同样侧重于搞笑情节的一款优质游戏《死亡怪兽塔》。其实员工们的对话也相当搞笑，但制作组显然在那些地方请不起配音了（。

略显可惜的是，游戏虽然在这个虫群的创意和反派配音，搞笑文案层面下足了工夫（机器人在我玩完整个游戏的时间里没看到过几次重复的段子，每一关都有比较有意思的情节和对白），策略游戏的部分却非常的苍白。

《地球人侵袭》在目前的版本里总共有七个关卡，每关虽然目标各有不同，有生存战，也有歼灭特定目标的战斗，但战术的思路大体相同，都是利用敌方看不到我方的视野优势，用先攻的优势尽可能无伤的击败对方。

游戏的血量设计明显没有给策略多少容错空间，游戏中守卫的视野是否能穿越某个物品也没有完全统一，经常出现差一步守住结果提前被打到的尴尬情况，这些小问题也给游戏的体验节奏埋下了隐患。一旦玩家策略上存在一个小的失误，原本被玩家控制的视野和防御范围很容易陷入崩溃的局面。还好游戏的自动存档做的比较充足，虽然游戏比较容易陷入需要SL试错的层面，但对游戏体验的打断没有那么严重。对游戏体验打断更严重的，可能是过一个回合时N次镜头位移带来的不必要的时间浪费。

战略层方面，《地球人侵袭》也可以说是“战略性”放弃，由于游戏体量的问题，游戏只剩下了四种兵种（包括虫后）各三个升级，且完全是线性，这也使得游戏的升级只是抉择侧重于哪个兵种，而游戏每一关的敌人配置又决定了你几乎肯定要同时使用这三种兵种，再加上完全没必要的不统一的升级费用，使得升级的目的变得有点混乱。

策略游戏部分的平庸，和“生活质量”类小设计的缺失，让游戏的体验变得有点让人焦躁，但还好有趣的点不算太少，总的来说，会是一款打折期间值得一玩的游戏，如果你是冲着游戏独特的策略视角来玩的话，还是回去玩更成熟的Invisible,Inc吧。",1518578351,1518579427,True,44,1,0.830736219882965088,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+ Map design: The story is really quite basic (you are fighting your way up a giant mining drill ship) to kill the ""baddies"" but a lot of love was put into the maps and little details, most levels also have a side objective that adds to the feeling
+ Sound/Music: Nice sound design and music (although the latter is a bit repetitive), only the two main antagonists have proper voice actors but they carry the story well.

Cons:
- Content: I beat this game in 8 hours, as of this review there is no content besides the campaign. One should ask themselves whether a well crafted but short game like this is worth 20 bucks before buying.
- No difficulty settings: This game is really not too challenging, especially if you focus on units that perform very well (imo  a bunch of OP leveled Stalkers with Disruptor support can handle anything thrown at them rather easily). People that like a big challenge and know turn based strategy games could get bored. It doesn't help that the enemy AI is extremely simple and therefore easy to predict.
- Questionable replayabilty value: One can always replay the story but I don't really see much extra worth in doing that. Sure you could try to improve your score, beat missions as fast as possible and such but for many people this game will probably something they'll maybe play through once.",1518556703,1518556703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a tactical stealth game with a heavy focus on using the different abilities of your aliens to kill and consume humans, working your way up until you can put a stop to the human invaders. The game is pretty heavy on comedy, but luckily it's almost all situational comedy about how inept the megacorp is and works rather well, especially in the later half of the game. Maybe not hilarious, but certainly makes you smile.

The gameplay boils down to a stealth-focused turn based strategy game, like Invisible Inc. There's a mother alien, Matriarch, that can spawn Drones, which differentiate into 3 distinct classes: Goliaths which are like tanky bruisers, Disrupters which are ranged specialists with blinding, and Stalkers which are trap-laying, backstabbers. At first the classes all seem distinct and very useful but the game becomes far too easy with the Stalker - which can make enemies unable to attack, get extra actions, and even deal the highest damage in the game short of a fully upgraded Matriarch.

The upgrade system is rather good though; you get score for completing levels which directly translates to upgrade points for either your Matriarch or the specialist classes. The upgrades apply to all aliens you spawn and can be easily swapped out between missions, as you don't ""buy"" upgrades so much as just select a loadout. In theory this could make some interesting remixes of missions; selecting abilities to counter threats, but you don't know what an upcoming level will have and there are too few upgrades to really specialise. Luckily the upgrades they do have are quite good and can really let you breeze through some levels - almost too easily at points. The last two levels have something resembling 'boss fights' that are a little too easy - especially if you take fully upgraded Stalkers.

However, I do recommend trying this game if you can afford it. The levels are creative, the gameplay is fun, and the story can be quite funny. I purchased this game at 10% off, at around $23USD, although I think 25 is a good price for it, and completed the game in about 8 hours.

パワードスーツと銃器で武装した人間たちはエイリアンより圧倒的に強く、狂信的で、そのうえ間抜けだ。
もしあなたがエイリアンを操ってド派手な復讐劇を繰り広げたいと思うのなら。あるいは、エイリアンの軍隊を強化して戦術的に母星を開放したいと考えるのなら。

そうではなく、物陰に隠れて間抜けにも一人で哨戒していた地球人を引きずり込んだり、換気口から突如として現れてみたり、地球人に寄生して誕生日パーティをぶち壊しにしたいと思ったなら、このゲームは値段相応におすすめだということになる。
発見即射殺に近い難易度ではあるが、ステージ中時間制限などはほぼなく、クリアターン数もステージクリア評価に関わるだけなので、じっくり敵の巡回を確認しながら進めば決して難しくはない。
また、5ターン毎オートセーブ機能に加え、ステージ中でも任意セーブができるため、死んで覚えるスタイルもありといえばありだろう。
ステージ数は全部で7つ。すべて違うギミックが組み込まれているので飽きは来ないが、やりこみ要素も前述のクリア評価だけなので、物足りなさは覚える。


エイリアンには母体となる主人公、すべてのエイリアンの成長元となる幼体を除いて三種類の変化先が存在する。
変化も含め、各ステージの最初には母体しか操作することができず、ステージ内で稼いだポイントを消費して増員、あるいは強化していくこととなる。
引き継がれるアップグレードは各ステージのクリア後にもらえる評価を消費して獲得できるが、かならず取得する共通のものが1つ、あとは母体と変化先ごとに各3つずつという少し悲しい数しかない。
前のステージに戻ってプレイすることができないため、すべてアップグレードするのは難しい。

So, this game is an interesting idea where instead of controlling the humans you control the native species (Aliens) fighting back against the invading force. It’s an XCOM style tactical turn-based strategy, so if you have played this you will know it well. 
However, off the bat you can tell it’s more of an indie game by a smaller team, but I do like the art style and presentation of it so far.
It does try and be a more comedy focused game with humans peeing, playing in water etc however for me most of this so far has landed pretty flat but there was a few let’s say chuckle moments.

Yes, the gameplay is quite simplified compared to a game like XCOM, and I found that overwatch wouldn't work for some reason maybe it was me. Also little things like massive blood stain on the floor and the guards don't notice, also I got shot and killed and instead of the guard waiting and calling for help, they all walked off back on set pattern. I would have liked to have seen my area swarmed, or like an alarm call or something.

I've not encounted any bugs as yet and no crashes, but I will continue playing and updating the review as I go. However even after my short amount of time, it gets a thumb up.

If you want to watch my first 20 minutes of gameplay check it out below.

Although everyone and their dog will likely compare this to X-COM it is actually a lot more like Invisible Inc. except killing your enemies is important here.
You control a group of insectoid aliens trying to exterminate the pesky humans who have invaded your planet with a huge drill. There are seven levels and you begin each one with your main unit the matriarch who is able to spawn more using biomass which you get from defeated humans.

This is without doubt the best aspect of the game. You really feel like you are controlling an alien swarm, creeping through the enemy base, picking off guards one by one and constantly growing in strength and numbers until you become an unstoppable force. Humans have superior firepower and the home turf advantage so you must use ambush tactics and strategy to prevail.

The core mechanics are solid, the turn based system is done well (which is rare in indie titles IMO). It looks a bit simple at first but has a surprising strategical depth. There aren't a lot of units or upgrades but they are all viable and necessary, there is nothing so overpowered to outshine all the other options nor is there anything so underwhelming that you never want to use it.

Graphics and sounds are good enough. They are nothing spectacular but there are no glaring flaws either. Maybe some of the animations are a bit clunky but it's a minor issue.

If you are a veteran of the genre you will likely find the game a little too easy but because your enemies powerful throughout the game it never gets to the point where you can just send in your overpowered units and win, you always have to use your head.

It's a bit short, the seven levels provide about 7-8 hours of pure game (not counting reloading and trying to get some of the achievements).

I left the humor for the last. It is...there. The corporation you are trying to take out is cartoonishly greedy, evil and incompetent. I liked some of the more subtle quips like the little tweets you can read on the displays and a few scenes you run into in the game but the ""funny banter"" between the two main antagonists (the protagonist does not speak) was overdone. Yeah, I get it, the boss is incompetent, no need to hammer the fact home by the 54th hilariously funny little scene.

You'll probably love this if : You like turn based tactical combat games.
You'll hate this if you think : Turn based games suck. Stealthy approaches are tedious. You need strategic dynamic campaigns for your tactical warfare ( XCOM, Total War Series etc )

The Good : Solid turn based tactical game.
The Not So Good : Short. Very little to zero replayability. 25$ Price point vs Content. If you're conservative with your gaming dollar, you might want to hold off.

Detail -
Attack of the Earthlings is a solid, if simple, turn based tactical combat game in the style of XCOM, where the roles are reversed from the common setup and you get to play the Aliens fighting off the ""evil"" invading Earthlings. Unlike XCOM the game is purely a tactical combat simulator and nothing else - there is no strategic level of bases, logistics and management. The tone of the game is one of cariacture comedy, particularly British comedy , no surprise given the team is based in Scotland. But don't expect any grim dark horror vibes creeping in that some Alien attack tropes bring to the table.

As the Aliens you are mostly a stealth based melee force pitted against a mostly non stealth based range force. So the typical trope for this kind of setup. Claws v Guns ! There are a handful of different units and capabilities on each side - just enough to give you something to think about - which means there is some flexibility in approach for you as a player.

The game itself plays out as a linear campaign of several static maps on which to fight following a progressive story of your journey to the very top of the Earthlings ship/drilling rig. As a result the game follows a scripted narrative path, with voice acting filling in the cut scene moments that progress the story. 

Overall the quality of the game has the feel of a good indie production - you're not going to see AAA levels of polish and FX here, but the game is solid and has more of a pro lo-fi quality about it. There are a few bugs and annoyances in game, but I've not experience anything that's more than a minor inconvenience, so QA seems pretty good. All in all, an enjoyable turn based tactical sim - but with one caveat.

The caveat is game length ( and replability ). I didn't rush the game and completed it in just under 8 hours. At its release price and indie quality level this feels to me somewhat short. Closely related to the game length is the issue of replayability. Despite being a tactical turn based sim, the game has next to zero replayability because you're playing through a scripted narrative short campaign where each mission you start anew, with your single unit. The story is always the same, and there are no ( or almost no ) consequences that carry over from prior missions. This feels like a bit of a missed opportunity by the devs to either change the campaign a bit to be more dynamic and have some level of strategic gameplay, or, failing that, add in a procedural mission creator / campaign generator to significantly bump up play time and replayability. Multiplayer for this would also be a great benefit here, a versus or co-op mode on procedural maps would transform the game experience, whilst from a dev persective re-using a lot of the work that's already gone into the game production.

On balance, I think the game with its scripted linear format needed a much longer campaign - double the length. Or failing that needed to add some dynamic replayability to the mix.

Overall a recommendation - but, given the amount of content and price point, if you are conservative with your gaming dollar you may want to look elsewhere.",1518346464,1518346464,True,89,2,0.896069169044494629,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Some major differences:

1. No RNG.  If you attack (or are attacked), you deal (or take) a flat amount of damage.  This means that AotE doesn't ever feel unfair, but it also means that it doesn't have those bullet-sweating moments where you pull through by sheer luck.

2. A real AP pool.  The attack actions are still separate from standard AP, but you don't just have one movement and one attack (and you can always move after an attack).

3. Focused on stealth and close combat.  You get some ranged attacks, but most of the focus is on getting in close without alerting the enemy.

4. The campaign is made up of pre-built missions.  You're not managing a campaign to fend off earthlings, like you are in XCOM; in AotE, you're just ascending the levels of one ship and trying to get rid of them.

To me, the gameplay feels more like Shadowrun than XCOM.  It was still very satisfying, though, and the lack of RNG just kept me from getting angry at the game.

My biggest complaint is that there's not really much to do after the campaign.  I could go back and try to improve my score on previous levels, but that's about all.  I wish there were procedurally generated levels just so I could keep playing the game.  The holy grail would be an XCOM-like campaign where you manage a team and have to repel multiple ships; but even just being able to generate and play through individual levels (preferably with a seed to share with friends) would give me some more humans to kill after the campaign is over.

The other main complaint that I have is that there isn't really a difficulty setting.  I'd appreciate even having a slider for enemy vision cone range, so I could increase/decrease the challenge for myself.  Part of the reason that I want to keep playing is that you can fly through the game at a breakneck pace if you learn to abuse enemies' poor vision.

If there was a continuation like using their escape caps to go up in space dock with their spacecraft / space station and continue the adventure where they had been a good continuation!

And if they look crazy they can add that another spacecraft is coming to see why no one heard of it and from there boarding their ships.

Attack of the Earthlings is a humorous turn-based strategy game from indie developers, Team Junkfish, of Monstrum fame.

Attack of the Earthlings tells the story of an interstellar space ship, one of many in the greedy Galactoil corporation's fleet, which lands on an alien planet and begins drilling for rare minerals and resources at a tremendous rate, uncaring of the effects on the planet's indigenous inhabitants.

Unknown to the Galactoil corporate lackeys on board the ship, the Matriarch, an alien with powerful and dangerous abilities, witnesses the ship's landing, and wanton destruction of many of her species in the process, and decides to do something about it -- violently.

You play the Matriarch, an angry alien on a mission of vengeance against the human incursion.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
First impressions are good: an attractive, if slightly retro-looking, title screen with music reminiscent of a spooky circus, almost like something from Ghostbusters. Menus are well skinned and easy to use and everything fits well together. Upon starting a new game, the introductory cut scene maintains the high production values; it's in cartoon format with only basic, animations, but it's well done and sets the scene well.

The game is rendered in full 3D, but only permits camera rotation by 90 degrees, which is a bit of a shame. At least the zoom range is good, though for tactical play you'll spend most of the time zoomed out anyway. I found key-based camera panning to be way too sensitive when I first started playing, but at some point that dislike evaporated; I have no problem with it now. Graphics have a good feel to them, consistent with the title screen image, though the levels do feel a little bit 'samey' after a while; some different textures and assets wouldn't go amiss, though I should say that the current presentation does provide a consistent portrayal of the Galactoil ship.

Character models are good -- though perhaps not enough variation in civilians in particular -- and animations are convincing. The game doesn't quite manage to promote a feeling of kinship with the Matriarch and her progeny, but they're more likeable than their human prey, in any case. Apart from the opening animation, the remaining cut scenes are all scripted in game.

The interface is intuitive and easy to use, though I did initially get a bit mixed up with when to press the left mouse button instead of the right. There is a few grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its"", semicolons instead of colons, and missing commas, but overall the writing is pretty good. I also noticed a graphical glitch with the floor tiles occasionally drawn on top of the flamethrower flames.

Sound-wise, the music is quirky and spooky, as mentioned. Sound effects are great, with grunts, screams, squishy noises, and various weapons, though they do sound a bit isolated in cases, as if they were recorded separately and then pasted in (which is of course exactly what was done). The game is only partially voiced, with Pecker in particular warranting a mention -- he's brilliant -- but much of the script from other characters is only text, with grunting noises over the top. That said, it's still nicely done.

There are plenty of display options so if you have any problems running with everything turned up to full there's lots of room to optimise performance. I didn't have any issues running everything at maximum at 1920x1080 on a GTX 1070.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Attack of the Earthlings is a turn-based strategy game; it could be called 'squad-based', though your 'squad' on each level here comprises a single alien who can spawn others as she consumes biomass from fallen humans. Even so, the game basics are roughly the same as most other games in the genre: each of your troops has a number of points to spend on moving, attacking, and using special abilities, which you do in whatever order you desire. Once you've taken all actions for your troops you end the turn and play cycles to the enemy's turn. Line of sight, overwatch, fog of war, ... all the usual squad-based TBS components are present here and function essentially as you'd expect.

Apart from using biomass to create new 'grunts', the game also offers a few extensions to the tried-and-true formula. First, you can also use biomass to upgrade your grunts to one of the three upgradeable types: ranged, stealth, or tank. Each has its own special abilities. Attacking an enemy -- or even encountering a human or opening a door -- can produce noise that will alert other humans, prompting them to investigate. And, for taking out powerful enemies, you can synchronise attacks among multiple troops, potentially allowing you to prevent counter attacks. It's unfortunately that this only works on basic attacks, though; you can't synchronise special abilities, which reduces your tactical options significantly.

Once you enter the game proper, it offers you a brief tutorial level that allows for a couple of jokes and provides instruction in the game's basic controls and gameplay rules; for anyone familiar with the genre, there's not much to surprise you here. It's all implemented well, though -- well, mostly; pathing can be a bit stupid -- and the generous dose of humour helps to keep the game interesting.

There are seven core levels in the Galactoil ship, from the drills up to the board room. After the first couple you'll have encountered all the basic enemy types and will have all of your troops available (once you collect enough biomass), so after that it's mostly just using the same tactics over again on different maps. Each level starts you off with just the Matriarch, no matter how many units you had left on the previous one. Performance is awarded with mutagen, which you spend on troop upgrades. While I love that you can respec, it does limit replayability a bit, since you can see everything in one play. 

There are a few little niggles here and there. First, there's no map, making some of the larger levels a bit of a pain to navigate. It's not a glaring omission -- the initial fog of war is replaced by a slightly darkened rendering of the main walls and room layout of the area once you pass out of sight -- but it still would have been nice to have. I also had one crash, but it was only on exiting to desktop, so really it didn't matter at all.

I think the game's biggest weakness is its limited lifespan. With only seven levels and five troop types (four of which are upgradeable with three upgrades each), unless you're an achievement hunter you're unlikely to get more than 10 hours' play out of the game. The game tries to mix it up a bit with time/turn limits on some levels, some repetition required to learn guard routes and best paths, and a few unique enemies, which make sense in plot terms, but don't really work that well in game.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
Pros:
+ Good sense of humour
+ Unicorns. And sharks!
+ Steam Achievements

Cons:
- Very limited
- Some frustrating levels

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Attack of the Earthlings is a fun distraction, but it begins to become a bit of a chore as you progress. I didn't enjoy the second-to-last level at all, and now that I'm on the final level I just don't think I can be bothered playing. I'll leave it installed and will probably get around to it one of these days, but on such a short game it's a bit disappointing.

The core mechanics are fun and the humour is great. Production values are high and the game is well balanced. But there's just not enough variation; once you get to about level four you've seen almost all that the game has to offer, and what you haven't seen are most of the frustrating bits.

If you're a fan of turn-based, squad-based strategy, then pick it up for a bit of fun. Just don't expect too much.
