[h1]THE LOWDOWN:[/h1]
Dead Sky is an indie action game that places you (and some friends) in a typical survival zombie apocalypse setting.  It has two modes; a single-player campaign and a coop wave survival mode.  The campaign is very short with only a handful of levels, loosely linked by a typical story and mostly played as a top-down twin stick shooter.  Other levels include; driving a car in third-person and blasting zombies in a rail-shooter played from the view of a helicopter gunner.  Objectives include; getting from A to B, defending the base and killing x zombies.

The coop wave survival mode consists of several maps, especially designed for one to four players where the goal is survive as many waves as possible.  Depending on the gamemode, gameplay consists allow picking up and using only one weapon at a time, limited ammunition and resources which can be converted to defenses, sentries or used as upgrades to the character.

[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]
+ Well made survival mode.
+ Solid customizable controls.
+ Coop gameplay is fun and addictive.

[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]
- Its unfinished!
- Limited map design.
- Very short uninspired singleplayer campaign.  Seems rushed and cobbled together at the last minute to provide some semblence of content.
- Sharp learning curve.  Very difficult to get into.
- Requires manual multiplayer connectivity.  Does not allow coop connection through Steam.
- Impossible to find anyone playing it for coop.
- Wave survival sometimes becomes bugged after reaching level 18.

[h1]AND THE ORDINARY:[/h1]
* Cartoony graphics are okay if nothing special.    
* A mixed bag of achievements.  Some are probably not achieveable or could even be broken (unverified).
* Decent range of well-modelled weapons and character upgrades.

[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]
Overall there is very little to say about Dead Sky.  It possesses the very basic elements to make up what could have been a decent indie game if the developer had had more time or money to complete their project.  It goes to show how badly the game sold or has been played as there are only 1000 or so entries in the leaderboards.

The singleplayer campaign feels unfinished.  It amounts to six levels cobbled together that seem to represent the various modes of gameplay that the developer had in mind when they conceived the idea for this game.  The coop maps are okay for a quick run through although only one map is built to be played solo.  The others require two or three players to successfully tackle.  The characters and backgrounds are well drawn and there are a few different zombie models. Even though they remind me of Unity assets, its quite a pleasant looking, colourful game.  The controls are very solid.  While game mechanics actually quite work well given that you can only carry one useable weapon with limited ammo, you can pick more up if another dead zombie drops some.  Otherwise you can grab a different weapon.

All in all the game is playable - though just.  The thing is... I really hated this when I first played it.  I found it to be such a tragic and at times frustrating experience that its was just not worth bothering with in my opinion.  However... upon revisiting the game (to get my monies worth), I actually found that in a bizarre way the game mechanics actually work well together.  After completing what there was of the campaign which took a while to get to grips with, to my eternal surprise I found the wave survival mode to be quite fun and addictive.  However it took me over a year to find someone to actually coop with.  If the community was active, there is no doubt I would still be playing this game.  Despite its faults.  

However if youre interested in the slightest in Dead Sky I would have to say quite clearly - avoid it!  I would love to recommend the game but there are better ones out there.  Nation Red being a fine example or Alien Swarm which is similar to some degree and is also free.  I guess it will remain a guilty pleasure of mine - one I will unfortunately never get to finish! :(",1503435986,1616960712,False,17,0,0.685030519962310791,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Dead Sky ist ein Zombie-Baller-Spiel wo es die Hauptaufgabe ist sich durch Levels zu bewegen
oder eine bestimmte Zeit zu überleben und natürlich Zombies zu töten.

+ einige gute Ideen
+ macht irgendwie schon Laune

- schlechte Kamera
- schlechte Waffenbalance 
- schlechte Steuerung
- keine Online-Server
- sehr kurzer Singleplayer ca.40min

From what I could get through in the single player, it appears there are two phases. First a typical top-down shooter. You walk through generic, uninspired levels and kill zombies along the way with very little threat. 

The second stage is the tower-defense/swarm segment, this is the completely broken part.  The swarm begins immediately, so you never really get a chance to prepare your defenses. If you get your first sentry down, you already have a huge backup of enemies. Fine, can handle them. The further into the wave you get, the more enemies/specials run at you. You MIGHT be able to get the third turret down at the cost of another.

In short, the game has a lot of good mechanics I do enjoy, but the whole game is just marred by dull, uninspired level design and poor choices that make what could be an awesome game far too dull and needlessly difficult to enjoy. The game has a single player campaign, but boasts online multiplayer through a server connection, so you'll need friends and someone to host.

I'll start with the good. The game plays well enough and a controller is recommended. You have a trigger to shoot enemies, a left stick to walk and a right stick to aim. You have a flashlight that you can turn on or off, but since it never runs low on power, why turn it off? Then there's one button to reload and another to interact with things. The interactions are limited and most of the time you're picking up a weapon with the button. Other times you can pull a wall switch using the button.

To make the game more interesting, you can use the interact button to pick up and place objects that you'll find or forge using scrap. I say forge, but its just paying to have it made. There are gun sentries, flame sentries, barbed wire barricades, bear traps and so on. It turns the game into a tower defense that I rather enjoy, even if the levels are just too dull and simple to get much out of them. The companion, and weapons do their job with the only catch being that you still need to collect things from the corpses. As well as it does its job, i question the choice of targets that the sentries make. When something is closer to them, they chose to shoot a further target. Perhaps that's just closer to their view cone. Whatever the reason, I'd shoot the enemy beating me up than the one further away.

You'll find a wide array of foes, most of which are inspired or taken from Resident Evil. If you're going to take something, borrow from the best. There are arm stretching mutants, zombie attack dogs, swat zombies, electric zombies and bosses with sack heads wielding chainsaws. Other than that, there are acid sputters, exploding foes, typical zombies and a giant worm of a boss that burrows out of the ground.

There's a diverse array of things to do with good simple mechanics to do them, such as driving sections, shooting sections, on the fly tower defense and boring turret sections. Shooting zombies from a helicopter the size of ants with a mini gun designed to shoot from the side rather than top down is a needless chore. Having a cool down mechanic only prolongs the experience.

None of it is all that fun. Shooting feels weak. You can get shotguns, flame throwers and machine guns, but it never affects the zombies in a satisfying way. They all feel equally ineffective and the zombies have the same animation cycle, so if you can get a group of them together, watch as they conga line in sync with one another. The rail gun feels effective, it goes straight through a lot of zombies and everything off screen too. To balance it out, you need to reload after each shot. Chainsaws put you in harms way, because when you get close to a zombie, they can still hit you.

You start with a trusty pistol that has unlimited ammunition, but a limited clip. Shooting feels sluggish, like its slow to empty an entire magazine. I would say that's your character taking aim. Each of the weapons has a laser sight to ensure that you'll hit a target if your aim is correct. Of course weapons like the rocket launcher fire projectiles, so they have a chance to miss.

There are alternate weapons that get dropped at random by zombies. You can carry one at a time and there is no way to switch between them. If you get a new weapon, you need to drop your old one. There's limited ammunition and reloading takes quite a while. Of course, in a zombie apocalypse I'd probably take just as long to switch out a magazine. When your alternate weapon runs out of ammo its back to the pistol

Dead Sky has a few glaring issues. Nothing game breaking, but they could be improved. The first is its awful voice acting. I'd rather have bad voice acting than no voice acting, but this was a step above abysmal.There's even an announcer to tell you pick ups like ""Flame thrower,"" and ""Shotgun.""

The second is the lack of checkpoints for a game with no health. To some people this is a feature, until you feel just how dull the game is with its basic level design such as a cabin in the woods with a square lawn and an underground sewer that's just a single passage with a slimy center to walk through. Having to do these over if you fail becomes a chore. If its too much, there's always a different level of difficulty.

One of the biggest sins is the camera distance. The game keeps the screen centered on you with only about 35 - 40% to the north, which becomes an issue. I'd rather see more of where I'm going, but I suppose that's a personal preference. This way you can see zombies creep up behind you long before they get to you.

Speaking of getting to you, sometimes the zombies are a distance away when they hit you. This is demonstrated with the game over screen that freezes the game as is so you can clearly see the distance. For a game that has no health at least early on, this is a big issue. You'll have to compensate and just stay away from zombies, but some of these creatures will chase you faster than you can walk.

With all the negatives out there, the single player campaign ends with a cliffhanger of what looks to be a level aboard a train followed with ""to be continued."" While its best to leave an audience wanting more, it feels so short and bland that its an insult to anyone that would get that far. I'd rather have a remix of areas with previously used assets than just have it cut off after six quick chapters; one of which is just a turret section. Its all just to drive you into the multiplayer.

Multiplayer is relegated to a horde mode with waves of zombies. There's no way to select from games and that hurts the fun. You need to know a server IP to join, so you need a friend, but at least you can purchase a four pack for less than the price of three.

When you do play the game online, its a simple survival that borders on tower defense and the best mode it can be. You select from four different uninspiring and small maps that are a mere square of land and you stay alive by purchasing upgrades like health and defense. You lay down traps and turrets. Then you strive to survive. It feels just as tacked on as the entire single player campaign.

Dead Sky is a budget game that manages to feel cheap rather than a good game. It has all the right mechanics, but none of the fun. With the extensive diversity it has, its never fleshed out. You use it once then destroy and that sums up the entire experience.",1445083771,1445101292,False,13,0,0.671924829483032227,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Die Musik (Hardrock) ist nicht ausstellbar in den Optionen. Es lässt sich nur die Masterlautstärke herunter setzen, dadurch sind aber alle Geräusche im Spiel von betroffen! Ein No-GO. Die Musik läuft in einer Endlosschleife. Verschiedene Soundtracks sind vorhanden.

[b]GRAFIK[/b]
Die Grafik ist ganz gut gelungen und passt zum Setting. Auf maximalen Einstellungen sehen die Texturen größtenteils scharf aus und sind stimmig. Die Shader-Effekte können sich sehen lassen, sind aber nur guter Durchschnitt. Die Beleuchtung ist meist passend gewählt. Trotzdem ist es stellenweise doch arg dunkel in einigen Abschnitten. Es lässt sich kein Gamma-Wert in den Einstellungen einstellen oder ändern! 

[b]WAFFEN[/b]
Es gibt eine brauchbare Anzahl an unterschiedlichen Waffentypen. MGs, Shotgun, Geschütztürme, Stacheldraht, Bärenfalle und einige andere Dinge. Die Waffen Schussgeräusche sind gut. Als negativ empfinde ich die Hitbox, vor allem im Nahkampf wenn man getroffen wird, obwohl man meint weit genug entfernt zu sein. 

[b]SPIELUMFANG[/b]
Es gibt einen Einzelspielermodus und Multiplayer. Die Spielzeit ist recht kurz, wenn man einfach nur das Ende erreichen möchte. Positiv ist das man im Koop spielen kann - definitiv zu empfehlen. Prinzipiell richtet sich dieses Spiel eher an Koop-Spieler und diejenigen die gerne eine Herausforderung suchen, denn das bietet das Spiel. Wer möchte kann sich an den Bestenlisten versuchen.

First off... HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!! :-)

Dead Sky is a top down, twin stick shooter at heart.  It's simple arcade mayhem with a couple of other other game types thrown in for fun.  The game has lot's & lot's of zombies of all different types and speeds!  It's pretty fun, but very short!  That's really all that matters to me in a game like this.  The fun factor!  To me, it's the perfect Halloween party game!  :-)

I really don't see what everyone is complaining about other than the slowdown which can be avoided if you stand still for a moment, but it is annoying at times.  The screen will freeze for a second and keep doing it randomly until you kill the enemy causing the slowdown.  It usually happens when certain zombie types spawn or when they attack the cabin. Kill them off and the lag will stop!  Sometimes reloading helps too!  So there are some bugs.  That cannot be denied!

[*] Graphics:
The graphics are decent and are somewhat cartoony like the game Crackdown.  There is a black outline around the character models.  It fits the game well.  There are enough options on the game menu to scale the graphic settings for many different video cards.  The lighting and animations are good.  Day and night cycle is great!  Fullscreen and windowed modes supported.

[*] Sound:
Sound is okay.  Nothing grinding or annoying.  Voiceovers vary in quality.  Music is cool at times.  Gun sounds and explosions are all done well.

[*] Game Modes:
Single player mode consists of 3 different game types.  Top down 3rd person shooting & driving.  You get to run zombies over in a car.  Very simple and easy.  Then there is a FPS sequence from a helicopter going in a circle around a city intersection.   You get to shoot zed's and a boss.

Multiplayer (MP) consists of 4 small coop maps to choose from with a store/workbench to buy stuff in the middle of the map.  I played MP alone, but it is kind of hard alone.  You really need to pickup as much salvage as you can to buy turrets and other items.  One review I read said the turrets only last a few seconds and that is NOT true.  They last a very long time if you protect them from damage!  

The single player campaign is very short, but fun.  The game is really made for multiplayer though, but does feel unfinished and rough around the edges at times.  It's pretty basic.  Kill zombies as fast as you can and stay alive as long as you can!

[*] Controls:
Controls are pretty tight and work well.  You aim with the mouse and walk with WASD.  You CAN shoot while walking which is always nice!  So you can walk in any direction and shoot in any direction at the same time.  Pickup and place items with ""E"".  There are a few onscreen icons to click on to change items.  The controls are NOT clunky and are responsive.  Key binding and gamepad support.

[*] Gameplay:
It's an arcade game.  If you go in thinking that way, the limited ammo in the weapons is forgiving.  You get different random weapons all the time and sometimes must choose which one you want.  Usually the closer weapon is the best weapon! lol :-) 

You walk at a good pace and faster than most of the enemies!  I have never gotten stuck or caught on objects.  

All the weapons are cool and feel powerful, but are pretty standard and limited.  Ammo usually lasts until a new weapon drops, or you just go back to your starting pistol which has unlimited ammo.  The flamethrower is awesome!  Even your starting pistol shoots pretty fast and is fairly strong.  Two or three good head shots usually does the job!   Just keep your weapons reloaded at all times!

Reloading is NOT a chore and becomes second nature!  You have to reload in many games anyway.  Now, if you successfully reload ""Gears of War"" style, you get a 30% increase in damage for that clip.  It's pretty easy to do and doesn't distract from gameplay at all.  If you miss the mark trying to get the 30% damage increase, you get penalized with a slight delay in reload time, but only like an additional second or two.  Your gun doesn't jam or anything like that.  

Note that you DO NOT  have to try and get the damage bonus.  You can just hit the ""R"" key once and reload with normal damage ammo.  It only takes a couple of seconds to do a normal reload.  If you do want the 30% damage increase, you must hit the ""R"" key to start the reload process, then hit the ""R"" key again at the right moment to get the 30% damage increase.  It's not that hard and I usually get it every time now!

Slowdown is there and it does distract from the gameplay at times.  If they had fixed the slowdown problems, the game would have gotten much better reviews IMO.

[*] Conclusion:
It's a fun zombie survival game IMO and could have been awesome with a little more work!  The game does have major issues that can be a game breaker for some people, but it can be a lot of fun IMO!!!  I recommend this game to diehard zombie fans ONLY!  Are you a diehard zombie fan?

Right now, at $2.50, it is a great deal IMO!  Get it while it's hot! :-)  It's going back to $5 Nov 3rd!!!  I'm going to play it some more and maybe update this review.  I've gotten worse games that cost a lot more!  I give it 3 stars out of 5!

しかしその後何度か再挑戦してみた所、問題の箇所をなんとかクリアー出来たので改めてこのレビューを書いています。
クリアーしてみて分かりました、
「このゲームは未完成な上にクソゲーです」
序盤だと思ってた所をクリアーしたらエンディングが始まりました。
SpectraBallの開発が作ったゲームと言う事で、個人的に非常に期待してたので残念です。ボリューム的にもゲームシステム的にもバランス調整的にも未完成なこのゲームを購入する価値はありません。

ゲームとしては、見下ろしシューターとしてマップを進んで行く部分と、タワーディフェンス的に特定の場所に陣取って防御装置を買い込みつつ防衛する部分の二種類で構成されています。ヘリや車に乗るシーンもありますがただ付け足してあるだけでゲームとしての内容はありません。ストーリー進行に沿ってシューターになったりTDになったりといった感じです。そしてこのゲームは、この二つのモード両方に問題点を抱えています。

まず、見下ろしシューターのマップでは一切回復アイテム等は無く、死ぬとマップの最初からやり直しになります。またキャラクターの体力は数度の攻撃で死んでしまう程しか無く、ワンミスが致命傷となります。カメラの描画範囲も極端に狭いので、足の速い敵や遠距離攻撃を持った敵が現れると、殆ど対処する時間はありません。しかし逆に、普通のゾンビは足が遅く余程無茶をしない限りほぼダメージを食らう事はありません。普通のゾンビを倒すのはただ退屈で、強い敵が現れると理不尽にダメージを食らうと言った印象で、どちらも全く楽しさが存在しないのです。

次にタワーディフェンスのマップです。このモードでの問題点はひたすら時間がない事に尽きます。TDと言っても基本の操作は見下ろしシューターと同じです。違うのは敵を倒す事でお金（？）を入手でき、防御装置、つまりTDで言うタワーを購入したりキャラクターを強化する事が出来る点です。しかし、この購入や強化を行う時間が用意されてないのです。
Waveなどの概念もなく購入や強化を行う間も敵は次々と現れるので、購入してる間にプレイヤーが殺される、購入してる間にタワーが壊れるなど、はっきり言ってどう考えてこのゲームを作ってあるのか全く理解出来ないバランスになっています。複数人でプレイするバランスをそのままシングルプレイに持ってきてるのか、開発者が操作に慣れすぎて超速な操作を当たり前だと思って開発したのか、とにかくタワーを購入して設置すると言う事が難しいと言うのはTDとしてどうなのでしょうか。
また、このモードでは敵がお金を落としますが、普通のゲームでは良くあるキャラクターにお金などが吸い込まれていく効果が無いので、正確にその上を歩いて拾う必要があります。ひっきりなしに現れる敵の中をお金を拾って歩くと確実にダメージを受けます。後半は遠距離攻撃してくる敵なども多く、ダメージを受けるかどうかは運次第みたいな所もあります。

上記の両モードで共通する問題点として武器システムがあります。このゲームは敵を倒すとランダムでたまに武器を落とす様になっています。この武器を拾えるのは良いのですが、拾うとその武器しか使えなくなってしまうのです。
初期状態では弾数無限のハンドガンを持っており、マシンガンやショットガンを拾うとハンドガンは使えなくなります。武器は基本的に拾ったら弾が切れるまで使い捨てるしかありません。その為強い敵に良い武器を温存しておこうだとか、出来るだけハンドガンを使って弾を節約しようなどと言う戦略性は生まれず、ただ良い武器を拾えた瞬間だけ少し楽になると言う意味の分からないシステムになっています。
ちなみに武器をその場に捨てるとハンドガンを使う事が出来る様になるので、一応弾の節約っぽい事は出来ます。ただこれを実際にやってみると隙が大きく非常に面倒なだけでゲームが更につまらなくなってしまいます。
また、武器を拾うのには一々アクションボタンを押す必要があります。取得済みと同種の武器を拾うと弾数が増えるのですが、この場合もボタンを押す必要がありこれが意外と鬱陶しいシステムです。マシンガンを使っていてマシンガンの弾を補給したいのに拾ってみたらショットガンだったり、補給したい武器の近くに違う種類の武器が落ちていて間違って拾ってしまったりと細かくストレスがたまります。せめて同種の武器は自動取得にしてあれば解決出来たはずの問題点だと思います。

マルチプレイは全てTDモードで協力プレイ用のマップになっています。ただ、このレビュー執筆時点でプレイヤーは存在しませんでした。一応一人プレイも可能なので一通りプレイして見ましたが、正直シングルプレイよりもマルチの一人プレイの方が面白かったです。
マルチプレイでは敵の襲撃にWaveの概念があり、敵を倒して稼いだお金でタワーを買う時間が用意されています。・・・なんでこのシステムをシングルに持ってこなかったりのか意味不明です。また、パワーアップアイテムなどもシングルプレイでは出現しない様々な物がドロップするようで、ゲームプレイに多少のバリエーションを与えています。
ただ、マルチプレイの方が楽しいとは言っても、一人でプレイ可能なのは実質1マップのみです。他のマップは防衛目標が複数あったり、防衛目標が広かったりと一人ではカバーしきれない設定になっています。
マルチプレイに関しては一緒にプレイする人が居れば面白いかもしれません。

このゲームは全体としてやりたい事は面白そうだと思うし、もしかすると協力プレイなどでは面白くなるのかも知れないと思わせる部分はあります。しかし、少なくともシングルプレイではただ作りの荒さしか感じられず、面白い部分は何一つとしてありません。理不尽に感じるバランスはただひたすらプレイする気を削いでいきます。同じ開発のSpectraBallに対する思い入れもあるので、自分のレビューは必要以上に厳しくなってる可能性もありますが、やはりどう考えてもこのゲームは未完成です。絶対にお勧めしません。",1396305715,1396305715,False,8,2,0.543545365333557129,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Here's the problems:
Your basic weapon is a pistol, weak and slow. For every weapon pick up you gain two clip with it, after that you drop back to pistol. There is no weapon select even if you take that one extra weapon. The two clip is a joke especially for the railgun and the rocket launcher as these clips consist of 1 shot!.

The reload minigame is a nice feature but not in a game where millions of zombies running towards you.

The shop system is broken as time not stops not even in the SP campaign. The upgrades are even more fun as you have to go deeper in the shop's menu in real time. For your hard earned money (scrap-metal) the bought turrets last only a few seconds on normal difficulty (haven't tried harder).

The screen is too small. The charging type enemies are nearly impossible to avoid as you don't have that small reaction. The poison bomb fatty's poison area is annoyingly high and unavoidable.
The best thing that there are two enemies that can and will ATTACK FROM OUTSIDE THE SCREEN (at least on 16: 9 resolution) giving you no chance to do anything. The spitters and the megaannoying pullers are just terrible. The best happens when 2 pullers come, one pulls you out and the second pulls from the first, than the first pulls from the second and they start ping-ponging with me and i cannot do a f@@@@ing thing.

Sure it's an MP game but they were nice enough to put in an SP campaign THAT HAS 6 LEVELS! These: 1 is a training defense mission, easy / 2 you are invincible and must drive a car and kill zombies / 3 you must defense a cabin (!) that you abandon when a helicopter comes. If you wait enough and don't take the copter, you can see the bosses too and dies very fast. 4 The only mission that is good, must go through a sewer. 5 Again invincible in the copter shooting helpless zombies down there. 6 Defense mission so hard had to try it 6 times on easy difficulty. The winning screen is just an offense. Seems like a new level but it's not, it's the end.

For a real MP top-down shooter choose Nation Red, for SP choose Nation Red (yes, that's SP is very good though there is no real campaign) or Dead Horde.",1395594737,1395594842,False,4,0,0.543540418148040771,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Even at the lowest graphic's details, that makes the game somewhat near of a bunch of pixels if not worse, this game can still suck half of my computer's CPU... and i play far more heavier games, that my PC handle a lot better than this.

For the in game issue, there isn't much to complain about: the reload function is one of the most interesting things i found here, but, finding other weapons (other than the pistol) from the floating space above killed zombies (over the scrap, another interesting thing of this game, which is the resource of building towers and stuff), doesn't sound really right for me... i mean, a zombie that drops a bazooka?

Next, the game is insanely hard even on normal difficult, because of the bugs i'm gonna explain, which need you to be costantly concentrated on it.
If you are on a higher height than the zombies, you can't aim your gun down to shoot them.
The camera is in third person, very badly modeled, since you can't see from upper and lower the incoming zombies, expecially when the camera zooms, and you have very few chance to react on time because of that.
Every level also have the same encounters, so just knowing what's next is enough to win the game, if you got problems on progressing.
And, to end, there isn't a way to heal yourself from taken damage, as i seen.

I had more fun playing Dead Horde instead of this. This MUST have a lot of fixes, because, as the game is now, it's worse than an Early Access.",1395434456,1404640327,False,4,0,0.544372320175170898,0,False,False,False,False,,,

1. Игра рассчитана целиком и полностью на кооператив и онлайн
2. Перед нами очередное подобие Dead Horde и Primal Fears (которые являются крайне унылыми клонами Alien Shooter, Crimsonland), приправленная одним уровнем, где мы едем по прямой! и пострелушками за турелью (уровень где даже нельзя проиграть)
3. Сингловая компания - 6 коротеньких уровней, которые проходятся по 5-20 минут (замечу, к игре даже не написано ""Ранний доступ"" - а, после прохождения обещают со временем добавить новых)
4. Есть элементы тавер дефенс, но они реализованы лишь в первой миссии (к слову - ЕДИНСТВЕННЫЙ хороший уровень в игре, где перед нами задача защитить дом, от толп зомби и монстров, перед этим расставив турели)
5. Если присмотеться к поведению, и типу монстров - все они скопированы с Left 4 Dead (просто фэйспалм)

This is the worst zombie game I have ever played none bar, everything is awful about it, just everything, every single effing thing in this fails at life, this is a disaster of a game that does not deserve to be played let alone be on steam, there is litterly nothing here thats why! Theres 6 single player missions that last you 10 mintues or less and the last mission is so ultra bullshit you have to crank it down to easy to pass it... yea, its one of those games.

This would have never got on steam if it wasent greenlit for being a zombie game and looking decent, this is totally unfinished and should be a super cheap early access or alpha build, I finished this whole game 20 MINUTES! you should never have to pay 10 bucks for 20 minutes of a terrible game, never ever. Im never going to ask my friends to get it either so its not like ill be playing co op in a hurry, tho I highly doubt theres any way for that to be better really.

If the amount of upset dissapointed rage im clearly expression right now isent enough to turn you away from this game ill make my point even more clearl, every zombie you kill drops 'special' weapons at random and they have very little ammo and are basically pointless, theres no auto reload so you have to do it MANUALLY every freaking 12 shots, it gets tedious and just annoying, and oh yea every zombie drops one measly metal, when upgrades and turrets cost up to 70 metal or more to buy from random people, yea not even fair, icing on the cake is tho you dont regen health and there is no health kits, no way to buy health, no power ups, NOTHING, yea you heard me... games have ways to replenish your health for a darn effing reason, god these developers really need to get some content in this game or there is going to be so many angry people falling for this being a big decent zombie game as it appears like i did then feeling ripped off cas of eff all content.

- unbalanced, under- or overpowered weapons
- bad item placement, and drops disappear to fast (why at all? make it an option ffs)
- you can't switch between weapons. use it or drop it (wich is especially annoying with the line above in mind)
- permanent lack of ammo  (in combination with the both lines above -> /ragequit)
- those... grabbing zombies, whatever they are called are a pain in the butt. when they come from above or below, they're barely in sight and already got you at the balls. decrease their reach or set the camera further above the player to increase the view radius.
- controls are not what i would call accurate, mouse is jumpy as hell...

conclusion: at the current state i cannot recommend it, unless you get it on sale realy cheap as i did.

Great gameplay
Easy to run without game booster
Unique graphics( Like Borderlands)


Cons: 

Campaign too hard
Zombies are to OP as they break things to easily, this then causes to mission failure.
Cant have a variety of weapons equipped at once
