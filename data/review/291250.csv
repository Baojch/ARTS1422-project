Melhorem os sistemas chamados ""binários"", colocando dois sóis para uma quantidade de planetas.

Number one, it's rare that a game is so poorly done that the devs actually take the time to publish an apology for it. Kudos for issuing the apology, but why are they still selling a game they obviously (and so rightly) feel so bad about?

Number two, we're talking about an imitation of a game done twenty five years ago. Basically, Meteoric Game is openly saying it can neither equal nor improve on space games of 1993.

They offer free access to their next game but if what they're saying is true, I can't imagine there being a next game, or what it would be or that it would be worthwhile. 

It's the kind of admission that should result in closed doors, and a total change of career path. I've lost count, but I want to say I've seen ten patches to this game. The most playable version of the game was clearly the first version. For about the next four patches, the game became more buggy, not less. Then came two patches that were more playable but stripped a lot of the games functions out. Beyond that point, the rest of the patches were simply introduction of more and more bugs. The current version is their crowning achievement...the game simply will not launch.

Okay... if anything I've said is even a little unfair, then I have to imagine they've done what every game dev does, sooner or later. They got too ambitious, and they presided over a debacle. Now they'll be sadder but wiser. 

if that's the case, I'm going to hold up games that work that they should have been more like...
Endless Sky
Drifter
The X Series.
Astrox

The X series is pretty amazing, but for the rest of the list, these games are far from top (or even second tier)
They're mostly examples of what a talanted amateur can do. Endless Sky is 2d but otherwise a pretty amazing game.

This Game is basically a fork of an open source game called Pioneer which has had some graphical and UI changes made to it. The 1.0 ""Release"" is a complete joke, even the game itself proclaims it is alpha, and even still calls itself Paragon in some of the text in the game.

The Dev's claimed to have been silent while working hard towards release and yet the last code commit to their github was back in mid 2016. They abandoned this and then hoped by reducing the price and calling it ""Released"" that they might scam some extra money out of the STEAM user base. Don't fall for it!

Go to Github and look up Pioneer, it's more finished than Jumpdrive, is essentially the same game but free. Also features that don't work in Jumpdrive that are directly copied from Pioneer, actually do work in Pioneer. Just as an example I can't change my character's name and nothing is displayed in the portrait. Both these features work perfectly in Pioneer. Also I was lucky to make 10 minutes in Jumpdrive before it crashed. Played Pioneer for 5 hours straight after I found it and got myself a copy. This game is going into my dead category and is being replaced with Pioneer and all it's free goodness.

Incase Steam allows it I'll try posting a link: https://github.com/pioneerspacesim
If the link doesn't work just search Github for pioneerspacesim.

If you check it out you'll find a lot of the minor art assets were lifted straight or minimally altered when Meteoric Games decided to steal this piece of Opensource Joy.

I highly recommend this gamefor what it is; a true indie space sandbox with trading, fighting, explo, etc. If you're looking for Star Citizen or X3, you'll not find it here. If you're looking for a world you can really explore and find something unique and interesting in, give it a try.

It seems as if this has been ""released"" with no changes or updates in several months, and much is still broken. 

To test it, I took a simple delivery mission. I took off, jumped, then tried to autopilot to the base, which was planetside. The autopilot would fly toward the planet, then away, repeatedly, for half a dozen times at least. I then used the autopilot to dock at an orbital base, which did work.

I then left the orbital base and once again set course for the planet. This time the autopilot properly approached the base, but brought me in and landed me sideways, only righting me once on the ground. Upon landing, the mission would not complete, even though I'd made it to the prescribed location before the deadline.

In the contact list, no ships were listed, even though I could see several with the good ol' Mark 1 Eyeball. 

Do not buy this game. It's not in any way finished. Far from it. Just stay away and go buy Evochron Legacy, or play Pioneer (the original version of this game before it forked off) for free.

Pioneer is essentially a remake of the classic open world space game Frontier.  There is a big difference in between Pioneer and Jumpdrive though:  Pioneer is still being developed.  The Jumpdrive devs have all but disappeared leaving a broken game behind.

Let's start with the only Jumpdrive gets right:  atmosphere.  The synthwave soundtrack, the cockpits and ship models that look like they came out of a low budge sci-fi movie (in a good way), the colorful backgrounds all looks, sounds, and feels great.  Most importantly, all of these things work together.  None of the ship models look out of place.  Nothing sounds out of place.  Everything meshes perfectly with the exception of some of the artifacts left over from Pioneer, like the travel tunnel.  It all works so well that it pains me that the game doesn't really work.

So what doesn't work?  The biggest thing is that Jumpdrive crashes when you try to dock and there's no way to avoid this.  You can take missions, buy cargo, or load up on passengers but whatever you do, the game will crash when you attempt to dock.  This bug ruins the game and it's been there since the last update almost a year ago.  Before this update, there were still numerous bugs.  The game would crash when hostile ships were supposed to be spawned.  In fact, there were no interactions with NPC ships.  Certian planets would not having clipping allowing you to fly through them but not land on them.  Certain space stations would have some kind of invisible force field around them cause both players and NPCs to bounce off them.

The devs have disappeared.  The game doesn't work.  You shouldn't buy this.",1486866469,1486866469,False,7,0,0.583073675632476807,1,True,False,True,False,,,

This space rpg reminds me a lot of Battlecruiser 3000 A.D., with space flight and atmospheric flight (although very basic), trading, mining, missions, combat etc.

The major problem I have with this is, after having played dozens of games on Windows 10 over a period of a year or so, this is actually the only one that gave me a blue screen of death, which is weird since Microsoft has such a safe environment for developers to fool around in... (and yes, it's game related, my hardware is fine)

10-03-2018 (update):
The good news is I haven't experienced the 'blue screen of death' anymore, but there are other problems that plague this game now. For example, I have experienced the game not allowing me to complete missions because it missed a completion trigger or something along those lines several times now.

The biggest problem I have though, is that celestial objects and stations move at a relative speed with respect to eachother and their central body, however ships, including the player have absolute speeds. This difference means that I cannot, ever, dock at certain stations with certain ships, because ships have a maximum speed instead of a maximum acceleration which means any object moving faster than said maximum speed is by definition unreachable. Again, a lot of missions I cannot do, and I have to figure that out when I'm about to deliver said missions, because there is no way of telling how fast any given station is moving within its steller system.

The sounds and music I still find enjoyable, the aesthetics are pleasing (and easy on the system), and there are a lot of things one can do, if they were properly implemented.

This game has potential, but currently I (still) cannot recommend it for its game-breaking bugs.

It looks fantastic (for the most part), and the retro soundtrack is a very nice touch.  However, development is proceeding at a crawl, if even at all.  The game is a buggy mess.  The interface is confusing, and the tutorial leaves a lot to be desired.  You basically wander about aimlessly, eventually crashing into something or going in circles.  The quests are extremely boring and there's very little feedback in the game when doing them or completing them.  The COM LINK interface, though the metro look is pretty cool, is severely crippled by a confusing layout.  The space flying physics are flawed; there's no sense of floating in space - your ship just stops and goes like it's a car.  Fast travel autopilot is glitched and turned into a boring status screen.  The collision mechanics are glitchy, and you'll soon get used to that VERY annoying 'Game Over' screen which plays some cheesy CGI video reminiscent of something from the early 90s.

If the developers get in gear and fix these issues, this may be worth buying.  It has such great potential.  I can only hope for this, but in the meantime, I've moved on to other games.

I'm using the word ""whole"" loosely here, because this isn't remotely a finished let alone playable title.

I typically play my space sims as though I'm a space trucker (imagine that), so the first thing I do are cargo missions. Jumpdrive has them...but you can't complete them. Either they fail on acceptance as the mission timer ended hours before the quests were offered (no joke), or you spend time hauling the stuff to its destination only for no recipient to collect it. Of course you could always skip the trucking stuff and switch to assassination jobs...but you can't attach functional weapons to your ship. Really. They're only for sale as hood ornaments apparently. In amongst all this you'll get to experience the amazing autopilot which causes your ship to seize mid-flight and occasionally crash back into the planet or a nearby city for reasons only it understands.

I'd normally mention visuals, soundtrack, etc here...but not this time. If you like the 80s blocky ships and retro music, just buy NMS and find a decent playlist on Spotify or something.

Is it worth getting? I would say so, yes, based on this update and the way the game seems to be heading now. This update isn't a revolution but it's a good step in the right direction for this game, the guys developing this have made quite a lot of progress in the space of a month. New ships, new cockpits, new space graphical effects with nebulas, a better autopilot, a better GUI for the autopilot, and just generally better polish and even slightly better frame rate. 

This game is making sure and steady progress but you have to remember that this game is ALPHA which means a lot of the features that you want to see here are not finished yet. 

What you have got is a Space simulation where you can pretty much go and do whatever you want, it is a sandbox, it is just that not all of the gameplay content and sandbox flavours are in their yet as the developers are adding to the games content as it develops. 

What you do get is a MASSIVELY improved and MASSIVELY polished up version of Pioneer with lots of things which Pioneer will never have. This game features a complete graphical overhaul, a complete audio overhaul and also a complete ship and assets overhaul. The game feels polished, it has a more simplistic but refined UI and it is making progress in the right ways which makes development for this game actually feel exciting now. 

Is the game worth £10? I would agree. Yes. If you liked Frontier you pretty much have the same game here as Frontier although the combat as of yet is not as developed as say other areas like trading and such. Though the devs have said they are going to be working on the combat area of the game. 

Jumpdrive is a work in progress but it is developing, and if the updates develop at the rate which this one has, and the way in which Adel and co are doing then basically this game is going to develop pretty quickly.

Самая популярная причина, по которой все яростно строчат гневные сообщения - разработчик кинул всех, пок-пок, нет обновлений, а если есть, то редко, кукареку, всё ниработаит, контента нет, мама забери меня отсюда. Хочу развеять этот глупый миф.

Зайдя в игру ощущаешь не привкус очередного пиксельного дерьма с запахом раннего доступа, а самое настоящее восхищение сразу после первого выхода в открытый космос.
[h1]Разбираю по пунктам:[/h1]
- Простейшее управление, не сравнимое с кошмаром из Pioneer'а. Я не хочу высчитывать блядские траектории полёта всякой космической хуиты и смотреть десятки туториалов, я хочу лететь быстро и с комфортом, не забивая всю голову тонкостями управления. Здесь всё именно так.
- ПОРАЗИТЕЛЬНАЯ графика. На Графониумном ринге среди [u]подобных игр[/u] Paragon способен проиграть лишь Space Engine'у и Elite: Dangerous. 
- Огромная игровая вселенная, состоящая из миллионов звёзд. Серьёзно. А вокруг звёзд - планеты, на каждую из которых можно высадиться и полюбоваться видом. 
- Полная свобода действий. Хочешь - лети на поиски неизведанных планет. Надоест - выполняй рандомно генерируемые задания и зарабатывай на новый корабль. Никто не держит за руку, просто выбрасывают в открытый космос - гуляй, Вася!

Не понимаю чего ещё можно желать от подобной игры. Свою небольшую цену она полностью заслуживает, и, не считая нескольких багов, уже вполне работает и выполняет свою основную функцию. Просто великолепная игра.

Да, ещё присутствует прекрасный synthwave саундтрек, необыкновенно дополняющий зрительную составляющую игры. Такого странного сочетания я ещё не видел, но это работает!",1445733166,1445733166,True,18,3,0.615501523017883301,3,True,False,True,False,,,

It also seems development has crashed into a wall at 100 MPH because there hans't been any updates for a decent amount of time without a word. At anytime before it stopped working I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately I can't. [/strike]

So the devs of Meteoric Games reached out to me on my poorly written review I typed on my phone when I was bored to give the game another go, so I did.

My points still stand. The game looks A+ for an independently made space sim, and the soundtrack still gets me pumped, but the large problem is just that; it's independently made. I'm not saying indie space sims are bad, but it's still too early in development for this game to be playable. 

- It's highly unstable and crashes happen in ways that confuse me. The crashes are frequent but never happen doing the same thing i.e. fast traveling, jumping to another system, or simply requesting take-off.

- The new autopilot fast travel is frightening. One second you're in space, the next you're colliding with the inner mesh of a planet (it teleports you inside the planet). It was fine when autopilot actually flew you to your destination, albiet it would occasionally smash you into a station or planet.

- The camera controls are stiff, and the flight controls for the mouse are too touchcy. 

- Things I haven't tested are combat, missions, trading... but that's only because I can't get to that point.

Try Pioneer for free and then of you enjoy it, buy this, as it looks and sounds a lot better.

The graphics have been massively improved as has the soundtrack. The game goes for a retro 80's feel (right down to the Cold War In Space scenario) and the optional filters that make it look like a 80's sci fi film or its being played on a cathode monitor!

The universe and the individual planets look wonderful and there is a plethora of stuff to do. As with the original elite, the intial progress in the game is extremely slow, but once you gain traction there is a fantastic and absorbing range of activities, you can be a pirate, an interstellar taxi driver, a trader or fight for one of the factions. There's no overarching plot as such, but your imagination can build your own as you play.

For the price, this represents better value for money than E:D by a long chalk (and you can land on fantastically rendered planets NOW).

The only problem is that it is still a little bit buggy. I cannot load a saved game from the start page, I have to begin a new game, play for 10-15 minutes and then load my older saved game which is a bit of a pain. There's the occasional CTD to, and the graphics can lag a bit when you don't expect them to (and likewise be extramely smooth when there's a lot going on)

The game is soon to be updated, hopefully to iron out the glitches and push it closer to beta. If you like space trading games, this is definitely one of the better ones that I have tried.

WARNING TO FEDORA LINUX USERS THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. 


As it should be obvious this game is a fork of the open source game called ""Pioneer"" which is in turn based off of the 1995 game ""Frontier : First Encounters"" which was the third iteration of the original open world space simulation ELITE. Now I thought the idea of this fork of Pioneer with it's 80's theme was a great idea, however after I bought it and installed it I was immediately turned off. The aesthetic is barely 80's, the ships all look as if they were constructed from lego and the cartoon style texturing and shading just doesn't reflect what they were going for. Plus the music is much too modern sounding, they completely missed the mark on the whole 80's vibe. The sound design as of yet is lacklustre as well. (To be clear while I couldn't get it to even start on Fedora Linux it does run on Windows 7)

Right now the game is pretty empty and there is not a whole lot to do, keep that in mind as you prepare to buy this fork of a much more complete FREE game for FIFTEEN US DOLLARS. I understand it's still in early access and I probably wouldn't have posted this, but when I told them the game would not properly initialize in Fedora Linux by opening a thread in the discussion area they said it would be fixed in the next update, but when it turned out to still not start they deleted the thread. What kind of dev deletes support threads? This is unacceptable, as a user that payed good money for this game I should not be swept under the rug. >:(",1427411559,1427411559,False,8,0,0.496654719114303589,3,False,False,True,False,,,

Very reminiscent of ""No Man's Sky,"" a game I've been looking forward to since the moment it was announced.

Fantastic art style, very simple, but as Neil Armstrong said about the Luna, ""It has a stark beauty of its own.""
Simple menu's and UI
Seemless traveling, to/from orbit/surface of planet, between star systems

I love space. This gives me a great bed for simple gameplay with the enormities of space. I love how this game has started. I can see a long road ahead of it, but I hope it gets finished soon.

Things to note as of right now 10/19/14; 

No customization of controls, or any keybindings for that matter, flying with standard controls takes some getting used to

Crashes, lots of 'em, game is obviously unstable atm (First crash was 25 minutes into my first time playing)

--------------------------

This is basically a mod of Pioneer Space Sim, which is a freeware remake of Elite: Frontier.  There are some nice things about the direction they've taken this (I like the art style), but ultimately it's really buggy, with ships randomly crashing into stations and saving/loading the game causes crashes 99% of the time. 

UPDATE

Good news: The game is more stable now than it was a year ago.

Bad news: That's been the only development on the game in the past year.

The game has huge potential, i saw a review and it wasnt recommended but i thought i would give it a chance anyway.
It still in the early stages and there is plenty to work on but overall the initial idea works.
The universe is apsolutley massive, although i havent quite used any combat abilities or got to grips with the full controls it is still fun. 
Pros: 
-Massive expanse to explore
-Beautiful backdrops
-Huge potential
-Fairly easy to play once you have got to grips with the controls
-Immersive
-Hours if not unlimited gameplay

Cons:
-some bugs need ironing
(clipping with ships when docking and departing from stations and cities, auto pilot sometimes needs resetting due to losing destination)
-No tutorial; would really appreciate in a following update
-hard to use starmap to control warping to other systems

When all said and done, the game is worth the money.

Actually I had no idea what to do. I travelled around for a while in a shuttle. Wow. Definitely alpha.

A simple couple of pre-set missions or a coms channel with hints would help that. A basic education about the concepts beyond the text blurb provided. I might go so far as to suggest rescue or recovery missions to avoid violence (and the inherent ratings/classification problems in various meat jurisdictions)

The physics seems to ignore newton, although at the scale set it's hard to tell... Newton was wrong but his ideas make for fun games (see Angry Birds), especially if you have all thrusters manually controllable. Imagine the awesome epicness of winning a battle with a limping ship using a gravitational slingshot.

The quickish mode of transit ( forgot what it's called ) seems to only accelerate. My keys are default - W and S - and S doesn't slow me down. It would be nice if it behaved like the latest idea I was reading about from NASA - creating a space/time vacuum in front of the ship. That would give some more control over speed. Not sure how it translates to code in the game engine, but it shouldn't be hard given that it's kind of newtonian.

Also, the joystick config sucks. Happy to offer my input as a joystick tester. I have a 3 axis, 4 button joystick, but the 3rd axis is physically set up as a throttle and this does not work well for this game given the current options.

Not much this observer thinks but then what if you add space stations and cities or spaceports into the mix? It's not illusion in paragon, it's all there and that concept alone is the basis of a game with plenty of depth. But of course i'm not just reviewing one side but all and so far the plot, as an avid sci-fi fan myself, is very interesting but still has much development. It is curently based in the not so distant future, around the 22nd century if i'm not mistaken, in a world where the Cold War doesnt end!

So far however, this plot has yet to be implemented fully and more technical issues have to be solved around how such a massive procedurally generated galaxy can be kept stable and in working order. I take my hat off to the devs who are attempting this task because from what i've seen already if these technical issues, minor and major, can be handled I honestly believe this could be one hell of an adventure.

With regards to the depth of the game, this is also something that is wanting but from the hammer and sickle on the space stations to maps of various aligned and non-aligned planets it seems the basis is there to create a universe of mixed politics and motives. Its one thing to play an rpg or free roaming games based in some distant land or with compulsory missions to weigh you down, but to have free reign to go about your business and make a name for yourself? That doesnt sound too bad and the potential is there.

As it is you can fly around, see the sights, get a feel for how the game would work and with enough imagination have some idea of the end product but it is a long way off and despite my enthusiasm it has to be said that getting involved with an early access program with massive scope is not for the faint of heart and so only those of patience (and a definite love for sci-fi) should apply now, otherwise give it time!",1406232945,1406232945,True,8,0,0.585977613925933838,1,True,False,True,False,,,

It doesn't even guide you through your beginning at your first port. No help with knowing what you could do with your ship or crew or cargo or anything. Once you get out of port, you have no guidance towards any possible goals, including any missions you take. Apparently you need Hydrogen in your cargo bay to make a hyperspace jump. And you need to be away from the planet. And if your hyperspace button won't activate even then, if the map will let you click on your distant target but nothing else is functioning, well, that's just too bad, there's no in-game information and no out of game guides or tips or anything. Just make sure you have that hydrogen and the auto-pilot is buggy.

Giving it another try, I still feel strongly on that as when I had attempted to launch this game I had multiple crashes which I had to manually fix by deleting saved files in my drive. Likely caused be owning paragon and the name change or something with the updates made it crash on launch. Anyways, after trying this game again with the supposed updates because I had thought it would be totally different, I saw little to no difference with how it started off, complicated and clueless on what to do in the game. I had this issue along with many other issues such as the game not supporting my 1920x1080 monitor. I had to run this game on 720p (terrible resolution to see after playing most games on 1080p) and also the game is quite laggy and seems unsupported even though I have an R9 390 and an I5 4690k which run most games on great settings but this game, even on lower settings, seems to drop quite a few frames.

Saves are currently working for me.  Twelve in a row has got to be some sort of record ;)

It was nice to actually get some traction in game for grinding to better ships.

Here is what I've now found that I can do 8 missions in a row...

1)  Found a game-ender:  Farley Station.  For some reason, the ship will not ""geo-lock"" above the dock.  The autopilot stops about 1m from the surface.  I turn off autopilot and I'm zooming backwards.  When I try to manually pilot to the dock, when my speed is 0, the planet is moving beneath me.

2)  Almost always now my starter ship will not dock.  I have to turn off autopilot and hit ""o"", then the dock's tractor beam complete's my ships lateral rotation so that I land.  This has worked every time until I attempted to land at the above (point 1) dock.

3)  After docking and coming back from the dock info screen, the HUD mileage flickers.

MUCH IMPROVED...  Enough so to recommend.


===========================
7 HF2
===========================
I have about 4 hours in this game.  I'm experiencing an ever escalating number of deal breakers:

1)  Auto-pilot mostly works.  That, however, is not the problem.  When it DOESN'T work is the issue.  Expect to crash into docks and die.  One work-around would be too...

2) Save often.  Except I'm experiencing a crash on save about 1 every 3 or 4 attempts.  So that leg of the journey (since the last successful save) needs to be repeated.  However upon landing (presumably due to the type of station) I again auto-pilot crash.

3)  So instead of grinding these nickel-and-dime missions, why not play around a bit?  I modified a ship price so that I could at least make more than a couple grand.  So I fitted up the Starling transport, found some folks wanting to go three jumps for $5000 and we set off.  Landed in the system and auto-piloted to the dock.  Requested clearance and told this impressive space taxi to land.  No auto-pilot crash... time to cash in!  Wait, it didn't land... It's just floating above the pad.  I manually bring the ship back out of position and tell the autopilot to land again.  ...Still not on the pad.

Alright.  4 hours in, and I'll be watching for the next patch notes to decide whether it's time to give it another shot.

Update:  There was an announcement a week ago that the specific save crash I'm experiencing was fixed.  I'm running their current Hotfix (Alpha 7 HF2)...  Save issue still exists.

Das Spiel ist sehr athmosphärisch... wie bereits öfter erwhähnt wird hier der 80iger Jahre Sci-Fi Stil gekonnt und charmant wiedergegeben. Ich mag die Musik die gut zum Setting passt. Grafisch ist es nichts Aufregendes aber dieser Comic-Look weiß zu gefallen... naja zumindest mir :D

Allerdings muss ich zugeben, dass ich vieles noch nicht so ganz verstehe. Schon allein das erste mal Handel zu treiben war eine kleine Herausforderung ;) Ein gutes Tutorial fehlt noch, hoffe sehr dass noch eins nachkommt. Außerdem finde ich die Kartenansicht der Sonnensysteme etwas unübersichtlich. Und Informationen über die Planeten, Sonnen etc fehlen noch. Der Autopilot ist auch so ne Sache für sich... Wenn man ihn direkt Andocken lässt kommts zu einem Crash. UND GANZ GANZ SCHLIMM sind die Abstürze,,, beim Speichern kommt das besonders oft vor. Ich werd einfach aus dem Spiel geschmissen und lande auf dem Desktop. 

Was ich aber wirklich schon richtig fett finde ist, dass der Übergang von der Planetenoberfläche zur Umlaufbahn und raus in den weiten Raum so geschmeidig funktioniert. Auch das bisher einzige Sonnensystem welches ich erkunden konnte, wirkt sehr authentisch. Auch das sehr freie Gameplay ist für mich ein Riesen Pluspunkt. Man ist nicht zwingend an eine Missionsreihe gebunden, kann einfach nur Handel treiben oder eben den Weltraumrambo raushängen lassen ;)

Virtually everything is identical to Pioneer expect for slightly higher quality graphics with a bit of post processing. Though I was keenly aware of the similarities before I bought this game the promotional videos and info I had read about the game on their site beforehand made it seem that  -even at this early alpha state- they had improved  on some of the base features of Pioneer. Sadly that is not the case at all (at least not as of now). 

In fact they managed to screw up some basic mundane things that were already working well in Pioneer. For instance, simple things like word wrapping in menus and UI. A large part of Pioneer's and subsequently Paragon's gameplay has you pouring through resource lists, menus and just general text. At HD resolution (1920x1080) the font is oversived, janky, somewhat fuzzy and in certain areas words or phases overlap making it a puzzle to decipher if you aren't already familar with what it is supposed to say. That's a big part of the game and if that's not formatted properly well that certainly degrades the experience. 

Another simple thing - In Pioneer when you visit various stations and or cities on planets throughout the universe the station personnel is represented by dynamically generated character pictures, made from snippets of male and female facial features of varying ethnicities and...silly mismatched sci-fi type gear. There are like 10 distinct facial features that are aslo mismatched to make somewhat unique (if not sometimes terrifying and creepy O.O) variations of characters to ""interact"" (they are just photos with text underneath them but use your imagination) with. Did Paragon improve upon this aspect at all? No, in fact they replaced that quirky dynamic character generating system with a very boring single, all encompassing male or female faceless avatar. I mean really? Maybe that's something that will be changed in the future but who knows.

These may seem like little things but if they can't get these things right, well you get the picture.

I personally regret the purchase and would rather just support Pioneer which is free and open-source. It's kind of shameful in my opinion that the Paragon devs are even making money off essentially a straight forward clone of a free game. Maybe in the future they will be able to develop enough unique content as to separate their game from Pioneer but as of now it is a mirror image of Pioneer with just an extra bit of visual polish. 

If I am somehow woefully misinformed and Paragon was intended to be a visual upgrade mod of Pioneer then my question is how did it get Greenlit on Steam? I seriously would like to know what is happening here.",1400076555,1400076555,False,26,0,0.544543564319610596,5,True,False,True,False,,,

The game has a great look, and even with some clearly WIP UI screens, it presents information neatly and accessibly. Plus, the music is really quite nice. (Though I've silenced it to play Nujaubes, which also happens to complement the game very well...)

So far, most complaints are simply symptomatic of the game's alpha status. Early-game balance is very lacking, with early delivery missions (the only ones you'll be able to take) paying anywhere between $400-700, while ships bigger than the miniscule starting ship costing upwards of $50000. This will presumably be changed in future revisions, but in the mean time, all ship info is stored in convenient little .lua files within the game's folders, so manually changing ship prices is a good way to circumvent the early grind.

Also, another minor complaint: currently there just aren't enough keyboard shortcuts. Clicking through the (again, very attractive and thoughtfully designed) menus would be a more painless process if there were shortcut keys to flip between your ship's views, comms, maps, etc. I assume this is on the to-do list somewhere, because it's such a simple thing.

Oh, and the autopilot can be downright homicidal. This seems to be true of most space games, but the moral of the story is save frequently and try to keep an eye out for passing freighters when you're docking or taking off from a station.

Bottom line, though, Paragon is a compelling and promising space sim. It definitely leans more towards approachability and simplicity than the impregnable X series, or the finnicky Evochron Mercenary (both of which are also good), though it seems that Paragon is aiming towards a fair amount of depth eventually.

Well worth the purchase price for that little convenience alone.

Music is top notch as well, hinting at radiophonic and kraftwerk, it goes to make a perfect background to this space sim.  Runs like a dream and you can max the graphics on a modest PC.

Old Review.....

Wonderful and Awsome! This is like Elite, but very pretty and smooth. 

So here's a quick guide to getting into orbit. 

1.  press f1 a time or two to get an outside view of your ship. You want to zoom and use the #4 and #6 on your keypad to rotate the view a bit. 

2. There's a little icon, like a tear drop blasting off just to the right of the bottom of the screen. That's your lift-off icon, and will launch you for a second off the landing platform. (watch out for descending ships) 

3. Quickly hit ""U"" a couple of times, so give you some ""up"" thrust, and angle the front of your ship skywards. Then hit ""i"" this will give you some forward thrust, and get you out of the spaceport area.

4. using the ""w"" and ""s"" buttons, set your ""set speed"" (all the info you need to know is displayed on the bottom left of your screen) ro 500 m/s (that's 500 meters a second) which should be enough to get you into orbit.
5. use your keypad to look around, and your ""u-i-o-k"" keys to perform adjustments to your thrust. 

6. you will see a ""screen-shift"" and your camera and ship will be oriented a little different, and then you are in orbit. Watch your heading, and remember you may ntot neccesarily be traveling in the same direction your space ship is pointing.
