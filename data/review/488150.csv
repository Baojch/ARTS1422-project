[b]GAMEPLAY RATING:[/b] FAIR

I quite like this game, it's barebones indeed but what it offers is high intensity action sort of like a tron version of Holopoint. You'll get sweaty and your throwing arm will tire so it's a great title to burn a few calories while being distracted. There's skill required so it feels rewarding getting addional points for accuracy and completing waves. The visuals are good enough and the physics feel realistic.

However the title remains in EA without an update since July 2016, so consider this game abandoned by the developer so I'm giving a thumbs down as warning. What you're getting should be considered the complete game. With that said I'd still consider the gameplay worth £3.99 in it's current state, but loathed to recommend since the developer has effectively put two fingers up at us.

Was kind of hoping for something with tron style disc throwing... This is not that but it's still interesting. 

The disc is basicaly a generic physics object so it's like throwing a lofty brick, not a frisby. It can be quite difficult to aim your throw with it as well due to expectation on how it should behave but I suspect it's something you'll overcome with practice. It's in early access at time of writing so the mechanics might change as well, possibly improved. The system is workable at the moment regardless. 

What makes it interesting is the ability to call it back to the hand of your choice and getting a score multiplier for hitting enemies that you had previously missed from behind as it returns to your hand. This makes it more dynamic and makes missing a bit less frustraiting as you might have a second shot at taking out the enemy for an even higher reward.

While held it acts as a shield and allows you to reflect enemies shots back at them. It was a really nice design choice to make a hud on the shield that it gives you targeting reticle with which to aim shots back. I think this could be expanded in later developement to show player health on the shield and more importantly a radar like feature that shows where enemies are realitive to the direction you are facing so you know when they are charging up for a shot behind you.

Basically the game is space pirate trainer with throwable weapon instead of guns. The difference is it is much more reasonably priced for a wave based game and thus gets my recommendation on bang for buck value.",1467207252,1467293597,True,6,0,0.56542205810546875,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I was sent a copy of this game out of the blue by the developer, who had seen a livestream I did with my htc vive. It basically said ""here's a copy if you want to make a video on it"" with a game key. Frankly, it looked very sketchy, and I didn't even believe it till I activated it on Steam. My point is, while I got it for free, I'm not obligated to say anything nice about it, or even review this game at all. I just thought I should explain why I got it for free.

Short Review:
It's basically Space Pirate Trainer, but instead of guns, all you have is a shield that you can throw at enemies and deflect bullets with. If you like Space Pirate Trainer, you'll like this.

Long Review:
Really, the short review sums it up perfectly. I never really got all the excitement behind Space Pirate Trainer. It's just too repetitive in my opinion. So why am I recommending this game? It's still fun. Is it gonna keep you entertained for hours on end? No (just look at my play time). But the time I played it was enjoyable and worked up a sweat. Would I pay $5? Of course not. Knowing what I do now, I'd wait till it's on sale for 50% of or so. That's just my opinion. If you enjoyed Space Pirate Trainer, you'll probably think it's well worth the $5.

Better collision when shield flies into the enemy instead of flying through
A more discs of tron style arena
