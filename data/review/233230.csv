You walk, run, jump, can push stuff by walking into it, and that's it. You're here to live in this eerie world and wander its dusty halls. The game even first drops you into the start of itself, there being no main menu you first see from which to start a new game.

This is successfully foreboding; despite the complete lack of foes or any life in the world being shown, the wonder, and existential dread, I've felt in my mere 25 minutes of playing this so far are among the strongest any playable experience has caused me in well over a ""decade"". I had to pull out this early because my heart began to pick up.

The puzzles are as minimalistic as the gameplay- and still feel fair and satisfying to ponder, enact, and solve. What's more, because some folks have ungelike puzzle experiences from others, the devs went the extra mile to include hints in the pause menu. Don't worry, they're optional; even if you click the ""hints"" button, you then click ""hint 1"", 2, or 3 to show the actual hint, so you decide your challenge level.

All the above inspires me to recommend this dreamlike experience. It helps that it runs smoothly even on this little laptop of mine, so even if you're on a budget, you may have found a graphics dollop of a game for you to try out.

While clearly a passion project there's a lack of polish to the game that can't be ignored and will make or break your experience.

The majority of puzzles in Kairo were fine but there are a handful of secrets that are too esoteric to even consider solving. One puzzle could only be solved by the community for example, and that event came and went years ago so a guide is the only way to 100% the game. Meanwhile most of the early details I thought would be clues to later puzzles ended up being entirely irrelevant. The game design is unrefined in that sense but thankfully most of the game is intuitive enough to solo.

Kairo's world, its minimalism, and dashes of environmental storytelling will likely decide if you enjoy the experience or not as beyond the puzzles there's not really anything else to the game. The world is more atmospheric with implied poetic themes and liminal open spaces while being very linear to traverse, so if you need a story and clear instructions this isn't the one for you.

Personally I had no qualms following a guide once I hit certain dead ends and despite that I ended up enjoying the experience for the most part. I was still trying the puzzles first before looking for solutions and filling in gaps.

Bem... essa foi a minha experiência com Kairo.

A parte boa do jogo é justamente a ideia dele, de ser um walk simulator que passa por diferentes liminal spaces - diversos lugares minimalistas e estranhos, que variam desde salas pequenas e claustrofóbicas à titânicas torres e florestas brutalistas - que ao mesmo tempo que são esquisitos, sempre causando sensações de desconforto e solidão, são belos e impressionantes.
Agora o resto do jogo...

...Bem, pra iniciar as críticas, comecemos com o software do jogo, que simplesmente se recusava a funcionar no meu monitor. Tiver que fazer altas gambiarras pra conseguir abrir o programa em modo janela pra ele rodar. Depois disso, o show de horrores: O jogo é CHEIO de salas diferentes, e sempre que você troca de sala, o jogo fecha e reabre. Beleza, isso não seria tão incomodo, se não fosse por ele sempre reabrir no exato ponto que divide meus dois monitores. Toda vez, para cada sala que eu ia - em um jogo REPLETO de salas - eu tinha que puxar a janela do jogo pro centro do meu monitor primário. Nem preciso dizer o quão irritante isso era.

Quanto a parte de gameplay, o objetivo, ao explorar as salas, é achar e completar puzzles que vão abrindo novos caminhos (e mais salas). Esses puzzles são, em sua maioria, ridículos, nem podendo ser chamados de puzzles direito. Apenas uns dois ou três foram realmente interessantes de completar, o restante sendo bem fracos e até irritantes pela lentidão do jogo. Falando em lentidão, esse é outro aspecto que incomoda muito durante a gameplay: o seu personagem não corre, ele só anda um pouco mais rápido, o que complica bastante trafegar por cenários colossais que você já passou enquanto procura puzzles.
Pra fechar a torrente de desgraça, a câmera do jogo, depois de jogar um tempo, começa a te dar dor de cabeça. Não sei o que fizeram de diferente nela, mas nas 3 vezes que joguei tive dor de cabeça - não vou mentir, porém, que essa parte pode estar relacionada a eu ter que reposicionar a janela sempre que mudava de sala - dificilmente ela ficava centralizada certo, e essa leve variação pode ter ajudado a causar a dor.

Enfim, a conclusão é que eu deveria ter dado ouvidos aos alertas do jogo desde o começo e abandonado ele, porque, mesmo com cenários incríveis, o pacote bônus de problemas que vem junto está longe de valer a pena.",1699263750,1699263750,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,True,,,

One puzzle has you running on in-game treadmills which felt incredibly out of place.

It just lacks a lot of polish.

You do some minor puzzle solving, but the main “fun” or engagement in this game comes from exploring its desolate halls. There is no dialogue, no definitive answers, nothing of the sort. So if you expect some kind of gripping narrative… well.

I still the narrative is there. After a fashion, that is. There’s some amount of environmental storytelling, but considering how abstract everything is… I mean, it’s cubes, colours, voids… and some other things.

Other things.

I wouldn’t classify this game as horror. But I’ve seen one person nope out of playing this, because of how THICK the atmosphere is. You know the trope, “Nothing is scarier”? Well, that’s what you have here. Or do you? Is Kairo really this desolate, empty place that it looks to be?

Ultimately, this is the main driving question of the game. What is this place? Why are you here? What’s your purpose?

Are you alone in here?

If those questions, mixed with the aesthetic visible on the screenshots, sound interesting to you - I’d say check this out. I loved it to bits, but this is one of those experiences that can vary from person to person.

Kairo does a great job at atmosphere and being imaginative. I really appreciated the simplistic art style, calming music, and overall tone of the game. The entire experience felt like a lucid dream, exploring the empty worlds and seeing where this experience takes you.
 
However, the other parts surrounding the game really hampered my experience. After the first area of the game it seems like it takes a nosedive in quality. I found the puzzles became either way too simple or too unclear. Some puzzles I found myself thinking 'oh, guess I solved it..' and then moved on. Other puzzles had me spending 20 to 30 minutes trying to solve, leading to frustration and looking up the solution (which is still very unclear why that is the solution). The most frustrating puzzle was the tilting one that had you lining up two wheels with symbols up. You can accidentally solve the first part without it being clear why that was the solution. That puzzle gets harder, with the last round making no sense to me whatsoever. A circle? How does that make sense in the way the puzzle presents the other rounds? It just seems inconsistent. There are many parts of the game that feel inconsistent, which again hampers my experience. How was I supposed to know the gate without a teleporting texture is actually a teleport? Why are those symbols everywhere but are only used in maybe two puzzles to figure out the solution? Sometimes the solutions are just plain given to you, but not until you spend time trying to solve the puzzle yourself (thinking it is more logical than it actually is).
 
Another frustrating aspect was although the game encourages exploration to find the ruins, yet the world is way too large to go on a hunt. Sometimes the ruins are very easy to miss because they blend into the texturing (I passed by a ruin twice without noticing it because it matched the texture on the wall). There are secret doors hidden throughout the game that will grant you partial access to the secret ending. I noticed those doors while exploring, but since I didn't click a button in a later part of the level, they didn't open for me! What, how does that make sense? And the worst part is none of this is hinted at at all. The ruins at least make sense because you'll eventually run into one or two on your play through, but the rest of the 'secrets' seem too obtuse.
 
Without getting into spoilers, the ending and overarching story didn't leave me satisfied. I'm very happy for the developer for making their game and not giving up, but it doesn't quite leave a satisfying ending for those that spent time playing it..",1674297776,1674297776,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

But even if you're desperate enough -- like me-- to spend hours just to get to the ""secret ending""... well, let's just say it was probably the biggest ""fuck you"" I have ever seen in a game so far.

Look, I can forgive its graphics for being a result of its time, but everything is just so boring. Like, there's the same walking audio for all environments you are in, even when you're in water or even air. And long walkways and sometimes impossible puzzles provide no reward except the blind hope of a story at the end to make this all worth while.

It has it's decent share of immersiveness and crude scenery worth a look at and makes up fine for a walking sim at times (or even all the way through).
May seem too unnessessarily complicated, disordered and slow-paced in letting you have progress without getting bored or lost. Only seem so, i think. I often have to choose between playing in a state of drowsyness or not playing at all and mostly  been preferring the first option so far. And, for this reason, often losing my way or idea of what i'm doing, especially in games like this one, with no combat, extreme driving or steering or anything else of a kind to keep your eyes peeled and brain phocused on making fast decisions all the time.
Now that i've occasionally made it far enough to have gone to something looking like an intermediate ending covering three achievements (of 11 it has) and, right after the tytles, spawning you back to the last crossroads you chose your way on, it looks good and totally worth playing on to see what else is there.
To make a long story short - in my world it's (at least) an 8-of-10-ish  immersive and (in its own way) beautiful adventure game, totally worth trying unless you can't stand any standard part of this genre's games' routines like wondering about, seeing sceneries, collecting collectables, pressing buttons, solving puzzles, reading notes and trying to figure what you're doing all this for and whot you could've missed or done the wrong way.

[i]This review will contain light spoilers[/i].

Named after the Japanese word for ""circuit,"" [i]Kairo[/i] is an interactive walking sim that hurls you into its world without any training wheels. No tutorial, no opening cutscene. Rather, A vast white expanse and an ancient throne. Who are you, and what are you doing here? What are these buildings and dilapidated mechanisms? That's for you to figure out, all on your own.

Remarkably, the game manages to weave its puzzles, world, and narrative out of little more than low poly constructs shrouded in fog, low res textures, WASD + jump input, and an unsettling, foreboding soundtrack. Truly, a minimalist game if there ever was one. Yet it doesn't feel flimsy, unfinished, or rushed. If anything, the more you explore, the more it draws you in, as it teases new mysteries in succession. In its first area, you'll hear foreign language transmissions of numerical code and discover portraits of a ruined world. In the second, you'll find yourself under observation of a shadowy figure, whose static-filled visage appears everywhere. Further on, you'll find images of cultural and social significance, solidifying the link that this is somehow all tied to Earth, in a scenario reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's works.

[i]Kairo[/i] is not terribly long. Perhaps three hours, even when experienced without assistance. Thankfully, the game has built-in hints accessible from its ESC menu, specific to each challenge room. Its secrets, however, have no such clues, and may take hours to solve, unless you look up answers in player-made guides. These lead to a special developer room which gives a few insights as to its development and design, but falls short of filling in details of its largely silent plot.

As mentioned above, [i]Kairo[/i]'s most remarkable accomplishment is managing to do so much with so little. How do you create variety with controls limited to Dpad and jump? By utilizing mechanics centered around location, timing, and sequence. Some objects are triggered by your location in relationship to them, some need to be pushed (or toggled by touch), and others operate by how long you stand (or run) on them. You can no doubt think of many modern games that recycle a single mechanic throughout its run time, to serve as padding. [i]Kairo[/i] doesn't fall into this trap. Its handful of puzzle rooms feel mostly unique. When a mechanic does see reuse, it's either quick to pass or utilized for the purpose of data entry (drawing symbols, etc).

Given all the above, how does one go about appraising this game? It makes a number of polarizing design decisions, as indicated by the many existing reviews. Players looking for a meaty plot or clear objectives will be sorely disappointed, since [i]Kairo's[/i] primary focus is exploration, discovery, and reading between the lines. In fact, three of the most pivotal plot points are hidden in its secret rooms, one of which required outside help but makes no indication of this in-game, which understandably frustrated many (nothing about the game lends itself to multiplayer in theme or structure).

But credit is due the developer for choosing a risky path and sticking with it, and when considered from the confines it imposes on itself, it's an interesting study in game design. It provides a unique sense of accomplishment for players who stick with it, solving its puzzles via tinkering and experimentation. Although the garish color choices and claustrophobic view distance can be alienating, it comes together with an eerie and unnerving soundscape to give birth to an unquestionably tense atmosphere, one reminiscent of bygone first person adventure games. As for the plot? Whilst I agree that it tips into the ""too little"" category, the fact that it had me searching for answers, musing about its connections well after completion could also be considered a measure of success.

I recommend this title for aspiring game designers, puzzle fanatics, and fans of abstract, esoteric themes. I don't recommend this for people who crave closure and clear-cut objectives. If you're the latter, [url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/rama-3p8]I highly recommend Rama[/url], a phenomenal 1996 adventure game based on the novels, that hits on many of the same themes.

Usually I try to give games a fair shake before giving them a verdict, even if they can be somewhat strange. I didnt play this one for long, but I think Ive played enough of it to understand what I can expect until the end.

This game doesnt have a story. At least not one you can see while going through this world. Maybe there is something towards the end, but until then you dont really have much. There are some screens that can appear with obscured images on them, but they dont tell you anything.
The world in itself is made up of abstract geometric shapes (basically what you see in the pictures). You go through different chambers via portals, solving puzzles to get parts of keys or sometimes just going through corridors. This is accompanied by eerie background music. The visuals arent that good. And its not like Im expecting anything major, its just some places have a grain filter that makes the already unimpressive visuals even more lackluster. Lighting often doesnt help either. Often it can feel difficult to navigate because of it. Some objects you can go through because they dont have collision.
And the puzzles. Most of them require you to do busywork. Trial and error, waiting for setup. They arent fun. Some of them can be rather vague in what they expect you to do. Ive heard there is even a puzzle, which requires you to talk to people from different playthroughs to get their piece of the puzzle hint. It wore my interest out pretty quick. Granted, there are hints for each puzzle chamber and their is a kind of level map in the pause menu, so you wont get lost. But with the lackluster visuals and story I just dont want to bother.

If you look at the achievements, less than a third got the first zone done. Even more dropped off before finishing the second. That should tell you something. I wanted to quit before finishing the first zone, but decided to put in some more effort to be sure I wasnt being too lazy to try and get it. But aside from an eerie mood, there really wasnt anything there from making me feel bored.

It is a puzzle game but all puzzles in it aren't really puzzles. 

Problem 1:
Most of the puzzles are like: ""here are 4 buttons and here is the order that you need to press them in"". It is just Simon says over and over again in 10 different ways

Problem 2:
On the contrary, there are a couple of puzzles that require you to make giant logic leaps. The game doesn't give you enough information to arrive to the solution on your own. Thee was a puzzle that asks you to assign values to shapes and rearrange those shapes to form first 4 digits of pi...??? 

Another (optional) puzzle required you to draw a shape with 4 lines but the game only gives you one of them. I assumed that I'll find the other lines when I play through the game. But I didn't. The other parts of the solution are only obtained by ASKING OTHER PLAYERS because all players have different parts of the solution.
Don't get me wrong, I think that it is actually kind of amazing. EXCEPT! There's nothing that indicates that the solution is outside the game. There's nothing that hints that I need to seek help online. If the game somehow told me that information, I would've gladly started asking other players for their parts. But it did not.

How do I know the soulutions than? 

Problem 3:
There's a hint system inside that game, that can give you the solution in plain text if you are stuck. And if you need WORDS to tell the player how to solve a puzzle, why make a game in the first place... go write a book. Telling the player what to do is easy, but directing the player's thought process so that they arrive to the solution ""on their own"" is much harder. 

Problem 4:
There are 18 tiny glyphs on the walls in each area of the game. If you want a true ending, you need to look around every single wall to find all of them. That's just tedious, like everything else in this game

Problem 5:
Reward for the struggle
There are 3 optional """"hard"""" """"puzzles"""" and a few other requirements to reach the true ending of the game. Look up ""Kairo Secret Ending"" on YouTube. This makes me mad... Trust me it will not spoil the game for you, but it will save you a lot of time. The developer is a massive troll. While the game's meaning is open to interpritation, the secret ending has NO meaning. It is desrespectfull to the amount of time you put into the game.

Many puzzles are only hard, because you first need to actually visually identify all their elements and how to interact with them.
On top of that the visuals are unimpressive and the game suffers from useless long walking distances like they are currently popular with ""atmospheric"" games. They are just an annoying obstacle if there is nothing interesting to see along the way though. Without those the game would be at most half it's length.

the main draw is the graphics. the environments are abstract and beautiful. they have a cohesive style and personality, mostly of brutalist, monochrome architecture, and stylised, low-tech effects. completing puzzles also visibly changes the game world, which is nicely satisfying.
imagery of war is scattered throughout, but that theme never climaxes into a story.

the puzzles themselves are hit or miss. some are fun, others are so obtuse it's like they came out of a point and click. the main shortcoming here is that the puzzles are just that; there are some themes that appear in a few different puzzles, but for the most part, there's no cohesive element or theme that ties everything together. in many puzzle-platforming games, there's some sort of device the game is built around; portal has the portal gun, braid has time travel, and super mario sunshine has fludd. kairo does not have any sort of device, and puzzles range from connecting the dots, to drawing symbols, to correctly orienting dynamic objects; so this is where as a puzzle game it falls short.

also there's this one sound effect that's obscenely loud and it peaks and i hate it.

i still recommend it though, because of the beautiful environments, good soundtrack, and respectable level of polish. there's also a cool secret developer room, like the kind you find in old community tf2 maps that have development concept art and stuff. i just wish there was a disco room to match... maybe i haven't found it yet.",1604206450,1604206948,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The movement is floaty with your character carrying momentum from walking when you change directions. So much of this game is walking through literally nothing or landscapes made up of concrete texture cubes. Some areas are visually interesting but with the sole purpose of walking from one end to the other. Pushing objects takes ages for no real reason. Many of the puzzles in this game are trial and error, often revolving around pushing buttons with shapes on them. Others are incredibly straight forward.

The ""vision puzzles"" in the game are unlike anything else and are nearly impossible to solve. One of them actually is impossible to solve on your own in a single playthrough. You are given 1/4 of the solution to the puzzle (which is hidden in a completely separate area from where the puzzle is), requiring either multiple playthroughs and hoping you are given the other solutions over 4 playthroughs or by going online and getting the other 3 pieces. I've never encountered a puzzle game that requires you to essentially cheat to solve it. Someone serious about completing it on their own would look in every corner and behind every pillar and wall trying to find the other 3 pieces to the solution only to find nothing. In that way it's more of a big f you to someone taking the puzzle seriously.

I went into this game wanting to like it. Exploration games heavily rely on the visuals and I felt that for every interesting landscape there were two or three boring ones that were just rooms filled with a different colour with the same concrete wall and floor texture.

Everything about it - its grainy visual style, abstract and monumental architecture, haunting soundtrack, and almost complete absence of words and dialogue - combines to make it a thrilling discovery. After seven hours with it I'm left still wondering what it's all about or what it's trying to say, yet still satisfied at what I'd just been through. Almost impenetrable yet also in its own way fascinating. 

So what do you do? Functionally it's a first-person exploration game with mostly mechanical puzzles, which involve pushing objects, turning valves, aligning things, that sort of stuff. These puzzles are pretty much the engine room of the game, serving as both a mental challenge and the way of breathing life back into this world that Kairo presents you. The playing areas are large and it's very impressive watching the whole area come back to life after you've completed the puzzle. Along the way you can collect hidden runes, hear bizarre echoes of human voices long gone, see broken images of places that seem to hint of a connection to more familiar settings. It's essentially environmental storytelling, but it's extremely fragmented and abstract, tantalising but keeping you guessing as to the true message of the game. 

There are also optional puzzles, which - for me, anyway - were much harder than the main ones. The only one I have managed to solve so far was music-based, so was very challenging for me as I've got a very bad ear for pitch or melody! They are interesting diversions, but the meat of the game is definitely in exploring all these surreal, interconnecting areas that lie relatively dormant before you've put everything back together.

It's very heavy with atmosphere despite it's simplistic visuals, and has a surprisingly cohesive and specific story to it, all told exclusively through environmental clues. Honestly I think the storytelling is it's most impressive attribute, you may not understand it by the end but the hints are there. Electron Dance wrote a great article explaining it all if you're interested, though of course be sure to only read it after having finished the game yourself. If after reading it you think i'm weird for thinking it's so neat, I'll clarify: The story itself isn't why I'm impressed, but mainly by the way it's told.

Story aside, it's environments are a lot of fun to explore, it genuinely feels alien and as if you're exploring something you weren't meant to find. (Especially with the game's 3 optional hidden puzzles, 2 of which are practically unfair) Pretty much everything is made of basic geometric shapes, yet it still manages to have quite a heavy atmosphere. It's really neat as it's exclusively through shape, color, and sound design that it builds it's atmosphere from. Yet it still manages to be quite dense in that regard. The dark synth-y soundtrack gives this feeling of being somewhere you're not supposed to, but there's little moments of levity in some areas which really makes them stand out. It's really well done.

On the topic of puzzles, they're decent. There's good ones but the bad ones definitely stick out, there's 1 that's quite boring and 2 that are so vague I honestly don't understand how they passed playtesting. Thankfully the game has a hint system in place that resolves this though. (though 1 puzzle near the end still required me to look up a walkthrough as the hints weren't helpful enough) The fact the puzzles are mainly about reviving large ancient machinery keeps them interesting, where they would otherwise be bland. But there are still a few that are just genuinely good puzzles on their own. Overall I'd say the puzzle design is the game's weakest link, but the presentation of them is what kept me from finding them boring. One final note i thought was interesting is that you only interact with stuff by touching it, you never click on anything. I thought it was kinda neat how that fits the minimalistic design of everything else.

Overall Kairo has a lot of brilliant ideas, sticking so heavily to a minimalist design philosophy that it manages to make some things out of it that I hadn't thought possible before, mainly with it's storytelling and atmosphere. It suffers from it's puzzle design but thankfully the presentation prevents them from feeling like a slog. I think $5 is a perfect price for it.

- interesting puzzles
- a sound track, i think

but you also get an unfinished game which is fucked up since the game is out since 2013 and the dev didnt bother to fix simple mistakes

""unfinished"" game in this case means that 

- some areas are not properly textured
- you can walljump in some areas and on every slight slope (feels like a 89° wall would be possible to just jump up tbh)
- i got softlocked by the games reset function twice in 10 min (so far) (it places you where you had last contact with ground if you fall, means if you jump to a ledge where you cant get back from you are softlocked luckily a restart fixes this)
- there are walls missing

I had hopes for this game. It looked like one of those big, weird and mysterious atmospheric games. The sort of game that can absorb you into itself and keep you exploring and wondering what is this strange place and what is it about.
Unfortunately, instead of big, weird and mysterious, it turned out to be empty, same and arbitrary.
Game is full of the textures that look the same. Various objects and rooms seem rather arbitrary with no purpose or logic to them and most of the areas are really empty.
The wonder and mystery didn't really last long for me.

There are puzzles in this game, but they are really arbitrary as well. Some puzzles you can solve on your own, some puzzles just by stumbling around and some puzzles not at all. I got to a place where I couldn't progress. It appeared to be a puzzle, yet no matter what I did nothing would happen. So I back tracked to try and see if I could find anything really to help me progress, but I just ended up at the very beginning of the game.

Ultimately, I think the main issue is that spending more time than absolutely necessary in a room is what ruins the mystery and atmosphere. And if you like to explore, or if you get stuck in a puzzle, you'll start noticing the same repeating textures and the emptiness.
I think there's simply not enough in this game to make the atmosphere work. Every area looks like it's merely a bridge to the next area. It never really feels like I am exploring something, just going through a place with weird architecture and physics.

In terms of gameplay, it's a walking simulator with puzzle elements.

---In conclusion---

I've played a bit more than steam shows because of offline play... but honestly not much more.

I would not call Kairo a pretty game, for the most part levels are made up out of simple geometric shapes, simple particle effects and simple lighting. Honestly, it reminds me of stuff I used to make myself in Milkshape. The atmosphere is overall well done though because the room layout and design feels ""alien"" and you often don't know what you are supposed to do, or why you are doing anything, or where you are supposed to go. You feel lost, the place looks out of this world, and you have the nagging feeling you are missing something important.

But that brings me to my biggest problem with the game. The ""puzzles"" are all pretty simple it just takes a while to figure out what you are supposed to do. Solving them didn't feel satisfying or challenging, but the puzzles that take a while are frustrating because you end up just going ""what am I supposed to do? What can I even interact with?"". This is made worse by rooms that have no puzzles and are functionally hallways. You can waste a substantial amount of time exploring a room (which is again, not usually much to look at) only to move on to the next room in frustration. There are collectibles but they reward you with nothing other than an achievement if you collect them all (or an alternate ending apparantly but I never got that far).

Also, there is no real story to speak off. I never made it to the end of the game, so they may explain it all right at the end, but leading up to it... there is little to nothing. It teases you with fuzzy pictures, with barely audible radio-like dialogue... but it amounts to nothing. There may be a deep mystery that is very hard to solve at the bottom of these bread crumbs but it is so obtuse, so removed from the regular game, only hardcore fans will really dig deep enough to enjoy it. And this game does nothing to earn such devotion.

Without satisfying puzzles, nothing interesting to look at or experience, and no story, I can't recommend this game. It got the atmosphere right but little else.",1581478748,1581478748,False,5,0,0.548563718795776367,0,False,False,False,False,,,

ってかこのゲームにちゃんとしたエンディングがあったことに驚きですが。

まず、一見LSDのようなうろつきゲーに見えてその実MYSTという感覚です。
ゲーム内において一切の説明がありません。Escキーから開けるメニューに若干の操作説明と3段階ヒントがある程度です。
その肝心のヒントも「そこは分かってんだよ！」と思わず言いたくなるフワフワ感。
考えるな、感じろ、と言われているような錯覚さえあります。

メニュー画面ぐらいしか文字が無いので誰でもできる、という反面、抜群に不親切です。
いや、別に貶しているわけではありません。アンディーメンテ作品や初期のファミコンのような手探り感、もとい、プレイ方法すら試行錯誤して見つけるというところまでも""やりがい""としてカウントしている類の難解なパズルゲームです。

また、スクリーンショットでは実感できないぐらいにスケールが大きく、移動に結構な時間がかかります。一応、走ることはできますがちょっと速くなる程度なので、移動も楽しめる人でないとイライラするかもしれません。
そのスケールの大きさとボリュームを鑑みて520円は妥当だと思いますが、パズル大好きというほどでもなければセール時に何かとついでに買った方がお得だと思います。

廃墟が好き、遺跡が好き、うろつくのが好き、シンプルが好き、パズルが好き、多少難解でも根気よく取り組める、という人にはオススメできます。
逆に、探索は好きだけどパズルは苦手、短気、方向音痴、シンプル過ぎると飽きる、という人にはオススメできません。


以下、具体的なゲーム内容です。嫌な人は見ないように。


実態としては廃墟や遺跡のような無機質な建物内部に点在するパズルを解き明かして行く、というものです。
FPS視点、視界にプレイヤーの映り込み無し、WASD移動、マウス操作がカメラ、後はEscメニューで。

多分、全4ステージかな…？プレイ間隔が空いているのでうろ覚えですが…。
1ステージの中にパズルが幾つか存在し、それらを全て解くと次に進むことができます。
4つか。少ないな。と思うかもしれませんが一つ一つ規模がデカい上に、進むごとにさらにデカくなっていくので心配ご無用です。むしろ、もうお腹一杯まであります。
シンプルな地図がEscメニューで見れますが、部屋単位でしか見られないので方向感覚はある程度必要です。

パズルは直観的なものから覚えゲー、大掛かりな仕掛けを用いるものまで様々で、よくもまぁこんなに思いつくなぁと、この点に関しては感心するばかりでした。但し、全編通してパズルな分、幾らか理不尽なものもあり、youtubeに上がっている攻略動画をチラ見することも。
とはいえ、自分にとっては時間をおいて再プレイで解けるものがほとんどだったので、クリアまで漕ぎ付けられました。

また、各所に散らばっている白いシンボルを集めるという収集要素もあります。
自分は途中で気づいてクリアまでに半分ほど埋めてリタイヤしました。
クリア後は各ステージへと飛べるワープゾーンが解放されるので、収集要素はもう一度見まわる気力があるならクリア後でも良いでしょう。

もののついでで買ったゲームでしたが、パズルの難度を除けば自分は好きです。

+ The combination of unique architecture & creative puzzle environments lends the game a certain beauty in design
+ Cultivates both a spirit of exploration & a feeling of loneliness
+ Each area has a unique design & atmosphere
+ Can feel really quite eerie, though in an admittedly non-threatening sort of way
+ Puzzle hints are available to prevent frustration; the game does not penalize the player for using them

- Aged visuals & textures
- Limited replay value beyond an alternate ending

Furthermore, there is no real story to this game. Just a lot of walking and working out these surreal ""puzzles"" that make no sense and are completely arbitrary.

I enjoyed the puzzles. It's the same kinda deal as The Witness where you're just dropped in with no directions, no explanations, and no story. It is just puzzles for puzzles sake with some visual hints/scenes pointing to some kind of apocalypse. So if that's what you want then I can recommend this for you.

夜空に星座を描くパズルがあるのだが、解くためには鍵が4つ必要なのに、ゲーム中に登場する鍵はランダムで1つだけ。残りの鍵は他のプレーヤーと情報共有することを前提にデザインされている。つまり、攻略動画を見ろということである。

私はこのパズルを解こうとして、無駄な時間と労力をつぎ込んだ。音がヒントなのか、オブジェが鍵なのかと散々悩んだ。あげくに自力攻略不可と知ったときの虚無感といったらなかった。

他にも、実際は図形が鍵なのに、ボタンごとに異なる音が鳴るから「音がヒントなのか」と勘違いさせる素敵ギミックがあったりなど（一方で音が鍵のパズルもある。紛らわしい）、パズルゲームとしてのデザインは褒められたものではない。

ただ、全てのパズルが悪いわけではない。謎の文字の意味を類推して解くパズルは総じてよくできていて、やり応えがあった。

パズルゲーとしてはやや難ありだが、謎の遺跡探索ゲーとしてはよくできている。一見無駄に広そうな空間が広がっているが、実際にはエリアが細かく区切られているから無駄に歩き回らさせれることはなく、次々と新しいエリアを見ることができて楽しい。収集系の隠し要素や、ちょっとしたイベントなども用意されている。
落下死したり、モンスターに襲われたりなどの余計な要素がないのもいい。

I am so glad that I played Kairo after playing later, similar games (like NaissanceE and Fugue in Void) or meta-games *about* games like this (like The Beginner's Guide and The Magic Circle). Because playing this now is like going back in time to that moment when demoscene aesthetics were just beginning to coalesce into a new sub-genre (""brutalist-inspired 3D puzzle-adventure games""; wait, is that really a thing?). Or maybe it's more like playing the games made by the fictional designer in The Beginner's Guide. Kairo is wild. And, wow, does it have fantastic music and haunting ambient sound. Wear headphones, for sure.

The difficulty ramps up quickly, but fairly. My one complaint is that one of the solutions ended up being beyond merely challenging (the room with the [spoiler]two rotating gears with shapes in increasing numbers of sides; the fourth solution (pi) was just, ugh, seriously beyond me[/spoiler]), but the in-game hint system got me through it. And aside from that one problem room, I didn't need to use any other hints (or by the time I did try them, they weren't any use anyway) and I also avoided online guides. What I'm saying is that the puzzles were hard, but 
not at all impossible. The game's just about perfectly tuned so that puzzles feel inscrutable for *juuuuust* long enough to be really satisfying to figure out. 

When a game's solutions click into place like that, it really feels fantastic. It's the reason I love puzzle games, or even just puzzles *in* other kinds of games.

Instead of GLaDOS talking to you, you work on vision puzzles and machine puzzles and – if you're lucky – secrets scattered in the environment. But I mentioned the word 'minimal' already, and that one applies not just to the narrative, but to the audio, and to even the visuals as well. I think that there was intent there.

Kairo isn't a flashy, in-your-face experience. There is no combat, few puzzles are timed, and even if you fall off a cliff the game will silently and kindly put you back safe. It sits somewhere in-between games like Portal, Myst, Gone Home, Thomas Was Alone or … well, quite a few. The visuals are reminiscent of a minecraft world that's slowly being deleted, the narrative is subtle but keen, and the gameplay is really just a walking sim with some puzzles. The surreal is well and truly in place here, and so is the melancholy of being alone – though you never feel actively threatened in the moment. The atmosphere is occasionally very threatening, however, and I frankly think that that describes something more that Kairo could have been, something more fleshed out, more complete, and with more staying power. Sadly, this potential Kairo isn't what we got.

At the same time, it's not the most successful at what it actually does try to do. I believe it pulls in far too many directions, as alluded to above in the unfinished list. It's a very good experience, lengthened by puzzles more than anything, that you should be able to finish in a day, maybe two. And it's length, well, that's unfortunately a bit of a mark against it. So is the environmental storytelling – because in this case, this implementation of environmental storytelling, is a missed opportunity. Kairo could have been a Thomas Was Alone or a Gone Home, a game so good that it redefines the narrative potential of it's genre, a game that's powerful. Is Kairo powerful? No. Frankly, I came away with the impression of  'It was too late, but we did the thing we were supposed to anyway'. I won't say precisely why, but if the 'too late' wasn't so much a part of that, the game would have really spoken, I think.

As it stands, Kairo is a good experience that you should pick up for the five bucks or so it usually costs, if you enjoy puzzles and you don't have a longer experience on your list already.",1551013820,1574390066,True,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Certes, il a eu son petit succès ; mais même parmi ceux qui ont sorti la CB, une bonne partie s'en sont trouvé déçus. L'ennui et l'incompréhension sont les principaux reproches. Et on peut le comprendre.

Il faut dire que c'est un jeu très conceptuel, autant d'un point de vue graphique que sonore, que les couleurs vives et les sons étranges ne seront pas du goût de tout le monde. On commence près d'une structure grossière, perdue au milieu d'un vide blanc. Plus loin on aperçoit un bâtiment gris à l'intérieur duquel se rendre. On vogue alors de pièce en pièce en traversant des portails. Les salles sont souvent d'une taille colossale, chacune avec une teinte tranchée – vert, rouge, jaune, orange... Absence totale d'élément organique, aucun mobilier, juste du minéral ; des murs aux textures minimalistes, des angles aigus, des formes cubiques... et du vide. Le vide, d'ailleurs, on flirte souvent avec, mais heureusement la chute n'est pas punitive, et nous sommes aussitôt ramené sur le rebord.
Néanmoins, il faut dire que ces gigantesques espaces remplis de rien sont à mon sens bien plus perturbants que ne le serait un château perdu au fin fond de la Valachie.

Rapidement, l'on découvre certaines énigmes à résoudre. Aucun indice, aucune note, tout se fait par l'essai et les réactions sonores ou visuelles que nos gestes produisent. De ce point de vue, Kairo s'en tire très bien. La plupart des puzzles se comprennent vite, et pour ceux qui posent problème, le menu permet d'accéder à des astuces.

Au fur et à mesure de nos pérégrinations et du résultat de nos actions, l'on finit par se faire une idée de la raison de notre présence ici. On extrapole, on imagine... jusqu'à atteindre la fin qui nous donne une réponse satisfaisante, quoiqu'elle reste ouverte à interprétation selon le raisonnement de chacun.

It gives interesting puzzles, it does not punish you severely for mistakes, you can re-do anything you did wrong, or return to a missed puzzle later. Although there's no save-load mechanism, the game does not really need it. The autosave allows you to exit the game at any time to return to it later without losing progress, and since you are able to go back to any place you want, there's no need for reloading old saves. Gameplay is simple and effective, visual style, while a bit too simplistic for my liking, does not look too primitive like some modern games. The overall quality is very high, I've not seen a single serious issue, and only one minor visual glitch (a gap in the texture).

Still, there are some moments I didn't like.

First, some (not many) puzzles are way too hard. Mostly it concerns the optional or secret puzzles. On the one hand, they are supposed to be not too easy, that's the whole point. On the other hand, some of them are just absurdly difficult to solve without help (particularly, the so-called visual puzzles). But even in the main sequence there was one task I failed to solve and had to consult a walkthrough guide to beat it. Even after reading the solution, I didn't understand why it should work like that. I had to search for another guide with the actual explanation of the puzzle mechanics, and even that did not sound very reasonable to me. Maybe, it's just me, but all other main sequence tasks seemed way easier, this particular one was too out of balance.

Second, the colorful visuals has its problems. Having to work for considerable time in a fully-bright-red room was not friendly for my eyes at all! Others were not so bad, but still, some too-colorful rooms were not comfortable.

Third, might be a spoiler: [spoiler]there is a fake rune which I'm not sure whether it's a bug or a deliberate misleading feature, but it did cause me much pain, because it happened to be the first rune I've seen, and I couldn't do anything with it, so I thought all other runes were the same, and I didn't try to collect them even when I saw them. So after I found out about runes from the walkthrough, I had to backtrack to search and collect them.[/spoiler]

Forth, there is no way of disabling controller input which may be a problem for some. I have EDTracker attached; it is a head tracking device which represents itself as a joystick. So the game took that as a real joystick and started doing weird things (because obviously, the input sent by it is not anything meaningful). I had to physically unplug the tracker every time I played the game; there is no option to just clear the controller input in the options, the boxes are immediately filled in with whatever axis the tracker emulates.

Verdict: The listed problems are not critical, so I do recommend this game if that's your thing. Even if you get stuck there are helpful guides in the Internet and in the Steam Community hub (although I do recommend to try and solve the puzzles without help first, it's much more fun). I have no regrets with spending my money and time with Kairo, it's totally worth it.",1538776540,1538776765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This short indie game is very artsy. It manages to achieve a great arcane atmosphere with simple controls, a lack of plot, blocky graphics and eerie drone music. You can walk, jump & run – and that's it. Things are activated by approaching or stepping on them.

If only the game was more polished.

Moving around feels as sluggish as if every floor tile was a bit icy, and something as simple as turning while you have momentum can result in unexpected drifting. While walking! In fact, if you lose momentum while walking up stairs, you might get stuck a bit … Which is certainly no game-breaker, but it shows how unpolished some basic mechanics are.

I would say, the game design itself could have benefitted from some polish as well. See, you can solve a lot of the puzzles without understanding why that worked; and for some others, you might *never* get an answer to, as the puzzles just don't make any sense, or the solutions cannot be understood even in hindsight – even the person who wrote the (current) top Steam guide provides the solution for the clock puzzle but says they don't understand it.

There is one timed puzzle which you cannot solve unless you run – which the game never teaches you. Similarly (a minor nuisance), some other hints and collectible runes change the pre-established rules a bit (in the last world, nonetheless), and expect mechanics that have never been introduced.

I personally struggled with the ""minigolf"" puzzle where a ball bumps against Player-placed stone blocks and has to land in some hole. Why does the ball bounce off to the right?! Instead, marking the stone blocks with carved arrows could have easily conveyed to the Player that the direction cannot be changed; or better yet: the shape of the stone block could have been a right-turning tube block. Stuff like that could have helped, so that the majority of that puzzle solving attempt wouldn't have been wasted on trying to change the direction.

I personally didn't mind the monotonous music, but the simple graphics were in my case a bit too simple and too apalling in order to keep searching for the collectible runes without a walkthrough. It's just not fun to saunter through this place.

Kairo feels like a nearly-finished student project. I won't recommend it. It *can* be enjoyed, sure; the stuff I criticized isn't really *frustrating* … But honestly, there are better games out there that do the same.

I was not let down and I want more of the 'series', tho Antichamber seemed the best of its kind.
It's got small cons compared to all the pro points, only cus I can nitpick the shit out of everything: like being so cryptic and abstract and letting you walk through areas that are actually puzzles, not knowing you're supposed to solve stuff there. Without the hints telling me an Nth room is NOT part of the hub puzzles, I would've quit right there in the first hub, instead of going back to solve the transition room. And it's not that oh boi I had to go back, cus I did go back to places on my own accord after finishing the game, np. It's more about going 'Oh, this IS a puzzle!', in a frustrating way, instead of in a really happy, revelating way (like I experienced in Naissancee after finding the moving parts in a section).
But I got over it and was glad that there are more and better puzzles that were waiting for me.
Another small con is the feel of the game taken as a game like any other. It took me a while to get used to walking even, as you feel heavy and starting to move is like slowly accelerating from 0 to your normal walking speed, and actual movement is like sliding (like lowered friction and gravity), while running is not really a speed boost. Oh and some block collision pushes you backwards, making walking up certain stairs rather... funny. But no movement skill puzzles in the game, so this uncertainty of my position only added to 'oh no ima fall' when going towards an edge to look down. So this 'feature' worked out ok.
Which brings me to some other pros: Falling isn't punished, neither failing a puzzle. I mean sometimes you do need to fail as you first try out the room and see what it does, but I don't see it as a design mistake, specially if you're not punished and can start over or actually reset the room - neat feature!
The visuals have both pros and cons, the architecture overall is boxy but well planned and drawn out, with plenty of griebling and nice optical effects. Some structures/objects could've been made with custom models, like the made up coffins, which makes the game feel unfinished or poorly funded, but it really looked bug free (I couldn't pick up 1 of the beads on the string or w/e, and that's it, can't remember any other bug), which reveals a lasting, high quality finished product.
While the abstraction is used in telling the story and drawing a conclusion, to me it wasn't needed as a drive to move on, so I didn't complete all the hidden puzzles nor read the hidden meanings. For my soul it was enough to simply go from hub to hub and room to room, open area to another, solving them GOOD puzzles like a happy camper.

TLDR: Feels unfinished. Long list of outstanding issues.

Oustanding Issues:
+Movement inputs stay stuck for a perceptible window of time after letting go of keys making movements floaty
+Camera lags behind mouse cursor creating instant motion sickness and further imparting this input lag feeling to everything
+Environments float in black untextured space for no reason
+Environments are made of barely textured early3Dblocks composing small corridors. Easy to fall off the map
+Vew few assets per say, staircases, the occasional portal. Otherwise the 3Dblocks sometimes create little shapes, like a tree for example, but they are just clumsily stacked together as if made by a child
+Game involves reaching some kind of temple and exploring sublevels, presumably for a collectible but all I found was a different exit portals that returned me to the same portal I started at....
+Game has no narrative per say and just dumps you in
+Music is vaguely atmospheric but has some moments that perceptibly irritate the ear with buzzing background noises
+There is an annoying film grain to everything

Покупая эту игру на распродаже, я был готов к посредственной графике и прочим косякам, обусловленным бюджетностью продукта. Основной причиной покупки и вовсе послужил скриншот, напомнивший мне лестницы из ""Мора"" (до сих пор ловлю мурашки, при воспоминании о тамошних локациях), необычные цвета и надпись ""exploration"", которую разработчики поместили аж на первое место в списке ключевых особенностей (обожаю игры, в которых есть простор для исследований - от старомодных РПГ до относительно молодого жанра ""симуляторов ходьбы""). И, конечно же, я ожидал, что в игре с упором на исследования, будет что исследовать. На деле же почти все локации примерно одинаковые (различаются лишь цветом фона) и совершенно пустые. Никаких необычных строений, никаких интересных предметов и символов - ничего, цепляющего глаз. Просто нагромождение различных геометрических фигур, в большинстве случаев лишь отдаленно напоминающее какие-то постройки. Во многих ревью и тегах мелькает слово ""атмосфера"", но особой атмосферы я тут так и не заметил. Дизайн локаций - незапоминающийся; сюжета вроде как нет; звуков почти нет, но некоторые эффекты режут слух своей громкостью; музыка совершенно не цепляет и не создает нужный настрой. Так что где люди находят эту самую атмосферу для меня осталось загадкой - игра банально пустая. Чего в ней много, так это паззлов. Порой банальных, а порой неинтуитивных и совершенно нелогичных - попадаются даже такие, которые можно решить только усилиями нескольких игроков (или прочитав гайд). Стоит отметить, что труднорешаемых и не поддающихся логике тут заметно больше, чем простых. Медленное перемещение, ограниченное взаимодействие с объектами, неудачная структура уровней (из-за которой не удается окинуть всю локацию взглядом) - все это делает процесс решения паззлов еще более раздражающим. Вроде бы расписано все красиво, да и отзывы с оценками как от игрожуров, так и от простых игроков очень хвалебные, но по факту Kairo очень нудная, скучная и кривая игра, в которой нет ни одного аспекта, стоящего внимания.

I'm pretty sure that every puzzle game I've ever played had to be beaten using a guide. Therefore, I'm somewhat limited in what I have a right to say about Kairo. Which isn't all that bad, actually, because I still can't think of anything to say. I completed Kairo less than half an hour ago using a very well-written 100% guide here on Steam, and the experience has left me mostly speechless. So, what do I have to say about Kairo?

Well, I guess I can start by describing the game. Your protagonist is not technically a character, just a nameless, formless entity which serves as your window into the world. [spoiler] In fact, as revealed by end of the game's third part and by one of its final secrets, only two other characters even exist in this world, neither of whom are named, and only one of whom you will meet. [/spoiler] Kairo is not a game about characters. In the vein of a lot of walking simulators like Dear Esther, puzzle games like Submachine, and mixes of the two like The Witness, Kairo is a game about its world.

So, what is there to say about the world of Kairo? It's blocky, first off. The world is constructed primarily from stretched, stacked, and overlapping cubes, with the occasional sphere or disc thrown in, with colored fog fade-out in the distance. As for the world itself, I can only think to call it desolate. Kairo's environments are extremely varied, both in size and comprehensibility, but they all stand a chance of alienating you, which is something I found prevalent in Kairo: Alienation. The world around you is made from very simple shapes, but organized together into incredibly complex architecture. Often, you will find yourself on small islands of terrain within vast voids, which of course can make you feel very small in comparison to the world around you. Add to that the idea that you are the only entity occupying this world at the moment, and isolation combines with scale to create an impression that you are not just small within this world, but utterly insignificant within it.

That last part is a lie, however. You are not insignificant to this world. In fact, by solving its puzzles in some sort of ridiculous cosmic game, you will manipulate the great machines of Kairo to fulfill a purpose that may not actually seem clear until the very end. The puzzles in Kairo are, of course, the part I have the least right to comment on. As I am utterly terrible at puzzles, this really isn't a game I was able to play to its fullest. The game still does its best to make things accessible to people like me, however, through the hint system. In something like the style of the Professor Layton series, Kairo's puzzles operate on a three-hint system. The game menu provides a hint option, and in rooms containing a puzzle, that hint option offers you three click-to-reveal hints which progressively state what you're supposed to do in a certain room, and how to do it, more simply and directly with each hint. Of course, as most games of its type do, Kairo sometimes offers up puzzles so complex or esoteric that even the guide I followed could only describe the solutions to the puzzles, and not the logic they follow.

There are also secrets, of course. There are six runes within each of the three greater areas of the game, hidden in plain sight on the sides of columns or buildings so that you wouldn't ever see them by following the straight and narrow paths between portal doors and solving puzzles when you encounter them. Each greater area also contains a pedestal switch, which triggers a noticeable and often disorienting or unsettling shift in the immediate room, while also unlocking a very well-hidden door in a previous room in that greater area. Finally, each greater area has what's called a Vision Puzzle, which will not be solved through Hints and are most likely intended as a project for the player community to solve through examination and experimentation. Collecting all of these secrets in a single run of the game will unlock a small bonus area, containing few interesting easter eggs and a door leading to the secret ending, which is worth seeing for its sheer absurdity alone.


Everything I just said should be taken with a grain of salt, though, since I did just say a whole lot about a game that I don't actually think there's a whole lot to say about. At the end of the day, I loved Kairo mostly for the experience. The alienation and isolation of the game's vast world create a feeling I personally enjoyed, and the tiny puzzle pieces of a story the game gives you are interesting enough to keep the theorists guessing for a while. And finally, since this is a game I don't really know what to say about, even after saying so much, I want to express that I'm not recommending this game to anyone. If you disliked things like Dear Esther or The Witness, I don't think you'll enjoy Kairo. I'm reccommending this game to people who read this review and others, understand what people who like this game think about it and like about it, and then think, ""Hey, I might like that too.""",1503555257,1503555257,True,7,0,0.619801461696624756,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'd lean to calling it more of a visual novel, but then again there is no dialog. I've tried the game a couple times and just can't get into it. It feels more like an art installation than a game.

I bought the game in sale, because from the pictures it reminded me of the Star Gate series. I was wondering what it would be aboout. But, it doesn't offer more than what you see in the pictures above. Well... maybe I am not part of the target group. I like interesting puzzles, which you are able to solve on your own, when you think (like Portal), or games where the puzzles are challenging, you see the guide and you get it,  but here... I just followed the guide first third of the game and didn't get a thing. 

I would recommend this game to someone who:
- likes to explore unnown territories - such as pyramids
- likes creepy music
- likes games with no clear story
- likes games without a word, spoken or written - (here I don't get why the game comes in 5 languages, to have options in five languages?)
- likes puzzles with difficult-to-read hints (like a real ancient machinery)
- doesn't mind that he/she cannot see his/her legs and hands

From what I can tell, the puzzles vary in difficulty, and you do not need to solve the hard ones to progress in the game. To discover the secrets, you do have to explore the world thoroughly and solve the difficult puzzles.

Creo que me gustó. Y aún así, no lo recomiendo. No es para cualquiera, aún bajo el rótulo de ser un juego indie.
Kairo transmite desde el primer momento la sensación de que algo grande está por suceder. De que hay una metáfora detrás de todo lo que ocurre. De que el mundo onírico que presenta va a ganar coherencia con el tiempo. Y no. Y no. El juego avanza con puzzles que logran mantener el interés, aunque no abriguen casi ninguna lógica (la mayor parte de ellos son de prueba y error); lo terminarás y lo comenzarás de nuevo a ver si algo se entiende mejor, sacarás todos los logros (y los cromos!) y aún así no cobra sentido. Quizás esté más allá de mi comprensión. Hay detalles escondidos, imágenes de un tono post-apocalíptico, todos los escenarios parecen ruinas, se escuchan transmisiones de radio muy poco claras y un tanto angustiantes en varios puntos específicos del juego, y aún así... nada. Perdón si alguien se da por spoileado, pero en realidad es que el juego sólo crea más ambiente con eso; no es que lo use como pieza central. Tras cuatro horas y medias de juego, lo tengo al 100% y dudo seriamente volver a tocarlo alguna vez. Y no es eso lo malo, es que... simplemente deja una sensación de extrañamiento poco agradable.

[b]Kairo[/b], sorti en 2013, est un FPS d'exploration indépendant, où l'on incarne quelqu'un, qui explore les ruines de Kairo tout en résolvant ses énigmes.

[h1]Les plus :[/h1]

- Les énigmes sont sympas, sans être insurmontables. Par contre, je n'ai pas compris la logique de certaines, que j'ai un peu résolues par hasard.. (ou avec des guides, tant certaines sont... WTF ?)
- Possibilité d'avancer à son rythme, de passer d'une énigme à l'autre, sans se sentir bloqué.
- L'ambiance assez sombre, mêlé à la soltitude, est réussie.
- Une durée de vie respectable. Environ 3-4 heures pour finir le jeu. Rajouter 1-2h pour trouver tous les secrets.

[h1]Les moins :[/h1]

- Graphiquement vilain.
- Autant j'ai un esprit ouvert, mais là.. Je cherche toujours le sens caché du jeu, de son univers et de son histoire.
- Un gameplay un peu plus poussé aurait été sympa ? Car à part avancer sur des plateformes et sauter, c'est pauvre.

[h1]Conclusion :[/h1]

[b]Kairo[/b] n'est pas exceptionnel, mais n'en a pas la prétention. Ce petit jeu indé saura combler les fans du genre, à savoir, d'énigmes, et d'exploration. A prendre en solde.

Você joga em cenários bem coloridos e com uma sensação de vazio. Alguns cenários são belos e outros um tanto arrepiantes.

Você deve avançar solucionando os quebra-cabeças para prosseguir ao próximo local. O jogo em si não é tão difícil de solucionar, exceto os puzzles secretos que sem a ajuda do guia eu não teria a mínima noção de como resolver.

Usei o guia também para encontrar as runas, que são marquinhas minúsculas em partes do cenário do jogo que são muito difíceis de visualizar.

Os gráficos são bem ruinzinhos, mas o jogo foi feito por uma única pessoa, acredito que na engine de Half Life (mas nao tenho certeza).

A trilha sonora é boa, mas nada muito espetacular, apenas combina com o jogo.

[b]PRÓS[/b]

1 – Ambientação Legal;
2 – Rápido de platinar;
3 – Puzzles são em sua maioria justos, não tendo muitos daqueles puzzles sem lógica alguma;
4 – Apesar de ser um jogo indie, não encontrei nenhum bug.

[b]CONTRAS[/b]

1 – Gráficos bem meia boca;
2 – O movimento do personagem é meio estranho (você parece que está patinando no gelo), morri algumas vezes por isso.

First of all, I am aware this is a four year old game. Also, it's pretty cheap to request a €0,99 refund, I obviously don't care about the money. The developer just didn't put the required effort into the game, and therefore I do not wish to support. 

I bought the game because I was interested in the minimalist, brutalist artstyle of the game and I also have a taste for mystery and environmental puzzles. The developer however, appears to use the word 'minimalism' as an excuse to deliver a rushed game that is, bluntly put, really bad. Incoherent and even nonsensical game design is accompanied by lazy art (for example: symbols are created using text parentheses.)

There are many high-quality minimalistic, abstract games out there in the world; Kairo isn't one of them. If you're going to make a minimalist, abstract 3D environment you should at least bother to do some proper lightbaking and do some research into light and space in general because this game was rife with visual artefacts.

I understand the amount of time and effort that goes into game development, but I recommend spending five bucks on beers instead of this game.

There is a jitteriness to the movement, and if there was anything to make me sick, that'd be it. The controls are also kind of swimy, so it's kind of a sliding feeling which I wasn't much into.

The puzzles are satisfying, without being too obtuse. The hint system is welcome, which I only found necessary for one puzzle that required an unreasonable leap of logic. There are apparently deeper puzzles to solve once finished, and  a number of collectables to find. Sadly, I have the patience for neither, although I did my best to hunt round the levels all I could.

The visuals are striking in their simplicity, but are completely appropriate. The audio elevates the mood perfectly; it's utterly outstanding.

Тот путь в квадратах и эмблемах жизни той
Где я - солдат. И я, без памяти, искал
Ответ на тот вопрос, где я - живой.

И бьются в свете, бьются в мертвой тишине

Что не скрывал. Чего не требовал. Не ждал.
Что перестало волновать. Кого не стал
Я в перестрелке с тишиною ожидать.

The puzzles aren't easy but aren't difficult, and can usually be figured out without the hints in the pause menu. The soundtrack and atmosphere was eerie and the look of the game fit with it, regardless of being extremely undetailed. The simplicity isn't really that big of a deal, you can look past it and it's a good look for the game. The exploring was sort of linear, as I found every place I went to had a purpose and it wasn't so much of a ""return here later because you didn't do something yet"" which I personally like, as aimless wandering especially in puzzle games can be annoying. For an extremely indie game and for a very low price (I got it for like under a dollar), it's definitely worth your time. Achievements are fun to go back and get as well. For me personally optimization isn't all too good, I kept the detailing stuff off to make it run smooth (My setup can run GTA at Ultra, so take that how you will), but I can't complain as the dev is obviously not that experienced. I felt like the puzzles could've been a little more challenging and maybe the story actually developed into something (I felt like there was a story as to what the places you were at are, but nothing was ever explained), but regardless it was a good game and was definitely fun to play through.

Give it a try, it's worth it.

The feeling is not enought to make me actually keep playing it, the environments are not captivating enough and the non-existant story/objective is certanily not enough. So I will uninstall it.

Продолжим разбор инди-игр. Сегодня гейм-линчу подвергнется Kairo. Инди-проект всего одного разраба Ричарда Перрина. 

Археолог внезапно попадает внутрь некоего объекта, где ему нечего жрать, поэтому ему надо выбираться оттудова попутно постигая скрытый смысл. 

Первое впечатление, что мы находимся внутри космического корябля пришельцев. Геометрия пространства совершенно не человеческая. Кругом прямые линии и прямые углы, а также непонятные символы в виде пересекающихся дуг. Минималистичные пришельцы-конструктивисты зарыли в пустыне свой звездолёт? Ну, сейчас запустим его и полетаем. Пыщ-пыщ-ололо!!!111
Второе впечатление (после нескольких часов игры). Не, не звездолёт это. Есть мнение, что это наблюдательная орбитальная станция, которая находится вблизи Земли. Будущее? Прошлое? Да, в принципе, это совсем не важно.

Что же нам предлагается? Глобально требуется запустить некий механизм, состоящий из нескольких (3) частей. Заодно можно полюбоваться предметами, похожими на LCD-экраны, где мелькает что-то похожее на земные пейзажи и географические карты. Временами нам дают насладиться звуковыми передачами с помехами. Наш герой не мудрствуя лукаво, трогает всё, что ни попадя, и продвигается вперёд. Что надо делать и, что главное, для чего - всегда загадка. Но в итоге мы попадаем в зелёный мир, очень напоминающий обои одной известной операционной системы.*

Если автор хотел сделать эдакий хоррор, от у него он получился плохим. Со временем просто бегаешь и ""выполняешь задания"" чисто механически.
Если автор хотел сделать эдвенчуру, то у него она получилась плохая. Слишком мало изменений вокруг от действий игрока. Становится банально скучно.

Human Interface не продуман никак. Понять, что работает, а что - нет возможно только по появлению новых объектов и то это не всегда так.

Дабы затянуть время, в игре придумали поиск рун. Руны представляют из себя голубиный помёт на стенах. Искать [strike]и соскребать[/strike] его нужно исключительно ради ачивок.

Инди из меньшинства превратились в большинство, что явно не пошло движению на пользу. Одно дело сделать модификацию для AAA-игры, которая становится популярной, другое - делать что-либо на продажу. Такое впечатление, что именно погоня за дешёвым пиаром толкает людей на проталкивание в стиме своих незаконченных поделий. 

Я бы установил границу цен на всю индюшатину в 100 рублей. На большее она не тянет никак.

Is there a story? Is there any reason for me to care about it? After finishing the game, I don't really know. There are plenty of puzzles, most of them very very straightforward, where the harder ones are usually hard due to jankiness, such as aligning something based on your X/Y axis movements. The puzzle solving elements are OK, mediocre at best. One of the puzzles was, not even lying, 'press this button repeatedly until RNG decides you can solve the puzzle.' That's a bit lazy.

The environments are interestingly designed and laid out, but usually very empty, and monochromatic. It's a stretch to call ""make some shapes in unity and instead of designing interesting textures just make everything monochrome and overlay a grain effect"" stylish. If you set your field of view higher than 60 degrees (the default), you can see through walls. It seems like this game just barely functions as intended. The graphical complexity is very very low as well.

It's around 2-3 hours long, depending on whether you get stuck on puzzles. The soundtrack repeats often, changing between tracks in most rooms. Approximately 30% of the game is spent walking across large expanses that do not stay interesting to look at for that entire time spent walking.

Kairo needs you figure out the mechanic for each puzzle, unlike many other puzzle platformers, where a mechanic is introduced in the beginning and the game revolves around that mechanic (like Portal and the portal gun, Antichamber and the cube gun, etc). 
Here you don't need to learn anything, there's no tutorial section or equipment to obtain. Every puzzle is solved by moving about and going to the right place, sometimes at the right time.

Visually, the graphics are simple, Very simple. The grain filter (optional) makes them look even grittier. This felt fitting to the scenery and theme of the game, especially when coupled with the soundtrack. However, keep in mind that when you set the FOV higher than default, the camera will clip through walls.

The game is short. You can 100% it in a couple of hours if you don't loiter around and are fast at the puzzles. There's no actual story told to you, but you do see some things that give you substance for speculation on what is going on in this world.

Es gibt drei Welten, die aus zusammenhängenden Räumen bestehen. In bestimmten Räumen sind Puzzles zu lösen. Diese Puzzles sind ausschließlich mithilfe der eigenen Bewegungen zu lösen. Man schiebt Blöcke, tritt auf Schalter und sucht die richtige Stelle zum Stehen. Das klingt zwar sehr einfach, aber der Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt im Laufe des Spiels auf ein angenehmes Level.

Vorteile:
+ Die Atmosphäre, der Grafikstil, die Umgebungsgestaltung und die Hintergrundmusik passen perfekt zueinander
+ Die Puzzles sind mysteriös und fordernd, aber zugleich klar und simpel aufgebaut
+ Um ein Puzzle zu beginnen, muss man meistens zuerst einen Schalter finden, der dieses aktiviert. Das gibt die Möglichkeit, sich mit einem neuen Raum vertraut zu machen, bevor man mit dem Lösen des Puzzles beginnt.
+ Es gibt versteckte Symbole, die dazu ermutigen, jeden Winkel zu erkunden

Nachteile:
- Die Welt wirkt insgesamt etwas leer
- Es gibt zwar die Möglichkeit zu rennen, aber man ist nur geringfügig schneller
- Das viele Herumlaufen wird am Ende etwas langweilig

Kairo zerlegt Erkundungsspiele mit Puzzleelementen auf das Grundgerüst. Es beweist, dass auch ein auf das Notwendigste reduzierte Spiel ein besonderes und einzigartiges Erlebnis erzeugen kann.

The Garden segment in particular was a complete pain in the ass, as they randomly decided 2/3rds of the way in to completely change how the portals between rooms worked, and I spent a good half an hour wandering around the level hub trying to find the way forward because absolutely no indication was given that the decorative arches scattered around the level were teleporters, given that they weren't every time they had shown up in the set design prior.

I'm rating the game. And there isn't much here beyond a bare bones approach to the puzzle genre. I still recommend it for super cheap, but just barely compared to the rest of the puzzle genre.

Some of the puzzles are fun, some of the music has a nice ambient tone, and I guess the graphics are okay. But there isn't much here. This is archaic modeling, basic sound loops, and not much else to be quite honest. I mean, I can see why people appreciate indies, I'm just not sure why this game is worth my time. I come back to it and do a bit of a puzzle I guess because the game is in my library. But I'm not sure I will ever complete this game, and I don't really care.

I find the the extras to be tepid, and some of the puzzles are illogical or just downright irritating. This is not Myst, Obduction, Antichamber, or Talos, so don't even start to compare it to those masterpieces. It has nothing on them. This game is like a game some programmer set up in 1999 as a project to test out a graphic engine. It's okay.

But I really cannot 100% recommend stuff like this when there is so much more out there. It's one of those games, because it has a decent tone to it, that I will give a 5.5/10.

１フロア１パズル形式のパズルです。その数か所をクリアすることによって、別の新しい道が開けてきます。それを繰り返してエンディングを迎えるのがこのゲームとなります。”ｘｘｘに映る、ｘｘｘは果たして何なのだろうか？”
・難易度
簡単の物から難しいものまで 色々あります。難しいようならば、３つのＨｉｎｔを駆使しながら 攻略しましょう。一部フロア内にもhintが隠されていたりもするので、気を付けてさがしてみると良いかもしれません。それでも無理なら 、最終手段として、コミュニティ内の動画などを参考してみてください。
・感想
クリアまでに７時間程度かかりました。（勘のいい人ならば、初見２時間位で攻略できそうですけど）そのあと実績解除するために自力でクリアを目指して挫折。クリア動画をみながら全実績を解除で１２時間となりました。フロア全体を使うギミックはとても面白く、演出も凝っていて 良い感じです。ストーリーに関しては語られておらず、自身で補完していくタイプです。

The overly simplistic architecture I can deal with, but the use of a single texture for the ENTIRE game belies an absence of effort, instead of a deliberate intent for purpose or artwork.

できるのは歩くことのみ。

それらの法則を見つけて、仕掛けを起動させると、少しずつ世界が変化していきます。

このゲームで良かったと思うのは、一度見たら忘れられない世界観。
人の気配がまったくなく、それでいて誰かに監視されているような感覚がずっと続きます。
暗闇、巨大なもの、未知のものに対して感じる本能的な怖さをおぼえました。

かなり苦労しましたが（気がついてみれば些細な勘違いでした）、
時間をかけていろいろと試せば、そのうちに解法が見えてきますし
数を試してごり押し気味に通ってしまったところもあるので
理不尽に難しいところはないと思います。
どうやら隠しエンドがあるようなので、そちらはわかりませんが・・・。

廃墟や遺跡が好きな人、一人称パズルが好きな人にはおすすめです。
あと、おそらく10人いれば10通りの考察があると思うくらい謎めいた雰囲気がありますので
そういったのが好きな方も。

Though Kairo is missing a neat mechanic that other more famous first person puzzle games have, it does have very clever puzzles in a fantastic geometric environment. Though some may argue that Kairo is a walking simulator, I would say that it is more than that.

Now, as with many puzzle games, the difficulty curve is very important. Kairo does not hold your hand through play, but it does give you some idea on what to do. The curve is very good, as the difficulty does ramp up slightly while the puzzles become more interesting. However, there is one puzzle that is based around your position on a platform which, personally, I had to look up a solution as it was very difficult to understand. Other than that, the game succeeds in having very good puzzles in a gorgeous environment.

The soundtrack in nothing spectacular as it is just ambience, but there is no loop which is great. Story is non-existent, which is fine as you do not need a story for this type of game.

They aren't really original either; press these things in the right order (not even halfway through the game, I ran into a few of those), push this thing around, move to some particular, non-indicated location (that showed up about 5 times so far in the second ""world"")
They're also slow.  Like, press a certain 2 buttons in a giant room.  Or push 4 boxes around a huge room while you wait for  a ball to bounce around like a snail.  Or wait on a button while a slow cube spins 360.  Or walk 3 flights of stairs in a room without any puzzle at all.  Or just walk on *nothing* to some non-descript platform in the distance.
They're also poorly constructed.  Don't make the geometry such that I can get caught in a place I'm only supposed to push a ball.  Don't throw random barriers and little pathways that look traversible but lead to nothing (or maybe lead to a tiny rune thing which disappears before you even know what you did)

However, I figured out everything except for the secret ending without any outside help. First, note that it is practically impossible to get truly stuck. Yes, you may be unable to solve a puzzle, but you cannot break anything so that it is unsolvable, and you cannot get trapped anywhere. I encountered no glitches at all, which is definitely a plus.

There is an in-game hints system, which I do recommend using. Be prepared for some backtracking (the game makes this easier later on), and to write down everything. Some things look like puzzles but aren't. Some puzzles can be solved through a simple trial-and-error approach, others require finding the clue or simple logic.

I say ""simple"", though there are a couple of rather fiendish puzzles in here. Investigate everything. Try everything. Like I said, this game is impossible to break.

There is no save button, the game simply saves when you quit - which made me a little nervous but always worked as intended. There is no way to return to an earlier save, but there is also no reason to want to; unless you want to solve the puzzles again, in which case you should start a new game.

Let me first say that I usually tend to like abstract games, as well as had a few good ""walking simulators"". However, I don't find Kairo to be one of them.

On the question of whether games can be art, Kairo certainly makes a solid case for a 'yes'. Within the individual levels, there is certainly a sort of surrealistic atmosphere that remains intact despite the used engine (I think unrealED 2.0) itself being pretty outdated at this time.
However, my gripe is mostly that this theme isn't consistent between levels. There is no natural progression or any overarching sentiment that ties the levels together. Each and every one could have been the first, somewhere in the middle or the last one.

And while the atmosphere is okay (even good), the puzzle aspects feel tacked on and added ""because it's expected"". They are rudimentary dabblings that IMHO doesn't add much. I had no fun in solving them (or attempting to), and frankly found myself bored more than intrigued.

This one's about solving some puzzles [spoiler] in a hyper dimensional alien space to turn some machines on [spoiler]after the apocalypse.[/spoiler][/spoiler]
Graphical design is going for minimalistic abstract representation of stone buildings, so I'm certain there's less than 100 textures in the entire game. Explorable empty space is used to show importance of an object in the room, and over-saturated lighting is used almost randomly, but consistently through a room.
Sound design follows graphical design, and follows a theme of emptiness and alienation in an abstract world.
The physics and control are poor, but only because they are unnecessary for the gameplay.
Gameplay itself is puzzle solving in isolation, but the main story puzzles are simple. It's a small game that takes time to explore for 100% completion. The 100% content beyond the main story puzzles just involves finding hidden things and backtracking after hitting an obvious switch to find a matching shape [i]somewhere.[/i]

It requires a bit of investment to stay interested in the beginning, but if you're into discovery and piecing together parts of a mystery, it eventually rewards that patience.

In the beginning, you appear in Kairo with no explanation of who you are, where you are, what its or your purpose is, and no apparent indication of what you should do next, other than possibly head towards the one visible structure in the distance. Hints as to possible answers to all of those questions gradually unfold as you proceed through the three main levels of the game. Ultimately, the game never concretely answers any of those questions, but gives you enough (especially if you're determined to hunt down and unlock all of its sometimes-obscure riddles) to put together [i]your[/i] guess, [i]your[/i] interpretation of what you've just been through. For some this may be frustrating, not to know the absolute official canon truth of the matter, but I see it as one of the game's strengths in creating a real sense of mystery. This is not your typical berk-without-a-past-uncovers-his-past story—however much you discover, you remain without a past.

The game suffers from some minor flaws in execution—the occasional video clipping problem in tight spaces, oddly getting stuck on stairs and needing to jump to continue, footstep sounds that are weirdly unsynchronized to your movement—that reflect a slight lack of polish. For me, these minor issues pale in comparison to what the game achieves artistically. It manages to create, through the grand scale of its environments, the use of colour, and its moody, atmospheric soundtrack, a feeling of being very small and alone in an intimidating, unknown world which is somehow broken and needs fixing. The puzzles involved in the fixing range from trivial to frustratingly obscure, but for the impatient there are guides and walkthroughs, and for the determined, there's a great sense of accomplishment in untangling the secret.",1464341365,1464341365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, I only got an hour into this game and was completely bored by it.

The graphics look like they were made in the mid-90s; things like the original Unreal had higher poly counts than this does, and more graphical cohesion. Just about everything is done with blocks and the textures, in-as-much as they are even used, seem to be just tossed on to objects as almost an after-thought. Even ""water"" is just a bunch of disconnected rectangles. Rooms have seemingly random color selections, with almost everything being very monotone (a violet room, a red room, a grey room, etc.) There is no way to know if the fog means you'll fall, or you can walk on it (like the intro area). In fact, there's no way to know if a block is meant to be walked on or not except to try and see if you go through it or not.

Gameplay is very simplistic. You can move, move faster (run) and jump and that is all of the controls. They have the option to do this all with the mouse, but since the game doesn't bind the mouse cursor, this doesn't work well with my 3 monitor set up since I jump out of the game the next time I click to start walking after turning around.

Like everything else, the puzzles are very minimalistic. The ones I could find were very easy to solve. However, several of them you cannot even tell if they are puzzles or not... or even what you should be doing.

[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=672171036[/url]
For example, in one (red) room in the second area, there are a bunch of pedestals that make sounds. If you look up, you see stars above them that have lines drawn on them from the last 4 pedestals... and no indication of what you should do. It has a triangle in the middle that is aligned and shaped without matching the stars, so there is no indication which of the many triangle shapes you should be making, or if that is even the correct thing to do. I spent probably 20 minutes making various triangles in that room, to no avail.

In another area, there were what looked like a lot of pods that had screens on them. Most of the screens had static, but one showed a low-res version of what you were seeing, and a couple others showed something else. The significance of this place was totally lost on me.

Also hidden in the game are tiny symbol things you can collect for... no known reason at all. They seem to largely be hidden in various rooms, so trying to collect those turns into the ""look very closely at every wall from every angle"" sort of thing... it was getting tedious.

The ""world"" is also very minimal. It is just a bunch of separate ""rooms"" with portals connecting them. There is no real plot to be found, no idea why any of this exists, who you are supposed to be, or what the point is to ""solving"" the puzzles. It felt pointless, and not really rewarding for solving anything.",1461511038,1461511445,False,3,1,0.480159848928451538,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Rein gameplaytechnisch ist Kairo nichts besonderes, man läuft in der Egoperspektive durch die Level und löst Rätsel, einfach nur dadurch, dass man sich bewegt. Manche Schalter reagieren direkt darauf in welche Richtung man sich bewegt, andere Rätsel bestehen schlicht aus Druckplatten und ähnlichem.
Diese Rätsel sind jedoch ziemlich gut umgesetzt und nutzen die scheinbar geringen Möglichkeiten sehr gut aus.
Dazu erwähnenswert ist, dass die Rätsel welche notwendig sind, um das Spiel zu beenden durchaus eine kleinere Herausforderung darstellen, jedoch nichts von dem man Kopfschmerzen bekommen sollte.
Die optionalen Rätsel, die Bonus""sequenzen"" freischalten, sowie ein Secret-Ending sind jedoch um einiges schwerer, diese habe ich nur Mithilfe eines Guides lösen können. 

Auch technisch ist das Spiel nur ganz ok, ab und an gibt es FPS-Einbrüche, welche bei diesem Gameplay jedoch kaum ins Gewicht fallen, der Sound hingegen ist ziemlich gut gelungen und trägt genauso wie die, eigentlich sehr simple, Grafik perfekt zur Atmosphäre bei. Und jetzt kommen wir zu dem, was dieses Spiel so wunderbar macht, was es aus meiner Sicht mehr zu einem Artgame als einem Puzzlegame macht.

Das Spiel hat eine Story, wenn auch nicht offensichtlich und erzählt diese komplett ohne Text (Geschrieben, gesprochen, wie auch immer) mit einer genialen Atmosphäre, die zwischen beinahe Horror zu hoffnungsvoller Entschlossenheit (Und allem dazwischen) hin und her schwankt, je nach Ort an dem man sich befindet. 
Die Story selbst basiert vor allem auf der Interpretation des Spielers, die Bonus""sequenzen"" können zwar zusätzliches Licht auf das ganze werfen, sind aber nicht zwingend notwendig um auf die ""richtige"" Idee zu kommen..

Il mondo di Kairo è molto elementare, è essenzialmente fatto di cubi disposti a formare curiose strutture e bizzarre architetture sospese nel nulla, stanze con pochissima varietà di texture ma ognuna con un particolare colore a distinguerla dalle precedenti. La musica ambient/minimalista è azzeccatissima e contribuisce a rendere questo strano e inquietante mondo a cubi ancora più onirico e straniante.
In Kairo non si può morire, se si cade verso il nulla si torna semplicemente da dove si è caduti. E ci si ritrova a perdere parecchio tempo a, semplicemente, esplorare: ""C'è una strana struttura di cubi in lontananza, posso salirci?"" Certo che sì, anche se non serve a niente, a parte vedere il mondo da un'altra altitudine. 

Kairo ritorna proprio alle basi del videogioco in prima persona, dando come detto estrema libertà di non fare niente di particolare, ma facendolo benissimo e presentando al contempo un buon numero di enigmi necessari a proseguire.
Ognuna delle tre macro-zone contiene al suo interno un numero variabile di stanze, nelle quali sarà necessario risolvere degli enigmi per ottenere le parti di una... chiave, chiamiamola così, necessaria per passare nella prossima zona. 

E qui sta l'aspetto migliore di Kairo, che sembra attingere a piene mani dai vecchi giochi del passato come Myst: gli enigmi non hanno quasi mai una spiegazione esplicita, nessuno vi dice che cosa dovete fare per risolverli, dovete provare a fare ciò che potete, vedere che cosa succede, e cercare di combinare queste intuizioni per risolverli correttamente. Altre volte il suggerimento necessario a risolverli è invece nascosto nella stessa stanza, magari inciso in qualche strano modo su una colonna, o cose del genere. La perfezione di questi enigmi è tale che non finirete mai col dire: ""Beh, l'ho risolto a caso, ma non aveva senso."", come succede in altri giochi simili. No, il senso c'è sempre, sta a voi capirlo, e la soddisfazione di quando si riesce a risolverli con le proprie forze è davvero grande.

Kairo presenta anche diversi enigmi facoltativi basati sui suoni per i quali probabilmente vi servirà una guida, come anche la ricerca di piccole rune dipinte in vari posti nel corso del gioco, che una volta trovate tutte sbloccano il finale alternativo. 
Insomma, un (neanche tanto) piccolo capolavoro che qualsiasi amante dei giochi ad enigmi dovrebbe provare, e uno dei miei titoli preferiti di sempre.",1459535613,1479930001,True,6,0,0.560226738452911377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Инди-проекты продолжают развиваться и занимать своё место среди ААА-эшелона/конвейера. Мне, любителю головоломок, попался необычный проект от студии Locked Door Puzzle.

[b][i]Kairo[/i][/b] - игра, разработанная одним человеком - Richard Perrin, с музыкальным сопровождением от Wounds (Bartosz Szturgiewicz). Честно говоря, перед покупкой меня одолевали сомнения - инди игра, команда из одного разработчика, головоломки... Что может из этого получиться? Опыт подсказывал не нажимать кнопку ""В корзину"". К счастью - опасения не оправдались.

Первое, что ощущаешь и замечаешь - это минималистичная атмосферность. В первые 20 минут меня просто затянуло в мир сфер, гигантских пирамид, кубов, памятников... и одиночества. Мир Kairo. Одна сторона монеты - это одиночество, своеобразная меланхолия. Ощущение, что я действительно один в этом мире, измерении, - не покидало меня до самого конца. Но это, скорее, не угнетало, а наоборот подстегивало к действию, к другой стороне монеты - желанию понять, где я, что же тут произошло, и почему остался один.

Для меня до сих пор остается загадкой - был ли этот мир клочком опустевшей Земли будущего, либо же это всё симуляция, своеобразный эксперимент? Или же первое - это последствия второго? Единственное, что мы видим - это остатки былой цивилизации, способной воздвигнуть огромные структуры и удивительные механизмы.

Каждое продвижение по миру сопровождается интересным, оригинальным музыкальным и звуковым сопровождением. Различные секции/главы содержат в себе разное настроение для игрока. И когда спустя какое-то время спокойной, меланхоличной игры она вдруг становится мрачной, жуткой, подавляющей - это действительно пугает. Kairo - это не хоррор в привычном стиле, но каждый шорох, голоса, звуки механизмов звучат пугающе, заставляют вздрогнуть, особенно когда знаешь, что тут - ты единственное живое существо.

Графическая составляющая, хотя и довольно минималистична, приятно вписывается в атмосферу, создавая ощущение какой-то футуристичности происходящего. И этот минимализм позволил разработчику создать довольно интересные головоломки.

Головоломки - это основная составляющая игры. Они построены так, чтобы от игрока требовалось минимальное взаимодействие с предметами и представляют собой сочетание звуков, визуализации и сюжета, создавая ту самую атмосферу. Текстовые инструкции и специальные фоновые подсказки (звуковые или визуальные) делают Kairo весьма элегантной и вполне решаемой игрой. Здесь необходимо уделять пристальное внимание каждой мелкой детали каждой головоломки и устанавливать взаимосвязь с отдельными элементами. Игра не всегда качественно показывает подсказки или подсветку неявных элементов для взаимодействия, поэтому в некоторых местах приходится потратить больше времени, чтобы их выявить. Полезным будет обращать внимание на детали самой секции. В то же время игра не заваливает загадками, не торопит, не заставляет почувствовать себя глупым - она мягко подталкивает к изучению необычного и интересного мира.

Проект, созданный Ричардом Перрином, в каком-то роде требует внимания к себе: надо расслабиться, двигаться медленно, быть наблюдательным и рассматривать окружающий мир - эта тонкая и элегантная игра, которая требует вдумчивости и не терпит спешки, хотя и не штрафует за это.

В данной игре жанр инди предстал для меня в положительном свете, в ней чувствуется душа, а не погоня за продажами. Думаю, я еще вернусь в неё однажды - у меня остались незавершенные загадки и открытые вопросы, ответы на которые, надеюсь, смогут пролить свет на туманную историю этого невероятного мира - Kairo.

Imagine LSD: Dream Emulator but texturally subdued and transformed into a relatively linear puzzle game, with just a dash of the Assassin's Creed 2 glyph sequences for flavor.

The graphics and designs of the game are unimpressive, but not uninentionally so.  The minimalism of both the visuals and the music create a complexly desolate atmosphere, and, like LSD, the emptiness of the world never comes off as a result of laziness but of tasteful restraint.  It's easy to fill a puzzle game with distracting elements that intrude on the experience as a whole, but it's refreshing to see one that makes an enjoyable experience using only movement controls and basic graphics.

In the vein of games like Fract OSC, Antichamber, The Devil's Tuning Fork, and Against the Wall, this is a game that does not hold the player's hand at any point and does not even provide any form of communication or instruction to the player until the ending, allowing for total uninterrupted exploration, and the game is intuitive enough to keep going at a steady pace regardless.  This makes sense in an internal way, as well, as the game is set in a long abandoned universe in which the player is a complete stranger.

The ending is a bit cheesy and the sequences that reveal the world's story are unoriginal at best.  I was also unimpressed by the various photographs and videos that attempted to connect Kairo to Earth, which appear incessantly throughout the game just incase the message wasn't received the first few times.  In a puzzle game that involves some amount of thought in order to progress, this felt patronizing and undermined the feeling that the game developer trusts the player to make the connections themselves.  The alien and deserted tone of the game was also diminished by this forced message, which left me wishing that the game had remained mysterious and totally detached from the real world like it initially appeared.  It seems as if the game was created first, but in the later stages of development the developer decided to tack a deeper story onto the game, conflicting with the original vision for the project.

Bland connotations aside, I didn't expect to spend nine hours in this game, and it says something about Kairo that I can spend a day backtracking through every area multiple times in order to unlock the achievements and the secret ending and still have fond memories of the experience (even if the secret ending was a massive disappointment).

Ultimately, I would recommend this game if you want something that has a poweful and moving atmosphere, but if you're just looking for a puzzle game then look elsewhere, as the puzzles here aren't as memorable as the overarching experience.",1458699879,1458701779,True,2,0,0.49801105260848999,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Interesting concept.  Abandoned? quantum distorted world of unknown purpose and design.  As the player traverses through this alien world? they complete tasks to restart machinations in three locations: the ""lighthouse/power"" room, the ""engine"" room, and the ""control"" room.  Why? and for what purpose? is left for the player to decide but the end shows the revilitalization of the planet Earth.  Many questions are left open, most starting with W, as in What happened? Why? When? Where is kairo? What is kairo? But the most intriguing question I find is Who is the player really?  An unknown entity? A survivor? An explorer? A tasked performer of intergalaxic goodwill?  

Gameplay: Walking simulator with point and click elements, no inventory, just ""touch"" to perform certain tasks.  A puzzle game that focuses on solving how to restart the massive machinations of world building proportions.  

There are extra ""finds"" to be looked for in each area: 6 runes and 1 ""vision"" puzzle to find and solve.  Once all of these are found in every location a ""secret"" ending is revealed.

Good soundtrack. Well, sometimes I felt a lack of it. In such cases, I usually turn on something on my own (ambient would be appropriate here), but not this time. The Silence. Silence of dead world. Only ruins of forgotten ancient civilization. Only you and your thoughts. Sometimes you can here someone voice. Man repeating ""zero"" or counting in russian ""five, six, seven"".

Good atmosphere. All that place remind me of piramids. Acient civilization, secret knowledges way beyond ours. But devistated world. Looks like one of scenario of human race.

于是始终不清楚这个游戏到底想表达什么内容。顺便一个例子，在游戏支持页面写着这游戏不支持中文，不过我在游戏其中一个区域（红色，社区指南称此区域为Tree）听到了中文语音（“一百八十八号”，后面的词一个都没听清）...是仅仅为了营造一种氛围而已？

Gameplay only requires moving and the rare jump and nothing else.

Gameplay: The puzzles are usually pretty decent and not too difficult to figure out. However, there are times when it takes too much trial and error and guesswork rather than intuition and observation. I played through this with a walkthrough open in another tab because I found myself getting frustrated with certain puzzles. Most of them, however, are pretty straightforward. Besides the puzzles, this game is a walking simulator with some interesting environments.

Graphics: Nothing special. It runs well and is ocassionally pretty to look at, but is mostly pretty bland.

Level Design: The environments are neat but I felt like it could've been designed better and been more polished. I've played loads of other trippy indie games such as this, and this one really felt like it was lacking in level design creativity. Most of the environments are pretty blocky and boring, and every room is a different shade of one color. 

Story: As is common with these strange indie games, the story isn't too important. From what I gathered, you're exploring old ruins and contraptions and you're reactivating them, bringing life back to these environments. That's the jist, it's nothing special.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience, and the length was just about right. If it had gone on longer I feel like I would've gotten sick of it. There's lots of secrets to keep you busy if you're an achievment hunter, but the gameplay wasn't interesting enough for me to find all of the secrets.

Kairo is a isolated world in a unknown mysterious world, where you have to figure out puzzles that most of them make absolutely no sense at all You must try them countless times before u can solve them (Most likely by guessing).

The sense of being totally alone, and the big and small places, fit quite well with the game atmosphere,  it gives you a good experience, some parts are a bit creepy tho. 

After beating the game, I still have no idea what just happened, and Its just amazing that way.

What am I even doing?

Kairo is a very beautiful and ambient puzzle game with zero help and is the complete opposite of linear. It had puzzles and walking parts that have no connection and will leave you completely lost 95% of the way, some people may like that but it was a massive turn off for me. I used a guide for most of the game just so I could get it finished and write this review. 

My girlfriend tried it so I could make sure it wasent just me not knowing what I was doing, shes very puzzle smart and gets these kinda things really easily, but she became frustrated at the lack of help you are given. Most of the puzzles have no logical conclusion and will just make you guess forever until you figure it with just blind luck and perserverence.

What it does right is make a story and really get the feeling of mystery and uncertainty embeded into the entire experience.

With a guide it took me 3.5 hours to complete, without I would say if you didn't go insane already and forgot what time even is it will take 10+

I really wanted to recommend this game, I bought it on sale thinking it was going to be this amazing ambient adventure with clear colours and pretty shapes but I really can't, it just makes no sense.

It had promise and if it had just a little help to give you it would of been three times the game it is, but all I experienced was a mess of beautiful art.

Mas há uma primeira coisa que se pode dizer sobre Kairo: você está realmente sozinho!

É como se tivessem te enviado a um lugar nunca visto, porém ao mesmo tempo muito familiar. Enormes estruturas arquitetônicas parecem remeter a alguma civilização antiga ou pré-histórica... Talvez alienígena...? Ou mística?? Você percebe os símbolos, mas não sabe dizer o que são.
Se tudo parece ser de cimento e concreto, de fato não importa, a sensação é sempre a mesma: um lugar desértico, inabitado... mas que possui uma história! E é exatamente isso o que nos mantém até o fim: saber o que aconteceu e por que você está aqui! A maioria dos lugares e os cenários são monumentais e sua variedade demostra enorme criatividade. Em cada lugar que se chega, existem partes da estrutura destruída, percebe-se que algo realmente deu errado. Seria um meteoro que passou aqui? Por que bem aqui?? Até que... Vemos retratos do planeta Terra; sua história, sua cultura, sua ciência.. O que realmente está acontecendo aqui? Aliás, o que aconteceu? O que é este lugar??

Cada parte de Kairo que é resolvida parece ter sido um conserto, faz algo funcionar. Tudo é como se fossem engrenagens de uma grande máquina. E que você não sabe pra que serve. Apenas continua (esperando saber).

Os puzzles, em sua maioria, não chegam a ser difíceis. O que realmente pode frustrar em Kairo é que a cada coisa revelada, ficamos com ainda mais dúvidas. O mistério aumenta e você segue adiante.
Pode-se sentir, à medida que se avança no jogo que tudo está para se revelar de uma vez.

Pros:
+ minimalistic environment done well
+ ambient music changes
+ most puzzles can be done in a reasonable manner by logic thinking
+ makes you wonder what you are doing with your life 
+ shattering sound caught me off-guard and made me flinch

Cons:
- no real story-driven experience, this story could make the harder puzzles have a logical explanation too (which they do now aswell, you just don't see how the puzzle fits together), these harder ones however I was unable to do without a guide for the simple fact I don't want to run around 30mins clueless without any form of interaction that you could use get to the correct area in the game",1448363806,1448363806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557747505

The 3D world of Kairo is made up of very basic geometrical shapes, usually being combined to almost give the appearance of a more complex structure.
The grittiness, sparseness and colors pervading each room is part of what I think, creates the game's strongest characteristic: its ambiance.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557717729

The soundtrack can be eerie, futuristic, ethereal and unnerving and serves to both enhance the impact of the visuals as well as shape the emotional experience of the player.

I found myself enjoying the atmosphere more and caring less about the former inhabitants of the world and the overall message the game conveys. 
In overall, for a small, adventurous indie title like this, Kairo is still an experience worth having for fans of this sort of game.

It isn't really anything else, especially barely a game of exploration.
What i think is really good in that regard is that it doesn't seem to lock you into a puzzle.


There is somewhat of an part exploration in the gameplay but it doesn't really reward you for it.
Yes, i know you can find some kind of runes, however that isn't really what i want to be rewarded with when it comes to exploration.

What i want from exploring a world is interesting and inspiring sites and views and in that regard Kairo is rather weak.


One reason why i feel that way is simply taste. :-P
The overall world design is far to abstrcat for my taste, 
The structures in Kairo simply feel to artificial wich leads to me thinking ""well, yes, intersting design dear gamedesigner"" instead of loosing myself in the world and inspiring thougths like ""what may have happened here"" or ""i wonder what this once was"". 
On top of that many elements of the world look really rather unfitting in their surroundings instead of giving me the feeling that they are a naturall part of this structures., The design simply lacks a conclusive and whole overall direction.

The second reason is that Kairo is really rather crude and unpolished. 
Don't get too close to the walls becasue the camera will clip trough the walls.
Strange lighting effects that most likely weren't suppossed to be there or even look like the textures have been placed wrong are visible in the VERY FIRST rooms you will explore in the game.

But the worst are the textures overall. They look really, really HORRIBBLE!
It really pulls you out of the experience if you can count the pixels of what is suppossed to be cracks and holes in walls.

The second weakness is Kairos Sonddesign or rather the lack thereoff. There are sounds and noises but they are more annoying then enriching and in many places sounds simply a re missing where there should have been some noice.
If giant structures in the world are moving i shouldn't feel like they are made of Styrophor and have no weight to them. Wich is exactly what happens in Kairo.

Kairo wants to be a minimalist thing but minimalistic doesn't mean low quality of assets and i feel that is what has been confused here when Kairo was designed.

Would i recommend it?

Nah, not really.
There are several games on Steam right now that do what 
Kairo wants to achieve in a far better and much more polished way.

There are Portal and Portal 2 (of course), Mind - Path to Talamus (wich i have only watched and not played yet) and more.

And if you specifically look for a minimalist style there are NaissanceE, Antichamber and The Stanley Parabel.",1445873941,1445874274,False,0,0,0.469234079122543335,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It can't be so easy that it feels like a pointless exercise used to fill otherwise empty space, but not so hard that it feels like it's actively fighting against you to get in your way and prevent you from moving forward. It should give you all the pieces of information you need in such a way that will allow you to naturally make the connection and reach its conclusion under your own enterprise. Ideally it will also have a specific purpose and serve a function within the game's world, if not its story. But most importantly, it has to be fun, to reward the player with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment once they do put all the pieces together in their head and turn a creative thought into glorious action. Sadly, Kairo fails on most of these counts, and by some margin.

I'm a big fan of the first-person, puzzle exploration genre, so when I saw this being mentioned in the same breathe as games like Antichamber and The Stanley Parable, and especially seeing the art style in pictures and videos, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. Unfortunately, it probably has about as much in common with those games as Gran Turismo has with Mario Kart. Initial impressions were really good. You start off at the foot of a throne on a small slab of land seemingly floating in an endless, white void, the only other feature being a large, blocky structure floating a brief distance ahead of you. Some steps invite you down into the white where you find you can freely walk among the nothingness and make your way over to the other structure. So far, so good. It's set the tone with something unique and mind-bending. Everyone loves a good mystery, so already you're compelled to venture further and find out what this strange place is and discover your role among it all... Several hours later, after having unlocked and completed everything, I still feel none-the-wiser about any of it.

Having tried to read up on it on discussion boards and such, the prevailing theory seems to be something about mass  interstellar relocation and your janitor-like role of reawakening a ship on its approach to its new home and the hope of a new chance and fresh start for a dying species - possibly ancient aliens, possibly future humanity... the jury's still out on that one. But to be completely honest, the whole thing feels like pretentious art w*nk of the highest order either way. It smacks of The Emperor's New Clothes to some degree and like there's so much vagueness to everything that anyone can project their own meaning to whatever they like and make it infinitely more profound than it would be were it merely explained to us in any degree of detail. If you have a worthy story then tell it! Let it be known and understood so people can enjoy it and share it. Don't hide it behind walls of damn near impenetrable symbolism and open-ended hints. Rather than coming across as mysterious it just ends up feeling like it lacks any real substance, and were it not for reading all the wild conspiracies, any faint trace of a story would have been completely lost on me as a result.

What I did get was a series of unengaging puzzles in an array of strange environments where nothing seemed to make sense or have any reason. Some are simple switch-based affairs, others are more demanding and require some considered observation and noting, and none of them hit that sweet Goldilocks spot of being not too easy or not too hard. In fact, despite the generous, optional hint system, as time went on I found myself increasingly resenting their very existence in the game as they only seemed to hinder any sense of enjoyment or wonder at the spectacle of my surroundings. That's probably the one thing this does get right, as the stark, minimalist use of bold colour mixed with the challenging geometry of the architecture makes for a real marvel of design. But when that's the only real strength, it ultimately makes this feel like an interactive art installation more than a bona fide game.

So that's all you're really left with. When all you can do is walk, run and jump, with no actual option to manually interact with anything or make use of an inventory or even pick up any items, you just end up roaming around stepping on pressure pads or passing through beams of light until you're told you've completed the puzzle them move on to the next one. The game makes for some pretty pictures, but beyond that there's really nothing else I can recommend about it. In fact, while Steam tells me I spent 5 hours with this, it honestly felt like more than twice that, and I'm pretty sure that even counts all the Alt Tabbing I did as I needed to get away from the game's puzzles for a while. Whenever I was playing it I was thinking about other games I'd rather be experiencing instead, and when I wasn't playing it I dreaded the prospect of booting it up, eventually completing it only to get it over with so I'd never have to touch it or think about it again.

The only reason to have any interest in this game would be to go to its Store page, to scroll down, then to click on the list of similar (and no doubt far better) games in its genre then investigate those instead. Otherwise everything feels too much like art for art's sake and lacking in every other area. In short, avoid.",1444504877,1444504877,False,77,4,0.675796329975128174,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The trailer above kinda oversells the graphics — they're not [i]minimalistic[/i], they're [i]cheap[/i].
That being said, everything else about Kairo is great.

Distant cousin of Myst, this game is comprised mostly of puzzles. And there is a compelling diversity in these: some are very easy, some are very difficult; some totally straightforward, some mind-bendingly abstract; and of course everything in between. This makes the progression always enticing and never boring. 
The level design is very cool despite the poor graphics and each level has its own unique feel, the whole game being very ""atmospheric"". This is brilliantly reinforced by the marvelous sound design, with a really, really awesome music that transported me from puzzle to puzzle in a dream-like state.

Thanks to all these strenghts, Kairo manages to be at the same time fun and relaxing. It is a journey, really, in a land full of mysteries and secrets, where lots of questions are raised and no explanations given — you make your own conclusions from the scarce clues given along the path.

I have no idea how to grade it out of ten, but I am positive that I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to pretty much anyone. The only major flaw that I would point out is the absence of V-Sync which allows some MASSIVE tearing to occur. And the Field of View is rendered in layers, which looks kinda awful. But other than that, well... What's not to like?

Cubist swamps, gravity-defying mechanisms, distant stone cities, and forests of infinite pillars await. Fog and limited draw distance are used to great effect here, shrouding impossibly huge structures from you until you move close enough for them to emerge from the murk. The environments are colorful and unique and seem to tell a story by their very nature. There's no text or dialogue in Kairo, but it has hints of the Dark Souls storytelling-without-telling motif.

Gameplay is about as simple as it gets. You walk, you run, you jump. There's no key for using, holding, or interacting here. Everything you need to fiddle with is done by proximity. This often manifests as pressure plates or stones to push, but there are more creative applications like devices that only activate when you stand in a certain orientation with them. The puzzles get hard too, so be prepared for some serious experimenting and creativity to work out how some of them function. There are some secrets to find as well, which require combing every nook and cranny of the dreamlike architecture... which is something you'll want to do anyway.

The big knock I have against Kairo is that, as well-done as the atmosphere and design is, it still looks like a Half-Life 1 mod. All the shapes lack detail and there are only a few basic textures used throughout. However, the game makes the most of its minimalist presentation, and in the end it could be seen as more of an asset than a drawback if you can immerse yourself in it.

Kairo manages to combine my two least favorite things in a game: slippery controls and almost required sprinting.

Many of the areas are expansive, which is cool, but if you want to try to complete the game the way I did [spoiler]you will need to backtrack through areas you've already visited.[/spoiler] At times like these I found myself holding down the sprint key just to get through these areas as fast as possible.

I wouldn't mention it, except you can't seem to go 5 minutes of reading about this game without it being compared to Antichamber (indeed, this comparison is what brought me to the game in the first place), and I simply can't see why. Kairo is nothing like Antichamber, and if you're expecting it to be then you're about to be sorely disappointed. This is not to say that I didn't like Kairo, as you can presumably tell from the fact that this review is a recommendation. It's just that my initial view of it was tainted because I was constantly trying to compare it to Antichamber, and in that comparison it, like most games, falls very far short.

First, the bad. The ""puzzles""  are probably the main thing here. Barring a few rather interesting ones, they can be solved with minimal effort as soon as you work out what each element of the environment actually is. The main problem, I feel is the lack of a central mechanic. With no way to interract with the environment besides standing on things, puzzle design is extremely limited. In the game's defense, it uses this limited capacity well and rarely repeates itself, but nonetheless you will likely find much of the game unchallenging. Furthermore, the much-touted atmosphere is... eh. It's not bad, but it tries too hard to be creepy, which simply doesn't work with the gameplay. There are a few very effective moments, but overall you'll probably find you just don't notice it.

However, the game just about makes up for these shortcomings with its stronger points. The environment design is excellent, using a rather minimalist block-based design for buildings which contrasts effectively with the more detailed decoration and interactable objects. Along with providing some spectacular views, this helps greatly with distinguishing puzzle piece from environment and the intuitive level design means you'll have little difficulty with finding your way around. Finally, the ending. Oh the ending. I strongly recommend playing through once to get the normal ending, then finding a guide online and playing through again for the hidden one. It won't have as much of an impact if you didn't play through once blind, but I honestly can't think of a way it could have ended better. Utterly unexpected yet actually carefully foreshadowed, it ties the game together and makes you look at the product as a whole from a completely different angle. 

Overall, I recommend Kairo, but only just. It makes up for its shortcomings in a number of ways, and it's certainly fairly unique. If you're looking for a challenge (or, like me, something Antichamber-esque), you won't find it. However, if you're looking for an unusual experience that effectively kills a few hours, you could do a lot worse. For only £4, I'd say it's worth the money.",1440516520,1440516520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its atmosphere is surreal, strange, and overwhelmingly lonesome. That's the big word I think I'd use to describe this game - lonesome, and that lonesomeness becomes more and more eerie the further you go into the game. You are the only living thing in Kairo - everything else is a hollow, dead fascimile, with archetecture eerily reminiscent of human construction and yet alien enough you might think you woke up in R'lyeh. The world of Kairo is a small world that feels massive, alien, and completely dead... and I love it to pieces and back.

Wandering through the surreal and beautifully eerie world of Kairo is very relaxing, the puzzles are very intuitive and can easily be solved with a little thought, and the simple design really makes it feel like you're stranded. And yet, solving the puzzles is so satisfying, satisfying in that ""I'm a goddamned genius!"" sort of way. The range of feelings you get from Kairo goes from triumph, curiosity, and awe to fright, paranoia, and hopelessness - and what is art if not something that makes you feel deeply? Anyone who claims video games aren't art has never played this, and that's a damn shame. Did I mention that the music and the game's design is just so surrealistically gorgeous?

Seriously, BUY THIS GAME. It's maybe $5 for a wonderful little piece of surrealistic artwork that recaptures the eerie loneliness and thirst for adventure that Myst did so many years ago in 1992. Kairo is a gem of an indie puzzle game, and anyone who is a fan of surreal artwork, puzzle games, and games where you chill and wander for a bit will love this.

Яркие цвета радуют глаз (кто сказал, что футуристичные интерьеры должны быть безлико-серыми?), архитектура с проегипетско-кубическими мотивами приятно задевает ситховские струнки в душе, а огромные подавляющие мегалиты кругом и ещё более огромные уводящие в никуда пространства внушают трепет и заставляют чувствовать себя не в своей тарелке. Сюжет в игре тоже есть, хотя он прост как три копейки и так же избит: человечество таки разнесло Землю в хлам, что нам кстати, доказывают картины, открывающиеся при решении трёх необязательных головоломок (весьма нечестных, кстати говоря), а мы путешествуем по огромному механизму, явно созданному людьми, и вновь заставляем его работать. Постепенно оживает причудливая машина, показывая своё истинное предназначение.
Итого: это действительно ""симулятор египтолога под ЛСД"", как высказались в комментариях. А ещё можно добавить ""мечта кубиста"" и ""симулятор загробного мира"". Даже если вас не поразит изощрённость головоломок (имхо, достаточно простых) или сюжетная драма (достаточно избитая, виденная в сотнях игр до того) визуальный стиль Кайро, архитектура и цветовая гамма игры точно оставят впечатления.

Pros:
- Puzzles become interesting when you have no ""hand"" or ""activate"" controls. By limiting the player to mere movement controls, old puzzles feel fresh, and there's an extra sense of accomplishment with even fairly simple puzzles.
- The environment's minimalist polygon theme manages, surprisingly, to stay varied, interesting, and even evokative throughout the game, contributing to the theme of ""strange and yet familiar"" that pervades.
- Difficulty to normal end is low, difficulty to secret end is high.
- No penalty for exploration, experimentation, or taking your time.
- Overall, definitely enjoyable.

Cons:
- The ""story"" aspect is a little too vague. You paid $5, folks, this ain't Myst or Portal. While there are enough ""clues"" that a player can vaguely put together a plot (and considerably more blatant clues as rewards for solving secret puzzles), there's plenty that's just left to imagination.
- The mechanic that resets you to a safe ledge can glitch considerably, leaving you in a fall-to-your-death loop, though this can be solved by exiting the game and reloading.
- One of the final secret puzzles is actually impossible to solve on your own. Your game will have 1/5 of the solution, and which fifth is chosen at random. So you're either going to need lots of friends, or cheat and look at a walkthrough.

Though after completing, I don't feel very compelled to research the meaning either.

My two complaints was that I was holding sprint for pretty much the entire game, and I didn't have a Rift to get the full experience, haha!

The puzzles make about as much sense as something from a point-and-click adventure game.  The puzzle is nearly always figuring out the mechanics of the puzzle, rather than what to do, which is horribly frustrating.  I never thought it possible to rage quit a first person exploration game.  Then I did the impossible, and did just that.

The enviroments themselves are nice, usually only using one or two colors per room.  The only problem I really have with the world is that it's incredibly inconsistant.  The world is obviously not made to feel like it has rules, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.  It's just some sort of strange, lawless purgatory type setting, right?  I wish.  It's actually supposed to be an alien planet.  It just doesn't work at all.

I picked up this game on a whim when it went on sale some time ago, and while it's not very long (I completed it in three hours) it's unique enough to where I consider it merits a review of its own. 

First off, let me nerd out at how good the ambiance is for a couple of paragraphs. The visuals are given sense by an excellent sound design, which kept me on edge for the duration of my playthrough; an achievement, considering the fundamentally abstract and calming nature of the setting. I didn't ever not feel like I was in an old, abandoned, alien place which might fall apart at any second, except when I finished the puzzle in the area and the whole place lighted up and started functioning again, but even then, the sense of foreboding was ever-present. Wide open areas get floaty synths that lurk just outside your hearing, punctuated by the slight pat pat pat of the character's walking, and inside areas each have a soundtrack that fits in well with what's around you. Going in blind, I half-expected the game to throw in some jumpscares at me at some point or another, but the actual gameplay was very deliberate and focused around the ""narrative"". 

The game also shines in its visuals. You might be thinking, ""Well, yeah, the game markets itself as a puzzle/exploration game, it's bound to have some nice environments"", but some areas are unique enough to actually merit a ""Holly ♥♥♥♥, this is amazing"". This makes the actual gameplay suffer at times, though, as you're made to slowly walk up and down a ramp to press at buttons to try to figure the room's huge puzzle in an epic journey that was evidently designed to show off every possible angle of the room with no regards to how long it might take to get from one place to another.

The actual puzzles themselves, the main focus of the game, is where it's a bit lacking. For all the praise I might sing of its visuals and environments, it's a bit hard to justify some of the choices regarding their design. I found myself having to constantly check at the in-game hints and a guide I kept handy to figure out the worst of them. There's a special variety that I particularly loathed, which are the kind of puzzle that required you to move against a timer over pressure pads on the floor in a particular pattern, which was made very infuriating with the character's tendency to slide around as if the floor was iced over. I'd say this is the area of the game where it's at its weakest.

I mentioned the game's narrative with quotation marks earlier on in this review, and that is because it's entirely possible to ignore it and never know anything about it, as it's never actually presented to you. It's just ""there"", and it doesn't care if you pick up on it or not. It's perfectly fine with sitting alone above the dusty door-frame of the room you just dismissed as pure eye candy and never having anything to do with you. It's not terribly complicated or unique, but it gives a sense to your running around, so I do recommend you take the time to trying to figure it out. 

Should you buy this game? If you can overlook that it's quite average as puzzle games go, and instead want to be awed by the amazing environments and architecture that it provides, sure, go for it. If not, you'll probably be wasting your money. 

I should also mention that it runs excellently in lower-end computers. So there's that.",1437406866,1437406866,True,0,0,0.451237261295318604,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Such puzzles consist of stepping on floor buttons in the correct order, shown on a wall in front of you. Levels are extremely low-poly and have single featureless texture tiled over most surfaces. Monochromatic environments, while making up for an appealing screenshot gallery, can be really nauseating.

In order to have a minimalist aesthetic appeal Kairo strives for, it would have to do all those small things right, like making footstep sounds actually match your walking speed, or not having them at all. Instead, its one of those games where you feel like you're stuck crouching constantly so you hit the crouch button to untoggle it, but the camera drops even lower.

Unless you are willing to make a degree of meaning for the game for yourself, interpret some of it as art, or spend some time unraveling the abstract references and hidden meaning, you'll probably have a boring time with an average 3D exploration puzzle game. But for those who spend some time unraveling those clues, thinking about those references, and connecting the abstract together, there are interesting layers of story and meaning.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]
As stated above, the main problems people have with Kairo, and the thing most people praise about Kairo stem from the same issue; the lack of direct or game-fed meaning, story and explanation. If you invest the time, Kairo becomes something much more, but it's always going to be subtle. For some, spending the time soaking in environment simply isn't worth the mild reward, and there are other games which do a much better job, and for others it will act as casual slow-paced art. In short, it's probably a game you'll either love or hate.

* Extremely subtle designs in everything from lighting, shapes, distances and more add to the concept or image being conveyed in each section
* Particularly good on VR platforms, mainly the Oculus Rift, though there are problems here

[h1]Mistakes[/h1]
Many people have a problem with Kairo, or don't see any value in it against other games in its genre. In the end, it comes down to whether traditional gameplay elements and story are required to make this game fun for you or whether light and often frustrating-to-figure-out puzzles are enough reason for you to explore a strange environment.

* The first sections have clearly been structured to convey tutorial elements while remaining non-obvious and ambiguous, but the problem many people have with this game is its lack of story, explanation or meaning and while that's not necessarily a mistake, it's subjective, and worth bearing in mind
* The difficulty and nature of puzzles is erratic, which is understandable, but it would've benefited the game to make, at least some puzzle elementst more fluid and understandable
* The bobby weaving motions when moving help add a subtle dreamlike feel, but may induce motion sickness or mild nausea and should've at least been given adjustable options

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]
At just £3.99/4.99€/$4.99, Kairo is fairly priced and clocks in at 3-4 hours play time. Due to the mysterious or ambiguous nature of Kairo, some may find themselves spending much, much longer on this title, exploring the secrets or potential elements of meaning, whereas others will move on after an hour or less. Either way, it's definitely worth a buy for anyone looking for something with a different approach, and shouldn't be missed when on sale.

* There are some fantastic player interpretations of the story elements and reading them in itself is fun [spoiler][url=http://www.electrondance.com/the-secret-of-kairo/]The Secret of Kairo[/url][/spoiler]
* A headset is recommended as it make the experience stronger, a VR headset is even better
* Kairo (回路) is the Japanese word for ""circuit"" [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/233230/discussions/0/617336568071589929/]which lends to elements of the story[/url]

You have no inventory, no set of tools to help you out. Instead you unlock your surroundings by how and where you move and what you do. It’s a very unnerving and immersive experience.

[b]У маленькой и мало кому известной игры Kairo получается выполнять сразу несколько ролей. Это не только интерактивный памятник рассказывающий нам историю о жизни, смерти и перерождении – это еще и очень удачная проба разработчика в дизайне уровней. Это даже игрой не назовешь, это скорее произведение искусства.  Игра, бесспорно, по времени, идеально вписывается в картину этого времени – но и 10 лет назад она бы была на своем месте.[/b]

Но все эти философские рассуждения стоит оставить на потом. Сейчас, запустив игру, мы стоим в залитой красным цветом комнате и объяснение того, как и почему Kairo достигает своих целей придет гораздо позже. Главное в данный момент – время и настроение.  Осмотревшись можно заметить некий кубический узор и механизм, о предназначении которого уже давно все забыли. 
Игра не даст вам никаких ответов. Большую часть игрового процесса вы просто занимаетесь ее изучением и пребываете в восторге от тонкости этого мира. Тут все очень красиво: от нескончаемой череды комнат, коридоров и залов, где все имеет свой цвет и характер и до комнат с непонятными механизмами. Шаг за шагом вы подходите все ближе к ответу на вопрос, который наверняка задали себе еще в начале игры: что же все это значит?

В самом начале игра может показаться немножко страшной. Ее мир покрыт мертвыми тенями, лестницы ведут в мрачные подземелья; гигантские комнаты тут не поддаются никакой логике; чертовски запутанные лабиринты абсолютно непредсказуемы и вырастают прямо перед вами. У создателя (единственного разработчика) была тысяча возможностей увести Kairo в сторону страха и запугивания игроков. Но зачем это? Ведь если бы он ""налил"" ужаса в тени, то это бы испортило идеальный баланс игрового мира. Игра лучше всего работает именно так: не страшная, но и не спокойная, не жуткая, но и не благоговейная. Она такая, какая есть. И в этом ее плюс. 
Вопрос баланса необычайно важен для этой игры, так как в ней кроме этого больше ничего то и нету. В центре рассказывающейся нам истории – Машина. Она огромная, загадочная и крайне непонятная. Через образ этой самой машины Kairo передает игроку саму себя, изливается. В шестернях ее механизма скрыт не только баланс между жизнью и смертью, красотой и уродством, ошибками и вторым шансом. Помимо этого нам рассказывают о балансе между игровым процессом и историей, между тем, что может игрок и на что у него нет права. 

Хотя Kairo и кажется чем-то непонятным, участком ""игры, но не игры"", на самом деле добрая ее половина состоит из привычных загадок и головоломок. Для того, чтобы постановить работу машины игроку потребуется  путешествовать по ее внутренностям и ""оживлять"" ее систему одну за другой. Загадки эти скорее приятные, чем сложные, ведь они не требуют от игрока жесткой логики. Они лишь просят чуточку творческого мышления. К тому же, побоявшись завести игрока в тупик автор добавил спасательные круги: в меню всегда можно найти три подсказки по решению той или иной головоломки, а комнаты доступны в абсолютно любом порядке. 
Ах да, комнаты. Каждая из них состоит исключительно из одного цвета. И думаете, что это все? Нет. Есть тут и коридоры с шипящими экранами, и острова серой архитектуры в белой бесконечности. И различного рода шестеренки, трубы, колонны и монументы, которым логического объяснения дать просто нельзя. Со всем этим надо экспериментировать. Не стоит ничего боятся: за попытку никто не накажет.

Kairo необычная игра. В ней нет ни единой строчки текста, но она переполнена метафорами и аллегориями. Для того, чтобы решить загадки вам не нужен инвентарь или еще что-то, ведь все необходимое всегда при вас – ваше творческой мышление и нестандартный подход. Игра бывает страшной, хотя тут нечего боятся. Kairo – это своего рода инструкция правильного минимализма в бесконечных потоках громких проектов. Эту игру нельзя рекомендовать всем и каждому. Из 100 поигравших в нее она придется по душе максимум двоим. Ведь это даже не игра. Это способ отдохнуть от всего. Просто зайти и улететь в этот неизвестный и загадочный мир цветов и необычайных конструкций. 
Если вы ни строчки не поняли из того, что я написал выше, то вам, скорее всего, не стоит даже заходить в Kairo. Ну а если для вас тут все было понятно как божий день, то милости прошу – игра очарует вас.

Zagadki nie są zbyt trudne (prócz tej z geometrycznym zegarem - ta jest złośliwa :P ) i grę przejdziemy spokojnie przez 5 godzin. Naszym celem jest uruchamianie kolejnych maszyn Kairo zwykle wciskając odpowiednią sekwencję przycisków, czasem przesuwając element otoczenia - wobec tego minimalizmu niesamowite jest to jak zróżnicowane są wyzwania, a przy tym dalekie są od przekombinowania - ich cudowna logika przypomina mi mój romans z serią Myst. Czasem w otoczeniu znajdują się wskazówki w formie symboli i obrazków - warto się rozejrzeć. 

Grafika jest tu bardzo ważna, ponieważ to ona zapewnia niesamowity klimat. Dziwne kanciaste twory, architektura na poły futurystyczna na poły monumentalna w stylu egipskich katakumb oraz kolorowe światło zalewające pomieszczenia i ziarnisty filtr sprawiają, że czujemy nastrój tajmnicy i alienacji.

""WHY ARE THERE STATICY SCREENS WITH THE OUTLINE OF A FACE SURROUNDING ME"" These are some of the thoughts that came to my head and probably yours if you should choose to get this game.

""Hey look it's the Earth! And the Moon! Wait theres another Moon? Does Earth have a phantom Moon?""

I've been at the edge of my seat waiting to see what puzzle next, see how complicated it looks, then proceed to facepalm when I see it was simpler than that.

""The Earth and Moons look like a hollogram... can I jump into it?"" (Jumps) ""OUCH. Wait, if it's solid then HOW IS IT LEVETATING?""

If I were to make a movie trailer for this it would probably be something like this: "" Kairo, a strange dreamlike world filled with temples, dungeons, palaces and strange alien like machinery. A man wakes up, alone and scared with no memery of what happened to get him there. When he looks on and braves this strange new land he uncoveres many things, puzzles to solve, and sights to behold. He set's forth to solve the mystery, of Kairo. In theaters now for $13.37""

The bottom line is this: Kairo is a very great surreal minimalistic puzzle solving that I solely recomend you should get. 
My favorite part was the buetifull, touching, serious ending.

This game is simplicity in action, and as I delved deeply into the carved blocks of granite/obsidian/stone/randomness to discern some hidden meaning behind it all, I found myself continually following my own line of thought, like a dog trailing after the scent of a long lost bone he buried somewhere deep in the earth.

I honestly attempted to like this game, but sometimes a little concrete meaning is required after a jumble of meaningless gravel. What I mean is that Kairo is far too ambiguous; I can wander aimlessly through this game and decide what it means for myself until, quite literally, the very end, at which point Kairo finally decides to give me something solid - not okay, guys, not okay.

Kairo is a game that lets you wander through a child's block fort, occasionally posing *cough cough* ""puzzles"" that briefly halt your progress through the maze of nothingness. I felt as though the developers had a clear idea as to what they wanted to say, sat down in a conference room and said ""Hey guys, woudn't it be really cool if we..."" and then glued together a jumbled mess of a game.... Sorry, 'experience'. I received conflicting feelings of paranoia and comfort throughout the game, feeling at one time as though I were being watched and at another time as though I were revolting against an omnitient, though not omnipotent, regime, slowly tearing it down brick by ambiguous brick. I think each *cough cough* ""puzzle"" in this 'experience' was arbitrarily assigned some deeper 'meaning' after the story-board team smoked an acre of some illegal substance. That doesn't fly with me. I am certainly not saying I don't LOVE pushing my smug nose up and saying ""Oh yesh, I am a very smart man and love interpreting games and books and movies because I am so deep and insightful"" because I do love to say that. I am a smarmy head-up-my-ahem turd; Kairo is a jumbled mess of obfuscated meaning with an alternate ending (oh joy) to encourage further 'experiencing'. That's cheap, guys.

IN BRIEF (he said ironically): Kairo is a block fort, glued together by a toddler hyped up on three gallons of coffee. Then a guy walked by and glued a tagline onto it that belongs at the bottom of an inspirational cat poster. If you have something to say, then say it. If you believe in what you're saying, then you want people to agree with you: make sure they know what you believe.

The puzzles lack depth, complexity, and do not require deep thinking in order to discover the solution. They feel like an afterthought and I think the developer intentionally designed them so to make the experience in Kairo more fluid. 

As you may have read, Kairo is a minimalist exploration game (though it's more of an abstract art gallery simulator). Meaning you can only walk, run, and jump. Your interaction with machines is restricted thus partially explaining the lack of depth in some of the puzzles. No in game button prompts. Nothing out of the Kairo's context distracts you, save the notification that informs you've solved a puzzle. It's all for the purpose of pulling you deep into Kairo's world full of abstract architecture and objects with strange behavior that apparently defies physics. The fine grain filter and errie soundtrack assist in attempting to build an absorbing atmosphere.

Except I felt a disconnect for some reason. None of the abstract architectures (nor the atmosphere) evoked any feelings. No texts located anywhere to provide some backstory. Perhaps (and I'm not sure) some story could be deciphered (or interpreted) but the game gave me no reason or motivation to invest the effort into it. Even during the conclusion when Kairo's purpose was hinted at, no tingle of emotion. 

In my opinion, you can approach this game like you approach a strange dream right after waking up, either invest the energy to interpret it and derive personal meaning or instantly forget about all the vague disjointed images. If you're the former or if the idea of an abstract art gallery simulator sounds appealing, then maybe Kairo might be for you. 

However, if you are looking for something with cohesion and a game that gradually unfolds a story with clarity (or a challenging puzzler as talked about in first paragraph) then I would defintely pass this one up.",1427435564,1427487422,False,1,0,0.512356579303741455,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First off, let me nerd out at how good the ambiance is for a couple of paragraphs. The visuals are given sense by an excellent sound design, which kept me on edge for the duration of my playthrough; an achievement, considering the fundamentally abstract and calming nature of the setting. I didn't ever not feel like I was in an old, abandoned, alien place which might fall apart at any second, except when I finished the puzzle in the area and the whole place lighted up and started functioning again, but even then, the sense of foreboding was ever-present. Wide open areas get floaty synths that lurk just outside your hearing, punctuated by the slight [i] pat pat pat [/i] of the character's walking, and inside areas each have a soundtrack that fits in well with what's around you. Going in blind, I half-expected the game to throw in some jumpscares at me at some point or another, but the actual gameplay was very deliberate and focused around the ""narrative"". 

The game also shines in its visuals. You might be thinking, ""Well, yeah, the game markets itself as a puzzle/exploration game, it's bound to have some nice environments"", but some areas are unique enough to actually merit a ""Holly shit, this is amazing"". This makes the actual gameplay suffer at times, though, as you're made to slowly walk up and down a ramp to press at buttons to try to figure the room's huge puzzle in an epic journey that was evidently designed to show off every possible angle of the room with no regards to how long it might take to get from one place to another.

The actual puzzles themselves, the main focus of the game, is where it's a bit lacking. For all the praise I might sing of its visuals and environments, it's a bit hard to justify some of the choices regarding their design. I found myself having to constantly check at the in-game hints and a guide I kept handy to figure out the worst of them. There's a special variety that I particularly loathed, which are the kind of puzzle that required you to move against a timer over pressure pads on the floor in a particular pattern, which was made very infuriating with the character's tendency to slide around as if the floor was iced over. I'd say this is the area of the game where it's at its weakest.

I mentioned the game's narrative with quotation marks earlier on in this review, and that is because it's entirely possible to ignore it and never know anything about it, as it's never actually presented to you. It's just ""there"", and it doesn't care if you pick up on it or not. It's perfectly fine with sitting alone above the dusty door-frame of the room you just dismissed as pure eye candy and never having anything to do with you. It's not terribly complicated or unique, but it gives a sense to your running around, so I do recommend you take the time to trying to figure it out. 

Should you buy this game? If you can overlook that it's quite average as puzzle games go, and instead want to be awed by the amazing environments and architecture that it provides, sure, go for it. If not, you'll probably be wasting your money. 

I should also mention that it runs excellently in lower-end computers. So there's that.",1427349498,1427349614,True,20,0,0.662818610668182373,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's still worth a try if you can get it to work.[/i]

Kairo is not exactly the most complex game, but it gives you enough mental stimulation. Since it's only $6 right now, either go ahead and get it or wait for a sale. If you're on the fence about this one, I encourage you to read on fully.

[h1]FIRST OFF[/h1]
Kairo is made in Unity, and if you've experienced a game in Unity you know that slowdowns are extremely common. Prepare to wade through the settings several times deciding what slows you down and what doesn't, maximizing appearance with playability, especially when most defaults are selected with high-speed computers in mind.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
The puzzles in Kairo are particularly easy by minimalistic adventure standards, but the developers have definitely squared down exactly what kind of puzzles they need. Rather than blatantly giving you instructions or commentary to push you in the right direction, they require you to work out exactly what's going on to figure out the solution, very similar to Myst. Puzzles are isolated to their own special room, but sadly this means most of the time you'll be walking through a room that's more for sightseeing than for puzzlesolving. For the casual gamer, Kairo features a hint system that can assist in solving puzzles. There's no penalty, and it doesn't resolve if they're used or not. All in all, [b]Kairo is a solid puzzle game[/b].

[h1]VISUALS[/h1]
The minimalistic visuals of Kairo are absolutely breathtaking. The wonderfully crafted levels are absolutely gorgeous to look at, and unlike many games, the additions of things like film grain only serve to add to the visuals, rather than give a false impression of visuals. Of particular note are areas of the game where the film grain is programmatically [i]increased[/i] to add effect as you look around and wander. There is (as it first seems) only one texture that Kairo has: a concrete/stone texture kind of thing. This sort of forces you to look at the architecture as the art. And boy, is the architecture ever art. [b]Stunning and functional, the deliberate monochrome of Kairo's architecture make it one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played[/b].

[h1]STORY[/h1]
...Well, here's where the negatives come up. Kairo's story is one that you have to infer, but the structure of the gameplay kind of causes whatever the story would possibly be to get... jumbled. I'm not sure how to describe this without giving much away, but Andrew Plotkin has a wonderful quote that hits this nail right on the head.

[i]""If I were to level a charge, it would be that the game world never really coheres, beyond the visual level. An adventure can set up its narrative drive through discovered texts and journals (old gag though that is). Or it can build a narrative out of its artistic details, the discovered connections and implications hidden in the visual world. Or this structure can come from the gameplay itself -- the connections you discover between the puzzles and mechanisms that make up the game. By solving, you learn what it's for.

Kairo disavows each of these strategies: it chooses minimalist artwork, (nearly) textless presentation, and modular puzzles. They're separate design decisions, but together they more or less rule out the sense of a coherent narrative world. It's not a flaw in the game, but a missed opportunity, I guess.""[/i]
[url=http://gameshelf.jmac.org/2012/10/kairo-quick-comments/]~Andrew Plotkin[/url]

[h1]THE SECRET[/h1]
There are a set number of secrets to the game, but Jesus Christ do NOT even try going for that shit. Just look up a walkthrough. Kairo's secret ending (yes, it does exist) is a joke. I have to give that away. It's not really funny, and the solution to get to it is completely obscure to get to. It was painful to read how people figured out how to get to the secret rooms, they reminded me of classic Sierra game solutions, it was that bad. Not to mention the secret ending in the dev room (after I even managed to get to it) made me question the validity of all the other secret rooms regarding any sort of story Kairo has. My verdict? Kairo has no story, and that's the worst thing I could possibly say for this genre of games. I'm all for a game with no story (DOOM is one of my favorite games, for God's sake!) but that's a philosophy that needs to be considered on a game-per-game basis, and Kairo's the kind of game that can't handle that shit.

[h1]OVERALL[/h1]
Kairo's a game that promises too much at the start of the game and delivers too little at BOTH of it's endings. However, if you're more here to solve some puzzles and get beautiful visuals, then by all means, $6 isn't all that much. Go ahead and grab it if you're into art games, or if it's on sale. You'll get more out of this than Dear Esther in terms of fun. (imo)

I have always had a fetish for architecture and minimalism, so I was eating my heart out with these striking sceneries and giant, monolithic buildings. (I can only imagine what it would look like on the Oculus; probably overwhelming. In a good way.) 

But what added a poignant thrill to this game was the constant drive to keep going deeper in this ""civilization."" If you get bored easily or have a curiosity that fades quickly, then this game is probably not for you. Especially since some of these puzzles take a lot of patience and/or trial-and-error.

I played through the whole game with only needing some help on two puzzles (both of which I still don't quite understand because blind luck got me through), so they're not ridiculously hard if you pay attention to all the details as you move forward.

На этот вопрос, мне кажется, нельзя ответить просто. Это не игра, это явление. Kairo была  придумана одним очень талантливым человеком и реализована его командой разработчиков.

[h1]Kairo:[/h1] это нагнетающая своей атмосферой бродилка, которая на первый взгляд покажется ""бессмысленной"". Зайдя в игру, вы ничего вначале не поймёте: - Что это за непонятные построения? Почему я хожу по воздуху? Текстуры не прогрузились? Почему я бегаю по одной и той же локации кругами, всё циклично повторяется! *закрываю игру*

Это были мои первые вопросы, после которых, я закрыл игру и отложил её в долгий ящик. Спустя некоторое время я всё же дал игре второй шанс и зашёл в неё.. Я начал всё тщательно исследовать, вникать в скрытый смысл игры, хоть как-то логически строить цепочку игровых действий. И, могу я вам сказать, я просто проникся этой игрой полностью. Kairo оказалась ошеломительной игрой, с очень интересными головоломками, с нагнетающей атмосферой неизвестности и незабываемой игровой архитектурой! Вы перемещаетесь с одной локации на другую, выполняя квесты, ища подсказки и ключ к разгадке.. но что мы ищем? Зачем мы здесь? Кто это всё возвёл?
В кульминационной части нам открываются все двери, тоесть под конец игры нет неясностей, если конечно немного поднапрячь извилины.

В игре скрыт глубокий смысл. Вы должны сами понять это.

+ Оригинальная идея.
+ Превосходная реализация идеи.
+ Тяжёлые головоломки.
+ Графический стиль.

[*]Unique and thought provoking styling and ambiance
[*]Unique puzzles (some hard, others stupid easy)
[*]Minimalist
[*]Grand and wide open environments
[*]Nostalgic 90s feel (at least to me)[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b][list]
[*]The intense color palette, sharp and grating sound effects, and an overall feeling of confusion makes the game interesting at first and then unpleasant 
[*]Many of the puzzles are either confusing, super easy, or boring
[*]Terrible game engine (slow, buggy, see though walls and objects)
[*]Because the game is so grand and wide open you zoom around at 100mph across vast areas which is annoying at times
[*]Very unpolished
[*]Fairly short

[h1]Detailed review:[/h1]  I played this game almost back-to-back with [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/252550/]Qbeh-1[/url], a first-person puzzle game in the same vein. It was a funny coincidence because, in juxtaposition, these games couldn’t be further opposites. Qbeh-1 fosters a zen relaxed feeling with blue skies, cool water, open spaces, majestic buildings, relaxing ambient music, and a feeling of smooth progression using hands-on puzzles with standard building blocks. Kairo on the other hand is a strange game with a surreal, Stonehenge, modern abstract, [url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3955] David Smith [i]Cubi[/i] [/url] feeling with graphics reminiscent of the 90s era (reminded me of an old dos game called S.C.A.R.A.B.). It has an environment that is discomforting and disconcerting, trapping the player in dark psychedelic tombs and inorganic voids. The game uses harsh grating sound effects and music and surrounds the player with static filled screens, sharp abstract constructions, and bizarre features. There are no controls beyond the basic movement controls; every “action” is performed by stepping on tiles or otherwise bumping into the various features found within the giant rooms. Perfecting the feeling of being lost in an abstract void is a complete lack of storyline or instruction beyond a list of puzzle hints that can be found in the menu. In short, the game makes you feel like you’re traveling through the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s not bad, but I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone as it would offend all but those who can appreciate a game that is little more than a virtual modern art gallery with simple puzzles separating each exhibit.",1425015629,1425242903,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To nie jest gra dla osób o słabych nerwach. W Kairo nie powinno się grać w ciemnym, pustym pokoju.
Prosta grafika.

To gra dla ciekawskich i wytrwałych. W całej tej pustce w pewnym momencie zaczyna się za wszelką cenę szukać celu - czegoś do zrobienia, zasad, którymi kieruje się ten świat. Tu trzeba wypróbować granice tego, co wolno, żeby dowiedzieć się, co należy. Ciekawość przyćmiewa narastające emocje, aż w nagłym przebłysku zrozumie się, że coś się osiągnęło.

""Slowly uncover the true purpose of Kairo"", verspricht der Text auf der Shopseite. Die Wahrheit ist, dass ich nach dem Spielen von Kairo genauso schlau bin, wie vorher.

Ihr erscheint in einer abstrakten Welt und es liegt an euch, diese zu erkunden und die dabei auftauchenden Rätsel zu lösen.
Der Verlauf des Spiels lässt sich grob in drei Areale unterteilen, in denen es jeweils eine Reihe von Rätseln zu lösen gibt, welche jeweils einen Teil einer ""Maschinerie"" wieder in Betrieb bringen.
Was sich hier recht überschaubar anhört, wird gegen Mitte / Ende des Spiels schnell frustrierend, da man sich durch die eintönige Gestaltung der Umgebung und zum Teil unnötig großen Räume / Gänge schwer orientieren kann. Zwar gibt es eine Minikarte, aber diese ist nur bedingt hilfreich, da die Abbildingen der Räume zum Teil stark von ihrer eigentlichen Form abweichen. Außerdem lässt sich lediglich ablesen [i]ob[/i] man sich in einem bestimmten Raum befindet, nicht [i]wo[/i] man im aktuellen Raum steht.
Auch hat man sich sehr schnell an der Würfelwelt mit den immer gleichen Texturen sattgesehen. Das Erkunden außerhalb der ""notwendigen"" Bereiche wird, wenn man von den Achievement-relevanten versteckten Runen absieht, weder objektiv noch subjektiv belohnt.

Die eigentlichen Rätsel sind größtenteils relativ schwach. Fast nie gab mir das Lösen eines Rätsels ein Gefühl des Erfolgs. Das hat je nach Rätsel unterschiedliche Gründe.
Manche sind so einfach, dass man kaum seinen Verstand bemühen muss (Schema ""Finde die Stelle im Raum, an der die komplette Lösung abgebildet ist und wende diese entsprechend an"").
Andere können dagegen so abstrus konstruiert sein, dass man durch stumpfes Herumprobieren am besten zum Ziel kommt.
Dass das Lösen eines bestimmten Rätsels wortwörtlich vom Zufall abhängt grenzt in diesem Zusammenhang schon fast an Hohn. In einem Spiel, das sich selbst nicht allzu Ernst nimmt, wäre dies vielleicht eine lustige Abwechslung, aber Kairo nimmt sich, soweit ich das beurteilen kann, todernst.
Spontan würden mir zwei, drei Räume einfallen, die ich positiv in Erinnerung habe, aber das Gesamtbild bleibt bestenfalls durchwachsen.

Die Musik hat zwar keine bleibenden Eindrücke bei mir hinterlassen, aber sie ist stimmig und hilft dabei, dass ab und zu durchaus so etwas wie Atmosphäre aufkommt.
Der Rest der Soundabteilung hinkt dagegen etwas hinterher. Viele der Soundeffekte empfand ich als nervig und die schlecht geloopten Effekte wirken unprofessionell.

Angeblich soll während des Spielens eine Handlung kommuniziert werden. Diese ist aber entweder nicht vorhanden, oder erschloss sich mir nicht.
Es gab eine Entdeckung, die ich als plotrelevant einschätzen würde, aber ohne einen Kontext oder Bezugspunkte davor oder danach ließ mich das ganze eher kalt.
In der Welt verstreut finden sich Bezüge zu unserer Welt (Fotos, historische Illustrationen), jedoch wirken diese willkürlich und, in Verbindung mit der Spielwelt, zusammenhangslos.
Der Abspann deutet an, dass der Entwickler mit diesem Spiel einen höchstwahrscheinlich unangenehmen oder schweren Lebensabschnitt bzw. ein Erlebnis verarbeitet hat. Wäre dies etwas nachvollziehbarer eingebunden, hätte Kairo vielleicht zumindest auf einer emotionalen Ebene eindrucksstärker sein können.

Итак, что же нам подарила игра kairo?

В целом получилось всё в соответствии с большинством положительных отзывов.
- Игра, в самом, деле увлекательная.
- В самом деле, много головоломок.
- В самом деле, красивая архитектура, даже невзирая на примитивность.
- В самом деле, приятное звуковое сопровождение.
Вывод: с учётом стоимости по акции в 26р., игра,конечно же, стоит потраченных денег.

Из минусов:
- Вынужден констатировать, что большинство ""головоломок"" достаточно просты (не согласен с предыдущими ораторами в ""мозгодробительности"", сложности и многообразии этих головоломок. Почти все они проходятся либо интуитивно, либо «методом тыка», либо немного нудно, лишь одна-две на всю игру оказались в самом деле интересными).
- На мой взгляд, к серьёзному минусу игры можно отнести некоторую ""мёртвость"", ни о каком сравнении с Mist идти речь не может. Всё дело в очень завуалированном (практически отсутствующим) сюжете. На самом деле сюжет есть, но додумать его всецело придётся самостоятельно. Игра в плане сюжета эдакие кубики для младенца, который сам строит из них ""нечто"". Ввиду этого игра постепенно утомляет. Без сюжетности игра превращается в обычную красивенькую бродилку-пазл.
- Никакого ощущения таинственности или мистичности или минимальных элементов хоррора (как кто-то тут писал) в игре нет. Слегка гнетут тёмные интерьеры и пейзажи, но не из-за своей мрачности, а скорее из-за примитивности исполнения.
- Согласен, что со временем начинают уставать глаза из-за частой смены ярких интерьеров.

Из важного:
- Кто-то поставил kairo в один ряд с Antichamber. Совершенно напрасно. Antichamber игра более высокого уровня, и, в сравнении с ней, kairo просто меркнет.
- В kairo определенно стоит поиграть любителям жанра «ходи-броди-тыкай-угадывай», но ДО того, как играть в Antichamber. Если вы уже играли в Antichamber, рекомендую обойти kairo стороной, дабы потом не получить небольшую разочарованность.",1423864012,1423864012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Verdikt: Prídete do novinového stánku a kúpite si knihu s tajničkami alebo sudoku. Prvé úrovne sú smiešne jednoduché, no postupne sa doba riešenia ďalších naťahuje až nakoniec dôjdete k najťažším. Vyriešenie jednej z nich zaberie toľko času, za ktorý ste vyriešili všetky ostatné. Presne o tom je hra Kairo. Obsahuje veľké množstvo hlavolamov, ktoré sú na začiatku jednoduché, no postupne sa ich náročnosť zvyšuje. Technické spracovanie hry na slabej úrovni, ale dokáže zaujať svojim utilitaristickým dizajnom a ambient hudbou. V hre nenájdete žiaden príbeh, jedná sa o surové riešenie hlavolamov. Najväčším negatívom hry je jej herná doba, pretože na jej dokončenie je potrebné vyriešiť iba zopár hlavných hlavolamov. Kairo celkovo pôsobí ako zaujímavý projekt, ale pre svoje nedostatky môže odradiť od kúpi a hrania viacero hráčov.

I've read a lot of the negative reviews and I was really wondering whether I had this mistaken view of how good Kairo is. Kairo is a lot like Myst with a minimalism twist. Some may gasp or think I'm nuts for comparing Kairo to the masterpiece that is Myst. However, Kairo, at its core, is [i]very much[/i] like Myst. There is more story direction in Myst, and the puzzles are more direct, but this is where Kairo becomes a little more abstract and like a modern art piece.

In Myst, the story is [i]told[/i] to you (with a little twist), while in Kairo you are uncovering a story long forgotten. I know to some this may be dissatisfying, because it feels like you're not taking part in a current story. For me though, I don't mind one bit. I enjoy unraveling stories like a long weaved thread. When you reach the end too, there is a lot left to decide for yourself. It's not so different from Myst, but this subtle difference is critical to Kairo's feel. As opposed to Myst where you know exactly what happens at the end, Kairo leaves you to wonder.

As far as the gameplay goes, Kairo sometimes presents puzzles which are a little hard to grasp. They're not difficult by any means, but sometimes it's hard to understand the kind of thinking Kairo wants you to do. However, overall the puzzles aren't a problem and are satisfying to complete. The game also gives you the ability to explore freely. Despite this, Kairo gives you just the [i]little bit[/i] of direction you need to know where to go next. However, the movement feels absurdly sluggish. I don't know why the character's movement is so heavy and slow. It's not a major concern, though.

It is important to note, that the aspect of exploration allows Kairo to sometimes feel more like a walking simulator than a puzzle game. This will turn away many onlookers. In my mind though, this isn't an entirely bad thing. I enjoy that aspect. Classic, hardcore puzzle game fans will likely get bored and quit. Those of you who are more into exploration games and walking simulators will be in awe at the haunting atmosphere that Kairo creates, and you will be rewarded with an ending that allows you to ponder and sum up all you've experienced. The soundscapes and the minimalist art give the game a unique feel I haven't experienced in a game prior to this one.

In short, Kairo is an exploration puzzle game with walking simulator elements. Hardcore puzzle game fans will likely dislike the artistic nature of Kairo, whereas exploration game fans will find it a refreshing touch. It's no Antichamber, The Witness, or Cypher, but it's not bad either. No matter what you look for in a game though, what Kairo tries to do I personally believe it does well, so it gets a recommendation from me.

And I'm glad I scooped it up! A great puzzle/exploration game with enigmas abound.

GAMEPLAY: Consists of walking, jumping, and looking around. It's straightforward exploration with minor platforming. Puzzles round out the play, which you complete by stepping on platforms and bumping into objects to trigger them.

PUZZLES: They're pretty intuitive for the most part, but there were a few I had to consult the helpfully provided ""hints"" option for (one in particular was hair rippingly frustrating because I'm terrible at math). Be prepared to comb areas carefully for clues, and draw out some diagrams here and there. It's quite satisfying to solve these puzzles, as they're fairly challenging, and it's made clear when you have activated a piece of machinery or opened a pathway by way of flashing lights, thunderous tumults, or loud gong strikes. It all amounts to a feeling of progress and getting one step closer to solving the mystery.

VISUALS: Very minimalistic. Oftentimes, you wander through barren corridors or empty voids, with sparsely a decoration to look at. What there is to look at, though, serves to deepen the mystery. It feels like everything being presented - from images of Earth to the DNA double helix - has some type of underlying meaning. Otherwise, lighting and colouring is used to differentiate rooms, creating a very surreal effect. There's also some use of moving objects - floating, spinning globes, for example - that add some variance. In all, it's simplistic, but only where it needs to be.

AUDIO: The highlight of the game for me. Again, simplicity is the standard here - a haunting, ambient soundtrack makes the place feel mysterious, dangerous, and cozy all at once. It's a strange effect, but it keeps the player guessing as to what, exactly, these structures are. As mentioned before, loud, sudden bells and gongs are used to indicate that the player has completed a puzzle, which is pretty satisfying. Radio static in certain locations and chimes during object interaction round out the auditory experience. Like the graphics, it feels like the sounds of the game highlight what's important.

STORY: Ostensibly, there isn't much of one. There is virtually no dialogue or cutscenes, and there are no NPCs present. Only environmental clues, mainly through recurring motifs, give rise to some semblance of a plot. I enjoyed wondering what Kairo could be about, and reading theories about it afterward.

Overall, a great experience, which is even nicer considering I got this game for $1. It reminded me a lot of Myst (and Penumbra, somehow). There are mysteries to be unravelled for those willing to search for them.",1422512717,1442298527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(Caution: minor spoilers ahead)

First of all I expected a little more story. Sadly there is absolutely none. Before playing it I also thought that there's maybe a connection to the city Cairo in Egypt, but there is no connection at all (as far as I experienced it). The only ""clues"" you get in the game are some blurry pictures and unrecognizable audio tunes which serves no purpose. A deeper meaning? I doubt it. And for an art-project this seems all too random and poorly conceived. When I finished the game I was as smart as before. Mostly I didn't even know, what I was doing and for what purpose. Who build these puzzles and why? And why do I have to solve them? But that's my second point of criticism: the riddles.

The riddles are sometimes too simple, and sometimes you don't have a clue what you should be doing and the game doesn't give you any hints regarding the puzzle. Some of these riddles I solved by pure luck, bashing buttons and trying it over and over again. Even after I finished some of these, I couldn't tell you how I solved it. But most of the riddles based just on pushing the right button at the right time. Not much fun and also not very clever for a puzzle game...
And there are also rooms without any importance to the main riddle, but you can't recognize, which rooms are important and which are just ""corridors"" to other rooms. There is no clear path in this game. Some may call this ""concept"" or ""open world"", but I think the developers just had not enough time (or talent) to generate a clear guideline for the player. And that is my third point of criticism: the level design.

All you do in this game is walk. And walk. And walk. After playing it a few hours, I constatly use the ""sprint""-key, just to get where I want to, faster. Because every room is enormous and vast. At first this is actually cool, but after a few riddles it is just annoying. Yeah, I understand - big landscapes: cool! But the levels don't include too many details and it's getting boring. concrete wall on concrete wall. So here's my final point of criticism: the look of the game.

Sure, this is not a AAA-game by some major game developer, but the game looks like it's from 1995. The rooms and places look too clean and dull, there's no life or fun in these corridors and halls. So the walking gets very frustrating, because you walk through dull rooms all the time, solving very easy (or ""what-the-hell-do-I-have-to-do"") puzzles without even knowing what purpose for... And the end screen (which appears very soon) gives you no solution what you just accomplished.
One good thing in Kairo is the soundtrack. It is deep and athmospheric and it prevents the game to get even more boring.

So all in all I was disappointed. The game was indeed too short (6 hours), but because I got sick of running around in circles I was happy when the end screen appeared. 
The game would surely be better, if there actually was a story or maybe even a connection to the city of Cairo. I could even imagine a game about the political / social struggle in Egypt and the history and the culture of Cairo. Unfortunate, Kairo had potental, but the poor game design and the absence of story just killed the whole game.",1422377281,1422377522,False,5,0,0.574468076229095459,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Es básicamente un juego de puzzles con pocas posibilidades. Construido sobre espacios abstractos y geométricos, en él todo consiste en ir solventando las distintas pruebas para ir pasando a las siguientes salas. El problema es que estos puzzles son por lo general muy poco gratificantes, siendo bastante irracionales y carentes de todo sentido lógico: empiezas probando unas pocas combinaciones para intentar averiguar la dinámica del juego, pero al final todo consiste en descubrirlo de chiripa. Jeroglíficos, runas y símbolos están inscritos en las paredes del juego, cuyo significado nunca se nos va a explicar, sumado a una especie de ""cuadros"" enmarcados en las paredes de los que tampoco tenemos ni idea de por qué están ahí.

Para resolver los enigmas contamos con movernos con WASD y saltar... y ya está. Entiendo que el juego pretende ser minimal, pero siendo tan abstractos los acertijos que propone es muy fácil perder el interés ante la falta de opciones.

Y es una pena, porque en estos ambientes abstractos y geométricos el juego logra algo poético, especialmente gracias a la banda sonora que es envolvente y misteriosa. Además, bastantes de los puzzles implican tonalidades y ciertos sonidos pero de manera muy tibia, lo cuál deja mucha sensación de potencial desaprovechado.

Así, en general Kairo es bonito a pesar de su simpleza, pero dándose el caso que jugablemente no da mucho de sí, se hacen todavía más notorios los numerosos problemas de tearing y popping. Si tuviera una buena jugabilidad o supusiera un reto satisfactorio probablemente lo pasaría por alto, pero no siendo así lo cierto es que los problemas gráficos no ayudan nada.

Puede que me haya dejado bastantes cosas, el juego me ha durado más bien poco (he tenido que mirar una guía en un par de ocasiones porque desesperaba, y realmente esos puzzles no los hubiera adivinado jamás de tan rara que era la mecánica para resolverlos). Veo que hay varios logros que no he obtenido, pero viendo lo poco gratificante que me ha resultado, dudo que resolver las pruebas restantes me supongan una alegría.

En resumen: Kairo, una pena porque la sombra de ""podría haber sido un buen juego"" planea en todo momento sobre él.",1421621604,1421621604,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Such horrific phantasms that cannot be adequately described by human beings have ravished my every sleeping moment. I can't fully describe the horror, but I will do my best.

My dreams all start with me standing on a throne pedestal, overseeing nothing but a building off to the left and a tall tower to the right. As i enter the building, it plays the beginning of the game through my head, sometimes doing puzzles out of order, finding odd things wrong with them, like looking behind a pillar for the symbols and finding Trollfaces there instead. But all my dreams end the same way. Everything starts turning all grainy and fuzzy, and suddenly I can't move, and a giant red rhombus starts licking the right side of my nose and I can't get away.

Damn that red rhombus.

Then I'm being chased  through something like a chinese restaurant except everything is blue and on the ceiling, and nothing's chasing me, but a waterfall of chicken noodle soup keeps raining down from the sky, except its not chicken noodle soop. I don't know. And then, God starts slapping me back and forth across the face, yelling some bizarre phrase over and over that seems to make a lot of sense but i can never remember what he said.

Then I fall back into the game, and the red rhombus (damn that red rhombus), starts chasing me while punching a pair of my old tennis shoes, or some other object from my house. Sometimes i wake up at that point, but other times I end up in what could only be described as cowboy hell where I'm tormented by something like Johnny Cash and yodelling cacti for a while, and then right before the earth-sized cake from Portal is about to crush me, I wake up.

The full horror of these dreams cannot be expressed fully through these feeble attempts.

Atmospherically interesting and surreal puzzle game with some glaring flaws.

[h1]A Bit More[/h1]
Let me first say I got this game for the fair price of 0.74$ and I think paying full price may also be a fair deal, depending on where your video game preferences lie.
Kairo sets the mood pretty early with it's ominous soundtrack and stark visuals. I found the grain effect and mouse smoothing (default settings) annoying so I had to turn them off straight away. I had extremely choppy/laggy mouse and keyboard movement which might be due to my weak computer but this game should not as demanding on the cpu as it is. Despite all that Kairo's atmosphere is enjoyable and the much needed hint system helps in teaching you what the level design won't. Towards the later segments of the game the puzzles lose some of their quality and the map design will leave most players wondering around without much enjoyment.  

[h1]Bottom Line[/h1]
If you enjoy difficult puzzles and open ended mysteries Kairo will give you your money's worth

So you are dropped into this game and you will have no clue what it is about or what to do. Most of the puzzles are pretty annoying and the game feel really bland. Even if you have manage to complete a puzzle, you will not feel that you will get rewarded for it. You will feel that you are just playing a boring walking simulator game with no impacts and progression at all.

Graphics are not catchy and boring.
Sound is minimalistic.
Clunky control movement.
Character is ""sliding"" and not walking.
There are hints available.
Feels really bland/empty.

The controls are a little ""floaty"" - they don't feel as tight as most other first person games, but due to a lack of combat that's not necessarily a problem, just takes some getting used to. The graphics are simple, but very effective - the spectacle is quite impressive. 

In addition to the normal gameplay goals, there are a series of 18 runes to find hidden about the game, one ""go back and find later"" puzzle where, after you exit an area, something secret opens up which you can find, and three exceptionally hard ""did you notice that one little thing elsewhere? Interpret it in this abstract way here!"" puzzles which you might need to look for external guides for.

It's not clever, it's not intuitive, it's just very, very marginally ""artsy"", so everyone will be drawn into what is otherwise a shallow and uninteresting experience.

[b][i]The Rant Begins[/i][/b]

I've had my eye on this game for a very long time, and I'd been intentionally avoiding the reviews to the best of my ability, because I felt as though this was the sort of game you wouldn't want to spoil by having any prior knowledge of any aspect of it.  The reviews looked positive, and that was the important part, in my eyes.  Naturally, once it finally went on sale I wasn't the least bit hesitant to snatch it up and install it as quickly as could be, because games like this (I thought.) always fascinate me and never fail to entertain.

I [i]love[/i] the ""off-kilter"" genre, and I don't at all mind when a game wants to sit down and just walk me through a story.  Visceral Clean-up Detail, Dear Esther, Tiny & Big, Gone Home, these are games I've played more than once, or a dozen times over, just because I [i]love[/i] it when a studio or an individual sits down and tries to defy a genre, because if no one ever did, we'd end up with a terribly stagnant market practically bereft of originality.

I've also never been one to shy away from a solidly-constructed puzzle game.  Portal needs no introduction, Braid--although overhyped--made you plan ahead so far that it occasionally became a little brain-bending. The Bridge, Antichamber, Myst, Kill the Bad Guy, FEZ, all of these came at the puzzle genre with something unique, and often very atmospheric.  They made you rack your brain to see a puzzle in a light it had never quite been presented in before, and you would walk away feeling accomplished when you'd finally figured out that one, little trick to cinching it all together.

Kairo does none of these things.  It attempts to paint a unique world full of mystery that begs to be explored, but in those rare instances where it rewards exploration, you get such a small, nonsensical snippet of the 'lore' that you're just left with more questions, or a flimsy little ""piece"" of the puzzle in the form of a slight JPG-artifacted ""rune"".  Often times Kairo will have entire rooms, entire cement-slathered, sprawling 'scapes to explore that serve [i]absolutely no purpose at all[/i].

Kairo also does not approach the puzzle genre in any [i]meaningful[/i] way.  I know this is a matter of contention, because there are those that think the puzzles are just blatantly impossible, and then those that insist Kairo is brilliant because it [i]does[/i] offer some semblances of clues in the form of pattern recognition, or subtle sound cues, but both of these trains of thought are ultimately flawed, because Kairo, to me, suffers from a cardinal sin when you examine its puzzles more closely:  Kairo's puzzles are [b][i]boring[/i][/b].

Once you've managed to work out exactly what it is that the game is expecting of you, you don't have one of those, ""Oh God, really?!"" moments that you'd have in Portal, you don't see all the little nuanced motions that you'll need to pull off to navigate through the level in The Bridge; in Kairo, once you've seen the puzzle for what it is, it is always something [b][i]excruciatingly simple[/i][/b].  Many of these puzzles--[i]far[/i] too many of them--simply involve a trial-and-error style rote memorization of a keypad-like button press sequence.  One of them involves shuffling yourself into the right place until all the blocks line up with the other blocks.  I hope you enjoy this one, because you'll be doing it a [i]lot[/i].  

One of the ""core"" puzzles for the secret ending involves scouring this desolate, barren expanse of cement into every nook and cranny, until you find all 15 of the JPG artifacts, and the worst one of all?  Backtracking.  The last of the core puzzles involves a nearly-nonsensical amount of backtracking to accomplish.  Yes, you are given a very mild hint concerning what to do and where to go, but the fact of the matter is the game is shoving you ten to fifteen minutes out of your way, through uninteresting environments you've already seen, to do virtually nothing except headbutt a statue.

Clearly this is a game that's garnered an impressive following, and I've no doubt that there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this sort of game for what it is, but I came into this expecting a refreshingly-interesting story at best, a unique puzzle in the very least, and at the worst: An interesting world I could explore.  I found myself being offered none of these things. 

In short:  In Kairo, I do not feel alone.  I feel [i][b]bored[/i][/b].",1420016572,1420045308,False,1,0,0.462616175413131714,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a simple yet aw- filled atmospheric journey that takes place in this supernatural-like world you've stumbled upon. 

Pros: 
+ Increadible atmosphere.  Sometimes even daunting to look at with the great depth of field use by the dev.   
+ Music is more like a drone in various keys and melodies.  It's unique and quite pleasing to listen to.
+ There is no linearity to it, well there is but you're free to tackle various areas at your leisure.
+ Puzzles are both easy and incredibly challenging.  
+ Sandbox style freedom to explore the world.  It's not very large but the amount of rooms can make you forget where to go or where you've been.

Cons:
- There is very little if any backstory but some may say none is needed with just how odd and abstract the setting is.
- Some puzzles are a little too tough because they go completely unexplained or not elluded to.

In einer archaisch-monumentalen Welt gilt es, aus der First-Person-Perspektive verschiedenste Rätsel zu lösen. Man entdeckt Raum für Raum, sucht nach Hinweisen und versucht, Rätselstrukturen zu verstehen. Die mysteriöse Spielwelt entfaltet dabei durch oft synchrone Farbgebung und die meist reduzierte aber gekonnte Soundkulisse ihre eigene faszinierende Atmosphäre. 

Die Rätsel erweisen sich als mal einfach, mal knifflig, Hinweise werden stets subkutan gegeben, teils durch visuelle, teils durch akustische Elemente. Dabei ist aber stets nicht die Lösung des Rätsels das eigentlich spannende, sondern das Entdecken des Lösungsweges.

""Kairo"" entfaltet seine eigene Welt, seine eigene Ästhetik, seinen eigenen Reiz. Ein Indie-Game wie es sein sollte, da es nicht durch Effekte oder eine aufwändige Engine glänzt, sondern durch Charme und Intelligenz.

Загадочность на загадочности загадочностью погоняет.(4) Игра очень странная и порой пугает своей гнетущей атмосферой. То около около радиовышек слышны голоса, говорящие на русском, то начерченные на монументах послания, то на экранах за тобой наблюдает силуэт человека, то на тех же экранах показывают фотографии катастроф и последствия каких-то бедствий, то просто дают загадки без решения... просто так. Множества разных картин с изображениями формул, древних надписей, знаменитых картин и людей и др. Суть и мораль всей игры к концу становится довольна ясна, но для любителей произносить во время игры фразу: ""Что это б...ть за х...ня?"" - эта игра в самый раз. (5)

Головоломки довольно хитрые, запутанные и одновременно просты.(1) На некоторые придётся потратить много времени на разгадку, а на некоторые ещё и на выполнения этой разгадки. Если ещё учесть, что некоторые головоломки сделаны просто для красоты.(2)

Кстати, архитектура в игре великолепна. Огромные башни, монументы, вышки, замки и всё в минималистическом виде.(3) Визуальный ряд удерживает мрачность и загадочность игры.

Gli ambienti troppo vasti, si cammina tanto senza avere sempre un'idea di dove andare, nè di dove si trovino le stanze con gli enigmi.
Gli enigmi poi sono la parte più deludente: un gioco a puzzle dovrebbe dare soddisfazione, anche farti scervellare magari, ma farti sentire intelligente quando trovi una soluzione. Peccato che qui gli enigmi siano o troppo semplici o troppo... vaghi.
Mi sono ritrovato a risolvere una stanza senza nemmeno capire perchè, o lasciare una stanza convinto di aver trovato la soluzione  e doverci ritornare perchè non era così.

E' un gioco confuso in cui l'astrazione, che doveva essere il punto di forza, risulta essere una debolezza.

My ACTUAL review is:


Kairo is an interesting game to say the least, I feel like there was an actual vision behind the developer and for the most part I think his vision came through, however the limited resources he had are fatally apparent. The film grain effect is just a static overlay that feels more distracting than stylistic, and while early areas of the game are very visually engaging and seem like they have a plan and purpose behind their layout, later areas just feel slapped together, using almost random geometric shapes and often just feel like the design had little to no thought at all. A fair amount of rooms have a purposefully grand scale, which is usually unnessicary considering you have to run back and forth in them to solve a puzzle. Of course this might be a purposeful choice to evoke a specific emotion from that level, I just felt pulled out of the experience. 

Now obviously I can't review a game without discussing how it plays and the mechanics, which also sadly fall flat. The game only gives you three commands, the ability to look, jump, and sprint. Nothing else. This is sometimes problematic to solving puzzles as you need to physically touch certain objects in order to ""activate"" them. While feeling awkward by itself, the player has a sort of floaty momentum to them that is accentuated by the fact you need to ram into objects to solve puzzles, which are also obtuse. There are different symbols used to differentiate switches, but the logic behind them often changes. Sometimes they're supposed to be literal, as in you have to activate the exact sime switch, but sometimes they're representations of numbers, which is confusing when the rest of the game had been using a literal interpretation. Luckily there is a hint system built in, which solves most of my gripes with the presentation not being very clear.

All in all, I feel like this game needs a lot of polish, but is still worth the price, especially if it's on sale.",1419238366,1457211356,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I wasn't expecting nearly so much out of a little game I picked up on a whim.  

According to walkthroughs, Kairo can be finished in just a half an hour if you know what you're doing, but I spent hours going through it.  The puzzles are indeed difficult at times, but what slowed me down the most was just stopping to gawk at the architecture.  It's just simple geometry and the textures are concrete, concrete and more concrete, yet somehow it's really amazing to look at.  The intense colored lighting and sheer emptiness of the massive, enigmatic spaces you get to wander through really hit with impact.  What really makes the environment pull you in though is the music.  Kairo has by far some of the best ambient background music I've ever heard.  Definitely play with good headphones if you've get 'em.  I'm officially starting my Steam category of games to go back and play again when the Oculus Rift comes out.  

It's really difficult to describe the unique feeling and atmosphere of Kairo's world, but here's the best I can do:  Does anyone remember the bizarre, abstract and often borderline incoherent art-house style computer animation that occasionally showed up on TV in the late 80s and early 90s?  It's like that, but with more thinking.

Gameplay consists mostly of puzzles and exploration, and both are quite rewarding.  A lot of the puzzle give that sort of Myst vibe at first glance (ie. ""here are some random shapes and levers, have fun and see you in a couple hours"")  but I found all of them to be fair and some were even a bit intuitive.  There were several that seemed totally abstract like they should have been frustrating to figure out, and I'm not sure if I just got lucky but the answers always clicked in my head after a bit of twiddling.  With so many puzzle types being redone to death in adventure games, it's good to see some totally new concepts that work.  My only real gripe with the puzzles are the fake ones.  Or at least apparently fake ones; I'm really not sure.  There were several rooms I faffed about in for ages before pulling up the in-game hint system to find out the room was just ""here to play around with, mostly.""  Mostly?  That's just lovely.  There were two places I recall getting this ""hint"", and they were the only two places I had to resort to using the hint system.  And then the hint is basically ""this room is just here to waste your time. OR IS IT?""  Oh just piss off and tell me, is it or is it not a room with no purpose?  Again, just a minor gripe since I moved on when I got the aforementioned hint.

There were a few other minor nitpicks I had after finishing the game, but nothing major.  There were some pretty glaring geometry glitches like hairline cracks, overlapping brushwork, misaligned textures, missing faces, and gaps that looked like they weren't supposed to be there.  Higher resolution textures could have really improved the look of a few areas too in my opinion.  Finally, while I loved the music throughout the game itself, the ending theme just didn't fit.  It's not bad or anything, but it was jarringly different from everything heard up to that point which I think detracted a bit from the final sequence.  Just my opinion.  Again, all minor things not worth too much thought.

All in all, Kairo is a unique concept with some changelling puzzles and a fun bit of easter egg hunting, but it was also an unforgettable and immersive experience I won't soon forget.  It might be a bit obtuse at times for some, but if you're up for some creative problem solving in a fascinating setting, you can't do much better than this.

I put a little under an hour and a half into this game before I made the decision to uninstall it.

Here is my reasoning.

I bought the game because some reviewers touted its similarity to Antichamber, a game that is very near and dear to my heart. The trailer for the game made it appear tantalizing and intriguing and, most of all, fun. 

Unfortunately, it didn't take me twenty minutes to regret this small purchase.

Kairo has, I've found, missed the mark on one of the most fundamental gaming concepts; not just in video games, but in the entire realm of playing a game for fun. I call this ""carrot-and-stick"". Other people call this other things. But essentially, in nearly every game you can think of, there's the metaphorical carrot, your objective, and the metaphorical stick, what keeps you from your objective. I could cite endless games, card games, board games, arcade games, games of make-believe played in the backyard of my friends' houses when we were five, and, yes, video games that keep/kept me latched onto the idea, entertained, and engaged in the gameplay.

One thing I quickly learned in Kairo is that there's not much of a carrot.

I'm going to take this discussion back to Antichamber, for those who have played it. I'd hypothesize that the two are compared often for the similar concept of working through puzzles in complete solitude. But in the Hub of Antichamber, you can see a door marked Exit, though you cannot reach it. In one of the first spawn points, you can see a door behind a barrier marked ""The End"". There's even the Black Ghost, dancing just out of your reach on certain puzzles. These are all suitable carrots. 

Kairo is designed in such a way that I have yet to see the carrot; there's not much more than an endless stick. And after almost an hour and a half of playing for no apparent reason, I tired of the game.

On one last note, for all the endless puzzles in Kairo, there are worlds you walk through that have no puzzles at all. The game has a hint feature, but if you are not so inclined to use it, it's incredibly difficult to discern a puzzle world from a world that's apparently there for your exhaustive visual pleasure.",1418658768,1418658768,False,0,0,0.448548823595046997,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Kairo is a very good example of a game that is about puzzles, and about logical thinking.   This game does not beat around the bush in trying to add other things alongside the puzzles.   It is very much focused on puzzles that force a person to really think, or to be patient and wait til an answer appears.    The game can be frustrating because often times, you will come across a puzzle in which doing things in the wrong order, will lead to various issues, or puzzles where an answer is not possible to find until a later time.    I knw that it was annoying trying to figure out a few of the puzzles, and eventually used a hint guide to figure it out.



Graphics:   Very basic graphics, low res textures and stuff.   But like I said before, this game focuses on the puzzle aspect, not the pretty visuals.   Also, there are a nice color theme that can be seen so that is enjoyable.


Audio:   Very minimal muisc because it focuses on the puzzle, not the other things.

Game Mechnics:    The controls are very simple.  You move, you jump, you run.   Nothing more, nothing less.   You solve puzzles by moving in certain areas, moving objects to certain areas, and standing in certain places.


Story:   None that I could see, but thats possibly due to it focusing on the puzzles, rather than the story.



Overall, this is a very enjoyable  game that can be frustrating at times, due to the challenging aspect of it, but since there is a 100% guide on Steam, you will always have a way to make it through IF, key word is if, you need it.   If you are not that good with puzzles or logical thinking, then I would not recommend this because it will easily frustate you.",1418303030,1418303030,True,2,0,0.546767592430114746,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Both prominently feature first-person exploration of vast, compelling brutalist architecture, monochromatic visuals (frequently, but not always greyscale), a profound sense of isolation, a deliberately ambiguous plot and practically-undefined protagonist, as well as an overarching dreamlike quality to the entire experience.
Where NaissanceE is primarily exploration and platforming with some occasional light puzzle-solving, Kairo is primarily exploration and puzzle-solving with some occasional light platforming.
Most of Kairo's puzzles are thoughtful and reveal their answers with observation and consideration.  There were certainly a few that were much less complicated than I made them out to be, some that felt like simple trial and error, but a couple were obscure enough that I eventually resorted to searching out the answer.  (Ugh, the wheels of shapes!)  Fortunately, you're usually given a few puzzles at a time to work on in whatever order you choose.  There are also some extra-credit puzzles that unlock the super-secret ending that lays bare the true meaning of the bizarre mechanisms you set in motion throughout the game.
While NaissanceE has a handful of video-game and pop-culture references, Kairo isn't afraid to give a nod and a wink to other games.
Steam says I've got about 5 hours into Kairo, and I feel like I was able to explore the gameworld pretty thorougly in that time.

I recommend it in all its lukewarm glory.

It's a puzzle-game with platforming elements - unlike its contemporaries Kairo gives you a full range of movement that helps avoid the monotony of more ""walking simulator""-esque games, though it rarely expects you to actually platform. There's something to be said for bunnyhopping your way through the environment, and there's even some collectables that take advantage of the movement system. 

Kairo ran well enough, though I did have some minor troubles getting stuck on the geometry and consistently had clipping issues with the camera edges while running it at a 1920x1080 resolution, which I don't particularly hold against the game. 

It bills itself as an exploration game, but the progression is still largely straightforward - you travel from hub to hub solving puzzles in siderooms accessible via portals. Your exploration is largely limited to the next area the game wants you to go. I didn't think this was a negative aspect in the slightest, as I've personally no interest in wandering around some landscape with no idea where to go, but unless you figure exploration to mean ""looking at the game as you progress through it"" then it does stand out.

The puzzles are simple and easy to figure out, rarely requiring more than a few minutes of experimentation to figure out each ones internal logic structure (outside of one frustratingly weird gear puzzle that I'm still not sure how I managed to solve). You're never outright told what to do, but given your simple moveset and means of interaction - mostly pushing blocks or activating buttons - it's not hard to figure out, though there's a hint system anyway. If you've ever played a puzzle game before, you'll just be going through the motions.

Throughout the game, there's a consistent rate of highly unique rooms to traverse as you solve the puzzles presented. These rooms are sadly marred by their low budget - the massive structures are simplistic, and empty, mostly relying on the novelty of the colour schemes and their sheer vastness to hold your attention. Given the short amount of time you spend in each area, it works, though if/when you backtrack to pick up collectables you've missed and solve optional puzzles you'll the novelty wears off. 

Story is there, but it's completely ambiguous, mostly symbolic and only really lends itself to the game through some notable imagery. It's not really worth ""figuring out"", I didn't bother with it and I doubt it's meant to be a part of the ""experience"", but the flavour it lends to the puzzles is appreciated nonetheless.

The advantages of Kairo lie in how casual a game it is. It's a game to wind down with, cool off and a have a cup of joe while adjusting to the game's own wavelength. It was obviously a labour of love, but there's not much more to the game than that. There's nothing wrong with that.

In fact, I wouldn't even say it was a game for most people.  It's the type of game that takes a lot of patience to enjoy.  You've got to really put yourself into the game, imagine that you're really in this place, seeing these things.  The atmosphere and mystery are everything, and if that isn't your bag then you won't find enough to enjoy here when it comes to pure gameplay.

There are indeed puzzles to be solved, but most of them are quite simple.  There are no controls beyond moving around and jumping, and there's no text or story to speak of beyond what you're observing of your environment.  As is to be expected with these types of games, a lot of it is open for interpretation, including the ending.  The graphics are solid, but quite simple and low-budget; most of the architecture is made up of blocks and flat planes.

If any of those things are deal-breakers, then don't even bother.  But if you're into the pure sense of discovery that games can offer then I can't possibly recommend it enough.  The term gets tossed around a lot, but it truly is more of an experience than a game.  You've got to like abstraction, simplicity, and rich atmosphere (thanks in large part to the excellent sound design).  You've got to be the type of person who gets a thrill from the simple act of booting up a game and not knowing exactly what to expect--of heading through a door and not having the foggiest idea of what you'll see.

How on earth this game achieved anywhere near a positive status on Steam I have no idea, but I suspect foul play. Allow me to explain why you need to avoid Kairo like the plague.

Plain textures can sometimes be compensated for by some impressively detailed architecture or environments which hold intrigue. Kairo simply does not have any of that. The environments look like they were made by someone experimenting with mapping and decided to package everything together to make it seem like a game. The designer has some strange idea that throwing tons of fog into every section of the game is a substitute for creating atmospheric lighting or using the environment itself to influence the players' state of mind. As such every part of the game I saw felt lifeless, unfinished and bland. I have honestly seen maps from the original Quake with more atmosphere, style and imagination.

The 'puzzles' are so dull that I literally gave up after playing the game for half an hour. They consist of running into invisible triggers or standing on trigger brushes to cause something to happen. One of the things the designer forgot to actually do is clearly indicate when a puzzle is solved and what the point of solving it was. In one area I found 4 platforms which turned on a bunch of particle effects on a rotating central disc. Visually quite interesting and clearly the puzzle was solved because all of the triggers stopped working, but it did not appear to have any effect upon the game. The lack of direction here is astounding as the designer chooses to leave you completely in the dark as to what you should be doing and gives no context or sense of progress to what you manage to figure out on your own. Someone needs to sit this person down with games like Myst, the Longest Journey, Master Reboot or even The Room so they can understand the difference between an enjoyable mystery and aimless activity.

Kairo is unpleasant to look at, boring to explore, devoid of any sense of achievement or purpose and ultimately one of the worst games I have had the misfortune to mistake for a worthwhile investment of money or time.",1417284817,1417284817,False,1,0,0.483146041631698608,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is simple yet challenging, and the built-in hint system is helpful enough to point you in the right direction when you're stuck without outright spoiling the puzzle.  However, I think the abstract design makes the story hard to follow (and leaves the player to guess); after finishing the game, I wasn't really sure what it was all about.  Still, that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  If you enjoy puzzle games and want something a little different, I would definitely recommend Kairo.

Pros:
- Otherworldly/alien environment.
- Engaging, abstract, and unique puzzles.
- Good music, which helps set a somewhat ominous and somber tone.

Cons:
- The story was a little *too* abstract.
- Keyboard controls are not remappable, or even listed in full.  For example, the ""R"" key resets you to the room entrance, but I found that completely by accident.
- There is no way to see your progress on collecting the hidden glyphs, except by collecting more of the glyphs.  I would like to have seen my current progress when the game is paused (such as how the map is displayed).",1417152909,1417152909,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I haven't quite finished it yet, but I'm confident in recommending it. To be clear, if you're looking for a fast-paced game with all the latest bells and whistles, this is not the one for you. The graphics and music are quite simple, and gameplay is as slow-paced as you'd like it to be. However, I disagree with those who call this a ""walking simulator."" It is very much a game. There are puzzles to solve as well as a story to uncover.

The puzzles are very well-designed. There is no dialogue and no text, yet somehow it's always clear what you're expected to do. Some of the puzzles are quite simple, while others are much more complex, but I haven't found a single one I couldn't solve with a little patience and logical thought. It's not too easy, but it's not too difficult, either. There was only one puzzle I needed hints for - and those hints are provided in the game menu. There are three hints for each puzzle, starting out vague and growing more specific, so you can get exactly the amount of help you need if you ever get stuck.

I was satisfied with the beautiful abandoned abstract architecture and puzzles. The first time I uncovered an unexpected plot twist, my heart skipped a beat, and every one I've found after that has led to even more amazed moments. I'm very picky about storytelling, and this is one game that does it perfectly without ever resorting to dialogue or verbal exposition.

Kairo is a game in which you appear to be embarking into the depths of an ancient egypt-like machine that either uses magic or technology too far beyond you to understand. Either way, Kairo is one of those games that doesn't explain anything to you (though you have the option of hints, which don't help much) so it requires a lot of problem solving and logistics on your part. 
Most of the puzzles are self-explanitory, and the ones that aren't normally are supplied with a stone or wall you have to look at. Once you find those, you then proceed to facepalm realizing how simple the complex-looking puzzle really is.  Even so, the puzzles really are challanging, to the point where I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of them because it didn't seem to be based on any rhyme or reason (and that I couldn't find any stones or walls to explain it) I'm sure you'll identify the one I'm talking about if you play this game.
The story is widely open to interpretation though. There were points in the story that sent a legit chill down my spine. Other moments had me scratching my head wondering what just happened. In order to understand it, you're required to fill in a lot of blanks.

I find Kairo haunting and beautiful. Every time I reach the final goal, and the credits roll, and the music plays I think of creator Richard Perrin and his father — and the loss of my own — but it’s hopeful and optimistic. Still the entire experience exhibits a sense of loss and recapitulates same. For me the game is an expression that I enjoy somewhat plaintively in its context. 

I play it often enough at my three-year-old's insistent request. He has none of this context! But he still wants to come back again and again. He finds it mesmerizing as he instructs me where to go and what to inspect next — the first time, his eyes wide in amazement. I think at his age he's captivated by the geometry and the color (children's entertainment is generally far from this). “Go see where the blocks are painted!”, “Go to the black moon!”, “Go in the elevator!”, “Show me the dinosaur!”, “Fly into the sky!” He’s still surprised when the environment springs to life. I’m surprised to see we’ve wandered around Kairo for over 150 hours in the last year or so. 

In short, a moving experience for a parent, and a curious adventure for a child. Play it together. Appreciate the time you have together.

So really, this is a thank you note. Thank you, Richard Perrin and the rest that made Kairo possible.",1412707225,1412707225,True,308,6,0.925602734088897705,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It takes me right back to ""Driller"" or its sequel ""Far Side"" which, used ""Freescape"", an early 3D, to evoke alien and unusual environments.   Unlike those two early games, Kairo gives no backstory, and lets you attempt to figure it out for yourself. I love it...

The whole game is extremely minimalist in its level design, but extremely evocative of space and alienness.  The aesthetics are a mix of old and new:  blocky, simplistic but with texture mapping, reflections, fog, flames and more.  The overly simplistic design may deter some who would dismiss the game as dated, but anything more complex would start to get in the way of the narrative.

It may not have been the designer's ""point"", but the simplicity of the environment allows you to completely ignore it, and focus more on playing the game.  And playing may not be the best definition either:  experience, discover, enjoy are also great definitions for this.

The beginning makes it look like you'll be exploring ancient egyptian ruins (albeit in a dreamy world of whiteness), before  abruptly turning grey and industrial-feeling.  The game continues to take turns and each area feels and plays a lot different.

The only time that the simplicity works against the game is when an area is more complex than it looks. After traversing a dozen empty corridors, and passing stray cubes, you may not realise that another grey unmarked stray cube is, in fact, a trigger for some action, and be left puzzling for a while.  Such ""difficulty through obscurity"" is a hard one to balance right, to be honest, so I'll let it off, mostly.

I think the thing I enjoy most about Kairo is that it really plays with our preconceptions of what a 3d puzzle game is.  They jokingly call one of their achievements ""Locked Door Puzzle"" as a nod to other more mainstream games.

I really enjoyed playing Kairo, and then with the help of a cheat to find all the secrets.. A great minimal game.  If you do decide to play it, don't try and speed-run it.  although it looks shallow and simplistic, there are a lot of hidden (or just obscure) tidbits for the explorer.

Kairo is something that demands your full attention. It is a game that you play in the dark, all alone. You won't be killing zombies or assassinating kings in Kairo, but you will be exploring a strange, impossible world filled with perplexing architecture.

The ambiance is unsettling, and even threatening at times. The music (written by Wounds) is alienating and absolutely beautiful. The graphics are simple, but this simplicity fits in perfectly in making you feel that you are truly in a foreign world; a place you do not understand. For those of us with low end computers, you'll find this to be a pleasantly smooth running game.

At its core Kairo is a puzzle game. Some puzzles are easy and won't strain you too badly, but others are so hard it's almost unrealistic to think any player could solve them on their own (looking at you, Clock Room). Each puzzle is intuitive though, and they always make sense after you solve them (even you, Clock Room).
Luckily if you get hopelessly stuck, each puzzle has three hints and the solution to help you along. 

The story is what really ties the elements of Kairo together. From the start you'll have many questions: Where am I? Why am I here? WHO am I? Will these questions be answered? Well, that depends on you. There is little to no dialogue in Kairo. The story is expressed entirely through the environment and the things that you see. If you want to understand this place you're in, then you must actively think about the actions you take, and how they're affecting the world around you. There are answers to your questions, but Kairo leaves it entirely up to you to find them. If you take the time to uncover the mystery, you'll be glad that you did.

Kairo is a game that not everyone will love. But for those who do, it is a masterpiece. It is the kind of game that sticks with you long after you finish it. I wholeheartedly recommend Kairo.",1411960291,1411960291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each area proffers a unique bit of architecture, either a room or  monument suspended in the void; In tandem with the monochromatic color scheme and sound design, the effect is rather evocative, but of nothing more particular than the tingly excitement of meandering through an abandoned alien kinetic sculpture garden.

Kairo exhausted my patience due to the tedium of its puzzling elements, but it could be worth exploring if you dont mind and find the screenshots compelling (if you do mind, I suggest Kairo's obverse, Antichamber- its world isn't exactly poetic, but does have a practical charm in service of the brain-bending environmental puzzling Kairo lacks.)",1411728128,1501300449,False,5,0,0.564179480075836182,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Many of the best puzzles were fairly simple tasks, but understanding how the mechanisms worked was a challending and engaging task, simply because of the lack of context.

One of the most interesting and unique things about this game is the cool control scheme in which the position where you are standing affects the state of the world.  This is used in a variety of ways, and it somehow manages to make very simple puzzles a lot more engaging.

On the down side, this game was definitely lacking in polish.  Movement was slightly glitchy - especially going up stairs and jumping off walls (which I'm not sure you were supposed to be able to do at all).  There were often cheap looking cracks between blocks that didn't quite touch.  Some icons looked like poorly clipped .pngs.  Just a little rough around the edges.

[h1][b]Full Review at [url=http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=121]GameDragons.Net[/url][/b][/h1]

[b]Presentation[/b]
Kairo is a game of exploration and mystery, putting a whole world of differently coloured rooms ahead of you, each with its own intrigues and puzzles; the design of those rooms is simplistic, each following a precise theme and colour, without adding too much detail on the ambient, but that's part of what makes Kairo's mystery so great, leaving you with questions about a certain object that you encountered and what useful information that object might have for you. 

While some of those questions will be answered by the end of the game, most of them won't, leaving you more confused than you were when you first started the game, and as great as that is from the mysterious perspective of the game, it somehow feels disappointing at the same time, as you probably were expecting at least some of the bigger mysteries to be answered in a way or another, but on the bright side that leaves a lot of room for interpretation, allowing each one of us to have our own verdict on what Kairo wanted to tell us. 

The greatest part about this game however, is the way it manages to shape its universe around you, constantly surprising you with what lies ahead in the next room and leaving you in doubt on how you should react to what you see before your eyes, but at the same time giving you complete freedom to move around and see what you can discover to help you solve that room's puzzle and move forward just to have the same thing happen to you all over again. In the end, judging by the amount of hours you've spent in Kairo it won't add up to more than a few hours, but really digging into the experience and enjoying the mysteries it has to tell, it will seem a lot longer while you're inside and exploring at will, even though for most times, the more you explore, the more unanswered questions you'll have at the end.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Every once in a while, you run into those type of games that offer a unique and thrilling experience without focusing too much on the gameplay, but rather on the experience you have by simply being a part of that game and uncovering its mysteries; Kairo is exactly that type of game, delivering a simplistic mechanic of navigating through its universe and clever ways to solve its puzzles by using nothing else besides the basic movements and the environment around you.

 This game is all about exploration and uncovering the numerous mysteries that lie ahead, using the things you've seen before and the things you see in that very moment to help you solve different puzzles that stand in the way of your progression, something that works wonderful in Kairo, following a logical way of seeing things and even though the solution might not be that obvious at first, exploring the environment around you will eventually give you the information you need. 

Most areas follow the same pattern, requiring you to enter all the side rooms, observe what you can do in there and get things moving again until each and every one of the required steps has been completed and the core of that area is up and running, allowing you to move forward on to the next one. By putting some of the information you need to unlock various secrets in the rooms ahead of you, Kairo requires you to return to previously visited areas without feeling repetitive or boring, as there will always be something new to uncover that you might have missed on your first visit, and with the information from the rooms ahead of you in mind, you will for most of the times, know what you're looking for already. Even with the usage of the movements keys only, some of the mechanics such as pushing objects around feel like they haven't reached their full potential, as such simple things could've expanded the way in which puzzles are treated in various ways, making the game longer and adding that extra gameplay portion that's missing.

[b]Graphics[/b]
It's hard not to appreciate the unique art style of Kairo and the wonderful and sometimes spooky environments it delivers, but even in all the simplicity of shapes and precise objects you can clearly see the outdated engine on which the game was built. There are an almost infinite number of ways in which this game could have been improved by using the latest game engines, especially in the lighting area, where the latest engines would've made a huge difference on how that room is viewed and the exact experience the game wanted to deliver.

[b]Audio[/b]
There's always a great tune playing in the background to add to the feel of a certain room, sometimes adding to the feeling of joy and liberty, while other times cornering you in a small room with little light and a spooky theme to add to the mystery effect. The sound effects as low quality as they are do their job well enough, but there was room for a little more variety and a few more touches here and there to make you hear the world moving around you when it does visually happen on the screen.

[b]Extras[/b]
It takes around four hours to complete Kairo, add an extra hour or two if you're looking to get the most out of it and collect all the glyphs, monoliths and solve all the secret puzzles, but also note that this is a game priced at 3.99€, so for that amount of money, it does more than enough to please. With the amount of mystery and out of place objects you can find in this game there was room for a lot more, as some of the areas are not used to their fullest and areas that seem to have some sort of puzzle attached to them at first, are just there to give the impression of having more to see.

[b]Verdict[/b]
Kairo isn't much of a game, but it's one great experience, especially if you're into the abstract puzzle genre, as its unique design and way of saying things make it a must play for any enthusiast of the genre. As in most cases, there was room for more in some areas and modern graphics would've made a huge difference in the way the game unveils to you, but considering the fact that this is an indie game, it did a great job delivering a worthy experience from a low budget production.

As with most places in this desolate world I find myself in, the room is almost entirely monochromatic. Green, but not a green like living plants, but a green like something sickly and dying. Rotten. Slimy. It is a long corridor, and unlike the other places I have visited, it is somewhat claustrophobic. Large caskets line the sides of the corridor, and as I walk slowly along, looking for something I am expected to do, I stop and investigate one.

There is a monitor on each casket. Some are broken, some flicker with static, but this one shows an image, though of what, I cannot see. I stand there for awhile, longer maybe than I should, waiting for something to appear on that monitor, but if the image changes, it is perhaps only my imagination. Or my reflection.

Kairo is a strange, ominous world. There are great monoliths to explore, machines that reach up to the heavens, and cramped corridors to wander through. Some rooms have puzzles, some are just desolate walkways, hanging out over an abyss.

I feel I am in purgatory. The very first action this game asks you to take is a leap of faith. This is what the game expects of you- perhaps not to understand, but to experience.

Visually, this game is a treat of abstract, bold art. Simple, yes, but the limited pallette serves to build the abandoned atmosphere of the game, and Kairo is more than capable of providing small details mixed in amongst the enormous structures. The appearance of the game almost looks somewhat grainy, like an old photograph. 

The sound is just the howl of empty wind in enormous rooms. Rocks grind and scrape over surfaces as you move puzzles into place. There is some music, but it did not stand out to me in comparison to the rooms that whistle with loneliness. 

Kairo is, for the most part, a puzzle game. You manipulate these great structures, these old, broken runes, to find your way through. Some of the puzzles are simple, some of them seem to make little sense, requiring simple trial and error. Kairo does provide 'hints' for each level, but they are otiose at best, perhaps deliberately. Still, there is a sense of accomplishment at defeating these particular puzzles, and a continual drive to see what might be next keeps you going.

Do I understand what is going on? I feel I do. But at the same time, I feel that there are many right answers.

The pacing feels awkward/slow (even with Shift/Sprint held down), the scattered collectables are unnecessary, and puzzle satisfaction is quickly tarnished as you trudge forward (or even worse - backtrack) down long corridors to the next puzzle.  Kario could still be complex and grand without the stairs, paths, and extra large rooms. The only thing which drove me to continue was my stubbornness to complete the game.

Man wird einfach in eine bizarre Welt hineingeworfen, in der man sich erst zurecht finden muss. Aber das kann sich als schwierig erweisen, da keinerlei Erklärungen zu den Rätseln gegeben werden.
Die Umgebungen wirken sehr plastisch und lieblos gestaltet, insgesamt eine sehr verrückte und bizarre Welt, in der man eigentlich gar nicht genau weiß, worum es geht.

The puzzles themselves have plenty of variety, despite not having an inventory. There are ""arranging object"" puzzles, ""standing in the right place"" puzzles and ""working out the right order"" puzzles just to get you started.

If Myst had been made in this generation, I think Kairo is a pretty good representation of what it would play like (though Kairo chose a much more abstract blocky appearance in many areas).

One of the really cool things about this game is that there is really no dependence on language. There are no conversations and no written or spoken instructions or clues in-game. Aside from the menu and the credits, you don't even need to be literate. The only ""reading"" deals with symbol-matching and it's in the context of numbers, not words.

I jumped right into Kairo without researching it at all, and honestly that's what I'd recommend everybody do. Seriously, if it sounds at all like something you might like, stop reading and jump in without any more context.



I will, however, continue typing for those who prefer to keep reading.

The game is all first-person exploration. Just move and jump. There is no combat, there is no inventory, there is no picking-up-and-carrying-and-putting-down of items. All your interaction is in where you walk, what you stand on, and what you bump into or push.

There are three major areas, referred to as the Lighthouse, the Tower, and the Garden. Each area contains hubs with several adjoining puzzle rooms. Complete puzzle rooms around a hub to unlock additional puzzle rooms and advance to the next area.

There's no substantial danger. If you fall, the game is pretty generous about spawning you quickly and very near, so you don't really risk losing progress.

While I do recommend this game overall, I do have a couple of warnings:
-There are little rune symbols scattered around the world. Most of them are in areas that are easy to get to but that you just wouldn't see unless you were specifically seeking them out. They're not required in order to finish the game, but you might find yourself backtracking if you decide to look for them all. There is one false rune in a hub room. I don't know if this was a mistake but you just can't get that one, and it's not accounted for in the ""list"" of found runes.

-There is a faint grainy overlay filter on pretty much everything, and combined with the occasional (and sometimes kinda loud) radio static noise, I started to get a headache after a while. If you play with headphones on, keep your volume comfortably low.

-There are three rooms that don't have an obvious purpose. Checking the hints for these rooms won't help, as the hints suggest that the rooms are there just for fun. All three of them are basically different kinds of geometric combination locks, so it's possible to brute-force the solutions, but there are so many possibilities that it's really not a reasonable method. One requires an audio clue from elsewhere in the game, one requires an extremely well-hidden visual clue from elsewhere in the game, and one actually requires collaboration with other people who have played (or are playing). There is sort of a code, and each player only gets one of the four parts of the code, so you would ideally need to exchange clues with at least 3 other people who got a different part of the solution. This is actually a cool concept, but since the whole game presents this atmosphere of isolation, the notion of communicating with other people out-of-game to trade codes is really counterintuitive. Then again, maybe it's a puzzle to try to find 3+ other people who would rather exchange guesses than just web search for the solution (which, admittedly, is how I reached the solution).",1409425123,1409425123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It partially succeeds, but is definitely not up to the standard of games from other series.  
The environments are fairy well done, and the static-y atmospheric effects make them feel appropriately ominous.  The trouble is, all these spooky monuments and inscrutable features seem mostly just thrown together.  I rarely got any sort of sense as to what they were supposed to have been.  The single biggest thing contributing to the lack of connection to the locations (aside from how sterile they all are) is the fact that all the doors connecting areas are teleporters.  You step through one and you're in an environment that looks nothing like the one you left; could be on the other side of the planet for all you know.  Most of these are just connecting corridors, with no purpose but to create a buffer between puzzle rooms.
Nearly all the puzzles themselves were quite simple and solved quickly, save one which was very obtuse.  Some of them are supposed to be reactivating dormant machinery (except that the stuff is so abstract you have no idea what it's supposed to [i]do[/i]), while others feel like puzzles for the sake of puzzles.
You can breeze through the main sections in just a few hours.  Once you do, there are a couple of tougher puzzles that require hunting around for the proper code.  There's also this scavenger hunt thing where you try to find all the hidden glyphs around the rooms.

There is no such thing as obvious, with a couple exceptions. The game doesn't teach you anything really, and you are left to your own devices to sort out what you are supposed to do and the proper order in which to do so.

SPOILERS

That this is maybe a galactic museum of sorts, or a museum at the end of the world, or something like that, and the last curator died, after which it fell into disrepair. You are basically fixing it and getting it up and running again.

SPOILER END

So, points off for not being very accessible at all, but points in its favor for being pretty unique and uniquely challenging. Pus, that secret ending was pretty funny when taking the rest of the game into consideration.

Las cosas pueden parecer algo y resultar no ser lo que crees, obligándote a replantearte el modo de avance o incluso hacerte sentir ridículo en algún que otro momento (si lo jugáis me entenderéis), los escenarios no dejan de sorprender, y a todo esto se le añade un apartado sonoro que encaja completamente en las ambientaciones, consiguiendo producirte sensaciones de lo más variadas (desde tranquilidad hasta inquietud sin ninguna amenaza aparente a la vista).

良い所
	ヒントの殆ど無いパズル要素
	謎解きはプレーヤー次第

悪い所
	酔う
	結局、謎は明かされない

FP視点でのパズルゲーム。

現代アートやビデオアートなどに興味があり、かつそういったものが好きで波長が合うなら楽しめるかと。

クリアーするだけならさほど難しくはないが、（オブジェクトの動かし方などに気づけるかそうでないかで難易度が変わる類のパズル）真のエンディングがあるような気がする。

これはプレイしなければわからないのだが、収集要素と隠し部屋、それと音の鳴る遊び部屋が謎のまま残る。

パズルを解くのは楽しいのだが、こういった雰囲気のゲームは最後になにか大きな秘密が紐解けると期待してしまう。そして期待は裏切られる。

因みに酔います。所謂、３Ｄ酔ですね。モーションブラー、フレームレート、フィルムグレイン、フィルターカラー・・・色々混ざってそうなっているのだろうか。

Oyun en basidinden puzzle çözme oyunu olarak geçiyor. O şekilde ilerlenen bir sisteme sahip. En büyük özelliği ise, mistik olması.

Artı Yönleri:
*En başta oyunun atmosferi: İlginç bir şekilde oyunu gergin oynamanızı sağlayan bir uğultu var arkada, onun yanı sıra oyununun oynanabilirliği sizi direk atmosferine alacak şekilde tasarlanmış. Daha iyi bir atmosfere girmek için gece kulaklıkla oynamanızı tavsiye ederim.
*İlginç görsellere sahip. Verilmek istenen bazı mesajlar var.
*Hikaye işleyişinin orijinal olması. Kayıp bir dünya gibi düşünün.
*Oyunda güzel yerlerde gizli kapı var ve bunun için dikkatli bir şekilde oyunu oynamanız gerekmekte.
*Puzzle zorluğu orta seviyede.
*Çok fazla gizemli bir tarzının olması ve insanda merak duygusunu uyandırması.
*Oyunun çok uzun sürmemesi: Bu da insanı sıkmıyor. 

Eksi Yönleri:
*Oynadığınız alan fazla büyük. Bayağı bir yürümeniz gerekiyor. Büyük bir ortam olması için uğraşmışlar ama bir süre sonra insanı bayıyor fazla yürümek.

Açıkçası çok fazla eksi bi özellik bulamadım. 5 Doları hak eden bir oyun. Ben oynarken çok keyif aldım. Zeka oyunlarını seven herkese tavsiye ediyorum.

Kairo is one of the most uniquely atmospheric game I've played. It's visuals are simple, but expertly crafted, both eerie and gorgeous at the same time. To say the least, the game is surreal in it's aesthetics. While the environment is some thing to take in, it's not just about looking at pretty set pieces, the game features mind bending puzzles as it's main motivator.

Though the game is incredibly enjoyable, and wonderfully put together, it does have some minor flaws. The movements feel rather sluggish, and at best, floaty, and there isn't much incentive to replay the game once completed. Not to sound cliche, but Kairo really is about the journey and not the destination.

For $5.00 at it's full price, you are getting a quality product. I can not recommend this game enough, especially at it's low price point. 

Pros:
- Excellent aesthetics
- Surreal and eerie atmosphere
- Interesting puzzles
- A very unique game overall
- $5.00 is unreasonably cheap. This is a good thing for the consumer (I personally think it's worth more than just $5.00)

Cons:
- Floaty controls
- Not a lot of replay incentives",1405282132,1405282219,True,6,0,0.61538463830947876,0,True,False,False,False,,,

...dass ohne viel Story trotzdem recht fesselnd ist.
...dass durch sein bizzares Setting überzeuget.
...dass mit gut ausgewogenen und zum größten Teil fairen Rätseln aufwartet.

Allerdings muss ich zugeben, dass es mir auf Dauer etwas zu linear und unübersichtlich wurde. 
Linear deshalb, da es permanent das selbe ist: Ich komme in einen Raum, rätsle etwas rum, löse das Rätsel und kann zum nächsten Rätsel weiter, zudem ich jedoch erstmal laufen muss. Nicht, dass mich jemand falsch versteht, die Rätsel machen Spaß, aber dieses Laufen ging mir mit der Zeit tierisch gegen den Strich (vor allem, wenn man ALLES im Spiel entdecken will. Hat hier jemand Achievment Jäger gesagt?). Und genau beim ""alles entdecken wollen"" wird es dann auch noch unübersichtlich, woraus ein öfteres Verlaufen bzw. ""Verlorengehen"" resultiert (war zumindest bei mir der Fall). Zum einfach mal ""durchrushen"" eignet sich dieses Spiel also eher weniger.

Das waren aber auch die einzigen zwei Negativpunkte. Wer gerne erkundet, sich nicht ständig fragt, wann die Story endlich anfängt, gerne länger in einem Spiel verweilt und auf eine komplett abstrakte und abgedrehte Spielwelt steht, sollte sich dieses Spiel unbedingt mal genauer anschauen.
Und für Indie-Fans eh ein Muss!

Gameplay:  7/10
Delivering a new and fun approach to puzzle gaming, Kairo give hours of fun with an ancient twist. The gameplay is simple yet effective, it delivers a challenging balance between the need to use logic and intuition.

Game ambiance: 6/10
There is little in the way of graphic ambiance in Kiro; odd geometries floating about with an abundance of fog. This is exemplified by the subtle use of sound and music. What it does have is a creative and well blended atmosphere between these elements to give a relaxing sense of space and mystery.

Reliability/Stability: 10/10
The game has had no issues to report.

Story/Plot: n/a


Concept: 6/10
The idea of using ancient Egypt in the puzzle genre of gaming has been around for a while. But it's never been done in this way.

Concept execution: 7/10
Creative, original, simple and effective; the execution of this game is almost dream-like. Unlike other puzzle games Kairo enables a challenging, stress-free, fun and relaxed problem solving platform to explore.

Textures: 2/10
Nothing special, but then nothing special is needed.

Modelling: 4/10
Just the bare minimum modeling has been done. Don't let this deter you though, any more would spoil the effect.

Graphics: 5/10
Overall the graphics are average, but still effective. The creative use of perspective goes a long way in this game.

Sound: 4/10
The sound is simple and only added where needed. This also adds to the whole feel and concept execution of this game.

Music: 7/10
Well written ambiance that is a magical match to the visuals.

This game, to me, perfects the feeling of loneliness (related spoilers in brackets below)
This feeling of loneliness was so present and so overwhelming to me, and I kept moving on wondering what was next. As time went on and things started being revealed to me, the things which were revealed only made that feeling of loneliness grow. There were some points at which I also felt fear, the sort of fear you feel when you want to get out of a room and you don't know quite why, so you run out and slam the door behind you.
The game itself is pretty solid. You have no inventory and no buttons with which you can use to interact with things. You walk jump and look around and those are the only controls. The variety of puzzles despite this is amazing, and most of them make perfect sense (there was one where you rotate two gears to match symbols in some weird arbitrary manner and I never actually figured out what the connection was. Had to use a guide for that part)
If I didn't have the emotional capacity of a potato I would have cried at the end, I swear to god, it just HIT ME RIGHT THERE, RIGHT IN THE WEAK POINT. So please please PLEASE BUY THIS GAME.

[there's a moment in the game where you walk into a room and press a button. TV screens turn on around you, showing a humanlike figure behind static. As you solve the puzzles around this point in the game, this figure pops up on more TV screens as you complete puzzles. As I played through I thought to myself, ""Is that another human? If I meet them what will happen? Who are they?"" At some point you find yourself in a green tinted room with another TV, only larger and in front of a table. When you walk around the table, you find a skeleton on a chair with monitors examining puzzles you've completed in front of it. There is a message scratched onto the arm of the chair.

The sounds are something else and just sound so lively in a place that is almost entirely desolate. Find a certain thing or two in the game can be equally heartbreaking and allows you to come to your own conclusion on what you think led to the events in this game.

Positives:

- Decent scripting I guess

Negatives:

- Pretty much everything
- Boring gameplay
- No storyline


You spawn in a world with absoutely no clue how you got there. You don't have a name, you don't have a goal, you don't have anything to find. The story is non existing.

Some games can be good even without a clear goal or a background story, but not in this case.

Not only do you have no goal, enemies or purpose in Kairo whatsoever, the puzzles are also simple but yet confusing. You can not interact with anything and you don't have an inventory, meaning that all you can do is move objects by walking towards them, or jump on random platforms in hope that something will happen. Really, really simple puzzles. And when I say it's also confusing, what I mean is, you don't really know why you are doing what you are doing due to the non existing story and the few hints you get doesn't really help that much at all.


Do I recommend this game? No. I don't recommend it to anyone.

People that love adventures, no. The game is as simple as it can be (including the soundtracks and gameplay in general) with nothing to explore or discover at all. You don't even have a purpose or anything to lose. Not even health (no, you can't even die in this game).

People that like puzzle games, no. Again, the puzzles are basic, yet confusing, and you don't really know why you are doing them.

People that love a good storyline, no. There is no story in this game at all.

No explanations. If you want to degrade yourself by using the ""hints"" provided, then you might have some idea of what needs to happen. Otherwise? Well...maybe if you hop backwards on one leg the door will open.

Don't get me wrong, the puzzles in Kairo are great! They twist and bend your mind in ways that few activities do. Sadly, this is somewhat diminished by the monotonous tone of walking through nothingness hitting the Escape key for your next clue. It looks like someone wanted to make a game of random puzzles, but felt the need to incorporate a storyline. This is fine, of course, unless you refuse to use any words at all - written or spoken. As the player, you end up with a small hint as to anything that did happen/will happen/is happening....then the game ends. Congratulations! You've solved 3 hours worth of puzzle game!

[b]Most valuable resource:[/b] The art.
[b]Of interest to:[/b] people who appreciate geometric abstraction, and like deeply mysterious Myst-style puzzlers.

I have never before played a game with such an incredible feeling of scale.  The place is enigmatic, it is stunning but, more than anything else, it is *overpoweringly huge*.  Figuring out what you are supposed to be doing is part of the experience of this game, so don't be put off by what appears at the outset to be random acts of geometry.  There is meaning and purpose to this place; it just takes some time to start to piece it together.  This is a different kind of narrative.

For me the strangest part of the experience of Kairo is that at the outset you are in a place of geometry and void, with no personality or sense of place; you are cast adrift with no instructions whatsoever, completely alone in a place which amplifies aloneness.  You aren't even sure what the game is, let alone what the game world is all about.  But by the end you feel like you know this place, you understand it, it is familiar and you are at home here - which, given the way the game ends, is the ultimate irony.

There is a story here, but one told without words, and it is a magnificent story of great scale and great aloneness, and it is masterfully told.",1403410110,1411465850,True,1,0,0.501199066638946533,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Somewhere between fascinating and terrifying, wondrous and foreboding. There are no monsters or even imminent threats really, but still your entire surroundings feel so ancient and so much grander than you that it creates an incredibly ominous feeling that never quite goes away.

As you interact with the world, huge abandoned structures come to life, and though the scenery changes and the paths are made clear, you never really know what’s going on under the surface. What do these huge contraptions actually do? Where is it leading? And how did all of it (and you for that matter) end up here? You get the sense that you’ll never really know, because it’s all just too ancient, too alien for your understanding.

The entire experience is rather chilling, and if you let yourself really become immersed in this world, you’ll probably find yourself making some pretty strange sounds, like I was, and laughing at points about just how uncomfortable it actually makes you.

The game isn’t perfect. There are bugs, but those tend to add to the strangeness of the environment in a way. One noticeable fault I had was that the footstep sounds are the exact same no matter what your pace is. This may sound minor, but it is rather noticeable at times when you are really taking it slow to take in your surroundings, which you will probably do quite a lot. Still a minor complaint in face of everything that’s really on display in this one.

I bought it during a Summer Sale at $1.50, and I would probably recommend it at a fairly higher price-tag even still.

What they talk about on the site is: after we dump a bunch of nuclear waste somewhere and seal it off, how do we signal to future generations that they should stay away? Given that the half-life of the waste in question is 10,000 years, about as long as recorded history, this poses a significant problem: how do we communicate with people who will likely be nothing like us, and have a very limited understanding of our language, society and history; how do we tell them that they should not hang out in or excavate this nuclear waste dump? The expert judgers come up with a series of sculptural and architectural edifices, things that imply danger and will last millennia, and each one is more bizarre, desolate and brutal than the last. 

A lot of what I see and do in Kairo feels like I'm interacting with someone's answer to that kind of question (although not about nuclear waste, specifically), which is extremely cool. 

It doesn't hurt that the puzzles are very good. Gameplay is mostly about observation, testing interactions and figuring out how things work. It's kind of like Riven in that regard, and so far I haven't run up against any versions of classically lazy puzzles. Which is to say: no sliding tile puzzles, no finding the bauble and sticking it into the mcdooly, no one-on/one-off puzzles where you try to get everything to sync up as on or off. The first step of every puzzle is figuring out its rules and its pieces, and then trying to understand what the end goal is. It's all very seamless, very understated, and very rewarding.

Любителей спинномозговых шутеров, фанатов ""графона как в Crysis"", либо просто нетерпеливых игроков я призываю немедленно закрыть эту страницу, запустить любимый CoD или Battlefield и забыть о Kairo как о страшном сне.

Дело в том, что это [b]инди в квадрате[/b], это одна большая метафора, выполненная в простом, но в то же время завораживающем стиле. Здесь отсутствует сюжет в привычном понимании - суть происходящего преподносится в виде небольших ""флешбеков"", если хотите, после прохождения группы комнат. По большому счёту, сюжет здесь и не важен - он добавлен лишь для создания определённого настроения при прохождении. Не буду спойлерить, это нужно увидеть собственными глазами в определённые моменты.

Геймплей представляет собой игру от первого лица, основанную на решении пазлов. Последние, в свою очередь, иногда обескураживают своей алогичностью, и чем дальше по ходу игры, тем чаще. Мне сложно понять, чем руководствовались и вдохновлялись разработчики и левел-дизайнеры при их создании, но периодически возникает ощущение, будто нас специально задерживают в прохождении. Данный факт раздражает, поэтому я рекомендую найти прохождение на YouTube, открыть в фоне и время от времени сверяться с ним. Тем более, что в конце игры есть замечательная комната-пасхалка, выполнить условия для попадания в которую при обычном прохождении решительно невозможно.

От плохого к хорошему - звуковое сопровождение [b][i]великолепное[/i][/b]. Я прошёл Kairo уже очень давно, но некоторые фоновые треки прочно запали в душу, и я время от времени их переслушиваю. Медитативный эмбиент грамотно подобран к каждому помещению, он ненавязчивый, но в то же время составляет единое целое с самой архитектурой. Ни разу и нигде не возникло желания убавить/выключить звук, а это очень хороший показатель для игры.

Графическая составляющая, как сказано выше, простая, можно сказать, ""рубленая"". У каждой комнаты есть свой цвет и ""настроение"". Внутри обычно всё составлено из примитивных угловатых форм, но в сочетании с хорошим светом и музыкой, запоминается и выглядит законченно.

[i]Резюме: Kairo - игра на противоречиях. С одной стороны, мы имеем невзрачную графическую составляющую (с технической точки зрения), невнятные пазлы и отсутствие нормального разъяснения, что собственно тут происходит - всё это в совокупности может оттолкнуть многих игроков. С другой стороны, перед нами предстают интересные дизайнерские решения, действительно красивая, запоминающаяся музыка, и та самая потайная комната.
С какой стороны смотреть на Kairo - решать только вам. Мой стакан всегда наполовину полон :)[/i]",1401906710,1401909823,True,52,0,0.739367902278900146,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Половина задачек элементарна, другая подчиняется нечеловеческой логике, третья половина (потому что секретная) напоминает аналогичные задачки из FEZ, только здесь намного меньше мягких подсказок и целостности мира, чтобы их понять.

Внешне игра пытается быть стильно минималистичной, но больше похожа на неаккуратную и грязную. Тем более автор и сам это понимает, раз использовал эффект убитой плёнки по умолчанию. Текстуры очень тухлые и режущие глаз, постоянно видны места заполнения, да и общая гамма как-то не слишком приятна. По общей стилистике и качеству исполнения, на фоне этой игры даже первый Quake кажется царством радости, веселья и высокополигональя. А символы выполненные с помощью стандартных шрифтовых круглых скобок "")("" - вообще убожественны.
Внешний вид уровней так же безыдеен и угловат. Да и нельзя сказать что он стилистически выдержан. Он постоянно использует некоторые элементы оформления один раз и больше никогда не возвращается к ним. Некоторые комнаты выглядят аккуратно и вполне со вкусом, в то время другие наслаждаются откровенным супрематизмом, третьи пытаются выглядеть нормально, а четвёртые, пытаясь выглядеть нормально - радостно проваливают это и выглядят запредельно низкокачественно. Да и повсеместные следы разрушения и сколы больше относятся к реальному миру физических материалов, что очень контрастирует с местной сверхнизкополигональной абстракцией. В одном месте игра использует старую концепцию ""дорога возникает под шагами идущего"", в то время как хорошая игра из неё одной может построить всю стилистику целиком (Bastion).

История у игры про всякую типичную метафорическую хpень о падении человечества и всепрощении, но лучше бы игра оставалась абстрактной, так как всякие стандартные образы древних цивилизаций, дезоксирибонуклеиновой кислоты, химические схемы и фотографии Эйнштейна заезженны до смерти и, кроме того, совершенно не вписываются в окружение.

Достижения рабочие, картиночки - в одном стиле, с названиями авторы тоже поигрались. На прохождение и на сбор всех секретов. Достижение на поиск всех символов на стенах (исследовательское) находится в довольно странном положении. В нормальных играх такие обычно используют, чтобы игрок не пропускал особенно удачные места созданные планировщиками уровней и художниками: красивый вид, трагический элемент повествования вроде обнимающихся скелетов и прочее. Однако здесь не только смотреть особо нечего, так как всё одинаково нищенское и квадратное, но и сами символы зачастую спрятаны в самых дальних и пустых, унылых уголках. Так обычно делают не очень хорошие игры, чтобы: растянуть время игры и накрутить часы на тех, кто любит собирать все достижения; растянуть время игры и накрутить часы для тех, кто хочет поиграть подольше и ищет после прохождения дополнительных трудностей; или просто засунуть достижение ради достижения, так как это одна из самых нетребовательных для разработчика разновидностей в плане умственных затрат. Но в то же время можно сказать, что поиск символов помогает обнаружить тайные двери, которые подсказывают о дополнительных комнатах и ""секретной концовке"".

В целом игру можно порекомендовать только неприхотливым любителям туристическо-исследовательских игр, не гнушающихся супрематизма или неприхотливым любителям простеньких головоломок. Для остальных игроков: какое-то впечатление огромные размеры и псевдо-странные сцены могут и оставить, но нельзя сказать чтобы играть было прямо настолько уж интересно.

The puzzles are generally fairly easy, although there are no real instructions and most of the puzzles require you to use your surroundings to figure out what to do.  In addition the ""secret"" puzzles are a pretty big step up in difficulty and will likely resort to the user having to consult a guide.

All of that said, the game succeeds with what it's trying to do.  The atmosphere is engrossing and engaging and the game is neither too easy or too difficult.  It's really a shame it was only 3-4 hours long, 'cause I think it could have been twice as long and not worn out its welcome.

For every step you take in this lonely world, you find yourself seemingly stuck and lost within yourself as well. Film grain covers your field of vision as you navigate the towers, solving a wide plethora of puzzles, from simple navigation of a simple maze to interpreting a star map just to open a door to running on treadmills, Kairo does the puzzle genre justice by infusing complex and mind-boggling puzzles towards a simplistic, minimalist world. The colours are beautiful, the gameplay is relatively solid (although I personally find the movement a little too sensitive) and this is really immersive by itself (if you play in a dark room with headphones).

A drawback for me personally was that I found myself getting lost most of the time, that I was unable to have a good view of the puzzle I'm trying to solve. Like a rat in a maze, I could not see the big picture of the puzzle and I had to keep walking in circles trying to figure out what I've done, even resorting to sketching out some rooms on a piece of paper and drawing the various interactive elements on the paper so I can figure out what in the world is going on. It does interrupt the flow of the game for me sometimes and it was a little distracting to the overall feel of the game.

In short, despite the few rough edges of this work of art, Kairo is really a beautiful gameset (with its fair share of really, really creepy elements and depictions here and there), really meant for the casual player to play and enjoy this surreal world, while unraveling a terrible tale that led to this place. If you're a puzzle nut and you enjoy creepy, lonely worlds, Kairo really is the place for you to be.

Eurogamer has succiently highlighted the deep spine of Kairo. ""Kairo is mysterious and elegant and powerfully distinct. Like Fez and Minecraft, it will work your way into your dreams if you're not careful.""

Play at your own risk, because Kairo does leave impressions in your mind as you play it, with the wide rooms and chilling images (when you stumble upon some seemingly ""dead ends"") and huge, huge glyphs.

First, the puzzles. While they start out easy, later in the game, they are really counter intuitive(At least the devs had the idea of including hints).
I was stuck on the last ""world"", not even because I was stuck on a puzzle, but I simply didn't knew what puzzle was left to do.
Not to mention the optional puzzles that lead to the secret ending(which is just stupid and feel more like a filler than rewarding) are even harder and are simply undo-able without a guide. Also, they require backtracking.

The graphics are both basic and good, and the game run very well on low end computers(Even with shaders on). Though the environments are sometimes too lazy and blocky. The ambient music is also great, and give a mood to each ""room"".

The ""story""... Okay, I just don't get it. Kairo use a lot of morbid symbols, post-apocalyptic pictures, etc, but it never feel more than an assemblage of tropes(""Oh, look how creepy is this place! So creppy, huh???"") rather than a mysterious story. So don't buy this game for the story.

À travers des environnements abstraits et visuellement dépouillés, par l'exploration de salles reliées autour de plusieurs hubs - certaines salles sont justes là pour faire la transition entre les autres, quand elles ne proposent pas d'énigmes. Les énigmes sont visuelles, mémorielles et résolubles en se déplaçant uniquement ou en observant, puisqu'il n'y a pas de touches d'action. En soi ce n'est pas un problème, et c'est tout de suite rafraichissant, après-tout, exit les guns et les puzzles-jump (clin d'oeil à la série Portal), voilà bien un concept sympa, si l'on attend un level design qui suit.

Or la principale difficulté reviendra à chercher ce que la salle nous demande de faire, et s'il existe bien une interaction tangible. En effet, dans la première catégorie de puzzles du jeu les énigmes sont extrêmement simplistes une fois que l'on a compris ce qui nous a été demandé : on mémorise des symboles et on marche dessus, on marche sur d'autres dans ordre particulier ou l'on circule dans un espace labyrinthique, etc. Pour la deuxième catégorie de puzzle (facultatifs pour la plupart), ils sont impossibles sans un guide, puisqu'il n'existe aucun indice dans le jeu indiquant les patterns nécessaires à la résolution des puzzles, si ce n'est de tatonner parmis une pléthore d'essais. À dire vrai, j'ai commencé à regarder dans un guide car j'étais bloqué dans une de ses fameuses salles (2 sont nécessaires tout de même pour atteindre la fin du jeu). Et vous savez ce qui est drôle ? C'est que l'auteur du guide n'y voit lui-même aucune logique derrière l'explication de ces puzzles contre-intuitifs et abstraits à souhait. Oui oui, les développeurs ont donc visuellement cherché à rendre difficile artificiellement la résolution de problèmes par les difficultés à l'esprit humain de distinguer des cohérences et des indices parmi un dédale de zones abstraites et confuses et dont la direction artistique - qui pourquoi pas, propose un cadre psychédélique amusant - ne sert parfois ni le gameplay, ni le propos, voire, n'y proposent pas de solutions.

Et en parlant de propos et de direction artistique, on a l'impression de se balader dans un musée d'art contemporain dont l'architecte aurait auparavant absorbé de nombreuses substances illicites. On affiche des images post-apocalyptiques par ci, des architectures improbables branlette-arty et une ambiance sonore et visuelle ""creepy"" qui cherche à mettre particulièrement mal à l'aise (""tu as vu les cercueils sans nom ? et la salle des caméras et ce squelette qui te regardait depuis le début ? tr0p d4rk""). Trop de symbolisme tue le symbolisme, surtout si ce pot-pourri de références (animaux pour l'arche de Noé ? un phare pour quoi faire ?) n'amène à aucune conclusion que ce soit, nous laissant de marbre devant un néant absolu de signification et un degré d'abstraction brûlant ce qui nous reste de neurones. Ha, et je n'ai même pas parlé des mécanismes cachés obscurs amenant à une fin secrète dans une salle des développeurs, nous suggérant leur travail ou probablement pour afficher un poème nébuleux et un au final un gag qui dure deux secondes.

It is great how it can give you so much with so bare materials. You walk around huge constructions, trying to make sense of it. And then you realize you are the life inside these dead empty endless halls.

Kairo begins with a throne in the middle of nowhere. You're alone, there's nothing. But ""nothing"" becomes something tangible, you begin to think about nothingness. You enter this nothingness, this void, and find many things there. Things buried, forgotten. Other thrones, kings, or perhaps other times of the same reign. But you are the king of a dead and empty realm. Are you alone. There is a world out there and you do not have access to it. There is life, and all you see are images, codes, machines, mementos.

Could the machines drive you back to life? Where does this light leads? Where does this flow leads? Where will you go? Who built it? For what purpose? Where are you really? Maybe in a hospital bed, waiting to wake up. I enjoyed every minute of this trip. I did not understand almost anything, but what I did was enough to make the trip worthwhile.

This game is about second chances. You move from a lifeless place to a garden with flowing life. It is really about coming back to life, so it is another game that helped me recover. It is amazing how this message is there without the need of any word. It is a memorable experience.

Aristóteles lo llevaría a su terreno y lo encajó dentro de la oratoria política como el “momento y el contexto adecuado en el que la prueba debe entregarse”. Aristóteles no era un mal tipo del todo, y lo que él definía como prueba de ese argumento irrefutable que dicho en el contexto y momento adecuado dejaba a tu adversario con el culo torcido y sin saber qué decir, Kairo, el Kairo de Richard Perrin, lo desarrolla como discurso, añadiendo un tercer elemento que he decidido llamar “el yo argumental” PORQUE TENGO ESTUDIOS. Vale, esta crítica no va ser sencilla, pero es que telita con Kairo.

Ante tanta vacuidad en el primer párrafo, sentemos un par bases para que ustedes y yo tengamos claro de lo que estamos hablando: Kairo es bonito, tiene puzles y es un juego. No estamos ante una propuesta narrativa y sensorial como podría ser Dear Esther.

Perrin nos muestra un mundo donde hay elementos con los que interactuar, acertijos que resolver y algo parecido a un avance, lo cual encaja bastante bien en la definición de “juego”. Otra cosa es que todo lo que nos presente tenga tantas lecturas que pueda joderle la cabeza.

Siguiendo con la representación simple de su planteamiento, podríamos decir que Kairo nos presenta una serie de salas de distinta arquitectura en las que tendremos que resolver rompecabezas no demasiado claros, pero tampoco demasiado complejos. Entender el que hay que hacer nos llevará más tiempo que hacerlo, lo cual supongo que podría definirse como una suerte de pre-rompecabezas. Estas salas no se representan bajo un tratamiento lineal, y tendremos a nuestra disposición todas o la mayoría de ellas al comienzo de cada nivel (y eso de decir nivel aquí sí que es ambiguo). El tratamiento de estas salas está realizado desde un tratamiento arquitectónico sencillo, pero con una identificación de cada una de las estancias muy marcada, utilizando una gama de colores básicos diferente en cada una de ellas. Si hablamos de su diseño nos encontramos con un diseño limpio de geometrías sencillas que ayudan a dar fuerza al elemento de manipulación del “yo tangible”, y toca explicarlo.


Todo lo que podamos hacer en una sala es sencillo de hacer. Los botones son grandes, los elementos a pulsar, a arrastrar o colocar son perfectamente identificables en una primera observación. Kairo usa estos elementos para evitar la sensación de irrealidad que emana el título y trasladarnos a un “yo físico” dentro de su realidad. Algunos puzles se resuelven simplemente con nuestro movimiento, como esos totems que se separan o juntan de sí mismos según la dirección en la que estemos caminando. Kairo recalca que nuestra presencia en ese universo es necesaria para el funcionamiento del mismo. Nunca sabremos donde nos encontramos o quién o qué construyó esas salas.

Kairo renuncia al concepto Portal de “pruebas diseñadas para usted” abrazando el “usted está aquí y por eso esto existe”

El conjunto artístico de Kairo quedaría incompleto si no reservamos un espacio para su sonido, el cual sirve tanto para ambientar como para la resolución de puzles. Su elaboración sigue las pautas de su arquitectura, siendo en la mayoría de los casos sonidos de corte sencillo y si me apuran “tecnológico”. En un juego que basa su discurso en el poder de comprensión del jugador, el sonido ha de tener un papel narrativo y Kairo juega con ese papel dando pistas constantes de si lo que estamos haciendo está bien o no. Su integración con los demás elementos se produce a base de mensajes estáticos o voces lejanas incompresibles que nunca llegamos a escuchar correctamente, componiendo una banda sonora tan singular como el resto del título.

Richard Perrin ha creado una experiencia única en la que un servidor se lamenta de su pobre conocimiento arquitectónico y maldice no entender el significado conceptual de las cadenas de ADN que sobrevuelan alguna sala. La sensación de que no estaba a la altura de lo que Perrin pretendía contarme me acompañó durante todo mi viaje, y sin embargo he disfrutado mucho con Kairo. Mucho más una vez han pasado un par de días desde que lo acabé. Quizá nunca llegue a entender lo que Perrin quiso decirme, pero me gustó cómo lo dijo. Quizá haya que aceptar esta rara avis como lo que es: un extraño universo explorable al que llegas en el momento adecuado para hacer algo.",1395932418,1395932418,True,23,0,0.587218880653381348,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I absolutely love ""artsy"" games like this. However, there were several problems that tainted the experience for me.

Puzzles - They are counter-intuitive. While some puzzles make sense and are easy to figure out, others don't. For example, the puzzle at the back of the light house where you step on certain blocks seemed entirely random.

Movement, view, and mouse control - The extremely smooth movement in combination with narrow point of view made me feel sick to my stomach within 10 minutes. The lag between when I moved my mouse in comparison to when the character moved certainly didn't help, but that may have just been caused by my machine.

Broken pause menu - Again, this may have just been my machine, but during the pause menu, there was no way to select any options. I could only exit the pause menu by hitting escape. When I wanted to quit the game, I had to alt-tab and force close it. Being able to access the options may have been able to fix my previous complaint.

Empty textures - Textures and objects seemed empty and incomplete. I know that is the art style this game is going for, but it still seems very unpolished.

Sound - In games like this, sound effects and music need to take advantage of the atmosphere. I found most of the sound effects were cheesy and took away from the experience. For example, the cheap MIDI gong sound whenever you made progress in a puzzle is just awful. A lot of the time, there was too much silence, or just unvarying static, that could have benefited greatly with ambient music. During the few moments that ambient music was present, it seemed immaturely written and distracting.

I think that covers about everything I found poorly done in this game. Luckily, I bought it on sale and obtained a foil card so I have already made my money back. I really do want to enjoy this game and am disappointed that I didn't, since it seems like an interesting idea and I liked the lonely atmosphere.

Kairo is every bit as fun and eerie as you would want a 3D puzzle game to be.  Do yourself a favor and play this game alone and uninterrupted for a full immersive feel.  There are no verbal cues - as in you will never have another character speak to you, and you will never hear your own character talk.  There aren't any written cues or instructions beyond symbols you find (and of course the gentle hints in your menu screen, should you need them).  It's all about using the landscape and the machines and puzzles to your advantage - to a visual person like me, this was a wonderful experience.  Each different area in the game has its own color scheme and chosen background music and sounds from one of the game's tracks (the music is great for the game and ranges from ""Fairly soothing and enlightening"", to ""I feel like someone just shoved ice down the back of my shirt"").

Well you'll see (I really do love the architecture in some parts).

I must say I am torn in calling it a ""game"": it is more like a tech demo for Oculus Rift rather than a full fledged game. Or maybe you can consider it a piece of art thanks to his honiric atmosphere made of abstract buildings, strange obelisks, floating stairways and often one-colour tinted rooms. I am also torn in recommending it.

Aim of the game? You start outside a strange building and you have to find the secrets it hides inside... There is no inventory, no weapons, no HUD, no text, no help, only you. Music is relaxing and puzzles do not require a lot of thinking, letting you progress nicely in the game (unfortunately not very long: about 4 hours).

I think it is an awesome experience with Oculus Rift, but on PC it didn't catch me at all. Boring!

The best way to describe is it is a Myst like experience where you travel through enormous rooms and areas that are large puzzles to figure out. There's no weaponry, no enemies unless you count the puzzles and you pretty much cannot die (falling off ledges just puts you back on the ledge). Each room is dominated by a simple color scheme and the architecture is large and blocky as giving the environment an ancient feel.

When played on a normal monitor, the simple graphics and plain architecture might seem like a negative. However, you activate VR, put on the Rift and you realize these graphics are now a strength. Just as Valve Steam Dev Days demo showed, so long as you keep latency low and frame rate high even a simple environment will seem real. Kairo delivers on this concept in spades. The large throne rooms, invisible maze arena, hollow pyramids, giant light orb and many other breathtaking sites fill this game. The slow pace and not too mind bending puzzles mean you're seeing new areas yet have plenty of time to appreciate each one. The sounds are different for each location and all are relaxing and never seem to be over bearing or painfully loud. There are a few cases where the sudden movement of the environment surprised me, but never did I feel the need to pull out of the game. The presence is strong and even with lengthy gameplay I did not notice much if any in the way of nausea. The frame rate seems great throughout with only one room (the one with four treadmills) showing lag.

Like Dear Esther, I play this game standing up and do the fake foot walk to aid in my immersion. The look is not tied to the control movement so it's easy to look around and enjoy the environment as you travel through. Its very easy to get drawn into the game and forget that you're in your room playing a game.

People probably have missed that this is a VR game as it does not seem to have the ""VR Support"" tag in the Steam search function. I've written the author and asked if he can get that added. As I said, for only $5 you're getting several hours of a great VR experience. A perfect game for those that prefer relaxed gameplay over the horror or shooter style games currently listed with VR support.",1390630164,1390630164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Welcome to the strange, yet simple and relaxing world of Kairo. It's a world filled with many ambiances, many puzzles, and many secrets.
The gameplay is that simple, reduced to only movements, triggers activating by just pushing or walking passed them. Most of the puzzles also aren't difficult, with hints provided in the menu if you need some help. Though, some secrets are pretty hard to find or solve, and you might want to pass them if you don't want to spend a lot of time on them.
But what makes Kairo different is the collection of ambiances and places, some people might see them like poetry, despite the lack of plot. Of course you will have a hard time enjoying this if you seek action.

Overall, its a nice, short, but most importantly relaxing game.

D'un côté, j'ai trouvé le concept original, c'est un alien comparé aux autres jeux d'aventure que je connais.

Graphismes cubiques et épurés, atmosphère sonore qui donne à ce monde une ambiance mystérieuse et parfois angoissante.
Difficile de commenter l'histoire ou le ""but"" général du jeu, c’est aussi bizarre que tout le reste.

Par contre, premier point négatif : à mes yeux, il est quasiment impossible de terminer ce jeu sans utiliser des aides extérieures (tels des guides/walkthrough) rien que pour trouver toutes les runes par exemple. A moins qu'on veuille y passer des heures et explorer chaque pièce en long, en large et en travers. En clair, faire preuve d'une patience que je n'ai, je l'avoue, pas eu.
Heureusement, les énigmes principales sont un peu plus simples si on arrive à en comprendre le but et les astuces, ce qui nous permet dans ce cas d'avancer dans le jeu. 

Deuxième point négatif : qu'est-ce qu'on peut marcher... Certes, c'est un jeu d'exploration mais même si la possibilité de ""courir"" nous est offerte, la vitesse n'est pas forcément grandiose et le temps peut souvent paraître très long. 

Troisième point semi-négatif : on ne peut pas enregistrer nous-même la partie au cours du jeu. C'est le jeu qui le fait automatiquement mais pas forcément au moment où on le désire. Mieux vaut finir une énigme avant de quitter si on ne veut pas avoir de mauvaise surprise.

The sound and visuals work well together to build a nice atmosphere; the screenshots on the steam store speak for themselves. The mystery in the game starts to build up quite nicely as the game goes on, although I felt left wanting more of a final payoff.

There are puzzles each step of the exploration, and you can just do these and get the impression you're contributing to a much larger puzzle you eventually solve, or you can read into things much further. You're not given too much to go on, but you can surmise a few things. I completed it and then read a guide that showed how to solve the three non-essential puzzles which give strong indications of a deeper underlying narrative. These puzzles are a huge qualitative step up in difficulty. The main puzzles are fairly straightforward enough to not even need the hint system, but these are fiendish and involve getting hints from places well outside of the puzzle rooms and even needing the assistance of other Kairo players. I wasn't prepared to spend the time I'd spent doing the main game just hunting for ways to get these last bits, so I used a guide. If you don't have time either, I really recommend doing the same to get these last titbits as they firmly solidify hints you may have picked up throughout the main journey as to the meaning and purpose of Kairo, which is a really excellent thing.

The machine, tower, and everything else is abandonned, and needs to be restarted. This requires you to solve a series of inventive, if no-nonsense puzzles in order to proceed.

The puzzles are somewhat challenging. I say this because the musical score alerts you when you're on the right track, or are doing something incorrectly. This can lead to simply listening to cues in order to proceed with the game.

Atmosphere/Story/Game World I can honestly say I don't think I've ever played a game with half as much atmosphere as Kairo, and the fact that it does it with the most basic of graphics, no voice acting, no back story, no cinematics, and no supporting characters is astounding. Everything, the soundtrack, the mysterious, blocky architecture, the vast empty spaces, the grain filter over everything, even the floaty controls, all of it feels deliberate and just drips with atmosphere and conveys the story in a way that is far more compelling than any amount exposition ever could be. It is so immersive, if you allow it to be, that it will actually make the hair on your neck and arms stand on end and your skin crawl, in a good way, even for someone who dislikes the entire horror genera. You know you're alone but you just can't shake the feeling that something is off, that you're being watched. I imagine this is exactly how you'd feel if you were exploring an empty, foreign world in real life. It taps straight into your human nature, you have this creepy feeling but you have to keep going, you have to learn more about this world and what happened. Truly amazing.

There are some bugs or places where it isn't as polished as some titles. The biggest issue is that can see through geometry when you stand right next to it. There were also some places that I wasn't sure if there was a graphical error or just a design choice. Mainly places that seemed like there was a floor, I could walk and jump, but I appeared to be walking in space. Overall pretty polished.

Puzzles/Exploration Yet another place where Kairo shines. None of the main puzzles are that hard, you may need the hints in the menu for one or two, but the way that they are presented is the epitome of good puzzle design. The full extent of each puzzle is usually not fully apparent when you enter a room but the game does a brilliant job of ""teaching"" you the rules as you try and solve it. You probably won't solve it the first time but the penalty for failing is very small, basically just starting over, a few seconds lost at most, but you should have learned something new about the puzzle and will do better the next time. Sometimes you need to explore to find a hint in the environment, other times you just have to start interacting and see what happens. Besides the puzzles used to advance through the world there are a number of optional puzzles and objectives that you can choose to complete. There are 18 hidden glyphs, your basic exploration collectables, 4 seals in hidden rooms, and 3 extra puzzles, much harder, with clues scattered across the world but aren't explained. From what I've heard these puzzles were designed as sort of community puzzles, where players collaborated and shared findings to discover the answers together. It was probably pretty fun after launch but at this point you may need to look up the old threads to solve them, or at least get some hints. Theses extras aren't needed to complete the game but some of them can add a little (vague) context to the story.

Summery Kairo is a buy, no questions asked. It's the perfect length, the puzzles are intuitive and fun to solve, and the world and atmosphere are something every gamer should experience, doubly so if you are, or are interested in becoming, a game developer.

When I found Kairo and read that it advertised both aspects within its experience, I was instantly bought.

Kairo doesn't offer much in explanation. Every where you go is pretty much bathed in a single chromatic color with plain textures adorning every strange shape of your enviroment. This strangeness is accentuated even more with its plain droning music that is more akin to white noise. There is no death in Kairo either. There is no way to fail in Kairo. In Kairo it is just you, your mind and Kairo.

Now, what exactly is Kairo and why are you there? To understand these things you must venture into your new world. Kairo is seperated into hubs, within in those hubs are different rooms that contain a puzzle. Solve the puzzles and move on to the next hub until you reach the end. That's your goal. The puzzles themselves are not the most complicated thing to accomplish, pull a switch, push a block, align a grid ect and if you ever find yourself stuck there are also helpful hints in the options!

Other than getting to the end there are a few other things to accomplish as detailed by the achievements. Scattered throughout Kairo are 18 runes to collect, a few beacons to activate and a couple of tricky secrety puzzles to solve. I personally feel that if you are invested even in the slightist for Kairo's world then these extra goals should be mandatory for players to solve. The reward in narritive and overall experience trumps the extra hour or two one puts in to accomplish these goals. A helpful tip/warning though, always make sure you collect all the glyphs in an area before moving on! Backtracking for glyphs can be a pain in the ass! And if you must backtrack wait until the last hub!

Overall Kairo is a very very short game. This is a good thing though as with such games you will find yourself thinking more about the world as apposed to the gameplay. Kairo is very good food for your brain and whether it's on sale or for the normal five dollars trust me if you like exploration and mystery this is a fantastic deal.",1385621737,1385621737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To those that message me every time I write a recommendation saying “you write long recommendations” … THIS is going to be a long one.

I have a thing for first person puzzle games at the moment, and I was rather intrigued by this games trailer and description. I think what interested me most, was the sense of ‘mystery’ that I got from the trailer. It doesn’t tell you what it is about, or why you are there or what’s going on… and to be honest this game has a real mysterious feel to it throughout the whole thing, you’re asking yourself questions on the who, what and whys but in fairness they aren’t answered all that clearly. 
And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 
I think games that are open to interpretation are great in their own way. The whole mystery and wonder to this game is great and all, but the structure and direction can sometimes make you just feel lost. At least for me anyways, that’s just my opinion of course, but there was a few times during the play through that I just asked, what the hell am I supposed to be doing here…

The puzzles themselves are very interesting, they are creative, they really make you think and make you put things together in ways that I’m not really used to. They are unique kinds of puzzles and there is a lot of symbols and shapes and colours that you have to try and think about what they might mean and what the logic behind the puzzle might be.

The music in the game is very moody, it really brings out that feel of the game. Which for me was quite cold, and dull. There isn’t really a whole lot of “bright” warm colours in the game, there is still colour, but it feels dulled down. There’s also a lot of white in the game, which some people may think ‘pfft well that’s “bright”’ but to me it’s an empty kind of white. The whole game is set in ancient looking dull buildings with strange structures and dull empty colours. You’re on your own with no one around and no one to comfort you but these strange surroundings and sounds and noises that give it a little bit of a creepy twitch to it.

Personally, I liked this game. It definitely wasn't one of those games that I couldn't put down until I had finished it 100% full on in one sitting, but it was something I kept coming back to every now and then, taking breaks, until I finally completed it. It took me 15 or so hours to complete it spread over the course of two weeks or so, at times I just wanted it done because getting stuck is a real pain in this game and I felt pretty clueless. I even admit that at a few points I needed help to get past certain obstacles, but all in all I think this was a good game. I enjoyed it, it’s unique and interesting and you can tell the creator is really quite creative.

If you enjoy first person puzzle games, I would say it is something that should at least be tried. I can see how it might not be some people’s cup of tea, but I think it’s worth the experience.

Kairo is absolutely stellar. It is ominous, confusing, ethereal, gorgeous, and fascinating.

アドベンチャーゲームにもかかわらず、ストーリーや訴えたいものが非常にわかりにくく、それを類推するためのヒントが少ない上に、ファンタジーに現実的な要素が混ざっていることでゲームそれ自体で完結することは難しいです。プレイヤー自身による補完があっても変わらないかもしれません。私にはまったくわかりませんでした。

システム面では、視点移動時の画面揺れが激しく変更も出来ないため、上記の要素も相まってプレイして1時間で猛烈な吐き気を催しました。人生で初めてゲームで気持ち悪くなりました。3D酔いなどの経験がある方は注意が必要です。

ボリューム自体はそこまで大きくありませんが、パズル要素が若干難しい（ヒントが見つけにくい）ことによりプレイ時間は3～4時間程度、収集実績解除や隠し要素発見を目指すと4～5時間程度かかるでしょう。

It's rather minimalist in that 99% of the time there is zero HUD, and there are no ""use"" keys. The only way to interact with the world is, much like Proteus, by just being. Standing on switches and pads, moving against things, and walking around so that objects react to your very position relative to them will solve most of the puzzles in this game.

Kairo's puzzles are mostly (if not all) logical. They are, however, of the type where you will often walk into a room, have literally no idea of how the room works, leave, come back later, and solve it immediately upon walking back in. So goes Kairo. If you're ever completely and absolutely stumped, there are hints provided by the in-game menu (which unfold in a UHS-style increasingly-specific manner), though it should rarely come to that.

There is a story to Kairo. I am no fan of the obtuse ""insert your own ending/meaning/plot here"" plots that have become so commonplace in indie games these days, and I was initially under the impression that Kairo had followed suit. But I was embarrassingly wrong. There is, underneath it all, a highly interesting story that Kairo tells. It is told over the course of the game, and the elements which make it up stare you in the face wherever you go - though you do have to put the puzzle pieces together, yourself. While I myself had noticed all of these elements and even picked up on a hint or two of where they were leading me, I completely glazed over most of it and didn't connect anything that cried out for connection.

Do try not to make my mistake.

Kairo kombiniert jede Menge gute alte Rätsel (Labyrinthe, Enigmi, etc.) und funktioniert dabei ohne ein einziges Wort! Der Spieler erlebt alles aus der First-Person-Perspektive und ist wandert durch teils sehr verwirrende, sich stetig ändernde Welten, bestehend aus geometrischen Formen. Während des gesamten Spiels kommt sich der Spieler fehl am Platz vor; gar so, als ob er die feine Balance in den wie natürlich wirkenden Abläufen dieser Weltensysteme stören würde. Der wunderbar stimmige Soundtrack wechselt dabei zwischen klassischen Klängen und  irgendwie industriell klingenden Soundeffekten. Der einzige wirkliche Anker, den der Spieler bei der Entdeckung dieser riesigen Welt vorfindet, sind bekannte Bilder und Fotos (u.a. Albert Einstein, Go spielende Geishas, verwaiste Wüsten, etc.) Nach und nach, indem Rätsel gelöst werden, wird diese doch triste, meist in schlichten Farben und Beton gehaltene Welt wieder zum Leben erweckt. Kryptische Zeichen zeigen dem Spieler dabei den Weg. Hört sich verrückt an? Ist es! Manche Rätsel verlangen wirklich Hirnschmalz, andere bestehen wiederrum aus dem einfachen Erraten von Reihenfolgen. Eine Empfehlung für Rätselfreunde alle mal, genauso wie für kunstbegeisterte Architekten :D EInziges Manko: Ich würde mich über ein paar mehr Soundeffekte freuen. Zwar gibt es Sounds für fallenden Regen und Hall in größeren Räumen, elektrisches Knistern, etc. Fließendes Wasser hingegen, genau wie stehenden Wasser, durch welches durchgewatet wird, besitzen keine Sounds.
