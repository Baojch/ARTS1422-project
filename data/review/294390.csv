This game is dated. It doesn't run properly in full screen on my 4k monitor. In windowed mode its so small you can't see it, and in 'full screen' mode it only takes up a quarter of the screen, which was better than nothing. 

The voice acting in this hidden object adventure game was actually good, but like most early days hidden object adventure games, the quality of the hidden object scenes is severely lacking. Often its hard to make out what is even in the scenes. For its time it would have been pretty good.

The other downside, is the game was extremely short. I beat it in under 2 hours and that was with me being distracted for a bit. It is super short even for hidden object adventure games, where I can usually spend 3-4 hours in one.

Saying that the game took me a solid 90 minuntes to complete I'd say not really worth the $5 full price, 
(cause personally that would mean the game would need a solid 5 hours worth of entertaining gameplay within it)
but the price I payed ($1.24) is a little more along the lines of equal pricing for entertainment value.

Yes the game is a bit mono-tone with it's color pallet, but honestly what else are you going to do with a desert/mummy storyline? Not use sandy like colors?
Honestly when it comes to the color pallet I felt it fit perfectly, and made the game suck me in better.

I could live with the cutscenes being a tad more animated and less comic book like, but that's cause I'm so use to other games not having still images interact with each other and having it called a cutscene.

As for Storyline which has been said it's not entertaining enough to keep people's attention?
    ~ Yes it's slower than it should be to keep people's attention
    ~ Yes it feels like you're living the plot of Groundhog Day for the first half of the game.
    ~ Yes it's short
    ~ Yes it's a simple plot (Cat runs off, you get trapped in a Pyramid, you need to find your way out. Everything I just named you should know by 5-10 minutes into the game if that) but it's pretty cute reguardless.

The Hidden Object Scenes:
    ~ Are very mono-toned with the color pallet
    ~ Are somewhat repeative
But despite that I personally still enjoyed them


Over all, I recommend the game for the fact that it's simple enough to finish in a single afternoon so it's a really good ""lazy day"" game which in all honesty I play Hidden Object games when Im tired or too lazy to try to play something like a Puzzle Platformer xD

TLDR: Kiddish in tone. Low resolutions. Walk clicker hybrid. 3D glasses integration feels gimmicky, mostly just acting as a help menu. Walk Clicker puzzle easily bruteforced with limited items. 

Finished a chapter. The game changes things up on you fairly often. From using a unique item to see solutions to environment puzzles, to using one of three tools to clear obstacles, reconstructing items around a scene. The game probably has some sort of faint egyptian plot, probably related to the family cat. But the early plot hook is just chasing your cat who runs away, and then reinuniting the family that gets split in a cave in. It is rather mindless as often items can be nearly impossible to spot without using hints. WC puzzles with 3 items means its easy to rapidfire click each tool on each environment puzzle requiring tools as sometimes the game is not very intuitive on what it want (use a crowbar to clear pebbles from a crack instead of a shovel)

The game is fully playable without the 3D glasses which are optional which is a relief.

This game did not really do it for me. It is decent for the genre but the genre is highly saturated. Would rather skip to a higher quality title.",1510716147,1510716242,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Jeden by čekal, že na to, jak je hra plná magických prvků, amuletů a talismanů, onen proklatec se vás bude snažit zastavit, či sežrat v těch spletitých chodbách. Ale zas tak žhavé to není. Stresu či napětí to dozajista vyvolává méně, než klasická úniková hra ""dostaň se ven z dětského pokoje do hodiny"". Tohle celé spíše připomíná návštěvu fiktivního muzea s interaktivními prvky.

So take what I say with a huge grain of salt and maybe try it for yourself, if you get it cheap enough. (I.e. somewhere around 1-2 bucks.)

The graphics could be nice, but the resolution is too low, and I think it doesn't scale correctly for my monitor. So you might want to play in Window mode.

The idea of red/green glasses for 3D is nice, and as far as I can tell, they always ask you if you want to enable the 3D effect beforehand, so that's a plus.
It's not much to see, though, but that is more of an inherent problem with anaglyph 3D (and partially my eyes I think).

Interestingly, the depicted glasses apparently have the colors switched from what they write and use. Minor issue, but weird.

More troubling is the story itself, which at least at the very beginning isn't all that great. Who would complain ""All this over a cat"" when they're just about to enter a secret tunnel in an egyptian monument? Why not express wonder or at least fear?

Why does one of the characters apparently have glasses that can reveal hidden messages from the pharaos? Another gets an artifact that shows past times and doesn't express more than merely ""wow, this is cool, too bad my cat can't see this"" instead of at least telling the rest of the family about it, if only to shut down the obnoxious sibling bickering.

What had me stop, however, was that the SKIP button didn't work when I decided I wasn't going to follow the story and try to skip the rather boring cutscene.

That was, to use a fitting euphemism, the straw that broke the camels back.

It was also time for me to play it and to stop letting it rot my backlog.

Henry and Laura, with their two children Emily and Francis, are visiting their aunt Amy in Egypt. However, when Jynxie the cat escaped, the family finds itself trapped into a lost tomb, separated from each other and forced to find a way to reunite and bring together their findings to escape a deadly trap set by a Pharaoh that killed his own brother and cursed his memory.

Escape The Lost Kingdom: The Forgotten Pharaoh is a casual adventure game, with hidden objects scenes and puzzles. Each member of the family has a special item: Francis has googles with glyph visions, showing him areas of interests, Emily has the Time Amulet, showing her the previous state of a room, Laura is holding the key to many enigmas thanks to Amy's diary and Henry is carrying with him tools (hammer, shower and crowbar). Each chapter is seen through Francis, Emily and the parents first, before the kids finding themselves and exploring their areas. In the end, the family is reunited for the final push: they're each carrying items needed (staff, torn painting, etc..).

Indeed, some parts of the game can't be access unless you have Francis's Googles for example. Besides, each member is carrying items found in their part that will be useful at the end, when the inventories will fuse together. The puzzles are relatively easy, though you may need Amy's diary to find out clues. I had to resort to a walkthrough twice because I couldn't see what to do. And it wasn't because I didn't read Amy's diary. It was mainly because I couldn't understand well the meaning of the enigma.

Escape the Lost Kingdom is clearly set in an early era of the genre, though it was transitioning, as it's not hidden objects scenes set as main gameplay. But when you clear a location, it's shown. The map is also an indication of that and isn't interactive at all.

However, while the story is only about escaping and not about the Forgotten Pharaoh (everything is explained in the beginning  in other words and while you're expecting the main story to come back to that, apart one or two mentions by Emily, the Pharaoh is really forgotten), I would have expected a longer game. Even if you can choose who you'll play first when the whole family is splitted up (Emily, Henry and Laura, Francis), after that, the game is taking back the control: the kids will have to go through more trials than the parents as they found quickly the reunion point.

Besides, it's not the graphics that will reconcile people with hidden objects games as they're kinda giving the feel of being outdated. While I appreciated the drawned cutscenes, Francis seemed really an angry child and Henry very serious, where the girls are smiling. And given the scenario, it's sad that you don't have any change in their expression. I would have appreciated Emily's rolling her eyes when saying that she's a big girl now.

The soundtrack is nice, like the voice actings. That's why it's just sad that the emotions aren't matching.

The feature that showed me how old the game is (and it's not even so old) is the mention of 3D glasses use. You can play the game with it. As I don't know where my old glasses are (from the middle of the '90, mind you), I couldn't try it.

Anyway, should I recommend it? Yeah, even if I feel like the game is missing something: too short, not many use of the tools typical to each character, no real freedom of choice despite the beginning, what about the Forgotten Pharaoh and outdated graphics. But it's still an enjoyable moment to pass.

아주 어정쩡한 엔딩이 뜨면서(악당이 풀려났어요!!)

처음보고 배드엔딩이거나 아이템 다 못쓰고 깨서 게임 오버된줄 알았다...

엔딩시점에 남는 아이템의 사용처를 제시하지 못하는걸로 봐선 내가 제대로 깨긴 깬 모양인데..



이 게임의 문제를 주르륵 나열하자면.

1.짧은 플레이 타임. 

2회 클리어하는데 딱 2시간 걸렸습니다. 그것도 틀어놓고 30분은 자리비운거에요

2회차 클리어는 20분정도에 끊은듯


2. 적청 방식의 3D 글래스를 지원합니다.

네? 이게 왜 단점이냐구요? 동영상 인트로하고 초반의 몇몇 숨은 그림 찾기,

엔딩 동영상 이렇게 3D 글래스를 쓰면 입체감이 느껴지는 부분인데

게임 플레이중에는 3D 글래스 지원이 되지 않아서, 매번 뜹니다

안경 쓰세요,안경 벗으세요,안경 쓰세요,안경 벗으세요.....................어휴...


숨은 그림찾기도 3D 글래스가 지원이 되는데 그게 딱 초반 몇개까지만입니다

안경 쓰고 벗으란 이야기도 대충 그시점 지나면 아예 안나옵니다 

초반 지나면 3D안경 쓸 컨텐츠가 엔딩 동영상 밖에 없어요

그것도 개 어정쩡하면서 GAME OVER라는 글자가 크게 한가운데에 뜨는 그 뭐같은!!

이럴거면 넣질 말든가.



3.혈압 오르는 최적화

음악까지 끊어져버리니까 (다음장소에서 원래 멈췄던 음악이 이어서 재생되는걸보면...)

이야 이거 발로만들었구나. 하는 소리가 절로 나옵니다


4.어쩔수 없는 저화질

나온지 오래된 게임이라 그려려니 하지만

동시대 게임에 비해서 그림의 품질이 현저히 떨어집니다


5. 등장인물들의 무개념

부모,자,녀 4인가족이 나오는데

누나가 엔딩에서 악당이 풀려났어요 이러고 있으니까

동생이란 놈은 ""얘가 머리를 잘못 맞았나봐? 이상한 소리해요!""

아버지란 작자는 ""늬들 둘다 병원에 가봐야겠구나""

...식의 초딩스러운 대사와 상황이 작중에 철철 넘쳐 흐릅니다

물론 누나라는 작자도 정상인은 아니어서 이 모든 사건의 발단이 된 인물이구요

The music was great.

The voice acting was horrible.

uniqueness was amazing also seeing a story threw 3 views.

The actual written story told and played out was fucking stupid and its complete downfall.

Your a snob family and your kids are snobs. You live your life like a snob. Your eyes bleed of snob. You fucking snobs.
Horrifying acting and story written was fucking horrying. if it wasnt for the nice drawings and simple puzzles i would like to punch whoever thought this was cool in the face. but only so they could be like ouch dude why did you do that. and i could tell them, you known why... you know why...

The ending sucked the game was probably the shortest puzzles ever seeing its price at 5 bucks makes sense because the artists need to eat.

I would have rated the story higher even if the fucking story written was horrying and continued but no the story is to be continued and i would have been like awesome if there was a part 2 but there isnt and probably will never fucking be, as this game was written over 10 years ago and getting punched in the face for 10 years must really hurt and by then I would have changed my name and abandoned this idea for fear of face.

しかも今流行の立体視対応（要赤青メガネ）

エジプト・ピラミッド観光に来たアメリカンな４人家族が右往左往するようなそんなお話。

ゲーム（遺跡観光）開始時は家族一緒だったけれど、事故で４人が離れ離れになってしまう。
ここからが珍しいゲームスタイルで、「僕」「お姉ちゃん」「パパとママ」の３パートに分かれて話を進めていきます。
「僕」はアクション可能なオブジェクトを発見するゴーグル、「お姉ちゃん」は過去をのぞき見ることが出来るアミュレット、「パパ」は７つ道具ならぬスコップ、トンカチ、バールの３大日曜大工道具、「ママ」は（英語表記の為あまり役にたたない）ジャーナルを持っており、それぞれのキャラクター操作時に使うことが出来ます。
「ゴーグル」と「アミュレット」はいわゆるヒントみたいなもので、例えば扉を開ける為の鍵の組み合わせを、アミュレットを使って過去の（扉がいている状態）から見つけ出さなければいけません。逆に言うと、他のアイテム探しゲームにあるような、鍵の組み合わせを書いた紙切れなどそこらには落ちていません。
「ジャーナル」は何が書いてあるのかわかりません。読めばちゃんとしたヒントが書かれているのかもしれません。
そしてゲーム後半は、無事合流した４人が遺跡から脱出する話になります。

アイテム探しの他、パズル・ミニゲームの種類も豊富です。
ストアページ動画にあるシーンで、２つほどゲーム中に出てこないミニゲームがありました。遊んだのを忘れてしまったのか、ゲームの進め方によって展開に差が出るのかは不明です。
ゲーム中盤、「僕」「お姉ちゃん」「パパとママ」の３つの視点でゲームを進めていくのですが、各キャラのストーリーが終わるまで次のキャラクターに変更することは出来ません。アクション・パズルゲームにあるような、任意で操作キャラクターを変更出来、お互い強力しながら道を作っていくようなシーンはありませんでした。それがあったら、もっと面白く、難しくなったかもしれませんね。

日本語には対応していませんが、４人の会話シーンなど何を話しているのかなんとなく想像出来る感じです。

Now, this game does some things quite different. For example you have four protagonists. Two kids and their parents, from the story this migh look like a great deal - but, no it isn't. During the game you'll get diveded, you need all the equipment you got, more or less so. and each chapter has it's own ""challenges""... That's right, you read correctly.

Yaaaayyyyy *claps very slowly*

This said, I have to comment that the game is disappointing, and not so great at all. The hidden Object Scenes are, repetetive to say the least - they really have only a very limited variance. The sound is sometimes a bit ""crunchy"", no not in the way of roaches that get ground into pulp... just like, well... not good sampled. The story is the best of the mixture, but still not even up to par with most backstories of other HOGs, furthermore it's a bit too much stereotypes. Graphics, I had better HOG's recently with a lot more graphical and artistical finework. And the shortness of this painfull game is just a relief.

I can't recommend this game with keeping my conscience. This game is really a total waste of money, and time. I like games, even hidden object games - which often have more artsy characteristic than visual novells, but this game undid all my good spirits for the genre. I am afraid, that might happen to anybody who is playing this game. Given the points in Cons alone is enough to give the game a wide berth; but there is even more that is making it impossible for me to give it even a small piece of credibillity...

Gameplay wise it's nothing that hasn't been done before.  Find hidden objects, solve puzzles.  There was one particular ""bug"" in in which you couldn't assemble a puzzle but thankfully the ""skip"" button allows one to bypass it.  Also, there are quite a few items in the game which wound up becoming a ""find the pixel"" click as clicking on the outer parts of the item would not trigger but clicking closer to the center did.

Voice acting wise, it was par for the genre.  Good enough emotions/intonations but nothing that stands out.

Story-wise, the game felt short, likely due to it being the non-collector's edition and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth due to the family's reaction to Emily (won't spoil why) and the fact playing the non-CE version left me wanting more.

None of the seek and finds are very challenging, neither are any of the 'puzzles' and I was pretty much bored all the time but I was a bit curious about the plot with the daughter.
So I get to the end, I get all the items and clear everything out, I get this item called the 'Staff of Time,' and I thought it was important, but I finished the final 'puzzle' and I got a limp cutscene and a black screen with 'Game Over' on it.

I never used the staff, so I figured that hey, maybe I got an alternate ending. Since my safe starts me at the final cutscene I have to make a new file and play through all over again. Again, not HARD, but annoying. But I get to the end and go through all the rooms trying to find the thing to use the Staff of Time on, but I found nothing, so I decided to look up (I use guides sometimes, I don't feel ashamed about it) and I find this whole list of rooms that weren't on the in-game map. I try to get there in the game itself but I couldn't get in there. Also, there's no alternate ending, there's no closure to the whole plotline with the daughter, it just STOPS.

I enjoyed the puzzles and HO scenes very much.  The music and voice acting was decent.

However, there are two distinct strikes against this game.  The first is that it is EXTREMELY short even by HO standards; I clocked in at barely above an hour.  At the time of review, I have 1.4 hours on record and probably a full third of that time was actually me fighting with my display (note that if you have a 4k monitor, you may need to disable display scaling in order to have fullscreen cover the whole screen).

The other issue is that the plot falls flat on its face, with an abrupt ending that leaves the game wide open for sequels that I don't believe ever were made.  So essentially it was dissatisfying to finish and not feel like you're actually finished.  That said, the plot was formulaic enough that you can essentially fill in the blanks in your head and call it good.

So that said, it's barely squeaking by with a recommendation based solely on my enjoyment of the individual puzzles and not on the overall plot or playtime.  It is NOT worth full price with the short length of the game (barely a third of the length of other standard HO games).

It is on the lower side of average overall. The puzzles and HO scenes are fairly decent, though easy, the voice acting isn't terrible and the extra elements of using magic items and tools is a nice touch.

It's way too short however. Which might have been fine if the story was completed by the time the game was over, but no. It starts out with a cutscene showing an epic battle between two ancient pharaohs and speaks about how the murdered one waits in his tomb for the right people. The game itself is about a family of four who gets lost in the temple raised for this pharaoh and about how they escape. That's it. No continuation of the starting cutscene, only a 'Game Over' slide (""huh? really, did I just lose the game?"") that feels like a 'To Be Continued' that just never continues. There is no sequel. 

You play a family who gets separated in an ancient temple and have to find a way to get back together and out of the temple. 

For some strange reason this game has scenes that can be used with redblue 3d glasses for 3d effect. I did not try this, and I really don't see the point.

There is a lot of backtracking and iirc no map that you can use for teleporting. Be aware that quite a few of the puzzles in the video on steam is not in the game, but most probably in the collectors edition that has more playtime which is not available on steam.

[b]PROS:[/b]
[list]
[*]Smooth Gameplay
[*]Lots of objects to find and collect
[*]The game tells you when a room is ""clear"" so you don't have to go back like crazy trying to figure out where you missed something
[*]Nice aspect of dividing the 4 characters in the story, and playing from different perspectives with them (they also have different skills)
[*]Nice artwork
[*]Good voice acting
[*]Well done in the details, such as not being able to come back to a spot that no longer contains items, closing screens automatically when you find all the items on them, help system in case you get stuck, etc.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b]
[list]
[*]Image is not very sharp in fullscreen. It's not bad, it just could be better.
[*]There's a Game Over message when you win. Game Design lesson 1: Just... don't do that. ever.
[*]Steam screenshot does not work in this game
[*]Map doesn't help much - sometimes I go to my left and the map show that I went to my right. And the map treats multiple rooms / locations as one, so I go to another room but stay in the same room on the map. Horrible to find my way around.
[*]Having only one illustration per character makes them always appear neutral / smiling / calm in the cutscenes, even if the voice acting shows otherwise.
[*]The ending felt kinda rushed to me, specially because after it you just go back to the menu, there's no status or completion screen showing your time or other things... The game was nice but the ending felt like one of those free, flash -based games.
[*]If you skip the last cutscene, the Game Over message appears immediately, way before the cutscene fades, making it look like something went horribly wrong. Yes, I am mentioning the Game Over screen once again. It really pisses me off.
[*]There are at least 3 puzzles shown in the store page video that I didn't see in the actual gameplay, and I think I didn't miss anything because there's nothing skippable in the game, it seems.

I recommend this game for those that enjoy hidden object games and a feeling of Indiana Jones adventure.

I find it really unfortunate I can't in good conscience recommend this game. Visually, it's quite a nice looking low res. casual game, it's fully voiced, and even has a decent adventure/hidden object mix. And it's about one of my favorite subjects, ancient Egypt, to boot.

Why can't I recommend it then?

Easy. The ending chapter isn't included. Apparently it was part of a Collector's Edition not available on Steam. Normally that's not much of a problem, but the store page here clearly shows content nowhere to be found in this game, and the main story introduced in the opening cutscene is hardly even referenced again, let alone fleshed out and wrapped up. At first I thought I somehow missed something despite all of the map's rooms stating they were cleared. The only way I was able to figure out where these missing scenes were was to search on Google, which I find very sloppy to have not been at least mentioned on the page. It doesn't help the non-CE ending is a sudden, out-of-nowhere black screen with a simple white lettered ""Game Over."" No credit roll. No feeling it actually ended and you hadn't somehow managed to screw up a hidden object game. Very disappointing, especially since the rest the of the game is pretty great for the genre, despite its short length (1.5 hours, not rushed, listening to all the dialogue and enjoying the scenes) and a few quirks.

Pros:
-Nice, but low resolution artwork
-Pretty good atmosphere for a casual title
-Fully voiced
-Gameplay is a nice mix of adventure and hidden object, complete with standard hidden object search areas and a full inventory you carry room-to-room
-Potentially had/has (perhaps in the Collector's Edition) an interesting brother versus brother story, quite fitting for an Egyptian setting considering the importance of Osiris and Set (two gods who were also feuding brothers) in their mythology

Cons:
-Not the Collector's Edition and is missing content displayed on the store page
-An hour and a half long
-The main and most intriguing story is ignored after the opening cutscene, with sparse and minimal exceptions in the form of other characters vaguely mentioning a second, forgotten pharaoh 
-Few quirks, particularly in dialogue, such as misaligned text and oddly shifting the spelling of the name of and gender of the cat

For its current sale price of $1.25, sure, go for it. Full price? Probably not. You won't even realize you successfully completed the game and will be left wondering where some of the awesome looking store page scenes are.

I honestly wish there was a neutral button on Steam, as I wouldn't necessarily say, ""Avoid this."" Rather, be aware of how oddly it ends before you get there, and be aware some particularly interesting bits (the video shows you playing Senet, for example) are not included in this edition.

Still, solid 3/5 for gameplay and the partial story it includes, plus the intelligent, interesting use of objects in scenes (and finding objects you'll actually need) and inclusion of some real ancient Egyptian mythology. It would've been an easy 4/5 (for the genre) if the non-CE ending wasn't so abrupt, and the store page only showed content actually in the game.",1400038925,1400045834,False,100,1,0.897657215595245361,0,True,False,False,False,,,
