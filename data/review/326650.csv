TLDR: Mobile grade with identical assets everywhere making things very disorienting. No map. Cannot customize party. Mostly empty and featureless.

Of course I could recommend Vaporum and the Grimrocks but I thought I would drop a few less mentionned dungeoncrawler alternatives just to vary things up this time around. While others have flaws as well, at least they have worlds, recognizable areas and advanced party management mechanics.

vor ca. 5 Jahren hat Legend of Grimrock (LoG) das Dungeon Crawler Genre wiederbelebt.
Doch an den größeren Erfolg von LoG 1 konnte LoG 2 leider nicht mehr anknüpfen und
so Ende die Geschichte von LoG und das Dungeon Crawler Genre ist wieder an den
Rande der Bedeutungslosigkeit gerutscht.

Für die jenigen, die allerdings mit LoG Blut geleckt haben, gibt es nurnoch 2 Lösungen.
Man weicht auf die 25 Jahre alten Dungeon Crawler aus, wie Dungeon Master,
Eye of the Beholder oder Lands of Lore. Die andere Möglichkeit wäre einer der moderneren
Dungeon Crawler, welche im Rahmen der kurzzeitigen Wiederbelebung des Genres
durch LoG entstanden sind. Wer einiges Zeit mit suchen verbringt, um diese kaum 
beachteten Titel zu finden, der wird auf Spiele wie Dungeon Kingdom: Sign of the Moon,
Heroes of the Monkey Tavern, Coldfire Keep, Ruzar: the Life Stone, Mines of Grimvale,
The Deep Path: Labyrinths of Andokast oder Heroes of a broken Land stoßen. Viele dieser
Spiele sind von Ein-Mann-Teams entwickelt worden und hier reiht sich auch
The Legend of Candlewind: Nights & Candles ein (LoC).

Im Vergleich zu den obengenannten Spielen reiht sich LoC allerdings bis unten ein.
Man kann es bedenkenlos als den schlechtesten Dungeon Crawler bezeichnen,
sogar schlechter als Grimoire: Heralds of the winged Examplar.

Warum ist LoC so schlecht? In kurzen Stichpunkten:
- 10 Euro für 2 Stunden Spielzeit ohne nennenswerten Wiederspielwert
- Keine Charaktererschaffung oder -auswahl
- Keine Optionen außer Sprache Deutsch/Englisch
- Kein Handbuch
- Nur 1 Wandtile für alle 10 Level, ja ich meine Tile nicht Tileset!
- Nur 5 Dungeonelemente (Tür, Truhe, Treppe, Eiszone und Illusionswand)
- Keine Rätsel (Keine Schlüssel, Schalter oder so weiter)
- Keine Mini/Automap
- Musik läuft nur ein einziges Mal und auch nur im ersten Level,
   danach ist toten Stille. Es gibt auch keine Laufgeräusche
- Bugs (allerdings keine Abstürze/keine Gamebreaking)
- Imbalanced (erst schwer aber nach notwendigen Grinding im 2. Level
   dann zu einfach)
- Kaum besonderer Loot (Waffen/Rüstungen/Schmuck)
- Primitive Ausrüstung: Waffen erhöhen nur Angriffskraft (Dolch = 3 AK,
   Axt = 4 AK, Schwert = 5 AK) Schmuck und Rüstung erhöhen nur
  die Rüstungsklasse, wie bei den Waffen.
- Bei Levelup der Charaktere keine Möglichkeit Attributspunkte zu verteilen
   oder neue Zauber zu erlernen (allgemein gibt es keine neuen Zauber im Spiel)
- Simple Kämpfe ohne nennenswerte Taktik und ohne Loot bei Kampfende
- Eine Story ist praktisch nicht vorhanden

And now I am forced to play this game through thoroughly, because it has achievements and I have a strong dislike of letting games rest with only a couple of Achievements done.

Basically a Dungeon Crawler, if you need to compare this game to other dungeon crawlers, give it a light denomer... Sadly this game also has it's own issues with a clunky user interface. Also this game suffers somehow from the ""endless Clones of Schwarzenegger""-disease somehow. All portraits of the ""Heroes"" look so damn like Arnie in his younger years.

[tr][td]Graphics[/td][td]7[/td][td]Okay Graphics, a bit too muddy and sloppy. But still good enough.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Sound[/td][td]6[/td][td]Average, they at least made some original stuff and didn't just change the sound of other games to have their ""own"" soundtrack.[/td][/tr]

[tr][td]Roleplay[/td][td]3[/td][td]At least this game gives you a bit more freedom, but the rest is more or less... nonexistent. At least no bad, forced humor dialogues and no wall of text to beat you up.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Resource Management[/td][td]6[/td][td]Hefty! You have to manage torches, food, potions and arrows... and some resources are really incredibly rare (torches)... fumbling around in the dark never is a good idea. Also Mob-Groups can put a drain on your resources, since they attack one after the other - and you are not able to break out of a fight.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Playability[/td][td]4[/td][td]Clunky to say it in the most friendly form. Some actions require additional steps, like splitting stacks, others are easier to understand but still require an additional step. This isn't well designed and needs to be addressed. If you force the player to do additional steps, you frustrate him. It's not that the game is unplayable because of this, but the manual is too silent about the exact steps. You can break open chest, given you are of high enough power... doors sometime need keys, as well as chest. There is a workaround to the later.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Value[/td][td]2[/td][td]The game doesn't appear to be too big. Also it's a bit of a pain to play because of the clunky playability, which can lead to frustration. Also you need to grind, because some challenges can't be solved at the face level of the party... so you will grind a lot, which also makes the game as a crawler a bit unfun.[/td][/tr]

[h1]Not Recommended[/h1]

It is quite simple, the game has some merrits, but too many flaws in the sense of clunkyness. It just doesn't play fluidly, therefore the fun in this game is spoiled very quickly. Especially that the exact way of using things in this game isn't well described in the manual is one of the biggest flaws. The additional required steps just worsen the feeling about this game. And really? Why do almost all portraits look like Arnie mockups?

The time the developers needed to polish out those basic flaws in design and gameplay wouldn't have taken too long. The game would have been a bit easier to understand, and would have gotten a bit more love from the players. Also it's somehow lacking the riddles and insidious traps that were genre specific in those games.",1508692234,1508692607,False,7,0,0.569189965724945068,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I strongly recommend you not to buy the game for full price of 9,99€ You will be jus wasting your money. Wait for a bundle of sime kind where you can get it for few cents. And this is completely reasonable price for it.

The game itself seems unfinished. Well, you can actually finish it, but mechanics are just terrible. There is no Options in game menu, only thing you will find there is: New adventure, Load, Credits and Save. 
Forget about reasonable intro - only one page with cliche story apperas. Yeah, and forget about customizing your party. You are trown to a dungeon immidiately, left to struggle by equiping your party. 
I do have problem with that - I've palyed tuns of grid-base RPGs but those usually came with manual of some kind, where some basics are explained. This manual is a Joke. Few pictures hot to actually do stuff would be nice.

The only usable keys are arrow keys - forget about WSAD. You can't select hero by number keys, what I find normal in grid-based crawlers. Forget about triggering game menu by ESC. You have to punish your mouse with thousands of meaningles cliks.

It took me about 20 minutes to figure out, how to use bow in combat and since I've checked, other gamers had the very same problem. Is that a problem to write it to the manual? Or maybe use some intuitive technique how to do it?

And what's the matter with the doors? Again, same situation like with the bow (yeah bow, I didn't find any other during the run). Why tere are keyholes? Why on Earth, is there a possibiliy to interact with the keyhole? [spoiler] You can walk just through it.[/spoiler]

Why there isn't a loot from creatures? I don't find it that important, but it seems to me, thet those keyholes were projected to be used by keys. Maybe keys from some loot? It gives me an impression, that designer were lazy at some point to finish this idea.

What about some story? Again, I've played few games without one, but at least it was compesated by game mechanics - puzzles of sime king, different textures on the wall, interaction with NPCs, animation of monsters (and also groups of monsters) or animation of swings during the fight. And again, I have this feeling that at some point designers just resignated to spend more time on the development of the game.

Fights are somehow boring, because monsters either kick your donkey badly or you wipe them by two swings. And why? Because you have to literally grind them in the dark corners od dungeons. Otherwise you will get punished badly. This means, you have spent from 10-30 minutes pushing a button: Wait for monster. And it will come! Ant than other, and than other.... So after few hundrets of creeps you are ready to continue you epic journey. And be prepared for encounters. Monsters will appear from nowhere, leaving no loot after killing. Your party will suffer from hunger - but you can feed them bread and apples you will find, or cast a spell thet feed your entire party. And here comes the troube.

You can't rest/sleep in Candlewind. Therefore do not count with mana regeneration. I find it acceptable, but in connection of random encounters of monsters, you can easily run into a situation, were you will be out of health, mana, you party will be starving and there is nothing, you can do about it. You just lost. There are no hints, how many treasure chest you will find, so you can't plan mana consumption. Yeah, and a lootfrom chest is random...
Do you need potion of some kind? Forget about it.

I've run across one glitch, when group of monsters was floating in the air, unable to attack me. I was lucky, that i had enough arrows to shoot them down. Ohterwise it would call for alt +f4, because you cant bring up menu during fight. And you cant even open your inventory during hte fight. Run out of mana? Sorry, just wait till a monster will crush all the weak party members.

Last thing. [spoiler]5th and 6th party member are completely pointles. Only first two heroes can attack by their swords/daggers. All other members have to wait till the end of a fight. Just a magic book can be used and a bow (yeah the 1 vow you have from the very beggining). And a funny thing - as soon I've rescued them, both of theme were dead. But I have interacted with them right before. Creepy, right?[/spoiler]

And to be fair - there are few thing I liked: The song (yeah, there is no other one), textures on walls, creatures (just animate them!) and the portrait of hero (again the, because it is for the whole party with some slight modifications). 

Candlewind is game you should avoid. There are some glitches, mechanics are terrible, dungeons are somehow ""empty"" and I have an impression, that developers just did a sloppy job of finishing it. Personally, I'll avoid any other game creathed by them.

TLDR tips and spoilers:
[spoiler]
- You can use a bow only if you split arrows and put one in your hand.
- Most of the doors are open - just press the forward key
- You will regenerat mana when you level up - be prepard for that. Feed our party before you lup
- Open locked chest by a spell. You can reload a game, if you are not satisfied
- Take everything you need. Inventory is big enough.
- Don't read manual. It's pointless.

Сюжет, как таковой, в игре отсутствует. Нам предложат пройти 10 однообразных уровней командой из 4(впоследствии 6) человек. Классы изначально предопределены: маг, лучник, воин. Весь смысл игры заключается в бесконечном фарме монстров ради опыта и сундуков ради лута. Баланс в игре своеобразный. Если вы докачались до 3-4 уровня - ваши персонажи уверенно перестанут промахиваться, и у вас появится шанс завершить кампанию. Не порадует и большое разнообразие сопреников: в игре их не более дюжины, встречаются либо одиночными особями, либо группами из 4-5 врагов. 

Однако в игре все же присутствует атмосфера ""бродилки по подземелью"", и немного веет от нее Гримроковскими скитаниями, может из-за мрачных красок, может из-за традиционного вида от первого лица. Не хватило тут ловушек, разнообразия юнитов, своей истории, и она смогла бы передвинутся на ступеньку ближе к трону приведенной для сравнения легенды.

There will be a few hurdles to overcome to even start to like this game, such as if you just explore the dungeon and kill what you meet you will arrive at a goblin shaman still level 1 and get wiped out. So you have to know to grind to level 2 on wandering monsters to actually progress, and this happens in a few places - there isn't really hard fights in this game, you either win easily or get wiped out, and there is no flee function if you do get in over your head, so save often would be the advice to any but the purist. 

Your adventurers are provided to you rather than generated yourself, which normally indicates the predefined characters will have well developed fixed characters/roles which will come out during the game, and thus requiring the player not have flexibility. None of your characters ever speak to each other, only a few interactions with NPCs during special events. The only real advantage then is it means it is faster to get into the game, as in, you start immediately in the dungeon with a formed and equipped party after a one page wall of text intro. You do have a bit of flexibility in that some of your characters start off multiclassed (mage/thief etc.), although once you level up once or twice that option seems to disappear and your choice becomes permanent.

This attempt to throw you in at the start without any need for setting up doesn't work very well though, as your party is very ill equipped to go adventuring - you are short on torches to light the way, food to eat, potions to heal up/recover mana (only out of combat as you have no inventory access any time monsters are about), etc. Your main fighter has no weapon and starts off attacking monsters with his bare fists unless your archer/mage gives him her dagger. One character has a shield they have left in a backpack while having a hand free to use it.

The UI is idiosyncratic, you have to nock a first arrow in order to use a bow, which requires splitting a stack to get one and putting it in your offhand. Casting a spell requires dragging upwards from the spell icon. Locked doors tell you they need a key, but in fact the only thing that opens them is the unlock spell, you will never find a key in this dungeon. Changing the marching order requires you to right click one character, then left click the other you want to swap. Unless you immediately go to find a quide of how to play (there is one good guide here on steam that should cover it) you are likely to spend a lot of time being frustrated as the game doesn't help you at all.

Then you have the last and main problem - as noted it has a core of an okay retro-CRPG game. But that is it, it is very bare bones, there aren't any different looking levels, there aren't any puzzles, there are a few NPC encounters through the game but they are very basic text (not even a graphic of the NPC!) with a yes/no option of whether to give them gold/torches/healing potions in exchange for healing/xp (and a couple of achievements). The combat is one dimensional, nearly all mobs are just basic melee with more or less hp/damage. The only exception I can think of is the goblin shaman who curses you (not sure what this does, sometimes I did entire levels with it before casting the cure and it didn't make any obvious difference). There is no story development or plot, you have no choices to make when your characters level up, you have no NPCs/neutrals you can either fight or help for different risks/rewards.

So there is very little here to recommend it to the vast majority of people. However I did like it a bit myself, as it was a puzzle to be solved of how to actually progress in the game, and given the current £1 price tag for an evenings entertainment for me it was worth it, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people hence the ""No"" below.",1451579599,1451579599,False,28,1,0.776673436164855957,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Non-intuitive controls. For example, I wasted so much time trying to get the archer to fire an arrow because it wasn't obvious that equipping arrows on the archer requires the player to SPLIT the arrows and use it on the bow - merely using the arrows on the bow without splitting does nothing. I don't even know why the game didn't pre-equip them for me, since the archer can't even melee from the back of the party anyway.

Usually if a game trailer only shows inanimate screenshots of the game, it should be warning enough. However, I am a huge Turnbased Dungeon Crawler fan since the first Wizardries and Might&Magics, so I ignored the signs and gave it a shot. Unfortunately this game is incredibly weak. 
DISCLAIMER: I only played a bit more than two hours, but judging by everything I witnessed, I can't expect the game would get any better if I continued playing. However, take everything I say with a grain of salt.

[i][b]Let's begin with the good stuff (And even the pros come with tradeoffs).[/b][/i]
[list][*]The opening theme is nice. Too bad you will hear it only once when you start the game. When it stops, there won't be any music unless you restart the game client.
[*]The artdirection COULD be nice if the dev's hadn't decided to make every character look exactly the same and paint everything - Walls, floors, HUD, menu - in the same ugly muddy brown-green.
[*]The game might have an interesting aspect of resource management: You can't go to the city to stock up on resources, you can't rest, random encounters don't drop stuff, so you have to manage torches, food, hitpoints and spellpoints carefully.
[/list]
[b][i]And now the bad stuff. I don't even know where to start[/i][/b]
[list][*]The story is delivered in textboxes and ultra-lazy. Some mischievous rogues are doing mischief and you take a band of adventurous adventurers to their hideout.
[*]Even I, as a non-native english speaker notice how shaky the english translation is.
[*]No character creation, although that's not even such a big issue in the context of this game because...
[*]...the character progression system is a joke. Each character has 6 standard attributes and 3 skills. They level up automatically. You can cast spells if your character posesses a spell book.  I have played shitty diablo flashgame clones that were more sophisticated.
[*]The interface is incredibly clunky. You can move the party with the arrow keys, everything else is mouse driven. And in such an abyssmal way: To load your bow with an arrow, you have to do five specific mouseclicks. And they are not documented, you have to figure it out by yourself.
[*]combat is boring. Enemies appear usually in 3 tiles distance. Since your bow NEVER(really!!) hits outside of close combat, you click 3 times on end turn, then they're in melee range. There your frontliners can attack and your backliners can cast/shoot. No special abilities here.
[*]You could cast spells on enemies in the distance, they sometimes even hit. The fireball animation for example looks like you throw a tennis ball at your little doggie, and it roughly has the same impact. The good news: This is the only horrible animation in the game. The bad news: This is the only animation in the game.
[*]Who came up with the incredibly stupid Idea to make a turnbased game, but tie the duration of torches to real-time?
[*]The dungeon looks painfully dull. There is one single texture for the walls, and one for the floor, which also is used for the ceiling. Everywhere. Only exception: Doors that lead to empty rooms and staircases that lead to another level that looks exactly the same. Needless to say, there is nothing to explore and nothing interesting to find.
[*]There seems to be only one type of encounter per floor (Which you can conveniently trigger anytime with the ""Wait for monster"" Button). On the first floor, it is a solitary goblin, which is killed quickly but also can hit hard. On the second floor its three goblins and one shaman which will inevitably tear any level 1 characters a new one. So you HAVE to grind levels on the first floor. Now consider this: A goblin yields 20Xp per character. A character needs 1000Xp for level 2. Basic math: You need to kill 50 goblins first. And better do it quick, because torches and real-time, remember?
[/list]
[i]Bugs. Actually, I'm not sure whether I encountered bugs or strange design decisions. These ones seem to be the former:[/i]
[list][*]If an enemy kills a frontliner, you have to assign a backliner for the first row. By doing this, it often happens that your complete party skips their turn and the enemy attacks again, possibly insta-gibs the backliner you just sent forward, making you skip another turn.
[*]When a character gets slain, his portrait gets replaced by a skull. If you give him a revive potion later, the skull stays. Considering the quality of the portraits I advocate against fixing this bug.
[*]Not a bug but a technical issue. The game forces 1600x900 fullscreen. If your resolution is lower it scales down, but if it is higher, it stays 1600x900 borderless window and you can't move or resize it.
[/list]
[b][i]The Verdict[/i][/b]
I am sorry. But this game is beyond redemption. The best explanation I can come up with is that it is a lazy cashgrab attempt on the Legend of Grimrock bandwagon. The game has nothing going for it, not even any entertaining values that could make up for a Let's play. 
Furthermore this doesn't isn't a project that can be fixed with a few updates. The devs seem to have already taken lots of wrong turns early in the development process and you can't fix bad design from the git-go with a few patches.
Stay away!

The game wanna emulate great games like Legend of Grimrock or similar.. but it fails for everything.
-An RPG in which there is not absolutely any kind of character creation or opportunity to custom them.
-The plot are exactly ten line of text
-After these ten line of text you begin to play in a dungeon.. Withouth knowing anything.. You dont know who are two of the four party members and dont know how to play at all.. To equip an item you have to left mouse botton and go on ""use"" and then drag it on the hand of the character; and if you own many objects of the same kind (like torches) you need to split them before being able to use them.
-This ""game"" is just a set of images put togther without sense.. And without ANY kinf of animation..Really nothing! Monsters are seems made of paper
-About monsters..they are almost only goblin/orcs.. and when you spot them it will take 3/4 turns before they reach you. Paralytic goblins of paper. But if you try to hit them with a bow you ll always miss them.. And you can use just few spells before being withou mana.. So you simply sit and wait for that paralytic goblin to come. Oh yes...one morething about ""combats"" : enemies will face you one by one.. fat paralytic goblins that cant you two or more at the same time in the tunnel
-Everyrhing is a problem in this game... Even the doors: I resisted 20 minutes in this game just to understant how they work. You arrive in front of a door and you see a very big lock..you click on it and the game says to you ""this door works with this lock"" or something similar.. So you spend minutes and minutes to go around all the level for the keys.. But the frustration is the solution: I didnt know if I should crash a book on the screen of my pc, but I just decided to crash the bad face of my character on the door and...I passed!! The solution was walking forward like the door didnt exist! You dont need to open it and when you pass there is no animation.. So why put a door?? I wont say anything more.

Please, dont waste money on this.
Try some free to play or real games, but not this.

i would rather see these games cleaned up and re-skinned than play this!

its painfull.

painfully slow, painfull cluncky interface, painfull animations, painfull lack of sound effects, painfull NPC interactions......
the list goes on.

theres no leveling system to speak of, no real spell progression, no real tatics apart from wait till enemys in melee range and THEN use the bow.
seriously, the bow, a ranged weapon, cant hit F all till they swinging at your front line.
spells used are, unlock as theres no lockpicking (that ive found) and light (better than using a hand for a torch that could use a shield) and heal.
theres no point in off magic as again the enemy is already in melee range by the time it will hit.

theres no wonder the video on the store page dont show gameplay as theres really nothing to hook you at all.
even dungeon master (80s game) had monster animations, different weapons, more spells, player customizations.

infact i may dust off my DoSbox and fire dungeon master back up at this woefull attempt ive just played.",1423825025,1423838933,False,43,2,0.657298803329467773,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Not hotkeys for anything, hope you enjoy clicking the mouse alot.
-Premade party with no customization whatsoever, including when you level.
-No challenge whatsoever, once you understand what you're supposed to be doing.
-Manual explains absolutely nothing.
-There are about 20 spells in the game, but i only used 3 as all the others were pointless.
-Finished the game with much the same equipment i started it with. There's very little loot to be had, as the treasure chests contain mostly food, potions, torches, and arrows.
-Food, potions, torches, and arrows are utterly useless. There's magic to fill your hunger bar, you level, and fill your health/mana bars way before you need potions, theres a light spell that lasts longer than torches, and theres no point in having an archer as you pretty much always miss, and you pretty much need 2 melee in front and 2 healers in the back.
-The only point of allowing other characters to join you (i only found 1) is so you can transfer their equipment to your main characters, and then they drain your XP gain slightly and you can't get rid of them (unless you allow them to get killed off, which i hadn't thought of at the time).

My party survived for almost fifteen minutes! 

Let's face it half an hour of gameplay isn't really enough to give a 'review'. In terms of first impressions though I quite liked the artwork of the characters and enemies, I was underwhelmed by the combat animations, I found the wall textures to be troublesome for navigation and really didn't like the lack of in-game tutorial. I found myself fairly ambivalent towards the music. 

The game feels a little too 'indie' for my liking though and while I am a fan of this genre I am not sure it has the polish I'd expect of a finished product and I cannot recommend this game.

It would do itself a great service if it had an in-game turtorial. Maybe a simple splash screen with some pointers?  Hell I'd settle for a more verbose manual!  As it is though even if you were to RTFM you're still left to intuit a fair amount of the control system.

TL;DR: Lazy sod. How about a video instead? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcx4Aw1XHNM

Unfortunately, all the differences are massive negatives. First up is the fact that you cannot create your own characters...in an RPG. What you see is what you get... but you had better look fast as the torches are on a timer.... a real time timer... in a turn based game. The interface is incredibly clunky and unwieldy. 

The ingame graphics are not bad for this type of game it has to be said but it really is the only positive i can come up with. Monsters attack one at a time... no mobs allowed. Oh and they are also bizarrely proud of their 'Grind' button otherwise known as 'wait for monsters'. Also you cannot use items in combat or change weapons. Ranged weapons are completely useless.

So its quite pretty but shallow, slow, empty and lacking in character, options and intelligence. AVOID
