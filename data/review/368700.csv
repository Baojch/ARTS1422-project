Or maybe downloaded off of Jumbo Games or the like. It's the kind of game you sit down to play for an hour. Then come back the next day and play again. It's got that subtle addictive quality. It's a very good blend of easy, approachable, and challenging. Almost feels like an obscure game Apogee might have made back in the day. Every time I've played it I've experienced new enemies, upgrades, and obstacles.

I love that I can collect items to unlock new ships, and these ships recieve completely different effects from the artifact/potion pickups. Each ship is a totally different game.

My only complaint is that in the very late levels I keep dying from being rammed, despite whatever collision damage reducing modifiers I've equipped. Even in the speediest ship, which I transitioned to by a chance powerup, later levels feature so many spawning enemies intent on ramming you that it presents a huge challenge. But of course, this a rogue-like, and daunting challenge is to be expected.

Still, I wish there was a cloaking device with a timed cooldown cycle that when activated would prevent me from picking up anything or firing, but would hide me from the enemies. This would allow me to better tip toe around the later levels and cloak & heal when resistance gets too tough. Ballancing this, most upgrades are only found by shooting enemies, and some fuel has to be obtained from mini boss battles. For all I know this upgrade is already in the game and I haven't found it yet, that's how much neat upgrade loot is in this game.

Great music. I love it. It's a bit of a mix of the old school chiptune vibe with a twist of the contemporary. 

It doesn't have the option to rebind keys but the default is a fairly common WASD setup. The native xbox controller support works like a charm and it makes use of the analogue sticks with progressive flight controls(push it a little to fly slowly, push it a lot to fly fast) so I would say a controller is the way forward.

If you've played a roguelike before you'll be familiar with the ?? pick ups. Instead of potions and scrolls you get alien artifacts and alien technology. They come in usual buff and debuff flavours but are all themed to fit into the world. Blindness/confusion potion becomes a Sensor Disrupting artifact etc. After you've use a ?? mystery pick up once, it's identified and the next time you get it, you'll know when to use it or if you just want to jettison it right away.

There's no XP system but there is equipment to loot, which is all procedurally generated a la Borderlands, which is great. I found a couple of different shields, one had a higher total capacity but slower regeneration, a low capacity shield with very fast regen and I found a few ship accessories. One boosted fire rate at the cost of shield regen and the other allowed me to regenerate armour.

The other way your ship progresses is through upgrade parts. They are like skill points you can find and then you can choose to add another weapon slot, the only gun I found on my run boosted my front fire rate a fair bit but also had a rear fire which was great or  you can increase your hull/cargo capacity and thrusters.

The ""overworld"" isn't too dissimilar to the FTL star chart. You move from left to right and you can branch off now and then taking a longer route to the goal to go hunting for loot and upgrades. While you are in the overworld aka space you can identify your mystery parts and potions.. I mean artifacts and you use your upgrade parts. The UI is simple but effective and very easy to work with. 

When you are done messing around in space you pick the planet on the star map and get down to business. I think I seen 4 different kinds of planet. Desolate, Ice, Forest and Water. There are some cool environmental effects like a Sandstorm type deal that blows in from the left or right and slows or speeds you up depending on which direction you are going. On the Ice planet I noticed a nice little fogging/frosting effect at the edges of the screen, while on the jungle planet I think I was attacked by some sort of space locusts.

It's really not as punishing as most games with roguelike elements. I was reduced to zero Hull(that's after 0 shield and 0 armour) a few times and was allowed to carry on but my equipment degraded. Shields regenerated at half speed, my gun lost x amount of power. So while you pay a bit of a price, there is enough loot that at least a placeholder item wont be far away. You can save and quit anytime, too. That's always good.

Anyway, this is just supposed to be a bit of a rambling first impression seeing as there were no reviews at all when I got it. So far I really like it. I should add that the little writing I got to experience was well done.
