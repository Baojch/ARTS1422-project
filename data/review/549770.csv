I 100% it, and... I'm stunned. I don't think I've ever been so confused by a games themes here. And not because the writing is bad, or unclear, or obtuse. It's not, really. The themes are very straightforward.

For one, if you read the reviews, you'll find out that this game has some very strong Christian... themes thrust to the forefront at the end. Its a supernatural thriller in vein of say, Frank Peretti, sorta. For further context, these devs also created a BL VN, so I'm thoroughly confused here. 

Honestly, I'm going to recommend this if you like stories that make you wonder about their creation and about the beliefs of the creators. I honestly am not confident this VN is not satire. But I also could easily see it being genuine. 

Its a confusing story to read, and honestly, its out there enough that I'm going to read this devs other stuff to try and figure out what their mindset is. 

Also, somehow at the bad end there's a song that plays that has shockingly good production values, but despite my searching its lyrics up on the internet I got absolute 0 hits. I looked up lots of different combinations of lyrics as well.

The art style has a certain self-drawn comic book style charm to it and is pretty okay overall.
Also there is a dog and he is a good boy, easy points there.
The writing does feel somewhat like teen behaviour though it's very meh, probably more like movie teen behaviour.
For a Christian game it's better than expected? Though expectations are pretty low for those to begin with, so that's not saying a whole lot. The story is not taking anything supernatural serious other than the Christian stuff, merely using clichés and pop culture references at times not even doing their research at all.
Pretty much all the characters are exaggerated and not taken very seriously except the Christian girl Zaaliah, Sissy who deserved better, the character you play Brett and Greg the more science/psychology oriented guy. I do find some charm with the characters, except Tina she's mean though that's a personal preference kind of thing, but they very much get annoying at some point.
I do commend the effort that was put into this, visuals, music and such following a coherent style, but the overly Christian stuff sours it. It could have been kinda good if for example they had taken bits of different paranormal believes and woven them together in a way that leaves it up for interpretation what you believe is actually going on, but they didn't.
All in all, not recommending it as a serious VN. If you're not easily triggered by the whole Christian stuff and the exaggeration of the characters, it might be fine as a joke reading or something like you'd watch trash tv ironically (funny since the setting is actually a reality tv kind of thing). Note that this is not a 'it's so bad it's good' situation though, not by a long shot. There are far better mystery/romance VNs out there, free ones no less!

PS: I suggest against reading the Extra stories that are from Zaaliah's perspective at all as those are particularly Christian oriented and very obnoxious as a result. More so than the main game.",1664712816,1664712939,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The reason I am giving this game a recommend, is because I am an achievement hunter and the achievements are really easy to get. Now... let's go into more details of the game.

So basically before I started the game, I honestly thought that it was going to be a paranormal VN with ghosts and stuff, but this quickly became a lot darker and more religious than just a normal ghost story, but I will go into more detail a bit later.

The dialogue shows that the developer clearly speaks English and therefore there aren't those weird language gap mistakes you usually get in a free to play VN. The language is therefore understandable and above average. The dialogue itself is not super interesting and made me cringe on a few places. 

The art style is really weird. I liked the way the characters were created. I see that some of the reviews say that it's really bad, but I honestly didn't have any problem with the way the characters were made. Some of them looked really weird, but it made it creative and different. The background was a different story. It was created on a different way than how the characters were made. Some of the backgrounds looked like photos, others looked like it was drawn, but not by the same person or same art style as the characters. This also did not make the experience bad, it just made it different. Some areas were still very beautiful and creative. 

You will not know this from the start, but this is a Christian game. Not in a good way though. So you get an evangelical Christian character that preaches quite a lot. This is not the main character, but everything she says turns out to be true. The story then turns into something about demon possession and the only way to get a happy ending, is by converting to Christianity and praying to God.

The reason this bothered me so much, is not because of the fact that it was based on religion, as I believe everyone has the right to their religion and expression thereof. I am also a Christian myself, so this is not a biased opinion based on my religion. The thing that bothered me was the fact that it was a whole preaching thing and the player is forced to choose the religious path to unlock the happy ending achievements. I do not feel that forcing religion on anyone is ever a good idea. 

I personally feel that if the writing was done a bit different and more strategic, it would've been a lot better. Where you can mention your religious beliefs without it becoming preaching and maybe made more than one path for a happy ending. If the characters were more diverse then this could've helped by choosing different endings in giving each person a different way or belief to be happy. Honestly, this is the main reason why most people stay away from religious discussions or games, as there is no correct way of bringing it up.

Looking past the religious aspects and undertone racism, I did not find a big difference in the different endings and choices I made. Basically the dialogue stays the same no matter the choices you make and the main thing that differs is basically the different characters you choose. Each of these choices will give you a different achievement. I feel that the characters and their relationships needs to be developed and worked on a bit more to create a finished feeling when the story ends. I feel that the ending came quite abruptly where you wanted to explore the characters and their relationships a bit more.

Something that also bothered me a lot, is the fact that every time you finish a game and want to start a new game, you have to restart the game, because it crashes. If I am not mistaken, there is a fix to this bug, however I did not have the fix in my gameplay. (Unlucky!)

I feel that this game will have a lot of haters and therefore if you are not into the whole religious genre games, then this might not be the game for you.

Not quite what you'd expect when there are dark presences at bay, and plenty of conflict to keep them... occupied.
But if you mess with the supernatural, it often messes back.
It's a Visual Novel that deals with all sides of the paranormal. It has over 8 endings (some romance) plus some bonus epilogues through the eyes of Zaaliah. 50k words.

Что происходит, когда теоретик заговора, демонолог, экстрасенс, похищенный, королева вуду, паранормальный исследователь и психолог-стажер собираются вместе для одноразового телешоу под названием"" паранормальные подростки"" ?

Не совсем то, что вы ожидаете, когда есть темные присутствия в страхе, и много конфликтов, чтобы удержать их... занятый.

Но если вы связываетесь со сверхъестественным, оно часто возвращается обратно.

Это визуальный роман, который имеет дело со всеми сторонами паранормального. Он имеет более 8 концовок (некоторые романтические) плюс некоторые бонусные эпилоги глазами Заалии. 50 тысяч слов.

The only choices that affect things are who you hang out with, which in turns affects your ending (be it a no-homo bromance or contrived barely developed romance with a girl), the actual contest portion seems to mean nothing.
Oh and technical issue: if you try and start a new game directly after getting an ending, the game crashes. 
There was limited voice ""acting"", a couple of lines, and the sounds play at normal speed on skip mode which becomes hellish because half of it is dog whines. The art is... appropriate for a free game.

Ein paar Jugendliche, drei Mädels und vier Jungs lösen übersinnliche Fälle. Dabei hat jeder ein bestimmtes Spezialgebiet, die eine Voodoo der andere UFOs.

Die Geschichte verläuft im Großen und Ganzen linear. Lediglich hin und wieder können wir etwas entscheiden, etwa mit welcher Gruppe wir mitgehen, mit wem wir sprechen oder ob das erlebte überhaupt echt war oder doch nur ein Schabernack. Das führt zu minimalen Änderungen in der Geschichte, die zu einigen unterschiedlichen Enden führen. Umfangreich wird das Spiel aber dadurch beileibe nicht.

Und unterhaltsam ist es auch nicht. Das liegt primär an den furchtbaren Charakteren, die wie billige Abziehbilder durch die Geschichte stolpern. Die Typisierungen sind so schlecht und klischeebeladen, daß selbst RTL2-Gucker sich unterfordert fühlen dürften. Sicher, in gewisser Weise ist das alles auch ironisch gemeint, aber es ist nicht witzig. Gar nicht witzig. Überhaupt nicht witzig. Es ist eigentlich nur peinlich.

Technisch mag das Game auf einem guten, soliden Stand sein, Grafik und Sound sind flunderflach aber erträglich, dennoch bekommt man nach wenigen Minuten argen Juckreiz im Niveauzentrum.

First of all, ignore the playtime listed. I left the game window open for hours when I had to go do something else. I didn’t spend nearly that long on the game, even though I take my time with visual novels.

This is my first Steam review. It took something pretty memorable to break my habit of not reviewing games, and this is it. I actually read other reviews before playing the game, and they only made me want to play it more. I have a thing for cheesy fundamentalist Christian propaganda, though I’m an atheist, and I knew what this was going in. I would have played it eventually anyway, since I liked the concept even without the Christianity, and I have a sort of bile fascination for amusingly bad but playable games, and I love visual novels. But as soon as I found out it was full of super fundie Christianity, I downloaded it immediately and began to play. Jackpot!

And wow! I certainly got what I was looking for, though I was kinda disappointed that [spoiler]Jesus didn’t show up in the flesh as a character, and not just as a bright light[/spoiler]. The truly despicable thing about this game is that it doesn’t let the player know right away that it’s a Christian game. During the first part of the game there is an evangelical Christian character who’s quite preachy, but don’t clearly show her to be correct in the world of the game. She isn’t the main character. But then everything she says turns out to be true and the only way to get the “good” end of the game is to [spoiler]convert to Christianity[/spoiler]. The description of the game is intended to lure in people interested in the paranormal, occult, and UFOs thinking that they’ll get a decent game about the subject matter with an open mind or at least a funny comedic take, but what the game ends up doing is preaching about how those are all evil and demonic, literally. There is legitimately a bonus section to the game that tells players that UFOs are demons in disguise. What. the. literal. hell.

As for the art and writing, the art was at times passable and at times terrible, while the writing was pretty amateurish and the characters were cardboard stereotypes, sometimes even going for racial and gender stereotypes. None of the characters were the least bit likable. In fact, they were all uniquely unlikable. There were a few jokes that made me laugh, but some were more cringeworthy. The music was bearable, even amusing at times, but the backgrounds were awful, a mixture of shopped images, drawings, and photos.

Despite the mixed art and writing quality, I might have given this a thumbs up for the cheesiness and interesting concept. Maybe. Even with some of the religion, as long as it had been made clear what kind of game this was. But the deceptiveness pushes me over the edge to a thumbs down. I’d only recommend this to people who get a kick out of ridiculously over the top, self-righteous fundamentalist Christian propaganda, as long as they know that’s what they’re getting. That said, I did come away amused by this free game. But that’s just me.

Full disclosure: I haven’t played all the routes yet, just the [spoiler]Jesus-y one where the main character gets together with the Christian girl[/spoiler]. But I know that at least one of the characters [spoiler]dies if the MC doesn’t convert to Christianity and pray to Jesus[/spoiler]. Wow. Just wow.

EDIT: Okay, I decided to spend some more time to get every single ending in the game. and over the course of doing this I noticed a LOT of plot holes and seeming bugs in the game. Some things didn't make sense on the other paths I took, which means that the first path I took was probably what the creator of the game considered to be the ""true path"" and the others didn't receive as much attention. There were also some weird things with the music at times. It makes me wonder whether this game was really beta tested. I'm making my own visual novel right now, and I've been thoroughly testing each path/dialogue option, and plan on having multiple other people test my game when I've got the beta version done. Couldn't the creator of this game have done that as well?",1507079105,1507518463,False,10,0,0.6446685791015625,2,False,False,False,False,,,

What happens when you put together a team of a conspiracy theorist, a demonologist, a psychic, an abductee, a Voodoo Queen, a paranormal investigator, and a psychologist in training? You get Paranormal Teens, a one time television show. However, if you mess with the supernatural, chances are, it’s going to mess back.

This seemed like it was going to be a really good game when I first downloaded it, and the first play through of it. However, very quickly, this became very repetitive. Save files would not work whatsoever for me, so in order to complete the achievement aspect of the game, I had to go through the game ten times; with the bug of the game closing after every route and crashing when you tried to open it again, I lost interest very quickly.

The characters in this are very dull, and their designs are relatively boring. The soundtrack isn’t that amazing, and the story line was just… rather uninteresting. I honestly have nothing positive to say about this game. I really wish it was so much better than it was; this had a lot of potential, but Visual Wordplay just didn’t live up to it.

There are plenty of better games to play in the novel section of Steam, and I would recommend them a lot more than I recommend this. Frankly, I just wouldn’t recommend this at all. I’m just grateful to be done with it, and get if off of my computer.

1) [u]Баги и геймплей[/u]: игра падает, падает адски и безбожно, падает после прохождения, после свертывания, при любой возможности, это пожалуй самый главный минус игры. Всего в игре 11 концовок, но проходится все это дело легко. Нужно просто выделить героя с которым мы хотим получить концовку и во время выборов с кем пойти\поговорить выбирать его. Для каждого героя есть почти одна и та же хорошая и плохая концовка. Для хорошей надо [spoiler]помолиться Иисусу[/spoiler], для плохой все остальное. Почти все ачивки можно получить за прохождение за всех героев (кроме двух, одна получается во время выбора сказать ""что-то смешное"" в первой части игры, вторая за просмотр сведений про НЛО в бонусах), сложнее всего с ачивкой ""остаться один"", для этого нужно не выделять отдельного персонажа и встречаться с ними как можно меньше, чтобы не завязывать дружбы.

2) [u]Сюжет[/u]: группа фриковатых подростков, среди которых есть парапсихологи, уфологи и прочие интересные люди, собралась для участия в новом ток-шоу ""Паранормальные подростки"", в которым им предстоит определить какие события реальны и имеют мистическое происхождение, какие придуманы сотрудниками шоу. Под конец наших героев ждет не самая приятная встреча с потусторонним миром. Сюжет прописан имхо чуть лучше среднего, но что может коробить некоторых игроков, здесь очень много ссылок на христианство и религию, так что игра становится чуть ли не прозелитской.

3) [u]Графика и звуки[/u]: музыка в игре на удивление хороша, даже есть финальная песня. В отдельных местах (и в бонусах), есть английская озвучка. Персонажи нарисованы несколько аляповато, но в целом неплохо. Задники - часть нарисованы, часть фотографии, часть обработанные фотографии.

[u]Как итог[/u]: в целом игра была бы неплохой мистической историй, если бы не обилие ссылок из Библии, и вечные падения по любому поводу. Так что рекомендовать могу только ярым любителям визуальных новелл с налетом мистицизма, и собирателям ""идеальных игр"".
