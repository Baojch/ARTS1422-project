- 没继续更新
- 卡池非常的少, 构筑流派有些困难, 导致乐趣速减

如果你考虑要玩的话:
- 注意查卡自己有什么牌的组牌界面那里, 英雄的详情上面有个银色的圆币图标, 点开可以看到这个英雄的任务, 任意关卡完成任务可以解锁新卡, 这个新卡不在平时查看的牌册里. 
这些个任务可能就是这个游戏后面游玩的乐趣点了, 比如讨论版大家在分析如何让阿拉贡一回合动8次....

综上我的个人评价是不推荐. 除非你是重度卡牌迷, 能忍受这种卡池特别小的情况下去组牌.

But, there's a large audience out there that, even if enjoying either of the given subjects, might not be into this game.
The thematic is really cool, and there's a decent amount of proper, good voice acting done in the game. The rules of the game are rather intriguing too. There's multiple factions (i.e. card sets) to pick from, which can be combined - the game allows for 3 hero cards for each deck, each hero having their own faction/colour, dictating what cards can be used. There's persistent effects on board that can be individually dealt with, providing for a large array of encounters and ""boss"" battles. Each unit has two types of attack, either of which can be interacted with and provides multiple ways of dealing with said encounters.
And the card amount is decent too, all of which are related to LotR in some way, as one would expect. I definitely enjoyed that.
The story isn't even half bad, though I wouldn't presume anyone to play the game for the story, if the base gameplay doesn't seem interesting.
All that said, I finished the base campaigns and felt like I got enough. I didn't much care for challenges or the such as further content.

For some, this might not be a big enough game, or it might be too much of a nice.

翻译尚可（后来发现还是不行，影响体验，改差评了），卡牌构建，指环王粉7.6内推荐入库。特色是事件进度机制（人物攻击分攻击点和进度攻击点，进度攻击点攻击事件可加快事件进度，而非看回合数来计算事件进度）；回合计算方式不同；看商店页面有合作共斗，这点在卡牌类游戏里是少有的，这点好评。看到因为回合数计算方式不同差评的，觉得没必要，毕竟要创新和不同嘛。联机看上去是只有类似局域网的联机，不是像炉石样的联机；商店页面显示要额外账号才能游玩，实际不用，这点也好评；商店页面显示有dlc，但是没有看到购买选项，不知是不是免费合并到本体了；商店页面显示无云存档，实际有，好评。

cpu烧了，规则好繁琐，上手门槛有点高；再加上翻译问题，术语不统一，描述不准确，看的晕，搁置了。

特有规则或键位备忘：回合分休整回合（休整回合至少回三费，至少抽一张牌，有些技能可在此时使用），普通回合（轮次）；普通回合内分若干小回合，多数动作都费一个小回合。加护技能是嘲讽近战单位，并全反伤，触发后消失；角色有该技能时登场自动使用，到休整回合自动恢复；若手动使用的消耗一回合中的一小回合。远程技能无视加护，可对空（即对飞行，飞行可对飞行，近战不能对空）。... ...规则繁琐，估计这里写不下。

Let me break it down for you – this game, I stumbled upon it expecting an authentic LOTR LCG experience, but boy, was I in for a surprise. Forget about the faithful port – it's more like a distant cousin.

But hold on, it's not all doom and gloom. The game has its merits. The visuals, voiceovers, illustrations – they've poured love into it. However, don't mistake it for a replica; treat it as its own beast.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Difficulty and duration – I took on the Shire Pack, crafted my own deck, no special packs, no valor cards. It took me a good 2 hours to conquer the first quest at normal difficulty. 

Now, the price model – it had its hiccups, but it's almost entirely free now. Earn valor by slaying quests, spend it on cards. Simple. No need to sell your soul.

Let's talk narrative – the icing on the Middle Earth cake. Large illustrations, voiced narrators, Gollum chattering away – it's movie-quality stuff. And the writing? Top-notch. Card illustrations are a treat, but the templates – a bit much.

Mechanics, my friend – the heart of the matter. Heroes generating threat, fate coming into play – it's a dance. It's not as simple as ""put all your powerful heroes in and forget about threat."" There's depth here, especially on challenge difficulty.

Now, let's not ignore the elephant in the room – the card collection. Not enough cards, and deck building feels like a kiddie pool instead of the deep end. They better fix that.

In a nutshell – give it a go, it's free. But don't get your wallet involved. It's a flirtation with Middle Earth, not a long-term relationship. They tried to cash in on the name but fell short. Stick to the original, my friends.

Почитал отзывы, негативные моменты меня не отпугнули и вот он момент - нырнуть в мир эпичного фэнтези. Но это я запустил другую игру. А что в итоге с Властелином колец? Ну начать стоит с того, что эти истории (я  говорю о трех основных кампаниях) определенно имело смысл называть скорее ""Хоббит. Приключенческая игра"". Несмотря на любимых многими героев, мы не затрагиваем напрямую события ""Властелина колец"", масштаб совершенно не тот. Это не эпическое фэнтези, а походы партии 3-5 уровней в днд. Опять-таки, я бы с удовольствием поиграл в это, если бы не каноничные герои. Представьте себе Элронда, занимающегося расследованием краж в хоббитском городенке (я не шучу). Начало кампейна выглядело неплохо - спасение Бильбо от пауков выглядело как неплохая завязка. Завязка.... завязка... Мы весь первый кампейн спасаем Бильбо от пауков? Конечно, не весь. Пауки, оказывается, похищают путников для орков (что?). И вот мы узнали, что есть орочий лидер, который набирает рабов для некроманта. Ок, шатко-валко сюжет начинает двигаться. Дальше начинаются чистые мультики - побеждаем главаря орков, он убегает. Подобная ситуация повторяется раза три. Во втором кампейне мы снова его встречаем и, так как это очень-супер-мега-важно, убиваем его. Но, как оказалось, он опять притворился и убежал. Ладно, как у молодого ГМа все здесь шито белыми нитками, все-таки сюжет кое-как продолжает развиваться. И вот мы уже встречаем Радагаста и вместе с ним пытаемся противостоять некроманту. Сразу готовьтесь, что не все герои созданы для всех кампейнов. Например, в финальном бою бить некроманта в лицо нельзя, вся партия дружно делает Радагасту массаж и мотивирует его все-таки выиграть в бою, поэтому, например, суровый боевой отряд просто огребет. Ладно, со всеми расшарками это кое-как тянет на историю. Тучи сгущаются, наверное, я так, чисто предположу, стоит связаться с кем-то из разбирающихся в том, что происходит... А, нет, нужно ехать в Бри, искать, расческу, которую украли у одного из местных хоббитов, а потом расследовать убийство. Серьезно? Даже при том, что история снова начинает закручиваться, это одна из самых нелепых склеек, которые мне встречались в произведениях. 

Что касается игротехнических моментов - во многих комментариях их описали достаточно верно. Это не суперуспех, но и не  провал - игра довольно середнечковая. Но с наценкой за громкое название.  Не рекомендую ее покупать без скидок, есть масса более интересных по исполнению и более живых игр. 

Из хороших моментов (хоть и спорных) хочу отметить чтецов. Литературные вставки между событиями озвучены, прочитаны весьма неплохо. Как будто прикасаешься к книге. Правда, не Толкиеновской, но тем не менее. 

В целом, на фоне последних опробованных игр, эта скорее не понравилась. Вы можете найти много более качественного контента на просторах стима.",1699377576,1699377576,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Tolkiena. Wydana przez studio Fantasy Flight Interactive, gra oferuje niezwykle wciągające i satysfakcjonujące doświadczenie dla fanów sagi Władcy Pierścieni i miłośników gier karcianych.

Jednym z najbardziej wyróżniających się elementów w The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game jest głębia strategiczna, jaką oferuje. Gracze mają możliwość budowania talii kart, które reprezentują różne postacie, przedmioty i zdolności z fantastycznego świata Tolkiena. W trakcie rozgrywki muszą podejmować mądre decyzje taktyczne, aby pokonać niebezpieczeństwa i wyzwania, z którymi spotykają się ich bohaterowie.

Narracja i atmosfera gry są niezwykle mocne, wiernie oddając ducha powieści Tolkiena. Scenariusze i misje, które gracz może przejść, przekazują wspaniałą opowieść, która wciąga i angażuje gracza.

Możliwość wspólnego tworzenia talii i planowania strategii z innymi graczami dodaje element społeczny i zapewnia długotrwałą zabawę.

Jedynym mankamentem gry jest, że nauka zasad może być nieco skomplikowana dla nowych graczy. Gra wymaga pewnego czasu i wysiłku, aby oswoić się z mechanikami i zrozumieć strategie, ale po przekroczeniu tej krzywej uczenia się, staje się niezwykle satysfakcjonującym doświadczeniem.

Podsumowując, The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game - Definitive Edition jest grą, która dostarcza zarówno fanom Władcy Pierścieni, jak i miłośnikom gier karcianych, głębokie i emocjonujące doświadczenie.

DAS WICHTIGSTE ZUERSt:
CO-OP !!!! Und der ist auch noch richtig gut implementiert  *love it*
Wo gibt es das heutzutage noch? Danke dafür !

PRO
- viele Sinnvolle Karten + Heldenkarten mit vielen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten und Synergien (gerade im CO-OP)
- schöne Illustrationen
- Kampagne im Co-Op spielbar, so dass man seine Decks mit einem Freund abstimmen kann, Synergien bilden kann etc. (einer baut Macht-Punkte auf und Heilt eher, der andere baut sich eher ein Dmg+Block-Deck .... z.B.)
- Kampagne bringt sehr viele Map-spezifische Bedingungen, die jede Runde abwechslungsreich machen
- Balancing ist in meinen Augen sehr gut gelungen, einige Synergien sind stärker als andere aber das bringt ja auch Spaß, diese herauszufinden (Block+Abschirmen kombos z.b.)
--> ich habe mir mindestens 6 verschiedene Decks gebaut mit verschiedenen Helden-Kombinationen, um auf bestimmte Kampagnen-Stellen zu reagieren und zusätzliche Belohnungen zu ergattern 
- kurze Ladezeiten
- Einfach gehaltenes Menü, übersichtlich und aufs wesentliche begrenzt

CONTRA
- wüsste gerade nichts ...

This one escaped my gaze for the longest time, and it's a loving gaze! I adore cards since Mario's Game Gallery and playing Fool with my friends in the icy stairwells of panel houses while our parents drank their lives away at home. Back then, playing cards was an island of calm, and this is what I've been expecting from them ever since.

[h3]Asmodee[/h3]
Did Asmodee deliver the goods? Most of the publisher's games have dubious ratings, creating an impression that their products are undercooked. I saw them as apathetic mobile market grinders previously, but check this out - LotR used to be your typical free-to-play live service crap with atrocious microtransactions! Evidently, it was remastered after the initial backlash. Fixing stuff post-launch doesn't beat it being good from the get-go but is commendable still. On the store page, you can see years-old reviews from before the fact, but don't be confused by the weird claims that refer to an almost completely different game.

[h3]Audiovisual[/h3]
The game isn't based on the movie license, yet doesn't miss it by much at heart. The card art is splendid and most of it migrated from the board game, which has high-quality fantasy imagery that would immediately seem familiar to any fan of the setting, recreating the cosiness and the pathos of the original epics. The mobile stink from the menus with buttons covering up half of the screen is bizarre and can be a deal-breaker to some. On the other hand, the menu art is pretty and you can still get where you want in a few seconds. The combat UI is decent and, overall, the game looks good in static as well as in motion, having your actions conveyed through special effects with punchy animations. Withal, the OST slapped me with how surprisingly elaborate it is. Be that heroic marches or the wailing in the cold crypt, the majestic HoMM vibes emanated by the music finalise the homely atmosphere of the game.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The stories to play through happen in the period between The Hobbit and LotR, but don't get your hopes up since they're but zany fanfic gobbledygook. Bilbo, Gloin, Aragorn, and Faramir wander through Mirkwood when, suddenly, spiders attack and kidnap Bilbo... but then, it turns out the orcs are behind the scheme! Sophisticated, eh. The solid voice acting could probably carry the narratives anyway, but I'd lost any interest in reading or listening to this nonsense after a couple of missions.

[h3]Deck Building[/h3]
Traditionally, I've spent at least a third of my playtime building decks. First figuring out what I want, then honing my precious. As a foundation, you can have up to 3 heroes in a deck, each with a different impactful ability, and their colours, or Spheres, determine what cards you can add. Having heroes of all 3 Spheres would untie your hands in terms of weaker goods, but having 2-3 heroes of the same sphere allows adding more powerful cards that demand just that. Yet again, a better interface could go a long way. Things barely fit, you have to flip through a lot of pages. So, this isn't the most comfortable tool, but all the filters at your disposal make it manageable. You can sort cards by keywords and races, it isn't a problem to find something if you know what to look for.

To know is one thing, but to afford new cards you'll need Fellowship Points, a currency with which to unlock new goods like your equip, units, spells, or heroes, and also all sorts of useless cosmetics. Said points are gained for completing quests, beating optional challenges, and act as local meta-progression, gradually expanding your options as you go. Don't fret, the reward system is generous enough, so you'll probably have everything you want after reaching the midpoint or earlier if you main 1 or 2 decks. As mentioned, some of the rewards are cosmetic, and why would I care for any of it in my singleplayer card game? This lousy loot couldn't motivate me to replay the campaigns two additional times. At least every first reward for beating a quest is a card, so I didn't have to grind.

[h3]Questing & Fighting[/h3]
Despite serious diversions from the original board game, most of the core distinguishing mechanics that set it apart from its peers seem to have been carried over faithfully. There're 3-4 locations/encounters per quest, 5 quests per campaign, and 3 campaigns overall. Your hand, characters, their equipment, buffs, and health persist between encounters. The continuity is a clever feature that makes you think ahead, raising the stakes and tension closer to the finale. There's a variety of challenges to overcome, and not only monsters. Each location has an Objective or a set of them, which sometimes change within one encounter. Objectives are entities that advance missions when resolved by attacking them with units who have Willpower, which is one of the core stats along with health and normal attack values. Sauron likes to spam his own perilous version of them, Hazards, so having some Willpower on your units is important.

The battles present you with a plethora of choices every turn. It's an involved system with its own tangs. Unlike in most card games, a round consists of exchanging blows with Sauron until you're both out of moves. This feels like real-time in comparison to the usual deal, creating a different kind of pacing that I haven't encountered in a card game prior to this one. More commonly, the unspent Resources are stored between rounds, adding another layer of forward-thinking. The rounds themselves are divided into several phases. For example, the first one is called Upkeep, cards with that keyword perform their abilities during the phase if the conditions are met. Dammit, it will take me 4 reviews to describe how every intricacy works! But there's no need. The game is easy to learn and has a comprehensive tutorial as well as your usual QoL like the glossary and tooltips.

Nevertheless, let's have a look at one of the biggest distinctive features that plays an important role - the Threat Meter. It didn't seem that huge initially, but neglecting it has led to the majority of my deaths in the late game. Sauron fills the Threat Meter in a myriad of ways and his threat events that trigger at certain thresholds can hinder your party big time. What's worse is that if the Meter's fills during a mission - you lose. Another way to lose is to get all of your heroes killed, but it happened to me maybe once? That threat level was the real run-killer. Somewhat mitigating the issue, the Fellowship has an answer in the form of the Fate Meter. Any character with Willpower can choose to add their value to it at the expense of getting exhausted. Rarely a game-changer, but it helps to have all kinds of buffs, summons, and location-specific events in store. No, it doesn't make Sauron lose the game when you max it and usually runs out of juice fast.

[h3]Difficulty[/h3]
First and foremost, this gem is a compelling puzzle to solve. In the spirit of the books, every time I thought I was ready for everything, a new quest threw some preposterous curveball my way. Embarking on a new adventure, I was always expecting jeopardy previously unseen - the local Sauron is a master of devious tactics. And I had no one else to blame for my failures! There isn't much RNG aside from very few selected cards, the draw, and not knowing what Sauron would do next. His AI is surprisingly crafty and, supported by a good encounter design, makes LotR an apt solo challenge in a genre that often neglects singleplayer. Fuelled by a powerful catalyst in the form of a fantasy epic of such magnitude and combined with old reliable card traditions, this quirky game offers a soothing adventure made with care.

I brought it because I own the physical card game irl. So I thought it would be a lot of fun to play this online. Well just imagine my frustation. First of all, it took AGES for the original devs to get past the early acess state. Took a lot of time for it to be even Co-Op. But things were progressing. 
What many do not know is that on the original card game, you collect sauron cards and actually one player must play as Sauron against the others. So, I still remember that I joined the twitch stream that original devs were doing and asked when such feature would be avaliable. To my surprise, they answered players won't play as Sauron. Well, why the game had a sauron deck or even showed Sauron cards to collect in the first place? That was a HUGE let down to me and since then I completely stopped playing this. I returned when a new team was announced. Tried this game again... and nothing changed. The current state is that it's pretty much dead, abandoned. So, yeah, can't recommend!

+ Looks nice too. The graphics are good. Nothing spectacular but works. A lot of card games, even famous ones, never had such a pleasant look such as this one.
+ Plays nice too. During early times it had a lot of bugs but there was some effort to fix then.
+ A fair system of getting cards without having to pay for them. Wasn't  a pay to win during early times. I can't state this after the new dev team arrived though.

Bad points: 
 - The HUGEST let down: Players can't play as Sauron or use the Sauron deck. Can't even collect Sauron cards. Not at ALL how the original card game works.
- Game was simply abandoned. 
- Not free anymore.
- Since day ONE, the addition of new content was extremely slow. Always gave the impression the deves were not very interested on the project.


Score: 0/10 Worth Buying: No. Despite the game current state of being abandoned, which by itself is enough reason from staying away from it , the fact that players can't play or even collect Sauron cards takes away almost all the fun this game had to offer. That would be the real gem that would make  it different from the others cards games. It's ashame , a waste really because nowadays the gaming industry simply doesn't have good cards games. This great co-op game was even capable of atracting people that are not into LOTR lore,  like me. It had an amazing potential but everything was thrown away due to lack of vision from the devs, especially the original team.

The visuals and voice narration are great.

But the mechanics of the game came up short for me.

For starters, the main menu system for everything is clearly designed for mobile and unnecessarily difficult to navigate as a result. In addition to scrolling being a pain on desktop, it takes 4 or 5 layers of drilling down to actually start a battle. The emphasis on gorgeous artwork gets in the way of function and it's a shame.

Deck building is slightly tedious, but nothing out of the ordinary for deck builders. What bugged me most is that so many cards are locked behind the need to grind. Completing the main quest line *might* provide enough credits to unlock another hero, but I'll never know because I was focused on unlocking half of the basic cards. Unlocks should serve as motivation to try new strategies and experiment, but instead I found myself replaying battles or quests repeatedly. It killed the fun for me.

The actual gameplay is pretty decent. The resource system for playing cards is well-balanced and actions feel meaningful. The toughest thing for me, as someone who plays a lot of deck builders, is the lack of consistency that comes from being limited to 2 copies of a card in the deck. But starting with three heroes and limiting decks to 30 cards does solve a lot of that. Plus, the persistence of characters between sections of quests means that you ostensibly only need to setup once for four battles.

In short: lore is great and gameplay fun for a bit, but deck building comes at the cost of not-so-fun grinding.",1642738880,1642738880,False,10,0,0.583203136920928955,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Let me start by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of LOTR in all types of media but I'm not a fan of this game. First the cosmetics (frames,avatars,cardbacks) are all locked and each of them  costs  1k of in-game currency to unlock. Then a lot of cards are  locked behind that 1k wall as well. Why?! What is the point?!  They can just keep releasing new DLC's or hero packs  with new cards and get rid of that nonsensical grind. It's not like this is akin to Hearthstone,MTG or any other card game that is updated VERY frequently so I really don't see a point there. Not to mention that Campaign  and Encounter mode is ALWAYS the same and repetitive. Meaning same encounters in the same way with same dialogue over and over and over  again and for each completion you get 1k of In-game currency so enjoy grinding your soul out. The only mode where you get random  deck and encounters is the new one called Mirror of Galadriel. So replayability is dead. Multipalyer is also dead. I can't think of any good reason to recommend this to any LOTR fan sadly. I got it on a huge discount for a few € and I still feel bad for spending money on it.


[b]Pros: [/b]
✅ LOTR themed CCG
✅ Graphically okay-ish
✅ Quite a few modes, sadly only one isn't repetitive

I struggle to see the necessity of outright changing all the cards, removing combos, etc for the sake of this game. The obvious market for this game are fans of the LCG, so why change it at all? And the changes they do make are pretty awful. And even given that they appeared to be trying to rip off Hearthstone's general look, it's a worse version of that game.

- Really needed more development time. The slow rollout of cards, even after all this time (more than 2 years) makes it thin and unfun. The UI could use a little work too.

- Changing the mechanics of the game, really makes it feel unbalanced at times, with ""Sauron"" doing way more ridiculous things than happens in the LCG.

- At the end of the day, it's not even that terribly fun compared to other games in related genres. I play the LCG twice a month with some friends and it just doesn't compare. In terms of card gards, there's plenty of better ones out there. In terms of Hearthstone-y games, there are way better ones out there. Don't waste your money, just go play any of those again instead.

PRO:
- Ambientazione, qui direi che non c'è niente da eccepire.
- Meccaniche: tante idee originali e interessanti, avendo giocato a moltissimi TCG e CCG ho apprezzato molto il fatto che si siano impegnati a rendere unico il gioco.

CONTRO:
- Board-aspetto grafico, come altri giochi della Asmodee trasposti in digitale l'aspetto grafico e l'interfaccia non sono particolarmente accattivanti o curate.
- Difficoltà: in alcuni momenti la difficoltà diventa artificialmente impossibile per esigenze ""narrative"", non amo questo espediente, avrei preferito una sfida reale e ben costruita, piuttosto che una artificiale che poi richiede di essere compensata con interventi che vanificano l'abilità del giocatore.

Nel complesso mi sono divertito, il gioco mi ha intrattenuto molto e penso prima o poi proverò anche a cercare game online o a giocarlo in PVP con altri amici.

Me ha gustado tanto el juego que me gustaría que existiese mas juegos con este modo de juego cooperativo de cartas, lo recomiendo mucho vale la pena la versión definitiva. La pasaras genial con tu amigo. 

(POR FAVOR CREADORES tomen en cuenta esto)
1-	Agregar una tienda donde se compre más cartas esto ara que el juego sea más amplio. 
2-	Agregar más contenido, más cartas.
3-	Agregar el Idioma Español en voz sería maravilloso para disfrutar mejor la historia. 
4-	Esperare la Secuela o porque no otra temática de película e implementarla en un juego de cartas cooperativo como hicieron aquí.

1. Not enough cards to start, and cards unlock too slow.  This means deckbuilding is lame; you're not picking between cards you want, you're picking the obviously great cards and then the ""least bad"" of the cards you don't want.
2. Difficulty feels random, and relies heavily on ""anti-fun"" mechanics.  Lots of the game/campaign is easy - but the harder missions/encounters rely heavily on random, miserable hosers for the difficulty (discard all your events!  all wounded allies die!  your key card got countered!).  Sometimes these do nothing, and sometimes they're back-breaking, and you have little room to mitigate them (they might be a treachery, an event, a shadow thing, an enemy, who knows).  Because of how the game snowballs, a single one of these often decides the game.  Who likes this ""gotcha"" style gameplay in a PvE game?  
3. The ""surprise events"" feel arbitrary/frustrating.  Haha, the boss has an 8th form.  Haha, the hero you just paid a bunch of resources for decides to leave now.  Good job game.  You got me.  Guess I get to start again with a different deck that's ready for the stupid twist.  None of this is fun, none if it adds to the game - just makes the game feel arbitrary and that your choices don't matter.
3. Lots of modes that take a very random game and just pile on more randomness/incomprehensibility.  The ""Adventure"" mode was just an endless string of nonsense.  Now your party splits, now this hero disappears, now you're on a blimp, now you're all skeletons.  It didn't feel narrative or interesting, it just made strategy feel irrelevant and the result feel random.

Game technically works, and you could build something fun with these pieces.  But the designers instead chose to build something that's aggressively miserable to play.

※優點：
。關卡間有全配音的劇情敘事，中文也非機翻，寫手和配音員水準都不錯，入關前更有帶入感外純聽旁白講故事也是享受。
。相較於電影三部曲，遊戲更加還原托佬筆下的黑暗生物如何活動，各方勢力的關係，讓沒看小說的讀者能更了解中土世界。
。補足了很多電影省略的角色，讓玩家可以自由搭配遠征隊英雄，彌補了小說或電影的遺珠之憾。
※缺點：
。部分名詞的中翻並非老玩家熟悉的用詞，嘗試英語發音才理解是在說誰。而且中文字形在部分遊戲準備頁面忽大忽小，幸好關卡內故事並未受影響。
。卡面人物繪圖不知道是不是跟數個已經完成作品的畫師買版權的，畫風迥異，越冷門的角色越無法跟主角團形成統一的風格，推測這個遊戲沒有特地請畫師為所有角色完成一組完備的基本牌面。
。不玩卡牌的我都能在2小時破戰役一，裡面全部的關卡加總應該也不會太多，還有要求重複刷關拿獎勵的元素，豐富度待檢驗。
。『商店簡介的圖片裡戰役是沿著地圖推進，實際下載卻是最原始的分頁點擊選關，氣氛完全沒了甚至有些草率，真的是大扣分，一度想因為不實廣告給差評。』(個人覺得魔戒這種情懷遊戲那張地圖很重要，購買前三思！！)。
※結論：大概推薦
。現在的青少年幾乎都沒有看過魔戒了，前陣子重映卡疫情電影院更是完全沒人，這幾年深感魔戒迷的新血越來越少，雖然Amazon貌似要拍第二紀元的影集，但個人並不樂觀能圈多少粉。魔戒的世界觀是奇幻文學的先驅，但要吸引青少年恐怕已是力有未逮了，一如看金庸武俠的國中生越來越少，一代經典們紛紛走向衰落。老粉們看到一款以魔戒為題材的遊戲能不掏錢包支持嗎？別要背棄了你們對維拉神的信仰！！不要走上努曼諾爾的後塵！！",1634295299,1634295299,True,5,0,0.579978704452514648,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Quisiera aclarar que soy un jugador random, con experiencia en juegos de cartas (desde Yugioh hasta Gwent) y conocimiento de LOTR (no soy un experto, mas, tampoco un casual). Por lo anterior, este análisis no está hecho para mega fanáticos que conocen el juego real o, para expertos en juegos de cartas que buscan desafíos, sino para personas que gustan de este mundo creado por Tolkien y, piensan que un juego de cartas sería lo mejor. 

Como siempre, la nota u conclusiones se encuentran al final.

POSITIVO 
->Detalle e historia: El juego se nota está muy bien hecho, inspirado en los detalles de los libros y, mostrando aspectos que demuestran no se trata de un juego de cartas casual para contar una historia por encima.
->Mecánicas: Aunque hay bastante de negativo, he de admitir que la mecánica es buena (desconozco si es así en el original). No es muy complicada, pero, tampoco es tan sencilla, debiendo mezclar de diversas formas algunas unidades y habilidades para salir librado (a veces por los pelos) de muchas situaciones. 
->Campañas y misiones: Hay una buena variedad de campañas y misiones para jugar en solitario, mismas que cuentan parte de la historia, lo que sin duda se agradece mucho. 
->Mazos: La capacidad de crear tus mazos de forma personalizada es algo vital en todo juego de cartas, por tanto, se agradece mucho que nos den esta opción y, así nos permitan adaptar un estilo de juego personal. 
->Compra de cartas: No sé si esto era así en un principio, pero ahora, por completar campañas o misiones se nos otorgan puntos, mismos que podemos usar para comprar cartas que nos interesen y, añadirlas a nuestro mazo. Esto me parece adecuado, puesto que te da un aliciente para probar campañas y, a la vez, obtienes mejoras para ir personalizando más tu forma de juego. 

NEGATIVO 
->Necesidad previa de conocer LOTR: Considero que un punto negativo no tan visible es la misma historia. Salvo que seas un medianamente entendido de este mundo, no te vas a enterar de un carajo (dado que los personajes se te presentan de golpe, igual que las situaciones). Entiendo que este juego está totalmente enfocado a la comunidad de LOTR, pero, se hubiese agradecido mucho que se hiciera un esfuerzo por incluir a todos los interesados no tan versados en estos libros/películas. 
->Cartas muy costosas: Hay unas cuantas cartas (que parecen ser las mejores, obvio) que cuestan una locura enfermiza de puntos, debiendo (a simples cálculos según las recompensas) hacer una docena de veces cada misión para tener la oportunidad de adquirirlas. Esto me parece totalmente absurdo, considerando que parte del chiste es personalizar tus mazos y, sentir que eres capaz de obtener recompensas por pasar campañas. 
->Injusticia total: El punto más negativo y, el que me hace no recomendar este juego es una sensación de injusticia total, plena, descarada y, hasta cínica. Nunca en mi vida me he encontrado con un nivel de injusticia tan grande como en este juego (sí, injusticia, no desafío, no dificultad, no simple azar). 
En LOTR existen un par de mecánicas que se le debieron ocurrir a un tipo que no tenía la más mínima idea de lo que implica el desafío (real, no artificial). Aunque podría abordar muchos aspectos, con un par es más que suficiente y, trataré de no extenderme en ello. 
Como en todo juego de cartas, tendremos la posibilidad de convocar (colocar) cartas que, dependiendo de su fortaleza, nos costarán más o menos puntos (en este juego, son una especie de puntos en esferas. Por cada ronda se nos otorgan 3 puntos -hablo de la dificultad estándar- de modo que, podemos gastarlos en usar cartas -de efecto, de tropas o de potenciación- o, guardarlos hasta la siguiente ronda). Hasta aquí, todo correcto, sin embargo, uno pensaría (porque es la lógica de cualquier ser racional que conozca este tipo de juegos) que dichos puntos son iguales para ambos bandos (el enemigo y tú) pero, ¿sabes qué? No es así chico…sin ahondar demasiado, es tan fácil como entender que sin importar lo que hagas, el enemigo siempre tendrá el doble o hasta el triple de puntos que tú para usar y, colocar carta tras carta tras carta en un festival de enemigos a lo bestia. 
¿Qué el enemigo se queda sin cartas? Estás mal de la cabeza, el enemigo por ronda podrá robar 5 cartas (y nunca se le acaban). Oye, pero, entonces nosotros también robamos 5 cartas, ¿verdad? Craso error amigo mío, tú solo robas 2 cartas (¡y eso que no estamos en la dificultad alta!) por turno. Así, haciendo una matemática de kínder, si el enemigo gana (mágicamente) muchos más puntos por ronda que tú para invocar cartas y, encima, roba 5 por turno, la situación ya va jodida, mas, seguro que eso es todo, ¿no? Se viene lo mejor camarada. 
Por tus héroes (que puedes llevar 3 y si mueren todos pierdes) se rellenará una barra de “amenaza” que va del 0 al 50, si llega al 50, pierdes en automático. Por llevar 3 héroes es normal que este valor ronde los 30 puntos (hablo con mazos iniciales) de entrada y sin vaselina. Eso debería ser todo, mientras no suba a 50 todo ok, ¿no? ¡Pues no! Resulta que por ronda ese valor aumenta (¡a veces hasta 5 puntos por efectos de cartas enemigas!) y, si estás en una campaña, eta se divide en 3 a 5 escenarios (mismos donde esta barra de amenaza nunca disminuye). 

Y podría seguir con una lista de enormes injusticias, desde que a veces debes proteger a un personaje (pues si muere pierdes) hasta que a veces al entrar en otro escenario te saltan 6 monstruos poderosos (sin que el enemigo gaste 1 solo punto) listos para hacerte papilla. 

NOTA Y CONCLUSIÓN: 1 / 10 
Este es el peor juego (con mucha diferencia) de cartas que he tenido la desgracia de tocar. Sí, de inicio un par de horas (tutorial y alguna campaña inicial) parece llevadero, incluso algo bueno pensando “Hey, es muy injusto, pero quizás así puedo sentirme como los héroes del libro luchando contra lo imposible” pero, tras horas y escenarios estúpidos donde sin importar lo que hagas a veces dependes más de la “bondad” del sistema para no machacarte a efectos mortales de cartas (o lluvia de monstruos)…pues, te das cuenta de la basura que esto resulta. 

Mejor compra otros juegos de cartas, cualquiera es mejor que esto.

I played card game but hard to find people to play with you this was popular when all the card games came into being from X-GEN after MAGIC the Gather which I played in college created a market for any card games now during post 2000s however Lord of rings appears to have less rules than Magic the Gather  since literally every SIX months Magic the gathering add a new system into the game.  That being said this GAME doesn't define what these systems do for example BLOCK, AMBUSH, GUARD even with tutorial it doesn't even explain these core concepts since words don't match other games like Magic the gather.  So in that regard the PC game fails IMO.  If you never played games similar to MAGIC the Gathering you have zero clue.  Now even I have and first few hrs I am still trying to figure out what BLOCK does appears to maybe cut your damage in half, threat level extra.   The ability to get cards IMO is very broken especially for a single player.  You can't easily get points and ability to get cards to progress is very difficult maybe more difficult by not knowing what terms mean.   I tried to look for a DICTIONARY built in for last few hrs but never found it until several hours into the game being inside SETTINGS for dictionary.  Yet they could literally have a HOVER on card or dictionary instead it's buried three clicks in via settings and allows no method of keeping that up or hot key. You have to close it to go back to the game then repeat again if you find another word on card what does that now mean?  But overall doesn't have much in way of cards and yet have secret ways to get cards for each hero which is annoying.   The achievements or methods of getting these should be shown in game such as use this ability 25 times then get this and have cards shown.  Yet literally you can not even see these cards until they unlock so you don't even know if worth unlocking.   Lastly the game lacking additional cards to make your deck powerful such as have different Frodos one of ordinary hero than second as elite which does something else this way Magic Kept their Color specific Plain Heros for their later years.   Of course I think lord of rings stopped after few expansions and died.  Mechanics were a bit wonky IMO with fate stuff.",1624752031,1626058988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The art in this game is really cool. Each mission is narrated before/after and in most cases during the missions as well. There are a lot of cards to unlock and cards tend to have a different feel to them with situations where one might be better for particular missions. 

Thats about all the good things I can say about it. As for some of the bad things .... Ohhh boy.
1) The home-screen UI: Its completely horrendous, probably because it was made to accommodate people playing the game on their phones. In order to go from editing your deck to the mission screen take many many clicks. It should just have a deck editor button at the top of the screen at all times while on the home screen, but they decided to have this gigantic tiles to navigate the menu (possibly to show off some cool art I don't know). But the end result is for someone who has played a lot of deck builders is frustration.

The other issue is when you relaunch the game its difficult to navigate where you left off last in the story. It should just have a continue button, but instead you have to click through about 4 screens (more if you clicked one or two wrong which is easy to do). JUST MAKE IT SIMPLE.

Ok so a few UI snafus, I could handle this but.....

2) Gameplay: The meat and potatoes of the game. It has some pretty great mechanics: Starting with a customizing 'fellowship' of 3 characters, Defending on any unit, Powers, Exploring to get unique events, Exploring to counter the AI's cards it all feels really smooth until.... well, it basically comes down to you controlling the board then moving on to the next event, then when the new event happens you have a superior force to handle the next event and it snowballs into an easy win. The missions are broken into 3-5 different locations and once you defeat the first location you move on to another with your same units you had out before (on the rare situation you may lose or gain a unit at the next location). So the general game plan is build up an overwhelming army on the first location, then travel and smooth sailing for the rest of the mission, maybe theres more nuance in later missions, but that seems to work all the time thus far (I played on the medium difficulty 2/3, maybe on the final difficulty its extremely challenging).

The game might be ok. I love card games but this one is not that exciting for me.",1618116548,1618116548,False,13,1,0.639540970325469971,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Заточена она в основном под одиночное прохождение, где вы силами свободных народов бьетесь против сил Саурона, и никак иначе. В  этом как плюс игры (ибо однотипные «дуэльки» с закосом под «Мотыгу» лично мне давно приелись), так и минус (кампаний тут не так уж много, а проходить одни и те же сценарии, только другой колодой, ну такое себе удовольствие). В целом напоминает эдакий настольный карточный «Аркхем», только в антураже Властелина Колец и несколько попроще, даже своя шкала безысходности есть. Разве что механика ближе к обычным карточным играм, да составляющегося из карт-локаций игрового поля нет.  Да, по сравнению с настольным оригиналом игра несколько изменена и упрощена, но как по мне оно и к лучшему, например, убрать явно избыточный параметр защиты и просто увеличить героям количество здоровья, как по мне было простым и элегантным решением.
	Из достоинств игры можно отметить красивое оформление (в кой-то веке не эксплуатирующее одну кинотрилогию), в меру оригинальный игровой процесс и неплохое разнообразие карт и их эффектов. Плюс тут вообще нет так «любимого» мной доната, все, что есть в игре,  приобретается за внутриигровую валюту, причем достаточно легко (кроме разве что двух бонусных героев, на них ценники непомерные). Из недостатков -  вышеупомянутый ограниченный контент да местами хромающий на обе ноги баланс, что, впрочем, для подобных вещей, так как здесь он не так важен, как в дуэльных играх. Ну и условия «выбивания» некоторых карт тоже такое себе (те, кто придумывал испытание для какого Арагорна – извращенцы). 
	Есть режим на двух игроков, но онлайн тут нынче мертвее пустошей мордорских, так что ежели возжелаете парного прохождение, то вам для этого дела понадобиться еще и верный товарищ. 
	Любителям красивых и нестандартных карточных игр всячески советую. А уж если вы любите то самый карточный «Аркхем», но он вам приелся (или же просто надоела непомерная жадность издателя этой игры), и вы искали чего-то похожего, но никак не могли найти, то берите, не прогадаете.

A flux of these came in 2015, when even major companies put heavy emphasis on releasing entries of this genre expecting huge income. Many actually became more successful than the original, mainly more and more people began playing games on their smartphones and due to the simpler rules used compared to MTG.
The physical version of [i]The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game[/i] was released in 2011 and besides being set in a very popular world, it displayed a fairly complex rule system. When its digital version came out to PC in 2019, it received storyline driven campaigns (similarly to MTG). Unfortunately it has one single major flaw: the total absence of player versus player mode.

The game offers 4 different types of content: 
1. Quick Play, a randomly generated short game against various opponents;
2. Adventures, or rather 'adventure' since (at the time of this review) it contains a single one only, named 'The Fords of Isen', which despite its length is a rather underwhelming experience, where we must stop an Orcish invasion with 2 overpowered Rohirrian heroes;
3. The main strength of the game with plot (!), the Campaigns, which contains 3 scenarios with 5-5 quests. After each beaten quest, a new card can be unlocked;
4. Encounters, with 3 high difficulty adventures, of which the most enjoyable one is The King of Carrion, where we must defeat a giant wolf possessed by a demonic entity.

According to the story (the Campaigns) spiders and orcs are gathering in Mirkwood, attacking human settlements. Our job is to rescue Bilbo, who they have also captured and to find out who's behind the disturbance.

At the beginning of each game, first we must choose 3 heroes with a deck of 30 cards, no more, no less and with a maximum of 2 copies of the same card. Each hero has strengths which make them useful (or outright mandatory) in certain missions and almost useless in others, except for Aragorn who due to his special ability - performing an extra action - is a welcome addition to any party throughout the entire game. Amongst the faces we can find (almost) all the important characters from Middle-Earth, with different attributes. Each hero belongs to one of the 4 spheres of influence: leadership, lore, spirit, or tactics. The combination of the spheres of our 3 heroes will define which cards we are allowed to pick. Some powerful cards will require us to select 2 or even all 3 of our heroes from the same sphere, but there's also something else we must consider: their race. This is very important since there are certain powerful cards that can enhance the abilities of characters belonging to a specific race and only they will get the benefits.

steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2393709633

There are 3 card types: ally, event and attachment cards. Ally cards summon followers, who are going to fight for us. Depending on their resource (mana points, of which we receive 3 at the beginning of each turn) cost, we can summon powerful allies, like Gandalf for example (unfortunately he leaves at the end of the turn he is summoned, which we can prevent by using the Narya card).
The most common card type is the event card, where basically all cards belong to that generate a certain effect, like healing, damage dealing or readying (we can use an ally again in the same turn). The preparation cards also fall under this category and these activate only when either us or Sauron acts, resulting in various effects, like preventing damage, exhausting characters or letting us reuse another event card for example.
The 3rd group, the attachment cards contain special upgrades, weapons and armor mostly, with which we can equip our characters, thus making them more powerful in combat (obviously we should use these on our heroes and most powerful allies).

So how does a battle look like? Our enemy, Sauron plays the cards and moves our opponents. To be honest, I'm not sure if he also has 30 cards just like we do, since I've never seen the AI running out of cards, which might happen to us during several longer quests. Although he also receives 3 mana/turn, it's important to note, that Sauron's cards are more powerful than ours, meaning he can summon stronger enemies for less resources (even on normal difficulty).
The number of our total cards, our deck is shown in the lower left corner - from which we can pull 2 random cards in every turn - along with our current mana (displayed by the large blue number). The little dots next to it show our active preparations and in the bottom we can see the cards that are in our hands (which can be played). We can hold a maximum of 9, if we get one more, we also have to destroy (discard) one. Unfortunately Sauron has very powerful treachery (the dark version of preparation) cards, which can destroy everything we have in our hands.
On each card its cost is displayed in the upper left corner and below its description. If we have an ally card (or a hero), the attributes are as follows: the blue axe represents the units combat skill, the yellow square is willpower, which is required to resolve objectives or battle spiritual enemies and finally the red shield shows health.
Objectives are special obstacles which are engaged by the willpower of our characters. Sometimes these offer and alternative to combat (such as finding an escape route instead of killing everyone), but often they MUST be solved in order to attain victory.
If we performed no action in a turn we can set our characters to guard (forces an enemy to attack them + dealing damage passively) or use their special power (if they have any). We can also spend willpower to boost our fate meter to unlock fate events, single-use effects unique to each quest and location to aid us. Sauron has a fate meter as well which charges on its own and he also uses these against us. Once his meter reaches 50 - he turns his gaze upon us - our game is over.

On higher difficulty the game gets insane: enemies have more health, Sauron gets 5 mana + draws 5 cards... our only hope is that the AI makes bad decisions. If we decide to play co-op: the game also gets significantly harder, but it is more fun nevertheless.

The graphics were a pleasant surprise since most card games have simple visuals. The detailed backgrounds of various locations add rather nicely to the atmosphere. The artwork of the cards are equally great just like the pictures acting as stationary cutscenes. I especially appreciated how the game managed to stay independent from the movies in regards of displaying original and authentic portraits (and voices!) for major characters. My only criticism is that many of the mentioned artworks differ in style (they were made by many artists) thus some have rather distinctive looks .
Both the voice-overs and the background audio are also spot on.

Despite the major flaw of not having a pvp-mode in a card game (the co-op is fun, but can't replace pvp) [i]The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game[/i] stands out from the crowd of its kind. The story driven campaigns are fun and the hero/sphere system along with the effects of the fate meter offer plenty of variety and more complexity than other run-of-the-mill card games. 
It really is a shame that an important feature was left out - especially since the game is fairly balanced and still receives updates from time to time - because this way, sooner or later players will turn to another card game which does offer a pvp mode.

PROS
+ plenty of variety, fairly complex rule system
+ great LotR atmosphere
+ nice artwork
+ hidden, unlockable cards

CONS
- no pvp

Deckbuilders are not my favorite mechanics (for boardgames), but it is light here, meaning you don’t have to be an expert. Some games say they have theme, this isn’t a game, it just is theme. I got this on sale for $8 I think, which was well worth the novel it is. And I mean novel as in a book, because you spend more time reading the story than actually playing. Or listening to it, and the narrators are top notch. This isn’t just a few throwaway backstory lines, it’s a story. 

The gameplay itself is clever enough with meaningful decisions and variety. I see it referred to as a puzzle where the deckbuilding helps you beat the puzzle. Not sure on that yet. I played the entire solo campaigns (3 campaigns of 5 adventures each) with the starter deck you do the tutorial with. I failed the last adventure of the last campaign and then looked up about changing your deck. Did that and won. 

I’ll probably do some of the other solo challenge stuff, but after that, not sure how much replayability there is or me. Still, it’s cool and glad I got it.

It's a fun singleplayer experience with varied difficulty options, I feel like it's an easy recommendation for people that are fans of both cardgames and LOTR.

One thing I do wish is that it was a bit more boardgame-y in regards to the AI (having every card have rules on them about what their preferred target is and such), instead of trying to have a normal cardgame AI.

-Single player content. Legitimate campaigns, challenges, and battles to play through.
-Decent tutorialization in the guise of a campaign
-Relatively easy to understand rules, with some strategic depth to the choices you make
-Voice acting during the story bits is decent

Cons:
-Poorly designed UI. The UI feels like it was designed with touch controls in mind. This is my biggest complaint.
-No tool tips. I should be able to hover over an effect on a card and see what it does. As it is now, it must be searched in the glossary which is slightly cumbersome to use.
-Repetitive music
-A rewards points system for (so far) cosmetic unlocks. I know there's a multiplayer component to the game, but this is still a con for me as it can easily turn into a microtransaction-y thing (i.e., pay X points for this new card).

It is a fun card based game and there are plenty of nuances to keep fans of this genre happy.

I will have to admit that the game is a bit glitchy here and there, but because the developers have tweaked it so that if you lose a battle or if there is a game ending glitch, you only have to restart at the beginning of the sub-level you are in - you don't have to restart at the beginning of the quest.  So, that was helpful in many situations of unfortunate death by the enemy or by Windows.

I am 9 hours into it and I have only played the single player part and I am enjoying it.  There is lots to unlock, lots of replay value to get all of the objectives and quests.  

There are a lot of achievements and I doubt I will be playing that long to try and get them all.  At the rate I am playing, it feels like you would have to put in some serious play hours to try and achieve all of the achievements.  I will work to play through the single player quests and that is probably all I will play.

It also feels like the developers could keep on adding content to this game because some parts fell like there is room for more.  From what I read, in 2020, they did add more DLC and content, bug fixes, and such.  I don't know if they will be continuing that or not.

When it comes to coop collectible card games this and Faeria are the only real options on the table and they are both good in their own way.

Secondary aspects:
This game offer some new stories from the LotR universe that fit nicely into lore. The cutscenes are just written text with hand drawn illustrations but the texts are ok and the voice over is significantly above average. The graphics and sounds can be seen in the videos and they do their job well. Some ideas they had about visualising quest are really neat.

Core gameplay:
The game offers quite a few cards that work well but while the range is big enough for the game to be fun (the devs proclaim 300+ cards which is probably true) the range is still not where it should be. In addition it is not the most complex game of its kind (and that keeps it from being excellent) and it suffer from mediocre scenarios (gameplay wise). It will take a while - even for more experienced players - to really understand the cards and the strengths of the ""spheres"" they are categorized into. This phase is great. Once you get an understand though... well... things do not change much after that. You can try a couple of decks from different ""spheres"" and mix those but ultimately you will min-max your way into a corner. This phase of discovery and experimentation lasts longer if you play coop, of course, because you can combine two decks. 

Conclusion:
The initial phase of discovery lasts all throughout the three main campaigns (if you change your deck and keep experimenting with ""spheres""). This means it is an easy recommendation. You will probably not re-play it though, unless you want to play it in coop mode as/with a casual player or with a child who will focus on the polish and lore.

The devs changed and the new devs delivered a free content drop that offered a SIGNIFICANTLY better/interesting/varied/dynamic experience than the three original campaigns. While the original campaigns were servicable and ""good enough"" (in particular in coop mode where those things tend to matter less) the new mini-campaign is excellent.

After finishing most of the content at least once, I felt this game deserved an objective review.

I, unfortunately, never played the physical LoTR Adventure card game, so I discovered this game with its digital version which, from what I have understood, is mostly the same in its base content but has original scenarios which change the rules or the flow.
As a Magic: The Gathering player and a Tolkien enthusiast, I was both very much interested and hesitant about this game, and only got it for a pitiful price from the Humble Bundle's [i]Asmodee Digital Tabletop 2gether bundle[/i].
And now that I have finally put my hands on it, I regret to have been so hesitant and ashamed to have bought it for so cheap.

Obviously, I was interested by this game because; Dwarfs rules, it's Middle-Earth, and a COOP strategic card game. The cooperative part being the cherry on top for me, as coop games are the most fun, entertaining and interesting for me.
And I was hesitant because; the oval design of the played cards on the board despises me (maybe am I biased because I dislike Heartstone) and the overall user interface looked not that great, which translates to me as not a good sign because from my large card games' experience it usually means a poor, not smooth game. And that it looked too simple, as I like complexe and deep strategical games.
But, of course, all of this is totally subjective to my own perception and preferences and could be very much unisgnificant for other players.

And, even though it is perfectible, the game proved me wrong on my reluctances and convinced me to get my hands on the physical game as soon as possible.


Here are my Pros and Cons;

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]It's challenging, for players interested in higher difficulties than the default one
[*]Sauron's resources and minions adapt to cooperative games, meaning it's harder in COOP.
[*]While not complicated, it's still a card game where strategy matters, so does deck building and synergies.
[*]It is a scenarized and narrative card game, meaning you don't just mindlessly fight up Sauron's minions, but there is adventure story and campaign to follow, listen or read. Which can be skipped, of course.
[*]Interesting and well done deck building limitations, turning around three Heroes leaders that could or could not be from the same attribut.
[*]While it has some non canonical elements, it's still true to Tolkien's work, and is a pleasant addition.
[*]It has a large amount of customisation, from card's back (both player and Sauron's one), player's avatar and audible emotes, to Heroes illustration.
[*]There is many unlockable cards or cosmetics to earn by playing.
[*]Illustrations are original and well done. Some audible emotes are original, and some of them are famous catchphrases from the movies.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]The user interface, while not problematic, seems more oriented for mobiles and tablets since we need to click at button to scroll down -opening up menus- and click at the top arrow button to scroll back up, and drag right and left to scroll the lines. It is confusing because it's a mix of button click and screen draging. and most of those screen drag could be on the same screen.
[*]The amount of cards is not much large. It is still sufficient to create many different decks and synergies but there is not enough in my book.
[*]Amount of content is decent but not large either. Apparently more is planned as scenarized Adventures, which is pretty good, at least the only one in game, as of now, is.
[*]Unlockable cards, particularily the Heroes' rewards, while engaging and challenging in some case, can also be the overkill RNG PITA. As well as some of them being not even worth any effort. It's killing all the fun that the challenge could grant at first.
[*]No customizable game. We cannot create a game and a card deck with custom rules and penalities, it is a missed opportunity, too bad !
[*]No way to know how to obtain certain cards before you actually complete their prerequists.
[*]No PvP. It would have been interesting to have a game mode letting us play as Sauron and interfere in other players quests. And letting us build a deck with Sauron's cards, of course.
[/list]

I would suggest to the Developpers to;
[list]
[*]Add more cards and heroes. 
[*]Rework or redesign the unlockable cards to have less RNG prerequists and some of them to be better cards.
[*]Add a codex or something that list all the quests' challenges and unlockable rewards. 
[*]Remove the oval frame around the cards on the board, to make something less cluttering. Let us have full art cards on board !
[*]Implement custom deck and game rules and penalities (singleplayer and coop), it would be awesome !
[*]Any mode letting us play as Sauron, and building deck with his cards.

The UI also could benefit from a redesign but I've read it is actually the result of a redesign and let's be honest, it's not important at all as long as it works.
[/list]


In conclusion, it's a game that I very much recomend to any one interested in a LoTR card game, a cooperative card game and a not too complicated but still challenging and strategical card game.

As an admirer and player of many collective card games. The one thing I have always enjoyed was the turn based quality and execution of some of the best card games in the world. I took a very fast look at this game in action and my first impressions were quite surprising and found some things that may need to improve
What I liked:
It's Tolkien alright: The voices, the narration, the wonderful artwork, card styles and play style is all the Lord of the Rings classics. Reminded me of when I read these tales to my kids. Well done.
Aesthetics: The look and feel is middle earth as well from the magic, the guards, themes, and even the terminology is all Rings. If you love Tolkien's classic you will admire the beauty of the presentation they have done. Story, Art, Voices, Characters all there for your enjoyment.
Terminology: Once you go through the tutorial, learn the different aspects of the game and you need to pay attention. You get a clean grasp of the base concept enough to build your own decks. 
Base: Its a great start to many expansions down the line. 
Simple Card Turns: You go, he goes in one turn movements. Child's play
Animation: Nice sounds and effects to each executed card.

What I feel can improve in time:
UI: The layout threw me off a bit and I found navigating at times to be a little difficult. Though you can highlight a card. Its text should be much larger and dynamic for the eye impaired. I sometimes felt lost which could be confusing to the young.
Mechanics: It's not their base system and card flow that I have issue. I warn that future expansions with too many mechanics could unbalance things. 
Depth: It is priced well with a good amount of content for that price and it was also nice to see them not do a CCG pay to win style game. However, it leaves you wanting much more  and that is good if they add much more. Otherwise you feel a little thirsty. 

Anti Hero Studios does a wonderful job with the Lord of the Rings CCG. Great hard work in its story that sticks to the great epic novel. There is a lot to like for the 'base' template introduction.

Game mechanic is a bit complex in the beginning, but with learning the satisfaction of playing and understanding the game only rises. Campaign, various other modes and expansions are well made. They have a very good replayability even for single players using offline mode - and I barely started the campaign with many hours still to go!

It's a niche game but it brings a lot of interesting concepts from LOTR LCG physical edition and tweak it in a fun, voice acting and nicely paced game.

I look forward to future content, that said the game packs more than enough at the moment to keep you on those and has nice sense of progression and reward to it.

While this game carries the same title and a lot folks coming to it have expectations that this is exact replica of physical, it's simply not. It plays in a very similar way, yet different and my opinion fairs better than core edition and first few expansions of physical edition ever did (not to mention it is by far more cheaper than physical edition ever was)

It's really fun (did i say that, already?) and brings forward something the physical edition could never,  narrative. Yeah sure some of you do immerse but most people play LOTR LCG for the sake of building the most efficient decks to beat this and that campaign. 

Well guess what? You get the best of both and since the game is back in tracks and no longer on hiatus, I warmly recommend it, especially to new comers who were turned away by steep price of Physical edition and some of the clunky, confusing and infamous  mechanics. (unlike with physical - I do too much comparison, but it's necassary; you won't spend hours and hours googling and browsing forums, reading FAQs and scratching the head on whatever or not you undestood the card description (everyone who plays physical edition knows what I mean)).

There is some awkwardness to it though, and it might not be for everybody.

The good:
++ The Tolkien's lore is really well integrated in the gameplay mechanics and in the multiple texts and story elements. It reminds me a bit more of the Hobbit (the book, not the awful movies) and less about TLOTR
++ A lot of gameplay variety. You create your own combinations of 3 heroes from a pool of 20, and build your deck of 30 cards around those heroes. Decks feel much more unique than in any card game I played previously
+ Art is good, but glitches and awkward UI will take your attention from it. Concept art in menus is better than the gameplay art.
+ Story is well narrated and the writing is not bad, but not great either in my opinion. It is the best I have seen in a card game except maybe for Gwent
+ Music is good, but repetitive after some time

The cons:
- No real choices in the campaign except for some rare options pick which does not influence anything in the long term (pick card A or card B). I would have liked to make important decisions. Go through the Moria or over the Caradhras? Save a village at the risk of losing the orcs you are pursuing? This kind of things.
- UI is awkward at best. You will see UI popping in and out of existence, I had light bugs where the goal of my quest would not display. The main menu is completely awful and should be started from scratch.

If you are a Lord of the Rings fan and find many of the games lacking the feel of Middle Earth or staying true to style and content of the books, I find this is the best game in some time to achieve this well. 

Firstly, when you buy the game it comes with all cards in it and all campaigns. There is no paying for extra cards using real life cash. However, you start with a base set of cards and can unlock cards by earning in game points. This works well as it gives a sense of progression in terms of your decks, and means even if you fail a campaign, you may gain enough points to improve your deck.

Pros:
 - Great variety in quests/campaigns. Its not just about combat, there is fate system and objectives in each battle. The style and method to win varies and you will find yourself tweaking your deck and play style to suit. This keeps the game fresh and interesting.
 - The decks and cards - lots of good heroes and cards to use and unlock. There are types of cards but I refer to them as their colours (red, blue, green, purple etc). Depending on which colour a hero is (you can take 3 per deck), dictates what cards you can select. If you have two of one colour in terms of hero it unlocks cards more in that colour's specialism. This leads to a lot of nice variety and options in decks
 - As mentioned before, this feels like Lord of the Rings in terms of lore and style. The stories are decent enough and interesting
 - In mission events really can add to the fun and difficulty.
 - Hard enough to be a good challenge (if you don't play on standard)
 - New owners who plan to add new content and campaigns. They already altered one aspect where if you lost one mission inside a campaign it always set you back to the very start. This was very challenging. Now you can retry a failed mission from the state you started it in. This is a better way for the game to work as, while I liked the harsh challenge from before, it did put you off playing at points.

Cons:
 - Like most deck games, there are cards and hero's which become a must have like Arwen but its not that bad and you can succeed with many different decks
 - The menu system is a bit clunky and not nice to use. Feels like it was made more for a touchscreen device. However, in game is absolutely fine so this is a very minor gripe.

He starts with more cards in hand, 2-3x the resource to cast those cards, unit's atleast = to your starting amount, add to that the random shit that his locations do if you don't get rid of them (usually requiring wasting 2 attacks just to get rid of one) free shit that he gets it seems every other turn because you haven't beaten that episode fast enough, limitation on amount of units you can control while there is no such stipulation on his side, it all adds up to having no feeling of accomplishment when/if you beat a level, you just feel as though you were cheaper than the game. maybe some people like that feeling, i do not.

Le jeu est agréable à prendre en main, grâce à un design magnifique, une bonne narration et une excellente atmosphère. Cependant, il y a de gros défauts de mécaniques de jeu et d'ergonomie.

Ergonomie.
- Très mauvaise traduction FR, avec même des portions non traduites.
- Un menu principal très pénible où il faut faire défiler les écrans pour revenir.
- Beaucoup de mot-clés de capacités n'apparaissant pas au survol de la souris. Obliger d'ouvrir le glossaire très souvent.
- Le deckbuilder ne retient pas les informations de filtrage précédentes. Il faut recliquer sur les mêmes boutons chaque fois qu'on ouvre le constructeur.

Mécaniques de jeu.
- Le jeu contraint le joueur a faire un deck de 30 cartes exactement. De façon systématique, mon deck est vide durant les deux dernières séquence d'une campagne. Soit il fallait remélanger la défause au deck entre chaque séquence, soit il fallait laisser au joueur la possibilité de faire des decks plus volumineux, en gardant la valeur de 30 cartes comme minimum.
- Quelque chose foire dans le système d'alternance des actions : une action du joueur, puis celle de l'IA. En faisant ainsi, les seules actions possibles sont toujours les mêmes, provoquer des blocages afin de protéger ses alliés plus fragiles et infliger des dégats de contre. Autrement dit, pas de choix, pas de possibilité de jouer des cartes par exemple, si ce n'est après avoir subit toutes les attaques. Seul moyen d'avoir un peu de marge : déclarer des bloqueurs avant de voyager. Toujours déclarer un ou deux bloqueurs avant la fin d'une phase. Mais cela est bancal et pas toujours possible.
- Débloquer de nouvelles cartes est si lent...
- Tout cela provoque de la frustration et de la répétitivité, plutôt que du plaisir à déployer ses tactiques, jouer des cartes ou des capacités, calculer une stratégie d'ensemble lors d'une phase.

I did not play this game on PC first. I've spent the last few months playing it on PS4. I bought this game on PSN, on sale at the lowest price it has ever been, and was expecting a rather run of the mill Hearthstone clone that was likely abandoned.
3 months later, here I am picking up a copy on Steam so I can play Fords of Isen and give bug reports and feedback to the Devs, who are not only friendly but have given me hope for post-launch revivals as a whole. The tight knit communication that the Devs have had with their community in reviving this, the absolute transparency, [spoiler]except for the rewards of this new mode (but those are a secret for people to react to][/spoiler], all of it has given me hope for this market as a whole. That games don't have to burn out due to being Games as a Service, but they can be revamped and even bolstered by new content and bug fixing. This game has given me optimism I long since felt died out inside me.
This review says 8 hours. I didn't stop playing until I started writing up this review. I wanted to see the new content and I wanted to know my faith in this Dev was validated. It was.
8 hours on PC, And I'll one day find out how much on PS4. But it's for sure triple digits.
So yeah, get this game. Even if you don't play it now, it's evolving. You'll come back to even more content and even more QoL updates.
I've nominated this game as the 2020 Labor of Love for The Steam Awards.

Fantasy Flight Games 보드게임사의  원작인 The Lord Of The Rings : Living Card Games인데

이미지와 아주 기본적인 룰만 가져왔을 뿐, 모든 것을 새로 만들었다고 해도 과언이 아닙니다.

하지만 카드게임에 있어서 가장 중요한 것은 역시 카드풀이죠. 수많은 카드를 통한 덱 빌딩과 매우  많은 퀘스트들을 깨는 반복성이 매력인데, 이 게임은 아쉽게도 컨텐츠가 매우 부족합니다. 영웅 수도 많이 부족하구요.

아마 그 문제는 리모델링에서 온다고 생각합니다. 캐릭터를 다시 창조해야 하기 때문에, 시간이 많이 들겠죠.

룰도 마찬가지입니다. 원작도 매우 어려운 룰에 속하는 편인데 여기에는 새로운 용어가 더욱 추가되어서 적응하는데 어려움을 주고 있습니다. 원작에서 Response, Will, Explore, Exhaust, Shadow, Objective같은 매력적인 요소가 빠져있고, Guard, Ranged 등의 개념도 뒤바뀌어 원작을 기대했던 팬들에게는 아쉬움을 많이 남겼습니다.

이미 돌이킬 수 없게 되었지만 이 게임이 좀 더 흥하게 되려면 영웅의 수를 매우 많이 늘려야 하고 그에 맞게 카드와 켐페인. 나아가 Nightmare도입을 현실감있게 해야 합니다. 난이도를 단순히 몹의 체력 변경으로 끝내는 것은 너무 합니다.

Das kommt leider mit kleineren Wartezeiten daher (wie Lags), aber ist noch ok.
Zu zweit macht das Spiel Spaß und erinnert an die nicht-digitale Vorlage.

Ich habe jetzt alle Kampagnen und Herausforderungen durchgespielt. Die Herausforderungen waren echt Spaßig. Die dritte Kampagne war unfreiwillig komisch. Die ersten drei Abenteuer wirkten wie eine schlechte Komödie und waren für mich unpassend. Das liegt zu großen Teilen an der deutschen Übersetzung, die wohl gewollt witzig daherkommen soll. ""Hinz"" und ""Kunz"" sind nur zwei der furchtbaren Namen, die für die englischen genommen wurden...

Der männliche Sprecher in der dritten Kampagne weiß deutlich besser zu gefallen als einer aus den anderen, den ich störend fand.

Die dritte Kampagne war storytechnisch (und vor allem bei der Übersetzung) besonders enttäuschend.
Spielerisch gab es doch einige Herausforderungen und Neuerungen. Aber insgesamt schienen mir die früheren Abenteuer abwechslungsreicher.

Schade.

Es bleibt aber die Hoffnung auf viele Besserungen. Ein neuer Entwickler hat übernommen und will z.B. den Online-Zwang entfernen. Dieser existiert nur, weil das Spiel als F2P-Titel geplant war.
Somit hoffe ich auf viele Verbesserungen zumindest für künftige Abenteuer.

Ferner hoffe ich auf viele weitere Erweiterungen und Stories der Vorlage, sodass die vielen nervigen Grind-Achievements alleine durch das Spielen der kommenden Inhalte sich ergeben und nicht stupide 500x das einfachste passende Abenteuer immer wieder wiederholt werden muss...

Weil das Spiel durchaus Spaß macht, besonders zu zweit mit Sprachchat (Danke Steam!), gibt es noch eine Empfehlung trotz der Mängel.

Edit: Es gibt keinen Online-Zwang mehr! Die neue Menüoberfläche ist wohl für Handys gestaltet. Ich brauche viel mehr Klicks um irgendwo hinzukommen und um wieder zurückzukommen nochmal genauso viele. Da war die Weltkarte viel praktischer, sobald man sie verstanden hatte. Das ganze wäre etwas weniger schlimm, wenn bei großen Auflösungen wenigstens mal alle Abenteuer eine Kampagne zu sehen wären...
Die Herausforderungen und Belohnungen können auch nicht mehr so komfortabel eingesehen werden.
Hat man versehentlich das falsche Abenteuer einer Kampagne ausgewählt, muss man mit der Levelauswahl nochmal von Vorne beginnen. Total umständlich.

I was watching the slow spiral of development with this game and feel thankful that I waited to pull the trigger till now. I'm excited to see the new developer's roadmap and I'm confident they can turn this game around. It won't be the smash-it Hearthstone-killer that Fantasy Flight hoped it would be, but at least it will be a playable, decent game.

Below is my view on what bad happened to this game...
The history of this game should be taught in a class if you want to a perfect example of how to alienate a loyal fan-base for a board game when you try to go digital.

Mistake #1: Know your audience

When this game was first announced, I was pumped. Like man, I was a huge fan of the original LCG and LCGs in general because of the huge middle finger they give to the pay-to-win TCG industry. But that was lost in the original development of this game. Someone at Fantasy Flight must have been salivating at the idea of turning this product into a microtransaction-laden cash cow, which in turn, really doomed the game from the start. Not to say your audience is cheap (buying all the sets for the paper LCG will still cost you over $1K USD) but they demand quality and value if they're going to shell out that cash. You burned them with trying to nickle and dime for small packs or huge sums for not enough content.

Mistake #2: Not everything needs to be Steam Early Access. 

Your audience is statistically going to be older than other IPs. Statically, your audience are adults, many with job and family responsibilities and not a lot of time to waste on a half-finished product. They're not twitch stream that are going to promote your half-finished game, and have a light-hearted laugh with their fans at your bugs. Instead, these people are going to try your game once, and if they're not impressed, go spend their precious time with something else.

Mistake #3 No online and co-op from the start with little emphasis on player interaction. 

This is a game meant to be played with others. This shouldn't have been something introduced so late in development and with almost no tools for player coperation

There's a distinct lack of cards to play with for a card game that's been out for over a year now. Why is Gloin only available in the tutorial and not a playable hero? Where's Thalin? Why are there three leadership sphere dwarf heroes and one tactics dwarf hero? Why do reward cards for characters have spheres that don't match that hero? I saw that another company is playing on taking over now that Fantasy Flight Interactive closed, whether or not they turn this ship around remains to be seen.

After playing more there doesn't seem to be much balance in regards to some heroes. For example, Dwalin gets a plus +1 to attack and willpower as long as he remains above 6 health. This works great until the game starts you against 3 enemy characters who deal 2-3 damage and then summon another 2-3 characters. The enemy will always have 3 resources to spend each round (the player only gets 3) and at least 4 cards to choose from (the player only draws two per round) and I'm not sure if any card they play costs more than 1 resource, many seem to cost 0.

Heroes like Dain need to be re-balanced. Currently he  provides +1 attack to dwarves and only dwarves. I don't find him to be a viable option unless you're building a dwarf only deck which you should only be doing if you're going for the achievement. Dwarves on their own are pretty lackluster, limiting you to 3 leadership heroes and 1 tactics hero. Why they had an achievement built around using only dwarves is beyond me but significantly worse is the one for Silvan characters when there's only two Silvan characters to use.

I also find the number of heroes required to play certain cards of certain spheres to be ridiculous. 

The cruel torturer and the 4 locations with 4 progress he spawns during The Mirror of Galadriel are heavily unbalanced to the point where I quit to main menu when he pops up.

Achievements are extremely grindy AND bugged, the ones for playing only certain types of characters being the biggest offenders I've seen. I find these achievements in particular (Dwarves, Noldor only) to be extremely frustrating to complete given the lack of cards and the sheer amount of completions required.",1599686711,1604440579,False,54,0,0.714298486709594727,4,False,False,False,False,,,

In this review, I'd like to break down the core gameplay elements and mention some the main differences compared the card game which I own (at least partially because it's mostly out of print these days). 

This game is essentially a deck builder in which you construct a deck of cards consisted by allies and events which help you overcome the quests during the campaigns of the game which is set in Tolkiens famous universe. Basically, you gain ressources in order to play cards which have various values, some cards manipulate the battlefield or your heroes. Many cards have unique effects which have synergies or actions which benefit you, the same applies to your opponent. The game is actually a solo or cooperative experience which sends you on a journey against Sauron, who tries to throw everything at you to make your adventure into a nightmare. Meanwhile, you also have to manage a threatmeter which increases steadily over time and causes nasty surprises to be thrown into your way. Additionally, there are other more nuanced mechanics suchs as guarding, generating faith points to unlock special cards, questing and many other things.

So, is this game worth it and for you? I would certainly say that this is a solid card game especially if you like Tolkiens universe. The game drips with well written dialogue and a nice narration which really sets the mood, many characters and locations are very familiar to those who enjoy the Tolkien unvierse. Definitely recommended for fans of the books. Overall, it's a very atmospheric package.

The game offers a tutorial, 3 main campaigns which are consisted by 5 scenarios, then some additional challenge quests and some other modes. This sounds like a lot but actually, it's pretty limited considering that the physical card game has tons of content. This game offers a decent amount of content but it might be lacking for some. Although I'd like to state that the game can be tough and it will take some time to complete quests. Furthermore, if you like customizing your decks, this game has a neat deckbuilding mode which allows to build your deck. Some player might dislike this but it's still an integral part of the game experience.

That aside, the gameplay experience is smooth and slick, nothing really to complain on a technical level. Additionally, the game has a terrific musical score and good voice acting which enhance the game experience.

There are some major changes from the physical game, notably the following:

-The ressource system has been streamlined and does not require ""sphere"" ressources for individual cards, you have a pool and just require heroes of a sphere in order to play cards
-The physical game has a 7 phase turn order where the game plays against you in a predetermined way with some randomness. The digital version has an active AI player which emulates playing against an active opponent similar to other card battling games. Turns are not as predictable and the AI switches up the tactics. 
-The cards themselves are very different in their effects compared to the physical counterparts, gameplay mechanics are changed or switched up for various heroes and cards.
-Some gameplay mechanics that exist in the physical card game have been streamlined into newer mechanics which provide a smoother experience (such as treachery cards).

I admit that the digital version feels less complex in some regards but the game plays a lot faster and smoother, having an active Sauron opponent which emulates a player was a bit jarring at first mostly because it deviates a lot from the physical counter part. That said, it makes only sense and suits the game well. I came to like it in the end.

Fortunately, the developpers decided to include all the dlcs into this package which makes it already a complete experience. But it's noticeable that the devs intended to sell adventure packs in the game to expand the game. Although it appears that the devs have recently changed after the game had died down, new content and changes are on the horizon. So it might be promising to get into this game.

Compared to other card games that might exist, this one feels a bit limited in it's scope. The community does not seem that active and there has not been much content recently. But you still might get a good amount of value out of this game after completing the main quests.

Definitely recommended for LotR fans who are into deckbuilding card games.",1598392760,1611368347,True,6,0,0.592111647129058838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The three quests and encounters took me about 20 hours to complete. Due to large amount of customization and incentives for different play-styles (honestly, there are so many ways you could approach the game), my initial interest lasted a total of 25 hours. At that point I moved to the medium difficulty... which was a mistake, because this game is VERY challenging. I got frustrated after losing some very close quests in the final encounter stages and left it for a few weeks. When I came back to it I made the decision to embrace the ""easy"" (which still can be difficult) tier of difficulty, and it has been my best decision regarding the game. As a casual gamer I find this game very easy to pick up for a 40 minute round a couple of times per week. The hero rewards (additional cards to reward a hero after accomplish certain scenarios) and the deck building features give it two major points for replayability. As a Tolkien fan, as well as a fan of the board game version, I am very satisfied with how this game plays. It has the charm of Tolkien, and it streamlines the sometimes overcomplicated aspects of the tabletop version. The closure of the studio that created this game was disheartening, but it has been recently picked up by a new studio which is very exciting. Their roadmap looks to add a lot more to this game over the next year, so I would highly recommend this game to Tolkien fans looking for an immersive challenge. Worth the money.

A comienzos de año conocíamos la noticia de que Fantasy Flight Interactive echaba el cierre, por lo que [i]The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game[/i] no volvería a recibir contenido ni actualizaciones de ningún tipo. Parecía que el juego estaba muerto. No obstante, Asmodee Digital hacía oficial ayer que Antihero Studios continuará con su desarrollo, lo cual es sin duda una grandísima noticia y lo que ha motivado esta reseña.

Nos encontramos por tanto ante un nuevo y esperanzador comienzo, a pesar de que los desarrolladores que se harán cargo de este título a partir de ahora son totalmente desconocidos y aparentemente no tienen ningún bagaje en la industria (yo, al menos, no he encontrado apenas información acerca de ellos en la red).

Confío, no obstante, en que vayan a incluir más contenido, empresa que no debería de ser excesivamente complicada teniendo en consideración que este juego bebe de las mecánicas del LCG publicado en formato físico, que cuenta con incontables expansiones y contenido que podría ser empleado para ampliar el disponible en esta modalidad digital. A no ser, claro, que FFG no permita publicar expansiones en la línea de su juego físico. En cualquier caso, el anuncio ha sido muy escueto y todavía es pronto para sacar conclusiones, por lo que solo podemos especular.

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
-Un juego de cartas diferente a todos los que has podido ver hasta el momento y en el que las mecánicas no están enfocadas tanto a ganar partidas, sino a completar desafíos y, en suma, a vivir aventuras.
-Estamos ante un deckbuilding que, por el momento, cuenta con un nutrido número de cartas a las que podrás ir accediendo a medida que completes desafíos y consigas monedas para desbloquearlas. Gran variedad de personajes para crear tus mazos temáticos (dúnedain, elfos, hobbits, etc.), aunque obviamente no llega al nivel del clásico SATM.
-Puede parecer que el juego, tal y como está ahora mismo, carece de contenido. Nada más lejos. Si bien solo cuenta con 3 campañas (sin contar la del tutorial), cada una de ellas tiene 5 misiones largas y perfectamente rejugables para probar nuevos mazos y estrategias. Al mismo tiempo, podemos jugar otros desafíos y partidas aleatorias, lo que nos brinda más horas de juego.
-La posibilidad de jugarlo en modo cooperativo es un puntazo. Esto seguramente eche para atrás a parte del público que no encontrará aquí un juego de cartas competitivo al estilo de [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i]. 
-Muy buena narrativa que nos hace sumergirnos de lleno en las partidas, con escenarios bien ambientados en la Tierra Media.

[h1]Contras: [/h1]
-Incluso en single player, a día de hoy sigue siendo imposible jugarlo sin conexión.

Lo cierto es que pocos ‘peros’ más le puedo encontrar al juego, que es sumamente entretenido y hará las delicias de los fans del universo creado por J. R. R. Tolkien. Lo único que espero es que a partir de ahora no nos bombardeen a DLCs que hagan que los jugadores dejen de jugarlo y den con una fórmula interesante para que los desarrolladores saquen beneficios no únicamente a costa de que quienes confiamos en el proyecto tengamos que volver a invertir demasiado. El juego tiene potencial y me encantaría que volviera a llenarse de vida.

La pregunta puñetera: ¿dejará de llamarse ‘Definitive Edition’ al recibir nuevo contenido?

- Campaign involves almost no interaction, from time to time you can choose a branching path but that's it
- The card game itself is slow/tedious, 1 move per turn, not as many moves as you can fit in per turn like a Hearthstone or Spire
- Difficult with no sense of progress

The mechanics of the underlying game are interesting, and they could have been used to make a much more compelling product. I played through the tutorial and the first campaign, and I thought, ""That was pretty fun. I could do that 10 more times."" but then I noticed that there are only three campaigns. This was surprising, because one of the most notable things about playing the game is the constant achievement progress popups, so I was assuming that there was a lot of content to get through, since they have achievements for dealing thousands or damage or using abilities a ton of times, things like that.

It seems like you're expected to replay the missions over and over with different decks, and that's not a horrible idea. Some of the quests can be accomplished different ways, so you can beat them using different styles of decks. But not every quest can be beaten that way, and it's really annoying playing through a four or five battle sequence just to get to something that hard counters your deck format, and ending up getting nothing for that time spent (except for increasing those achievement counters).

But then, even when you do complete the quests, are the rewards worth it? Not really. You can unlock a card or two to use in your custom decks the first time you beat each segment of a campaign, and you also get an in-game currency that you can use to ""buy"" other card unlocks, but this is really one of the parts of the game they messed up the most. You have to pay to unlock pretty boring cards that you would just need to use as filler in your deck. You don't unlock any additional ""heroes"" (as far as I can tell) which are the biggest ways to influence how you play the game. I think they needed to handle card unlocking completely differently, and probably have more interesting cards available, once I looked at the scope of what was possible, I lost all interest in grinding it out.

There are also some weird UI quirks - some apparent soft locks or situations where it's extremely unclear what to click on to continue playing the game. I didn't have it as bad as a lot of other players, but it's definitely got some jank to it. 

If they significantly increased the amount of single-player content, changed the way that you unlock cards, and gave you more interesting cards to unlock, then it would be a hit for me, but right now, it's just not scratching that itch.",1590896899,1590896899,False,5,0,0.566339552402496338,0,False,False,False,False,,,

HORRIBLE. I just bought it not realizing that development is since defunct. The game keeps freezing and ""hanging"" in different parts of the tutorial, completing bricking it. I kept having to shut it down and restart each tutorial level from the beginning. Rewards glitched and would not show up. Due to this random timing of the bug, I ended up going over 2 hours for the refund and Steam will not refund despite the fact that the game is broken, and not being supported.

Sam  Guard時+1Attack、敵撃破時相手の行動ポイント-1(ラウンドごと1回)
Fredegar Bolger  味方をGuard状態にする特殊能力を使える。回復が強いLore勢力
序盤はアイテムも種類が少ないので、BlockやCounter、ラウンド毎回復をSamに集中させて1ラウンド2回Guardをしてもらってしのぐデッキになります。

J'aime bien ce jeu et y suis revenu à maintes occasions. Toutefois, je trouve le gameplay peu dynamique du fait que je passe un certains temps à évaluer les bonnes actions à prendre. Au départ j'ai trouvé le jeu difficile, mais à force d'y jouer et de le comprendre, je trouve maintenant l'expérience plus agréable. Perso, je skip les narrations.

J'aurais donc quelques recommandations pour de nouveau joueurs.

1) Ne soyez pas timide de commencer les quêtes en mode facile (récit). Vous comprendrez pourquoi au 2e point.
2) Dans ce jeu vous jouez contre le deck de Sauron et donc la qualité de votre deck et son efficacité à gagner dépend de sa synergie et de la force des cartes qui s'y trouve. En complétant des quêtes en mode facile, vous gagnerez des points qui peuvent être utilisé pour acheter de nouvelles cartes qui augmenterons l'efficacité de votre deck. Il est donc difficile de remporter en mode médium et hard avec un deck de base. Raison pour la quelle je vous recommande de faire les quêtes en mode facile d'abord. Sinon vous trouverez que le jeu est punitif et vous apprécierez moins l'expérience.
3) Les différents scénarios encouragent différents types de stratégies. Par exemple, dans certains scénario, Sauron produira plusieurs créatures. Dans d'autres, il y aura plusieurs ""épreuves"" qui incite à avoir des personnages avec un chiffre jaune plus élevé. Depuis que j'ai compris que pour gagner, je dois m'adapter, l'expérience est meilleur. Je recommande donc de faire plusieurs decks avec différentes stratégies. Choisissez le deck qui semble le plus adapter à vaincre le scénario. Si vous faites comme moi dans mes 10er heures de jeu et tenter de vaincre tous les scénario avec votre seul et unique deck et bien vous aurez de la difficulté.

Le jeu est en Definitive Edition. Je ne sais pas si ça veut dire qu'il est terminé. J'espère que ce n'est pas le cas car selon moi plus que les 3 extensions actuelles devait être prévu.

Je recommande le jeu. Il faut s'attendre toutefois à une expérience plutôt nerdie comparativement à des jeux comme Magic Arena.",1587776435,1587776914,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game had a rocky start and didn't hold up well in it's initial release. However, there was a recent (free) expansion that has vastly improved the quality of the game. It's been highly addicting the last few weeks of game play.

I would call my self a competent tactical gamer, and i find the difficulty to be fairly brutal. The new card pool made it a little more level, but it's challenging.

You control 3 good heroes, and have a deck of 30 cards to fight Sauron's deck with. It's quest based, each quest having a few stages with different objectives to proceed. Victory unlocks cards and gets you coin, which can you unlock yet more cards with. 

I've had 2 glitches in the past 50 hrs of game play.
-1 lock up where i had to exit the level and restart because no cards would respond.
-1 game lock up because i minimized it for a few hours.

Primero que todo no se parece en nada a YuGiOh, o Hearthstone. Si quizas bebe algo de lo que es Magic, pero tampoco se le asemeja. LOR ACD es un juego de cartas muy estrategico, donde no gana el que tiene mejores cartas como ocurre en otros juegos de este genero. Si no que gana el que sabe mejor ocupar el mazo, aca ni siquiera la suerte es factor para ganar o perder una partida. Si sabes administrar bien tus recursos es suficiente.
Otro detalle que hace muy llamativo al juego es que cada partida cuenta una historia, y en cada historia debes ir completando misiones que influyen directamente en la trama. Doy un ejemplo. Primero te ves luchando con unas arañas, durante esta pelea Bilbo pierde su bolso, por lo que decide buscarlo junto a un par de enanos y un Elfo.Debes avanzar a un par de locaciones, he investigarlas. Todo eso se logra pagando puntos. Pero es mejor que aprendas esto jugando, porque explicarlo por aca es un poco engorroso.
A mi parecer es el mejor juego de cartas que hay para jugar en Solitario, ya que es complicado sin llegar a ser imposible. Ademas de dar la idea de estar leyendo un libro interactivo mientras juegas.

游戏的画风还是比较还原电影的人物形象的，卡牌的美工极其优秀，感觉就是直接用了电影里人物的经典形象，但是游戏的其他方面感觉就比较一般般了，场景看上去比较粗糙，攻击特效也是比较简陋。
作为一款18年的游戏，游戏中卡牌攻击的特效和打击感甚至不如13年就出来的炉石传说。
不过用魔戒作为吸引粉丝的卡牌游戏，在人设的表现上相当优秀，所以整体在画面上给个好评吧。
[b]游戏性[/b]
《指环王：卡牌冒险》是一款由Fantasy Flight Interactive制作，Asmodee Digital发行的以指环王为题材的策略卡牌游戏。
游戏的背景是基于指环王原著所建立的魔幻世界。
在游戏中，玩家将响应未知冒险的召唤，直面索伦的黑暗势力，为了保护中土世界的和平，开启属于自己的冒险之旅。
玩家可组建英雄牌库，挑战索伦的军队。可进行单人游戏，也可与好友组队，探索著名场景，完成故事情节任务，打造玩家专属的中土传奇。
游戏用原著上的人物用卡牌的形式展现出来，基本上原著中有名有姓的英雄在游戏里都成了英雄卡，而一些特殊的部队则成了侍从卡。
刚刚开始玩的时候，我还以为战斗是和炉石一样，每个人的魔法值用完并结束就轮到对手这样的游戏模式。
但是没想到，游戏的玩法和炉石还是有些区别的--比起卡牌游戏，更有些回合制游戏的意思。
你问回合制是什么意思？
简单来说，魔法值用来召唤侍从或者英雄，魔法的卡牌，这个和炉石没什么区别，但是回合制的原因就在于，召唤出的侍从或者英雄行动一次就算一个回合，接下来就换成敌人行动，等到双边可以行动的单位都没了之后，这一轮才结束，进入新的一轮。
卡牌版本的你打我一下，我打你一下！
这样就让玩家想要一波流带走敌人的愿望落空了。
但是相对的，游戏形式的转变，让玩家每一回合都需要考虑和计算更多的东西。
游戏的一些英雄卡牌有技能或是特殊能力用来代替炉石里面的回血和嘲讽等能力，魔法值可以累计，这样就可以在下一轮打出更高费的牌。
游戏有剧情模式，可以更好了解游戏所采用的剧情设计，每个任务都有多个关卡，只有通过“最后遭遇”，进行旅行，任务才能胜利。
剧情里面，敌人会使用一些魔法牌或者是是己方人物的威胁值来增加索伦的警觉值，警觉值达到五十，如果手牌里没有能够降低警觉值的卡牌，就会被判定失败。
除此之外，剧情还有一些不同的任务，有的关卡需要击败特定敌人，有的需要我方在几轮下不失去全部英雄，并不是杀死全部敌人就能获胜 。
胜利之后，玩家可以得到金钱用来购买卡牌背景等装饰，还可以自定义牌组和语音。
游戏有中文，翻译的相当到位。
[b]声音[/b]
游戏中的配音和对白十分地道，确认是有种让人看指环王电影的感觉。
配乐也是相当的优秀，这方面一般的卡牌游戏都是比不了的。
声音给个好评。
[b]评分[/b]
7/10
作为一个粉丝向的卡牌游戏，玩的人还是比较少的，服务器虽然可以裸连，但是基本碰不到人。
虽然有剧情模式，但是内容也并不多，再加上“极其丰富”的内购内容。
emmmm.....
比较推荐粉丝购买吧。

[h1] 点亮烽火丘......正在集结伙伴.......正在敲响战鼓.......搜寻夏尔人...... [/h1]
·游戏目前只有三个战役扩展，悲~~游玩推荐加速器，裸连可用steamcommunity 302配合热点等一系列骚操作解决。
·游戏目前更改的貌似区别于之前的版本了，采取了买断制的方式(除了原声dlc）。目前在游戏中，玩家无需通过购买卡包等额外付费方式进行卡牌和英雄的解锁和收集，而是采取友谊点数进行解锁，点数可以通过游玩对局进行获得，卡牌和花里胡哨的装饰灯基本上都能靠肝获得，算是不错的改进措施。（部分卡牌作为通关奖励获得）
·游戏一开始，可以依靠点数解锁全部20名英雄,魔戒持有霍比特四人组、阿拉贡、阿尔玟、金雳、法拉米尔等经典人物都作为可操控英雄供你游玩，值得一提的是，甘道夫是作为有着“一闪而逝”特性的孟优卡牌登场，游戏对于IP的梗处比较多，魔戒粉入手这款游戏是个很棒的选择。
·可以进行单人游戏，也可与好友组队合作，探索著名场景，完成故事情节任务，打造专属与你的中土传奇~
[h1]索伦之眼注视着你，等待着你慢慢走向死亡~[/h1]
游戏主打的是剧情探索的pve式卡牌对战哦！玩家卡牌主要分为英雄/盟友/装备/魔术等，而索伦则有更多类型的卡牌！
具体术语可以进入游戏中的词表进行阅读，下面主要讲下单人模式的玩法，游戏的玩法非常丰富，可玩性也很高，不过总体来说并不复杂，可能是卡牌比较少吧。
·操控三名英雄共同抵抗索伦的军队，游戏中。英雄分为领导型/战术型/精神型三大类。战术型注重攻击，精神型注重意志力，领导型处于俩者中间。同样的，卡组中卡牌的选择，需要符合你所选择的英雄类型，部分卡牌需要你携带相同类型的英雄才能上场！而不同的英雄除了类型以及自身技能不同外，还有独特的种族值设定，某些卡牌也会受到种族的影响哦。
·游戏战斗中，采取的是你打一张、我打一张的独特战斗轮盘(没有先手不能攻击，开局英雄自动上场，而索伦的怪物也早就整备完成)，等双方都没有“法力”或没有进一步操纵手段了就会进入休整阶段，然后开始新一轮战斗.....游戏貌似没有烧条的措施，所以可以慢慢思考。和一般卡牌对战相同的是，游玩中盟友和英雄有生命/攻击/意志力三种属性，三种属性分别解决各自对应的属性；同样的，类似庇护、格挡、潜伏等盟军、英雄特性也是应有尽有，从游戏性来说，这款游戏算是卡牌游戏中的翘楚了。
·最符合指环王这一IP的一点来了，游戏有威胁度和命运事迹俩大系统；威胁度对应索伦对你的关注度，一旦到达50，即代表对局失败，而在威胁度到达50之前，也会根据威胁值触发各种DEbuff；威胁会根据英雄的强度以及游戏轮次的增加而逐步上升，基本上三位英雄，开局就有30左右的威胁度了，加之游戏少量的清场卡牌和你打一张我打一张的对战轮，威胁度的出现大大加大了游戏的难度。很好的还原了原著中主角步步惊魂的刺激氛围以及索伦之眼的注视......
而命运事迹则类似于威胁值，不过对应我方的buff，可以通过卡牌效果或者解放卡牌来增加命运值。不过命运值给予的buff明显不如威胁值，且每应用一次命运事件相当于你出了一次牌，不过在危急关头还是能雪中送炭的。
[h1] 沉浸式角色语音、史诗乐曲、魔戒粉熟知并有一定扩展改变的剧情以及较精美的卡牌立绘[/h1]
唯美的画面，细腻的特效，恢弘壮阔的场面，悠扬悦耳的音乐，低魔幻以及史诗感十足的风格，张弛有度的快慢节奏，这次自定义自己的魔戒主角，各种冲击感、代入感、震撼感、动人感这些才是最大的亮点。
[h1] 游戏缺憾[/h1]
1.游戏采取全程联网的方式，但是服务器对于中国玩家并不算友好。虽然可以裸连进去，但是不保证你不会掉线。而且本作虽然有着联机模式，但是因为鬼服等问题，大体上都是以单人为主的剧情探索副本为主，全程联网会大大降低中国玩家的游戏体验。
2.以本人的眼光来看，游戏英雄的立绘着实普通了一点，而解锁的立绘还不如初始立绘好看些，总体上来说反而是卡牌立绘比较精美。
[h1] 结束语 [/h1]

If they were to make it playable offline, I'd say definitely go ahead and get it still; otherwise probably proceed with caution.

Figuring out how to navigate all the things the quests throw at you is lots of fun and there's good replayability value because there's so many different ways you can build your deck that will completely change your tactics.  The achievements are good, too, and there's lots.  Plus, as a huge LotR fan, you can absolutely never have enough LotR games.  It's challenging, but in a good way, so that you feel like you've gotten somewhere with each win.  There's a mini-quest mode (Mirror of Galadriel) which is really helpful for getting the hang of the mechanics and figuring out which cards work well together.  I just played that until I knew what I was doing.

魔戒作为奇幻文学界扛把子一般的存在，本身的人气和ip价值自然是不需要质疑的。但魔戒毕竟并非战锤40k那种只设置了一个极其庞大的背景，随着版本不断扩充世界观设定，加入角色和种族的“规则”。托尔金老爷子本身的故事已经足够完整和出色，想要依托魔戒的世界观创作游戏很难像战锤40k那般自由自在的发挥。所以魔戒的游戏虽然严格来说数量不算少，但真正得到市场和粉丝都认可的作品数量却不多，特别是近几年更是只有两部“兽人宝可梦”勉强算是卖座游戏。而本作无疑是在魔戒背景下对于游戏创作的一次大胆尝试，有别于一般魔戒游戏的动作类型，本作选择了更加小众的卡牌类型。但也许是制作组的谨慎，本作又没有大张旗鼓的去做传统的tcg。而是选择了更加突出故事背景，并大量结合rpg要素的模式。虽然这在某种程度上进一步压缩了游戏的体量和受众，使得本作从ui上就透露出一股资金不是特别充足的气息，游戏本身的知名度和销量也比较一般，但好处是本作对于魔戒的粉丝来说依旧具备极高的可玩性。无论是针对原著本身情节的合理改变和扩展，还是对于原著内各色角色在艺术表现上的还原，都能带给粉丝足够的满足感。可能作为卡牌游戏作品算不上特别让人惊喜的创新大作，但对于魔戒的粉丝来说依然是一部非常值得尝试的佳作。

[h1] 游玩中一些主要的问题 [/h1]
-让人厌恶的全程联网模式
考虑到游戏本身的玩家不多，多人合作模式基本搜不到人的现状。游戏本身需要全程联网就显得格外让人烦躁。游戏本身并不是炉石那种对战式的卡牌游戏，而是昆特牌王权陨落那种以剧情为主的rpg式卡牌，明明是单机的内容却必须要网络才能进行，对于临时不方便的玩家来说额外增加了一层毫无必要的阻碍。

-效果不佳的卡片交互
本作最蛋疼的问题在于，并没有实装目前几乎所有主流卡牌都会有的基础功能——鼠标放到卡片之上会自动浮动显示卡片详情。这功能对一款卡牌游戏来说几乎是不可或缺的，玩家就算对自己的卡片再了解，面对敌人的时候也难免需要查看地方陌生卡片的效果信息。而本作则没有这个方便的功能，想要查看看片信息，必须要用鼠标点击卡片才能显示。虽然只是多了一步操作，但整局游戏却要进行无数次这种操作，特别是在出牌阶段点击手牌还很容易让大脑卡顿一下区分看牌还是放牌，玩起来对游戏的流畅性打击非常巨大。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1959861246
（本作的ui绘制相比较于卡面也不够精细，关卡选择下左侧的大地图效果很好，但右侧的具体展示就显得有些粗糙）

-战斗中的“危机值”过于影响节奏
虽然现在卡牌游戏似乎都在以“快”作为改良的方向来吸引如今越发缺乏耐心的玩家。但个人最喜欢的依然在于一张卡片一张卡片，一个回合一个回合的布局，最终达成让人眼花缭乱的华丽combo。我不反感快攻牌组亦或是快速的游戏节奏，但很厌恶强制性打断玩家节奏的做法，而本作因为设定上“索伦阻拦”的原因，每一张战斗的每一回合都会积攒一个危机值代表索伦逐渐发现你。当危急值达到阶段上线的时候战场内会强制性刷出强大的怪物代表“索伦发现你了！”这样的做法如果放到正儿八经的rpg上没啥问题，放到卡牌上偶尔一个关卡使用也问题不大，确实很好的突出了紧张感和恐惧感。但每一场战斗都是如此基本就让玩家很难慢条斯理的布局，基本上注意计量值的情况下，玩家只能依靠不断地攻击尽可能的杀死场上的魔物才能低损耗的通关，这种设置让本来难度就不算低的关卡体验更加极端，一方面是通过条件，一方面又要注意不浪费太多回合，这种设置很容易让玩家短时间内连续产生较强的挫败感。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960371829
（游戏中会出现的事件是固定的，第一次体验效果很好，但后续游玩不会有什么变化）

总的来说，入手这部游戏不要带着一部魔戒tcg的期待，这只是一部采用卡片模式展示的剧情为主，去掉了培养升级要素的rpg游戏。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960371809
（每一关的过场写的都很细致生动，而且都是全程优质配音）
游戏本身并不是与其他玩家的牌组对局而是与关卡内固定的怪物对战，通关也是满足通关条件而不是消耗双方的血条。对于粉丝玩家来说，能看到原汁原味的魔戒设定下的有趣故事和熟悉的角色肯定会有很强的吸引力，但对于非粉丝玩家来说，强制联网，差劲的交互，不流畅的关卡体验和几乎找不到人的联网要素都让作品体验存在巨大的瑕疵，个人还是建议折扣期间入手。


[h1] 总结 [/h1]
本作作为一款卡牌游戏来说质量尚可。但游戏本身几乎找不到玩家联机游玩，而单人剧情内容虽然丰富，但必须通过网络才能进入游戏天然就带来了一定的阻碍。离线无法进入也意味着之后游戏一旦关闭服务器玩家将无法通过任何方式运行难免让人不爽。且游戏本身粗糙的ui，难受的交互以及“危机值”的设定都让游玩过程十分的不流畅。虽然每个关卡的故事都紧扣魔戒主题，过场语音和卡牌配音都十分优秀。但对于没有情怀的非魔戒爱好者来说并不具备长期的吸引力。总的来说魔戒粉丝可以直接入手，但对魔戒太多感觉的普通卡牌玩家十分不建议原价下入手。

Pros:
The game after the third campaign starts to be various in deck making and generous in possible permutations against different quests or encounters. The graphic, music and mechanics are polished and well done. No bugs so far I have encountered and all the mechanic permutations works properly. The challenging difficulties offers a real challenge in deckmaking. The good part of that is you have (so far) unlimited deck saves.

Cons:
The multiplayer lacks of a lobby. Is quite impossible to find someone to play co-op (that is the most entertaining part of the game) since the community is not so big and you cannot see who is eventually playing in single player

4/5 to me. Once devs will create a lobby where to interact with other players (not essentially friends who got the game) the game will be 5/5.

To provide some context I'll say I have no experience with the physical card game.

A general overview:
+ a pretty deep card game with varied keywords
+ all the content is free - you get it with currency earned in game and grinding is not necessary
+ cosmetic options for your cards, although limited

- I really dislike the threat meter. It seems like there's very limited ways to manage it, and it adds a lot of challenge to already difficult encounters, culminating in a ""lol you lose"" situation if it reaches its max.
- the game is very challenging. this isn't inherently a negative, but it really feels like it's only challenging to pad out gametime, because the campaigns themselves are very short (and there's only 3 as of time of writing this review)
- the UI is clunky when compared to other offerings. Hovering over cards in your hand doesn't zoom them, you have to manually click on each one to see details. Keywords on cards bring up tooltips explaining them, except they randomly don't work and you have to go to the glossary in the menu and scroll down a huge list to remember them. Tiny things like that are all over the place.

And here's the two main reasons that led me to the refund, and the real reason I decided to write this:
- The game is online only.
- It has all the UI infrastructure needed for the developer to change currency gain/costs and flood the game with microtransactions.

The first one is a negative despite me being lucky enough to pretty much always have internet access. The reason being, if the developer decides to take the servers down, you lose access to the game. This decision is doubly confusing when you consider that it's mainly a single player card game.

The online-only requirement coupled with the size of the unexplored campaign map and potential for so many microtransactions and scummy behavior in the future raised a lot of alarms in my head. Ultimately I decided to refund it despite also wanting to keep playing it and conquer the difficulty of the game.

I'll keep following the game. If it gets an offline mode, I'll for sure buy it again. Otherwise, everytime I'm playing it I feel like I'm up against a double time limit - the in-game threat meter, and the out of game server shutdown meter.",1577464580,1577469498,False,33,3,0.641120731830596924,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Both end up playing quite differently as combat is much different as is the way enemies are played but both versions are two of the better card games I've played. This one also borrows a lot of the excellent art from the physical game. Some very good synergy between many of the cards. Certain abilities or cards can have uses you might not originally expect from their normal assumed use, which can lead to effective strategies in dealing with certain situations or locations. Digital version allows more varied card types and random effects as well as more unique scenario situations. Well voice acted. For now has 18 different scenarios to play through as well as a tutorial and a newly added game type that randomizes things.

Hoping to see content added at a faster pace than the wait between the second and third campaign now that the improved tutorial is done and the console versions have launched.

It is not. While it borrows certain ideas here and there, not to mention artwork, it really is its own game. Which is nice if you have already ventured into the LCG, as this gives you a different experience. 

I have played a number of digital card games and I have to say this is the most unique I've come across. It is a narrative-based questing card game rather than your typical dueling card game. You never battle other players, only Sauron (AI controlled), though you can team up with others to do the quests (which is another unique feature). 

It also has high production values for a card game. Naturally the art which is borrowed from the LCG is great, but so is the music, the voice acting, the story, even the effects are nice! All of these testify to the love and care its creators put into it.

Would I recommend it? Yes I would!
To whom? To Card game players (because of its uniqueness), to fans of the LCG (for a different take on the game they already love), and to Middle-earth fans in general (for obvious reasons).

As an unrelated game, it's okay but not nearly worth the price tag. 

The physical game is ""You Vs. The World"". You aren't the singular threat to Sauron and if you control the threat tracker you can hide from that poorly timed cave troll for a while until you can find some better gear. The physical game is the story of Frodo, hiding in the bushes and trying to avoid Sauron's attention for as long as possible.

This game is a traditional 1 vs. 1 card duel. Sauron draws a hand of cards and plays monsters and trap cards. You fight those monsters and play trap cards of your own. Instead of damaging health pools ala M:TG, you simply each have set ""Target"" cards on the cable that need to be destroyed either my combat or adventure. You're Aragorn at the Black Gate fighting an enemy army. No subtlety or long term plans just trading blows.

As such, the mechanics of the card game are comparatively shallow. The new threat mechanics throw off any real benefits to using weaker heroes, and the active Sauron opponent vastly increases the randomness. While my play is limited so far, the new scene format has made me frustrated more often than entertained. The balance is tight enough that the player needs to know what to expect in future scenes or they will be stream-rolled by a surprise effect. This leads to a requiring you to play ""Scouting games"" where you fully expect to lose, just to learn how the scenario will work.   

But complaints aside, it's fairly well-made. There is alot of polish on everything and the simplified mechanics work pretty well with the UI.  The sheer number of cards is small and made smaller by new deck restrictions, but DLC will likely solve that. The voice acting, the narrative. the balance and even the feel of individual scenarios (Despite frustrations) are all solid.  I have my issues with the game design, but it's on subjective points. 

There are definite issues with turn transitions and I've found myself in game-breaking locked states twice in two hours of play. But, in truth, it feels solid and I just hope future patches will find the edge cases that cause this.

When it comes to recommending the game, I'd sum it up as ""If you aren't looking for the tabletop game, wait for a big sale. (70% or better)"" I'd hesitate to say I ""regret"" my purchase, but it's the only word that keeps popping into my mind.

I reluctantly bought this to see what the fuss was all about. I thoroughly enjoyed the tabletop game and was disappointed when they took the ""dumbed down"" road for the digital version. I thought that this would be ideal if I could have the tabletop simulator experience, or the octgn experience (yes I have played the card game extensively in digital form) with rules enforcement.

I was wrong. 

It is odd, but strangely enough, this game...works. And it captures rather well the spirit of the card game. Don't get me wrong, its rule-set and gameplay loop is more Elder Scrolls: Legends than anything that resembles the paper LCGs of FFG. However it captures very well the dynamic of these paper games in the sense that the core considerations are there.
You don't have engagement per se but you have guard which is kind of engaging an enemy in the card game. 
You don't have exploration of locations through travel but you have hazards that obstruct your progress like locations do in the card game. 
You have ""travelling""  as a subscenario mechanic instead of a phase in the game, but still you have the strategic consideration of trying to defeat or neutralize the enemies that will attack you when you leave, like the tabletop game of threat management for engagement of enemies. 

In short, the gameplay is not the same but the spirit of the LOTR LCG is here. There are some unsafe design decisions from a board gamer's point of view but they must have been made in order to create more mass appeal. However this is not the point of the game. I'm gonna tell you what the point (in my opinion) is.

This game, this format, is the best solo card game that we have so far. Like it's tabletop counterpart, it doesn't just provide stupid bots as punching bags because the mechanics of the game are rather well defined. I do miss a mechanic of engagement based on arithmetics instead of a (again incompetent but irrelevant in the long run) AI, but I guess this is not going to happen. The creatures and their statistics are well balanced and the sheer volume of enemies in higher difficulties is a kind of numerical regulation of the subpar AI. 

Concluding, if you want a very good solo card game experience you can't go wrong with this one. I know that monetization is through microtransactions and I hate it, but that is also the model of the whole LCG. At least I got the option to buy all the content instead of rolling for it through endless purchases. I think that this is the least invasive business model for this kind of game.

On the one hand, we have a digital version of a game whose theme and mechanics I love, without any of the arduous and time consuming setup and tear down of the physical version. What's more, the UI has all the love and polish of Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering Arena and some much needed improvements have been made to the deck building component of the game without fundamentally changing the underlying mechanics. Brilliant and clever.

Unfortunately, some entirely unnecessary changes have been made to the game, presumably for the sake of simplicity, that do it a disservice. Threat is now just a counter until the next bad thing that happens to you, culminating in your loss. Gone is any concept of optional engagement or avoiding certain enemies by keeping your threat low. Questing, a rich and thematic mechanic by which you placed progress tokens (with little footsteps on them) onto location cards has been abstracted behind a meaningless ""fate"" value that robs the game of much of its flavor.

All of this could be forgiven, I think, if the attempt to create a more accessible, streamlined experience came with friendlier encounter design but, alas, it is not so. In my opinion, the designers of the Lord of the Rings Adventure Card Game have become so desensitized to their most hardcore fan base constantly complaining about the game being too easy, that they simply lack any perspective about what the experience is like for a new or casual player. As someone who engaged casually both with the physical game and the digital, I can tell you that every brief moment of triumphant success is almost always immediately crushed by a new stage or phase or enemy, often appearing without warning. It's soul crushing, it's not fun, and to add insult to injury, the ""narrative"" setting does little to alleviate the difficulty, leaving you feeling bad about being unable to play the game on a mode that is a thinly veiled euphemism for ""easy"".

And so we are left with a game that has the polish and accessibility of a Blizzard offering but the unforgiving depth and complexity of whatever fun-adjacent game Valve has most recently published. Its unnecessary simplifications to the game mechanics will drive away the hardcore players and the encounter design will have casual players putting the game down forever after their third or fourth consecutive loss.

Well, besides a couple of educated guesses: perhaps the game is harder than some people expected, and perhaps it is less adherent to the physical version than some other people expected.

As far as actual flaws go, I'd be hard pressed to name one.
The art is GREAT, the music is fitting, the voice actors mostly perfect for the roles; overall the LotR theme is genuinely evoked, and the game - which IS somewhat hard but can be mastered (of course that may require some patience) - is FUN.

First off, is this a good game? Yes, it has the potential to be much better though. There's a requirement to be 100% online at all times, for no reason whatsoever. Even solo. 

A lot of the ""good"" reviews here come from people who have played the physical version, myself included. Boy did FFI rinse us physical users good. We've now paid the same company twice, for the same game. The artwork is the same, look it up. With the recent announcement of discontinuation of the physical version, this is the only option going forward to play LOTR LCG. 

The reason I'm giving this a bad review is that the developers do not listen to the community, at all. As of this point, we've only had two releases of new content this year. They have missed time frames to release new content, with no communication to us as consumers what so ever.

If you're new to the game or thinking about buying this, avoid it. Honestly, you'd think you'd at least be able to play the heroes from the fellowship right? It's LOTR.
No you can't do that. As of now, there is only Aragon, Gimli and Legolas as playable heroes from the fellowship.

There are plenty of random creation heroes though, the new pack that we were getting at the start of September, (which still isn't released) adds more random creation heroes.

Maybe it's just a small team. You're right it is, but they spend more time releasing vague news articles, that tell us nothing, or when we can expect the September pack. Do yourself a favour, read the books again or watch the films for the kick you need. Avoid this like the plague.

I hope they prove me wrong.

Edit: 24/02/2020.

This game sadly didn't even outlive the game it was supposed to be replacing, lasting only a mere 3 campaigns, this is now the only content there will be and FFI as a studio has shut down.

It's not a bad game, it is very thematic, and I appreciate the great voice over during each intro scene.

Sadly it lacks a bit content (new camaigns) and it is unclear if more is to come.

This game is great for 5 reasons:
[b]First[/b], it is inspired by a board/card game, which means that it focus on your entertaiment. It is not a game as a service, and it feels really rewarding when you persevere (sometimes alone, agains an AI) for the sake of it, and actually make it.
[b]Second[/b], it is simple, yet difficult. The base of the game is really straight foward, which can seem monotonous at first, but the AI and the difficulty and situations that you face are made in such a way that you suddenly are facing a new puzzle every round.
[b]Third[/b], because of the previous, and because it is a PVE game, deckbuilding is actually FUN. It has different difficulty settings and you are facing an AI that doesn't netdeck, so you can go wild, try weird things, try different heroes. Everything can end up working (or not), and it is now one of the very few digital card games that makes the deckbuilding experience actually interesting instead of futile.
[b]Fourth[/b], it IS a cooperative game. Again, this is PVE, there is no netdecking, so playing with friends make sense, and it's fun, and even more fun with weird decks. The multiplayer doesn't feel a subpar experience, something pointless that you do on the side, but actually one of the most fun experiences of the game, and something that you can look foward to.
[b]And fifth[/b], it has plot, and voice acting, and it is actually cool. Maybe the plot is not that awesome, but it adds to the atmosphere, and every new quest is a chill experience, with both a cool introduction to every step of the quest, and then the process of discovering the encounter and how to solve it. Sometimes you will even encounter hidden paths that take you to different situations.

I am really glad that I bought this game. It is very replayable, not in the sense of the other digital cardgames in which you will sink hours, but in the sense that you will play every quest multiple times, with different decks and different expectations, and feel that your time and money were properly expended.

Btw, there aren't any micro transactions any more. The reviews talking about it are talking about the early release.

PROS
• It's not a CCG. Cards are locked but you spend in-game currency to unlock just the cards you want.
• You're encouraged to try out different heroes in each part of the campaign.
• Different ways to win.

MISC
• I found patterns in the AI after a while, in how the cards are activated. However,I don't think this is bad but adds to the strategy of the game. The AI has more powerful cards than you, which makes up for not making humanly clever moves.
• The progress in achieve cards seems alright. I can buy the cards I want after I finished a stage (containing 4-6 battles), when I want to change my deck.

CONS
• In game purchases to get new campaigns. Yeah, OK. This is a micro transaction but I also think this is a winning business model (DLC).
• Possibly too few combinations of heroes to start with.
• The hero animations of the start of each stage is annoyingly long.
• Can't hover with mouse over power names to see what they do during the game, but instead have to go to a submenu outside the game  to search for the power.",1570027054,1603389933,True,0,0,0.482758641242980957,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That is NOT a bad thing either . Like many of you ,I would have accepted a TT port without question and enjoyed it. This version does share artwork from cards with the TT but for the most part, Lore aside , thats where it stops

         Yet this game stands on its own nicely and I find it very fun to play. It can also be very frustrating and is  always a challenge no matter which of the 3 tiers of difficulty you play. The highest tier is simply a lesson in humility if you do not have the mechanics and oh so subtle nuances of the game down pat. Those that can not handle defeat , or become quickly agitated if they are not dominating a digital game should know right from the start they simply are not going to win every game , and for sure will dominate only in the rarest of instances.

  The first mechanic you should concentrate on learning  is GUARDING , you will get no where in this game till you understand the ins and outs of who , when, and why to use this game mechanic. Deck building skills are another critical thing you should concentrate early on. There is NO certain cards that simply dominate and hand you a win, though many very strong cards can be added to your build , just no single one will assure victory like it can in many other games of similar nature.

  The games pricing  structure is very similar to that of the TT version and expect add on purchased Adventures and such to be the near equal of it. There is a good amount of value to be had in the initial bundle offering so I would suggest you do so if possible. Many of the other cards not in the base set or adventure pack are simply earned in game through play ,  There is no WHALE type situation either, if you no longer can gain from a given HERO pack or Adventure set , you are unable to purchase it in any way. This greatly levels the field in the co-op mode and allows for all players to have equal success against the AI. 

Lastly be aware that this is a CO-OP or Solo PVE based game, NO PVP . Honestly though, the AI is so good at just beating you like a baby kitten that it does not matter. You will simply hate this AI at times more than you ever could a player thats doing the same to you.

If, like many others, you're a huge fan of the physical card game you might walk away disappointed, as it changes quite a few mechanics.  

That being said, looking at the product objectively as a whole, it's pretty solid.  Personally, I think they improved on the game quite a bit.  Granted, I find the physical card game it's based on to be pretty mediocre.  It's probably one of my least favorite card games from fantasy flight.  Whereas the physical version felt a little stale and slow, the digital version feels a lot snappier, interactive, and overall more intriguing than the physical version.  

[u][b]For those who are familiar with the physical card game:[/b][/u]

So the main changes to the game are how threat level is handled, and how the general flow of the game is played.  

In the physical game, cards have their own threat value that determines whether or not they interact with players.  This mechanic is non-existant in the digital version.  In this version, every card engages the player.  Instead, threat has certain thresholds where, if met, bad things happen.  Both share the similarity of causing you to lose the game should you go over a certain amount.  

As for the flow of the game, in the digital version the players alternate with plays with sauron.  So for example, if you play a card, sauron then gets to act (such as by having an enemy attack one of your characters, or playing his own card), then the play goes back to you, and so on.  This continues until both the players and sauron pass, in which case a new turn begins.  This is wildly different from how the physical card game plays.  There are no combat commitments and checks (with hidden card boosts), and players don't have their own threat areas (sauron's minions will attack whoever, unless you have a character guard).     

This game also adds some other new mechanics not found in the physical version (characters can commit willpower to fill a meter and get special bonuses, for example).  It can't be stated enough, while there are some similarities this game is ultimately a different game altogether.  

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now on to the pros and cons.

Pros:

[list]
[*]The game is quite a lot of fun to play
[*]The game does a good job of making you feel like you're playing a party of adventurers on an adventure.  Granted, when it comes to this it's no Arkham Horror but it does this better than the physical lord of the rings lcg.  
[*]Each scenario is very different in their mechanics and how they play out. 
[*]It offers a unique experience compared to any card game out there right now.  Mechanically, I don't think there's another card game out there like it.  
[*]Scenarios can range from half an hour to an hour to complete, but there's a save function in the game to pick up where you left off.  
[*]Different difficulty options.  If you're a hardcore gamer of the genre the hardest difficulty probably wont stump you, but you'll still find it at a level that's entertaining.  Likewise, if you're new to the genre or casual, the easiest difficulty is pretty forgiving.  
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
[*]This game only supports up to two players (a con for those expecting up to a 4 player game like the physical version)
[*]It's really rare to match up with someone for multiplayer.  You have to go to the discord chat for that.  
[*]Currently there aren't that many scenarios.  With the base game you can play 9, with 4 more if you get the expansion.
[*]There are many cards that aren't useful.  For example, most events (1 out of the 3 card types) aren't good.  This really limits deck construction, even more so if you only have the base game.  
[/list]

Overall I'd give it a solid 7/10.  I think it could use more options in deck construction and more scenarios.  Furthermore, it would have been great to be able to play this game with up to 4 people.  At the moment, this is more of a single-player game than a co-op game.  For the amount of content it currently has, I'd probably wait to pick this up while it's on sale (I picked it up back when it was only 8 bucks, and I feel that for that price it was a pretty good bargain).",1568779190,1568779215,True,12,0,0.634726464748382568,0,True,False,False,False,,,

С другой наблюдается явная нехватка индивидуальности, и часть того же духа растворяется во вторичности. Этой игре (а точнее - ее настольному первоисточнику) удалось воссоздать атмосферу Средиземья совершенно новыми красками, не уступающими в яркости произведению команды Джексона.

Но сначала коротко об ее игромеханических возможностях. В распоряжение игрока поступают 3 знаковых в повествовании героя, каждый из которых обладает четырьмя характеристиками: атакой (служит для приведения монстров в стабильное состояние), умением (отражает способность персонажа обходить препятствия, превозмогать проклятия, получать расположение сил света), здоровьем (критерий существования персонажа на поле) и еще одним параметром, который со стороны сюжета выражается в заинтересованности нашим персонажем темными силами, а со стороны игрового процесса - продолжительностью партии: более сильные персонажи, увы. имеют меньше ходов для разделывания сил противника. Под началом наших героев колода из 30 карт, уже знакомым способом перемещающихся по траектории ""колода -> рука -> поле боя/мгновенный эффект -> сброс"". В этой тридцатке умещаются снаряжения (оружие, броня, щиты и ауры, которыми могут быть снабжены любые персонажи на поле боя, включая супостатов), события (дающие положительный эффект здесь и сейчас), ловушки (срабатывающие при определенных условиях) и союзники (те же герои, но со второстепенными характеристиками и ролью в сюжете).

Вся эта рать, которая может быть собрана вручную или выбрана из уже существующих, противостоит аналогичной колоде противника, которая намерено сильнее и работает по определенным правилам.

Структура хода проста, но именно в ней кроется изюминка игры: в его границах можно совершить одно (если нет дополнительных эффектов) действие: разыграть карту, атаковать, защититься, открыть дверь, разгрести завал, взять в руки секиру, обратиться к Свету за помощью, применить способность и т. д. Аналогичный инструментарий и противника, предпочитающего сначала атаковать, а уже потом использовать нетривиальные приемы. Приходится мудро распределять ресурсы. Если, допустим, первыми ходами пытаться разыгрывать карты, можно можно существенно расширить количество тактических маневров, однако подставить под удар слабых персонажей. Или наоборот, если отложить подмогу картами на последние ходы, уставшие (совершившие действие) персонажи смогут воспользоваться преимуществами только в следующей фазе.

Всевидящее око не дремлет, изливая на наше братство целые легионы пауков, варгов, орков, намереваясь не только устроить геноцид. но и сокращая время партии, изымая карты из руки, проклиная наиболее ценных союзников. Но и у сил Света есть запасной прием: можно обратиться за помощью к Валар, которые по достижению определенного числа на школе ""добра"" сподобятся прислать нам бонус разнящийся от миссии к миссии.

В итоге получаем весьма ""вкусную"" формулу, обсчитывать которую раз за разом все интереснее: ""колодостроение"" + ""распределение ресурсов"" + ""тактика"". Первая переменная особенно интересна, поскольку часть карт изначально недоступна: их приходится открывать по мере прохождения квестов, выполнения специальных заданий, часть из которых привязана к героям. За эти же очки доступен пока незначительный набор для оформления: аватары, рубашки карт, несколько рамок.

В игре присутствует кооператив - совершенно отдельный фонтан веселья и тактических изысканий.

Великолепное визуальное оформление, многочисленные цитаты из книг, часть из которых хорошо озвучены (""Возвращайся во тьму!"" от Гендальфа особенно вдохновляет) позволяет составить совершенно новый образ знакомого мира, сохраняя изюминку его автора.

Из горького на сем пиршественном столе - многочисленные огрехи в интерфейсе. Но регулярные обновления, думаю, не оставят их залеживаться. Также где-то потерялась локализация на русский (совершенно не помеха в игре, поскольку ничего сложного в ней нет).

Однозначно рекомендую и как поклонник творчества о Средиземье, и как любитель цифровых воплощений настольных игр.

Things I Liked: The mechanics and systems this game has put in place make an excellent platform for future development. The underlying idea is sound. The game is also well polished, complete with fully voiced narration, good artwork, and few bugs.

Things I Disliked: The amount of content. I hit the ""DLC-wall"" with a resounding thud about 7 hours-in. The base game comes with 1 campaign, which has 5 missions. You also get to ""start"" the 2nd campaign, but can't really play it until you buy the DLC. The base experience doesn't feel like a complete game, more like a demo.

[h1] The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game 指环王：卡牌冒险[/h1]
本作是一款以指环王为题材的策略卡牌游戏，游戏基于原著所建立的魔幻世界，在游戏中，玩家将响应未知冒险的召唤，直面索伦的黑暗势力，为了保护中土世界的和平，开启属于自己的冒险之旅。游戏元素丰富，游戏性较强，并且画风极大程度还原了人物在玩家心中的印象，魔戒老粉快来入手。

[h1]👉前言👈[/h1]
第二纪元1200年，黑暗魔君索伦以“天赋宗师”安纳塔的身份出现在伊瑞詹。伊瑞詹领主凯勒布理鹏受索伦的欺骗，铸造了十九枚统御魔戒——精灵三戒、矮人七戒和人类九戒。
1600年，索伦暗中铸造了至尊魔戒，以控制其他的统御魔戒。
1693年，索伦率军入侵伊利雅德，精灵与索伦之战爆发，人类九戒落入索伦之手。
巴拉巴拉巴拉巴拉 索伦太牛批啦 巴拉巴拉巴拉巴拉~~~
3441年，索伦在巴拉多之围中先后杀害了伊兰迪尔和吉尔加拉德。埃西铎捡起纳西尔圣剑的碎片，斩下了索伦戴有魔戒的手指，索伦的肉体因此消亡。埃西铎夺取了魔戒，但他拒绝销毁它，并将它作为自己的传家之宝。
第三纪元2年，埃西铎在格拉顿平原被半兽人杀害，魔戒掉入安都因河，从此被人们遗忘。
第三纪元1000年前后，索伦以死灵法师的身份重新出现在中土大陆，建立了多尔哥多。
第三纪元2463年，魔戒被霍比特人德戈发现，他的好友史麦戈被魔戒诱惑，将他杀害并夺取了魔戒。史麦戈后来被族人逐出家乡，他藏身于迷雾山脉的洞穴中，并被魔戒转变为一个名为“咕噜”的扭曲而堕落的生物。
2941年，霍比特人比尔博·巴金斯应灰袍巫师甘道夫的邀请参与了孤山任务，他在途中偶然发现了魔戒。
-------------------------------------------------------------------------[i]故事背景时间摘自百度百科[/i]

说到世界上最顶尖的奇幻文学，不用思考，必须是魔戒。魔戒一书的名声响彻全球，魔戒三部曲也是很多少年奇幻文学的启蒙书籍。魔戒这一系列的成功不只是体现在书籍之上，根据这一题材，“彼得大帝”导演的系列电影更是在二十一世纪掀起了一股“魔戒风”。从古到今，文学界没有人不赞叹托尔金的伟大，也没有任何一部作品能够超越魔戒，魔戒这两个字在人们心里早已根深蒂固。到如今，游戏届也有不少以指环王或是霍比特人作为题材的游戏，有些只是将着重点放于中土世界，并且收获了极高的评价，有些只是以寓教于乐的方式推广魔戒的主线剧情（乐高真好van）。当然，本作作为一款卡牌游戏，以魔戒为题材，用魔戒背景故事加以润色，将原著上的一些人物代以卡牌的形式加以表现，玩家可以定义自己的初始牌组，改变出场的英雄，利用一些小技巧达成当前的目标，并同时保护自己的主将，降低索伦的警惕。但就目前来说，游戏的服务器一般，卡牌的数量相对较少，剧情内容也并不是很多，并且游戏的内购真的不少，好在游戏剧情以及人物都有配音，给游戏的整体体验提升了一个档次。

[h1]👉游戏体验👈[/h1]
玩家如果想要更多了解一下剧情，可以在游戏中选择进行剧情模式，可以更好了解游戏所采用的剧情设计，游戏中的配音十分地道，让玩家可以更好的融入剧情。游戏采用回合制的玩法，卡牌战斗的方面制作的比较偏向炉石，使用卡牌放技能或是召唤随从都要看指定卡牌是几费的，能量可以累计，以便在下一轮打出高费的牌，主将之外还有仆从，有一定的攻击、技能或是特殊的保护主将机制。玩家还可以利用特定技能的卡牌回复将领血量，增加护盾等等等等。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1851134188
游戏中的仆从或是英雄都有相应的攻击值、法力值以及血量，攻击值以蓝色斧头标志展现，法力值以黄色方块标志展现，我方人员血量均为红。对于敌人方面，因为在游戏一开始，我方三位主将会直接上场，但敌人可能会有多位怪物或是加上几张效果牌，对于效果牌，下方通常会有写有数字的黄色方格表示其血量，拥有法术攻击的角色才能给效果牌造成伤害（一开始没看明白，傻傻的拿着自己攻击3法术1的英雄哐哐冲，一点一点磨法术牌，刚刚磨完对面直接再放一张瞬间崩溃）因为每一轮，每位英雄只能进行一次攻击，所以玩家需要合理计算我方英雄所能造成的最大伤害。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1851134271
在游戏中，每个任务都有多个关卡，只有通过“最后遭遇”，任务才会胜利，在游戏过程中敌人的一些诡术牌或是一些事件会增加索伦的警觉值，警觉值达到五十，如果自己没有能够降低警觉值的卡牌，则直接gg。有些关卡是有相应的任务，比如击败一定数量的特定敌人或是击破幻像，没有必要在一轮里清空敌方的所有随从，达到目标即可直接点击旅行进入下一场景，没有必要浪费太多时间。有些关卡还需要注意其特殊规定，比如游戏中有一关是敌方出现三张“冰裂缝”则游戏直接失败，玩家在完成任务的同时需时刻注意这些特殊限定。
任务胜利之后，玩家可以通过使用获得的金钱购买卡牌背景之类的装饰等等，自定义人物牌组以及人物语音。

-Jogo bastante semelhante ao de ""tabuleiro"" da Galápagos, que é muito divertido
-Campanhas legais. É possível ver que houve um esforço dos desenvolvedores em fazer mecânicas que deixassem o jogo desafiador .

-Forma de desbloqueio das cartas sem pagar é muito legal (vencer campanhas ou realizar objetivos com os heróis). Recebi as DLCs por ter comprado o jogo base, mas compraria outras sem pensar muito à respeito
-Arte bacana/Música boa
-Filtro de cartas tem uma busca que facilita encontrar palavras específicas nas cartas


Pontos negativos:
-Não disponível no idioma PT-BR 
-Seria legal ter mais opções de arte das cartsa, seja dos personagens ou mesmo do verso.

A barra do olho de Sauron acrescenta um desafio considerável e tira o foco total sobre o que acontece entre as cartas, já que você deve considerar sua estratégia para não perder o jogo ao encher a barra por completo.

I watched gameplay footage and thought it looked quite good and the core concept wasn't as convoluted as heartstone turned out. 
The only thing i didn't notice during the gameplay footage was the voice acting. Needless to say i think it is bad. It was corny, completely over the top oneliners which made no sense coming from a character like aragorn or arwen. 

i think this is why tolkien didn't want adaptations for his works. Any character, anything in his works really is interconnected and has a reason for existing. The movies depicted it perfectly. ANy character carried with himself aa certain level of gravitas, nothing obsolete and convoluted. The characters never ever would have spouted oneliners and rarely if ever did things without purpose. In my opinion there are good if not great or amazing adaptations from his work. I have watched the movies at least 20 times at the very least read the books twice as many times, i have hundreds if not thousands hours in LOTRO and played the shadow of mordor/shadow of war (both of which i loved storywise, which is to say i like non-canon as well.)

If you love card games, but have grown tired of the competitive meta slog that so many TCG's/CCG's fall into, where creative expression and fun are replaced with dull rock-paper-scissors game-play and a constant feeling that validation can only be achieved by winning against another person, then this might be the game for you.
If you just want to relax, create a deck(machine) and use it to solve puzzles (difficult and easy), while also being told a short tale set in the fantastic Middle-earth universe by Tolkien... then this is the game for you.

Are you tired of Card Games that utilise the lootboxy system of card packs, and would prefer getting new cards and quests through regularly released expansions (some of which are free)... then this is the game for you.

Do you hate a challenging or difficult games, and would rather not meet a game on it's own terms, or are you likely to blame your losses on RNG? Then this might not be the game for you.

I'm not that interested in playing the same quests over and over again, but it is fun enough the first couple times with different decks. After playing through each campaign and challenge quest a couple times i am happy to set aside the game until the next dlc drops. Which i will pick up on day one for another few hours of entertainment. 

The interface could use a lot of work as the game feels pretty clunky as a whole. The deck builder is particularly bad. Having keywords explained in hangers when you've right clicked on a card would be a huge quality of life improvement. Having to go into the options menu to look things up in tedious and unnecessary.

   Great gameplay, the core mechanics are really fun, different from the usual TCG's. Every quest is it's own goal and the goals vary a lot. It's not just ""Get your opponent hp to zero"". Each quest feels like a puzzle you need to solve.
   Good monetization.
   Good voice acting.
   Good story, especially if you are a fan of LOTR universe.
   Good soundtrack.

The bad:
  Buggy. Had multiple crashes and UI glitches. Tends to be ok since it saves your progress between rounds. I would say it's fine since it's early access, but they are planning to release the game on consoles this month, so I'm not sure how they can do it at this state.
  Poor UI. Honestly just confusing, hard to see buttons, the keyword effects are not explained on the screen so you need to look at glossary, etc.
  Confusing out of game mechanics in general. Like, for quests you get coins, but then it's not clear what do you do with that. You can buy some visual changes(card backs, frames, icons, alternate art) but I got more than 20k coins from playing for 3 hours, which seems more than enough to get anything you want. 
  Or  you look at the cards you don't have, it says to unlock it I need to purchase Campaign 2: the shadow fall. Ok, that's fair. But then I try to play the Campaign 2 and it let's me. So I can play it, but I need to buy it to unlock the cards? It's hard to understand what exactly are you getting with the core pack, and what the expansions give you. I thought with the core pack I get only core cards, but then there are some cards that you unlock as you play. So who knows.
  Not possible to play with touchscreen. A certain action requires a right click, and hold doesn't register as a right click. Which is a shame since touchscreen tends to be the most comfortable control method for card games.


Overall:
   If you always enjoyed the concept of TCG's and card building, or wanted to get into it, but you don't like the never ending grind and money sink, this is a best thing you can get.

리뷰를 계속해서 업데이트 해보겠습니다.

1. 2019년 8월 6일
- FFG 사의 반지의제왕 LCG 가 원작입니다. 그걸 디지털로 만든게 이겁니다.
- 아직 몇 판 안해봤습니다.
- 한글화가 안되어 있어 언어의 압박이 있지만... 영어 수준은 높지 않습니다.
- 인트로 나레이션 및 캐릭터 음성 더빙이 잘 되어있어 게임에 몰입하는 데에 도움이 됩니다.
- 카드 이미지에 FFG 사의 실물 카드게임인 반지의 제왕 LCG 일러스트를 채용하고 있는데... 일러스트 하나하나가 훌륭합니다. 
- 스팀판은 원작 반지의제왕 LCG 와 룰이 다릅니다. PC 게임에 어울리도록 개편된듯 합니다.

이 게임은 기본적으로...
우리가 잘 아는 영웅들이 책과 영화에서 소개된 시나리오대로 여정을 떠납니다. (반지원정대)
다음 여정으로 가기위해서는 토큰 카운터를 공략해야 합니다. (=일종의 메인 퀘스트)
하지만 사우론의 거미들이 계속 공격해오기 때문에... 얘네들을 좀 잡아줘야 합니다.
고유 능력들이 있는 카드들이 많기 때문에, 이런 카드들을 전략적으로 이용해야 합니다.

돈법사의 매직더게더링 과 FFG 사의 LCG 게임 (반지의제왕)의 가장 큰 차이점은...
LCG 는 카드팩을 사면... 해당 덱을 전부 보유하게 됩니다.
매직더게더링의 경우 카드팩을 사면... 해당 덱중 랜덤하게 5장, 10장 나와서 풀 셋을 맞추려면 여러번 사야합니다.

LCG 역시 이러한 확장 카드팩 자체가 꾸준하게 출시되는 편인데... 
한번만 구매하면 되니 상대적으로 돈 부담이 덜한 편입니다.
아마 스팀판도 마찬가지 아닐까 생각됩니다. (DLC 방식으로 구매...)

이 게임은 스토리 텔링 + 덱빌딩 카드 게임입니다.
반지의제왕 분위기에 맞는 음악, 멋진 일러스트가 게임의 재미를 더해줍니다.
음성 나레이션, 더빙도 나쁘지 않네요.

제가 거의 30년째 반지의제왕 덕후라... (아... 아재입니다) 처음 몇 판 해본 소감은... 재밌다 입니다.

반지의제왕 테마 좋아하면 => 괜찮은 게임입니다.
그렇지 않다면 => 별로 재미없을 겁니다.

반지의제왕을 비롯하여 FFG 사의 LCG 게임들은 테마에 몰입되지 않으면 영 재미없습니다.

아직 얼리 액세스에 몇 판 안해봐서... 추후 업데이트 하겠습니다.

I'd love to see more variety in terms of quests, but these will be added at a later date- so I'm not holding it against the game right now. 

The game is very generous with its rewards, you're able to purchase at least 1 card after completing each quest, meaning you're constantly unlocking new things and possibilities to try.

I'll be updating the review down the line, especially as it comes out of early access or as the issues are addressed. I really do want to love this game, but I can't recommend currently.

The biggest issue currently is major server issues, which the devs are aware of.  This is the primary reason I can't recommend the game in its current state. Several times now I've attempted to play the game but been unable to due to the developer's servers just not functioning. I can understand this for the multiplayer aspect, but the game also has singleplayer that is requiring a constant connection to their server for no reason. The devs need to 1. Fix their servers and 2. Add the ability to play offline for single player content.

Complete waste of time. I wish I had the 2 hours of my life back I spent playing this. Uninstalled it.

Update in response to developer comment. 

Reinstalled the game and played through it some more just to get my notes correct. The issues I have are below. 

Whole game play lasts about 2-3 hours (including expansions) which is pretty short. 
Appears to be focus on repeating playthroughs to get some sort of unlock, but these are needlessly hard to find. The mission ones you need to click on each individual mission in each mission group to see, there is then a flyout tab for the heroes who have been on that mission which is a separate location, then there are apparently unlocks for doing certain things with heroes but I cant see where they are listed at all.
Again, if the focus is to play through multiple times with different decks, that process is made needlessly difficult. As far as I can tell you cant replace a hero in a deck without removing them first and if they are the last hero of that type in the deck then it also removes all cards of that type. 
The card pool is really small. I realize this is early access, but it has been in early access for a year now so clearly the progress is lacking. 
The mission pool is really small. See above.
There is a mechanic in one of the missions that is just reset all progress you have made towards the goal. This is lazy way to add difficulty that serves no purpose but to annoy the player. 
At the beginning of each adventure you have to listen to the voice line for each hero (which you have heard 2 dozen times by the end) and you cant play the game until they all do it. 
The UI is poorly designed. In several places you run into a situation where you click something, nothing happens immediately so you click again only to see it did work and you just screwed something up by clicking the thing that it changed to. An example of this is when you go to edit a deck, if you double click the deck by accident it opens the deck and then starts removing cards from it. 
I cannot find my discard pile. The enemy removed cards from your hand and deck very frequently (another poor design choice, see loss aversion), they flash on the screen for a second and then they are gone. When they remove 6 cards this way there is no time to read them all and I cant find a discard pile to look at what is in there. 
On that same thread there are a lot of mechanics that the enemy can do that you have no response for. There are almost no cards to recover cards from discard even though you almost always loose random cards because of the enemy actions. 
There is no filter to see what cards you only have 1 of (if you are looking for something to spend the in game currency on). 
The news takes up more space than anything else on the main menu and tells you almost nothing.",1560912873,1561118589,False,26,1,0.661086618900299072,0,False,False,True,False,,1561453368.0,"Hi DropDeadCriminal.

I barely scratched the surface of what this deep and challenging card game has to offer and i really want to give all you guys, my honest impression about everything this game has to offer, especially as soon as i'm confident knowing plenty about and having played the game thoroughly enough before doing so.. 

However, i have a couple of card playing friends on Steam here which i bet would really like to get their minds into this one too.
The community for this game is really great, friendly and helpful and tbh they did an amazing job as to explain some key elements to me before i was actually convinced that purchasing the game would be something i wouldn't likely regret..
Thankfully i took a leap of faith (with the help of some newly made friends) and 5 hours in, i can't say i've regretted it one moment since.

The narrative voice acting is really nice (like The Lord Of The Rings basically) and the graphics and overall design quality is pretty pleasing as well (please note: I never played any games like this one, like Heartstone or whatever..) so for me personally speaking, i couldn't be happier about how it all looks, sounds and behaves really.. I'm just a sucker for LOTR, i confess! 
So, my friends who're watching this ""pre-review"" i hope you will put this game on top of your wanted list soon too because you know me, if i like it, you'll likely do too. 

One additional note: The game is no longer free to play (i didn't even know about that it was before anyway) and it's still in Early Access, so there are some bugs and changes bound to happen (although i haven't seen any so far, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed) No Jinxing!!! 
Anyway, i'm very pleased for buying the game and i'm already learning a few things the hard way now, which keeps me pushing myself to try harder.. Even after making many mistakes and believe me, you'll make plenty of those too because as i mentioned above, it's a deep and challenging game, yet the greater rewards are always there for the taking whenever you succeed...

Les tours de jeu ne sont pas découpés comme le jeu original et les mécaniques ne sont pas les même mais ici tout est agencé pour que le résultat soit quasiment le même. 

De plus s'agissant d'un early access il est important de noter que ce jeu va être sujet à de nombreux changements, mécaniques, de contenu et graphiques. 

Je vais lister les mécaniques qui changent par rapport au jeu digital pour que les joueurs sachent à quoi s'attendre : 

- Déjà le système de voyage est différent et simplifié. Vous n'avez pas de cartes ""lieux"" à explorer et ils ne vous retardent pas dans la poursuite de la quête. En fait il n'y a pas de cartes lieux du tout (remettant en cause l'existence des cartes notamment naines du jeu digital qui pouvaient accelerer ce genre d'exploration). A le place vous ""voyagez"" après avoir franchit les 3 (ou plus) étapes de quête qui sont retranscrites dans le jeu. 

- Le système de menace est toujours là et on perd toujours à 50 mais les ennemis dans la ""zone de cheminement"" (qui n'est pas représentée c'est juste le terrain) ne génère plus de menace et n'ont plus de valeur de menace. A la place la menace est augmentée par des sorte de cartes evenements côté sauron. D'ailleurs il y a maintenant des paliers de menace qui génèrent des évenements négatifs si vous la menace les atteint. 

- PAS DE CARTE OMBRE (ce qui je trouve enlève beaucoup de défi pour les combats)

- Certains personnages qui n'étaient pas héros dans le jeu digital le deviennent. 

- Le combat et la mise en jeu des personnage se fait à la même phase, qui est gérée en tour par tour : Jouer une carte vous coûte une action --> c'est au tour de l'adversaire de jouer --> jouez une carte ou attaquez/avancez dans la quête, etc ... 

Il y a pas mal de choses à faire le contenu à l'air conséquent contrairement à ce que beaucoup d'autres disent. IMPORTANT : Le système de multijoueur ne vous permet de jouer qu'avec vos amis, vous ne pouvez pas rejoindre la partie d'un inconnu. 
Conclusion c'est un jeu différent mais avec quelques ressemblances avec le jeu digital, ne vous attendez pas à jouer au même jeu mais ca peut bien vous plaire. (PS : la narration est géniale et les décors sont pas mauvais du tout).",1560172358,1560172635,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Deck-building and tinkering is as engaging as in the physical game, having the option for alternate artwork is a very nice personalisation option (though locked behind in-game currency).

The game is really nice. I was a little bit afraid that my old laptop won't launch it but works like a charm on low graphics and the game still looks good.

I have the physical card game at home. The two games are somewhat similar altough they have real differences. I find the digital version somewhat easier and more balanced. The threat management, the questing, and the fighting is also different but not worse. It also has different quests than the physical LCG. This digital version has three difficulty options, too but with better names (narrative mode instead of easy mode). 

EDIT: There are no ""locations"" in this digital version - at least not like those in the physical one. I hope they will add them later in the game in some form because they can make the LOTR feeling much better. In the digital version there are ""obstacles"" instead of locations.

It's also cheaper and therefore you are able to have more content in my opinion and you can also obtain cards with in-game currency which you get by doing scenarios (playing). You can see what you buy so it's not like Hearthstone and other card games. Also, since it's digital you can buy the game anywhere in the world, unlike the physical version which is really hard to obtain in some places (I mean the expansions).

The tutorial is very friendly and tells you the mechanics quite well. I enjoy replaying missions and getting new cards. The developers make a good job: they are listening to the feedbacks and also making new scenarios.

This game has a great future and I hope it stays this way. I'll edit this review after playing more.

Ein erbärmliches Produkt, welches versucht ein tiefes Kartenspiel mit der Leichtherzigkeit eines Hearthstones zu verbinden, auf voller Linie scheitert und es schafft niemandem zu gefallen.

Und Spielspaß den hätte man vielleicht haben können wenn das Spiel überhaupt funktionieren würde. Regelmäßige Serverabstürze die zum Spielstandverlust bei Quests von manchmal einer Stunde Spielzeit führen und Tage an denen der Server schlicht überhaupt nicht geht machen diesen Müll grenzwertig unspielbar. Eine Beleidigung der Herr der Ringe Lizenz.

Nach einigen Veränderungen und vor allem einem Wechsel des Entwicklers hat sich die Qualität des Spiels deutlich gebessert.
Die DLC sind nun alle im Hauptspiel enthalten, die Serverabstürze und Bugs selterner und durch ein solides Speichersystem weniger frustrierend, der Kartenpool is angemessen groß so das zumindest annährend genügend Abwechslung aufkommt.

However - and I appreciate this is still early access - the game is completely undermined by the client software. Functionally, it runs very poorly, with severe lag and frame drops, with very bad responsiveness - often having to click on cards multiple times to get any response, sometime leading to the wrong actions being taken. Secondly, for reasons unknown in a PvE game, a continuous connection to the game servers is required, and if this is lost your game ends and you are dumped back to the main menu.

For both these reasons, and various unexplained softlocks, I was unable to even complete the tutorial quests.

Of course, much of this may be fixed once it comes out of early access. But fundamentally the client UI design is poorly thought through, with basic functionality like having to right-click to view card details so far behind the kind of experience you expect from modern games. Secondly, the always-online requirement is an incredibly poor design decision.

So, overall, a faithful adaptation of an extremely enjoyable LCG sadly completely undermined by a dated and unresponsive client framework that needs to be sent back to the firey pits from whence it was forged.",1558277328,1558277328,False,14,0,0.666882157325744629,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Best not to think you are buying the same LCG as the physical game. It is not the same. If you accept that and approach the experience without these preconceptions, then you should enjoy it as a Middle Earth fan

It is different in mechanics but very similar in theme and lore
The voice acting is good and the art is great
The turn-taking means a different approach is needed from the other version - there is not a summon - quest - encounter phase process - each turn you can play a card, attack, quest, use powers, etc
The deck building is different as you do not gain different colours of ""mana"" to summon cards; instead the heroes' spheres just determine which colour of cards can be in your deck
I can beat the game at Narrative difficulty fairly easily but it gets much harder after that

Value for money is good: two long campaigns so far plus two encounters. There is more to come as development continues BUT charging for DLC whilst it's still early access is not on
UPDATE - since leaving EA, existing owners got upgraded to the definitive edition, gaining the first 2 DLC - a good move!

In the end, not everyone will feel happy with the game - that's what the reviews indicate - If you're thinking of buying it then know it is a DIFFERENT game to the physical one. Do NOT expect the same product.

2 things that make me give this a thumbs up: First, the developers are very active. They are addressing key issues and are improving the game week after week. They are not afraid to change core gameplay mechanics, or their pricing model. Bugs get squashed, developers interact and the game gets new content. 

It's early access, and that's very visible here. But I've seen this game improve so much over the past half year or so. The following gameplay update will add even more ways to play, distancing away from hoe they handle score is a great thing for deck variety.

My second reason, thr game itself is great. It received a lot of sass for not being 100% digital, while I agree on some points, I think taht giving this system a fair shot was worth it. 


Imho, this game needs 2 things: Content, content, content. In the paper world, a new pack gets released every 3-4 weeks or so, this is an absolute MUST. iI don't feel like 10 bucks / pack is the way to go, but that's not up to me

For newer players this game might be quite challenging to play (paper game IS very challenging too). They have new tutorial campaign in the works which should make acquaintance with game much more enjoyable. So one of possibilities to have positive experience - is to wait till they release it. Another thing: coop is reported as being significantly easy than solo, so campaign can be most probably won even having little to no experience relatively fast

So for those who did enjoy physical one: the game feels enough different to be fresh, while retains quite some similarities to have pull necessary strings. I found it deep enough even in the stage of early access. To name a few similarities and differences:
Some similarities:
1. from the start you have 3 heroes taken out of 4 different spheres
2. your hero spheres define what cards you can take
3. you have indirect form of quest phase
4. both are quite difficult (only playing on Challenging difficulty though)
5. sphere identity is more or less preserved
6. art is reused but that's a good thing. Also familiar pieces of art when in full screen mode (when narration happens there are static screens taken from physical card art) reveal shocking amount of details I missed while looked on cards

Some differences:
1. Resources and costs are not connected to spheres. So having 2 Lore 1 spirit hero you can cast 3 cost spirit card turn one
2. There are no separate encounter/quest/etc phases just alternating activations between you and Sauron 
3. Threat meter generates negative events upon reaching certain threat thresholds 
4. Fate meter generates positive events when consumed. It is generated by char willpower (this replaces questing)

While game is still in early access and has bugs I already had great fun. Developers seem to be quite community oriented. The react to bug reports as well to discussion post and strive to provide a meaningful info on what they are currently doing every week.

So to reiterate: for all who enjoy paper one - I can already recommend. For those new to the game - I would wait for tutorial or play coop for better experience.

ดูเหมือนว่า LotR LCG จะเป็นหนึ่งในไม่กี่เกมที่ใช้ช่วงเวลาการเป็น EA ได้อย่างคุ้มค่า  เพราะปัญหาทั้งหลายแหล่ที่ตัวผมเองเคยได้เผชิญในช่วงที่เกมเพิ่งจะเปิดให้ทดลองนั้นได้รับการแก้ไขเรียบร้อยเกือบจะทั้งหมด  และเมื่อมีการ์ดให้เลือกใช้เยอะขึ้น  ความเฉียบของ Gameplay จึงเริ่มที่จะเห็นได้ชัดขึ้น

LotR LCG ไม่ใช่เกมที่ผู้เล่นสองฝ่ายจะต้องมาแข่งกัน  แต่ผู้เล่นจะได้รับบทเป็นเหล่าฮีโร่ในจักรวาลของลุงโทลคีน (อารากอน กลอร์ฟินเดล ดาอิน ฯลฯ) เพื่อที่จะรับมือกับเซารอนและสมุน  ตัวเกมนั้นให้อารมณ์คล้ายกันกับการเล่น RPG แบบ Tabletop ที่คุณจะต้องใช้ความสามารถของการ์ดเพื่อเอาชนะศัตรูและแก้ไขสถานการณ์ต่าง ๆ

แม้ดูแค่เพียงผ่าน  ตัวเกมอาจจะแลดูคล้ายกับ Hearthstone (ซึ่งก็เหมือนจริง ๆ โดยเฉพาะในส่วนของ Combat)  แต่จุดที่ต่างก็คือชัยชนะของคุณไม่ได้มาจากการไล่ตีศัตรูอย่างบ้าคลั่งเพียงเท่านั้น  ฮีโร่และการ์ดที่คุณมีนั้นจะถูกแบ่งเป็น 4 สายและแต่ละสายนั้นก็จะมีจุดเด่นและเอกลักษณ์เฉพาะอันต่างกัน  คุณสามารถที่จะใช้การ์ดในสาย Lore เพื่อรักษาตัวเอง  สาย Leadership เพื่อป้องกัน  สาย Tactical เพื่อต่อสู้ และสาย Spirit เพื่อหยุดศัตรูและหลบเลี่ยงจากเซารอนและเหตุการณ์อันไม่พึงประสงค์  คุณจำเป็นที่จะต้องใช้การ์ดจาก 4 สายนี้มาผสมเข้าด้วยกันเป็น Deck และนำไปใช้เล่นกับ Campaign ของเกมที่มี GM คือ AI  (ไม่ต้องห่วงไปว่า AI จะโง่จนคุณสามารถจะเอาชนะได้ง่าย ๆ  ในความยากระดับสูง  พวกมันฉลาดพอที่จะทำให้ชีวิตของพวกเรายากลำบากได้ไม่น้อยแม้แต่สำหรับชาว Strategy โดยกำเนิดเช่นผม)

ในช่วงชั่วโมงแรก ๆ คุณอาจจะสัมผัสได้ว่าเกมมันช่างยากชะมัดและเกมก็เน้นไปที่ Combat ค่อนข้างหนัก  แต่เมื่อคุณเริ่มที่จะเรียนรู้ Trick เกี่ยวกับการเล่นกับ Guard, Terror, Restore และ Event เฉพาะในแต่ละพื้นที่ของ Campaign  คุณก็จะพบว่าเกมนั้นง่ายและมีความซับซ้อนมากกว่าที่เห็นมาก  ถ้าคุณเป็นคนชอบเกมแนว Strategy ที่ฮาร์ดคอร์อยู่พอตัว  เกมนี้ก็คงจะถูกใจคุณเป็นอย่างมาก  (กระนั้นผมก็ไม่คิดว่ามันจะเหมาะกับคนเล่นการ์ดสาย Casual โดยทั่วไปสักเท่าใดนัก)

และถึงแม้การจ่ายเงินจริงเพื่อซื้อ Expansions (ที่มาพร้อมกับการ์ดและ Campaign) ออกจะฟังดูไม่เข้าท่าสักเท่าใดนักสำหรับสายฟรี  แต่ส่วนตัวผมเองรู้สึกพอใจมากกับมัน  เพราะอย่างน้อยสิ่งที่คุณได้รับกลับมาก็คือของที่คุณต้องการจะได้จริง ๆ ไม่ต้องไปลุ้นสุ่มเอาแบบระบบกาชา  สรุปแล้วก็คือตัวเกมนั้นอาจจะไม่ถูกใจสายฟรี  แต่หลาย ๆ คนที่พอจะมีทุนอยู่บ้าง  สิ่งที่คุณจะได้รับนั้นก็จัดได้ว่าคุ้มกับเงินที่คุณจ่าย (การ์ดใน Expansions ช่วยเปิดตัวเลือกใหม่ ๆ ให้แก่คุณได้เยอะมากและ Campaign ก็เป็นสิ่งที่คุณสามารถที่จะเวียนกลับไปเล่นเพื่อ Valor Points และลอง Deck ใหม่ ๆ ได้หลายรอบมาก ๆ)

ณ ขณะที่เขียนบทวิจารณ์นี้  ตัวเกมอาจจะอยู่ในช่วง EA  แต่ส่วนตัวผมเองก็ออกจะพอใจในทิศทางที่เกมกำลังดำเนินไปมาก ๆ  และ (ในความเห็นของผม) คงจะดีกว่านี้มากถ้าตัวเกมเลือกที่จะเปลี่ยนไปใช้กรอบการ์ดแบบอื่นที่ไม่ใช่รูปไข่ (ผมว่ากรอบการ์ดแบบ MTG Arena ก็สวยดีนะ)

++ เกมการ์ดที่เน้นใช้กลยุทธ์มากกว่าการสุ่มและไล่ตีอย่างบ้าคลั่ง
+ คุณได้ในสิ่งที่คุณจ่าย  ไม่ใช่กาชา
+ ภาพของการ์ดแต่ละใบงามมาก ๆ และรายละเอียดในเกมนั้นก็อ้างอิงถึงหนังสือเป็นหลัก  ไม่ใช่จากภาพยนตร์ (ถ้าผมเข้าใจไม่ผิดจากชื่อ  มีการ์ดบางใบที่ถูกวาดโดยคนไทยด้วยละ)
-- กรอบการ์ดรูปไข่สุดอัปลักษณ์ที่ถูกมาใช้เพื่อเกาะกระแสการ์ดดิจิตอลกระแสหลักอย่าง Hearthstone
+/- ปัญหาทางเทคนิคบางประการ (ที่มักจะเจอหลังอัพเดท)  แต่ก็มักจะถูกแก้ไขโดยรวดเร็วโดยทีมพัฒนาเมื่อได้รับแจ้ง (ทีมพัฒนาขยันและใส่ใจในงานมาก  หรืออย่างน้อยก็ในช่วง EA นี้)

I love the original LotR LCG and despite it being rock hard in places it's a game where I usually feel that if I failed it's because I made a mistake. I also love deck-building games in general, both physical and digital and spend a huge amount of time playing them.  I'm also a professional game designer and when I'm playing games I can usually see why developers have chosen a particular path or why some things might look unbalanced at first glance.

Now having said all that, to me there is one particular core problem with this implementation of the LCG that underpins everything else.  A lot of people complain about the difficulty - and there is definitely an issue there - but again I think that also stems from the decision to take a game that is built around being able to play your entire turn in one go (allowing you to accomplish a number of things, synergise and leverage card powers, and leave your play area in a solid state for the enemy to try and break down) and turn it into a one-action-each game that plays like Hearthstone.

Now I really like the gameplay in Hearthstone (though I'm not a fan of how much you have to pay to stay competitive - but that's another story) but Hearthstone was built around that gameplay model from the ground up.  Its mechanics, its characters, their abilities, are all designed with that 'you go - I go' alternating action model in mind.  LotR LCG and its mechanics were never designed to work like that, and it feels very much like the developers have tried to keep enough of the original cards and their abilities to try and appease the card game players, but change what they had to in order to make it play like Hearthstone and appeal to those players - and what you're left with is a muddy mess of mechanics that is neither one thing nor the other.  When I compare the balance and mechanics in this game to something like, say, Slay the Spire, there's no comparison in terms of the depth of strategy between them.  Slay the Spire is an incredibly RNG-driven game, and you would expect it to be much harder to put together winning strategies or plan ahead to try and pull off a really cool combo, but in truth it's far more forgiving in terms of its strategic elements than this adaptation of LotR LCG.

I really can't see me ever going back to this game.  Playing it made me want to go back and play the card game again, and it made me want to play Hearthstone again, but this collision of two radically different game mechanics ideologies is just a bottomless pool of frustration.",1552498996,1552498996,False,2,0,0.53137582540512085,0,True,False,True,False,,,

UPDATE May 29th: 
The game received a huge overhaul and hence i have to revise my initial statement about the game. Many things of the game have improved immensly, including:
[*] a full-fledged tutorial that deserves its name; they also included a story with it and you get a new quest to play for free
[*] the reward system has greatly improved with higher replayability and versatility
[*] thanks to the new reward system, you acquire the ingame resource to buy cards way easier than before which reduces grinding for fellowship (previously called valor points)
[*] coop has now two difficulty modes, easy and hard
[*] cosmetics have been added to the game which can be acquired via play (fellowship) or is part of the new reward system
[*] each hero now has a (sort of hidden) quest, which when completed gives a themed card, increasing replayability
[*] deckbuilding has been improved and new pre-build decks have been added after completing the tutorial
[*] a save function has been implemented, which saves your game automatically after completing each location; due to the fact that a play session can take between 20-30 minutes and an hour this is a great addition if you have not much time
[*] and many other tweaks, including the delay of sauron mentioned in my initial review

It is evident, that the developers took the player feedback to heart and it is great to see a developer that listens to their community. Furthermore, they actually delivered exactly as announced unlike before (and are more careful now when giving out a release date), hence they seem to be learning from their mistakes.

FINAL VERDICT:
 This game is now very close to were it should be, hence i can  definitely recommend this game. The one thing that needs improvement is variety, variety of cards and quests to play. But this will take time and for a new game this is just a natural thing. I haven't encountered any major bugs or other issues, but I've been told that others have. So if you want to stay on the safe side, wait for full release, otherwise there is no excuse anymore. This game is a great experience for fans of Lord of the Rings and digital card games that offer a well told cooperative and solo experience.

TL;DR: After its last patch, a great many things have improved (including tutorial, deckbuilding, difficulty, coop experience and a save function among other things) and it is now a hidden gem among digital card games. Definitely recommended!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I thought hard about giving this game a recommendation or not. I decided not to, because of the current state of the game. First the good part:
[list] [*] The story is told well, the speakers are great.
        [*] The mechanics are more indepth than Hearthstone or any of their follow-ups.
        [*] The randomness of the mechanics is very low, great for strategic play.
        [*] No random card boster packs. Everything you earn or buy is set from the beginning. You know what you buy (or earn).
       [*] 3 difficulty level (easy, normal and hard) for each playstyle
       [*] AI behaves rather intelligent, makes fun to play against opponent
       [*] board graphics and graphics of the cards look beautiful
       [*] it's Lord of the Rings!
       [*] it is focused on single-player experience, which is rare for a DCG
       [*] cooperative mode
       [*] the developers are very transparent what they are working on and what's coming next to the game with a weekly wrap-up on steam and a twitch stream

 and now the cons:
       [*] the overall difficulty level is too high, the devs have acknowledged that and are working on it...
       [*] ...but the overall pace of development is far too slow. let me give you an example. the 2nd expansion should have been released in early january but got postponed to ""a later week"" and eventually got released on march 12th...
      [*] coop got released but only in one difficulty level
      [*] since a recent update, the AI takes longer than before to make its turn and sometimes hangs for a few seconds before it starts to make its move
      [*] for 8 bucks (lowest founder pack) the game is worth the price, but i think for approx. 19$ it is too expensive, especially given the current state of the game.
[/list]

Personally, i have stopped playing at the moment, because for me as a casual player even the lowest difficulty level is a bit too hard. In particular quest 4 of the first campaign. I will wait for a balance patch to deploy and see how the game fares giving time. I really wish the game all the best for the future and i hope it can overcome the obstacles currently present. I may give a ""recommended"" if things look better, but for now i can only recommend this game for players who enjoy a challenge.

TL;DR: If you are a hardcore player who enjoys a challenge and love The Lord of the Rings or digital card games focused on solo content, i recommend this game. If you are not, wait a little while until the game is more polished.",1552395721,1559133109,True,0,0,0.603021681308746338,7,False,False,True,False,,,

 Sauron is so favored that even if you painstakingly realize the best deck possible for a particular quest or whatever it's called, you will still lose 19 out of 20 times or worse. It's like dressing a up a poker game around the strategy that you must get a royal flush. Even then you could still lose it feels.

Now I have only been playing for a few days...but to be fair, there is nothing much to this game as far as content. Which is fine...It's in early release etc.....Fine with that sorta.......Not so much as well, but the point is iv'e played several CCG's.
I was 50 points shy of being a master level chess player when I stopped playing chess, so it's not like I am terrible at strategy games...I do not believe I am good at this game, certainly not yet, but I can see why it is hard. It is heavily slanted towards the PC. The game is not hard because it's AI is clever....It is hard because the cards Sauron has are just way better than you when you combine them with the meter on the right that brings brutal elements to Saron's favor.

Can you play it on easy? Yes.... How that means you will fair in multiplayer? Not good it seems. Making this feel like it's going to morph into a PAY TO WIN for the vast majority! Playing the same battles over and over again waiting for things to just work out just perfectly right sound like torture to me....Why would I pay for that? 

Having said all that I realize I may be missing something...I will also keep an interest in this game. But I suspect, or really fear, that this game is going to be like many strategy games I have wasted money on here on Steam because it made it's difficulty level just not fun to overcome.

Please take the time to look into the game and find out how much it has to offer.

This is a great game already and has the potential to be even better.  The current pricing of the game is extremely fair and provides more hours worth of content for the money than many games, if you like trying all the heroes and deck building.  If all you want is to use the strongest deck possible that someone else made and just beat the game once and be done, then yes you will probably be disappointed.

The brilliance in the game currently is the scoring system and the reward (valor points) system used to purchase the additional cards.  The valor system rewards better play and using all the heroes, which gives motivation to play through the quests multiple times to get all the rewards for all of the heroes and learn more about the game and try new things.  It also allows you to earn a lot of valor quickly if you want to put in the work without giving away everything right away.  I think that a few more tweaks to the scoring could add even more and make it better as well.

It is difficult until you learn it, but what fun would it be if it wasn't somewhat challenging.  If you are struggling there is enough information in the steam community and on deckbuilding websites to get you over the hump.  I am not a card game expert i have casually played 2 other games like this one and I am figuring it out, my friend that i convinced to get the game is an expert at theses games has played almost all of them and has published decks that were the most popular and he likes the game and finds it fun and challenging.  It's starting to get a little easy for him but he is an expert.  Also, watch a video of someone playing, tempo, action economy and getting everything out of each round by using the buffs and special abilities properly is the key to this game.

As far as criticisms, the new multiplayer needs tuning.  It is brand new though and based on the past changes to the other parts of the game I am confident they will tune it.  The doubling of everything and the additional resources Sauron has makes it this long war of attrition that makes it take 4x as long as a single player game and makes you feel exhausted by the time you are done.  Multiplayer needs a way for it to be harder without being longer.   I still had fun but it needs tuning.

They already have new content coming out, and I can't wait.  I fully recommend this game it is fun and worth the money and its only in beta.

+ dobrá orientace v herním menu a na soubojových polích.
+  celkem zajímavé charaktery a jejich ilustrace např. Tom Took,Bombadil atd.

Protiklady
- ve hře jsem zatím neobjevil žádný bug,drastický problém nebo herní nedostatek ( mám nahráno pár  hodin )

Můj názor 
- do hry bych časem přidal třeba více méně známých hrdinů např. Argeleb,Cirdan,Elendil a pod. ( možno ve hře jsou,těžko říct,zda ano tak se omlouvám)
- a nebo možnost rozšířit Deck ( balíček hraních karet ) ze 30 za 45.

We're sorry to hear that you feel this way, but this is actually the highest cost bundle (Mithril) that was previously available in the old multi-tiered monetization model that Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game used. There is now only a single tier payment of 15.99€ that provides you with access to the full core set of the game—you can learn more about what is included in this on the Steam Store page.

A swath of content is being added over time in the form of new cards and encounters, like the new cards announced here (https://steamcommunity.com/games/509580/announcements/detail/3535792899894096097) and the recent King of Carrion encounter. These will come at no extra charge to players. We will also be launching additional campaigns and other bonus DLC content which will be available for a small cost, like the Shadow's Fall campaign to be released soon.

In regards to the Dev team's passion and the tutorial, we have never wavered in our desire to make this the best Lord of the Rings game that we can and will continue to deliver quality content to the best of our ability! 

The tutorial is something that we are currently improving as well. We detailed our development roadmap in the below blog, so be sure to take a read if you want to know what is coming in the future!
https://steamcommunity.com/games/509580/announcements/detail/1689314410069762158

We hope that you'll give Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game another try and that you'll have fun enjoying all of the content that we are working to get into your hands!"

Красивая карточная PvE игра с кооперативом. 
Для любителя Средиземья здесь есть все - фирменная атмосфера с реверансами в сторону кинотрилогии, нарядная стилистика, неплохие арты (тут как раз без привязки к питерджексоновскому творению).
В игре пока нет русского языка, и если с правилами разобраться можно, то читать/слушать литературные вставки, которые написаны ""под Толкиена"", вряд ли получится.

Опишу игровой процесс: Вы собираете колоду из 3 героев и 30 вспомогательных карт: юниты поддержки, предметы (которые можно повесить на героев или юнитов) и события (ивенты с разными эффектами, контрспеллы). Она одна на все задание.
Играете против ИИ Саурона с колодой ""темных сил"".
Каждый раунд получаете очки на то, чтобы сыграть карты, пришедшие в руку, а также распоряжаетесь уже находящимися в игре персонажами.
Они имеют три параметра: очки атаки, очки выполнения целей и здоровье. 
Очки выполнения целей - по сути та же ""атака"", только для другого типа карт соперника, которые каждый ход приносят тот или иной эффект.
Задание состоит из нескольких боев, с перерывами на сюжет, представленный в форме коротеньких аудио-рассказов. Каждый новый раунд для вас начинается с состояния, на котором вы закончили предыдущий. Интересная механика, так как можно задержаться в раунде, который уже вроде бы выигран, чтобы лучше подготовиться к следующему, а в результате напороться на неприятности.
Есть шкала ""угроза"", которая заполняется и уменьшается в зависимости от разных действий, она гонит вас вперед по раундам и влияет на итоговый счет. Необходимо поддерживать баланс между уроном, отхилом, сдерживанием угрозы, что является основным фактором при создании колоды.
Присутствует кооперативный режим - задания длятся дольше, что при низкой динамике процесса может заставить заскучать.",1548463000,1688588815,True,73,0,0.832667529582977295,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Right now there are indeed a few bugs.  Some slight locking up and freezing, the card clicks don't register at times, that sort of thing.  But nothing is game breaking and obviously the game is still being worked upon.  I think this game will really be something special.

It is refreshing, as is the table top version, to have a game that is single player or cooperative.  Typically, card games are against another player or an A.I. player.  I love the quest format and working together.  I'll be very curious to see how multiplayer functions down the road.

This is a relaxing game of skill.  It has a very high learning curve.  It is definitely not something you can master in a short time.  I cannot wait to see what is in store for us players!

I sat on this for a while, but have been playing more the last couple days, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit indeed. This stands on its own as a fun time full of puzzling challenges to overcome. At the time of this review I am working on the 4th quest, and have the first three pretty much on farm with the two decks I've made so far. There was indeed a learning curve, but it seems that most of that was learning to actually defend and getting the exploration bonuses is very important. It literally just started to click with me after a few games yesterday and today, and I was a millimeter from completing quest 4 as well, a very exciting 2nd attempt. I'll get it soon enough, I suppose. 

UPDATE: After a nice sleep, cleared The Shadow's Reach campaign, chapter 4 is definitely the challenging part there. Very fun all around.

I also enjoy the bonus for clearing each quest with each hero, in that it encourages more deckbuilding. (And gets me more cards.)

Gameplay mechanics are complex and deep, and while the card pool is currently not large, it has a good number of mechanics that are unique, interesting, and fun. I've yet to play the paper version, which is reportedly different.

The art is great and I was very happy to see it not simple clones of the movie depictions of these characters, yet they have a deep respect and understanding for the source material. The backgrounds are beautifully crafted and combined with the music and voice acting. 

It is challenging but not as impossible as some have claimed. If you want a game you can face roll your way through, look elsewhere but if what you want is an enjoyable, engaging card game with interesting mechanics and reams of atmosphere look no further.

This game is in early access and so is far from perfect in execution. There are a few quality of life improvements that would make the game nicer, and I can't wait for more content to be added.

This review was first written during EA, and is now updated to latest events.

At release game texts and cards were not presented well. Text rendering was especially bad. Things have been going better since. There was a second problem with the price of expansions; this problem was removed in Dec 2019.

You now have three free campaigns/expansions (meaning 15 adventures, each of several steps) + 3 separate adventures + the Galadriel procedural / replayable mission.

This is a lot of content! and every adventure has specific rewards you can look for, and each can also be played and won with every hero for more rewards.

Time to gift the game to friends and play coop :D


EDIT 2:
I did gift it and played coop!

The coop game is a bliss.
Story mode is much too easy, and Challenge mode is really hard; players should still play Challenge on coop, in my opinion, for maximum pleasure.


EDIT 3:
Please note that since a change of developers there has been no update, except a drastic (and worse imo) change in game menu. The new developers had immense ambitions for the game but we had no news since some time. But the title as it stands still gives access to a lot of gameplay!

======================================

I will try in this review to be comprehensive.

Other reviews kept me away from this game for months and I believe it is important for you now to determine the ""truth"" and to know if this LCG is a great game or not, and if it is a game for you.


[h1]What kept me away for so long[/h1]

From screenshots and reviews there was one main thing that was horrifying to me:
I thought that the game was dumbed down!
That it was looking like some sort of Hearthstone clone!
That the concepts and mechanics of the game were transformed into their simplest version!

Others were mentioning also the price model in their review: not enough Valor received, purchases too expensive, too much grinding etc.

And the elephant in the room: unfortunately it's a game inspired by the physical card game and reproducing its spirit, but not a digital full remake of it.

[h1]What I found[/h1]

To be honest what I found instead was a great gem of a game: with much care and passion given to the narrative, to voice overs, to illustrations, to keep you in the world of Middle Earth; and even more to the mechanics of the game.

What is still true is that you cannot consider this game like a 100 percent faithful port (or even a 80 % one).

You must consider this game like a new game of its own.

But contrary to the impressions I received so far, it still deserves to call itself LOTR:LCG and had an impressive way of putting together the concepts & mechanics in ways that are still very deep, faithful and quite adapted to a computer game.


[h1]About Difficulty and Duration[/h1]

I took the game with the base Shire Pack and customized my own deck from it; no special pack used and no valor card purchased. It took me several attempts and 3 hours of calm, non-rushed play, to beat the first quest at Normal Difficulty.

Every adventure is a series of quests. We now have 3 campaigns of 5 quests each, and 3 encounters. I estimate it needs 10-40 hours of gameplay in order to beat one campaign and one encounter, and we have 3 times that now. 

To me, it is satisfying. The game is challenging and a real pleasure to play. More about pros and cons below, but I would disagree with opinions about the game being: too easy or too short. What you get here is a solo content above anything provided so far by card games (even TES Legends) and I think it is important to have proper information and understand what you currently get.

I think the mention about it being ""too hard"" is because it's hard to receive max Valor for a quest.

[h1]About the Price Model[/h1]

The price model has been 'fixed' and improved during EA. Although a bit problematic at release (ie. expansions) it is now almost entirely free. 

You can earn as much Valor (now has another name!) as possible by being successful at Quests, and then spend it for cards. Purchasing a rare powerful card from the Valor Store costs 1500, and a successful Quest gives you 2000 if you played new heroes (a hero nets you a +500 bonus when he beats it for the first time).

An adventure of 5 quests should give you around 10 000 Valor, and you can even max that above it.


[h1]About the Narrative[/h1]

The narrative was the best surprise I had. You have large illustrations, a voiced narrator, new voice overs from Gollum, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and it's of top notch movie-quality; and writing is even better, with much style and middle earth ominous writing style.

Note that I tested the game in english language, as I had doubts about translations quality.

Some card illustrations are absolutely great. However cards suffer from the invasive and colorful template with symbols for Threat, Combat, Willpower and Health.


[h1]About Mechanics[/h1]

My last point will be about the mechanics. I was worried about that a lot before trying the game.

Heroes generate Threat at the beginning of an adventure. You must not reach 50 Threat, and at different thresholds Sauron can unleash a new event. All Threat powers are relatively powerful, as they should be. I disagree with opinions mentioning that you could put ""all your most powerful heroes in your deck"" and not ""think about Threat"", however that sounds true in ""Story"" difficulty (=easy mode) but not on ""Challenge"" difficulty (=normal mode).

I have been in situations where just one, two, or three points of Threat were the difference between victory or defeat just because of some event. However, players will certainly master Threat more and more, and players purchasing cards from the Valor Store will have an easier and easier experience over time, and will then be able to put powerful Heroes without any second thought; at least with first campaign ;)

Threat mechanics, in my opinion, was perfectly ported and balanced.

Heroes can generate Fate by using your action, and at certain thresholds can use it for one-time positive effects. These effects are different for every quest chapter.

For instance, in first chapter of first quest, I could use it to receive supplies (2 Fate), to exhaust enemies (4 Fate), or to have Gloin join the part (7 Fate). The Fate mechanics was perfectly balanced too in my experience, as I was forced sometimes to rush and forget about it and other times was able to use it.

Activating Fate or Threat does not take your turn, but everything else does: attacking, playing one card, or using a card power.

You take an action, then your enemy does the same, until you cannot play any action or card. 

You can attack creatures with Combat, and locations/events with Willpower.

Any unit can decide to guard. Guarding is an action which takes your turn and your guard unit will be exhausted in one attack. Guarding is the only way to deal damage when defending. It is well thought and different from other games.

When you play an adventure, you play it like a campaign, keeping your card hand, resources, cards in play etc from one chapter to the next; deciding between rushing or not makes for great replayability and risky decision-making. 

I am satisfied by the mechanics of the game, deeper that what the screenshots hinted at me; developers if you read this, please use screenshots to hint at how deep the game is, how great the writing is!

A strong negative was (is still?) the current card collection. Not enough cards and the real drawback is that deck building is made much easier, but also less deep than in the original game. I hope that will be improved, and is currently the main negative I have to mention!

PS: I had no special network setup to do to play the game and no need to apply the network recommendations from store page.

But developers should make the game fullscreen by default at first launch, it was currently at EA and resized window has bad antialiasing on fonts/textures/etc.",1547110860,1676557152,True,205,4,0.89100569486618042,5,True,False,False,False,,,

1. This is a very good game which needs more polish. But that can only happen if the developers do so. And this will happen if enough players play it. So give it a try and read the positive feedback for this game. Not the negative because:

2. The negative reviews here are: ""This is not the living card game which I own"" or: ""The missions are very hard and you cant beat them even with buying the expensive pack"".

Please guys, its inspired by the card game which already exists but its very nice and slightly different. And yeah its kinda hard but if you check the cards, built one or two decks and do some trial and error it will work. trust me ;). Soundtrack, gameplay, difficulty level and motivation all in one. And it isn`t a hearthstone clone! I swear!

PS: Its not pay to win. You get more Avatar pictures and stuff like that but the prices are horrific. Do yourself a favour and buy the starter pack. Its the cheapest and you get the whole experience.

This game lacks immersion and it lacks complexity, what I believe are the heart and soul which make the tabletop version so wonderful.

A longer summary:

I am a lifelong Tolkien fan who only recently discovered (and instantly fell in love with) The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (also known as LOTR:LCG, the tabletop version). In addition to the core box, I own the entire Mirkwood cycle, as well as the Haradrim cycle. Much to the chagrin of my wife, I’ll probably be buying into as many cycles as Fantasy Flight Games reprints or releases. That said, it only made sense to jump into the Early Access of the digital version produced by Asmodee Digital.

Unfortunately, I have to ditto the assessment of many others who say that the digital game is only ""okay"" for now, or even just ""meh,"" even at the relatively low $8 entry. There are a couple of major issues, in my opinion:

My first complaint, that I struggle to put into words, exactly, is stylistic. The digital version just doesn’t feel Middle-earth-y enough. I don’t know if this is because of Asmodee Digital’s choice of fontstyle not looking elfish or dwarfish enough to my eyes, or if it is because of the ridiculously fancy, lightsaber-esque lens flare effects whenever I hover my cursor over anything. Maybe, it is because of the bright primary color banners and icons on the cards. I don't know. I just know there’s just something terribly lacking in the immersion department. I love sitting in my cozy office, with my German Shepherd at my feet and a pipe clenched in my teeth, and sleeving the beautiful cards that come with the tabletop version. I love holding the cards under my reading lamp to admire the artwork, read the lore, and remind myself of the various effects the card brings to my decks. But in the digital version, none of the cards have lore and really very little in the way of complexity.

And this is really my main complaint. While Asmodee Digital could probably relatively easily add the missing lore and Middle-earth-ify the game a tad more, most of the elements of the tabletop edition which make it so fun, namely the mechanical depth, the nuances of deckbuilding, balancing the four resource pools, determining to quest or attack or defend, being careful to watch threat values, and the various wrinkles by way of planning out a hand and being encountered by shadow effects and the like, the developers have apparently determined NOT to add to the digital version of the game. I think this is a huge, huge mistake. I think most of the folks that invested in this Early Access title basically want a licensed, polished version of OCTGN, a fan-made tabletop simulation of the card game. What apparently a majority of us don't want (the game peaked at less than 30 players in the past 24 hours), is yet another Hearthstone -like game which, to quote other reviewers, is “distilled,” “watered-down,” “dumbed down,” “shallow,” and “soulless.” I think this lack of depth will be even more readily apparent once co-op is enabled.

I will continue to follow the game in its development, I'll piddle around with the new expansion packs (only if they are free), and I hope in time my review will reflect drastic changes in the direction that most of us fans of the tabeltop are hoping for... but right now, I’m afraid I can NOT recommend the game.",1544114699,1544115253,False,33,1,0.736667454242706299,5,True,False,True,False,,,

Keeping in mind it's an early access game and it does still need some polish here and there it's a solid digital version of The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game. Mind you it's not a 1:1, but it's still highly enjoyable.

Make sure to go into the Settings and try the tutorial, even if you've played LotR:LCG tabletop before, there are enough changes that you'll want to know what is going on here, now the tutorial will not cover Deck Building at all, but it's pretty straight forward (Pick Heroes, pick cards based on those heroes). 

Pros:
 If you've played any digital card game before and like the theme of Lord of the Rings,  this is very easy to pick up and play.

Voice Acting is good. 

Artwork is great.

Few Cons I Have:
 The Scoring, I've had a few times where I feel like I've had great runs, cleared every location (both hazards and enemies), but because I ignored using Fate because of how my deck was built I'm penalized for it.

No ""Are You Sure?"" prompt when deleting a deck. 


All in all, I'd give this game a 7 out of 10, but could easily improve upon full release

First of all, I have not encountered any of the glitches and bugs that some others have - for me, the game runs perfectly, there has been nothing wrong with playability, and the game is beautifully executed. As far as the first campaign goes, it has felt to me as good as a finished product. 

I love the tabletop Lord of the Rings LCG, and I knew before purchasing that this is not going to be an exact conversion of the tabletop game, which made me a little bit disappointed at first. But here's my most important two cents: Now I'm happy it is not the same game. In my opinion, this digital version keeps the core of the tabletop game, but with variations, different mechanics and new things to discover; for me, it hits the perfect balance of giving me an essentially new game, but still being unmistakably Lord of the Rings LCG. 

So far I've only used normal difficulty level, and yes, indeed the AI opponent is somewhat ""dumb"": it rarely makes optimal choices, and sometimes leaves actions unused. Anyway, the quests are still challenging enough, especially in the beginning, before getting a hang on the game. I don't feel that the AI hurts the feel of the game, either; orcs and spiders are not a very organized bunch, and it feels kind of suitable that their attacking is somewhat random.

The music is actually really good, the voiced acted original stories that acompany the gameplay are a welcome inclusion and really help with the immersion and atmosphere of the entire experience. The inclusion of co-op later on in development is something that im really excited about as well.

They've really shot themselves in the foot with this game I feel. I can see what they were trying to do, appeal to some of the playerbase of Hearthstone who may also like LOTR, and I'll admit that's a fair business decision. And they also thought they'd appeal to the existing, massive fanbase of the LOTR LCG tabletop version. Unfortunately, the execution is poor enough that they've alienated the TT players, like myself, who balk at the dumbing down of the rules and the fact that it's way too radically different from TT to be enjoyable, and at the same time, its pricing model has failed to pull in the Hearthstone crowd as well, looking at the Steam player numbers. So they've failed on both sides.

I think they know this, their internal meetings must know that player numbers for this game on Steam are around ~52 players at any one time. And they've seen their forums and know the TT crowd is largely unhappy to not have a direct conversion of the TT game. So either some hard decisions need to happen or I don't think this game will survive very long after release and will be abandoned by the devs. Just my two cents.",1540825431,1540825431,False,19,0,0.617611289024353027,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Great art, voice acting and progressive and immersive game play.

The gameplay is engaging but the deck choice is not flexible. There are very few builds that actually let you win a questline. Good luck if you don't have multiple cards that give your characters the block skill.

The start of a very good game if the stability is sorted and spirit becomes a viable card set.

The fact that multiplayer is officially coming and *is* in the works, makes this worth investing in too (one of the best aspects of the original card game).

It is more fun than I expected, and deeper than it looks. It is much more streamlined than its physical equivalent (which I have also played), but that is not a bad thing.

This game may not be free during early access, but it is still very cheap for what you get. Don't feel like you need to buy the biggest pack, either. I bought the Steward of Gondor pack, and was still able to unlock all the cards within a few weeks. You really only need a better pack if you want the exclusive cosmetics or want to unlock everything sooner.

Fantasy Flight Interactive has been incredible during Early Access. FFI is responsive and generous, everything you could hope for. The card pool is currently limited, but I am very excited for full access. This game is only going to improve as more content is released.

If I had to make one complaint, it's that the game doesn't try very hard to fit with LotR canon. The physical card game has a similar problem. When there are currently only 8 heroes in the game, why is one of them the made-up ""Tom Took""? And what is Bilbo doing back in Mirkwood again? But these are minor complaints from a Tolkien purist. All in all the game is very fun.

To sum up, the game is quick and simple, but still deep and engaging. If you are even slightly a LotR fan, give it a try!

The transition to digital format makes for some major and mostly positive changes to gameplay, IMO - randomness, easier value tracking, no manual setup for scenarios.  

There are two major drawbacks:

First, the microtransactions feel pretty heavy-handed.  The card packs are not expensive, but you don't get much with each one and you will likely find yourself wanting multiple packs to create the synergies you want for your deck.  It's understandable as a monetization strategy, but providing a bit more viable content in front of the monetization wall would feel more welcoming to casual and new players.

Second, the UI is useable, but clunky, and it makes tasks like deck-building a chore.  previewing cards in small sets on screen makes the decision-making process difficult and really turns me off to that aspect of the experience.  

And viewing details of cards in play is also cumbersome, requiring the player to click on a card to view it.  During some selection modes, you can't click the cards on the table, so you must rely on your memory or best-guess to make good targeting decisions.  For example, during upkeep, you might be prompted to deal 1 damage to an enemy target (via Legolas).  The valid targets are all highlighted, but you can't click on them to see their details before making your selection.  If you target the wrong enemy which has the ""Block"" trait, your damage is nullified, so you end up trying to memorize the traits in play before such prompts pop up.  I would recommend using a mouse-over preview mechanic which remains active during target selection instead, so players can quickly see the cards and make their decisions without any accidental stray clicks.

Another UI fail in my mind is how traits are handled on the cards.  When a character is modified and given a new trait through a card effect, the card icon gets a little purple pip over it.  That pip stands for any and all modifiers the character might have - strength boost, guard, block, whatever.  You still need to view the card details to know what effects are on the card and as I noted earlier, that's not always easy.  Besides, some cards have native traits and others will be modified during a game.  The pip is sometimes downright misleading.  I would recommend adding a different color pip for each type of attachment (so you know it has been modified), but also using a unique icon for each major trait which is displayed on the card icons on the table.  This way a player could know at a glance which characters had Block or other traits and make decisions accordingly.  Characters with Guard are given a unique visual treatment.  This approach should be used for all traits which are important for target selection.

The game itself is pretty solid and enjoyable, but you'll quickly find yourself wanting to buy content to deepen and lengthen the experience.  Hopefully, the developers will work on streamlining the UI so players can focus more on the game itself and less on how to play it.  I could recommend this game with a little more TLC.",1538521171,1538521171,False,31,0,0.699132084846496582,0,True,False,True,False,,,

In the campaign you have to build a deck to defeat Sauron by completing objectives. 

It has similarities to games like Heartstone but there's more depth to it thanks to a third card attribute called ""Willpower"" in addition to health and attack. There's various purposes it can be used for like add it to a pool, which if you have enough provides certain powers. There's also more actions for each card than just attack, like using powers or guarding.

You also have 3 heroes to chose for a deck with various abilities, these also affect the cards you can pick per deck. These heroes are put on the board at the start of the game and are very powerful. 

It is mostly a single player game with co-op in the future, so if you're looking for a pvp game, this might not be the card game you want.

The audio is excelent, the writing is good and the campaign story is voice acted. I like how each card you play is an important decission and you have to really think to solve a given situation. The graphics are nice but might need some work on the anti aliasing of the cards and text. There's also not a lot of cards at the moment so there's very limited versatility when building a deck. This is also the biggest reason you might want to hold of buying if you're interested in experimenting with a lot of decks.

What do I think: I really like this game and think it stands out from the crowd. Not only do I like the PvE concept but the theme, story elements, triggered events, the unique heroes and their abilities.

2. Experience: I've played a little bit of Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, and Faeria but relatively new to card games

3. Tougness: This game is definitely not easy, you really have to think what heroes and cards you want in your deck and when you want to play the cards. I am getting used to the gameplay in which a character action and card action are treated the same and the move-for-move turn style.

4. Replayability: Even though there is only on campaign right now I find each time it is a bit different depending on the events and cards Sauron plays. For instance just was decimated when Sauron summoned ten creatures on the board! 

4. Digital vs Physical: I never played the physical LOTR card games but I find that many physical card games can become bogged down and tedious. I really love the idea of digitizing card games because it flows a lot nicer and the developer can incorporate some unique elements that make the game more fun and engaging.

5. Co-Op: I can't wait to try the co-op mode which can make this game different than other popular card games. Edit: Just tried the co-op mode and I really like it. It adds another dimension of team tactics and deck building ideas. Even my brother liked it!

6. Other Reviews: It seems like other reviewers are unhappy because they expected a 1:1 physical to digital card game. Why would someone want to buy a digital version of something you can buy physically? Also how can you evolve and improve a game if all you did was copy the previous? Also some reviewers don't understand that early access means you are practically a test-player to offer feedback to help the developers improve. I believe that some of the previous issues have been addressed for those still interested in this game.

7. Overall: Currently this is one of my go-to games if I want something strategic and relaxing. Not only do I love LOTR but this living card game is already in my opinion going to be better than Hearthstone, Magic, or anything else. I can't really put my finger on why, but I found those other games somewhat flawed or monotonous in mechanics, dependant on chance, pay-to-win, and simply a money-pit. I'm not saying this game is perfect but I really like the direction the developers are taking. Cheers!",1537928480,1569971186,True,4,0,0.513166844844818115,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Furthermore, actions are now played in succession - every turn is started by the player and followed up by the AI until both pass. There are no more phases. As a result the fate and threat system work differently, granting bonuses and disadvantages when threshholds are reached. Threat is increased by 1 each turn automatically and effect by many card effect of the AI. Reaching 50 threat still loses the game as does losing all heroes.

The first campaign is free with the lowest buy on Steam. I enjoyed it a great time, even though it is quite rough and playtests the game more than it adds exotic mechanisms. The atmosphere, UI, Audio and Storytelling are superb! I played through the campaign multiple times and enjoyed it a lot.

The deckbuilding is not very well designed. To few filters (filtering for fragments of text on the card, traits,...) and information (e.g.: a cost curve for the deck) are available. However, that could be easily fixed by the designers. 

The price system is fair, motivating (you get currency based on your performance) and transparent. I would be very happy to buy the DLCs (New campaings) if they contain one new hero and some cards like in the card game. As it is usual for an LCG you dont open boosters but always know what you get. 


[b]TL;DR:[/b]
If the game tries more exotic and interesting mechanisms and tweaks with the AI and future campaigns it will replace the card game for me in points of fun. I recommend the game in it's current state, but it is not yet fully fleshed out.",1537895704,1537895806,True,1,0,0.490575820207595825,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There are board games that I have yet to even take the plastic off of. I love video games. My digital game backlog outgrows my ability to play games. So when two of my favorite worlds collided I kind of geeked out a tad bit. I’ve been a fan of Lord of the Rings since before I can remember. I have memories of sitting on the couch watching the Lord of the Rings animated movies as my dad tried to explain to me all the characters and what was going on. When I was older my best friend and I sat and watched all of the Extended Editions back to back while playing Lord of the Rings Online together. When Fellowship first came to theaters I choose to walk around all summer barefoot to make my feet tough and leathery like a hobbit. I am a nerd, and I love the world of Middle Earth. So yes, maybe I am not an authority on card games, I suck at MTG and fell out of competitive Hearthstone quickly, but I do live and breathe Lord of the Rings.

So it’s obvious I would be all over The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game for PC.  I picked the board game version up at my local gaming store years prior and devoured its contents. My friends and I played countless times and enjoyed the cooperative nature of the game. Being a “living card game” you don't need to buy boosters or hunt down the flavor of the month style cards. Everything you need is in the box. This doesn’t stop the developers from releasing expansions sets to add new cards and adventures, although everything you need is again in those boxes as well. The hook of these living card games was a huge draw to me, a scorned Magic player, and not needing to sink hundreds of dollars into a game just to stay relevant was awesome. If any of that can be replicated or emulated in the digital space, I truly believe this game will explode on the scene.
At its core, Lord of the Rings: LCG is a cooperative experience, and I was hoping it stayed that way in the digital adaptation. Although the game sports only a single player option at the moment, the digital take on this tabletop game stays true to its roots. If players are familiar with the physical version they will feel right at home in the new digital Middle Earth. Although not a copy and paste job, Fantasy Flight Interactive does a great job adapting the digital game to be very similar to the physical one. You’ll be completing quests, fighting monsters, and recruiting allies to fight by your side. Players unfamiliar with the game will still understand how to play after the first few hands if they are knowledgeable with games like Hearthstone and Eternal. Although Lord of the Rings has many unique and notable differences from a typical card game.

The main difference is defeating the enemy is not always the main goal. Completing quests by exhausting your heroes and spending their resource power can be more important than taking down that cave troll. This brings a lot of risk assessment and management to each action you take. Do you push your luck for a board clear and then whittle away at the quest or rush through the quest while taking damage from the monsters? Each tactic has its boons and setbacks, it’s up to you as the player to decide which is best and adapts depending on the cards you have. Each match has a few phases, maybe you're adventuring through the forest of Mirkwood and get attacked by spiders, the first round you’ll defeat the spiders then you’ll “adventure”  to the next phase where your companion has been captured and you must tear open the cocoon it was wrapped in. A few more phases and you’re fighting a giant spider who is the matches final boss. Each round has a unique objective, and these rounds are tied together with a compelling, although I believe noncanonical, story to form an action-packed match.

I am thoroughly enjoying my time spent in game. Each turn starts to feel more familiar and exciting, the story is interesting and compelling, and I haven’t once felt nickel and dimed while playing. I am excited to see the multiplayer they add and to see a roadmap of content for expansion releases. I really believe this game has the staying power for people who are tired of the same old types of collectible card games.",1537865663,1537865663,True,1,0,0.490575820207595825,1,False,True,True,False,,,

Interesting how?

It creates an interesting dynamic that makes the game quite challenging, especially on Hard mode.

The tabletop version is one of those games that I always feel I should get out and play, but usually end up leaving on the shelf in favor of something else. It's never quite as much fun as it shold be, because unless you really enjoy physical deckbuilding, it can be a pain to manage. I always see the potential for fun, but I rarely actually have, you know, fun.

This translation simplifies some things and adds some others, but keeps the essentials that make the game fun and strategic. In playing this - even for just 4 hours - I've found myself replaying the same scenario over and over again to see different ways of handling things and having a blast, whether I win or lose. I'm understanding the game better than I understood the tabletop version (and I spent many more hours on it).

Somehow, they managed carve out the things that were getting in the way of the fun for me, and amplify what makes the game brilliant. I own a number of electronic versions of tabletop games, and most go for a straight conversion. This is an approach that more should consider. 

Yes, it's expensive, but you should try the tabletop game some time. I do feel that the valor points are a little hard to come by, but this might get adjusted over time. Even if it doesn't, I've spent $15 so far, which is less than half of what I spent on just the base set that has been sitting on my shelf for most of the last 4 years.

The thing I think I don't like is the Palintir. One of the original selling points of the LCG model is that you always know what you're going to get for your money. No loot boxes, no random, ever. The game is so good that it doesn't need the gambling element. I wish they had stayed truer to the tabletop model. Marketing won the day on this one.

Overall, this is one of the best, if not the best, translations of a great tabletop game that I've seen. If you want the exact version of the card game, go to Tabletop Simulator. If you want something that changes the game and in doing so enhances what makes the game fun, give this a try.",1537701370,1537701370,True,1,0,0.490575820207595825,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Also the Sauron IA needs a rework as for now some decisions it takes are absurd (healing a creature already at full health or improving a creature low on health that is clearly going to die, for example).

Na última semana, pude acompanhar uma melhora substancial do jogo em termos de correção de bugs e até da liberação da primeira campanha.

Os bugs ainda existem, mas são mais raros, e agora, dia 07/09, houve uma melhoria muito necessária no custo de algumas cartas.

A minha única ressalva neste jogo é o grau de dificuldade das últimas missões; este é um jogo que fez fama por ser desafiador, mas em algumas missões, sinto um certo exagero. Nas últimas fases da primeira campanha, é extremamente difícil vencer na dificuldade normal com as cartas que nos são disponibilizadas. Para jogadores iniciantes, ou que não conhecem o jogo físico, isto pode ser bastante desencorajador.

Mesmo assim, as narrações entre missões são muito bem feitas, e as imagens de ilustração, bem escolhidas; isso consegue passar um clima e atmosfera bem interessante. A arte das cartas, no geral, é excelente.

The introductory card pool here is just about as tactically rich as it was in the paper LCG. You're still balancing health, quest progress, attack, defense, and resources as you attempt to survive a gauntlet of challenges and finish each scenario.

The only notable mechanic missing from the paper game is the Shadow cards dealt on enemy attacks; that, plus the fact that Sauron is now controlled by an AI, makes the challenges in each scenario feel less wild, more predictable. Depending on your taste, that's either a plus or a minus. I certainly have way fewer ""bad beat"" stories in this version of the game, for whatever that's worth.

On the other hand, there are welcome innovations in how the game tracks threat and handles excess questing power. 
In the paper game, threat controlled only whether certain enemies attacked. In this version, certain threat breakpoints unleash setbacks or new enemies that are more narratively driven. So you still feel good if you can ""sneak"" under those breakpoints by conserving threat, and the narrative bits help you feel more like you're playing through a story.
You are also allowed to ""store"" excess questing strength to use for mechanical bonuses later in the scenario; these also have little bits of narrative attached, and figuring out when and how to deploy the bonuses is now a large (and fun!) part of the game's strategy. 

These innovations also have the effect of helping to balance the different Hero factions, and where the paper LCG often felt like a series of puzzles that had to be solved by perfect hero and deck compositions, it feels like this game offers enough flexibility on Normal difficulty that most groups of heroes should be able to carefully pick their way through.

The presentation is certainly more streamlined than in the paper game, and that's something to be grateful for. No shuffling, no tokens, fewer fiddly rules interactions. And the economy is fine now that the first set of scenarios comes automatically unlocked -- I've had no problem getting my card pool to a point I feel comfortable with, even though I bought in at the lowest level.

Overall, this is a great game. I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth at 20 hours, and I suspect I'll hang in there for the long haul.",1536501945,1536501973,True,16,0,0.614803493022918701,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Of course it is a little different to the physical version as sauron plays using AI and the physical version you simply play what is written on the crads. If you want to play the physical game on a computer there are a few variants already to simply track your cards and tokens.

I have bought the shire bundle for around $6 and then added $10 to steam wallet to buy hero bundles etc and through play have most of the cards, which for $16 I think is good value.

I started off and really struggled to win any quests on easy using just the starter deck. But then I realised you can play guard on any hero or ally and that you can bank fate and play extra actions on the left of screen to do some good extras. Then the game really came into its own and really gives me the same buzz as the physical version and I have completed the entire campaign.

Having only one campaign has been quite useful though as I have been able to try several hero combinations and have learnt how they act differently. Also although there are not that many cards the deck size is only 30 so makes deck building easier.

Now I am really looking forward to some more quests to try the various decks on.

The devs really listen to the community and have sessions on tuesday and thursday and are very open.

If you are considering the game I would say a lot of the negative reviews were down to the game being not an exact copy of the physical game which although true needed to be to incorporate a AI and give a great PC experiance.

The other reason was the cost as apart from the first quest you had to pay for it and also earning valour reduced for a day, both of which were quickly changed by devs and now I believe are pretty good and allow peopple to earn useful amounts when playing.

So in summary the current state of the game is excellent and highly recommended and cannot wait for more content.",1536416215,1536416438,True,5,0,0.514999687671661377,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Reviews that early clearly have not devoted the time it takes to make a complete analysis of this game.  Reviews coming later likely have the benefit of patch fixes as well as more play time.  Please review those in greater detail than earlier reviews.  Overall, this is still in early access!  Many features will be changed or fixed over time.

If you are looking for an exact model of the physical card game, please just go play that.  I don't know why you would ask for a complete mimic when you can just play the physical game or even play it on Table Top Simulator?  This version is its own game.

I'm pleased to report that, so far, all is well.
Sure, there are a lot of changes to core game mechanics which may not please purists of the physical game. But it does somehow ""feel"" as it should.......a digital reimagining of the physical game.

Considering that this game is still in EA, the level of polish on display is amazing. The graphic and sound design goes a long way towards conveying a ""living"" story.
Gameplay wise, it feels unique and is certainly NOT a Hearthstone clone (despite what screenshots might convey).

Probably the best aspect of the game, from my point of view, is the fact that it's NOT PVP.
I've seen a few uninformed reviewers complain about this fact, as if they've been hoodwinked by the developers, even though the physical LCG is single player/ co-op only, and FFI have been upfront about maintaining that focus.

A quick note on monitization and content: The developers have been open and honest right from the start about how this game will be monitized during EA, and that it is NOT the same as when the game finally launches.
On top of that, they've already listened to community feedback, and un-gated a lot more content at no extra cost when it became clear that they had initially been a little too frugal.

Overall, now that i've played the game, I'm far more optimistic about how it's shaping up. Sure it's still early days, and the developers will, not doubt, make many tweeks and changes along the way.
I'm sure not all those changes will be popular. But I'm not worried, as FFI have already shown their capacity to listen to community feedback, which is very welcome and not always commonplace in a FTP game.",1536328507,1537446953,True,9,0,0.543508052825927734,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Let's address the elephant in the room, this is in no way a recreation of the physical LCG. It shares some superficial characteristics like card names but that's as far as it goes. The mechanics have been completely changed, most cards have no abilities and the ones that do are extremely basic, there is simply nowhere near the level of depth in this game that you would expect considering it has been branded with the same name.

To cover another common point of discussion, yes, it looks VERY similar to Hearthstone and that is obviously be design. Unfortunately (if you don't like Hearthstone or wanted a game closer to the LCG) it also plays very similar to Hearthstone right down to the overpowered decks the AI gets to play with to make up for sub-par programming.

Speaking of overpowered, the developers recently did a 180 on their extremely poor monetization model by giving everyone access to the first campaign. Previously, you got ONE mission for free before having to spend real money to buy more. That equated to about 30 minutes of unique gameplay. Why they thought that was a good diea is beyond me, but by giving away the whole campaign they exposed another terrible decision. By the fourth mission, the difficulty spikes to the point where you have a very small chance of beating it without spending money on new cards. If you've played a free to play mobile game you know how this goes.

I would strongly suggest that anyone who is interested in this game wait until it is released and is free. Yes you will have to spend money to get more than a couple hours of gameplay but at least by then you will be able to make an informed decision about whether you want to spend money or not. Buying it now means your money is spent and judging by the reviews and Steam Charts ever declining player numbers, a lot of people have buyer's remorse.",1536040418,1536040418,False,14,0,0.620987772941589355,0,True,False,True,False,,,

If you aren't capable of coping with the baggage that comes with that, then just wait for the game to fully release as free to play.  I have had quite a few technical problems, some completely killing a hard fought quest right before completion.  The monetization is also still being tweaked and you will undoubtedly see reviews complaining about this.  You should also note though, that the developers have been quick to try to address issues and have already unlocked more of the game for 'free' (after the initial payment that gets you EA access) than initial released, as well as making some tweaks to try to improve this.  

If you can handle all of this, then I highly recommend the game.  There's not a huge amount of content at the moment, but what is there is incredibly fun when not bombed by a crash.  

It should also be mentioned (as many already have) that this is NOT the same game as the physical LOTR LCG.  In fact it probably has more differences than similarities, but the feelings of that game mostly remain.  The game is still a bit puzzly with deck building being the answer to the puzzles.  You still make choices as to whether you should focus on 'questing' or fighting at any given moment.  You still start with some heros, recruit allies, equip items, play events, struggle to keep your threat down, etc.  As for the changes, a lot of it is a simplification, but with added mechanisms on top to then throw complexity back in.  There are no longer different resources per sphere, Losing a hero no longer reduces your resources per turn.  Combat has been replaced with something a bit more hearthstoney.... etc.

There are some things I like better about the physical game and some things I like better about this game, but both are fun and probably shouldn't be compared 1 to 1... they are different experiences on different 'platforms'.

If you're a fan of the physical game, keep an open mind and give this a shot.  If you've never played the physical game, I'd recommend it over this at the current time, but possibly not after this becomes more polished and co-op is implemented.  If you hate the physical game, I'd base my recommendation on your opinion of games like hearthstone (if you like it, you might like this, if you hate it, then you'll probably hate this)

I was fine with changes made to make games go quicker and such. However, I have two big gripes about changes made to this iteration of the game. 

1- The threat meter is now just a timer. In the card game, strong enemies ignore you when you threat is low so taking weak heroes with low threat level and rushing the objective is a valid strategy. Since this doesn't apply here, just take the strongest hero 100% of the time.

2- Deckbuilding is made way shallower because the ressources are now generic. In the card game, ressources are tied to your heroes sphere. Meaning, if you have 3 tactics heroes, you get 3 tactics ressources per turn. Meaning you have to choose wether you want access to a big library of cards or if you want to be able to play costly cards in a sphere. Since ressources are generic, it is now better to pick heroes from 3 different spheres 100% of the time.

Right now the production value are low, the server is down half of the time and the microtransactions are ludicrously expensive. These elements can be improved however.

What has me extremely pessimistic toward the future of this game is that deckbuilding and gameplay are shallow and uninteresting and even with the game being in Early Access I don't believe it's going to change.",1535986601,1535986857,False,103,3,0.815276563167572021,0,False,False,True,False,,1537978135.0,"Hello Jolly hoop.

Thank you for the review and we appreciate all of the feedback and comments you've made here. Just to address some of the concerns that you're raised here:

1) Taking the strongest hero isn't always 100% applicable as you need to take into account both their abilities as well as their stats to build a team who can most effectively accomplish the objectives you face in each campaign. We can understand how this might be the impression that you get though and will take this feedback to heart.

We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with the server. This is mostly because we are in Early Access and are making regular changes in order to improve the game. We are trying to ensure that there is a minimal impact on the player base as is possible.

Regarding the micro-transactions and costs, this is feedback we have taken to heart from the whole community and hope to be able to communicate something on this in the near future!

Regarding your last point, we are trying to continue to implement new cards, mechanics, heroes and campaigns that will enhance the experience further and make the deck building and gameplay even deeper. We hope that you'll continue to try out the game as we continue to make improvements."

I make an action and it takes 20-30+ seconds for the game to perform the action. Why?

1. Is the game too expensive to play right now for what it offers? It definitely is, but it's nowhere near Hearthstone levels, as some have suggested. To enjoy the game, you will probably have to spend some money, which in itself is fine (personally I'm tired of grindy f2p CCGs), it's just that right now you don't get as much value as you should for your money (to get all content the game has to offer right now, without grinding, will set you back around 70 USD). Note that expanding your collection is not based on random card packs like many other games, but rather on collecting Valor Points (a currency like gold in HS), which can in turn be spent on buying preset packs or singular cards. There are some tricks to get most value out of the current economy model (like buying all cheapest/low-rarity cards with Valor, so that you can get the most expensive cards from Palantir views), so keep that in mind. 

2. Does the game have enough content right now? Definitely not. There's currently one campaign available (takes around 2-2.5h to beat) and that's it. New campaigns are coming in the future, but I generally think the campaigns should be twice as long. The card pool is currently also quite small and even with full collection you are forced to take cards you don't really want to complete the deck.

With these two points out of the way, the game is really fun and I love it so far! The gameplay mechanics are satisfying and reward correct planning. The quests can be approached in several ways and the objectives can often also be resolved in different ways. I haven't played the physical version of this game (I only played other FFG LCGs - Android, Game of Thrones and Warhammer 40k: Conquest), so I can't say how it compares.
Some strategies are way more effective than others and some balancing will be needed for sure. Once you get a hold of the gameplay mechanics, the game is quite easy even on hard difficulty. It's also quite easy to exploit the AI, so this needs some work as well.

The game is pleasant to look at, it's not the prettiest card game around, but it's also by far not the ugliest. On the other hand, sound, voice-acting and music are really good. There are some connection issues that need to be resolved, but overall, the game is very polished for an early-access title.

Overall I recommend to try this game out. If you think the game is too expensive in its current state, wait some time and see how the economy gets adjusted. It looks like this will be addressed (and I hope it will, this is a niche game and I don't think they can afford to be greedy if they want it to survive in the long run). Most negative reviews here focus on the game a) not being the same as the original and b) being too expensive/not true LCG model, which are both valid points. I simply don't think the game should be discarded just because of that. There's a lot of potential here and with more content, balancing, stable connections and impoved AI this can prove to be the best PvE digital card game around.",1535899792,1535930937,True,29,1,0.69234234094619751,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- les règles simplifiées par rapport au support d'origine.
- le prix des articles en argent réel ou en argent in game, qui semble peut être un peu trop élevé. EDIT EN BAS DE PAGE

Pour le premier point, en effet certaines mécaniques sont simplifiées (par exemple les ressources par héros ont disparu), mais on retrouve tout de même les sensations du jeu de cartes. Une course contre la montre, des évenements aléatoires, des quêtes à remplir, la mécanique de jeu qui change en fonction de la quête... 

Pour le second, rien n'est figé semble t il. A surveiller donc, afin d'éviter de farmer comme des dingues les quêtes... 


Pour ce qui est du positif : 

- les sensations du jeu de plateau (avec des règles simplifiées certes). 
- pas d'installation de 20min avant de jouer. 
- intégralement traduit
- le mode coop qui va arriver!!



Je mets cette évaluation en positive, si je pouvais mettre une note, je dirai un 15/20 (EDIT : traduction est disponible, je monte ma note à 16/20).


Il mérite largement de s'y attarder. 


Allez, ça me redonne envie de ressortir le cycle 1!



EDIT : Beaucoup de choses ont changé. 
Le modèle économique déjà : le jeu devient un jeu payant. Terminé le F2P, le jeu sera payant. 
Ensuite les campagnes supplémentaires : le jeu propose gratuitement des nouvelles campagnes. Elles sont au nombre de deux actuellement. Enfin une campagne payante (composée de packs de cartes qui vont avec) est également proposée (10€). Alors oui, c'est couteux. 

MAIS! Ils ont modifié le système économique ingame. Le prix des cartes a été harmonisé. Ainsi les cartes ne sont plus ""communes, peu communes, inhabituelles, rares, légendaires"", mais uniquement ""pas légendaires ou légendaires"".
Enfin, le gain de points a également été revu : on gagnera des points en fonction de l'avancée dans la campagne même si celle ci n'a pas été accomplie jusqu'au bout, des défis de quêtes seront disponibles afin d'augmenter le nombre de points perçus, et finir une quête avec un héros pour la première fois apportera également des points (incitant les joueurs à faire la quête plusieurs fois mais avec des personnages différents). De quoi pouvoir récupérer des cartes bien plus facilement.

This doesn't necessarily make the digital version worse, but it certainly makes it different enough to the point where calling it LotR LCG stretches the reality of the situation a little too much for my taste.

I encountered few obvious bugs in the few hours I managed to play, although some effect interactions seemed a little hazy.

The lack of borderless fullscreen is a little annoying.

No opinion on the monetization model - far to early to judge the value of points you're given, or the overall price of the whole experience compared to the paper variant.

I purchased the Mithril Founder's pack so I could get the most out of the Early Access.

[Edit] Connection issues have been fixed.

The gameplay feels great. It's pretty much exactly what I expected and wanted from a digital adaptation. Its not the same as the physical game, but it kind of scratches the itch when I dont want to set up a table to play the physical game. But I definitely recommend this game to someone who hasn't ever played the physical version.

Most people are complaining about the microtransactions. This isn't a problem if you bought the full mithril edition. There is clearly a problem with the current free-to-play model. The easiest solution is to just scale back the grind for free to play users, but in my opinion the devs should simply have a set price for the core set + first campaignt + some valor and palantir views to get started. The game wont be free to play but for like $20-$30 it would still be worthwhile. 

Slay the Spire for example, is kind of a similar style game and seems to be quite successful without free-to-play. You buy the game upfront and unlock stuff as you play, both by leveling up the different characters and expanding their ""card pool"", and during each run you can also gain special items to synergize with your deck. 

If LOTR did this, the Valor system can stay in place for players to play and earn future cards and campaigns. No need to rebalance valor, just put a higher pricetag on the game with some good perks to start and no one will be disappointed by a free game that isnt really that free.",1535840453,1539210142,True,5,0,0.490575820207595825,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Emlékeztetőül a játék célja, hogy 3 választott hősünk köré épült paklival győzzük le Sauron gép által irányított erőit egyedül vagy egy társ oldalán. Ezután lássuk a főbb változásokat.
1.	Megváltozott a játék címe: A játék a  Fantasy Fligth Games tengerentúlon igencsak népszerű The Lord of the Rings kártyajátékát vette alapul, ugyanakkor  a fejlesztők célja  nem a fizikai kiadás 100%-os lemásolása volt, ezt jelzi hogy a játék címe is megváltozott az idők folyamán . (Adventure Game) Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a korai negatív kritikák egy része a már említett kártyajátékkal való összehasonlítgatásból származik/származott, noha a fejlesztők kezdettől fogva jelezték, hogy nem puszta adaptáció a céljuk,
2.	Modell váltás: A játék free to playból egy hibrid megoldásra váltott. Az alapjáték tartalmát (12 hős, alap kártyakészlet, játék során unlockolható lapok, training és 1. kampány) megvásárolható kampányokkal lehet bővíteni, amely újabb küldetéssorozatot és újabb hősöket tartalmaz( jelenleg 1 ilyen elérhető). A dlc-k mellett azonban ingyenes tartalmak is találhatóak, amelyek száma folyamatosan bővül majd. Új unlockolható kártyák, illetve speciális, pakliépítő képességet megpróbáló úgynevezett encounter küldetések. Mindezen túl az újabb dlc kampányok első küldetései minden alapjáték birtokló számára elérhető.
3.	Multiplayer: A játék az egyszemélyes játékon túl coopetative módban is játszható. Korábban hiányoztak azok a lehetőségek, amelyekkel „kommunikálni” lehet a másik játékossal, megnehezítve az együttműködést. Mostanra ez pótlásra került. Ugyancsak üdítő változás a mentési rendszer bevezetése mivel egy-egy meccs igencsak eltud húzódni, de különösen hasznos akkor is ha a szerver úgy dönt, hogy a küldetés megnyerése előtt 1 másodperccel ledob :D (Eddig ritkán fordult elő)  Pozitív dolog, hogy multiplayerben kipróbálhatod azokat a kampányokat  is amelyekkel nem rendelkezel, amennyiben olyannal játszol akinek az már megvan.

Összességében úgy gondolom, hogy a fejlesztők kihasználták a korai hozzáférésben rejlő lehetőségeket és hallgatva a játékos visszajelzésekre egy érdekes kártyajátékot dobtak össze, amely a divatos áramlatokkal szemben nem az ellenség legyőzésére, hanem az együttműködésre fókuszál. Mindezt megfejelni a  The Lord of the Rings világának hangulata, amelyben öröm elveszni.  Egyedül talán a free to play modell elvetésével nem értek teljesen egyet, mivel nagyobb tömegeket ismertethettek meg volna egy remek koncepcióval. A hibrid módban is megvan a lehetőség, ugyanakkor jelenleg talán kicsit túl van árazva a produktum. Az alapjáték megéri a maga 20 euróját a bővülő ingyenes tartalmak miatt, (kicsit azért ez is lehetne olcsóbb) ugyanakkor a dlc-k 10 eurós árát picit lehetne csökkenteni, hogy jobban motiválják a játékosokat a maradásra/esetleg visszatérésre
Számomra a játék egy üdítő színfolt a mai kártyajátékok tengerében a kihívást jelentő pakliépítés (rengeteg lehetőséggel) és az együttműködésre épülő multi miatt. Ennek tetejében unalmas óráimban egyedül is jót tudok szórakozni rajta. 8/10

When the game was in EA I already wrote a review, but since then the game underwent some bigger changes that warrant a new review. Just a reminder about the game’s goal: you have to defeat Sauron’s forces (controlled by AI) with your deck that is built around 3 chosen heroes. We can do it alone or with the help of a friend. Let’s see the noteworthy changes:

1.	The game’s title was changed: the game is based on the famous The Lord of the Rings cardgame by Fantasy Flight Games, but the developers goal wasn’t a 100% copy – the title’s change is supposed to reflect on that (Adventure Game). It’s important to notice that the majority of early negative criticism was based on the comparison of the two games, although the developers stated early on that their aim is not a 1:1 adaption.
2.	Change in the monetization model: the game went from f2p to a hybrid solution. The base game’s content (12 heroes, basic set of cards, unlockable cards, training and the first campaign) can be extended through buyable campaigns (currently 1 available), which unlock new quests and heroes. Beside DLC the game is updated with free content too: unlockable cards and special encounters which test your deckbuilding ability. Every new campaign-dlc’s first quests are available to everyone.
3.	Multiplayer: the game can be played in co-op too. Earlier you couldn’t communicate with your partner, which made the cooperation harder. Now you can. Another positive change was the implementation of a save-mechanism, because a match can be really long, and it’s useful when the server decides to drop you a second before the win:D (it happened only a few times). In multiplayer you can play dlc quests too, if your partner has bought them but you didn’t.
To summarize: I think the developers used the purpose of EA and polished the game according to the players feedback and made a good game not about defeating your enemy, but about cooperation. It's a joy to journey in the world and atmosphere of The Lord of the Rings. I just think that the game should have stayed f2p, so that more people can try it. The hybrid model has it’s potential, but the game is currently overpriced. The base game is worth 20 euros thanks to the free updates (although it could be somewhat cheaper), but the dlc’s 10 euro price tag should be lower, players would be more motivated to stay or to come back.
For me the game is a nice change in today’s card game scene because of it’s challenging deck building with vast options and the multiplayer that is based on cooperation. Beside all that I enjoy the game playing alone too. 8/10",1535833621,1571392099,True,17,0,0.731051325798034668,0,True,False,False,False,,,

More expansions have been announced and another free content pack is on the way, so I feel there's now enough space to experiment with different decks builds and heroes.

The game went through two overhauls related to game economy and all the way from F2P to an expansion based one. For some of the players the decisions were unwelcome but I found the way devs compensated for changes to be quite nice and appropriate.

Didn't have much time to play lately, so difficult to say more on gameplay and multiplayer, but what I felt was that focus has shifted significantly from grinding at initial launch to more thoughtful deck construction these days.

bought the early access shire  lowest option. $7ish
3 days in 3 quest in 3 decks in,


My Opinion comments :

1 I like it.. its similar enough to the TT 
2 there is no shuffling or record keeping or deck changing that slowed the TT down .. you swiftly go between scenarios and quests and even quick tweek your own deck..
 3 i never feel i played the TT correctly as its easy to skip over look powers and rules ...the computer keeps me covered here.
4 in the TT game i often played on easy mode.. hard card taken out and extra starting resources.. ive not check whats different in easy and normal on here.. but have only completed the digital versions on easy and normal so far.. 
5 it take a few goes to get used to the tutorial is not covering everything right now.. early access but you pick it up and find out with trail an error no big loss .. failing to guard out the gate is a big no once you have that system down your good to go..
6 only 3 quests in voice acting.. nice but skip past once heard once.. and often have my own soundtrack on.. didnt feel the ingame one was as stiring as Howard Shore score from the films ..or  Bruhnville on youtube... i guess if it was missing entirely its would be a negative.. 
7. they started with you only get the quest valor once a day.. they have since reviewed and removed this.. 
8. the start package only gave you 1 quest .. asking you to they pay to unlock more they have currently reviewed this and anyone you paid money to unlock quest will get a 4000 valour refund..sometime between now and next week maybe...
9 already netdecking  if you struggle like me you can se other people deck ideas on facebook and forums. playing them does not guarantee a win you need to know how to pilot the deck and game too 
10. co-op is to come.

It would be great on a tablet not sure on time scale here.. 

over all enjoyed it hope its successfully and see many more quests

The look is very similar to Hearthstone, but there is where the similarities end. This game is an action based game, each player alternate taking one action each, this makes the game more reactive and IMO interesting. Card and mana gain is also different, you get a set amount of cards and mana each round. 
The monetization has been criticised quite a lot, and the price is a bit steep, 2$ for each mission and per new hero with some cards. This adds up quite fast. That said, I don't have a huge problem with it, it is possible to earn in-game credit to buy all the stuff.

A vrai dire je ne comprends pas les commentaires négatifs à ce sujet. Ce jeu est du genre Jeu de carte Evolutif (JCE) que l'on retrouve en pagaille en jeu de plateau. Et pour débloquer le contenu, il faut acheter d'autres paquets de cartes sans aspect aléatoire. Chaque paquet contient uniquement des cartes connnues d'avance. Ce qui est clairement très appréciable par rapport aux TCG où l'on ouvre des packs sans savoir si ce qu'il contient nous sera utile.

Et bien c'est la même chose dans cette version digitale... mais en plus cette version offre la possibilité d'obtenir du contenu simplement en passant du temps à jouer grâce à la monnaie f2p du jeu.

Ceci étant dit, face à l'imcompréhension d'une partie des joueurs, les devs ont décidé de revoir leur modèle économique dans les prochaines semaines et en attendnant ce changement, ils ont débloqué pour tous les joueurs les 5 quêtes de la première campagne dispo et ils ont retiré le cooldown sur les récompenses en valor quand on réussit les quêtes.

Cela prouve que les devs sont à l'écoute de leur client et c'est une très bonne chose. 

Maintenant le jeu en lui même. On est en early access donc le produit est encore loin d'être fini (le jeu à besoin de peaufiner son ergonomie et mieux informer le joueur in game et améliorer son tuto) mais déjà fort agréable à jouer sans bugs majeurs.

Ce jeu est une adaptation de la version papier du jeu sans être une reproduction fidèle des règles de la version papier. Les joueurs de la première heure pourront le regretter mais c'est pourtant une bonne décision d'avoir choisi de s'éloigner du concept de base qui aurait clairement fait un flop car non adapté à l'espace digital et aurait fait fuit de nombreux joueurs devant sa relative lourdeur même si passionnant de s'y plonger. C'est donc un bon point pour moi : cela donne de l'espèrance de vie au succés de cette version.

Le jeu est uniquement PVE et du co-op sera dispo avant que le jeu ne sorte de l'early access (dans 3 mois environs).
Même si les règles sont simplifiées et le nombre de carte encore limité (2 autres campagnes et 12 nouveaux heros packs  sont prévus durant la phase early access et le rythme de sortie continuera après pour étoffer le contenu), la stratégie reste de mise et demande pas mal de réflexion pour se sortir des traquenard de Sauron... surtout pour faire le score max et gagner les meilleures récompenses. Addictif !

Addictif aussi parce que le lore du Seigneur des Anneaux est formidablement retranscriit avec des illustrations top niveau et un très bon travaill d'écriture avec des voix de narrateurs de très bon niveau (le jeu aura une traduction VF texte d'ici la mi septembre pour les anglophobes).

Le jeu promets vraiement un contenu monstrueux pour des heures et des heures de stratégie et de deckbuilding. Je ne vais pas lâcher le jeu de si tôt et continuerait aussi à jouer à la version papier.

The real LOTR LCG is an excellent game that can absolutely stand on its own, so why spend all this time and money on developing something so different to the original LOTR LCG while at the same time wanting to be samey to Hearthstone? The developer should have done the exact opposite: Create a close copy of the actual and already very popular card game while being confident enough to be innovative in the game's digital presentation -- or at least give this digital card game a different name, as it is absolutely misleading.

It turned out much longer than intended, but I hope it gives further insight into this digital adaption for players of the physical game.

I am a fan of the physical game since its release, and I play or have played almost all of Fantasy Flights‘s LCGs or other cards games.

First the obvious: this is not a 1:1 adaption of the physical card game, but that has was no secret, and people who missed that should clearly inform themeselves better before their purchases.

Yes, it‘s different from the paper game, but people who don‘t see all the similarities this digital version still has, likely just fail to look deeper into the game design beyond the pure interface.

By the way, to everyone who just wanted to play the paper card game in a digital format: people already do that for years, there are ways.

Back to this review:

The interface looks alot like a LotR version of Hearthstone. During the tutorial I didn‘t really fell into that „LotR feeling“, that the physical game has, but that feeling came later during gameplay with my own decks.

Let‘s talk about the game mechanics, and the differences between this game and the physical LCG.

Like the physical game every scenario consists of several stages, but the stages are not cards from a quest deck in this case, but more like actual „videogame“ stages, each with indivual objectives that have to be met in order to proceed.
Like the physical game player decks also consist of allies, attachements and events, and are either neutral or belong to the four spheres Lore, Tactics, Leadership or Spirit.
Like in the physical game you create a team of three heroes. Each hero also belongs to one of the spheres, and you can only add cards to your deck, when their sphere matches one of your heroes (or if the card is neutral).

The decks are smaller, 30 cards instead of 50, and you can add up to two copies of each card, instead of three. That‘s the same deck structure you find in other recent FFG card games: Arkham Horror LCG and Star Wars: Destiny.
The ressource system also changed. It‘s just one pool now, that can pay the play cost of every card, you don‘t have to make sure that a ressource comes from a pool of the card‘s sphere.

The round/turn structure is completely different from the physical game. In the physical game, you draw cards from an Encounter deck and have a strict order of different phases in a round. This design is needed, to make the „AI“ work. In this game, you play against an „actual“ AI, let‘s call it „Sauron“ from now on, that draws a hand of cards from their deck, and plays the cards from this hand, paying for them with ressources.

A round consists of an „Upkeep Phase“, in which the player and Sauron draw cards and get ressources, and an „Adventure Phase“, in which the player and Sauron take alternating actions, until both pass, much like Star Wars: Destiny.

The cards in Saurons hand are like the „Staging Area“ in the physical game, you just don‘t know what‘s in it, until you face it. In the physical game there are rules that say what the cards in the staging area do, these rules are now implemented in the Sauron-AI.

Since you don‘t commit the „willpower“ of your characters to the progression of the stage, you can use it to fill a „Fate“ bar, that unlocks special effects, or to solve tasks from cards that Sauron plays.

So far I‘ve only unlocked one of the additional scenarios, and still already played approx. 7 hours, that were a lot of fun! I think the actual „game“ here is not found in the scenarios. If you just want to play through all scenarios for the story once and move on, you‘ll clearly be dissapointed and won‘t get your money‘s worth. If you‘re bored by the thought of repeatedly playing the scenarios, this game might not be for you. The core experience for me is found in the deck building. The scenarios are more like test ranges for you deck, and like in arcade games you try to get the best possible scores. The scoring may have to be further refined, and the developing team should implement leader boards (maybe seasonal).

I think before you unlock all card add-on packs in the in-game shop, better just start with what the game provides for free! Build a few decks, play a few games, find a playstyle that you like. I already have a great Aggro deck, and a Control deck that I both really like. First unlock new scenarios, to boost your Valor Point (this is the ingame currency) economy. Then maybe unlock a new player card pack with cards and/or a hero that you like. Build a new deck with this hero. And so on, and so on… :)

I really don‘t have a problem with the monetarization so far, but it‘s different from physical LCGs.

In physical LCGs you buy packs, and get all cards in the maximum number of copies. This is not the case here, you buy a pack, and get a hero and four deck cards. Yes, four cards, only one copy of each. And there are other cards, that are not included in packs. To unlock these cards, and further copies of the ones from the packs, you have to pay Valor Points (VP). Or you use „Palantir Views“, these are like lottery tickets that you get from packs or through very good scores in the scenarios, and that provide random cards or VP.

But just as in the physical LCGs you always know what you buy. The only things in this game that you initially could spend real money on were four scenarios, and four packs of player cards with known content, and that‘s it. $1.99  for each unlock, $15.92 for all there is to buy and that‘s it. You can buy each pack only once!

I don‘t see how people can be upset about the way microtransactions work here, compared to games that ask for an unlimited amount of money for random booster packs or in-game currency (more on that below).

Yes, you don‘t get everything with these purchases, the rest needs to be unlocked with VP. And, this is important, VP can only be earned by playing the game, they can‘t be purchased with real money! At least not through the ingame shop. (During the Early Access period you can get VP through the founder‘s packs.) I hope they will keep it this way after the full release! A limited amount of items that real money can be spent on, and more content for VP, that cannot be purchased for real money in any way. Also, everything that can be unlocked for $$$, can also be unlocked with VP.

All in all, I‘m having a really good time with the game so far. It is interesting to see how the LCG distribution model can be transferred into a digital game. I think in the end it should turn out like the model White Wizard Games uses for their digital version of Star Realms, where they release expansions with fixed sets of cards for a cheap price every few months. 

I think it is also a good thing, that this game is different from the physical game. I hope that the developing team will further try out aspects with this digital game, that a paper game just can‘t do.",1535742324,1535750419,True,21,0,0.645212233066558838,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There's no cheap energy mechanic that prevents you from playing what you already own and you can win with what you're given. Maybe I'm used to the physical card game this is based on, where an additional quest, hero and set of cards ar $15 a pop.

I would encourage people to stick around and watch how EA develops before just assuming this is a cash grab. 

Also, it simply doesn't make sense to complain about having the option to buy packs with real money. This is a LCG. That's what you do. You buy cards with your money. No RNG. You are told what you will get for your money and you get exactly that. I think that's great. They have to monetize somehow, folks. When you buy an expansion for the tabletop, you are paying for the player cards AND the quests. The prices in this digital version are reasonable.

Rating 4.0/5.0 stars

Pros:
1. The game is a great take on LOTR LCG while being its own version. Somethings have changed and if you ask me its for the better. Like a shared pool of power to spend. 
2. The difficulty is on par with the physical LCG and is brutal and I love it. 
3. All the voice acting is good save from one part (see below first point) and each step in a quest is beautifully narrated.
4. The graphics are above what I expect with Early Access and are promised to be cleaned up and improved over time.
5 THE MAJOR POSITIVE- The devolopers have listened in the first week to the community and already stepped back some of the pricing on their game. THE FIRST 5 QUESTS ARE FREE. This negates half the bad reviews on here and is a saving grace to me recommending LOTR LCG.

Cons:
1. Smeagle voice acting is ok until this coughing, choking, ear splitting, nails on chalkboard, sound comes from him every so often. This is horrible and needs to be fixed. Makes me want to skip all dialog involving him.
2. While the devs have stepped back the pricing and made quests replayable for infinite valor I feel like getting no valor at all for a loss in such a hard game is unfair. I will probably beat each quest 1 or 2 times if I have to risk getting nothing for a 30 minute investment. A little bit of something for my time when losing would be appreciated.
3. Mouse over cards should show a zoomed in view for them or there should be an option to enable that.
4. The deck building mechanic is horrible! Please give us more options to sort by other than alphabetical and some stats such as average cost, average attatchment cost, ect. would be a welcomed addition.
5. Don't call this an LCG if your not going to follow LCG rules in a LCG you get the pack of heroes, cards, and a scenario for one fee. This set that expectation and is obviously not the case. Although I feel like there is no reason you guys should have deviated from that format it is superior to what you are offering now, I am ok with out setting that expectation into my mind  paying more than I would for the Base LCG in physical form. The 47 dollar collectors edition feels kind of bare and thats what I bought. I wish I had gotten more for my money. 
6. The threat system needs to be more clear what is adding threat and why- Also the end game scoring screen needs to be better explained through out the game so I know what to watch.
7. Finally sometimes when you have to target stuff on upkeep like someone to recieve a dmg or get an extra health it would be nice to be able to view a zoomed in version of the target to see all its stats and possible modifiers before apply buff./debuff.

I would recommend this to anyone that asked on the catch that they dont expect to be exactly like the LCG and that they dont minds paying a little more in the long run for what they might have paid for in the physical realm.",1535726865,1535726865,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,False,,,

An ok game instead of the great game the title suggests.,1535717509,1535717509,False,3,0,0.495734870433807373,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game isn’t a direct adaptation from the tabletop Living Card Game. As a proper player of it, I watched lot of time Luke during his streams to get information, ask questions and so on... This way, I knew what I was going to play (I’m watching you people who say trash without playing more than 1 hour, which is barely a single quest).
This said, I was disappointed seeing that each quest costs 2€ - 3750 Valor Points (which are quite hard to get). Also, a deck costs roughly the same so you have to make a choice there. BUT the developers are really close to the gaming community, put lot of efforts and heart into this game and are now giving the first campaign (5 quests) freely and will give back money spent on it. For further campaigns, each first will be free then you have to unlock with Valor or real money. Why do you complain? HEARTHSTONE IS THE SAME! 
I read people saying it lacks of PvP... Well if you knew the LotR, and the tabletop game, it’s not meant to be PvP. It’s not Horde versus Alliance, we all unite against a common enemy. Also I can’t wait to get in with a friend and face Sauron together, since I play it tabletop with my wife and we have to make synergic decks to win. There, are some real cooperation.
To me, it is a bit simplified from the tabletop and it had to, but it gives also a really awesome ambiance (Music, board, Narration, voices, you got to give credits to that), the strategy is still strongly present, it’s like playing an awesome Paper Role Playing game in here.

So for people who are easy complainers, wait until the full release and you’ll see if you want to play it or not (this way you won’t have to put money in it). As a fan of the tabletop one and seeing the involvement of the developing team, I recommend the game because it will be awesome at it final release.

They've made a lot of changes lately, redoing the tutorial and removing the F2P model for DLC driven expansion packs. The game is very enjoyable and challenging, co-op really makes you work for it and there's a lot of progression to be made in unlocking the cards. Still think this game is amazing!

Honestly, the game was exactly what I expected having followed it's development so perhaps the state of release that has generated so many negative reviews seems a little alien to me. I've given this a positive review as an EA game solely because of how the devs have come to the party and made changes that have real $ costs to them in the first few days to make the player experience better. To be honest, the first adventure should *always* have been free which; if they had done that, the time lock would not have been such an issue.

Apparently the Core set you get with the ""Founders Pack"" is missing 2/3-ofs for certain cards. :/

Really disappointing, Fantasy Flight, coming from a Netrunner player.

""This makes the Tutorial Campaign and all three of available campaigns now part of the Core Set release. When you include the three additional Encounters, that's a total of 19 playable Quests plus the Mirror of Galadriel playable to everyone!

I told you. I warned you back in August 2018, FFG/I. You needed to not try to monetize so hard and so fast. Alas, it took you forever and sadly the damage from Early Access was done.

The game is ""decent"" but with it being dead on arrival and time of execution being whenever they shut the servers down (unless they patch it to play offline sort of like how Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers did/does) I STILL can't recommend this product. You'd be paying $20 for a possible 1-2 day play before it shuts down.

No. Just no. Avoid it until we know what is going to happen with the product I and others paid for with this studio shutdown.",1535685055,1578452502,False,13,0,0.465164721012115479,0,True,False,True,False,,,

-The voice acting is well done (with the exception of Smeagol)
-The quests all feel unique and interesting.
-The boards are quite pretty and actually change as you move through the quest.
-The gameplay has a suprising amount of depth. Knowing when to play allies at the start of the turn vs. the end of the turn, when to Guard vs. when to attack, and when to quest vs. generate Fate points are all really important decisions that have a huge effect on your game.
-Some quests offer branching decisions, increasing replay value
-You gain bonuses when you complete a quest with a hero for the first time, encoureging you to replay quests with different hero lineups.

[b]The bad[/b]
-While the voice acting is good, the writing feels pretty generic.
-The deck builder is cumbersome
-You can't check to see which heroes have completed which quest, leaving you to guess.
-Only giving players 1 hero per sphere to start severly limits deck building early on.

The developers have decided to give everyone the first campaign for free and are removing the 12 hour limit on earning full rewards for quests. I think the game is pretty fair in what you can earn for free, but everyone's going to have their own opinions on this. Just remember that they are a company and need to make a profit after all.

I also think similarities between this game and Hearthstone have been severly blown out of proportion. I don't think this games is a copy of Hearthstone any more than Hearthstone is a copy of Magic: The Gathering. It borrows some concepts, but it merges them with concepts from the tabletop version of LotR: LCG to create something new.

I do think this game is doing itself and any potential customers by calling itself ""Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game"". It is a completely different game than the tabletop version and I think this false expectation is the casue of a lot of negative reviews.

总结一下这次的端游，基本是组合了当前比较火的几种卡牌游戏的模式，但同时也流失了实体卡本身的特色。实体卡玩家可以继续往下看。第一次接触的朋友，如果对魔戒题材很感兴趣可以直接进去教学模式，如果不是可以直接勾选”不感兴趣“。
游戏质量上来说，卡牌效果和实体版LCG相差很大，卡牌上限30张，对游戏的流程进行了一定的修改和简化，就是网路上一直传说的索伦模式。没有任务流程，改为战斗阶段直接对地形牌根据意志力造成“伤害“，意志多了一个用途，左侧的FATE LINE好像是叫，每一关达到一定数值可以解锁一些奖励，算是给高意志力低攻击的蓝绿英雄增加了新的用途。右侧是威胁等级，与实体版相同，但达到某一数值会触发负面效果，对比FATE LINE。
英雄和盟友版面不再是攻击、防御、意志，而是攻击、意志、血量，防御要exaust，也就是横置，每一个英雄本身也相当与一块地，但出产的资源不再区别，直接混用在各种牌系。装备栏限定了4类，很多实体中的+1效果变成了武器，突来勇气这类效果附属变成了特殊装备，暂时没有出现附属在地形上的牌。战斗过程依旧是每个单位能进行一次行动，除非有特殊效果，行动顺序为玩家和索伦轮流进行一次，可以启动场面的角色，也可以打事件。
事件类也有一定改变，资源池旁边有5个点，放5个陷阱你也可以cos佛祖骑，同理索伦。弹射甘道夫组合被强行拆开，弹射的随从是随机选择的，甘道夫目前只能5费硬上。
需要注意的是有些卡牌需要2个同色英雄才能加入牌组，类似与实体游戏中费用分别来自不同的英雄。

I had high hopes for it too.  As an avid LCG player, I love the model and was hoping that this game would mimic that model, but it has not.

This is how the LCG works and I truly believe WHY it works.  When you purchase a ""pack"" you not only get ALL the copies of the player cards to make a playset, you also get the next ""adventure"" in the pack.  I'm referring of course to the non-competitive LCGs like Arkham Horror LCG and LotR LCG.  Even in the competitive games like Netrunner LCG and Game of Thrones you are getting all the copies you need for a game.  No more card chasing.

This game however does not follow that.  In purchasing a pack you only get ONE copy of each card, not enough for a playset (the whole premise of an LCG).  Additionally there are cards OUTSIDE the packs that you have to buy as one offs.  This is not an LCG model but a pay to win.  If you don't purchase the cards to keep up with the game, you won't be able to compete or it will be more difficult.  A true LCG gives you all the cards you need to defeat the scenario given to you in a pack.

Secondly, the game is too random.  ""Sauron"" can spring pretty much anything on you and you have no way to prevent it in most cases.  I know you are turning up cards in the tabletop version, but normally they don't get to act as soon as they are out.  Too many times already have I been surprised by a card or event that comes out and kills off my hero as I sit there agape at the randomness of it all.  This also is not LCG format to me.  You will turn up cards and have a chance to do something about it.  Of course there are exceptions such as treacheries, but even they can be countered.  This game?  Nope.

Lastly one of the best parts of the card game was that you had hard decisions to make on whether to go questing or stay behind for combat.  This is gone as not questing doesn't have anywhere the penalty as the huge threat gain would cause and put you one step closer to losing the game outright.  You were forced to manage this.  Unfortunately threat is nowhere near the same in this game other than to serve as a ""take that"" mechanism that you cannot plan for.

I would say I hope the game model improves in the future but it would appear that that would require a complete paradigm shift on how they are approaching the game.

It's everything I ever hoped for, different from the tabletop game, hard to say which is better, but incredibly good nonetheless.

There are ofcourse quite a few bugs (that they are smashing day and night), strange free to play model (that they said they're going to change ASAP) and it's a bit light on content (which they already have massive plans for and are adding in quite frequently, as seen from the streams before the beta started).

You get a decent amount of content with the cheapest (Shire) Founder's pack (8 heroes, full first campaign with 5 missions and the starter card set). And by completing campaigns with every hero you get a massive amount of VP (in-game currency) that will let you get a lot of the future content like expansions and heroes. And I'm hyped about co-op that's about to come out soon.


The gameplay reminds me of Hearthstone more than anything. Granted, there are different mechanics, most notably play-by-play turns and having a willpower stat in addition to attack. 

The visuals and voice-acting are great, probably my favorite among all the card games I've played.

My only complaint is that the card balance seems to be a bit all over the place. Cards like Ithilien Lookout are great value while something like Man of Dale is completely useless.
Moreover, there is 0 incentive to make decks with 2 of the same Sphere. Cards like Sudden Riposte or Fair and Perilous are maybe even worse than Man of Dale. They should have been extra powerful because you are denying your deck the 3rd Sphere. Bow of the Galadhrim is a step in the right direction, but we still need better and more powerful dual Sphere cards like that.
Also build-around cards like Dain are a great idea since it allows for a bigger deck building space.

Edit (18.10.2020): All microtransactions are gone! You buy the game, and all the content is available, this is great news! And the co-op is pretty fun. Now the only problem is we need more content, more diverse cards to offer more choices in deckbuilding, more campaigns, and more players!

* The pricing model is absurd. Each scenario costs 2€, each hero costs 2€, and i don't even list the price you need to pay for individual cards. VP (the currency earned by grinding) come very, very slowly, and you need to play and play again the same scenario if you hope to get the second one without paying. 
* The amount of content is really small : I understand this is only early access, but with so few cards available (even taking into account all the paid content) the decks and strategies are not very varied. I played though the first campaign in less than 2 hours, and had no real incentive to play it again with a different deck or at higher difficulty level.

Also to be noted :
* This is supposed to be an LCG, but you actually get random cards through Palantir, and you need to buy/craft single cards. The only LCG elements in here are the hero packs
* The gameplay is actually very similar to heartstone (you have heroes/creatures, that can either kill the enemy units or advance your winning condition by questing/attacking the enemy hero) : not very original in the end

I may come back later when the pricing model has changed to be a bit less aggressive. Games like Eternal are free to play yet quite generous with cards and content, and let you have a varied gaming experience even without using your credit card.

I'd say thank you, but that should've been a given from the start. However, I do thank FFG for their extremely quick response. That does mean they are listening.

Buyer beware, not all is as it seems.

I spent $50 on the most expensive pass, and after buying all of the characters and most (note, not all) of the cards available to buy, I soon find out that the locks on the campaign are not locked because I need to beat the previous section, but I need to buy them. Each. Each level out of a campaign must be bought. I sunk 50 dollars right off the bat, and I am already not allowed to play the content without paying more. 

Not to mention, this is LotR: Destiny, not LotR LCG. I have almost all of the tabletop cards, and this feels very different. 

This is not a bad game by any means. There are minor UI issues I have, such as not seeing a card from hovering over it (you must click it), and rotten card sorting when deckbuilding.

And the fact that it is very different than the tabletop version isn't bad, but they should definitely play that up.

But in its current form, this is a money grabbing scheme that Battlefront II is jealous of. It is ridiculous that in good faith, because I love the tabletop LCG (and have sunk hundreds of dollars into that), that I find later that I cannot play all of the content. It's pathetic, and it stinks of desperation, especially on their maiden voyage into digital card games.

I've never been huge into the physical LOTR LCG (more of a Netrunner man myself) but I've gotten to play many a game thanks to friends.  It's notorious for being brutally difficult, often complicated, and -- unusual for games of this nature -- entirely cooperative.

The digital version isn't really any of these three things.  As far as difficulty is concerned I've not managed to lose a game, not even getting a hero killed, even playing on Hard mode.  So far I only have access to the first three quests so this may change in later quests, but as of this writing there are only five quests available total so I'm not holding my breath.  A lot of this can be chocked up to the Sauron AI which takes the place of the random deck of enemy cards from the physical game.  You'd figure the AI would be absolutely ruthless at the hard difficulty mode, but this is not the case.  Sauron will pass up on dogpiling a vulnerable hero down to their last few HP to spread the damage among other healthier and less important targets.  I've often been left wondering what the algorithm could be thinking when making its choices, and while it could be chalked up to bad AI I get more of the sense that Sauron is straight up going easy on us.  If there's one gripe I have with the gameplay itself it's this -- in the physical version I've lost as many games as I've won.  The only real risk of defeat is coming into a quest with a bad deck of cards, and even players with no prior experience with the LCG will probably find themselves confident on any repeat adventure once they learn the ins and outs.

And that's bad because the game expects you to repeat those quests!  I started this early access the same way I would any online card game -- I put some money upfront (the middle tier ""Steward of Gondor"" pack) in the hopes that I can earn everything else through play.  Things started out great -- I had enough in game currency to grab a couple more heroes and was getting generous rewards.  Every quest will reward you the first time you clear it at a particular level of efficiency, which includes more currency and ""Palantir Views"" (which are kind of like loot boxes, though ultimately fairer since it will never give you useless duplicates to cards you already have, while any individual card can be bought non-randomly in the card shop).  Beating a quest for the first time in a day can reward you up to 325 currency points, which isn't a whole lot but along with the other bonuses should have you earning new cards and quests at a good clip.

The problem starts when these resources dry up. Once you've beaten every quest with every hero, the stream of currency slows down to a trickle.  The same quests -- of which there are only 5, and 4 have to be unlocked with the very currency you're trying to earn -- will only reward up to 75 currency per play after their first daily run, and that's only if you're playing on hard mode.  Keeping in mind unlocking new quests and characters -- probably what you want to be spending your currency on until you've unlocked all that are available -- cost over 3000 currency apiece.  So once you hit this wall you have the options of endlessly grinding the same few quests over and over, patiently getting your max bonuses day by day till you can unlock something cool, or opening up the real life wallet.

(On a sidenote there are daily quests available to, which seem to come in sets of 3 and reward 90 to 125 currency apiece, but these are a mixed bag.  Mine for today include playing 20 Lore cards (easy), playing 20 Unique Allies (Time consuming, as it's not uncommon to play a game where you summon 0 unique allies if you even have some in your deck to begin with) and lastly to finish 3 hard quests.  The rub being that the last one seems like it would be no problem, but it's not working, showing me at 0/3 progress after I've completed 2 hard quests.)

Lastly, co-op -- a vital part of the original game -- isn't currently active, so if you're grinding out those quests you'll be doing it all alone.  The co-op mode button is there with a ""coming soon"" hover on it, and we've seen it in action during developer Let's Plays, so hopefully this feature is rolled out sooner rather than later.  Playing with a friend can go a long way to spicing up a quest you've been through a half dozen times by yourself.

So scrolling up I see a lot of criticism for a game I already put $14 into, so why still a positive recommendation?  Because there's a lot here to like!  Though I think the game system will shine brightest in co-op, I found the digital version of the game to be a lighter, snappier version of the physical version that even in its current state is a good time waster.  Production values are better than I was expecting with fully voiced characters and narrative interludes.  The deck building interface is fun and easy.  The launch card library isn't terribly complex but has some fun options and seems appropriate for an under the microscope early access release.  And while currency drops get too stingy too quickly, there are a lot of aspects of card shopping I quite like, like being able to outright purchase specific cards instead of hoping to randomly get them while random ""gets"" are guaranteed not to be unusable dupes.

Basically it's a solid foundation and more or less what I feel an Early Access title should be.  Assuming developers are listening these issues will see adjustment moving forward while the problem of being light on content should fix itself as the game is built on.

With my initial Ishtari valor points and some rewards, I have now unlocked 4 quests. I can easily gain 1.000 valor a day now.

I have played through the first mission of this game.

The quality of what they have done so far is great I mean great.  The music and voice acting are top noch really bring you into the world well done FFI.  

The game is different from the table top version but not really in feel.  You still have threat and it acts the same.  You still have shawdows that give nasty surprise in combat. You still have four or so phases to each quest.  You still need to balance out questing, defending and attacking just in a differnt way then the table top.  Its one turn at a time and I realy like it.  Lots of people are saying its not complex.  I dont feel that is true. Complexity in the table top comes from all the card interactions.  In the physical game you do get 5 or more card ineractions typicaly at once.  This game has the same amount of card interactions going about 5 or so once the game gets going.

The one thing that is less complex is the resourses in this game as you dont need resource matches.  The matching happens in deck building as you need a hero in sphere to use the cards in that shere also some cards need two heros of that type to play.  They have added resources to the computer deck which brings back any complexity lost with the resource matching from the table top game I feel.  

If you bought the bigger founder packs 15$ and up they give you enough in game currency to buy everythig they have made so far.  So give them 15$ and you can play all the EA content.  I payed the 8$ and really like it as I get to try this out and buy things with the in game money I want, not wast it on stuff I wont use.  I like to play lore so will focus on bulding lore decks and wont spend a lot of money say on leadership for example. 

The game is not free to play it is an Lcg. which means you pay to expand at your own pace you buy what you want or spend some time to get some free bees if you want.  Its a new way to pay for a Cpu game so its confusing. 

Once co-op comes out the game will really hit its stride with card inter actions and complexity to get the full experiance if you are on the fence I would wait till the co-op comes out and then get a friend spend 8 dollars and then play the game I really think when people get to experence this part of the game the rating for this game will shoot up.

If you are not familiar with either the physical or digital LCG, you may want to watch some streams and do some reading up on this before you jump in (or wait until this goes free to play in release).

This is a cooperative only game (like the physical) and it is very fun to play even at this early stage. The graphics, music, sounds, and narration are all top notch. The gameplay is a mix of hearthstone and the physical LCG. If you aren't familiar with both of those, the game play is very fast, with each side taking a quick action before the other side responds. It isn't all about combat, but you'll often have to fight in at least some stages of each quest. Your tactical options are numerous and you have to make difficult decisions often about which aspect of the game to concentrate on next (such as slowing down Sauron's threat, raising your own fate, taking out combat threats, clearing locations, advancing the quest, and building up your heroes with more allies and equipment).

There are certainly some bugs, but nothing game breaking that I have found. There are also some microtransactions, but like all LCG games, there is no randomness involved (there is some randomness with the palantir, but those are bonus rewards, and you cannot buy them directly with real money). You know exactly what you are getting in each hero pack and each quest that you decide to purchase. Beyond that, you can buy individual cards directly using in-game valor points.

Not to mention a really neat game-breaking glitch I came across. After playing an ally it gets stuck in animation and doesn't actually make it to the board. You are then unable to play any other card from your hand. For the rest of the game. However, you can still perform actions for allies/heroes on the board. So this glitch happens on the final act of the first quest (on hard difficulty) and I STILL beat it without having played another card the rest of the quest.

This game is exactly what I expected it to be. I have been following this game since they started streaming and I have watched every one.

This game follows the Living Card Game model. Yes it is riddled with microtransactions for hero packs and quests. No you dont have to spend any money beyond the basic founders pack, but you will never unlock all of the content with the games current economy and time locked rewards. If you purchase the Mithril founders pack you can pretty much get all of the content currently available.

The gameplay itself is fun and challenging. Im not planning on looking at decks online so im challenging myself to beat the quests. It actually takes some time people.

That's for sure. They promise a free to play game that they then make you pay in order to playtest (which in of itself isnt the worst but it seems the developers don't consider the customer when making a decision). The game as it is, has a lot of issues. I had a scenario where i had to keep a character alive and he killed himself... You have to buy campaign packs regardless of how much you spent on card packs (even the 100 dollar card pack, they still try to bleed you with having to pay 2 dollars here and there).

The game itself is just average. I feel like it doesnt make sense that they make us ""playtesters"" buy the campaigns when they want feedback. Clearly this game was not thought out or if it was, probably by someone who only wanted the money and didn't care if the game was good or not. The levels can be completed very quickly. It has 3 to 5 quests per scenarios. Sometimes it's incredibly hard and other times it is incredibly easy. It is very unbalanced. Also, many quests can be completed in one round making the scenario that you have to pay 2 dollars for be completed very quickly. Also, if you play the scenario twice, it becomes incredibly easy because you know what to expect.

In order to not pay for other quests, you have to spend valor points. Where, you'd have to grind about 25 quests that you'd also have to have a victory in. Sometimes more depending on how well you play. I don't think anyone would actually want to spend a total time of about 10 hours to earn something that is worth 2 dollars (if it's even worth that). They didn't think this out at all. I know they've got a stream where they played this so they must know these issues but didnt care because they just want those extra 2 dollars from everyone for something that is not nearly worth even the 2 bucks. In my opinion, the first campaign should be free, and perhaps have the next campaign be worth the valor you have to spend on a single scenario like how it is now.

Overall, this was a huge disappointment. Don't buy this please. You'd just encourage this kind of behavior from developers who just want money and not to make a good game. I love LOTR but this just sucks. I will try it again when it is free to play, but as it is now, I don't know if i would play this game if it was the final product. They should have just playtested it and come up with solutions. Heck, I'd do a better job at fixing this game than their team of developers which makes it really obvious that the devolopers are both amateurish and money-grabbing.

First things first: If you are looking for a digital version of the 'hard copy' LOTR LCG, then you should wait a few months to see if this game changes drastically from the early access. Other than the name of the game and the names of the cards.....this is nothing like the hard copy game. I don't care who you are...you can not say that this is the same as the hard copy. This has vastly different gameplay and is much easier in my opinion. 

All that being said you need to remember that this is an early access game and is still being reworked. The AI still needs a lot of work done to it, the money system should be reworked, and there are a whole lot of cards not yet added to the system. 

I think that this is either going to be a very long grinding game or P2P game. Right now you start out with some starter cards and one quest for free. Literally everything else costs either valor points or money. You can earn valor points by beating quests, however the quests have a time limit on them so you can not get max points 20 times in one day. It is one time max points every 24hrs. So unless you get multiple quests and have a deck or decks that can get you max points grinding is going to take forever.

I expect that in the future there will be some type of events or sales that if you save up items until then you will get better rewards. So check back when they do updates for this game to see what changes. 

I do recommend this game because of what I think it can be as well as I did not expect the early access game to be the same as buying the core set hard copy. Reviews I read said that they didn't recommend this game because it is nothing like the hard copy. It is and still can be a greatly fun game......with updates.

EDIT: They just announced that the complete first quest cycle will be open for free which is awesome for new players and that they are refunding players who already bought the quests.  From what I can tell Asmodee and FFI are dedicated to making this a great game and I for one am excited to see what they do.

Some things I think need to be addressed are:

I do not like the current microtransactions system at all and I think it spoils the game greatly; that is why I cannot write a purely positive review.[/b][/i]

Let us start with a short backstory: when I was a teenager, I used to play a game called Divine Armaments. It was all about collecting cards with cute goddesses and taking them to fast battles against my opponents. Unfortunately, four years later the game was closed due to some unknown reasons (most probably they did not earn as much as they wanted while the game really gave a chance to F2P audience). Anyway, since then I have been looking for a good card game with a smooth gameplay that did not require spending money on it to win. So far, I have been quite unlucky. Has [b]The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game[/b] become my oasis in the desert of pay-to-win titles for whales (people who spend a lot of money on games to gain benefits, if you did not know it already)? Well, it is a tricky question which I am most inclined to answer with *No*.

And just a small side note before we start: I have never played neither the tabletop version of this game nor the Hearthstone. And I am not much of a strategist, to be honest.

[h1]Noteworthy features[/h1]

-	The music and voice acting. Both parts are amazing and made the game more alive and interesting;

-	I honestly do not understand why some reviewers say that the game looks ugly. The artwork is very good. Not all the characters look like I have imagined them; but overall, the artists did a great job drawing each picture. The user interface is quite friendly and has lots of interesting parts. I also liked the general feeling of the Middle Earth in each and every detail;

-	And again I do not understand some claims that this is an easy game. Maybe I am not just used to this type of card battles, but I found all quests rather challenging. I managed to fail even the first one quite quickly (not the Tutorial, of course; the first campaign available). I think I will need to ask one of my students for some advice, while he is an avid Hearthstone fan and knows A LOT about proper deck building and stuff like this;

-	The story – you are not mindlessly battling with some unknown enemies. There is complete story that explains what has happened, why you are here, what you need to do, etc. It felt as if I was reading a book along with playing a card game;

-	Gandalf. Just Gandalf who always saves the day.

[h1]Some issues[/h1]

-	Microtransactions. I am 100% sure that all of us hate them. Personally, I am tired of seeing this feature in almost every free-to-play game. Why is it even called a F2P if you in the end you have to pay a lot of money to get all the content? Why not just set a fixed price for the game itself instead? From my own experience, I can say that microtransactions will make you spend more money to purchase what you want than buying a complete AAA-title with way more content. Or you have to grind, for a l-o-ong time.

Still, it is a good thing that The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game is a single player one, so you do not have to compete against other players who do not mind spending hundreds of whatever currency they use on the game. Another nice point is that you can actually buy campaigns, cards, heroes, etc. using in-game currency called Valor. Just keep in mind that you will need to grind to do it. If you do not mind this issue, then microtransactions will not bother you…probably. Oh, and as far as I understood, there are daily tasks that can also bring you useful rewards.

To sum up, there are too many microtransactions to my liking. The only redeeming feature is that you can purchase everything with in-game currency, but it requires a lot of grinding;

-	Sometimes the text was really small and I did not find the way to make it bigger. It was difficult for me to read these parts (which were basically the story ones and some explanations) and I would really appreciate it if the developers could add an option to enlarge the font;

-	It is an early access for now so there are some minor bugs. For example, when choosing to travel after completing a task, I all of a sudden got a message about some error. I did not quite understand what happened, but at least it did not ruin the match or freezed the game. I am sure that developers will address any know issue before the initial release, so I do not think it will cause any problems in the future.

[h1]The End[/h1]

What I would like to see in the final version of the game: first, an option to change the font size – this would help a lot! Second, I think it would be better if instead of microtransactions they added special quests/places where one could get all the cards or some special tasks to unlock new campaigns. This would make the whole collection thing more interesting and engaging than just grinding to get valor.  

All in all, [b]The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game[/b] is not a bad game but not a great one either. There are some issues that need to be addressed first. However, if you decide to overlook them and if you are a big fan of the Middle Earth and the story in general, then you can enjoy what the game offers now. Just be ready for grinding.

For now, I give this game a positive mark but with a neutral grade overall simply because of the amount of purchases you need to make before you get the full game.

Microtransactions are fine with me, as I can completely avoid them buying the Istari pack. So far, it's challenging, there is a world of possibility for new LOTR rings stories to uncover and I want to go back even when I write this review (spolier alert) to find Bilbo.

Nothing is unlcocked, I have to pay real world money, too many IAPs!   You can unlock everything without spending a penny using valor points (barring your founder's pack, of course).
It's not actually the Card Game!   It's been made quite clear that this is not a one to one port of the physical game.

Le jeu n'est pas mauvais mais ce n'est pas le Seigneur des Anneaux: JCE.  Ils auraient du changer le nom pour éviter la confusion.  Si le jeu est fonctionnel, il propose désormais une forme Heartstone-like.  On pose les cartes et on frappe.  Si cela n'a rien de déshonnorant comme style de gameplay, il met de côté la richesse que propose la version physique du jeu.  Chacun appréciera en fonction de ses intérêts mais si vous comptiez prolonger l'expérience physique par internet avec vos amis joueurs du JCE, vous serez potentiellement déçu.
Précision pour les joueurs du JCE qui n'ont pas le temps de regarder ma vidéo : 2 phases seulement.  La pioche et la réception de ressources (UPKEEP) et ensuite on tabasse les ennemis ET l'objectif (ADVENTURE).  La différence étant que l'objectif est passif et prend en compte notre volonté et non pas nos points d'attaque.  Trop léger pour ma part.

Une nouveauté sous la forme d'une jauge FATE donnant des bonus a été implémenté.

I really was after this game since it was announced, and i paid the Gondors Founder pack. After 3 hours of playing i have to admit that its a shame what they have done with the micro-transactions system. There are a lot of successfull free to play games out there that give you the opportunity to enjoy hours and hours and, also, pay for some extra content.

But the paying system of this game is mad, is absolutely insane and no one will accept that. I wanted to pay for the Gondors content and for some more things but is abusive how they force you to pay just to keep playing new content, because the available one is just 30 minutes of playing. Hope they seriously abandon that idea of paying for every step in a campaign, or raise up the amount of valour (the money you can earn playing) so you can pay those new missions with your hours of playing. 

Visuals are pretty beautiful, and, for an old TCG and LCG player mechanics are great, but no way i am going to keep playing with this paying system.",1535543534,1535543534,False,5,0,0.536544501781463623,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Yes, there are options to purchase cards, heroes and quests with real world money, but please note that ALL of these are purchasable with the in-game currency that is earned by playing the game, completing missions and completing daily challenges. As the game is in Early Access it would be wrong to judge it by this alone, as it is clear that one will be able to experience all that the game has to offer without spending a cent... and yes, there will be some grind in achieving this, but I can say that with the variety of heroes, quests and deck combinations on offer (which is voluminous even in this stage of early access) it will not feel monotonous.

For an early access game,  this is one of the most polished I have ever played. The quests are varied and interesting (and yes, challenging), the graphics and in-game effects are great, the soundtrack in itself is a work of art and the voice acting is also very good. Not to mention that the heroes and cards provide for very entertaining and varied gameplay opportunities which, as I have said earlier, will lessen the so-called 'grind'.

At writing this review I have played almost 12 hours and have enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, I am a Lord of the Rings fan, so you can take some of what I have said as being biased in favour of the theme. However, from a pure gameplay point of view it is well worth the 'buy-in' for early access and will also help the devs greatly in further polishing this game. Even at this early stage you will be transported to Middle Earth and will feel attached to your heroes and allies, especialy feeling loss when one is killed during battle. So from at least a thematic point of view, this game deserves 10/10.

I wish the devs all the best with the future of this game and hope that it will garnish enough support to enable it to become an epic, longstanding Lord of the Rings title. If you are a fan of the card game genre, fantasy or Lord of the Rings themed games, then you will enjoy this one.

... and if you feel that there is too much 'grinding'... what a better place to grind than in Middle Earth!

Additional comment: Within 72 hours of release the devs made major changes in light of criticism received of some aspects of the game, including removing a time lock for quest rewards, as well as unlocking extra content free of charge (no need to buy with in-game currency or cash).

Wouldn't that have been easier and quicker than trying to redesign an already awesome game? Why take all this time to make a slightly worse version? It's baffling. They could have even sold it in a similair way to the original, with a core set as an inital purchase, and then the cycle packs as paid addons - exactly as they already are in the physical game (except obviously make them cheaper). I would have happily sunk money into that, Why reinvent the wheel? If they had just done that that i would be 100% onboard. Instead I am about 60% onboard.

Mini rant aside, this is an ok version of the game. I don't feel it is as deep, thoughtful, or rewarding as the game it is based on, but it at least evokes some of the same feel. While it may not have been the game I wanted it to be when it was first announced,  I don't regret buying in at the lowest pack level, and I am sure that  it will become more engaging when there is a larger range of heroes and cards for deckbuilding (which, again, they could have done by now if they had just made the original game). I have still enjoyed it, even with the limited content it currently has.

I'm going to give it a tentative recommendation. It has potential, and I look forward to seeing it grow and improve over time. But your mileage may vary, and I strongly suggest you read other reviews and watch videos of it being played before you decide, as there are aspects of it that may bother you more than they do me.

EDIT: I want to amend this review a bit now that i've had more time with the game. The full first campaign is now available for free to EA buyers, and they are reworking their valor system - neither of which mattered to me, but may be a factor in your decision to get this. For me the issue is that the more I play this the more I realise just how much I prefer the physical version of the game. I'm still keeping my review as a recommendation, as I am sure many people will enjoy the mechanics of the digital one, and because they have never tried to hide the differences between this and the physical version - but, for me personally, this version just isn't as satisfying or rewarding of an experience. It's...fine...but it's jsut not the same.

     Originally I couldn't recommend this as I felt that the way the game was initially set up was oppressively grindy. FFI Responded quickly to feedback and are planning on unlocking the first full quest line for all players (only 5 quests but that's a good chunk of play and replayability to shoot for the full scores and unlocks). This change goes a very long way towards making the game playable for anyone early, grinding a single quest for valor to try and earn more quests felt like too much, being able to play through a full set of quests is far more reasonable. 

   FFI has also stated that more quest lines should be brought in quickly along with additional character packs and other content, all of which should lend to a lot of good options for people to enjoy the gameplay.  Though I'm still somewhat averse to the style of play vs the original LCG game style it is fairly enjoyable. I do disagree with the cries of ""hearthstone clone"" etc as the economy of the game plays very differently, I might prefer the paper LCG system but this is still enjoyable and brings about some interesting challenges.
   
 ORIGINAL:
     At this time cannot recommend. The current price structure for unlocks is just awful. With a 15 dollar founder pack you can get 4 total $2 unlocks with the valor you're given, and earning that in game will take an obscene amount of time. This will likely just not work as a free to play structure. 
     A direct port of the paper LCG core box would have been far stronger, a direct port of that rules set would have been stronger and a better game. This is a wierd hearthstone style idea which alters the mechanics much more than it should have, the game was already good, there wasn't a need to deviate so much. I don't understand.

[b]Digital CCG players that came here for the theme:[/b]
""No Pvp, this is crap, I'm out.""

[b]Fans of the tabletop game :[/b]
""This is different from the game I love, why is it different?""
""It looks just like Hearthstone!""
""My god the micro-transactions!""

So who is this game for ultimately? I don't think the developers know either. Maybe they'll figure it out before release.

[b]Personally, I like:[/b]
1. the presentation: art design, soundtrack, narration (leaving aside Gollum and the orcs which are terribly acted), card animations are all very polished. I'm not a fan of the Hearthstone egg-shapes, I wish there was some way to see the full cards on the table without clicking on each one but eh...what can you do.

2. the gameplay: it's actually quite good, if you understand it's not a recreation of the tabletop game. I don't know why people wanted a full adaptation. You can already play everything on your PC anyway...for free! (OCTGN...you're welcome). And who would have bought something like that anyway? Tabletop players who already spent $1000+ on the full collection would not pay $100s to buy the exact same thing in digital form and it's too complicated a game to attract the Hearthstone crowd. Anyway, the gameplay: a bit more random than it could have been (for example, why did they change Sneak Attack to pull a random ally from your deck? now instead of a cool combo you just hope it hits Gandalf instead of a crappy 1-cost ally). But decent overall, if lighter on decisions and planning. Most card games of this type are a bit simplistic before the card pool expands - so I am optimistic that it will get more interesting to deckbuild and play with time. 

3. fixed packs: the fact that I can finally play a digital card game without random boosters that give me the 10th copy of a card which I'll then turn to dust so 3 months later I can buy that card I actually wanted. I applaud this decision!

[b]What I don't like: [/b]
1. the microtransactions: $2 here, $2 there...gosh!. I don't want stuff for free....I just want to pay once and be done with it. Seriously, the way transactions work needs to be reconsidered. It's not 2010 anymore FFI!

2. the structure of heropacks: I appreciate that I can see what I get (see point 3 above) but keeping in line with the LCG philosophy, we should get 2 copies of the cards, not one. Don't make me pay $2 for 4 cards and then pay again for second copies. Yes, I said pay. Because as of now, Valor is so slow to earn that what you get for free is nothing compared to what you get for spending money on the game.

3. [strike]Loot bo[/strike] Erm, Palantirs. You can market and rationalise them all you want, but a loot box is a loot box. And again, you're a decade late to the party if you want to go that route.

[b] In conclusion,[/b]
The gameplay has a lot of potential - enough that I am giving it a positive review, despite my issues with it.
But this is what you get when you pair up a talented, passionate design team with the greediest corporation in tabletop gaming (Asmodee).",1535524968,1536475121,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game's mechanics are nowhere close to the physical living card game.... Oh, you'll see the same card titles and illustrations, and keywords' names, but that's about it...
This would, for me, warrant a red flag already, because when i put time, and money in something called ""The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game"" i want to play the lord of the ring living card game.... but hey, in any media transfer, changes are to be expected.... let's keep an open mind...

It is a standard opposition card game with symetrical gameplay but asymetrical cardpools. You and your ennemy each have a different deck (you create yours based on your card.... 3 heroes you will start the game + 30 other cards) and the computer has something in store based on the quest you're attempting but your turns will play the same : collect 3 ressources, draw 2 cards and play one action each until both players pass.

The pros :
 - As its RL counterpart, this game is beautiful ; the cards illustrations and backgrounds wallpapers are really cool-looking, in theme with Middle Earth, and not too much inspired by the movie so they still stand on their own.
 - The music is immersive, whimsical, and has enough different themes so you probably won't be turning it off too soon. I'm pretty much considering buying the soundtrack.
 - The narration at the begining and end of quests and between stages is immersive and well written. It mixes text specific to this game and excerpts of the books, giving a middle earthy feel to the game.
 - The AI, while still being a procedural checklist, has been given thought and doesn't always attack when it wouldn't be smart for it to do so, picks targets somewhat intelligently, and so on.
 - You can pick between 3 difficulties level when you play a game. It changes the number of ressource points your opponent is given on each turn. I would prefer for it to change cards available to the AI or even change its procedures rather than ""changing the rules"" but hey, can't fault them for giving new players an option to gain experience with the game at a more friendly pace.

The design cons :
 - The UI, while simple and clear enough to understand easily isn't on par with the overal beauty of the illustrations. It's all flashy, ugly color boxes and, to me, break the immersion quite a bit.
 - While it can be considered minor by others, this is really driving me nuts : to see a card details, you need to click it, not to mouse over it. So, to play a card, you have to drag and drop it, you can't click it in your hand then click it where you want to play it.... makes it easy to screw something up...
 - There are no tooltips to explain the keywords of a card, if you want to know what's what you have to hit ESC to open up the game menu and search through a glossary you'll find there. While i do think a glossary is a good idea, tooltips are much more newcomers-friendly.

The gameplay cons :
 - The game is overly simplistic.... it's a watered-down version of any other CCG you can find on your computer with the added twist of playing action per action instead of turn per turn (which, in itself, could be a good idea if the game was better).
 - It is designed to be a PvE game, not a PvP one. Having to play, albeit different quests, against the AI over and over again will end up being a bore because you'll end up catching on to its flaws and will kinda sorta end up being procedural in your plays yourself.
- The tutorial.... There is one, that's a plus, and it takes you by the hand to show you the basics.... but it falls into the trap of showing you everything you have to do until the last turn or two.... It gives you a handle (albeit not very strong) on the mecanics, but not on the decision process...

The elephant in the room :
If you want to play this game with any semblance of seriousness, be prepared to grind yourself to the grave. You are given 1 quest, 4 heroes and 26 cards x2 (and you need 30 cards in your deck, so there are at max 9 cards you won't be putting in your deck to begin with.... sheesh), and 3000 coins (valor points).
- buying 1 new quest is 3750 coins
- buying 1 new hero + 5 cards is 3750 coins
- buying 1 common card is 375
- buying 1 uncommon card is 750
- buying 1 rare card is 1500
the first time each day you complete a quest, you can expect to gain 200/250 coins, subsequent times, you gain less than 1/10th of that amount. MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE QUESTS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE....
While i understand that a compagny gotta make money off of microtransactions, this is ridiculous.

Overall :
It's free, so check it out, but don't fork money in the game... play once or twice, realize you like middle earth but the game doesn't do it justice, and that you're not prepared to give away your whole life to grind what you'd need for the cards...


I've tried to distance myself as much as possible from the real life LotR LCG to write my review but this is where FFI failed the most in my humble opinion :
The LCG has a large fanbase, and many peoples play it solo, so a computerized version of the game obviously would have a built-in community. Trying to cash in on it isn't, in itself, a bad idea. But, by changing the game mechanics so drastically (and for the worse), you're leaving yourself open to displeasing the fan of the games (which will be the one jumping on it day one and giving the early reviews.... so, might not be the smartest of moves). And calling your product the same as a ""board game"" we know and love proves you were trying to cash in on it... it's not LoTR digital card game, it's LoTR LCG... Luring us into your microtransacting arms...

I like playing CCGs against a computer rather than live players because i'd rather play RL against living beings, so i'm not minding the PvE aspect of it ; but i've played only a handful of games and i'm bored already.... There isn't much challenge in fighting an AI that will always be the same for a given quest and the grind factor doesn't even allow me the sweet taste of collectionning.

Would the game be drastically different from its RL version, i wouldn't have complained. Unfotunately, this game varies enough from its cousin to bother RL LCG fans and not enough to offer them a new experience.
The RL LCG is perfect for solo / cooperative play because there is no AI involved, the game doesn't make any decision, it's all player based. Every choice you make will impact the resolution of your quest : chosing a card over another, attacking with this ally or defending with this hero, and, of course, enemy cards you reveal. i've played the same quests in RL LCG dozens of times and minute changes in your deck or even in the draw can lead to totally different experiences this would have been perfect for a game that requires you to do the same thing over and over again...

I would even have welcomed some of the changes made for this game.... the guard / range mechanic is interesting and the ""pooling"" of the ressources does make it easier to understand and less frustrating...",1535521310,1535521591,False,572,14,0.869655013084411621,38,True,False,True,False,,,

As for micro-transactions, yes the game has them and yes they're very minor.  We're talking $2 per quest or character pack if you want to unlock them with cash or 3750 valor points (in-game currency).  After unlocking the first 5 quests, I can say that it would be very easy to farm upwards of 1250 - 2000 valor points a day if I wanted to grind the game to unlock everything as quickly as possible.

Economic model is absolutely unfriendly - you've got only one quest (~30 minutes of gameplay) and one player deck available for free, each other quest and deck costs $2 or 3750 Valor points. You get ~200 Valor points for completion of the quest and ~100 for Daily Task, which are not very good (125 points for completion of 3 quests on hard).

* Turn Structure: In Hearthstone you play all your cards, take all your actions and then end your turn. In LotR for every action you take, or card you play, Sauron gets to take an action.
* Resources: In Hearthstone you start with 1 mana and it ramps, no mana carries over. In LotR you get 3 resources a turn and you carry any unused over to the next turn.
* Willpower: In LotR there's a completely unique stat on Characters that allows you to complete quests, defeat hazards, or use Fate effects.
* Varying Objectives: many quests give you more than one way to successfully complete an objective 
* Traveling: During a quest when you complete an objective you travel to the next one, which causes the enemies board state to shift completely while you carry over what you had.
* Branching quests: Many quests give you options when traveling that go to completely different objectives and board states, adding options and replayability depending on your deck or state.
* Fate Events: Fate, mentioned previously, is like another resource that gives access to effects unique to each quest, this could be gaining a unique Ally, one shotting an enemy, changing the objective, etc.
* Threat: Threat is basically a race condition and there's lots of ways it can be manipulated by you or Sauron. It also causes Threat Events which benefit Sauron at certain thresholds.
* Heroes: There are many (or at least will be) Hero combinations you can base your deck off of which also effect which cards you can add to your deck. There's lots of variety in stats and powers of these Heroes.
* Spheres: As mentioned, Heroes each have a sphere, and you need a hero of a cards sphere to add it to your deck, this makes it important to not only choose what hero you like but what sphere they are so you can include certain cards as well.
* Co-op: Not implemented yet but the game will have offline and online co-op so you can play with friends.

As someone who loves the paper card game I was really looking forward to a digital version that would save me the trouble of set-up and tear down time.  Unfortunately, as time went by I realised that the vision for this version of the game strayed further and further from the original.  Regardless, I still wanted to give it a go and so I bought the top tear version of the game to support FFG and show there is desire for these games in digital format.

Now, after playing through the tutorial, the first 2 quests and unfortunately being kicked off the server during the 3rd quest I can say that, upto this point, this digital version shows none of the invention of the paper game.  Each turn of the paper game is a puzzle of weighing up risks and strategies, daring to quest or conserving actions for potential encounters in a later round.  Each quest in the paper game is unique in its own right with clever innovations that alters the gameplay and keeps the game feeling fresh.  The paper game is really beautifully realised.  Disappointingly, the digital version lacks the innovation that keeps the paper game so fresh and interesting.  Up to the point I have played it feels as though each phase of each quest is simply a fight to the death with little tactics or strategy.  Indeed I have had no trouble finishing quests with the starter deck and have given little throught to the actions I've taken during each game.  This really is a distilled version of the paper game - and actually, I'm not even sure it can be called a version of the paper game at all.

Furthermore, there are other problems with the game.  The presentation of the board and menus are fine, but the cards themselves are poorly considered.  The frames crowd out the beautiful art from the paper game and the characters jump into action with clear appropriation from Hearthstone.  

There is no tracking of stats in the game currently, no way to see which quests you've defeated and what scores you've acheived.

The upside of this all is that this is still an early access game and perhaps more invention will come in the future.  However, the foundations look like they've been laid down and there doesn't appear to be anywhere near the complexity, depth or difficulty of the original game.  

It's a shame.  I wish this was a faithful recreation of the original so that more people could experience its brilliance - but I can't currently recommend this digital version.

- It's not exactly like the cardgame: they just use the art and watered down some mechanics of it

Playing this for some hours gave me some enjoyment, but it's not even close to the LCG. That being said, it's not a ""Heartstone"" clone as some people claim, though it borrows some mechanics.

Ganz unten das Kurzfazit für alle die sich die Masse an Text nicht antun wollen.

Wer von dem originalen Kartenspiel kommt wird Artworks und den generellen Flair wiedererkennen. Dieser wurde sehr gut getroffen.
Das Gameplay wurde allerdings drastisch verändert. Zwar spielt man immernoch ""PvE"" gegen das Spiel selbst, also nicht PvP wie es hier lustigerweise auch in den Reviews immer wieder eingefordert wird, sowie in der generell selben Struktur wie in der Vorlage von FFG (Thread Meter, Orte erkunden, Monster schnetzeln, mehrstufige Quest erfüllen). Hier hört die Ähnlichkeit dann aber auch schon auf.

Die wohl größte und meiner Ansicht nach gewagteste Änderung ist die Einführung eines KI Gegners (Sauron) der abwechselnd mit dem Spieler spielt. Auf jede Aktion des Spielers führt Sauron eine Gegenaktion aus. Dabei entsteht ein sehr großer Zufallsfaktor (meine größte Kritik an dem Spiel).
Natürlich gab es auch schon in dem originalen Kartenspiel einen zusätlichen Zufallsfaktor durch das hinzufügen der Schattenkarten an Monster. Trotzdem hatte man dort deutlich mehr optionen darauf zu reagieren und das Spiel selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Vielleicht fehlt hier aber auch einfach nur die Menge an Karten um entsprechende Optionen zu bieten.

Zwischenfazit: Das Gameplay an sich unterscheidet sich vom Gefühl her stark von der physischen Vorlage. Manches wurde gut umgesetzt manches fühlt sich komisch an. Für viele Veteranen wird es sehr schwer sein die gewohnten Vorgänge so über den Haufen geworfen zu sehen. Letztendlich kann es aber nur jeder für sich selbst entscheiden ob ihm das hier gebotene Gameplay liegt oder nicht.

Dann der Cashshop - Großes Streitthema wie man momentan anhand der vielen Diskussionen und der Reviews sehen kann. Preislich orientiert sich das Spiel hier an seiner Vorlage. Eine neue Quest kostet 3750 Punkte was in 2€ übersetzt wird.
Desweiteren kann man sich alle nicht im Core Set enthaltenen Karten ebenfalls mit der Ingame Währung kaufen. Je nach ""Rarität"" der Karte für 375, 750, 1500 oder 3000 Punkte. Dabei muss theoretisch jede Karte zweimal gekauft werden um die maximale Anzahl für das Deck zu erhalten.
Was enthält nun eine normale Erweiterung der physichen Version von FFG (Hierbei spreche ich von den kleineren Erweiterungen der Zyklen)

IdR 60 Karten.
Darin enthalten: 
1 Quest
entsprechende Karten für die Quest
1 Held
9 Karten (x4 um das Decklimit zu erreichen)
Diese werden bei Amazon zwischen 12 und 16€ angeboten.

Setzen wir das hier um ergibt das:
1Quest 3750P
1Held ???
9Karten 3 für 375, 3 für 750, 2 für 1500, 1 für 3000 (x2 um das Decklimit zu erreichen macht 22500P also ca. 12€)

Man bekommt aber keine physischen Karten dafür sondern nur einen digitalen Zugang. Dafür erscheint der Preis doch wieder recht hoch. Großes Aber: Man kann sich die Punkte auch durch reines Spielen erfarmen. Der Grind dafür ist hoch, Quests müssen zigfach gespielt werden. Ehrlich gesagt hat das für mich aber stets den größten Reiz beim original gemacht. Verschiedene Decks und Strategien gegen bekannte Gegner zu schicken. Die Belohnungen könnten trotzdem gefühlt etwas größer ausfallen. Lösungsansätze dafür wurden bereits mehrfach gepostet.
Wer sich mit dem Grind nicht anfreunden kann und trotzdem alles umsonst haben möchte für den ist das Spiel definitiv nichts.
Verglichen mit dem Vorbild von FFG finde ich die Preise aber durchaus fair gesetzt.

Technik:
Für einen EA läuft das Spiel bei mir wider Erwarten erstunlich rund. Einiges wirkt noch unfertig oder improvisatorisch, der Content fällt recht schmal aus, aber das Spiel fängt ja auch gerade erst an. Das Original hatte damals schließlich auch nur ganze 3! Quests.
Ich hoffe dass das Team dranbleibt und jetzt in regelmäßigen Abständen Verbesserungen und Content anbietet.

Fazit: Es wird hier ein rundes Spiel abgeliefert, dass jedoch eher für sich alleine stehen sollte. Inspiration wurde natürlich offensichtlich am bekannten Vorbild von FFG geholt, jedoch so sehr verändert, dass es gerade für Veteranen doch sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig ist. Die Mechaniken funktionieren an sich aber gut, die Tiefe an Möglichkeiten ist aber gerade wegen der wenigen bisher vorhandenen Karten recht begrenzt.
Die Einführung eines KI gesteuerten Sauron als Gegenspieler halte ich für die gewagteste Neuerung.
Die Mikrotransaktionen sind für viele Spieler ein großes Problem. SIe orientieren sich stark an den Preisen des Originals, allerdings erhält man hier keinen physischen Content, was die schon im Original recht hohen Preise verschlimmert. Allerdings kann man dagegenhalten dass sich der Komplette Content (mit viel Grind) komplett kostenlos erspielen lässt.

Insgesamt kann ich das Spiel unter Vorbehalt sowohl für Veteranen als auch Neueinsteiger die ein spannendes Story lastiges Coop, PvE Kartenspiel suchen empfehlen. (Achtung! Zwei Spieler Coop wird erst im Laufe des EA eingeführt werden).
Wer allerdings Zweifel hegt, ob ihm die Neuerungen und Veränderungen liegen oder den Spaß rauben dem ist zu empfehlen auf den Free to Play Release zu warten und sich dann ein Bild des Spiels zu machen.

Das Spiel hat aber einen einigermaßen sauberen Start hingelegt und muss jetzt nur noch einen guten weiteren Weg einschlagen.

Update: 
- Die erspielbaren Punkte wurden stark erhöht. Das Wiederholen von Quests bringt jetzt stets die volle Belohnung anstatt nach dem ersten Mal für 12 Stunden reduziert zu werden. 

- Die komplette erste Kampagne wurde für alle Spieler kostenlos freigeschaltet.

I purchased the $48 bundle becauseI am a huge fan of the original LCG and I have had my eye on this since the day it was announced. If you are willing to pay the money, then there is a decent amount of content you can get off the bat between the ""core game"" and the missions you can get with the coins from the bundle. I now have all of the extra available heroes and missions and I have a decent chunk of points left for future updates. However, it is apparent to me that these coins won't get me much more than one more set of 5 missions and possibly a new hero or two. I can definitely see this game becomming a bit of a money pit if there isn't a reasonable enough grind rate for earning the coins in game.

That being said, the game itself I found to be rather enjoyable, and over two hours I've only dabbled with a few playthroughs of the first of 5 missions in order to get my feet wet with a few different decks. The game is NOT the same as the physical LCG so be aware of that. It does keep quite a few of the interesting concepts from the original game though, and it is definitely more complex than a ""co-op heathstone"" like it might appear to be in the trailers. I'd rate my initial experience as a solid 7/10 and I look forward to seeing how easy it will be to acquire future content without needing to dip in much further than the initial $48 finanically. For now, this gets a thumbs up from me, but that could change depending on the weeks leading up until the full realease.

Edit: Seeing as the developers refunded all the Valor spent on unloocking the first campaign and having completed the campaign and revieved some in game rewards, I can now affirm that the monitization of this game is not going nearly as poorly as I and a lot of others have feared. I now have unlocked every character pack and story mission, as well as over half of the Valor cards with Palantir Views, and I still have over 40,000 Valor points available to purchase new character packs and missions as they come out. It seems like there will be plenty of content to unlock with the $48 bundle I purchased, and I feel as if I am gaining Valor points quickly enough to stay ahead of having to sink more money in for quite some time.

Overall, the game is a fun, new take on the digital CCG genre and I look forward to seeing where the developers go with subsequent characters and missions. I am happy to maintain my positive recommendation after this first week of play.",1535490138,1536161078,True,5,0,0.51694953441619873,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Outside of the card gameplay (a bit like Hearthstone) It's focused on lore and storytelling.

BUT why being so aggressive with the microtransactions? Within a campaign you have quests, and each quest is about 30 min and costs $2 or about 3750 VP (valor points, the game's currency). Now if you win a quest of course you get a fair amount of VP, but wait, there is a cooldown on earning VP because if you farm this same quest (even if you get a better score) you will get about 20ish VP per win until the cooldown is over (from what I read on the forums 12h). Do the maths... it's an insane grind or take out your wallets.

So you make a PvE game, all right, I don't mind buying packs or farming for packs to beat higher difficulties, but this is stopping the campaign progression. Right now I'm stuck playing the two first quests over and over again getting close to nothing in game currency earnings. 

Who thought this was a good idea? If this is a game based on lore and storytelling, who in their right mind would like to do the same quest dozens of time reading the same story over and over again?

I hope this will change because the game has potential.

Das Spiel soll nach dem Early Access komplett Free to Play werden. Mit der erspielbaren Währung kann man sowohl neue Karten, wie auch neue Quests freischalten.

[h1]Positiv[/h1]
- Sehr gute, vertonte Geschichte zu den Quests
- Viele bekannte Helden/Orte aus Herr der Ringe
- Einzigartige Kartenspiel Mechaniken

[h1]Negativ[/h1]
- Ausmaß des ""Grindings"" (statt Zahlens) noch nicht ganz erkennbar
- Relativ wenig Inhalt für den Anfang (5 Quests zum Start)
- Extra Konto-Anmeldung auf einer Webseite


Das Spiel startet mit einem Tutorial in dem uns einige Mechaniken des Spiels erklärt werden. 
Danach muss man sich erst einmal auf einer Webseite anmelden, sonst geht es nicht mehr weiter im Spiel... 
Daraufhin erhält man sein erstes Starterdeck mit einigen Startkarten und die erste Questreihe.
Es gibt Heldenkarten (z.B. Aragorn) und Allierte (Kreaturen, Gondor-Soldaten, etc.), Ausrüstungsgegenstände für die Helden (z.B. Bilbos Schwert Stich), sowie Vorbereitungskarten, die wie Fallenkarten wirken können. Der Gegner ist normalerweise Sauron, der je nach Quest einem andere düstere Wesen (z.B. Spinnen, Orks, etc.) entgegen stellt. 
Besonders hervorhebenswert ist die qualitativ hochwertige Erzählweise der Quests. Normalerweise wird eine richtige Geschichte in englisch erzählt, wie anfangs zum Beispiel eine Reise von Bilbo mit einigen Zwergen (bekannt aus dem Hobbit), welche in einer Kampfsituation enden, in der wir dann spielen und ein bestimmtes Questziel erreichen müssen. Questziele sind wie Kreaturen auf der Gegnerseite und müssen ebenfalls besiegt werden, während uns Sauron immer mehr Gegner entgegen schleudert. Ab und zu taucht auch ein Nebenziel auf, dass den Kampf solange beeinflusst bis wir es vom Spielfeld gefegt haben.

Nachdem Hex: Shards of Fate in Sachen PvE die Fans enttäuscht hat, habe ich bei diesem Spiel die Hoffnung, dass es ein gutes Kartenspiel mit guter Geschichte wird ohne kompetitiven Druck zu beinhalten. Für alle die einfach gern ein Kartenspiel aus Spaß spielen ist das Spiel, meiner Meinung nach, auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert.

> Card visuals are taken off the physcial card game (They are beautiful!)
> Solid tutorial
> The game shifted away from the original unique and challenging ""phase-based"" mechanics of the physical cardgame to a stuttering 1action-per-turn mechanic which feels different but worse

Negative (-)
- The game got abandoned really fast after release (!!!)
- The AI does not work well and with a proper decision making
- Horrible cardframe design which trys to imitiate something like hearthstone instead of sticking to it's own beautiful physical predecessor
- Bad communication by the developers. There is still no offical announcements that the gamestudio got closed

Overall: It is a shame that the game got changed to much in regards to its awesome physical predecessor in terms of gameplay, frame design and ruleset. The AI is not able to deliver a sufficient gameplay experience. But the game got abandoned quick anyway so I can only recommend picking the game up during a steam-sale/discount.",1535480542,1589059619,False,1,0,0.507672667503356934,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ARCHIVING OLD REVIEW UNDER THE LINE. NEW REVIEW FOLLOWS:

LotR LCG is not a direct translation from the paper tcg. This is unfortunate. The game isn't complex nor amazing, but it's presented well, has decent replay value and is pretty fun. The AI isn't very smart and I'm worried it'll get worse once we have more cards. There's not a lot of content right now. I've scored 275/275 on every mission on hard for every character and unlocked everything all in under 10 hours of play. They are working on and fixing the micro-transaction model so that helps a ton. All in all, worth checking out for the first campaign once it goes free to play and definitely will be more interesting when we get more deckbuilding options.

---------------------
Played through the first mission. The gameplay is fine. There's not much new being done here. It's polished, looks pretty, and well voice acted. You finish the tutorial and the first campaign with the starter deck and then you see...

Holy god the microtransactions. Every single mission (5 in a campaign) costs $2. Every single ""hero pack"" costs $2 (5 cards in a hero pack). If you want additional cards.. well, those cost more money per card. You can buy the $48 founder's pack and $18 of it disappears to just to get the 4 currently available hero packs and 5 mission unlocks. Not to mention when the other campaigns unlock or they add more hero packs, or if you want specific cards for your deck. And this is a single-player only game. There's no competition except against the AI. I'm not sure I've ever seen microtransactions like this in a single player game outside of some predatory mobile clients.

They have a ""random reward"" option via a palantir but it feels pretty lootboxy.

Man, I love FFG, and I was excited to stumble across this today. But this is a huge black strike in my book. I love the LotR LCG, but this is not the LCG (or anything close). It's massively stripped down of mechanics and feels like a license/nostalgia cash grab.

I had bought the $50 pack. I thought this was going to be awesome. It's not. Filed for a refund.

(EDIT: I want to add an additional thought. I love the LotR LCG. I still play it all the time. I see people here on the forums saying this digital version is ""basically the same"". It's not. The paper LCG is deep and challenging, deck building is interesting and complex. The gameplay requires careful planning and tons of decisions to make. The missions brutal and epic. This is a shallow puddle of a back-and-forth ""attack or play a card"" yawngame that isn't remotely like the paper LCG and literally does nothing new or interesting.)

(EDIT 2: Ok. I love FFG so I didn't do a refund. Instead I played through all of the content. I unlocked 2x all of the cards and I perfected every mission on hard. I exhausted the limited deck-builder options as there aren't many cards. And I did this all in... 6.7 hours. 

The AI is pants-on-head stupid. The scoring system (which feeds into the currency) is designed so that you actually don't want often to complete the objectives ""correctly"" (also, you get the same scores whether or not you play on easy or hard). Some cards are super unbalanced (seriously, put Legolas in every deck. Also, Erkenbrand with weapons just slaughters the AI) and some cards are completely useless (like the 50 threat card). 

Fun fact.. if you in-game currency unlock 2x all the commons/uncommons then the Palantir has to give you rares and legendaries. 

I just wanted a digital version of my favorite solo/coop card game and I got this instead. I love you FFG, I support you FFG. The actual implementation of this game (outside of the AI, which is always hard to code) is well done, it's just the game that isn't very interesting or hard.)",1535477333,1535835345,True,2,0,0.511153161525726318,0,True,False,True,False,,,
