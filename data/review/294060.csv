The gameplay is fairly solid. There's a teleportation mechanic that sets it apart from other platformers. You shoot a ball of light that bounces off surfaces. Often you have to shoot it through a hole too small to normally get through. It's also used to kill enemies and avoid deadly terrain.

But it's also pretty short and compensates for that by being quite challenging.

You have only two moves - a jump followed by a dash move, and launching a sphere that you can then teleport to. Enemies can only be killed by teleporting inside them, and it gets you past places that are too small to move through.

As the game goes on it ramps up the difficulty, giving you objects that you have to teleport through whilst jumping over spikes and other seemingly impossible feats of reflex. It isn't ridiculously hard thanks to fairly spaced checkpoints, but it does come close to being a bit teethgrinding.

If was just a smidge the other way I'd be giving this the thumbs down, but inventive stages  and decent boss battles make it interesting and worthwhile.

On the plus side - it looks rather tasty, with a cool artstyle and slick animation. The music is quite decent too.

On the down side - the narrator has an odd way of delivering her lines, which is a tad stilted and slightly too fast. Like they had about ten minutes in the recording studio and she just went ""boom! boom! boom! job's done!"" spitting out dialogue like a machine gun. It's nice that it has vocals, and I've heard worse, but it's obvious she's not a native english speaker. Cutscenes are relatively short anyhow.

And finally - all the levels are shortish chunks of intense action. Nicely designed for sure, but it means the game doesn't really flow in the way you might expect. It's tuned for speed runs and leaderboards on each section, rather than continous ""metroidvania"" type gameplay.

Overall I'd say it's worth a look - it took me about 5 hours, though admittedly that's because the bosses are devious blighters!  (I'd say close to an hour of that was the last boss alone) It's not super hardcore (hence the thumbs up) but it might strain the patience of many gamers nonetheless.",1521348329,1521348329,True,2,0,0.513513505458831787,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Obwohl das Leveldesign wirklich nett ist, die Story eher wirr aber schön vorgetragen und die Optik wie gesagt richtig gut ist, wirklich empfehlen kann ich das Spiel nur an Menschen mit gewisser masochistischer Veranlagung, es ist nämlich brutal schwer und sehr frustrierend.

	A finely honed platformer with WASD+Mouse -movement system. Gameplay is fair and consistant, which enables the speedrun-elements of the game.. A built-in timer, with Global/Friends -leaderboards.

Gameplay:

	The game consists of Levels, within Chapters.. And a story in the passenger seat. Which is fine by me, as the story is potentially intriguing, but its depth is mere mediocre. Still, the progression comes organically, with the steady rise in gameplay difficulty, and players' skill requirement. 
 The first chapter is more about getting a handle on things, and the few skills acquired by Aaru. The latter chapters are where those skill are needed to have been sufficiently adapted by the player, and in turn, applied with skill.
   
Atmosphere: 
   -Visual; Eventhough the game is set more in the 'fantasy realm'.. i find the game does have a tint of this 'sci-fi`esque' -cartoon style, which first reminds me of the year 81-cult classic 'Heavy Metal'
  -Sound; Much like the story, the music takes a back seat.. Still, it does its thing of setting the atmosphere well. No problems with 'SFX' either.

FOR WHOM IS THIS GAME FOR, is actually more important question, than 'How good is it?' (If that seems like a dumb as *Tral'la-fakin'-laa* statement, then let me clarify; The game is good.. really good, I mean..»Caveat coming»)

TLDR: Beautiful animations and art direction marred by an inconsistent and finaggly control scheme and some stiff success margins for some jumps.

Looks, feels, sounds and sounds great. Story is cool in a mythico-primitive kind of way. Voice acting is acceptable if somewhat lacking. 

Review: Xbox 360 pad was correctly recognized. However it seems like this game was optimized for KB+M. I found it way easier to control the character with it, the joypad had a hard time controlling the aim reticle it moved way too fast, and the use of trigger buttons for the power ups didnt make sense. On the keyboard you use WASD keys and space on one hand, and right and left mouse button on the other. It all adds up to gaming bliss to me.

I had a hard time navigating the menus and choosing which levels to do next using the gamepad At first I thought the game was forcing me to speedrun under a certain time to unlock the next stage, but no, i was simply selecting the same stages over and over again by accident. The sun will shoot rays on the levels you already completed, kind of an artsy way of going about doing it but once you get it its fine. 

Otherwise the game itself felt nearly unplayable with the remote and for a platformer that is a huge problem. It was difficult to aim, and double tap for powerup jump. Not to mention that it is on cooldown and often must be performed on top of death pits. Altogether this is a retry oriented meatboy style experience to my eyes due to the fact that there is no elegant way of using controls to go with it.

It almost really feels like someone designed the animation and someone else the game at times.There are many better solidly implemented platformer alternatives out there.",1493152584,1550612370,False,0,0,0.455624133348464966,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The art style is great and the controls are actually tight and easy to use. As you can see from my playtime though, I didn't last long with this game. 

Recommended for those that love very CHALLENGING games. I do not say it lightly either. This game is really difficult. 
Personally I will probably never play it again. This is a sad thing for me because the powers and concepts are extremely cleverly and really well made. For these reasons I have to give a positive review. I can't fault the game because my platforming skills are not up to the challenge. 

Seriously though, do not buy this if you do not enjoy a greater than Nintendo level of difficulty. 

If you can handle it though, the checkpoints are spaced reasonably and the powers will get you through the obstacles if you hit that sweet spot but if you don't...prepare to be stuck a lot. 

That part is what killed it for me. I am too old and too unskilled to be platforming through a game this hard.

For hardcore veterens like myself, this game is a pain. It's not a good pain like what you experience in Super Meat Boy, Spelunky or even Rayman Legends (towards the end).

The game does a good job of explaining the controls and powers as they are introduced and the storytelling is nice but still the game manages to feel empty and fails to capture what other loved platforming games have.

que hincar el diente sin embargo cuando me lo baje que
no ocupa mucho espacio en el HDD me di cuenta de que
la idea distaba eones de lo que realmente consiste este
título.

En esencia parece un juego de plataformas sin más pero
basta con echarle un vistazo a la estructura de interfaz
de los mundos y veremos a que estamos enfrentado.

El género es bién conocido en Steam como un hibrido
entre plataformas y puzzles,pero al contario que muchos
de este tipo,se basa en la habilidad que tengamos como
jugador ya que las mecánicas son bastante simples,por
eso lo encuentro dificil,además de que muchos de los
logros estan sujetos al tiempo en el que completemos
los niveles.

Se observa también un elemento llamado ensayo y error,
es decir,habrá pantallas que tendremos que repetir varias
veces,en concreto ciertos puntos para tener éxito.

A nivel gráfico me sorprendio ya que la estética de los
diferentes escenarios parecen estar elaborados y
trazados totalmente a mano,eso hay que tenerlo
muy en cuenta ya que le aporta cierta rareza y
originalidad.

Quiero restacarlo de la biblioteca y todavía algo más
y es que pretendo que conste en la ofertas semanales
a un precio razonable y con esto quiero decir que este
por debajo de los 5 euros ya que cuenta con varios
años a la espalda y ya es hora de que los amantes
de esta tipología que lo disfruten.

En conclusión lo veo muy interante tal vez no ha sido
valorado suficiente y quiero transmitir que merece la
pena,estoy algo oxidado para otorgarle una puntación
sobre 10,pero si mi memoria no me falla esta muy por
encima del umbral del 70 segun Metacritic y es más
recibió algun premio en cuanto al panorama indie.

Comentar que a nivel técnico esta genial optimizado,
tampoco digamos que sea triple A asi que a nivel de
requisitos es muy liviano y como he añadido al inicio
no es muy pesado tal vez menos de 2 gigas...eso es

Though to apply abstract philosophical concepts to a game as if it is itself an autonomous entity is in many ways ridiculous, I feel that existentialism and its definition of authenticity provides an ideal jumping off point at which to understand Aaru’s Awakening and why it fails on so many levels at what it attempts to be.

In many ways Aaru’s Awakening does itself seem to toy with many of the tenants of existentialism, at least within the confines of its narrative which places the naïve Aaru within the midst of an ongoing celestial war between the deities Dawn, Day, Dusk, and Night. In often exaggeratedly blunt terms, Aaru’s Awakening seems to wish to question the notion that any of us are created for a predestined purpose, or if we are not instead nothing more or less than what we make ourselves out to be. It is difficult to really draw much away from the themes posed by Aaru’s Awakening though due to just how on-the-nose and traditional they ultimately are, tending to head in the right direction but not really wishing to delve into the questions it poses. Instead Aaru’s Awakening seems to employ quandaries on the meaning of life, the dangers of blind devotion (which could potentially be construed to be a condemnation of organized religion), and the true extents of personal freedom purely for the sake of attempting to inflate its sense of scale. Aaru’s Awakening would like you to believe its narrative is larger than life, but its attempts at creating this depth are so transparent and underdeveloped that they actively make the game seem smaller by failing to encompass the scope the game keeps reminding you of.

But really it is in Aaru’s Awakening’s systems and how they seem so entirely turned against one another that leads to the feeling that the game itself is experiencing an entirely unintended existential crisis. Most telling is in the way Aaru’s Awakening abuses difficulty in its attempts to create an identity founded upon its own challenging nature, as if merely by establishing itself as excruciatingly demanding it might slip unquestioned into the cannon of games as beloved as Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Joy. But while there is nothing inherently wrong with challenge, there is nothing in Aaru’s Awakening’s design that manages to establish its difficulty as purposeful and considered rather than entirely arbitrary.

There is a lot in how Aaru’s Awakening plays which serves to facilitate challenge, but little that compliments it. The controls are too loose and by design are poorly served to the sort of split-second improvisation required by such arduous level designs. Your primary means of navigating these levels is an ability which allows you to throw out a ball of light and then instantly navigate to it, requiring you to have already planned out your moves before you need to make them so as to account for the time needed for the ball to travel forward. This, in practice, is a special sort of agony. Because of the speed at which you travel through levels, how relentlessly it seeks to kill you, and the inherent randomness of a thrown ball, I often found myself dying dozens and dozens of times solely because of a minor miscalculation in when or where I threw the ball, which tended to feel neither fair nor avoidable.

I am not bothered so much that Aaru’s Awakening is hard, but that it feels so completely pointless and unsatisfying to actually overcome its challenge. The difficulty is steep, but checkpoints are so prevalent that levels tend to feel designed and segmented purely for the sake of causing you to beat your head against a particular obstacle until you finally have one perfect run and then begin the process over again. There was no moment playing Aaru’s Awakening that success felt like anything more but brute force and blind luck. It’s a game which seems to wish to be one thing – a face paced, hyper difficult, speedrun focused platformer – but is at once entirely ill equipped to actually fit that role. In many ways it seems as if Aaru’s Awakening’s challenging surface elements were added after the fact, as if in the absence of frustration the game lacked a reason to be played.

And perhaps this might have been true, but with how beautiful Aaru’s Awakening is, being so very colorful and fluid and wondrously bizarre in its art direction (be sure to see it in motion, as screenshots do a very bad job as showcase), I feel that the game could have been far more cohesive and meaningful if it had attempted to find a direction to take its gameplay that played to the strengths of its presentation rather than serving to push you through it as quickly as possible. Had Aaru’s Awakening veered toward a more intentional and methodical experience, perhaps utilizing its teleport ability for puzzle solving or to allow you to traverse through levels at a more relaxed pace so as to appreciate how incredible they are to behold, it very likely might have arrived at a place more true to itself and by extension a more distinct and enjoyable game.

Aaru’s Awakening feels like the regrettable result of a game attempting to ape its peers in the absence of its own identity. It is such a phenomenal artistic undertaking that it is intensely frustrating that it seems to aspire to be little more than a mushy pile of antagonistic mechanics and philosophical shower thoughts. Its identity is in constant limbo and never manages to arrive at a place which feels entirely its own rather than a poor approximation of ideas lifted from more successful games, like a man wearing another’s suit to pass himself off as more than he actually is, no matter how poor the fit and misguided the attempt.

This is another 2D artsy platformer.   The graphics are woeful - they look like they were scribbled with an art majors biro in his spare time after he was kicked out of university for not being very good at art.     It's the kind of thing the guys who aren't good enough to do the stage art for Metallica cover bands get to do.  2 Bic pens out of 100 for raiding the stationary cupboard.

Technically - well the game runs smoothly in 4K because it's backed by the Unity engine, a logo I'm beginning to dread seeing every time I launch a new game because more often than not, it's a doomsayer for impending indy mediocrity.   Indyocrity? Technical proficiency is not enough.  Microsoft Word runs really well, on my PC too, for example.  Actually MS Word IS a better game than this.

Gameplay - It's a 2D platformer in 2016.  It has some pointless and uninteresting extra mechanics (your character is based on what I imagine the developers are, a primitive ape-person badly drawn in ballpoint pen). Apparently if you've released one of the 1,000,000 2D indy platformers from 2015 it's mandatory to differentiate your gameplay from every other 2D platformer.  Here's a hint if you want differentiated gameplay:  Don't release another 2D platformer!  We're full, go away!

Just don't bother with this, it won't enrich your life, if you've ever played a 2D platformer before, you've already played better and more groundbreaking games than this.  If you think the artwork will change your mind, go to an art gallery or go look at the graffiti at the train station (which is probably also better).",1457112642,1457112642,False,3,3,0.335736781358718872,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
+Art Style- It's a good looking game. The backgrounds, I think, are hand draw. Actually, I think everything in the game is hand drawn. It makes for a really appealing aesthetic. 
+The Music- It's not amazing, but its light, upbeat and provides good ambiance. I honestly stopped noticing it after awhile. 
+Good Challenge Level- The maps themselves are really short, but trying to complete them without dying 90 times makes them feel a lot longer. It's a hard game, but its not that hard. 
+Replayability- Not only does it have a hardcore mode, but in order to get certain achievements you have to get Gold on some maps and that just adds hours to the game.
+Simple, Intuitive Controls- Launch the game, and play. Really straight forward.

The Bad:
-Meh plot- Not the best written, but it doesn't take away from the gameplay, the art, the music or anything else. 
-Short- If you play through to beat the game, its really, really short.

Overall:
I really liked this game. I first played it when it was launched in the PS4 and was just SO pissed off at the crazy amount of dying I was doing. When it came out on PC, I snagged it right away. I really like the art and how challenging the maps are. It looks great, plays great and for how much it costs I feel that I got more than my money's worth. I'll definitely give this game another go to try to do a full achievement run :)

The game was fun enough and it was challenging, but mostly it was challenging because of bugs. 

You can jump and land on a flat surface and it will still thing you are falling and you have almost no control of where you go and quite often wind up dead.

After teleporting the character can do some weird stuff sometimes which makes it hard to control the character and this is a game that you need to be able to depend on your controls working when they should.

Occasionally the way you kill a monster might not work even if you don't miss. (and yes on killable monsters)

There are a handful more slightly more minor bugs as well.

Now, the game is still playable, they give you pleanty of save points to keep trying... Buuuuut, this game also has a ""hardcore mode"" and acheivments that go with it.... This requires you to go through the whole game without dying once... Now I'm sure I could get 3 of the 5 acheivments for that mode if I spent another 10 hours or so on the game, and I do want 100% another game but it's just not worth getting that frustrated at the game just for another 4 acheivments that are next to imposible due to bugs, so meh...

There is a short story that goes along with the game, when the controls do work its entertaining enough as a game, the artwork is nice, (but there are no badges with this game)

Its no surprise then that Aaru's Awakening caught my attention.  The cel-shaded environments combined with the beautifully painted backgrounds make this a truly gorgeous game.  However, it takes more then really good art to make a really good game.  Thats not to say this is a bad game but it certainly carries with it some baggage that weighs down the overall experience.  This test of reflexes and patience may not be for everyone.

The story of Aaru's Awaking is a tale of four gods.  The gods decided long ago to split the day into four equal parts Dawn, Day, Dust, and Night.  You play as Aaru.  A buff looking creature that lies to serve Dawn.  You're warned by you're master of an evil presence invading Night and must traveling through all four kingdoms to face this threat.  As Aaru travels through the realms the other gods sow seeds of doubt into his mind and he begins to question if he is on the right path.  This makes for a pretty interesting story which is narrated though story book cut-scenes between each realm.

After seeing someone play it on Youtube, Aaru's Awaking quickly caught my attention.  I proceeded to download a demo and was instantly impressed.  Not only was the game fun to look at but the mechanics were very clever.  Aaru was fairly maneuverable but the key mechanic of the game is teleportation.  This is accomplished by pressing the left mouse button to project out a ball of light then press the right mouse button to appear at the balls current location.  This makes for some unique platforming especially when combined with Aaru's dash ability.

For a simple concept the developers certainly push it to its absolute limits.  The later levels become extremely technical requiring immense speed and precision.  Although the first couple stages help get the player into a rhythm it still seems like the difficulty ramps up a bit too quickly.  I don't mind a challenge but I definitely didn't realize what I was getting into.  Towards the end of the Night chapter, especially the boss stage, it became so hard I just wanted to pull my hair out.  This was the point where I stopped having fun and I decided to stop playing soon after.  (About 90% through the game)

I'm glad I tried this game.  It had a really unique mechanic at its core and some pretty clever level design.  My favorite part is still the wonderful art and original soundtrack.  That being said, I was so focused on trying to stay alive I didn't get to enjoy the music that much.  (Not to mention in the end I got so sick of hearing Aaru die I took off my headset.)  Whether or not you'll like this game really comes to down to how much you like a challenge.

Aaru's Awakening is a fun 2D medium-difficulty platformer, that comes with some issues.
You can dash and teleport. To teleport you first fire a ball at your mouse pointer and then with a right-click you teleport to the ball. Your only attack is to teleport into enemies which instantly kills them.
There's 16 normal levels where you run from point A to point B where you mostly avoid being killed. Plus 4 bosses. All levels are timed and they translate to a gold/silver/bronze medal.

    [*]Great art.
    [*]Interesting story that never interfered with the playing.
    [*]Really fun teleportation mechanics.

[u]The so-so[/u]:
    [*]The level design could be more creative.
    [*]The voice acting is ok.
[/list]

[u]The bad[/u]:
[list]
    [*]The screen is too small to see everything you need to.
    [*]When you die you respawn near your last save-point. Each savepoint is just a little star which you have to pass through. The issue is, sometimes you respawn after the save-point and effectively skip part of the challenge. This feels really unsatisfying.
    [*]Running feels slow and heavy. In the air that's fine, on the floor it should be quicker to move and turn.
    [*]The art made it hard to distinguish platforms, hazards and background a few times.

本游戏是一个颇有难度的横版平台动作过关游戏。游戏中你操控一只萌萌的小怪兽到处乱跑，躲避各种即死的陷阱，干掉一些过分碍事的敌人，最后顺手做掉几个boss————包括你的老大（没有隐藏，因为这个剧情简直用滥了…………）

你操控的这只小怪兽可以跑，跳，空中冲刺，以及最重要的动作——传送。跑，跳和空中冲刺都是用键盘完成的，而传送则是用鼠标，非常考验你双手的协作能力。关卡难度渐进的很合理，后面的关卡不仅需要脑子，还需要一定的apm，最后一关难度相当高，几乎会让人直接吐血。

游戏关卡内会根据你完成的情况给予金牌、银牌或铜牌的评价。当然，关卡内是有存档点的，但死了同样要纳入计时，这意味着如果你像我一样是个成就控，那么就要尽量追求不死通关。不过金牌通关时间设置的比较怪异，有些关卡相对比较极限，而有些关卡又宽松得过头了。

如果单纯金牌通关还不能满足你的话，在通关后还会出现一个新模式，Hardcore。这个模式，简而言之，就是要把所有的关卡，一命通关，想要自虐的同学请不要错过，包你爽_(:з」∠)

游戏本身玩的人并不多，合起来二十多关，作为一个轻度手残，我只是在每关都没什么失误，就轻轻松松能在关卡排行榜里排到前20，甚至有些关卡进了前3，想要留名的童鞋可以抓紧时间了。

Teleportation mechanics open so many possibilities and the game does a great job implementing sections of a level to seem like mini puzzles as one tries to clear each level as quickly as possible. There's a sense of liberty which i enjoyed about this game as a lot of these sections within a level can be tackled differently and can required some out-of-the-box thinking. The game is by no means slow and will sometimes require precise timing and aim tho with each checkpoint u can breath easy. While some sections can be tricky requiring some serious skill fortunately there are infinite oppurtunities to retry but that does not make Aauru's awakening by no means a walk in the park, unless that park contained booby traps killer monsters and ninjas (cus ninjas make everything better, sadly this game had no ninjas lol, and it still rocked). If a challenge is what you want seek then a challenge is what you'll get. The teleportation is what set aside this platformer aside from many others to me and its just so much fun to mess with. I should mention the game is basically story driven but can be replayable i just wish there where some form of collectibles hidden items of sorts or stuff as i enjoyed getting 100% and stuff it would increase the replayability of the game to me, tho ik there are those people who hate those types of things so it could just be optional items to maybe like idk have notes like a lore to previous events of the war or monster encyclopedia pages.

That's how long it took me to go from the beginning of the game to the end on my first playthrough. And I must say I really enjoyed my time on this one. With one caveat:

The final boss is like hitting a brick wall. Of my 3.7 hours, over an hour of that was JUST on the final boss. I knew precisely what needed to be done, but it required such pinpoint accuracy, and makes you needlessly repeat very finicky parts whenever you die. I would have had a better experience had the boss been better at maintaining my momentum, and if I'd been able to defeat it quicker. That is not a bad thing. As it is, I left the game feeling really quite agitated, rather than delighted at the other 95% of the game, which was GORGEOUS.

The controls appear at first to be very intricate, but they play out very well with an XBos controller - it's very natural.

Music and sounds are wonderful, atmospheric and totally add to the game experience.

Graphics - as mentioned - are stunning. I particularly adored the hand-drawn smoke effects in the latter stages of the game.

Story - really works well, it's simple, and effective. It doesn't ry to crowbar in tons of exposition, though the narrator's voice is grating at times, as she slurs and mispronounces words, which felt a touch sloppy. Her intonation was perfect other than that, however.

I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of platformers, or puzzle games generally. Even though it has its quirks, I still have an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction having played this game.

I've been waiting for Aaru's released since I saw it on GameJolt last year. It. Definitely. Delivered.

Don't go into this game thinking it will be a breeze. It's actually quite difficult, but teaches you its mechanics very effectively through level design. Levels are designed with multiple routes to get through them—whether one is faster than the other or safer than the other is what it comes down to in the end. Often times the more dangerous path is the faster path, leaving your nuts on edge. 

The graphics are astoundingly beautiful. There is so much detail and so much soul put into the Aaru's visuals.

Aaru's Awakening blew me away. I fucking loved it!

Here are my two complaints—one of which isn't even that big of a deal:

► The narrator's voice is [i]really[/i] bad. She is reads like she reads: fast, slurring, without enunciating words properly, with no engaging tones. Ignore the voice and just read the subtitles and boom, illusion returned!

Aaru's Awakening is a hardcore platformer, with a unique, hand-drawn graphic style.

I first saw this game featured in GameJolt, and assumed that it was a result of a game jam.
When I saw it come to Steam, I was pretty excited to try it out.

Unfortunately, this is a game that seems to be constantly in an internal conflict regarding exactly what it's trying to achieve.

I've completed the game in about 3 hours, and then played a bit more to get some better times, and look around a bit more. If you go for the leaderboards, you'll certainly take fairly longer. There's also an hardcore mode that seems infuriating.


[h1]Presentation[/h1]
The game is beautiful. I just played Child of Light, from a much larger company, and this game still looks pretty damn good!
Everything is highly detailed, the creatures look alien (in a good way) and the Bosses have a really nice design to them.
The menus and loading screens are also highly stylized, and give the game a very unique vibe right of the bat.

Even the animation is very nice! The main character follows the mouse-point/analog stick, with different walking animations depending on where you're pointing. 
It's a pretty rare thing, especially with indie games. It's very well done!

However, despite being a beautiful game, it completely misses its target in regards to its genre : [b]hardcore platformer[/b].

I'll go over some crucial aspects of the genre (regarding its visuals): 
Conveying information [b]quickly[/b], making it very clear what will kill you and what will not;
Good differentiation between foreground and background elements;
Keeping distractions to a minimum;
Clear hitboxes;

The second and third are, of course, to aid the first, the most important.
Of all of these, this game only manages the last. Its hitboxes are well limited.
All of the rest, unfortunately, has been largely ignored, it seems.

[i]The game uses mostly one color palette, per world[/i]
Of course, it's an aesthetic choice. And the game looks good. BUT, when everything has very similar colors, you simply cannot convey information quickly. Many, many deaths have happened because I couldn't see the obstacles.
In a game that requires fast reflexes, obstacles are usually identified by peripheral vision. This game has none of that, resulting in a very [i]trial and error[/i] experience.

There's also the fact that some foreground elements seem obstacles, and you can never be sure until you run into them.

[i]There's no time to appreciate its visuals[/i]
It's a fast paced game, with leaderboards. Your objective is to cross the levels as fast as you can. So... where exactly, does the player take the time to look around and be amazed by the game's amazing style? ... There's no time for it. Even the bosses. I've looked at them, but not for long at all -- otherwise, I'd be killed.

And it's really unfortunate. The game is beautiful, but it's mostly wasted potential.
The visuals are in complete conflict with the gameplay, instead of taking advantage of each of their highlights.

Other than that, feedback could be stronger, but isn't too much of an issue, as you die in mostly 1 hit. The ""death screen"" is also kind of annoying, but hey...


The [b]Music[/b] is also pretty good! It's very passive, though, with mostly eastern sounding melodies, with some [i]tribal[/i]textures. I enjoyed it, and it loops well enough. It also doesn't restart when you die (that I noticed, as least), and usually keeps playing, even when you go to the level select screen. I would have liked it to be a bit more active, but it's mostly personal preference. It works well in the game.


I'll give the [b]Story[/b] a paragraph, this time around. I think it was cool, to give the game some context, but I also have 2 issues with it.
The story is ""original"" (i.e. not taken from somewhere else), but it was pretty cliché. What it did, however, was give a bit of flavour about the mythological nature of the game, which is cool! And it has a nice cyclical theme to it.
One of the problems is that it was very barebones -- which is understanding in an hardcore platformer. However, I would have expected some more to go along the visuals.
The other one is that it's told [b]exclusively[/b] outside the game. It's just a narrated piece of text between each world...


[h1]General Structure & Mechanics[/h1]
The game has 3 tutorial level, and then 4 ""worlds"", with 4 levels each, plus a Boss-fight in the end.

Your character can walk around and jump, with a couple of abilities. The first is a [b]Dash[/b], while in the air. This dash can break some types of walls, and otherwise works as a double jump, essentially.
The other is [b]Teleportation[/b]. You shoot a little ball of light, and then teleport to it. This ball richochets some surfaces, sticks to others, and can also be destroyed by some (and enemies). You can also kill some enemies by teleporting directly inside them.

With that, it's mostly a game of avoiding enemies, spikes, and pools (and other hazards).

It's also [i]sort of[/i] physics driven. I say sort of, because the physics are extremely artificial, and often cause more problems than it solves.


[h1]In-depth look mechanical issues[/h1]
[i]Teleporting into enemies to kill them[/i]
Enemies kill you with one touch. I think the problem is self evident. If you do as much as miss the enemy by a pixel, you'll touch them after the teleport and simply die. This happens quite a lot. There's also the problem of ""enemies that can not be teleported into"" not showing any sign of that. So, you can also repeatedly try to kill them until you realize why you can't. 
Enemies also shoot projectiles that will kill you and the teleportation ball. It's often a mess, with several enemies on screen.

[i]Countless cheap and unavoidable deaths[/i]
Back to trial and error. There are enemies that come from off-screen. There are other that walk into you immediately, when you reach a new screen (usually Boss fights that rely on teleporting into another screen). 
Then, there are huge spiked balls that fall when you enter a new area...
The game is full of these deaths. You're focusing on one particularly challenging section, and when you're almost reaching the end, the game ""surprises"" you with more death. It can be annoying, since it's just about memorization.

[i]Artificial physics[/i] 
The game has some ramps to accelerate you, and throw you into a fast paced section. However, these don't actually function according to physics. When you touch them, your speed simply goes from 2 to 50. Even if you touch the extremity of it, you gain exactly the same speed. If you want to slow down and do the section in another way... tough luck.
Then, there's falling acceleration. Of course, your speed gets higher as you fall. Unfortunately, the teleportation conserves that acceleration, which means that successfuly pulling a second one in the air is virtually impossible. I could have seen some interesting sections, if you could teleport and reset your speed... Yet another limitation.

[i]Too punishing[/i]
Level design-wise, the challenges seem to long. Usually (and I've mentioned this in the Yury game), platformers have platforms that make you safe. This game seems to think that's too easy, and almost every platform falls. This stretches the challenges a lot, at times, and makes the game quite frustrating. 
There's one chance for everything. You can't recover from your mistakes. If you miss a jump, too bad... Everything falls and everything is designed to kill you. It's simply not fun. And it's not a fair challenge either. (Super Meat Boy is one of my favourite games)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's an ambitious effort! But, for the reasons above, the negatives far outweigh the positives. 
Ultimately, it's made of pieces that don't fit together... Still, the talent it clearly there, and I'll look forwward to their future games.",1428252166,1428252166,False,57,0,0.782171487808227539,0,False,False,False,False,,,

We have here two main skills - ""charge"" and shoot a small ball to which you can then teleport - and so we have to combine here, where and when to jump, sense the moment when to shoot the ball, all this is very engaging and really gives fun!

Although like many platformers and this one has its difficult annoying moments - unfortunately.
Another disadvantage is the price for the length of the game - I advise you to wait until the promotion because 15 euros is really a lot.

Once again I find myself in the land of difficult platformers with Lumenox Games' Aaru's Awakening (that's a mouthful). I'm not the best at the so-called “hard-core” platformers. Luckily for me, Aaru's Awakening only appears to be in the category, but mostly just skirts the line.

Most of the puzzles I've come across have been difficult, but not frustrating. It's an odd difference that separates this game, but in other games where I've died and died and died yet again, I haven't wanted to come back too often if at all. Aaru's Awakening had some boss fights and levels that straight killed me so many times it was rather embarrassing. I remember being stuck on one level (the levels are rather short) for more than thirty minutes. The very first boss fight took me about two days. I woke up early this last Tuesday to spend my last thirty minutes to finally tackled it.

The main pull is that the game is fun and with the tools given (not just jumping, but teleporting and charging) in Aaru's Awakening, when you fail, the successful attempt feels close at hand. If you've played any games in this genre you may know the difference between thinking a jump is impossible and being able to see how you can solve the “puzzle”. Lumenox Games accomplishes this well.

I'd love to say something about the story, but I feel it's a little lost in the action. Nothing is given to you while you are dying in the levels themselves. That's the main reason I know that (in the game) Dawn, Dusk, Day, and Night were at war and eventually decided to split the day in four parts and share the twenty-four hour period. (Sharing is caring right?) However, you (Aaru) are sent by Dawn into the others domain for... some reason, but like I said, I can't remember.

The game is narrated by a girl/woman who does a great job telling the story. The problem lies in that just after she's done giving you the setting for the level, you go into a meat grinder. In the game you come across stuff that will stump you and keep the end of the level just out of reach. Since the difficulty is tied to timing and the platforming itself, I can't turn down the difficulty to enjoy the story by itself. So the meat grinder just beats it out of my memory. When I get back to more narration I have no clue on why Aaru is confused with his actions or why he was sent into the domains of the other three parts of the day in the first place. Am I a bad guy? I just don't know.

Score: Gewd.

In the end, while I may not know what exactly is going on, Aaru's Awakening is fun. It's got genuinely hard parts for sure, but it never seems out of reach of being able to accomplish. When compared to other games in the platforming genre recently, this one feels friendly and approachable. This is very welcome because I've been bombarded lately by “hardcore” frustration-filled platformers. I'm kind of tired of them... completely tired.
