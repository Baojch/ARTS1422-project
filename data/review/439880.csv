Простой  настолько,  что  даже  я  с  моими  не  лучшими  навыками  игры  в  данный  жанр  прошёл  все  пятьдесят  уровней  с  “эпичным  сражением  в  конце”  попытки  с  седьмой.

Прошёл  всю  игру  эльфом  и  валькирией,  потыкал  других  персонажей,  но  разницы  почти  не  заметил,  к  тому  же,  чтобы  открыть  новых  героев  предстоит  собрать  кучу  карточек  персонажей  из  сундуков.  Любителям  идеальных  игр  категорически  не  рекомендую,  здесь  предстоит  очень  много  крабить  ради  бестиария  и  библиотеки,  а  проходить  игру  даже  дважды  не  возникает  ни  малейшего  желания.

К  недостаткам  отнесу  какое-то  странное  отношение  «Heroes  of  Loot  2»  к  полноэкранному  режиму  (я  так  и  играл  в  окне),  раздражающую  музыку  (выключил  ещё  на  втором  забеге),  а  также  один  раз  у  меня  сломался  уровень  таким  образом,  что  постоянно  вылетал,  вынудив  начать  новую  игру.

Lot of things going against this game. This mobile-type game did not give me the feelings of gauntlet.

So, starting with the gameplay, there are some elements that I did not like. The game uses auto-aim, so not much reason to use the twin-stick mechanic. (Probably for the mobile version!) With enemies spawning in the adjecent spaces, the game encourages simply holding down the fire key, while moving. Having to walk through a room of spike traps shows some weird hit detection, and the traps will keep draining life until you move off the space.

The music and sound was really what killed it for me. Hearing the traps go ""bang"" repeatedly was cringe-inducing, but turning off the sound would have made those traps harder to find. The music was hard on the ears, too.

Then the big surprise was the loot. For a game with loot in the title, I was surprised to see few lackluster items for use. The in-game items have very little item description, so you have to guess their subtle effects through observation. Then the legacy items were not impressive either. There are some characters to unlock, but since the characters either just spin or shoot pixels, I am just not interested in them.

I do not like this trend in games to provide basic information through unlocks. I had to kill a hundred bouncing skulls before the game let me know they were skeletons.

Technically, I had issues with my xbox-type controller. At one point it glitched out and kept running in a direction, with no way to fix except quitting. The keyboard is not usable when the controller is plugged in, so my co-op option is out. The game engine uses a java backend, and I feel like that does not always run great on linux systems.

Finally, the level design feels repeatitive and uninspired. The quests are as mundane as ""find a key."" One level will look like another one, and I never got a sense of satisfaction of finishing it. I suspect that if you have played other Orangepixel games, that you know what you are getting in this one. This seems like a mobile, casual design that has been used many times before, just within a dungeon setting here.",1530114350,1530115007,False,23,0,0.633919179439544678,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Вторая часть простенького Dungeon crawler'а, обзор первой части [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/volnes/recommended/359280/]тут[/url].
Изменений по сравнению с первой частью несколько:

-- Изменилась графика, не знаю в лучшую сторону или в худшую, но пикселятина стала еще та.
-- Добавили двух новых героев (вор, паладин).
-- Теперь мы не бегаем в одиночку, у нас есть соратник, то есть перед началом игры мы выбираем героя дального боя и следом героя ближнего боя в процессе игры переключаемся между ними.
-- Добавили пачку новых ачивок.
-- Появилось больше локаций.
-- Музыка в игре при продолжительной игре всё также раздражает.

Скажу одно игра по прежнему пойдет даже на калькуляторе, так как похоже что это порт с Android.

While the game sticks to the common standards, it presents new challenges and puzzles that will require thought/aggro.

Similar to arcade titles of old, the aggressive tone will punish and reward you.  This keeps the game balanced and enjoyable for many play throughs.  Strategy is basic, but critical.  You cannot rush every encounter.  As a fan of challenging games, this title is worth multiple attempts.

Gameplay is always the core of my interest.  The pace is either fast or at your own speed (depending how agressive you are).  It is also challenging, in that each room will require you to analyze the situation.  The traps cannot be ignored, nor can you bait every enemy.  Swapping your hero is required to progress (the AI might need a few tweaks to perfect this aspect, but it is nearly there).  Having two avatars feels like an advantage.  Strengths and weaknesses of each class should ne observed.  
I was unable to test local co-op, but I can imagine how much fun it could be.  Perhaps online/friend based co-op?  This opens the door for countless additional puzzles.

The controls seem to be built for a plug-in style controller.  As of June 7/16, I could not find a ""customize controls"" menu.  Perhaps my own inability, but the WASD keys had been replaced by the arrow pad.  This made it awkward with the mouse.  Once I plugged a third party controller in, everything made sense.

Pixel art is one of my soft spots.  I applaud the quality of dynamic sprites.  Objects have great cycles, not just torches and enemies.  Event statues have motion/glow, while health and exp orbs dance around you.  The objects are easy to differentiate and bring the areas to life.  Obviously, the avatar sprites are fantastic - attack skills are amazing as they level up.  It is easy forget judgment on the level back-drop.  It blends in and supports the existing mood.  A balance is difficult to strike in these situations.  Perhaps a few more tiles could use polish (but I do not fault the developer on this, atmosphere is perfect).  Maybe a bit more variations in group tiles?


Love the pace, risk/reward and colour palette of the game.  If you need a new hack/slash medival title, I offer my recommendation.  In Canadian dollars, 10$ is reasonable in todays market.  Personally, I will spend more time in this game than most new AAA titles.  I am a fan of supporting developers and trying new things.  For a more discerning crowd, I would understand 10$ being a hair high (only due to June 7/16 testing + bugs).  At the first Steam Sale, you must try this game.

In full disclosure,  I try and review games that are new to the scene.  Only a review are under my belt.  Looking forward to bug patches and additions, I would recommend this title.",1465366703,1465366703,True,11,0,0.604570508003234863,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I was pleasantly surprized by the first Heroes of Loot, and this one improves on everything that was enjoyable in the first one, and goes beyond.

After watching the trailer I saw some similarities in art style and game play style, so this was an insta-purchase for me. 

I've been having a blast. All the same addictive dungeon crawling from Space Grunts, but a much faster game play pace. I particularly like the booby traps. Again, Space Grunts had some really cool booby traps, so it's fantastic to see the dev continue to include them in future games. OrangePixel is/are beginning to establish a game style and it really works. This is a developer to watch. 


[h1]Some key review points:[/h1]

- Fast paced, hectic game play. Collect tons of loot, smash enemies with multiple characters, switch them in and out in real time. Enemy AI is balanced and fun. My only critique of the game play is that it's really easy for a while at the start of the game. I wasn't challenged at all for at least an hour of game play. As I've mentioned a few times, Space Grunts, another game by O.P was tough straight away.

- Cute, bold pixel art visual style.

- Subtle,well suited music and some great sfx.

- From my 2.7 hours of play time, I've explored only a small amount. Heroes of Loot 2 is packed with content and replayability.",1463326628,1463329808,True,18,1,0.681797683238983154,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Chose 2 characters out of 4 (you pick one melee, one ranged, so 4 combinations) and dive into a deep, procedurally generated dungeon full of loot, enemies and permanent unlocks.

Controls (joypad, XB 360 compatible for me): left stick move, right stick aimed attack, X auto-aimed attack towards the nearest enemy, Y swap chars. The auto-aimed attack works pretty well, only if you deliberately want to, say, target the (mini) boss while ignoring his adds you need to use the stick.
Pickups consist of health/xp items, money (3 currencies for shopping, level skip and to pay healers), special weapons, defensive items, scrolls with various effects (which have to be unlocked to spawn), bombs or quest items.
Graphics are nice pixel-art with some good-looking particle effects and very good lighting thrown in, the tile sets for the background vary enough so no 'been there, done that' feeling sets in.

Difficulty curve could need some adjustment, it starts out very easy and you don't really have to watch your health, and then, somewhat suddenly you encounter enemies that can kill you in a few seconds, leaving me with a 'Wait, WHAT?' feeling - which wouldn't be too bad, if it weren't for the slog to get through the early levels again with the next play-through. That said, you can find shortcuts that skip 3 or 4 levels fairly frequently, but that means you lose out on the experience to level your characters. It might be that the permanent unlocks will eleviate that problem down the line, so you might be able to skip the first levels without being too weak later on, but that's too early to assess right now (~4 hrs in).

Another thing you have to get used to is the frequency damage is dealt to you. Trap tiles, contact damage or e.g. the flame breath of the minotaur feel like they tick every other (or maybe every 3) frame(s). I don't know the exact numbers, but standing on something that damages you can take a third of your health in a second or so - some slight adjustment on the i-frames might help.
On the technical side, it's quite solid, sometimes the music changes too often (playing a different track just a couple seconds after the last one started), [strike]the dice (found in the shop) can crash the game[/strike] (game saves at the start of each level, so you wont lose 10 lvls worth of progress), and there are some rare level generation bugs. 
Coming from Orangepixel's last game, Space Grunts, which I also bought right at it's EA release, I'm very confident these issues will be fixed during EA.",1463215667,1463235314,True,8,0,0.584960401058197021,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I really enjoyed the original on mobile and played it tons

Lots of cool items and loot secret areas
with a very large variety of things to kill
like the first one it has very simplistic gameplay and controls but with a bit more variety than the original
although plenty of fun its lacking in some ways
Traps - more like a visual thing
they do almost no damage and theres really no reason to look out for them ocasionaly ill step on a spike trap for to long and dent my hp but thats about it
Levels - although plenty of variety i have no idea whats what or how hard its ment to be
i go from stage 3 to stage 7 then 13 (using secret areas) then i get into the swers then i go to some other stages without being able to tell anything other than the level name
Loot - so far the gems have been pretty useless and when you do get an item i have no idea where your ment to find out what you have so an invntory or something would be nice
Bosses - there not hard just time wasting like very time wasting
the bosses are basically a way to spend all your time without progressing the only way ive been able to kill any boss in reasonable time is with the valkyrie other than that there not really difficult just have alot of health
Valkyrie - you dont need anything other than the valkyrie its has super high and quick damage hits everything around it and is all in all op tried using everything else but when it comes down to it the valkyrie just kills everything would be nice to see a little more character balancing

also would be nice to have an xp bar so i have some idea of how much im leveling and if xp pots are worth it
but all in all its a fairly good game and i will definitely be following devol0pment until then - Blamzite",1463214530,1463215930,True,7,0,0.562249958515167236,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I've just jumped in and played two games so here are my first impressions.

The game looks nice and is pretty similar in gameplay to the last one. The controls are simple, aim with the mouse and move with the arrow keys clicking on people to interact. 

For a game just beginning it's early access there sure is a good amount of content here, A bunch of passive and interesting items, enemy variety, levels, teleporters, cool bosses and very funny level transitions. The game doesn't take itself very seriously at all, cracking a joke whenever it can, which is definetly a plus for me. You unlock items in the game by collecting fragments of the item. When you collect all of the fragments you unlock the item which is very cool. The game gets deceptively super hard later and can start to give you an bit of a challenge which is actually pretty cool.

Now all that being said here are some things to work toward.

The games did randomly hard crash after a certain point usually in shop areas, but I'm sure that'll be worked on in time. Luckly the game has an autosave feature, so even if it does crash it's not too frustrating.

Now although fun, the game feels a bit chaotic. While other roguelites like TBOI and Spelunky have set level paths clearly labeling a ""Level 1"" and ""Level 2"", HoL2 doesn't feel that way. Instead I jump around to different levels each play through not knowing where I am or how far I've gotten. The game could really benefit from a ""Level Map"" like in the level transitions of TBOI. Or a difficulty meter when you enter a level to show how much harder the floor is going to be.

Difficulty definitely gets there eventually but all in all feels a bit easy to start comparitive to other games like this and I would love to see the starting max Health decreased or More enemies at the start and maybe a slightly faster Rocko! ;) The game feels like you're being babied a little in the beginning which can be frustrating when you make it pretty far, die, and have to go through like 4 levels for it to start being hard again. I want to be challenged the WHOLE time. But thats really just a personal problem.

The game does way more right then wrong IMO, I love the game and I'm super glad I bought it. I can't wait to follow the development of the game and It can only get better from here. I'll be watching Orange Pixel! XD
