刚刚玩了个开头，女主一开头和一群老男人在酒吧社交……  
对于一个死宅冲击力还蛮大的......
然后成年人社交果然就是异常无聊吧 完全不知道这些东西有什么好聊？
然后女主非常小心翼翼....
女主想要找人约会 结果发现对方忙工作 于是觉得自己考虑好欠妥 内疚了
是霓虹游戏吗动不动不安一下子 奇奇怪怪
 
俩男的说女主 这么优秀肯定是有男友了。。。emmm  
完全不需要先问问女主对感情的看法在那自说自话真的没问题么 
女主说自己没有。。。 

然后发现这个游戏是可以选择支线 喜欢谁就攻略谁 
点了个名字相对来说感觉好听的。。。 
第一章上来 这个叔告诉女主 自己是离过婚的。。。 
好的吧。。。女主感觉很开心对方没有老婆。。。

总的来说目前还没感觉到男主们的魅力在哪里 
女主塑造的很娇羞少女 。。。我以为攻略大叔的至少也是一个 成熟知性的人
结果是小女孩  感觉有点失衡 
如果后面还是把女生塑造的很客体化和被动 会觉得这个剧本挺差劲的

。。。以及   有预感
这个游戏玩完以后会让我完全失去对中年男性的滤镜
彻底抛弃对大龄男的幻想

[u]①剧情（全是剧透）[/u]
个人喜好：丰泉＞法幢＞汤濑本篇＞树神＞安良城＞＞汤濑续章

[h1]会社社长[/h1]
[b]汤濑龙之介[/b]·Yuze Ryunosuke  [spoiler]CV：井上和彦[/spoiler]
初心的大叔，[strike]一眼顶针鉴定为李泽言老年版的类型[/strike]，但性格其实还挺傲娇，直接被女主三下五除二拿下了，真的有被冰山诈骗到……
本篇内容还好，一场酒后乱吻引发的猜心游戏，能泡到中年单身总裁真的被你女主赚到了吼~汤濑的设定是由于斯托卡引发的恐女症，但工作是卖女性内衣这点反差还蛮好笑的，喜欢粉色花纹内衣的霸总。
作为亲儿子[strike]亲爹[/strike]待遇，居然有两段大篇章，但续章的内容也太令人难评了……
公司总裁和作为秘书的太太在办公室疯狂doi，被竞争对手拍到了之后当做要挟要收购公司，一边保护公司一边心疼爱人，后续女主所有的事情都强行降智——太太，你也不想自己老公破产吧，堕落吧成为我的人……什么本子phb剧情啊受不了！？
按自己想法，选完结局居然只有不到50分？！中途一度以为我哪一步选错导致锁分了……
只能说，樱花妹的脑回路和熊猫妹确实是…不一样，这本子在晋江会被喷死吧……
结局更是重量寄，用来吸引客人的手段居然是女主当众脱衣大秀内衣？？给我整不会了……汤濑您是有点子绿帽癖在身上的我说。
总结：续章，狗都不玩。


[h1]刑事[/h1]
[b]树神秀彰[/b]·Kodama Hideaki  [spoiler]CV：关俊彦[/spoiler]
警察是我最想嫁的职业no.1捏，阿秀警官怕鬼又怕黑，阳光开朗有魅力真的很苏呀~剧情写的还算合理，年少的苦痛经历与成年后的不悦案件交织，让他成为患得患失甚至怀疑自己是否有活下去资格的可怜人，这是一个女主变成他救赎的故事——不幸的童年要用一生去治愈的故事。
确认关系后会担心自己年龄和女主差太多，调侃自己可以当她爸爸的桥段也比较忍俊不禁，让人想起远藤宪一和渡部笃郎演的《让我叫声“爹”》了。
但不得不说，还是在别人篇章里的树神比较有魅力，在自己的主场，反而因为一些言不由衷、瞻前顾后，变得扭扭捏捏甜度下降（叹气）


[h1]Bartender[/h1]
[b]丰泉聪一郎[/b]·Toyoizumi Souichiro  [spoiler]CV：堀内贤雄[/spoiler]
体验很好的一章，前清水后狂野，互通心意之前绝不碰女主分毫，但言语间暧昧到眼神儿都拉丝儿的欲言又止感——爱是伸出又收回的手。
女主初次表明心意时，丰泉明明开心的要心脏爆掉，还是克制住声音说：确定吗？和我这种年龄的人？是的呀，喜欢的人是想要做的呀，一瞬间把女主问蒙了。
比较震撼的是无论在kiss还是doi的时候都会说：睁看眼睛看着我，看好你在和谁做……真的一整个大震惊，又色又霸气。途中能把女主做睡着，做完腰疼一天的小细节也真的很爆笑就是了2333
故事线也还好，无敌全能的哥哥养活废物弟弟几十年，养到两个人都成了老头子，才终于等到第一个愿意和他携手从自家酒吧迎接清晨的女人。


[h1]恋爱小说家[/h1]
[b]法幢赖寿[/b]·Hodo Yorihisa  [spoiler]CV：小杉十郎太[/spoiler]
双赢赌局的恋爱游戏，这一章的剧情设置最具戏剧性。记得当时初见第一位选的他，倒不是因为设定喜欢，纯粹是听了闺蜜想看的选了大学教授……结果压根儿和师生恋没关系（楽）。
顶级pua大师，接吻狂魔，放置play高手，明明看上去是个草食系结果居然是所有人里最黑的……
唯二个提到前任的角色，反而让这位年过半百的大叔在所有人里因为真实感脱颖而出：毕竟现实里，这个pub如果聚集了一堆40+未婚大龄金龟婿，很难不让人觉得是个gay pub吧……
除了在初期把女主玩弄虐待到身心俱疲之外，后期又当头一棒告知对方她只是亡妻的代餐，宛宛类卿了属于是……法幢老师的线是真难选，没有故意去走，居然结局只有不到50分，这男人心里到底在想什么啊（恼怒）
倒是出了个金句——男人是不要爱情也可以doi的生物。[strike]代入到女主，整个萎掉了靴靴……[/strike]


[h1]辩护士[/h1]
[b]安良城护[/b]·Arashiro Mamoru  [spoiler]CV：小山力也[/spoiler]
立绘表现最优越没有之一的幸运儿，浪子回头的极道律师，和女主年龄差小到可以喊大哥的伪叔叔。只不过简介诈骗，丝毫没看出来“女权”在哪儿……卟是很理解你们霓虹女权的理解哈。
与前任以及黑帮老大儿子有一场以死相逼的三角恋，乙游男前任活不过开局定律√
很大胆的拿下女主一血居然是深夜公园的夜炮，以及不出意外的被拍到，[strike]这游戏每次不在私密空间doi就会被拍下当证据定律……[/strike]
整体剧情没什么槽点和记忆点，一眼猜到的结局，但立绘表现是真的优越，是上面四位男士羡慕出水的程度。


[h1]外科医生[/h1]
[b]百目鬼春臣[/b]·Doumeki Hruomi  [spoiler]CV：藤原启治[/spoiler]
别找了，没有彩蛋，这是CM诈骗，并不存在这个人……
为什么啊！？上了steam的最终完成版本，把这个人吞掉了为什么为什么为什么？？？甚至不愿放进DLC……藤原老师遗作又少一部我哭死。



[u]②画面&操作[/u]
没有云存档真的不明白这种游戏存在的意义……
界面UI是典中典的日式乙女手游那种廉价flash模板。翻译的不咋地，错字连篇，排版不对，您制作组完全没有校对是吗？
作为一个视觉小说，手柄不支持也就算了，居然还不能鼠标滚轮翻页？！这种反人类的操作我建议彻底滚出Visual Novel界哈，鼠标好悬没给我按烂了。
画面很崩，让本就油腻的故事显得更加咸湿了……看了下原设是わいあっと太太，谁懂啊心在滴血，怎么说呢……不能因为是米给的少的商稿就摸了吧，有些立绘丑到截图但又怕污染自己列表不敢放出来……这很难评。



[u]③音乐&文字[/u]
连贯性超级差！差到爆！！不是音乐本身不好，由于章节本身的跳跃性，导致前一秒还是开车的暧昧配乐，下一秒马上收放开始进入谈事bgm……割裂感很强的好吧！
加上文字写的很咸湿，一些简单粗暴的文字描述感觉在看男性向的小黄文噗噗噗
没有配音，却又不是完全没声音。不理解为什么官方肯花大价格请知名叔系声优去配广播剧，也不愿意让他们哪怕录个“哼”、“哈”、“哦”、”唔“在游戏正片里……为什么啊（恼怒）哪怕配个关键语句也好嘛！

       树神线，店长线能够符合这个价钱应有的价值（原价的话倒也真的不很值），安良城也还行（前期一般有点过火），剩下的那俩就......玩的好窒息
       整体剧情流程方面，一个人线路＋后话番外平均是两小时，每个人都有不同的剧情和主线，对于每个人的攻略方式和套路也不一样是优点，还有一个优点就是每个人的人设都做得算是蛮的OK真的都还不错，每个人都有自己的独特风格特色和观念什么的，人物是饱满的。无虐，甜饼，HE，叔控可尝试。优点方面中规中矩，没有什么好很吹夸的，只是乙女游戏基本该做的一些基本大方面没太出错就是了（缺点有 在下面）。个人最喜欢树神线，其次是店长线，其次安良城线，个人魅力都挺大的也很甜（树神你最可爱啦）。
       缺点方面，缺点巨大，在玩之前我还期待了一下会不会有声优不过当然是不可能的（甚至连语音条都没有），场景来回就那几个也算不上精致和用心，人物立绘有些有严重脸崩情况真的很致命（汤和法俩人的立绘就是...真的不想再吐槽了，脸部问题真的致命，法的立绘是怎么可以那么的...怪异，尤其是那个衣服我真的见一次皱一眉。这也是我玩这两人线路体验感差的重要原因）CG基本崩坏严重我不忍心看，有些简直就是在攻击我的眼睛。谢邀了，乙女游戏这么潦草简直就是一秒下头
女主恋爱脑且完全被动又无脑，简直就是离谱他妈妈给离谱开门 离谱到家了，我玩了这么多乙游这个女主真的是会让我锤键盘的程度，而且脑回路很莫名，面对明明是在被调戏的反应也让我狠狠无语。典型害羞小白花娇妻型女主，遇到的危险都是为了给男主英雄救美作铺垫，毫无个人特色风格，普通且我感觉不到亮点，太被动。整个游戏就内核方面，完全是老一套的依赖被动式套路（可能跟年份有关系，毕竟早期乙游了在这女性意识方面真的不强）
讲道理，有一些场景和对话，就是大家聚在一起的时候什么的，我明白制作的可能是想让玩家感觉到那种温馨的氛围之类的，那就我个人而言基本上是有点失败的因为真的太  尴  尬，槽点很多，我已经很久很久没有在乙女游戏里体验这么尴尬的感觉了，女主那种“看到大家就感觉坏心情烟消云散了呢”的感觉原谅我真的理解不能，那根本不是正常很要好的朋友们之间的感觉啊反正就是不对味啊！哦还有一点，汉化bug多。
乙女游戏制作门槛低，但是真正的乙女玩家对于乙女游戏的要求是很高的，我曾经在窒息时刻用这个游戏是2016年的不要要求那么高啦之类的来安慰自己但是说真的，从个人标准上来说这个游戏就是达不到要求，游戏质感会有一种廉价感，游戏整体最大卖点就是大叔年龄差成熟感这种类型但是讲真的我觉得制作商并没有掌控好，划分的话也是属于那种平平无奇的类型，老套的女主性格和剧情进程，（单看剧情方面前期还行 后期矛盾冲突解决的太草率会感觉前面白铺垫那么久）是一个老乙游人搭眼一瞧就知道会是什么发展的那种等级的乙女游戏。
       总体中等（稍微有点偏下但又没有很差），原价不值且会亏。(我个人对于乙女游戏的要求稍微比较严格，但原价真的不值) 玩的时候不能带脑子玩，尤其是对于乙女游戏要求和门槛偏高的玩家，玩的时候最好别太走心，就当无聊看看剧情图一乐就行 。当然啦，如果你没有那么高的标准要求，那么玩得开心！",1672235641,1672235641,False,4,0,0.55163043737411499,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Neben den uninteressanten Stories, wird hier eigentlich entweder nur gevögelt (oh sorry 'Liebe gemacht' natürlich) oder geheult, was echt super nervig war. Dazu kommt, dass die Kerle halt auch einfach unfassbar ugly sind - auch die CG Artworks sind einfach scheiß hässlich. Haben Dogenza noch nie geile alte Kerle gesehen? Vorallem weil deren erstes Spiel mit den Nutten soviel schönere Artworks hatten.

1. Very bad writing.  There are several gaps in the story, and while you would like to see here problems and issues found when people get old and life happens, you most likely to find very weak excuses, childish behaviour, and pure lack of interesting context overall.

2. Very submissive MC. There are two states for this MC, first, Absolutely accepting EVERYTHING ""for love"". (Please don't), and second, crying for everything. Absolutely everything and anything. 

3. This is not interactive at all.  MC talks a lot with herself, sometimes you feel like reading a book. The choices are very obvious and duo. Nothing else.

Positive points:
1. The art style for the game is good. 
2. You will learn a lot about the ""hidden"" meaning of drinks you will never ever try.

The Protag: 

She's extremely bland and makes a lot of really dumb choices. I get that she's supposed to be younger and therefore not as ""wise"" as the love interests (and even when I put it in quotations, I'm still using that word very generously), but there's a lot of choices she makes that go against basic common sense. On top of that, she has a lot of moments where she's extremely annoying. Just to name a few examples, she apologizes all the time for everything, she bursts into tears over everything, and she never stops being shy and embarrassed even after boning any of the love interests. ""Yes, we've already had a few sex scenes in the game, but how dare you see me naked just now! I'll never live it down!"" Maybe it's a cultural thing, I don't know, but it comes across as ridiculous. And of course, protags aren't always going to be perfect, but when you're the one who has to play that character, it can get exceptionally frustrating.

The Men:

Their routes range from the cliched ""I could never love again... but true love wins!"" to, ""What the hell did I just read?!"" Granted, the parts that land in the latter category are a lot more interesting so I've gotta give it that, but it's still one hell of a whiplash after a few routes have already given you the expectation that there's not going to be anything particularly remarkable about any of them.

Some of the men are very manipulative, which I guess isn't too much of a bad thing. After all, troubled relationships are a thing and you can't always expect these kinds of stories to end with the relationship being a perfectly healthy one. But, unfortunately, the protag never seems to understand when she's in a bad situation and should probably reconsider things. Once she wants the guy, come hell or high water, she's going to stay with the guy even when it's probably a bad idea. And that's just when it comes to the way they treat her.

Either way, you can expect the same formula with all of them. They flirt, they start to get close, drama happens, the man disappears for anywhere from a week to a month (think 3rd act breakup), the other men tell the protag to keep trying, they reunite, they lived happily ever after.

Some of the men are, however, not a bad choice so there's a decent mix of both.

Lots of Typos:

I understand when these games get translated there's usually going to be a few mistakes here and there. And that's fine. But then there are times when it's just inexcusable. For example, in Mamoru's route, there's a few times when they accidentally use the wrong name. Ex: """"Did you need anything?"" I asked. ""No thanks,"" Shiori said as he stood up."" And no, that's not when the POV switched over to Mamoru. That was when it was still Shiori. And there are a lot of mistakes in general, making it very distracting.

The Music:

It's bad. That's all. Just bad.

Repetitive Writing:

The epilogues are the biggest culprits when it comes to this. These often drag on and often close out the route in a very clunky manner. There's usually at least one important plot point that will happen so it's not like skipping it is much of an option, but you have to get through a lot of repetitive dialogue and narration to get to it. And even then it'll often stretch past the point where it could have just ended. Other moments are either poorly translated or written and I'm honestly not sure which it is. There's moments where the characters will have professed their love for each other, and then in the next breath claim they don't know how the other feels about them. Or they'll react to a love confession as though it's the first time they've heard it even though it was already said earlier.

All of that said, I can't say I fully hated the game. At the very least, I wanted to get to the end of some of the routes because I genuinely wanted to know what happened. Others I kinda slogged through as a matter of principle. But at the same time I can't really recommend it. If you really want to give this game a try, I'd advise waiting for it to be on sale at least.",1632498796,1632498796,False,5,0,0.598529338836669922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't know if it is a character thing, or it is because I'm close to 30 right now, all the other games with young, energetic LI's were quite tiring for me. Even though the story and the LI's in here are definitely NOT perfect, pacing and the level of maturity was a pleasant change for me.

MC is I guess around her early or mid 20's looking at how LIs keep emphasizing the youth and the age gap. Although she is shallow half the time and quick to fall in love without knowing the smallest thing about the LI, she was one of the most assertive ones I've seen up until this point (though I'm quite new to this genre).

Given that I wouldn't be considered as a young adult or fresh youth at the nice and ripe age of 28(lol), I found LIs -apart from Soichiro- were quite charming compared to other games I've played. I'm not judging if you're into way-way-older men, but honestly, I just played Soichiro's route so fast that it could be a new speed reading record on my side. It was quite creepy, to be honest. Although apart from his route, he is a quite charming old man you can easily chat as a bartender or an acquaintance. Most people in the reviews mentioned Yorihisa and Mamoru being manipulative. Yorihisa was manipulative all right, especially at the end of his route I was appalled by what was in the box he gave to the MC. Even though he doesn't explicitly -as far as I remember- do it, he compares MC with someone from the past. Ryunosuke has the most stable route I guess. He is shy and not very comfortable with women, quite understandably considering some things he experienced. Hideaki has a sad story but boi his route is fast-paced and underdeveloped. I would love to have a longer and well-written Hideaki route instead of a needless 2nd season of Ryunosuke honestly. Mamoru didn't strike me as a manipulative one but an exaggerated version of a PLAYA with a big ego (he accepts his ego is massive) and since I'm quite an avid Yakuza fan, his story piqued my interest a lot (He is also the youngest - and one of the types I liked design-wise). Like Hideaki, I would love to see a more detailed version of his story too because it was short and fast-paced too. 

The artworks were quite good, but there is an inconsistency between them regarding MC's eyes. Like, in one artwork she has eyes, in the other, she doesn't have them. In some of them, her facial features, in general, are extremely vague. Other than that, similar to other Dogen titles I've played, 3 of the characters have the same face model with little tweaks. I don't expect them to be extremely different from each other, but they are too similar. Music was repetitive, but most of the time it was a smooth melody, so I've just decreased it while playing.

Personally, I liked the game. Is it perfect? Nah. It is a cheap, smutty, otome game that has characters whose behaviors would definitely be problematic one way or another in a normal society. But compared to the ones I've played up until this point, I've enjoyed this one.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. I enjoyed it very much and it was without a doubt my favorite out of Dogenzaka Labs, but it shares every fault that comes with the title. I would advise you to buy it only from a sale.

In so many instances the characters defined what a woman is, what a man is not, making me feel like I'm having a conversation with my grandfather. Those moments, and some more similar views, were most of what my annoyance came from.

The rest of this review will contain spoilers.

[b] The MC [/b]
She was bold, didn't have a problem pursuing the guy she liked, flirted, and admitted her feelings with ease. I was really surprised by her openness and eagerness.

The biggest problem was whenever the guy of the route touched her without her consent, refusing to stop despite her protests, she excused his actions, saying, ""this is okay if it's going to help/make him believe me.""

Another thing I hate is when the guys make disrespectful jokes about her because they consider it 'teasing,' it's usually framed as flattering, so all she does is blush in response.

[b] The Story [/b]
The MC discovers a pub named Audire. This happens the first thing you start the prologue, so you don't deal with anything that doesn't play around the guys.

Most of the backstories weren't handled nicely. Dogenzaka Lab has a way that never changes. [i]The MC realizes her feelings, things happen, casually unwrapping backstories without much thought, confession, and happy ending.[/i] 

Each of the guys has a Tragic™ backstory, which makes them closed off to the MC at first. But of course, she sticks her nose into their business and learns all about their problems. After this, pretty much everything turns out okay. In some of the routes, the guy has to face his past, but usually, just after he shares his problem with the MC, he heals.

[b] The Guys [/b]
A few of them harassed the MC without much remorse, very Dogenzaka of them. Despite that, they also seemed to respect MC better and more realistically than most other Dogenzaka guys do to their MCs.

It was refreshing for them to all simply like MC without an ulterior motive, and each other too.  They were often nice to her and bonded over common things. No matter whose route you were playing, they were helpful and encouraging.

I listed the routes from my best to worst.

Soichiro Toyoizumi
His brother is financially dependent on him, which results in a messy dynamic between himself, his brother, and the MC. His relationship with the MC is quite sweet and fun. they truly bonded and worked together.

He was a little frustrating to get through at times. Early on, he saves MC from an assault and reassures her that she has nothing to apologize for and it wasn't her fault, that's good. Later, both he and his brother harass the MC, not to the same degree, but it felt very tone-deaf.

Mamoru Arashiro (43)
Quite the misogynist here. He had connections to some yakuza and after he quit, it began to haunt him. A woman, who allegedly encouraged him to leave, committed suicide after he left so the man who loved her wanted revenge. He looked good in a suit.

Yorihisa Hodo (51)
He's a writer both you and Ryu like. He uses this as leverage to start a bet with you. Whoever falls in love first loses.

His story is that his wife and daughter died. When MC learns that, she suspects he's being close to her because she resembles his wife, which he confirms, so the MC gets upset, rightfully. Later, he gives MC a dress that belonged to his late wife as a part of his act of love.

Hideaki Kodoma (46)
His relationship with the MC starts quite sweet, both of them eager to develop something. His backstory was heavy but dealt with like an afterthought. It's obvious he's traumatized by it but the only thing he shows is his stress and he heals really quickly once MC gets involved. The writing in his route was a little awkward and strangely rushed as well.

Ryunosuke Yuze (41)
In his main story, you deal with his stalker, who attacks you and him. As a result of trauma, he doesn't trust women. He does say he's wrong to think that way, but he has some lines regarding ""women are evil but you're not like other girls.""

In his second season, you deal with a man that hates him and wants to steal you. He loses his company and together, you try to get it back.
 
His route is more focused on the plot compared to the others, and the romance is the least steamy, although somewhat more explicit. He was a nice and gentle guy overall, but I'm listing him low because I found his story to be quite dull, and the writing awkward. Despite their nice gestures, MC was distanced from other guys too. Ryu was a little cold toward them in a way he wasn't in others' routes.

[h1] Summary [/h1]
If the concept interests you, I definitely recommend giving it a go. I like the characters and the story, and the general atmosphere created is nice too: a pub and its welcoming regulars there to comfort you. Once the guys open their mouths, it's a very rocky road and may be frustrating to experience. If you're familiar with Dogenzaka games, you know the problems they usually have.

From what I've seen, it's pretty polarizing, either you absolutely love it, or you despise it with your whole being, although there are rare middle-grounds. I adore this game, it's made me laugh out loud because of it's so over the top, but also I've felt very attached to some characters *cough* Mamoru and Hide *cough*. I'm honestly not that experienced with visual novels, I tend to lean to Nitro+Chiral stuff (BL), and the only proper otome I've played is Mystic Messenger so this review is from the perspective of a very occasional visual novel player. 

Also I have a pretty big thing for old 2D men, especially if they're DILFs, so this caters specifically to me, minus the dad part, but anyways they're still old, hot anime men~

But even I must warn about some stuff inside this game, there are some technical issues and some stuff that can be triggering for some people, I actually wanted to recommend this game to someone, but when they asked me if it had some triggers, I couldn't omit some stuff from some routes, and they decided not to play it for their mental health.

The writing is very over the top, but I don't think it would be wise to buy a game named ""Pub Encounter: Forbidden Romance"" thinking it's a game you should take seriously, I personally had a blast because I was very aware of its potential writing flaws, and I got exactly what I was expecting, making me satisfied. This game is very cliché and requires a big suspension of disbelief, so if you're into liking stuff ironically or like ""bad"", cliché romance stories I would totally recommend this game. You can easily predict the plot most of the time, but if you like a ride to a predictable, yet entertaining path for pure self-indulgence is very good. In some routes you bang a lot and in some others not so much; but you'll end up banging every romanceable option at some point in the story.

Although Mamoru and Hideaki's routes were the most fast-paced, I got really attached to the characters because they hit all of my husbando boxes (and also have beards) and they have angsty pasts, so I'm soft. I wanna marry Mamoru, the lawyer with a dangerous past and I wanna hug Hide and tell him everything is ok. They are the closest to each other and appear in each other's routes way more than the rest and they get the most worried about each other and are almost always hanging out together so my headcanon is that they're best friends and now ship them with my whole soul, so I'm starving for content *cries* 
Ryu is the sweetest one, Soichiro the most mature and realistic (to the extent of possible within this novel), and Yorihisa is kinda... the manipulative one. 
The MC is kinda dumb at times and her personality is weak, but she shines the most and is very bold on Ryu's route. I'm assuming is like that for the easier the self-projection that kind of bland character has, so I can't really judge her for being written like that. She's in her 20's and I'm currently 20, so from my perspective she's kinda there, but reminds me more of my younger self at times, but she acts like generally like a young adult, a mildly naive adult. She's not really embarrassed by sex, and I heard that most MCs in other games are more childish in that regard so I can relate to her in that aspect because is rare to be embarrassed by it as an adult.

The music is cool and smooth; it has few tracks but they work pretty well. The looping is not perfect, but to the point of feeling distracting or bothersome. This game doesn't have voice acting, and I'm salty about that because the characters (at least the main five) do have official voices because there is a CD drama (yes I'm that deep into this, help). My favorite voices are Mamoru and Hide (I wonder why haha), Mamoru is Rikiya Koyama, and he also voices Shinjuro Rengoku, my current supreme husbando so I'm losing my mind; and Hide is the same VA as Muzan Kibutsuji (sorry, I don't remember his name), and his acting is awesome because his voice adapts so well to Hide, he has great versatility.

I'm an art student, so the sprites and CGs made me suffer a little, but I appreciated the vibe. I liked the backgrounds, although they sometimes had whack perspective, but you can ignore that if you don't really focus on it. The CGs made me wince a little sometimes, the coloring was kinda inconsistent technique-wise and the anatomy was sorta ok, I guess... eh. The artist seemed not to be that experienced drawing older men, the faces are a bit odd, but you can guess easily what type of design feel they were aiming at. Tbh the prettiest (and better drawn character) is Mamoru, but he's my favorite so I'm happy with him. 
I wish they had drawn more character sprites, there were many side characters that appeared constantly in their respective routes depending on the guy you chose that didn't have a sprite (only the main five love interests and Minoru, the gossip grandpa, have sprites) so it was lacking in that regard.

About the triggers, I've seen a lot of people hating on Mamoru because he has some consent issues the first time you bang with him, I considered that scene dub-con because I've read way worse things *coughs in Nitro+Chiral*, but later when you bang, the MC is all the way into it. I didn't really mind about that issue because he's cute and doesn't exist and I'm aware this is a very unrealistic story, but I know some people can't stand that stuff. Another thing is that they call him a manipulator, but I think is really mild compared to what happens in Yorihisa's route, like he's THE manipulator of the game but I don't wanna spoil; his relationship with MC is especially unbalanced and that can also be a turn-off for some. There are other routes that deal with PTSD because of childhood trauma with non-specific nor graphic child abuse, so have that in mind. Another route deals with stalkers, but is mild compared to other media I've seen. 

So, in synthesis, I really like this game despite its many flaws because I knew exactly what to expect from it, and it has made me pass great laughs are heart-fell moments through this self-isolation times, I felt happier in my daily life during these two weeks because I was genuinely invested in this wacky game. 
I would say, buy it if you like this stuff, but wait for a discount.

Now I'mma replay Mamo and Hide's routes and cry while I draw and write MamoHide for my own consumption, sorry if post too much in the art section bc it's almost deserted now and I need to see Mamoru and Hide on a date bye <3

Besides Ryunosuke (first season), I didn't really find the routes that interesting or attention-worthy. Soichiro is sweet (BUT OLD), Yorihisa is a jackass, Hideaki is sweet and goofy, and Mamoru has probably been slapped with several sexual harassment suits. MC is a supreme idiot in Mamoru's route which was upsetting.

The stories are pretty short and mostly cliche; the protagonist is yet another nameless, faceless girl in her twenties struggling in a boring office job and lacking any sort of back story, motivations, or ambitions for her future (except somewhat in Ryunosuke's route).

每个叔叔我都好喜欢，我家湿织真是个又可爱又坏的孩子呢~



下面是人物盘点！！！

因为看了b站-怒jo的视频入坑，所以最先推的就是jo最喜欢的店长丰泉，果然十分儒雅禁欲，感觉是所有角色里比较矜持的一位，所以当他摘下眼镜和湿织做爱做的事的时候，这反差真的是惊呆我了，总之我有种对待长辈的态度（说白了就是不敢太放肆.jpg）

下一位是安良城，jo很不喜欢这个角色来着，因为过于热情而有种很放荡的感觉。但是我喜欢啊啊啊啊啊！！！这么会撩的叔叔给我来一沓啊啊啊啊啊！！！一上来就感觉这家伙很有黑道气息，结果真的有一段和黑道有关的过去，不过故事线又酸又甜非常戳我（不小心暴露了自己肉食女子的本质）

下一位是秀彰，跟安良城一起成为了酒吧的相声组合，如果这不是乙女游戏我甚至想推二位的cp了，但是不可以因为我们要三人行（什么？？？！）秀彰的可爱之处在于他全身上下哪里都可爱，看起来热情开朗，但其实很容易脸红，怕黑、有童年阴影的拼命三郎警督人设实在是太萌了好不好！整个玩下来令人十分心疼，但是又十分想欺负！！！（你够了啊喂！）

再下一位是汤赖，内衣品牌的社长，非霸总人设，有女性恐惧症，总体来说十分矜持害羞，因此推倒的过程也是湿织更主动，个人感觉这条线比较中规中矩，是一条男女主之间没有太大误会和冲突的线。

最后一位是法幢，我个人认为是最虐的一条线，这个人吊人胃口真的很有一套，一直到最后的最后才确认心意，那个恋爱游戏看的我实在心碎，很希望能有机会从法幢的视角来看一看这个游戏的过程，只虐湿织一个人太不公平了！！！最后说一句，如果是我自己攻略法幢，可能到一半就放弃转而投向安良城和秀彰的怀抱了hhhh~

If you can snap this up for the current sales price of $6.29 USD it's a steal. I only completed the Soichiro route so far, and I'm getting through Ryunosuke, but it's nice to see a otome with older men for a change. The writing is better than My Secret Pets was, and the mc can stand up for herself, at least on the routes I've played.

I'm honestly not sure why so many people insisted on buying it only to harsh on it. If you don't like older guys, don't read it. The mc is certainly old enough to drink in a bar and hold down an office job, so she's old enough to know what kind of guys she wants to date.

UPDATE: AS I finish the story routes, I'll give brief recap here:

Toyoizumi Soichiro: The owner of the pub, and probably the kindest man in the otome. He's reluctant to commit his heart, but once he does, it will be forever. He's romantic and old-fashioned, and although there is passion in him, it doesn't appear in his route right away. I liked Soichiro the best, as he treated the main character like a lady and behaved like a proper gentleman, well, for the most part.

Yuze Ryunosuke: His route can have a rather wonderful ending, but our poor leading lady will put up with a lot to get there. Yuze can be kind of a jerk at times, tender and loving at others. Though he will be the first to defend the mc if it isn't his route, so it's clear he does respect women, and he does treat her decently. His attitude towards women makes sense given his past, but he can seem cold and aloof at times.

Hodo Yorihisa: I honestly wondered if he truly loved the mc at all at some points. He tricks her into dating him, which admittedly isn't too hard once she finds out who he is, then uses a prize to get her to stay in the relationship. In the end he really does love her, and given his backstory his actions, though a bit cruel, are understandable. He at least tries to level the playfield a bit at times, so there is kindness in him.",1594265133,1595825464,True,1,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, I explain why I feel that way. I'll put a tl;dr at the end with pros and cons.

When I first saw this game, I was happy to see something with older characters. Most otome's/dating sims/visual novels have high school or college age people getting together. 
While I still like the concept of the guys being middle aged, they should've been a decade or two younger... I'm not sure most of these guys are 'middle aged' anymore.
In Japan, this might be an acceptable thing, but in many countries it's frowned upon for there to be THIS much of an age difference unless the old guy is rich and keeping the younger woman in luxury (read: sugar daddy).

The protagonist is clearly in her early- to mid-20's. She's so naive, I'd lean more towards early 20's (if not flat out 18 or 19). For the purposes of my review, I'm assuming she's 20.
Fine, whatever, dating sims are aimed towards women and many are that age. 
However, these guys are old enough to be her father or grandfather. The youngest guy is 41, and the two oldest don't even have their ages mentioned. She really should be around 30 for this to be cute instead of pedophilic. Is this a dating sim or a lolita sim?

I'll admit to being charmed by two of the routes, which happened to be the second youngest and one that seems to be the oldest though his age isn't specified, but it's not worth the price for two enjoyable routes.
I was bored in most of them. It's definitely a Slice-of-Life sort of game, but it doesn't do it particularly well, and I'm a fan of Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons.

Your character hates her job and has no personality until she meets the guys (can't even call them 'boys' at this point), then her personality changes based on what they want. 
The emphasis is largely on making the guys like you, which isn't uncommon in this type of game, but I wonder why a woman so young would be charmed by men her father's age (daddy issues perhaps?) 
I also see no reason the men should be interested in her, besides the fact that she's young and cute. 

It doesn't go in-depth into the men's backgrounds or why they are the way they are, and when they do mention it, it's like a short, dissatisfying explanation that just blankets over their issues.
Every route has its own conflict that the 'couple' struggles with for most of the route, and most of them are resolved in a way that makes sense, however one of the guy's conflict is resolved way too quickly, especially due to the type of conflict it is.

TL;DR
Pros:
It's different

Cons:
Age difference is huge
Characters are too generic
Protagonist has no personality
Protagonist too young
Most routes are boring
Feels like pedophilia at times.",1583777205,1583777205,False,5,0,0.484036892652511597,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Finger weg von diesem Spiel! Ich trinke nicht, hatte aber nach relativ kurzer Spielzeit den unwiederstehlichen  Gusto auf den einen oder anderen Cocktail - und das ist kein Witz.

Die zweite Warnung geht an sehr junge Spieler/innen.
Spart euch das Geld, das Game wird euch nicht gefallen. Wer hängt schon im echten Leben blutjung mit älteren Männern herum, wenn nicht rein finanzielle Interessen dahinter stehen?
Ich habe im Leben noch keinen Fall erlebt.

Dritte Warnung. 
Vermeidet es möglichst, während sich die Geschichte entwickelt, auf die wirklich grauenhafte Grafik zu sehen. Sie ist wie ein Verkehrsunfall. Schrecklich anzusehen, und trotzdem guckt man immer wieder hin.
Also lasst es lieber!
Schaltet statt dessen lieber euer Kopfkino ein, und stellt euch z.B. einen Schauspieler vor, der im Alter der männlichen Protagonisten des Spiels ist. Also zwischen 40 und 50.

Es schüttelt dich bei der Vorstellung vor SO ALTEN Männerm?
Na dann schau dir z.B. einen Patrick Dempsey, er ist über 45 und echt heiss.
Oder ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, Bradley Cooper, Gerard Butler usw...
Alles keine grünen Jungs mehr, aber heiss wie die Hölle.
Denk also an solche Typen, und vergiss die potthässlichen Grafiken.

Und nun endlich zum Spiel?
Jein - mir persönlich gefiel die musikalische Untermalung gar nicht. Nicht mein Geschmack.
Also habe ich die Musik im Spiel abgedreht, und statt dessen auf YouTube nach Musik gesucht, die ich gerne in einer Bar hören würde. Es gibt da echt tolle Aufnahmen. Zum Beispiel Piano-Musik von einer Stunde und mehr. Passt (für mich) perfekt.

Und jetzt zum Spiel ... endlich wird der ermüdete Leser seufzen.
Halt durch, es lohnt sich.

Man kann der weiblichen Hauptfigut einen persönlichen Namen geben.
Finde ich gut, zieht mich ein bischen mehr in die Geschichte hinein.

Frau ist am Heimweg von einem Job als Sekretärin der sie nervt und ermüdet, und landet auf der Suche nach etwas Ablenkung in der Bar Audire. 
Dort trifft sie auf vier Männer und den Besitzer der Bar, die über den weiblichen Gast mehr als erfreut sind. 
Soweit die Vorgeschichte. Ab da lernt man dann in jedem Kapitel das aus acht Teilen besteht die Männer einzeln näher kennen.

Das Männer über vierzig eine interessante Lebengeschichte haben (können) ist klar. Diese vier und der Barbesitzer haben interessante Geschichten, die von der weiblichen Hauptfigur erforscht werden. Je nachdem wie man Entscheidungen trifft, endet es mit einem guten oder sehr guten Ende. Völliges Verlieren gibt es nicht.

Ein bischen Fingerspitzengefühl und eigene Lebenserfahrung sind beim Lösen der fünf Fälle hilfreich.
Ich persönlich habe in meinem Leben schon den einen oder anderen Typ aus dem Audire kennen gelernt, und kann bestätigen das es keine hanebüchenen Erfindungen sind, die beschrieben werden. Leben eben, mit seinen Sonnen- und Schatten Seiten. Im Game mehr die Schatten Seiten, denn die Männer sitzen nicht ohne Grund jede Nacht in der bar und knallen sich die Birne mehr oder weniger zu.

Negativ bewerte ich die relativ wenigen Entscheidungen die man treffen kann,
und das manche Entscheidung im Spiel abgeschwächt oder uminterpretiert wird. Das sind Fußangeln die unnötig sind.

Negativ sollte ich auch das Benehmen der weiblichen Hauptfigur in manchen Situationen bewerten. Bin damit allerdings vorsichtig, das es wohl der japanischen Vorstellung von weiblich entspricht, wenn Frau schnell errötet, verlegen den Kopf senkt, oder in Tränen ausbricht. Das akzeptiere ich einfach mal so.

Wenig gefallen hat mir die Geschichte mit dem Barbesitzer Soichiro. Bei ihm hat mir mein Kopfkino nicht geholfen, obwohl ich für meine Fantasie eigentlich Vergnügungssteuer bezahlen müsste.
Der Typ ist (für mich) langweilig und betont zu oft, das er der Älteste ist. Auch wenn ich einen Sean Connery im fortgeschrittenen Alter für hot hielt, Soichiro konnte er nicht ausblenden. Seine Geschichte habe ich bischer nicht beendet. Ob ich mich dazu noch aufraffe? Vielleicht nach drei bis vier Kirschlikör ...

Ob ich das Spiel empfehle?
Ja - ausser für trockene Alkoholiker, oder allgemein Menschen mit einem Alkohol Problem.
Ich habe keines. 
Also werde ich mich jetzt wieder in die angenehme Atmosphäre von Audire begeben
und meinen Favoriten Manoru treffen. Das einem Bad Boys aber auch immer so anziehen müssen Ts-ts-ts.
Einen Cocktail habe ich nicht zur hand, aber ein Gläschen Kirschlikör (passend zu Japans Liebe zu Kirschenblüten) tut´s ja auch. Cheers und viel Vergnügen!",1574887886,1575052110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, I get MC is the loving and supporting MC, but it's depressing to read; every time something go's wrong on her job, she go's to the bar. Not trying to really work on herself or maybe try something else to be better.

The game is clear not for young (or immature) audience. 16+ at least i belief. There will be some darker themes in the story. As life was not kind to your men. But again, for me personally, need more work on that part and effect of it on the characters. 

To me the game was simply not interesting , more boring if i'm honest. The bland MC and characters just didn't make it interesting enough. Really, Ryunoske route, was painful for me to finish, MC and Ryu where too bland. I really was thinking lot of the time; 'what does she/he see in the other?'; because really what is there to love with such a shallow connection/relationship? I do say that Mamoru makes it lots better with his story.

At least the art is good. Clear and nice enough to look at. The music was plus. Really like that music sound.

I started Yorihisa and Mamoru's routes but couldn't finish them. Yorihisa is full of himself and manipulative and the MC is a gullible stuttering shy mess. I stopped early in Mamoru's route. He is an obvious flirt but actually seemed like a good guy in the other guys routes and has really helped them out and was a good friend... aaand then he's pawing all over you the day after you first met and barely spoke to him, gets you drunk, says he's falling in love with you and sleeps over in your bed uninvited when you black out, teases you about messing with you while you were blacked out.. and I stopped playing his route. Eugh... 
The romance scenes are mostly awkwardly written with one CG per route (best one is probably in Ruynosuke's route), it is one of those stories where the MC is pursued by everyone for no apparent reason, and there is a lot of waxing poetically/sappy internal monologuing at times. I mostly laughed at the corny or silly writing and not because it was actually funny. It can be hard to follow who is saying what at times. Probably best to buy on sale. It is ok just don't take it too seriously and avoid those two routes.

Suggested Route order:
Avoid Yorihisa (smug SOB with a green shirt) and avoid Mamoru (Red haired boorish frat creep)

1. Ryunosuke (glasses and suit) - typical kind of route but pleasant with some serious subject matter but it isn't really addressed. The guy is nice and actually a bit shy which can be refreshing.
2. Hideaki (eyebrow scar) - pretty serious subject matter that is very focused on and MC is tearful a lot but they have a pretty good connection even if it is really fast to develope.
3. Shoichiro (older bar tender) - slow burn relationship that is almost too slow at points but thought out at the same time and the most enjoyable I think. The most normal really and nice to leave off on a good note.

However, each of the characters has their own story line which is pretty good, I did enjoy the background story but I think It's bit too fast to have a relationship and the sexual scenes, it's really straight forward to the point of this game, but I guess this is what otome games suppose to be like or I could be wrong Idk? The illustration of the characters is good but maybe it's a good idea to have a few more background for different scenes rather than having the same ones for all the characters?

I want to start my review by saying that if you go into this game comparing it to big titles like Amnesia, or Hakuouki then you are going to be disappointed. This VN ceratinly would fall into more of what I would expect that you would see on a mobile phone. ( Reminds me of the Shall We Date? series ). The routes are only going to run you about 1 hour to an 1 hour and a half max, and the places you go/elements of the story are certainly more limited in comparison to some other VN's but for this particular title I really think that it just works.

Pub Encounter is a more mature take on a VN, especially when it comes to a VN that is marketed towards female audiences, and this fact alone is one of the reasons that this seemingly more like a mobile VN has become one of my all time favorite VN's. 
The suitors in this game are a bit older ( I believe ranging from 30's up? ) and the issues that the game deals with can be much darker or 'realistic' if you will than other VN's. This may turn some users away, but if you are tired of romancing the same type of immature characters in VN's this will be a breath of fresh air for you. 

The stories I have gone through in the game so far are very emotional, and as I said contain some darker story elements than some other VN's. This game feels a lot more realistic in that regard, and for some that may take away the appeal of the VN. However, for me I really truly loved that aspect about this game. Hideaki's route was really emotional for me, and for that route alone I would reccomend this game.

Compared to the other Dogenzaka Lab games I have played, this one, in my opinion is the least cancer! This one is still VERY cheesy and cringe but their other ones are just AWFUL! I want to say that I recommend playing them to get your own opinion on them, but be warned. They are really bad.

[u]Summary:[/u] You are walking home one evening from your job(which you are apparently incompetent at), and find your way into the Audire, the lovely little Pub hidden away in an alley way.

🌸 All of these potential lovers are over the age of 40. 
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀Hey, kink-shame all you want internet, but if you are all about that daddy
⠀⠀demographic, then you may enjoy at least one of these lovely lads. They all
⠀⠀have pretty solid and established careers and enjoy giving you attention. Who's
⠀⠀gonna say no to that? :^)

🌸 Music is not very annoying & each men feels different.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀I'm a sucker for the piano so I have nothing to complain about here. It's very fitting
⠀⠀⠀to the nice, snazzy atmosphere of the pub. Each guy's story comes with their own
⠀⠀⠀history and problems, and they aren't similar to one another which is nice. They will
⠀⠀⠀even say things differently to you. No copy-paste laziness.

🌸 The men are, more or less, VERY well behaved compared to DL`s other VNs.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀After playing My Butler and Office Lovers, I must stress on how much BETTER 
⠀⠀⠀these men are compared to those games! Most kept their hands at bay or at least
⠀⠀⠀weren't outright overly touchy. Maybe too frank with their dialogue, but at least you
⠀⠀⠀aren't getting molested within the first 5 minutes of meeting them.

💔 I enjoy older men, not old men! [i]/cough/ soichiro /cough[/i]
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Playing through his storyline made me cringe and uncomfortable, but who am I
⠀⠀⠀to shame those who enjoy raisins. I am not one of them. He was the most gentleman-
⠀⠀⠀like out of them all, but I can't get over how [i]old[/i] he is.

💔 The art style is nice, however some instances make them really awkward and gross.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀If you have played any other game by them, you will notice each game comes
⠀⠀⠀ with a different art style. The art in this can be very nice, however a lot of scenes
⠀⠀⠀just look soooo awkward and very bad. No offense to the artist who made 
⠀⠀⠀these lovely men, but some features could have been made differently. 
⠀⠀⠀In my opinion, at least.

I would recommend this game only if you are a fan of these types of games. The stories can be super cheesy, lame, and honestly really weird from time to time. Some of the things they say can be very sweet or over the top, and sometimes things go from 0 to 100 really fast! It`s not necessarily a bad thing, but I live for those wacky moments!

[b]Type of Game: [/b] Visual Novel – Reading & Choices
[b]Length: [/b] about 8h  
[b]Story: [/b] 5/10 (if you do not take it seriously) 
[b]Art: [/b] 6/10

Okay, so let's start with why I bought this game: I was reading a book about a relationship, where the girl and the guy have a huge age gap. The book was kind of weird (not because of the relationship per se; some parts of it were just wrong), but since it was told in the perspective of the older guy, it was never really explained, why he had fallen in love with the girl to begin with or what the girl thought about it. That’s why I became curious about a game, which basically screamed at its players that it’s about a girl, who likes older men.  

Therefore, I thought ""Well, I know Dogenzaka Lab. I know that their translations are most of the time something to laugh at rather than to take serious (e.g The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya), but maybe I can find something in this game that counts as an explanation or idea, what the girl is thinking, when she gets into such a relationship."" 

Long story short, I didn't find anything besides a bad translation, clichés and a lot of questionable behaviour. However, at least, I had quite a nice time reading this novel because at some point I took nothing quite serious (and ignored the fact that the age gap is hilariously huge).

Nevertheless, let’s start at the beginning. You’re a cute girl in her 20's, who has a lousy boss and is in need of a drink. Therefore, you go into a ""totally-not-suspicious"" bar and have a drink with some men. These men are at least two times older than you (the youngest is 43) and everyone has fallen for you at first sight. ""Not creepy at all"", seems to think the heroine because she stays with them (having a good time apparently) and after that even comes back to the same bar on the next day. Normal behaviour, I guess.

Well, I'm a tough person, I won't be disgusted easily (even, if someone, who may be as old as my grand-dad flirts with the main character), so let's just skip to the things, which made even me think that this game went seriously too far.

Firstly, I am truly fascinated that there is none route [spoiler] besides the sequel of Hideaki's [/spoiler], which mentions the age gap as being somewhat strange, at least. 

Another great thing is that the developers didn't think it would be a wise choice to make the main characters at least a bit mature. I mean, they are guys in their 40's or 50's and act like they are the same age as the heroine. Seriously, why make a game about older men, if the older men are acting like 20-, maybe 25-years old guys? What's the point of that?! 

So that you know, what I am talking about, I am going to make a short introduction of every one of the characters the heroine can romanticize.

Ryunosuke:
Personally, I think this is the route, where I can at least understand the age gap. First of all [spoiler] he is the CEO of her favourite company, so they have a lot of common interests [/spoiler]. Then he is really shy and mysterious to her: She wants to help him and to know him better. She hasn't a lot of experience, so of course he seems amazing. Also, he acts really young [spoiler] because he is traumatized. Therefore, his personality doesn’t feel forced. [/spoiler]

Mamoru:
He, actually, is a great example of what I’ve said before. He acts like a kid, a teenager, who is trying to seduce as many girls as possible – a cheeky brat. [spoiler] Does he have a traumatic cliché past? Yes, of course. [/spoiler]. However, that’s not going to work out, if the guy we are talking about is 46-years old. Honestly, it’s not even about the age gap anymore, he is just sometimes plainly creepy [spoiler] because e.g. he tries to get the main character drunk and then takes her back to her home, with a clear intention… of doing nothing (yay). [/spoiler] Nevertheless, I can’t agree with some people, who told that his route was the worst. There were other routes, where I’d call the police. 

Hideaki:
I said Mamoru was mentally about 20 years old, so, if we consider that, Hideaki has to be about 16-18 years old. [spoiler] He has a traumatic past. Sure thing, but I wonder how they achieved to combine the impossible: A cheerful police officer, who is kind of rough, but at the same time acts like an angsty teen, who can’t get over a traumatic experience, cries a lot and doesn’t have any self-confidence. Quite a paradox. [/spoiler] At least in this route her PARENTS (not she, not him, who weren’t even questioning anything) weren’t okay with their relationship because of the age gap. Thank you. Someone finally noticed it. 

Yorihisa:
Here I started to feel slightly concerned [spoiler] because this guy is 51[/spoiler]. His route told me that it was right to feel so. I think he was crossing the line of what’s acceptable in more than one way. [spoiler]Let’s see: Firstly, he kind of sexually harasses the main character by forcing her to sit on his lap. Plus, the deal. The deal, which would be A REALLY GOOD idea, if this guy WASN’T AN OLD MAN. It's a ‘game’, where the heroine trying to make Yorihisa fall in love with her, while Yorihisa does the same (allowing him to harass her as much as he wants.) in order to make him write a new romance novel because he is, shocking discovery, her favourite author. It gets even better. After being harassed, the main character even starts to like him. And everyone else SUPPORTS IT?! [/spoiler]

Souchiro:
Here I am, by now feeling completely disgusted. Yay! Would you start a romance with your grandfather’s friend? Well, I sure wouldn’t. Our heroine though thinks it’s normal and surprisingly Souchiro does as well. I just can’t find any words to describe this.

I mean, I’m really open-minded, whether you like older guys or not, whether it’s the same gender or not. However, this game is treating it as an every-day occurrence; it doesn’t even try to explain it. It just says: “Oh, Souchiro is so gentle. I’m starting to fall for him.” What about him being as old as your grandparent is (Yorihisa is as old as her father is)? 

Honestly, I would be really disappointed in this game, if I had been hung up on the idea to find out what a girl may think, when she falls in love with people, who are as old as her parents or grandparents.

However, at some point I was just reading it because it was rather hilarious and just so unrealistic that, well, I stopped taking serious, what these people were doing or saying. And then it was pretty much okay to bear.

Nevertheless, some routes were still not okay because it was either just wrong or kind of disgusting. I mean, most of them, would be acceptable, if either the characters were younger, or the story wasn’t centred on their “suffering” and “past”, but instead on the difficulty of building a relationship, while having a huge age gap. It could even have been a really good story.

Apart from that, the writing is bad, the translation is often wrong and sometimes chunks of dialogue repeat in every route. However, I think it’s good that the writing is bad because it really helps to not take this game any serious.

Somehow, I still like some characters and Yorihisa’s story, but if you start looking at the age, everything becomes either creepy or just badly designed. 

In conclusion, I don’t really recommend buying this game, if you want something serious. Something new. Something that isn’t there for just passing time. Something you can think about for hours and contemplate on.

Because this game is just a funny read, if you don’t take anything serious like I did.",1531504648,1676029885,False,5,0,0.535198509693145752,0,True,False,False,False,,,

原本為手機遊戲《Dandy Shot》，後來才移植於Steam平台上。
玩家將扮演一名上班族，某日下班後走進一間名為Audire的酒吧，
認識了店內的店長與常客（全是大叔），與大叔們展開戀情的故事。

【優點】
+Steam版本內建簡體中文字幕
+可攻略的5個角色全是大叔，適合我這種大叔控
+每個角色都有正篇→後話→約會劇本三段劇情
 只有湯瀨龍之介的有額外的續篇劇情跟CG
+每個角色都至少有5張CG，其中一張必為床戲CG
+劇情選擇不難（都是二選一），不必特地看攻略
 《Pub Encounter》的劇情選擇都不難，憑直覺選都會選到Best Ending
 不像其他文字小說戀愛遊戲難到靠北，得看攻略才能選到Best Ending
+有Steam交換卡片可以收集

【缺點】
-似乎沒有Steam雲端儲存進度的功能？
 我之前在A電腦攻略的角色進度跟CG，換了B電腦之後就消失了
-Good Ending比Best Ending還難達成
-遊戲BGM單調，沒認真投入劇情的話，很容易睡著

如果你和我一樣是大叔控，又對文字小說類型的戀愛遊戲有興趣，
那麼我很推薦這款《Pub Encounter》，每個大叔都有自己的煩惱與可愛的一面，
另外玩家扮演的女主角在這款遊戲裡非常大膽主動，常讓大叔們嚇一跳XD

In comparison to those Pub Encounter is almost bland. The different storylines are interesting but of course not breathtaking, I mean it's normal life guys^^. Presentation and GCs are good and the music is...well it's there ;-).

So why do I like this game so much, despite the fact that it is only average in every regard except for the cast of men, to choose from? You maybe guessed it, it's because they're all beyond 40 years old, mature gentlemen so to say but don't take the gentlemen thing too serious. One reviewer here complained about the guys acting like some lovecrazy teenagers but that's actually exactly like reality is, age doesn't make a difference here...I think I should know, I have a thing for older men, so of course I dated some and there really is no big difference xD.

I wished though, that the stories would have focused a little more on the age gap promlematic but it's okay.

In my opinion this game is a must have if you're into the ""Ossan"" stuff ;-).

He's hot no doubt but I really disliked the chemistry between the MC and Mamoru, along with the overal behaviour of the MC (but that could count as a negative in probably every route).

2. Yorihisa
Very manipulating but somehow interesting to see the MC fall for him. He also has some charme but that's it.

3. Ryunosuke
One of the two routes with the most normal dating activities, the MC is the more avtive part here, I liked that. The rest of the story is okay.

4. Hideaki
Now, his route was actually a big surprise for me^^. I chose him the last because I liked him the least at first sight. Who would have thought what an interesting and charming character he is behind that silly mask. The background story was very good, too.

5. Soichiro
I guess many will not understand why he's my favourite in the whole game but well...he's just such a sweet old gentleman, who's still on edge, how can one not like that? He may be the oldest of the cast but that makes his route even more interesting in my opinion :3.

So in short: Recommended :-)",1511427106,1511427106,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[*] some awkward English translations
[*] the ability to play in English, Japanese or Chinese
[*] awkwardly written ecchi sketchy sex scenes
[*] morality issues

What I got: Story arcs that were much more interesting and deep than the smut I came for and I came to like this game for different reasons. 

It's a pretty decent VN. I wish they spent a little more time weeding out the typos and made the sex stuff a little less laughably bad but hey. For something I've never seen before, I'm willing to excuse this for something novel. I have seen older men act like horndogs (especially in bars) so that wasn't a shock to me. What was a shock was a lot of the routes end with over the top posessiveness. I've never been one to like that in real relationships but I get the market of these types of games and I just happen to be an outlier.  

Anyway, enough complaints. The shining pinnicle of this game other than the men, are their stories. I like that they weren't just bullshit angsty crap that a lot of highschool type VN's exhibit. You know like, ""Oh man. I was rejected by some chick ONCE and now I can't love again."" This shit is like, ""So I was kidnapped and tortured and I'm basically traumatized forever."" They felt more or less believable with a little bit of coincidence to drive the plot thrown in and I really, truly, loved that they were struggling with real shit.

Routes in order of my favourite to least favourite: 
Soichiro - Ah~ *swoon*
Ryunosuke - I don't get WHY he's the only one with a part 2. But he's all kinds of awesome so I suppose I'll let it slide.
Hideaki - His passed is so fucked up but I related to him the most because mine is too. Not that we went through the same thing but it was nice to have a relatable character.
Mamoru - I thought he was gonna be a slimeball. I was... sort've wrong? I just don't like overly sexual, possessive, slightly controlling men who don't listen to no so... But his route got better the more I played it. 
Yorihisa - Not my type. He's a asshole. Straight up fucking... You don't play with people like that even if you managed to get over yourself enough to actually fall in love.

画风上我个人觉得还不错，很适合中年大叔这样的角色设定，当然这一点还是因人而异。不过看宣传图就觉得画风不好看的也不大可能会考虑买游戏吧。

从剧情上来说，各位大叔真的都非常棒，性格上也有各自的特点和缺陷，暂时只玩完了龙之介和警察大叔两条，但是已经感受到了大叔的魅力！！！这游戏简直是叔控福音！！！为了不剧透就不多说了。但是只能说这部作品里很难见到那些让你觉得很尴尬的狗血情节，恋爱进度可能有些快，但基本不矫情，非常顺畅。
在此感谢作者。

不过游戏的缺点也很明显……
最大的问题就是中文版本的翻译，真的有非常严重灾难，有很多的语法不通和错别字，虽然不影响游戏剧情的阅读，但是很容易就让人情感上出戏。而这个问题也只好期待作者的更新来解决了，如果能找到一位更合适的翻译就更好了_(:зゝ∠)_

A steamy, melodramatic romance game that mixes charming men with cheesy dialog. It's pretty much the otome game equivalent of a dollar-store romance novel.

Pros:

- Attractive and charismatic older male characters
- Gorgeously drawn CGs
-  A unique and somewhat off-beat premise


Cons:

- Almost zero variation: the choices you make affect two lines of dialog at a time, only diverging at the end of the game.
- Infrequent typos and sprite errors
- Repetitive soundtrack
- The overwrought melodrama may be tough for some to stomach.

Fans of ""ossan"" characters will probably find at least one guy they love to death, but for people who aren't really ""into"" older guys, the story's too insubstantial to warrant much attention.",1478379988,1478379988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While routes' plots do vary, from one extremity to another, it really seems kind of unreal. Okay, games are not necessarily supposed to be ""real"" but I expected less dramatic plot twists. They were alright, besides that one route that made me see one of my favorite characters in an utterly different light. (And it's not a good thing.)

The art is... Okay. Obviously, they look older and I don't mind that, but... It's definitely only okay. I mean, one of the characters is 60, but he looks over 70... That's a bit too much for me. And backgrounds are a little fuzzy.

Now, the characters. Out of five romanceable guys, only one is romanceable (and a little squee-worthy because he is sweet). One is way too old (looking) and two of them are horribly manipulative. The fifth was just... okay. And some of them were quite childish for 40+ years old men...

There definitely were typos, some even hilarious. Like the MC apparently puts their own body in a bag... But I'm not a native English speaker, so I don't necessarily notice everything, so it didn't bother me that much.

My conclusion is... Save your money. A few good bonus stories isn't enough to make for 4 routes that are either horrible, unremarkable or boring. At least, not from my point of view.",1475123855,1475123855,False,12,0,0.660175561904907227,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's hard to find a classy bar, ya know? Esp one filled with sexy ojisans. :-P

Bought solely for Ryu's story but I will probably try the other ones at some point too. Though truthfully the way the other men (e.g. not Ryu) are drawn, it looks like they're either crack addicts with weird sunken in eyes, or just old grandpas. @__@; I can probably get past that part and enjoy the stories even if some of them are hopelessly predictable. 

So far the only exposure I have had to the protagonist is thru Ryu's story, and she seems more dom than most Japanese generic female MCs. So I am hoping she doesn't act like a 'tard in the other routes, though after reading some of the other reviews that cite other routes, I am starting to lose hope, LOL.

Anyway, so glad this game (and similar ones by the same dev group) are on Steam now because previously I had tried to play these on my phone and it was sooo annoying cause of all the adverts!! So yay!! :D I hope they make more 'niche' otome games like this where you can woo older men. 'Cause some of us perverts are into that. xD

Bonus points that the screenshot feature actually works in this game and that there are acheivements, yay!

Also another thing worth noting - unlike the vast majority of other otome games/dating sim games out there, you must pick a guy's path up front. It's not one big free-for-all which to me, kinda makes the concept lose its allure just a tad. But not a dealbreaker for me. I like the 'freedom to choose' concept...and the idea you could end up falling for another guy instead of the one you originally set out to get is thrilling to me...er...or something. LOL.

As a middle-aged lady who loves otome, I was tickled by the prospect of finally having romance options that are close my own age. I was so looking forward to a mature, interesting story that didn't revolve around school. However, Pub Encounters turned out to be a disappointment.

My biggest gripe is the main character. She is just so incredibly, annoyingly, frustratingly STUPID. I've managed to make it through two routes, and in both she is hopeless. She cries at everything. She's sad, she cries. She's happy, she cries. Someone scuffs a shoe, she cries. The sky is blue, she cries. She puts herself in ridiculous and dangerous situtions and then just sort of bumbles along with the consequences. She's bland, uninspired and downright forgettable.

Plus, the two routes I managed to slog through were boring. I knew coming in that this was a slice of life game. I knew not to expect adventures, like I had in Code:Realize. But, geez louise. All the stories really consisted of were the main character looking longingly into the distance while the men made thinly veiled, sexual comments and undressed her with their eyes. There was nothing to these stories, at all. NOTHING.

I simply cannot let the horrors of Pub Encounter go unannounced.  This review will be less formal than most, as the emotions boiling within me are too strong to temper with pretty words and structured paragraphs, so I apologize in advance.  I also apologize to anyone who has played this and absolutely loved it.  Save yourself the anger over what I’m about to say and scroll past the following paragraphs right to the “thumbs down” button as I am sure you will feel obliged to do.  But let it be known that I begrudge no one their pleasures. I have some rather odd fetishes myself, but Pub Encounter is well beyond what I would consider enjoyable in any way.  If there’s one word I would use to describe how I feel about it, it would be disgusted…and dirty.  Ok, so two words.

I’ve always found the idea of romancing older characters in otome games intriguing.  This is ground that is rarely tread upon, and to finally see a title that unabashedly embraces the premise was exciting beyond belief.  I just knew I had to play Pub Encounter as the potential for interesting and unconventional storytelling was evident.  If only I hadn’t been blinded by my enthusiasm, perhaps I would have been prepared for what I was about to face.  Truthfully, even the game title was a huge red flag that I ignored in my starry-eyed daze.

Pub Encounter begins with our stressed out protagonist stopping at a bar after work for a drink and to put another day of mistakes behind her.  Walking into the dimly-lit establishment, she is faced with 5 middle-aged men, 3 of which instantly begin drooling over her as if she were the fresh kill that the pack leader just drug in.  I’m no expert on human interaction, but I’m pretty sure men in their 40’s and 50’s do not act anything like the characters in this game.  Even pubescent teenage boys do not act anywhere near as creepy as these men.  If this were me, after being nearly accosted by the lawyer and writer of the group, I’d have quickly drained my glass and left, never to return.  But our young and “intelligent” protagonist decides to make her way back to the bar yet again as one of the potential sex offenders has lingered on her mind ever since.

Aside from the fact that the novel was clearly written for the sole purpose of having the MC sleep with her chosen beau as many times as can be squeezed into a story that is only 8 chapters long (9 if you count the ending), the writing is absolutely atrocious.  To be fair, the translation itself is pretty good with few typos and awkward phrasings; but the things these characters say, how they act and carry themselves, and the lack of intriguing (not to mention plausible) back stories for any of the leads makes reading through the drudge a painful chore.  My brain began shutting down after finishing the second of the five routes, and as I started up Mr. Cop’s storyline, I felt sweat beading on my forehead as I faced another 3+ hours of mind-numbing boredom.  There is no substance present at all, and the characters are so poorly conceived that I could not find within me any semblance of interest in experiencing how their stories resolved.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682369947 
This is to say nothing of the protagonist who is the most frustrating and stupid character I’ve ever had the displeasure of playing.  She constantly places herself in situations that in real life would have had her dead on the side of the road somewhere. Then there’s the fact that she trusts and falls for these men without knowing ANYTHING about them except that they want her so bad they can’t take it.    

Which leads me to Pub Encounter completely squandering its potential for romance with older characters. I realize some of the effect may be lost in translation as the MC may be speaking more formally to them in Japanese, but the stories themselves barely emphasize the age difference at all. It's just the MC getting all hot for one of the guys, some ridiculous back story, and then 3+ chapters of them screwing each other's brains out. And the sex scenes aren't even appealing or titillating, they’re embarrassingly awkward and stupid.  At one point I questioned whether the writer even understands how the human body works.   

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681366354
I realize that R18 otome titles are rare, and that many female readers are desperate for anything they can get their hands on, but we need to demand better.  If this is what passes for mature storytelling, I'll pass.  I'll take a well-written, yet chaste, love story over this tripe any day of the week. The allure of the chase, blossoming relationship and eventual confession of love is lost when the MC has already fallen head over heels for her beau and sleeps with him by Chapter 3.  Though perhaps it was my mistake expecting anything more of Pub Encounter than the trashy erotica that it is.

Bottom Line: Strongly Not Recommended!

While they make fair points, what I can say is your first mistake is walking in here expecting an A-grade VN. It is FAR from it. This is firmly in the category of B-grade or even C-grade romance VNs usually found on mobile. You know, the kind you secretly play and then get embarrassed if anyone so much as mentions that they found it on your phone so now you must burn all evidence, change your name, and move to a different country. While you do get a bit of content at full price, I failed to mention in my original review that I would recommend this only when on sale. Keep your expectations low and don't spend too much money on it, and everything will be fine. If you dislike the concept of dating older men, you will hate this game with a passion. If you have any  negative feelings about the game but just playing to check it out, do NOT start with Mamoru.)

This visual novel is definitely for more mature audiences. Would only recommend if you are 16+. Partly because there are plenty of steamy scenes, and also to ensure you understand that these stories are not a handbook for real life, healthy relationships. There are a couple of characters that heavily manipulate the protagonist in their relationship, and she's more than happy to be used. Don't learn from that!

The whole premise is to explore a relationship between a young adult female and a middle-aged man that she meets at a pub. It reads very much like a normal novel instead of an interactive story, sometimes you get to see the story from the perspective of both the protagonist and the other characters. The choices you  make affect your 'likeability', deciding if you get the Good or Best ending (both are worth reading). 

The protagonist has a very distinct personality and often has internal monologues, so you pretty much feel like you're reading about someone else's story  or a printed novel instead of being in control of the game. Her personality differs slightly for each character's route. In general, she is easily manipulated, submissive, blushes easily, hyper sensitive to touch and intimacy, and acts like a high-school virgin even though she is in her mid-20s. It's a little disturbing how these older men keep calling her adorable and making a big fuss about how her cuteness makes her attractive. Also disturbing is how the protagonist keeps choosing to drown her work sorrows in alcohol when maybe she should just find a new job and a healthier source of self-esteem.

That aside, the stories are emotional and dramatic. All of the stories are interesting in their own way, however not all of the routes focus on exploring the age gap factor. The characters have strong personalities and at the end of the day, you will feel like you know them very well. One nice touch that makes the experience more immersive is that the characters change their pose or expressions with each dialogue box, so it feels as if they are really reacting to the conversation with you.

I've played all of the main routes so here's a quick guide to the different characters.

- Ryunosuke: The most decent guy of the lot. Formal until you get to know him better. Status gap doesn't seem to be an issue, although it should be. Story feels like two young adults going out together on normal dates. One of the routes where the protagonist isn't a submissive doormat.

- Mamoru: Very forward and flirty. Can't keep his hands to himself. Has the steamiest route, half the time you guys are getting it on. Story depth is disappointing considering the setting, he could be placed in any other game and would fit right in. Protagonist makes me want to punch my screen. She's easily manipulated, submissive, and controlled. This route makes for quick and dirty entertainment, I guess. 

- Hideaki: Really friendly and outgoing guy that doesn't act his age but is very concious of the age gap. The only one with an ordinary job and status. This is the closest you can get to a typical office guy. Very emotional story. Protagonist is stronger in this route and goes through a lot of tough moments to support him.

- Soichiro: The pub owner and the oldest. Possibly 60 or 70 even? Very gentlemanly with a few tricks up his sleeve. Despite being attracted to the protagonist, he suspects that she has misguided affection (or puppy love) for him, which makes him hesitant to return any advances. The story largely focuses on the emotional bonding between them.

- Yorihisa: Seems like the thoughtful, intelligent type but he's even more manipulative than Mamoru. He tricks the protagonist into entering into a relationship with him then plays with her feelings througout. He totally takes advantage of the fact that she's a desperate fangirl to get what he wants.",1462208983,1499187978,True,131,14,0.91590803861618042,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Старики-разбойники[/h1] 

Уставшая героиня вечером после работы забредает в какой-то бар, где её тепло и весело встречают местные завсегдатаи и один седой бармен. Девушке отсыпают щедрую горсть комплементов, с ней всячески заигрывают и вообще дяденьки очень рады женской компании. Мужички взрослые и красивые: забавно, но если убрать нарисованные на лицах и руках морщины, то выглядят они очень молодо, а уж какие у них тела… Никаких пивных животиков, обвисших мышц или кощеевой худобы. Все равны как на подбор - с невероятными прокаченными телами. 

Для свиданий доступно пять персонажей. На каждого приходится по 8 глав основного сценария, сценария-свидания и эпилога. Кроме того, есть второй сезон, состоящий из 7 глав. Пока он доступен только у очкарика Рюноскэ (и второй сезон интереснее). Помимо этого в основном меню можно найти небольшие и забавные дополнительные истории для трёх персонажей. Достижения за них не дают, но они поднимают настроение после прохождения основных сценариев. 

[h1]Разбор полётов[/h1]

Тем, кто решится на покупку данной игры в Стиме, очень повезёт, потому что вы приобретаете уже все доступные главы и вышедшие сценарии. На мобильных устройствах всё покупается отдельно, и обходится это удовольствие гораздо дороже. Не удивляйтесь, если периодически во время прохождения какие-то фразы будут дублироваться (слово в слово или перефразированием) - это ""склейка"" ранее разбитых частей в каждой главе.

Английская локализация просто ужасна. Постоянные ошибки отвлекают от чтения. Такое чувство, что текст печатался на слух: вместо know - no, вместо feet - feed, вместо take - talk. Спутаны личные местоимения, отсутствуют предлоги и частицы. Некоторые слова продублированы, другие пропущены, порядок слов в некоторых предложениях нарушен. Не удивляйтесь надписи Dandy Shot во время загрузки новой главы или сценария - это оригинальное название игры.

[h1]Пойдём ко мне, я тебе барбарисок насыплю…[/h1]

Все разговоры героев сводятся к трём темам: выпивка, секс и проблемы на работе/в личной жизни. Временами героиня неимоверно раздражает, потому что часто плачет. Иногда с ней плачут её мужчины и даже второстепенные персонажи.

А ещё героиня постоянно хочет секса. И с завидной регулярностью зовёт мужчин к себе домой. При этом эта бесстыдница жутко стесняется, и даже когда дело доходит до постели, она продолжает краснеть и заикаться, но при этом отчаянно просит заняться с ней любовью. Очень странное поведение очень скромной японской девушки.

[h1]Санта-Барбара[/h1]

Игра напоминает мыльную оперу. Герои ходят в бар, к героине домой, в кафе или погулять в парк. Разговоры повторяются. Часто можно услышать одни и те же фразы. Герои (хоть и взрослые) временами ведут себя как дураки, а некоторые ещё и некрасиво поступают. 

Из положительных моментов - это музыка, которой здесь очень мало, но она не раздражает и хорошо вписывается в происходящее. Ещё один приятный момент - взгляд с его стороны, возможность послушать о чём говорят мужчины, пока героиня спит/напилась/отошла в туалет. Понравилась мне и тема с алкогольными напитками. Здесь каждый коктейль или выпивка что-то значат, и герои часто таким образом общаются: например, заказал тебе мужичок ""Слёзы Ангела"", это значит ""ты его очаровала"". 

Расстраивает некая недоработанность, халтура в изображении персонажей: все они щеголяют только в двух костюмах (рабочий вид и вид повседневный). Когда дело доходит до постельных сцен, мужички на экране не раздеваются, поэтому возникает некий диссонанс с написанным и увиденным. Рисовка немного странная. Героине периодически забывают рисовать глаза, хотя на некоторых иллюстрациях они есть. Бывает, что глаз нет, зато есть большая ресничка! Некоторые иллюстрации открываются только после прохождения дополнительных сценариев. 

Данный продукт отлично описывается одной фразой - и смех и грех. В прямом смысле. Не шедевр, далеко нет, но если хотите закадрить дедулю - вперёд и с песней, однако будьте готовы к тому, что путь в его постель, а точнее, его путь в вашу постель тернист, долог и временами однообразен.

一开始看评论以为就是纯粹的甜腻肥皂剧，结果发现每个大叔多少都有点心伤或者黑历史。虽然我的洁癖属性很难容忍，但是正因如此代入感很强，对女主的心情相当理解。不得不说其中一个大叔的剧情和我个人经历高度相似，只是我并没有像游戏中那样强行HE，所以那一章哭的一塌糊涂然后气得差点想砸电脑。明明是个觉得略坑爹的游戏，很多对话也有点白开水，但是一部分关键剧情在其他傻白甜对话和各种强行HE的衬托下，反而真实地描写出了中年人的烦恼。尤其是那种年龄差距和年轻女性天生的性吸引力带来的焦虑很真实（美化了一些的真实嗯……）。
虽然说看起来是来搞笑和挑战大众审美的，但实际上编剧好像居然有时候在认真写剧情耶~

口味不重不轻，反正对我这种重口味又泪点低的人来说，在隔靴搔痒的同时反而戳爆很多伤心事引起了一些共鸣。所以这倒霉游戏我是一边嫌弃着质量一边忍不住想戳戳戳看完剧情。

顺便这些剧情里，想到是一群荷尔蒙爆棚的中年大叔对年轻的女主动手动脚我……就一边暗爽一边想报警。或许就是因为他们对待女主好的方式真的很像那些陷入爱河的中年人，可是心里却明白这样的忘年恋根本不会有太好的结果，所以才一边哭着一边玩下去吧。中间很多分手的部分，虽然游戏里只是为了制造剧情冲突，但现实里一般这才是真正的结果。真是只有游戏里才会强行HE的世界呢（只有好结局和完美结局……）

What I like about it the most is the writing. Interesting men and interesting storylines. It's not the typical VN with teenage girls/boys, and that's nice for a change.

With that said, it isn't exactly like The Men of Yoshiwara, so try not to go in expecting that. The biggest difference, at least for me, was the characters. The LIs of Pub Encounter are mature, middle-aged men, as the game frequently reminds you. I didn't see this as a bad thing. In fact, it was refereshing to see a cast of characters in an otome game that were not barely legal, at best. That said, I felt that Pub Encounter plays kind of fast and loose with the term ""middle-aged"". Some of the men I'd put at mid-thirties, where others are quite a bit older than that. Again, not really a bad thing, just a minor complaint. The art style wasn't awful, it just felt unpolished. There was a lot of detail put into making the men's eyes appear older, but some other areas were a bit lacking. I did like the MC a lot, though. She has more personality than many MCs in other otome games and sticks up for herself more. It's nice to see that games are now starting to cater to an audience that wants an independent heroine, not a glorified damsel in distress. The overall plot is decent. I'm not typically into slice of life, but I found the story engaging enough to hold my interest long enough to complete a route and make me curious enough to pursue another. Do be warned, though, there are sexual themes in this game. You don't get any CGs of it, like some other VNs, but there are some very discriptive bits of text that accomplish the same goal. If you are not interested in playing a game where a younger woman enters a romantic/sexual relationship with a man older than she, do not buy this.

Other than that, I do recommend the game. It's got high replayability, the characters are likeable enough, and the plot is decent.",1460618989,1460619042,True,17,0,0.717772960662841797,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The reason may be poor translation, but sadly it's not an excuse.

What am I talking about exactly? 

[b]Sloppy writing. [/b] Very lazy, very unrealistic, dialogues looks so fake, there's absolutely no way someone could read it and be like: ""yeah... That's how people talk to each other in real life!"". This is a visual novel and I stand by my point that visual novels should be based on solid writing. I can survive not-so-good graphic and not-so-good music, but not this.

[b]Characters.[/b] Honestly I bought this game, because I thought that since characters are older than standard otome love interests, maybe the whole game will be more mature. But no. Don't count on that. If not because of art and the fact that they introduce themselves to you and tell you their age, based on their act I could not recognize that they are truly more mature.

[b]Protagonist.[/b]  It's obvious yet still painful. It's a huge sin of great amount of games that are coming out from various studios (usually Asian ones though). I get it - cultural difference. But we can have awesome anime and manga female characters yet in those sort of game, protagonist is almost always the same - weak, with no personality whatsoever, completely submissive, and innocent, and soft-spoken and... No, she's not just ""shy"" as you may think right now. She is literally bland. There's no substance to her and absolutely no way I could find any common ground with this character.

[b]Story[/b] . So yeah, imagine that. Young girl comes to the bar where usually only ""mature men"" are present. Of course she is noticed immediately. She wants the drink so one of characters ask her what's wrong. She says few sentences about job, which are basically dismissed (because come on, we don't want to give protagonist to much lines of dialogue) and then our ""mature men"" start to act all childish like, which I assume is this game version of characters introduction. Well, it's bad. Then after this one night we get to choose which character we want to pursue. And then the girl wakes up, thinking about this one man that stand out sooo much, that she just can't not think about him and need to come back and sit with this ""pleasant"" company, just to have few line of unrealistic dialogue and then few totally random encounters. It's first chapter, those two characters doesn't even know each other yet they feel somehow oblige to explain themselves and act in certain manner as if they were dating already. There's no feel of actual developing a relationship or ""getting to know"" each other. Oh and yeah, various characters ""randomly"" bump into each other all the time. Which is explained by... wait for it... fate. Seems legit!

[b]Music.[/b] Annoying. Turn it off and play your own, this will be more pleasant experience.

This is yet another game brought to you by the people who made ""the Men of Yoshiwara"" who have recently released ""Destiny's Princess"".  The HUD and options menu are exactly the same as these two games, which is nice since it's a simple and well designed one with the option of a skip button. 

Sadly, I don't think they should've rushed to get this out so close to their other release. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but it feels like a seperate part of the company worked on this game and it feels a lot different than the previous two. Don't walk into this expecting bishies and girly romance. It starts with you leaving work after a miserable day and entering a bar full of over-familiar middle aged men and you basically go from there.

The art is a lot different from the other games, especially around the eyes, which I think was a bad choice. I think it was intended to make sure you knew they were older, but it just put me off. It's nice to see them at least experimenting with their art styles. The music is also pretty chill - not as good as Destiny's Princess music, but it's not something you'll mute when you play. 

I think this game was intended for slightly older otome players and not players that just want cute bishies for their 16+ aged protagonist, and I think this can be seen by the fact your character is above the legal drinking age and casually walks into bars when she's feeling rubbish after work (work that she's been at for over a year, might I add). I know this might be off-putting to some players since the romantic interests are older, but bear in mind that the protagonist is older too. Although in my humble opinion, I really don't like the old, white haired bar tender, so I think I'll leave that route to others. 

I romanced Mamoru Arashiro because I'm shallow and he was pretty. The actual content of the game was very impressive - I found the dialogue flowed way smoother in this game than in previous games, and the characters felt a lot more human. It wasn't feudal Japan or formal concubines - it was just some guys chilling out in your local pub, which I really enjoyed because the characters, once again, felt like they were more relatable than they were in ""The men of yoshiwara"" and even more so than they were in ""Destiny's Princess"" which I'd actually complimented for it's character development. This game definitely focuses more on story, plot and characters than it does on art (although I wager the art style in this one took them longer) and I'm still debating whether this is good or bad.

Regardless, it's nice that the company has branched out to different styles and trying different methods - change like this isn't always a bad thing, and I think it's lovely that older players can feel less like kougars romancing barely 20 year old men in every other available game. 

It's also worth a mention that I find this game similar to anime I've read where the protagonist ends up living with an older man - it feels like it has that charm.

Overall, I would say don't walk into this expecting the typical ""Yoshiwara/Destiny's Princess"" formula and setting. Don't buy it if you think dating older men is creepy, because there are no ""younger"" options, you should stick to Yoshiwara etc for that. I would buy this game, since it's on sale and one of the few otome games we as a community have on steam (albeit that is changing rapidly lately), and it's not a bad game at all, I've rather enjoyed it. However, if you're stuck between this game and ""Amnesia: memories"" or ""Destiny's Princess"" etc, I would grab those games instead of this one.
