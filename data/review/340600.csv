Классический пошаговый рогалик в котором мы играя мясником (только 1 персонаж) спускаемся в подземелье и стараемся выжить. Игра простая до жути, но очень увлекательная... Если хотим ачивки и видеть очки то смерть нас ждет окончательная, а если это все не нужно, то можно делать один сейв и к нему возвращаться. Я сделал уже около 100 попыток но так и не добрался до финальных этажей. Даже пишу обзор и хочу сделать еще 1-2 попытки... Очень увлекательно и жаль что такую игрушку не развили. Одобряю и рекомендую.

Gameplay consists of ambling around a procedurally generated map and being hacked up by the various enemies.  RNG is king here. 

With game development, it's important to use the right tools for the job.  Node.js can be used to make video games, that's true, but it's not the best tool for that.  Much like you can eat your dinner with a screwdriver and a hammer.  You could get the food in your mouth, sure, but this is not going to be an enjoyable experience at all.  And the resulting product shows, too.  There's a huge number of defects here, many that spring from the limitations of the poor choice of game engine, and others that spring from poor design choice. 

A choice was made to use obsolete retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.  While there is full screen support, there's no graphics tweaks, resolution is locked and can't be changed, so there's no way for the gamer to try improve the very poor quality visuals. 

I understand that the point of ripping off Rogue/Hack is to create a procgen dungeon bash, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea, or that it was a good idea even at the time.  Hack was successful back in 1980 because there wasn't a lot of competition.  Games don't exist in a vacuum.  While it's intentional, the game features no proper level design or game/story flow/plot, as they opted to try to use samey repetitive procgen algorithms as a substitute for adding such content to the game.  As a result, the game doesn't actually have any content worth mentioning, just endless, boring, repetitive, soulless algorithmically generated sameyness.  Developers must learn that procedural generation is not an acceptable substitute for content.

It's important to consider that, given 42 years of advancement in video game technology, the key differences between The Depths of Tolagal and Hack/Rogue are lazy retro pixel ""art"" instead of ASCII, and shallower, less interesting gameplay.  I can't recommend this.  If you want a good RPG, try Skyrim or Baldurs Gate 3.

ローグライク部分はランダムなマップ、レベルアップ時のタレントぐらいです（設定でパーマデスも可能）。
敵がリスポーンしないため、タレントも３～４つ程度しか取れないと思います。しかもタレントがランダムなので最後まで引きが悪いとヒットポイントすら増えません（ランダムで２～３種類表示される中から選択）。そのため難易度がタレントに左右されてしまうのが残念。

序盤で武器や盾、チャーム（指輪）の使い方をしっかり理解していないとあっという間に死んでいくと思います。回復もチャームがメインで回復ポーションなんかはまずドロップしません。

武器はレアリティがあり、レアリティがあがると武器に特性が多数つくようになります。ダメージに変化はないので強くなった気は一切しません。

中盤辺りから厳しくなっていき、終盤は敵が入れ替えの魔法を使ってきて敵も多数いて集団リンチ状態にしょっちゅうなります（笑）。パーマデスにしていなければゾンビアタックしまくれるのですが、全滅させれるかどうかは運要素が強い気もします。

全体的に面白いと思うもののバランスが悪いかな。せめてレベルアップでヒットポイントを３ずつぐらい上昇させてほしいし、タレントも全体の中から選択できるようにして欲しいところ。

It focuses on small scale tactics and is almost puzzle-like in the way situations need to be handled; while the number of items and character options is small, all of them must be carefully chosen and rationed to get through the brutal encounters. You need to pick your fights carefully and study your opponents to beat them, and the random element ensures things are kept nice and varied.
 It's very well designed, and everything feels considered. My main complaint is that you quickly learn the first couple of levels, so doing them over once you die becomes a chore when you just want to get to the more interesting (and dangerous) deeper floors of the dungeon. Perma-death can be switched off, though, so it's not a huge deal.",1430424585,1430424585,True,4,0,0.527784764766693115,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Because all you'll really do is die constantly (permadeath only if you want your score to be recorded) otherwise it's just constantly loading your saves. And if you save it at the wrong time, might as well start over.

Once you disable the hints, you can never get them back in any game.

You can rebind all keys, but if you rebind the end turn from it's default, it'll never work.

The Backpack only holds 2 items, but you won't really use it because all you do is just find the same items over and over and over.  Only useful items are the mace and bow. In game items: mace, hatchet, iron sword, short bow, ring, exp scroll (very rare), healing potion (very rare). Magic items are very rare, unless you get lucky and get to pick the skill luck, then you'll find some magic items, but they're pretty much the same anyway. Costs 1 action point to recharge at the end of your turn and the bow costs 2. So using magic weapons is pretty pointless considering you only get 3 action points (and one of them will always be your healing ring, that only recharges if you cause damage, but even that won't keep you alive long enough).

My top 5 charaters (actually made it to level 3) were all killed by the orcish something or another, you can beat on it all you want, but you'll mostly miss it as it kills you. Only way to really kill it is if you're lucky to have found some spkied traps and can lead it over them.

If you manage to live long enough you'll get to pick one of 3  random skills. sometimes they're all useless.

Game was fun for a while, but then it just gets repetative.

It's almost more of a turn-based-combat-puzzle generator - like Hoplite with which it was rightly compare in RPS article - than a roguelike. The combat turns are divided in a small number of action points, so it's all about planning and positioning. With fast moving enemies it might mean trying to get as many hits in as possible (and maybe knocking them back or putting a shield up, or hiding behind a door - the options are there, and this is where it differs from Hoplite and puzzle games), while battles with slow enemies are more like a war of attrition... unless you make a mistake and allow yourself to be ambushed by some goblins. 

Each enemy has a gimmick to keep things fresh: trolls can charge at you if you're in a straight line, cultists are invisible, only leaving a trail of smoke behind them, others have shields that they can raise meaning you have to hack through them. There are hardly any popcorn enemies, and you have to be thinking in almost every battle - except the first couple of levels, which are hard to mess up after you've played through them a couple of times, and can become boring in repeated playthroughs. 

The only other criticism I can think of at this point (I've played some more in offline mode, but admittedly not enough yet) is the lack of variety. There are no classes, and so far I've come across a grand total of four different weapons, a shield and a ring of regeneration. Still, the game keeps it fresh by offering different attributes for the items that change the way you use them considerably. Also, there are no character stats and each new level comes with a choice of a passive skill that will also influence the whole run considerably - and there are a lot of them, although you're only given two random ones in each levelup to choose one from. 

The game scratches a similar itch to Hoplite, and it does its thing very well. The combat system is well done, and the permutations of different item/skill combinations keep it from going stale quickly, but still I hope the game grows in variety some more.",1421051760,1421051760,True,12,0,0.596119225025177002,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sure the game is fun enough, and is tough like a roguelike should be, but it is ultimately very unsatisfying when you compare it to the excellent Tales Of Majeyal.  Here are the pros and cons...

Pros:

1.  I enjoyed the games tactical approach to defeating enemies.  The game makes you think when you are in tight spots.
2.  Overall combat is fun.
3.  I thought the music was pretty decent.

Cons:

1.  No classes.  For me this means 0 replayability once the game is completed.
2.  You cannot attack enemies diagonally in melee combat.
3.  When you level up skills/traits are randomly generated.  You could end up having no choice but to chose a skill that is essentially a negative skill.  In my opinion this is a cheap way to make the game more difficult.
4.  The game is too short.  Basically 4 hours to complete the main game.
5.  The price.  I don't mind spending money on a game at all but at this is more expensive than Tales Of Majeyal and has a fraction of the content.

I know that I have mentioned TOME a few times in my review, but I sunk in over 70 hours into that game and have still not completed it yet.  The Depth Of Tolagal is a minor distraction for a few hours, but simply does not have that depth that I am looking for.  

So, if you are looking for a more ""simplistic"" roguelike that you can play for a few hours of fun then I would recommend it...if you want a rich, deep experience look elsewhere.",1420845364,1420849369,False,77,1,0.648801445960998535,4,True,False,False,False,,,

A round of applause for the developers here! They succeeded in creating a tough as nails rougelike that challenges you measure ever step and I do mean EVERY step but (for the most part) only punished the clumsy or the uninformed. I have died several times by virtue of approaching a hallway and accidentally alerting an extra orc or two and promptly getting my teeth kicked in. I have come to realization that the tactical aspect of the game is actually a good bit deeper than rpg aspect of it. Level progression unlocks triats as opposed to a solid stat boost across the board. Many of the traits simply open up intersting opportunties which require you to adjust your playstyle in order to gain an advantage. So overall I would say this game is TACTICAL rougelike more than a classic rougelike rpg.  

The game is starting to feel a little bland (obviously graphically its retro over modern) in terms of variety. Given a good deal of this has been the difficulty that keeps sending me back to the starting stages and the same enemies. Additionally some of the traits (at least early on) are clearly superiour to the others. In a very difficult game that does not hold your hand but allows you progress consistently if you think and learn from your mistakes (for the next time) this a minor balancing issues. They were kind of enough to allow you play through without the permadeath if you buy the game and decide you'll never get through it with only one life (I may eventually give up and fall into this category myself).

I would recommend this game to just about anyone who likes tactical combat games. Fans of the original X-Com series and Desktop Dungeons (one of my all-time favorites) are going to be disappointed they did not hit add to cart sooner. For anyone else I would say it is worth a go if your intersted in the tactical games.

My current feeling (i'm writing this after only about 10 hours to help out people wavering on buying it or not) on this title is that it has definetly been fun but has not quite driven me to the maniac gaming addict level of worship and adolation I usually bestow to games I wind up putting in my top 50. From a value standpoint I would say its definetly worth the money.
