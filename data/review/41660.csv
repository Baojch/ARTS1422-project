TLDR: From graphical issues, render texture issues, control issues and the odd crash on resolution change. Unstable game up against fierce competition.

Review: Game itself is very buggy but I could not see that for myself. After installing Direct Play (ugh) and launching I set resolution to my monitor and the game crashed saying unable to display graphical input. Ever since every time I launch the art is all zoomed in and corrupted and buttons dont show up. The game does not support controllers and even if it did apparently the jump button does not work etc.",1496082230,1509669232,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

Tommy is a simple boy with simple goals, rescue his dog from captivity.  Along the way however he's besieged on all sides by aggressive tomatoes and drunk gnomes.

It's a classic side scroller. The graphics are really crisp and sharp. It can be beaten without tricks. The enemies are varied, as are the weapons. Stages are varied, although more so in the second half of the game. It'd be a game you could let your kid play. The longer you play, the more you'll get used to the controls and enjoy playing.

The bad: 
It's got some bugs. It suffers from a severe lack of polish. Some levels you'll have to restart simply because you used keys on doors that are pointless (trial and error). The controls take a bit to get used to due to a weird jump that has you glide down.

Overall, it's not one I'd recommend, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews indicate. I mean, if you got it for a dollar or two...it's worth it.",1421038771,1421038771,False,3,1,0.561651706695556641,0,True,False,False,False,
