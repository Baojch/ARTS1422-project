From what I saw during this time was, it's a decently made towerdefense with a unique way of handling the different aspects that make a game a towerdefense-styled game.

First impressions weren't great, to say the least, My main reason for this review being negative was also the first flaw i noticed. This flaw being the controls and feel of the gameplay. It felt horrendous, the drawing hand for the bow was pretty much a fists length to the side instead of being where the hand should be. This is also the first VR game where I was annoyed by the crontols (however I only have well made or near tripple-A games in VR so not a super fair comparison). 

The graphics aren't amazing but I didn't really expect much considering that I've never heard of the developer or publisher for the game. Usually I care about graphics however good gameplay can often times make the game not need it. Since the controls weren't good, noor did i really enjoy the game in general. Because it had prectically no direction or tutorial or anything the game was really confusing and the bosses where practically un-beatable. Unless I was doing something wrong, which is totaly possible. It felt like the bosses had way too much HP because they where already at my ""base"" before I had even dealt one fourth of it's HP.

Another thing, simular to graphics, the sound design was, mehh. wasn't horrible but I've heard way better.

I don't want the game to fail I would actually like if the game did well, it's a very cool concept with good potentiall but it's far from polished.

I'll give it a 4/10.

EDIT: as you can see in the comments, which not everyone reads, you can change so there's no offset to the drawing hand, but even then it could feel wierd playing but at that point i think it's just me. It feels like a mix of the game being to fast paced to have those styled controls and I noticed a slight shaky-ness, not sure if it was me or the game but it seemed like the game. That or I just suck.

Considering this I'll bump it up to 6/10. becuase, Yay for customisation.",1544382904,1544640386,False,3,3,0.281988978385925293,2,False,True,False,False,,,

QuiVr Vanguard has the same excellent bow mechanics but feels different to QuiVr as a more challenging variant of the two leading to snappier games. If you're a fan of the original QuiVr you'll most likely love QuiVr Vanguard too. The drop-in multiplayer scales the difficulty the more players in a game.",1542751742,1542751742,True,7,1,0.523619294166564941,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It's back! Original Quivr was pretty much one of the only worthwhile games when Vive first released. No matter what else I decided to do when I put on the headset I knew I could jump into Quivr for a good time, and it held up great over time. I was very sad to see it be replaced by what was really a completely different game. I installed this yesterday, and hell yeah. Original Quivr is back, and better now. All the new art and lessons learned from the original project incorporated makes this even better. If you get any enjoyment whatsoever out of shooting a bow in VR, this is the game to have. Thanks Blueteak for bringing this back!  

The only thing I personally would like to see is better instructions or simple tutorials for how to use the various gear upgrades you get. Even with the diagrams, how to use some things are not obvious.",1542730996,1542730996,True,17,1,0.711018860340118408,0,True,False,False,False,,,
