+ Lots of crazy explosions. There's not a whole lot of skill to it, you just fire grenades in the direction of the enemies and hope they run near them. Great casual fun for everyone.
+ Visually the game looks great
+ Quite a few creative levels with different environments
+ AI Bots, so you can play alone if you want to. 

[b]This game is in Early Access so don't take these too seriously[/b]
- I would have liked to have seen more types of modes. Like Capture the Flag, or Team Deathmatch
- I feel like there needs to be more variety in the levels. Perhaps levels with ramps, multiple floors, windows to shoot out of, more destructible environments, etc.
- The biggest problem I had is that the camera is locked, so you can not aim too far up or down, it would be great if this was removed so you could arc grenades into the air or above obstacles.

Grenade Madness is their first game on Steam but they also developed Rail Heads for mobile devices.

Rather than a review – the game in its current stage has the potential to grow rapidly and very significantly through its development – I thought that some of my own personal observations would prove better.

I tried to play the game on Wednesday. I logged into the game to find completely empty servers. I wondered if the game had bots you could play with when this was the case. Thankfully I found that the game could indeed be played with bots. Fifteen minutes later, which is a standard round, and the following screen shot was the result:

[url=http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/450733824050078155/6DE79C12422F16121EBAEB62428326AD3CD7F63D/?interpolation=lanczos-none&output-format=jpeg&output-quality=95&fit=inside|1024:576&composite-to=*,*|1024:576&background-color=black]link to screenshot[/url]

I am used to playing with that type of ping being from Australia. If we Aussies don’t have local servers then the ping is going to be 200-350 on a good connection so please ignore the ping result. What I am specifically asking you to look at here is the scoreboard particularly ‘kills.’ This is a standard result of games with bots. The results were similar when I started a game with just one other person. You only lose “kills” when you commit suicide (-1 to kills each time you commit suicide). Rounds are fifteen minutes long. The “best” bot in this round killed itself at minimum fifteen times. The other two were in the twenties for a total of 63 suicides in a 15 minute round. That equates to 4.2+ suicides by the computer AI every minute. It’s more than that really if you want to get into the mathematics. There were 129 total kills in my game. I had 14 total kills and I may have killed myself more than once by accident as well. That type of AI is just unacceptable in a game like this when there are only 4 players/bots on a map.

When playing with just another player the bots are just as bad at killing themselves. The game turns into a bit of a farce as you are constantly chasing your real life opponent around the map and taking the cheap bot kills when they’re not too busy killing themselves. So how do they manage to kill themselves? In the most stupid way possible. There were multiple occasions where I would think that I was getting close to killing a bot and it would turn to face a wall, shoot a grenade on the wall directly in front of its face and literally stand there as it blew itself to smithereens. The game is called Grenade Madness and not Suicide Madness.

Unfortunately when I returned to play the next morning the servers were once again empty. The devs were awesome enough to provide a bounty of keys so I ran a quick giveaway on the Steamified Steam group in order to get some community members to play the game with. What I discovered was that you really need three or four players to have a meaningful game. A single bot wont kill you but it’s a pretty cool game when you have a number of real people to play with. It’s an easy game to learn – if you’ve ever played any sort of shooter you’re going to be set before you start – so it makes rounds easy to get into and a lot of fun. If you have a group of competent players it’s going to be some of the best fun that you can have and even more so if they’re a group of friends. So as much as I’ve bitched about the shortcomings of the game there are a lot of strengths and the game is a ton of fun.  The action is fast and furious, the kills and suicides occur very quickly, and given the difference in weapons (knife, grenade and block placing launcher) there is room for quick thinking strategies to be employed.

My favorite part of the game play are the knife fights. Though grenades can be launched and that is fun there’s nothing quite like being in the midst of close combat where you knife your opponent to death. And if there’s another player in the distance who shoots a grenade into your area he can get a smart double kill. You can even use the block grenade to put an obstacle in the unsuspecting way of your opponent. Although I must note that one time that I tried this I got my opponent stuck in the wall. The assorted arrangement of power ups are also quite handy and well thought out.

I didn’t investigate this myself but apparently you can change a number of the settings within the game. A member of the Steamified community established his own random room and changed the base settings of the game. At one point he, and the bots, were running around three to five times faster than what I was capable of. Therefore if you are to play on a random server I would be a little skeptical as to what the settings in that particular room are.

I must note that I loved the voice overs. When you commit suicide, for example, the robotic computer voice over will say “What have you done?” which is quite funny and when somebody else kills you you’ll occasionally hear “Try harder” which made me laugh quite sadistically. It’s small touches such as these that really can aide the game to reach its potential. The graphics are suitable but you’ll be sure to notice that there are currently clipping issues within the game.

I think that about does it but I’d like to close this by thanking the Steamified community for being as fantastically awesome as you are. Yes, some of you got a free game out of it but it was an enormous amount of fun playing the game with you. If you could write a review for yourself and post it on the game’s store page – positive and negative – I am certain that the devs at Touch Orchestra will really appreciate it. It’s a surefire way that they get the information that they require to make their game the best that it can possibly be for you.

Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi sürekli bombalama ve patlatma halindeyiz. Bu açıdan bu tür silahları kullanmayı sevenler için zevkli gelebilir. Haritalar genellikle ufak ve iceworld'ü andırıyor. Yani her an ayağınızın ucuna düşen veya yanınızdaki duvara yapışmış olan bir bombayla karşılaşabilirsiniz. Çeşitli silahlar mevcut ama henüz bu geliştirmeleri inceleyecek kadar oynayamadım. Zira sunucular bomboş ve botlar biraz aptal olduğu için onlarla oynamak sıkıcı geliyor. Oyun esnasında hızlanma, ışınlanma, bomba kapasitesini arttırma, sağlık, tecrübe puanı gibi çeşitli özellikler veren dropları toplayabiliyoruz. İkinci silahımızla blok koyup bombaları ve rakipleri engelleyebiliriz.

Genel olarak baktığımızda ise grafikler ve sesler fena değil, zaten grafikten çok oynanış ön planda. Bence oyun daha da geliştirilmeli ve bir şekilde oyuncu kitlesi oluşturulmalı.
