I will preface by saying, I've loved C14 Dating since long before I ever played it. I knew all about it, but never got a chance to play it until recently. I have already finished the entire game, with every single ending. It went by so fast, but I had an absolute blast-

The story is simple, but sweet. It's very slice of life, and might seem boring. I enjoyed the simplicity of what genuinely felt like just a normal life. It really helped me connect with the main character.

My favorite part of the game is how you learn more about each character. I would learn about one love interest's story when on another's route. The way everyone became intertwined was really cool. The main focus was mostly on friendship throughout the game. It really shows when one of my favorite endings was the group ending where everyone becomes close friends. You even learned more about the main character throughout all the different routes.

I can't think of any specific order to play through the routes. They all intersect at some points. I will say, my favorite guy was Kyler, but my favorite route was Deandre. Absolutely adorable.

I bought [b]C14 Dating[/b] when it came out, then got busy with other things. It's been a delight to get to play it now for the first time (January 2021).  I enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anybody who is in the mood for a slice of life, mostly non-angsty story with a bit of thinking thrown in.  While the story itself doesn't focus heavily on the diversity angle, it's nice to see representation of both disabilities and less typical potential love interests.  I fell completely for the (very) tsundere, overly-diligent Kyler, but I ended up being fond of everyone.

[b]Note 1:[/b]  the one w|w route is shorter because it was a bonus to the original game; however, the character involved is adorable and I found the story well-written 

[b]Note 2:[/b]  there is no voice acting, which is fairly standard for indie otome

Pros:
- the art is very appealing, and both the regular CGs and smaller chibi CGs are great
- the theme song is excellent
- the characters feel genuine, especially when dealing with either hurt feelings, or personal interests (this helps to overcome the fairly obvious tropes)
- the protagonist is lovely, without being perfect
- the game mixes a standard university/ training camp setting with something more professional; this provides a better sense that the characters are adults
- the mini-game in the cave dig portion of the game is fun if you enjoy picross puzzles
- both types of mini-games can be skipped
- smooth interface
- both romantic and friendship endings are positive endings
- the endings are nicely written, with lots of ""awwww"" moments [they can also feel a little abrupt, although that's partly the format of the game]

Cons:
- the in-game music is nice, but gets repetitive in places
- as others have said before, the stat-raising feels out of place: since only one stat is important to each route, a better choice might have been for ""affection"" to go up based on which activities you choose
- I'm not a big fan of having a random component to stat raising

[b]Overall:[/b] C14 Dating has some weaknesses, but it's better than average within the genre of slice-of-life otome.  Two stand-out items:  the CGs / CG moments are very cute; the main OP/ED song is excellent.

I'd like to think it's the slice of life pace that loses my interest, but I've found myself reasonably interested in slice of life tales before.  Despite the subject matter being rather dull to me, I had hopes that the characters and romance would have propped up the unusual premise.  Sadly, they do not.

It almost feels like [url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/winterwolves]Winter Wolves[/url] went through a checklist of things they wanted to include in the game but didn't develop any of them enough to make them feel meaningful.  Sure, we have a deaf guy, the chubby geek and the asexual teaching assistant who wears a prosthetic hand, but these traits rarely factor into the story other than being physical characteristics for the characters (we don't even get any interesting thoughts from Melissa about dating these guys).  I imagine they didn't want to offend anyone by misrepresenting handicaps, but not taking any risks in the storytelling feels like it's all a wasted effort.  It's actually sad that the stereotypical jock ended up being the most enjoyable character of the bunch considering that trope has been done to death in otome games; as crazy as it sounds, everyone else comes off as bland in comparison.

There's also a distinct lack of romantic tension throughout the characters' routes, taking until Week 7 (out of 8) before there's any acknowledgement of Melissa's feelings.  That's WAY too long for things to begin heating up in a romance story.  Granted, the writing is rather chaste, which is totally fine, but there could have been a little more emotional weight to the relationships.  Unfortunately, the dull premise and sluggish storytelling doesn't give the characters much to work with.

Unless you're really into archaeology, I can't say reading through the game's description of it is all that interesting.  For the most part the characters spend the entirety of their 8 weeks digging up and cleaning rocks and bones and going into detailed description on how that process works, but it's probably the most boring subject matter I've ever come across in a visual novel. I really don't care about distinguishing different layers of earth, how to tell rocks from bones, how Neanderthal tools were made, yada yada.  But I probably would have been okay with it if there was more excitement to the story than a couple of near-injuries and a camp festival.  In the end, the narrative simply wasn't engaging enough to keep me interested in the story or its characters.

So while the artwork is gorgeous (Deji is always great) and the presentation is excellent for an OELVN, it falls well short on the storytelling side of things. And as much as it pains me to thumb this one down, I feel I must.  Both story and characters are unmemorable, and even now I struggle to recall anything that sticks out in my mind after having finished all 5 routes.  C14 Dating is just...meh, and I cannot in good conscience recommend meh games to others, not at full price.  And given Winter Wolves' track record for game discounts, I doubt this one will ever get cheap enough for me to consider it worth recommending on sale, and that makes me a little sad.

(Like, seriously, lots of archaeology.) There isn't much of a plot: you are an American college student going abroad for a 2-month elective at an archaeological site in Belgium. There is little to no conflict, no ""true route"", etc. It's really all about interacting with the people you can date/become friends with, which is why I say it is a laid-back game.

Despite the lack of a plot, I would say that most of the game's strengths lie in its writing. The cast, which is pretty diverse--some characters have disabilities, as well as different sexualities and body types--is very loveable, and though some of them could be linked to certain dating sim tropes, they are well-rounded and not restricted to cliches. Interactions between characters and the MC are cute, and rather than a 'good end' and a 'bad end', each character has a 'romance end' and a 'friendship end' [strike]both of which made me smile like an idiot[/strike]. Even if you fail to befriend anyone, nothing bad happens. It's just a game that exhales niceness all around. On another positive note, the music is fairly nice and the art is usually well-done, although some CGs look a little awkward (Deandre, particularly, looks smaller and thinner in his CGs than in his sprites; and there are some issues with facial angles).

On the other hand... I was somewhat disappointed in the stat-raising system. I've played very few VNs based on stats, but they would usually require some balance (you would eventually need all stats to be at a certain level, which requires a strategy to juggle all possible activities in order to keep that balance). This doesn't happen in C14. If you want to get into a character's route, you just need to spam the hell out of one option and follow them to the cave or lab whenever you can, save for a few exceptions (the game never tells you where Joan is and there is one event of Shoji's that takes place when he was supposed to be at the cave, yet he turns out to be at the lab for... some reason). While this may make the game easier for those who don't like stats to begin with, it makes the whole system feel dispensable. It really only plays a significant part (in which you need to somewhat balance your stats and choices) to get the Group Photo CG and the Best Alone End. The minigames are entertaining at first, but quickly become tedious. Last but not least, this is the VN with the least intuitive choices I've ever played since Amnesia. There are occasions in which all choices available feel ""neutral"", and others in which a choice causes an effect opposite to what you would've imagined (this happened a lot in Kyler's route, particularly). 

All in all, I still enjoyed the game due to its characters and to how well some themes were handled (long-distance relationships, language barriers, friendship ends, and ESPECIALLY the asexual character route). I recommend it if you want a wholesome slice-of-life dating sim experience with little to no negativity and decent diversity. I do not recommend it if you're into dark, complex themes and/or very averse to stat-raising... or to using a guide. Because trust me, you'll probably need one.",1489577492,1489577818,True,38,0,0.811417281627655029,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The games are fun (and actually unlock a bunch of descriptions that serve to teach you about such concepts).

The potential friends/love interests are all unique and have good stories behind them. Some obstacles to overcome with individual interests are the language barrier, social anxiety, and grades.

Also like the mini-games, that makes it more than just a read-and-click game. Though admitting they do get a bit boring after playing them again and again and again, if you play (like me) the same game for several hours in a row, since there are only two mini-games. On the plus side, they do require me to actually use my brain during this game.

Love the music (which is not so strange, since it's from the Leetstreet Boys and I also like their music in Roommates) and even my mother (who normally kind of hates the sounds from my games) said it wasn't so bad to listen to. Enough variety to make sure it won't get boring eventually.

It's cute (innocent, if you like) and yet there are plenty of puns which made me smile. Overall, I'd say one of the better dating sim games I played.",1472138836,1472138836,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Song in the Main Menu is great[/b]. Whenever I opened the game, I stopped for a little bit to listen to it, but [b]music in the game is super generic and annoying[/b].

[b]I like the way that romancable characters look[/b]. They aren't just your standard otome pretty boys. They have different body types and they have their limitations. On the other hand, [b]their personalities are super cliche[/b]. You have your intelligent, cold and distant boy, that turns out to have a golden heart, you have easygoing sportsman and shy but kind nerd. Cliches aren't necessary a bad thing, as long as you can do something new and original with them or around them, but sadly, it's not the case.

I like the fact that [b]it's all about friendship[/b]. I hate when otome games, especially those sets in modern times, force you to focus on one particular character and, from the very beginning makes you know that romance is your main goal. Even if there are friendship endings, they usually feel like bad ends. Not here. I really liked how Melissa is getting along with people around her and how she gets to know them better. On the other hand, [b]romance is poorly done[/b]. This is a problem with many Winter Wolves games - it just came out of nowhere. Yes, I've made Melissa and Kyler getting along, yes, they have few cute scenes, that could point to to the fact, that they are developing crush on each other, but they spent so little time together (lack of scenes), that it doesn't feel emotional when she screams ""I love you!"" at the end. Like... when? How that happened? 

[b]Mini games seems like a step in the right direction[/b]. There are way too many of them (it felt like there were more lengthy minigames that actual meetings with characters that are interesting to you), sure. The lab one is partially based on luck, which seems pointless, but the cave one is challenging and pretty fun (if you want to play something like that and not, you know, focus on plot). Still, you have option to skip them and despite all the negative stuff I've just said, I can imagine it being a nice addition, if it will be done better in the future. [b] Stat raising, though, is annoying and pointless[/b]. Really. There is absolutely no reason why there need to be stats at all, especially, since you don't need to keep tracks of two stats, like in ""Nicole"" for example, but  only one. Want to date Kyler? Spam ""study"". Prefer Shoji? Spam ""play games"". What's the point of doing that, when you could chose particular paths or scores points with characters just by making choices within the plot? And there are choices like that here, so... Once again, why are we raising stats? For some extra endings, that also could be acquired my making right decisions?",1469692908,1469693268,True,27,0,0.745744168758392334,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And I've enjoyed all their games. 

You are Melissa, a university archaeology student, on a dig site in Belgium. You get to meet a selection of interesting people, and potentially fall in love with them. 

It's gratifying to see greater diversity, in so many ways: you have a saphic love interest, as well as an ace love interest. The protagonist is Hispanic. There are three disabled characters (protagonist is diabetic, one love interest is deaf, another has a prosthetic arm). 

Game play is fairly standard for this sort of game, with skill building and socialising with love interests till they're either friends or lovers etc... the game contains two mini games, which are skippable if you don't like puzzles or just want to speed up a second/third/fourth playthrough. Unlike in some earlier games, an effort seems to have been made with each love interest to make them at least somewhat compatible with our protagonist. You have some common ground with everyone and the relationships feel plausible. 

I'm also impressed at the level of detail and research that went into this game. Speaking as someone who's trained in both geology and archaeology, I can say that I saw no glaring errors. 

It's also nice to see such effort put into friendship paths, though there are occasions where it feels like you only got onto the friendship path because you failed at the romance path. It's also gratifying that there is an 'alone' ending which is positive (rather than being a lose condition as it is in many dating sims). 

All in all I can thoroughly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys dating sims. As I said at the start, this is one of Witnerwolves' best games so far.",1467483233,1468393291,True,16,0,0.678938388824462891,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has some stat raising mechanics, mini games, and a very diverse cast of characters to befriend and romance.

You are Melissa, 3rd year anthropology student on an archaeology summer course/internship in Belgium. Your fellow classmate couldn't make it on the trip, and so it's just you and your professor from California. That means you have to overcome language barriers, cultural differences & other boundaries to become friendly with the other students -- but at least there's camping, s'mores, and lots of cute guys and girls around!

[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]
+ Its theme, centered around archaeology & geology
+ The characters' diversity (disabilities, different body types, etc)
+ Pretty artwork
+ The ability to turn off the mini games & change the font
+ Lots of save slots

[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]
- The mini games [i]can[/i] get tedious, but you can disable them
- Some of the luck-based mechanics for the games & stat raising

It's obvious that the writers of this game knew a lot about archaeology, and I learned a lot as well! It's an interesting theme to which the mini games add some extra fun. The games themselves are light (one sudoku-like game & one luck/guessing game), as is the stat raising (you create a weekly schedule with activities that raise certain stats). Its overall atmosphere is very summer camp-like: sleeping in tents, cooking together, partying & setting up a festival.

Next to its archaeology-focus, the best part for me is the incredibly varied & diverse cast. You've got four guys and one gal on a ""secret"" route:

[list]
    [*][b]Kyler[/b], aloof neighbourhood tsundere with a cochlear implant
    [*][b]Deandre[/b], friendly & easygoing rugby player
    [*][b]Hendrik[/b], pun-loving geologist with a prosthetic arm
    [*][b]Shoji[/b], shy & chubby gamer with an artistic talent
    [*][b]Joan[/b], French flutist struggling with communicating in English
[/list]

And I really loved all of them!! They are vibrant characters whose background is expanded upon in their own route, in other people's routes, and during location/random events (either when you're working in the lab or in the cave). Most of them are also from different countries & speak different languages. It's such a varied and cute bunch of people all connected to archaeology in some way, and all trying to help out Melissa, the protagonist.

Would 100% recommend this if you're looking for a cute, diverse dating/otome game that doesn't have a standard story or theme. I thought it was a great experience :)",1462623613,1462657675,True,12,0,0.629769206047058105,0,True,False,False,False,,,
