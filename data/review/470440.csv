Luckily there are lifelines that allow you to change a piece or skip a piece in the queue once per board, so you're not entirely at the mercy of the RNG.

Soundtrack is a nice mix of synthwave artists, including some well-known in that scene (Home). I found myself eventually disabling the music because of how small the selection is.

Biggest gripe is that placing the pieces can be awkward, and can cause you to place a piece wrong if you're moving too quickly. With only one undo per board, it can get frustrating if you irreparably place a piece in the wrong spot more than once, causing you to have to restart if you want 100%.

I also happen to love the occasional puzzler. Long story short? The most talented of artists don't always sign off their music to quality products

Matris' gameplay could be best described as... the painters version of Tetris? Although I'd more say it was the Duplo or Mega Bloks of Tetris games, but even with that comparison, I think in some ways that's giving this game more credit than it deserves, as it would justify why it was made. Matris lacks that certain raison d'être, both in design and its gameplay. You kind of just stick puzzle pieces into place, and that's really it. None of the other game modes take it in an interesting direction either, as you lack that reason to care about your placement like in real Tetris when you fear your blocks touching the top of the screen. You have all day, really, and you could think out your moves precisely, and that's just not exciting. 

Classic puzzle games like Tetris or Columns are about a constant assault on the player. How will you deal with what the game throws your way next? Matris (like a mattress, as in, the game will put you to sleep because it's so boring) isn't interested in asking you that question. I don't even think it's even that interested in itself with its colorless, grey and plain design. Yes I know I can customize it myself, but it says a lot when not even the designers thought fit to make the presentation eye catching for people that you know, might REFUND the game, cause you could get everything you need within five minutes.

The soundtrack by HOME, while great, just doesn't fit. The gameplay is too slow. Even in time attack - where you're given a way too generous (I'd actually call it laborious) 10 minute limit - never do I ever feel compelled to race the clock. It'd be like if Jeopardy had the Duke Nukem theme playing throughout the entirety of the show. Does it make Jeopardy more exciting? No. It'd still be the same old sassy molassy Trebek askin' questions. HOME's music deserves a better home in a moderately faster paced game.

The game reeks of mobile phone game design, where if you give the game your undivided attention, you get nothing in return, because it's just not that taxing to play. It needed something to drive the gameplay, but maybe like myself, the devs were too excited about licensed music and not the actual content of the game.

Matris is a dynamic puzzle game that bears resemblance to Lumines and Tetris. The player task is to fill the map/matrix with tretromino-like blocks, provided by the AI. What sounds easy to learn, seems difficult to master - and that learning curve is the main motor for neverending fun of Matris. Lots of different modifications and built-in level editor asures the player that no matter how much he'd play, there's still an awful lot to discover.
