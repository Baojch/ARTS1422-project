Took 7.4 hours to beat the campaign once in 3 player coop, that includes 2 game overs from bad runs due to bad RNG with perks+enchantments.

I'd say it's a 7/10 right now, definitely better than it was when they first released the demo but definitely could still use some work.  Not a lot of variety in rooms and you see the same ones repeated in all dungeon types (there are 3 episodes per dungeon type and 9 episodes total, so 3 dungeon types total).

Would be nice if you could choose not to have an off weapon, getting perks for the weapon you don't use, even on reroll (you get 4 rerolls per level) is a real bummer.  My 2 coop partners were both the sorceress, both were doing pure spellcasting and they would routinely get 3 perks for melee only, then spend one of their rerolls and get 3 melee perks again.  Seriously needs to be fixed.

Has a FoV slider, I maxed it out, at the start of each level you have to attack once for it to apply your FoV if it isn't default.  If there is headbob I didn't notice, I am really sensitive to both headbob and FoV so if there was headbob it wasn't enough to make me feel nauseous.

There were sync issues at times (like one player would hit an enemy and the enemy wouldn't take damage).

Allies can block projectiles, ie. a sorc casts a spell it hits their ally it doesn't go through them to the enemy.

There are higher difficulties to play on and achievements for grinding through them.  Will see what we do from here.",1712184957,1712185982,True,5,0,0.500927269458770752,0,False,True,False,True,,,

Der Stil ist großartig umgesetzt, der Titelsong ein Ohrwurm und die Charaktere sind genauso schmalzig wie ich sie in Erinnerung habe. An der Präsentation kann ich überhaupt nichts aussetzen und muss sie in den höchsten Tönen loben. Fantastisch!

Aber leider ... hauts auf der Gameplayebene nicht so richtig hin. MythForce ist nämlich ein echt eintöniges Roguelite. Wir stampfen durch die zufällig generierten Levels, deren Räume sich schnell wiederholen, und hauen mehrere Monsterwellen um, die in einer Zahl von jeweils 3-5 auf uns zugestapft kommen und ihre Waffe schwingen. Dabei nutzen wir Skills mit viel zu langen Cooldowns oder verlassen uns auf unsere Nah/Fernkampfwaffen. Ich bin über das ganze Spiel gut damit gefahren, die Skills komplett zu ignorieren und mich auf den Powerangriff zu konzentrieren. Der haut den Gegner aus den Socken und sorgt dafür, dass Folgetreffer immer kritisch sind. Dadurch war das ganze Spiel dann relativ leicht. Mit den Perks, die man nach jedem Raum auswählen kann, kann man den Powerangriff noch weiter stärken, bis irgendwann alles nach ein, zwei Schlägen umgekippt ist. Das Powerscaling ist also relativ hoch. Verteidigungsstärkende Buffs habe ich liegen lassen, nachdem ich gemerkt habe, dass die so gut wie nix bringen - wenn mir die Gegner eine zimmern, dann ordentlich - da ist die Lebensleiste entweder halb leer oder ich gehe direkt über den Jordan. 

Auch der Content ist etwas dünn, denn die 9 Episoden dauern pro Durchlauf etwa 30-60 Minuten, je nachdem wie viel Zeit man sich nimmt. Damit flimmert der Abspann schnell über den Bildschirm und der Wiederspielwert besteht darin, die mythischen Schwierigkeitsgrade anzugehen oder einen neuen Charakter auszuprobieren. Das finde ich etwas mau.

Conceito e arte incríveis, mas a execução poderia ter sido melhor.

Combate é muito simples e a IA carece de táticas básicas.
Mapas poderiam ter muito mais variedade, fica bem repetitivo.
Progressão é superficial, 90% dela são apenas mais números em vez de novas habilidades e equipamentos.
Dificuldade são apenas os velhos inimigos esponja e mais dano. Tem modificadores, mas são novamente apenas números superficiais em vez de novas mecânicas.

I recommend it only with a 75% discount, and if you're looking for just a weekend/a few hours of entertainment for that price, then it might be worth it.
But not for the full price, since there are more developed games that are similar and in the same range, like Vermintide 2. 

Awesome concept and art but the execution could have been better. 

Combat is too simple and AI lacks basic tatics.
Maps could have way more variety, it gets pretty repetitive. 
Progression is superficial, 90% of it is just more numbers instead of new skills and equipment.

Sadly, the game is a hidden gem. Maybe its because people think its Online only? It isnt. To be honest, this thought was pushing me away at first, but i was so wrong. You can play the whole game solo. Its even perfect to play a round or two after work (Stages last from 30 Minutes to 1 Hour).

In short, its a fantastic relaxing game with a great synth soundtrack, charming characters, nice graphics and sound. Give it a try

They did it. They released an upgrade patch. And what a patch it is. Less repeating rooms, faster gameplay, new intro and outro movies(!) for stages.

The bad :
- Most inspiration went into the core concept.
- Most secondary equipment feels rather ~meh.
- Arena design : some are okay, some are ~meh in relation to the enemy spawning points.
- Why is eeeeveeeryyyyythiiiing sooooo sloooooooooooow......... From the ridiculous cooldowns to the enemy walking speed (those skeletons feel like slow zombies...), the animations or even basic attacks, Mythforce is too slowly paced for a co-op action roguelike.

    The trailer promising on exciting adventures and legions of baddies delivers trotting around like a tourist in rather empty arenas -which somewhat still feel cramped- fighting a couple skeletons. I rather expected to be chased by a giant boulder in an infinite stairway to some mid-boss fight while jumpdashing, wallrunning and slashing through an army of cannon fodder, all that before the countdown to some evil moon-laser attack gets to zero and the planet is destroyed, you know ?

The theme and art style are executed very well - but that's about it..

I beat the first 2 levels, so I'm not sure if I explored all the systems or not fully but there's not much making me want to yet..

The combat feels unresponsive, you'll hit things and there's almost no feedback (until toward the end of a run when you're decked out, but..)
Levels are over just as you feel you're getting somewhere, I almost feel like they should go for something more like gunfire reborn.
And then there just doesn't feel like there's much of anything.. Rooms in a level repeat a lot, you'll see the same few upgrades and items and each character's 4 abilities are very basic and can't be customised/upgraded much at all.

I'd understand if this was early access, but it isn't.

The core idea behind the game is good - a co-op adventure, made to feel like it's just an another episode of the 80's cartoon show. Visuals are great and it does indeed look like an 80's cartoon. NGL - that distinct look was exactly the thing that sold this game to me.

Unfortunately, behind a cute picture hides a ""not so cute"" gameplay. At the 2 hour mark I already knew that the game wasn't good and I was deliberating if I should refund it or not. In the end I've decided to give it a bit more time and explore it more thoroughly and 42 hours later I think that I should have refunded it back than after all. Now I will explain the game's problems, so that you can avoid my mistake.

1. Playerbase and connectivity issues. This game was designed as a co-op game first and foremost. But unless you have a few friends from the same town willing to play the game together with you - you better forget about the ""co-op"" part alltogether. First - the playerbase is low and you will be quite lucky if the game matches you with someone else at all. Second - even if it does, there are no dedicated servers, the game is hosted on a player's PC and the netcode is terribad. Every, EVERY SINGLE FKIN TIME that I was connected to someone else, or someone else was connected to me - the ping suddenly decided that using Mars as a reroute point is an excellent idea. And I'm not talking about a 0,3 second delay that is enough to drive crazy most modern gamers. The games goes a full on unresponsive mode with teleporting mobs, 5-10 second delays, invulnerability issues and so on and so forth. Every single fkkin time. It's literally unplayable. After trying for about 20 times at different time with different people - I've just gave up on the ""co-op"" idea and simply played solo. And just one more thing - there is no host browser window. You can't choose your region or a game's map that you want to play. Thre is only a ""join a game"" button and the will of the RNGesus.

2. Basic gameplay. Many players complain that the game is too slow and easy. And indeed beating the maps on the Normal/Hard difficulty is not too hard at all. Mobs are slow, they don't hit too hard and are generally easy to beat. The real game starts at the Mythic 1-2-3 levels. But the thing is - most players will never even see them. There are 9 maps in total and every 3rd one has a major (episode) boss and the steam stats say that the first boss was beaten by 31% of players, second by 13% and the last one only by 8%. Is it because they are progressively harder? Not at all - it is because players loose interest in the game that fast, thinking that there is no point in playing it if it's this slow and easy. But the thing is that going from hard to mythic bumps the difficulty by A LOT. Monsters suddenly 2-shot you, they become stronger and their number increases, you need to pray for the good DPS perks and in general be constantly on alert. This is an entirely different game. Personally I think that the Mythic difficulty should have been unlocked right from the start, instead of requiring beating the hard difficulty first - just to show that the game could be a lot more brutal before ppl decide that it's too easy and lose interest in it.

3. Maps and animations. This is a ""roguelite"" type of a game where levels ""change"" each run. The thing is - there are simply not enough assets to make levels feel any different. Every single run feels absolutely the same. It gets dull very, VERY quickly. Also the game lacks ""funny distractions"" like some silly critters running around, moving mechanisms, mysterious spirits floating around, etc, etc. For a good roguelite this is a must to take off players eyes away from the repeating assets. If you constantly bump into the same walls, stairs and 2 coffin models all the time - you get tired of it quick. Another issue that breaks the immersion - poor animations. Some of them are ok, skills are mostly well done, but others... For example there are plenty of chests in game. They literally have 2 frames on em - ""closed chest"" and ""open chest"" there is no ""opening"" animation it just unlocks instantly in 1 frame. When you attack jars with melee weapon, weapon just stops for a second and then jumps to the next frame. It doesn't feel smooth at all. Some people might defend this by saying ""it's mimicing an 80's animation style with abrupt cuts"" but this is no 80's animation it's 2020's game and to enjoy it players want smooth animations that flow well.

4. Perks, progression, grind.  Every single one defencive perk (aside from vampirism or health restoration) is utterly useless. Especially if you play solo. If you stack up all the defencive perks they will barely reduce the incoming damage, but with inadequate offencive capabilities mobs will steamroll you easy AF. On the other hand if you manage to stack only the best damage-related perks you can critshot even a mythic-level boss with a few good hits and oneshot most other mobs. This is a poor balancing. Next is the progression issue - whatever character you pick up in the beginning - you better stick with it,  because the only thing that transfers between characters - it's the castle (shops) upgrades. But gold and constellation crystals - are separate. And you will need A TON of gold to max up even a single weapon. And without a maxed weapon good luck trying to beat mythic-lvls (not entirely impossible, but way harder than it should be). Most people will drop the game waaaay before they get even a single weapon to the max lvl. Default gold drop amount should definitely be increased by at least x1,5-2 and both gold and crystals should be an account-based asset, not a character-locked.

5. Hitboxes. They are one more issue that makes me enraged. I've lost count how many time did my character got hit and died by a monster swinging a sword like 5 meter away from me. Seriously, lizardmen swings at empty air not even close to your character and boom - you take damage from it. Fkk this. Also this works the other way around too, especially with arrows - many times when you shoot right at the enemy - the arrow just go through it without inflicting any damage. Especially if it's a sceleton.

6. This may be my personal issue - but WTF are those lightning acolytes, devs? The most brutal, unforgiving and cheating enemy of all. They AOE hit waay out of the hit zone (there is no such issue with fire or cold acolytes, only lightning), their direct lightning strikes are instant, unavoidable and hit harder than any other enemy or attack in the whole game. On mythic 2-3 it gets so bad, that i really afraid of them more than any boss, and instantly dump all CD's on 'em if i see one. Don't tell me this BS is by design >_>

So all in all - decent idea, that i would love to support, but poor execution with disfunctional co-op, poor balance, excessive grind, boring level layout, technical hiccups and many other things that may not be critical on their own, but together they snowball into one unpleasant mass - all this make this game an expirience, that i would recommend to avoid.


PS: I think that there is a chance to save this game, but I don't think that the devs are brave enough to take the required drastic measures to actually do that. The game needs to be closed for approx 1,5-2 years and in that time a total rebalance of the gameplay and progression should be done, levels impruved and made fancier, dedicated region-based servers for co-op implemented, etc. But it's a lot of work, that require time and money and with the amount of interest (or to be precise with the complete lack of it) that gamers gave the Mythforce... I think that this game is on a straight path to mists of oblivion atm, so no one will actually try to resque it.

As a roguelike, this fails hard. 
- There's no between-character progression other than stages and overworld levels. If you don't like your character after farming for 10 hours, guess you have to farm another 10 hours for gems.
- There's no between-stage progression. You start fresh every time, which makes sense because (next)
- Balance is ALL OVER THE PLACE, as many others have mentioned.
- It's nearly impossible to solo on harder difficulties, especially with curses like ""if you get hit, lose 10 max hp"". Like, WHAT?
- The overarching progression is... not fun? 1. You give items a higher drop chance. 2. You slot gems, which you have to ceaselessly farm (here you have to choose between damage and defenses). 3. You level max perk totals, but you can't delevel them so you can't actually make a consistent build. 4. You upgrade weapons, for incrementally doubling damage.
- If you decide you like a weapon and don't want to use/upgrade the other one, well then you're definitely going to get a bunch of weapon upgrades for the one you're not using! Hah!
- Gold is shared within the map and is tied to overworld progress. If you decide you actually want to use the shop, you lose out on progression. 

As a multiplayer game, it succeeds somewhat. Though, there are caveats. 
- You can give build-specific items to your friends. But, if any ability upgrades drop, it's first come first serve. Chances are you won't even *see* them. 
- If one member is bugged, the run is over. ""You must gather your party before venturing forth!""
- Quickplay is fun sometimes, awful at other times. It commonly places you in matches that are nearly over. Most of the time, you don't get any perks. You don't get any starting items. Sometimes it'll place you in a match where the host is AFK, and you CAN NOT join any other games (it'll just keep sending you to that one). Additionally, you'll be placed in a game that is NOT the difficulty you selected.

There are a lot of bugs and QOL problems.
- Hitting skeletons with a bow is damn near impossible to the point that playing the archer is inadvisable.
- There are holes you can fall down and never come back from. You're not dead, but the run is over for everyone in the party.
- Some abilities are 'slippery' in that you might miss if you're slightly off of the hitbox even if your weapon actually hits them.
- General bugs. Sometimes you might use your Mythforce ability and not be able to attack. Other times, there are floating wall textures.
- Enemies will occasionally spawn right on top of you.
- Enemies will get locked behind the black spawning walls (tldr: bad level design) where they can hit you but you can't hit them.

Without a doubt.

The campaign is more ""on rails"" than is Roboquest, but the gameplay itself is the most fun we've had with this game style.

You play as one of several ""heroes,"" each one of which has particular built-in perks. Nothing new there. But the various perks are quite intriguing, and, each ""hero"" has its own in-game dialog that runs and interacts with the other ""heroes'"" in-game dialog. The net effect is that the game just doesn't take itself seriously, which adds to the fun. 19-hours in, and the running dialog is still entertaining rather than monotonous.

For example, the ""Victoria"" character hits a trip wire and gets herself all corroded. The ""Maggie"" character, in a deliciously snarky tone, says, ""Victoria, did you not even SEE the trap?"" And it goes on and on. Back and forth. So far it hasn't gotten old. It probably will, but then it's just background noise.

The ""lite"" part of ""Rogue-lite"" in this game is a very detailed, intuitive, and fun-to-grind tech tree. There is a ""constellation"" of four-colors of gems that you acquire throughout each run. You can spend ""shields"" (another in-game drop) to expand the constellation, opening new drop-points for your gems to enhance weapon-power, crit-damage, lucky-shot, various defenses, power-cool-down reductions, and so on. Cleverly, you can get 10 of a particular gem color and then stack them into a single higher-power gem, so you replace a single gem with a stack. And you can combine stacks (in exponential) fashion three more times (if you have time in your life to gain the many hundreds of gems needed and the millions of in-game dollars). It's an intriguing approach that is satisfying to build out.

Of course, you can also level your weapons, which (unlike most such games) this game lets you keep! So, find your preferred weapon combo (you can have a primary and secondary), and then grind to level them.

You can also level ""trinkets"" for both power and drop-frequency, and you can level perks for power and frequency that are granted at drop-stations between each part of an ""episode.""

In short, there's LOTS to motivate you to mine for in-game drops and perpetually level your character, weapons, and chances. It's by far the best of the ""tech"" approaches I've seen in a ""Rogue-lite"" game.

The story line is about as meh as all of these games. It's a ""story"" to motivate your pass through a particular run, nothing more. It also motivates some of the running in-game dialog between the characters. Again, meh, but the in-game dialog has enough high-points to be worth having in the game.

The weapons are fun to play and feel right. Again, this is something that many games can't seem to manage to get right, but this one does.

The balancing and difficult scale ""correctly"" IMO. ""Easy"" mode is indeed manageable for even your initial low-level, low-tech characters. ""Normal"" is a for-real challenge, even with a half-leveled character. We haven't even tried harder difficulty-levels yet, because ""normal"" is plenty enough of a challenge for where we are in the grind path. So, there's a LOT of replayability here.

Co-op works well, with a simple Steam invite. I will say that a couple of times the servers have seemed to have trouble getting us connected, but that's been rare. It IS something you should be aware of, though, because the MOMENT that it becomes more money that it's worth for them to keep the servers up, this game is insta-dead! Remember Loadout, which was great until the moment when it was insta-dead. You are definitely taking a risk with this sort of multiplayer/co-op support. But you'll almost certainly get your money's worth by the time the insta-death happens.

This game gets it all right IMO. It's our go-to game at the moment, and that's saying something, given our limited game-time opportunities.",1705272419,1705272419,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Мало персонажей и разнообразия, рога и лучник очень похожи друг на друга, даже одинаковый базовый набор оружия. 

Ульта у персонажей  либо непонятная, либо бесполезная, честно сказать не нашел где прочесть, но чем ульта лучника от роги и война отличается, вообще загадка, хотелось бы конечно что-то эпичное, сложно это требовать от игры за 9 баксов, но все же.

Баги, но не критичные, но все же неприятные, во-первых, постоянно ""заедают"" способности, иконка позволяет использовать, но почему-то не прожимается, очень раздражает это даже меня убило у босса, не мог убежать от него, а способность передвижения не прожималась, но благо играл не один поэтому жопа не сильно сгорела, во-вторых появление мобов, проваливание за текстуры, всё здесь, пару раз лут проваливался сквозь землю.

Типовые комнаты, на первых 3ех часах игры не раздражало, но вот когда попадаешь в катакомбы и приходится постоянно бегать по одним и тем же типовым комнатам это начинает раздражать.

Итог: пока могу сказать, что ценник игры 500 рублей и надо играть с другом чтобы использовать весь потанцевал игры, потому что если играть в соло, то есть куча рогаликов, которые дадут прикурить этой игре в плане механик, сюжета и вылизонности.",1704630393,1704630393,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I like the game and the aesthetic. It seems like it has a solid foundation with a strong nostalgia factor. It's simple and intuitive and charming.

The menus are a bit bare bones, and the tutorial should be interactive. (example: I want to buy a tome of lightning I need an armory lvl 2 or something... I'm not sure how how I got an armory level 1...)

I don't normally advocate DLC, but adding characters would probably bring in what I believe is much needed development cash to polish the experience.

Der Style und die Musik von MythForce sind wirklich super aber leider hilft das nix, wenn sich der Kampf einfach nicht rund anfühlt, nach dem ersten Akt sich alles wiederholt und man für kleinste Upgrades ewig lang grinden muss.

Zu 50% hat man das Gefühl, dass man am Gegner vorbei schlägt, sprintet, blockt und schießt was super frustrierend wird mit steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad.
Die ""Upgrades"" und ""Level"" etc. spürt man in der Regel kaum bis gar nicht (z.B. 5% erhöhter Kritschaden...Chance wäre ja ok aber paar Prozent mehr KRITSCHADEN? Das merkt man halt NULL!) oder nur in den seltensten Fällen was absolut liegen gebliebenes Potential ist.
Die Missionen welche dem Spieler Geld für Upgrades geben sollen bekommt man nicht pro Charakter sondern insgesamt was bedeutet wenn man einen Char levelt fehlt es für die anderen an Kohle die man dann nur durch abgrundlangweiliges Grinden hochgezogen bekommt.

Desweiteren ist das Game quasi tot.
Wenn ihr also keine Leute habt die das Spiel mit euch zusammen spielen würden dann könnt ihr nur Solo rumrennen was zu vielen Toden führt die meist durch Pech entstehen (z.B. Bugs wie ""Man kann nicht mehr angreifen und muss dann aufgeben"" oder weil 8 Elitegegner in einem engen Korridor um dich rum spawnen)

Unbedingte Kaufempfehlung für Roguelike Shooter Fans. Das Spiel ist genauso gut und auch von der Spielmechanik vergleichbar wie z.B. die ebenfalls aus diesem Jahr stammenden sehr guten Spiele Arcadegeddon oder Superior: Vengeance. Der Unterschied zu diesen ist, dass bei Mythforce beim Spieler tatsächlich der Eindruck entsteht, man spiele in einem Comic aus den 80gern - wie beworben. Und ich fürchte, dass dies die Ursache für die relativen schlechten Reviews ist. Optisch wirkt es veraltet, und das in jeder Hinsicht (Level-Design, Menüführung, Aussehen der Spieler und Gegner, Upgrade System etc.). Ich selbst finde das raffiniert gemacht, denn es ist letztlich in aktueller Technik entwickelt. Hinzu kommt vielleicht für die durchwachsende Kritik eine m.E. nicht so gute Erklärung der Spielmechaniken, so dass man doch länger braucht, um alles zu entdecken, was in dem Spiel steckt. Es hat auch immer noch einige Bugs (obwohl es ja kein EA ist), auch wenn es nach dem letzten Update besser geworden ist. Ebenfalls wie bei den anderen beiden genannten Spielen: Das Hochleveln des Charakters ist notwendig, um auf höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden zu bestehen, dauert aber ewig. Nur Liebhaber haben diese Ausdauer. Und es gibt nicht allzu viele Level/Missionen, auch wenn diese jedes Mal leicht verändert werden.

Off the top of my head:

Perk/Enchant balance is all over the place. Perks vary from incredibly helpful to completely useless or detrimental to a surprising degree. Defensive perks are incredibly weak compared to the damage that enemies do, and offensive perks scale so quickly that they outpace enemy health hilariously fast.

Hit reg: The only things that hit you in this game are because of their absurdly misrepresented hitboxes, and Caster mobs that teleport on top of you and throw a huge AoE suddenly. This wouldn't be so frustrating if these attacks didn't empty 60% of your health bar in one hit, but as I mentioned earlier, building defensively in this game is simply too weak compared to enemy damage.

Missions: Why is the method for unlocking the next difficulty of a mission to beat it on the lower difficulty, instead of beating the previous level on the given difficulty? Why do perks/enchants scale so high in level when the chapters end so quickly that you have no time to level them up? Why are perks/enchants not weighted towards helping upgrade ones you already have instead of offering every perk at equal %?

Voicelines: Love the voice acting, hate hearing a character point out the exit door 3 times in 5 seconds. 

The game is riddled with tiny design choices that just make you wonder why? The game is like... 90% playable, but that last 10% really detracts from how much fun this game COULD be if it was really cared about.

Honestly please read this and more reviews before buying, I fell for the recent reviews. ""Oh it was mixed but now its positive and the positive reviews seem to be fine, maybe people were just picky early on!""

I cannot believe BEAMDOG, the people responsible for the Baldur's Gate remasters, are behind this one. Or maybe I can? They had a shitty reputation from doing those remasters. And you know what if you look at their catalog of games, they dont have any that ARENT remasters of old dnd games or ports of board games. This is basically their first forray into the game making space, and it really shows. Not to mention they laid off 26 of their staff on Sept 19th, a week after this game ""released"".

This game's entire marketing gimmick is that its reminicent of 80s cartoons. But it also plays like its for someone who's not much of a gamer, someone in their 40s or 50s. The game is just.... slow. The overwatch-styled hud will mislead you, its not ANYWHERE near as fast paced or responsive. The game is full of shambling enemies that are effectively walking health sponges. Moving around doesn't feel fluid and dynamic. The powerups are roguelike and kind of interesting but you're really just stuck with your 3 abilities and they arent all that interesting truth be told. The whole game is really just... good on paper poor in play. Almost as if the people making the game are good at... pen and paper games... and not dynamic action games....

I played as Maggie the wizard, the only of the four characters marked at 3/3 difficulty. It was not hard, despite somehow at the very start I lit myself on fire and spent the rest of the 20 minutes at 30% hp. No, it was mundane and boring. You start with a fire book as your weapon, and the standard attack is a fire puff. When I say puff, I really mean it, you have to be right on top of someone for it to even hit them. Okay sure, I'll just use the strong attack, charging up a fireball to lob at people. That worked well, outside of the fact that doing this spends your ""energy"" aka mana aka stamina so the entire time I played, for 20 minutes, was me just slowly charging and lobbing a few fireballs and then needing to wait to restore my energy and lobbing more. The enemies whether skeletal or mushroom in nature, wordlessly appear and shamble forth. Of my three abilities, one was a teleport, a shield, and a summoned bird that acted as a peashooter turret. So basically the next twenty minutes was nothing but slowly lobbing fireballs at walking sponges. It just tells me that there's some clear issues in the game loop and weapon/skill design. When your core game loop feels like you're kind of just existing and swimming through molasses, you have to go back and tune it up.

There are some other things that bothered me. I did die once, because a mushroom-person spawned behind me, wordlessly and without sound. Normally in a game there would be SOUND to help you there. Thankfully I was playing with a random who picked me back up. There's no indication on how long this takes for the person on the receiving end, which is kind of basic game design guys. The ""tutorial"" is just a bunch of popups on your screen with endless ""dont show this tutorial again"" checkboxes to check. All of which pops up when you first enter a game, so hopefully you share my experience in trying to matchmake and finally land a game only to be standing there for a minute reading and then disconnect from the host. Character selection is also a bit weird, its a neat concept to have all the characters sitting there, but the way they look up at you is super uncanny valley. The loading screen is the mythforce logo with the guy saying ""MYTH FORCEEEE!"", I am unsure if that plays every time but god DAMN I can see that getting annoying.

Again, its like the people who made this game are an era behind. It feels like they are too used to pen and paper rules, that they designed all of this in a box and translated that to a game while never sitting down to make it feel fluid and dynamic. It feels like they know how dnd works and how to make a custom campaign and character backstories, but then looked to modern games like overwatch to try to design their game around without understanding anything about gameplay.

Secondly, the game seems to be made much more for ""enjoyment"" rather than ""excitement"" in general - that being said, there are bosses and mini-bosses that provide a fair bit of challenge. You will run into situations, depending on which character you have chosen, where you will need to revise how you play and how you use the different mechanics of the game to tackle this obstacle.

Outside of a few bugs and (for some reason) near invulnerable enemies, this game is a treat for the eyes and mind with the right group of friends. I usually play more fast paced games but I've been thoroughly enjoying this game.

- Gameplay consists of procedurally generated room-to-room runs of approx. 30 mins with an upgrade perk after each one.
- Combat is fun and distills much of the feel of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands into a tidy roguelike.
- There's plenty to upgrade, and plenty to customize about your kit, with different weapon types and favored items.
- Stat upgrades are handled by a 'constellation' system where you can slot different types of improvements into different slots. i.e., a combat slot could be fit with a gem to increase physical attack, defense, attack speed, or combat cooldown, while a utility slot could be fit for crit damage, health, total energy, or ult cooldown.
- The graphics are kitschy and nostalgic, especially if you grew up watching cartoons from the late 80s.

Let's address the feedback on the Steam page first of all. Most of that comes from before the most recent patch that corrected a lot of problems, but it's still a new game with very few reviews, so each individual review will swing the stats wildly. It's not going to win any awards, but it's a fun romp well worth the half-priced (maybe not full priced) admission. I've played with some randos, which went well, but I'll bet it's a blast with friends. It currently supports crossplay between Steam and Epic, though it is available for all consoles. There's definitely room for the game to grow. It feels a bit like a final-stage early access title, but the devs are taking tons of feedback and working to improve it more than it already has.",1701661246,1701661246,True,2,0,0,0,True,True,False,True,,,

Core mechanics are in place, but content is very lackluster. The need to grind for metaprogression to get decent raw stats and unlock higher tier upgrades made me not want to continue after beating the first major boss. I started 4th level and seen that my character is back to lvl 1 and takes around 10 attacks to kill 1 basic skeleton even after dropping the difficulty to normal, so either I am missing raw stats or it's just normal that enemies become damage sponges, neither of which is fun. Maybe (big maybe) if all metaprogression was shared between characters it would be less painful to grind it out, but in the current state I can't make myself continue to at least finish the whole game on single difficulty. Luckily I received the game for free, because otherwise I'd be rather disappointed even at half a price for the experience compared to other similar games. I only played single player, so multi player experience might be slightly different.

[u]Positives[/u]
- Visuals are nice
- Access to both melee and ranged combat with every class

[u]Negatives[/u]
- Too repetitive due to lack of room layouts, interesting upgrades (you'll see almost the same perks, weapon upgrades, and items every run), and very little weapon changes
- Items are quite rare to find outside of 2 shop rooms per run, and they give such small bonuses at low tier (in demo you could get any tier immediately and felt like they were dropped more frequently. Even then items felt only OK-ish, mostly few generic buffs that aren't too noticeable). Most chests and pots in the rooms just drop gold to be used in those shops that each contain 6 items in total
- Higher tier upgrades (perks, weapon upgrades, gems, and items) are locked behind metaprogression which takes many runs to upgrade everything
- Most metaprogression upgrades are not shared between characters, so you have to grind them with each character
- Difficulty is severely gated behind metaprogression upgrades (I went into 3rd level on hard with ""new"" character and I did 11 critical damage to the first boss which had 6k HP despite having perk that makes me deal 75% more damage. It took me probably 10 minutes to kill it with the help of environmental fire trap because I had no raw stat upgrades from metaprogression; the run got much more tolerable few rooms after when I got some stat boosts)
- Some ability upgrades have buffs only for allies which is disappointing for single player experience",1701653101,1701653312,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,2,False,True,False,True,,,

Steam achievements (23)
Amazing style
The main heroes are fun to listen to (for the first time)
Getting that 80s' vibe devs were going for
All of the cinematics are pretty dope 
Beautifully cheesy 

-
A lot of bugs (shrines spawning one over another, getting stuck, inability to attack ...)
No Steam trading cards
Heroes are incredibly unbalanced
Besides Glyphs, meta currency and progression are specific so you need to grind for every character solo (making it near impossible to play them on harder difficulty if you didn't main them previously)
Too grindy honestly ... it takes like 2 hours to upgrade a weapon later on 
Really repetitive gameplay
9 levels but they feel like 3 with changes in their last sections
Level - 16 arena rooms that roll from the poll of 5-7 
Everything (even emotes and voice lines) has to be bought with meta-currency 
It is the most useless level-up system I have ever seen (no decisions and enemies scale in about 1 room)
Your teammates block your projectiles and spells which makes mixed groups frustrating
Content doesn't scale with the amount of players correctly - single-player is then much harder than multiplayer 
No integrated voice chat or even real chat - you can only emote each other
Low enemy variety (most are just reskins from one race to another)
Even if the crosshair tells you 'it's a hit' don't believe it - precise shots (arrows) often miss even then since some enemies wobble around when they move
Loot, perks and talents are uninspired at best",1701458785,1701674341,False,2,0,0.537892818450927734,0,False,False,False,True,,1701883026.0,"Hi Ascate
Thanks for all the detailed feedback.
Work is already well underway addressing alot of the points of friction you detail in your review.
This includes, but is not limited to; an overhaul of the metagame to reduce the grind, reworking of perk/hero abilities,  making combat encounters more dynamic, and ironing out the remaining bugs.
Stay tuned for our patch announcements.

anyone who says it feels sluggish doesn't know how to experiment. let me give you a tip
melee dash attacks can be used mid-air if you sprint into a jump - be more aggressive, reposition and herd those baddies.
if you jump right after inputting a melee dash attack, you can get even more speed and clear entire rooms, it's like a hyperdash. spike pits are fake (except for the enemies)
hold right-click, then tap left-click to either shield bash or swipe with the parrying dagger. shield bash can perma-stun enemies; dagger swipe automatically crits prone enemies - knock them over with a dash attack first.
the spellbooks are fantastic for AoE, combined with the Hunter's black hole ability you have your very own magical meatgrinder (Family-Friendly Edition)
the Knight is a runaway train of a bumper car, i like running double melee on her. greatsword's dash attack windup time is long enough that you travel the full distance of the hyperdash before absolutely cleaving whatever unfortunate souls (do skeletons have souls??) found on your selfmade train tracks.
the Mage and Rogue are fun too, every character is unique but i wanna keep it brief. thx

devs have said they'll focus on refining progression systems (making them more horizontal instead of vertical) which cleans up my biggest issue

This game uses Horizontal FOV, and not Vertical FOV, meaning it doesn't fully support ultrawidescreen. At 105 field of view(maxed) it looks like it's 50 fov in comparison. Just run the game in 16:9/21:9 for this reason.

For using higher video settings, this game chugs along for its post processing. I'm running on a 3090, and it was still unable to get up to 60fps. You can run it at Medium settings. Looks pretty good there too since its art lends to lower settings pretty well.

The perks and skills during the beginning are lacking. Although.. I've seen significantly better strides in other games making perks feel augmentative (really changes the gameplay just by having that said perk) in other games. For this, I really feel like they could do a lot to make the first time experience better in that regard. 

The gameplay feels slow. There are skills that make you move faster, but during combat it's very situational so I didn't find myself dashing around as much as I thought I would. The enemies you fight during the beginning are generally three archetypes; skeletons (melee/ranged), little guys that run at you, and mush-daddies(melee/magic). It's fine, ig. Arguably though, when looking at how it feels to attack enemies, I'm 50/50 on that. The melee feels really good imo, but as a hunter, something just felt really lacking. I think the animation for drawing arrows felt slow and it didn't feel like it had that [i]thwip[/i] you'd expect from it.

The audio feels like the design is good, but there are a few conflicts. For example, GUDs came out awkward after using dashes and after battles (this one particularly confused me; out of 10 rooms, like 3 of them which seemed normal got the special privilege of my guy saying something, which felt random to me). There wasn't any real punchy sounds which was probably by choice but it felt a little too static for my liking. When you use your ultimate (T) it didn't match up with the background music that well either. I just ended up skipping my ult for that reason. 

The art is absolutely gorgeous. The skills and how pretty they looked was really nice.

Ultimately, if you wanted a piece of art, this game does it. :) But, if you're looking for a fully fledged game I don't feel like I could recommend it at this time. It's going to take a lot of time before this feels like a full release, and it has so SO much potential that I'm going to be excited for it later. But for those on the fence; if you want a slow progression with repetitive gameplay that over time it evolves to something magical, maybe.. just maybe.. it might be worth the 50% off.

But in the meantime, keep following Beamdog's community posts until you start seeing tons of likes on them. And if you want to play with friends, yeah, it'd probably do for now if you just wanna shoot with the bois.

For the hopes of this game getting better, it gets a thumbs up. But really, in its current state, it's worth $15 just for the art, not the gameplay, the audio is also 50/50, and with an hour on this I really can't say anything about the story.

I don't normally write reviews, but this game made me so disappointed that i had to. I returned this game after only an hour and that was with me playing the game with a friend.

Let me start off by saying this game, even without the bugs, would not be good. The only ""saving grace"" this game has is it's theme. Beyond that though it falls flat in almost every regard in terms of a roguelike. I tried REALLY hard to like this game but I couldn't.


Combat: A horrible mess.
The combat and movement is extremely clunky, slow, and due to what i assume are bugs? There was many times where I'd attack an enemy and the attack would just do nothing. Literally had arrows passing through enemies and hitting the enemies behind them. Melee attacks whiffing at point blank range, etc.

Additionally, the enemy AI in this game is terrible. They will walk into walls, and sometimes just straight stand there looking at you and do nothing. Had one enemy once that just start spinning in place.

Enemy variation was also lacking. Granted i played for only an hour before returning it? I only saw two enemy types the entire time i played. Which essentially were just dudes who walked at you or threw stuff at you.

When the Enemies do act proper things can get rather frustrating. There are certain enemies that will knock you down if they hit you. The problem with this is, the time that it takes to stand back up? It has already hit you with another attack that knocks you back down.



Level Design: Repetitive. 
The level design in this game is extremely repetitive even for a roguelike. In an hour of playtime I saw the same exact level designs repeated multiple times. Even in separate chapters. 


Perks and Leveling: No meaningful choices.
The perks in this game are so uninspiring and bland. For an example your standard perk options are something along the lines of: ""Deal 20 more damage"" ""Your weapon now does Ice damage"" ""Heal for 1hp when defeating an enemy"" Not once did I run into any perks that I thought were engaging or build defining like other games in this genre. Nor did i find any perks that seemed to synergize that well. When I did find something that was remotely interesting it was so underwhelming that simply attacking normally was more efficient. 


Characters: Lacking. 
This is one area that I thought was going to be this games saving grace but I was wrong. I thought this game was going to be filled to the brim with character quips, and interactions that would be funny. But they were sadly silent for the most part. To me this is the biggest pain point for me in this game as it was the thing that sort of drew me in.",1701305429,1701306447,False,10,0,0.554956197738647461,1,True,False,False,True,,,

+The different playable characters feel genuinely different from each other and all seem to play well.

Cons:
-The first chapter is kinda lame. They say they're working on fixing it, but as of right now, you have to power through three levels of bs until you get to the much more fun stuff. EDIT: mostly fixed! Much better.
-A little buggy, a little residual jank. Some people report a ton of bugs, but I've only had enemies get stuck inside their spawn zones a few times. 
-Balancing. Not surprising, since it's just out, but how exactly is melee or archery anywhere near as effective as magic, for example?
-Light on content. There are only 9 levels, almost all of which are procedurally generated from a small set of rooms, and, as I said, the first 3 levels basically suck. EDIT: they increased the number of tilesets for the rooms, made them more interesting as a whole, and also made them less likely to spawn in repetitive ways. Huge improvement.

The dev has spoken about what they're working on in the near term, if not a full roadmap, so hopefully they continue working on and supporting it.

EDIT: they have fixed most of the cons in the most recent update! Specifically, the first 3 chapters are much better than before and feel much more dynamic/interesting, far less of a slog.",1701140435,1712351791,True,6,0,0.556494176387786865,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'm pleased to report that it exceeded my expectations.

Regarding Bugs:
I did encounter occasional setbacks, such as getting stuck on the floor with skeletons descending upon me from elevated positions. There were instances when my primary attack button didn't respond unless I initiated special powers to ""unstick"" my attacks.

While all games have their share of bugs, issues tend to be resolved over time. Admittedly, investing in a game with known bugs isn't an ideal gameplay experience. However, I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs so far—fingers crossed for continued smooth gameplay.

XP Leveling:
The game's approach to XP leveling might deter some players since in-level XP doesn't persist. Although you progress through stages and episodes, your level doesn't carry over when revisiting earlier episodes. Yet, the game doesn't solely rely on in-level levels or XP. Strength is gained by collecting glyphs, gems, and gold, creating a prolonged and challenging grind.

You advance through Armory/Sun Disc Tiers, acquiring weapons and enhancing stats with gems. The learning curve may initially suggest a straightforward Hack/Slash style, but it requires subtle strategy, especially when playing solo on higher difficulties. Environmental utilization and precise timing become crucial.

Nostalgia:
The game boasts beautiful graphics, fluid animations, and seamlessly integrated mechanics. Co-op mode adds a humorous touch to the experience, delivering on the promised Saturday Morning Cartoon vibe. Similar to classic 80s/90s games, restarting from the beginning upon death can be frustrating, but understanding the mechanics improves with progression.

Replayability and Final Thoughts:
Every playthrough or replay offers a unique experience as each stage is randomly generated. The increasing difficulty requires extensive grinding to prove your worth. In my first day of play, I dedicated a solid 10 hours to the game. Despite its initial toughness, the grind proves immensely fulfilling, with each hour spent feeling worthwhile. The absence of a paywall for cosmetics is a definite positive. Whether you team up with friends for added fun or embark on a solo grind to showcase your prowess, MythForce offers a compelling and rewarding gaming experience.",1700922354,1700922354,True,167,1,0.909026622772216797,1,True,False,False,True,,,

I played a little bit solo just to test it out and had enough fun that I recommended it to my friends. After a 5 hour play session, we all wanted to come back for more. 
Cons:
The lobby/permanent upgrade menus could use a little bit more guidance, it was not completely obvious that the buildings in the background of the lobby were upgrade shops and I think they could use some signage so you don't have to click through them trying to remember what is where.
The difficulty jumps up in chunks, you will obliterate enemies in one room and then potentially get slaughtered like cattle in the next.
Needs a more room variation per tile set. There are multiple areas in the game with their own aesthetic but within each area it feels like you see the same 6 rooms infinitely.
Pros:
This is a fantastic co-op experience! Lobbies were easy to set up and manage, we had little to no connection problems.
The characters and abilities all feel unique, satisfying and good in their roles.
The in game dialogue between the characters is fun and adds a lot of flavor to the game.
Do yourself a favor, pick Maggie's ice tome, hold down the attack button, profit.

Right off the bat I have encountered some bugs that prevented me from attacking. It happens when shooting a bow. I managed to unfreeze my character by spamming abilities and eventually I could use normal attacks.

As far as I know with my little time with the game, there is no customisation or perma loot / equipment. Characters are pre-defined which is fine I guess but it would have been better to make your own hero.
I haven't seen any inventory aside from character screen and any loot that drops is replaced by a new one. This for me is a deal breaker. A dungeon crawler with no cool loot aside from minor upgrades ( like boots that give 5% more movement speed ).... now I get it it's also a roguelike but this could have been done better. Many games in the genre offer some sort of reward that players can either carry over to the next run or unlock better perma equipment and the starting area. 

Another minor gripe is the fact that any loot does not show on your character.

Sostanzialmente il grosso dei problemi del gioco sono problemi tecnici che una volta risolti renderanno il gioco molto godibile e divertente.

E questo ci porta al punto due.. Definirei questo un prodotto di nicchia che per gli amanti del genere cresciuti in quegli anni è immancabile.

Docelowo traktowany jako produkcja kooperacyjna, 
gdzie mamy zebrać kilku chętnych znajomych, 
wcielić się w dość sztampowych herosów i stawić 
czoło nikczemnemu zagrożeniu. Zabawa solo oczywiście 
też jest możliwa, choć gra wtedy dużo traci na swoim 
uroku. Mythforce miało wyglądać jak spełnienie marzeń 
ludzi którzy wychowali się na rakich animacjach jak 
He-Man czy Thundercats. Film wprowadzający z wyjątkowo 
kiczowatym brzmieniem, to była muzyka dla mych uszu. 
Nawet jeśli nie do końca wiedziałem, o co w nim tak 
naprawdę chodzi. Było żywcem przeniesione ze wspomnianych 
bajkowych hitów. Do wyboru cztery archetypy postaci. 
Wojowniczka, łucznik, łotrzyk i czarodziejka. 
Każdy ze swoimi specjalnymi zdolnościami. 
Jedna rzuca tarczą niczym Kapitan Ameryka, 
a inna wyczarowuje sokoła walczącego u jej boku.
Całość dzieli się na epizody, a ukończenie jednego 
z nich sprawia, że nie musimy tam ponownie wracać. 
Progresja nietypowa dla ""roguelitów"", ale jak 
najbardziej zrozumiała biorąc pod uwagę długość 
takiej epizodycznej przygody składającej się 
z kilkunastu aren - około 40 min. Bo i na arenach się 
całość opiera. Tu akurat fani gatunku doskonale wiedzą, 
o co chodzi. Nie przyjdzie im wybierać nagród za pokonanie 
pomieszczenia, ale nie straszne im te ciasne przestrzenie. 
W każdej z nich czekają nas kolejne fale wrogów 
i tak aż do mety. Problem w tym, że różnorodności 
tu niewiele.  Pokoje są nudne. Skrzynie leżą w tych 
samych miejscach, wrogowie wyłażą z tych samych dziur, 
a i tymi wszystkimi murami idzie się srogo wynudzić.
Co pokój wybieramy sobie perki, ale to przeważnie 
ten nudny zestaw procentowo zwiekszający nam 
statystyki. Ziewanie jest trudne do zastopowania. 
Tym bardziej że system walki ma nie tyle wyczuwalny 
aromat drewna, co przysiadając do Mythforce’a, 
jesteśmy generycznym bobrem z Tajemnicy Wiklinowej 
Zatoki, niżeli He-Manem, którego nam obiecywano.
Pod kontem graficznym jest na prawdę bardzo dobrze.
Stylizacja animacji, wygląd przeciwników oraz otoczenia
robi wrażenie. Inaczej jest z oprawą dźwiękową.
Dźwięki strzałów, wybuchów oraz czarów są tak płytkie,
że czasami ciężko jest je usłyszeć, a muzyka kompletnie
nie pasuje do gry. Powolna, generyczna i nudna.
Podejrzewam, że gdyby zabrał się za to bardziej 
utalentowany zespół z większym budżetem to mógłby być
hit. A tak mamy całkowicie średnią produkcję.

So far the different classes feel nice, quite well balanced and each is fun to handle in their own right.
(have not tried out multiplayer yet and the next patch should improve that so might wait for that patch, so it is well playable as well in solo mode)
Each run takes about 30 minutes which feels nice enough length wise, not too long, not too short.

The melee combat takes a bit of getting used to as the reach of certain weapons like victorias mace feels a bit short so I missed a lot of swings as it feels like I need to stand right up to the enemy before being able to hit them, but is manageable, but I have found myself relying on the bow on those chars a lot as well.

Also encountered a bug I think where the attack would not start charging up again after just releasing a max attack, but could work around it.

The energy management feels nice at this moment, the added extra energy makes it quite usable and is forgiving if one messes up at the start. (yes you can not keep blasting or swinging but need to use the terrain as well in a tactical manner to not run out of energy)

The game is quite forgiving, nice 80's cartoon vibe, a lot of upgrades can be found everywhere.

For the grinding part, this is a roguelite and I can see that it will take many runs to get things at higher tier like the weapons, trinkets, cards one finds as well as the constellation (stat boost for the characters).
Edit : got pretty far with upgrades but for an ultimate build the grind will be quite extensive especially for the constellation, everything else seems manageable, but perhaps a shared coin and gem stash for the chars would help out so one can use a favorite char to boost a less favorite one.

As I am planning to play this game off and on in short bursts and the characters even without upgrades are well playable at least for the first levels and the few upgrades I bought started spawning in the world I felt a bit of progression. 

Edit : The lower levels of the thicket are pretty boring layout wise but once one hits the dungeons and castle the maps are more interesting, combat is basic but fun enough especially on harder difficulties where one is forced to rely on ones specials more.

If this game is on sale, and especially if the next patch has dropped as well, why not give it a try for a fun fling with or without friends.",1698621190,1699063532,True,7,1,0.556818187236785889,1,True,False,False,True,,,

Aber nun zum Spiel selbst. Grafisch her, wie es ja schon in der Beschreibung selbst steht, erinnert es an die damaligen 80iger Cartoons, He-Man oder Thundercats usw. Also noch meine Kindheitszeit (XD). Insgesamt finde ich das stimmig und das hat mich sogar gereizt es weiter zu spielen.

Solche ""Shooter"" sind normal nicht meins, aber ich musste zugeben, es hat Spaß gemacht. Besonders als ich die Figur fand, mit der ich am Besten klar kam. Da ich keinen Controller habe, spielte ich mit Tastatur und Maus. Die Anordnung der Buttons ist etwas Gewöhnungsbedürftig, kann man aber auch anpassen.

So was ich mit meiner begrenzten Testzeit heraus gefunden habe, ist größtenteils Positiv. Es gibt ein paar Punkte, an denen in meinen Augen noch gearbeitet werden sollte. Zum Beispiel, auch wenn ich größtenteils ohne MP gespielt habe, verliert das Spiel hin und wieder die Verbindung, auch wenn die Internetverbindung lokal (GigabitLAN) wunderbar funktioniert und kaum ausgelastet ist. Ich kam mit dem Fortschritt des Spiels einigermaßen zurecht, aber auch selbst bei Leicht zieht der Schwierigkeitsgrad echt schnell an, ohne das entsprechende Items zur Heilung usw kommen. Ich denke hier könnte am Balancing (schwere Sache, das ist mir selbst aus einem anderen Projekt bekannt) noch gearbeitet werden.

Das Spiel hat meiner Meinung nach potenzial und wenn daran weiter gearbeitet wird, könnte das mehr als was Gutes werden! In meinen Augen aber auch jetzt schon soweit spielbar, wenn auch noch Luft nach oben da ist.",1697016589,1697016589,True,2,0,0.51327437162399292,0,False,True,False,True,,,

For negatives: the enemy/player balance feels off like it doesn't scale to the player count, bleeding out and dying is too fast and boring for fewer than 3 players and meta progression is relied on too heavily for loot to start becoming interesting.

The game does look great though and when loot gets interesting, it really adds a cool risk/reward element to the game. There's enough content and challenge at the moment to make me want to keep playing. It feels like a game that'll shine if you can get a full group on voice good chat and music playing.

We need dinosaurs, voice lines for standard enemies and multiple paths so I'm hoping there's plans for a lot more development. The game really does feel like it was made for 4 players so if you can, I would wait for a sale and try to convince friends to grab the game or split a 4 pack on sale from Humble. You can join or have random people drop into your games but you then run the risk of encountering loot goblins.

Good game that just needs friends and some quality of life stuff work!

Probably closest in genre to games like Vermintide, but here you play a 80s comic character attempting to tackle the vampire lord Deadalus over nine levels of progressively harder room-by-room dungeon crawling.

The graphics, the voice acting, and even the cartoon intro for the game are perfectly evocative of the era the developers lovingly draw from, while still maintaining a surprisingly deep combat system, with cooldowns, stamina management, ultimate abilities, and a soft rogue-like game loop that will have you revisiting some of the same levels for more gold, more upgrade gems, and more unlock glyphs.

Which leads to the only real complaints one might have of the game - that you could easily want more episodes to play. Right now the path to a ""full build"" requires millions of gold and possibly hundreds of gems. While progression early on feels very good, the late game gets a little bit grindy. Hopefully the company is planning more episodes to come.

For $30, I felt like I got exactly what I wanted - a love letter to my childhood coupled with a game I could sink a hundred hours into. As a bonus, the company seems particularly checked-in with responding to the game's playerbase and is rolling out patches quickly as bugs are discovered.

I bought it once and returned it, but promised friends I would try it with them. At first glance, the visuals promise a colorful, exciting cartoon adventure but the experience is boring and bland.

Stamina: the game would be better if the stamina mechanic were completely removed. All these comments are true at launch, and after their 20% stamina buff. The game forces you to play at a slower pace, making action a tedious wait. I've never been so bored in a battle. The only real way to play is nursing your stamina and kiting enemies if you are a melee hero. If you run out of stamina you can't run, fight, block, etc. so if you aren't watching your stamina then prepare for a self-induced stun-lock of exhaustion. At higher difficulties, exhaustion is a death sentence. The way stamina is treated would be bad enough as is, but if one weighs the stamina economy against the damage you can do, Prepare to need 3-4 critical headshots with the archer to take down a generic grunt, multiply that by the a couple enemies each wave and a couple waves per room and you realize you just spent 30 minutes waiting to kill an enemy. If you saw combat from the trailer, you might think that combat was exciting - I don't believe they would have sold a single copy if they left a complete engagement in the video instead of a quick clash.

Characters: the heroes are distinct, their skills all kind of overlap in use just because there's so little dynamism to combat. The melee characters are much higher risk, ranged characters are clearly the safer choice,

Dungeons: repetitive, simplistic tiles with little functional variation. You'll clear a mob of enemies only to have another wave drop in on you. Sometimes enemies get stuck at entrances and you have to hunt them down.

Sound: I would return the game over how poorly the sound is implemented. Enemy footsteps get quiet the further away they are, but at a rate that means I don't think the game plays the sound cue if they're out of melee range. The music is samey and repetitive (you can easily hear were the loops are). Spatial sound like Dolby Atmos really struggles to make the sound mean anything. This game is the audio equivalent of a grey smear of noise.

De set-up van het spel is eenvoudig te begrijpen, ook voor de mensen die niet bekend zijn met dit type spellen.

Deze abilities worden niet helemaal duidelijk uitgelegd, dus het is even uitvinden wat alles precies doet. Tijdens de dungeons krijg je loot en perks die jouw karakter sterker kunnen maken of het leven net een beetje makkelijker.

En speel je dit spel met vrienden dan kan je niet te gretig zijn met het oppakken van healthpotions, want deze zijn schaars en voor iedereen hard nodig. In de Citadel kan je jouw perks, skills en wapens upgraden, maar op het eerste oog een lijkt een flinke grind nodig te zijn om jouw held echt sterk te krijgen.

Dit vooruitzicht op eindeloze grinds door de dungeons, hoe uitdagend en afwisselend ze ook kunnen zijn, maakt dat ik mijzelf dit niet uren of dagenlang zie spelen. Wel denk ik dat het spel heel geschikt is voor een gezellige game avond met vrienden.

Still no matchmaking: Online is still unplayable if you're not host, and clicking 'Quick Play' still puts you in a random quest.

Do the math.

After 40+ hours of grinding I am barely half way to ""maxing"" 1 of the 4 character's. Yet you can see everything the game has to offer and complete the whole story in just a few. 

All costs need to be reduced by 75% - 80%. All difficulties should unlock after completing the story on any difficulty. Shards and Gold should be shared between characters.

Several of those reviews point out that you lose all progress between missions. That's simply not true. This is a roguelite. There's both in-mission progression that only lasts through the current mission, and there's permanent progression that carries over between missions.

The in-level progression consists of a variety of pickups/buffs that improve your weapons, skills, and grant special passive effects. The pickups have 4 tiers of quality, but you will need to improve your permanent progression in order to get the higher tier upgrades. 

As stated, the permanent progression increases your chances of finding higher tier upgrades during a mission. Additionally, you can improve your damage, your resistances, your speed, etc. You can also unlock cosmetic stuff in the permanent progression system like new outfits, emotes, and voice lines for the characters.

There are currently 9 missions, but each mission has several levels of difficulty. (some of which need to be unlocked) The missions are procedurally generated. It seems that the first 3 missions are a bit lacking in variety, but the other 6 seem to be way better. This might change on harder difficulties. (I haven't made enough progression to do those yet)

Though it seems somewhat weird, the characters can mix things up by equipping a small variety of weapon sets. (rogues can equip spell books, mages can equip melee weapons) However, you can only take two sets with you per mission. You can also upgrade these weapon sets with permanent progression.

Though there are complaints that the devs didn't listen to anything during EA, they did make a few significant changes that were especially helpful. I think that they really dropped the ball on tutorials, but if you've played similar games (Gunfire Reborn, RoboQuest) it shouldn't take you long to pick up.

There's also complaints of a lack of content. There are only 9 levels and 4 heroes at the moment, but it sounds like the devs plan to continue adding to the game over time.

No one that I've played with has had any performance complaints. No crashes. No in-game glitches that have interrupted play. There is a weird visual glitch for some folks that looks like there's a dirt overlay on the screen. A workaround is to set your graphics settings to the LOW profile, (this disables the overlay) then drag the quality sliders where you want them. (devs have stated that they are working on a fix for this as of this review)

I recommend the game, but I'm a bit hesitant at the $30 price tag. I'd absolutely buy it again at $30, but I feel that some folks might not feel that there's enough content to be worth it at that price. The Humble Bundle Store currently has a deal for 50% off of a 4 pack, which comes out to $15 a person.

I've very much enjoyed this game, especially with friends. The perks feel impactful, the meta-progression feels VERY impactful, and the general tome of the game is very fun. 

The soundtrack is excellent, and a lot of the visuals are both clear and visually pleasing.

What I mean by this is that it resembles (obviously) the aesthetics of an 80's cartoon. The way they outlined interactive objects, enemies, and allies makes them look like figures on a backdrop. This help you distinguish very quickly and easily between what's important and what is not.

There ARE a few drawbacks: 

1. Bugs. Not anything gamebreaking so far (16ish hours in), just a few minor bugs. Inability to access some shrines and such (fixed by switching weapons or using an ability), fell through the floor once (my movement ability returned me to the map). So, nothing GIANT, but enough to notice, and be annoyed by.

2. Lack of labeling of the hub areas building. I've played with several friends, and it seems counter-intuitive that we can click on the buildings in the background city (at first). 

3. Why is my party option automatically set to public? I don't want strangers joining my game. Without some kind of ingame chat, it feels highly impersonal and awkward. 'Friends only would be a much better option in my opinion.


Those three items comprise my main complaints. None of them are deal-breakers, and they all seem like things that can be relatively easy fixes (I understand how complicated fixing bugs can get, but this is already in a better state than, say, the average Bethesda game). Also, they've already dropped a hot fix patch to fix some of the bugs, and that's a good sign.

Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially with friends. Plenty of value here for the price!",1695071773,1695071773,True,4,1,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False,True,,1700583765.0,"Hey, thanks a lot for your review. It helped improve the game and make it better.

The issue noted below with hit registration with magical attacks seems to have been largely resolved! Please disregard that below as it seems fixed :)

Mythforce is a great little title, with a hopefully bright future ahead of it.

It's a co-op roguelike with a cracking art style. I often see 'melee focused' mentioned when talking about this, but I think that depends on what character you play as, as of the four currently in the game  two are melee, and two are ranged focused.

You journey through 3 sets of  levels in each biome, of which there are 3 with a selection of secrets smattered through, and a boss/horde/special encounter at the end. It starts slow as the first sort of half of the game is very easy, but once the enemies start displaying some slightly different behavior the game becomes A LOT of fun, especially with a friend or two in tow.

Progression is drawn out nicely, without being too long to feel unrewarding, and the weapons feel decent. 

There are some hit registration issues however currently particularly with the mage character, which has been identified as a netcode issue and is expected to be rectified shortly. This issue does not seem to exist when soloing, or if whoever plays mage is hosting the session though.",1695042430,1702642752,True,8,1,0.548022627830505371,1,True,False,False,True,,,

I was initially leery of grabbing it due to mixed reviews, but I quickly picked up on the fact that if you sort by ""hours played"" anything over 1 hour was ""overwhelmingly positive"". Folks either bounce off the 80s cartoon vibe and don't get it, or they stay and really enjoy it for what it is. I happened to be one of the latter.

The premise is straightforward—you can play solo or as a part of a colorful fantasy team of warriors (very Masters of the Universe) that defend the land of Eldryth. The game this reminds me most of is something like Vermintide, but instead of static maps it has procedurally generated dungeons assembled from a rooms themed by chapter with usually a midpoint miniboss and a final bigger encounter. Every 3 ""episodes"" (aka levels) or so you fight one of the Big Bosses who usually give you some cheesy dialogue about how you'll never defeat them and backstory (like who they are rivals with etc).

It is a roguelite (something like Hades) where the runs take between 20 mins for earlier episodes, and maybe 40-50 minutes for the later ones. This means you have to restart your build each episode (level) and have some ways to boost your starting stuff or what's accessible to build from between each outing.

Network connectivity was straightforward (it uses peer-to-peer and I had no lag with my friends even though some of us are hundreds of miles away). They really nailed the graphics and I love the voice acting. The cartoons they have for each chapter are fantastic, and I love the music.

At first the game felt a bit simplistic, but that's mostly playing on normal. The AI seems rudimentary, and there isn't a ton of nuance obvious. But every time you beat a level you can play one difficulty higher. And mythic is no joke. You're quickly learning to watch for those incoming attack prompts, keep an eye on archers to dodge as they fire, and those rudimentary AIs become a whole lot more threatening when you can't drop them in 2-3 easy swings and you have to kite one and use cover to regenerate enough stamina to get a charge and big hit in on the archer sniping you. Suddenly whether your power attack will knock something down, or where you're hitting with that attack (back, head, body) becomes a bit more important.

So I'd say it's great for some casual players who want to soak up some vibes and dialogue, and spend 20-30 hours with friends just goofing off and having a good time, but you can definitely crank it up and challenge yourself a bit. There's even some advanced progression and  some resource grind for folks that want to get absolutely everything. The first group will enjoy those hand-painted backgrounds in the crypt levels, and finding secret passages, and hidden treasure, and the second will appreciate the difference in split second management of heavy vs light attacks, perfect blocks, and your friend who can land those headshots for crits over your shoulder.

If I have one complaint it's that I would love more episodes and characters. But for a small indie studio, and a $30 game, this is about right. If they have DLC planned, they have me and my crew's money for sure.

All in all, I greatly recommend the game. I'm a big fan of those old timey cartoons and I love the vibes they put into this, so me and my friends are sort of dead center of their target audience.

Örnek vermek gerekirse, ilkinde silahınıza ateş hasarı ekleme veya vuruşlarda harcadığı manayı azaltma gibi şeyler çıkarken ikincisinde karakterinizin maks canını arttırma veya daha hızlı hareket etmesini sağlama benzeri şeyler çıkıyor.
Aynı zamanda oyunda açtığınız sandıklardan veya kestiğiniz yaratıklardan item düşebiliyor. Bunlarda yine sizi güçlendirmeye yarayan şeyler kalıcı değiller her bölümde ne düşerse onu kullanabiliyorsunuz sadece.

4 adet oynanabilir karakter mevcut belki ilerde sayısı artabilir. klasik olarak gidersek savaşçı, okcu, büyücü ve rogue. Her birinin kendine has güzel yetenekleri mevcut. Ek olarak her karakter yanında 2 adet silah taşıyabiliyor bunlar arasında istediniz zaman geçiş yaparak ağır ve ya normal saldırılar gerçekleştirebiliyorsunuz.

Oyunda bir de hideout diyebileceğimiz bir bölge var burası oyuna ilk başladığınız zaman yıkık dökük olan bir yer. Siz oyun içinde ilerledikçe çıkardığınız materyaller ile geliştirdiğiniz bir alan. Bu bölgeyi ne kadar çok geliştirirseniz siz de bir o kadar gelişiyorsunuz çünkü kalıcı olarak silahlarını güçlendirme, aldığınız perklerin ve çıkan itemlerin tierini arttırma alanları mevcut.

Even the music is on point and stays true to the 80's cartoon theme. But the game feels like is missing something and can very repetitive. The controls feel a bit sluggish and slow at times.

The combat while not better than the Vermintide games is still engaging and interesting.
Level design is decent sadly the procedural generation is a bit disappointing, only four or less hours into the game and we can already spot repeats for the level layouts.
There is four different classes each with their own abilities to ensure good replayability.
The game can be played in co-op but is also perfectly playable solo.

Honestly MythForce is a very competent game, it's far from perfect but it is well worth checking out if you enjoy dungeon crawling with rogue lite elements.

Issues that ultimately prevent me from recommending the game as of its current state.

Multiplayer suffers a bulk of the issues. The game is peer-to-peer, but this game’s P2P is unstable all the time. I play other P2P games with my friends and those games are nowhere near this game’s instability. Perk/Smith shrines bug out for non-host players, mobs stutter about making range attacks difficult to lead and land, you’re never sure how close a mob actually is before it's too late to evade, the lobby can just suddenly break down and you can only invite half of your group back for whatever reason. 

The roguelike aspect of the game is a bit too grindy. After every run you get these glyphs that can be used to upgrade your town’s facilities. Armory (makes your starter gear stronger), constellation (allows you to slot gems and increase your base stats), emporium (allows you to find higher tier versions of trinkets), and conclave (allows you the ability to acquire a higher tier version of perks.) The amount of glyphs you get on the available difficulty is chump change after that first upgrade. My point being; expect to only get tier 2 of glass cannon for the longest eternity from biome 1 to 3 and still waiting in ng+. 

Melee combat feels uncomfortable, weak, and risky . Range is just the best of all worlds, even with the latency issue. When trying to switch to your off-hand or vice versa the game will eat the input, and it does this often. There are not enough variant tile sets per biome. You could easily see the same long center staircase leading into a big rectangle room four times in the same 40 minute run. The mob variety basically comes to an end at biome 2 of 3. The bosses of each biome are set, meaning there is only one. Dollar tree He-man monster, Hextar the necromage, and Deadaless the vampire BBEG. That is it. 

I enjoy parts of the game but I just cannot recommend it in its current state. I might play a little more with my friends if they wish to dive back into this lumpy pool.

Power attacks can knock enemies out of their attack animations, and light attacks are quick and easy to get away with.

Mythforce is my first game in this genre. I normally play very little MP but I found this game to be fairly fun in multiplayer. I tried it solo too but that wasn't as much fun of course. The artwork is stellar! For older peeps like myself who did indeed grow up with the cartoons this game draw inspiration from, I salut their effort. It feels unique and fresh, which is funny considering it's a 40 year old style. 

Overall I think the game needs some more polish. The controls could be tighter, the classes and skills more interesting, but I hope they build on this and maybe add-on more later with DLCs.

The aesthetic is fantastic and hits an amazing point of nostalgia, but it definitely covers up some slower, somewhat repetitive gameplay especially once you get to the higher difficulty tiers. Even at Mythic I, I spent as much time just running from enemies while my stamina slowly recovered, turned, landed a hit, then went back to scurrying because the enemy HP outscales your ability to damage it so quickly when you start out a level. 
That drawback being said, I still enjoy the game and plan to put more time into it. I feel like I am chasing a dragon for a good build though, and there are no dragons - currently the levels feel too short to put together a truly overpowered build and putting together a truly overpowered build is one of the hallmarks of the roguelike/lite genre. 
So far, each time I finish a floor, I walk through the exit feeling like my build is just barely about to start coming together, without the change to really use that build before I start the next floor and I start out at zero again.
A mode where you can chain floors together so you can put together more of a build would be a fantastic add (though given the pre-release was 3 floors chained and they removed that, I feel that isn't the direction they are going). 
Still, for a good bit of Saturday Morning Nostalgia with some friends, you could definitely do worse.

The style of the game is tremendous with the old school cartoon vibes, great characters, voice acting and music but that's about it.

When it comes to gameplay it flops incredibly. 
-Hit detection is awful, especially with charge attacks if your charge attack doesn't get stopped by some random pixel.
-The stamina system is just atrociously bad. You are being bombarded by waves on waves of enemies each of them taking a lot of hits to take down so you have to just wait it out and regen which just sucks. 
-Waves are too long.
-Enemies have insanely high HP which makes them feel ""bullet spongy""
-The meta progression is straight up bad. If you want better items or perks you have to upgrade with a currency that is super scarce and you also have to get the upgrades with gold and this grind is just too much for some really minor upgrades.

This feels more like an Early Access game now then it did when it initially released into EA. I'd say wait for updates and a deep sale.

(For Context: As of review time, I have beaten 4 levels, and shall update one I finish the rest.)

Mythforce has the look and graphically works well within the idea of it being a TV show from the 80's or so, character design wise look like they'd easily fit in, and the games opening cinematic has a lovely nostalgic feel to it, with a tune I find somewhat addictive, honestly this was originally the thing that got me interested in the game.

Character wise we have 4 to pick from, Tank, Mage, Ranger, Rogue. Each bring their own abilities with them and feel different enough to warrant experimenting with. The characters have some personality, but personally, I feel a bit more could of been done with them, maybe make them a bit cheesier, give it that proper old school feel with how they speak, also some more lines would of been good, as I constantly hear the same lines within 30 seconds (Note: Apparently the characters ""bark"" less now according to the 1st hotfix, however I didn't notice that much of a difference on my end, still seemed too often).

Loading into the game, you're hit with a wall of text as your ""tutorial"", having a small level to help introduce players into the game and explaining how things work would of been a better choice, but either way, you'll get the info you need to get going.

Being a Rogue-like similar to Gunfire Reborn, as you progress you'll gain perks to level your hero, normally having 3 options for you to pick from, they will reset per run and you can set up your character in weird and wonderful ways.

The Combat is basic in nature and sadly, currently, feels somewhat clunky, movement and attacking just feels a bit off, like it needs a bit more speed to it, enemies so far haven't had much variation and can feel very sponge-like taking damage, I've not felt challenged particularly, but on the odd time enemies have cornered me or some such, it just feels more tedious than fun to deal with them, I've had the odd enemy glitch into the floor or shoot to the sky as well, as I've progressed into following levels, I was seeing more of the same enemies already, just with bigger health bars and higher damage, I'd of expected *some* variation in the first few levels at least, but I could be being overly picky on that front.

So far, the constellation system for upgrading yourself personally seems slightly pointless, I understand it will take multiple runs to upgrade it properly, but so far, it just feels like it will be a tedious task, knowing that I have to grind out crystals to upgrade, regardless, you'll get options to boost defence, damage, reduce cool-downs and such, you also have a store to buy weapons, outfits, emotes and voice lines, some of that stuff is overpriced in my opinion, but i suppose they need to try and encourage replayability.

As no friends have purchased the game yet, my only experience of online has been me joining on a random game, and having someone random join me, and so far, it's very much been a bad experience, despite my internet being decent, having constant lag or ping issues made it irritating, also seemingly only having quick play and no option to look for rooms or specific missions to join feels silly in a game that seems to push the co-op as a major selling point.

The first big boss was a fine fight, nothing to write home about, I loved how the game used the main theme in a remix, giving it a nice feel, but after beating it, I didn't feel fulfilled, I just felt like it was time to stop playing for a bit, as it was just an OK experience.

Overall currently, that's the problem for me with this game, it's just...OK, and lately, the gaming community has been constantly served great or amazing games,  feeling OK or just passable isn't enough now, this game needs work if it wants to stand out, it needs love from its dev team and it needs to start putting the right foot forward, this game COULD be great, it could be like the great cartoons that you love to come back to and view again and again, but for now, it's just a re-run at 6am on a random channel when most people are asleep, sure, some might catch it, but one it hits 7, the real good shows start.

I truly hope that as I progress in the game, my feelings will change and I can change this review to positive, however I doubt that, not until more work has been put into the game, I'd advise waiting for a sale as it stands for now.

Good: Art style; intro song; roguelike/lite for replay-ability (only good if you like/understand this game type. some people dislike this game type)

Bad: Combat could be more interesting; AI is simple; maps are repetitive, town UI is pretty horrible and took me a second to realize I could interact with the buildings.

Mixed Feedback:
There is ""build"" variety in the gem/constellation system, and some control over your roguelite runs with affinity system to influence gear and upgrades. Armory system lets you change up primary/secondary weapon and level up damage for your selected build type, but this all feels mostly generic and could use some extra style to make each build stand out change how the character is played completely (something like a speed build, or a tank build, or a ranged build, utility build, etc.)

The game is fun and engaging enough, but lacking something to make it really hook the players. Would be great for couch co-op or in an actual arcade. It is missing an ""excitement"" feel to it though. There were no times when I was running with a group where it felt like we had to strategize or felt amazing for beating a boss or hard encounter. We just ran around and hit things till they died. More development may help this game really stand out, and I feel a lot of love for the 80s in this with the art style and it is fairly polished for what it is, but it needs time to grow, which I hope it will.",1694624282,1694626071,True,4,1,0.543957948684692383,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Si tratta di un roguelite diviso in livelli e ogni livello è diviso in ""stanze"" o arene se preferite, dove arrivano nemici a ondate, finita la stanza si passa alla successiva. Tra una stanza e l'altra ci possono essere negozi o tesori vari e metà livello c'è un Boss, a fine livello invece, per adesso ho visto solo nemici elite. Come ogni gioco di questo genere, i potenziamenti che si trovano sono casuali, ma posso dire che fino ad ora non ne ho trovato nessuno inutile, anzi. Durante il gioco si raccolgono delle gemme e i soldi, che restano anche in caso di sconfitta. Notate bene che morite nel secondo livello, ripetete solo quello, non vi dovete rifare tutto daccapo.  Le gemme servono per potenziare varie skill e i soldi per acquistare o potenziare equipaggiamento. Ci sono 4 classi tra cui scegliere, ognuna si tiene i propri soldi, ma le gemme si accumulano per tutti e anche la progressione dei livelli è comune, ovvero e finite il primo livello con la guerriera, al secondo potete andarci con l'arcere. E' evidente che la componente melee è presa da Vermintide ed è divertente, i nemici sono un po' legnosi a volte i combattimenti risultano un po' lenti e impacciati a causa più dei nemici che di come si muove il vostro personaggio che invece si comporta molto bene. Comunque mi sento di promuoverlo.

2. 80's cartoons. Do I even need to explain this?
Now, as I went through the reviews here on steam, I assumed that a bunch if kids tried this game and failed.
If we go through main complaints:
1. Uses Epic Games - well...no. It only uses Epic Online Services (EOS), not the launcher. You can hate Epic Games Launcher for whatever reason, but I see no issue with using EOS. 
2. ThE pRoGrEsS iS nOt sAveD afTeR eAcH rUn - do you even know what a roguelite is? You do some runs by using everything you can get during the run just to get to the finishing line. Once the run is over you use resources you found (shards, glyphs, gold...whatever) to upgrade your heroes in the main hub. The upgrades include weapons, trinkets, perks, items...You also have some cosmetics to buy. 
3. Not rewarding runs, perks have no effect - you gather resources to upgrade yourself as I stated previously. And traits do have an effect of combined properly. If you take a melee, but you are using a bow, of course that trait will be useless. 
4. Repetitive loop - I can agree the game needs a bit a more level variety, but it is still fun.

Haha, okay, seriously.  I like the game.  I'm gonna tell you about the game, and then I'm gonna talk about a couple things I see people don't like.  It's my opinion, leave a clown or something or just scream in the comments, I'm cool either way.

What it is is a first-person melee game.  That's like a first person shooting game, except the ranges are really low.  Like, y'know, melee.  Short range hack-and-slash.  It's a whole lot less of ""put reticule on bad guy and click"" and a whole lot more ""get close enough to do that reticule thing.""

There's a couple characters that do more ranged stuff.  Couldn't tell you much, I've been playing the swashbuckler-guy exclusively.  My wife's been using the paladork lady, because being a big meatwall with a shield is her jam.  It's cool.

We've been streaming it on alternate accounts, so I've got more time on this game than you think.

The playstyle is more methodical, rewarding good positioning and being aware of the enemies.  And flailing away with attacks can get punished, so you need to keep your attacks measured and even.  Getting hit in the back does a lot more damage, and with no radar you really need to keep looking around.  There's a brief ""you are about to get hit from this direction"" symbol, which is your only clue you're going to get walloped.  The game will end you quickly if you're inattentive or impatient.  I rather like this.

It's got ""roguelike"" elements, where progressive playthroughs let you unlock benefits which permanently upgrade your character.  If you enjoy a bit of snark, you can replace skill with persistence.

What it looks like is cel-shaded.  It's trying to be ""Saturday-morning cartoons"" and I can believe it, except Saturday-morning cartoons never had a framerate this smooth, or for that matter, looked this nice.  When I was a child and watching cartoons, they were flat-out rubbish.  I watched them anyway.

Another thing that makes it suitably Saturday-morning cartoon is the plot, and the voice-acting.  It's one thing to be a mediocre voice talent doing a cartoon (writes the guy who is a mediocre, *at best*, voice talent) but it's another to ape that style convincingly.  It's very, very difficult to be a believably so-so actor on purpose.  Which means they're great.

There's also a plot, revealed in tiny dribs and drabs, about some guy named ""Deadalus"" (this name is brilliant, seriously) who has an army of undead and other things that... I'm not sure, villainy no doubt.  But a plucky band of heroes will foil their plan every Saturday morning, I'm sure.

Okay, finally, coop.  Right?  If you've read my reviews, you know I love this stuff.  Parties came together smoothly, gameplay was had.  Excellent.

A couple sticking points:  The game kind of throws you right in there with just a couple static screens of tutorial to explain the works.  Truth be told, it doesn't really need it, except maybe to explain what the super-powerup-MythForce attack does.  You stab (or shoot) bad guys.  You try to avoid getting hit.

Arrows kind of come from out of nowhere, and exposure to spellcasters doesn't come 'til mostly through the first dungeon sequence.  The solution for all of the above is to keep moving, pretty much, but my first encounter was unpleasant to say the least.

Areas in the first mission have been a bit samey.  There's perhaps six or eight rooms, though they'll arrange them so you come in from different doors.  But you soon realize where the hidden loot is.  So a little variety mightn't go amiss.

Some people have moaned about ""EOS"", confusing ""Epic Online Services"" with the Epic Game Store (which is abbreviated EGS but come on, people).  It's an Unreal Engine Game.  It's going to have EOS.  It doesn't make you buy games from their store, it installs itself once, and it lets you play with people pretty smoothly.  I'm no fan of their game store at all, and have snubbed it so hard the only game I bought there I bought again on Steam, but let's get our facts together here, eh?

Anyway, a game that rewards patience and positioning, runs great, and is a bit cheesy?  It's my kind of game.  MythForce is a great coop adventure.  I don't know how many legs it has, but I expect the missus and I may go through the whole campaign at least once, and I'll probably try to headlock a few friends into getting copies so we can run a full team.  It'll be a good number of streaming episodes, if anything.  It's got my swashbuckling thumb up.",1694600391,1694600391,True,14,1,0.581077516078948975,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Але побігавши в цю гру - я не можу високо оцінити їх проект. Відео з оглядом https://youtu.be/U4bO-J30Tcw - а текстом нижче:
Насамперед, це не ранній доступ. Почекайте хейтери раннього доступу, я поясню - такі ігри мають бути реіграбельними на купу годин, і у інді студій зазвичай банально немає можливостей і часу все це зробити під перший реліз. При цьому потрібен активний тестинг, при цьому в жанрі roguelike потрібно багато чого балансувати та фіксити. А коли бачиш відразу реліз то ти розумієш, що скоріш за все - це фінальний продукт. Нажаль статистика продажів гри дуже на все впливає і у більшості випадків для ігор орієнтованих на мультиплеєр - дуже важко триматися на ринку якщо банально мало гравців.
Ця гра у стилі Gunfire Reborn та Ziggurat, це досить специфічний жанр, але він має немало своїх фанатів. Але він сфокусований на коопі - 4 гравці в ідеалі мають бігати різними класами та знищувати монстрів з драйвовим настроєм. На справі я встиг потестити кооп вдвох з рандомним паладіном - і після виграної катки він відразу лівнув з гри бо чесно кажучи ці 25 хвилин були дуже сумні. Якщо в соло ти ще якось проходячи рівень перший раз відчуваєш дуже сильно свою прогресію, то вдвох це виглядає як хаос з трохи крінжовими монстрами і не особливо креативними аренами для битв. Зброї не дуже багато видів, посилення скілів і перки хоч і рятують трохи ситуацію, але це все не змінює відчуття, що ти граєш в ранній доступ якогось скромного проекту. А у нас тут вже реліз за 549 гривень. Не можу рекомендувати, суб'єктивно - досить млявий проект без якихось особливостей та моментів, які б хотілося відзначити в позитивному ключі. Можливо я вже задовбався грати в roguelike за 2018-2021 роки але от отримав 0 задоволення і не можу уявити, як його можна щиро отримати чи протриватися в грі більше кількох годин. Не рекомендую

You can do it, Beamdog! ;)

The game isn't launched through the Epic Launcher, and there are no missing save options.(after all, it's a roguelike)
At the end of each run, you can permanently enhance your character to progress further in the story.

Regarding the claim of always having the same skills, that's not entirely accurate either.
As you progress through the game, you'll come across items that significantly modify your skills. For example, you can turn a static turret into a permanent companion or transform a stationary shield into a frost sphere which follows your steps.

Each ability can be modified in three additional ways, which complement each other. As a result, you end up with completely different abilities than you had at the beginning of the run.

At first i really wasn't sure i liked this game but over the week since launch i have found that i can't stop playing it, so i'm updating my review to reflect that:

The more i play this game the more it clicks and the more i fall in love.

Right at the start anyone that grew up in the 80s will fall in love with the whole presentation. The developers and the art team behind this game absolutely knocked the presentation out of the park. The sounds, the music, the characters make me feel like a kid watching He-Man again. The visuals of the game, the way the environments are lit and rendered are absolutely stunning as well. You can stop moving at any point during game-play and you have a screenshot right our of a Saturday morning cartoon. Its impressive.

On top of that the game runs butter smooth across all settings on both my PC and on my Steam Deck. 

The Deck can run the game at an impressive 60fps without a sweat if you drop to low settings and because of the art style the game looks just fine. Or if you want to turn on that gorgeous global illumination you can set that to mid and keep everything else at low and you get a very solid 40fps. Both are more than playable.  The game controls wonderfully on the deck as well. I actually think its my favourite place to play.

At first the game didn't hook me in the way i was somehow expecting. I couldn't put my finger on it and i thought i didn't enjoy it. However i have found myself playing this every evening or picking up the steam deck to do an episode run whenever i get a moment.

Each run takes around 20 minutes and each time i finish i now want to do just one more. It's great. Now that the game has clicked for me an i'm into it's rhythm i totally love it.

I think the best games are the ones that do take a bit of time to warm up to. Those are usually the ones that stick with me the most. I've got a disgustingly large Steam library and so i tend to float away to other games quite easily. This one has kept me coming back and is becoming one of my favourite pick up and play titles.

The developers seem to be listening across steam and their discord. It is clear they are taking everyone's complaints about the game into consideration.

This feels like the sort of game that will continue to grow and get better over time.

I'm really glad i gave this title the time it truly deserves and i can't wait to continue to play and also see how it grows and develops.",1694586830,1695097507,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,True,,,

I really would've loved if this had more varied maps with proper enemy placement and a moody soundtrack instead of feeling like an endless survival mode in copy/pasted prefabs sections. It's just such a wasted potential. I don't know how to describe it, but it feels like the enemies don't occupy the same space as the location.

The roguelite mechanic is easily the worst aspect for me, especially in the form of drawing cards between rounds. Stopping the game entirely to have me make a choice in a hallway between random perks and debuffs instead of designing and balancing the gameplay from the start is just frustrating.

It just doesn't feel like it's ready for release, and tests my patience with every step which is a shame because the premise, art style and presentation of this game are everything that I should love.

Good stuff 
- Graphics are nice , althought I kinda understand most people won't like it.
That's about it.
Bad Stuff.
- Combat is broken, ranged weapons are waaay to OP while melee combat it's too punishing. I get it, Melee combat is more focused in block and parry but it's kinda hard to when you're surrounded by enemies, while I can just shoot arrows from a safe distance, heck arrows deal more damage than meelee weapons anyway since it's really easy to aim to the head and crit.
- Loot system :  In Dungeons you only find money, which can be use to upgrade weapons, items, trinkets. Exploring a dungeon is meaningless when you're going to find only money. There's no new weapons armors or any new stuff to be excited for,
-Equip system. Awful, you have a few options for weapons, there's no armor system or character customization option.
-Lack of content : after two runs you probaly have seen every trinket and modifiers.  Also only 9 stages.

It's real arrogant of these guys to throw it up on EGS for a year, and then bring it to Steam STILL f*cking unfinished, and missing basic coop game options, like voice chat, 
or a text box, for example. BTW, this game has neither and wants you to use a sh*tty radial menu during combat. This is another example of ""just ok"".  Actual great games will generally let you talk to other players because they don't have a cucumber in charge of that department.

These guys made a coop game where you can't talk to the people you randomly meet, that's not ""good"". I don't CARE about it, but it's not a ""good"" design. It's basic af, and only ""ok"" 

It's got a great art style and it has some cool features, and IS fun, BUT-

-it makes you install EOS, which heavily depends on you, because some people are like f*ck epic, and some people aren't, but the ones who ARE, will refund instantly if a game has it. 
-Sound design is weird and while it exists, it's like a bunch of times i kept thinking, ""man, this sound design sure sucks, i can't tell where creatures are at, and there's like a ton of sliders for audio but you really don't need that many, you just need to do a good job at the default settings, which they did not. 
-hitting barrels and pots gives you money! this is generally cool, but in this game, it's really underwhelming. 
-there's an overall lack of visual and audio WOW factor. The art design is great, but it's like they're just counting on that to make everything cool, and it doesn't really do it for ME? For example, there's no like special auras around dropped items, or stuff they want to direct your attention to, it just kind of exists in the world, where other games will be give that thing an outline, or make it sparkle a little bit to draw the eye? This does not do that. 
-They went with a sort of hybrid system of like overwatch skills, and what feels like half-a-vermintide for melee. It's ALMOST really good, but as it is, it's decent and passable. 

Overall, for me, this sits at around a 6.5 out of 10. There's a ton of room for improvement, and it's even more pathetic when you learn that this game has been out on EGS in early access for about a year now, and it STILL has a bunch of stuff that needs work. 

I'm going to give some time before fully making my decision. I wish that these reviews had a middle option, but right now i can't thumbs this sh*t up, the price is too high and it's really not much more than, just, ""ok""",1694552840,1694585274,False,7,2,0.483624309301376343,0,True,False,False,True,,,

A normal dungeon consists of ""magical doors"" blocking you inside, enemies spawning in different cornes and you waiting for them to spawn and attack you.
I compared the game with City of Brass(2018) in my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL0uj841MIs
The sound is terrible, you can't hear enemies behind you, the music doesn't fit the game, the progression of the city(upgrades) feels so grindy and basic. The characters you can chose from(4 playable) are pretty much as all steretypes in magical adventure games.
Pro: somewhat nice art, fun for a dungeon run(about 12 minutes), nice overall artwork for enemies and bosses, one of the only fps roguelikes
Cons: very repetitive, boring map design, most times you wait for enemies to spawn in a small space, looting makes you backtrack, sound design and music is very bad, you cant hear enemies behind you, game repeats the same shop rooms but makes them bigger than regular dungeons so you waste time. 
The main hub, the city, is just a picture, nothing move in it, upgrades are barely incremental, items have very low bonuses, game feels like it has 2005 mechanics, i see no progress in roguelike.
A few words about multiplayer: THERE IS NO SINGLEPLAYER, it makes you choose between Open and Friends Only.
It downloads epic game store software for crossplay at the start even if you never intend to play multiplayer.
There is no server browser option you can either play with friends or HOPE to get a playable server, it should not be listed  as co-op or multiplayer.
Steam really has to start improving the information shown about games, i have seen too many games that only have invite friend option but listed and promoted as multiplayer.
Last note: i have been following the game for years, it seems no progress was made to it, there is a screen that has ""Coming Soon""

Mythforce is a RPG/Roguelite game.

Finally we have here the definitive game for nostalgia effect, it's a must for kids who grow with cartoons of the 80-90'

For the visual graphics and asthetics of the game it's just superb how can catch the essence of tv shows like he-man.

Beside the nice visuals there is an addictive gameplay pretty simple with only 3 skills each character which can be evolve but the roleplay of each job it's pretty unic feels the dungeon crawler like dungeons and dragons.

The Roguelite part it's pretty complicated sinces you can boost several things like weapons trinkets or even constelations using some kind of runes and gold.

The matchmaking it's the unic thing I don't like, there are no rooms for each stage, it's randomly added to your stage of your party at least that you have friends for invite, you can't select go with random players to determinated stage, the quickplay button send you to a random stage with random players.",1694550550,1694556213,True,24,2,0.59199756383895874,5,False,True,False,True,,,

You can even go through the same level over and over with absolutely no changes because there's so few levels for it to ""randomize"", lol.

Also, as many others have said, get this Epic Games multi-platform dependency out of the game. Figure out how to use the platform you're selling the game on.

First problem, epic service dependency, I do not want to launch a game via one platform, only for it to open another platform and launch it from there, what's next in the future? A nest of platforms just to run a video game?

Second, after finally able to get in the game from the long initialization of epic service, after starting a quickplay game the tutorial were just dumped to me explaining everything at once in the form of GUI highlights, in silence, that tells me that this game does not have a proper tutorial, which means, its not finished.

Third, after I dismissed all of the tutorial slides, I was immediately teamed up with another player and immediately skeletons just appeared and started attacking us, we killed them and more appear, we killed them and more appear, we killed them and... nothing happened? We were wondering around until we found what seem to be a way forward, then skeletons appeared and we killed them, skeletons appeared and you would not guess what happens next! Rinse and repeat for pretty much the whole game.

Only momentary excitement I felt was during the 1 and only mini-boss fight in that mission against the mushroom mage, and even then the tactic between me and the other player was to just gang up on it and spam attack until it's dead. Afterwards, rinse and repeat.

Finally we made it to the last room, there was a dialogue with the antagonist, OK cool let's do this, we thought, nope the guy ran away and leaves his minions to deal with us which we just need to keep killing them for.. 2 minutes straight I think? Which then we opened up the big chest at the end and.. we don't know we just get stuff from it, pulled the lever and the level just ended.

Отличный визуал, приятная милишная боёвка, в целом интересная классическая для рогалика система прокачки. Спорный момент по динамике игры, ибо это не жёсткий динамический экшен, это скорее размеренный тактикульный с блоками и, чёрт возьми, стаминой (которая, конечно же, постоянно кончается).

И по минусам:
Цена для такого проекта, конечно, кусается. Странная оптимизация. Игра в целом выдаёт нормальный ФПС (хотя, наверное, для своего графена должна выдавать явно выше, ещё и лок в 120), однако выдаёт постоянные микрофризы, что очень неприятно. Стоит отметить слегка однообразные локи, а точнее повторяющиеся. За один прогон по уровню я встретил как минимум 3 из 10 одинаковых комнаты.

По итогу:
В целом проект выглядит довольно интересно, но мне как-то прям не вкатило. Очевидно, должно лучше раскрываться в коопе и к более поздней стадии игры, но пока что сама кор механика не цепляет. Возможно, вернусь в будущем.
