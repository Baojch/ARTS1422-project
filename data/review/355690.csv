Genre: Third Person limb utilisation action-adventure/simulation
Setting: Clumsy Cop (--> Deputy Dangle) saving his city from crime committed by an old lady (""G'MA"")
Difficulty: 2/10 - 10/10 - thanks to controls
Length: 2-4 hours for a campaign walkthrough, additional number of hours to get all achievements
Mode: singleplayer campaign, trials section (short mini games)
Similar games: Octodad, I am Bread


What's good about Deputy Dangle?

- funny setting 
- varying tasks


The negative aspects:

- severe frame rate drops, even on powerful computers
- short campaign
- horrible controls. Though some players say they are easier to master than those of [i]Octodad[/i] or [i]I am Bread[/i], controls aren't fun in this game either. ""Walking"" most of the time results in strong button mashing, climbing objects Dangle just falls down or gets helplessly stuck (trash container)

+ fairly reliable physics interactions are simple yet rewarding
+ new mechanics introduced throughout story keep it from getting stale
+ diverse levels with interesting design in several places
+ somewhat challenging but with very little chance of failure
+ many checkpoints to keep you steadily progressing
- quite short
- poor performance overall with good fps in minimal areas but greatly reduced in busier areas along with hitching
- dialog and story are rather poor. manages to be a little funny at times while not at all serious about itself, but it's not at all creative
- gameplay is often tedious or dragged out, with long periods of unchallenging tasks like long travel with a slow speed
- the pacing is really, really bad. in-game cutscenes are slow to transition and become very awkward as you are waiting unable to skip
- general low level of effort/detail from areas of minimal repeated textures, to obvious and simple dialog, to sound

I'd like to recommend this game as it was a bit of fun for me, but I think it's too flawed to recommend as a non-free game. Sure it's cheap at $10, and I got it for 50% off, but it was 2.5 hours long for me, and some of the content is stretched out a bit (like a 4+ minute segment of simply driving a car along a hazardless path to the next level). Chongo had a few good moments, but overall the characters aren't funny or memorable while jokes are delivered in quantity but without quality. It feels like a really good rough draft for a game, but that it needs some serious revision.

Poor performance wasn't a big problem overall, but I think that's due to the gameplay being very casual with rather simple requirements and lack of twitch reflexes, as well as the majority of levels being very minimal and bland. The game starts in a fairly detailed town with many structures and moving objects, and there's another level full of traffic and landmarks passing through the scene that's fairly detailed, but other levels are mostly empty rooms and tunnels with textured walls and few objects. I ended up playing through the game on Low graphics attempting to improve performance, but even then FPS was only 30-40 in the nice areas. In other areas I probably could have turned it to high and done fine.

I wouldn't say this game was a waste of time, but it doesn't really have the impact to justify playing regardless of the price. If you are really interested in it, then go for it, as there are much worse ways to spend time and money, but if you're on the fence then just pass. I wouldn't recommend watching a Let's Play, as the minimal entertainment it provides comes from driving the deputy.",1483276600,1483276600,False,11,0,0.500452280044555664,0,True,False,False,False,,,
