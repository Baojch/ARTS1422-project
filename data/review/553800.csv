I have no problem with dodging that some people have trouble (u have to press left grip and sway ur head to the left or right to dodge, and believe me u need to do this alot)

The boss fights are uneven.  Dodging is dodgy.  Yet dodging is important for each boss fight.  Only the basic shooting and sword swings are consistent.  Everything else is inconsistent.  The boss fights are not special.  You don't even know whether you're winning or losing.  Just a lot of repetition and persistance involved, along with luck with the dodges.

Its really short so I would buy it on sale. 

It is B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L.     Feels like you are inside a high end anime horror with vampires.   The steam punk element is also great. 

The controls for all 3 ""classes"" are very good.   I especially like the steam punk fire mage/ironman.  I dont know what exactly is going on there, but I love it. 

The story is very simple but so was the original Castlevania story.  Stop the vampire because reasons. 

The dialogue was clearly put through a language filter, as the grammar does not always make complete sense.  

The gameplay is great.   I'm not a fan of the dodging mechanic.  I think it would be better to have the player block with their weapons, or maybe they hold the block button and that gives them a shield for 1 second, so they still have to get the timing right.   

I actually thought I was blocking by parrying with the sword in the first 5 minutes (I wasnt I was dodging), and it was super satisfying, but then I realized blocking with my sword wasn't doing anything.

This is a great game. Yes, great and worth the money because it is well done overall in VR. It has sexy characters, active game play, bosses, small story and some adventure aspects. And yes at first it may seem very confusing and ""in your face"" but after playing a few times you will get the hang of it and then you can start to appreciate it. Be prepard to get physically active. The game runs well on my modest specs. Don't let any negative reviews keep you from trying it out. I want more content for this title and I hope it gets the support. We need to support titles that want to do things differently. Have fun !!!

No, you just do a lunge to the side like the graphic shows you. Try moving your effing body instead of waggling your head (take a deep step to the left or right). Learn how to dodge -- it's very much like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out! Time your dodge to just before the attack hits.

I believe the complaints about the length of the game (haven't played it long enough to beat it yet), but this has been really fun for me.  I enjoyed the frantic gameplay in this game and it's one of the few that got me to knock over my computer. (A boss kept running to different spots past me, so I got very turned around and didn't have chaperone on high settings.) Yes, the voice acting is poor.

The magical sword and gun gameplay is well done and feels good.

So what's wrong? Well, within 20 minutes I was standing near the final boss, that is what's wrong.
This is not an early access game, so sheer lack of content at this price setting is way off.

I also don't like the dodging mechanic. It sounds cool on paper, but the practical implementation is not one where the game tracks your bodily movements, no, you have to shake your head brusquely for the dodge to register. You can imagine, given the fact that game is centered around the dodge system, this becomes a painful chore very quickly.

With the dodging system revised, at least 10 times the current content; this would be quite the game.
However having followed the developer news and comments, and lack of them, chances look slim.

And in some small way, it did hit it's mark. 

The game is pretty.  The characters are quite anime-ish; the girls touting some curves (though some of those curves are a bit blocky).  For those who might venture into the upskirt voyerism, I hear you won't be disappointed. What adolecent wouldn't be tempted to take a peek?

The backdrops are decent; I liked their look.  There was a little interaction with the characters, and for a moment or two, when you were prompted to interact, they would address you briefly.

The weapon concepts were rather nice.  The combination of sword and pistol were enjoyable, and I really liked using the pair.  The motlen blade and 'phoenix' attack was entertaining for a time. 

And that, unfortunately,  is all I have to say about this game that is in any way positive, and it pales in comparison to the fumbles and fails made and the outlandish pricing for perhaps an hour of content if you master the 'head jerk' dodge early on, which includes about 4 areas that you visit.  In reality, if you have this mastered, you could go through it in about 15 minutes.

The story has some potential, but the actual dialog was completely lacking, and though the story may have some creative possibilities, it literally consisests of a dozen or so lines.  The delivery by the characters is just as undeveloped.  The first few words from the whimsy (and almost whiney) voice our main heroine are delivered as she stands completely stationary, like an eye candy statue.  For a few lines she does appear to speak, though in true anime fashion her movments jerky and hardly match the dialog. Most times appearing to deliver her lines ""telepathically"" to you.

The first fights against ranged attacks you can't really dodge.  Or if you can, it has to be timed perfectly.  The first boss is rather impressive, and sets the tone for what could be a potentially interesting encounter, but the dodging is disorientating to say the least, and you have no idea why you are even fighting him.

The second scene looks promising at first, and even a bit risque, but completely falls flat.  The interaction is clunky and graphics are plagued with horrible clipping issues and are unrefined.

It just gets worse from there.  Battles are not very interactive, with the second boss running over top of you, dropping through the floor with massive clipping problems.  His attacks seem at times to be flung in your general direction, and if you don't flail back and forth widly to initiate the 'ninja dodge', expect to die quickly.  I really couldn't tell when I was dodging an attack, I just continually dodged in hopes I wouldn't be hit, which unfortunately worked.

You get a glimpse of your true foe after that, in a brief and completely confusing encounter, and the story just starts to fall apart from there. 

The next, and I assume, last battle (since I just got too tired of trying to constantly dodge over and over again randomly to hopes I would  miss the attacks flung at me), again, has no meaning at all.  You can see there was some thought put into the moment where it lined up with some story or concept that was supposed to go somewhere, but my only interest at that point was to finish so I wouldn't have to do it again.  

I wish I could say more positive things about this game.  I know the developers have put a lot of time and effort into it, but to put this out there as a fully realized game and to charge what they are charging is practically crimminal.  There is no possible way the content provided is worth even half of what they are charging, and I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at this time.

I wish you guys the best, but you have a LONG way to go before this becomes an even somewhat polished experience. 

My suggestions:

Revamp the dodge experience.  Make it so you can actually dodge things, instead of hoping to trigger the 'blur' 

Write some story.  It's there somewhere, but you need to spend some time delivering it.  A short naration at each scene may help at the very least.

The concept of an AI partner is good.  Have them dialog.  People like to feel like they are engaged with the characters.  Give them some personality!  Don't RUSH the story along. 

The battles could be epic, but instead play out as just chaotic.  You need a better system of interaction with the characters while fighting.

More Rooms... actually allow the player to move around a bit in the world.  RPG is not just about a few boss battles.  It needs something more.

That's all I've got.  Good luck.",1480471358,1481597576,False,12,0,0.638808667659759521,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Bei diesem Spiel weiss ich nicht ob ich es empfehlen soll oder nicht.

Dieses Spiel hat so viel Potential aber macht so viel Frust.

Fürs erste Empfehle ich dieses Spiel, da ich denke, dass es noch besser wird.

Grafik: Die Grafik ist gut und die Levels sorgfältig erstellt.

Gameplay: Das Gameplay macht absolut Spass.
Allerdings hatte ich nach dem 3. Level das Gefühl, das ich in diesem Spiel nur 
gegen Endboss Gegner kämpfe. Einer schwieriger als der andere.

Steuerung: Die Steuerung ist für mich sehr schlecht.
Das Spiel ist wegen der schwierigen Gegnern sehr anstrengend zu spielen aber die Steuerung ist die Hölle.

Für fast alles benötigt man spezielle Bewegungen.
Diese Bewegungen in einem Kampf anzuwenden ist viel zu schwierig und funktionieren teilweise überhaupt nicht gut wenn man im Stress ist.
Man kommt auf jeden Fall ins Schwitzen und verliert gerne mal die Lust am Spielen.

Info an den Entwickler: Bitte mach das Spiel einfacher.
Die Waffe sollte wenn leer selbständig nachladen. Das manuelle Nachladen kann mit der bewegung gelöst werden.

Bitte bei den Endboss gegnern Hinweise über deren Schwachstellen einfügen. 
Evtl so wie bei „dreamcast, House of the dead 2“. Schau dir das mal an. 

Das ausweichen mit der Kopfbewegung ist unlogisch umgesetzt. Es entstehen ein paar 
wischende Streifen vor dem Gesicht, aber man bleibt an Ort und Stelle stehen. 
Ob mich der Gegner nun erwischt hat oder nicht, kann ich nicht wissen.


Pro: 
Viel Spass
Gute Grafik
Gutes Level Design
Musik

Kontra:
Preis zu teuer
Viel viel zu schwer!!!
Steuerung (Bewegungen) zu schwer.

In this game I do not know if I should recommend it or not.

This game has so much potential but makes so much frustration.

For the first time, I recommend this game because I think it will be even better.

Graphics: The graphics are good and the levels carefully created.

Gameplay: The gameplay is absolutely fun.
However, I had the 3rd level feel I was in this game only
Against final boss fights. One more difficult than the other.

Control: The control is very bad for me.
The game is very hard to play because of the difficult opponents but the control is hell.

For almost everything you need special movements.
To use these moves in a fight is much too difficult and sometimes do not work well at all when you are in stress.
It is definitely a sweat and loses the pleasure of playing.

Info to the developer: Please make the game easier.
The gun should recharge when empty independently. The manual recharging can be released with the movement.

Please add hints about their weaknesses to the endboss.
Maybe as in ""dreamcast, House of the dead 2"". Look at this.

The evasion with the head movement is illogical. There are a few
Wiping strips in front of the face, but you remain standing in place.
Whether the opponent has caught me or not, I can not know.

　　段数は無限、リロードにちょっと難あり 
　　他の攻撃手段は今のところ不明 
 　　剣で矢を弾いたりパリィは出来ない模様、今のところ剣はゴミ 

　・ミカっていう吸血鬼なんだか良く分からない女性キャラがお供 
 　　一応オートで戦ってはくれるが、とは言え攻撃にはほとんど 
　　期待できないので、基本的に自分で処理 
　　敵がそちらに寄って行かないのであくまで同行者的な扱い
　　放っておいても死ぬことはない

　・防御はその場で自分が勢いつけて体を振ることにより残像が 
　　発生して回避できるシステム 
　　一定時間の無敵あり？ 
 　　一応頭をぶんぶん振れば出来るけどめっちゃ疲れる 
　　連発不能なので同時に攻撃が重なってくると回避不能

　・ライフゲージがないため後どのぐらいまで耐えられるかが分からない
　　一定時間食らわなければオートで回復すると思われる
　　よって連続で食らわなければかなり長引く

 基本的な流れ 
　・面クリア型 
 　　一定時間雑魚が沸いてその後ボス戦の流れ 
　　ボスは今のところ異様に硬い上に回避不能っぽい攻撃が幾つか　 
　　具体的には１ボスの毒霧のような攻撃、回避しても判定が残っていて食らう時がある
　　２ボスの掴みも回避できない、剣を使うのだろうか？

sound - sound effect is good. but 3d sound, i mean expression of 
stereo sound is really bad. it is not immersive. wherever character
is standing, it feels like they are whispering on my ears. no ambience
no correlations. it is very important for vr to express direction of sound
effect. sometimes sound direction is completely wrong.

gameplay - cool, it is very cool. but some actions need to be simplified.
i think action including gesture is not very good. because it sometimes 
don't work correctly depend on people. and when i slash skeletons, it
is not cool as slashing zombies. feedback and reaction of skeletons are
bit bland

in-game-design (art, fonts, interface design) - not bad. but feels like
