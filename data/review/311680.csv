Each activity raises a certain stat forcing you to balance your time, which stat to improve, which activity to pursue, and how hard you want to work in the flower shop growing flowers to earn money in the game. Certain events will occur depending on your activity. The game is part Visual Novel and part farming simulation. The VN parts are mostly at the beginning, middle and at the end. In between, you plan out your weeks for activity and raise stats.

[b] Summary [/b]
This time the game features a female protagonist named Natalie. In the game Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook, the protagonist Natalie has just finished finals and is ready to start her winter break. But unfortunately her parents are making her get a job. Having forgotten to find one, Natalie panics. but her roommate Clara offers her a job at a flowershop in her hometown of fairbrook. Natalie with no other options accepts and heads off to the countryside  to experience flowers, snow and perhaps romance.

[b] Overall [/b]
The visual novel feature 4 men instead of 4 women (reverse) and each of them is unique from one another. Each involves Natalie adapting to her new lifestyle in the countryside. Through interacting with them will lead to different scenarios and ending which makes the game re-playable. The story is very simple and isn't very memorable, however the artwork was good, pretty much like the prequel and some recurring characters from the prequel also appear in the game.

Наша задача заниматься своим хобби и при этом строить отношения с кем-то из этой четверки.

Готовую продукцию мы можем продавать в магазине и там же закупаться новыми семенами. Этим мы будем заниматься всю игру, поэтому слабонервным придется запастись терпением.

Также, чтобы понравиться второй половинке, нужно прокачивать свои характеристики. Для этого необходимо посещать определенные локации и общаться с проживающими там парнями. Но и на этом нюансы не кончаются, ведь чтобы охмурить парня нужно качать сразу две характеристики, то есть посещать две определенные локации. Забавно наблюдать как ты выбрал для своей главной героини адекватного пацанчика, а она вынуждена мутить с двумя другими мужиками, чтобы ""прокачаться"".

The English is very good, even more poetic and philosophical at times than one would expect from normal conversations. I like the atmosphere and visuals - it's all very beautifully illustrated.

The character you play as has her own personality instead of just being a sort of blank slate you can act through like I was expecting - she has a happy disposition but finds work a bit exasperating and has difficulty applying herself. While her having a personality did give a certain added depth to the gameplay, I did find that when given a dialogue option that picking something I would've chosen as myself: would be something she'd flub terribly because she simply wouldn't go about it the way I would... which would mean I'd have to go back to the save I made just before to make her say the option she wouldn't totally ruin. It's not an issue unique to this particular game with dialogue choices though. 

In many ways it's more like a story with interactive points than something with many dialogue options and opportunities for conversations you could play a real part in - which although was different from what I was expecting didn't make it necessarily bad. It was kind of a pleasant read, and although replaying certain things in the game could get a bit tedious, when you did get a different ending it felt very rewarding.

Overall I'm glad I got it and I had fun playing it. It's very slice of life with focus on the intellectual and emotional sensibilities, rather than anything sensual or indecent. Cute, really. I can't speak to whether others would like it for certain... but I did. All in all it's got a pretty saccharine quality to it, and I found all the characters likeable in their own way.

Особенность этой ВН — мини-игра, в которой нужно выращивать цветы. Начинаем мы с покупки семян и прополки «грядок», а когда семена дают ростки, нужно поливать их и опрыскивать от жуков, чтобы в итоге продавать выросшие цветы. Каждое действие отнимает ход — час игрового времени.

Эта игра относится к тому типу ВН, где нужно совершать определённые действия и тем самым прокачивать характеристики персонажа, — классический симулятор свиданий. Зашла после работы в библиотеку — стала более культурной. Пришла пообщаться с умником в магазине хозтоваров — прокачала интеллект. Казалось бы, ну и ладно — пусть для интереса будет хотя бы такая прокачка умений, — но для того, чтобы понравиться любому из парней, нужно развивать две характеристики, то есть сосредоточиться на двух местах проведения досуга, в которых находятся два парня. Один из них тебе не интересен, но к нему нужно ходить даже чаще, чем к своей цели, потому что прокачиваемая на его локации характеристика — важнейшая из двух. Это неправильно. Ходишь трижды в неделю к парню в гости на ферму, вы мило общаетесь, вместе печёте печенье, у него рождаются какие-то чувства… и тут оказывается, что всё это время Натали строила глазки другому.

И так четыре раза, по количеству концовок с разными персонажами. Но подождите, концовок-то на самом деле девять. Если одна из них посвящена одиночеству Натали, то откуда взялись ещё четыре? Каким-то образом на сюжет влияет то, сколько денег ты заработаешь в цветочном магазине. Игра объявляет, что граница находится на 400 долларах, но на самом деле, чтобы получить «нищенскую» концовку, нужно в последний день спустить на семена практически все свои деньги. Другой тактики получения этих концовок нет, потому что в цветочную мини-игру невозможно проиграть — спустя пару недель начинаешь делать всё автоматически. Такое ощущение, что дополнительные четыре концовки сделаны просто для количества — они тоже положительные, и варьируется лишь то, кто к кому приезжает в гости: Натали к своему парню или наоборот.

Есть тут одна огромная нестыковка. Натали приехала в Фэйрбрук на месяц: она появляется там в начале зимы и уезжает после Рождества. Почему же она проводит там 11 недель? На протяжении одного прохождения ты 11 раз планируешь неделю, 66 раз возишься с цветами, а в конце Натали вздыхает о том, как быстро пролетел месяц, в начале которого она даже завтрак себе приготовить не умела. Наверное, иначе бы просто сценарий не сложился: работать она должна не больше месяца, чтобы успеть после Рождества вернуться к учёбе, а развивать так быстро отношения Натали с ухажёрами у сценариста не получилось. И всё оставили как есть.

Когда достигаешь концовки, начинаешь понимать, куда ушли все средства и силы разработчиков. Заключительная сцена битвы снежками длится едва ли не столько же времени, сколько вся предыдущая новелла, к тому же она написана в разных вариациях, чтобы учитывать выбранного парня. Разнообразных и интересных картинок с стиле чиби в этой сцене просто вагон и маленькая тележка. Будь так же выполнена вся ВН, она бы стоила своих денег.

Здесь полно персонажей, плюс рисунки в стиле чиби и арты в самых важных сценах — художник без работы не сидел. Но потом программист запутался и в некоторых сценах назначил не те спрайты, особенно это заметно в сценах с парнем на ферме: однажды Натали готовила не снимая пальто (вот же экстремалка, рядом с работающей плитой и в домашней-то одежде жарко), а другой раз пришла к парню в гости в рабочем фартуке, вслед за чем вдруг стала расстёгивать пуговицы пальто.

Да и само качество рисовки не так уж высоко. Дело не только в её примитивности. Взять, к примеру, спрайт персонажа по имени Трент. По задумке автора, Трент очень высокий, о чём неустанно напоминают в тексте. Как это показать? Может быть, поставить его спрайт ближе к верху экрана, чтобы было очевидно, что парень как минимум на голову выше всех? Слишком просто! Ему сделали длинные руки, из-за которых бедняга будто не помещается на экране и вызывает ассоциации с монстром из какой-нибудь Skyhill.

★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆[/h1]

Diesen seichten Visual Novel, mit rudimentärer Wirtschaft, möchte ich gar nicht Dating Simulator nennen. Bis auf die letzte Woche, sofern man genügend Punkte gesammelt hat, ist das [b]eher ein Freundschaftssimulator[/b]. Mit Blümchenpflege und -verkauf.
Sich verabredet wird hier nicht. No dates.

Allerdings hab ich auch nur ein Kerl - Ryan aus dem Saatgutladen - durchgespielt (da aber beide Enden), zusammen mit dem Ende ohne einen abzukriegen. 

Ich spiele fast nie Visual Novels aber ich erwarte schon gewisse Navigationsstandards wie das automatische Skippen von bekannten Dialogen. Das kann man hier sogar in den Einstellungen setzen aber passieren tut gar nichts. 👎🏻
Ich startete meinen Autoclicker, der eigentlich für Clicker-Games gedacht ist. Aber das schnelle Spammklicken von dem skippte wenigstens alles bis zur nächsten Entscheidung. 
Entscheidungen sind hier spärlich gesäht. Das macht das ganze noch zäher.

Der Rest ist also die [b]Textgeschichte [/b]selbst und diese fand ich zu oberflächlich, gestreckt und langweilig. Die tieferen Gefühle kamen quasi am letzten Tag und das auf einmal überraschend schnell. Wirkte sehr holprig.
Und der [b]Wirtschaftspart[/b], der eigentlich irrelevant ist außer für die Spezialenden bei denen man 400 $ Cash haben sollte, war pipi-einfach.

Für die [b]Errungenschaften [/b]empfehl ich den entsprechenden Guide von der Community hier. Mit den Speicherpunkten ist es recht schnell getan.

Grafisch, waren mir die Bilder zu statisch und nicht abwechslungsreich genug. Außer am Ende. Da ging's auf einmal.
Top fand ich den Speicherscreen; simpel, funktionell und gut übersichtlich (Esc oder rechte Maustaste im Spiel). 👍🏻

Von der [b]Spielzeit [/b]war ich in 2h mit 3 Enden durch.

Hat sogar ne tiefere Story. Oder: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/568770/Cinderella_Phenomenon__OtomeVisual_Novel/]Cinderella Phenomenon[/url], ist kostenlos und auch wenn ich es nicht durch habe war es viel emotionaler und interessanter (und nicht so schwülstig wie Amnesia).

While their are oddities in the actual gameplay, some kinda money thing or whatever, it didn't distract from the story and the adorable moments found within.  I'm usually pretty picky about MC, but she wasn't so bad either.  Well, you at least get used to her eventually.  

The only con I could see, and could be a pretty big one if the cuteness doesn't suck you in, was not a lot of real interaction with the romanceable characters.  You work for their stats, which is fine, but you get limited amounts of time to ""get to know"" so to speak the person you are pursuing.  It goes so quick that you don't even know why you are really liking them.

That being said,  each character is so very adorable!  and even without in depth character arcs, each so very likable...

So I'd recomend this game for a quick, easy to play, super cute game with pretty artwork.

No contiene mucho diálogo, por lo que, en mi opinión, de verdad es algo difícil de encontrar un diálogo con un chico que te ayude a mejorar tu relación con él.
Al principio es entretenido, pues sigue la historia con diálogos variados, se te hace entretenido el hecho de tener que trabajar y organizar tu semana, pero conforme avanzas el juego, se te hace tedioso.
No estoy en contra del modo de juego, pero sería mucho mejor si variaran los diálogos, poniendo un poco más de trama. La cosa aquí es que repiten mucho todo y muy d evez en cuando varía.
El juego te lo puedes terminar en dos o tres horas cuando mucho, así que no está tan mal si quieres probar algo corto, como mencioné antes. Los dibujos son muy agradables a la vista, aunque la música es algo repetitiva, pero yo, en lo personal, no le presté mucha atención a eso, así que a mí no me molestó.
En cuanto al precio... no está tan descabellado, pero si lo agarran en oferta (que fue lo que hice) mejor.
Otra cosa es que no es necesario haber jugado Summer in Fairbrook para jugar éste, pues la trama es aparte a pesar de que utilizan varios personajes del juego anterior.
Leí varios análisis donde decían que la chica protagonista desesperaba un poco por ser una chica mimada, pero no la encuentro tan desesperante, lo único desesperante es que hubiese deseado que para ciertos diálogos hubiese preferido que existiera alguna decisión por hacer.

Vale, lo he jugado varias veces y de diferentes maneras, pero simplemente no logro desbloquear otro final que no sea el Alone Ending. Supongo que seguiré jugando hasta encontrar la manera de desbloquear el resto, pero lo veo difícil.

It sadly renders 'Summer's ending moot, as when you meet Steve here he's single (so he evidently failed to romance anyone last time) but the advantage is you could date him now if you like. 
The 'crisis' point midway through lacked much of the personal urgency of the one in the previous game, or perhaps that's becaues I'm not all that invested in Susanna's safety. 


In summary, I did enjoy this game, but it is very flawed.",1459334800,1459334800,True,2,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Интерактивная новелла с встроенной казуальной игрой и небольшой экономикой. Мы играем за девушку, которая закончив колледж, по наводке подруги устраивается в цветочный магазин в небольшом городке Fairbrook. Нашу главную героиню поселяет в своем доме хозяйка магазина. Прогуливаясь по городу мы знакомимся с несколькими парнями, которых можно запикапить, а также обучаемся выращивать растения в магазине. С этого момента кончается интересная повествовательная часть игры и начинается занудная часть с тем, что мы покупаем семена, выращиваем цветы и продаем их, качаем характеристики, а также иногда болтаем с парнями, завоевывая их сердца.

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
¥ Прекрасная музыка.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Мини игра с выращиванием растений, покупка семян в игре явно лишнее и только мешает погружению в игру.
¥ Нет русского языка (причем в сети гуляет русская версия, но со стимом она несовместима, максимум можно демо версию пройти)
¥ Нет озвучки персонажей (хотя в меню пункт с громкостью голоса есть)

[h1]Советы:[/h1]
¥ Выращивайте самое дорогое растение, оно продается за 30 монет.
¥ Вы можете получить сразу два достижения если сохранитесь перед концом игры. Сначала с накопленными деньгами завершите игру, затем потратьте деньги и снова завершите.
¥ Пропуск диалогов на ""ctrl"".

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Игра про пикапершу и наверное понравится девушкам. Меня она ничем не зацепила, кроме музыки. Мини игра, прокачка характеристик, покупка-продажа цветов-семян игре скорее вредят. Не рекомендую.

It wasn't anything too outstanding, but for a simple romance visual novel with such a basic plot and route options it was fun.

What I want to praise the most about the game is that I think the writers did a good job of making Natalie grow into a better and more likeable person. In the beginning it was very easy to dislike her, which I feel was the intent, but at the end of the game she was a much more responsible, kind, and selfless person.

The art is nice if not the most professional looking. The sprites were very expressive and the cutscenes, for the most part, were a pleasant treat. The snowball fight cutscene was probably the most enjoyable to me.

Some gripes:

I wish the mini-game of working at the flowershop itself was more important in the scheme of things. Overall it just felt like a pointless thing to do every day, so it would've been a lot better for it to have more impact on the story than just helping you get special endings.

I feel like the game could have been condensed from having so many weeks to avoid the numerous repeated scenarious when encountering characters, or have more unique dialogue included. In extension to this, I feel like more editing was necessary because there were a few typos and grammatical errors.

There were a few errors in plot, mostly with events having to do with Trent, such as when Trent has already talked about having a job and then days later he mentioned it and Natalie was surprised: ""You work?"" Similarly, I was confused as to where Natalie's reaction of Trent comparing her to his sister all the time came from. Sure, he talks about Susana to Natalie, but doesn't really ""equate"" them to each other, so her outburst about it and being treated like a kid felt like it came out of nowhere. Then it was very strange that after Trent confessed, Natalie ran off, and if you go to the library the next day nothing's changed, it's the same event of them greeting each other and talking all afternoon like nothing happened.",1444339192,1444339192,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The artwork as usual, was beautiful and well done.
The endings seemed similar at parts, but were personalized more so than I expected.

Pro:
- Story, even made better but still no top notch
- Plantshop minigame
- 9 different endings
- many choices
- Music
- Backgrounds
- Tradingcards
- Achievements
- 100% All ages appropiate 
- All characters reappear
- Characters with different personalities
- adorable chibi sprites

Cons:
- Character sprites still a bit clumsy, but they are better than in the prequel (at least a bit) [they are inferiour to most novels, but i like them anyway]
- €/fun/hour  as said off, perfectly fine for 66% off or higher, okay for 50% off
- Often no sound
- Flower growing shrinked, in prequel you had 9 plants now there are only 4 flowers, impact: 400$ or more = special ending (that is done in the 2nd week already after that you can just ignore the flowering completely..), again no achievement for being a farmingqueen or so.

- The characters weren't bad, and I did actually enjoy learning about them, however little the game actually promotes their individual personalities. 
- The visual representations of the characters were poorly drawn however. Especially when compared to the backgrounds, as the game runs like a story. While the backgrounds were also somewhat poorly drawn, it seemed as though there was a lot more attention paid to detail when compared to the characters.
- Also, sadly, the conversation flow just wasn't there. Everything seemed terribly forced, and hardly romantic. Not to mention that the main character that you play is a whiny putz (and frankly I wouldn't use any of the lines they put forth for her). 
As I didn't play the first game, and this is a sequel of sorts - I have nothing to compare it to other than other dating sims/games in general, so forgive the mostly Con related viewpoint of the review in that aspect.

And much like it's predecessor, Winter in Fairbrook leaves much to be desired.

To say the game is bad would be like saying a small piece of chocolate cake is bad (assuming that you enjoy chocolate cake). It's still cake, it's still good, but it is grossly unsatisfying.

The writing leaves much to be desired. Very much like Steve in the previous game, Natalie is a vapid, ignorant, immature, petulant, and lazy girl, who is instructed by her parents to find a job over the holidays, in the hopes of teaching her some discipline (They had already cancelled her cellphone due to bad grades, and are now threatening to take her new car away). Luckily, her room-mate just happens to be Clara from the previous game, and she sets Natalie up with Susana to work in the flower shop. 
Natalie must leave first thing in the morning to arrive in Fairbrook to start work the next day, but instead of packing and sleeping, she spends all night playing online games. That is our first introduction to this character, and I must say, it did not leave me wanting to spend the entire winter break with her.

When she arrives in Fairbrook she thinks it's a small, dull town, and rightly so. She sleeps the day away, and then proceeds very rudely reject the dinner that was cooked for her (and continues to do so for a few weeks) and sleep in until 11 am the next day, even after being woken up by Susana at 8 am... after doing the only task asked of her, she then wanders off to check out the general store, thinking to herself that she ""wasn't told [she] needed to come right back.... once again, I am left wondering why I should care about this spoiled wretch.

She improves as time goes on, of course, but I still never really cared for her at all. The choices that you get to make in the game are fairly limited. Just like it's predecessor, you start your day working in your garden. You then get to do one activity for the whole day, be it going to the store, the library, or just staying in.. there were around 5 options if I recall correctly. Every so often you would get a cut scene with one of the bachelors, and you would get to make a single choice in the entire discussion, and the rest of it was merely her awkward verbal diarrhea.

As for the bachelors... well.... what can I say...

Steve is still Steve, if you've played the previous game then you already know everything there is to know about him. He's slightly less lazy than before, but otherwise he's pretty much just a male version of Natalie (or she a female version of him).

Jacob is sweet, charming, helpful, and shy.. oh, and he's SEVENTEEN!!! Yes, you read that right.. one of this College girl's potential mates is still in Highschool...... yeah. Add to that the fact that she thinks he looks like a twelve year old, and you've got a real winner.

Trent is still trent. He's sweet, charming, attractive, and playful. Oh, and in love with someone else... just like, well, pretty much all the guys really.

And Ryan, well, there's nothing that I can say about him that wouldn't sound completely biased, but I'll try. To say he's adorkable would not be giving him enough credit, though he does resemble that at times. He's intellegent, well-spoken, hard-working, reliable, cultured, and a bit of a virtuoso.... I mean, is there anything he isn't? He's also the only guy who isn't already mostly spoken for, so that's another plus for him... the only problem is, in reality, there is no way he would go for someone like Natalie... and quite frankly, most of the time it seemed like he hated her, or at the very least found her highly irritating.

The good:
- Art work is relatively cute
- Writing is decent
- Gardening mini-game is amusing
- The bachelors are charming

The bad:
- The music is repetitive, and though not inharently bad, certainly grates on you after a time.
- The writing is lacking in quite a few places
- The gardening mini-game is much more out of place in this incarnation than in the previous title.

TL;DR
This game is not really worth your time or money, even on sale. It's decent, and if you really like the genre then I won't think any less of you for buying it.

Winter comes to the quaint little town of Fairbrook, and this time you play a spoiled girl looking for love with the town's male residents while working in the town's popular flower shop. I didn't find the story quite as engaging as in its predecessor, Summer in Fairbrook, but I liked the new characters well enough and it was nice to see the old ones return. 

The two Flower Shop games are stand-alone titles, and you really don't need to have played Summer in Fairbrook to enjoy Winter in Fairbrook, though it probably helps as I personally found that a lot of this game's charm came because I already liked the setting and was familiar with a lot of the characters. But the endings from the first game don't carry over, even though most of the characters are still around -- including the protagonist of Summer in Fairbrook, Steve.

The game is short, and the story is pretty predictable. Once again, the ""farming sim"" part of the game is only slightly relevant, though this time the money you earn growing flowers affects whether you get the standard or ""special"" endings. The anime-style artwork is cute, and the characters are mostly likeable, so it's a fun little diversion for a few hours.

Steam features are well-integrated, and it's a pretty easy game to get all the achievements for (though a bit repetitive with the 2 endings per pairing.)

[b]Full Review[/b]

Back to Fairbrook! Only this time it's Winter!

Firstly this game has little depth to it. You pick where you go each week. You can get away with going to each place once a week and on Saturday go to the place where the guy you want to woo is and spend Sunday resting. This is basically the extent of actual game play, the rest is clicking and reading. Of course the last three weeks you need to get your stat up that the guy you're going for likes. This stat is raised by visiting a specific other guy. Just make sure you visit bae enough that you trigger all his events. Twice a week should cover it.

The whole gardening aspect is simple, you weed the bed so you can plant the seeds then they grow, you water them and pick bugs off them and then sell them to get more seeds. YOU GET A ""TRUE"" ENDING WITH A CHARACTER IF YOU MAKE $2,000 FROM SELLING PLANTS. It's tedious at times and when you're just trying to get endings, it's a pain. But you can either just click stop working or spam water plants to pass the time.

From your selection of guys you get a decent mix of personalities. You have the ""handsome"" one who is a nice guy. The character from the previous game who is kind of a jokster. Then shy one who you need to tell to grow a pair basically. And lastly a smart one who follows the obvious cold and not good at being social archtype. 

If you read their dialogue they do have decent characters and have cute lines. I found myself playing through each ending, both normal and true to just get all the dialogue. 

That is really it to the game. If you'd don't like reading cute exchanges between characters and spamming buttons to get through stuff you already read *ahem* intro *ahem* then skip this game or get it in a bundle. But if you like cute somewhat heartwarming stories (Steve's is more touching if you played the first game) then this game is worth it... on sale. It doesn't have enough to it to pay $14.99! 

A major point to this game is you should follow a guide. They do spell out what two stats you need for each guy but it's hinted at subtly depending on the guy. So unless you want to end up alone, read a guide, it takes two minutes which is a lot less time than replaying through the game.

It's one I've sort of been lusting after for a couple of years now, so you can bet that as soon as I got the opporitunity to play the full thing, I took it.

This VN is sort of like a typical stat-building YN; you might have to try to guess who which stat is for, but if you spend enough time with each of the guys, you'll be able to tell based on their personalities. And not only that, you need to help Susana, the owner of the flower shop that you're helping out, with the flowers. Every morning you tend to them, and it's up to you, the player, to decide which strategy to use.

You do need to keep an eye on the garden and have a certain amount of money to get the ""special"" ending for each guy. There is a ""normal"" ending as well as a ""special"" ending. It's not just the money; you need to spend time with each potential romantic interest, and as Natalie, the player character, spends time with them, you get to unlock scenes. 

Personaly, my two favorite routes were Trent and Steve. Both guys get to see the character you play as change as the story goes on, and their endings are pretty good as well.

Music: 4/5 - It's relaxing; to the point where you don't mind it going on in the background. If you dislike repetativeness of the background music, you might not like it.
Sprite Art: 5/5 - They never fails to impress me. Each of the characters are different personality wise, and you can definitely tell them apart. The CGs and chibi scenes are some of my personal favorites.
Story: 4.5/5 - My only gripe about this, is I would have liked to see a potential scene with Natalie's parents meeting her love interest. Other than that, some of the scenes were a bit cliche in the ""romanitc"" sence, but I didn't mind it at all.
Overall: 5/5 - I really enjoyed this VN; and I find myself replaying it and smiling when I see some of the characters. I look forward to playing more Winter Wolves visual novels, since they haven't disappointed me yet.",1422750033,1422750033,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Как нетрудно догадаться из названия, это продолжение Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook, только прошло полгода и наступила зима. Играем мы за Натали, обычную студентку, которая сожительствует с Кларой, уехавшей в прошлой части из Фэйрбрука на учебу. По ее совету Сюзанна берет нас на работу к себе помощницей в цветочном магазине. В первый же день мы встречаем четырех главных мужских персонажей, из которых только один новый. Трент, сводный брат Сьюзи – огромный, простой и дружелюбный. Стивен – да-да, вы можете обольстить парня, которым в прошлой части совращали деревенских красоток :) Джейкоб – тот застенчивый парнишка, который заглядывался на Сюзанну. Райан – единственный новый персонаж, заведует магазином. 

И начну сразу с минусов. Мини-игру с фермой перенесли без единых изменений, разве что земля теперь темная и разглядеть на ней жуков почти невозможно, а если их не убрать, то не будут расти цветы. Внешне это оформлено как мини-сад в теплице цветочного магазина, но боже ж ты мой, дайте оплеуху тому, кто это придумывал, ибо наблюдать как в таких условиях из ниоткуда берутся сорняки и насекомые-вредители я без злобы не могу. Если уж гордо называете свою игру в трейлере “dating and farming simulation game”, то можно было со второй попытки и постараться! Впрочем, теперь пахать землю придется, этому придумали гениальное объяснение – если не наберете 400$, то не получите «особую» концовку! Даже не спрашивайте о логике…

Второй большой проблемой я хочу выделить то, что двое из четверых парней на выбор… как бы это, того, никакие. Райан – типичный ботан, который не может проявить в разговоре ни интереса, ни притвориться хорошим собеседником, ни проявить эмоции наконец. Ну кому нафиг будет интересно с таким встречаться и общаться?! Джейкоб и в прошлой части был застенчивым пацаном, но теперь превзошел самого себя. В одном из первых разговоров он жалуется на то, что хотя ему 17, он выглядит молодо и все с ним обращаются как с ребенком. Но при этом он смущается ВСЕГО на свете, постоянно извинятся и не может не уклониться от прямого вопроса или намека. Как можно вообще терпеть такого тряпку, распускающего постоянно нюни?! Натали говорит, мол, она балдеет от того, какой Райан сосредоточенный и умный, а Джейкоб нежный и обходительный, но это как-то за пределами моего понимания. Хотя, игра для девочек больше, может в этом причина.

Третья проблема в сюжете. Если первая игра затянула меня от и до, то тут все как-то скучно, что ли. Если играть общаясь со всеми, то интересных или занятных событий крайне мало. А без гайда вы точно выйдете сразу на одинокую концовку, где не будет снежной битвы и все закончится совсем уж уныло. Не зря люди в негативных отзывах пишут, что игру можно осилить где-то за час (если с английским все хорошо).

Но вот тут открывается интересное – стоит только проходить игру на концовку с парнями, как видишь, куда потратили силы разработчики. Там и отличный арт, и неплохие сценки, и даже два варианта концовок. До того как я увидел одну из них в целом считал, что нет смысла больше тратить время на игру, но после одной передумал и открыл все. Не пожалел :) Сюжет наполнен большим количеством отсылок к первой части, мы узнаем, что многие из действующих лиц начинают встречаться, а тот же Райан может уехать в Германию на учебу и влюбиться там в Джилл, бывшую девушку Стивена и много подобных мелочей.",1421344547,1421344820,True,13,2,0.560089111328125,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The game is incredibly short (12 weeks/turns, and only 1 major event besides the opening and ending). What does stick out to me though is how terrible the UI is while reading.

1) The characters are drawn tall/thin and appear in the middle of the screen. Their expressions change sometimes, but their head will be towards the top of the screen while your eyes will be bottom/center focused on the dialogue.

It's true that many visual novels put the character art dead center, but Kanon in example uses the space better. When you're talking to a character in Kanon, their face (rather than their body, as it is with Flower Shop) is dead center so it's like you're having a conversation rather than staring at their shirt.

2) The height of the dialogue box in Flower Shop changes based on how many lines are in it, so the height of it changes frequently which is fairly annoying when reading. The dialogue box is also decorated with a sunflower graphic in the top right that stretches up/down based on how many lines there are.

3) When it comes to reading dialogue, Natalie is the only character who gets a head portrait, and she only gets one when she's talking. Her thoughts don't have an accompanying portrait, nor do her thoughts don't have ()s or italics. And when another character speaks, their name only appears with their first line of dialogue. So you can start reading lines by Steve, it'll go to his second dialogue box, his name will vanish, there's no indicator that he's speaking, and the text looks exactly the same as Natalie's inner thoughts.

4) The font has descending numbers (as in numbers that dip beneath the typographic baseline). It's very noticable on numbers like 3 and 4 and looks pretty wonky when those numbers are paired with other numbers that don't descend below the baseline.

He gave me a present — a game, specifically. Yes, that present was titled 'Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook'. I was baffled, the game was a dating sim with a female protagonist. Did Santa mistook me as a girl due to my profile picture? I felt it too sad to ignore this precious gift Santa had presented me with, and so I started playing. 

The first time I played this game, it was horrible. I was irritated by the main protagonist (which is me). Why is she so airheaded? Can't she be more diligent like Susie? More attentive like Ryan or Sam? And so I skipped through the whole story and I reached the Alone Ending; pretty much the reasonable result.

From the third run, I read and followed several walkthroughs that I can find in the internet. And thus I completed 6 other Endings. But then, I realized something. I had wasted the invaluable present from Santa. The point of this game was not about tending a flower shop, nor was it to obtain more dollars in my (the protagonist's) pocket. We visited Fairbrook to have a part-time job, but that did not have to be the end of it. We met people, we met 3 handsome guys (1 was cute, instead).

And so I started anew, and I learned a lot. I learned that walkthrough was meaningless; Uncle Sam taught me all I need to get Steve's attention. I learned that it is not a General Store that increased my intelligence, it was because Ryan tutored me whenever I visited. And finally, I learned that the main protagonist is actually called Natalie. I felt happy when I reached the ending. Thank you for this great present, dear Santa.

I feel like it could have been so much better but I still love what it has.
I've played many visual novels and dating sims mainly otomes of varing qualities and backgrounds, and I always enjoyed them for something. 

I'm gonna go right off in saying that the biggest isses with this game is it's length and difficulty.


It felt way too easy. 

-The gardening simulation was okay but besides for getting the special endings it didn't give me any insentive to keep going once I got my goal. It's supposed to one of the big parts of the game but ends up being optional. I think this could easily be improved by adding more things to buy or atleast need money for,  a higher goal for special ends and some sort of noticable punishment for not working. 

-Getting the guys is another thing that felt too easy. Instead of getting hints or what not for the guys, you litterally get straight up told what stats you need to make them fall for you. It's not even sutble, they say exact stats names.
another thing is there really should have been atleast one more ending per guy, and by that I mean a bad ending, so their endings wouldn't be that easy to do, mainly the special ending, which is another big problem. the ""best"" ending really should be harder to get, and for some characters be better than the normal endings.


It needed more to it.

-For the guys, you either get to know them way faster than you should, or by the end you only seem to have gotten the very surface layer of them. It gives the impresstion that it was a bit rushed. Like characters who were well written out had to get their story squeezed in a much smaller amount of time, and others who weren't fully developed having to have their stories artifically stretched. While saying this I did enjoyed all the characters, but the attachment to them wasn't really there due to the rushed or shollow feeling. 

-The story was good, the characters were wonderful but it was far too short. When I finished all the endings all I wanted to do was keep playing, I still do, I want there to be more for me to do. each guy took maybe an hour or two to finish completely, maybe 3 if it takes you a bit to figure out what to say. This is rather short for a game of this genre.

Now to improve these things the simple solution would be to extend the story. Add more weeks or instead of planing each week, you plan each day. or simplely adding more endings, like friendship endings for the girls and guys, bad endings. Things like this can really add an hour or so of gameplay.

- Now that we're past these issues, now to my more positive thoughts.

To start with the art is really top notch, would have been nice to have a few more CGs but moore wasn't nessasary.

The Interface is simple but it was more than enough for a dating sim.

The main character starts off not to likeable but by the end you'll deffiantly like her. She goes through a reasonable yet still drastic change, going from childish and bratty to more thoughtful of others and mature. The differant guys make these changes more sutdle or more drastic.

The other characters do go through some changes themselves that you help with, again not too great to be unrealistic but even something as simple as helping to see things a bit differantly. they do seem to evolve some in the course of the game.

The story is not really complex, you're a spoiled college girl going to a small town to work for winterbreak cause your parents are making you. It felt natural, and flowed well enough. again i wish it was longer, it would have really profited from even a slightly extended story.

Besides for technical issues, I must say that this is one of my favorite otomes, specially here on steam. If it wasn't for my dislike of playing male characters, I would most certainly try Spring in Fairbrook, aswell. If you're new to dating sims or your still not sure about this game, get it when it's on sale and give it a go.

As for the others who are still intrested, I can't really say if it's worth paying full price. If you like other Winter Wolves titles and/ or you'r fine with splurging a bit, then go for it.

The gist of the story is that you, a city girl, go to work at a flower shop during your winter break at your college. Your character is a rather blunt and quick to speak (and not think) kind of individual. She makes it no secret that shes not one for hard work. But she isn't so off putting that you cannot enjoy playing her. You end up working in a small town and having regular occurrences with four males that do various things in the town. If you plan your week right, you can grow your flowers and earn a decent profit while wooing the males and getting yourself a good ending. 


While the story itself is rather simple, the characters are refreshing and not obviously cliche with their individual story lines. I didn't find the choices to be obvious as to what would get me brownie points with the guys. And I actually had a hard time getting a satisfying ending! The first two times I played I ended up getting the ""Alone"" ending. After doing a little research and experimentation, I found that you need to converse with the guys a lot during your week and that, while you may get their relationship bar all the way up, you wont get an ending with them unless you also have the two stats required with the male of choice at the least requirement. For example, the first male I went for was Steve and he required a stat level of 80 in intelligence, which you raise by visiting with Ryan. Hanging with one guy in order to woo another, a bit of an interesting change! His secondary stat I'm not sure of, but after looking a site, I figured it would be diligence, which only has to be raised to 60. So if you have trouble like I did, go to this link (http://sakevisual.friendhood.net/t37-winter-in-fairbrook) to get  a little more of an understanding of the correlation with the stats and your guy of choice.
 

All in all, I'd give this game a 8/10. It was  enjoyable and I was happy spending the $7.49. But I probably wouldn't have payed $15 dollars for it since it wasn't the best visual novel I've ever played and I tend to be a little stingy with spending money on games. But the story was a good and cheerful, the art was very appealing, and the choices you were given weren't obnoxiously obvious. So I recommend it!

Each of the optainable males have unique personalities, and while they may fall hard on certain traits (shyness, bookishness) there are still surprises and they're all capable of character development.

Here's the basics of the game, you can decide if they're pros or cons because I find what some people see as positive might be negative to someone else.

    [*]Simple, cute story. Nothing groundbreaking, but still enjoyable.
    [*]Can plant seeds and grow plants. Money is meaningless in that you can't buy anything but more seeds, but the amount you earn will affect what ending you get. (I guess it shows that you stopped being just a lazy college student?)
    [*]Diverse cast with individual personalities and are capable of development.
    [*]Colorful and cute visuals, especially for specific scenes at the end (if you don't get the alone ending).
