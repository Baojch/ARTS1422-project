This is definitely a game I did better on as I woke up.  The first time you blow yourself up you'll be awake.  Trust me.

Sometimes I get a little annoyed when some of the wire traces are hidden or tough to track, but that really doesn't happen often.  More often than not, I'll blow myself up because I forgot to trace a wire back to the power source before I flicked a switch.  Good times.

Bomb Squad Academy is a pretty well-done, though short, logic puzzler with the backdrop of defusing bombs. Every level is a lesson about a circuit component or a bomb to be defused.  The number of levels is decent with slowly increasing difficulty such that the game avoids becoming tiresome or annoying or overwhelming. You interact with the mouse cursor only which works well, using a mousepad could prove difficult at times. Graphics are more than adequate and the music is relaxing when not interspersed with the timer countdown beeps (can be turned off in the options). You should be able to complete the whole game in 90 to 120 minutes.

+ Nice graphics
+ Relaxed background music
+ Logical puzzles
+ Well put together

Basically, it's just what it looks like: learn how the circuitry works. Learn what sets off the bombs. Load level... Ack! You've got 1-2 minutes to scan the circuit board attached to the time bomb. Now you've got to decide which wires to clip, which switches to flip, what buttons to press, etc. If you can defuse the bomb in the given time, hooray, everyone is saved. If you screw up, the screen turns white and you hear an explosion. You're dead!

It's not the most challenging game I've ever played, but they're fun little puzzles, and it really does give you that kind of ""CLIP THE BLUE WIRE! NOT THE GREEN ONE!"" feel of defusing a bomb.

Short games aren't bad, but they're not worth the the cost of 5p per min, in comparason to comparbably priced offerings, its just too much for a game like this.

It's a lovely lovely game, but it's a wordsearch not the times crossword, and isn't long or challanging enough to justify it's price.

The worst part is for double the dev time, it would have been very easy to impliment a endless mode with precedurally generated bombs basicly forever, as the computer only needs to follow 4 rules (If det is powered hit player lose, if disarm is powered palyer win, if time run out on intergrated detonator palyer lose, battery must be able to power all eliments)

Beyond that the computer only needs to drop a random path eliment and that's compatable with a solution. 

That's it, So the lack of an endless mode is increadbly disapointing. 

What is there is polished, and baby's first electronics project.  

But at £5 I cannot recomend in the face of steams other options and offerings.

I mean thats  book, audiobook, or film price there are better value propstion just here on steam. 

That said I enioyed every miniute of the game, but I could have called my best friend and been even happier, and sadly everything is relitive.

Wait for a sale.

Sorry Systemic, you tried, better luck next time. <3

UPDATE: the game's levels number have reportedly doubled since 28th of december, making it a relivtely higher value propostion, but still quite steep at around 2p a minitue. 

That said it's really nice the game has been updated for free. 

Hopefully if you're really into bomb disposasl this will increase the value.

However, it's still a one and done game, there is no replayablity other than as a repeat which is true of all things.

[b]The good:[/b]
[list]
[*]The simplified electrical concepts they use are well implemented and consistent.  And clear.  From an in-game UI point of view it's very well done.
[*]Each new concept is explained clearly with simple examples followed by more complex ones.
[*]The difficulty is graded very nicely.
[*]The puzzle elements are neat; and there are enough of them to be intreresting.
[*]When I got to the end I wanted more (it is an engaging game)
[/list]

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
[*]It's very short.  It probably took me about 90 minutes to complete from start to finish.  I got to the end expecting the ""real"" game to start to discover that was it.
[*]The first time I started it, the background music came on but the game itself didn't start.
[*]There's no support for multiple save games.

Bomb Squad Academy был выпущен 28 марта 2017 года ребятами из Systemic Games. Цена на этот продукт составляет 129 рублей в России и 2.99$ в странах СНГ.

[list]

[*] В Bomb Squad Academy мы будем исполнять роль будущего сапёра, который должен пройти сначала Академию Сапёров. Игра представляет из себя что-то типа головоломки с целью обезвредить бомбу. Нам дают бомбу, дают указания и мы должны с этими подсказками справится с бомбой. 

Разнообразие бомб есть, но не настолько много сколько хотелось бы. Самый главный минус данной игры – её продолжительность. Игра выполнена шикарно, арт замечательный, но прохождение всей игры займёт максимум час, а это ужасно мало. Вы не успеете влиться в роль сапёра как игра закончится. Разработчик обещает обновление, но пока его не видно.

[*] Бомбы выглядят замечательно. Это не 3D, но зато красиво нарисованная 2D схема бомбы. Оценить всю графику вы можете сами.

[/list]

Вердикт:[i] нереально интересная, продуманная игра, но нереально короткая. К сожалению её цена всё же немного больше продолжительности её геймплея. Советую покупать всем, но желательно со скидкой больше 15%. [/i]

Оценка:[b] 7.5/10[/b]. Очень годно – очень коротко.

I love logic games, Zachtronic games being some of the best (Spacechem, Shenzen I/O, Infinifactory, etc), and this game has the potential to sit right up there with some of them...if there were more to it. I played through the whole game in 50 minutes.

But everyone talks about that so let me tell you what I love about this game.

Now, normally I really hate adding pressure to puzzles. It feels like an unnecessary addition to what, in my mind, should be a relaxing experience. But the way timers are used in this game is great, and I feel it really added something I haven't seen in other logic games. Multiple timers, timers that do different things, timers that play against each other, timers that you need to manipulate in different orders and different ways - it's just great. And if you are of a nervous disposition you can always just set off the bomb and study the circuit at your leisure. You can even still interact with the components on the board after the bomb goes off. I'm really glad that feature is in there even though I didn't take advantage of it much. I did reset a few bombs because I knew I was going to run out of time, but overall I actually really enjoyed playing against the clock, and that's about the highest praise I can give for a puzzle game that adds stress as a main element.

Steam tells me I have 1.5 hours in this game, and 38 minutes of that I was on the phone and didn't bother to shut the game down, and I've played through completely. So it'll take you around an hour if you are somewhat experienced in logic puzzles, probably up to two if you aren't - the levels are very short (there is usually a one- or two-minute timer), and success or failure are often pretty much instant.

What is this game about? It's a logic puzzle game. There's sources of energy and lines on which the energy travels, there's components on those lines, such as switches, logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) and some others, that will change on which lines the energy travels or doesn't. The goal is to either get the energy to certain endpoints (often multiple ones, at the same time) or to cut an already existing energy line, all while avoiding to supply energy to specific other endpoints.

Namely, for most levels, there's a timer with detonator, featuring one endpoint for power which is already supplied by default, one to three ""disarm"" endpoints that have to be simultaneously supplied with energy to work, and one ""detonator"" endpoint, supplying which will mean instant defeat. A few levels are introduction levels, which only serve to show off how a part works, and the remainder - slightly more than a handful, really - are the most interesting ones, featuring clocks and detonators as separate parts, with the goal being either to cut power to the clock, to the detonator, or to cut the connection between the power output of the clock (that goes active once the clock hits 00:00) and the detonator input of the detonator.

I don't want to spoil too much, but there's levels with traps, less-than-obvious solutions and some with a simple fix to a very complex problem.

良い点
・雰囲気はよい
・論理演算の基本的な部分を遊びながら学べる部分もある

悪い点
・とにかく短い、ちょっとグダグダしながら遊んでも1時間で終わってしまう
・しかもプレイ出来るステージの半数がチュートリアル的な内容なので、実際パズルを解いていると感じるのはステージ数の半分くらい

Na jedné straně jde o skvostně uchopený nápad formou škola hrou, kdy vás to nenáročnou, poučnou, atraktivní a zábavnou formou naučí základům elektroniky a jejích obvodů skrze jednotlivé blbovzdorně srozumitelné kroky/puzzly, které vám dají dostatek prostoru pro vyblbnutí se všemi těmi spínači, bateriemi, tlačítky, hradly apod.

 Na druhou stranu to i při šnečím tempu vašich mozkových závitů vystačí na ani ne hodinu a půl zábavy. A to více než hodina z toho je ve své podstatě tutoriálem a samotné regulérní puzzly tedy vystačí sotva na dvacet minut. Navíc i na tak malém prostoru se záhy začne zajídat otřesná kolovrátková hudební stopa; naštěstí se dá vypnout.

 Jakkoli to tedy lze spíše doporučit, tak je dobré si předně ujasnit/přizpůsobit svá očekávání. Pokud to budete brát především jako vhled do základů elektroniky a až v druhé řadě jako logickou hru či se spolehnete na to, že tvůrce bude do hry nadále pravidelně přidávat obsah ve velkém, tak není proč to nedoporučit. Pokud do toho však jdete s vidinou atraktivního námětu a vděčného puzzle potenciálu (slibující nejprve detailní prostudování zapojení v časovém presu a následné úpravy obvodu pro jeho přehrazení nebo odpojení), tak bych se tomu spíše vyhnul. Což je škoda, protože v tom je na každé obrazovce znát nesporný potenciál na nejeden zapeklitý puzzle. Bohužel je to potenciál pouze tušený, ovšem do praxe nepřevedený; resp. terminologií hry... Nespájený.

At Bomb Squad Academy, learn how to defuse bombs as you go level by level. Your instructor being very positive and eager to teach you the works of all the different concepts separated by eight different chapters. You'll be graduating in no time.

With the goal for players to understand how to defuse bombs, at least in-game, is very important that you nail a tutorial or that it can be understood by most of the players. Sometimes this will come before and hope that it can be remembered throughout the game or be optional if the player does not want to play or read through it. Bomb Squad Academy takes a different approach. The first thing you do in a chapter is tutorial levels in a school like way. This works well with how it was tackled. You are immediately introduced to this happy teacher showing you the ropes. Each on a tutorial circuit board, you are able to click, turn, or cut with no way to fail as it is not attached to a bomb. It doesn't try Backing off at the right time so you can prove that you learned that certain concept. I never thought there was too much tutorial bombs in a row and understood everything after. There was one that I did have to go back and redo, but it was due to a simple misunderstanding of a component.

As you pass the tutorials, the real thing is presented to you. Each level starts with the cheery teacher encouraging you before the bomb is revealed. The music changes to a tense theme as you try to complete a bomb before the timer goes out. All you have to do is either take away the power, or deactivate it by lighting up the disarming areas. The ticking of the timer staying in the back of your mind as you constantly look over as you try to deactivate it. Having to look over where the power will go and directing it's path with switches and dials. This is of course complicated by other components to trick you up such as wires directing power to other areas or AND and OR gates standing in your way. As each bomb uses logic and each board is constructed carefully, it does not seem like it was unfair. Pushing and cutting at random is not the way to go, especially when dealing with the be complicated ones.

You are mostly left alone with these bombs with the occasional notes to offer subtle hints such as ""Closed Loop"" or to give some humor. Let the timer go out and you are dead. Redirect the power to the detonate area and you are dead. There is not any consequences as you do get to start over, but there is a loud bang and a white light to symbolize an explosion. Your instructor also steps in with a dark but witty sayings after, ""Too bad, you killed yourself, and everyone"", bring the teaching setting further. The upside is that you do get a chance to see how you messed it up. Letting you not make the mistake again and plan for what you will do next.

What is interesting is how there are multiple designs for bombs. Simple ones looks like it's on a wrapped and duct tapped item while others have more of a outwards appearance of cylinders being together. Whether it be two, a few stuck together, or what suspiciously looks like a dynamite bomb. As the game acts like it is a school, it is cool to see that it brings in different designs to prepare the student to see when they do a real bomb.

The game will generally take at least over an hour to complete as it is easy most of the time. But the developer has said there are more things to come. More components are being thought up to put into the game. A circuit board editor is going to be worked on. Letting the players make workshop bombs and letting the developer make more boards faster. A random generator is also being thought up and trying to see if the feeling of a carefully constructed game can stay true. This is very encouraging to see how the developer wants to try and tackle hard goals and gives a lot of potential to Bomb Squad Academy.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
+ Great way to show players how each component works with separating tutorials
+ The school vibe is handled well and persists throughout
+ The logic behind each is understandable to the player no matter how hard

- Can be too short for some to consider

Bomb Squad Academy is about defusing bombs by going through a logic puzzle. The way it keeps this learning area is great and works well in teaching the player. Giving a sense of urgency as each bomb has a timer ticking down as you try to deactivate it. However as the content can be finished in one to two hours, this can turn people away despite how polished and great this game is. There is a lot of potential for more content to be added to an already great game. It may even teach you something about electronics no matter how simplified it presents this.

1st - Game is to short, yes I agree, BUT!!!!!!!
2nd - If developer plans on the new features that has been spoken about will be a great game to play.

Now the game will be short yes for those that want to complain. It is a great game overall due to the thinking that is envoled with it. I would recommend this game, and have, to others to enjoy and get it now while it is only 7$

Money per game play people complain about that it is to short to play, while this is a factor in most cases in this sadly it is as well. I have more experince in this kinda game than most of my friends that may play, it does allow me to have enjoyment from the short time I played.

2 ways to play the game - with the ""power"" being shown and another without it being shown. 
So I intend to play gain without power showing after taking a break from it to see how i fair without the showing.

SO in conclusion, I would be happy to advise others to get this game as it will show how curcits work and might be somthing for kids to get ideas on how they work.

Guz explained it in more detail:

[quote=Guz]Great idea for a game, diffusing Bombs Old school with cliping wires and pressing switches. It's nicely polished as well, but it's lacking content. I think the average person will be done in less than an hour.

While playing the game you get the distinct feeling that the creators of the game didn't have a too firm grasp of the underlying concepts of logic gates or just plain electronics themselves. The OR Gate for example has a whole tutorial section, when it serves no function that a forked trace wouldn't have fullfiled in most cases. Also the last puzzle in the second to last section features a solution that is - in contrast to the rest of the game - physically impossible to create with real world electronics (a circuit that powers itself). 

The puzzle design is also somewhat lackluster, some puzzles are solved by just clipping all wires or switching all switches and many don't even have a way for you to accidently trigger the explosion prematurely.

The mechanical foundation on the other hand is very solid and if this ever gets workshop support i think the user generated content will make up for the way too easy and not well thought out puzzles included in the base game.[/quote]",1491079237,1491079237,False,0,0,0.465116292238235474,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a puzzle game that teaches you rudimentary electronics under the guise of diffusing bombs.  It starts off simple, with basic concepts like switches and wire cutting, then gradually introduces more complex things, like capacitors, push buttons, a few logic gates, etc...

If I had to come up with a complaint, it's too short.  I finished it in a little over an hour, but that was in one sitting, and I was engaged the whole time, considering the possible ramifications of each little button press, each wire cut.

Now that the complaint is out of the way, here's what I liked:
1:  I greatly enjoyed the core concept, solving puzzles to diffuse bombs, but then again, I'm probably slightly biased toward puzzle games.
2:  I liked the implementation, specifically, how they ramped up the complexity rather than just dumping stuff on you all at once.  The way I see it, it makes the game approachable.
3:  I don't know why, but I really got a kick out of the tension created by the two constraints you have to operate under:  you have to get the circuit to behave the way you want to in a short time limit (anywhere from 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds, and sometimes even 2 minutes) AND you can't mess up.  That, I think, was the bigger part of that equation, predicting that this wire I'm about to cut will diffuse the bomb, being wrong, and being greeted by the White Screen of 'Asploding.

If this game gets updated, and/or gets Workshop implemented, I think it'll really shine.

It's a logic puzzle game reminiscent of zachtronics games, based on circuitry and logic gates, where instead of being presented with a straight-up puzzle or being asked to produce a particular output, you have to disarm a bomb. It's quite good. It really eases you into it if you've never played such a game before, but it does throw in some clever tricks, and the sense of tension that goes along with a ticking bomb adds something to it. But it's too short.

I got through this entire game in 74 minutes, and I would say that despite having played similar games in the past I actually had a bit more trouble with it than I should have had. Even someone who's not a fan of logic games or puzzle games at all could get through the game at least as fast, probably faster.

The game desperately needs a level/bomb editor and workshop support. I really, really hope the dev uses some of the money they're getting from this to work on adding those things, along with some other additions: more mechanisms (particularly detonator types; I feel like there's some potential to get creative with bombs that need you to do things other than cut off the power or send power to the right places to defuse them) and possibly even stuff to build more than just bombs in an editor mode. With user content and Workshop support, this could be almost on par with some of the best games in the genre (i.e. zachtronics, pretty much) but more accessible to people who aren't puzzle/electrical engineering/programming nerds.

At CDN$ 6.62 (15% off), I was pretty disappointed. At the same time, let's be honest, some of my lunches cost more than $6.62, so I can't complain too much. It's not such an unfair price even if you can get more content for the same price in other games. But if the dev uses some of the money to add Workshop support and/or more content, I'll be more than satisfied.",1490928682,1490928682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]PROS[/b]:
[list]
 [*]I had fun!
 [*]Simple puzzle mechanics, but by no means a cake walk. I blew myself up on purpose and accidentally.
 [*]The beeping timers added a fun layer of stress.
 [*]Tutorials introduce the different components nicely (logic gates, capacitors, buttons...) and mix them together in interesting ways.
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b]:
[list]
 [*]Felt short, I was disappointed when I finished the game, I really wanted more!
 [*]No replayability after completing the game.
 [*]VERY minor graphical issue.  The whole bomb would scale down slightly when clicking on buttons.
[/list]

[b]WISH LIST[/b]:
[list]
 [*]More puzzles! I would come back and play more for harder puzzles.
 [*]Editor for community created content.

The game balances between simple layouts that allow for quick deduction of the implications of a particular action ... and obfuscated layouts that try to hide the system from you and deny you a clear deductive path. Of course, the whole thing falls apart when you consider that a given level's board doesn't change between attempts.

Avouez que vous avez toujours voulu le couper ce satané fil rouge hein! Avec Bomb Squad Academy c'est enfin possible! Mais attention le résultat sera potentiellement explosif si vous n'avez pas planifié votre coup correctement!!

Le principe du jeu est assez simple: vous êtes devant un circuit électronique (simplifié!) avec un compte à rebours, lui même relié à de l'explosif! Le but est alors d'intéragir avec le circuit (par exemple en coupant un fil ou en manipulant un interrupteur) afin de rendre la bombe inopérante. Pour vous aider, le jeu affiche le trajet du courant, ce qui vous permet de de voir rapidement les conséquences de vos actions. (La visualisation du courant est désactivable dans les options, mais c'est à ne conseiller qu'aux forcenés!)

La progressivité est vraiment très bonne, chaque composant de circuit est présenté dans un tutorial où il est le centre de l'attention, et les concepts permettant de désamorcer une bombe sont appris au fur et à mesure des niveaux.
J'ai été agréablement surpris par le nombre de composants proposés, je ne m'attendais pas à retrouver condensateurs ou autres bascules dans l'arsenal utilisé par les poseurs de bombes (ou plutôt les ""instructeurs"" de l'académie). Cela change des jeux qui n'utilisent principalement que des classiques portes logiques ""ET"", ""OU"" etc.

Les concepts utilisés dans les bombes sont vraiment très sympas, l'interface est super inuitive et on ne peut pas s'empêcher de sourire lorsqu'on découvre un piège tendu dans un circuit de bombe, que ce soit au moment où on l'évite (sourire de victoire) ou quand on tombe dedans (la réalisation qu'on s'est fait duper!)

Point important: le jeu n'est qu'en anglais (pour l'instant?) mais cela ne gêne vraiment en rien la compréhension étant donné que le jeu nous fait tout apprendre par la manipulation directe et non pas par le discours (C'est la filière BAC PRO du déminage, pas la fac' :-) ).

Sinon, le jeu est encore un poil court pour les acharnés (ou les programmeurs qui ont l'habitude de ces concepts), et si vous vous sentez visés par la catégorie, n'hésitez pas à désactiver la visualisation du trajet du courant dans les options, ça crée réellement un challenge supplémentaire !! Mais quoi qu'il en soit, j'espère (et je pense!) que des niveaux supplémentaires (ou un éditeur permettant le partage de niveaux sur Steam?) seront bientôt proposés par les développeurs.

En conclusion: les quelques euros que m'a coûté ce jeu ont été, je trouve, bien investis car j'ai pris beaucoup de plaisir à y jouer. L'expérience de jeu est vraiment sympa et la variété des briques de bases est clairement rafraîchissante! Il ne manque qu'un peu du contenu additionnel pour combler l'insatiable démineur que je suis devenu!!

This game is just booming with explosive fun.  
I was worried it would be a dud, but its just bursting with great gameplay.
Defusing these bombs was a blast.
I'll probably get a lot of fallout from these puns, but I just could not re-fuse!
Some people may believe there is not mush-room for puns in a review, but I was hoping to make an impact.

On a more serious note, this is a pretty good game overall.  The game starts with solving simple circuit problems.  Your objective is to sent current down a ""diffuse"" path, while avoiding the detonate path.  Some bombs require you to cut power to the detonator altogether.  It starts with simple rocker switches, progresses to cutting wires, and ramps up to ""AND"" gates from there.  Each section adds a new mechanic on top of what you learned in previous sections.  On top of all that, the bomb steadily counts down until detonation (you can increase time allowed in options if you are struggling).

[h1]PROS[/h1]
-Very fun gameplay
-Great soundtrack
-Graphics are very appealing and fit this genre
-The difficulty ramped up at a good rate as I progessed throughout the levels
-The game gives you a fair amount of time to defuse on each level
-Defuse mechanics are fun and can even teach about simple circuitry
-I enjoyed the little comments you receive when you fail and blow up the bomb 
-Priced fairly
-Did not encounter any bugs or glitches
