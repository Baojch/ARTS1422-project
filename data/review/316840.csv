The Sacred Tears TRUE is a game that focuses the tree rather than the forest which I feel really enhances the experience. The story is nothing ground breaking as it is fairly generic,  it follows the day to day happenings of the MC and how the MC goes about achieving his goal(s). The world around the MC keeps progressing even when the MC is not directly involved. 

The cast of characters are fairly fleshed out, we are given enough information about them to understand that they have their goals and ambitions. They are also involved just enough in the story to help enhance and progress the story rather than becoming a hindrance to it as it is not their story, it's the MC's.

The game was very easy as I literately beat 90%-95% of all the combat encounters using the first three cards while the rest of my cards were for boss fights only (barely even used them for the bosses). The card based combat system was quite enjoyable, I see other people say how the game's RNG based combat system is holding it back. I disagree with them on that. The combat system requires a bit of predicting on the player's part as being able to predict the opponent's card could be what saves you from a fatal hit or not, if you don't like predicting you can literately just face tank through all the attacks, but that will cost you a little bit of healing items.

I did encounter a few bugs and things that I wish could be improved on, but seeing how the game came out on August 10th 2005 I'm not going to complain about it.

All in all I'd recommend it, like I said quite the little gem.

- While I love the design and art, I do have a feeling the original game was designed for a smaller screen (gameboy? mobile?). For the game itself this isn't an issue, but for the cutscenes the artwork is noticeable ‘pixely’. 
- There are certain side-quests that have you run all over the place with little to no hint where to go. In particular ‘The Royal Friend’ quest, and the quest with the arsonist (after he ran away, I wasn’t able to find him at all. As a result I had to abandon that quest).

It had a great story, a good art style, and some nice music, especially the ending music.

At first, the mechanic of using cards in battle seemed a bit weird, but I came to be quite fond of it. It was certainly more unique in that aspect, and the animations of the attacks were awesome looking. In fact, the animations in general were great, and the fact that they get better as you upgrade them is a nice detail.
Speaking more about the story, as I said, I think it was great and it had some funny dialogue. There were some parts that weren't that amazing, but overall it was quite good. I think it's the game's best feature.
It only was sometimes grindy to try and get some good rolls on the cards before going against a boss, but luckily enough, that only happened 4 times and only towards the end of the game, so not as bad, with the boss fights being quite tough but giving a great feeling when you finally defeated them.

Speaking of bad stuff, I did find quite a few bugs, some typos, and some bad design. For example, in Main Chapter 15 there will be a cutscene at the start but the text isn't that readable because of how low quality it is so it made me have to reset to reread multiple times just to be able to understand it and finally I thought the game was a bit too open as in it wasn't very clear on what I should do or go to unlock side chapters which made me a bit paranoid if I was missing any of them or any other bonus thing with it not being apparant until you finish the chapter, or in some cases until several chapters later, I often found myself with 2 seperate guides open just in case to check before I progress the story if I had missed anything, so it is definitely a bit confusing at times.

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
This is one of the higher-quality [i]RPG Maker[/i] games that I have played in terms of visuals and sounds. The graphics might be blurry, but everything was made in great detail to compensate for it. Almost all animations, even if it's just flipping books, are animated to make it clear as to what the character is doing. Other actions that can't be portrayed by the sprites are replaced by great-looking cutscenes. The cutscenes themselves look rough at first glance, but they give a unique style to the game. Emotions are captured perfectly with the varying colors that help to enhance them to their fullest. It makes you feel like you were playing JRPGs from the old times, especially with the music that accompanies them.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story might be a hit and miss to some people. It tells about the life of two people on day to day basis, whether it's about their friends or jobs. At the same time, the main plot will progress right behind the scenes to create tension for the final battle. However, the story feels rushed at the end with the amount of explanation in the final chapter. Other threats that were built up to that point were also scrapped at the end, making everything feel weird. The game feels like a part of a greater universe of some sort because of it.

On the other hand, the bonding between each character is great. There is no right or wrong in their actions, even the main characters. You'll take a liking to all characters on each side of the conflict, whether it's because of their personality or relationship. To be honest, I would prefer if the game was focused more on this side without the main plot.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game has 24 main quests and 23 side quests in total, where the latter one will be unlocked after you fulfilled certain requirements. Each quest can be finished in ~30 minutes, save for the very last main quest that can take longer depending on how you approach it. They all focus on one objective where you need to either explore a new area or simply just talk to everyone in the town.

There are more than one ways to solve your objective. You can try to force your way through or try to get some help to open a locked door. The most straightforward way usually gives less to no reward with some penalties, so you might want to be thorough before making a decision. Although this looks clever, this adds another problem to the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=318639965

You will be forced to talk to everyone in the town to progress sometimes. Since you need to find out how to solve your objective to get the most reward, talking to everyone in town is unavoidable. However, the town is very vast - there are 4 blocks with numerous amounts of buildings and people to enter and talk to. It can be tedious talking to them every time you are stumped. Moreover, some NPCs will give the same dialogues, furthering no reason to talk to them over and over again for a slight chance that it might change later on.

[b]Combat[/b]
Combat is unique. You have a set of cards with different icons and points in them. You can put 3 cards into play each turn, pitting each of them against the enemies'. The higher point card between the two will then be active, doing an action based on its icon. Since you can't see the enemy's card at first, you can try to predict it based on the color, adding strategy elements into it. It was fun trying out the mechanic, although it will soon become another source of problems as well.

Combat is RNG-based. You might have several cards in your hand, but that said card will be replaced after use. Since the card replacement is random, it can be better or worse than your used card. This causes issues in boss fights, especially if the fight takes too long. The game can screw you up by replacing your cards with 1-point cards over and over again, and the only thing you can do is by loading your save and hoping for the RNG to be better. Luckily, the game also tries to mitigate this by giving a lot of health potions drop in battle. Everything becomes more manageable later on, although you might still need a bit of luck to defeat the harder bosses.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=318640007

There are too many enemies to fight. Despite using touch-based encounters, enemies tend to be placed in narrow places with almost no way to run from. You'll have to engage in combat most of the time until you get sick of it. Although it might give a reason to build a better ""deck"" before going to boss fights, it hinders explorations sometimes. I was too lazy to go outside the town since I don't want to keep on fighting battles. Moreover, enemies are scaled based on your level, so leveling up will just make normal enemies stronger.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
To be honest, I'm not sure how long I spent finishing the game. I forgot to close the game launcher several times whenever I wanted to take a break. I estimated the game to be ~20h long if you use a guide, longer if you decided to explore everything on your own. Most of the additional time will be spent talking to the townfolks to finish quests, however.

The game isn't hard, but it can be annoying due to the RNG factor. You need to save after almost every battle just in case the RNG screws you up and kills you in battle. I couldn't count how many times I had to load my save because of this.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=581653344

[b]Problems[/b]
One cutscene has texts that are hard to read, even on the lower resolution.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]The Sacred Tears TRUE[/b] is a hit and miss to me. It's a high-quality [i]RPG Maker[/i] game with a lot of customizations, whether it's for the graphics or the battle system. However, some mechanics can be problematic sometimes. It can be tedious to talk to all townfolks in almost all quests and reload your save file just because the game decided to give you low point cards in battle. Luckily, both of these points can be addressed by using a guide and health potions - the latter are abundant in the game.

For me, the most memorable thing about this game lies in its cutscene visuals and music. People who like to play JRPGs will feel at home with the quality, especially those who like to play games with similar visuals. However, although it has a great quality for the price it offers, you might want to be wary of the cons before buying.

The system works well on paper. The player receives a 'hand' of cards, and chooses three to play. The cards are compared to the choices of the enemy, and combat plays out depending on who has the better cards, and which cards were chosen. Block attacks, make regular attacks, make special attacks, or get an ally to cast a spell (or, in the instances were said ally is unavailable, use the spell cards to negate the enemy attacks). The goal is to bring the enemy's HP down to zero.

However, the execution leaves more to be desired. After the first few chapters, the difficulty of the battles ramps up greatly.  Even with the 'tells' of enemies helping out, I was forced to rely on working to get the levels of my cards up to 5/S for bosses. and cards are consumed after use. Why not level grind? I did; the enemies scale with the player (an early-game side-boss became a common mob after reaching late in the story). To make matters worse, the only way to really effectively use the main character after a point is to place everything into Health and Attack. And then, if you haven't planned ahead, you can still get screwed over by getting stuck with all low-powered cards.

If you have patience, the story and visuals are great, and a few missions don't require combat at all. However, you will have to struggle with the combat system to advance; if you can't handle it, avoid.

Take the role of thieves in a para-fantasy universe.  There's some semblance of a story here but it's muddled by godawful retro pixel graphics.  While changes have been made to the stock RPG Maker combat system, they don't improve on the stock RPG Maker combat system... it's still a terrible, weak mockery of the old FF games.   Ugly retro pixel graphics aside, the developers also failed by including graphics that aren't retro pixel.  This defeats the purpose of trying to be retro.  Also, resolution and controls are fixed, and the fullscreen mode causes a crash (why don't indy shovelware devs ever test their junk before inflicting it on the Steam store?) so this game falls beneath minimum standard for PC. 

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.   This is just a sad exercise in putting a lot of work into making something terrible.  Imagine if the developers had made a proper 21st century RPG instead of this retro crap.

The Sacred Tears TRUE follows the adventures of Seil and Seana, newbie thieves that are trying to make a name for themselves. The plot starts of pretty simple, it's just the duo trying to make a living being thieves and doing other errands to make ends meet. The plot slowly evolves  into something much bigger behind the scenes, introducing political conflicts between nation and religious organisations. 

The game follows a episodic structure, similar to a TV show. The story is linear but sometimes the chapters feel like they're their own thing, which makes the plot feel a bit unorganised.

The gameplay is quite easy to follow, it's quite different from your average JRPG but at the same time it feels familiar. There are different levels of cards and different types, if you play the higher card or the card that has a higher priority if it's the same level card, then you play your card. The game explains how you can predict what cards your opponent has but it still feels very RNG based, especially during boss battles when your opponent is playing higher level cards and you keep getting level 1 cards. 

For an RPG Maker game it's a great effort, probably the best RPG Maker game I have played, the characters are great, the story was pretty good and the gameplay was quite unique.

TLDR: Pixelated and dated with a rather suffocating field of view thats too close up. Odd choice of themes for the narrative.

This is an RPGMaker game with some decent animation and what looks to be a fully fledged inventory system, and decent effort went into the user interface. It has much more of a legitimate RPG feel to it than many RPGMaker games out there. You play two young thieves, who I suppose try to get by, the relationship with the rest of the world is odd. The game starts with them being chased, but then after the intro you are at the village and nobody is chasing you. Most characters would just say a simple sentence blurb and the game would not allow me to open any chests because it wanted me to build thievery skill first, while also restricting exploration by insisting I find the quest location instead.

Maybe it is true that I did not really give the game much of a chance, but the first impression was pretty poor overall, the world and setting had little to no initial hook. It seems like the main draw would be to care for, and watch over, the two main protagonists. Which, to me, come across as your generic animegirl and animeguy.

Conclusion: I will archive this permanently in hidden library. I can go find it there should I for some reason decide to play this indepth.

The Sacred Tears TRUE hatte ich schon eine Weile in meiner Steam-Bibliothek herumschwirren. Bislang hatte mich immer der Gedanke an das Karten-Kampfystem abgeschreckt. Doch diese Bedenken waren letztendlich unbegründet, denn die Kämpfe werden flott abgewickelt und die Spielmechaniken des Kampfsystems gehen schnell in Fleisch und Blut über. Sicherlich kann der Glücksfaktor der Kartenausgabe manchmal nerven, doch bleibt der Spielspaß immer auf einem hohen Niveau. Dabei ist das Kampfsystem nicht der einzige kreative Aspekt im Spiel. Der Titel strotzt nur so vor Ideen, Details und Spielmechaniken, die einen stets bei Laune halten. Zwar stolpert das Spiel hier und da über seine eigenen Ambitionen, doch sollten Freunde von Maker-RPGs aus dem gehobenen Qualitätssegment definitiv einen genaueren Blick darauf werfen.

Pro:
- selbsterstellte Grafiken und Soundtrack
- interessantes, flottes Karten-Kampfsystem
- angenehm bodenständige Handlung und liebenswerte Charaktere
- gewohnt unkomplizierte Steuerung mit Controller-Support
- gibt viele motivierende Spielelemente (Wanted-Punktezähler, die große Aufgabe 300.000 Geldeinheiten zusammenzusparen)
- gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. 9,99 € Steam-Standardpreis für ca. 35+ Stunden Spielzeit

Neutral:
- Das gesamte Spiel findet in ein und derselben Region statt (also keine Weltreise wie in anderen Spielen dieser Art), das könnte für manche auf Dauer eintönig werden

Kontra:
- der Glücks-Aspekt des Karten-Kampfsystems wird wohl nicht jedem gefallen
- erfordert ein recht hohes Maß an Grinding
- die Handlung mag für manch einen zu bodenständig und unspektakulär sein
- die Anbindung der Dash-Funktion an einen HP-beeinflussenden Konditionsbalken ist einfach unnötig und nervig",1474730590,1631026661,True,4,0,0.588751137256622314,2,False,False,False,False,,,

After reading other reviews and finishing the game and doing several playthroughs before actually finishing (so I could get the True Ending [Get 300,000 Fil]) I can say that there are mixed views of the game and a bit of ambiguity to this beast. I want to point out that the other reviews address legitamate issues, like the font size/style (the game need to have the japanese localized font to look better, there is a post about how to do this). There are complaints about the simplicity of the games' combat, admittedly the combat doesn't have too much depth but is still fun for that same reason. At times you will not think about how you are using your cards (randomly given card based combat, you will see) others I literally take like 5+ minutes before make a move. There is luck involved sometimes but for the most part if you strategize well battles will be a breeze. Don't forget to look at the guide attached to the game. It's the readme.html file, explains how to play, what stats are for and what they do (the game isn't thorough about explaining these in-game).

The Pros: 
Innovative-fun combat system albeit somewhat repetitive(stategic at times)
fun Dialoge
Serious plot moments, satisfying conclusion
Maybe some Romance (I thought it was nice)
Cute art design
Memorable Characters

The Cons:
poorly styled text (have to manually get japanese localized font to fix)
True ending is REALLY HARD to get (well you have to check everywhere since enemies don't drop fil)
Game still good without True ending
Combat takes a while to get used to
Certain characters plot not flushed out enough (i didn't unlock ALL chapters so that may be why)

All-in-All a great wonderful game I'd recomend to ppl that don't mind playing an RPGmaker style game, and are looking for something with great story and decent gameplay.

[noparse]Re-review[/noparse]

This was my second ever card based game that i ever played both on and out of Steam.
Gifted to me by a good friend, to whom gave me to choose any graphic novel back on the [b]Anime Weekend Sales[/b] list here on Steam, i was going to choose either [u]Sakura Spirit[/u][i](50% certain)[/i] or [u]Hate Plus[/u][i](90% certain)[/i] but by mystake, i ended up choosing this one fantasy JRPG by saying ""[b]I like Sacred Tears[/b]""[i](not being a novel)[/i], but by the time i was going to say ""[u]i choose Hate Plus[/u]"", the gift was already sent to me, and following the old saying ""[b]choosers cant be beggars[/b]"", i simply smiled.
So after trying the game out, i found myself really enjoying it.
Now being a treasure on my Steam library, the game is actually pretty good, but the only problem i found its that, the chapters are pretty short, sometimes only having one mission to finish it, and you play as a thief wannabe named Seil, not forgeting his long time guild friend Seana, not much to know about that.
Seana is a little bossy but hey, so are our mothers right? no?, just me? oh okay then.
Wen you´re finally able to move around the city, and given your first mission to get/save a golden cat, it´ll be like deja vu all over again, [b]Thank you Seil! But our cat is in another castle![/b], that said castle being a roof, then being a warehouse, would someone kindly stop doing that.

I really enjoyed the the art, characters, and story enough that I got around to 75% of the chapters, but this game has such a frustrating combat mechanic that I just dont want to continue grinding to advance the story. Again, I want to like and continue the game, but if looking up at a grind with the feeling of ""Oh fucks sake, this same thing AGAIN for a few hours?!"", and more frustration and boredom than actually enjoying the game, I'd rather quit.

The combat consists of a card-game mechanic, whereby you place any attack/defence/dodge/special cards with numeric values against your opponents. Sounds decent, right? The bad part is that any cards you draw are random, with random values, but you can save some in your inventory to use for later. BUT your characters health also sticks around.
This creates the situation where you're basically forced to grind for cards with high numeric values and health potions against bosses, because bosses will always have such ridiculous luck with their cards it turns into a situation where you just have to throw enough health potions at your character to make sure he gets lucky enough to get those high value attack/special cards, assuming the enemy doesn't have a defense/dodge card of the highest value.

The amount of customization that went into this RPG Maker game is pretty impressive. From a technical standpoint, I'm not displeased. The character design and artistic direction also overall remains satisfactory. 

Where things fall apart actually is the writing. It falls flat more often than not. You'll start a mission or side story and just as things begin to seem interesting, or you're invested in a cause, it immediately ends. For example, one of the last story missions I did involved me learning more about a shady finance company in town. The two main characters get involved in the plot, and then I sneak inside the building. It is not much of a scenario, we're done in less than five minutes with hardly a hitch other than one guy who tries to beat me up as I leave. The conclusion of the situation isn't even brought up in the ending, I simply return to my home and then can continue to the next part of the story where then in the next scenario I learn the company closed down. But why, how, I'm left with questions and I wish they were addressed. 

There is no problem with the idea of playing town vigilantes or heroes or thieves, or whatever exactly I'm suppose to be. But the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The townspeople did not grow on me, nor did I connect with the main characters either.

This game does everything SO right in terms of the the major things you expect from an RPG. It has excellent characters, an interesting setting, nice storytelling with story missions and smaller more inane side missions just for character developmnent/fluff.
Seriously its very well done, i have seen many MANY AAA publishers do far worse in this regard.

Then the combat system comes and ruins what would otherwise be an indie gem.
The combat system boils down to dicerolls plain and simple. Its card based so RNGesus had best be with you to draw high cards/your enemy draw low ones. Then to double dip on the randomness the game has a 20% chance of trolling you.
Let me explain, when an enemy plays a card it tells you what category of card was played (defence, attack, magic etc) but 20% of the time it will LIE. So you play your cards according to what the game tells you then SURPRISE you are now dead because all 3 cards were lies and you played the wrong cards!. 
Fun right?
You will be trolled and have to reload ALOT since there is no consistent strategy due to that 20% troll chance and just plain bad luck if you keep drawing low during a boss fight.

Harkening back to 90s-style console JRPG's, Sacred Tears puts you in the shoes of Seil and Seana, a pair of friends who've opened their own private investigative office (and struggle to pay the rent on their lavish house) while simultaneously working as members of their city's Thieves Guild. The game starts with the pair involved in a heist that goes south, and barely escaping before their monetary issues come to the forefront. As the main plot goes on, the player is drawn into their quest to steal a ""Sacred Tear"" (a highly-prized relic) from an art gallery, as well as dealing with machinations from their own guild and a neighbouring province looking to invade.

The best part about the game is that it takes place in a serialized fashion. You can pick and choose whether to carry on with the main story or pick up ""side jobs"" that often don't have combat, and are usually fetch quests for other people. Interestingly, the dialogue of NPCs you find in the city of Genoseed changes mission-to-mission, which does a great job of investing the player into the world and the characters' lives.

The game also has a battle system, which is where some of the flaws begin to expose themselves. You fight by drawing three cards in a glorified game of rock-paper-scissors, where certain commands (like dodging or attacking) trump other commands. After a certain point (and depending on whether you're overleveled), it becomes less a series of strategic moves and more a question of whether you start with enough attack/high-level cards (only found through new cards revealed during battles) that you can take down a high-level enemy before they kill you.

The music is well-orchestrated and fits with with the 90s aesthetic, but this in turn reveals another problem with the game - there are no graphic/sound options whatsoever. You either have to listen to the same track repeated over and over as you walk through Genoseed, or turn your volume off. Luckily, the game isn't resource-intensive, but it can still be annoying for some people.

The biggest problem I had with the game (and frankly, with a lot of RPGMaker games) is that there's no map to tell you where to go. More than once, I started a mission and had no idea what building I was supposed to go to next, spending time running in and out of districts until I found the place I needed to be. 

It doesn't help matters that the game practically requires you to have a guide in order to unlock the last few side missions, which only appear once you amassed $300,000. You pretty much have to scrounge for every secret room, hidden item and way of making money in order to achieve this goal, and I don't expect that many people would be able to do it without a walkthrough.

Likewise, the plot meanders for long periods of time, and the main character (Seil) is a bit of a fool who never really bothers to change his ways or ignores obvious cues people tell him throughout the game. The real star is Seana (who often chastizes you for your habits), who generally keeps things in check when Seil is lost, but doesn't have nearly enough to do in the game.

In the end, Sacred Tears TRUE stands out as a highlight among the glut of RPGMaker clones on Steam, and focuses on a ""slice-of-life"" story with lots to see, do and explore in an interesting way. It's just a shame that there are some minor issues that keep it from achieving true greatness.",1438879121,1438879121,True,18,0,0.601184248924255371,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Мне очень понравились рисованные портреты. Да, только и всего. Однако уже после нескольких часов игры я твёрдо убеждён: всё, что касается работы художника здесь великолепно. Стиль максимально прост, но вместе с тем крайне выразителен. А этого стало очень не хватать после засилья вычурной анимешной стилистики, напрочь лишённой авторской оригинальности. А вот в Sacred Tears оригинальность есть. Спасибо мангаке Такаси Конно за это. Ставлю ему твёрдую пятёрку.

 Кроме того, неоспоримым достоинством игры является то, что хоть она и сделана на самом ублюдском движке всех времён и народов (RPG Maker), это практически не бросается в глаза, потому что разработчики не стали использовать готовые рпгмейкорвкие ресурсы; они переделали всё, начиная от спрайтов, кончая всех меню и боевой системы. Если бы таких игр было больше, я бы не так сильно ненавидел Мейкер.

 В остальном ничего выдающегося в игре нет. Неплохие персонажи, местами забавные диалоги и отсылки к другим произведениям. Несколько необычная система боя. Вот и всё. Но самое плохое в игре то, что она смертельно скучна. Мне не удавалось за один присест поиграть больше получаса, да и эти полчаса проходят без особого рвения.

 Итог: Стал бы я рекомендовать игру широкой публике? Нет. Стоит ли она 250 рублей? Вряд ли. Стоит ли брать со скидкой? Ответ тот же.

[b]Argumento:[/b]
La vida en la ciudad no es fácil para los jóvenes Seil y Seana. Durante el día se ganan la vida realizando cualquier tipo de trabajo, desde rescatar gatitos a devolver libros a la biblioteca. Sin embargo, durante la noche nuestros héroes se dedican a cumplir peligrosas misiones para el gremio de ladrones, que incluyen allanar lugares, robar objetos valiosos y adquirir documentos de difícil acceso.

Sin embargo, ninguno de estos trabajos resultan suficientemente satisfactorios para Seil, quien tiene en su mente un solo objetivo: robar la gema más protegida y resguardada que existe, llamada ""The Sacred Tears"". 

[b]Jugabilidad:[/b]
El juego se desenvuelve en la ciudad, lugar donde el protagonista habla con los NPC, compra pociones, realiza transmutaciones, consigue trabajos, etc. Fuera de la ciudad tendrá acceso además a diferentes guaridas, mazmorras, bosques y otros lugares llenos de agresivos monstruos. 

Los combates se verifican a través de un sistema de cartas. Existen cinco cartas: ataque básico, ataque especial, defender, evadir y magia. Cada una de las cartas está asociada a un número (1-5), por lo que quien obtenga el número más alto le tocará actuar en ese turno (el sistema es complejo, por cualquier duda me pueden contactar). 

Los personajes van ganando experiencia y subiendo de nivel, por lo que deberán repartir puntos a la característica que se quiera subir. Además podrán equiparse algunos orbes que aumentarán aún más las características de los personajes.

Unique battle system made battles enjoyable and there wasn't much need for grinding in order to beat bosses. Sometimes in battle bad luck strikes, when opponent puls three level four attacks with one or more special attacks, when you least expect it. It's still possible to survive from this, if you use health potions between opponents attacks.

Cutscenes were nicely drawn, but it is impossible to skip them and there were couple of times. Saving is also very important and game doesn't never ask if you would want to save. I learned in hard way, that it is always good to save after fight. Those wolves are so annoying >_<. Best was after hard boss fight I didn't save and there was another boss!

I also didn't like fact that there were only four types of monsters, slimes, cats, wolves and bats with standard, enchanted and boss forms. In mission where there were soldiers were talking about monsters inside building I had to laugh when these ""monsters"" were cats.

Story - Not anything major, it has one but ultimately it's just chapter after chapter of what happens in the daily lives of the main characters. Personally I prefer this, as the characters in general are quite entertaining and they have a nice chemistry with one another. You play the role of Seil, a dude who wants to be a major thief, along side him is his child hood friend Seana.

Gameplay - I find that this game have relatively great gameplay for an rpgmaker title. You steal, your craft to some degree and you sell items. On your journey, you have quite a few problems to solve, and usually you can solve them in more than 1 way, usually the more in your face way will be less thief like and or cost you money. The battle system is what I consider the most important element next to characters in an rpg. It's a RPS turn based system with a bit of luck involved. It mostly consists of 5 actions:

Strong Attack - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with attack and magic if they're of the same level.
Attack - loses to dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.
Magic - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and attack if they're of the same level.
Defend - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.
Dodge - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.

The highest level card will always win, an example would be despite the fact that Strong attack beats dodge if they're the same level, if you attack with a level 2 strong attack amd the opponent happens to be using a level 3 dodge, the dodge will trump the strong attack. Looking at the strength and weaknesses above, you're probably thinking you should only use strong attacks or magic every chance you get. Well, you can't. This is where some of the ""Luck"" part of the game comes into play. In order to do any of the above actions, you must have the corresponding card to do so. When the fight begins you are assigned a total of 9 cards, these cards comes in varying levels of 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each turn you must use any 3 cards. When the next turn comes around you will automatically draw 3 new cards. 

The enemies you fight are limited to only using Strong Attacks, Attack, Defend and Dodge. The cards are color coded so you can guess about 80% of the time what enemy is gonna do, but you have little way of knowing the level of their action. Sometimes the enemy will try to bluff you, making you think a card they're using is a particular card, when in fact it's not. This doesnt happen too often, and your chances of prediction increases with Seil's agility parameter. 

Sound - Pretty good, sfx in fights sounds about right. The music is great imo.

Replay Value - I don't feel there's much if at all any, it's relatively impossible to miss a side event unless you wished to. However the game seems relatively long, I've only put 22 hours into the game and I feel confident that the game will last at least another 10-12 hours.

pick up and play whenever you feel like it, without feeling like you're pausing at a crucial 
point.

Yes this is an rpgmaker game but it is different from 99.9% of them. It has it's own menu (not that crap pre made one) i am pretty sure it has it's own music which is not bad. 

The battle system is unique which is rare for a game made on rpgm If i am not mitaken this uses the vx version  ?  Anyhow to the point it uses a card / luck based system You have you defend cards attack cards spell card and you evasion cards. So how this battle systems works is like this. 

enemy                                                           you 
2 defend  3 attack 2 attack                          3 attack 4 magic 3 defend 

Each card has a value up to 5  (1,2,3,4,S=5)   The set up i have above me will work like this 

On the first turn since i have 3 attack his 2 defend will do nothing. Other then reduce the damage. On the next turn i have 4 magic and he has 3 attack  magic is casted at random so sometimes you will get a buff spell or and attack or healing spell. Let's say we get an atack spell. we would basically negate his attack. (i think)   now he has 2 attack and i have 3 defend his attack would do nothing. 

there is a way to tell which card is which but that is explained in game. you can change the colour of you cards to try and fool the other player/monster  so there is a bit a thinking involved.  being a different rpgm game i would have to say give this a go it will not be for everyone. 

there are stats involved attack defense evasion ect when you level up you gain a point and you can choose which stats to increase.

Altho the ""8 chapters"" may be misleading at the start. Since every chapter is pretty short by itself, usually just one mission.

Now, the actual reviewing starts. I havent played into it too much, I am just 3 chapters in, but that was already enough to see some core gameplay.

lets start up with the battle system - The card based system may seem a bit complicated at the start, but in the end - its not. Cards have 5 Levels - 1,2,3,4 and S - and 5 actions - Attack, Special, Block, Dodge and Magic. you draw a hand of 8 and pick 3 of them. higher card does its action and when its a standoff there is a rock paper scissors system to determin who gets a hit in. Strategy comes in when you take enemy Prediction into account, meaning the color of their cards. but theres a guy right at the start explaining you all that.
And even tho it seems ovrwhelming at the beginning, it flows from your hand after 2 or 3 fights.

now to the art style - the FaceArt is pretty well made, the Intro and Chapter End Pictures all have a nice feel and good handdrawn style to them. the world is pretty colorful, altho sometimes a little overwhelming (more later). The character models themselves seem to bee pretty SD style, means they are more head than anything else.

Music - from what I could experience, the usic is good. Battle music gets one pumped and the town has that nice quiet peaceful feeling.

but I cand give all good things. some negative stuff that sprung to me.

first of all, You are playing a thief whose dayjob is to be a Private Investigator... best part - he goes thieving without any different outfit. He is out there in the same gear he can be seen through the day. then in the 3rd chapter someone actually comes into your office, having a job fr your thief Alter Ego... I will take it that the Guards are really stupid, this is a THief training Town or Suspension of disbelief.

then, the city is horribly cluttered. At least the starting one. Some paths cant be seen until you run into them, same with pickups. a lot of buildings you can only identify by waltzing right in.

all in all, I like it. Its to be recommended.

PS: if the dev reads this - could it be that this is a sidestory-ish of tears for Tiara ?  since I get a vibe from some names (namely the namegiving ""Goddess Tear"" as well as an Item that summons Tiara in Battle.",1411768515,1411768515,True,57,0,0.755210697650909424,0,True,False,False,False,,,
