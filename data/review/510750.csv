""Driftwood"" ist eine kostenlose Visual Novel.

Visual Novels sind eigentlich keine Spiele. Es sind vielmehr kleine Geschichten, interaktive Bücher, die meist Anime Optik haben. Häufig sieht man gezeichnete Standbilder während zu lesende Texte automatisiert durchlaufen. 

""Driftwood"" war ein Crowdfunding-Projekt. In der Story sind wir Marcus Feick, ein Schüler aus Boston, der vor allen Dingen mit anderen Schülern zusammentrifft. 

Technisch kann man dem Titel nicht viel vorwerfen. Mechanisch funktionieren die Umblendungen gut, die Grafik ist scharf, wenn auch etwas durchschnittlich, ein bißchen Klaviergeklimper gibts auch und einige ganz nette Sounds. Auch sprachlich ist das technisch gekonnt. Im Sprachraum des Englischen bewegt sich der Autor souverän, übel wird es allerdings, wenn man mal auf den Inhalt schaut.

Das Problem ist die Geschichte. Selten habe ich etwas derartig belangloses ertragen müssen. Der Protagonist ist uninspiriert langweilig und von nicht gerade überbordender Intelligenz, der beginnt, sich in ein Mädchen zu verlieben. Durch ein unerwartetes Ereignis wird er verletzt und von seinen Eltern auf ein Internat geschickt. Dort trifft er reihenweise belanglose Mitschüler, belanglose Lehrer, belanglose Angestellte und führt mit ihnen belanglose Gespräche. Da wird dann auch mal während des Keksebackens das Thema Rassismus in erschreckend platt-dümmlicher Weise abgehandelt oder man redet halt mal irgendwie so über Musik und so Sachen. Das ist alles so unwichtig, so nichstsagend, so inhaltsbefreit, daß man anfängt, sich nach Rosamunde Pilcher zu sehnen.

Angeblich lernt der Protagonist von jeder Begegnung etwas fürs Leben und Erwachsenwerden, nur was, bleibt stets unklar. Außerdem: von diesen Hohlbirnen etwas übers Leben zu lernen, wäre eine sichere Bank dafür, in ewiger Dummheit zu versanden.

Deswegen kann man den Titel keinem denkenden Wesen empfehlen. Man verliert nur wertvolle Lebenszeit.

i liked when some dudes in battle armor just saw MC in the street and decided he had to die, for no reason. he was across the street and the guy looked at him and shot him, and his girlfriend was like ""uugh, tell him to stop!!!"" because that always stops dudes with guns from shooting you. was this in Chicago or Boston? it flipped back and forth. what did the Mexican drug cartel have to do with anything? why were the robbers wearing battle armor? it just vaguely said body armor, were they paladins? 

why did this girl agree to go on a date with the MC if she knew she was going to break up with him after 2 days anyway? why does the doctor say the bullet missed the lungs and spine by millimeters when MC was shot in the upper arm? don't doctors know where lungs are? why is the uncle so creepy? 

why are the student dorms located at the end of a hiking trail in the middle of a forest, with just a nasty, rickety sign that says ""Dormatories"" on it? why was Yuko's sprite like twice the size of every other characters'? why were some of the backgrounds really nice and then others had wonky perspective? how many artists worked on this, seven? eight?

there was so much preamble to this kid going to a boarding school! why couldn't it have just been like: ""a couple'a guys who're up to no good, started makin' trouble in my neighborhood"" and then he just goes to the boarding school? did you really feel the need to explain why he's such a jaded asshole via being randomly shot by LARPers and his ""girlfriend"" breaking up with him? Why was the main character so shocked to see a black guy at his boarding school? Why did he remark about this guy being so black when he's beige at best? Why does nothing make sense?

It's not perfect, but I believe it is being wrongly criticized. This game is not a AAA title. Most visual novels aren't, so why would you hold this to similar standards? It's funded and was backed as a Kickstarter project. I know that Kickstarter has been and still can be shady in practice, but this seems like a legitimate passion project that had no intention of scamming people out of their finances. It's free-to-play, which is more redeemable than slapping a price on it for it to be purchased. They received the necessary means to create the game, and that's it. Their creation is out there and they expect nothing in return(unless you count actually playing the game or considering becoming a participant in the backing of act 2, which I've seen nothing about).

The game is surprisingly well-made, despite first impressions. You have a standard title/menu screen with all the necessary/typical features, even though all the unlockables are already given to you, for the most part. The graphics aren't the best you'll ever see, but the art and style is nice and fits the game well enough. The game alternates between text walls and somewhat lively backgrounds, making when characters are on screen feel more important. Oh, and they're not fully expressive, but are drawn to shift through emotional states and expressions. Also, effort did go towards adding a beginning and ending animated cinematic, and although it's recycled, it's appreciated. 

This doesn't function as your usual dating sim. There aren't any stats to manage or a routine schedule. It's still a dating sim, but definitely functions to that of the effect of a visual novel with multiple romantic endings. The choices aren't too excessive and they obviously affect the outcome of your experience. The romance options also have distinct and stereotypical tropes/personalities, so hopefully you relate to or become interested in at least one of them. Personally, I preferred a girl who went by the name Taryn. She was your tomboy, tsundere type, which happens to be my favorite.

The biggest issue I noticed among reviews was the writing of the game. I honestly don't know what people were expecting. This isn't reminiscent of hardcore novelists nor does it resemble any kind of sophisticated writing method. While I agree that the basis of the dialogue was a tad stereotypical and could be interpreted/perceived as insensitive/offensive or inaccuarte/exaggerated/unrealistic, it conveyed what needed to be expressed. Its purpose was fulfilled. Immediately we see an unconventional way to start the story, not rare or unheard of, but unconventional nonetheless. We get background information, knowledge of the setting, the environment, the tie-in of the novel's title to one of its many themes, understanding of how the characters operate and interact, a compelling/convincing conflict. It was handled quite well, and avoided coming off as too serious or not serious enough. The topics or themes that I mentioned? They explore the nature of humans and their interactions, adjustng to new/unfamiliar surroundings, learning/dealing with what entails when moving on from something previously in life and just change/progress in general, if we're just meant to drift through life almost on autopilot or if we actually do have an influence in which direction we go and what we experience. Yes, they're particularly heavier subjects, but as I said, they were handled the way the developers deemed appropriate, and that doesn't make it wrong or diminish the value of the content within the narrative. I felt and observed what it must've been like for the protagonist, and I was satisfied when it all concluded.

Alright, so after examining its strengths and shortcomings, how does it stack up to other free-to-play novels? Unfortunately, I have played and read far more stellar visual novels that just so happened to be free. That being said, although it fails to compare to some of the best of the free-to-play variety, and far more extensively, the better half of the genre in its entirety, this still holds up as a fine selection that I felt was undeservedly written off.",1535204073,1535204470,True,4,0,0.530464291572570801,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I regret to say that no, I found none.

What I found was a game filled with 18th century racial sterotyping, gender ideas which belong to the stone age, and dialog so badly written it was as if someone scraped 4Chan's /pol/ and dumped it onto the screen. The inconsistent artwork could be forgiven, the bad spelling excused, but when not once, but twice, the game had a character say ""Hitler did nothing wrong"" in a non-ironic manner, with noone calling them out on it, there was no excuse that could be made.

The characters are poor stereotypes, poorly written and even worse crudely shaped into images which would make people on Stormfront smile. From the black girl who dispariages that all members of her ethnic group are hoodlums or morons, to the Korean girl who is perfect in every manner, all of them need the brave white boy to save them from their ethnic trappings.

I not only do not recommend this game, it has become the second most despised game I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I would rather play Duke Nukem Forever with the theme song from Manos repeating the whole time than this pile of trash. It is not even a full game, only being act 1, and I pray for the sake of the world that Act 2 is stillborn.

To the developers, you should be ashamed of yourselves.

The dating options in this game are awful, the characters either bland and stereotypical (Taryn, Mikayla, etc.) or insanely unrealistic (Noro).

The script is poorly written, almost as though it was written by a child that is desperate to use a different set of words in absolutely every line. (Incidentally, the developer/writer was 16 when they made this). The backgrounds are fairly well drawn and the music often fits the scenes very well. However the art of this game is inconsistent and quite awful. This game makes a wonderful experience for a couple of friends to play as a joke, unfortunately it wasn't created as one. I cannot take it seriously for the life of me and I recommend you don't either. Matt, one of the few male characters you are able to interact with in this game is the essence of god awful comedy. His jokes are all so dated and lame that you'll wonder how they let it into the 'final' (unfinished) product. He appears to be comedic relief until he starts talking about existential crisis' on the roof with the MC (who by the way is VERY poorly written) (a shot to the shoulder should not nearly miss the clavicle, lungs, ribs AND spine).

I know everyone keeps banging on about this, but its plot points are essentially a rehash of Katawa Shoujo's, set in America, with an even more annoying next-door neighbor. The theme of feeling listless and directionless (like a piece of driftwood in the sea, the title actually fits quite well) is only occasionally brought up and abruptly dropped so Matt can throw around dated-at-publication slang (which has only gotten more and more cringeworthy as time has marched on). The main character is unrelatable and treats his initial love interest like garbage, and then the narration implies that she deserved it. The dialogue is terribly, terribly stilted and, once again, the writing is [i]totally[/i] unedited. It's as if they had never read over any line they had written even once once it was put in the script. The ""friendly and helpful"" [strike]discount Shizune[/strike] rich bitch comes off as manipulative and shallow. The explicitly-unlikeable Taryn is the only side character given much depth, and even then she's wildly inconsistent, coming off as very grounded and stable in some scenes, and incredibly unhinged in others [spoiler]such as when she starts talking about her firm belief in the existence of the Illuminati, I shit thee not. I thought she was pulling one over on Marcus at first, it was so out-of-the-blue and ridiculous.[/spoiler] Spending time with the characters engenders hatred, not warmth, in the reader. Character design isn't too awful, but the art is inconsistent (clearly drawn by different artists with nothing in the way of art direction) leading to confusion where one may not be entirely sure the girl in the CG is the same girl represented by a given sprite. There are dozens of minor nitpicks, such as two characters sharing the same first two letters and the same ""color"" for their name (Matt and Marcus) which can lead to confusion when you're speed-reading or skimming over the text, as you're likely to do, considering the story is rarely gripping. Marcus' jacket is a sickening color of banana yellow. Having a Mexican drug cartel be pulling off jobs in [b]Boston, Massachusetts[/b] is certainly a weird choice, and, honestly, between the jacket and the cartel, I was firmly convinced the author had set the story in the cocaine-fuelled 70s or 80s until someone pulled out a smart phone. Frankly, if it had been, it would have given the story more character. Bad characters are given too much spotlight, good characters aren't given enough. The novel is such a mess I can't even organize my thoughts on it.

And, again, it's a retread of [i]Katawa Shoujo's[/i] plot points and themes. Any particular instance where you can draw parallels between [i][/i] and [i]Katawa Shoujo[/i] might have been a coincidence, but when you put every single instance of them together, the odds of it all being a big cosmic joke drop to ""astronomically low."" Taryn's sprite is Emi minus the hair ties and plus legs (the scene where you meet her is almost the same set-up with Emi, only it becomes even more stereotypical), Yuuko fulfills Shizune's role, May is Misha, Matt is Kenji on a drug cocktail. . . need I go on? But still, even giving them the benefit of the doubt, they damned themselves by including an out-and-out reference to Katawa Shoujo. In a conversation with May and her friend, they point out that, while her pink hair is silly, it isn't ridiculous, or in any way ""spiral-y."" So, not only do you fairly brazenly take their concept and execute it pretty poorly, you also have to take the piss?

Now, I can tell the writers gave it a good college try. The sprite artists did their job pretty well, even if many of the poses seem unnatural and some (all) of the fashion choices of the guys make you want to claw your own eyes out. But, even with it coming out unpolished, unedited, unfinished, dead-in-the-water and dead-on-arrival, you can tell that the team, at one point, [i]cared[/i] about it.

But just because it's someone's baby doesn't mean it doesn't fail to accomplish what it set out to. Ultimately, you can't find any theme or deeper meaning in almost anything in this novel. It feels like the creative leads were toddlers sitting in a shopping cart, grabbing items off of the shelves, and the mother, here representing the rest of the crew, was unwilling to tell them no, that's too much, put some of it back. There's a whole lotta stuff in this novel, but nothing substantial. You could say, ""Hey, well at least the finished it!"" but the truth is that they haven't. It doesn't end, it just [i]stops[/i].

If I hate the game so much, why the hell am I recommending it?

Read it with friends. Set a side a few hours, have each friend choose a character (or three; the writers never learned that you need to trim your cast list or you end up with a very large, but very shallow, pool of characters) and pick the friend with the best voice to be the Narrator, crack open a bottle of something icy cold, and let the sweet memories make themselves as you watch a team of struggling ""visionaries,"" a few competent artists, and maybe one semi-competent writer do their absolute damnedest to dig the hole they've found themselves in ever deeper.

No idea why there are so many downvotes for this VN. I get that it ended abruptly, and is unfinished, but I for one really enjoyed reading it. Honestly, a negative review because it wasn't finished seems counterintuative. If it was poorly written, you'd think folks would be happy it ended. It's the fact we all wanted to read more and find out what happens that left us feelinga bit negative, but that's because it was a great visual novel, ergo should be upvoted to encourage the developers to finish and keep producing gems like Driftwood. Anyway, off soapbox, onto review. 

Moderately short (~5 hours of read time for me) visual novel about a young man who has to change schools for his senior year of highschool after an incident in his hometown. Not a kinetic novel, but there aren't a lot of choices if that's your thing. Focuses on his meeting and interacting with a number of memorable characters at his new school and the budding friendships (romances?) he develops. Very well written, butis clearly unfinished at this time, though it looks like there is hope for a second chapter.

Pros:
Artwork - Well drawn, cute characters. Really nice cut scenes and animated bits. Sprites were 
     obviously drawn by more than one artist, with different styles, but not a huge deal. 
     Background art was nicely done.
Cost - It was free, and a lot better than many VNs I've read that cost a lot more for a whole lot 
     less.
Story - It was easy to become attached to the characters, and care about what happens with 
     them. Descriptions of scenes and people was well done and really emeshed the reader in the 
     story.

Neutral:
Music - I usually don't play with the BGM going, but did in this case. Overall fit the story well.

Cons: 
Text - When the text appeared at the bottom of the page, it often was hard to read due to the pale backgrounds and the 
     text being in white..
Ending/unfinished - Really left me wanting more. These guys put out a quality product, if unfinished. I for one hope they 
     are able to finish it at some point. It would be a shame for this group to give up based on the number of negative 
     reviews.",1506836959,1506839482,True,2,0,0.50530397891998291,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'll admit what caught my attention and convinced me to play was Marcus' situation with getting shot in the shoulder, going to the hospital and having to transfer to a new school made me think of Katawa Shoujo, so I decided to give it a shot. Well, it was totally worth all the time I spent playing.
At his new school, Marcus meets plenty of interesting characters like Matt and May who greatly contribute to the game's humor, which honestly, is one of the reasons I liked the visual novel so much. Not only that but the game has an enjoyable atmosphere that most visual novels don't really have. Even in an incomplete stage, it manages to be one of my favorite visual novels. 
The graphics might not be as good as some of the other visual novels out there, but they still work and fit well and aren't unpleasant to look at. For music, not all of it stands out but there are more than a few really good tracks. Honestly though, I don't get how people don't like this; it's one of the better-written visual novels.

Didn't find much in the way of reviews of this VN on the Internet.  I didn't see anything that looked sexy, ecchi or raunchy, has mix of male and female characters.

Try it, if you like VNs.

1. inconsistent character art juuuuust enough. It isn't like Fullmetal Alchemist and Vampire Knight characters running around together on the same page, but it's just enough that anyone can really feel an almost uncanny-valley effect of it. And at times, it's actually staring me right in the face it's so inconsistent. 
2. Grammar issues of the 4th kind, though few and far between... such as not quite on every bottom-text panel... but enough to where you'll be able to see one or a few each time you boot up this game. 
3. Clearly others don't share this opinion with me, but I HATE the whole ""wall of text"" thing that this is and Katawa Shoujo did. However, this did it so flipping much. At some point, I just clicked through the big blue wall and didn't read any text because it was so frustrating. Walls of text in VNs are not fun. They take away from the character art, background art, and at times even drown out the music, just to put in a bunch of text that they really could have put in on the original bottom-text panels. No walls are ever necessary. I'm looking at you, Trump. (Cheap trump jokes are cheap, I know.) 

Pros: 
1. ... Uh. OH! Background art was gorgeous. 
2. Despite being inconsistent altogether, the character art itself was actually just fine. Didn't come across any weird incoherent pixel monsters or anything like that. It passes. (Emphasis on ""passes"".) 
3. Characters are fine, too. MC is clearly a guy that the other reviews here don't wanna cut any slack, but he was shot and forcefully moved from his home school to a new place. The fact he's timid and critical about his new location and the people he meets shows he's reserved since he just went through a pretty traumatic situation at the start of the game. The fact he isn't really a fan of his parents for moving him, is normal. Would you like it if your parents moved you from your city and all the friendships you built up? The hippie science teacher, Mr. Mallard, is fun and likeable. Nice guy. Yuko is also a very helpful female cohort to Marcus (MC).  Matt and Elric seem like stock characters wearing human skin though, but the game knows this and doesn't put them in a lot of situations (other than to be sidekicks) so I really just have blocked them out at this point. They're there for some side fun. 

So as you can see, I'm pretty conflicted about this game. It's got a few good things to it... and it's got quite a few bad things to it. But, I've been told to just round down when it comes to a situation like this. So, if I gather that my feelings on this game are ambivalent, as my list of pros and cons demonstrates, then it actually is just a bad game. 
Therefore, I don't reccomend this.

However, I eventually learned that this was backed on Kickstarter, so there's really no excuse.

By ""the amount of work"", I mean the few pros of the game: its length, decent amount of CGs and animated opening. They're still followed by cons, though: the sprites and a bunch of CGs look very different from each other, to the point you may not recognise some characters at first. Story-wise, they waste too much time describing meaningless things and the prologue is dispensable.

Now for the characters. Our protag, Marcus, is an ungrateful brat to his friends and family, and seems to instantly hate, look down on or be freaked out by everyone he meets. Some of the other characters are nice, but most are based on anime tropes and it's like the writers tried too hard to make them quirky.

We also have issues on the technical front. Borderless white text on semi-transparent blue text box often makes it hard to read. Despite changing the settings, the Skip button still skipped over everything, not only previously read text. No History button either. And last but not least, due to the lack of a CG gallery, achievements or an ending list, you're never really sure whether you've beaten the game or missed any endings.

As much as I'd like to support free VNs, I can’t recommend this one. Writing is nothing special, art is inconsistent, and technical issues kept me from playing through more than 2 routes.

Review 
ก่อนอื่นขอบรรยายความรู้สึกออกมาก่อน คือ  30 นาทีแรกที่เล่นอยู่ยังพอ OK นะ แต่หลังจากนั้นเป็นต้นไป กราฟมันดิ่งลงเหวสุดท้าย
ชนิดที่ต้องเรียกว่า ""สุดแสนแห่งความทรมานชิบหายวายวอด""กันเลย ตั้งแต่เล่นมาจนจบ รู้สึกไม่สนุก รู้สึกไม่อินไปกับมันเรื่องเลย

จุดเดียวที่เป็นข้อดีของเกมนี้เลยคือ 

-ดนตรี อันนี้ OK  อยู่ แต่ในขณะเดียวกันมันก็มีข้อเสียด้วย แต่ขอยกยอดไปรวมกับข้อเสียที่เราจะพูดต่อไปนี

ข้อเสีย 
อันนี้โคตรแห่งความหายนะครั้งใหญ่ ขอจี้เป็นจุดๆเลยล่ะกัน

-แกรมม่า  อันนี้โคตรอนาจมาก  มันจะมีบางประโยคที่ดูแล้วมันผิด และไม่ผิดแค่จุดเดียวด้วย เยอะมาก แต่นั้นยังไม่ใช่ปัญหาใหญ่มากที่สุด
-ดนตรี  อย่างที่บอก ดนตรีในเกมนี้คือ ข้อดีที่สุดแต่ก็มีข้อเสีย คือเพลง ในฉากนั้นไม่วนลูป คือ จบเพลงแล้วเงียบหายไปเฉยๆเลย ทำให้ฉากนั้นมันจืดชืดมาก
-รูปแบบของ Visual novel ในเกมจะมีบางช่วงมีแต่หน้าเปล่าแล้วเขียนด้วยบรรยายเรื่อง ซึ่งในเกมจะมีเยอะมาก มากจนเกินไป แล้วยิ่งเอาบทสนทนาของตัวละครไปใส่ด้วยแล้ว มันรู้สึกว่า กลายเป็น Visual novel ที่ไม่ลุงทุนอะไรเลย
-Story  อันนี้คือ จุดที่เลวร้ายที่สุดเลยก็ว่าได้ เหมือนตัวของ Visual novel จะบรรยายออกมาไม่ดีมาก พล็อตตอนแรกยังดีๆ อยู่ แต่หลังจากนั้นเป็นต้นมา เนื้อเรื่องไม่วนไปไหน ไร้จุดหมายอย่างสิ้นเชิง บทสนทนาของตัวละครแต่ละคนที่ดูไม่เป็นธรรมชาติเอาซะเลย แล้วช่วงหลัง ตัวละครบางตัว ก็ถามตอบๆ วนไปมา ซะจนนึกว่ามันคือ เกมเศรษฐี
และสุดท้าย คือ เกมนี้มันยังไม่จบ......


เล่นจบไปแล้ว รู้สึก โคตรเสียเวลาสุดๆ

Storyline 4 out of 5.
The story starts with Marcus Feick currently residing in Boston, Massachusetts. He kind of has the hots for this girl he has been friends with since childhood. After asking the girl of his dreams (Childhood Friend) out on a date, he finds himself caught in a catastrophic event that leaves him physically and emotionally wounded. Because of the incident, as well as complications with his newly formed relationship, his overprotective parents decide to transfer him to a boarding school south of Boston. The school is a hundred miles away on the island of Martha’s Vineyard. The feelings of broken promises, bitter memories, and being betrayed by his date, as well as the decisions made by his parents, lead him to move to live with his Uncle Xavier and start boarding school on Martha’s Vineyard. Marcus is introduced to a variety of cultures and personalities. The story and game focus primarily on five main female characters that can affect Marcus’s life positively or negatively based on the player’s choices. Each character is designed to teach Marcus a profound life lesson, helping him better understand the world and the complicated process of becoming an adult. 

Character development 3 out of 5.
I have only played Ellen’s Timeline so I can't relate to anything else. I feel like the characters have a very engaging storyline, and I feel like I'm really interacting with them. They feel alive, and I don't feel like I'm just reading a book. I get the feeling of who they are and where they are coming from. I also like that you keep talking to all of them. They all have an impact on the story, all the way through the game, even if you only date one.

Design 2 out of 5.
I have to say that I'm really disappointed with the design. It’s like they ran out of money and time. After 4 years of development, you would think that the art was good but no. Some of it is enjoyable, and the short video clip in the game is entertaining too. However, much of it is awful, as if it was cut from a white page instead of a real design. They likely started with too little money, like 8000 dollars, which is nothing! I think that is the lowest amount of cash I have seen a VNG ask for and it shows. 

Music and voice acting 3 out of 5.

This game has no voice acting which is not needed in a VNG. This can however be convenient if you're too lazy to read or simply don't want to read out loud. I have to say the music didn't bother me, in fact, it blended in the background and I didn't even think about it while playing. 

System 4 out of 5.
It's a pleasure to see all the characters interact with each other. All the text lines fit together perfectly, so you won't end up doing something you didn't intend. This is something I've seen in some VNG's that got fixed subsequently. 

Conclusion 3 out of 5.
Firstly, this game is free, so for a no-cost game, this is a lot more than most VNGs offer. I even paid money for games that were inferior. But you have to think about the fact that people spent 8000 dollars on this and it took them 4 years to develop. So, if you take all that into account, I have to say that this game doesn't get more than 2.5/5. I will still recommend this game since it's free and it has a compelling storyline.

Also, this game is NOT listed as early access, so I am reviewing it as a completed game. That said, I recognize that this is also only the first act (Although it also doesn't mention this in the description), so I wont comment on the abrupt end.

We'll start with music, as the music is quite good for the most part. The only problem I had was that there are several scenes without any background music or sound effects.

The Art is good as well, but there is clearly more than one artist, if I had to guess I'd say three, and they are not attempting to merge styles at all. The result is that there is a vast difference between characters art in CGs, sprites, and what I will call psuedo-CGs, each of them having their own very unique style. The opening animation looks great, but also has it's own even farther unique art style. Some character sprites look rushed as well, most notably the uncle. The game is in 4:3, which seems like a strange choice, but they were probably just following default RenPy. Many of the characters names share the same color, which can get slightly confusing.

Writing - The writing is decent in most places, great in some places, and strange or downright awful in some others. There are lots of filler sections too, such as the main character describing what kind of sandwich he got, then describing how it was rewarding but eventually bland. It's just a side thought that doesn't add to the story at all. Lots of the writing follows this trend, where you will have lots of main plot dialog, but in the middle of sections it'll just detour to some random irrelevant side thought. The idea is probably character development, but knowing that the main character ordered a turkey sandwich and only sort of enjoyed it doesn't develop his character at all.

And on to the story itself - The story is the main area this VN falls apart for me. When I read a VN, I try to put myself in their shoes, thus a good VN to me is one where I can relate to the main character and their experiences. The story starts out with the main character getting shot. This is a pretty clear parallel to Katawa Shoujo, which I assume is their main inspiration, where the main character is also hospitalized and had their old life and new girlfriend left behind in lieu of this new learning experience. The trouble for me is the scenario, which involved a 'Mexican Drug Cartel' (In Boston for some reason), robbing a bank, and pausing in their getaway to attempt to murder the main character. This seems very out of place to me. This is then followed by the 'overprotective' parents deciding to send their child a hundred miles away to live with his uncle, that no one had seen since the main character was a kid, and described in game as a drunk, lazy, unreliable has-been. That's not parents being overprotective, or even regularly protective, thats just parents finding an excuse to abandon their child with a relative. So already, the backstory is filled with very little that helps me relate to the main character or his problems. After this, your character moves to Martha's Vineyard and enrolls in the school. Up till this point I probably would have recommended this as a free one-off VN, but this is where it goes off the rails for me. At this point the main character meets Matt. Matt may be the most poorly scripted character I have ever read. He is clearly written solely to be the main comic relief, but he does so by communicating in nothing but bad teenage slang, no matter how out of place, inappropriate, combative, or completely racist it comes across, and the strangest part is that very few other characters even bat an eye at it. This is where I lost the story, after this point is was obviously writtin with very specific people in mind, and I am clearly not the target audience. The only character whose motivations I could understand was Taryn, naturally combative and accuses the main character of being a low-life despite obviously not being one, an attitude she probably picked up from the rest of the male characters being terrible people constantly. At a certain point I just skimmed through the rest.

I think my earlier point sums up my thoughts perfectly. In the end, this game is clearly written with a specific audience in mind, and not I, nor any of the people I know fit that group, and thus I can't recommend it.",1473059735,1473059864,False,5,1,0.569600403308868408,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Knowing that Steam differentiates between overall reviews and latest reviews, I think I will go with a ""no"", focusing on how the game looks in its current state.

What is available right now is the first act of the game, and it ends pretty abruptly - to the point where I actually assumed the game bugged out and moved me back to the intro. The fact that the ending animation had credits indicated it was all as planned at this point, but still, the story was just cut out of a sudden, which didn't fit an end of a whole act in my opinion.

The writing is... mediocre. I actually 'played' less than what Steam says, because a few times I just went away from my PC to do something quickly and didn't come back for a while, as I forgot the game was still running - with games that keep me interested all the time it's usually the other way around. There are a few typos and grammatical errors, which in my opinion is a very bad thing to have in a text-based game officially published anywhere.

I never considered the visuals to be important in the VN genre, but I have a few complaints here. The quality of graphics isn't very good, but that's OK, what bothered me is the inconsistency and some of the designs. The characters in sprites used through most of the game can look different from when drawn in a group scene, and from how they're portrayed in the cinematic - and you don't have to pay much attention to notice it. Some of the designs can also be a bit... weird. The default pose of the first female character introduced into the game was so unusual it was actually distracting.

The sound, which, in fact, is just the music, is pretty OK, simple, but sounds good most of the time. One or two pieces didn't seem like they were written to be a perfect loop, even though they were used as such.

One last thing is pretty technical - I couldn't seem to find a way to view the log or go back a scene. That means that if I accidentally pressed space, whatever I didn't read was gone for me forever - or until I decided to play the game again from my last save. I think that and the abrupt end of first act is what made me not recommend the game, even though it's free and you can't really lose anything but time trying it out.

About music and art.Music is pleasant and soothing, but nothing extraordinary, except for a few tracks.Great backgrounds, sprites are really nice for the most part.A lot of CGs, but they are of moderate quality.There is a terribly amateurish mistake about CGs though.Sometimes characters on CGs look different from their sprites.The only difference is hair color, you will never confuse characters because of this, and I think it isn't critical, but still, it's very amateurish.You can see an example of this mistake on screenshots 1 and 3.

You should also know that the game isn't finished, there is only act 1 for now.Still, completing all routes may take some time.15-25 hours, I guess.",1472189906,1472273184,True,7,1,0.562684297561645508,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The authors of Driftwood, however, are either blissfully unaware of this, or have a vastly overinflated opinion of their writing skills.

The writing in Driftwood is riddled with numerous grammatical errors, even down to such basic things as its/it's (and the possessive in general), then/than, your/you're, etc. In addition, spelling is frequently a problem, not to mention poor sentence structure and vocabulary--in some instances it's even obvious the author doesn't know the meaning of a particular word.

The character art is amateurish, wildly inconsistent between the sprites and various CGs, and rather poorly shaded; some of which you can see in the screenshots. Some of the characters also have utterly ridiculous poses. The background art is pretty decent though, and there's a good variety of it. Ditto for the music.

Combine all of the aforementioned flaws with an annoying protagonist who often gets ""offended"" at perceived ""insensitivities"" and wants to punch other characters to teach them a lesson, and you get a VN which breaks immersion so much that it's nearly impossible to enjoy. Oh, and it's not even finished.

However, I found that every time I think about going back, I felt this lump in the pit of my stomach, begging me to reconsider. Was it the fact that Driftwood is written in insipid, leaden prose? Filled with banal observations that are passed off for insights or emotional depth, while possessing neither? Or is it the fact that what starts off a romance VN is ""MC, teenage boy 17 years old, gets shot in Chicago gang violence because he witnessed a robbery and is left dying in his girlfriend's arms""? 

Part of the ""it's so bad it's good"" genre is acclimatising to the trauma you're being subjected to. The first time you watch The Room, Tommy Wiseau's seminal film about Tommy and a red Room, the first 15 minutes is hilarious. However, as the movie progresses, laughter is replaced by something more like morbid fascination. You start asking yourself just what it is you're watching, who it is, why it is. You peer beyond the obvious artificiality, to look at what the work says about the people who made it. 

When I peer behind Driftwood, I see very little. It's a pale Katawa Shoujo imitation, written by someone who felt a commitment to a kickstarter for what had only really been a hobby project between his friends. It's rather telling that the options menu background is a drawing of the dev group ca 2014. It's kind of like how someone scrawls their name over a custom map in an FPS, gauche as heck - but worse than that here, it's sad. The troubled development of this game has been no secret, and it seems the team split long before the release now in 2016. (If one can call it that, as this is just Act 1 of 2 - though nowhere is this advertised on the store page.) The CG seems to have been put in as some kind of memento by the main creator, or perhaps a lazy leftover.

That's what makes Driftwood such a deeply uninspiring game to play, and gives me that lump in my gut. Once the laughter subsides, and you dig deeper, there's not a whole lot there other than the broken ambitions of an unambitious VN.

1) [u]Сюжет[/u]: главный герой, школьник по имени Маркус, наконец таки смог вытащить на свидание девушку своей мечты, вот только короткое свидание оказалось омраченным случившейся неподалеку бандитской разборкой, и парочкой пуль уложивших нашего героя в больничку. И вот родители Маркуса решили отправить свое чадо от греха подальше в далекую частную школу на островах, где нашего героя ждут новые встречи и знакомства. Игра сделана в жанре бисёдзё - то бишь симулятора свиданий. Но свиданиями дружеское общение ([i]в прямом смысле[/i]) нашего героя, назвать можно с натяжкой. Плюс сюжета в том, что выборы в развилках влияют на довольно большие куски текста. Минусы: история прописана имхо довольно скучно и слишком ""сахарно"", все друг с другом дружат, никаких интриг нет, и весь сюжет идет слишком ровно, ну а начальный эпизод с перестрелкой вообще выбивается из основной истории. К тому же в сюжете делается сильный упор на тему толерантности, к примеру если пойти по развилке с чернокожей девушкой Норой, большая часть диалогов будет сводиться к ""расовому вопросу"" и об отношениях людей с разным цветом кожи друг к другу. Сама тема конечно правильная, но подана она опять же имхо, не очень удачно.

2) [u]Геймплей[/u]: все стандартно для визуальной новеллы - читаем тексты, делаем выборы. Из минусов - галерея открыта изначальна почти вся (хотя может это у меня такой глюк), при этом некоторые сцены не открываются в принципе. Есть раздел с реплеями - но при заходе в него, нас встречает надпись о том что ""раздел в разработке"", в совокупности возникает ощущения некоторой недоделанности.

3) [u]Графика и звуки[/u]: картинка в игре несколько угловатая и выглядит так как будто художник искрене пытался нарисовать анимэ, но получилось нечто полуанимэшное-полумультяшное. Задники разные - часть приличные, но местами тоже выглядят странно. Что плюс есть две видеовставки (те что в трейлере на этой страничке). Музыка приятная, но имхо на картинку и текст в некоторых местах ложится плохо.

[u]Как итог[/u]: видно что разрабы старались, но получившийся результат выглядит слишком любительским и неряшливым. Возможно когда выйдут следующие акты игра станет выглядеть лучше, но сейчас рекомендовать не стану.

This project was kickstarted for 8000 dollars and took 4 years to make, so you'd think the time was well spent refining and figuring out the details. But while reading you'll find that the sprites are all over the place, there is no coherent art style, no shared quality level, and  the colours and designs are so mixed that you would almost think each cg had new characters. It's very apparent that there was no co-operation between artists, and probably no group discussions on designs.
The only pros in this vn is to some extent the music and some decent sprites and CGs, but when they are mixed in with a plethora of other stylizations it just bogs them down and make them a stark contast to the other lower quality assets. 
The backgrounds look mostly fine, they have some problems with sizes and construction for the cities, but otherwise most of them look rather good.
All in all i am confused, did you really think this looked acceptable when you shipped it out, or did you perhaps decide to give up be done with part 1 so you could go onto that other new and fresh kickstarter project of yours.
tl:dr. If you judge this as a kickstarted and therefore paid project it is mostly bad and i won't recommend it.",1470796001,1470796001,False,71,4,0.828610897064208984,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I'd say it's worth a try if you like reading or you're a degenerate who likes anime grills.
