For all intents and purposes, this *should* have been the game that saved Humongous Entertainment. Yes, you heard me right, the same people who made all those point-and-clicks we adored as kids like Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam made this game. By the time this game started development, Humongous was in *very* deep trouble. Interest in their once monster franchises was waning, their staff was cut in half, things were looking financially grim, and in a last ditch effort they decided to try something completely different.

That little project became known as a turn based strategy game called Moonbase Commander. It wasn't aimed at young children though. Led by the mastermind Rhett Mathis who had spearheaded some of the earlier arcade style spinoff games from the company, MBC is a simple to learn, hard to master strategy game that has more to it than meets the eye. The premise is seemingly simple -- you start with one single building as your base, and construct additional buildings that all tie to the building it was launched from. Your goal is to destroy your enemy base, which is done as soon as you destroy their starting building. However, once you've built enough to reach their base, you and they both will likely have built up more than enough defenses to keep that from being an easy task.

You have multiple items at your disposal to aid in the destruction of the enemy base that all have specific situational uses. For instance, a bomb is the most basic weapon you have, which does the most damage but only hits one building. A cluster is great for disabling multiple anti-air units but does little in the way of actual damage. A spike will attack both the building it lands on and all buildings attached to it, or the buildings on each end of the wire if it lands on that. Of course, you have ways of defending yourself too, particularly with anti-air modules and shields.

This is an incredibly quick game to learn, especially compared to the average strategy game. The concept is extremely unique and there are very few similar games to it. This gameplay is complemented by lush visuals and a lot of personality in each faction's design and narration. And because each faction is only cosmetically different, there is no issue with game balancing. The cost of each module or weapon also reflects its usefulness flawlessly, and while stalemates can and will happen given the right conditions, in general it always feels like there is a way forward. And if you aren't satisfied with the maps the game comes with, it also includes a map editor. Furthermore, you can also enjoy the game with up to three other folks, either free for all or in teams, and over a LAN which means given the right software you can rig up some online capabilities.

Really, my biggest complaints are that the game does look and feel a bit dated for the time of its release (this came out in 2002, at a time when 3D games were still all the rage and 2D had yet to make its big comeback), and that the simplicity can mean that you may tire of the game quicker than a lot of other strategy games. That said, this is a criminally overlooked game overall, and it's a massive bummer that Infogrames refused to give this game the proper spotlight it deserved. Unfortunately, its mismanaged marketing put the writing on the wall for Humongous and it was pretty much their one final hurrah, even though they did continue to make games for three more years before shutting down. That's a dang shame, because it deserved to have the exact opposite effect and I can only dream of what may have happened had it succeeded.",1626064719,1626064719,True,18,0,0.711148619651794434,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a surprising oldie that aged well.  If you don't mind the dated graphic appearance ( a more ""modern"" look wouldn't add anything to it anyways) and the simple controls, you will probably enjoy this game for what it is: basic strategy with some interesting depth.  You simply need to occupy a celestial body (looks like a moon or an asteroid) and control it, fighting against one or various competitors using exactly the same tools that you do. You are basically distinguished by the colour of your bases and the shape of your items, otherwise everything is exactly the same.  You start with a location and you must expand quickly in order to grab some limited resources and/or deny them to the competition.  Of course, you win when the competition has been eliminated... Each game can be quite short depending on your playing speed and your settings, going from 20 minutes to an hour.  Could be longer with multiple opponents.  

This game requires minimal resources, works without a glitch, requires you to think each move, and has decent controls.  From my experience, it works well in Windows 7 and Windows 10, could be played on a toaster, and will not dent your wallet as it can be found for sale from time to time.

Moonbase Commander is a fun but sadly forgotten novelty title with a well-deserved cult following. While this title still stands up even today, it would really benefit from some TLC. I have a feeling that a community would easily reignite for this game if a patch was released to reinstate proper online play and add some modern operating system support.

Nightdive, I’m looking at you guys again. Maybe in the next go-around, consider giving Moonbase Commander some love, like you did with the excellent updates to System Shock and Nocrtropolis.

A mobile version of Moonbase Commander would be a stroke of genius.

MBC is a breath of fresh air where no reading and little memorizing is required. In one match you would know all the basics without a tutorial. In addition, MBC's has a unique skill-shot weapon/unit placement system and a chain-reaction  killing mechanic which usually makes the game go a lot faster paced than most annoyingly slow turn-based strategy games. 

Even the games 14 minute long ost is pretty damn catchy and won't get too annoying because its divided into about 118 different sections that are played according to whats going on in the game.

NOTE FOR LINUX USERS:

The game can be run with Steam Play / Proton under Linux with a little hacking.

If the game is asking for the CD, find hegames.ini in the Windows directory of wine. For me that was ""~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/254880/pfx/drive_c/windows/hegames.ini"". Add the following lines under the [moonbase] section:

ShowLicenseAgain=0
SetupHasBeenRun=1
GameResourcePath=.\
HE3File=.\Moonbase.he3

After this the game starts. For me, the next problem was the mouse pointer being wrongly detected. So I ran:

WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/254880/pfx winecfg

If it hangs while updating your wine prefix, just kill it and run it again. Then check the option to emulate a virtual desktop under the graphics tab.

It's far from perfect, but way better than infecting your machine with Microsoft IMHO ;)",1537999029,1538003764,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's an old game, but a good one none the less.
Shooting buildings without letting power lines cross is a simple concept, but has infinite depth. It forces you to consider your actions ahead of time and plan wisely, and then when you inevitably miss a high priority shot, you must adapt. 
The choice of structures and weapons make the game interesting, but high stakes as the prices can be quite high.
Overall, this game hit the jackpot between skill and strategy, interweaving them so much, they're almost indistinguishable.
I may not have extensive play time, but i know a good game when i see one.

It's got great music, it's graphically pleasing, and most importantly, it's fun to play. It's got that ""easy to learn but tough to master"" thing going for it, since with the golf-like controls and obstacles like water, wind and elevation, even an experienced player like myself can mess up sometimes. This can be an issue even against NPCs, as the campaign gets hard as nails towards the end. The AI isn't perfect, but it mostly competent, and can definitely provide a challenge if you choose the tougher bots.

Of course, it's also super fun to play with friends, though you'll need to set it up through Hamachi or something if you don't have someone to sit next to. There are some third party tools out there too, like Moonbase Console.

The map editor is pretty great as well, and you can play maps you make against AI or humans.

One thing to note: the game's resolution is pretty small and it will want to be in fullscreen, but if you prefer, you can set it to windowed mode by pressing Shift+F5. No borderless option, but maybe that's possible with some third party app. Alt+Tab does not play well with this game, so change to windowed mode before doing so.

Впервые запустив, конечно, я ужаснулся примитивной графике, отсутствию нормального сюжета, странным уровням и убогому управлению прямиком из игр девяностых. Настолько ужаснулся, что тут же добавил ей в категории ""Отстой"" в своём списке игр. Но, слава Богу, я продолжил в неё играть. Все её недостатки меркнут по сравнению с увлекательным игровым процессом, который, несмотря на ночь, работу или супружеский долг, заставляет тебя сделать ещё один ""последний"" ход.

Механика процесса очень проста и сравнима с серией Worms. Взяли оружие (или в нашем случае в том числе сооружения и юниты), прицелились, нажали на кнопку и выстрелили с набранной силой в надежде попасть туда, куда нужно.

Originally realeased in 2002, this game shows its age.  Nevertheless, its simple rules and complex gameplay are genius.
First, the only game mode I have spent any significant time in is singleplayer skirmish.  I do not know if Multiplayer works yet, but if I try it, I will update this review to include it.  Skirmish seems like the only gamemode that really shines; challenge mode is generally irrelevant / uninteresting, in my opinion.

Pros / things I personally like:
[list]
[*]It is easy to understand quickly.
[*][b]It has a phenominally crafted strategy framework, allowing a different scenario every game.[/b]
[*]It is very inexpensive.
[/list]

Cons / things I personally dislike:
[list]
[*]It is incompatible with the Steam overlay.
[*]You cannot control how large the game shows up on your screen.
[*]On some computers, if you try to switch from the game to another window and then witch back to the game (using alt+tab), the graphics fail.
[*]You might experience some technical hiccup along the way, like the one I described above, due to the game's age.

This game is incredible. It's definately my favorite strategy game of all time. 

I own a physical copy of this game, played it when I was six years old! I sucked at it back then but today, I beat Brutakas! 

The enemy AI is stunningly inteligent, sometimes while playing I'll feel like I'm playing one of those computer chess games where the computer just does not mess around. 

The challenge mode missions are fun and, as the name implies, challenging.  

LAN multiplayer is a blast! If you're playing with a few friends who are as equally skilled at the game as you, then it can be a blast! Just make sure you don't play against a person whose new to the game, you'll crush them easilly. Moonbase Commander is highly skill based game, I'd go as far and say that it's probably the most solid skill based game out there. 

There is only one complaint I have with the game, which is that there is a balancing issue when it comes to underwater crawlers. Those who have played this game probably know what I'm talking about. If a crawler is launched into water, then it becomes the most overpowered weapon in the game, because the only way to neutralize it is to hit it with another crawler, when both crawlers hit each other, they detonate. This means that if a crawler is underwater right next to the shoreline, and you have buildings next to the shoreline, there is no way to stop the crawler from detonating and destroying your buildings. And if you think that's bad, it gets worse, because despite not being able to get hit by anything aside from other crawlers, missles will STILL lock on to the little things, and they won't do any damage to them. Underwater crawlers are easilly my least favorite thing about this game, and the more devious computers love spamming them.  Normally, crawlers aren't that ridiculous, because when they're on ground you can hit them with any type of weapon, and hitting them with a reclaimer defeats them without having them detonate. But put a crawler underwater, and it becomes very annoying. Honestly, a good way to balance it is if they would have allowed reclaimers to hit them while they're underwater. 

So yeah. That is seriously the games only flaw. And guess what! If you don't play on levels that have a ton of water, then underwater crawlers won't even be an issue! 

But, let's not leave things off on a bad note. I'm now going to discuss some of the even cooler things about this game!

This game features a map editor where you can make your own planets! And then you can play on them with your friends! And the map editor gives you a surprisingly large amount of freedoms, you can set spawn points, you can set multiple spawn points for different types of game types (such as if it's a team battle, a four on four battle, or a two on two battle). The map editor makes the possibilities of this game considerably greater, and I love it to death!

This game also features some interesting ways to change the game. In skirmish mode you can play with teams, set a WIND setting that changes the game feel considerably, and allows you to turn off fog of war. These options allow you to adjust the game to your preferences, in order to create the most fun experience possible.

Finally... presentation. This game is gorgeous for a 2002 PC game. The theming of this game is awesome! Each of the four factions has their own narrator, and layout. In skirmish mode you can change the color of the team, and your faction, which also changes the color and style of your in game menu. 

The four factions are as follows, (I'll give you my vague understanding of what they're supposed to be): 

NiceCo: Russian utopians who are hungry for control. ""They will fall to our superior gameplay."" 
Dewulf: Industrialists who sound like agents from The Matrix. ""We're gonna own this planet.""
System 7: Evil robots who are obsessed with triangles for some reason. ""Our Galactic domination will continue.""
Team Alpha: Military guys, the good guys, on a quest to save the galaxy. ""Nice shot shirley! Keep em coming!"" 

My prefered fraction is Dewulf. But everyone else I know loves Team Alpha the most because they don't give you a hard time when you miss a shot. 

Also it should be a mention that this game has a AWESOME soundtrack. 

Final thoughts? GET THIS GAME. This game is awesome! And this downloadable version is just like the physical copy version! Except this one actually works on my new laptop, which has Windows 10. 

I give this game a perfect 10/10. One of my favorite games of all time. I honestly should have bought it twice during the winter sale and gifted it to one of my good friends .",1452661306,1452662346,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ユニット射出領地拡大ターン制ストラテジーゲー
Shift+F5でウィンドウモードにできます。


〈基本内容〉
舞台は月面で、ゲーム開始時はHubと呼ばれるユニット1つ。
Hubから投石機のように他のユニットを射出、設置していき、領地を拡大。
射出はマウスでクリックしている間に強さを決めて行く方式。
射出されたユニットは全てHubとコードと呼ばれる供給線で繋がれている。
基本的な流れは、Hubの守りを固める→Hubを新たに設置→守りを固める
そして、相手のHubを破壊することで勝利。

エナジーと呼ばれるターンごとに使用できる資源があり、
ユニットによって、使用するエナジーは1、3、7と分けられる。
ユニットは相手の攻撃を防ぐものや、相手を無力化する武器、
資源を集めるものなど18種類あり

〈モード説明〉
ゲームモードはシングルチャレンジ、シングルスカーミッシュ、マルチプレイの3種類。
チャレンジは勝利条件が課せられるちょっとしたストーリーが付いているモード。
スカーミッシュは相手の数や地形、風や霧の有無を自由に決めてやるモード。
マルチは現在LANモードしか無いが、
外部からソフトでポート開放やHamachiによってIPプレイ可能。
「Zauron's Lair MoonbaseIP」で検索

〈感想〉
2002年製と古臭さはあるものの、個人的には好きなジャンル
ユニット数が18種類と比較的少なく一度覚えれば、簡単に出来るのが良い
ストラテジーとして少し特殊な部類であるけれど、
1つのユニットの役目は一つだけなので、やりやすいといえばやりやすい。
ユニットの設置や攻撃方法が投石方式で、
どれぐらいの力なら思い通りの場所に行くか考えていくのが面白く、
狙った場所に綺麗に当たった時は興奮もの。
どれだけ守りを固めていても突破できるように作られており、
ちょっとした油断で逆転されてしまうという所もよく出来てる。
マルチには一手間要りそうなのが残念",1448979058,1501836358,True,7,0,0.636220812797546387,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First is to try kill the enemy main base ASAP on turn 4/6 and get +7 enegy and go for the next enemy or expand your economy and then kill the rest. 

Second is to be good at aiming and hit the energy pool on first turn and after that you can go for the next energy pool or try fighting.

As you can see from the store page print-screens, MoonBase Commander is much closer to board games than to something fast-paced like BroodWar. You starting with one pod, which is your base, and you building a network of connected pods, all looks pretty much the same. The only resource is the energy, which consumes on every action and restores if you settling on the acid spots.

Though since the game was put on steam it would of been nice if they added window mode or resolution options or make it so the steam overlay worked ingame so thats disappointing. However the game works on new computers and I haven't ran into any color issues that seem to be present in old games on newer systems.

Gameplay:
Players take turns launching units, structures or projectiles around the map. Players must secure resources around the map to gain more energy, the more energy you have the more things you can do per turn. The challenge comes from base planning and launching, every building palced is connected to the hub (the building that creates the other buildings) they are connected by a line, and no line can overlap each other so you must place your buildings carefully.

The hub can only launch the structure so far, when you press the ""launch"" button you have a charge meter to see how far it goes.

There is plenty of strategy and planning involved, the game has single player and multiplayer, single player offers skrimish mode and challenge mode. Skrimish is multiplayer but with AI. Challenge mode is bunch of scenerios with different objectives to complete. It's a nice way to learn the game and experiment with all the stuff.

Graphics and Audio

The game is old and only supports low resolution but the sprites look really good, everything is pretty easy to identify and there are 4 teams each with different looks of the units so it has a nice mix up of the same units.

The music is catchy and fits the game, totally kickass and really enjoyable, the sound effects are great and the voices that speak to you help create character for the teams and fit really well together.

Options

As expected from an old game there isn't many options specially video options however it does contain the hotkeys and audio options including the ability to turn off the commentary if you so desire.

Overall

The game is great and functions as intended, works on new systems but lacks features for a steam game, it's a small game and a low price, makes for an excellent game to play with friends.

Shame, since Moonbase Commander is one of the most original and most entertaining games lately! It might not have stunning graphics and sound, but if it’s fun that matters then this is one great game!

So, what’s the story of this game? It’s quite simple – four companies are fighting for domination of the Moon. That’s all! There are no more details of the story, you will not be briefed about the current situation on the field, nothing! As the single player “campaign” starts, you will play as Niceco Company, then move on to Dewolf, then to System 7 and finally complete the game as Alpha team. Each company offers 4 missions and if you play for about 2 hours per day you should be done in less than 4 days. And I was just beginning to completely enjoy my superior strategy…

The game plays as follows: you construct various structures such as air defense missiles, energy collectors and radar towers as well as fire missiles, bombs or crawlers. Each component can be constructed only in the hub. Hubs are the cores of each “base”. When you want to build a component, you need to select it, pay the price for construction, then aim and fire the component in the wanted direction. New component will be connected to the hub and will be destroyed if hub is destroyed. Hubs can also construct other hubs, but note if the main hub is destroyed so are all others and you have lost. Each component has its price of 1, 3 or 7 energy points. When you start the game you will be getting 7 energy points per turn, but finding energy sources and placing energy collectors gives you extra 3 energy points. Your goal is simple – destroy enemy main hub(s) or place an energy collector on a specific energy source and hold it for a set number of turns (you will be told about your goal).

There is total of 18 components and weapons that can be “fired”. Aside from previously mentioned hubs and energy collectors, you can also build air defense (protects you from various air attacks), towers (provide larger viewable area when fog of war is turned on), shield (protects an area from everything) and so on. On the other hand, guided missiles are great if you are not aiming well, EMP disables shields, hubs and other structures, bombs are dumb and you need to aim well and finally, crawlers are ultimate weapon of destruction… but the move real slow. There are other weapons and components but you need to find something on your own!

Once you complete the single player campaign, you can still play skirmishes versus up to three opponents or in team with a computer against other computers. There is a multiplayer game option but you can only play it online via GameSpy.

The graphics and sound are much below today’s standard but such game doesn't need them anyway. Although the game can only be played in 640x480, everything looks real sharp and nice. Sounds are limited to the usual set of beeping, booming, crashing and whistling, with a voice commentary from your superior’s computers.

Overall, the game is quite fun but it doesn't last long enough. After I was done with the campaign, I lost interest, as I never enjoy playing skirmishes (they just seem pointless to me).",1405409692,1405409692,True,3,0,0.51689070463180542,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a fun little game with an interesting feature: You fight with your buildings, not soldiers.

You become more powerful by expanding your base, setting Energy Collectors to boost the amount of energy you have to spend each turn, which allows you to perform more actions, such as launching more buildings and attacks.

The base is expanded by launching structures from a ""Hub"", which is the primary building for attacking and expanding the base. The hub can launch other hubs for further expansion, or set defensive buildings like forcefield generators and anti-air missile bases. And, of course, they can launch energy collectors for collecting energy. The Hub can also launch attacks against other buildings by launching a variety of ranged attacks, such as regular bombs, scatterbombs, missiles, and even a virus! The Hub can also launch a special ""offensive"" building which can only launch attacks, but at a far greater distance than the regular Hub.

This game also has a unique feature where all the bases are connected to each other by Power Cords. The power cord shows not only which bases are connected, but which hubs are supplying them power (aka which hubs they were launched from). If you destroy a hub that is supplying power to other buildings, those other buildings are also destroyed.

This may be the best strategy game that nobody played, and it just begs for a modern port for touchscreen devices. It's just an awesome strategy game with simple controls, and a depth that really grows on you over time. Yeah, the graphics are nothing special, they looked 10 years old when the game launched 10 years ago. The multi-player is LAN only. The voiceover accents are cheesy. It doesn't matter.

You play by launching one of 18 nodes onto the battlefield, scorched eath style. Every node costs energy, and is connected  to the node that launched it by a chain. If a node is destroyed, the nodes launched from it are destroyed in a chain reaction. There's the skill of placement, the tactics of deciding what to launch, and the strategy of resource management and the fog of war. There's never been another game quite like it, before or after.

The game lacks  support and online play and I can only hope that one day it will be patched in by the community.
