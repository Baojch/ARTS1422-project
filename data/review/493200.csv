- With all the crumbling ruins, magical animals, and puzzle elements strewn about, Rime manages to capture the look of Wii-era Zelda title (but with much smoother edges and twice the frames)
- I was also weirdly impressed by the skybox. That sounds weird to say, but it felt really nice to crawl out of the dank underground dungeon you've been puzzling your way through for 45 minutes and emerge into a lush meadow crowned with an expansive sea of blue or a rocky coast below a twilight sky beset with twinkling stars. Just a nice touch that helps the surprisingly small overworked feel bigger and realer than it should
- It feels like every game with wordless storytelling has a soundtrack full of keys and strings with a woodwind or percussion instrument occasionally dropping by to see what's going on. That isn't to say Rime's soundtrack isn't good (it's quite nice and features some beautiful vocal work), but you can look at the cover art and basically guess what it sounds like

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- The entire game is a metaphorical journey through grief from the perspective of a young boy who's been shipwrecked on an island. Given the fact that there's only snippets of story and essentially no voice acting, you'd be excused for expecting environmental story telling. But there's not any. Rime is just one of those games with a two-sentence plot and a lot of puzzles
- That lack of exposition lends a mysterious air to the game that only lifts when you find a hidden keyhole, view a post-dungeon cutscene, or finish the game to see the ending sequence
- Speaking of the ending, be sure to get keep an eye out for collectibles as finding them all will net you a much better ending
- The narrative did kinda bother me. Not because it's low quality, but because it feels so disconnected from the gameplay

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- The world of Rime is a dense tangle of puzzles crammed into a 1-acre island. I enjoyed how very little space felt truly wasted. Every fork in the path and climbable surface feels like it leads to a new puzzle or collectible
- About a quarter of the way into the game, you'll reach the main puzzle hub: the giant tower that looms over the island and features prominently on the box art. I loved how the staircase progressively expanded to reveal new areas. It was gratifying to reach the end of the game an look down into the pool at the bottom. Little visual representations of progression like that always feel nice
- Controls are very straightforward; there's no combat, so don't go into the game expecting much beyond running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and the usual box pushing and relic carrying you'd expect from a puzzle game. You also have a button that makes you shout, but that's just how you activate magic items when you encounter them
- One gripe I have to raise involves the camera. It works fine most of the time, but it has a bad habit of zooming in far to closely in cramped spaces. It's hard to jump from one narrow stone column to another when half of the screen is covered by your character's model

[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]
- It took me a while to get to this review, and that was mostly because I was having a hard time deciding how much I liked the game. Every time I thought about bumping up the score, I kept remembering the weird disconnect between gameplay and narrative. It makes the story feel a little extraneous; the plot framing could be entirely replaced and the game would barely need to change. It's so strange that a game with such great art direction should feel so discordant and out of proportion with one another. If Rime's gameplay were a great white shark, the narrative would be a little remora nibbling bits of food from its teeth
- Rime ran very well on the Steam Deck, but I wound up wishing I had just hooked my laptop up to my TV to appreciate the art a little more

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]7/10[/b]. I'd still recommend Rime to anyone who loves a good Zelda-like puzzle title, but not very enthusiastically. Don't get me wrong--it has plenty of virtues. The price feels fair for the content (unlike The Pathless, a similar title). But the story reveal at the end made me wonder why I had bothered solving puzzles for 8 hours. It's a bit long-winded for a metaphor",1708180959,1708180959,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

 Ele é LINDO, completamente belo, deslumbrante, enche os olhos e a história é interessante.
[h2]Contras[/h2] 
  Tudo nesse jogo vai ficando repetitivo com o tempo, praticamente TODOS os puzzles e parkours vão se repetindo do começo para o final e isso é muito ruim por que você acaba querendo rushar o jogo.
[h2]O jogo vale 55 reais?[/h2] 
Não. Apesar de ser lindo, a variedade de puzzles e parkour vão deixando o jogo tão repetitivo que você fica: ""Isso não vai acabar nunca?"". O final quando você descobre tudo é até legal, mas até lá o jogo enche um pouco o saco e ele não instiga a curiosidade de saber mais, ele foca muito em puzzle e não seria um problema se eles não ficassem se repetindo. Espere uma promoção.
[h2]Minha recomendação pra quem quer jogar[/h2]
 Você tem que jogar com a mentalidade de ""quero saber o que aconteceu nessa ilha e como vim parar aqui"" se não você irá dropar. Recomendo explorar, vá em cantos nos quais o jogo não te manda ir, explore o mapa e se concentre em querer saber a história, os puzzles vão ser só um plus no jogo, não se concentre neles por que eles não tem nada demais.
[h2]Conclusão[/h2]
É deslumbrante, uma obra de arte belíssima, mas a jogabilidade se tornar repetitiva foi um tiro no pé, tem altas chances de você parar de jogar por causa disso, por isso eu digo: EXPLORE!! Não rushe o jogo se quiser ter uma experiência melhor. O ritmo dele é lento, então tem que ter paciência. É um jogo legal.

Observações:

1. Uma experiência emocional;
2. Trilha sonora lindíssima;
3. Jogo curto, que pode se tornar desafiador ao buscar a Platina;
4. Se você é fã de ICO, este é um título imperdível.

[b]RiME[/b] é um jogo de plataforma e quebra-cabeças, daqueles que te fazem parar para apreciar os créditos finais ao refletir toda a findada jornada e revisitando-a com o mesmo frescor que à primeira vez. Este é um daqueles títulos que transcendem o conceito de jogo e se tornam arte, uma experiência. Emotivo, desafiador e contemplativo.

Apesar deste maravilhoso produto ter sido desenvolvido pela [i]Tequilla Works[/i], preciso falar de [b]Fumito Ueda[/b].


[h2]Conexão Madrid - Japão[/h2]

Apesar de ser nítido que [i]RiME[/i] nos remete a um conto infantil (daqueles que facilmente seriam transpostos em livro ilustrado) e que de acordo com a própria produção do jogo, a inspiração veio de clássicos como [b]O Pequeno Príncipe[/b] e [b]A História Sem Fim[/b] (que estão postos, firmes e soberanos, em minha estante), não há dúvidas que o jogo bebeu da fonte de um gênio da indústria, talvez não tão badalado quanto outros, mas que possui grande relevância: [h3]Fumito Ueda[/h3]


Com ele, tivemos o privilégio de jogar 3 clássicos instantâneos: [i]ICO[/i], [i]Shadow of the Colossus[/i] e [i]The Last Guardian[/i]. Com ele, pudemos perceber que jogos podem ser mais do que apenas seus pilares de [i]Design[/i], alçados no mesmo patamar que outras formas de arte. Não falo de aspectos técnicos, mas de [b]forma de expressão[/b].

Por sua influência [b]Hidetaka Miyazaki[/b], outro Titã da indústria de jogos (como [i]Dark Souls[/i], [i]Bloodborne[/i] e [i]Elder Ring[/i]), decidiu enveredar por este mágico caminho. O gatilho? [b]ICO[/b]. Como curiosidade, tanto RiME quanto sua referência possuem como inspiração o mesmo artista (O pintor surrealista, fundador do movimento de arte metafísica, [b]Giorgio de Chirico[/b].

Não há qualquer possibilidade de jogar [i]RiME[/i] e não se lembrar dos moinhos de vento de [i]ICO[/i] (sendo esta uma relação superficial e apenas um exemplo sobre uma fonte de inspiração marcada pela fuga dos elementos que compõe um jogo).

[h2]O Design de Subtração[/h2]

O minimalismo, a ausência de diálogos, de [i]NPCs[/i], de mapa, de percentuais estatísticos, [i]HP[/i], [i]Level[/i], [i]Stamina[/i] ou de quaisquer elementos de jogos exibidos na tela nos levam à uma imediata imersão, suspendendo qualquer descrença e abraçando o mundo tal qual nos é apresentado. Apesar disso, [i]RiME[/i] se comunica de forma mágica com o jogador, seja pela maravilhosa trilha sonora, pelos visuais estilizado e de cores brilhantes (que me remeteram à [i]The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker[/i]), além das interações que ocorrem no decorrer da Jornada.

Interações estas, de uma realidade dolorosa, transformadas em fantasia - a fim de vencer uma etapa importante da existência: [spoiler]a morte[/spoiler]. [i](Spoiler)[/i].

[h2]A Cíclica Jornada do Ser Humano[/h2]

Serão 5 estágios a serem enfrentados (relacionados ao tema central do jogo), aos quais a partir de linguagem visual e musical você conseguirá relacionar uma linha narrativa. No decorrer da jogatina, você eventualmente poderá refletir sobre determinados elementos e situações que poderão ser significados como representações de cada um destes ""estágios"" (não quero especificar para não cometer [i]spoiler[/i]), passando por belíssimas paisagens, monumentos de engenharia surrealista que me remeteram às grandiosas civilizações que povoaram as Américas Central e do Sul (Incas, Maias e Aztecas), além de [i]puzzles[/i] construídos na medida certa, em um [i]Level Design[/i] muito bem realizado. Dificilmente você se perderá, pois além de exibir de forma muito sutil os locais de interação física, os elementos visuais presentes e o jogo de luz/sombra o guiarão (e o surpreenderão, em um jogo com muitas descobertas!).

[b]Resumindo[/b]: jogue ! É uma experiência plenamente satisfatória, com tempo de jogo razoável se você quiser platinar. Se apenas seguir a história, não terás dificuldade e avançarás com rapidez. Porém, recomendo que deguste toda a experiência, que te trará um final triste, emocionante e reflexivo.

Collecting each collectable isn’t necessary but highly recommended, so give a good time to yourself and invest time to map around you.

At first I expected to mostly play in the starting island with beautiful weather all the time. Kind of like a vacation experience. But the setting changed with every chapter (5 total). I was also initially unimpressed with the gameplay being mostly exploring, solving simple puzzles, climbing a la Tomb Raider/Uncharted and trying to understand the story without voice acting or a single text. It slowly won me over to the point of getting hooked and crying with the ending after completing the game a second time. 

Positives:
-Gorgeous graphics and moving soundtrack
-Relaxing gameplay where time moves quickly without noticing 
-Some of the puzzles are well thought out later in the game. What’s more, it strikes a fine balance of keeping interest while not being complicated for the most part
-Almost all the collectibles are meaningful additions to the story, they’re there for a reason
-Achievements (and collectibles) that enhance the joy of exploration (more on that later)
-Figuring out the story and how it’s an impressive accomplishment to be told so well despite the lack of words
-How every element comes together to create a game where the developers know what they want and they succeeded with their goals

Flaws:
-Animations can be odd sometimes when climbing or jumping down 
-The graphics can have some minor visual bugs when you’re swimming underwater
-Very few collectibles/achievements are 100% impossible to figure out without a guide or pure luck
-The quality of the soundtrack is not very high. You don’t hear the music with full clarity, like there’s a minor muffle. But it might be just my headset
-The chapters are long, you can’t start from a different point in chapter select for specific collectibles/achievements 
-The game needs time to grow on you and show you all it has to offer. You also need to go out of your way to put the pieces together. At a first glance you might think the game is boring and don’t understand the appeal because of this 

The achievements are the star of the show. Aside from the story progression/collectibles, there are unique achievements that beg you to explore. Each achievement has unique icon and description. Those are especially effective after completing the game once. Because you will then vaguely remember what is being referenced and then you go there to confirm. It’s such a pleasant feeling when you get things right. The best way to play this game is at least a complete first run without looking things up. Just enjoy the game, try to find the secrets on your own and then look things up with chapter select. I did my first run completely blind, second run I mostly tried doing things on my own with some pointers/hints to send me in the right direction and then it was chapter select getting everything missed with a guide. The last step is not as bad as it sounds as the game saves the moment you find something. So you don’t have to complete a chapter or reach a checkpoint. 

Even though I haven’t played games like Abzu and Journey yet, I think Rime is often compared with those games. I know that those games are more well known and popular. I’m guessing that Rime is not as good as those best games in the genre but it should definitely be played if you’re a fan of those type of games.

Ich bin jetzt noch komplett fertig von dem Ende des Spiels.
Wer Erkundungs-Spiele mag findet hier ein wundervolles Exemplar, was verhältnismäßig schnell durchzuspielen geht.

[h3]Positives:[/h3]
Das gesamte Spiel kommt ohne Dialoge an sich aus. Alles passiert über Musik, tonale Unterstützung und einfach das was man auf dem Bildschirm sieht. Das hat einen besonderen Charme und ist überhaupt nicht störend. Die Musik ist einfach immer genau passend und wunderschön!
Die Rätsel sind meist recht einfach, aber dennoch schön gemacht.

Die Story lässt immer mal wieder durchblicken, wenn man sich drauf einlässt und rätselt.
Am Ende hat es meine Zuschauer und mich einfach komplett aus dem Leben genommen.

[h3]Negatives:[/h3]
Bei einer Steuerung mit Tastatur und Maus zumindest (Controller nicht probiert) ist die Kameraführung bei manchen Kletterpassagen einfach nicht gut und störend. Zum Glück halten sich diese problematischen Passagen in Grenzen.

Im ersten Durchlauf habe ich 10 Std. gebraucht und hatte ungefähr 70% aller Sammel-Stücke, die anderen 10 Stunden waren dann für die 100% nötig. Wenn man direkt genau hinschaut etc. sollte man das in 15Std. schaffen.

[hr][/hr] 

I really want to like this game, because the overall visual aesthetic and soundtrack are excellent.

That said, there were a lot of issues with this game that ultimately led me to stop playing this game after starting Chapter 4 (of 5):
[list]
    [*] Platforming controls aren't very good
        [list]
            [*] For example, jumping backwards off a ledge to grab another ledge had some finicky controls that required experimentation to figure out how to get consistent at
        [/list]
    [*] Movement feels clunky and isn't as forgiving as it should be
        [list]
            [*] Most notably, coyote time isn't very forgiving if you jump a bit too early to cover a gap
            [*] Note: This may be the developers' and/or designers' intention to make the player feel weak/insignificant (similar to [i]Shadow of the Colossus[/i] and [i]Ico[/i]); however, it's all the more grating given the issues with the platforming controls mentioned earlier that mean you have to backtrack to start your attempted solution again
        [/list]
    [*] Puzzles have bad signposting/previews - some examples in the first chapter alone:
        [list]
            [*] Ledge highlighting is [i]usually[/i] (but not always) done with white paint streaks; however, these are exceptionally hard to pick out when placed on near-white stone, which occurs with some frequency
            [*] Archway assembly puzzle - [spoiler]specifically the one where you have to move the block towards the entry doorway & aim the pedestal to add the partial arch to the block's arch segment[/spoiler] - isn't hinted at before the first time it's used as a puzzle mechanic, and to add insult to injury, [spoiler]it's never used again (at least through the beginning of chapter 4)[/spoiler]
            [*] Shadow puzzles (where you have to align shadows with glyphs/pictograms on walls) aren't shown off very well - the first time it's shown towards the end of the first chapter, it's not obvious [spoiler]that the player's shadow is also a part of the puzzle[/spoiler] and should have had 1-2 additional puzzles to ""explain"" the shadow puzzle
        [/list]
    [*] Story pacing is too slow and/or abstract for its own good
        [list]
            [*] First chapter is fine - establishing cinematic of the shipwreck & the tower as a weenie/objective is excellent
            [*] However, subsequent chapters don't have as compelling a narrative
            [*] Metanarrative is only revealed in between chapters, but is so obtuse that it doesn't really start to make sense until the transition/interlude between chapters 3 & 4 (out of 5)
        [/list]
    [*] Collectibles feel poorly planned out and added as an afterthought
        [list]
            [*] The first chapter has 2-3 categories of collectibles that can be grabbed, which should be sufficient for a game of this scope
            [*] However, it feels like each subsequent chapter introduces another category of collectibles on top of the known categories
            [*] The only categories that feel well thought out IMO are the [spoiler]lullabies and keyholes[/spoiler]
        [/list]
    [*] General lack of Quality of Life improvements
        [list]
            [*] There's no button that can be pressed to snap the camera to the current objective and/or the fox, which can be especially annoying when you have to listen to the fox yips but you have no idea where the fox is
            [*] No hint system is available when stuck - not looking for a dedicated button to automatically ""solve"" the puzzle, but would like hints if I've spent 5+ minutes trying to find the right solution (again, see ""Puzzles have bad signposting"" section above)
            [*] Timed doors/mechanisms don't have any visible timers/indications of how long they'll be active for - this is most frustrating/notable when some platforms are only temporarily activated and require good timing to reach/use (again, see ""bad platforming controls"" and ""clunky movement"")
        [/list]
[/list]

RIME - яркий пример того, как идеи разработчиков заканчиваются, не успев начаться.  
В игре по факту три уровня (или главы). Разработчикам просто то ли времени не хватило, то ли идеи закончились, но на четвёртой главе их хватило только на одноклеточный паркур, никаких загадок там нет. Зато беготни в последнюю, маленькую часть игры засунули с избытком.
Вообще видно, что с геймдизайном авторы знакомы лишь понаслышке. 
Вот лежит каменный блок с белой отметкой - на него можно забраться, рядом, в качестве препятствия - точно такой же, но, извините, на него забраться нельзя.
Вот вам загадка со светящимся шариком. А в соседней комнате ещё светящийся шар, с помощью которого эту загадку можно было бы решить быстрее, но мы вам не дадим этот шар закинуть в комнату, просто потому что. Весьма тупо. 
Если ещё заморочиться поиском всех дополнительных коллекционных предметов, беготня в игре займёт около 2/3 от вашего игрового процесса. Как вы понимаете, это разработчиков характеризует весьма плохо.
Сюжет. 
С ним вообще беда. Если у вас становится чуть более понятно, что произошло с мальчиком только в заключительном ролике, ну, значит вы, как разработчик и в сюжет не смогли. Но, опять же, остаётся куча вопросов, на которые не будет ответа. Кто эти тени, что за остров, что за механизмы, что случилось с мамой мальчика, кто фигура в красной накидке, если красную накидку носит пацан? Ответов вы не найдёте, а значит, с повествованием у игры серьёзная беда.
Да, неплохая картинка, но оптимизация местами хромает (я раз пять проваливался сквозь текстурки).
Неплохая фоновая музыка, но в отрыве от игры её и не вспомнишь.
Даже как инди игра на любителя. Её большим достоинствои является то, что она достаточно короткая. Хотя, если убрать всю бессмысленную беготню, проходится она часа за три, что по мне маловато.
Ну и напоследок ещё камешек в огород разработчиков. Я люблю исследовать открытые миры игр, но если уж даже я, пройдя игру и облазив почти всё, что мог, открыл 11 ачивок из 31, мои полномочия как бы всё.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

RiME is an puzzle/adventure game developed by Tequila Works, with heavy emphasis in visual and environmental storytelling. To be honest, I played this game before cracked, but I decided to buy it to support the developers, because I liked it... a lot. Let me explain why.

[h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]

It's difficult to talk about worldbuilding in a game like this, because the player visits several worlds, each with its own theme and aesthetics, but one thing they have in common is their rules. The way puzzles are resolved is consistent in every world, and seem to function the same, no matter where the player are in the game, which implies the existence of some sort of magic. And given the overall intentions of the writers with this game, I'd say it's pretty consistent in essence. If the rules were different for each world, taking into account the main storyline, that would be jarring, and would disconnect the player from the flow of the story. Fortunately, that doesn't happen.

[h1] The plot [/h1]

Surprinsingly, the plot of this game is very simple. It's just the story of a person going through the five states of grief. Why this person is grieving I won't mention, because it'd spoil the whole story and would robbed it from it's punch, because the story of this game packs a punch alright. I said this game relies heavily, if not completely, on visual and environmental storytelling, and it does it wonderfully. It conveys a hard-hitting messsage without any line of dialogue. Seriously. This game has no dialogue, but the story is written and designed in such a way that they didn't need to. It takes the ""show, don't tell"" mantra to a whole new level. And that's applicable to either the story and the gameplay (which I'll discuss in the related section). Pro-tip: getting all the white shades makes the ending way more powerful. Refer to guides if you are lost.

[h1] The characters [/h1]

This game features only two characters, a father and his son. The player controls the son. Since there is no dialogue, it's hard to evaluate goals, motivations and personalities. But his actions throughout the game speaks of someone who is kind and compassionate, because of how he interacts with different elements or sentient beings in the game, and the father obviously loves his son, because of some things that happen at the end of the game. Some beings, like the fox, the sentinels and the giant bird are allegories to things in the world the child used to belong to, and represent the five stages of grief perfectly.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay is also pretty simple. The character the player controls can jump, roll, crouch, grab to ledges, the works. Basic platforming, in short. There are underwater zones too. He can also interact with several objects, like blocks, keys, balls of light and other elements. The puzzles in this game are basic but curiously satisfying. There are basic perspective puzzles, light and dark puzzles, activate all statues puzzles, and so on. The player can also make the playable character to use his voice to a number of purposes, like breaking jars, light up fires, even to solve most of the puzzles in the game (hence, the comment at the beginning). Because the controls are simple and intuitive, the main character is easy to control, and makes traversing the world a breeze. There are no tutorials that break the momentum of the game, only unintrusive control pop-ins when performing an action for the first time that don't stop the flow of the game whatsoever. Oh, and there is plenty of collectibles, too.

[h1] Artistic and technical elements [/h1]

The art direction of this game is lovely and somewhat cartoonish, but fits the setting and the tone of the game. Sure, this game hasn't the best of graphics, but, with a story like that, who needs ultra-realistic graphics? Plus, the art direction more than makes up for it. But one thing this game deserves praise is the music. It combines with the story to give it extra punch, and makes all the emotional highs of the game even better. Since there is no dialogue, I won't mention voice acting quality, but the sounds the boy makes fits the actions he performs and the context he is in. The performance, though, is a mixed bag. I played this game for the first time with a laptop GTX 1060, and the framerate dropped like a rock, even when the visuals doesn't look demanding at all. I had to lower the settings to get a playable framerate, so optimization was an issue then. I wouldn't know now, because my RTX 4070 runs everything just fine. The collision system needs work, though, because there were places that the character won't move, even when there wasn't any collision object, like a step or a wall.

In conclusion:

[b] Pros: [/b]

-Excellent story with a hard-hitting message.
-Superb visual and environmental storytelling.
-Simple but functional gameplay.
-The music was just awesome.

[b] Cons: [/b]

-Some performance issues (and that's tentative)
-Collision system is imperfect in some instances.

I wish more developers told stories the way this game does, because dialogue, if not done well, can do horrors to a story-driven game, Forspoken being a prime example of this. This game, on the other hand, thanks to the strength of its visual and environmental storytelling, its no-frills gameplay and tear-inducing ending, has no need for it. It's amazing how much this game achieves with so little, and that's why I recommend this game.",1691186487,1691187069,True,3,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False,True,,,

스페인 게임사인 Tequila Works에서 개발한 퍼즐 어드벤처 게임으로
유적으로 가득한 외딴섬에 표류한 왕의 아들인 주인공이 여우와 함께
곳곳에 숨겨진 비밀을 파헤치며 섬에서 탈출해 왕에게로 돌아가는 여정을 그려냈다.

무명 영화처럼 자막과 설명 없이 스토리를 풀어내게끔 했으며
간단한 퍼즐과 고요한 섬을 탐험하는 듯한 효과음, 감동적인 OST로
이 게임만의 섬마다 같은 아름다운 분위기를 느낄 수 있다.

조작이 애매모호한 편이고 명시적인 목표가 없어 헤매기 일쑤이다.
이쪽으로 가면 된다는 식으로 길을 알려주니 살짝 불친절하다고 느낄 수도 있다.

Quick Text Review:

You seemingly washed up on an island, almost no voice and guidance. Try and figure it out in this artsy game... where the protagonist has a mullet!
-Simple 3D platforming (Like a stripped down Prince of Persia)
-Inventive, if easy, puzzles to solve
-Some collectables to find (If there is a feeling of forward momentum and backtracking is discouraged)
-That may sound negative but the game is fun
-Implied/ symbolic story telling that at first felt like common indie fare (With some predictable elements) but there was a symbolic layer that only revealed itself at the end when I saw the cut scene and took a look at the level selection screen that paid off emotionally (If that screen is available before the end of the game I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU AVOID IT TO PREVENT A SPOILER!)
-No dialogue though
-Lovely sombre music that drives the symbolism home
-Great cell shaded visuals depicting beautiful Mediterranean environs
-Really worthwhile but ultimately an artsy game where the game play isn't the point as much 

Practical Concerns:
-Bad value for money (R13.93/ hour for me - $ and £ values in video)
-Fairly big download size (7.26 Gb on the hard drive)
-Not THAT easy to run
-I'd argue it's kid friendly in spite of the more grim elements",1687990919,1687990919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

A trilha sonora de RiME é um dos aspectos mais marcantes do jogo. A música, é emocionalmente envolvente e se funde perfeitamente com a jornada do personagem. Cada melodia me transportava para dentro do mundo do jogo, intensificando as emoções que a história tentava transmitir.

O fato da história de RiME ser contada de forma simbólica e abstrata, deixando muitos detalhes abertos à interpretação individual de cada pessoa que o joga, é um ponto que eu gostei muito dentro desse jogo, porque você pode interpretar da sua própria maneira o que acontece, diferente dos jogos de hoje que perderam um pouco dessa essência.

RiME é um jogo que eu recomendo para qualquer pessoa que valorize a beleza visual e a atmosfera emocional. É uma experiência única e memorável, que me conquistou com sua estética deslumbrante e sua trilha sonora cativante, e definitivamente é um jogo que continuarei a lembrar.

Rime oyununu oynarken sürekli bu ne, şu ne, bu neden var diyeceksiniz fakat oyun, sonuyla sizi fazlasıyla tatmin edecek ve hatta ağlatacak.

Oyunumuz küçük açık dünyacıklardan oluşmakta olup her açık dünyada çeşitli bulmacaları farklı mekanik ve platform ögeleri ile yapmamızı bekliyor. Bunu yaparken size tatlış mı tatlış bir tilki eşlik ediyor. Size belli başlı yerlerde nereye gideceğiniz konusunda yardımı dokunuyor fakat bunun dışında kendi yolunuzu kendiniz buluyorsunuz.

Bu kısa giriş sonrası aşağıda hafif eksileri, eksileri ve artıları sıraladım. Eksiler, oynayanı rahatsız edebilecek ögeleri; hafif eksiler ise rahatsız etmeyen ama olmasa da olur denebilecek özellikleri temsil etmektedir:

[b] Hafif Eksiler: [/b]

[*] Oyun oldukça kısa. Ben oyunu 3.5-4 saat içerisinde bitirdim. Belki daha fazla mekanik ve harita eklenip oyun daha uzun yapılabilirmiş.
[*] Belki de karaktere ses eklenebilirmiş. Bu haliyle de çok iyi ama az da olsa konuştuğunu görebilsek daha iyi olabilirdi (en azından son sahnelerde).


[b] Eksiler: [/b]

[*] Oyunda çok ciddi bir optimizasyon sorunu var. 4070 TI ekran kartım olmasına rağmen yer yer FPS değerleri 60-70'lere düştü ve rahatsız etmedi değil. Bu tarz bir oyunda bu derece bir FPS düşüşü görmek hoş değil.
[*] Hikaye sonlara doğru tamamlanıyor ve anlaşılabiliyor. Herkesin bir hikaye anlatma şekli var ama benim beklentim oyun içerisine dağıtılabilecek alt hikayeler konması.
[*] Oyunda bazen nereye gideceğinizi bilemeyebilirsiniz. Açıkçası ben 1 veya 2 yerde yaşadım ama bazıları bu durumu fazlaca yaşayabilir çünkü harita sistemi bulunmuyor. Fakat bunun için oyun bazı yerlerde sizin turuncu bir tilkiyi takip etmenizi istiyor. O belirli bölgeler harici kaybolabilirsiniz. Belki belli bir süre geçilemeyen bölgelerde yardımcı olabilecek bazı şeyler eklenebilirmiş.


[b] Artılar: [/b]

[*] Aslında oyun çok duygusal bir hikayeye sahip ve her ne kadar bu hikayeye başlamayı ve bitirmeyi oyun sonuna bıraksa da insanı oldukça duygulandırıyor. Sinematik sahneleri ve grafikleri ile oyuncuyu hikaye açısından içine çekiyor.
[*] Grafikler sanatsal açıdan çok iyi bir seviyede.
[*] Çeşitli mekanikleri oyunun farklı bölgelerine serpiştirmişler ve bu yüzden oyundan sıkılmıyorsunuz. Sürekli yeni bir şeyler vaad ediyor.
[*] Müzikleri muhteşem. İnsanın içine işliyor. Ayrıca yeterli sayıda müzik bestelenmiş, hep aynı müzikleri duymuyorsunuz, bu yüzden içinizi sıkmıyor.
[*] Karmaşık bir tuş düzeni yok. Bazı oyunlar gibi 10-15 tuşla oynatmıyor. Gayet de 5-6 tuş ile çok farklı mekanikleri büyük bir zevkle oynayabiliyorsunuz.
[*] Çok fazla şaşırtıcı bir şekilde oyunda bir tane bile bug'a rastlamadım. Genelde bu tarz konularda bahtsızımdır ve ayrıca bug bulmak için her şeyi yapmaya çalışırım ama bu oyun çok temiz yapılmış.
[*] Save sistemi sizi üzmüyor. Yanlışlıkla bir yere düşüp öldüğünüzde oyun sizi çok çok yakın bir yerde tekrardan doğuruyor. Bu sayede üfleyip püflemiyorsunuz.
[*] Oyunun atmosferi harika. Fazla söze gerek yok.

Genele bakınca oyun harika bir seviyede. Her yaştan oyuncuya hitap ediyor ama daha çok bulmaca, platform severlere öneririm. Ben bu oyunu 10-15 TL gibi bir fiyata aldım ve kendi adıma söyleyebilirim ki bu oyun fiyat-performans oyunu. Verdiğiniz fiyatın karşılığını fazlasıyla veriyor.

Not a bad shock, I mean, it made me a little bit sad, but it also made me appreciate all the effort, and it made me reflect on the mourning stages I have been going through. Exiting to the main menu to see the names of each stage blew my mind too.

Todo en él va de la mano para crear una experiencia emotiva y preciosista. 

El apartado artístico es una pasada. Cuenta con escenarios tremendamente bellos (con diferentes paletas de colores), y con unos personajes adorables. En cuanto a la banda sonora, puedo decir que es de las más bonitas que he oído nunca en un videojuego.

Por otro lado, la jugabilidad es la clásica del género. No deja de ser un walking simulator con algo de plataformas y puzles sencillos, pero funciona todo a las mil maravillas (controles muy sólidos y fiables).

Lo único malo que tiene es el rendimiento. No está todo lo bien optimizado que debería y, a veces, sufre bajadas de FPS sin sentido. Al menos, ya no tiene Denuvo (espero que hayan aprendido y no vuelvan a usarlo nunca más).

Me sorprende que este juego y su banda sonora no hayan sido más reconocidos. Desconozco los motivos, no sé si adoleció de publicidad en su momento, pero para mí, dentro del mundillo de los [i]juegos contemplativos[/i] recientes, RiME es, sin duda alguna, el mejor de todos (ligeramente por delante de GRIS, y bastante por encima de otros más conocidos como Journey o ABZÛ).

En resumen, RiME es un imprescindible si buscas algo relajado, bonito o emocional.

剧目B：主题（缅怀），场景（家庭），时间（我认为是自夜晚到日出这一段时间）

首先来谈论剧目A。逃离是一个经典的主题，而逃离和岛屿的联系同样是紧密的。岛屿是“孤立”的常用象征（“孤岛”），不仅仅在物理上（或者生态学上）表现为独立，同时还表现为构造联系的失败。岛屿与岛屿、岛屿与陆地的联系是断裂的，或者说岛屿在联系上是失能的。举例来说，加拉帕戈斯群岛就因为这种孤立和割裂诞生了特有的生物，而许多岛屿上的网络一直到星链的诞生才有所改善。这时候反观人类社会，观察人类社会的本质——语言。语言的特点是其效力终止于人类活动的边界，这意味着语言的特点就包括联系。人类通过语言表现其渴望联系的特征，由此与孤立形成了对立。于是，“逃离岛屿”这个游戏中常见的母题就有了其存在的基础，即对人类本性的表达。剧目A中我们也可以看到语言在这里是缺席的。

接下来谈论剧目B。缅怀是一个游戏中不算非常常见的主题，这个主题往往有着较慢的节奏和微动作（眼神、颤抖、心理活动等），这些在游戏中不太好表现。但是RiME选择了这个主题。为什么说是缅怀，是因为缅怀实际上暗示着放手，暗示着一种精神上的葬礼。那么在RiME中是如何表现的呢？首先是基础的微动作和心理刻画，手握钥匙着钥匙（内心的纠结），缓慢颤抖的步态，开门前的回望，发现儿子幻影瞪大了眼睛，毫无迟疑的闭眼拥抱（闭眼很关键），放走红色披风前的迟疑，放走红色披风后闭上眼睛（怅惘）。这些实际上已经非常到位，但是他们做了更多。儿子房间的窗外，给人的第一印象是夕阳，那种昏黄的光线分明就在应和着这个悲情、令人断肠的故事，最后一幕父亲脸上打上的昏黄的伦勃朗光，更是把整个故事拉到悲伤的高潮。然而，最后答案揭晓，当红色的披风缓缓飞走，一轮日头冉冉升起，原来那并不是夕阳，而是一轮朝阳！这种手法让人想起透纳的《被拖去解体的战舰无畏号》，画面中的太阳结合画作的主题，常常被第一眼当作夕阳，昭示着前工业时代的落幕，然而最后又可以根据泰晤士河的朝向判断，太阳此时正是在东方，那边只有可能是朝阳。这种手法暗示了一种情绪变化（接受现实，迎接新生活），在人物退场之后把剧情进一步演绎，让剧目B的完整程度达到了前所未有的程度。

这两部剧目本身都已经相当完善，都可以单独演绎。剧目A可以在跃入星空时通过星辰的光切换到全屏白色后结束，也可以在最后切换水平镜头让红色的披风回归大海，正如开头一样；剧目B则无需什么修改。当然这些都是我瞎想的。正如我们看到的，最终作者把这两部剧目合并到了一起，它们就像对着放的镜面一样，产生了无穷的倒影。A中出现的诸多物件以及海洋、帆船等，都在B中找到了对应。而B在结束后呈现出的章节名称（死亡后情绪的五阶段），又把A给诠释了。如果按照一种奇幻式的理解，认为儿子“显灵了”，就让整体显得过分平淡。就我的理解，我认为剧目A是父亲的梦境，充满了奇幻的元素，最后的坠落可能是肌抽跃（也就是你在梦中会感觉从高空坠落那种体验）的一种表现。如此绮丽的梦，让人怀疑，父亲到底在多少个夜晚经历这个梦，又多少次因惊吓而醒，在离儿子房间最远的屋子静坐。他在等待戈多吗？心中期许着奇迹，又害怕梦的破碎。爱斯特拉冈和弗拉季米尔没有等到戈多，好在父亲等到了。玩家扮演的戈多驱使着父亲打开门，又让父亲见证了奇迹，这种自责与懊悔的闭环终于得以打破，父亲终于是走出了悲痛。

可是这是真的走出悲痛吗？父亲是否仍然在梦中，我们不得而知，但可以知道的是，如果没有玩家的操控，父亲将会一直坐在那张椅子上，他将永远无法迎来奇迹。这个游戏的主题是相当罕见的反崇高。我们知道感知崇高（Sublime）是一种认识到强力（绝对的大）不具有强制力（服从）的过程，诸如登顶珠峰、血战得胜中都有崇高，这也是许多游戏中的主题。但是RiME中是一种对感知崇高的反对，一种对所谓“健全知性”存在的否定，最终落脚在对人的关怀。如果对崇高的感知不可避免牵涉于梦境、游戏、超现实、神灵，那么这种所谓的感知崇高于现实中的崇高又有什么意义呢？再多的对崇高的感知，巨塔、海洋、天空，梦境中的仿拟需要多少次才能在现实中构建起来，这个时间会是永远吗？然而人不适合永远，“永恒”对于人类是无意义词汇。这说明死去的不只有孩子，还有所谓的哲学和理性，“永恒的相下”成了可笑至极的无用之物，一并消亡于真实。

You have no conventional weapons, you have no portable tools. Have to use your head and the items around you to figure out each puzzle, how to deal with the giant bird, or how to avoid the deadly soul sucking ghosts.

There is a twist at the end of the game that can make it a  real emotional gut punch, and I think it's really well done. I just find myself wishing the game was a little longer.

Lo jugué en un Ryzen 3 1200 con una 1050ti y sufrí tremendas caídas de FPS en zonas con muchas partículas (como la parte final con la lluvia o las zonas con caídas de agua) hasta tal punto que se hacía injugable e incluso me daban náuseas de los movimientos de cámara tan bruscos. Sin embargo ni el uso de CPU ni el uso de GPU llegaban al 100%, pocas veces subían por encima del 90%. Era como si no hubiera ni cuello de botella de CPU ni GPU, pero el juego ""no iba fino"".

Pude disfrutar y completar el juego con un portátil con una 1060m de 6 GB y un i7-7700HQ.

Ahora (al escribir esta reseña) he cambiado el R3 1200 por un Ryzen 5 5600G y el juego se comporta de manera estable prácticamente como una roca a 60 fps con exactamente la misma gráfica (la 1050ti), memoria, etc. Eso significa que de alguna manera el cuello de CPU era el procesador, pero me sigue pareciendo extrañísimo que no se pusiera al 100% para indicarlo. ¿Quizá no era capaz de aprovechar el paralelismo de los cuatro núcleos y su rendimiento estaba fijado por lo que era capaz de dar un único núcleo en particular?

Bueno, ahora la reseña ""buena"" del juego:

El juego no tiene una elevada dificultad, ni falta que le hace para poder ser disfrutable. Los puzzles se dejan resolver con sencillez y muy pocas veces nos veremos perdidos en el mundo buscando cómo resolverlos.

Para mí eso es un punto muy positivo.

He jugado a juegos en los que me he quedado atascado en algún puzzle durante más tiempo del deseado no porque no fuera capaz de resolverlo por mí mismo, si no porque no estaba bien diseñado el juego para ""mostrar"" las pistas necesarias para que lo resuelvas, y en algunas ocasiones la resolución parecía que tenías que saberla de antemano sin que recibieras pistas de ninguna manera.

En ese aspecto este juego me parece fantástico. Un equilibrio muy bueno que, además, suma el hecho de que tras finalizarlo (y soltar unas lágrimas por la empatía que te genera el juego) quieras jugar un poco más para encontrar los juguetes perdidos.

Al final no he completado esa tarea, pero fue en lo primero en lo que pensé cuando lo terminé, pero sugerí a mi hija que lo jugara y eso terminó haciéndome olvidar ese impulso de buscar yo mismo los objetos coleccionables que dejé atrás.

Como mi hija solo pudo jugar en el PC con el Ryzen 3 1200, lo dejó abandonado cuando llegó a la zona de la lluvia (casi al final del juego). No me dijo directamente el motivo por el que lo abandonó, pero imagino que (al igual que yo) se debió sentir mal tras jugar un rato con tan mal rendimiento.

Juego sencillo de jugar con puzzles no muy complicados, bastante lineal hasta el punto de que no me empujo mucho a la exploración, así que los coleccionables prácticamente me los perdi todos, excepto los mas obvios, el camino a seguir para avanzar es bastante obvio. 

Gráficamente y artísticamente es muy bonito y atractivo a la vista. La música acompaña muy bien y tiene un aire a El viaje de Chihiro (spirited away), una de mis películas favoritas de Studio Ghibli.

Дизайн относительно минималистичен, представляет смесь сказки и средиземноморских мотивов, используются яркие цвета, ничего лишнего, цветофильтр и тени такие, как надо, особенно красиво выглядит локация из первой главы - хотелось бы в игре такого побольше. Пожалуй, необычно красивая картинка - главное увлекающее достоинство.

Но это не делает остальные аспекты посредственными, ведь геймдизайн этой игры почти не репитативен, каждая ситуация и головоломка (есть как простые, так и немного более сложные, на внимательность) новая. Локации исследовать интересно, как из-за эстетики, так и благодаря компактности мира и его устройства. Музыка приятна, но большинство мелодий не запоминаются, разве что кроме темы Колыбельной. Игра уважает время игрока, она не растянута для галочки. Поскольку мир в этой игре то ли игра сознания, то ли загробный - здесь много символов. Проблема в том, что до части из них можно найти толкование и выстроить догадки, но остальные не находят правдоподобных версий, оставляя место СПГСу. В связи с этим игра оставляет больше вопросов, чем ответов (при том, что продолжения не будет). Сюжет не сразу даёт понять, что это история утраты, с соответствующим настроением она и оставляет после финала, а ведь поначалу казалось, что игра более весёлая. 

Коллектиблы немногочисленны, но найти их бывало не просто - кстати, могли бы быть поинтереснее. Ачивки позволяют выбить идеалку, некоторые условия креативны. Игра удобна для геймпада - вибрации от перетаскивания предмета по шероховатому пола хороши. Взаимодействие с головоломками и миром в половине случаев связаны с голосом (ГГ не говорит, но поёт, смеётся, плачет, в общем, выражает чувства, которые понятны на всех языках мира без использования языка), в остальном надо что-то двигать, взбираться, соотносить предметы.

That is, unfortunately, where the praise ends, as aesthetic alone is not enough to drive progression of this particular experience, and both the puzzle design and the story are in need of improvement. Despite owning this game since release, it has taken me 5 years to make any significant progress on it.
The story isn't bad, it's just not particularly compelling, falling prey to the phenomenon of feeling primarily driven by plot rather than by the motivations of the character.
The puzzle design was where I encountered the most frustration, often not knowing what my goal was, I spent most of the game just doing whatever was available to me at the time, hoping that it would lead to progression.

First, the gameplay. Your player character moves rather slowly, and feels very stiff and heavy to move. It felt really cumbersome playing as him, especially since the game features lots of platforming and exploration. The camera is awkward as hell, and will fix angles for you whether you want it to or not.

Second, the collectables. There are so many freaking collectables in this game, and most of them feel pointless. The toy collectables contribute to the game's ending, one outfit helps with an achievement and the shells unlock a nice lullaby, but beyond that, none of the collectables unlock any special features. Combined with the awkward game mechanics above, they feel more like a chore to collect after awhile.

Third (and probably most relevant to a lot of people), the price. Forty freaking dollars??? For an indie game that you can beat in under 10 hours? This isn't something like, say, Hellblade or A Plague Tale, which weren't triple A games but still clearly had a sizeable budget and a lot of work put into the graphics, voice acting, etc. This game feels massively overpriced for what it is, especially when similar games like Journey, ABZU, or even Gris each cost $20 or less.

Honestly tho I think the MAIN reason I don't fully recommend this game is the attitude of the developers. For the last Steam Awards they tried to encourage their fans to help make it a candidate for the Labor of Love award...even tho the last update for the game was four years ago. Either the devs genuinely didn't understand what the award was for, or their sense of ego was so inflated they thought they could get away with getting an undeserved nomination. I'm hoping it's the former, but either way it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

This is not a bad game by any means, and I did find parts of it enjoyable, but there are better games out there, including but also ESPECIALLY Journey, ABZU, and Gris mentioned above.

Giudizio finale:
Un Indie Game davvero molto carino. Graficamente simile a Zelda: Breath of the Wild, il gioco in realtà si differenzia molto visto che non ci sono combattimenti, ma solo Puzzle da risolvere per proseguire nella vostra avventura. Nessuna mappa e nessun dialogo, solo qualche piccolo indizio per aiutarvi a risolvere i vostri enigmi che qualche volta risultano un pò troppo semplici. Peccato per la longevità, alla fine il gioco risulta essere così piacevole che vorreste continuasse ancora!

Wait for a sale as the running-time is a detractor.
The presentation of the experience is beautiful and near flawless, from visual to sound design everything lines up to completely engage you into the flow of the action. Puzzle design is relatively simple because it is intended to allow you to progress and the act of solving the puzzles is built into the presentation itself.

If you are reading this review because you saw the screenshots and it looks like the kind of game that you would like then I would definitely recommend it: It's extremely well done for what it is, looks even better in motion, and also has really good sound and music design.

Based purely on game mechanics I would rate it as good but not great (although there are a handful of stand out puzzles). If you aren't interested in the more emotional/artistic aspects of games then there are probably other games that you would enjoy more. Even with that caveat, however, RiME has the feeling of being a labor of love, and it feels like the result of not only a strong initial design vision but also the result of iteration and polish so that everything works together well and the whole feels greater than the sum of its individual parts. I think it is a good example of a game that does exactly what it sets out to do.
(I think it's worth giving a special mention to the use of dynamic music in the game. I was constantly impressed with how the music seamlessly reacted to what I was doing, and not just by cross fading to a music cue but instead by actually having the music cue emerge from the music that was already playing.)",1645382903,1645382903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Графика балансирует на грани между стильностью и примитивностью, да еще и тормозить умудряется.
Геймплей состоит из бесконечной, бесконечной, бесконечной беготни по ОГРОМНЫМ, мать его, пространствам. По песку, по траве, по пещере, по руинам, по камням, по воде. Бегаешь, бегаешь, бегаешь, бегаешь, бегаешь, бегаешь периодически решая простейшие головоломки под красивую музыку. Меня хватило на 5 часов этой беготни, потом я подгорел и плюнул.
Экшена в игре нет, нет сражений : она очень медитативная и очень на любителя.
Сюжета в игре нет, вернее он есть в гомеопатических количествах и то, если собирать секреты. А для этого надо что? Правильно! Опять, бегать, бегать, бегать, бегать, бегать, бегать!!! Поэтому в гробу я видал этот сюжет, и того, кто придумал так его подавать!
Ух, бомбит-то как!!!
P.S.
Почитал другие отзывы и ОКАЗЫВАЕТСЯ в конце игры есть НЕВЕРОЯТНЫЙ сюжетный твист, который перевернет ваше отношение к жизни! Очень, блин, смешно. Мне, спустя пять часов игры, как было наплевать на всех персонажей, что упоминались в игре, так и осталось. А наплевать мне было потому, что они вообще никак не раскрываются - это тупо пустые болванчики, которым разработчики на всю игру выдали пару эмоций и все.
Ну и возникает вопрос : нафига терпеть эту скучную игру ради концовки, если ее можно просто посмотреть на ютубе и не тратить свое время?
Хотите неожиданную развязку? Brothers : a Tale of Two Sons - в ней и геймплей гораздо разнообразнее и инновационнее, она выглядит лучше, не растянута, и в ней, в отличии от RIME, ЕСТЬ сюжет!

Every piece of it has been set up as a challenge for you to overcome. You're not exploring a world, you're going through a sequence of goals; and if you see a bunch of touch obstacles coming up ahead, you know you're going to have to get through it somehow.

In that, Rime isn't exactly my favorite kind of game. I like solving puzzles, sure, but I like the feeling that I happen to be finding a way through a strange land - not that I am finding THE only way through the strange land, the specific path that's been laid out for me. Every ledge in Rime is one you'll have to climb up onto, every item is one you'll have to use somehow, every side path leads either forward or to one of the bonus collectibles you'll find which fill in some of the story. (I'd have preferred this game if I only needed to complete *some* of the goals to proceed, whereas *all* goals completed would unlock an achievement or a bonus item, perhaps.)

And the story's not much to begin with. Kid washes up on an island and immediately starts figuring out how to get past the obstacles that have been set in his way. There's a fox companion, but unlike other games with fox companions (The First Tree, Lost Ember [actually a wolf], Never Alone, Spirit of the North), this one barks like a dog and appears to only have the purpose of showing you which way to go next, as the lavish environments sometimes make that difficult to figure out. Finding the collectibles helps explain what's going on, but I got tired of exploring every nook and cranny, so I was left in the dark. The endgame really brings the story to life and throws in some beautiful music, but I wish that had been part of the game all along.",1641874007,1641874007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Les musiques sont magnifiques et se marient à la perfection avec les évènements du jeu. Elles participent ainsi à l'immersion. 
Les graphismes sont simples mais ils n'ont pas besoin d'être plus poussés. Ce style graphique fait parti du charme de RIME. Les différents protagonistes sont attachants et certaines séparations sont assez dur à oublier.
L'histoire quand à elle est poétique et soulève beaucoup de questions. Les mystères sont nombreux à demeurer non élucidés et cela ajoute selon moi une certaine profondeur à cette œuvre. 
Il n'y a aucune parole, seules les images, les créatures et les décors sont là pour permettre au joueur de comprendre l'étendu de ce à quoi il fait face. Et voyant un jeu qui arrive à conter autant, sans un seul mot, est selon moi une preuve que l'on a affaire à une très belle œuvre artistique. 

Pour conclure, aussi bien pour la puissance de son propos que son onirisme, RIME est à mettre au même niveau que GRIS qui m'avait aussi beaucoup touché.

Viento a viento va, el sueño del mar Gira sin parar
Viento a viento va, durmiendo al sol Un guiño de luz se perdió
Tu cuerpo se hace vientre, estatua transparente
En la arena oscura esperarás 
Viento a viento va, bailando el mar Esta sola voz se quebró
Pájaros de sal, ciegos de llorar 
Vuelven a volar
Viento a viento va, este pequeño 
Temblor que jamás gritó
A la luz, al árbol, a la lluvia
A la voz, al aire, al final
Y así  este viento va, girando
Y así  este viento va, se fue
Y así  este niño va llorando, llorando

書き写しただけなので内容の検証はできません。追記おわり


音楽と綺麗な景色が印象的な３D雰囲気アドベンチャー。
少年を操作し遺跡っぽい建物のギミックを解いて進みます。
言語は一切なし。昼夜があり、満天の星空が出色の出来です。
物語のみなら６～８時間程度。

[b]古いPCでは動かないくらい重いゲームです：[/b]
PCの能力が不安な場合は動作テストをお勧めします。

[b]キーボードとマウスを使用しました：[/b]
操作は移動、叫ぶ、ジャンプ、ローリング、物をつかむ程度。
Eキー長押しで物を投げる、というのを失念していたので途中詰まりましたが仕掛け自体はわかりやすかったです。
ギミックを解いた時、遠方の入口が開いたりするのでちゃんと注目していないと進路が分からなくなります。

暗すぎる場所は実績取得時にゲーム内設定で明るさを上げました。足元どころか遠くまで良く見えます。ゲーム性をかなり損ないますが、視力の悪い人や実績を取りたい人には必須かも。

[b]感想：[/b]
パズルやアクションより綺麗な雰囲気が目的の人にお勧めです。

Can’t really criticize much, visuals in their minimalism are superb, music is enchanting, lots to collect and explore. Only two downsides I have to mention. For one, the price tag might be a little steep in my opinion, but the game has been on sale and bundles many times at the usual places like Fanatical & Co, so it’s you’re decision what it’s worth to you.

I just finished this up and in my humble opinion it was a masterpiece of a puzzle game. For a long while I sat on the fence with this game, coming across it in various searches and reading through some of the reviews. It was something I'd wish-listed for several months. Then about a week or so ago I saw a recent review saying it could be argued the game had subtle elements of the game Inside scattered throughout it. This immediately piqued my interest as I personally view Inside as the greatest game ever made. At any rate, I Rime on sale and decided to pick it up. It's just as all the positive reviews have said: excellent puzzles, nothing too incredibly hard, absolutely gorgeous soundtrack, awesome animation and so on. Also thematically brilliant in that it borrows the concept of Elisabeth Kubler Ross's ""five stages of grief"" to great effect. But the part I perhaps liked the best was the world building throughout and that the developers managed to bring an element of exploration into the game. The world is, at times, very surreal and dark. It's true that there's a bit of an Inside-like vibe, and it also echoes the strangeness of games like ""Vane,"" for instance, although Vane was quite flawed, overall, compared to this. Rime's game mechanics are pretty tight, loading times are good, and the glitches are essentially nonexistent. As I played through this I found myself thinking at various times of so many great games: The Talos Principle, Portal, Inside, Hob, Vane and even Ori in a few spots. I didn't cry at the end but I must confess there was a bit of a lump in my throat. But...when it comes to things like death and the loss of loved ones, we have no choice but to face up to our common fate. Rime handles all of this in a very beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring way.

RiME has some performance issues for many. I dunno if it's a bad port (or if it is even a port?) or if it is just a matter of finding what works on your components.. But it can be off putting and make this worthwhile game easy to turn away from far too early on. Most of the suggested fixes in the forums are a matter of switching away from default settings (windowed full to full, triple buffering to double, SSAO to another choice, etc etc). Perhaps they shouldn't have been the default? This game is a visual masterpiece in storytelling but by all means should ""just work"". Especially on powerful systems. I mean, the frame drops I had at first couldn't even be smoothed with G-Sync on. So it's a crying(pun intended) shame it isn't optimized for a wider breadth of builds. 

Beyond performance there are some gameplay hiccups as well. For a game so wonderfully animated and with a player character full of life(pun not intended); The controls can feel lackluster. Especially jumping. You just don't get a smooth feeling while making your character move. Then like many games before it, the movement on ledges is mind numbing at times. Shimmying along a ledge and leaping to the next is an exercise in patience of trying to figure out which way the game wants you to point your thumbstick versus the camera. Also of note, there is an odd design choice with the ledge stuff where there's a needless requirement to be hanging or standing on particular ledges. Seemingly identical gaps in different parts of the game require you to transition to one or the other before you can jump. And well, jumping and ledge work are the bulk of the platforming. Some more polish for a smoother wield of the controls would've led to me being completely lost in the amazing experience that is RiME. I have no doubt I would've played it through in one sitting if the controls were smoother.

I only point out these complaints for one reason though; To say they're well worth getting over. Figure out how to make the game run smooth enough on your machine. Take a break if you're annoyed by controls. But play RiME. The visual storytelling is spectacular. To think of how I felt exploring in the beginning and discovering this new world to the way I was rocked and along for the ride by the end is wild. I love narrative experiences like this in games. I'd definitely hesitate to say that the story isn't predictable as you go along, but I still felt more than I expected to when I got there. It really is a masterpiece that I'm glad I played. And the game is indeed fun to play most of the time as well. Sure there's jumps and ledges but there is also really decent puzzles and tons of exploring on foot. Plenty of hidden collectibles of various types as well. You can get lost in the experience at times and it is amazing. 

I really enjoyed the storytelling experience that was RiME and the unique world it presented. I highly recommend it. It is worth the effort to hurdle any issues you may run into.",1634092429,1634092712,True,1,0,0.512820541858673096,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Rime no es un juego para cualquiera, aclaremos esto desde el principio. Es un juego que no requiere de habilidad casi en absoluto, sino más bien de conexión con el momento. Todo, desde el diseño de los escenarios, pasando por los efectos visuales, la música y paisaje sonoro y llegando a la historia (que tal vez no sea muy clara mientras se lo juega por primera vez, pero que cobra otro sentido, muy profundo e interrogante, una vez que se atraviesa la escena final y se vuelve a la pantalla de inicio -para esto podría incluir un Spoiler, pero siendo un juego tan breve quien decida probarlo lo va a averiguar muy pronto) exige que conectemos con el momento.

En mi caso por ejemplo, pasé los últimos tres años jugando PUBG y Rocket League. Más de  3 mil horas de juego a puro disparo, sangre, goles y explosión. Juegos muy cabeza de macho que lo mantienen a uno en constante tensión. Hace unos mese empecé a trabajar muchas más horas diarias que antes y necesitaba que el momento de sentarme a jugar fuera un momento tranquilo, para respirar, para bajar un cambio. Rime me aportó un espacio para explorar con tranquilidad y descubrir los secretos a mi propio ritmo. La canción en los labios del chico protagonista transmite la ternura que acompaña todo el diseño, aun en las etapas más oscuras del juego. Todo parece contrastar con el trajín diario de trabajo, estrés y consumo. En Rime hay un juego que no exige apuro, resultados ni maniobras que deban ser ensayadas una y otra vez. Quiero decir, Rime lo recibe a uno con un paisaje estupendo y paletas íntimas, el sonido del mar que despertará en más de uno algún que otro recuerdo, con un montón de cosas que otros juegos no brindan con este tenor, con esta afectividad. Todo lo que se puede sospechar al recorrer los escenarios se confirma cuando al terminar el juego vemos los nombres de los niveles: Rime es una historia de interioridad y ternura, de conexión con los procesos inevitables de la vida, y lo hace a través de una maravillosa historia en la que no median palabras. El lenguaje universal del llanto y la risa.

Quienes hayan jugado otras joyas como ICO o Journey puede que encuentren que ciertos apartados del juego (controles, variedad de mecánicas, complejidad de los puzzles, escalamiento de habilidades, etc...) no sean memorables ni comparables a los de sus antecesores. Después de Prince of Persia y Shadow of the Colossus queda muy poco por hacer en los platformers de escalada y merodeo. Sin embargo, Rime lo hace de manera correcta, y todo en un ambiente cautivante con un trasfondo simbólico más que interesante.

Es un juego que, por su brevedad, no debe abandonarse. Recuerdo algún momento en que, sin entender bien qué estaba pasando, casi lo dejo para jugar a otra cosa. Puede que los cuatro escenarios parezcan inconexos, o que la falta de desarrollo del personaje lo haga parecer monótono por momentos. Curiosamente, todo eso deja de importar sobre el final. Cada figura, cada retrato cobra profundo sentido en el instante final, le parte a uno el pecho y lo hace resignificar cada elemento suelto de la historia que parecía solo decorar.

色彩搭配还不错挺令人愉悦，但是优化极差，1070ti 1080p居然tm才30帧，加速之后属实卡成ppt了。

基本上毫无价值，但是我可能还是会通关看看，佛系。

------------------------------------------------------

玩到差不多一半了，还挺充实的，ce加速也不会燥了。美工被程序和设计拖后腿。

还尼玛有bug，玩着玩着不能跳了。检查点回到十年前，淦。明明死了可以原地复活。垃圾。

偶尔会出现锁定视角的场景，一般是攀岩，这时候方向键也变了。你本来是水平左爬，转了视角变成上下键，关键方向还是人物的水平左右方。真的垃圾。

所谓解谜，你看得见的谜题才叫谜题，这些谜题确实不难。看不见的谜题那叫恶意卡关找你妹。


------------------------------------------------------

通关了，真的挺充实。不仅美术设计卓越，bgm也非常恢弘，适配广阔场景。我眼光还是不错的，本作确实有通关价值。

后期谜题基本上都是前面的重复，一个套路玩无数遍。前面之所以觉得难是因为他没有任何引导，甚至你都不知道谜题在哪里。卡关了就看看视频，没啥。

开始我只是觉得配色不错，到了后面场景也挺有艺术感的，空旷但不空虚。场景多样，各具特色。最后的下雨场景直接给我fps卡到个位数（4倍加速），但是他效果确实做出来了。

前面的提过的毛病就不重复了。我一共碰到过3次bug，一次没音乐，一次不能跳，一次在高台边缘下跳卡住不能动。也不算太多吧，每次重启/读档都好了。不过这个游戏吧，借用上个评测，你感觉游戏过程每时每刻都在卡bug，他的物理就是这么烂。

充实也是真充实，有大鸟，有机器人，（这么说好像很难听懂）因为迷题不难所以场景变换比较频繁，视觉上一直都有新鲜感。这种状态维持至少3.5h（walkthrough时间），挺不容易了。

差评不改，还是不推荐玩。
















[spoiler]今天又双叒叕大跌了，这次是真的大跌了。大饼从53000跌到42000，ada直接从3跌破2。本来我有机会在2.7左右跑，没舍得，然后2.6又有机会，又没舍得，最后2.55清仓了。损失2000，比5000少，但是心态完全不一样了。之前的7000基本上是大风刮来的，现在从5000-6000属实是虎口拔牙赢来的，跌到4000也就是纯炒币的本金，还不算xch的钱。况且我也是成长了这么半个多月的，再亏这么多属实不应该。但是这次的跌幅比上次还要高得多，我也算是跑的及时，不像上次基本上底部割肉，而且后来又微操回到了4700左右（半路空了eth和sol回了小半口血，然后现货也涨回去了，最低好像是有3700了），还算进步不小了。

现在我真的开始玩现货了，长期能拿到翻几倍，短期我太菜就只能把赢了的都赔进去。正好这段时间也没什么行情，本来就应该半仓装死。

真的是无仓一身轻，这段时间玩玩游戏学学蜡烛图好好睡觉。等行情回来我再追涨杀跌闭着眼睛挣钱。

啥时候把steam评测当成日记了？还是公开的好羞耻啊...不过反正没人看

Now for the longer review:
Overall i want to give this game an 8/10
Visuals/music these 2 i would say carry the game for me solid 10/10
Story, i wont go into detail but it does definitely get a bit confusing as you play, but that did add to the enjoyment of it because i had freedom to make assumptions and guesses as to what was happening, and once i got the answers at the end i was very satisfied!
Puzzle wise its a bit lacking, so  6/10 the puzzles themselves are nice, and the concept is very fun BUT there were almost no moments of excitement when a puzzle would get solved, usually when i got stuck on a puzzle and finally would figure it out i would be annoyed not proud/happy.
Final thought, the thing that i loved a lot about the game, is the small detail of character animation. the fact that depending on where you are walking would change the walk cycle animation of the character was pure genius, down hill, in shallow water, in deeper water, up hill, all had unique animations and it was just a joy to watch! 11/10",1630895006,1630895006,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game itself is a fairly standard platformer/puzzler that wont blow anyone away in terms of mechanics, but the passable gameplay pairs well with its fairly short length and additional mechanics are added often enough to keep boredom at bay. Combined with the previously mentioned top tier sound/visual work make this a memorable and standout experience. Journey is not a masterpiece of gameplay design, but has become a significant influence in the industry through it's presentation and story telling methods. The same can be said here, though to a lesser extent perhaps. 

Performance was rocky. Played at 4K on a 3070 and had many sections exhibiting stuttering. Shame because a game this old with an assumedly light graphics implementation should not stress a modern system this much.  That said, It was so beautiful at 4K i decided to just grin and bear through the stutters, that's how hard this game leans into its presentation and how well it pays off. 

OH, and if you get it, get the soundtrack bundle, a dollar or two is a steal for this OST.

I give it a strong recommendation, with maybe a caveat that you might want to get it on sale. My initial playthru took less than 4 hours total, and that was with a little optional collectible gathering and a healthy number of fail states. This doesn't mean it's not worth the money necessarily, but you have to decide for yourself what you value. There is some decent replay value in hunting for collectibles and achievements, which seem to all be very doable if that's your thing.",1629097761,1629097761,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,False,False,False,False,,,

難点としては、暗すぎて地形が見えにくい場所が何箇所かあること。フレームレートの問題を感じる場所もあった。とはいえ全体の作りの良さに対してあまり大きな問題には感じなかった。

死を受け入れる過程がテーマになっており、ゲームの最後の最後になってこの物語の意味がわかる構造。複数の章に区切られており、プレイ時間は少し長めで5時間程度。コレクション要素や実績もあるが、あまりそこに気を取られると全体の流れが楽しめなくなるので、おまけ程度と思ったほうがいい。

Горькое послевкусие, но которое дает красивую и трогательную историю, многие к которой не останутся равнодушными.

RiME is set in a beautiful island landscape with crumbling ruins and tall towers and unfolds an emotional and bittersweet tale about a young boy's journey of discovery. The game has limited open world environments to explore by walking, running and using some elements of a 3D platformer. RiME's game play involves moving through different locations, by walking, running and often traversing sheer cliffs or walls using movements reminiscent of early Tomb Raider games such as shimmying, vaulting, pushing blocks and jumping- I usually find these actions frustrating, but they were quite easy to perform and the controls are very forgiving. The puzzles were not overly difficult and the solutions were always logical, making for a nice fluid progression through the story. The story is told through music( a very beautiful soundtrack btw), cut-scenes and drawings that are found as you move through the games locations. I needed a second play-through to get all the achievements as some are a bit obscure and can be missed as there are points of no return in some areas, that said I really did enjoy going back to search for missed items and this was simplified by the option to replay chapters once you have finished the game.",1625820108,1626857427,True,5,0,0.567611098289489746,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The end contextualises the whole game as an illusion representing the 5 stages of grief.

In this game, you control a boy who runs like a physically challenged kid, look at him from the side while running, I dare you! His special powers?

Especially since when its completed for the first time, you'll be able to select chapters and go back for the missing achievements if needed - This feature is one of the best things about the game.
Personally I had trouble looking past the very, uhm.. Special running of the kid, but if you can, I'm sure you'll connect more with the game and the story itself, but there is nothing original about it. The controls, espeically the jump, are very sluggish, but the game doesn't call for tight controls, so this doesn't effect gameplay - Again, if you can look past it.
I will say, the game is beautiful in its own way and the music is really nice, but that's just not enough for me. There are too many awesome games out there, similar style to this one, at a cheaper price point, that does it all way better.

ゲームの内容はほぼ全部が探索と謎解きからできています。
マップが非常に広大かつ複雑で、そんな中をあちこち彷徨って先に進むための手がかりを探し続けなきゃいけないのはかなり大変です。ただ、世界観がすごいというか景色がなかなか綺麗だし、マップもよく作り込まれてるというところに惹かれたのでなんとか乗り切れました。特に濡れた地面の表現なんかは何度見てもすごいですね。さすがアンリアルエンジンという感じです。逆に、マップに魅力を感じない人にはこのゲームはただの苦行かもしれないです。

あと謎解きがそんなに複雑じゃないのもいいです。2～3回迷ったところはありましたが、どれも初歩的な見落としが原因でした。進み方がわからなくなったら、辺りの床に模様とか、意味ありげな台座とか、壁や崖につかまれる場所がないかとかを探してみるといいです。壁や崖につかまってるときに操作がわからなくなったら、一旦移動キーを押すのをやめ、改めて移動したい方向のキーを押すとうまくいくようです。

で、問題はストーリーなのですが、エンディングを迎えてみると正直言って全く意味がわかりません。一応気になったので実績コンプまでしましたが（ガイドを見れば簡単にクリアできるので良かったです）、結局よくわかりませんでした。収集要素はごくごく断片的に主人公たちの背景などを仄めかしてくれる程度で、終盤で唐突に出てくるおっさんが誰なのかくらいはまあなんとなくわかったような気になります。

[spoiler]在我短短的人生里，我见过的不多...大海，灯塔，都化为我想象的幻影。曾经在梦里出现过的小狐狸和长腿风铃，来到了这个世界。
这是个荒凉孤独的世界，好像只有我一个人，虽然很美，但是不真实...我看到了那座灯塔，我突然想起来我是谁了
我是渔民家的儿子，那个红色衣服的人我慢慢知道他是我的爸爸，但是他为什么不和我相见？
我是他的王子，没错，我在一个个失落的宫殿，所有的线索好像不是线索，往前走，我越来越困惑。比如挂在我床头的纸风车，转啊转，能带来乌云。我凭我的机智战胜了凶恶的大鸟。
长腿也出现了，我把它组装好，赋予它生命，但他一刻也不停留，好像要告诉我一个真相...走啊走，悲伤笼罩了我，我看到了游荡的鬼魂，他们曾经是无言的，和我没什么关系。
突然，我看到了一个白色的鬼魂（white shadow），她的拥抱，好温暖
大水决堤而出，我不知道是泪水还是雨水
原来有这么多长腿，它们是我的卫士吗？它带我走向灯塔，走向我最不愿接受的事实....我的爸爸已经葬身大海..这是一座雨城，我在雨城中迷失了...我到达一个雕像前，最后一个长腿变成了钥匙，我哭着求它别扔下我
但是它看了我一眼，那意思是，让我走进去
虽然很想和你在一起，但是作为朋友，你必须走下去。小狐狸唤醒了我的悲伤，可是它也用尽了最后的力气，别走...
好害怕，在这倾盆大雨之下，到处都是水，没有躲藏的地方，大声喊也听不到了，啊，我变成了曾经见过的鬼魂..但是我的红围巾提醒着我，我还能行动
他们一直挡在那个宫殿前不让我进去，现在可以了，但是里面是背对着的，我和爸爸的痛苦的雕像
没有光...我隐隐约约知道我的任务了，我和小狐狸和长腿一样，我要安慰一个人...那是熟悉的房间，一个人极端痛苦的姿势，变成了石头
别伤心啦！我轻轻在他耳边说，我要走了，送我最后一程吧
再次睁开眼，我看到的是无边的，宁静的星空，好像是灵魂最后的归宿。我唱起了歌，跳了进去。

denial 
他一定是飘到了岛上，那里不缺水，不缺食物，我只要去找一定能找回他.....

别骗自己了，他掉进海里的时候那么害怕，你这个父亲真是该死，他无疑是带着恐惧死去的
bargaining
他到了天国，可以永远不用长大，永远被守护
depression
别做梦了，你永远失去你的儿子了...从今以后你孤零零的，像个鬼魂
acceptance
他一定回来了，我又一次在凳子上深深自责的时候，熟悉的声音对我告别，他变得那么勇敢，温暖地看着我。我知道他住在星星上，那么那红布我还留着吗，那已经不是唯一的纪念，留着徒增伤心，我把它放飞在风中，

I went into this game expecting a fun puzzle game to play since I was bored and didn't have anything better to do. This game absolutely blew my expectations out of the water. 

The story in this game is amazing. It builds up slowly but the end is worth all of it and then some. (I actually cried at the end...)

If you are looking for an amazing game and you enjoy puzzles or if you just want a good story, then I cannot recommend this game enough.

In the background you can see a ruined tower at a cliff. After climbing up a cliff the boy notices in the far distance another tower. One that is gigantic, intact and having a keyhole like shape on the upper floor. The scenery is gorgeous. Everything looks like it is hand painted. It is a pleasant art style, not trying to be photo realistic but rather to convey being in a very artistic hand painted world. Furthermore there is a day and night cycle which nicely wraps the landscape in different tones, where the night is as atmospheric as the day.
Melodic compositions accompany the boy on his journey through this island and the tower. 

Not a single word is said to convey any goals or the story (besides some shouts of the boy). Therefor one could wonder how the game can tell its story and guide the player throughout the journey. Bits of the story are mostly told by mural paintings, secret keyholes (which show a picture regarding the boys past) and a few cutscenes between the chapters. You are never clueless about what it is you have to do next, even though the game is not stringently holding the players hand. The puzzles are not that challenging but more than often you are surprised by how interesting the mechanics are. In general I would say that the gameplay itself is very chill. The boy has the power to interact with certain objects with is voice. He can reignite torches, break specific vases and activate certain statues, all with a shout of his. Besides chapter 2, which brings an element of danger until right before the end of the chapter, you can almost always take your time exploring (chapter 3 had some areas you could not access after leaving them, so there is that as well). And even the element of danger in chapter 2 is rather there to be kind of a puzzle to be solved.
In some instances exploring was very rewarding, for example when you see a place in a distance not being accessible at first but when you examine the surrounding area you could find a way to get there and eventually find more collectables or achievements. I like that design philosophy.

What I really liked about the end is that the developers made it to tell a story and not have a love, peace and harmony ending (so be warned, if that’s what you always have to want!).
It was very touching and after having unlocked the chapter selection, the meaning of the chapters became more apparent in regards to the actual story. I love it.

For those achievement hunters: There is a chapter select after finishing the game, so there is nothing you can really miss. I was peeking in an achievement guide from time to time after the first chapter to make sure I did not miss anything though. Some achievements are indeed hidden, but if you get them on your own, just by exploring the world, you’ll feel awesome. I’d say play the game mostly without a guide (or like me peeking there from time to time) and enjoy the game. Afterwards you can always replay chapters.

To wrap it all up: 
Rime is not on the lengthy side. It took me around 8 and a half hour, with getting almost all achievements and looking in an achievement guide in between. Even though a bit short, I would definitely say Rime is worth its money delivering a unique adventure with a hand painted look, a great musical score and in general a chill game.",1622399669,1622399669,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It focuses a lot more in art than anything else, so expect simple game mechanics.

Summary:
+ Good Disney like art style.
+ Easy to control.
+ Very calm game. Good to kill time.
- Too slow, should be faster.
- Puzzle are too easy.
- Short game, with big levels, instead of big game with short levels.
- No real replayability. It sums up to getting all items. It's pointless.

You control a kid that looks like a Mexican ancient roman that solves most of his problems with impressive physical ability and by screaming at objects. You can pretty much climb anything, push big stone statues, grab heavy metal spheres and swim for many seconds underwater. Very impressive but he is a kid so he can't jump very high. For some reason screaming at monkey statues, vases, torches, and so on, activates them. Makes no sense, and all that screaming can get annoying, but you just have to do it.

The main selling point is the art style. It's kind of like a classic Disney style and works well, though it could have more shading. There are different themes in each stage, so there is art variety (e.g., water stage, ruins stage). This does make the game a lot more interesting and essential for these kinds of games. The story was designed to fit the art style, meaning the kid is always happy, smiling and tagging along with friends he finds along the way. Kind of nauseating, but as you'll eventually find out, not all is what it seems. The music is nothing to brag about. It's not bad, not good, sometimes annoying and not memorable at all. This is one area the developer could have invested more.

In my opinion there are some obvious issues with the game. It's a very slow game were you spend most of your time running instead of solving puzzles. It's not as bad as it should be because at least you can enjoy the art style, but it could be a faster game. The puzzles are too basic and sometimes it's hard to understand what you're supposed to do. It should be the opposite, easy to understand, but hard to solve. You do have hints if you're lost, in particular a fox helps. By the way, someone should tell the developers that red foxes don't bark like dogs. Either way these two flaws can be off putting to a lot of people. The game does start boring, but gets better over time. It's also a short game, with big levels. Instead it should be a big game with shorter levels. But I guess the main focus was always art.

So it's a slow game with pretty graphics and basic puzzles. It's good to help sleep for sure, not that that's bad. It's a calm game and doesn't really require much skill. It's a good game if you like art and have patience.",1621120096,1621707835,True,0,0,0.491611391305923462,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Right from the start, explorers are told to bugger off to another game, as there is no free saving. Devs show who is boss; unless they show who is insecure control-freak of the lazy one slot. Still claim it's open world though.
All right, no exploration then... I'll still give it a chance.

More faux freedom: you have control over the camera... except that devs keep taking it away from you, time and time again. This will be a recurring annoyance until the very end.

Considering that the gameplay is rather dull, and that the art isn't much to look art, I trod along with a growing itch to uninstall. It's not bad, it's simply not engrossing.

Fortunately, chapter 2 comes along and slowly wins me over. There is now a story, an objective, animation on the map. Plus, I like the design of the bird, of the ghosts, of the scenery, of the sea... I'm enjoying my time here.

The next chapter is rather dull again. The following one super-dull under the rain. And the epilogue is one of these railroads that never want to end, a cutscene that keeps begging for your pointless input, as if that would earn it some gravitas.

This might work but of course it was developed for consoles, and as we know, consoles make gaming worse for everyone, and Rime is no exception.  The console port is pretty bad here, you can tell the game was designed for console peasant childrens toy gamepads, and KB+M was an afterthought.  For example, ""Shift"" makes you roll, not run.  Presumably the guys at Tequila Works got their name for a reason, and also, they never saw a PC with a keyboard before.  The sure as hell never played a PC game before, or they wouldn't bind ""Shift"" to ""roll"". 

The same console peasant centric design is followed along with completely gamer-hostile camera controls.  The camera is wonky as all hell, and the developers break one of the core rules of game development... [b]NEVER[/b] seize control of the camera from the player.  Except of course, the guys at Tequila Works drunkenly decided players love having the camera yanked off the player.   Well, we don't.  Maybe console peasants like that kind of thing. 

On a technical basis, 4K works, but only in Fullscreen mode.  You can't go that high if you like borderless window, because they either didn't bother testing on PC (a plausible scenario given how bad the controls are), or they just didn't see the sense in making it work properly in 4K because console peasant appliances usually don't go that high.  Also, the graphics are really low poly, again this is because consoles can't render PC tier graphics properly so compromises get made to make the best out of a bad platform.   Told you consoles make gaming worse for everyone.

Anyway, this is basically what might have been an okay game, but it's console ported trash with PC as an afterthought.  Also, it's stupidly overpriced for such a poorly done port.  $40 would get you a game developed for PC, with KB+M working smoothly, proper UHD support, and proper graphics.

Покажите мне того бездушного человека, который не прольет ни одной слезинки на последней главе этой прекрасной игры.

Игра ""максимально минимализирована"" - в ней нет реплик, одни эмоции, подкрепленные отличным душевным саундтреком.

Многое осталось непонятно, например лично для меня - связь основной истории героя и черных духов или же милых двуногих голов. За 8,9 часов(по факту где-то +- 7 часов, с расчетом пауз и нахождением в афк) я прошел основной сюжет без исследований скрытых мест, так что мне еще предстоит прошерстить каждую главу, чтобы найти оставшиеся части коллекционных предметов, после чего надеюсь получить ответы на вышесказанное.

Игру однозначно советую. К концу, имея опыт прохождения подобных сюжетов, понимаешь что к чему, но как и везде есть свое дополнение твоей теории и здесь это не исключение. Эмоции переполняют.

Rime 是一款以冒险探索来推动剧情的休闲解谜游戏。


[h1]【简评：为太长不看的玩家而准备，评分以优良中差辅以加减，满分为完美】[/h1]

[b]--画面：优。[/b] 虽然是老游戏了，但是画面依然绚丽，且有的场景非常宏大。画面风格和另一款PS上的解谜佳作《ICO》很像，建模非常可爱。但是PC版存在优化问题，在某些场景会有掉帧。

[b]--声音：优+。[/b] 游戏角色没有一句台词，但是音效真实而优秀，音乐更是电影大片级别的，两个字形容就是完美。配乐时而优美，时而宏大，时而紧张，时而悲伤，并且和游戏场景极度契合。这里强烈推荐入手OST。

[b]--剧情：优。[/b] 剧情开始让玩家带着一肚子问题去探索，在每章之间会有动画叙述剧情，并且最后来了个大反转，留下一个悲伤而美丽的结尾。总体感觉尚可，特别是最后很煽情，但是剧情有点过于简单却隐晦，并且少了点曲折而张力不够。最后游戏流程长度还不错（8小时左右）。

[b]--可玩性：优。[/b] 游戏冒险探索部分做的不错，地图设计比较巧妙，并有很多隐秘的收藏品和成就等待玩家发掘。但是解谜部分都是一些光影谜题、声音谜题、推箱子和找东西这些玩家见过无数次的解谜，并且难度偏低，缺乏挑战性。不过这也反倒适合那些不太擅长解谜的休闲玩家游玩。

[b]总结：优（85分）。[/b] 本作是一款冒险探索性较强的休闲解谜游戏，并且由于解谜较简单。推荐给所有休闲型玩家和解谜型玩家，记得打折时连带OST一起购买。


【结语】
本作不论从媒体评分还是玩家评论来看都是两极分化较大的一作。我在这里老生重谈下，适合你的游戏并不是光看评分或者评论的，只有你自己上手玩过后才能知道好坏。当时入手本作前我也犹豫过，不过最终还是被本作音画吸引才决定入手。后来整体玩下来我个人是觉得非常不错的，很适合休闲放松。

Rime has a cartoon-like art style and I think it looks very nice. The art style gives it a nice relaxing feel, yet the game
can still give off a multitude of feelings and emotions. In my opinion the art style also works because the main character
you play as is a child

Rimes soundtrack is nothing really to speak of. The soundtrack does fit well with the game but it does not stand out on it's own.

Since there is no dialogue the only interesting characters to me were the fox (because the fox was super cute) and the sentinels
because they had a cool design. however the game doesnt dive too far into either.

There are two main gameplay elements; puzzles and platforming. The puzzles aren't to difficult, you might get stuck for a minute
or so but then it's easy to figure out. Thats not a ding against a game unless it tries to be difficult. This game isn't trying to
stump you. I feel like the puzzles here are just to add variety of gameplay and it works fine. Thecontrol for the platofmrer could 
be better, sometimes i feel like I am not jumping where i thought I'd be. Thankfully the game isn't a percision platformer so some loose
controls doesn't harm the gameplay.

I liked the overall feels of the game and I really enjoyed the ending scene. 

I didn't like that the game doesn't change over the 10ish hours it took me to beat. The puzzles don't get harder nor does the platforming become harder or different.
As a result the gameplay can get boring as you get closer to the end of the game. 

Overall the game is a fine game. It doesn't push the envelope or attempt to do something new. It does what it tries to do and I can't blame it for that.

・雰囲気がものすごく秀逸。見た目に惹かれた人はほぼ買って間違いないと思います
・テーマ、ビジュアル、それらの表現手法はまるでお手本のような出来です
・リズムのない音楽が全体にマッチしています。ほしねこが普段好んで聴かないジャンルの音楽ですが、ゲームが総合芸術であることを改めて痛感させてくれました

しかるところ
・明るいマップは最初のうちだけです…（ほしねこは明るい場所の探索が大好きなので少し残念）
・クラッシュが特定条件で起こります。また、クラッシュ時にゲームの旧称を見ることになります
・意外とシンプルな作りをしていて、不慮の事故でグリッチしてしまった時などはリセットが必要かもしれません（私は出くわしてしまいトラウマでした。その箇所は限られていますが…バグ等には必要以上に興味を持たず、そっとリセットしましょう）
・ややザル気味の視覚パズルや、もっさり動作と物理演算で、詰まるとき、詰まる人はとことん詰まります。クリアまでの概算時間はよほど自信がないかぎり長めにとって、ゆっくりプレイしましょう。
・ちょっとストーリー的にもゲーム内容的にも主人公がかわいそうな気持ちになります…（悲劇を求める方はOKでしょう）
・全体的に暗喩的で象徴的なビジュアルで展開していくのに対し、操作の難などで時々没入感が失われる気がします
・鳥

RiMe is a par game that makes a lot more sense after you reach the ending. If you haven't already played Ico, Journey, or The Last Guardian, prioritize those over this one.

This game feels very much like a mash up of Fumito Ueda playstation games (mostly Ico 2001), and Journey 2012. It has the speechless protagonist of Ico, the green glowing objects of The Last Guardian, and a musical score reminiscent of Journey.

Unfortunately the only new ground RiMe strikes is at the very end in how it explains (loosely) the world of the game. It feels very much like a fan made Ico, and while that is not a problem if it had been of equal quality, it largely felt derivative and less polished mechanically. The soundtrack for RiMe is incessantly performing the background in a way that felt like the game feared allowing the player to soak in the atmosphere without constant musical mood setting. Introspection is firmly replaced by an unrelenting (albeit nice) string orchestra. The sound that defines Fumito Ueda games is silence, and this game has none of that to offer.

+ Динамическая смена времени суток, чтобы понаснимать красивых скриншотиков.
+ Несколько душевных музыкальных композиций.
 
~ Различные задачки на продвижение, хоть и разбавляются между собой, но по-детски легки - на второе прохождение игра не тянет (кроме сбора предметов на ачивки).
 
- Тех-огрехи - средненькая оптимизация и вылеты при выходе в главное меню.
- Неотзывчивое управление - чтобы прицельно прыгнуть с уступа, надо сначала всё отжать, а затем уже целиться.
- История совершенно не запоминается, такое много раз было в других играх (узнай, что [spoiler]ты мёртв![/spoiler]).
- Худшая, на моей памяти, альтернативная концовка по уровню исполнения (дорисовали одну модельку для одного кадра!).

Ну это если коротко. Далее рассмотрим поподробнее.
Rime - это в первую очередь головоломка. И головоломка отличная, загадки радуют своей новизной, необычностью, бессомненно, логичностью и умеренной сложностью. Решать их интересно, однако долго.
Примерно в длине и заключается главная проблема проекта. Слишком большие локации, слишком долгий путь, слишком много беготни. Разработчики хотели сделать огромный открытый мир - они его сделали, наполнили,  добавили головоломок, однако он так и остался большим. На фоне всех огромных руин чувствуешь себя маленькой песчинкой в часах. И это просто скучно, когда от головоломки к головоломке бежишь 10 минут, они раскиданы по разным частям карты. К финалу у меня в этом плане отдельная претензия. Это ж надо было додуматься настолько далеко расставить эти столбы и попросить их зажигать в определённом порядке. Ох как я бесился, прям жесть.
Ну и к хорошему. Здесь хорошая, угловатая, но приятная глазу графика, не надоедающее, подстраивающееся под текущую игровую ситуацию музыкальное сопровождение и в целом хорошие эффекты, достойные внимания.
От меня 6/10 - типичный пример излишнего растягивания отличной игры-головоломки. Поиграть можно, но главное - набраться терпения.

Il m'a beaucoup rappelé Journey sur certains points sans en être une pâle copie comme des sites de jeux videos l'indiquent...
J'ai trouvé les paysages fabuleux et les puzzles relaxants.

Scénario: Vous incarnez un petit garçon qui se réveille sur une plage d'une ile mystérieuse, celle là même qui est présente sur la jaquette du jeu.
La magie est omniprésente et rend le jeu totalement imprévisible tout comme l'histoire.
En clair on ne sait pas trop ou l'on veut nous emmener mais comme les paysages sont sublimes, on est loin de se forcer à continuer.

Graphismes: Identiques à ceux de Journey, ils permettent au jeu d'instaurer une atmosphére et une ambiance trés particuliére. Apaisant, le jeu peut aussi prendre une tournure plus noire à certains passages, le tout grâce à un effet de lumiére et de textures semblables aux derniers dessins animés.

Difficulté: Il n'y en a pas. La résolution des puzzles pourra prendre plus ou moins de temps selon votre sens de la logique.

Durée de vie: 7 heures pour l'histoire principale. Le double pour finir le jeu à 100% et débloquer les succés.

Prix: Moins de 10 euros en soldes. Correct.

En résumé, ce jeu a emprunté les grandes lignes de Journey sans en être une pâle copie. Il est différent de par son histoire car il y a bien une histoire et une conclusion qui permet de donner un véritable sens au périple du garçon. Une note touchante d'ailleurs.
Je conseil.

Play as a young boy who finds himself washed up on shore of a mysterious island. With the help of a mysterious fox he must explore the island and learn the mysteries of where he is and why he is there.

Graphics/Art Style: I really like the art style in RiME. It really holds up well considering the game is over 3 years old. Characters have a somewhat unique look to them, and the environment is absolutely gorgeous. From the starting beach all the way to the end of the game, every environment you encounter is breathtakingly beautiful. Detailed landscapes inspire a sense of wonder and awe, dark ominous areas instill a sense of dread, and ancient abandoned buildings make you wonder where you are and what happened in the ancient civilization that existed long ago.

Audio/Music: The music in RiME is exceptional. It is a great mix of insightful, somber and tranquil. I added the soundtrack it to my spotify playlist immediately after finishing the game.

Controls: RiME controls fairly well. My only complaint is that the character seems to lock on to some ledges very strongly, which can lead to you falling to your death when trying to jump somewhere else. I only had one or two deaths that I attributed to the controls, which is acceptable.

Gameplay/Difficulty: The puzzles of RiME are fairly simplistic. I like this, as overly complex puzzles could easily detract from the story, which is the main highlight of this game. Although they are simplistic, there is a lot of variety, and none of the various mechanics are overused at any point of the game.

Replayability: Sadly there is little replayability in RiME. Unless you missed some collectables and want to go back and find them later, once you beat the game you will be more or less done.

Writing/Story: The story of RiME is where this game truly shines. Unfortunately, due to spoilers I can’t say much about it, but what I will say is that I haven’t been this emotionally invested in a puzzle game for a long time.

Length/Price/Value: I was able to beat RiME in 5.3 hours, and I collected roughly half of the collectable items in the game. Purchased for $10.59, totaling roughly $2 an hour. While this a little spendy, I still enjoyed the game quite a bit.

Recommendation: RiME is a great game for those who like a good story quality mixed into their puzzle game. I enjoyed it a lot, although some may want to wait for it to go on sale before buying.",1606165740,1606165773,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Similar to INSIDE in that regard, but that's where the similarities end.

You play (mostly) as a young ""boy"" (in quotes because i found it ambiguous) and get to follow a fox around that shows you where you need to go for most of the game.  Simple concept, and its shown in beautiful cell shaded style.

But it gets much deeper than that.  Who is this mysterious cloaked individual?  What are these creatures?  What is this world?  Many questions will arise in the course of playing the game, and most will be answered, but, like all good games,. some is left to interpretation.

Much like To The Moon, If I explained what makes this game so good and wonderful to play, I would have to give away what makes it so good in the first place.  Go in blind, and understand that things are not always as they seem.

Pros:
-Absolutely amazing and brilliantly crafted visuals from start to finish
-Great soundtrack, definitely worth a listen to
-a good story with a twist, open to interpretation
-You can play with the fox!
-You can light things with your voice!
-Experimentation is encouraged, as you can't truly ""die""
-Exploration is heavily encouraged, especially if you want to find and collect everything
-its very hard to get truly lost, as every time you do or can, the fox comes along to save the day and show you where to go to proceed

Cons:
-Ultra settings will require something akin to a gamer PC or laptop
-Controls can be a bit finniky at times, sometimes they can mess up and require a restart of the game to fix
-Forced camera parts while you're running on thin pathways can be very annoying

I highly recommend this game if you want a fun little adventure with as touching story and absolutely amazing visuals.  I cannot stress that enough, this game is gorgeous from start to finish, and only gets better.

If you're looking for a mindless game where all you do is kill people and get points for it, this isn't for you.

This is a prime example of a game being art with a deeper message that can and does take everything you know and shine a new perspective on it.  Much like Superliminal does.

RiME is a gorgeous game with compelling music and visuals.  Each environment, each creature, each towering structure is so beautifully crafted.  The areas feel unique, the scenery is stunning.  Unfortunately, this is all that RiME really brings to the table.  Personally, I could not find the fun in this game.  The puzzles were dull (but pretty!), the platforming was stiff, the walk speed was much too slow, and the story felt disappointingly ordinary.  

Looking at the screenshots on the store page gives the feeling of such grand, expansive environments.  ""Adventure"" and ""Exploration"" are two of the top tags describing RiME.  One could certainly be led to believe this game is full of sprawling stories, diverse places, and lots of content.  This is not the case.  RiME is a linear game.  The environments are giant, but they're also empty.  The only thing earned by exploring them is the occasional collectible.  Some of the areas are designed in ways that are confusing, forcing the player to backtrack large distances or redo long climbs.  I feel there was more of a focus on aesthetics than good level design.  This, plus the lack of any maps, means there's a huge potential to get lost while looking for the one place the game wants you to go.  

Navigating the vastness of RiME is not fun.  The run speed is slow while the climbing is clunky and stiff.  I don't feel compelled to search the lands for secrets when it takes so long to get around.  There's no sprint button.  There's a roll, but it's slow and seems useless.  Jumping while running removes your momentum.  For me, a game with long walks needs something to keep my attention along the way-- whether that's combat or environmental hazards or just a button I can press to make me feel like I'm going faster.  

RiME could be called relaxing, but it could just as easily be called boring.  The puzzles are bland.  Don't get me wrong, they feature very strong and creative imagery that feels satisfying to watch unfold.  They are still very bland, though.  The solutions are simple, the same mechanics are repeated throughout the game with little variation or complications.  There's no challenge to them whatsoever.  

In terms of value, I think RiME is overpriced.  One playthrough-- wherein which I got lost several times-- took only 5 hours.  The rest of my playtime was spent getting the achievements I had missed.  Five hours of content-- regardless of how scenic it was-- should be cheaper than $30.  

Overall, I am disappointed by RiME.  I enjoyed the visuals, the symbolism, the breathtaking music, but I did not enjoy the game.  For me, it just wasn't very fun.  If there was more to the puzzles, more to the lore, more fluidity towards the platforming elements, then I would be more inclined to recommend it.  Otherwise, if you're still interested, I'd recommend you only consider buying it on sale.",1605579638,1605579649,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

S příběhem, který po dlouhou dobu je pouze v náznacích nebo vyprávěn v metaforách, které se ke konci vyjasní.

Pokud hledáte akci tak tu zde prakticky nenajdete. Celá hru tvoří především hledání cesty a řešení hádanek, které mohou potrápit ale to spíš v záludnosti, kdy jsi nejste jisti zda máte vše potřebné nebo se máte vydat do nebezpečné oblasti aby jste nalezli chybějící dílek.

Celou horu vás bude provázet průvodce v podobě lišky. Žádné velké šipky svítící kam máte jít s GPS na mapě ani seznam úkolů. Musíte sami přijít nato co dělat a kam se vydat. Naštěstí většinou k místu kam máte jít vám pomůže liška nebo když zvednete hlavu vzhůru uvidíte paprskové světlo, které se tyčí k nebesům. Celý tento mechanismus by mě naprosto uchvátil kdyby neměl pár vad. Po tom co vás liška dovede k pomyslnému cíli se vypaří a nelze ji nijak vyvolat nazpět. To by se hodilo především v situacích kdy prozkoumáváte lokaci a najednou se ztratíte nebo spíš zapomenete, kam jste měli jít a žádné světlo vás na nebi zrovna v tuhle chvíli nenavádí. Jelikož hra ukrývá i příběhové předměty, které můžete najít jen tím že budete opravdu pečlivě prohledávat lokaci mě absence znovu uvedení na správnou cestu dosti flustrovalo a hledání předmětů jsem zanechal.

Bohužel více o hře nemohu prozradit jelikož prakticky každý krok je silně spojen s příběhem (a jeho abstrakcí). Hádanky bývají většinou dobře vizuálně zpracované a mozkové závity se vám přitíží i když občas k tomu není daleko.

Podle achievementů a hledání na netu jsem zjistil že hra vám nabídne pár alternativních průchodů či alternativní konec. Neděste se tyto rozdíly jsou minimální mohl bych je přirovnat k triviálnímu příkladu. Ve verzi A jde hrdina z leva ve verzi B jde hrdina z prava ale nepřátele stále porazíte a konec je prakticky stejný.

Velkým zklamáním byl ale akrobatický mechanismus. Jelikož ve hře stále někam leze te, šplháte a tak dále. Je velmi udivující proč tento mechanismus nedostal více péče. Většinou se zaseknete protože hrdina se nechce odlepit od zdi aby jste mohli přeskočit nebo lezete po sloupu stále dokola protože jen jedna pozice se stisknutí šipek ve správnou chvíli v nelogickém směru vám umožní přeskočit. Jelikož hra je opravdu zaměřena na odpočinek a příběh nedávám tomu velkou váhu. Jelikož po každém pádu se objevíte prakticky na stejném místě odkud jste skočili.

Pokud bych měl hru přirovnat k něčemu jinému zvolil bych Princ of Persia (2008) a Ori. Ovšem bez jakékoliv akční scény spíš jejich zenová verze

- Speaking of, the game play involves jumping from ledge to ledge and climbing stuff or grabbing items in order to open doors to get to the next area.  It's pretty loose in terms of direction and you can tell your helper to sod off and explore all you want per area, jumping recklessly into pits or throwing yourself at rocks to find hidden paths.

- Each chapter is unique and provides different challenges and enemies, however most of the puzzles revolve around the 'push box, get key for door, jump and cling to ledges' formula.  Once you beat the game, you can access each chapter individually.

- The graphics are pretty and the camera is very well balanced.  I normally die of motion sickness in games, and fully expected to here, but the worst I had it was in the underwater levels, and it wasn't that bad at all.  Took a ginger pill and I was fine for hours.  Turn up brightness for the darker levels if needed.

- Music?  Music's pretty and atmospheric.  

- There's a fox!  Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!

- You pet the fox!  AND hug it!  (Once, anyway)

- There are many inventive achievements to get and trinkets to collect that unlock all sorts of fun stuff like outfits.

- On the very last scene the camera was a bit laggy, like my processor could barely withstand the experience.  And this is a beefy comp.  If you experience this issue, try turning VSync off.  I also fabulously went out of my way to glitch the fox so he's invisible for cut scenes and the pigs so they were stuck in walls.  Tried really hard to get the boy stuck on multiple occasions, almost succeeded once, but he's good at getting free (better than his animal friends).  So the game isn't glitch proof.  Not that any of those glitched killed the adventure for me.

The cute, colourful and bright art style is right up my alley. It's so pleasant to look at, I sometimes stood on a cliff just to see how the landscape changed as the day became night.

I didn't like the music, as I found it too same-y, but I didn't hate it either.

The gameplay is decent enough. The puzzles are very easy, but that's okay because the game is pretty clearly meant to be relaxing and sentimental. Wish the kid were a little faster, but again, adequate.

Now. The story.

I'm sorry to say the story is where it lost me.

First of all, we don't spend enough time with the characters to develop a strong emotional attachment to them. Like, at some point a ""character"" we have sort of been solving puzzles with for less than a hour disappears, and the kid throws himself to the ground wailing in despair. And I'm kinda feeling, well, that was unfortunate, but I'm not exactly feeling like crying here. Sir, I hardly know you.

The goals are also too vague and unclear. You move forward because it's a game and you are supposed to move forward, but there is no real sense of *why*. It's a desert island, it's not like you are going to get back to civilization by diving into underground caves. In fact, given that the first stages are like a beautiful paradise with plenty of food and the chance to be spotted by passing ships, while the later stages are creepy and dangerous and hidden away, story-wise it would make more sense for the kid to remain where he is and build a shelter.

Of course, in the end this logic is meaningless, because...

[SPOILERS]

...the story turns out to be a metaphor/dream.

Unfortunately, that still fails to move me. Partly because by the time of the Reveal I've already been moving forward for no given reason for 4 stages, so it feels a little too late. Partly because, well...

I didn't know why so many indie developers are obsessed with loss. If you are playing an artistic indie game, it's a pretty safe bet that the story is about death, either your own or a loved one's. It's so widespread that it turned what is supposed to be an emotional journey into *routine*. I'm sorry, but at this point I consider it an unexpected plot-twist if they don't die/aren't Dead all Along.

Given how predictable that theme is, a game that follows it has to do something really special to shine. For example, LIMBO has very creative puzzles and a 100% unique presentation.

Nothing RiME does feels special enough. It's an above average game, but not a great one, so it can't overcome the burden of ""I've already seen this trope many, many times"".",1605313410,1605313410,False,11,2,0.477034538984298706,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Попробую сам для себя зафиксировать как так вышло:

Плюсы:
- Красоты [средиземноморские пейзажи с морэм и кипарисами, какие то Крито-микенские развалины... ох не даром они мне напомнили Бёклинский ""Остров мертвых""... ]
- Анимация [RiME в движении выглядит просто шикарно, статичная картинка этого не передаёт]
- Некоторая свобода передвижения в условиях больших открытых пространств [даёт ощущение свежайшего саноторно-курортного раздолья]
- Очень тонкий и очень правильный баланс между элементами игрового процесса [не от одного из них я не устал, один сменял другого крайне вовремя и незаметно]
- Полнейшая бессловесность [многие игродеятели не могут рассказать сюжет / донести свою мысль используя такие костыли как валяющиеся записки, а тут: Ни одной буквочки! Ни одной «мэйд ин…» и всё работает] 
- Сценарий [Крайне успешную шутку со мной провернули сценаристы и как раз в тот момент, когда я уже стал терять терпение и всё шибче мучился вопросами что это за Каштанка? что тут вообще происходит? может я что то пропустил? Мне пояснили и за каштанку и за всю обстановку]
- Музыка [местами хорошо даёт виолончель]
- Краснянский привет от Эейзенштейна присутствует [хотя казалось бы, как говорил Янукович: Остановитесь!!! ну действительно, сколько можно уже?]
- Чуть не забыл! Множество милейших находок: мурлыканье песен, крики на огонь с целью распалить его и др.

Минусы:
- Местами провисает FPS [не туда глянул, ён родной падает, посмотрел куда положено и всё опять хорошо, 8Gb видеопамяти не спасает...]
- Периодически композитор выдает голливудовщину [особливо под конец, такой метод воздействия мне не понравился и передать желаемую эмоцию можно было бы эффективней каким то давящим эмбиентом]

Конечно берём!
И мало того, нам нужен и RiME 2, а вот на третьем RiME`е уже можно и остановиться [четвёртому, как известно не бывать!]

A mysterious watcher and an enigmatic animal guide fill out the familiar, comfortable tropes.

Even early on, RiME begins hinting to the experienced gamer that not everything here is the well-trod ground it appears to be.  Something deeper and more consequential is being built up. RiME is good at keeping its cards close to its chest, however.   Recognition that there is some kind of metaphor in play comes early, but full realisation is held off at length.

+ The performance! It was a nightmare. I have a good PC that runs every game that came out this far but it's just horrible with this game. It keeps dropping frames, sometimes between 5-12! 
+ The puzzles. Although they're often fun, they can also get boring. It really depends if you're the type to enjoy repetitive tasks or not. 
+ You can feel at loss at first without knowing what to do. But once you get the pattern it gets easy.

感觉如果有过关于周围的人的死亡体验的话，对结局可能会更有感触一些。最后少年跃下平台投入星空的时候忍不住落泪，而被留下来的人的从痛苦到释怀，是一个相当漫长的过程。是自己的过错与否，又或者仅仅只是自然的法则，别离给人带来的创口只能在时间中缓慢愈合。死亡永远是人类无法战胜的议题，是终将要面对的结局，无论你我，还是身边的某人。

Когда-то здесь жили люди. Процветала цивилизация. Но теперь не слышно ни человеческого шага, ни голоса. Лишь крики чаек между скал, да возня ящериц в траве. Где возвышались дворцы теперь ветер шумит в развалинах. Остовы атриумов, храмов, форумов - словно выбеленные временем кости. Голубое небо сияет сквозь трещины стен. Нигде лазурь небес не бывает такой вечно юной и радостной, как в щелях полуразрушенных зданий. Днём солнце мягко просвечивает сквозь дымку облаков, и даже тени становятся нежными, тёплыми. Вечером сумеречные шорохи ещё больше углубляют тишину. Кажется что здесь, в торжественном и чудном запустении остановилось течение времени. Когда закат угасает, древние камни видятся призрачно легкими, нереальными. Одинокая бледная башня в серебряном сиянии луны становится ещё прекраснее. Игрок с тихою улыбкою изучает волшебный остров, забыв свои горести, ничего не зная и ни о чём не думая. Счастливый как ребёнок.
 
И ведёт нас вперёд мальчишка, которого капризное море сначала заграбастало, а потом разочарованно выбросило на необитаемый остров. Аниматоры приложили огромные усилия, чтобы через движения раскрыть его характер. Обошлись без захвата движения, рисовали от руки. Одну только анимацию бега переделывали 6 раз, чтобы уловить особую ребяческую разболтанность. Он с нажимом поднимается в гору. Испуганно притормаживает, спускаясь по склону. Подбирает ноги, чтобы ядром шлёпнуться в воду. Днём утирает пот со лба. Ночью ёжится от холода. С бестолковой задумчивостью глазеет по сторонам. Он из тех детей, которым родители вечно говорят: «Не крутись!» Не научился ещё в своём возрасте ценить тишину и спокойствие. Герой всё делает слегка преувеличенно и немного комично, превосходно телеграфируя игроку свои намерения. А чтобы мы никогда не теряли его из виду художники подарили ему яркий красный плащ.

Даже не идея игры, а потребность в ней родилась из предыдущей работы мадридской студии Tequila Works – ужастика Deadlight. Его гнетущая атмосфера урбанистического гниения до того вымотала всю команду, что они дружно потянулись от тьмы к свету. Захотели сделать игру, где свет будет пронизывать всё вокруг. И это будет не простой свет, а полные жизни брызги солнца, запечатлённые на картинах испанского импрессиониста Хоакина Сорольи. Не обошлось и без влияния мультфильмов Хаяо Миядзаки. Не только его лесных историй, но и меланхоличного «Порко Россо» с его крохотными островками, зачарованными лагунами и волшебными пейзажами Адриатики. Художники решили воплотить на экране всю красоту средиземноморского побережья. 

Оставалось два вопроса – про что будет игра и как она будет играться? Первые концепции следовали популярным трендам. Героем назначили могучего воина по прозвищу «Спартанец». Днём он охотился, собирал припасы и ресурсы. Ночью отбивался от монстров и хищников. Остров планировался, как большая, открытая песочница, арена выживания. Однако, все эти деловитые, практичные идеи были отправлены в утиль. В глубине души разработчики всегда считали настоящим протагонистом свой удивительный остров со странной белой башней в центре. Вокруг него они построили повествование. Игрок знает, что не принадлежит этому таинственному месту, но его подстёгивают детские энтузиазм и любопытство. 

Поэтому он начинает исследовать. Наш мальчишка умеет бегать, прыгать, плавать, нырять, карабкаться, хватать, поднимать, бросать, толкать. Идеальный исследователь. В игре нет интерфейса, почти нет инструкций. Понимание происходящего приходит само собой. Остров наполняют головоломки. Они пытаются не сходить с тонкой линии между раздражающей сложностью и утомительной простотой. Порой неуклюже заваливаются в сторону откровенной скуки. Порой восхищают недюжинным остроумием. Например, загадки с перспективой. Взгляните на вещь под другим углом, и она преобразится. Далекое станет близким, большое - маленьким, откроются новые двери, появятся новые возможности. Если веришь, что что-то видишь, оно становится реальностью. Замечательная детская логика.
 
В начале открытые пространства создают иллюзию свободы, но вскоре она рассеивается. Как человек взрослея сужает бесконечные вероятности жизни до узкой колеи, так и игра выходит на сюжетную и игровую тропинку. А ведёт нас по ней изобретательный, ненавязчивый и очаровательный путевой указатель - маленький лисёнок. Он не умеет разговаривать, но если бы умел, то наверняка между ним и мальчиком произошел бы этот диалог:  

- Не могу я с тобой играть, - сказал Лис.  - Я не приручен. 
- Ах, извини. А как это - приручить? 
-  Это  давно  забытое  понятие. Оно означает: создать узы. Ты для меня лишь маленький мальчик, точно такой же, как сто тысяч других мальчиков. И ты мне не нужен. И я тебе тоже не нужен. Я для тебя всего только лисица, точно такая же, как сто тысяч других лисиц. Но если ты меня приручишь, мы станем нужны друг другу. Ты будешь для меня единственным в целом свете. И я буду для тебя один в целом свете. 
Лис замолчал и долго смотрел на принца. Потом сказал: 
- Пожалуйста... приручи меня!

А чем кончается история Маленького принца и Лиса в книге? Расставанием. И про это же в итоге рассказывает Rime. Это символистская драма, разворачивающаяся в мире образов и идей. Забудьте о жизнеподобии и логике. Всё видимое нами – только тени, отражения. Игра уводит от реальности. Берёт кусок жестокой жизни и творит из него мрачную волшебную сказку. Да, очень мрачную. Не дайте этому острову так просто себя обмануть. Вы не будете вечно резвиться на солнечных пляжах. Из райского сада вам придётся отправиться в путешествие через гнев и страх, ложь и отчаяние.

В основу повествования положена всем известная и горячо любимая общественностью концепция 5 стадий горя. Не спешите отвергать игру даже если вам уже порядком поднадоела такая популярная психология. Естественно, эта модель – лишь фундамент. Суть не в ней, а в том, что авторы выстоят на её основе. Игра рассуждает не о принятии собственной смертности или переваривании абстрактной трагедии, а конкретно о потере близкого человека. О том, как много из того, что мы считаем частью себя, теряется с уходом любимых. О том, как научиться жить без кого-то. И как заново научиться жить с самим собой.

Остров молчаливо рассказывает свою историю. Каждый «уровень» игры – очевидная ступень на страдальческом пути. Гнев воплощается в тишине мёртвого летнего полдня. Воздух раскалён, колеблется от жара, камни будто горят на солнце. И исполинский крылатый хищник готов растерзать всех и всё вокруг, включая себя самого. Торг выражается в буквальном беге на месте и хождению по тёмным, сырым коридорам без начала и конца. Реальность погружается все глубже в тишину, как в темный омут. На душе становится жутко, как будто приближается что-то роковое и неизбежное. Затем наступает депрессия, и на мир обрушивается неистовый шторм. Голоса ночного ветра говорят о последнем одиночестве в страшной, слепой темноте. И тогда герой понимает, что всё ещё любит жизнь. Цепляется за нее и боится смерти, как черной бездонной ямы. Такая тоска сжимает сердце, что хочется плакать, как плачут маленькие дети. А вслед за криком последнего отчаяния приходит понимание, что верх и низ – одно и то же. Мы падаем и поднимаемся, уже не зная, колеблют ли нас тихие волны бесконечного движения, или мать качает на руках, баюкая.

Солнце сядет и взойдет над человеческой трагедией. И бриз будет носить крики чаек между скал. И как после ночи приходит утро, так горе человеческое когда-нибудь отступит. Как сказала одна злая, но мудрая ведьма: «То что украли - вернётся домой, сжатая вырастет рожь, мёртвый - в другом, по-иному - живой. Прошлого не вернёшь».

That being said, I can see how this game isn't for everyone. It's not fast-paced, and there's no combat or anything like that - you're just exploring the world while trying to solve puzzles (a big plus for me, but could be a minus for others). Playing this game was a serene experience for me, and I would often find myself taking moments to stop and soak in the environment around me.

A young boy wakes up on a Mysterious Island, how did he get on the island, who built all these structures and more importantly where are the people? That is what he wants to know as he explores the land and tries to discover the truth.

So the likes, Well to start the game is incredibly beautiful starting with the levels from the warm grassy Hills and ocean to the ruins and desert valley to the rain-soaked land of chapter 4, there is just so much to see and explore. 

The game's atmosphere was very good and can be it can be beautiful or haunting or depressing and sometimes all at once.

The story is really, really good with all its themes and playing it a second time makes the story even better. Plus it's one of those games where there's no dialogue, it tells its story through actions and cutscenes which this game pulled off very well and this game is one of the few games to make me tear up.

The music in the game was incredibly beautiful to listen to especially the ending theme. The puzzles in the game were good and fairly difficult but not impossible to figure out. All those Collectibles you can get throughout the game was very cool like the keyhole collectibles.

Now the dislikes, the game is a bit short you can beat it in four hours, it only gets longer if you're going after the achievements. The price for the game is seriously too high for such a short game, I mean I could understand if the game was like 10 or $15 at most but 29,99 that is way too high. 

And lastly would I liked away to skip cutscenes I mean when I was going after the achievements I wish there was an option where I could just again skip the cutscenes.

Now with that said RiME is an incredibly beautiful and heartfelt Adventure, Puzzle game. With so much to love from the really, really good story, to the incredibly beautiful levels and the incredibly beautiful music.

Now if you’re looking for a Adventure, Puzzle game this is so for you, I highly recommended it but I say wait till it's on sale before you get it.",1599789849,1599789881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В этой игре великолепная атмосфера и музыка, далее по подробнее.
Игровой процесс будет происходить будет на 5 локациях, они же являются аллегорией на пять стадий принятия смерти: ОТРИЦАНИЕ, ГНЕВ, ТОРГ, ДЕПРЕССИЯ, ПРИНЯТИЕ.
Незнаю насколько это спойлер, но как такого сюжета там нет, но всё же спрячу (может для кого-то это будет важно), но расскажу основную завязку сюжета: [spoiler]У отца умирает сын [/spoiler]. Так вот вся локация является олицетворением, его внутренней борьбы с данной утратой[/b]
Эту игру раздавали в Epic games, но скачав её, я захотел её пройти полностью. В ГОГ были скидки, я взял, но там не работали достижения (а так как я в последнее время подсел на ачивмодрочерство), я сделал возврат, и купил уже в стиме.

[h1] Плюсы игры: [/h1]
[b] 1) Визуальный стиль и наполнение игры [/b]
Игра выполнена в мультяшном стиле. Сами же локации просто ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНЫ. Они проработаны и красивы, каждая локация по-своему. Само наполнение в этом сказочном мире разнообразно, кого только не встретишь. «ТЫ» реально как будто находишься в сказке. Мне очень трудно описать эту игру с точки зрения «визуала», это скорее нужно видеть. Мне бы хотелось прикрепить гифку сюда, но ограничение в 8мб, сжимает качество видео так, что даже цветов потом не остаётся :) 
[b] 2) Ничего лишнего [/b]
В этой игре нет ничего лишнего: Ни сюжета, ни разговоров, ни боёв. Нужно просто наслаждаться «сказкой», красотой мира, головоломками и музыкой. Игре удаётся превосходно передать историю не с помощью слов, а с помощью визуальных и звуковых элементов, делая из игры глубокое и эмоциональное путешествие, которое ещё долго будет нельзя забыть.
[b] 3) Умеренная сложность головоломок [/b]
Я люблю такие головоломки, где на решение задачи уходит 1-2 мин, т.е они не лёгкие, но и не сложные. Такие головоломки дают немного подумать, а потом в голову придёт решение. А не так, где 10 мин ходишь «туда сюда», ничего не понимаешь, бомбишь, потом идёшь на ютуб. С этим здесь всё впорядке. В целом разобравшись с механиками игры, задачи будут решаться быстро.
[b] 4) Музыкальное сопровождение [/b]
Что может добавить душевности игре ? Именно музыка, музыка важный элемент, и она всегда влияет на атмосферу в каждой игре.Только за музыку, игре можно поставить 10/10.

[h1] Минусы игры: [/h1]
Минус только один: оптимизация. Всю игру стабильный 80-120 фпс, всё хорошо. Попадаем на 3 локацию, и в игре как будто включается «вертикальная синхронизация» и фпс падает до 30, и периодически дропается и фризит. Такое происходит только на 3 локации, с чем связано не знаю.  

[h1] Итог: [/h1]
Мы получаем красивую, душевную игру с грустной историей, с прекрасной музыкой, головоломками,  где не нужно стрелять, нужно просто расслабиться и получать удовольствие от этого мира. 
Кому подойдёт данный проект ? Вряд ли эта игра подойдёт вам, если вы любитель экшена, вам постоянно хочется стрелять, убивать и т.д. Это просто хорошо сделанная сказка, скорее даже для взрослой аудитории 18+ лет, «шкила» вряд ли заценит, по крайней мере большинство.

いずれのゲームの特徴も、どこの言語にも依存しない世界観という点が挙げられます。主人公はほぼ喋らず、掛け声や嗚咽などのみ。ストーリー上にも文字は存在せず、パーツとして集められるイラストで何が起こったのかを推測する仕掛けになっています。人によってこれらはわかりにくいと思われるかもしれませんし、意味不明な世界観に写るかもしれません。

音楽もこれまた、魂がゆさぶられるような、でも心地よいストリングス。うっかりするとプレイ中に寝てしまいそうでした。

アクション性やパズル性はそこまで高くなく、世界観を堪能することに重きを置かれているように思います。ゆえにゲームとしては面白さを感じにくい設計かもしれません。

昨今のオープンワールドのように、明確な目的先やマークが無いため、一部どこに進んでいいいのか分かりにくいところがあります。それでも不思議と先に進めるのだから、ステージ設計がよくできているのでしょう。

ボリュームはちょっと寄り道してクリアで6時間程度。これはボリュームとしては少ないほうでしょう。

3줄 요약있음

[b]게임플레이: 초반과 극후반이 지루하다.[/b]
정보를 잘 안주는편이기에 초반에 그냥 돌아다니고 적당히 기어오르고식이라 지루하다.
힌트를 정확하게 주지 않고 몽환스럽게 시각적으로 표현해준다. 예를들어 바람길이라던가 나비라던가... 대충 보고 지나가버리거나 눈치가 없으면 찾기 힘들다. 물론 힌트도 다 주는건 아니다. 퍼즐힌트는 없는편이고 대충 길찾는 힌트들 위주다.
퍼즐의 난이도는 대부분 직관적으로 단순하지만 쉽지는 않은편. 이해를 단번에 못하면 헤맬 가능성이 있어보인다.
중반부는 이것저것 나름 다양하게 해야해서 재미는 좀 있는편
극후반은 너무 맵이 크고 렉걸려서 지루해짐.

[b]수집요소: 있으나 딱히 모을필요 없음[/b]
일반 엔딩과 약간 차이가 있는 진엔딩(?)에 영향이 있으나 크게 모을필요 없고, 다시 모으려고 회차돌기도 애매함.
딱히 수집욕구를 자극하지 못했고, 회차 돌릴정도로 게임이 크게 매력적이지도 않다.

[b]조작감: 크게 구리진 않지만 답답할 수 있음. [/b]
왠만한 구간에선 괜찮지만, 고지대에서 내려가야할때 난감함. 뛰어내렸을때 너무 높으면 위에서 다시시작되버리고, 매달릴 수 있는곳이면 그냥 안떨어지고 매달리려고 뒤돌아 앉고 매달리려고 한다. 계속 보다보면 좀 답답해짐.
그리고 느릿느릿한 다른 요소들도 덤

[b]사운드: 좋음! 근데 기억에 안남음[/b]
머릿속에 멜로디가 남는 음악은 딱히 없다. 하지만 결코 나쁜것이 아니다. 귀는 즐거웠지만 기억에 안남을뿐, 왠만한 게임들은 이런편이 더 많다.

[b]스토리: (엔딩을 보기 전까진) 이해는 가나 나사빠진듯한 찝찝한 진행[/b]
마치 세계관을 제대로 정리 안해놓고 만들거나, 설명을 제대로 안해주는 판타지 게임을 하는 느낌이 내내 든다. 뭔가 빠진듯한 이해로 진행을 하게 된다. 하지만 엔딩을 보고나면 약간의 스턴을 먹지만 이해가 가는편

[b]그래픽: 예쁜 거렁뱅이[/b]
확실히 그래픽은 예쁘다. 하지만 예쁜거에 신경을 너무 많이 썼는지 최적화가 정말 끔찍하다. 옵션을 낮추면 되겠지만, 다른 게임 돌릴때의 옵션보다 낮은 옵션으로 돌려야 쾌적하다고 생각하면 된다.






[h1]3줄요약[/h1]
1. 할만한데 이것저것 나사빠짐
2. 게임플레이 초반이랑 극후반 지루함
3. 그래픽 예쁜데 렉걸림

0. 세일하면 사라



잘 만든게임은 맞으나 여러모로 아쉬운점이 너무나도 큰 게임.
크게 세일하면 사서 한번쯤 해보는것도 좋지만, 크게는 추천 못하겠는 작품


4시간만에 엔딩보고 더이상 잡을생각이 없음.

추천할지 말지 고민했는데, 정가 3.2만원이라 걍 비추줌.

Feels like a gentle version of Shadows of the Colossus, though without any Colossi. Make of that what you will.  It's the setting, the atmosphere, and the feeling that you're playing with ancient machinations you maybe shouldn't be.

This is one of those rare adventures that just is. You're told nothing, you just dive into the world you find yourself in and learn as you go, the scenery is gorgeous, vast and actively fascinating.  The story is silent, not a coherent word is ever said or written, and yet it really knows how to tug on a few chords in your heart before you know it.

There are some stunning set pieces and some superb animations that really carry a message stronger than words could.

There're no punishing elements to this game, any deaths I experienced (and a single glitch that stuck me in a wall and I had to restart), put me right back where I left off. There can feel like pressure and weight to your actions but failure is gently corrected.

The music is subtle but very mood-influencing!

It's a good modest length, I clocked 7 hours while barely scratching the achievements list


Biggest downside is it REALLY doesn't play well with my monitors and OBS, it took a long time of turning options on and off at random before it could settle. The option to select which monitor it's using is very confused - I had to select different monitors back and forth before it would eventually land on the one I wanted, even though the menus and resolution reported weren't even close!  I recommend turning down Shadow Detail as this seems to wreck performance and it looks great still

游戏难度较低，动作设计和流畅度都不错，全篇游戏没有文字，游戏进程的指引也很直观，不会出现让人因迷路而卡关之类的问题。要素不少，在流程中也没有感觉到重复性很高，当然整个流程也不太长。
至于问题其实也有一些，动作的反馈做得不太好，我用键盘有时要点好几下才有反馈，导致游戏的操作流畅不好，有一些关卡会受到影响，但感觉游戏也为此减轻了难度，去掉了一些精细的操作，所以也还好。
然后就是视角了，作为一个3D游戏，在前面几个关卡很多狭小房间中转换视角都会穿模，还有与上帝视角的切换，对于键鼠操作适配得不好，总是以一种很微妙的方向行动，很影响游戏体验，导致我在游戏初期一度弃坑，但第二章以后建筑物变得开阔，这种情况就不会出现了。

Vzduchem se ozývá radostný křik racků, po travnatých stráních pobíhají malá prasátka, mezi stromy se mihne ryšavá oháňka... A přeci je na zdejším poklidu cosi zneklidňujícího. Mohutné stavby z bílého kamene se majestátně tyčí k obloze, ale všechny jen zejí prázdnotou a tiše chátrají. Cožpak na tomhle místě již nikdo nežije?

Zábavný je i samotný průchod každou lokací, spočívající v překonávání různorodých překážek, zejména pomocí šplhu a skákání. Ale dojde i na potápění. Pamětníci staré [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/224960/Tomb_Raider_I/]Lary Croft[/url], tak budou přeneseni zpět do radostného mládí.

Vynikající je také melancholická atmosféra celé hry, šikovně pracující s motivem ztráty a osamocení. Ta je navíc umocněna nádherným hudebním doprovodem, stejně jako často využívanou symbolikou. Zamrzí snad jen nevyužitý potenciál, dřímající ve vašem liščím společníkovi, který zde plní pouze funkci roztomilé nápovědy. Pochvalu si naopak zaslouží promyšlená stavba úrovní, nabízející mnoho skrytých odboček a tajných zákoutí, lákajících ke zvídavému průzkumu. Za zmínku stojí také okouzlující střídaní dne a noci, při kterém se místy až tají dech.

Pokud si tedy chcete zahrát krásnou hru, stojící především na průzkumu a prostorových hádankách, pak máte mé doporučení.

I feel like the developer hit the perfect balance of keeping things visually appealing without compromising on performance. You're not going to be wowed by super complex textures or water physics, but game stays beautiful from beginning to end and runs great. What really stood out was how the gameplay elements (climable ledges, interactive objects, etc) fit in seamlessly with the surrounds; enough to make it seem like everything was supposed to be there but not so much that you weren't sitting around scratching your head wondering what to do or where to go

Story (NO SPOILERS) - I've seen a lot of developers try and capture the emotional tones of games like Journey and Abzu and completely wiff. Thankfully, TW knocked this one out of the park. Telling a story without dialogue or written words isn't new, but it's tricky. The overall theme only becomes apparent to the AFTER you beat the game but what blew me away was how well each section of the game complemented each other. There's optional collectibles that flesh out the narrative a bit as well. I missed most of them on my first playthrough but the game's length (~7 hours) and post-completion chapter select mean I'll probably try once or twice to find more.

Gameplay - The puzzles in RiME aren't difficult, but I don't think they're meant to be. The puzzles are there to give context to the narrative, and while they're not challenging they are pretty clever and satisfying to solve. There's some mild platforming in the form of some Nathan Drake esque ledge climbing but again, it's there to enhance the feeling of exploration. Overall movement and climbing was satisfying and it reminded me somewhat of a more responsive version of a Team Ico game (Shadow of the Colossus). I did appreciate how nice the camera movement felt. I can't count how many times I've played a game that tried to be ""cinematic"" and just resulted in me wrestling for control of the camera 90% of the time.

I see some reviews online where people are judging the game against what they want it to be and it leaves them disappointed. The real question is, what is RiME TRYING to be, and does it accomplish what it sets out to do? To me, the answer is a resounding ""yes"" to that final question.

Graphically it is gorgeous. I have a mid-range PC and it ran silky smooth on high settings. I believe the performance issues they were having earlier on have been ironed out. I really love the art style in this game. The music/score is also top notch... really beautiful stuff that fits the game nicely. I also really liked the story. I've seen some complaints about the story not being explained or complex... but that's the point. The game is a journey of discovery where you have to piece it together. And when you finally do figure out what is going on, yes, it is a ""simple"" story, but it is powerful. A game doesn't need a dozen characters or voice acting to tell an effective story.

As for the puzzles, yes, they are not especially challenging, but they aren't trying to be. I enjoyed working my way through them and exploring the beautiful environments. I recently finished The Witness and it was one of my favorites, so I am not opposed to some good puzzling, but RiME is not trying to be a hard puzzle game. I did find some of the platforming a bit repetitive and the controls were not perfect, but they were more than sufficient.

So take RiME for what it is, a beautiful journey of discovery with some fun but not overly difficult challenges along the way. For an indy game, I think it is a triumph.",1596066268,1596066268,True,3,0,0.546385705471038818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played this game with my fiancee who up until a year ago had never really played a video game.

The best part about RiME is about how you put together a story easily if you can perceive what's happening to the character and the world that you traverse. 

I think that the fun at least for me was trying to understand the big picture and if you are not in it for that it might leave you disappointed. The quality of the game is overall good I didn't get stuck and finding out where to go next was easy. It's not a game that is so abstract that it basically feels like there isn't a story but more about giving you signs and leaving the interpretation up to you.

The platforming and puzzles are pretty easy so just about anybody can complete the game, but they're still challenging enough to keep you engaged throughout the game. 

The art, the music, and atmosphere that they create goes perfectly with the story the developers are trying to tell. The way this game is presented made it easy to be immersed in it. Some people may not be impressed with the art style of this game but I think it will age well as time goes on. The game is quite cinematic and every scene is directed well.Rime is about dealing with loss in life and the music is used to highlight that. 

I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a game that doesn't require a lot of time or effort to get through. Gameplay is simple enough to keep you from getting stuck and engaging enough to keep you interested.  I found it a bit relaxing and a very enjoyable experience.

Telling a story through the form of a world with many puzzles that when solved allow for the progress that gives you a bit more of the story.
Again like Papo Yo the story is told visually and not through words and with that you have a lot of different symbolism in place and the whole story does not unfold until the very end showing what was really happening.
The game is beautiful to look at, the style is pleasing, the sounds and music evoke all kinds of emotions and the story heart rending.

The first two of four (the fifth level is a glorified cutscene) levels are amazing.  Beautiful, platforming, puzzles, lots of secrecy and mystery through exploration.  The third level is the ""Water Temple"" x 3.  It's confusing, and it doesn't know what it wants to be throughout the entire level.  Is it a maze?  Oh, the maze part is done.  Is it an avoid the evil creatures?  Oh, the evil creatures part is done.  Is it lead the drone through the ancient puzzle areas?  Yes.

The final level lacks any of the beauty of the other levels.  it rains the entire time and the level is all stone black.

The game also has a story.  It's not necessary at all, and for me it's what makes the game mixed for me.  If they threw the story out the window and gave me the same first two levels but five different times, then the story just wouldn't matter.  But they have a story and thus fit mechanics into said story:

[spoiler] You play a son who died during a storm at sea who is searching for his father.  Each of the five levels emulate the five stages of grief.  So while the first two levels emulate denial and aggression, which fit really well into the game, the third and fourth levels emulate bargaining and depression.  I guess I felt those during the levels?  But it was so poorly done at the third and fourth levels that the end did not pay off.  The fifth level is ""Acceptance"", which means you simply press W a few times to walk through a hall and let a scarf go.[/spoiler]

Overall, I spent about 5 hours in the first two levels, having fun.  The third level I spent 3 hours in, confused out of my damn mind, and the fourth and fifth level speeding through clocking a whole 1 hour about.

No payoff and I steel fill a bit empty.

Still, I'd recommend buying it.  It was fun while it lasted and makes me long for games like the Legend of Zelda and such.",1594999515,1595050918,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

解谜：对玩家的引导到位，谜题整体较为简单，运用声音、视觉错位等元素的解谜过程有趣，但整篇玩下来略显单一

[spoiler] 通篇游戏时长大约在10小时以内，游戏封面中的灯塔以及酷似钥匙孔的形状贯穿了整个故事各章节，不仅作为故事线的线索，对最终结局也起到了相当大的铺垫作用。在游玩过程中玩家的目标就是在探索灯塔通往的各个世界中解谜或者按照壁画的“预言”行动从而推动剧情发展，在这个过程中找回自己的记忆、结识了很多伙伴，比如第一章就一直指引着你前进方向的小狐狸和后面登场的“卫士”等等。从开始小男孩被海水冲上海岸，到屡次出现在探索过程中的被暴风摧毁的小船，游戏途中收集的玩具形象，这些暗示使得最后的剧情是出乎意料的，但也是情理之中的，从第一章小男孩遇到的红衣神秘人，冥冥之中隐藏着真相的灯塔（禁闭岛既视感），中间的沙漠章节大鸟的袭击以及壁画的预言让很多玩家以为小男孩是一个王子而其他的亡灵应该是待拯救的臣民这样的童话故事，而随着记忆的逐步解锁，男孩身上的红色披风与红衣男有着千丝万缕的联系，而亡者国度中，小男孩的朋友们为了他能找到真相，相继牺牲自己换来男孩前进的道路，这里点名表扬亡者国度的雨夜气氛烘托，以及男孩变得和亡灵一样全身黑，这个时候剧情已然逼近高潮，跟禁闭岛里男主端着枪准备冲进神秘的灯塔一样，真的就捏了一把汗心都提到嗓子眼那种。后面所有的亡灵都向深渊里跳去，这里的深渊正是反转的灯塔，从灯塔底部向无限的星空跳去[/spoiler]
[spoiler]有说“死去的人会变成星星”，众多亡灵像解放一般纷纷跳入，男孩最终跳入，这时玩家已经隐约感到男孩一路上遇到亡灵的原因，正如从亡者的国度的灯塔中跳下去进入轮回，这一段剧情的高潮，从BGM的烘托，雨夜的气氛，凝视的深渊，而他人都像解脱一样跳进去的那种震撼场景，令人印象深刻。[/spoiler]
[spoiler]最终回到真正的现实世界，海边、海鸥叫、风声、夕阳透过木窗，这里仍像童话一样美，但真相却沉重得让人喘不过气，这位生活在海边灯塔旁小屋的老父亲，在与历尽千辛万苦回到人间的男孩短暂相拥后，面对夕阳，这位老人，选择了让这片红色的披风随风而去，正如最后的成就“Letting go” [/spoiler]",1594646829,1594646973,True,8,1,0.639889240264892578,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Los puzles no son complicados, pues el juego no pretende ser un gran desafío ni atascar a los jugadores demasiado tiempo, sino que está pensado para que el que lo juegue vaya disfrutando sin frustraciones, con un ritmo dinámico y enlazando poco a poco pedacitos de la historia en los elementos que va encontrando en el mapa o las secuencias de vídeo (los extras no son imprescindibles para pasar el juego, sin embargo aportan información importante para entender la historia). En resumen se trata de un juego corto (unas 10 horas si no nos detenemos mucho a explorar todo o hasta 30 o mas si queremos completar todo). La Historia es el gran misterio que hay que desvelar. El único ""pero"" es el de sus problemas de rendimiento (FPS o caída de frames/cuadros), solucionado ya casi por completo con parches. Sin embargo, si has jugado juegos antiguos con muchos elementos en pantalla, las ralentizaciones entonces (Nes 8 bits, etc) eran mucho peores y no nos privaban de jugar magníficos juegos.

Given the ultimate twist to the entire game, I feel like it could have been a lot more adventurous.

I started to want to do more than jump from ledge to ledge and scream ""Hah!""  Or carry glowing orbs around.  If you need  a little guidance even in a sandbox setting, you're fresh out of luck.   It's entirely possible to a puzzle wrong and have to start a stage over to remedy that. You're going to have to find  a good online guide.  The closest thing this game has to that is a little fox that barks at you and even so, you'll need to solve a puzzle to get him.  I purchased this game while it was on sale. I recommend doing that.

It isn;t worth thirty dollars. A game worth that amount  would have not only created a beautiful world but   would also have given me an adventure to have in it. I feel cheated.

②. 游戏中的互动键经常反馈迟缓，或者跟物体进行互动的时候，对角色位置 方向要求太严苛，体验略差；
③. 人物跳跃时，由于视角问题，后跳和斜跳时，方向按键和跳跃方向偶尔不匹配，导致跳跃偶尔失败；
④. 游戏最高画质下，跳帧卡顿明显，优化差强人意。

It is, after all, a gorgeous game, and I must admit, I was captivated by it almost the entire way through.  But there are two things I really didn't like about this game.

The first was that most of the puzzles weren't interesting, once you are introduced to their mechanics.  Basically, the game will introduce a puzzle mechanic, and the first puzzle might be somewhat confusing, but after that, almost all puzzles are straightforward variations of it.  Some aren't even puzzles so much as busy work, especially climbing sequences.

I could excuse this defect because the game has really gorgeous aesthetics to it, and the protagonists, despite the lack of words, have endearing qualities to them.

The thing that really annoyed me about this game is the following.  About 3/4ths of the way through the game, I mentioned to my wife, ""I really hope that [hackneyed plot twist] isn't true.""

And waddya know?  It turned out to be true!

And that was so disappointing, not just because it has been done to death, but because it does not serve to tie any of the other game's elements together.  Frankly, the game would have done better to leave you in the dark to form your own hypotheses.  Instead, it clumsily attempts to hit you over the head with its ""big reveal,"" but misses by a mile.

What follows is my opinion, which slightly gives this away, and so I will shroud most of it in a spoiler:

I think this game suffers from what a lot of media suffers from these days: the need to be deep by over-explaining things.  Professor X can't just have gone bald, because Male-Pattern Baldness is a thing.  He has to have lost his boyish mop of hair after being strapped into a machine of death.  Han Solo can't just be named Han Solo, because it's just a name.  No, he has to acquire it, because he ""goes it, alone."" (and, for some reason, people in a galaxy far, far, away are aware of Spanish).  In this case, [spoiler]you can't just have a child truly journey through a mysterious island with ancient technology, and unconventional topology.  No, it has to turn out to be ""like a deep metaphor for loss, and grief, man.""  Give me a break.  If you're going to do that, at least do it well.  Have the Fox, the scary bird thing, and the ancient walking robots be symbolic of this.[/spoiler]  Instead, we get what amounts to a hairy dog story in video game form, and that really does the rest of the  game a disservice.",1593582739,1593584059,False,1,0,0.492241263389587402,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Начинается довольно теплым тоном, а заканчивается на грустной ноте. Реплик в игре никаких нету, сюжет подается через окружение и действие. И к тому он оставляет после прохождения вопросы, на которые найди ответ сам. [/b] [/code]

Beautiful artwork and amazing soundtrack. I normally turn music off in games, but doing that here would be a terrible mistake. While it's a short game, it's definitely worth taking your time to enjoy the world.

Game plays somewhat like Uncharted or Tomb Raider without the combat, so basically exploration/climbing and puzzles. The story is also very tied to the presentation of the levels and there are quite a few metaphors once you figure out what's going on. Definitely a worthwhile experience.

""Rime"" is not the game you may think it is at first. If you're expecting a casual, relaxing walking simulator, ""Rime"" is not quite that. Because in order for a game to be that, it wouldn't ask so much from its players as ""Rime"" does. Most of its puzzles are fair enough, but some others can be really brain-wrecking and time consuming. So this is the first thing to learn about this game: it's not so casual as it looks. It will take you some time; my first run in it took me close to six hours.

The game is very much a semi-open world, with these large areas. There's very little to indicate you where to go, since the game goes for minimalism, but it surely could use a way to at least point players where to go next, like in ""BioShock: Infinite"", ""Alien: Isolation"" and even ""Mirror's Edge"". For ""Rime"", there's this fox that barks at you, pointing you where to go in bigger areas. And sometimes, there'll be lights coming from the ground into the sky like beacons. Those are helpful, but a bit cumbersome; a mini-map could have aided much.

As a puzzle game, it has its fair share of classic key fetching, and sometimes you'll need to carry small objects to complete your goals. You'll also be dragging larger blocks around like in a ""Tomb Raider"" game. One little problem with the game is that it can have some annoying backtracking, as once you activate something, you're required to walk your way back into where you've been before. It's not something that happens often, but it's a noticeable issue nonetheless.

The game is heavy on puzzles, but one big thing about ""Rime"" is the platforming. There's a lot of jumping and climbing to do in this game, and controls are fluid and reliable - except however when you need to drop down from some higher ground, as landing from certain altitudes will stun your character for a bit. There's also a lot of swimming in this game, but underwater environments can get very big and very disorienting, while you can only hold your breath for so long.

This brings me to something important: you can actually die in this game. Falling from large heights and drowning are the ways the environment can kill you. As for enemies, you'll come across the ""shades"": sinister creatures in dark hoods who are harmless at first, but become dangerous later on. In a level, you'll also see this giant bird that can poach you if you stay in the open for too long. The good news however is that once you die, you immediately pick up from close nearby, meaning that you don't lose anything at all. The deaths in this game will be more of a nuisance than a heavy frustration.

The visuals are splendid, and many compared them to ""Breath of the Wild"": it doesn't go for ultra-realism, but instead for painting-like graphics that are exuberant and evocative. It even feels like those short animated films you see in YouTube. The thing however - and I don't think this is something all players experienced or will experience - is that my PC would get really hot while playing this game, to the point I could personally feel it. And this scared the hell out of me, more than any of the enemies or visuals in this game. I toned the graphics down, but even then my PC would still heat up like a fireplace. It's weird that happens for a game in which the visuals don't even look that demanding.

There are plenty of collectables in this game - so much in fact that to call this game a collectaton wouldn't be so far off. Some of these collectables are easy to find, but others are very well hidden, representing massive detours from the main path. After you beat the game, you can access the levels individually at the main menu to pick up what you missed. There's also a lot of achievements, so this game will keep completionists busy for a time. You can even unlock new clothes for your character, but they're just cosmetic; it would have been nice if different clothes would bring certain benefits.

Speaking of your character, this is when I address the story, and I left it for last for a reason. I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say that the main idea of this game was treated clumsily. It tries to tell a story in a symbolic fashion, but at some flashbacks, the game kind of lies to us in order not to reveal itself so soon. And the game is so minimalist with its storytelling (not a word is uttered throughout the whole game) that some players might not even get it after concluding it. The story itself is quite noble and surprisingly profound, but I wish its themes were treated better.

""Rime"" is a flawed gem of a game. It is much more than its visuals alone, and you should definitely buy it if you're a fan of puzzles, platformers and collectatons. It assimilates all that is familiar to us in its own unique way.",1593477843,1643718797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]7/10[/b] - A rather compelling take centered on the five stages of grief. But again, the requirements/optimization are unsatisfactory to say the least.



[h1]ORIGINAL 2020 REVIEW:[/h1]

[b]The ""System Requirements"" section is a joke, as is the optimization...[/b]

I own a machine consisting of a Ryzen 5 3600X processor paired with an RX 580 (8GB) GPU, 16GB of DDR4-3000 RAM and an SSD on which I installed it [i](tried it on an HDD as well)[/i], so not only does my rig meet the ""Recommended Requirements"", but it has also surpassed them, only to get 50 choppy frames in 1080p with every graphical setting turned off.

Now the game itself looks really fun, nice, relaxing and whatnot, but I cannot recommend it because 3 years later, my experience with it [i](before I finally gave up and uninstalled it)[/i] consisted of benchmarking, mixing settings, switching screen mode and VSync, googling the issue and trying other potential fixes, to no positive end result though...

""Resolution Scale"" is the only setting that gave me [i](along with everything else turned off and set to ""Low"")[/i] 60 frames without the game being choppy and stuttering constantly, but I was not about to play it downscaled from a simple 1080p resolution considering the machine I own...

So yeah...since I could not enjoy it until the end [i]([b]or at all for that matter.[/b]..spending almost 4 out of 5 hours benchmarking, mixing settings, googling fixes and whatnot)[/i], this is my verdict:

[h1]While it looks like an at least [b]7/10[/b] game, it plays and is optimized for a [b]3/10[/b] score at best...

Personal experience:
I think the idea for the game’s twist was born before a single asset was made. The game knows it is telling a dramatic story, but for new players it comes off as just weird or pretentious. In the first hour when the music swells with emotion, I have no idea why. It’s pretty, sure. But so what? Why should I care? This is what has been going through my mind as I played the game.
It borrows heavily from Journey, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, Tomb Raider. It desperately wants to be just as deep, but comes off as juvenile. I don’t regret playing this game.

It honestly left me not feeling like I wanted to play anymore after the first chapter. Only reason I did was to get this game out of my backlog completely.

I'm glad I kept playing. The remaining levels were *significantly* more interesting and there was a much better sense of progression within them.

Il me laisse un avis très mitigé. Je n'ai pas été aussi émerveillé que les autres apparemment... Peut-être que je ne correspond pas au bon public...

Clairement, le jeu a été soigné. L'histoire, les graphismes, la bande son... je n'ai pas de reproches à faire à de ce côté là. Alors d'où vient cet avis très mitigé ? Trois points : le gameplay, la linéarité et la durée de vie.

Concernant le gameplay, je n'ai pas noté de bugs (à la manette), mais je l'ai trouvé très rigide. Je me dis que c'est voulu, pour rendre les déplacements plus réalistes (on n'est pas dans un Crash/Spyro/...), mais c'est peut-être un peu trop ? J'ai eu l'impression que le personnage avait du mal à avancer, à sauter, etc. Même dans un point'n'click, quand le perso marche, il avance à peu près aussi vite qu'ici alors que notre perso est censé courir...

Concernant la linéarité, le jeu n'offre aucune réflexion, aucune action, rien. On avance, point. Il y a soi-disant un aspect exploration, mais il m'a semblé mal exploité. On débarque sur une plage après une cinématique qui ne nous indique ni pourquoi ni comment ni notre but. Ok, explorons... On fait trois pas, on comprend qu'il y a des choses à activer. On les active, on avance un peu et ça recommence. Il n'y a pas grand chose à explorer, il suffit d'avancer. Par ailleurs, lors de certains passages, vous ne pourrez plus faire demi-tour (porte qui se ferme, bloc trop haut pour repartir dans l'autre sens...). Mince, vous n'aviez pas pris le temps d'explorer l'autre passage avant : tant pis.
Certes, il y a des objets à collectionner/trouver. Ici, je n'appelle pas ça de l'exploration, mais de la durée de vie artificielle. D'ailleurs, j'ai rarement vu un jeu où les pourcentages des succès sont si faibles sur des objets à collecter (autour de 3-4%...). Et pourtant, un point positif, le jeu propose une option pour redémarrer un chapitre ! Par contre, impossible de passer les cinématiques dans ce mode... Il ne faut pas se mentir, le jeu a beau être soigné, il ne donne pas envie de le refaire.

Concernant la durée de vie, comptez 6h pour finir le jeu (sans débloquer tous les succès, mais sans se presser aussi). Pour 35€, je trouve que ça fait cher l'heure de jeu. Surtout que le plaisir de jouer n'est pas au rendez-vous. Le jeu est beau, mais ça ne suffit pas à en faire un bon jeu. Personnellement, je me suis plutôt ennuyé. Heureusement, je l'ai acheté en promo...

Au final, je ne recommande pas RIME (à défaut d'une autre option), mais peut-être que vous correspondrez au public visé. Si pour vous, la passivité et la contemplation prime sur le reste, vous apprécierez sans doute RIME. Sinon... j'en suis moins sûr. A petit prix, vous pouvez toujours tenter pour vous faire votre propre avis.

As is the music.
And even the very last scene suddenly touched me pretty profoundly.

Yet the game as a whole is lacking in two very important aspects:

The story is - besides the aforementioned last scene - non-existent.
I didn't know anything about the character, the world or the motivations - anything at all.
That's why, throughout the whole experience, I couldn't get myself to CARE about anything
in the game world. Nothing had any meaning to me.

The gameplay drives this point home even more, because it's soooooo slow and unfocused.
HOW MUCH I wished for a key to get the character to really RUN for once, as well as a MAP FEATURE
to finally get hold of where in the game world I was, where I already had been, and where I would have to go.
This goes down to some - really unexpected - details that frustrated the hell out of me:
Every miniscule edge you stumble upon your character has to climb. And he does so. VERY. SLOWLY.
Yes, I'm not even kidding - it drove me mad, that CLIMBING, one of the major movement mechanics of
the game, wasn't even fun - it was repetitive, sluggish and therefore overall frustratingly boring to watch.

So if you like colorful, artsy games, and walking simulations in particular, for all means - give this
game a go, one can tell it's a passion project.

난이도 : 다소 낮음.

눈은 꽤 즐거웠으나 마음까지 울리지는 못했다. 소소한 단점이 꽤 많았던 게임.

[b]화려한 그래픽과 빈약한 서사전달력[/b]
이 게임을 사는 대부분의 사람들은 아무래도 밝은 분위기의 힐링겜처럼 생긴 그래픽을 보고 구매를 했을 것이다. 물론 그래픽적인 측면에서는 그다지 트집 잡을 것이 없다. 다만, 초반에는 밝은 힐링겜의 분위기를 가지고 가다가 중후반 정도에는 어둡고 우울한 분위기로 변모한다. 끝까지 밝은 분위기를 기대한 사람들에게는 조금 실망스러운 점이 되겠다. 그래도 게임을 하면서 웅장한 유적들을 보며 눈은 꽤 즐거웠다. 인정한다.
다만, 스토리의 측면에서는 그렇지 못하다는 점. 챕터들이 이어지는 것은 맞다. 그렇지만 이해가 되진 않는다. ""아이스크림을 손에 쥐고 있다. 아이스크림이 녹았다."" 이 문장은 이어진다. 개연성은 충분하다. 그러나 아무 감정도 없다. 재미도 없다. 뒷 문장을 ""눈물이 흘러 아이스크림을 녹였다.""라고만 바꿔도 문장은 색달라진다. 왜 슬픈지에 대한 의문이 들어 스토리에 대한 몰입도가 달라진다.  이런 스토리에 대한 단서가 게임 플레이에서 녹아나오지 않는다. 그저 벽화 정도만 단서로 주더니 엔딩에서 하고 싶은 말을 다 해버린다. ""소년이 있다. [spoiler]그리고 소년은 죽었다.[/spoiler]"" 그저 이 두 문장만 있을 뿐이다. 엔딩을 보고나서도 게임 내에서 이해가 안되는 부분이 많았다. 서사전달력은 아주 빈약했다.

[b]인디게임 = 구린 조작감[/b]
유명한 게임사의 게임을 하면서 조작감이 나쁘다고 생각된 적은 많지 않았다. 그러나 인디게임들을 하면 조작감은 참 문제가 된다. 물론 조작감이란 것이 게이머마다 주관적이지만. 이 게임은 맵이 좀 넓다. 웅장하고 광할한 분위기를 내기 위해서 그런 것이겠지만 문제는 이동속도가 느리다는 것. 먼 곳을 가는데 느릿느릿 조깅을 하니 조작감이 답답할 수밖에. 쉬프트가 평지에서는 '구르기'인데 실제로는 퍼즐을 풀 때 아무 쓸모가 없다. 차라리 달리는 버튼이었어야지. 게임 태그에 '릴렉싱'이 있는데 그다지 릴렉스하지 못하다. (애초에 스팀태그가 완전히 믿을 것은 못 된다) 릴렉싱이란 것은 게이머가 원할 때 해야하는 것이지 이런 식으로 강제해서는 안 된다. 

[b]자유롭다가도 강제되는 고정 시점[/b]
이 게임은 기본적으로는 3인칭 시점이지만 보통의 3인칭들이 그렇듯 캐릭터의 뒤쪽에 고정되어 있지 않다. 캐릭터의 뒤통수만이 아니라 앞이나 옆도 볼 수 있게 회전한다. 캐릭터를 아래서 위로 올려다보면 웅장함이 돋보여서 그래픽을 더욱 즐길 수 있기도 하다. (아쉽게도 왜인지 바로 위쪽 하늘은 볼 수가 없다) 다만, 퍼즐을 풀다보면 시점이 강제로 고정되는 경우가 생긴다. 주로 벽타기 퍼즐일 때가 많은데 이런 경우에 오히려 퍼즐이 잘 안보여 불편한 경우가 좀 생긴다. 그리고 방향키가 캐릭터의 방향에 따라서 움직이는 것이 아니라 화면 시점에 따라서 움직이기 때문에 조금 헷갈리는 경우가 생긴다. 시점의 문제는 그리 큰 문제는 아니지만 개인적으로는 단점의 하나로 여겼다.

깊은 맛의 게임을 하고 싶다면 추천하지 않는다. 다만, 그저 눈요기 정도로 생각하고 퍼즐 게임을 하고 싶다는 사람에게는 충분히 할만하다. 그래픽의 분위기도 좋으며 퍼즐도 쉬워 간단하게 할만하다. 밝기가 어둡다는 평이 좀 있는데 게임 내에서 밝기를 조절하면 되므로 문제가 되진 않는다. (밝기 최대로 땡겨서 했더니 문제 없었다) 게임을 다 플레이하고 Extras의 gallery에 들어가니 아트워크들이 있었다. 개인적으로 게임보다 이 아트워크의 분위기가 훨씬 매력적이었다. 본 게임의 추레한 스토리에 비해서 아트워크들이 불러일으키는 상상력이 훨씬 전율을 줬다.

Och, jakbym chciał częściej być tak zaskakiwanym!

Gra uwodzi nieskomplikowaną, nieco bajkową grafiką i ogólną tajemniczością. Gracz wcielając się w rolę głównego bohatera ma na początku wrażenie, że gra jest skierowana raczej do tej młodszej części społeczności, jednak wraz z rozwojem wydarzeń, wrażenie to szybko znika. Fabuła nie jest tutaj najważniejsza, bo jak się okazuje w finale, historia głównego bohatera jest już zapisana. Jego podróż przez bajkowy świat nie ma większego sensu, choć można doszukiwać się znaczeń i ""drugiego dna"" niemal w każdym momencie gry.

Nie jestem szczególnie wrażliwy, jednak po raz pierwszy po ukończeniu gry logicznej czułem się wzruszony. Historia - mimo tego, co napisałem wyżej - jest poruszająca. Poza emocjami gra oferuje dość sporo wyzwań logicznych, nie są one jednak jakoś specjalnie trudne i raczej rozgrywka skupia się na zręcznościowym aspekcie grania. Zwykle chodzi o to by zdążyć przed upływem czasu (np. zamykające się drzwi, skorzystanie z platformy dostępnej tylko przez kilka sekund od aktywacji), ale czasami trzeba troszkę pomyśleć. Nie uważam jednak grę za specjalnie trudną. Gracz otrzymuje bardzo subtelne wskazówki, które spokojnie wystarczają, by rozgryźć wszystkie niuanse głównego wątku. Miłośnicy znajdziek, sekretów i innych tego typu ""wyzwań"" również znajdą coś dla siebie. Mamy tutaj kilka kategorii przedmiotów do odnalezienia, bez których grę również można ukończyć. 

Muzyka bardzo ładnie wpisuje się w całość rozgrywki i buduje nastrój. Jeżeli mam się przyczepić do czegoś konkretnego to przyczepię się do dźwięków wydawanych przez kompana głównego bohatera: liska, który pełni rolę przewodnika przez sporą część gry. Urokliwe zwierzę szybko traci atrybuty miłego zwierzaka, kiedy zniecierpliwione wydaje z siebie szczeknięcia (mające zapewne naprowadzić gracza na swoją pozycję), które - wydawane zdecydowanie za często - szybko irytuje i zabiera grającemu frajdę eksploracji zakamarków całkiem dopracowanego, szczegółowego świata.

Grę przeszedłem, ale - jak to się mówi - nie na 100%. Na pewno do niej wrócę, bo jest tego warta. Może zakończenie nie będzie już tym samym zaskoczeniem, ale czasami to nie cel podróży jest najważniejszy, ale droga do niego.",1588705238,1588705297,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Il est bel et bien destiné à un panel de joueurs sensibles à la poésie et à la direction artistique, et j'en fais complètement partie.
Seulement voilà, passé ces notions très réussies, que reste t'il à RiME ? Aucune action, très peu de réflexion... en résumé : aucun challenge. Reste le côté exploration, qu'on pourrait toujours apprécier à condition d'y trouver des compétences utiles au gameplay, mais ce n'est pas le cas : explorer la carte dans les moindres recoins ne sert qu'à collectionner des goodies qu'on débloque une fois l'histoire terminée.
En revanche, l'histoire est vraiment très réussie, ravissante, émouvante, dans un univers qu'on sait être un purgatoire, et on reste pourtant très surpris par la fin (au fond, aucun jeu vidéo ne nous avait pris comme ça par les sentiments).
Mais au moment de l'évaluation, je réponds juste à cette question, essentielle pour moi dans un jeu : est-ce que je me suis vraiment amusé ? Non pas vraiment, je me suis même parfois bien ennuyé.

The music is probably the best part of it. However, it does have some really annoying flaws. It has no ""Collectible"" mode.

And there are a lot of them, and they're usually out of the way, so it's unlikely you'll get a lot of them just playing through the game. 
You can't skip cinematics (and some of them are just irritating). 
The controls can be a bit finicky (for example, if you are moving along a ledge, sometimes instead of left you need to press up, even though a second ago you were pressing left - because the camera changed a little).
In the end I replayed it for the collectibles not because I wanted to, but because I'm a bit OCD. I could just as well not replayed it again - it doesn't have high replay value.

[u]    Потрясающее приключение на живописном ярком острове с достаточной разнообразной фауной, загадочными развалинами и толикой таинственности[/u]. Богатое на детали путешествие радует как графикой, её стилем и качеством, так и проработкой мира до мелочей. Главный герой очень корректно реагирует на окружение, например, мне очень понравилась  естественность  движения персонажа в моментах, когда воды ему чуть ниже колена. Он всё ещё может бежать, но делать это начинает прыжкообразно с высоким подъёмом ноги. Наверняка немало людей поймут, о чём речь, если пытались бегать на подобном мелководье. В таких местах становится тяжело и медленно бежать  привычным образом и наиболее оптимальный «бег» становится именно таким. Нигде больше я не видел, чтоб авторы учитывали этот момент движения персонажа, а тут не поленились и сделали! И вот такого внимания к деталям в игре хватает.
    Игра без единого слова лишь визуальными средствами постепенно рассказывает историю, периодически разбавляя повествование простенькими головоломками. Разве что сам герой пользуется своим голосом, дабы активировать некоторые игровые объекты. Создателям очень хорошо удаётся побудить игрока сопереживать происходящему. Вас ждёт богатая гамма эмоций! В ходе путешествия не выйдет заблудиться или надолго застрять с решением какой-либо задачки, тут всё наглядно и понятно, а лис постоянно направляет героя. Тут так же понятно куда можно забраться, а уж если можно, то обязательно стоит! Вообще местное повествование похоже на несколько расширенный вариант визуальной новеллы: вроде исследуешь  локации, ищешь предметы и тайные места, но тебя постоянно направляют, и поверьте, в контексте данной игры это очень органично!
    Помимо прочего, я просто обязан отметить музыкальное сопровождение. Музыка подобрана отлично и всегда помогает создать нужное настроение и атмосферу в каждый момент сего произведения! А финальную композицию хочется услышать вновь!
    В конце я должен отметить единственную спорную вещь: управление меняется в зависимости от направления игровой камеры, а не от направления взгляда героя. Например, если герой плывёт и камеру сместить на вид спереди, но чтоб дальше плыть вперёд, то есть теперь в направлении камеры, нужно нажимать обратную кнопку. И, казалось бы, всё лаконично и правильно, но при подъёме по уступам камера фиксируется сбоку, но мир то трёхмерность не теряет! Из-за положения камеры порой кнопки движения резко меняются. Если при зажатии кнопки протагонист двигается в одном направлении, то после прохождения угла может резко поползти в обратном. В принципе, мелочь, но озвучить должно.
[b]Итог: 
Это совершенно определённо игра для всей семьи. Каждый тут найдёт что-то для себя. Детям наверняка понравится визуальный стиль. А взрослые точно проникнутся историей.
Рекомендую насладиться этой игрой, 7 часов пролетят быстро и вряд ли кого-либо оставят равнодушным! [/b]

P.s. для тех кто не боится спойлеров или для тех, кто с игрой уже ознакомился тут несколько расширенное [u]мнение[/u]:
[spoiler]     На самом деле остров - это своего рода лимб, метафора произошедших событий. Этот мирок создало сознание отца героя после трагедии, пропустив через призму подсознания родной остров и игрушки сына. Маяк острова - явный прообраз монументальной башни лимба со всеми сопутствующими строениями. Ветряные мельницы являются помесью маяка и игрушки-вертушки. Кораблик привнёс множество обломков по всему острову. Остальные игрушки стали частью живого наполнения острова, и это не только фауна! Сюда же относится эфемерный спутник - лисёнок, птица пустыни с резным белоснежным клювом и двуногие исполины.
   Повествование чётко поделено на пять этапов принятия смерти  мальчика, становясь всё более мрачными по ходу истории. Честно сказать, до самого конца создаётся стойкое впечатление именно лимба, посмертного мира, созданного шокированным сознанием ребёнка. Но нет, детали мира намекают именно о горе родителя. На постаментах отсутствует именно фигура мальчика, а весь мир как будто создан и ждал именно его. История из замочных скважин повествует о нелёгкой судьбе отца, который души не чаял в ребёнке и всячески о нём заботился. Множество деревянных игрушек тоже явно сделаны им для любимого чада, оттого их образы очень живо находят отражение в этом мире. Потеря жены спустя несколько лет после появления малыша была тяжким ударом, который оставил камень грусти в душе. И вот новое горе, шторм в открытом море нарушил планы рыбалки и воды поглотили ребёнка. После длительной депрессии, отец всё же принимает происходящее и готов жить дальше.

이야기는 해변에 떠밀려온 한 소년으로부터 시작한다.
소년은 여우를 따라 탑의 꼭대기로 나아가고, 주인공보다 항상 앞서 있는 ‘의문의 남자’와도 가까워진다. 퍼즐 스테이지가 변화할수록 소년은 이별을 겪고, 마침내 그 또한 밤하늘로 날아가면서 작품은 마무리된다.

무언의 울림이란 이런 것일까.
말 한 마디 없었음에도 작품에 정말 깊이 집중할 수 있었고, 덕분에 제작진이 전하는 메시지가 더 뜻깊게 다가왔다. 기본적으로 작품은 소년의 상황에 따라 변화하는 노래와 아름다운 그래픽을 선사하며, 힐링이라는 요소를 발산하고 있다. 또한 한 단계씩 진전하며 맛보는 약간의 컷신들과 수집 요소들은 플레이에 소소한 재미를 준다. 무엇보다도 퍼즐과 어드벤처라는 장르를 잘 조합시켜 차분함과 역동성을 동시에 뽑아낸 점이 인상깊었다.

Я не собрала ничего практически, не до этого было. Сама игра шла легко, она затянула меня так, что хотелось пройти ее снова. Но после конца игры я об этом еще раз 100 подумаю надо ли мне это.

Касательно самой истории. Не верьте трейлеру и описанию. Вот вообще. Это все описывает лишь процентов 20 от всей игры. В самом начале вы даже не знаете, что вас ждет дальше. Для особо эмоциональных, типа меня, совет - запаситесь успокоительным или салфетками. Серьезно.

Yalnızlığı tanımlamak ne kadar doğru bilmiyorum. Söze dökmek, okuduklarında kendini bulmak herkesin içinde yaşayacağı bir deneyim. Hiçbir zaman sona ermeyecek bir yalnızlığı ise kelimeye yansıtmak en zoru olsa gerek çünkü yaşamadan öğrenilemeyecek derecede ağır ve içinizde yaşamak zorunda kalacağınız karanlık bir taraf oluşturuyor.
 
Kırmızı, yırtık bir pelerin ne kadar anlamlı olabilirse, o kadar anlamlı olmuş. Tequila Works ve QLOC’ın ellerine sağlık! Sonsuz bir özlemin başlangıcını anlatan ve her şeyi yavaşça anlayan çocuksu bir ruhla çizilmiş bir hikaye, RiME. Orijinal bir öykü olmasının yanı sıra onlarca duyguya dokunan içinizde bir yerlerde size kendini hissettirmeyi başaran harika bir çalışma olarak karşımızda. Hepimizin yalnızlığına bir parça müzik, anı, resim, manzara... ortak olmuyor mu? RiME da bunlardan birisin olabilir sizin için!

Grafiklerden ve oynanıştan kısaca bahsetmek istiyorum. Yine beni kendine çeken her oyunda olduğu gibi her detaya dikkat etmeye çalışarak oynadım. RiME, Unreal Engine tabanlı bir oyun ve harika bir grafik kalitesine sahip. Bu kısımda grafiklerin ve oluşturulan manzaraların ne kadar iyi olduğunu anlamak için SS’lerimden bazılarına göz atabilirsiniz. Sahile vuran kırmızı pelerinli bir çocuğu oynamaya başladığımız bu puzzle-solving tarzı oyunda, bulmaca ve sırlar sizi sıkmayacak seviyede ayarlanmış ve en önemlisi tekrar tekrar çözmek zorunda kalacağınız döngüden kendini kurtarmış bir şekilde dizayn edilmiş. Oynanışı bu denli kolaylaştıran ve görselleri ile gözümü gönlümü doyuran RiME gibi bir bir önceki yapıtın adı Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice idi. Bunu buraya not ediyorum. Bulmacaları çözerken sıkılmıyor oluşunuz hikayeyi geri planda kalmaktan alıkoyuyor. RiME’ın en güçlü yanlarından biri de bu!

Sinematikler! Hikayenin ne olduğunu anlamanız için yeterli sayıda ve doğru kesitleri kullanarak oluşturulmuş. Bu kısımda senaryoyu oynanıştan ayırmadan ilerlemenizi sağlayan öğelerden biri olarak karşımıza çıkıyor ve yeterli sayıda olduğunun altını çizmek istiyorum. 

RiME’ın puzzle dünyası gördüğüm en harika ve en başarılı puzzle dünyası değil ama arka arkaya gelen puzzle’ların birbirini tekrar etmeyişi ve büyük resme bakmamızı sağlayacak yapısı taktiri hak ediyor kesinlikle. 

Kontrolleri çok basit bir oyun. Ben Xbox One Controller ile oynadım ama klavyeden de çok ama çok rahat oynanabilecek kalibrede tasarlanmış. 

Ve tabiki müzikler, tıpkı Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ya da Hellblade:Senua's Sacrifice'de olduğu gibi güzel manzara ve müziği bulunca ihya oluyorum desem yeridir. RiME için de aynısı geçerli! Beni gülümseten bir tesadüfü anlatayım kısaca. Yıllardır müzikle ilgilenen ve oyun müziklerini ayrı dinleyen araştıran biri olarak, oyunu bitirir bitirmez soundtrackleri baştan dinlemek için spotify, youtube araştırmaya başladım. Karşıma çıkan sonuç: David Garcia Diaz. İsim olarak yabancı gelmiş olabilir ama Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice’ın soundtracklerini çalışan kişi kendisi. 2017’de RiME’ı yaptıktan sonra 2018’de Hellblade için repertuar çalışması hazırlamış ve şunu söylemek gerekir: Bu oyuna can veren, nefes almasını sağlayan melodiler çalışmış. İlgilisi için soundtracklerin bulunduğu çalma listesini buraya bırakıyorum: https://open.spotify.com/album/4Vmv5JMd2k5ZweNMUugzqo?si=gkYKoGlkRlG2EOM4alBhsQ

Peki oyunun hiç mi kötü tarafı yok? Tabiki var, bazı puzzle’lar (benim için sadece 1 tanesi) rahatsızlık verecek seviyede değil ama hadi çözeyim devamını göreyim raddesinde uzundu. Bunun dışında oyundaki collectible item dediğimiz toplanan öğelerin oyuna katksını oyun sonunda anlıyorsunuz. Oynanışa bir artısı yok. Bunu oyunun yarısına gelmeden fark ettim ve hikayeyi çok sevdiğim için her şeyi toplayayım hissiyatına çok düşmedim. Mapleri biraz daha içli dışlı oynarsanız, her şeyi bulmak mümkün! Bir de benim için tek “cons” yorumu oyunun başında RiME’ı tanıtan ilk oynanış hamlelerinin oyunu anlatmak için yeterli olmaması. Biraz daha açık olmak gerekirse,  Papo&Yo, A Story About My Uncle vs. gibi oyunların hikaye tabanlı puzzle-solving indie’ler olduğunu biliyorum, RiME'ın da bu tarz bir oyun olduğunu biliyordum ama her oyunun kendi fiziği ve oyun ritmi mevcut bu kısımda RiME diğer güzel özelliklerinin gölgesinde bıraktığı oyuna alışma süreci yaşatıyor oyuncuya. Benim açımdan bu önemli bir detay olduğu için bahsetmek istedim. 

Sonuç olarak, özlem, yalnızlık, sevgi ve daha bir çok hissiyatı 5-7 saatlik bir oynanışın içine sığdırmış, benim gibi tek oturuşta bitirebileceğiniz bir yapıda size sunmuş olan bu hikayenin bir parçası olmalısınız. Kırmızı bir pelerin ne kadar anlamlı olabilir? Bir çocuk kör bir umutla bilinmezliğin içinde ne kadar mutlu olabilir? Deniz ve martının sesi 5-7 saat arayla nasıl farklı hissettirebilir? İnsana derin bir nefes çektirip, gözlerini yaşartan bir sona maruz bırakan bu oyunu oynamanızı tavsiye ederim!

Keyifli oyun zamanları diliyorum!

They're not really platformers, even though you spend a lot of time climbing and jumping.  There are environmental puzzles to an extent, but they don't feel like full-on puzzle games either.  And you're actually doing something, so they're definitely not walking simulators.  

We like to put names on things, and these games kind of defy categorization.  Each one is its own unique self-contained experience.  For that reason they might just be tough to make, too.  

Is this true?  Explain yourselves, developers!

This particular one lands somewhere between NaissanceE and Ico, which is a pretty good place to be.  It's not as pure and abstract as NaissanceE, nor as grounded in narrative structure as Ico.  

Like Ico, you play as a little kid who's not the slightest bit afraid of heights; but for all of the acrobatics, what they're really focused on here is creating a certain mood.  To do this they rely heavily on one of the most difficult and underappreciated skills in storytelling: knowing when to shut up. 

You wake up on a beach, alone.  A less confident game would immediately start dumping text onto you--maybe a flowery poem or a cryptic quote or something--to tell you how to act and feel; or even worse, they'd give you a chattering companion to follow you around like a nervous salesman trying to close the deal.
  
Not here, mercifully.  Just you, the wind, the waves, the rustling grass, the seagulls, some low-key music and the sun rising and setting as you head out to explore this strange new island on your own.  It's a totally different sort of immersion.  The game simply creates a space and invites the player to reach out and fill it.  Without saying a word they make you want to investigate every last corner; but not in a hurry.  This style slows you down to a point where you feel really present in this place.

They do speak to you along the way, but it's a visual sort of language, subtle little signposts of meaning that offer both guidance and new questions.  The little ""i"" up there in the title, for instance, is like that because it's supposed to look like a keyhole, a theme that shows up throughout the white tower that serves as the game's physical and figurative axis.  Other elements like the fox and the red cape appear to draw your eye and pull you gently down the game's path; and the road changes a lot as you go. 

At the beginning things seem perfectly tranquil.  Time and time again I found myself stopping just to listen and watch, looking out over some magnificent ocean vista.  Seriously, this first part is just absolutely gorgeous. At one point you interact with a puzzle that causes the whole sky to wheel around you, and I actually said out loud, ""wow!"" 
 
Arrive at the next section, though, and and the tranquility gives way to a frenetic, hunted tension.  Each new level brings with it a similar shift in tone.  By the time you get to the rain section, the atmosphere of crushing sorrow is so thick you practically choke on it. 
 
If you're more perceptive than I am, it might dawn on you at some point that there's a coherent purpose to what they're doing here; but rest assured they explain everything in the end and it makes perfect sense.

So while you might be thinking that this whole thing sounds awfully ""artsy,"" they're not being pretentious about it at all.  It comes across as very sincere and heartfelt, like the authors had a genuine vision they wanted to convey.  They really are trying to show you something, not obscure it behind a cloud of oh-so-cleverness like some games do.

Of course, it'll surprise no one that the story is ultimately geared to make you feel bad.  That's pretty much par for the course with these things, huh? 
 
I wonder if that lingering bittersweet aftertaste is part of why this game doesn't seem to get talked about as much as, say, Ico.  Although Ico also had a more overtly personal story, too, with the girl and all that, whereas this one is more allegorical; so maybe Ico is a little easier to connect with in that sense.  Plus, nothing here quite matches that drawbridge scene, which was one of the most brilliant examples of visual storytelling you'll ever see in a game. 
 
Still, it's a worthy addition to the whatever-you-call-it genre.

And hey, developers take note: they managed to build this entire game of mystery and wonder without including a single sewer level.  Was that so hard?

Rime ha dalla sua un'indubbio fascino visivo, grazie allo stile architettonico delle rovine, ai colori vivi e ad alcuni effetti visivi, ma è carente sul fronte ludico e di ottimizzazione dell'Unreal engine, che a meno di non avere una scheda recente, anche a impostazioni minime non darà mai una totale sensazione di fluidità e la cosa appare parecchio ingiustificata.

Inizialmente, l'impressione rimane comunque molto positiva nel nostro girovagare per la zona iniziale, tra spiaggia, sottopassaggi e alture, purtroppo, quello che Rime esaurisce in breve tempo è il ritmo. Il gioco mostra una certa linearità, nascosta malamente dietro alcuni collezionabili poco utili, un paio di zone di scarsa visibilità/riparo da attraversare e in generale a rompicapi di basso livello, che altro non fanno se non rallentare ""l'esperienza"". Il gioco infatti avrebbe velleità narrative, benché la storia sia abbastanza modesta e prevedibile, vorrebbe imitare alcuni noti e sopravvalutati titoli dell'era Ps2/Ps3, e al pari di alcuni di essi non riesce a tenere vivo l'interesse, per via di una struttura incerta sul quanto essere gioco e quanto essere racconto. 

Le meccaniche sono poche, piuttosto familiari e stantie. Ci potremo arrampicare su alcune sporgenze in stile Assassin's Creed, senza neanche lontanamente avere la stessa divertente quantità di appigli e libertà di scelta, potremo spostare alcuni piccoli blocchi alla Zelda, ruotare alcuni posti di osservazione per sbloccare delle porte, giochicchiare raramente con un globo per cambiare l'orario e, quando consentito, usare un gorgheggio in stile Sirenetta Disney, per interagire con un paio di statue, globi ed oggetti, anche quando un colpo di bastone sarebbe altrettanto efficace... se ci venisse permesso. Un elemento, quello del canto, quantomeno più personale e presente degli altri, e che meritava per questo più coraggio e fantasia nella sua implementazione.

Forse, per quanto banale, qualche nemico in più sarebbe stato utile. Gli sporadici intermezzi risulteranno piacevoli e l'esagerato cielo stellato del veloce ciclo giorno/notte è uno spettacolo da vedere, ma il tutto viene penalizzato dal poco interesse ad andare avanti. Rime non è un gioco brutto, ma non del tutto riuscito nei suoi obiettivi. Il fatto che al tempo venisse anche solo ipotizzato che potesse concorrere con Breath of the Wild, appare più che mai comico. 

Detto questo, un voto negativo è probabilmente troppo severo, penso che Rime sia un onesto indie da 6,5, tuttavia, trovo pure che la media sia veramente ingannevole verso i giocatori.",1584952934,1584970320,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Respuesta corta: Sí, pero rebajado. 

Respuesta larga:

Compré el juego sin conocer el estudio y sin haber escuchado de él en ningún sitio. Me llamó la atención estéticamente y como estaba rebajado y tenía unos euros en la cartera lo pillé por probarlo. 

El juego no supone ningún reto, es muy sencillito, pero la verdad es que la ambientación y la música es espectacular. A pesar de ser muy fácil, es muy divertido de jugar, ya que lo que pretende no es darte un reto sino mostrarte cosas y eso lo hace genial. Bebe mucho del team ICO este juego y se nota, pero en plan bien. 

El juego es muy cortito, 4 horas y pico me ha durado a mi, pero han sido unas 4 horas en las que no me he podido despegar del mando, cosa que no me ocurría desde hacía mucho tiempo. Son 4 horas que valen oro, pero aun así me parece un precio excesivo 35 euros por 4 horas de juego. Pilladlo de oferta. 

Me sorprendió mucho el final cuando vi los créditos y vi que estaba hecho por españoles, me alegra mucho que un equipo español demuestre que puede hacer cosas a la altura del panorama.

Rime è un puzzle-platform che va a toccare nei suoi 5 capitoli le varie fasi del lutto, ti ritroverai nei panni di questo ragazzo che naufraga su un'isola, ti sentirai disorientato, perché nessuno ti dice cosa fare, non ti aspetti questo, come quando perdi una persona a te cara.
Soggettivamente ho trovato RIME dal punto di vista emotivo un gioco che ha saputo farmi piangere anche dopo la quarta volta che ho giocato il finale.

Aspetti positivi:
-Musica: la colonna sonora è eccezionale, azzeccata in ogni suo minimo particolare sia tecnicamente che nella scelta del posizionamento nel gameplay, essendo un produttore probabilmente campionerò qualcosa per farci una traccia;
-Grafica: la grafica è molto semplice ma è proprio questa la sua forza, pulita, senza troppe pretese;
-Gameplay: all'inizio si rimane un po' spaesati, perché non c'è nessun UHD nello schermo, niente che ti da consigli o ti dica esattamente cosa tu debba fare, ma dopo qualche minuto di gioco si inizia a comprendere il tutto. Mi ha colpito molto la varietà degli enigmi che fino alla fine sono riusciti sempre a trovare qualcosa di nuovo per non annoiare il giocatore. Il platform è semplice, non è di quelli che devi stare 30 minuti ad arrabbiarti, trovo che nel contesto del gioco ci stia bene.
-Dialoghi e narrativa: nel gioco NON ci sono dialoghi, ed è proprio questo il bello, rime penso che non possa definirsi come un gioco ma un'opera d'arte, in quanto opera d'arte deve lasciare spazio all'interpretazione di chi la vede dall'esterno, il silenzio vale più di mille parole e gli sviluppatori hanno saputo giocare molto bene questa loro chiave.
-Esplorazione: In quanto ad esplorazione è veramente vasto sopratutto per quanto riguarda strade secondarie per prendere il collezzionabile di turno.
-Emotività: Come ho detto prima dal punto di vista emotivo è molto forte, perché finché non arrivi alla fine (tranne qualche flashback tra un capitolo e l'altro) ti rimane sempre questo alone di mistero che non capisci bene che cosa sia successo di preciso e l'impatto finale è un qualcosa che ti fa venire i brividi.

Aspetti negativi:
-Ottimizzazione: Iniziamo con il più grande dei problemi, l'ottimizzazione su PC è veramente di bassa qualità, Unreal engine sfruttato malissimo sotto questo punto di vista, anche con schede video di fascia alta difficilmente tocchi i 60 fps e a volte si hanno cali veramente drastici (sopratutto nel capitolo 2). Una mia cara amica lo ha giocato su xbox e ha detto che lì è tutto ok, probabilmente è un gioco che è stato ideato per console e trasportarlo su computer ha rivelato dei problemi;
-Caricamenti: Anche questi risultano essere abbastanza lenti, non troppo, ma rispetto alla media di altri giochi anche molto più complessi ci si aspetta di più. L'animazione che si vede appena si apre il gioco dura un sacco di tempo e solo dopo 25 ore di gioco ho capito che la si poteva comodamente skippare con SPACE (non sempre però funziona);
-Achievement: a volte mi è capitato che mi si buggassero un paio di achievement e quindi di dover ricaricare l'ultimo checkpoint per rifarlo;
-Luce e luminosità: ci sono dei trigger della luce che sono gestiti male, ti ritrovi da un passo all'altro a un ambiente con una determinata color correction a una totalmente diversa, personalmente mi ha dato un po' di fastidio. La luce in certi punti è veramente ridotta al minimo e si vede poco e niente, in certe fasi di gioco consiglio di aumentarla un po' dalle impostazioni grafiche;
-Collisioni: In certi punti il gioco pecca nel realismo delle collisioni, a volte fai salti di pochi cm e ti aggrappi a non so quale sporgenza lontana di metri e altre volte accade il contrario. Nel capitolo 4 in certi punti la pioggia trapassa dei tetti coperti, sempre nel medesimo capitolo ti cadono macerie addosso ma il nostro protagonista le trapassa come se niente fosse, avrei gradito almeno una animazione del personaggio che si ripara ad esempio;
-Rigiocabilità: Sinceramente mi sono un po' annoiato nelle mie ultime ore per platinarlo, non è di sicuro un gioco che tu possa rigiocare più di 2 volte, quindi se lo volete finire consiglio di farlo tutto in 2 tentativi.

Tiriamo le conclusioni:

RIME è un gioco che consiglio con tutto il cuore, sopratutto se avete appena perso una persona a cui eravate molto legati.
Gli aspetti negativi che ho citato prima sono infimi rispetto a quello che emozionalmente ti lascia a mio parere, un gioco che chiunque dovrebbe giocare e dovrebbe avere nella propria libreria.
Il gioco dura dalle 5 alle 6 ore.
Un po' altino il prezzo, consiglio di prenderlo in sconto, io ho fatto un affarone prendendolo a 2 euro e qualcosa.

Consigli:
Io per gusto personale l'ho platino senza l'uso di tutorial, ma cercando online su youtube ne ho trovato uno molto valido, il canale si chiama: PS4Trophies, parla un inglese molto comprensibile, ma se proprio lo volete in italiano vi consiglio la guida di ""Il Vault di Jess"", il suo video dura 4 ore ma spiega tutto nel dettaglio ed è una ragazza molto simpatica.

La longevità è buona se come me fate la seconda run per prendere i collezionabili che avete mancato la prima volta, altrimenti vi durerà al max 5-6 ore non di più.

Puzzle platform 3D indie, senza troppi dettagli dedicati a menu, interfaccia o altro. Dalla complessità crescente, RiME pian piano intavola anche una trama particolare tramite statue, animali, disegni sulle mura degli edifici e brevi cutscenes. Quasi ogni angolo di ogni mappa è esplorabile e ciò permette al giocatore di passare il tempo a risolvere anche enigmi secondari e di ragionare sul percorso seguito prima di passare per la strada principale. 

La difficoltà non è alta, ma serve comunque ragionarci un po' per capire cosa fare. La colonna sonora e la grafica rendono il tutto ancora più bello, fino all'ultimo momento in cui si capirà esattamente il senso della storia (facendo cadere anche qualche lacrimuccia). Completabile in 5-6 ore nei suoi 4 capitoli, non penso valga comunque il prezzo pieno di 34,99€. 10€ sarebbe un prezzo ragionevole, per premiare anche gli sviluppatori. Lo si trova anche a meno.

It's also an amazingly intuitive game. I an only assume that the designers did a ridiculous amount of playtesting to make every element of the game immediately clear. There was literally only one time in the entire game when I spent any time wandering around with no clear goal. This is despite it being a game with no tutorial, no dialogue, and with puzzles that feature teleportation and other elements that make that even more difficult.

That out of the way, this is a puzzle game. The puzzles are a mix of figuring how to get from one place to another by climbing and jumping, or making use of devices and objects in the world to do something. The best comparison I can think of is something like Tomb Raider or Enslaved: Odyssey to the West without the combat.

The plot is great, if you don't mind allusive mythopoetic nonsense. If you demand a plot be a group of opposed people trying to accomplish divergent goals or some such thing, then you'll be disappointed.

先说缺点：游戏卡顿，偶尔30fps，最差17fps。玩到后期容易穿模，过场动画读不出来，直接黑屏，只能退出重进。

我不是专业玩家。但我感觉这种游戏和《Journey 风之旅人》，《ABZÛ 智慧之海》属于同类型。到处是尘封的建筑，一片破败的景象，没有对话，玩家通过声音跟物品互动，来完成解谜。唯美却又孤独。


【剧透慎入】游戏没有明显剧情，下面都是个人猜测。

两个世界讲的是同一件事。
表面世界讲的 是，在一个小岛上，国王和皇后孕育了一个小男孩。小男孩长大后母亲生病死了，父亲很伤心。有天小男孩出海没有回来，国王以为小男孩死了。负面情绪爆发，化成乌云笼罩整个小岛。岛上的居民也变成黑色的灵体。后来小男孩漂流回岛上，在红帽（母亲？）的指引，小狐狸，机器人的帮助下，他决定到白色的塔里去，打开灯塔的照明灯，驱散小岛的阴影。
里面世界讲的是，父亲是个渔夫，有次和小男孩一起出海，小男孩掉进海里，父亲想拉他上来，却只扯上来一只红色袖子 。这件事在父亲心中一直挥之不去。而出现在表世界的，海鸥，野猪，怪鸟，船，风车，还有帮助小男孩的小狐狸，机器人（是风铃），都是父亲送给他的玩具。

白色的塔其实是父亲的内心，塔的上面是锁孔。小男孩从塔顶跳了下来，回到里世界，见到了父亲（虽然无法触及）。最后父亲把小男孩的红袖布放飞，也选择开始面对现实。完。",1582017336,1582017336,True,1,0,0.504132270812988281,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Rime - проект испанской студии Tequila Works.

Сюжет рассказывает историю мальчика, попавшего на остров после кораблекрушения. Ему предстоит раскрыть загадки острова, а поможет ему в этом деле лисёнок.

Давно заглядывался на эту игру и вот наконец-то нашёл время поиграть. Сюжет загадочен и до самого конца не совсем ясно, что же на самом деле происходит. Даже после прохождения игры у меня остались вопросы. Разработчики предоставили игроку пофантазировать на эту тему самому.

Визуальная сторона Rime очень впечатляет. Красивые острова, озаряемые светом солнца и луны, величественные развалины древней цивилизации, подводный мир, мрачные пещеры - аплодирую дизайнерам локаций. Я получил удовольствие от путешествия по дивным местам.

Головоломки в игре достаточно просты, но некоторые заставляют мозги поработать, а так же подключить наблюдательность, чтобы заметить знаки, оставленные создателями игры.

Не могу не отметить музыкальное сопровождение - Дэвид Гарсиа написал волшебные композиции к игре, затрагивающие потаённые струны души.

Недостатков в игре не нашёл.

My thoughts on this game (SPOILERS)
-
-
-
I think the ""boy"" was the father all along, and the entire journey symbolized his journey through the stages of grief. The reason he started out as the boy was because in his mind, he'd rather he had been the one to die in the accident instead of his son, which is why we see the seemingly misdirecting scene at the beginning: it was his denial that started this whole journey. The world is seemingly beautiful and perfect, but there is always that nagging feeling of wrongness, symbolized by the red hooded figure he is always chasing, but can never quite reach. Gradually, anger sets in and the world is a desolate, scorched land plagued by monsters. We also begin to see the dark creatures that symbolize depression and grief. The giant bird represents our psyche that actively tries to fight back and continue our state of denial but as we pull out the stops and let the grief run free (the smoke), this opposing force weakens until we are able to face the fact that something  bad has happened. In the bargaining stage, the dark creatures become hostile but the boy can seemingly fight back against them using the light orbs and the robots, and for a while it seems that the boy could win. That he could change the world back into the sunny place it used to be. But then we see the last of the robots sacrifice itself to open a door into more gloom and darkness, and you see the boy finally break down. The last stage is pretty obviously grief and depression. Instead of lighting torches, you proceed by extinguishing them. There is no light, and the dark creatures leave you be because you are clearly not a threat anymore. As the last of your hope dies (the fox), you stop feeling and become numb (stone). Life feels pointless, you've screamed so much you've lost your voice and you literally become a shadow of yourself. In the last stage, the boy fights to open up the flood gates and let the light back into the world, and finally the truth is revealed and relived. The ""boy"" walks towards the corridor and confronts himself (as the father). He chooses to accept his fate and leaps into the void. The father then gets up and goes to his son's room for the first time in a long time. All the locks the boy opened through out the game culminates in the final, physical act of unlocking the door into the room. Finally, he lets go.",1581734338,1581734338,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Я ненадолго превратился в 9-летнего мальчишку на летних каникулах. При этом история [spoiler]с таким грустным финалом, что невольно задумываешься: если собрать все артефакты, концовка будет другой?[/spoiler] Впрочем от сюжета многого не ждите. За лихим сюжетом я лучше переиграю в Bioshock Infinite.

Геймплей с совсем простенькими, но неназойливыми головоломками. Некоторые паззлы решаются совмещением разрозненных элементов движениями мыши, что можно было наблюдать в The Room 2 и Hellblade. Сложность загадок я бы оценил на 2 из 5. Да, это вам не The Talos Principle и даже не MIND: Path to Thalamus. Я бы не стал называл Rime квестом. Это старый добрый платформер в новой упаковке. 

Но упаковка, надо отметить, получилась выдающейся. Прекрасная чарующая музыка. Невероятной  зрелищности пейзажи со сменой времён суток, роскошными закатами и сказочной звёздной ночью. А море такого цвета, какой бывает только когда ты ребёнок и тебя ничего не заботит. Игру можно есть глазами. По стилистике я здесь почувствовал влияние фильмов Миядзаки, а игровая механика и визуал напомнили Prince of Persia 2008, разве что мечом не пришлось размахивать. Ну а голова двуногого стража вызвала устойчивую ассоциацию с модулями из Portal.    

Из минусов отмечу слабую оптимизацию. Видеокарта 2060 super греется как в Ларе Крофт, а фпс иногда проседает до удручающе низких частот. Также временами колбасит камеру, что приводит к дезориентированию в пространстве. Не слишком критично, но глаз цепляется.

[h1]アクション多目の雰囲気ADV[/h1]
ゲームを終えた感想は面白かったです。ですが、序盤でちょっと中だるみしてしまい「止めてしまおうか」とも思いました。もうちょっとプレイしようと続けてみたら、最終的には最後までやって良かったなと思える作品でした。

ICOやワンダ、Papo & Yo や風ノ旅ビトっぽいというレビューも多くありますが、結構違います。そこはまぁ別のゲームなのであたりまえですが・・・あくまで「似ている」というだけなので、そこに期待しては駄目です。

たしかに「ICO」のように声を出したり、クライミング要素がありますが、雰囲気重視なので物語のワクワク感は「ICO」程ではありません。逆に物語は「風ノ旅ビト」風で会話は一切なし。映像や壁画のイラストだけで物語を読み取っていくタイプですが、「風ノ旅ビト」ほど雰囲気重視になりきれてないといった感じです。

以下少し個人的な文句が多くなりますが、申し訳ありません。


[h1]【〇】雰囲気・音楽・カジュアル[/h1]
やっぱりまず初めに雰囲気でしょう。少しマットなイラスト風グラフィックが物語に非常にマッチしています。どのステージも外の風景、遺跡群などの背景が幻想的で素晴らしいです。

また特に良いのが音楽。これは本当に素晴らしい。すべてのシーンにマッチした壮大な音楽は完璧だったと思います。ゲームも面白かったですが、「音楽が良かったな」という印象の方が強く頭に残るぐらいです。

パズルもそこまで難しくはなく、ちょっと考えればクリアできる程度。説明がないのでやや詰まる所もあるかもしれないが、何度かプレイすればクリアできるはず。

最後の良い所はリトライのしやすさです。
高い所から落ちても、落ちる直前からすぐリトライ。死んでしまうような事があってもすぐに直前から始められます。ストレスなくプレイできるのは良いと感じました。


[h1]【△】導入が良くない[/h1]
私が最初に中だるみして止めそうになった部分……ステージ1とステージ2のマップの広さです。
とにかく広い。何の説明もないので、ひたすらマップを歩き回る事になります。一応ヒントの「キツネ」さんがいて「キツネ」さんがいる場所が目的地だったりするのですが、マップが広すぎてその「キツネ」さんが見つからない。

水中まで潜れる作り込みはちょっと感動して素晴らしいと感じましたが、オープンワールドのゲームではありませんので、やはりそこはストーリーの道しるべが欲しかった。

厳しく感じるのはまだ序盤だという事。何の盛り上がりもないですし、わけもわからずただ広いマップをダラダラと歩かされるのは苦痛でした。
しかしステージ3から丁度良いマップの広さになり、ちゃんと雰囲気とストーリーを追わせる作りになってきますので、なんとか止めずにプレイする事ができました。


[h1]【△】ゲーム性[/h1]
パズルやクライミングアクションの多さも気になる部分です。
ここが「雰囲気重視になりきれてない」と感じた部分で、ちょっと多いと思いました。ゲームの内容的には雰囲気で勝負しても良い内容だと思うのですが……ゲーム性を持たせようとした結果「雰囲気40％ + パズル30％ + クライミングやアクション30％」という感じです。
困った事にパズルとクライミング + アクション部分はあまり面白くないんです……ちょっと残念です。

ちなみにクライミング時に視点が固定される部分も多く、キーボードでは絶妙な「ななめ入力」がやりにくいのでコントローラーでプレイした方が良いかもしれません。キーボード + マウス ではプレイしにくかったです。


[h1]【△】雰囲気[/h1]
雰囲気は良かった点でもあげましたので、基本的には良いのは間違いないです。ですが全体的に暗い部分も多いので、オプションで明るくした方がいいかもしれません。

またこのようなタイプのゲームには珍しく、ステージによっては「昼」と「夜」の変化があります。これが思った以上に良くない。リアルだからいい……のではないのだなと改めて思いました。

雰囲気ゲームは雰囲気を盛り上げるのが最重要。とにかくたとえ「嘘」でも背景やオブジェクトが一番綺麗で幻想的に見える演出をした方が、うっとりとした気分になり映えるのです。
これはアニメと一緒の感覚だと思います。たとえ嘘でも物理法則無視した方がカッコよく見えるというやつです。

つまり「夜」が本当に微妙。せっかくの綺麗な景色なのに、真っ暗で雰囲気が台無しです。例えば夜は植物が光ったり、蛍の様な光が空を舞ったりしていれば……夜なりの雰囲気が楽しめたのでしょう。そのような演出は無くただ真っ暗になるだけです。


[h1]【×】実績・やり込み[/h1]
このようなゲームのレビューで何度か書いた覚えがあります。
個人的な意見にはなりますが、雰囲気ゲームに余計なやり込みはいらないと思います。純粋に雰囲気だけで勝負して欲しいです。

実績に関しては実績に興味がある人だけなので、ほとんどの人には関係ありませんが……結構いろんな実績が用意されています。雰囲気ゲームはクリアしてOKでいいのではないだろうかといつも思ってしまいます。
特に感じたのは雰囲気ゲームで「わざと死ぬような実績」は雰囲気が損なわれますし、不快な気分になってしまいます。


また一番気になった問題は実績ではなく、隠しアイテムです。
とにかく沢山あります。おそらくプレイヤーを楽しませようという考えでしょうが、これがなかなか大変です。しかもこの隠しアイテムは集める事により、物語をより深く知る事ができる「隠しイラスト」を見る事ができます。
本当に小さなオマケ要素です。見る必要は無いかもしれません。ただ、ゲームクリア後にこの絵を見ると「あぁ……なるほど」と少し理解が深まります。

このようにストーリーに関わる要素を別で用意しているのは、あまり好きではありません。プレイヤー全員が平等に同じプレイをすることができないので、「このシーンは○○だよね」という考察や感想を言い合う事ができない……物語を楽しむ雰囲気ゲームとしてはどうかと思います。

一度フォローを入れておきますが、「雰囲気ゲーム」における感想です。RPGやアクションゲームの事を言っているわけではありません。


結局知りたければやり込むしかないのですが……広いマップを探し回ってもなかなか見つからない。わざと崖から落ちて○○する等、本当に隠してあるので大変です。結局わからないから止めてしまう人もいるでしょう。また攻略動画を見るしかない人も出てきます。
これでは純粋に雰囲気ゲームが楽しめません。イースターエッグ等のお遊び要素ぐらいにしておくべきだと思います。

ここが「風ノ旅ビト」や「ABZU」のように「余計な要素なんていらない！雰囲気だけで十分！これで伝えたい事は伝わるんだ！」という思い切りの良さが、このゲームには足らなかったんだなと感じてしまいました。

開発者はプレイヤーに色々と探し回って楽しんでもらおうと考えたのかもしれません。逆効果のように感じます。たまたま私のレビューを読んで頂いた方は「隠しイラストが見れるんだ！」と思ったかもしれません。
ですが残念ながら、クリアしたからそのままアンインストールした人も多いでしょう。折角作った要素がプレイヤーに伝わらずもったいないと思いました。


[h1]最後に[/h1]
最後は熱く語ってしまいました。すいません。
普通にプレイすれば1週クリアは7時間程。やり込みは攻略を見るかで変わりますが、15時間程でしょう。
クリア後はステージセレクトが可能で、どのステージになんのアイテムがあって、いくつ回収したのかという表示は見れます。
イベントシーンのスキップはできませんので、2週目はやや面倒です。

また少し文句が多くなりましたが、クリア後はそれでも遊んで良かったと感じました。それは間違いないです。またパズルやクライミングも好きだよ。マップを歩き回るのも大好きという人にはピッタリな作品だと思います。
中盤からの盛り上がり～エンディングの流れも素晴らしく、決して悪くはないゲームだと思います。
ぜひ最後までプレイして欲しい作品だと思いました。",1581269819,1612219890,True,18,3,0.701565861701965332,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏分为五个场景，每个场景各具特色，而优秀的画面得以让每个场景拥有最强的表现力。游戏画面不是写实风格，但仍能给你如梦如幻的感觉。玩家会在一望无际的海边醒来，在星光璀璨的夜空下奔走，会在飞沙扬砾的荒漠中躲避袭击，会在美轮美奂的遗迹中探索，也会在落日余晖中沉思。几个不同的场景形成了完整的故事，震撼人心。

游戏玩法有很多创意，难度不高，不存在长时间卡关的问题，但有时需要仔细观察或不断试错才能得出正解。玩家需要搜寻物品，开门，调整机关来通关。攀爬也是这个游戏的特色，这让我想起了主机平台的《神秘海域》系列，但手感仍需优化。另外，游戏的昼夜交替也是很棒的设定，有些关卡甚至需要改变昼夜和光照才能通过。

这款游戏有着宏大的背景，讲述了严肃的人生议题——死亡。死亡关乎到每个人，但不是每个人都能从容地面对自己和挚爱的死亡，而如何解决这个终极问题，就是这个游戏想要探讨的。游戏讲述了一个父亲面对女儿去世时的一系列心理过程，而游戏场景就是想象中的幻境或梦境。这位父亲经历了五个阶段（对应五个场景）：“Denial”（抗拒）、“Anger”（愤怒）、“Bargaining”（不甘）、“Depression”（忧郁）和“Acceptance”（释怀）。游戏提出了一个观点，我们面对自己和挚爱死亡的正确方式最终仍然要回归“释怀”。人的死亡不可避免，而在生前给他人带来的感动和陪伴在死后仍然会被人记住，从这个意义上说，死亡是生命的另一种存在形式。所以那一天来临时，我们要释怀，而不是恐惧与愤怒。

“释怀”是一种信仰的力量，在宗教中有很多体现。科学技术可以探索未知，而宗教可以让人们思考终极的哲学问题。所以游戏背后的思想是远优于画面和玩法的。

This game is for people with a strong affinity for visual art and story telling. Are you the kind of person who can decode the ending of The Sopranos, either by yourself or with a couple of hints? Do you love ""Ways of Seeing"" by John Berger? Then this game is probably for you. 

If, like me, you would never, ever in a million years have figured out what happened to Tony Soprano without that Master of Sopranos guy explaining it, or you tried to read ""Ways of Seeing"" and didn't understand WTF Berger was trying to explain and didn't particularly care; then this will probably just be another blah 3rd person platform puzzler. If you like that gaming genre, you might like it, but the controls feel sluggish and unresponsive. I get a strong ""poorly optimised console port"" vibe from it.

The plot in [i]RiME[/i]... exists[1] as far as I can tell and that's about it. Again, this is probably because it is told purely visually, so I'm no doubt missing a lot.

The difficulty of the puzzles (at least as far as I got with it) lies exclusively in decoding the visual cues that explain the mechanics. Once you understand the mechanics that the visuals are trying to communicate, they are utterly trivial. Compare with [i]Talos[/i] or [i]Portal[/i], where the mechanics are explicit, but the logic is challenging. 

[i]The Talos Principle[/i] evoked an incredible, simultaneous combination of joy and melancholy. My emotional response to this game can be summed up as either ""that's pretty"" or ""that's annoying."" YMMV.

I did not enjoy this game.

[1] [b]SPOILERS[/b] [spoiler]My best guess at the plot is: you are a prince. You have been shipwrecked/orphaned/killed (not sure which). You must navigate the ruins of what may or may not have been your kingdom. You are not given much of a reason to do this beyond figuring out what happened to you. You have a pet fox. It is not much help. I got to the windmills level with the big bird. It is pretty obvious you have to activate the windmills to drive off the bird so you can use the golden ball to set the time of day, then stand on the pedestal so yours and the statue's shadows open the portal.[/spoiler] I didn't care enough to bother.

It doesn't just reveal a characters motive, or change the context of what you're doing.

[i]Mała dygresja:[/i]
Uczulam wszystkich, zwłaszcza osoby które ukończyły powyższy tytuł, by nie zdradzali nikomu (zwłaszcza zainteresowanych tym tytułem) zakończenia samej gry, nie oglądajcie filmików w sieci, nie czytajcie poradników do gry, bo stracicie ważny element – po prostu nie, zaufajcie mi w tej kwestii, bo warto!

[h1]Ale do rzeczy:[/h1]

Powyższy tytuł to jeden z tych gier w który powinien zagrać, a co najważniejsze ukończyć każdy gracz, gra jest rewelacyjna na wielu płaszczyznach. A emocje jakie za tym idą są nie do opisania, zwłaszcza finał (koniec) samej gry – zapamiętacie go na długo, to wam gwarantuję.

Ale zacznijmy od początku, w samej grze wcielamy się w postać małego chłopca, który budzi się na tajemniczej wyspie – jedynie co pamięta to że był na morzu w czasie wielkiej burzy, nic poza tym.

Naszym zadaniem będzie, jak już nadmieniłem na początku, eksploracja cudownego świata gry – wyspy na której występują dzikie zwierzęta, tajemnicze ruiny cywilizacji jak również wielka wieża, która z niewiadomych powodów przywołuje nas do siebie.

Tu zaczyna być ciekawie, gra jest skonstruowana w ten sposób by dać graczowi możliwe maksimum swobody, nikt nas nie trzyma za rękę, nie mówi gdzie mamy iść i dlaczego. To gracz ma odkryć tajemnicę, poznawać uroki wyspy, zanurzyć się w ten piękny świat, odszukać w nim ukryte elementy – lecz nie jednokrotnie by przejść dalej, dotrzeć do upragnionego miejsca musimy ruszyć głową i pomyśleć.

Gra bazuje na zagadkach i łamigłówkach rozsianych po całej mapie, co dodaje uroku samej grze i pozwala się wykazać nie tylko zręcznością gracza lecz również logicznym myśleniem.

[h1]Dalej:[/h1]

Pod względem graficznym gra wygląda cudownie, nie jednokrotnie będziecie się zatrzymywać by podziwiać uroki wyspy – biorąc pod uwagę upływ czasu jaki występuje w grze, cały cykl dzień / noc, to będzie coś wspaniałego.

Muzyka również nie odstaje daleko od grafiki, miło pieści nasze uszy, wprowadza gracza w rewelacyjny nastrój, motywujący by grać dalej – klimat jaki przy tym się tworzy jest nie do opisania.

Fabuła, jak sama nasza podróż jest okryta tajemnicą, z czasem poznajemy kolejne jej etapy, które będą wywoływać u nas samych przeróżne emocjonujące doznania idąc w…

..zaprzeczenie, gniew, targowanie, depresja, akceptacja.

[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]

RIME to rewelacyjna gra przygodowa, jest bardzo tania (szczególne w wersji pudełkowej), dająca masę zabawy graczowi odkrywając tajemniczy świat gry, rozwiązując przeróżne zagadki – wywołując u gracza karuzele emocji, która zostanie z nami na długo.

Polecam!

vendo algumas prints e videos de apresentação do game, já esperava que fosse um jogo simples e belo, com jogabilidade comum desse gênero... consegui completar o jogo sem me preocupar em platinar, degustando apenas a história do jogo em 3 Horas registradas na steam.

O Jogo:
No jogo você controla um garoto que acorda em uma ilha sem saber como chegou ali, ao longo do jogo alguns lapsos de memória são preenchidos com lembranças de como ele chegou até lá. o jogo é bem intuitivo, mesmo ele não te dizendo o que fazer não é muito dificil deduzir qual seu objetivo. Você ainda conta com a ajuda de uma raposa que serve de guia espiritual para o garoto. você progride resolvendo quebra cabeças, desvendando segredos, escalando lugares difíceis, interage com objetos para influenciar os NPCs, etc.
O jogo te faz sentir um pouco de angústia com o desenrolar da trama, a trilha sonora é envolvente e condiz com os sentimentos que o jogo quer que você sinta no momento certo... O jogo todo é uma icognita pois você fica o tempo todo tentando entender o universo do mesmo, os motivos para tudo que está acontecendo e qual o sentido do personagem estar inserido nesse universo, você vai avançando e entendo mais e ao mesmo tempo ""desentendendo"" mais, você cria teorias sobre a razão de tudo aquilo e logo derruba suas teorias e cria outras... 

PRÓS:
O jogo tem gráficos bonitos e cartunizados, um capricho para jogos do gênero, a música do jogo completa a obra de arte que é este jogo. A trama me lembrou muito o jogo ""Brothers"", a jogabilidade nos momentos de escalada lembra um pouco o God of War do Playstation, a exploração do cenário lembra um pouco o novo Zelda. O jogo consegue se comunicar com o jogador sem utilizar nenhuma palavra ou texto.

Contras:
O jogo tem sérios problemas na jogabilidade , principalmente nos saltos, é frustrante morrer diversas vezes por um erro que não é seu, o jogo simplesmente não reconhece sua intenção de pular de um ponto a outro de forma precisa. em alguns momentos foi possível ver algumas texturas sumindo do cenário e jogo travando me fazendo voltar até o ultimo checkpoint.

O jogo vale a pena, foi um entretenimento digno a mim e minha esposa que pode jogar comigo e auxiliar na resolução de alguns quebra-cabeças.",1580172528,1580172528,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It is the game i took the most screenshots off.

It is a exploration platformer and a relaxing game, the love and dedication of the dev's shows clearly.

If they can bring out more games like these, i will buy all of them :)

Rime has amazing atmosphere, soundtrack, story, art design, music, and vibe. It is a piece of art as much as it is a video game.

That said, before you buy you need to keep the following points in mind -
-Rime is a relatively short game at about 5-6 hours of gameplay.
-Puzzles and jump mechanics make up essentially the entire game. None of them are super challenging. 
-Please don't read anything about the game before playing! This game more than any other I have played is one where you want to go in fresh with no spoilers.
-Prepare to feel some serious feels.

Despite the critics that this game received, I think it is a masterpiece and a model.

Games are not made only of one component anymore, a videogame is a complex opera like a movie. It is made of many things.

RIME is a perfect union of elements, that despite not being excellent taken singularly they create a perfect and wonderful mixture of emotions and feelings.

I would not exaggerate defining this game pure art. What I felt trying this game was wonder above anything else, like usually, only a child is able to feel. And once again Tequila works is able to prove how good it’s storytelling in its games.

I think this time I have really to thank you, thank you for making me play RIME.

It is for sure one of the best indie game of the decade!

RiME is a beautiful game. The landscapes and stunning visuals just ooze a one of a kind atmosphere, developing tonalities that play a part in the larger narrative. It has the capacity to be meditative and small, in moments just a wonder-filled story about a boy encountering a magical island steeped in myth, but also larger than life and compelling if you'll listen.

I've played exploration puzzler games for years, starting with the Myst games when I was a kid, and I have to say that if you're looking for a game to wow you with complexity and crushingly difficult puzzles, that isn't what RiME is about. The puzzles in RiME are a mechanism of the story-telling and while they are often surprising and always fun to interact with, they just don't have that kind of difficulty as an object. That said, if you're looking for a story told in long dialogues and filled with characters verbally developed, this is also not what RiME is about. Instead, RiME is an exercise in the kinds of stories that can be told beyond words, and it tricks you into loving every part of the world that they made along the way.

So please as you play this fantastic game (and you really should!) take it slowly. Explore. Be playful. Take time to experience the world and feel your way through this masterful piece of story-telling. Too many games today tell the same stories, packaged in the same way, or have nothing to say at all. RiME is a breath of fresh air, from a team of developers who took the time to craft something poignant and meaningful.

The levels were imaginative and fun, with about the right length - not too short as to be trite but not too long as to get tedious and boring.  That was helped by the level design with short, varied puzzles/locations so that any one level didn't get too stale.

The only major complaint I have is that the story feels incredibly disjointed, for reasons I can't exactly get far into without possibly saying too much. But basically it's like it set itself up as one thing and then all of the sudden decides it wants to be something else entirely. Which tbf it does kind of makes sense why, but it's more like 2 stories (or 3-ish depending on interpretation) awkwardly stitched together than at least one cohesive one. And one of those stories is still left with holes and kind of confusing.

The puzzles aren't that difficult, but I did get stuck a few times because a gimmick would just add in a new mechanic and just...never bothered to tell you about it, it seemed. Or at the very least when I finally found the solution I just felt embarrassingly dumb rather than having a ""hell yeah"" moment.

It's another I would probably wait for a sale. Though it is pretty to look at and the music is amazing, it's one of those games that's less a game and more of an experience, even if it is an experience that might stick to some people for awhile.

I actually thought I'd given a brief review before, but since I did not one reason for writing it now is because a few days ago I witnessed the funeral of a 13 year old boy (young man).  He developed an infection that rather quickly put him in the hospital.  Within a couple of days more he was comatose and died within a day after that, leaving his family and two sisters just before Christmas.

At some point during all of this maybe I noticed a trading card in my inventory, but for whatever reason I felt a strong connection between the ""kid with fox"" card and the loss of the local boy.  I think that some players perhaps were not satisfied by the amount of action in this game, and if so they may not have appreciated the weight of the last scenes.

I beat it but didn't feel good about it.  8.25 HEY!/AAH!'s out of 10.

There are many (44) collectibles in this game: toys, emblem fragments, outfits, keyholes, strange statues, white shades, and lullaby shells.

I progressively got worse at finding the collectibles as my patience dwindled and as the game became scarier.

As a result, I beat the game in under 6 hours (went AFK with the game open) with a lousy 11/31 achievements unlocked.

Pros
- Great performance (on an i7-9700K & RTX 2070 SUPER at least)
- Great soundtrack (just listen for the subtle changes as you progress)
- Great controls (used both mouse & keyboard and Xbox One controller)
- Visually appealing (solid use of the Unreal Engine)
- The journey, not the destination
- Ability to review all obtained collectibles and additional artwork from the Extras menu

Cons
- Learning the hard way that there were hostiles
- Being gated from the collectibles (accidentally progressing via critical cut scenes and adventuring beyond points of no return)
- Feeling like I did something wrong upon beating the game (probably because I didn't pick up on the story)

To reach them he has must climb, jump and swim to their locations then activate them with his voice.  Once he returns to the meadow a fox is waiting to guide him further on his journey of discovery!
As the boy leaves the meadow he can find hidden paths and places that reveal objects that are part of his story.  He will find some of these are easy to get to while others require much more to reach.

It's a beautiful surreal world to be dropped into and at the beginning I wanted to explore every corner of it, especially when I discovered there are collectibles to find!

Every time you run and stop the boy wobbles and almost falls over, as though he is an uncoordinated toddler rather than... maybe eight, ten years old? When you jump down off anything he takes his time picking himself up. It's just too slow and constantly interrupts your gameplay. I didn't find most of the collectibles because it was too annoying to go looking for them. 

The puzzles were not very hard or very varied. I got 'stumped' for a few minutes at two or three of them. I'm not a hardcore puzzle gamer. 

I had to look up what the story was about after I finished the game, though I got an inkling of it in the last chapter. It still doesn't quite make sense to me. There's a few things that I'm not sure what they are supposed to represent or be symbolic of. I think it was a nice premise that maybe could have been done better. It would have helped to have more clues about what was going on earlier in the game. 

Also I thought the fox would be more useful (like you could have had to duo puzzles with him in some way?) but he just runs ahead to show you the way to the next puzzle and yaps at you when you're going the wrong way.

자꾸 프레임 떨어지길래 설정에만 한 시간을 쏟았는데 알고보니 그냥 발적화였네요


| 미려한 그래픽
| 처음부터 끝까지 심금을 울리는 배경음악
| 직관적이고 길 유도 잘하는 게임 흐름

| 몰입하는데 방해하는 프레임드롭
| 어디선가 본 듯한 퍼즐
| 밸런스 안맞는 효과음
| 실패한 내러티브



[h1]게임 플레이[/h1]
벽을 짚을 수 있는 곳도 직관적이고
길 방향도 여우가 울고 있는 곳이나, 카메라가 방향을 잡아주는 등으로 잘 안내해줘서
웬만한 길치가 아닌 이상 길 잃진 않을 겁니다.

이런 게임들을 자주 접하셨다면
이 게임에선 반갑지 않은 퍼즐들을 접하실 수 있어요
어떻게 보면 익숙하고, 어떻게 보면 낯선 퍼즐들이 많은데
익숙한 퍼즐들은 너무 똑같다고 생각이 들 정도로 너무 비슷해요
그렇다고 낯선 퍼즐들이 그렇게 재밌지도 않고

개인의 차이니까 넘어가죠


[h1]그래픽[/h1]
그래픽은 보시다시피 매우 아름답고 이뻐요
힐링게임 명색에 맞게 미려하고
연출도 정말 좋아요

다만 발적화 때문인지 프레임 드롭이 심해요
경치를 보다가 프레임이 자꾸 떨어지니까
보는 맛도 안나요

당췌 GTA V 기준으로 중상옵 60프레임으로 돌아가는 컴퓨터가
왜 이 게임 중옵이 버벅이는걸까요


[h1]사운드[/h1]
처음부터 끝까지 심금을 울려주는 배경음악이 끝내줘요
왜 이 멋진 OST들을 따로 안파나 싶을 정도로 듣기 좋은데

문제는 효과음들이에요
초반에 문제 없이 잘 돌아가다가 중반부터 자꾸 소리가 지지직거리면서 깨져요
이 것도 역시 경치 구경하는데 되게 짜증을 유발하고
가끔 소리들이 좌우 밸런스도 안맞고
벽뒤에서 나는 효과음 등의 처리도 잘 안되어 있어요

그리고, 여우한테 미안하지만,
제발 여우가 짖는 소리 좀 너프 해줬으면 좋겠어요


[h1]스토리[/h1]
처음에는 무슨 스토리지 매우 궁금하다가도
마지막에 몰아서 떡밥을 회수하니까 참고 엔딩까지 달리면 돼요
중간중간 떡밥 요소들을 잘 기억할 수 있느냐가 관건인데
스토리 구조가 액자 안에 액자가 있고 또 안에 액자가 있는 형식이에요
근데 이 한 액자 스토리가 꽤나 길다보니 그 떡밥 요소들을 기억하기가 난감해요

다행이라면, 다 기억은 못해도 큰 스토리 틀을 이해하는데 문제 없고
2회차 하면 다 이해할 수 있으니까 괜찮다고 봐요


[h1]조작[/h1]
저는 플레이 할 때 컨트롤러(XBOX ONE S)를 사용했어요
조작감은 다 괜찮은데
다만 달리기가 없다는 점이 유일한 단점?
조작에 관해서는 정말 단점을 꼽을 수 없을 만큼 좋았어요

개인적으로 흥얼거리는 버튼을 눌렀을 때 딜레이가 길다는게 싫었는데
그건 제가 긴급한 상황에서 잘못눌러서 그런거니까...
[strike]내 손이 문제[/strike]


[h1]총평[/h1]
예술적으로는 높이 평가하고 싶은 힐링게임이에요
넓은 바다, 푸른 나무
크고 작은, 생동감 넘치는 동물들
멋드러진 인공적인 건축물들
하나하나 다 어울리고 스토리도 아름답고 거기에 감동적인 배경음악까지

뭐하나 빼놓지 않고 잘만들었지만
다만 최적화 부분에서 크게 문제에요
아름다운 풍경앞에서도 ㅆ*하고 욕이 나올정도로
너무 심하게 잔오류들이 이 모든걸 망쳐버니까
다른 사람한테 이 게임을 추천하기에는 계륵인 것 같아요


그래도 개인적으로는 재밌게 했으니 추천은 누릅니다만,
구입을 고민하시다면 조금은 진지하게 고민해보시길 바랍니다.

Auch wenn das Spiel heiter beginnt, merkt man doch schnell, dass hier etwas nicht ganz stimmt. Spätestens wenn die sehr abwechslungsreich gestalteten Level immer düsterer werden und die gefundenen Schlüssellöcher immer weitere Teile der Geschichte mit ein paar Bildern, wie aus einem Märchenbuch, erzählen, weiß man, dass dies keine einfache Reise wird. 

[i]RiMe[/i] kommt ganz ohne ""richtige"" Sprache aus und schafft es allein mit der zauberhaft schönen musikalischen Untermalung, die mir regelmäßig Gänsehaut bereitet hat, und der ebenso atmosphärischen Visualisierung, die Handlung zu erzählen, den Charakteren Leben einzuhauchen und vor allem, jede Menge Gefühle hervorzurufen. Auch die Spielewelt, wirkt trotz des cartoonartigen Grafikstils, mit der Hilfe der vielen und perfekt eingesetzten Soundeffekte, realistisch.

Springen, Klettern, Tauchen, dies ist eigentlich so gar nichts für mich und auch wenn ich nur selten den Xbox-Controller in die Hand nehme, war die Steuerung einfach zu lernen. Aber selbst wenn der ein oder andere Sprung nicht gleich sitzen sollte, gibt es kein ""Game Over"", sondern man bekommt einfach einen weiteren Versuch, was das Spiel sehr frei von Frustmomenten macht. Auch die Rätsel haben einen angenehmen Schwierigkeitsgrad und bestehen meistens aus Schiebe- und Lichträtseln, die ganz ohne Zeitlimit funktionieren. So kann man auch mittendrin innehalten und sich an der minimalistischen aber dennoch detaillierten Umgebung erfreuen oder einfach nur der Hintergrundmusik lauschen und dies ganz ohne das Gefühl zu haben, das Spiel zu unterbrechen oder aus dem Flow zu bringen.

Ich hatte nicht eine Minute das Gefühl, dass [i]RiMe[/i] künstlich gestreckt oder das Tempo zu schnell wurde. Einfach eine sehr ausgeglichene Spielerfahrung. Nur vor jedem, der insgesamt 5 Level, gibt es einen Ladebildschirm, der aber nicht lange dauert und von einer Cutscene abgelöst wird, welche uns dann wieder in die neue Umgebung entlässt. 

Gekämpft wird übrigens in der kompletten Spielzeit nie und unsere zwei treuen Begleiter helfen uns, nicht den roten Faden zu verlieren, wenn wir auf Entdeckungstour gegangen sind. Denn [i]RiMe[/i] schafft es wirklich das Gefühl zu vermitteln, als Kind die Welt zu erkunden und die Level laden gerade dazu ein, den Hauptweg zu verlassen.

Die Sammelgegenstände sind zwar optional, aber um die ganze Handlung in den Leveln mitzubekommen und das vollständige Ende zusehen, braucht man sie. Diese kann man nach Abschließen des Spiels aber in der Levelauswahl im Menü leicht nachholen. Dort gibt es auch eine umfassende Galerie der Artworks, des Soundtracks, der Sammelgegestände und der unterschiedlichen Skins des Protagonisten.

Die von anderen Reviewern beschriebenen Performance-Probleme gab es bei mir nie. Lediglich die Kameraeinstellung hat ab und an mal Schwierigkeiten bereitet.

But this turned out to be wrong as the buoy was really slippery and it was a struggle to hang onto. He told the girl he was too tired to get back to land safely and she basically just said 'ciao' and ditched him. He struggled back to shore only to fail and he began to drown.

However, the gameplay and story fall flat for me. The puzzles are shallow and reminiscent of every other puzzle game in existence (moving boxes, basic platforming, borrowing Journey's voice mechanic, etc.). Because of the lack of dialogue, the story is entirely told through occasional cinematics and environmental storytelling. Unfortunately, these things aren't executed as well as in many other games that use them, and for the majority of the game you're left guessing at what's really going on. I came up with my own interpretation of the story based off of the scraps of information the game provided, and was unsatisfied when the full story was essentially packed into the last 5 minutes and clashed with what I thought was going on. Even after the game was finished, I had to look up the synopsis of the game to answer the question: ""What happened?"" Even understanding now what the game is about, there are certain elements that are still confusing. 

[spoiler] This game is meant to represent the 5 stages of a father's grief over his son. Okay, cool concept. But there's just not enough concrete storytelling to have everything in the game make sense with this. What do the robots in the green temple area represent? What do they have to do with grief? Are the shadow people just grief personified, or are they something else? Sure, the monster bird thing probably represents anger, so what do the windmills represent? What does the storm in the windmill area represent? Why is the kid's voice his source of magic, besides to copy Journey? This game feels like it was supposed to be something besides an allegory for grief, but maybe that's just me. [/spoiler]

RiME is a delightful three-dimensional platformer sprinkled with symbolism that soupçon deeper, more emotional meanings. Gameplay is straightforward and casual with no expositions or character dialogues that detracts from the story, but still conveying it perfectly. (Please don't ruin the experience by looking up spoilers.) Audio accompaniment is well-suited; albeit, not as dynamic as one would hope for. In addition, there were no timed events, inventory management, or other annoyances; thus, one can really take in the world around the main character.

There is one quality that all video games endeavor to share, though: that they are entertaining, that they are fun. Lamentably, and as much as this reviewer wishes it were not the case, [i]RiME[/i] just does not deliver on that front, despite being created with so much apparent care.

[i]RiME[/i] sees you filling the sandals of a young boy shipwrecked on a mysterious island populated by ancient ruins, curious statuettes, a delightful red fox, and plenty of mysteries. Throughout your time on the island, you'll look to discover who you are and how you managed to end up here in the first place. Your journey will take you through a variety of beautiful locales, dizzying heights, and treacherous lows, all of which have been beautifully (and stylishly) realized with Unreal Engine 4. All the while you're accompanied by a haunting and lovely soundtrack. It's these qualities that make it so unfortunate that [i]RiME's[/i] gameplay is such a woeful slog.

Rest assured, it's not the lack of combat or the heavy focus on exploration that make the gameplay drag so. In truth, at the outset of the game there was hardly any notice of a drag at all. As [i]RiME[/i] proceeds, though, the block-pushing, climbing, and even the decidedly clever puzzle elements that are introduced early-on begin to wear thin. Bear in mind, this is not something that would make or break a game. It's the fact that on top of this, the simple act of movement in [i]RiME[/i] starts to become an irritation. It began to feel like every action made by our curious hero was mired in some way: his running [i]just[/i] too slow, his climbing [i]just[/i] too sluggish, the cooldown on his interactions [i]just[/i] too long. This even lead to a moment of shouting, ""Move faster!"" at our hero. At this time, the very game itself had become a draining experience and it was the curiosity about its story alone that kept me pushing onward to the end.

That being said, [i]RiME's[/i] ending is touching and heartfelt in a way that was unexpected...but getting there had felt like such a chore that the impact was lessened. I was shocked to find it had only taken around 4 hours to complete when it legitimately felt like it had taken five times longer. This is all written with a pang of regret: [i]RiME[/i] has so much good about it but moving around its world is simply not fun and the player spends most of the game doing it. I feel that the best way to express this is to point to Giant Squid's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/384190/ABZU/]ABZU[/url], which has no combat, is only about exploration, but is an absolute joy to move around in.

There are so many things to appreciate about [i]RiME[/i] but it just was not enjoyable to [i]play[/i]. On top of this, the price of entry (at time of writing: $29.99) is far too steep a price for what [i]RiME[/i] brings to the table. All of this being said, I simply cannot recommend [i]RiME[/i]. As beautiful as it may be, as lovely as its soundtrack, its fatal flaw prevents it from being something that all games should aspire to be: fun.",1574576936,1574576936,False,23,4,0.519974946975708008,0,False,True,False,False,,,

- Le jeu est très beau.
- Les décors sont variés et grands.
- L'histoire est très jolie et surprenante.
- Les temps de chargement sont peu présent.
- La possibilité de rejouer le chapitre de notre choix à la fin du jeu. Parfait pour viser le 100% succès.

[i]Points négatifs[/i] :

- Léger problèmes de maniabilité lorsqu'on joue au clavier/souris. 
Finalement j'ai terminé le jeu avec le pad de la 360. Et je n'ai plus eu de problème.

- Le coup du ""au pixel-près"". Pour raviver les flammes des braseros, il faudra parfois se mettre au pixel prêt et dans le bon angle c'est un peu chiant.

- Peu de diversité dans les énigmes qui sont d'ailleurs un peu simple.

Mis à part le problème de maniabilité (esquivé avec le pad) les autres points négatifs ne sont pas handicapant. Je trouve juste un petit un peu dommage qu'il n'y ai pas d'énigme un peu plus complexe.

И, конечно же, ФИНАЛ. О нём можно, наверное, догадаться... Но пережить его - это восторг.

It's certainly not a bad game; a positive of being so simplistic, but visually competent, is that there is nothing fundamentally flawed in the underlying structure. But it's not a game I can say I will remember or recommend people spend the time playing if they can play anything else.

Technically RiME looks fantastic, and will really work your PC if it doesn't have the most recent of cards. Your graphical options are fairly minimal, and even on max settings you aren't missing out on a lot from there to low settings and SSAO aliasing off. Regardless you get the visual equivalent of a water-painting, and even if you didn't have any choices with graphical fidelity the game would still stand on its own due to the good work underneath it. Ironically I can't say that this game blasts, say, Windwaker out of the water, but that's more a testament to how cel-shading endures the passage of time.

Typically I don't talk about 'graphics' in my reviews, and this next section should explain why.

RiME is a competent, albeit shallow experience. The game is a puzzle platformer, with you travelling 5 somewhat open but fairly linear areas. I'll give the developers a pat on the back for making this feel like an open-world game whilst not being one-that takes a bit of map design skill. The game mechanics focus on either pulling on objects, grabbing ledges, activating mechanisms, or rolling spheres to change shadow trajectories. There is no additional equipment to collect, which means that you never feel like you shouldn't be in an area, as every puzzle can be solved upon encounter.

With minimal narrative tools, the game really should be applauded over its ability to give no information whilst not leaving the player in the dark. Part of the fun is figuring out just what is expected of you, and perhaps as an outgrowth of its simplicity it's never too complex.

There is a story here, and a lack of narrative doesn't necessarily [i]hurt[/i] the game...but it also doesn't [i]aid[/i] it either. See, there's a twist at the end of sorts, but it's less impactful when its the only piece of information that makes any sense. In the end there wasn't much of a story to begin with. I can explain it in a sentence but it would spoil the whole thing. Just as shallow as everything else, the story is a lot of fluff until the reveal.

RiME's development history was tumultuous, and in the transition from an open-world tower defense/survival game the developers likely stripped everything to basics to get a finished product. It's a fine product, but a thoroughly unforgettable one that was perhaps too stripped down to amount to anything memorable. It will get praise by the ""artistic"" gamers in the crowd, but I can't find any solid merit to recommend this over anything else on the market.

[i]Jugar, no es una palabra para definir como interactuas con este obra de arte, la palabra que mejor define la experiencia seria contemplar, con una pizca de ""descubrir"" puesto que la historia que pasa por delante de tus ojos requiere de ciertos momentos de exploración.
De gráficos preciosistas, con banda sonora acogedora, llenan la pantalla unos escenarios que perduraran en tu retina durante mucho tiempo. Disfruta de una paleta de colores y un diseño de escenarios que lo convierten en una obra atemporal, no tiene HUD, ni lo necesita; tampoco unos controles complejos, le bastan con un par de acciones; es un juego que te engancha porque emociona, y eso lo pueden decir muy pocos juegos.
Quizás todo esto sea fruto del orgullo patrio, de ver otra vez a GUERRILLA WORKS haciéndolo bien, creando un producto completo, que no tendrá los presupuestos de otras obras del genero, pero que sabiendo donde poner el esfuerzo, son capaces de crear esta historia, que seguramente, te jara esbozar alguna sonrisa... o soltar alguna lagrima

Un juego, una película, una aventura, que se merece un hueco junto a JOURNEY, con el que comparte muchas mecánicas, pero que a mi parecer, lleva mas allá el genero.

Este juego me lo he pasado junto a un niño de cuatro años;[i] mientras yo paseaba por el escenario el no quitaba ojo de lo que pasaba en pantalla, lo vi asustarse, chillar de emoción porque salia ""el hombre de la capa roja"", o alucinar porque de repente el escenario se transformaba por completo.[/i] Si estas buscando acción seguramente este no sea tu juego, pero si quieres jugar una película (y no me refiero a un Metal Gear) esto es lo mas cercano que estarás de esa meta

If I could give ""RiME"" a so-so rating, I'd do it.  Since I'm not all that enamored of it, I really don't think it's worthy of a Thumbs Up and I feel bad about giving it a Thumbs Down.  But, since there are plenty of positive reviews here, I guess I'll go the negative route and Not Recommend it.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Aesthetically, ""RiME"" is a beautiful game both visually and aurally.  It's got a good, solid theme.  And, mechanistically, my only gripe is that the game tends to grab and reorient the camera for its own purposes instead of leaving it where it belongs for mine.  

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
Unfortunately, there are several big faults with it:
[list]
[*]The story is very weak, and, when you get down to it, what the story has you doing really has no logical connection to the end result.
[*]You don't even get an inkling of the story until you've completed the vast majority of the game.  Coupled with that, or perhaps because of that, you play the game without having any idea of what you're supposed to be doing or accomplishing (or even why you should be doing it).  I spent much of the game wondering if I was letting some vast, old evil loose into the world.  After all, someone locked all this stuff up for some reason, didn't they?
[*]Outside of aesthetics, the game doesn't know what it wants to be.  Is it a platformer, puzzle, adventure, or exploration game?  Well, yes and no to each of them.  There's platforming, but it's fairly pointless and easy (it works out to a search for guano since that marks places where you can climb).  There are puzzles, but they're all trivial.  The adventure aspect is marred by your having no idea what your goal is or why you're doing the things the game wants you to do.  And, exploration is scarred by the game locking paths behind you for no reason and having no way to go back since it's a checkpoint game.
[*]The game introduces some kind of ""shadow people,"" gives no explanation for them or what you're supposed to do with them.  Heck, in most places they're entirely passive (basically, landscape).  But, in one area, they attack you for no reason.
[*]At the same point where the game introduces those shadow people, it starts putting sand statues of people in.  Again, with no explanation or apparent use.
[*]And, finally (and I have to be vague here because of spoilers), in one stage of the game, it uses a very silly thing as a key to a lock.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It took me 8.6 hours to ""finish"" the game with only 13 out of 31 Achievements (41%) complete.  Aesthetically, I'm pleased with the game.  But, gameplay-wise, I'm not happy with it.  Also, at its current list price of almost $30, it's certainly not worth it.  Normally, I 100% all Achievements.  But, since I'm not all that happy with the game, I'm not sure if I'll be going back to complete them.  But, even if I do, I highly doubt they would add enough to the game to make it worth that price.  So, even though I'm mostly on the edge with the game, I'm Not Recommending it.

EDIT:  I went back through the entire game with an Achievement walkthrough just to get those Achievements I'd missed.  It took me another 6.9 hours to do so (totaling 15.5 hours for 100% Achievements).",1571083216,1571270309,False,12,1,0.616053760051727295,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Когда впервые запустила игру, показалось, что это что-то очень детское (совсем простые загадки, медлительность, история про императора (?) и его сына...), но, черт, детям здесь лучше не доходить до финала. Начало очень медлительное и безобидное. Однако с середины игры возникает непреодолимое желание выяснить, кто же наш герой, что с ним случилось (хотя все аллюзии достаточно прозрачны).

Вот крайне напоминает из-за этого небезызвестную Грис, которая также оказала на меня сильное впечатление, однако в Грис не было конкретики, а здесь - полноценные слезовыжимательные кат-сцены.

Графика очень порадовала, вот просто рай для любителя делать 100500 скринов.
Музыка - прекрасна. 
Всякие собирушки - люблю. 
Геймплей - спокойный и не рвущий одно место на части. 
Из минусов могу отметить:
Топористое управление (играла с геймпада, сперва было ну ооочень медленно, а потом как-то приноровилась)
Некоторые проблемы с оптимизацией. Играю на средне-приличном железе, почти все время рисовало 60 фпс, но периодически встречались фризы, в основном в первой локации.
Ну очень простые загадки. После Талоса, Портала, Миста... Такое себе. Если для расслабления - супер.

É um jogo que deve ser jogado com paciência e absorvido com muita sensibilidade. Tendo isso removido do caminho, vamos aos pontos.
- Você joga com uma criança que desperta na costa desse mundo lindo e enigmático. Logo se percebe que se está numa jornada mágica onde o fim realmente não importa, mas tudo o que se aprende durante a jornada é que conta.
- Os gráficos são minimalistas mas de muito bom gosto, feitos com bastante carinho e pensados para transmitir essa leveza e beleza conforme você avança nos mundos.
- Os controles são bem simples e fáceis de dominar. O jogo é praticamente um sandbox com trechos de plataforma e muita exploração e alguns puzzles simples, mas deliciosos de resolver. Por diversas vezes a mecânica me remeteu aos Prince of Persia do PS2. Dentro desse mundo bem desenhado, existem colecionáveis que o ajudam a entender os motivos da jornada, mas não o preparam nem um pouco para o final.
- A cada novo cenário, o jogo te atinge com uma bela trilha sonora que , ao meu ver, foi meticulosamente composta para estimular uma grande variedades de emoções. A cada acontecimento, descoberta ou avanço, o jogo te atinge com uma combinação de acordes que fazem o coração palpitar, tudo para construir e manter essa atmosfera leve de descobrimento.
- A história não é muito complexa e é estimulada pela simples curiosidade de entender o que está se passando e qual será o próximo cenário com o qual você será presenteado. E aqui vem um ponto importante.
- VocÊ consegue ter uma noção do que aconteceu ao procurar por pequenas fechaduras. Elas provém um pano de fundo para a pergunta ""por quê ele foi até aí?"", mas a resposta para o ""por quê ele está aí"" só vem bem no final e, se você for como eu, é melhor está munido de lenços, pois para mim, conter a emoção foi muito difícil.
- Em suma, é um jogo simples, lento e projetado para, além de contar uma história, lidar diretamente com as emoções do jogador e ser uma experiência  de sensibilidade. E isso por si só já basta para convencê-lo de que esse é um grande jogo. Uma obra de arte interativa.

The game is kind of open world and mostly relaxing. It has a line path to the story but you can explore any areas around.

[u] Story [/u]

Rime starts with a little boy being washed ashore on a mysterious island. There are many ruins and a huge tower in its center. When the boy, with a spiritual guide, a fox, explores the island, he encounters several times a mysterious man in a red cloak, whom he can never reach. 
[spoiler]As the boy climbs the big tower, the first level ends and he comes to the four other levels of play. It becomes clear, that the individual game levels represents each of the five stages of mourning and dying after Elisabeth Kübler-Ross:

Deny
Fury
Negotiate
Depression
Acceptance [/spoiler]
One wonders what we are doing here, why we are here and what our goal is. Gradually, we get to know the ""before"",  but at the end, there is a (surprising) disclosure, that reveals a much bigger picture of the storyline.
[spoiler] The feels man...[/spoiler]

[u]Graphics [/u]

I really really really enjoyed the grafics (took screenshots every 5 mins lol).
They create a magical world that changes more and more as the game progresses. Each section has its own well-rounded atmosphere.

[u] Music [/u]

The music is beautiful and creates the atmosphere of the game sections combined with the visual aspect.

[u] Overall / Achievements [/u]

If you only focus on the Storyline, you will probably get through the game in 6-7 hours. But you will miss a big part of the RiME-world. Most of the Achievements are collectibles, for which you have to explore and experiment a lot. Some of them are easy(er) to find, for others I needed a guide, because they were really hidden or you had to do some extra rounds. With that part of exploring, it doubles or triples the play time. Overall ,it is really fun to do them, mostly because there is so much so see and do, but some Achievements are a pain in the Ass [spoiler] ""Hold your breath"" had cost me all my nerves lol [/spoiler]

RiME is a story told through the medium of a video-game and it's absolutely stunningly beautiful. It's ""a book come to life"" sort of ""game"". There are little secrets you can go out of your way to grab but they don't mean all that much in the end, it just meant you explored more of the world that was built. I personally don't recommend it cause it will take away from the experience of the game. What you're really here for is the meat/story of the game which is throughout the entire way through, incredibly vague and puzzling but intriguing which keeps you hooked constantly. The payoff of this game comes in the final parts where it all finally snaps together because the story is told without words. The game is adorable, the colors are vibrant, and the sound design is stunning. I could go into more depth but it would take ages. If you want to play this game I would suggest playing with a controller so you can lay back and relax from your bed or couch when playing this game.

It was a very chill game for the most part, with some platforming and some puzzles that were not breaking your head. I never felt stuck in one place. 

The art style was wonderful and there were all kinds of clues and alternative storytelling things that still, only made sense to me in the very end, so it would require a replay to fully get the meaning behind all of the paintings on the walls, hidden memories, messages and similar things found along the way.

The music was one of the best aspects of the game. It always created an atmosphere that felt other-wordly together with the visuals.

[b]RiME[/b] เกมแนวผจญภัย-ไขปริศนา รูปแบบเดียวกับ ICO, The Last Guardian, Journey โลกของเกม RiME ดำเนินอยู่บนโลกแฟนตาซีในกราฟิกสไตล์ Cel Shaded ที่เหมือนกับ Journey มากๆ องค์ประกอบศิลป์ การเลือกใช้โทนสีในเกมมันดูเข้ากันหมด แถมการเคลื่อนไหวของตัวละครก็ทำออกมาได้นุ่มนวล ทำให้ตลอดการเล่นเหมือนกับเราเคลื่อนไหวไปบนภาพวาด ทำให้อินี่กด Screenshots รัวแบบบ้าคลั่งมาก 555+ แล้วยิ่งได้ BGM ที่บรรเลงโดยวง Orchestra มันเพราะและเข้ากับตัวเกมสุดๆ

ในเกมเราจะได้รับบทเป็นเด็กชายที่ตื่นขึ้นมาแล้วพบว่าตัวเองอยู่บนเกาะร้างไร้ผู้คน มีหอคอยตั้งตระหง่าน ด้วยเหตุนี้ทำให้เขาต้องเดินทางเพื่อค้นหาหรือพิสูจน์อะไรสักอย่าง?? ระหว่างทางจะมีคนในชุดคลุมสีแดงคอยปรากฎตัวราวกับต้องการสื่อสารอะไรบางอย่างกับเขา โดยเราจะได้น้องจิ้งจอกมาเป็นเพื่อนร่วมทางคอยนำทางให้ ซึ่งบนเกาะเต็มไปด้วยอารยธรรมโบราณ สถาปัตยกรรมรูปร่างแปลกประหลาด ซากปรักหักพังที่รายล้อมไปด้วยธรรมชาติที่อุดมสมบูรณ์ และมีสิ่งมีชีวิตอาศัยอยู่ บางฉากนี่แอบคิดถึงโลกของ Nier Automata เลยแหละ แถมตัวเกมยังมีระบบกลางวัน กลางคืน เกมจึงดูมีชีวิตชีวา แต่ก็แฝงไปด้วยบรรยากาศเหงาๆ ในเวลาเดียวกัน

รูปแบบการเล่น เราต้องออกสำรวจพื้นที่และไขปริศนาเพื่อหาทางไปต่อเรื่อยๆ การบังคับตัวละคร เราต้องใช้วิธีปีน กระโดด ว่ายน้ำ ดำน้ำ ลากวัตถุ และการเปล่งเสียง ซึ่งการเปล่งเสียงมันมีกิมมิค อาจจะใช้จุดไฟ ทำให้เกิดคลื่นสะท้อน หรือแสดงอารมณ์ต่างๆ เมื่อไปกดกับวัตถุใดวัตถุหนึ่ง ส่วนระดับความยากของปริศนา มียาก-ง่ายปนกันไป บางอันนี่ต้องยอมรับว่าทีมงานมีความคิดสร้างสรรค์มากๆ ซึ่งรูปแบบปริศนาไม่ค่อยหลากหลายเท่าไหร่นัก แต่จะเพิ่มความซับซ้อนขึ้น อยู่ในขั้นที่เล่นได้สนุก ไม่กดดันมาก และตัวเกมจะแบ่งเป็น Chapter แต่ละ Chapter จะมีสิ่งแวดล้อมต่างกัน ซึ่งพื้นที่ที่ให้สำรวจมีขนาดไม่เล็กหรือใหญ่เกินไป และให้อิสระกับผู้เล่นว่าจะสำรวจตรงไหนก่อนก็ได้ ซึ่งเกมมีเส้นทางลับที่ซ่อนของต่างๆ อันเป็นส่วนสำคัญกับเนื้อเรื่องเกมค่อนข้างเยอะ ดังนั้นถ้าเล่นแบบเก็บ Achievement จริงๆ ต้องเดินสำรวจมันทุกซอกทุกมุม แต่เราจะเล่นให้จบก่อนแล้วค่อยไล่มาเก็บก็ได้นะ สามารถเลือกได้ว่าจะเล่น Chapter ไหน แต่แนะนำเก็บให้ครบก่อนก็ดี  เพราะของในเกมมันมีความหมายกับเนื้อเรื่อง ซึ่งระยะเวลาที่ใช้เล่นจนจบราวๆ 5-7 ชั่วโมงได้ แต่ถ้าเล่นแบบเก็บบรรยากาศ เก็บ Achievement ก็ราวๆ 10-20 ชั่วโมง

และอีกสิ่งที่ตัวเกมต้องการนำเสนอ นั่นก็คือ 'เรื่องราว' เริ่มต้นตัวเกมไม่ได้บอกอะไรกับเราเลย อยู่ดีๆ ก็โผล่มาเกยตื้นที่ชายหาด แถมยังไม่มีบทพูด บทบรรยายอะไรทั้งนั้น ดังนั้นเราต้องอาศัยการตีความจากสิ่งที่พบเจอกันเอาเอง มีการใช้วัตถุกับสัญลักษณ์สื่อความหมาย ดังนั้นใครที่ไม่อินกับการเล่าเรื่องลักษณะนี้ อาจจะเล่นแล้วรู้สึกตัวเกมไม่มีจุดหมายเลย แต่ส่วนตัวชอบเกมที่เล่าเรื่องแบบนี้นะ ซึ่งตัวเกมก็ทำให้เรามีอารมณ์ร่วมกับเกมได้ดีมากๆ มันทำให้รู้สึกอยากจะสำรวจ อยากไปดูตรงนั้น ตรงนี้นะอยู่ตลอด แต่ถ้าเราสำรวจตกหล่นไปบางจุดก็อาจจะทำให้เราเก็บองค์ประกอบเรื่องราวได้ไม่ครบ แต่ก็ไม่ใช่ปัญหาอะไร เพราะบทสรุปจะทำให้เรากระจ่างแจ้งได้ด้วยตัวมันเอง และฉากจบของเกมมันเป็นเวลาแค่ไม่กี่นาที แต่ส่งผลกระทบต่ออารมณ์คนเล่นมากกก 

[b]สรุป[/b] ถ้าใครสอยเพื่อระบบเกมเพลย์ ปริศนาแบบโหดๆ ท้าทาย เกมนี้ไม่ใช่ตัวเลือกแรกๆ แน่นอน แต่ถ้าใครชอบเล่นเกมแบบซึมซับบรรยากาศ เสพย์งานศิลป์ และชอบเรื่องราวที่ค่อยๆ เล่าผ่านการผจญภัย เกมนี้คุ้มค่ามากกก คุ้มจนรู้สึกผิดที่ซื้อเกมมาในราคา 30 กว่าบาท ฮืออ T^T กดราคาเต็มยังไม่เสียดายเงินนะบอกเลย เป็นประสบการณ์การเล่นเกมที่ดีมากๆ ขอบคุณคนสร้างมากนะคะ :)",1568362189,1568368776,True,20,1,0.736666202545166016,2,False,False,False,False,,,

the Rime sets itself as an adventure for you and me to play through and the Rime sets the world and its characters to tell us a story about the rise of fall of you and me, and the Rime sets its lights, water and dust, drawings and artifacts as a way and a mean to gaze into ancient cultures and civilizations that tells so much without words, that tells so much without trying to and that tells so much without changing the reality of that a child who wakes up to find himself lying on a sunny beach somewhere in the world

the Rime excels at telling an adventure, a history and most importantly, a tragedy

You wake up on an island which seems overused but soon enough you start to realize that your voice is a way to control a certain...things lets call them for now, certain things in the island as if you were destined to wash up on that island's beach and if things were built for you and you only, you and me


but where are you and where did you come from and who are you and why are you doing what you are doing?
I had the same experience in many other games, as where some of them failed to explain the situation or give a simple explanation the Rime not only succeeded but it excelled at not only explaining itself, the world and its characters, you and your past and your future but it dug up ancient tribes and realms all through drawings on walls and on pieces of wood and cloth just as in real life because the Rime is nothing but an attempt to imitate real life... or perhaps an attempt to refuse the reality of real life and replace it?

Acceptance, Depression, Bargaining, Anger, Denial is what the Rime is and what it is here to tell and it does it so well that it makes it not only a puzzle adventure game but a puzzle within a puzzle which can only let the player think about the possibilities and options and perhaps... 
the realities 
it will leave the player wondering about life's worth and everything's price, freedom price and what's the captivity price too

from denial to acceptance, the eternal light controls all,  it guides us and it enables us to keep going, to never stop no matter what the price is, sacrifices are to be made and tears to shed because the price of freedom and the price of us and them raising from the ashes is never too much.

the Rime allows us to experience all that while us being nothing, a soul looking for guidance and the eternal light provides but will we make it? where to though? we don't know, we only know that we are just a soul, a lost one that is trying to reach its final destination to reach its ''acceptance''

the ending of the Rime re-frames the whole game, it re-frames everything, and allow us finally to be something and to finally let go, let the pain and let the past go and accept reality, that is most definitely not a denial that is indeed acceptance.

Anyone who enjoyed AER: Memories of old will likely enjoy it. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy puzzle games and being able to explore.

Pros:
- Beautiful, colourful art style similar to AER: Memories of Old
- Puzzles were not too complex for the most part
- Tells a story via cutscenes at the end of each chapter
- Collectibles expand on the story, but are not necessary to understand it
- Plenty of nooks and crannies (many containing collectibles) to explore

Cons:
- Some of the collectibles are *very* well hidden - I can't imaging many people would find them without a guide
- THAT EFFING BIRD IN CHAPTER 2. I was so happy with the finale. I found it discouraged exploration and made some areas frustrating as it gave me mere seconds to try and figure out the puzzle before dying
- Some areas, especially chapter 3 and later, are too dark. I understand the desire to make it atmospheric and realistic, but I found myself getting of the couch and up close to the TV to try and make out what was going on. I could have increased the brightness, but then non-dark areas look washed out.

Amazing level design and scenery
Beautiful sound design
Nice and subtle animations
Good platforming and puzzles(not very hard and pretty enjoyable and tolerable too)
If you like Fez,then there is a chance you will like this too(The Fez 2 we never got i guess)

cons(-)
Unoptimized in some areas (Turn off antialiasing completely for better results but still....)
+/-Story : [spoiler] Its pretty obscure till the very end .Its basically about a father who lost his son and is going through a greifing process and is trying to cope with the loss of his son[/spoiler]

Solve puzzles in a different areas either in floor , under the sea , or  climb up in  high buildings.
in the beginning i found it a little bit weird  [b], [/b]because still didn't know anything also there is no tips to where i go and what i do , then after time i learned the way how to solve the puzzle and it has the same style  when proceed in game , but even more complicated.
[spoiler][b]in chpater 2 was  well made and challenged i enjoyed it[/b].[/spoiler] 
some people maybe can find this game so [u][b]EASY [/b][/u]and finish the game in[spoiler]3-5[/spoiler] hours to obtain everything.

There are a few minor issues with the camera which can prove troublesome when trying to perform a jump of some sort from place to place, but they don't appear often (I only noticed it four or five times, so roughly once an hour....not bad at all!).

A relaxing and imaginative game about a journey of discovery and puzzles that spends a lot of its time in the darkness.

It’s relaxing to play, beautiful to look at and an enjoyable experience throughout, but there are times it could have done with more signposting as to where to go next and it had a lot more enemies than I was expecting.

You do need to be in the right mindset to enjoy your sessions without the progression feeling like work (i had to keep them short and occasional) but the whole cinematic ambience is very quick to make you feel at home at once when you come back to it.

Nos cuenta una historia más sencilla de lo que creemos en un principio, siempre utilizando la metáfora como recurso. Un juego que comienza muy fuerte con unos escenarios abiertos y jugosos y que, con el paso de las horas, va ofreciendo unos mapas más sosos y se olvida completamente de introducir nuevas mecánicas jugables o hacer más complejas las que ya existían. En general los retos más interesantes y los mejores escenarios los encontraremos en la primera mitad de la aventura, resultando la segunda mitad mucho menos inspirada, lo que puede provocar cierta decepción tras el inicio tan bello del juego.
En cualquier caso es un hermoso juego, que transmite múltiples sensaciones, con un gameplay básico de plataformeo y exploración, pero con un potente diseño artístico. Una aventura original, sencilla y muy personal que disfrutarán los jugadores más calmados que no necesitan de grandes dosis de acción para divertirse con los videojuegos.

It's like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be an exploration or a platformer or a puzzler, so it just half-heartedly tried to be all of them, and none of it is even remotely challenging and, for me, none of it was engaging. Actually, it felt a *whole lot* like Abzu, just with a sadder story. If you really loved that game then you'll probably like this.

Обзор на игру RiME

[i] Жанр этой прекрасной испанской игры - головоломка.
Вместе с мальчиком мы оказываемся на чудесном острове. 
Шум моря, крики чаек, чарующая музыка. 
Кажется, что это рай. 
Но нам нужно выбираться, а поможет нам быстрая огненная лиса ( не про браузер ли это?).
В этом путешествии мальчик встречает разных существ. 
И только в самом конце мы понимаем, что произошло..
Красивая и бесконечно печальная история.[/i]

[b]Einleitung:[/b]
Ein fleißiger Leser meiner Reviews meinte zu mir, ey ich hab das Spiel gespielt, mach mal bitte nen Review. Ich hab gesehen, es war in meiner Liste und ich habs dann doch einfach mal installiert und nun anderen Games vor geschoben. Ich bereue es nicht, denn es ergriff mich direkt allein durch den tollen Sound und der malerischen Grafik.

[b]Handlung[/b]
Man wacht an einem Strand auf, man wurde wohl an Land gespült. Schnell merkt man, das hier absolut ein absolut Gewaltfreies Spiel gestartet wurde. Auf der Insel leben wilde Tiere und man kann Objekte finden und sammeln. Schnell sieht man auch, was man tun muss um weiter diese Insel zu erkunden. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814893146  

[b]Pro:[/b] 
[list][*]+ atemberaubende Musik
[*]+ malerische und wunderschöne Landschaft
[*]+ kleine Puzzle immer wieder
[*]+ versteckte Objekte zum Sammeln
[*]+ traumhafte Welt mit Geheimnissen
[*]+ regt zur Erkundung an

[b]Contra:[/b]
[list][*]- schlechte Performance
[*]- teilweise schwammige Steuerung
[*]- kein richtiges Sprechen 
[*]- hoher Preis / wartet auf einen Sale

[b]Fazit:[/b]
RiME hat mich in den ersten paar Minuten schon so in seinen Bann gezogen, dass ich kaum raus gekommen bin, obwohl ich noch was anderes spielen wollte. Ich will hier auf jeden Fall auch nicht zu viel verraten, denn wenn man das Spiel einschaltet und dann beginnt, wird man gleich merken, warum ich daraus ein relativ kurzes Review mache, damit jeder selbst sich davon überzeugen kann. Allerdings solltet ihr auf einen Sale warten.

I want to start with what I don't like about this game first before I get to the good.  Beware of exactly what type of game this is.  Steam recommended it to me because I play a ton of puzzle games, and the trailer made it seem like it was going to be very puzzle intensive.  Well if you're a hard core puzzler, DO NOT expect to be challenged whatsoever by this game.  The puzzles were extremely easy.  There were less than a handful of times I was stuck very briefly, and that was always because I literally couldn't find an object I needed or a ledge I was able to jump to.  It was ""pixel hunting"" stuck, not mentally stuck.  I feel like this game had much bigger potential to take advantage of the types of puzzles it used.  Some of them were heading in the cleaver direction but the moment there would be the slightest hint of a challenge, that was the end of the puzzle.

This game also had huge potential to be challenging in a different way but again was made far too easy.  The platforming aspects.  It is heavily influenced by the original Tomb Raider games.  Often times that type of platforming can be puzzles in and of themselves.  Once again, this game touched to surface of that aspect but never presented an actual challenge.  It left it very ambiguous as to whether I was playing an atmospheric walking sim, or if I was playing a puzzle platformer.  

The game seems like an open world exploration game at first but it's actually straight up on rails.  Which I have no issue with.  That part is done very well because you feel like you're in a large world but you're always subtly steered in the correct direction without it being overtly obvious.  That's not an easy feat and they executed that well.  There are hidden bonus items scattered variously off the path, however I stopped purposefully looking for them early on.  I don't feel like this game rewards exploration because there is no way to make your character go any faster, and these areas can be quite large.  So if you go all the way to a far corner of an area just to find nothing, you have to trek all the way back to the main path every single time.  It really gets old after a while.  There needs to be a sprint key.

Onto the good.  The game is downright beautiful and the music compliments it perfectly.  I was very absorbed into the atmosphere of the game and I kept playing it just to see new areas.  Your character is very entertaining with all of his little quirks that you can trigger with the ""shout"" button.  He sings when he's in a good mood, pouts when he's frustrated and in a difficult area, shivers when he's scared, says hello to strange creatures.  The art is simply incredible and sound design is also outstanding.  There is no dialog at all but there is most certainly a story with an emotional twist.  I kind of predicted the ending but it was still very powerful.

If you are on board for a feel good experience with only slight challenges then this game is a 10/10.  If you love games like The Witness, Portal, Stephens Sausage Roll, etc., and are looking for something along those lines, then this game is a 2/10.

Разработчики Tequila Works дебютировали с хоррор игрой [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/211400/Deadlight/]Deadlight[/url][/u] про выживших в зомби апокалипсисе. И вот еще одно их творение RiME, которое не уступает первому по проработке персонажей, но кардинально отличается по сеттингу.

RiME завораживает с первых минут своей атмосферой и музыкальным сопровождением. Последнее не пытается тянуть на себя одеяло, а лишь добавляет объема общему повествованию.

В распоряжении игрока окажется несколько крупных и разных по духу локаций. Но особо интересным в этом моменте становится то, как главный герой реагирует на каждую из них. Вроде бы мелкая деталь, а привносит свою толику реализма.

Благодаря тому, что это 3D-платформер с головоломками средней сложности, то он не заставляет лезть в прохождения, но в то же время и не чересчур расслабляет, чтобы просто бежать по локации из точки А в точку Б.

Как [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/]LIMBO[/url][/u] и [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/]INSIDE[/url][/u], игру захочется после основного прохождения перепройти, чтобы поразмышлять в процессе над сложными вопросами, которые ставит RiME, обратить особое внимание на детали, скрытые в дополнительных материалах или вписанные в локации.

Хотелось бы также провести параллель между RiME и [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/225080/Brothers__A_Tale_of_Two_Sons/]Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons[/url][/u], которые очень похожи в своей основе: сказочная вселенная, интересные персонажи, общающиеся на непонятном языке и, конечно, неожиданный финал. Поэтому если Brothers в своей время понравился, то RiME тоже обязательно стоит пройти.

Плюсы
[list]
    [*]Атмосфера.
    [*]Музыка.
    [*]Сюжет.
    [*]2 концовки зависящие от сбора предметов.
    [*]Вызывает эмоции.
[/list]
Минусы
[list]
    [*]Подлагивающий ГГ во время перемещения кубов.
[/list]

P.S. Несмотря на то, что критики встретили RiME довольно средними оценками, для меня она вошла в топ любимых.

跳崖投海（划掉）赏景好去处！
美术&音乐满分，所以各种氛围营造都非常到位，有种低配但是高演绎的感觉。画面真的又美又壮观，一周目下来我就截了50多张图。
照顾手残，自带悬崖勒马的机制，但是也不会完全让你掉不下去，失去真实感。
谜题难度适中，有些难度来自于「这都能跳过去&这都跳不过去」，手法确实有些重复，但不会完全一致，所以也还不至于厌烦。游戏性这块不吹，就是还行。
主题挺好的，值得品味思考。

Dès le début où notre petit bonhomme se réveille sur sa plage, on est très bien guidé, impossible de se retrouver bloqué.

 On évolue dans des décors tellement somptueux, la bande son est magnifique et je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher de ressentir un petit air de Miyazaki.

Иногда не хотелось продолжать играть в эту игру, т.к. такая прекрасная сказка скоро закончится, а новую найду неизвестно когда. Не хотелось расставаться, как с близким другом.

Графику и цветовую палитру - видно на скриншотах. Но чего они не передают - красивую, но грустную историю. Очень порадовали киношные сцены. 
Вспомнил момент: там где нужно было эпично бежать к свету - умудрился упасть. В итоге эпик не получился)

Музыка в игре великолепна. Настроением напоминает музыку Johan Soderqvist в фильме Let The Right One In. Редко в каких проектах хочется купить OST, но здесь его не завезли, очень жаль.

Beautiful game, short but absolutely sad. Cried like a baby and that's what I like, having my emotions tickled.

Soundtrack was the most beautiful what I have ever heard and the best thing about it was that the songs didn't suddenly change - they adapted. I also can't hype enough the sound environment, I can feel my sandals being wet from rain  just by the sound they make. Lots of secrets to find. The game tells a story, but as a game there's not much to do. But does it need more? 

But I do have some cons too about this game, as beautiful and breathtaking as it was: 

The ""puzzles"" were quite straightforward so there was nothing to solve really. I was overthinking things and trying to do things ahead as I didn't know what was coming sometimes, but when I gave up I realized there was really nothing to solve as you walked ahead and the puzzles kinda solved themselves and I found out I was just wasting time. 

Also no way this game is worth 35€. This game is 4-5 hours at most when you don't know what you're doing but if you just play the game without doing excess stuff it might be an hour long. I'd buy this at sale max 10€.  Sorry devs, there's just not much to do after looking at scenery.

Acabo de recibirlo como regalo, pero en realidad lo jugué cuando lo regalaron en la Epic Store. Las dinámicas son super sencillas; la estética minimalista, cuidada, invita a la contemplación de los paisajes y a la exploración de un entorno maravillosamente diseñado.
Al jugar, se siente reminiscencias de otros grandes juegos tales como Ico y Brothers: Tale of Two Sons. La historia se desarrolla sin diálogos, de una forma bastante abstracta hasta llegar a un final revelador que invita a rejugar y redescubrir cada aspecto del juego, ahora con un nuevo significado.
Como único aspecto negativo, voy a señalar que, en varios momentos del juego, no es raro quedarse sin saber qué hacer. A veces parece faltar un objetivo claro (más allá del de llegar a la torre) y terminaremos deambulando hasta dar, casi por casualidad con lo que hay que hacer. Lo bueno es que, en ese deambular, se pueden encontrar muchos coleccionables. Y es que el juego los tiene en gran cantidad y variedad, lo que suma rejugabilidad al momento de terminarlo.

      While I tend to enjoy some games like these, the visual and sound design should exists to support either gameplay or some kind of story, which it doesn’t, which is a shame. The Witness visual design supports the core gameplay of puzzles, which are challenging and interesting. Wandersong uses it’s visual and sound design to support its story, characters, and themes. Anti Chamber uses its minimalist design to draw attention to its space bending puzzles.

Other than the second level, I enjoyed it very much.  The first level was an absolute treat - very relaxing, discovering what to do, easy game mechanics, beautiful visuals, long view distance, no enemies, etc.  The second level brought in the game's only real enemy that was very annoying and left me no time to freely view the landscapes.  Part of the second level and a good chunk of the third level missed a huge opportunity to have relaxing underwater puzzles.  Instead, the underwater bits involve frequent racing through the water just to get to the next section before the character would die.  Plus the underwater bits are quite beautiful but there's just no time available to simply stop and look around.  There's some replay value in the game to go back and find all of the missed secrets and to get the achievements.  Revisiting/playing the first level again is totally worth it but you'll have to decide for yourself if the other levels are worth revisiting.  The game can be beaten very casually in about 6.5 hours and the story is solid even though none of the characters really say anything.

The puzzles are challenging sometimes but not too hard, the platforming scenes ok, not too hard. Doable for anyone who not really good or like platformer games (like me).

The story is interesting, touching. No narration, no voice acting but you not going to miss any of those.

The graphic is decent, looks awesome, the game is colorful and beautiful.

RiME is kid friendly, you can purchase to your kid or nonadult relative.

Only thing I not liked in RiME is the camera movement/rotation, most of the time you can move it freely, then suddenly at most of the platforming scenes it moves to a fixed position and sometimes I had issue to realize which button to push for moving forward as sometimes it was A or S or D and not W.

I would recommend this game, it is very enjoyable and cute. I personally find the base price very expensive, but as an East-Middle European who cursed with West European prices, I find the full prices of all games overpriced with a few exceptions. RiME is a must to play once owned or very recommended to purchase during the sale.

[b]Hey, I am an achievement hunter! [/b]

Completing game without walkthrough would take about 8-9hours and that's the time you need to get 100% achievements in this game, if you use an achievement guide (achievement guide not means it is also include a walkthrough and puzzle solutions, simple achievement and collectible guide don't kill the fun). Many collectibles are very easy to miss. The good part is, that you can replay chapters once completed the game so easier to return to missed items and achievements.

I noticed some visual glitches, with the geometry disappearing when the camera collides with the terrain. This only happened within caves and tight spaces, and was most noticeable in the first area of the game. 

Apart from that, RiME is a very good platforming adventure, that i would recommend to any fan of games like Ico and Journey.",1562144996,1562145047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A lo mejor al principio no pensaba mucho en ello pero no hay, digamos, una curva ascendente de dificultad. En cuanto a la historia... (Sin spoilers) es muy bonita pero yo personalemente veo que en ocasiones quieren 'forzar' que le cojas cariño a ciertos personajes (en mi caso) sin éxito, pero aprecio el intento y eso no afecta mucho a como la historia ha querido 'conectar' conmigo.

    [*]There were far too many cases where the camera just goes wonky (usually at very inconvenient times)
    [*]The puzzles were decent, but as I only got stuck once, I'd say they could have been a bit more challenging
    [*]The length of the game is too short (like Portal 2, too little of a good thing).

Isso muito se deve pelo modo como RiME apresenta seu enredo, iniciando com o garoto deitado na praia e o jogador livre para explorar um novo universo que já existia antes da sua chegada da maneira que desejar, podendo ir atrás dos itens colecionáveis ou apenas seguir o curso normal da história.
No fim, caso o jogador esteja atento aos pequenos detalhes ao longo do gameplay, a história não será surpreendente, pois o jogo apresenta o desfecho de maneria delicada. No entanto, se o jogador for apenas passando pelo game sem prestar atenção aos detalhes, talvez o final fique um pouco confuso e seja preciso ir atrás de explicações pela internet.
Em suma, RiME é um jogo profundo e superficial ao mesmo tempo, tentado trabalhar a solidão, a companhia, o apego e o desapego do jogador ao logo de seu desenrolar.
No mais, para aqueles que querem apenas bons quebra-cabeças, esse título é essencial.",1561941388,1561941388,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

RiME is a great game when you just want to chill and play a game on the couch. It's not very challenging, and therefore also very suitable for a young audience! On the flip side it can be a bit bland/slow at times because of it. Also, even though it doesn't seem like it for a while, there's actually a touching story beneath all the adventure.

There is no challenge that comes with the achievements, and the primary obstacle is finding hidden objects. While they aren't expertly hidden, you will likely miss a few without a guide.

Each area has a different motif or a hidden meaning and I would say try not to spoil yourself on the ending or major levels before you buy it as it kind of ruins the experience.  You will go through a nice grassy starting island to a desert cliff side to an area that is always pouring rain with water drenched rocks reflecting what little light there is.  Visually and artistically speaking RiME is a very pleasant game to look at and experience.

You control a boy as he wakes up after being thrown out of a boat, the area is friendly in how it is presented to you and really fits the whole “starting zone” type of thing that games like Mario 64 accomplished decades back.  You progress through levels by hunting through slight mazes, hitting switches and opening doors in order to progress to the next area.  The areas are somewhat open world, some zones you can run around everything that you see, back tracking all the way to the place that you started, others you are very clearly locked out of going backwards.  

I just wish that it was better optimized, from what I’ve read the game running smoothly is a serious issue even on console platforms.  You will have a major machine but you may not even be able to break 40-50 FPS maybe see 60 every so often but it is very inconsistent.  I mean inconsistent as in you’ll be seeing 50-60 then suddenly go through a tunnel and come out of the other end and suddenly you’re seeing 30 FPS!  That’s honestly one of my biggest problems with the game is that as much as I want to enjoy the story and the emotional ride it gets jarred constantly but the poor optimization.

I would say for the visuals and story alone to pick up RiME, as I’ve gotten older I’ve started to appreciate these “walking simulators” more and more (so long as they are good) but this one is far more of a 3rd person puzzle game than just a walking sim.  I ended up playing this a few times just to grab every secret, items and story fragments that the game has and each time I noticed something new (as you tend to when you revisit games that you’ve already beaten).

RiME is an artistic game, made for the story and music.
- The graphics are cartoonish but very polished, they remind The Legend of Zelda: BotW.
- There's no HUD, just music, ambient sounds and nice visuals.
- The gameplay is a platform based mostly on puzzles, and they vary a little bit from start to finish but the controls sometimes are bad and not very responsive. Sometimes even if you do the puzzles right the game still doesn't count them right so you have to redo them, but it's not a big problem.
- The music is amazing, it's the most important part of this game, it helps you feel like you are truly into this game's world.
- The story's very nice, since there are no talking scenes or written collectibles, you have to understand the story by yourself (some collectibles help you understand more though).
- Even though the game is created using Unreal Engine and the graphics are very simple, this game still manages to lag even on good hardware and I saw on some forums that it's not the only game Tequila Works made that was very poorly optimised not only on PC but on consoles aswell.
- The game's not very long, 4-6 hours for the story and around 8 hours to get 100% completion, the only achievements you have to pay attention for are the collectible ones and some hidden ones which with the help of a guide are very easy. So I think the full price is not justifiable, I recommend you buy this on sale.

Now, even though the game is very beautiful, I didn't find it very captivating, actually boring at times. I would still recommend you buy this game and try it for yourself to see if you like it.

Original review: Unplayable. I'd really like to play this game, it looks beautiful. But I've got slightly above the recommended specs, and turning down the graphics gets me... 24 fps. That would be okay, but there's something about the extremely unstable fps and the fov that just give me a massive headache, which means I can't enjoy what seems to be an absolutely amazing game. 

This is the first time since seven years ago when I built this PC that I've needed to overclock my GPU to play a game.

Update Mar 2020: Even with a 1080ti, the game still stutters and crashes. Also, the gameplay is really, really slow. It might be beautiful, but I'm not sure it's worth my time.

Update April 2020: Welp, this game has THOROUGHLY redeemed itself. Seems like the one crash was a fluke, because the rest of the game has been relatively smooth, although still with some occasional frame drops. But now that I've played through the whole thing, I can easily forgive everything except the fact that those on less-capable hardware (The recommended specs listed, an R9 280x, are not enough to play this game at all). It's a shame, because everyone *should* have the chance to play this game, regardless of the hardware they run. It's truly a beautiful experience. Even the backtracking that I was annoyed with earlier was mostly a fluke as well. The devs really put some thought into what the player experiences. 

I would be doing a total disservice to this game if I tried to actually explain it, but typically a review is meant to tell you whether you should buy the game or not. The answer is not unequivocally ""yes."" But this game is not for everybody in the same way that any other game is not for everybody. It's just that ""Zelda/Tomb Raider Reboot but prettier and with a more touching and more personal story"" just isn't doing this game justice.

Let me put it this way:

The Witcher makes you fight.

Nier Automata makes you think.

This game makes you feel.

(The Witness makes you bored). 

...

Well, let's say you already knew that. You know you're getting an emotional story mixed in with some puzzles and some absolutely beautiful scenery. I'm sorry that I don't have much to compare this game to. Every other game that I can think of just hits different. This game is meditative. There's no fighting. There's next to no action. Its pacing is most similar to the Tomb Raider reboots, but TR_r feels absolutely empty by comparison. I can't remember the last time I played a game where the story felt this fulfulling, but I can't actually explain why without totally ruining the game for you.",1561727626,1586490838,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

La historia está bien, jugando con el misterio hasta el final, quizás sea algo ambigua si no te paras mucho a explorar o dar significado a la narrativa visual, aun así el juego quiere dar un mensaje y logra su cometido.

En cuanto a gráficos pues ya veis, no es un portento pero si que logra crear un mundo muy vistoso y llamativo, al que dan ganas de explorar y que se siente un personaje más de la historia, las animaciones y las físicas están bien logradas así como el juego de luces y sombras, visualmente es una delicia.

La banda sonora también está muy bien cuando la tenemos y acompaña sobretodo en los puntos importantes de la historia, en otros momentos solo escucharemos sonido ambiental que también ayuda a reflejar y potenciar la soledad del mundo que nos rodea.

En cuanto a los puzles y el plataformeo pues cumplen, los obstáculos que nos iremos encontrando suelen ser sencillos de superar, dejando claro el camino a seguir o el objetivo del puzle que estemos haciendo, esto sumado a una recogida de ciertos objetos de forma fastfood, y algunas zonas de ensayo y error suman las mecánicas principales del juego.

El contenido del juego es enorme, la historia principal sin pararte mucho ya son unas 8 horas, pero es que el juego esta plagado de coleccionables y de caminos ocultos, la isla se vuelve un laberinto y por cada zona bien explorada se recompensa con algún objeto opcional o pequeñas dosis de lore, se nota que el juego pese a tener una historia muy decente se ha centrado mucho en la exploración y en dar vida al mundo que nos presenta.

En conclusión RiME es un buen juego, largo, interesante, bonito, con contenido, pero... no es perfecto, ya que quizás su ultimo tramo se puede hacer algo pesado, los puzles aunque están bien son algo repetitivos y nada que no hayamos visto en otros títulos similares, la historia aunque interesante es tan ambigua en ciertos puntos que no logras conectar todas las pistas, el contenido opcional es tan gigantesco que te da miedo dar dos pasos por si te dejas cualquier rincón sin explorar, algunos saltos, plataformas y animaciones podrían estar mas pulidas...  Pero en conjunto es un juego muy recomendable y todo un orgullo que sea producto nacional, si te llama mínimamente la atención,hazte con el.

That is the first impression I got. And by that, I don't mean that the graphics are great - they aren't - but that the game is aesthetically beautiful. And not just the graphics, but the subject matter, the approach, the way the story is told, everything has a deeper layer of beauty to it that makes it all the more poignant and hard to ignore.

The game walks in the footsteps of ICO, there is no denying that. But instead of looming castles, solemn keeps and forlorn crags, you find yourself on a sunlit island with a Mediterranean climate. It might not come as a surprise that the studio is from Spain. White temple-like structures, green grass, blue sky along with a flora and fauna make the game a pleasure to play, the color palette is one of the cleanest and most pleasing out of any game I can think of. How the time of day is shown is better than any other game I've ever played; at first I thought I was imagining it, that the light had changed, but then it really did go from dusk into night, and then into a new morning, all with their own distinct light and colors. Truly amazing.

The story is for the greater part of the game a mystery, told in glimpses and fragmentary flashbacks. There is no dialogue (like ICO) and no combat, only exploration and puzzle solving, yet the game manages to continue to grip your attention without becoming boring or repetitive. The game does get darker, and the environments change, yet the clean, beautiful, crisp colors don't go away even when you descend into gloomier parts.

It is without a doubt a game that will bore some, but going into it not knowing anything about it (which is always the best way) will provide you with an amazing experience if you go all the way to the end - and I cannot stress this enough, you HAVE to go all the way to the end. The conclusion makes RiME what it is.

All in all, it's a visually and emotionally amazing game in a genre that is very sparse.

Don't do that. This game is not for everyone, and it certainly isn't for me. Let's pick it apart by each of the features it touts as its selling points. At each moment, I'll compare it to The Witness, which is also a puzzle game featuring exploration of a mysterious island and secrets galore.

Exploration: The main point to exploring this game is to find secrets, which I'll talk about later, so I'll use this space to talk about the game's movement. First off, this game is linear. There's 'exploration' in the sense that you can step off of the obvious main path to find some secrets, but aside from that the game railroads you in a straight line forwards. Worse still is that your character moves so abysmally slow that I felt punished for exploring, in that it took so long to reach the end of a branch to see if there was a secret there. This game is desperately in need of a sprint key, and exploration feels more like a chore due to how the slow movement grinds away at you. Compare it to The Witness, which has a sprint key that moves you inhumanly fast across the landscape. A good speed in my opinion.

Puzzles: They were easy. Not just 'yeah i get this' easy, but 'why are they wasting my time with this' easy. In the first 100 minutes, I didn't find a single puzzle that I had to think for. Most were simple enough that I understood the solution from the first moment I saw them, and the few that weren't only took a few seconds thought to figure out what a new piece did. You can carry a game on the strength of good puzzles. The Witness, as a game, is exclusively about puzzles, but that ties into the game's deeper philosophy. In Rime, the puzzles were not only simple, they felt disconnected from the game itself. They were barriers barring progress and nothing else.

Find Secrets: This is where the game really fell flat for me. I'm a sucker for good secrets, and the ones I found in Rime just... aren't. There are 4 different kinds of secrets (that I found. there's 6 sections on the extras screen.) You can find new outfits, little wooden dolls, fragments of coins/seals, and conch shells that play a lullaby. The seals and dolls are, at first blush, literally useless, The outfits are... neat? But not a satisfying reward given the time it takes to find them. And the lullaby was... eh. It's a thing that exists. Maybe it has some deeper meaning once you put the entire song together. Again, let's compare to The Witness. Secrets take two forms; usb sticks that hold philosophical quotes and excerpts- usually about knowledge, learning, and the pursuit of both- and optional perspective puzzles, where the secret is an additional puzzle about finding the right place to stand, the right perspective to look from. Each USB, each philosophical quote, again, ties into the game's theme, while the bonus puzzles are exactly that; bonus puzzles. They have literally no purpose, except that they exist to be solved, and The Witness, as a game, is about taking enjoyment in that intellectual pursuit of knowledge and conquering obstacles. 

Be Enchanted: I'll give the game credit here, it is beautiful and atmospheric. The soundtrack is pleasant, the graphics are stunning, and the environments you explore are rich and colorful. This game has the visual design down scratch, but at the end of the day, it's still a video game, and IMO if your main selling point for a game is visual appeal, why not just make it a movie?

TL:DR Painfully slow movement makes exploration a chore, and the secrets you find while exploring didn't seem to have a payoff that was worth exploring for. The puzzles were simple and lackluster, and while the game's beautiful, there's not enough -game- in it to justify a 30$ price tag.

If you want a pleasant stroll around the island with some light puzzling, maybe grab this on sale, but I wouldn't pay more than 10$ for it, and even that's a stretch.

P.s. People say the ending is fantastic and the game makes way more sense in retrospect, but I don't feel like trudging for 8 hours. Did I mention the game's that long? Some people call that short, but it's longer than I wanted to spend trudging on a linear path.",1559189322,1559189322,False,3,0,0.500576555728912354,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Historia: el juego trata claramente las fases del duelo de forma correcta. Sin embargo, el final es bastante predecible y le quita gracia a prácticamente toda la campaña, ya que si eres avispado desde el primer nivel sabrás, como digo, el final. 
- Gráficos y sonido: bonitos gráficos y banda sonora emotiva, sin grandes alardes. La optimización del título es pésima, con una RX 580 de 8gb he tenido que poner varios ajustes en medio para que el juego tirara a 60fps, simplemente ridículo.
- Jugabilidad: el título es bastante lineal y los puzzles son sencillísimos. No hay ninguno realmente inspirado y que te sorprenda por su originalidad. No son muy variados.
- Originalidad: aquí encuentro uno de los principales puntos negativos, y es que si habéis jugado a cualquier obra de Fumito Ueda veréis que la inspiración raya en el plagio, sobre todo con ""The Last Guardian"". Todo el rato tenía la sensación de que ya había jugado a lo mismo, pero más grande y mejor. 
- Duración: entre seis y ocho horas la campaña. Puede llegar a doce si quieres conseguir los coleccionables, pero no hay ninguna razón para ello ya que no aportan absolutamente nada a la historia, están muy desaprovechados.

En resumen, un título sencillo, bonito y emotivo que no ha venido a aportar nada al mundo del videojuego. Sus puzzles son muy fáciles, los coleccionables no te inspiran lo más mínimo a conseguirlos y si has jugado a otros títulos como el mencionado The Last Guardian vas a tener una molesta sensación de deja vu constante.

Beendet habe ich das Spiel mit einem bitteren Nachgeschmack und Tränen in den Augen.

Zum Spiel:
Rime ist ein Rätsel / Adventure Spiel was  durch Kombination aus fantastischer begleit Musik & Artwork eine unglaublich gute Atmosphäre schafft.
Man startet als kleiner gestrandeter Junge auf einer Insel und wird ohne jegliches Tutorial dem Spiel überlassen.
Nach  kurzem umsehen und bekannt machen mit den einfachen Steuerungs (Kritik dazu später) Elementen, wie klettern, springen & rufen, findet man recht schnell den richtigen weg & nach dem 1. Rätsel auch gleich seinen treuen Begleiter.
Sofort fällt einem die unglaublich gute Musik auf, die die Stimmung im Spiel stehts passend untermahlt.
Da ich hier nichts spoilern will fasse ich mich kurz.
Unser Freund der Fuchs begleitet uns fast durch das komplette Spiel & zeigt uns wo wir lang müssen.
Zwischen den 5 verschiedenen Leveln gibt es immer wieder kleine Cutscenes, die einem langsam aber sicher Hinweise auf die eigentliche Geschichte geben.

Wer das Spiel, wie ich, mit der Erwartung anfängt, es sei ein lustiges nettes Spiel, wird nach und nach merken, das hier etwas ganz anderes dahintersteck.

Steuerung:
Die Steuerung ist an sich recht einfach gestaltet.
Man kann springen, klettern, rufen, rollen & gelegentlich Dinge aufheben.
Da man im Spiel nicht rennen kann, gibt es ab und zu Passagen die sich etwas ziehen.
Das lässt sich aber verkraften, da das Spiel verhindern möchte, dass man einfach durch rennt und evtl. wichtige Teile der Geschichte übersieht.
Kritik gäbe es im Bereich Koordination. An manchen Stellen merkt man, dass das Spiel als Konsolentitel entwickelt wurde. Das merkt man an kletter Passagen, bei denen der Kamerawinkel festgestellt ist. Dann muss man plötzlich rumprobieren, mit welcher Taste unser Charakter nun weiter klettern kann. 
Auch bei den wenigen Kamerafahrten merkt man, dass man aufpassen muss, nicht von der Kante zu laufen.
Da diese Kamerawinkel & fahrten recht selten vorkommen, hat mich das nicht wirklich beim Spielen beeinträchtigt. 

Rätsel:
Die Rätsel sind im Großen und Ganzen gut gelungen.
Ich hätte mir hier evtl. mehr Variation gewünscht.
Die Rätsel bestehen hauptsächlich aus schieben, drehen, Formen verschieben & rufen.
Da all dies aber gemischt zum Einsatz kommt, entsteht mit der Zeit, eine angenehme Schwierigkeit.
Ich habe mich während all der Rätsel nur einmal verloren gefühlt und wusste nicht weiter.
Die Lösung lag zwar auf der Hand, aber da das Spiel recht wenig Hinweise gibt, kann ich mir vorstellen,  dass der ein oder Andere hier das Handtuch wirft. (Bitte tut das nicht, es lohnt sich!)

Musik:
Die Musik kann ich nur in höchsten Tönen loben!!
Sie ist mir nie als nervig vorgekommen bzw. Hatte ich nie das Gefühl Sie wäre zu repetitiv.
Im laufe der Story ändert sich auch die Musik. Manchmal ganz unscheinbar und plötzlich wird einem ganz anders und man hat Gänsehaut.
Besonders gefallen hat mir der nahtlose Übergang der Musik.
Beispiel:
Man löst ein Rätsel, oder kommt an eine wichtige Stelle im Spiel und plötzlich stimmen Violinen und ein Chor mit ein. Durch dieses kurze Volumen in der Musik habe ich jedesmal Gänsehaut bekommen!

Performance:
Ich habe das Spiel in WQHD gespielt (Alles auf höchster Stufe, außer Tiefenschärfe und bessere Wasser Effekte) und hatte die Ganze Story über zwischen 80 - 155 FPS.
Intelcore i7 8700k
Asus GTX 1080 Advanced
Dabei hatte ich nie das Gefühl, es würde ruckeln.
Ladezeiten sind gering.

Fazit:
Alles in allem fand ich dieses Spiel wunderschön!
Gerade an einem veregneten Tag, an dem man sonst nichts vor hat, ist dieses Spiel eine wunderbare Erfahrung.
Als einer, der ehr Multiplayer Spiele spielt, muss ich sagen, dass ich in Zukunft gerne mal einen Abstecher in das Singleplayer Genre wagen werde.
Dieses Spiel ist ein Kunstwerk, was man erst zum Schluss zu schätzen weiß!

First, if you like atmospheric puzzle games like ICO, the Talos Principle, or The Last Guardian, then you will find a lot to like in Rime. Although it doesn't approach the greatness of the aforementioned, it does hold its own pretty well.  The developers nailed the atmosphere in this game with amazing music, vibrant visuals, great sound effects, and a touching story that will have you interested in playing until the end (I finished the game in 4 hours, although I did not worry about the collectibles and other extras). 

That said, the game suffers from poor optimization, creating a laggy experience with large frame drops in many areas.  Despite running a fast rig that can max out most AAA titles, I had to suffer through dips down into the 20fps range in many parts of the game.  This ruined much of the immersion that a game like this requires to succeed.  There are also some frustrating control issues, specifically when scaling walls and having to leap between ledges.  These might seem like small flaws, but when the entire game is based around atmosphere and platform-intensive puzzle solving, these flaws add up to a frustrating experience pretty quick.

All in all, Rime is a decent puzzle game that is worth playing through once if you have any interest at all in emotional puzzle games like these.

TL;DR: The game's proficient and quite pretty, but feels a bit generic and is too pricey and long for its purposes. Gameplay by itself is ok at best. Buy at a discount.

The visual presentation is, unsurprisingly, one of the better parts of RiMe. It doesn't, however, really stand out from the genre it populates - visually pleasing adventure games with gameplay mechanics that feel a bit like formalities. Some of the ""woah, that looks cool"" moments feel a bit too scripted and the overall aesthetic isn't particularly distinctive, but it's all quite serviceable. Maybe open exploration would give more weight, catharsis and variability to the visual experience of the game.

The music is decent, but not especially memorable or interesting. The puzzles are pretty generic.

The game (and what it wants to communicate) would've been better served by being pricing it at around 20 € and cutting some of the content. Games like this - pretty adventures with some form of a meta-narrative - shouldn't, in my estimation, cost 40 € and/or last as long as RiME does. The gameplay just isn't engaging or distinctive enough to not overstay its welcome, especially since the game is a linear adventure without that much significant exploration. The underlying narrative is a decent one, but also isn't served that well by the length of the game. 

The game is still an enjoyable one for the most part and I do recommend picking it up if you're into the genre, but you should definitely wait for it to go on sale instead of dishing out the listed price.",1557667399,1557667832,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Roast meats, steamed veggies, various bottles of  sparkling drinks and your favourite desserts. It a looks wonderful and smells delicious so you start to dig in. As you're almost half-way through the meal you start to notice that the meats are fully cooked, the veggies are soggy from being left steaming for too long, the bottles of drinks are flat rather than bubbly and the desserts are starting to go sour or stale. This meal is just like RIME.

As first, you look at the game and it looks really well polished. The music and ambience is stirring and initially the world seems vibrant and interesting. The animations on the character is top-notch and this is something that the game maintains throughout as each character is packed with personality and emotion. Early puzzles are varied and clearly give some nods to Legend of Zelda in that they are strictly logic based and visual clues prevent the need for referring to online guides or having written instructions. With occasional exceptions each puzzle can be solved by exploring the nearby area and you can often see the objective but need to figure out how to achieve it. However.. all of this begins to fall apart after the 2nd level. The game starts to degenerate into tedious platforming sections, lots of running between areas just to trigger buttons or events and becomes progressively more linear as you feel funnelled through one area to another when earlier in the game you had some freedom to explore.

RiME is a prime example of developers running out of ideas and not having a good quality assurance process. You can see that they started off strong and then let the remaining 2/3 of the game become extremely mundane and tedious. The musical scores are amazing in once instance and utterly forgettable the next. Some parts of the game have background music that is extremely quiet and is drowned out by the ambience and sound effects leading to parts of the game feeling very empty and unfinished. This mixture of great gameplay and music alongside utterly tedious gameplay and mundane music just makes the latter seem so much worse as RiME's quality becomes like a patchwork quilt

There was an attempt at a storyline here, quite clearly the devs started to lean into the 'this is art' angle to the point that they forgot it was supposed to be a game. I have played other games which dealt with abstract concepts portrayed via gameplay but RiME fell short by not leaning into the symbolism that is supposed to be telling the story and instead depending upon hidden collectables to actually tell the story.  If you don't find any of these you'll get to the end and suddenly be faced with a 'twist' which makes no sense. Again this patchwork quilt effect whereby the gameplay is detached from the story the developers wanted to tell.

As much as the 1st third of the game is worth seeing, I simply cannot make that the justification for recommending the game. RiME needed to go back to the drawing board, cook for a little longer with the QA teams and then finally be released but as it stands it simply isn't a worthwhile experience and with a playtime of only 7hrs it isn't even good value for money.",1557080112,1557080283,False,13,1,0.504183411598205566,0,True,False,False,False,,,

以下总结包含剧透：
[spoiler]游戏讲述了一对父子在大海之上遭遇暴风雨，孩子不幸被风浪吞没。孩子失去生命后，失去记忆的灵魂出现在一座神秘海岛找寻真相的故事。游戏的五个章节似乎正对应着丧亲之痛的五个阶段：

初至神秘岛：Denial（否认）

智斗大怪鸟：Anger（愤怒）

机械谜城：Bargaining（顽抗）

孤冷雨夜：Depression（沮丧）

回到现实：Acceptance（接受）

小男孩在找寻真相的过程，又何尝不是父亲的心路历程。最后的结局，小男孩找寻到了真相，放下了执念化为了繁星，父亲也接受了小男孩已然故去的现实。[/spoiler]
剧情方面的缺点个人感觉也很明显，其一是小狐狸和守护者的[spoiler]牺牲[/spoiler]结局很不明白，为什么要如此安排。其二是剧情的进展有些缓慢，在很有情感爆发的地方又会淡下去，很拖沓，让感染力大打折扣。
剧情向，总的来说很有意义，为小男孩的执着感动，为父亲的释怀心酸。[7.5/10]
【游戏性】
操作总体还算流畅，但是主角在跳跃时按建会有所延迟，会给人停顿的感觉，但是不影响游戏体验，游戏中，收集品很多，而且可以解锁成就，并且与剧情有些许关系，但是各种收集品过于隐蔽以至于很难寻找，有点费时间，一周目结束后的管卡选择不够人性化，尤其是对于二周目找东西的玩家。
解密的地方也是一些很老套的谜题，不是很有新意，总体难度并不是很大，操作难度不是很高。[7/10]
【总结】
总体来说，RimE是一部相当不错的作品，画面、音乐十分完美，解谜的难度适中。很值得在恬静的午后花上一个下午的时间过一遍流程，感受一场心路冒险，感受一段温暖。总体评分【7.5/10】

RiME ist eine dieser Spielerfahrungen, die nicht jedem unmittelbar gefallen wird. Das kann von Person zu Person unterschiedlich sein und hängt auch davon ab wie sehr man sich in das Spiel und in den Hauptcharakter vertiefen kann. Aber ich glaube man wäre nicht hier und liest sich auf Steam Reviews dazu durch, wenn man keinerlei Interesse an dem Spiel hätte.
RiME hat bei mir viele Emotionen ausgelöst. Sei es Mitgefühl, Neugier, Trauer oder Freude. Diese Anzahl von Gefühlen ist größtenteils dem wunderschönen Soundtrack zuzuschreiben und einer bewegenden Geschichte, die allerdings selbst zusammengereimt werden möchte, da Hinweise dazu wie Brotkrumen verteilt worden sind.
Irgendwie habe ich mich in RiME auch wieder wie ein Kind gefühlt. Vielleicht liegt das auch am Kind als Hauptcharakter. Man geht auf der Insel regelrecht auf Entdeckungstour und erforscht was das Zeug hält!
Und mit Erforschung geht auch Openworld einher. Auch wenn RiME anfangs davon noch deutlich mehr bietet und später bei der Erkundung weiterer Areale eindeutig linearer wird. Was ich übrigens recht schade fand.
RiME bietet auch verschiedene Areale: [spoiler]Sei es Strand, zerklüftete Felsen und Schluchten, Wälder, Ruinen, eine Wüste, Dschungel und noch andere kuriosere Orte![/spoiler] RiME hat mich somit immer wieder aufs neue überrascht. Damit, und mit Hinweisen auf die Hintergrundgeschichte von RiME. Schade fand ich jedoch auch, dass einiges von der Story mit Collectibles erzählt wird. Heißt, wenn man nicht gewillt ist, die einzusammeln, dann erfährt man deutlich weniger von der berührenden Geschichte.
Im Allgemeinen hatte ich mit RiME jedenfalls dauerhaft Spaß und es kam nicht zu einer einzigen lästigen Minute, während des Spielens!

Kommen wir für die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:

[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]

+ Die Musik ist wirklich berührend. RiME´s Soundtrack ist vielleicht der beste Soundtrack den ich dieses Jahr bis dato gehört hatte!
+ RiME bietet eine wundervolle Geschichte mit einem berührendem Abschluss!
+ Mir haben die Charakteranimationen des Jungen gefallen. Die waren wirklich hochwertig gemacht und haben stets glaubhaft gewirkt
+ Der Grafikstil ist recht interessant gewählt und erinnert mich persönlich etwas an [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/]The Witness[/url]
+ Es gibt keinerlei Ladezeiten auf der Insel, lediglich am Anfang des Spiels
+ Die Insel selbst könnte faszinierender nicht sein und ist voller Wunder!
+ Hintergrundgeschichte wird teilweise mit Malereien innerhalb von Ruinen erzählt. Das fand ich ganz interessant. Natürlich, wie bereits erwähnt, auch mit Collectibles und gegen Ende sogar mit hochwertigeren Cutscenes!

[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]

- Manchmal hat die Kamera Probleme gehabt. Vor allem beim Schwimmen und beim Klettern
- Controllervibration lässt sich nicht deaktivieren. Generell sind die Optionen recht überschaubar

[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]

+- Ich fand es etwas schade, dass das Spiel anfangs noch deutlich geräumiger war und mehrere Pfade angeboten hat, während im späteren Verlauf des Spiels es ziemlich linear wird
+- Nachdem man mit irgendetwas interagiert hat, sei es die Öffnung einer Tür, oder dergleichen, zeigt die Kamera dies kurz auf und schwenkt dann wieder hinter den Jungen, um zu zeigen, dass man wieder selbst steuern kann. Nur ist dieser Übergang stellenweise viel zu lang gewesen. Diese Zeit hätte man etwas verkürzen sollen
+- Klettersystem funktioniert ähnlich wie bei Uncharted, aber deutlich weniger flüssig, ist eben langsamer und realitätsnaher gehalten

RiME profitiert nicht gerade dadurch, dass das Spiel im Normalpreis so teuer ist. Schließlich ist das Spiel, ohne dem Erlangen von Achievements, gerade mal ca. 6 Stunden lang. 34,99€ sind dafür deutlich zu viel verlangt. Im Sale kann man jedoch wirklich zuschlagen!

Ich danke fürs Lesen und wünsche sehr viel Spaß beim Spielen! ;-)

I'm pleased to say it turned out to be more.

You play a young boy who wakes up on a mysterious isle after a terrible storm, Its a beautiful environment to explore and straight off the bat you have some freedom to explore, theres no real tutorial to be seen but the overall controls of the game a simple and easy to get to grips with as you explore. The world isn't vast and open so theres no chance of wandering off and getting lost but the island is large enough to have multiple side areas with various collectables hidden about the place rewarding the player who looks around and maybe notices a climbable wall or cliff or small opening, theres more to the collectables than just achievements too unlockable art hints at lore, and there are music and costumes to find and unlock as well encouraging you to explore and rewarding you for taking your time to take in this world.

Now as to the gameplay its fairly basic you roam about the world heading for landmarks (towers or light pillars) scattered about the map, its actually a good way to give direction to players as rather than railroad them you guide them more naturally toward points of interest. Within each landmark will be some sort of platforming challenge or puzzle, personally I found none of these difficult and was about to make swift progress (your mileage may vary) between stops to explore and find hidden loot. In addition to these minor puzzles there is generally an overarching theme to each area/world you visit, one might add in a flying monster that will attack you if stay out in the open too long, another will have non-logical layouts (corridors fold back on each other or connect in impossible ways making navigation a challenge), combine all this with beautiful art and sold visual themes for each area and its a joy to travel through this world.

But the last part of the game is of course the story, its told entirely without words, through the world and brief flashbacks between worlds, each world has a theme, something that the title of chapter gives away, in fact the chapter titles give away abit too much so I would say avoid any guides on your first playthrough its easy enough and you unlock a chapter select if you want to go back and do achievements later. The story is bittersweet and best just experienced so I'll leave it at that.

Beautiful and inspiring sound track, interesting puzzles, stunning graphics and a thought provoking story.

Before I begin, I will stress that this game takes TIME. The story has a very slow pace and there is no real context given to the player at the beginning of the game. Therefore, the puzzles you complete and the setting can seem a bit .. strange. But all will be explained and believe me, it is worth the wait! Only until about halfway through the game did I gain any sort of inclination as to what I was actually doing and what it had to do with anything, but nevertheless, the quest to find answers is the purpose of the game and it definitely kept me wanting to discover more.

RiME encompasses many different settings and does so beautifully, from bright and sunny to dark and melancholy. Each scene is well crafted and perfectly utilises light to encapsulate the emotion it intended (especially the last few scenes). It also includes many underwater locations which were one of my favourite environments due to the gorgeous graphics. The majority of the playtime for this game is spent like a platformer, jumping from ledge to ledge and completing a task or puzzle.

As the game is tagged, it is a puzzle game, and although there is nothing too difficult, there are many aspects to the puzzles which keep things interesting. Despite this, the focus and I believe, strong point of the game is definitely its adventure filled world and subsequent story behind it all. Possibly due to this focus, the developers have been quite forgiving and in the rare chance that you actually do die from the handful of baddies who have the capacity to kill you; you will re-spawn very close to where you died and simply just pick up where you left off. 

 As a bit of an extra, you can stray away from main objectives which are conveyed to the player by following a helpful fox and find tonnes of collectables. This also ticks the box for collectors, or those looking for a second play-through. 

Unfortunately, RiME is a victim of very noticeable frame drops. In a select few scenes it is extremely laggy for no apparent reason and it can only be overcome by simply moving to the next scene. This isn't a deal breaker for me but it certainly wasn't fun and did take away from my experience, considering the heavy immersive focus that the game intended.

Lastly, the price tag. Yes the $AU40 price tag seems substantially high for a short (4-7 hour game, depending on collectables). But before I become too pedantic, RiME is a game that is repeatedly bundled together with other games and also heavily discounted on many popular sites for as little as $4. With that in mind, it is hard to fault RiME as it incorporates everything an adventure lover looks for. Although it is difficult to truly describe what this game is about without unveiling any spoilers, I can definitely recommend this to fellow adventure lovers. Don't overlook this little hidden gem like I did, its absolutely worth your time.

Puzzles em geral não trazem grandes desafios, assim como a jogabilidade não incomoda em nenhum momento, é tão agradável quanto seu visual e seus sons, afinal este é um jogo que foca em te levar aos poucos à compreensão de algo muito maior, cheio de pequenas mensagens ocultas em cada momento de seus cinco capítulos.

I had a decently positive experience with this, but I still can't really recommend it. It kinda peaks in the first hour and a half and maybe again in the last 30 minutes. The game is slow, the puzzles are stupid simple, and the platforming is imprecise to a huge fault. That last part is pretty important, because nothing ruins the mood quicker than reaching the end of a platforming section and instead of jumping up, the character jumps 4 stories to his death. Shame, since the mood and visuals are easily the best thing this game has going for it.

The first couple of chapters are really great. You get to run around these beautiful, open locations. It feels like everywhere you go there's something cool to see (architecture, animals, collectibles). But starting in the second chapter, the game begins to feel more linear, mostly due to the addition of a mechanic that actively prevents you from anything other than making a beeline from enclosed location to enclosed location. The rest of the game progresses in the same kind of way, creating this upside down pyramid of limitation on how far you can explore. By the end of the game, you'll literally be running a circular maze to do puzzles. Understand that there is a thematic reason for this progression, but it kind of drags a lot of the fundamental problems with this game into the spotlight.

Outside of visiting a bunch of cool locations, there really isn't that much to do. The puzzles are easy and the platforming is restrictive. Huge missed opportunity with the vocalize command, since its really only used to initiate cutscenes and solve puzzles (read: open doors). Oh yeah, sometimes you can sing along with the soundtrack. No where in the game is it more than just 'something you can do.'

All in all, I found the first couple of chapters delivered an amazing sense of exploration and wonder, but the game lost a lot of its luster once every location became a bunch of hallways. Recommended only if you have the patience to sit through the slow sections to get to some great visuals.

After a painful beginning to what I thought would be an underwhelming experience, RiME really shocked me with how deep its story was willing to go. The problems I had with the game were replaced with a wonderfully gentle ride through heaven, and I can't express enough how shocking it was how much I ended up loving this game. The puzzles, the graphics, the story all made for an experience so incredible it was worth the confusing introduction.

If you told me 30 minutes into this game that I would fall in love with RiME and it would end up being one of my favorite games of all time, I probably would have laughed. I could have given an infinite amount of reasons why I wouldn't recommend this: it was glitchy, boring, a walking simulator, and the puzzles had no challenge to them. Let me be clear about this: I HATED playing this game for the first hour of it, but a lot of my complaints slowly... disappeared as I progressed through the game.

Before buying this game, I didn't know much about it. All I knew was the graphics reminded me of Breath of the Wild, and it was a puzzle game with very bright colors. I didn't bother to look further into it before buying because it was on sale for $5 and just thought of it as a quick buy. I had very low expectations before going in, and they were pretty much met with the beginning. I had trouble with the controls, the story seemed slow and stereotypical with the [spoiler]amnesia[/spoiler] and such. The music and visuals were good from the start, though.

As I got further and further in, my opinion slowly changed. I started to enjoy the puzzles more after getting the hang of the controls, and the story took turns I really didn't expect. [spoiler]The ending was absolutely heartbreaking, and wrapped up the story in a perfect way.[/spoiler]

The story is good, but not great.  What I enjoyed most was having the ability to explore chapter by chapter, without having to worry about a huge open world.  Some people don't like collectibles, but I do and I enjoyed that part of it as well.  I also liked that once you completed the game, you could go back into each chapter and pick up anything you missed.   Best of all, it has achievements that are not ridiculously hard to get, but do require a bit of work.  Just the right balance, I think.

Issues:
 I had trouble using my 360 controller with the game -- some days it would work, the next day no.  

When I had to use keyboard/mouse the view would go out of bounds of the area you were in, especially when you were near a wall or cliff face, making it impossible to see.

The perspective was kind of wonky at times, but not enough to make it unplayable.

Overall a great game, that I would play again.

时隔一年来重温二周目。还是被虐到泪流满面。这是我入steam真正玩的第一个游戏。从此以后就对这种故事性很强的解谜游戏一发不可收拾。这一类游戏很适合不太有操作的萌新妹子们。

1.画风、剧情和配乐都非常非常棒，气氛烘托非常到位。游戏过程中代入感非常强。
2.解谜难度中等偏简单，不烧脑。
3.故事叙述细腻，到最后一刻恍然大悟的时候能感受到很强烈的震撼。
4.全收集的难度相对比较大，在一些地图的犄角旮旯里，建议体验一遍流程后再跟着攻略做全收集。对剧情影响不是特别大。
5.同场景的探索路径不唯一，地图也相对比较复杂，对路痴不太友好。
6.指引环节相对有些薄弱，二周目依然会遇到不知道小狐狸去了哪里的困惑，但也给了玩家自由探索的余地。
7.建议打折的时候入手。


以下关于剧透。

这是一个关于接受的故事。
叙事分为否认-愤怒-质疑-沮丧-接受五个章节，整体非常的流畅，柔和。
到最后一章发现死掉的是小男孩的时候有些出乎意料。
忽然明白前期的所有敌人伙伴其实都是在以自己的方式爱着这个小男孩。(大鸟是阻止小主人公去发现悲伤的真相。狐狸和守护者则是用生命帮助小主人公探索真相的过程。)
等到最后时空对转，一直螺旋向上却到了灯塔的底端，小男孩接受现实，和其他亡魂纵身跃向星海的那一刻直接泪崩。
一周目为小主人公勇敢接受死亡流泪。
二周目为父亲摸索着孩子的遗物，和母亲孩子再次同框，并最终接受至亲至爱离世的现实，解开心结而流泪。
就像有一个成就里说的一样
""Accept things as they are.""

我已纵身入星海。

I tend to avoid games that are too open ended/minimalist as I don't really like to walk around trying to find what to do next.

The puzzles are mildly challenging but not frustrating. There were maybe 3-4 of points where I was stuck for 10 minutes, but the solutions were always obvious in retrospect. I only truly got stuck at one point and it turned out that it was just an issue of screen brightness (I couldn't see a ledge that was supposed to be obvious). I never needed to stop and look up a guide to proceed.

However, [i]RiME[/i] is a much longer game, with more variety in its areas and types of puzzles. Both games have some fantasy land you are in, along with some mystic themes, where you are left to figure out what is happening. The difference there is that [i]AER[/i] had lore via text and a few NPCs, whereas [i]RiME[/i] has no text or dialogue at all, to my recollection. Nevertheless, I would say that [i]RiME[/i]'s story is much quicker to realize by the time you see the ending moments, and it had a much heavier impact on me.

Anyway, I am not quite good at reviewing artistic games like these, because there is usually minimalism in the plot design (or at least for most of the game), thus I can't really discuss that. And they tend to be games where you simply navigate and progress, solving puzzles. [i]RiME[/i] is broken up into 5 sections, each with a different environment that adds onto the puzzles you have been doing, and at some points, even adds enemies for you to avoid or ""defeat"" in a particular way.

1) It was greatly enjoyable to search for all the hidden collectibles and discover their own meanings by myself. I think not only the collectibles but also all the other elements of this game such as the monsters, the fox, and even how you should solve some of the puzzles have implications related to the story.

2) Puzzles and controls were not that hard or repetitive, which I also liked. Some of the motions maybe a little confusing and awkward when climbing walls, but the scenery is so satisfying that none of those seem to matter that much while playing.

3) Soundtrack is AMAZING. It really  enhances the immersion to the game and the story.

4) Except the first chapter, the mood of the game may be a little frustrating but quite thrilling at the same time, which I also pretty much enjoyed.

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who liked playing The Legend of Zelda and who loves finding details with symbolic meanings.

Нужно бежать по прямому мосту, но когда жмешь W, герой бежит и упирается в левую часть моста, W+D - в правую. Просто прямо бежать без геймпада невозможно. Так и дергаешься в конвульсиях целую минуту.

Jokes and spoilers aside. 
RiME is a lovely game where you explore the mysterious island and trying to figure the way out of it through puzzles. 
Graphics: The visuals of this game are just gorgeous and breathaking. Smooth animations with rich details. 
Gameplay: Casual, relaxing 'walking simulator'-you're exploring the island, solving puzzles (most of them are quite easy, yet with each level they are getting bit complicated), sometimes can be bit clunky during climbing (specially camera) but nothing what can ruin your experience.
Story: Without saying a single word, the game managed to 'tell' powerful story- especially when you paying attention to little details such paintings or statues. Exploration rewards players with more information (it kinda reminds me Dark Souls games when you must work out to get piece of information and also using imagination ((or you can go to wiki where it's spoiler-free, but where's fun in that?)) 
Sound: In short- it's beautiful. Sealing the atmosphere and capturing emotions excellently.
Last thought: While RiME isn't perfect (having few flaws) and the plot twist (or even type of the game) definitelly ain't for everyone, i'd highly recommended it anyway. Sometimes you just want to lie back a bit, chill & discover the unknown.

Relatively simple ""adventure"" gameplay bolsters a story that manages to be vague without being esoteric, and which becomes increasingly understandable as the ending approaches.

Presentation: The game looks good. The art design isn't technically impressive, but it's stylistically good. The music is really, really good. The game seems a little poorly optimized, in that my Vega 56 was humming rather loudly the entire time on Ultra at 1440p (with TSAA), but it was 60 FPS throughout the game as I could tell.

Mechanics: The gameplay of Rime is fairly basic. You can run around, jump, roll, interact with things, or yell. I never encountered a use for rolling, but the others get plenty of use. You primarily solve environmental puzzles and do light platforming. Neither is difficult, but that's not really the focus of this game. There are collectibles scattered throughout the world that you can find; most are meaningless, but at least one is related to the game's story.

Story: You play as a little boy in a world with no other people, there're no voiced lines, you have an animal friend. I didn't really have any clue what was going on until maybe an hour before the end, and even now there are elements I'm unsure of. As I mentioned when talking about the mechanics, there's one set of collectibles which seems to describe the game's story, and after the game's finished there's a pretty big hint in the Main Menu, but I wasn't able to find all of the former, and even with the latter as mentioned there are still things I'm curious about. Overall I think it broaches a meaningful subject in an interesting way.

Worth pointing out: I finished this in 5 hours. Is this worth $30? H*ll no. $15? Heck no. $10? If you're desperate for a game to play. $5? Yes.",1555185107,1555185293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

_______________________

PROS  
+ Beautiful art style.  Everything is richly coloured and detailed but at the same time a bit blocky.    
+ The soundtrack is amazing.  There are very emotional swelling pieces of music throughout the game that add a whole new level of detail to the experience.
+ Story.  Without ever saying a word Rime gives us an amazing story in great detail.  It uses powerful visuals, music and level design to push forward its narrative.
+ Excellent level design on the whole.  It is a very corridor exploration game when it is ushering you into the next area or trying to get on with the story but there are also some tougher puzzles that will have you needing some time to think how to progress.
+The sounds.  All the sounds in the game feel very real and match the environment. Everything from the waves crashing onto the beach, the thunder, the slap of your bare feet on sand or stone to the seagulls screetching are organic and sound amazing.
________________________

CONS
- Some parts of the game drag out a bit too long for me.  
- Controls can be a bit frustrating, especially in some of the platforming parts.
________________________

I’m not going to spoil Rime in any way.  It is a game with a really strong story where you are firmly in the shoes of the protagonist and are discovering this strange world exactly as he is.  It reminds me a lot of the old school Tomb Raider games where we find ourselves in self-contained areas that we have to traverse and pull levers in order to advance.  Rime has a ton of places to explore and a tons of screenshots waiting to be taken.  If you want to delve into a world that is (mostly) non-threatening and live out a story then you need Rime in your library.

Nonetheless, I wanted to give the game the chance to stand on its own merits irrespective of what other people are advertising it as... and there are still quite a few problems with it.

* The puzzles are not the Myst-type point-and-click puzzles but the sort from Portal or Talos Principle which involve picking up and moving around different objects with the 'use' key. I personally prefer the Myst style, but irrespective of that the puzzles here are simpler and not especially challenging.
* There also weren't very many of them. In fact, the world seems 'larger' than it needs to be, with a lot of time spent just getting from one place to another which is not helped by how slow your top speed is. The game is arguably more of a platformer than a puzzle game, but the platforming is also pretty straightforward and isn't very satisfying: it's always pretty clear where to go, and your movement is pretty restricted; it doesn't feel nimble and quick the way, say, the Sly Cooper games did. 
* As it progresses the game attempts to get increasingly symbolic and 'psychological', but it's not especially compelling or even really all that important. There really wasn't a lot *to* the game looking back; I was able to power through it in a little under a day.

If you came here looking for a Myst-like ""Island Puzzle"" game you are better off playing The Witness, Quern, or even Talos Principle; even if that's not what you were specifically expecting I can't say I'd recommend it unless the game is expanded in the future to be less full of itself and more full of actual content.",1554590123,1554590123,False,24,2,0.454148471355438232,4,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Aaaah![/h1]

This game really surprised me. I didn’t expect much, I expected a half assed attempt at a walking simulator but I’ve a great platformer/puzzle game with amazing art, soundtrack and story.

You wake up on the beach not knowing what happened and start your journey. At first you take your time to admire the scenery because this game is really beautiful. Simplistic cell-shaded graphics was a good choice for artistic design. There’s also no hud so nothing get in a way and can fully immerse in the world.
The story is really sad in this one, it’s beautiful but when you realize what’s happening you understand how sad the story really is.

Gameplay is pretty basic. You run around in an open environment and explore every corner of it. Although it’s not necessary to explore everything, I highly suggest you do that. You progress the game by solving puzzles and collecting some items. Puzzles are not too hard so they don’t break the flow of the game. This is really more of a narrative game than puzzle, so difficult puzzles would just ruin the experience.

Every level is different and represents something else. You’ll climbing, uncovering secrets, avoid monsters, run, jump and yell. Yes there’s a lot of yelling. You interact with thing by yelling. There’s also a cute friendly fox who will guide you through the levels.
The only downsides I notices are that camera angles sometimes are annoying and climbing controls could be better.

Graphically the game looks stunning. The visual are very clean and minimalistic from the first sight, but there’s so much detail everywhere. Levels are very well crafted. Overall graphics are a work of art. Although the performance can be little disappointing. I don’t know why this runs worse than AC origins. I had to lower some settings to get 60fps and even then I experience big fps drops. Optimization is not very good.

Soundtrack just adds another layer of awesomeness to this game. It fits the aesthetics of the game very well and makes it so much better.

I recommend this game for those who enjoys good stories, well balanced gameplay and beautiful visuals. Don’t miss this game.

In der Welt von Rime gibt es sehr viel zu sammeln und zu erkunden, was sehr positiv ist, da man dadurch mehr über die Insel und die Geschichte erfährt. Die Schwierigkeit der Rätsel ist von leicht bis schwer vorhanden. Also ein sehr guter Mix von allem.

Einzig was man vielleicht als Kritik erwähnen kann, wäre die Spielzeit. Man ist mit knapp 10 Stunden durch mit dem Spiel.

Definitiv zu empfehlen.

It reminded me of other walking sims/puzzle platformers and like others, it was pleasing to look at, to listen to and to explore.

The pacing was also quite nice, with the sense of urgency and danger rising with each new location.

Since I was streaming, I skipped many of the collectibles. Luckily, the game has a great menu for selecting previous stages to acquire what I missed so if I ever go back to try to 100%, I don't have to replay it all from the beginning.

While I wasn't super impressed by the story/ending, it was really the paths that it took me through that mattered to me. When I struggled with a puzzle, it was generally because of some simple thing that I had looked over or didn't notice.

Some think it's a walking simulator. Others think it's all bling no ding.

For me personally, Rime was as captivating and enchanting as some of the more well known titles such as Abzu and Shadow of the Colossus, similarly, Journey too.  

Rim is an interesting game in that yes, most puzzles are easily solvable, the story is a bit vague, and the gameplay is limited, but behind these rather minor concerns, you have an extremely vibrant, absolutely extravagantly designed game. The visuals are utterly astounding, some of the best, most timeless art style's paired with an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack that makes you weep and soar in all the right moments. 

I had an absolute blast playing this game. I had my fair share of frustration with certain aspects, but the pro's here absolutely outweighed the cons for me. Not many games make me genuinely cry. Kudos to Tequila Works for making such a mesmerising, and truly beautiful narrative that I could lose myself in for some of the most emotional 6 hours I've had in a while. Truly, thank you.

Pro's:

Timeless, bright and diverse art style reminiscent of the Wind Waker days.
Truly captivating and wonderful soundtrack that can and does take you on an adventure of its own.
Easy control scheme with some interesting game elements.
Vague, but decipherable story with heavy themes and strong emotional appeal.
A good dose of wonder and mystery as you unravel said story to unveil the meanings and symbolism. 
Not a 'hold your hand' styled game, get yourself out there and learn for yourself!
Well balanced puzzles that promote progress and a little thought without stopping you dead in your tracks long enough to get flustered.
Diverse environments to experience and explore, never feeling dull.

Cons: 

Though I listed this as a pro, it can also be a con. Puzzles are relatively easy, some more intermediate and even hard puzzles requiring multiple aspects of gameplay, such as the use of lights and your ability to create them would have been a bonus here.
Missable collectables create the need  for a rerun which ultimately detracts from the purity of a one time run, sadly diminishing  the emotional weight.
Somewhat slow character movement may prove annoying at times.
Steep price point for a standard 4-6 hour experience, and a 6-8 hour experience if you want to 100% it. Also expensive when considering the soundtrack is not included.


Honestly can't find much to fault with this game. I had a wonderful experience, and I hope you do too.

I strongly recommend this game to anyone wanting a relaxing and heartfelt story, you can tell this game was a labour of love. 

If you like relaxing puzzle adventure games then you'll most likely enjoy RiME. There is no dialogue, combat, health or even text (apart from button prompts) in this game so it ends up just being a relaxing experience which you're supposed to unwind and take at your own leisure. The only two things you can really do in this game is walk around and interact with things, which you'll be doing a lot to solve puzzles and discover collectables. If that doesn't sound appealing then it might not be for you.

The visuals of the game is absolutely stunning in my opinion as it uses shape and form to really help the environments and structures pop, add on top of that great colour and lighting and you have some amazing looking levels that you can just stare at for hours. The use of reflections in the metals and the shaders for the water look fantastic too. I honestly can't get enough of the visuals of this game!

The soundtrack is phenomenal and you owe it to yourself to listen to it. If you love the Ghibli soundtracks then this will blow you away. During gameplay it uses audio cues and blends them with the music to help make certain moments really stand out and it really adds to the feelings you'll be experiencing throughout.

Performance wise the game is mostly great, I noticed there was a huge performance hit with SSAA turned on, no matter what other settings you changed (im running a RTX 2070 and i7 7700k) it would always dip below 60fps. Turning it down to TXAA or FXAA will increase performance greatly. Other than that it ran great for me!

LO BUENO:
- El gran punto a favor y lo más destacable del juego es su calidad artística. Los escenarios son putamente preciosos, y siempre te quedarás mirándolos y apreciando el escenario.
- La banda sonora es correcta, pero logra encajar perfectamente con todos los momentos del juego.
- Las animaciones están muy trabajadas: Cómo baja una ladera, la forma de rodar, la forma de correr... Todos los movimientos están muy logrados.
- La historia no parece ser gran cosa y puede parecer apenas inexistente, pero todo cobra sentido a medida que va terminando el juego, con un gran final.
LO MALO:
- En un juego donde destacan las plataformas puede ser bastante frustrante que algunos saltos no los haga el personaje de forma correcta, o que tengas que pasar sí o sí por un saliente específico, y no medio metro mas a la derecha. Además, muchas veces el personaje se quedará trabado en esquinas o con algún objeto aunque no lo estés ni siquiera rozando, lo que supongo que será un fallo con las áreas de colisión.
- Los puzzles no son para nada complicados. Quiero entender que no buscan lastrar la aventura o atascar al jugador, pero sí que habría agradecido un par de puzzles que tuvieran algo más de complejidad.
- Aunque el juego intenta que conectes con él, yo no he logrado sentirme unido al personaje y apenas he logrado empatizar (a excepción de un par de momentos).
- Durante gran parte del juego se me ha hecho divertido el juego, pero tengo que decir una cosa: El tercer nivel es, en mi opinión, innecesariamente largo, y una zona que me terminó aburriendo a partir de la segunda mitad del mismo.
CONCLUSIÓN:

J'étais parti pour pour parler d'expérience mais je me ravise et parle bien ici d'un jeu.

RIME se veut être l'héritier de jeu comme ICO et Shadow of Colossus (SOC), c'est revendiqué et c'est une évidence.
Mais tout le monde n'a pas le talent de Fumito Ueda ou des art designers de ces derniers pour immerger, voir submerger, le joueur.

Le scénario est original et, pourtant rompu à tout les types de scénario, je dois bien avouer n'avoir compris ce qui se passait réellement qu'au dernier chapitre du jeu.
l'immersion dans celui-ci est bi-polaire, mon sentiment est que les développeurs hésitent en permanence entre y allait à fond comme le fond donc ICO et SOC, et se retenir de nous immerger plus pour justement rendre le jeu accessible même à un enfant de 8 ans. J'entends par là qu'ils éviteraient de vouloir trop nous impliquer pour ne pas trop nous émouvoir.
Il en résulte un une fable très poétique à laquelle il manque ce petit truc nous permettant de nous attacher réellement, on est plus spectateur qu'acteur.

RIME arrive donc toucher du bout du doigt ICO ET SOC sans pour autant les atteindre.
Mais ne vous y trompez pas RIME est un excellent jeu, avec des graphismes au parti pris graphique très inspiré, un gameplay minimaliste (trop d'ailleurs? simpliste?) qui le rend accessible à la majorité des joueurs, tous âges confondus.

La camera qui suit nos aventures est ici proche d'être parfaite mais est, sans que cela soit à outrance ou de façon récurrente, gâchée par de petits couacs gâchant justement cette immersion.
On se retrouve contre un mur et la caméra est face à celui-ci, donnant à l'écran un joli écran gris clair ou gris foncé fonction du décor. les quatre ou cinq fois où je l'ai vécu sur la totalité peuvent paraître anecdotique mais personnellement, quand je vis une histoire j'aime bien ne pas en être décroché pour ce genre de choses. Et c'est d'autant plus dangereux dans la partie lorsqu'on est sur une corniche...

Ce sont sans doute ces points qui me font ranger ce jeu une fois fini, là où je suis retourné quatre une cinq fois sur ICO ET SOC.

Pourtant le jeu bénéficie d'un level design extrêmement  bien fichu, au point parfois de s'y perdre.
Du moins jamais longtemps, car le jeu saura vous prendre par la main pour vite vous faire poursuivre l'aventure.
J'aimerai avoir ce genre de level design plus souvent dans des jeux vidéo.
C'est le gros point positif numéro 1

Il reste alors à perler de la partie sonore et musicale.
Ici par contre le but est atteint, si les bruitages sont minimalistes, ils sont suffisant et tombent toujours à pic.
Quant à la musique, sans être mythologique, historique, ou inoubliable, elle reste superbe avec une montée en puissance frêle mais présente toujours au bon moment. C'est le gros point positif numéro 2 du jeu.

En conclusion un très bon jeu, un chouillat trop court (10h de jeu minimum cela aurait été bien), qui oscille entre le très bon est l'excellent mais qui n'atteint pas hall of fame du fait de ses hésitations et de ses rares petites imperfections.
Je le conseille donc mais pas au prix fort, le payer entre 7 et 12 euros me semble correct.",1552205523,1552205523,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What can I say about RIME? I'm not sure I have the words to do it justice, so I'll just use some quotes from celebrities:

""It's all been rather lovely""
John Le Messurier, actor in the BBC comedy 'Dad's army', said those words before he died. He was ruminating on his life and not this game, but he probably would have said the same thing if he'd ever played it.

""RIME was alright to play, I guess. I prefer manlier activities like sticking my boot / shotgun / chainsaw up a demons butt. No! I'm not crying! Just got some....um... acidic demonic blood in my eye...yeah....stings like a mutha! Pass me a tissue""
The DOOM guy 

""What did I think of RIME? Emotions are for girls......now, pass me a tissue. I got some, er, acidic alien blood in my eye, and it, uh, stings like the mutha-****** of all mutha-******s. I, uh, need to dab it out before the, um, acid eats all the way through my brain. Yeah! That's it. Duke, you crafty fox! Those suckers will never know you were crying. Hey! Wait! Is that thing still recording?""
Duke Nukem

I can't really sum up the plot of RIME too much, because it kind of doesn't have one - at least, not in a conventional sense. You play a boy who wakes up shipwrecked on a mysterious island, that is gradually revealed to be far less normal than it first appears. Despite looking like an ancient place in the mediterranean it has robots, shadowy creatures, strange mechanisms seemingly powered by magic, and an evil giant bird that really doesn't seem to like you very much.

How did you get there? What is going on? What are you meant to be doing? It's one of THOSE games....where what little you get told is 80% visual storytelling, and the other 20% comes from the moody / sombre / melancholy / soaring music. No dialogue. No text. 

The ending isn't too ambiguous as to its meaning, but until then it's just a ""feeling"" the game gives you whilst the island gets more and more weird. Not weird in a Far Cry 3 drug trip kind of way, yet enough that you'll question how this place came to be, what it's for, and what every activity you're doing in it is all about.

It's a fairly gentle platformer with some mild puzzles, and takes a few hours to finish. I honestly can't make the game play sound anymore exciting than that, because it isn't. If you can't get swept up in the beautiful, simple, music or get hooked by the emotive narrative (such as it is) / sense of discovery, then the relatively sedate action isn't likely to satisfy.

It's not a twitch platformer, or has mind bending conundrums. It's ""nice"", and will maybe punch you in the feels come the conclusion. I'm not that familiar with games of this type on PC, and the only one that springs to mind would be a dead giveaway as to the ending of RIME if I named it as the two aren't all that dissimilar. It's relatively comparable to the playstation games ICO / Shadow Of The Colossus / The Last Guardian mechanically, and in it's themes of love, loss and regret.

I wouldn't have said it matched the last two for emotional oomph, but it's a moot point if you don't own a playstation, and to be fair to RIME it plays better than any of them. If a long play time is your thing then this may disappoint, as I think it took about 7 hours to finish. Though that's not so short for the type of game that it is, and what's there is really well made. 

The production values are quite high, it's glitch free, and runs fairly well, so I'd recommend it...if it sounds like your ""cup of tea"", of course. I just can't say what that ""cup of tea"" exactly is without spoiling it....

Não tinha ideia que a história me proporcionaria uma experiência tão f0da assim. Me arrependo de ter subjugado o jogo por ser indie...os caras são muito bons no que fazem, e me surpreenderam MUITO!

Mesmo tendo alguns contras, se fosse pontuar o game de 0 a 10, minha nota seria 10. Pois fazia tempo que não me sentia assim com um game!!


PROS:
* História. A história é de longe o que tem de melhor nesse jogo...nossa, que história envolvente e dramática. Sem sequer uma fala durante o jogo todo, aos poucos vamos descobrindo e entendendo o que aconteceu. E o desfecho final...meu Deus, que coisa magnífica...um uso do simbolismo espetacular!! Simplesmente magnífica a história!

* Pra mim, a trilha sonora é meio caminho para uma obra ficar incrível, e a trilha desse game é algo digno de premio! Os caras fizeram um ótimo trabalho. Sempre temos um música agradável acompanhando o gameplay, que se encaixa perfeitamente com o estilo (game sem diálogos). Porém, nos momentos ápices da história, a trilha aumenta fazendo com que o drama ganhe força. Demais!!!

* Não tem como não falar dos gráficos desse jogo...que obra de arte!! o Jogo foi muito bem construído...cada detalhe faz parecer que foi pintado a mão de tão belo que é.

* A ambientação do jogo é ótima. Passamos por vários locais diferentes, com estilos e detalhamentos diferentes, praias, florestas, ruínas, porém, sempre da impressão de que estamos no mesmo lugar. Achei isso magnífico!

* O tempo de gameplay é curto, mesmo fazendo os 100%. Mas mesmo assim não acentuo o tempo de jogo como um contra, pois acho que é exatamente o tempo ideal para mostrar tudo o que falei acima. Já diz o ditado, ""menos é mais""!




CONTRAS:
* As vezes os comandos são meio lentos pra responder, as vezes não respondem com exatidão;

* Puzzles são relativamente fáceis (apesar de que é bem complicado encontrar todos os colecionáveis);

On passe son temps à escalader juste parce qu'on voit qu'il y a des zones dans lesquelles on peut, donc c'est sûrement que ça doit être utile.... Les énigmes sont là juste pour faire faire quelque chose au joueur.... Tout m'a semblé très artificiel d'un point de vue gameplay...

Au final c'est un grand couloir. Aucune liberté d'action, on suit un chemin tout tracé... Mais j'ai quand même dû regarder deux trois fois sur le net pour des énigmes dans lesquelles j'avais pas remarqué tel élément, ou parce que j'avais pas vu tel truc sur lequel je pouvais grimper. 

Alors au départ c'est plaisant, les décors sont enchanteurs, la direction artistique maîtrisée, la musique nous plonge aussi dedans.... Mais arrivé à l'avant dernier ""monde"" (les grottes avec des arbres), j'ai trouvé ça vraiment pénible.... Je ne comprenais pas la finalité de mes actions en fait.... J'ai insisté juste parce que je savais la fin proche et que je voulais savoir ce qu'il en était...

Et le final.... C'est censé être bim boum les émotions dans ta face, le bon gros ""ah d'accord bon c'est donc ça!"", pour moi ça a juste fait ""ah bah ok, c'est cool"".... C'est vraiment tout ça pour ça.... Le jeu se veut très narratif et profond dans sa signification, mais on a passé tout le jeu à pousser des cubes et à escalader des murs, je trouve ça vraiment contradictoire.....
Même la musique a fini par me saouler avec ses thèmes à la fois larmoyants et grandiloquents...

Et d'un point de vue technique le jeu est vraiment optimisé avec les pieds, se mettant à saccader régulièrement dans des zones où pourtant y'a pas tant de choses à afficher.

Brothers a tale of two sons, par exemple, m'a vraiment plus ému dans la catégorie ""jeu avec une fin inattendue et pleine d'émotion"" parce que tout le jeu est logique. On suit la quête de deux gamins qui veulent sauver leur pêre, donc toutes nos actions ont une signification....

Rime is an adventure game with puzzle elements from Tequila Softworks. I picked it up for $3 and went in with fairly low expectations due to the mix of positive and negative reviews on the store page. I actually ended up being pleasantly surprised! Rime is a beautiful game that tells a story in an interesting way, and it does it with relatively few frustrations. 

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
[list][*]Rime really is beautiful, I love the aesthetic here and it remains pretty consistent throughout the game. The first three chapters are particularly beautiful, with the fourth being quite haunting. There were a couple of textures that looked a bit rough to me, but really good overall. I also think that all of the creatures in the game are really well designed.

[*]One thing I was quite pleased with was that the puzzles were quite straightforward. There were definitely a couple of puzzles that had me stumped for a minute or two, but for the most part I found them easy to figure out. Now, not everyone will think that’s a good thing, but personally I think Rime is much more of an adventure game than it is a puzzle game. The puzzles are certainly fun, but the real meat is exploring the world Tequila created and piecing together the story. I don’t think Rime would work as well as it does if less-experienced puzzle players were constantly forced to check guides/walkthroughs to figure out how to carry on.

[*]One thing you might need a guide for though, is the collectibles. I think there are four types of collectibles in the game, but there may be others that I just never saw. Seemingly they’re tied to most of the game’s achievements, as beating the game only got me 8/31. I’m usually not interested in collectibles, but I am actually interested in going back through to try and get some/all of them, which is a rarity in games. I think it adds some good replayability, especially if you’re a die-hard achievement hunter.

[*]There are some dangers in Rime, I won’t go into detail about what the dangers are lest I spoil the game, but I was glad to see a little danger thrown in, just to add some tension to the game. Though even with the tension in some parts, Rime is still a pretty relaxing game and I really enjoyed just sitting back and playing through it, it’s a good experience.

[*]I think the story is quite good, there’s some mystery that kind of strings you along through the game, and then once you see the ending of the game the story of the whole game is revealed to you. I don’t want to say too much more than that, so I don’t spoil it, but I felt satisfied by the ending. I think a second playthrough is probably required to make sense of everything though, as there are a couple of things I’m left confused by.[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list][*]One thing that I noticed other reviews picking up on is the climbing mechanics in the game, with that being mentioned in some of the negative reviews. I don’t really understand why this was an issue for some people, because while it wasn’t quite as interesting as something like Grow Home, it felt like it worked similarly to an Assassins Creed or Tomb Raider game to me (just with a little less animation). This is an adventure game rather than a climbing-focused game after all, so I think what’s there is about as good as I would expect it to be.[/list]

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
[list][*]My biggest disappointment with Rime was that it doesn’t have a photo mode. This game is beautiful, and it’s exactly the kind of game that a photo mode would work really well for. I get that this probably isn’t a huge issue for everyone, but I was definitely disappointed by it.

[*]Performance wasn’t quite as good as I expected, I had to turn the settings down a fair bit more than I would have liked and even then, it wasn’t running great. The visuals are great, but the game is simplistic and it’s not like it’s photo-realistic, I expected it to be easier to run. Probably not an issue for people with beefy rigs, but if you’re on a mid-range gaming laptop or PC like I am, it might be worth keeping in mind.

[*]There was a little too much underwater stuff for my liking. Rime really doesn’t look anywhere near as nice or play as well during the underwater sections, and while I really enjoyed the rest of the game, I could not wait for the underwater sections to be over with.[/list]

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]

I ended up enjoying Rime a lot more than I expected. It's a relaxing journey through some beautiful places, but don't come here looking for a challenge. It's worth playing through at least once. However, I don’t think there’s anything here that makes this game worth $30, I’d wait for it to be $15 or less.

[u]Reseña Spoiler-free[/u]

Si tuviera que describir este juego con una sola palabra sería [b]hermoso[/b]. Todos los detalles visuales están cuidadísimos, desde lo que ves hasta lo que oyes (con una maravillosa canción de Lindsey Sterling, no te digo más). El cielo, el agua de lluvia cayendo sobre la piedra, el día y la noche... No te vas a cansar de observar todo tu entorno; y es que de eso va precisamente el siguiente punto, de buscar coleccionables. Si de algo se ha preocupado Tequila Works es de que tengas que andar rebuscando en cada esquina y cada saliente en busca de un sinfín de coleccionables diferentes: conchas, cerraduras, trajes...

La historia es maravillosa y, en pos de no hacer ningún tipo de spoiler, me limitaré a decir que deberías jugarlo sin ver nada: ni gameplays, ni walktroughs, ni siquiera guías por escrito.

E hilando con el tema de las guías, he de decir que mi mayor pega para con este juego es que la dificultad es [i]nula[/i]: los ""puzzles"" son demasiado fáciles, el plataformeo es para niños pequeños (con los bordes CONVENIENTEMENTE cagados por palomas) y el mapa es muy lineal. La única dificultad real del juego son, como ya he mencionado antes, los coleccionables y los [b]logros[/b]. Cazadores de logros: estáis jodidos sin una guía.

[h1]En resúmen[/h1]
[list]
    [*]El juego es, visualmente una pasada, una historia profunda y cautivadora.
    [*]No necesitas tener el cerebro 100% conectado, con un par de neuronas te será suficiente para pasártelo.
    [*]Cuenta con una rejugabilidad artificial en forma de coleccionables y logros; de hecho, es imposible conseguir el 100% en una sola partida :)

Скорость передвижения слишком тягомотная для такого размера локаций, загадки в духе ""найди фигню, чтобы на неё крикнуть и включить"" уже в первые 10 минут на первой же локации наскучивают (возможно, дальше будет лучше, но я не вытерплю, извините!), плюс попутно ничего не происходит Ну, как ничего - вон, кабанчики, вон лиса лает, задолбала уже, но я именно про какое-то развитие истории. Она развивается, конечно, но лишь по чуть-чуть, поэтапно, а между переходами - ничего. 

Вообще эту игру принято сравнивать с Journey по своей сути - тут я согласен, но! В Journey была достаточно высокая скорость передвижения с интересными моментами скольжения, благодаря чему это самое движение не надоедало до самого конца. И о конце - Journey не в пример короче, у неё почти идеальная продолжительность для такого типа игр. Здесь же я не готов терпеть ради концовки шесть часов этого занудного скитания по локациям. Большинство хороших симуляторов ходьбы делают это менее занудно, ну и продолжительность у них, как правило, соответствующая.

TL/DR: I think this game is excellent [i] IF [/i] you are a story motivated player.

At first glance, RiME seems to be a fairly simple and cute puzzle game. But throughout the first region, the game starts to feed you small pieces of information, just enough to hint at something more. 
And boy was there more, and it was  a feel train.

Its hard to truly convey what made the story good without spoiling it. So just trust me, its good.

RiME is an artistic masterpiece. Each individual level has distinct moods. (That later have more important meaning)
These moods are represented through fantastic choices in colour, lighting, weather and the soundtrack. When you finish the game, and understand the story, the levels feel so much better designed now that you know what they are meant to be. 

The puzzles may have been simple, but I felt like the increase of complexity was smooth. It introduced the new concepts fast enough to keep the simple game play from stagnating. 
It is NOT like other puzzle games like ""Portal"" where you might spend ages in a single room. I feel it was purposely made the way it was so it did not subtract from the flow of the story.

[b] If you are after a difficult puzzle platformer, this game isn't for you. [/b]

[b] If you are after an unique approach to story telling, I honestly couldn't recommend this more. [/b]

I suggest sitting down and dedicating an entire session to knock this out in one sitting. Its on the short side so it shouldn't be to hard.

[h1] 序言	[/h1]
   《霜华》首次亮相于2013年的科隆游戏展览会，在展览会上，一则两分钟的预告片便让它带动了在场大部分人的心。如梦中仙境一般美妙的景色，悠扬又牵动人心的音乐，很难不让人想到《ICO》《风之旅人》等游戏。那时的《霜华》顶着PS4独占的名号，且PS4正是风头正劲的时刻，每个人都想早点玩到这款游戏。

https://www.bilibili.com/video/av746525


   不得不说事物总是充满戏剧性，你越想它，它反而离你越远。

   2016年，已经沉寂了一年半载的开发商Tequila Works宣布，他们将从索尼那边取回游戏的所有权，取消PS4独占，独立完成剩余的开发工作。这一系列操作着实让人感到迷惑，在此之间传出的一些有关开发进度的传言更是让人由粉转黑，质疑跟责难接踵而至，而开发完成的日期更是遥遥无期。

  直到2017年5月，该游戏才正式上架。游戏一经上架，便引起了广泛关注，各方媒体纷纷打出评价，其具体评价就不在此多言，等到总结再说。




[h1] 平平无奇的故事[/h1]



此平平无奇非彼“平平无奇”， 该游戏是一款解密探索类游戏，玩家扮演一位在大海上因为风暴而流落岛上的少年。在一只红色小狐狸的引导下在岛上解密探索的游戏，但随着探索步步前进，事实似乎并非所想象的那样。


游戏全篇从头到尾没有任何有关于剧情的文字提示，游戏玩家想要了解剧情，除了从过场动画能够了解一部分以外，剩下的只能从游戏中的壁画，或者收集物品等方式来了解。这是一种较为隐晦的叙事方法，这种叙事方法的好处在于，只要你把东西收集齐全，把壁画和解谜了解透彻，那么，你的感情会随着其中不断升华，直到结局得到释放。坏处在于，你只要没有把收集物品收集齐全，或者在游玩途中并不是很认真，你就会觉得，整个剧情毫无波澜，平平淡淡，甚至会让你感到有些无聊。

这并不是说玩家有错，而是这种叙事方法本身带来的效果。如果其采用完善的文字说明辅以过场剧情，即使玩家对此本无兴趣，也会了解一二，特别是这种本身不是以玩法为主要
目的的游戏，故事剧情就显得弥足珍贵。而采用这种方法来让玩家了解剧情，如果制作者功力不足，就会让玩家陷入两难境界，玩家知道玩到最后也许会出现反转，剧情或许会得到升华，但与此同时，玩家必须忍受其中平淡的过程，甚至在玩法上也没有什么特别的新奇之处，这就会劝退一大波玩家。


如果想要具体了解剧情，可观看以下部分，以下部分涉及剧透：

游戏的章节一共分为五个部分，而游戏的剧情也可以以此划分，分别是：Denial(否认) ,Anger(愤怒),Bargaining(顽抗)，Depression(沮丧),Acceptance(接受)。

游戏在最开始就可以看到小男孩在孤岛的沙滩上苏醒，苏醒的地方仿佛世外桃源，高大的白塔，清澈的溪流，憨态可掬的小动物，这里的一切都让人让人乐不思蜀，不想离去。这代表着Denial(否认)，表示想要否认某些东西，想要把某些不愉快的事情完全忘怀，沉浸于这个世外桃园之中。

即使再美好的景色也会看腻，随着游戏进度的推进，小男孩将会遇见一只巨大的怪鸟，这只怪鸟仿佛跟小男孩有着什么杀父之仇，夺妻之恨一般（不就偷拿了一个球嘛，至于吗，又不是真的蛋）只要小男孩暴露于阳光之下，不到十秒，这只怪鸟就会从天边飞来叼走小男孩，随出随到。想要通过地表，就必须通过游戏中的一些场景制造遮阴处，躲避怪鸟。这只怪鸟代表了Anger(愤怒)，无处不在的怪鸟代表了无法抑制的愤怒。

到了第三章，游戏已经来到中期，小男孩会不断遇到一些无限循环的场景，除非通过特定的方法找到出路，否则将会迷失于其中，无法自拔。在这寻找出路的同时，小男孩也会发现一些机器人残骸，并通过一些能量球复活了其中之一，并通过其开路。但好景不长，这个机器人最终还是因为能量不足而倒下，倒下同时也投映出部分曾经与小男孩共度过的时光。之后小男孩用另外一个在大树中的能量核心真正复活了另外一个机器人，并唤醒了一大堆的机器人，剧情由此走向第四章。这一章节的主题是Bargaining(顽抗)，表示仍然不相信现实，想要与现实作斗争。

紧接着下来的这一章节，可以看得出来，氛围跟前几章节完全不同，天空中被乌云笼罩，天上下着磅礴大雨，四周被黑暗笼罩，就连小男孩别具特色的哼唱也变成了啜泣。空气中的一切都透露着阴暗，让人感到绝望，沮丧。在这一章节，小男孩的机器人朋友先是成为了开门的钥匙，为小男孩打开最后的大门，紧接着，一路陪伴着小男孩的小狐狸也为了点亮雕像耗尽了最后一丝力量，化为花瓣，随暴风暴雨飘逝。这一切的一切都让小男孩感到无比悲伤，但他还是继续前进，结果在一股神秘力量的侵蚀下变成了雕像。Depression(沮丧)正是这一章节的主题，也是时候面对现实了。

最后一章节画面一转，详细讲述了那个暴风暴雨的夜晚，海上到底发生了些什么。原来最开始被冲进海里的并不是小男孩最开始所想的神秘人，而是他自己。小男孩早已逝去，而这一切的一切，仅仅只是一名痛失爱子的父亲，在绝望中不想面对现实，对现实感到愤懑，想要对抗儿子已逝的现实，但又沮丧地发现，事情早已不可挽回，只能无奈接受这个现实。游戏中的重要物品以钥匙的形式呈现，收集钥匙，解开谜题，也是解开父亲的心结，让这位沉浸于悲伤无法自拔的老父亲，重新面对现实，打开儿子曾经生活过的房间，与之告别。









[h1] 毁誉参半的景色	[/h1]

当我打开这个游戏，见到这个游戏的第一眼，我就被这个游戏所描述的画面吸引住了。清可见底的海水带着点波纹，拍打在沙滩上，沙滩中央出现了游戏Logo，这一高大上的画面顿时将我的注意力完全集中在了这个尚未怎么接触过的游戏上，让我产生了一种期待，游戏的Logo这么美，那游戏里面的风景呢？

最开始，游戏的景色完全没有带来一点失望，甚至可以说，超乎我的预料，毕竟游戏并不是什么3A大作，但它的表现很出色。大海中的孤岛，晶莹透亮的溪流，憨态可掬的小动物，高大的白色建筑，远处的白塔，海中的水母，给我留下了近乎完美的映象。在游戏的最开始，仅仅只是浏览观光风景，跟周围动物互动，探索地图等，就花了我一个多小时的时间。刚刚进入这个奇妙世界的我，差点就被晃花了眼。

剧透：[spoiler] 
在第一章的游戏中有一幕场景非常令人难以忘怀，正是这幕让我坚定了要玩到结局的想法。在那个场景中，触动机关之后，三个蓝色巨型水晶球之间相互呼应，由上至下的视角可以完整地观赏到整个场景，其中的美色难以用言语表达。但在这个美丽场景的背后，却是无尽的悲伤，由下面这个图可以看出，小男孩一家有一名重要成员永远地离开了他们（猜测应该就是小男孩的母亲）。而在水池下方有个隐藏场景（我也是无意中跳进去发现的），到达此处可以解锁一个隐藏成就，由成就Funeral flowers的解释find a nice resting place也可以得知这应该就是小男孩母亲的安息之地。

然而（没错，只要是这种开头肯定有然而），到了第二章画面的表现能力直线下降，画面由原来的鲜艳明亮，色彩鲜明变得颜色单一，灰暗，乌漆嘛黑的场景越来越多。虽然是由地上转到地下，难免变黑，但这种程度的画面实在说不上有多好看，看多了眼睛都不好受。这前后差别之大，不得不让人想到它的经费问题，看来从索尼脱离，自主开发的确对他们有着不小的影响。好在在后面几章，画面的表现能力重新上线，无论是第四章的大雨磅礴给人带来的沉重压抑，还是第五章释然后的平淡，画面都张弛有度，给人一种恰到好处的感觉。	[/spoiler]

说到画面，本作另一个要点就不得不提，那就是掉帧问题。游戏在发售之初就有着掉帧问题，该问题似乎主要是由于D加密导致的,在后来似乎已经解除了。不过在我玩这个游戏的时候，仍然能感受到时不时的卡顿或掉帧，在各种画面设置中，以抗锯齿最能影响掉帧。最为奇特的是，我把画面特效调到最高，流畅程度反而比中低特效好上不少。我的电脑配置是2600x+rx588，似乎游戏对A卡的优化较差，导致我仍然不能流畅玩耍。我玩这个游戏经常就是玩一个小时左右，就得停下来，不然掉帧带来的晕3D导致的强烈眩晕会让我毫无游戏体验，这也是我为啥玩了二十多个小时的原因之一。



[h1] 恰到好处的背景音乐[/h1]
    
    
好的背景音乐在我看来，不一定需要时时刻刻在玩家耳边刷存在感，而是在恰到好处的地方，给人带来惊喜，这样给人带来的震撼感才会更强。如果只是一直在玩家耳边循环播放，那再好听的音乐也只会泯然众人，甚至因为玩家通关不顺导致心情不好等原因，觉得该背景音乐刺耳难听，就跟苍蝇嗡嗡嗡一般（本人因手残深有体会）。而《霜华》并没有这种缺憾，相较游戏的其他方面来说，背景音乐可以说是《霜华》做得最好的一方面了。


游戏的背景音乐可以说是非常贴近背景，林间的静谧，瀑布的喧哗，地下的幽静，都表现得淋漓尽致。特别是谜题解开过后，恢弘壮阔的景色配合恰到好处的背景音乐，让玩家体验更上一层楼。



[h1]并无新意的玩法[/h1]


游戏主要玩法是以在不同的障碍之间跳跃，收集钥匙解开钥匙孔，以及推动方块或移动柱子的视角等方法解谜。大部分游戏中的谜题都很简单，只要找到具体的物品，很容易就能解开，问题在于找到具体的物品。有时候找了半天可能都找不出东西在哪里，这时候你可以放下游戏，去做别的事情，过了一会之后，再回来寻找，可能一下子就能找出物品的所在之地（个人经验），因为东西所在位置并不难找，找不到原因大都是因为陷入思维误区，一直较真只会徒增烦恼。

由于谜题大都比较简单，而有难度的地方就放在了收集物品方面，游戏的收集物品非常之多，而且往往都在一些较为偏僻的角落，所以想要在第一周目就完全收集基本没什么可能，除非看攻略。不过在第一周目并不推荐直接查看攻略，本身游戏剧情存在感就较为薄弱，如果再加上剧透buff，那基本就可以跟游戏剧情说再见了。而且，当你通关一次剧情之后，再回头收集这些物品，你会发现，很多原来较为隐晦的东西都会完整地展现在你眼前。 








  [h1] 总结	[/h1]

    I didn’t hate Rime. I didn’t love Rime. I played Rime for a while, then later, it ended.


游戏在媒体上的评价两极分化严重，部分媒体打出的分数达到了佳作水平，而Gamespot和IGN分别只打出了6分和6.5分，仅仅在及格边缘。


这种现象产生的原因跟游戏的表现手法与优化密切相关，喜欢这种表现手法的游戏玩家爱它爱的要死，而对这种表现手法不感冒的玩家则完全无感，这说不上好与坏，只能说明这款游戏的受众较小。

在我看来，这款游戏可以在7分左右，如果喜欢风景宜人，有着足够耐心并且能够适应隐晦的表现手法的玩家可以推荐一玩，这绝对是你不容错过的游戏！游戏多次进包，大概10块左右就能收到，算是性价比非常高了。",1549862667,1560144397,True,0,0,0.148601487278938293,0,False,False,False,False,,,

RiME is a puzzle/platformer where you travel a mysterious island, learning more about your character as you progress.  Unfortunately, the game is extremely short and I completed it in about 5 hours.  Sure there are collectibles to gather, but considering your character's movement speed, it does not seem like a fun thing to do, even if the lore interests me.  I feel that if my character was able to move even a little faster I would have shaved off a lot of my playtime, but of course, that would break some of the puzzles.  Granted, there are positives about the gameplay, I never had to worry about falling off of ledges or about my jumps being too small, the game will appropriately snap you in place to where you need to jump everytime.

As for the graphics, I really like the art style, however, I feel like there were some optimization issues as I would get consistent framerate drops and some of the shadows would glitch in and out.  There's only one area in the game where I hit a solid, consistent 60fps and it was in one of the prettiest areas near the end of the game, but unfortunately it did not last long.

On its surface, this game is extremely charming, the environments are stunning, and the soundtrack is truly exquisite. But the game itself -- the interaction between player and system is fundamentally unsatisfying -- from the way the character controls down to the puzzles or challenges the game presents to you. 

Your character's movement and animations feel so slow and labored that getting from one point to another in the game genuinely just got bothersome. Even the camera moves at an painfully sluggish pace -- when you're in control, that is. Because Rime loves to fix the camera to a certain point, and then it becomes a guessing game of which direction your character will move in in response to your inputs. While I started out wanting to explore the fantastic-looking world of Rime, by my second or third hour I just wanted to mainline it. By my fourth hour I just wanted to quit. 

There is barely anything to the puzzles you're asked to solve. Zero thinking required. You see something, it clicks immediately, because you've either done this in another game already or it's just that dead obvious, and then you just execute. Next. Where is the payoff, I wonder?

I think that that's the biggest problem with Rime.

RiME es una historia que si no te atrapa con el primer frame de sus gráficos, sin duda lo hará con la primera nota de su banda sonora. Con una calidad espectacular y cuidado hasta el más mínimo detalle, RiME es un título que no te dejará indiferente. Dedicáte a explorarlo con calma, porque no hay ni una piedra colocada ahí por casualidad, cada paso que des tiene su objetivo (ya sea encontrar algún coleccionable, que los tiene a patadas) y cuando llegas al final todo cobra sentido.

Hay gente que se queja de que es corto, y es cierto que 35€ es algo caro, pero si lo compras en rebajas sí que compensa, sobre todo si te das el tiempo suficiente para saborearlo, en lugar de avanzar y avanzar lo más rápido posible.

Es cierto que en cuanto a optimización no es lo mejor del mundo, tiene zonas en las que hay tantísimos detalles que los fps tienen que luchar por mantenerse estables, pero si tienes un ordenador decente podrás jugarlo sin problema la mayor parte del tiempo.

The puzzles were mostly fun to solve, although most of them were not difficult, actually some were even very straightforward. However, the main purpose of Rime is to tell you a story, the puzzle solving business is totally secondary. And that story is very intriguing. I completed the game in just two long nightly sessions, so curious was I to see the story unfold. The backstory is unclear when you start to play the game. The game consists of 5 chapters with very different moods and atmospheres. As the names of the 5 chapters indicate, the game is about dealing with loss. But only in the final chapter the backstory of the boy is finally revealed.

Apart from the story, there is much to like about Rime. To me one of the main attractions of the game is the art and visual style of the game. Each world is very beautiful and well designed, with the exception of the various extensive underwater scenes (with the air bubbles) which appear to be a tribute to Super Mario Galaxy.

Mais um daqueles jogos que a princípio despertou interesse quase imediato e acabou sendo esquecido na prateleira por qualquer razão boba.
Eu tinha uma ideia do que seria o jogo, mas na verdade errei. Eu realmente esperava um jogo de puzzle e alguma historinha e o que eu vi foi sim um jogo com alguns puzzles, mas a ""historinha"" foi bem mais interessante e emocionante. Ele não é, dentre os jogos nesse estilo, meu favorito, mas ele ganhou um espaço na minha memória afetiva com certeza.
Um menino vagando entre cenários fantasiosos e incríveis, 3 locais bem distintos e uns mistérios a desvendar.
Aos altos e baixos então...
[h1]Bom:[/h1]
[list]
[*] A história. Comecei pela história porque pra mim é a melhor parte do jogo, mas calma... Não espere A história. O jogo não é focado numa narrativa como aventuras gráficas digamos assim, mas os mistérios envolvendo a figura da capa vermelha e a velejada serão os pontos altos sem dúvida.
Quem é a figura?
Do que se trata a velejada?
Quem é o animalzinho?
O que são esses lugares?

[*]A trilha sonora. Não é sempre que as trilhas se destacam ou que eu destaco as trilhas, mas aqui ela merece o elogio. É uma trilha bem específica, delicada e que funciona no jogo - depois você a esquece.

[*]O visual. Tem um estilo bem fantasioso e me remeteu a alguns animes antigos. Sem sombra de dúvidas, vai te segurar até o fim. Gosto dos momentos de grande contraste entre o preto / branco e uma cor destacada (lembrei de alguns filmes - exemplo Rumble Fish)

[*]Cenários. Cada local mais interessante que o outro e muito bem construídos. Quando você se perde, o próprio cenário e personagens te ajudam a reencontrar o caminho. São 3 principais e são bem criativas:
[h1]As ruínas da Raposa[/h1]
[h1]As ruínas do Pássaro[/h1]
[h1]As ruínas do Robô[/h1]

[*]A orientação. O jogo não te faz perder tempo tentando descobrir o que fazer. O foco é te mostrar pra onde ir e o que precisa ser feito, como você o fará é outra história - mas o cenário e personagens vão te orientar nesse sentido do ""caminho"". Não fosse isso tenho quase certeza de que o jogo teria o dobro do tempo, uma vez que em diversos momentos a iluminação é escura demais ou a câmera te zoa (explico nos pontos ruins). Toda ajuda será necessária.

[*]A raposa. Sem spoilers ou detalhes em excesso, eu ""gosti"" dela e foi a companheira perfeita.

[*]O desfecho. O final do jogo me encheu os olhos ------------- de água. Droga de indies que me fazem isso constantemente.
[/list]
[h1]Ruim:[/h1]
[list]
[*]A câmera. Avaliando o game no geral, ela não compromete. Entretanto a câmera é meio zoada em diversos momentos, inclusive te atrapalhando a entender o caminho em outros tantos.

[*]Partículas. 
Seu PC sangra?
VAI SANGRAR!

Cara... Talvez tenha sido porque escolhi a opção gráfico no ultra, mas ainda assim não justifica. Eu jogo o A.C. Odyssey no ultra e meu PC tem ""ram"" sobrando e posso, inclusive, deixar abas do chrome abertas de fundo. Aqui, o FPS cravado em 60 caía para ridículos UM......................... UM desgramado frame por segundo na sessão submersa do jogo. 
Quando você for pra sessão ""debaixo dágua"" dê um pulo no menu e ponha no médio ou low. 
Que?!?!
Tudo bem que eram poucos segundos, mas deixei um rolo de atadura e band-aids aqui do lado, minha placa uivou...

[*]O controle. A mecânica de movimentação não é muito boa. Não chega a ser uma aberração e talvez quando vocês jogarem nem entendam o porquê desta ""reclamação"", mas ela é apenas pontual - o jogo fica meio ""travado"" em alguns momentos e ""lento"" em outros. Talvez seja apenas eu ou minha preferência, mas não curti muito a movimentação.
[/list]

Rime é aquele jogo que fica ali na sua prateleira e você não leva muita fé. É aquele livro julgado pela capa, aquele filme que por não ser lançamento ou ter mais de 10 anos você sequer dá uma chance. Em números o [b][u]Rime[/u][/b] é um ótimo casual, com puzzles ok e de valor [h1] 8 [/h1]
Ele é muito bom, mas não chega a ser excelente. Acredito que pro meu gosto pessoal, uma orientação mais bem lapidada ou pelo menos mais intuitiva sem a necessidade das ""muletas"" que o  jogo oferece (talvez já pensando na sua desorientação?) faria a experiência melhorar.
Puzzles poderiam ser mais desafiadores inclusive, mas mesmo assim o jogo vale sem a menor sombra de desconfiança a sua atenção. Ele não é curto demais nem longo a ponto de te arrastar numa jornada cansativa (embora em alguns momentos, devido a ""velocidade"" da mecânica eu tenha me pegado pensando - por que não chego logo no fim?)

E aí? Compro no full ou na sale?
Compre no full se você quiser uma boa experiência com um indie incluindo cenários, puzzles e história e não tiver algo do gênero disponível.
Compre na sale se você possuir outros indies dentro da mesma proposta.
Seja como for, não se prive desta experiência - RIME é um jogo legal, cativante e bem curioso.",1548078090,1548078404,True,3,0,0.538709700107574463,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros: chill and very peaceful gameplay / decent story and graphics / semi-open world / good audio / ending has feels

Cons: game does not add anything new to the formula, gameplay-wise. What I have seen in this game I saw it all in other games. / Also nothing new or inovative in level design / Collectibles were placed in the game just for the sake of collecting. They does not alter the gameplay in any way. / Sometimes the game felt like a walking simulator / For the first three quarters of the game you just dont know whats up with the story. It only starts to make sense near the end (which is a shame, because it is actually good) / WAAY TOO EXPENSIVE for only 4-6 hours of gameplay (and for the quality of the game as well tbh). Only buy it during a sale!

Conclusion: RiME is building on the existing, good ol' formula, adding little-to-none new stuff. Decent game, and decent story but honestly nothing new. The big pro here is how peaceful the gameplay feels. 6.5/10

Oyunun ne kadar sıkıcı olduğundan, haritasının boşluğundan, keşfedilecek hiçbir şey olmadığından bahsedip duruyordu çoğu kişi. Meğer hepsi palavraymış…

İddia edilenin aksine oyunda toplanılabilecek beş farklı eşya türü var ve hepsini bulabilmek için bayağı çaba sarf etmeli, haritayı iyice keşfedip her deliğe girip çıkmalısınız. Açıkçası benim gibi keşfetmeyi çok seven bir oyuncu için çok güzel bir şey bu. Ek olarak oyunun bulmacaları ve hikâyesi de gerçekten ama gerçekten çok iyi. Özellikle sonu, neyin ne olduğunu anladığınız ve işin iç yüzünü kavradığınız an cidden başarılıydı. Öyle ki oyunu bitirdiğiniz zaman boynunuzdaki kırmızı fulardan tutun da takip ettiğiniz tilkiye kadar her şey anlam kazanıyor.

Oyunda hiç savaş olmamasından şikayet edenler de olmuş ama bu da tam olarak doğru sayılmaz. Evet, kılıç kalkan kuşanıp sağa sola saldıramıyoruz fakat ilerleyen bölümlerde yolumuzu tıkayan, hatta çok yakınlarından geçtiğimiz takdirde üzerimize saldıran gölge yaratıklarla karşılaşıyoruz. Onları yenebilmek için de çeşitli atraksiyonlara giriyoruz. Bir de kafayı bize takan koskocaman, yırtıcı bir kuş var tabii. Onunla da bir bölüm boyunca kovalamaca oynamak ve aklımızı kullanarak savaşmak zorundayız.

Oyunun başarımları da keyifli. Sırf bölümü geçtiniz diye değil, sahiden de bir şeyleri yapıp keşfettiğiniz için verilenler de var aralarında. Ki başarım dediğin de böyle olmalı zaten.

Tek şikayetim arada bir sapıtan ve duvarların, eşyaların içinden geçen kamera… Onun haricinde grafikleri ve sesleriyle (kayalara vuran dalgaların sesi beni benden aldı) iyi bir oyun RIME. Keşif ve bulmaca unsurlarını seviyorsanız, oyunlarda iyi hikâye anlatımına önem veriyorsanız harcadığınız vakte değen oyunlardan. 8/10

I don’t think I had to use my brain for the entire thing. The puzzles didn’t pose any challenge at all, and you’re literally led from one to the next, so it’s very linear. It’s short, so I finished it - but man was I bored for the entire game. It’s a good example of why you can’t just get artists and musicians to make a game without putting any thought in to the actual game design.

[b]Additional[/b]
Without spoilers, it’s a very pretentious game that takes you through 5 different stages, representing the after effects of an event that is slowly revealed at the end of each level. In that way, you might call it an example of games as an art form. I’d agree if it wasn’t so dull to play - I felt like the whole game was there to show off the artwork. It looks fantastic, but it just lacks and kind of depth or emotional engagement. I think that’s partly because it reveals so little of the story, but even after the first level I’d guessed what the game was about.

Luckily I got it in a Humble Bundle; I’d be really pissed off if I’d paid 36 euros for 4 hours of gameplay.

the story is nice, the gameplay feels smooth and polished, the mechanics are easy to understand but don't get boring, the stages are visually pleasing. This is the perfect way of presenting a exploration driven adventure game!

- It's not a fun, cute Zelda-like adventure filled with intelligent puzzles. 
- It's not a game with easy story telling, dialogue, or text. The story is very symbolic, doesn't really drive the gameplay, and is confusing even after ending the game.


So what do we have left? 

■■■ Gameplay ■■■
A very easy, third-person exploration game. Calling it a walking simulator would be too harsh, but the puzzles are really light, and there is not a whole lot to do other than that.
The controls are good enough. This game is more about the experience and story than pure gameplay fun. There is some stuff to collect and complete,
but i must be very honest about that it is not a lot of fun to do so. The game is level based, so you will have to replay a complete level again to collect missed stuff, which can take up to an hour. The total game is very short, around 5 hours, maybe 10 to 100% complete it.

■■■ Visual style & Graphics ■■■
This game has some VERY nice graphics and artwork, very bright and colorful. This was what initially got me interested in the game, it's just so vibrant and well-made. The world design also is awesome, the buildings and area's all are designed very well visually, this game just really has its own little style, and i really like it.

■■■ Music ■■■
This game has a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack, which adds a lot of atmosphere, but above all emotion to the game. Sometimes the music is very subtle to focus more on environmental sounds.

■■■ Story ■■■
Very hard to write about without spoiling. You will wake up, washed ashore on a mysterious island with a huge white tower. You will have to find things out yourself, and learn about the situation. The story is completely told through cutscenes, and some wall paintings, there is no dialogue or text to read. 

■■■ Technical & Bugs ■■■
No problems. Game ran fine on my GTX1060 3GB and i7. Enough graphics options.

Don't buy it for full price, it's not worth it for only 5 hours of gameplay. Though this game is a bit more than a walking simulator with a story, i do recommend it to peeps who like experiences like that.",1547259215,1555975068,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
It's an absolutely beautiful game. The art style is fantastic, and is executed perfectly across all aspects of RiME. Even more than the look of it, the music is incredible. It ranges from melodic and hopeful, to haunting and melancholy. The final two chapers are the ultimate showcase of this, as a combination of environmental choices along with music that makes you feel the anguish of the boy, are pulled off to perfection. The game shines with it's style, music, and subtle storytelling, and it's entirely why I recommend you play it.

The Not So Good:
The puzzles are fine, but they're not really anything special. That said, I knew I was coming in to this for the look and sound of it, and less so for the actual video game parts, so it's really not that big of a knock against it.

The only other thing that actually truly bothered me while playing, was some of the camera work. I don't usually feel motion sick playing games- I've got a Rift, and I can stay in that thing for hours- but for some reason, I found myself feeling kind of ill after certain sections of RiME. It's by no means a dealbreaker on an otherwise enjoyable experience, but it was an annoying problem that I've rarely experienced in any other game

BO riche et intense, graphismes léchés, histoire(s) prenante(s) et une facilité de prise en main, sans oublier des bonus toujours bienvenus. Une réussite qui rappellera quelques titres fameux (The Last Guardian, Journey, Aer etc.)
Évaluation : 17/20

Univers sonore : 5/5
> Il est effectivement possible de parler d'un univers sonore à part entière dans Rime : la bande sonore composée et interprétée par David García Díaz (https://music.greybox.com/releases) est fondamentale dans l'expérience vécue en jeu, soulignant les moments d'intensité lors de la partie tout en enveloppant à chaque instant les aventures vécues par le héros.
Digne d'OST cultes de films tels que Braveheart (composée par James Horner et interprétée par l'orchestre philharmonique de Londres) ou d'animés des Studio Ghibli (tels que Princesse Mononoké dont la musique a - comme souvent - été composée par Joe Hisaishi).

Graphisme : 4.5/5
> Un univers graphique chatoyant, très fourni, loin de l'hyper-réalisme et proche de la candeur d'un Zelda The Wind Waker et parfois des ambiances crépusculaires de Twilight Princess. Une belle expérience visuelle pleine d'évasion (non sans rappeler l'indépendant Aer : Memories of old), en accord avec le jeune âge du personnage mais aussi avec le mystère de la situation qui nous est ici dépeinte. Seuls quelques parasites, la frustration d'avoir l'impression de ne pas assez profiter du paysage et le contraste entre le premier et le dernier chapitre (très sombre, logique pour l'histoire, mais quelque peu décevant pour le plaisir de yeux) me semblent à regretter.

Histoire : 4/5
> Rime réussit la prouesse de nous conter une histoire à la fois belle, émouvante et complexe, et ce sans un mot ; quant aux sujets de l'attachement et du deuil, certes loin d'être abordés pour la première fois dans de ce type de productions vidéo-ludiques contemplatives (Journey, The Last Guardian etc.), ils sont traités avec poésie et finesse, et apparaissent sous un jour universel, prompt à toucher chacun par son propre vécu.
Les différentes interprétations possibles pourront toutefois parfois rendre perplexe le joueur, tout en sachant le garder en haleine jusqu'à la fin.

Gameplay : 3/5
> Très simple à prendre en main, peu de commandes, beaucoup d'aide du jeu : le gameplay de Rime est à la fois son atout pour le grand public et sa faiblesse par la facilité de ses énigmes et sa moyenne à faible durée de vie (compter 4 heures pour parvenir à la fin de l'histoire sans se précipiter, une dizaine pour débloquer l'ensemble des items et succès).
Par ailleurs, la redondance de tâches à accomplir rendent systématique la présence des composantes de l'architecture graphique du jeu (couloirs, portes, passerelles... Rien n'est jamais gratuit ni ""inutile"") et prive notre esprit de divaguer dans le paysage, dommage.

Le tenía ganas desde que salió y hoy lo terminé.
Linda historia que no necesita ni siquiera de texto.
Gráficos muy lindos.
Puzzles sencillos aunque alguno puede trabarte pero no por difícil, sino porque no te das cuenta de lo que hay que hacer.
El personaje en algunos momentos (sobre todo cuando trepa) se mueve para donde se le antoja y es medio exasperante.
La optimización es bastante mala, siendo que vi gente que teniendo excelentes PC Master Race, les andaba medio trabado.
Resumiendo..:
Una joyita Indie que tenés que Jugar pero con algunos problemas de rendimiento y jugabilidad.

Running, Jumping, Climbing, swimming, diving, pushing, pulling, rolling.

And the story is great, don't get me wrong.
But you know what ruins the experience for me?
The atrocious gameplay following Act 2. 

FOLLOWING THIS POINT, THE REST OF THE REVIEW IS SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

So Act 1 starts off at a slow pace, easing you into the basic elements of gameplay. You don't feel any sort of rush to complete the main objective right away so you're more likely to explore (which is good as you will ABSOLUTELY need to do that in later levels just to finish the main objective). One element never gets used again (feeding the boars fruit) which is seriously dissapointing to me.

Act 2 was INTENSE and I LOVED IT. I had all these good vibes going in and then the tone shift comes when a real enemy was introduced being the Bird(?) and the Phantoms. Now the thing with the bird is that I was expecting it to be the main antagonist for the whole game - not just one act. What I was expecting was finding out that this boy's tribe was responsible for destroying its home and the bird, in a continuous fit of anger, would attack their village. In order to appease it, they would offer a sacrifice - the boy - but something goes wrong. The boy survives and the bird is FURIOUS. He's now actively seeking out his meal and you must help this boy kill the bird and get to safety.
This is what I THOUGHT. But what I GOT was... well, like I said, it would've been good had the gameplay not ruined it.
The only other comment I have for Act 2 is the realization that the Phantoms were afraid of me. I thought that was an amazing discovery. This entire time, I had been going out of my way to avoid them, scared of them myself, and these things are just as afraid of me? That was AWESOME. You're meant to be playing from the perspective of a boy adrift in a strange land, you have no idea what's going on and you're just trying your best to survive. Then these bizarre creatures show up on what you can only presume is their territory and THEY are afraid of YOU? 

Act 3: 
Well, I wish the last point would've standed because even after you managed to kill the largest creature in the immediate area, those phantoms make a complete 180 and COME for you. Personally, I think this should've been switched. They should've started off aggressive and THEN gone to fear. Part of my frustration with this act is having to take a guess at whether or not this phantom is only acting as a barrier or if they're actually aggressive. The other part is not having a god damn clue what I was doing. Apparently I'm not the only one because one of the most watched Walkthroughs spends a good 5-10 min on puzzle just walking around, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Half of my time was spent going "" WELL HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT "" and grinding my teeth in anger. This is BAD for many reasons but the largest one is that it takes you out of the running story that's going on. Like when you see these giant Cores which look like the Steam Punk version of cores found in Portal just lying there dead, I get the impression I'm SUPPOSED to care. I'm SUPPOSED to care when the 1st one you revive suddenly collapses. I'm SUPPOSED to care when the 2nd one sees its fallen brother and wails. 
But did I?
No. 
Because by the time I got to the end of the level, I was too pissed off to care. This same problem dominates through the rest of the game which is awful when you're trying to tell an emotional story like this. There was also this one part where there was this wall that looked like it had a golden ladder.
Couldn't climb it.
Massively infuriating.
You can climb vines, pillars with golden rungs, and rock walls with a small jut but you can't climb something that looks like a ladder?

Act 4:
Idk if this is meant to split up into 2 acts after the boy turns into a ghost but I'm counting it as one so you're gonna have to deal with it.
I was still pretty raw from anger coming into this and thought that this might be the Act I settle down but I was INSTANTLY enraged when I saw the robots were carrying the kid.
Why?
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO USEFUL IN THE LAST DAMN CHAPTER, THAT'S WHY.
You gotta think before you do shit like this because I spent the majority of Act 3 glaring at this robot thinking "" Why can't I just hold onto your leg or something and pilot you? ""
Anyhow, the rest of the level was fine until midway through. One of the totems I needed to activate had the most infuriating platform sequences since the cliff I needed to grab was at a weird angle. The character is easy enough to control with just about any situation EXCEPT diagonal jumping. I had to make 5 attempts before making what should have been a relatively easy jump.
The final thing that ticked me right off was when the kid becomes a ghost.
DO. NOT. MAKE. YOUR. CHARACTER. THE. SAME. COLOR. AS. THE. PLATFORMS. OH. MY. GOD.
That was an AWFUL design choice. It's not pleasing to look at and it makes controller the character harder. 

4/10. This game could be so much better if it didn't try too much at once and cleaned things up a bit. I would rate this lower but it's still really beautiful and the music is composed+implemented very well.",1546697498,1546697512,False,3,0,0.47217366099357605,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Which is bad. And they all do... nothing, really. Emblems mean nothing. Lullabies mean nothing. Toys and Keyholes have tiiiiny rewards but nooot really. Outfits are the only tangible reward and they're only aesthetic at best. And the way some stuff is hidden is... questionable. Go through a specific set of doors? Uhh. Climb a tower you already climbed but with no indication you need to climb it again? Why. 

The problem you face whether or not you go for completion is that this game is self-indulgent to the point of arrogance and thus looooves wasting your time. Be prepared for: 1. Slooow cutscenes. 2.

Yeah, the game does look good. But not -that- good. Not so good you need to constantly shove it in my face. The music's also a tad generic but constantly seems to believe it's meaningful and deep.

[H1]When I first saw this game the thought was, ""I will Probably get this when they iron the bugs out.""
The bugs are ironed out.
This game surprised me for several reasons, and I'll break it down for you.[/H1]

[H1]Gameplay:[/H1]
[H1]As simple as this game appeared when I first finally got my hands on it, It Quickly let me know this is a game of Skill and thought. You are in character like Tomb Raider. You jump from ledges and hurdle across casms and climb VERY high. I say this because I have a fear of heights. My games that terrifed me; were like Dying Lights First encounter with the Crane off the roof. I nearly hurled. After you get used to it its alright, and this game delivers that sense of height and risk.

The controls are very tight.
 
I am a WASD player, casual gamer. The controls having sensitivity is crucial because the game will kill you for jumping. Falling works in the game, and there IS gravity.

I found the situations and scenery made the game play all the more fun. As you go, youre able to collect things, There are shells, pieces of images, pictures keyholes, and some other things I cant remember. This game was LUSHLY populated with Lovely, and harsh landscapes.[/H1]

[H1]Look and feel:[/H1]
[H1]I loved the simple beauty of the character, there was a childlike innnocence you saw. The enviroments were Lush. I loved how things interact with you. In a sandbox Open-world, I can go anywhere,  this game was fairly forgiving and allowed me to get out of jams, unlike some games do. The walls and rocks arent Traps like Other games, in other words.

I played this game for 3 days on a off. I tried to play to a stopping place and save. The game saves but its Usually where you started from, the last time you played. That Isnt a big deal because I saw how I needed to go sometimes when I was lost. Starting again helped me get my bearings.

The Puzzles are Great and varied. There are so many I couldnt count, but you were always involved. It was my Favorite part of this game.

Parker moves and jumping happens also.[/H1]

[H1]Likes:[/H1] 

[H1]The look wasnt so polished you were awestruck at every scene, but the graphics were (in Ultra) Beautiful. Physics are real and consisistent, as are response from controls.
The cut-scenes are a treat, and happen so infrequently its a great break in the action. It slows the play down too. Thats a deal because I found myself wanting to run through the game. I sort of Did, but in a thoughtful manner, trying to find stuff and get achievments.[/H1]

[H1]Dislikes:[/H1]

[H1]This game is Stingy with achievments if youre a collector of stuff. The artifacts to find, go from difficullt, to stupidly simple.
Not the strongest part of the game IMHO to complete. This requires a guide to find everthing.

At times I found my self having issues with what was being asked of me or where I was going (because I have a tendancy to wander in open world games like this, and I was lost a few times. Luckily the Devs had a Clue, and made it so if you save; it will allow you to return to the start of your mission. 

You have a traveling companion, a Fox. It willl lead you where you need to go. I had to pay attention to that, because its Really handy Not to get lost.
Im not a completionist.[/H1]

[H1]Final thoughts:[/H1]

[H1]I like to start at a place where everyone can agree, 'would you play this game again?'
I have to say, 'Yes'.
Im a sucker for games that allow me to run around everywhere and do mostly anything.
I liked the Puzzles in this game!! I like puzzles, but this game had great Logical puzzles, and it made sense when you finished them. Plus: You feel smarter.[/H1]

[H1]8/10 Beauty, because the graphics werent SO polished, but still lovely.
      9/10 Game play: It Was fun!
      10/10 Immersion, because at the end[spoiler]I cried[/spoiler][/H1]

Rime hat mich vom ersten Augenblick an emotional berührt, in seinen Bann gezogen und in seine verzaubernde Welt mitgenommen, ohne dass ich vorher wusste, was mich da denn jetzt nun wirklich ganz genau erwarten wird. Das schaffen nicht alle Spiele und Rime hat es dazu auch noch auf eine Art und Weise geschafft, die ich so bis jetzt noch nicht kannte.

The first hour of this game is like dating a hot psycho sure shes great to you in the begining but slowly but surely her insanity starts to show. Rimes concept of an exploration game with epic puzzles is a great idea and you will feel like thats what your getting in the begining which sadly is as far as most people get with there games as seen with low achivement rates.

But sadly this game is full of frustrating flaws and outright incompetance at the hands of the designer and even the artists which is very poor by todays standards. This game is overall a simple design for the unreal engine which was speically built to make these kind of single player games great unlike PUBG etc but boy does it have problems. 

Firstly this game has one of the worst camera clipping issues I have seen that causes the camera to jarringly go through walls often stunning the player with black or worse whatever randomness is behind the games walls. Its like being blinded everytime as if a deer just dove out in front of your car, truly awful programing. Plently of unreal engine games dont have any issue with the camera like this its something you dont even think about in Tomb Raider for example. 

Tomb raider is a good thing to compare alot of things in this game as despite its faults its fundemntals are solid when compared to Rimes poor effort. Alot of the climbing in this game is based on bird shit on ledges signalling you can climb it but due to the artistic lighting you often can not see it. Now i don't wear glasses but if you do dont even finish the review just dont bother with the game youre going to rage often trying to figure out what youre missing when you can see the slight change in color that was vital to you progressing forward. The lighting in general makes the game such an awful experince espically the areas that are dark and due to the high washed out light in the day you cant fix it with brightness changes unless you plan to turn it up and down everytime you in an area which somethings if your moving like underwater for example its too risky to do so.

The parkour in general in this game is often terrible when compared to Tomb raider or Assasins creed and thers a distinct lack of smoothness to the animations and controls which make navigating the world a chore. The little boys animations are so janky and stilted as if he has brittle bones, it feels like every button press has animation delay which makes timing what you want to do bad. I died a few times jumping off a cliff when I wasnt intending to do what the game produced. The game is also very inconsistent with what is possible, yes I know you could make that jump back then but you can't here ... or can you its never clear whats possible or if your doing it wrong. I really wish they had implemtned the fox guide more to aliveate this.

The boy chacters design starts to anoy after you spend enough time with him as hes just so odd looking imagine a white kid with black face thats strangely what he looks like. The dumb thing to me is why there wasnt a character creation tool in this game as the story is so loose that being a girl or a boy of whatever race would have not effected the plot. Being able to create you as a child would have added a lot of depth to the game and made it more meaningful because after a while youll be flinging him off cliffs just to see whats possible without a care in the world, meaning you dont care for his saftey and therefore his journey. 

The puzzles arent really that speical, there often beautiful in there architetureal design and art which is one of the games big draws but there's nothing hear thats better than the Breath of the Wild mini puzzles. Im not the biggest fan of Tomb raider or Uncharted but I can promise you they both have far better puzzles. One that particular pissed me off was one of the gold door ones that asks the player to know how to do something thats impossible within the games logic until you learn of it. Soon as you know its possible the puzzle is easy if you don't you'll feel like you dont even have a clue as to not only what to do but if your even in the right place, its that fucking awful. 1 of the worse puzzles I've seen made, thats similar to telling the player I know you have 2 hands but you should have used the invisble 3rd hand we gave you but didnt tell you.

Another thing mentioned by reviewer Jim Sterling really hit home the more i played the game and thats the problem of having collectables which are an issue for several reasons in this specific game. Firstly they are mostly apart from the story ones worthless and unrewarding items that make you feel like that was pointless for my time investment. Theyre kind of a nod towards those that explore a little more than others whilst doing the main ones but it just makes you feel like checking every nook for the sake of it not because you want to. Thats bad because exploration is what makes this game feel unique and special yet often youre exploration is not rewarded because instead of something like a beautiful hidden waterfall with unique life, you find a worthless charm thats more like an emoticon than anything else. The game really needed more animal life and a way for the boy to interact with it in an enjoyable way like petting it for example. 

The music is nice but kind of forgettable you want really be hearing it in your head later on but its not anoying unlike many of the sound effects from the shouting boy to the segul to the hellish bird boss scream. I turned the sound down more and more that I pushed through the game, shame.

The game runs very poorly on my powerful computer for a game this simple and it feels very poorly optomised. This is really bad given you kinda need the graphics on high to see things clearly due to the previously mentioned problems with the game. Even though the game looks simple enough if you have a low end system really do not bother with this game its going to be troublesome for you. I also hate the lack of being able to save when you want its really jarring when you have to come back to the game as your not where youd like to pause your journey. The options menu is very poor by Total Biscuits standards and pc buffs are not going to be impressed by whats here.

Overall this game is not worth the high price for a short indie game and even at sale due to its painfully frustrating elements I can not recomend you spend your time with this game. The sad part about this game is that if they had a team of testers or went early access that would have spotted all these obvious issues with the game and lead to them being fixed. A lot of what this game does has been done before but better and its a real shame the game designers didnt study hard enough to learn about the importance of customer feedback in design. Their lack of expertise has turned what could have been a great title into a bad one and how sad it is that all the hard work they put into this game is wasted.

Claramente narra la vida de un niño gaditano que se despierta en la playa después de 16 horas de siesta al sol y se pega un fin de semana de paseo por los pueblos del interior de la costa andaluza. ¿Qué de donde me saco esto? Pues pongo algunos ejemplos:

En un inicio llegamos a Mojacar, donde encontramos todas esas calles y casas blancas revestidas de cal (ya sabéis, para estar fresquitos en verano), visitamos también la playa de Punta Paloma, con sus aguas cristalinas y su maravillosa orilla en la que buscar fardos y, más tarde, nos adentramos en terrenos montañosos, concretamente en Málaga, donde casi al final del juego puedes encontrar el caminito del rey.

Es cierto eso de que es muy importante la voz del protagonista. Y es que en tu viaje deberás aprender a cantar soleás, tímidamente empezarás con suaves “mmmh” que avanzarán directamente a gritos porque no terminas bien de pillar el compás, y claro, eso te descarta automáticamente como cantante pero te vale para el jaleo.

Otra referencia clara es cuando, en un momento del juego en el que todo está oscuro, se te aparece la virgen de la macarena para darte fuerza cristiana, pero al verte se raya y desaparece porque sabe que no estás bautizao.

El zorro ese que no hace más que ronearte es en realidad el chivato del dealer del barrio. Uno que va con un poncho rojo y que está en todos los rincones del juego porque cambia continuamente de lugar no vaya a ser que los verdes le desmonten el tinglao.

Y bueno aún me queda juego por delante así que si veo más referencias iré actualizando esto. Gracias Tequila Works por llevar el folclore mediterráneo allende de nuestras fronteras. Moláis.

The game is beautifull, and I mean it. One of the best looking, atmospheric, games out there. It's just astonishing. The story is also great, and well told. Music score kicks ass and so on. 10/10 if it comes to the tech / goodies.

Now, the game itself... It's not a puzzle game. There are like 5 puzzles where you have to think (a bit), and the rest is just tedious moving things around. No thinking involved at all. 

It's more WALKING SIMULATOR, rather than puzzle game. 
Quite wonderful walking simulator, but still - not a puzzle game. 
You walk, you jump, you walk and jump. No gameplay at all. Just tedious moving around the levels.

But then, once you turn the blind eye on the fact it's gameplay kind of sucks, and just realise it's a walking simulator, you'll spend couple of great hours discovering all the beauty  and heart, developers put into this title.

Genre: 3D platforming 

The Good:
+ An incredibly well-crafted game, exploring the environments with some light platforming and puzzle solving in the mix.  Exploring the environment carefully usually rewards you with some sort of collectable.

+ Variety of environments between the 5 chapters

+ There is a ‘silent’ story, no dialogue, and things start to make more sense as you play the game. Again, it fits nicely with the narrative of the game and doesn’t get in the way, allowing you to explore and enjoy the game. 

+ Fantastic soundtrack 
 
The Average:
+/- The puzzle fit nicely with the overall theme of the game but felt a bit too easy especially in the later half of the game since the puzzles don’t evolve very much. 

+/- The game will take around 5-10 hours depending on how thorough you explore each area.

The Bad:
- Framerates were not stable at all, fluctuating between 30-60fps. 

Conclusion:
The closest thing we will get to ICO on steam. Although I wouldn’t call this game a masterpiece, it does do a good job of filling that void though and those looking for a more relaxing, casual experience will definitely appreciate what this game has to offer.

Puzzles are just .. bad.. They don't have any real cleverness to any of them, at least for the player. It's all trial and error. The game just wants to show off its artistry at every point, which I admit is top notch and the game is absolutely beautiful. But with some clunky controls and poor puzzles, this is definitely a thumb down for me. Also has optimization issues. Stutters sometimes in some areas even on a Vega 64.

The game clearly takes inspiration from third person action adventure games like the classic Prince of Persia / Tomb Raider /God of War / Darksiders. Except, they have meaning to exploration, have great puzzles, much better level design, and good combat as well. Granted this is a chill-out and relax game,  but it fails even in that department because some of the puzzles are just annoying -they don't really require much use of your brain, but just trial and error.. If the puzzles were actually clever, like what you see in Talos Principle or Portal, I would've absolutely recommended this game. But, they're just mind numbingly boring to solve.. If you've played Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, you'd know what I'm talking about. In Rime, puzzles are basically align an object with another,  rotate a ball till you hit the right spot, adjust an object so the shadows fall in the right places, so on and so forth. Sure, these puzzles show off a great lighting system and the developer's artistry skills, but as puzzles, they are barebones, yet frustrating at times, and it simply ruins it from being a good walking simulator as well.

This game has you pushing the Left analog stick on your controller forward (or pressing and holding W) for 80% of the game. It is a small open world, but your hand is still held by your pet which guides you to your objective. 

There is immense beauty on first look, but without any real content or meaning to it, it's nothing but a pretty empty shell that fails to keep me hooked.. There is no real story until the epilogue of the game, but by that time, I was already frustrated with the game that I truly didn't care..

The game is emersive and tells an interesting story without the need for narration. Although RiME has some issues, it is certianly a game that I enjoyed and would recommend to people who love going on a story-telling journey.

[h1] Puzzles [/h1] 
This game is more of an art piece. The puzzles aren't meant to be challenging, but are meant to take you through the environment you're in. There are different puzzle mechanics that get introduced throughout the game that keeps the game interesting without making the introduction of he new mechanics abrupt.

[h1] Exploration [/h1]
Although RiME may seem linear, the player still has the option to explore their surroundings, often finding secrets or collectables; which can provide some lore (but it's totally optional and you don't need to collect them). The game isn't fully open world as you cannot explore places that are in different chapters from the one the player is in.

[h1] Music and Visuals [/h1]
The music in this game was breathtaking and the visuals were superb. The music for each setting really added to the atmosphere of the game; making you feel wonder at some times and fear at others. The art style is fitting for the story the game is telling and the visuals look really good in game. Giant structures would be imposing and the creatures within the game looked rather cute.

[h1] Story [/h1]
You uncover the story about the boy and the island as you progress through the game. Telling the story through the environment and symbolism rather than narration is, although not a new concept, very effective in RiME. The story is left up to interpretation by the player which makes it all the more interesting. As I was playing, I felt as though the story was pulling me in; I wanted to know more about where it was going which lead me to progressing throughout the entire game.
*In my opinion, the first 30 minutes of the game was to get the player used to the types of puzzles and mechanics that would be seen throughout the game. The story in this part of the game is not very apparent. However, RiME becomes much more interesting past this part and has good pace throughout the rest of the game*

[h1] Controls and Mechanics [/h1]
The controls are reletively simple, and the game would often prompt you as to what button you need to press to do something (e.g interact, throw, s c r e a m).  The player mechanics are just your average jump, drop, climb and scream. These mechanics can be a little janky though, at times I would be jumping to a climbable plank above me and I would fall instead of grabbing on. Climbable wouldn't be climbable past a certian point, which required me to get off and get back on again. The animation when jumping up a small ledge was a little awkward too, the boy would just look like he was sliding towards the ledge. You would also have to wait for a previous animation to end before screaming at something as well. Overall, platforming wasn't too difficult, it's just sometimes these awkward mishaps can be a litle annoying. 

[h1] Performance [/h1]
I would often drop frames in some areas for no particular reason and the game crashed twice in the 4.5 hours of playing even with the recommended specs.

[h1] Pricing [/h1]
I do understand that this is an indie game however $40 is pretty expensive for what you get out of the 5 hour game. I recommend buying RiME while on it's on sale (I got it for $20)

[h1] Conclusion and Recommendation [/h1]
In conclusion, RiME does have a couple of issues but overall it is an amazing experience and remains emersive throughout. The visuals and music help create the environment and atmosphere the player is in and it tells an interesting story. I don't think RiME is for everyone though, I recommend it to people who appreciate games that are there to take you on a journey and allow you to experience a story (or people who have free time and money to spend).",1544463320,1544522726,True,5,0,0.590163946151733398,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I mention Journey because it was the first game like this that I got to experience first-hand. It is still one of my favorites, but I gotta say Rime grabbed my heart and squeezed more than Journey ever managed to do. 

I expected a quiet, beautiful puzzle game, which it ultimately was. But the emotional journey I went on was neither quiet nor beautiful considering I sat through the last minutes of the game as well as the end credits bawling my eyes out and slobbering all over my keyboard. I cry all the time, but you know something messed you up real bad when your nose clogs up and the tears mix with your snot (TMI I know). 

The level design was fantastic, both in the way the world was built and the puzzles. The game used subtle visual, auricular and narrative queues to guide you and every feature immersed you in the experience. It used a lot of classic concepts that, as a gamer, you are very familiar with, but in a way that made them feel unique and interesting. I loved all the shaders and VFX. The feature that allowed you to sing and hum and cower and cry depending on your surroundings was absolutely fantastic. When I got to the dark room where you lit a path by singing, the subtle melody of the boy's voice instantly brought tears to my eyes and it continued to do so throughout the game. The music and soundeffects took the game to a completely different level.

I was constantly amazed by the beauty of each area, my favorite being the [spoiler] beginning of Bargaining, the swampy area. I especially enjoyed the part where you walk through one door and without walking up any stairs arrive at another floor, and when you take the same route again end up somewhere completely different. And the part where you walk and walk but never get anywhere (although it was a little buggy). It felt like the game was playing with you. 

The whole five stages of grief thing was fantastic and you could see signs of each stage in everything about each level. The mood, the progression, the way you interacted with the world, the way the boy acted etc etc. The symbolism was brilliant in both the holistic experience and in the little details. And in the end when you finally realized the truth it hit you like a bag of bricks. /[/spoiler]

I bought this game during Black friday which means it was heavily discounted, but for everyone that missed that I would 100% buy this game for the full price. I didn't go out of my way to get any of the collectibles but it still took me 12+ hours to get to the end. This game will touch you in a way that feels personal and intimate, and that is a very rare and precious thing. I highly recommend it.

One of the first things I asked myself while playing was how this game hadn't even been nominated for best score during the 2017 game awards. The orchestral accompaniment carried the mood of the scene throughout the game, and, together with the character design of the wondrous protagonist, created a Ghibliesque experience.
There are many positive things to touch on, from the adaptive use of the action button ([spoiler]either shouting to activate something, or expressing the protagonist's mood when no objects are in range[/spoiler]), to the complex relationships with NPCs ([spoiler]e.g. the shades fearing the boy, then attacking, and later accepting him[/spoiler]), but the dev's biggest accomplishment is the story.

RiME is a masterpiece of a story driven game that will rock you at your core upon uncovering the secrets.This game has left me with an emotional state but learned lessons as well from it.

I strongly recommend it for [I]people like me[/I], realizing fully that others might find it boring and confusing.

The gameplay is generally linear but gives you as much time as you'd like to explore each level. There are environmental puzzles: not too challenging and yet still satisfyingly composed. And yet the puzzles are more like focal points for your attention, small moments along a grand path. The true core of the gameplay is exploration.

Exploration is rewarding. The levels are beautifully designed, and there are nooks and crannies from which you can peek at familiar vistas from new angles. Many people who dislike the gameplay still admit that it's visually breathtaking. And there are small secrets (collectibles) to be found for meaningful achievements. (You can return and collect all of them after you've finished the game, so don't fret.)

The unspoken narrative is more of a loose poem than tight prose, even though it does coalesce in the end. You can assemble meanings and feelings yourself or read that interview with Raúl Rubio Munárriz in which he explains the basic intent. But he was just one person on the dev team, and there are many layers. Good art can evoke many perspectives.

Some have reviewed this game as being boring and tritely sentimental. I can't argue against taste, but it seems that I value the things they find unimportant. Some say  a pale imitation of [I]Ico[/I], a game that likely inspired it. Well, I recently played [I]Ico[/I] on the PlayStation 2, and RiME is a vast improvement. It has more imaginative and diverse levels, more satisfying puzzles, and a more creative story. It's funny how nostalgia makes old games seem better than they are.

Finally, some criticism. What I can say is that [I]Ico[/I] achieved a lot with very little, and sometimes [I]RiME[/I] can seem too lush and crammed with ideas. It's a nice long game, but perhaps it would have been more poignant if it were more compact, the themes drawn together a bit more starkly.

And as many have pointed out, the game has technical difficulties. Frame rates are not great even on high-end hardware. You can overcome stuttering by reducing the graphics quality and even the resolution. The game will still be beautiful, trust me.

I will be reviewing the game in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.

Pro:
     The graphics are beautiful. The game has a simplistic style that looks similar to journey, a cartoon like fantasy design for both worlds and characters. It kinda looks like zelda in a way.

     Gameplay is very nice. It is a platformer just like journey on PSN. There are a few puzzles that are not too hard but does compliment platforming parts quite often.

     Music is magic. Again you can not expect anything but the best emotional music from a game that is similar to journey. The music is used to protray mood of the characters or to add a layer of depth in the world with the ambient audio. The sound effects are pretty one point too.

     Story is super. The story is told through both cutscene and music. The game goes the path of show not tell which leads to quite a theatrical experience where your not being told how to feel or whats going on. The story is told with 0 dialogue and like ive been saying a thousand times, just like journey. There is more emotional impact that a player feels with the show not tell tactic in games.

Conclusion:
     Fime is a super game, you can see a good emotional story experience. Just like journey on PSN the game is an emotional rollercoaster and is worth playing from start to finish. Each stage in the game is unique and the music compliments both the world and the emotional impact of the game.

That said, I will say that some of them are interesting mechanically and could be made into fun puzzles if they had more of a challenge.  I think the story in RiME could have been pushed a little more, as I basically didn't pick up on any of it until I talked the game over with a friend, and he didn't even get it until he looked stuff up online.

The whole premise is really simple: your playable character is a kid who find himself cast away on a seemingly deserted island filled with the ruins of a civilization long gone. He must proceed to navigate the (at times) dangerous new environment with the help of a magical fox companion in order to find a way to escape.

It's pretty clear that the developers took a lot of gameplay and atmosphere clues from the Team ICO games. Putting aside the premise itself and the design of pretty much everyone and everything, the gameplay is all about leading your young protagonist throught the various, breath-taking areas and solve some puzzles or otherwise manipulate the environment in order to escape danger or to advance.

While RiME doesn't reach the unforgettable status of its inspiration, the result is still a really enjoyable experience. The gameplay is simple yet enjoyable and the controls, especially during the purest platforming sequences, are comfortable, at the very least most of the time. The puzzles you are presented along the journey aren't especially hard, but they are varied and entertaining enough in their own right. The atmosphere, the characters and the minimalist, cartoony art style are most definitely endearing and make go throught the game a very enjoyable and relaxing experience. It also helps that the areas after the first one, the Island proper, are varied enough and each feature its own theme and elements. The soundtrack also enhances the mood perfectly.

RiME's major drawback is most definitely its kinda short lenght: an average player will be able to complete it in under five hours or so.

I thought about dropping a bad review, but that would not be fair. I finished RiME in round about 8 hours. And I loved it for seven of those. 

It all starts with a young boy waking up at the beach of a mysterious, foreign land. There are no other people, but old, ancient ruins. So we have our lad run about Tomb Raider style, jumping, climbing, swimming, diving, solving puzzles and riddles, trying to find out where we are.

This journey is a most beautiful one. The graphic style is simple, but colorful and very well made. It reminds of The Witness and Firewatch. Not one word is spoken throughout the game, the whole story is being told through pictures. Lovely nature sounds and an orchestral sound track wonderfully add to the atmosphere.

What seriously spoiled the game for me was the ending. I can not go too deep into detail, but I believe it's safe to say that at the end, nothing of the bright happiness is left. Watch the trailers on Steam. They show how the game begins. The ending will be the total opposite. The trailers make RiME appear as the perfect puzzle game for the entire family, your kids included, and YES for the very most part it actually is! The puzzles are not really challenging, the world, the young boy, the little fox, everything is super cute and there will be a lot of bright smiles while you play. Just if you let your kids play RiME, pray that they never make it to the end.  Or have paper tissues ready. 

This is not what I expected from reading the game description or watching the trailers and I feel a bit betrayed. I believe finishing a game should leave you satisfied. Yes, some games have sad endings, some games have a dark theme too so that you are prepared for what there is to come. And even sad endings can be positive in a way.  But RiME just left me sad and empty. I hoped that after the credits there would be something, a hint, a picture, anything that would make me feel better, but there was nothing. Yes. yes. I do understand the message behind the story. But I believe RiME was not the right game for such messages.

So I still recommend playing RiME for all the beauty that is has...but if you hate sad endings, skip this one.",1543439136,1543439136,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I've finished the game, and I still recommend it! Very replayable to explore more, as there are many secrets on the island. The storyline is great - I'm glad I avoided spoilers.

(Review in progress)

Didn't really expect much going in - had seen a little bit of @Monukai streaming this game and that's it.

Environmental exploration with lots of secrets. I kept noticing areas that seem like you could get to, but weren't linear for the story progression. Sometimes there's achievements for figuring it out!

Wasn't sure about the art style at first, but it really grew on me.

Cute collectibles that are in theme.

The main chapters are getting more and more serious, in the sense that it feels like I will discover some sort of lost civilization. The level designers made it a joy to explore.

There is a lot to said about its amazing scenery and mysterious atmosphere.  However, the game falls short in player mechanics; particularly in its platforming.  

In many 3D games, the camera view is located behind the player, so controller movements align with character movements.  This alignment is important when navigating difficult environments such as a narrow bridge.  Sometimes a game will shift the camera view to better show off the scenery.  This view change can make platforming excruciatingly difficult when making jumps or walking across narrow paths.  Many games solve this problem by either locking movement controls to the character or making it impossible to fall off and fail.  

Rime has many narrow platforms and bridges where the camera shifts to an angled position rather than behind the character.  The camera sift causes most players to propel themselves off the bridge and to their deaths.  Furthermore, the save point is located behind the bridge, allowing the player to fail over and over.  Rime consistently changes the camera to an angled position, making it very difficult to platform.  

The second issue is running jumps.  Thirty minutes into the game, my character got stuck; unable to go forward or back.  I was in an area where I had to align three giant blue spheres.  To progress I had to make a running jump and hold onto a small ledge.  I failed the jump and fell onto the previous section.

[list]
    [*][b]Referencias:[/b] 
El juego bebe muchísimo de dos juegos, que son los del Team ICO y Journey. Ahora bien, con esto no me refiero a que una lo mejor de los dos, si no que simplemente se dedica a [i]tomar prestados[/i] ciertos elementos para un uso mayoritariamente estético. De journey toma cosas como el hecho de haber varios personajes con capa en el que es la propia capa el elemento distinguible y el hecho de mostrarte repetidas veces el lugar que debes alcanzar (la torre en este caso, lo que sería la montaña de Journey). Esto podrían ser un par de detalles tontos, pero con los del team ICO es directamente un despiporre: el protagonista lleva una especie de capa, el juego transcurre en unas ruinas en islas rodeadas de agua, las playas, hay varios puentes laaaaaargos y estrechos, los molinos (no había suficiente con uno y por eso han metido tres), los enemigos son sombras, [spoiler] en la canción hablan de un chico de luz, que al final muere y se torna todo oscuro, como una sombra (¿Yorda, estás ahí?)[/spoiler], el prota es un ser indefenso, en ocasiones vas acompañado de otro personaje controlado por la IA que va abriendo puertas y con el que intentan que te encariñes... de verdad creo que se han pasado, especialmente cuando, como digo, la mayorá son cuestiones estéticas, ni el juego va de lo mismo y ni mucho menos consigue lo mismo.

    [*][b]El juego en sí:[/b] 
Ahora sí que sí, vamos a lo más importante. El resumen es que el juego está bien. Empieza bien, luego afloja un poco y el final está bastante cuidado, así que deja buen sabor de boca. Jugablemente es una mezcla de walking simulator con algún objetivo (estilo Journey), mezclado con aventura ligera como ICO (con puzzles que están bien, te puedes atascar en alguno incluso) y cierto plataformeo guionizado como podría ser el de Uncharted o los nuevos Tomb Raider (sí, con color distintivo en las cornisas agarrables, exactamente igual). En cuanto al aspecto gráfico de los escenarios, el juego cumple de sobra: es bonito, resultón y creíble. Además, el hecho de ofrecer un ambiente mediterráneo, relativamente infrecuente en este medio audiovisual, me parece un punto muy a remarcar. Como detalles mejorables, los personajes me parecen feos con ganas (en cuanto a estilo), demasiado sencillos (en referencia a lo puramente técnico) y algunas de las animaciones dignas de un estudio indie de garaje (no todas, ojo, pero se podría pulir bastante este tema). Y para acabar pero no menos importante, la banda sonora me ha gustado bastante. Menos en un par de ocasiones, es de tipo ambiental, no pretende que recuerdes las melodías ni que las vayas tatareando en el metro durante la semana siguiente, pero refuerzan contundentemente lo que se ve en pantalla. Y punto positivo a que el tema principal esté cantado en castellano, ¡hay que reivindicar el producto patrio, que no vamos sobrados!

Compré este juego porque quería disfrutar de una aventura para un solo jugador, en la cual perderme y olvidarme de todo, solo avanzar y dejarme llevar, y eso fue lo que encontré, un grandísimo juego, es MUCHÍSIMO mejor de lo que esperaba.
Tiene muchos coleccionables por encontrar, que te van contando parte de la historia. Me faltaron muchos por encontrar, y aún así duró bastante.
Los coleccionables que hay por descubrir, así como los paisajes espectaculares, hacen que quieras perderte en esa inmensdidad que se nos presenta.
Si estás con dudas al momento de comprarlo, sin duda te lo recomiendo al 100%
Tiene problemas grandes de optimización, pero aun asi se puede jugar lo más bien, yo tengo un pentium g4560 y una 1050ti y arreglando un par de cosas (ya que está mal optimizado), puedo jugar a muy buena calidad y sin problema alguno.

the only reason you won't love this game is if you only like action fast pase games or you don't have a soul...

The game is short however is full of emotions, breathless scenes to look at, an i LOVE! that nobody is talking and the whole
story is discaverd through music visuals pictures and flashbacks

For me this game is a small crypt that i can back whenever i want to relax have some thoughs by my self and when i close the game i am a new happy person :)  because this game speaks to the soul and not the mind ... you have to let your self go with the flow of the game.

The only con of this game is some minor BUGS like the music stops playing for some reason sometimes, or the camera snaps quicly at some places you are climbing but not gamebreaking things 

Last i will say that the game is a walking puzzle game and the world migth not be big but it has so many little details to discover and the game rewards you for that :D .... and after you finish the game check the names of the chapters you played... you migth cry a little <3

我本人对解密其实并没有太大兴趣，甚至一玩解密游戏就容易犯困，比如塔罗斯法则，至今我还没通关不想再去碰。但玩RIME这款游戏我并没有这种感觉，一方面是音乐的魔力令我沉醉其中，一方面也是谜题都比较简单，并不费脑不会出现负面情绪，谜题与一些生物的互动性也极富感染力，所以到了剧情后期，有些地方也确实蛮让我感动与深思的。

Una experiencia extremadamente lineal, donde es muy extraño que uno tenga que desviarse del camino indicado. Se me canso el dedo de tanto apretar para adelanta en el gamepad. Los únicos secretos que hay son coleccionables, que agregan un poco de lore, o algún que otro disfraz.
Los puzzles son muy rudimentarios, empujar cajas, alinear objetos, poner llave genérica obtenida en x en y, donde no hay manera de no pasar por x primero antes de llegar a y. Subir por cornisas marcadas con pintura blanca en los bordes donde no hay caminos divergentes y es solo mantener el direccional del control y presionar el boton ""A"" varias veces hasta llegar al final de la sección...
La historia no es nada excepcional, y hasta el concepto del gameplay esta atado de manera muy dispar sobre la historia. Trata de evocar muchas emociones como el juego Journey de ps3, pero nunca lo logra. Es mas al estilo ABZU,. otro intento de emular a journey sin obtener ningún resultado similar.
Los gráficos si se pude decir que son hermosos, muy bien ambientado estéticamente y la variedad de ambientes. Lastima que no fue acompañado por puzzles mas complejos y un poco mas de libertad de exploración, que no estuviese atado a algún coleccionable para llenar una lista de checks.

画风肯定是没得说了，这类型游戏卖点就是画风和音乐了
不过看久了还是有点腻的，某些地方太暗了，建议玩家自己在设置里面调高亮度，可以避免很多摔死惨剧
音乐很出彩，特别是最后小男孩纵身一跃前往异界那一幕，配上BGM还是挺触动人心的(整个游戏唯一让我发麻的地方)

[h1] 剧情：7/10[/h1]
游戏一共有五章，否认→愤怒→交易→沮丧→接受，表示了小男孩整个心路历程
每一章通关后小男孩会走上一个有螺旋阶梯的匙孔之塔，每一章塔壁的壁画都不一样，与该章节主题呼应。通过匙孔之眼后也会触发动画不断解开新的剧情内幕，虽然从头到尾没有一个字但是单纯看动画也是能懂的
[spoiler] 剧情其实很短，但是当在雨中奔跑看着小伙伴们一个个离开自己，到最后发现原来自己才是幽灵，回到家里看到颓废的父亲，最后终于接受事实之后坠入塔内，父亲也与自己告别，终于愿意放下，这段往生者和在世者的离别还是挺让人感动的，这也是我觉得这游戏成功的地方。尽管它很单薄，但是它确实以自己的方式讲出来了，也确实让人意外和触动，于我而言这就足够了[/spoiler]

[h1] 个人一些小吐槽 [/h1]
1.游戏主线剧情确实很短，单纯就过主线而言四五小时足够了，解谜也比较简单，所以玩着玩着会让人觉得像走路模拟器
2.收集要素太多了，全收集很痛苦，(成就党更痛苦)，莫名其妙打了快二十个小时，重打了好几个关卡，还是边看游戏视频边打，导致游戏体验差劲很多，建议有强迫症的暴躁老哥别买了，玩到后面真心烦，就想赶快结束
3.狐狸叫声很难听，跟狗叫似的，小男孩叫声也很烦，双重叠加暴躁buff

PS：收集四个甜蜜回忆(有兴趣的可以找攻略看看)，最后看动画能出真结局(其实就是多了个妈妈……)

Where Deadlight focused on shadows, darkness and despair, Rime is a constant play of warmth, light and affirmation. This can easily been seen in the games' lovely, bright visual style but also in the overall feel of the game. Rime made me think of huge personal favorites like Journey, ICO, A tale of Two Brothers and more recently the delightful Abzu. 

Like those games Rime tells a (mostly silent) story that ends up being so much more than just a series of environments to explore, obstacles to overcome or puzzles to solve. Without going into detail and spoiling the wonderful story, Rime made my heart ache and my soul soar. This is mostly attributed to the sublime soundtrack that accompanies the games most important scenes. 

Does all that make Rime a perfect game? Unfortunatly not. The games two greatest flaws are the obtuse puzzles - which rarely go beyond pushing a button and carrying around a globe of light - and the jarring graphics. Even on my fairly powerful system I was constantly trying to ignore massive stuttering and jarring gameplay, which took away a fair bit of the enjoyment for me. 

It's a huge shame, because with some more thoughtful puzzle design and variety, and a more stable engine, Rime could have been one of those perfect games for me.

geliştiriciler; gerçekten farklı, japon animesi-nintendo oyunları karışımı güzel grafiklerle masalsı renklerle oyunu tasarlamışlar. karakter animasyonları, etrafınızdaki nesneler hep bu şekilde. gerçekten beyninizi rahatlatan bir ambians hakim.

gelelim oyuna; oyun yukarıda yazdığım gibi rahatlatıcı bir ambiansla başlasa da ilerleyen zamanlarda ağır ağır sizi bir depresyonun içine sokuyor. esasen oyunu bitirdiğinizde mantıklı olanın da bu olduğunu anlayacaksınız. karakter animasyonları çok tatlı olsa da yer yer karakteri yönlendirmede zorluklar çektim. bunda kamera açısının yeterli tutarlılıkta olmaması ve geliştiricilerin unreal engine e yeterli kapasitede hakim olamamasından kaynaklanıyor. çoğu profesyonel şirketin yapmayacağı kamera gömülme hataları, anlık yaklaşma uzaklaşma bugları çok rahatsız etmese de mevcut.

gtx 1060 la oyunu oynadım. buna rağmen yer yer rahatsız etmeyecek ölçüde de olsa fps dropları oluşabiliyor. bu da aynı şekilde unreal engine üzerinde yeterli bilgi birikiminin olmadığına delalet. 

oyun gerçekten keyifli. herhangi bir yerinde sıkıldığımı pek hatırlamıyorum. genel olarak benzer bulmacalar çözerek ilerlesek de bulmaca zorlukları dengeli seviyede. çok zorladığını söyleyemem ama çok kolay da değil. daha önce bu tarz oyunları oynamış insanlar yardım almadan bitirebileceklerdir.

en sevdiğim yanları:
-grafikler. kesinlikle tam anlatıma uygun.
-bulmaca zorluk seviyesi iş görür. çok kasıntı olmayan bulmaca oyunlarını seviyorum.
-hikaye. anlatımı ve kendisi gerçekten güzel. merak uyandıran bir anlatım, vurucu bir son. 

sevmediğim yanları:
-oyun sonunda artık iyiden iyiye kendimizi oyun sonuna hazırlamış, yavaş yavaş duygulanmışken, yağmurlu bölümde gereksiz karışık bir platform bölümü kasılmış. tamam temsil ettiği ruhsal durumu anlayabiliyorum ama  tam duygulanmışken yönümüzü iyi veremediğimiz için aşağı düşüp aynı yeri tekrar çıkmaya çalışmak oyundan uzaklaştırıyor.
-bir kaç bugla karşılaştım. neyseki ölümcül şeyler değildi. bir kere checkpointten tekrar başlatmak durumunda kaldım.
-bir puzzle oyununda en sevmediğim şey olan ""yapılacak olanı bilmek ama gerekli refleks ve beceriyi gösterememekten dolayı uğraşmak"" hissini bir kaç kez yaşadım. puzzle ın cevabını bulurken değil, cevabı uygularken zorladığı bir kaç puzzle vardı.


velhasıl indirimdeyken alın. 5-6 saatte bitebilecek bir oyun. başlangıçta geniş bir alanda beni başlatınca ne yapacağımı bilemeyip 10 dk kadar etrafta gezinip oyunu kapatmıştım. oyunu aldığımda puzzle türünde bir oyun olduğundan bile habersizdim. ikinci oturuşumda bağırmayı falan keşfedince bir daha kalkmadan oyunu bitirdim.

tavsiye ederim.

It really touched me. This game told an amazing story, while applying in a puzzle-platformer game. However, the game itself doesn’t really shine in gameplay. The puzzle feels weak, compare to other puzzle-platformer games such as Q.U.B.E. series and Portal series, where those games open up your imaginations in solving those puzzles. The platforming sometimes seems off too. There are cetain times where my protagonist just doesn’t jump to where I want to. Precision is very important in platformer games, which is why Mario is always getting the praise. However, the graphics are suited for this game, and it unfolds a very strong story, make this game worth it. 

It is better to wait for sale tho, if you are not sure of it.

[h1] The story (Heavy spoiler ahead)	[/h1]

The story starts off with a little boy wondering around, trying to seek for something. The true story slowly unfolds when the little boy progress. For people who had not yet finished or buy the game, please do not continue, this is all you need to know.

For people who had finished the game but unable to connect to the story, [spoiler] this is a story that talks about five stages of grief, in a very superb way. The little boy tries to seek for something, which I interpret as denial. The father is not accepting the death of his son during the sail. As such, everything is seems beautiful, nice and peaceful. Then, as the masking effect of denial starts to wear off, anger comes in. The “eagle” is the sign of anger. The metal ball is the sign of something important, and that the eagle, which representing the father, do not want to loss such important stuff/memories. As you progress in retrieving the metal ball, the “father” is actually slowly wearing the anger stage, and going into bargaining. However, the bargaining stage didn’t really show much from my point of view. The only significant sign is that there are times where you will see a red hood guy walks past in sight, but it slips quickly. The red hood guy is the “father”. “What if, I was there? What if, I was able to catch him?	[/spoiler]

[spoiler] As you reach to a statue where you have to activate 4 small statues, a “dark aura” strikes in the little boy, and started to walk very slow. This is the stage of “depression”. His father, at this point, realise that his son is no longer here, despite he wished to. He starts to prepare a quiet preparation (the one-eyed robots), to accept this. As the robots starts unlocking the door, so does the “door” of his heart. In the end phrase, we see the real protagonist, the father, goes into his son room. The fox figurine is right there to remind that his son is gone, and is not coming back. He later on, let go of the red hood, which in fact was belong to his son.

Este juego hace pocos años podría clasificarse de triple A, y poco tiene que envidiarle al ICO o tantos otros.

La banda sonora magistral, las animaciones, la interrelación de los personajes, la idea que subyace de cómo contar una historia sin palabras, basándose en evocar sentimientos y emociones, lo que la hace intergeneracional, interracial y multicultural.

Pese a todo, y siempre hay un pero, es cierto lo que comentan algunos, el rendimiento no es su fuerte. Lo juego en ultra con un I5 3570K y una 1080TI, y en algunas transiciones se nota la rascada de FPS. Si no fuese por esto último sería perfecto.

First let me say it's not a game for anyone, the game takes pride in the little details and in no way hands you the whole story with it's full meaning just like that, while it will of course wrap it up in the ending.... how much of the journey and it's soul piercing content you really get, it's up to you and your ability to observe and distinguish the tells along the game.
The art is simple and beautiful, and along with the amazing music it can be breathtaking if you let yourself into the game and along for the journey.

It's not a game that aims to be challenging, not even difficult. It's a casual meaningful game of exploration and puzzles (not hardcore puzzles or anything). But if you do like those games and you allow yourself to immerse in the experience, this is one of those titles you need to get.

I'm sure the developers did a good job executing what they were going for, with a nice atmosphere, an adorable greek-ish graphical style, an understated melancholic and mysterious tone, and beautiful sprawling sceneries. I really wanted to like it because the main character really looks, sounds and acts in a likable manner, and the worlds are absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, the game did not ""click"" with me.

When I saw that the main character was a shipwrecked kid on an unknown island, I expected it to be more of an open world platformer, and was quickly proven wrong. Very little of the world is open to exploration at any given time, and optional branching paths tend to be short and lead only to optional collectibles, so the bulk of the game is mostly linear.  Say, the game's worlds are less like a large tree and its branches and more like a centipede and its feet, if that makes sense. I can't give the game crap for this, however, it's just a disconnect between my expectations and reality.

Still, it doesn't help that the game pretty much punishes exploration in certain parts by making you backtrack through long obvious platforming sections if you drop down one too many tall ledges in search of secrets. I swear to god this happened to me like five times while exploring the desert world. I'd drop down a seemingly interesting path only to learn it took me back to the beginning of whatever structure I had to climb, forcing me to go a long way back up, at which point I'd just give up and walk towards my fox buddy to move on. Add to that the fact that pretty much every platforming section is an obvious zero-choice game of ""find the right thing to jump towards"" requiring no timing or skill, and you have a tedious platforming experience. Sure, one may claim that platforming is not the game's main focus, but it is still wide spread throughout the whole experience, serving as little more than a zero-stakes, zero-choice and often overlong bridge between the actually interesting bits.

To make matters worse, if you shut off the game and return to it later, you might have a hard time remembering where to go depending on where you left off, especially when the paths ahead are winding and confusing to navigate. I understand that the game does not have minimaps or pointers to avoid breaking immersion, but it'd still help to have something other than our yappy fox friend to guide us around, especially when the first thing we have to do after reloading the game is locate the bloody thing.

Dialog-free storytelling is all well and good, but after having watched a handful of cinematics and looked at some wall paintings and keyholes, all I gather is that we're a shipwrecked kid whose parents were some important folks, and the recurring pervert in the Little Red Riding Hood suit is apparently important too, as he's in our boat when it gets caught in a storm. In general, the game did not engage me enough for me to want to piece the story together. This game might contain a beautiful, deep, heart wrenching plot, but I'll never know because the game itself bored me. Maybe I'll watch a Let's Play one of these days, as having someone talking while playing feels like a sure fire way to keep it from making me fall asleep.

Anyway, let's move on to the good bits, because I do think this game has many positive traits. In spite of the linearity, and the platforming being basic and uninteresting, the game has a ton of interesting puzzles and mechanics that make for short moments of genuine enjoyment amidst the overall dragging feeling that populates most of it. While the puzzles in the first island are rather simplistic, the ones in the second island are fun and interesting, giving me that ""eureka"" feeling when I figured them out. One mechanic that stood out to me was the damn bird thing that jumpscares you if you stay too long under the sun, like the world's most adamant skin cancer awareness activist, because it ramps up the stakes, making us carefully and meticulously plan our route forward to expose ourselves for as little time as possible as we walk from sheltered area to sheltered area. Probably the second most fun part of the game.

All that is brought down, however, by the fact that the paths connecting every good part of the game are mostly uneventful and occasionally outrageously long, being basically a ""press forward simulator"", except with you occasionally having to press buttons other than forward when navigating the aforementioned boring and simplistic platforming sections.

All in all, I was disengaged. I stopped playing after a while and didn't feel like coming back to it. The game has sudden spikes in engagement when we need to overcome an actual puzzle or challenge, but those are sparsely spread out amidst mostly linear and predictable walking, jumping and swimming sections with that droning sad music. The lullaby-ish soundtrack and lack of dialog makes those sections tedious as all hell.

I really like what this game was setting out to do, but I think it took way too many liberties with the slow pace, large empty spaces, and scripted platforming sections. Maybe if there was a narrator with a deep voice or something, that might have gotten me engaged enough to plow through it, but I digress. Who knows, though, you might enjoy it more than I did, if you have a higher than average tolerance for the almost uninterrupted melancholic atmosphere, and a better brain than me to piece the story together. 

All that being said, I do think this game is a valuable little piece of art. I may come back to it one day, probably to see if I can finally try piecing the story together. Who knows, I might start liking the game after that. So yeah, my opinion of this game is more ""mixed"" than ""negative"".",1541655259,1542142279,False,6,0,0.509828031063079834,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What sets RiME apart is its unique visual landscapes that vary in tone throughout the game. Cryptic images and symbols can be found all over the maps, which add to the mystery and style of the game. I was particularly impressed with how much work went into the hidden areas, which are visual gems that make the world feel even more expansive.

Some of the ""puzzles"" were quite inventive, especially the physics bending ones, but I wouldn't call this game a puzzle game; it was an experiential game. You explore, you travel, you see. The ""puzzles"" were mostly a way of getting from one place to another and weren't very challenging. That said, I like experiential games, but you should know what you're getting with RiME.

Lastly, the score. The music was what drew me initially to the game (even though the trailer was poorly made IMO), and I was not dissappointed. I savoured the lush moments of the music, and liked how it held back during most of the game to give greater impact to those special moments. I wish the music took a more unique route, especially as the game progressed, since its influences (Joe Hisaishi, Michael Nyman, etc.) were front-and-centre throughout the entire game.

Though it has its flaws, overall, I highly recommend RiME.

Gameplay: run, jump, climb, shout, interact, that is how you play. The shouting is a form of interact that triggers the lamps and most things that have a slight glow at range, interact is used for moving blocks and picking up items. You will unlock a fox guide near the beginning of the game, and can help out with the story. The game is a railroaded story with no branches although there is plenty of space to explore for the hidden collectables. The achievements are mostly centered around exploration of the island and collecting of the optional collectables.

Difficulty: Easy, there are two types of ‘enemy’ in the game and are both easy to avoid and one acts as more of an environmental hazard. The puzzles are straightforward and never leaves the player feeling stuck, some collectable are protected by slightly tougher puzzles but remain in the easy category. Hints larger scale puzzles are given on a will that the camera will lock onto in a mini cutscene upon entering the area or given as a vision when the way to the puzzle area is opened.

Story: The games story of what is happening won't be revealed to the player until the end of the fourth chapter, until then it will raise more questions than answers. It is delivered without any dialogue making this game multilingual by default (except for the menu, credits and some hints) to offer any description of what the story is about would be an extreme spoiler. If you are the sort to allow yourself to get involved in the story/atmosphere of a game then have a box of tissues handy as the game has some sad moments around <Spoiler>.

Graphics and sound: The sound will help draw you in and one set of collectables is the parts of a lullaby. Wildlife makes the appropriate sounds when required such that it blends into the location seamlessly. Visually the game is stunning with the settings maxed out with the various areas conveying the feel of the area and showing even small details like lizards on the walls, schools of fish in the sea

Longevity: Rime a short game game that can be completed in about 8 hours for main story line and probably another 12 to get all the collectables. The game is replayable however if you want to recollect the collectable you will need to disable cloud save and delete the save file. Due to the nature of the story, expansions and direct sequels are highly improbable without sacrificing story quality.

Final verdict: An enjoyable game that will hit the feels right at the end. Recommended but not at £30 due to short length.",1541577777,1542899126,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The amazing world design, the beauty of the music, and the deeply emotional meaning that slowly becomes clear lends to an unforgetable experience. 
The puzzles and obstacles aren't especially hard, and the game is pretty forgiving if you do manage to beef it. 
It's definitely important to take your time with this game, as there's always a secret collectable hidden just out of view. While the collectables themselves don't affect the gameplay in any way, they do help flesh out the story, and they add poignancy to the ending. This isn't a case of ""find all 200 gems to unlock the true ending,"" it's the same either way, but it makes what happens way more meaningful. [I can't really say more without spoiling it.]
This is the kind of game I'd pay +$60 for. The care and commitment Tequila Works put into making a beautiful experience is apparent in just about every little detail, and I'm still not over the ending.

TL;DR: RIME is an amazing game and a beautiful story. Its casual puzzles are forgiving but entertaining, and the big reveal at the end will stick with you for a while.

While it's not quite as good as Ico itself is, it shares many characteristics of it (a puzzle platformer with no spoken dialogue in a beautiful setting laden with the feels).

Puzzles are well designed, with a few core mechanics used consistently but with slightly different twists each time, so they are familiar enough to solve without getting boring.

Platforming is straightforward and forgiving; there's a few times you can get lost or miss the cues about where to go next, but the controls handle well and if you do miss a jump you're usually landed right back ready for another go without losing any progress.  (The jumps themselves tend to err on the forgiving side; on occasion your character will visibly not quite make the jump but the game will let you latch on and continue anyway rather than dropping you into the void.  I consider this a good thing.)  There are a few spots where it probably would have been better to use a controller (due to camera angles and needing to do the two-key running shuffle), but I played through using keyboard and mouse just fine.

The environments are beautiful (especially at the beginning, although later chapters are still beautiful in a different way).  The only downer here is that on my system (which is not the best, but is reasonably decent) there are quite a few spots where it's unable to maintain a stable 60 FPS, so wide angle camera motion in particular can sometimes suffer a bit.  As this only really happened during cinematic transitions it never particularly affected gameplay.

There is a definite story in the game, although it's one that's best experienced for yourself, and since it is of the ""silent but evocative"" type, in some cases each person might come away with a slightly different idea of what story it was actually telling, somewhat informed by their own experiences.  But this is fine, and as long as you see it through to the end (and avoid spoiling yourself beforehand) you should get something good out of it.  Several articles have been written based on interviews with the game's creators as well as other people's experiences of the story, but you really should try to avoid reading these until you've played it through at least once on your own.

For the explorers and completionists, it comes with a healthy number of hidden secrets, collectibles, and achievements, which you can either spend time hunting down on your first playthrough or use the Chapter Select feature to jump back later on to collect things you missed.  (There are only one or two things that are actually impossible to find on your first playthrough, although unless you're very thorough you're likely to miss quite a bit more than that.)

And as more and more indie developers became enabled to use powerful engines that allow creating something mechanically simple, but beautiful and, hopefully, evocative, the amount of games of this type went up dramatically. RiME is just another example of this type of game. Made with lots of care, genuinely good looking, with a good story concept behind it and yet all too familiar, not particularly fun and ultimately forgettable.

The big issue RiME has lies in the fact that the game never really gets anything to truly hook you with. You run, jump, climb and scream at things to solve problems as you start the game, and that's all you do until the end, with all of these basic mechanics being rather bland. There's never any clever challenge or strategy involved with the platforming bits as they just use the modern approach to 3D platforming where you go along the only (and usually obvious) path, clearly outlined and never need to think where you are in space. Puzzles suffer from a bizarre decision to make action button work only after a short pause after a full stop and scream not working at times if another animation is playing, meaning you always come to a full stop, wait a bit and then hope that you can perform the action necessary, which isn't helping already mundane puzzle design.

And the game never properly knows if it wants to be about exploration or not, as it would give you a bunch of things to collect throughout the game world, and give you an open space, but then can just push you into a linear path when you least expect it with no way to backtrack and see if you've missed anything. In addition right from the start it gives you one of the most obnoxious ""guide"" I've encountered in games - a magic fox that barks (more like yaps) to ""help"" you find the way. With the issue being that it always does it either when there's only one way you can take, or when it's somewhere offscreen and you can't possibly know how to get to it, making it useless and annoying in both cases. And not helping if you're trying to explore.

There's no good story or even mood hook either. There's an attempt at one, but when the revelation of what this game is all about comes, it feels unexpected because the game never actually delivers on that mood at any point prior to that. Like if I'd start showing you my ninth grade pictures while punk rock plays and then at the end tell that this experience was meant to help you understand how to make better pasta. It's not completely unrelated because I like pasta, but... It still doesn't feel like that's what the experience was supposed to be about.

Not that the game doesn't try to be interesting and evocative. It does look good, it does sound good (sans that annoying fox), there are a few puzzles that aren't boring and there are moments that are genuinely interesting. And there is a certain desire to make the game feel as varied as it could. It's just that this isn't enough and it's one of those instances where after finishing the game in 5 hours you feel drained as if you spent the entire day and all your energy on it without really getting anything in return.

RiME seems to have its heart in the right place and it does feel like it tried to be an interesting moving and beautiful journey. But it's not what it turned out to be. It's not a game you should be specifically avoiding and maybe you would have some good times with it, just wondering around and enjoying the look and the mood of the areas. But I can't recommend specifically purchasing the game unless you get it as part of some bundle as your time and money would be better spent elsewhere. ",1541277498,1541277498,False,69,0,0.794564545154571533,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+Atmosféra je skvělá, nevěděl jsem co si mám myslet, ale byl jsem celou dobu na špičkách.
+Grafika perfektně stylizovaná, neměl jsem sebemenší výtku, líbila se mi.
+Hudba perfektní, přesně pasuje, tak akorát.
+Ovládání responsivní bez problémů (gamepad X360).
+Délka přibližně 5 hodin, chtěl jsem jednohubku.. dostal jsem jednohubku.

Neutrální:
+/-Puzzly jsou fajn (občas excelentní), ale repetitivní, nejsem zrovna myslitel, ale vyřešil jsem valnou většinu sám, takže obtížnost je snadná.
+/-Level design je okey, občas to moc natahují, což mě nebavilo.

-Optimalizace špatná, na i5 skylake, GTX970 jsem se dostával až na 30 FPS, na High nastavení, což není dobrá vizitka.

The game also has a lot of different collectables very relevant to the main story, which adds a bit of replayability.

Things that could have been better/improved: Puzzles (except a couple, they were simple and lacking originality). Duration (I completed the game finding half the collectables in 5 hours). Controls (a bit clunky time to time on some jumps/platforming). None of this negative aspects are really too relevant tho, the game is still enjoyable!

Die Story ist nicht aufdringlich, aber hat ihre Meta-Ebene die sie durchdacht und nicht zu verkopft umsetzt. Das Spiel startet mit kindlichen Entdeckerdrang und wird mit der Zeit etwas düsterer und melancholisch. Macht das Gesamtkonzept und die Story aber nur runder und beeindruckender. Kann aber auch sein, dass es nicht ganz das Kinderspiel ist, für das man es erst halten könnte. Durchgespielt hat man das Game in 6-8 Stunden. Was mir positiv auffiel, keine unnötigen Längen, einfach eine runde Spielerfahrung. Technisch ist das Spiel ressourcen-hungriger als gedacht. Wer ohne Action gelangweilt ist, darf weiter gehen, der Rest sollte RiME seine Chance geben, die hat es sich verdient, aber so was von!",1540775196,1540775196,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

RiME is a game about a boy who washed up on an island, after waking up he wanders off the shore and deeper into the island. He begins solving puzzles to progress further and ends up coming across a fox who helps him navigate the island and in doing so, he and the fox become friends. Through his puzzle solving and exploration, he uncovers a story. The further he goes the more he uncovers.

===[ Target Audience ]===
☐ Kids
☑ Everyone

===[ Graphics and Environment ]=== 
☐ Really bad
☐ Bad
☐ Ok
☐ Good 
☐ Beautiful 
☑ Masterpiece
{I found both the graphics and environment absolutely stunning. It gave me a Shadow of the Colossus/The Last Guardian feel. Even though the art style is simplistic, it doesn't at all take away from the overall feel of the game. The environment only adds to the overall immersion.}

===[ Requirments ]=== 
☐ 90' PC
☐ Minimum
☑ Medium 
☐ Fast
☐ High end 
☐ NASA computer
{Though you don't need a beast of a computer to play this game, it can be hard on your PC in certain areas. There were times where I would drop down to about 30FPS, with my average being 60FPS. But that's nothing lowering the graphics can't fix, and trust me when I say, lowering the graphics doesn't effect how the game looks, or at least it didn't for me.}

===[ Gameplay ]=== 
☐ Boring
☐ Ok
☐ Fun
☐ Very Fun
☑ Amazing
{I found the gameplay to be amazing. Though I did take breaks, that was only to rest my eyes. I didn't find myself getting bored with this game for a sinlge second.}

===[ Sound/Music ]===
☐ Poor
☐ Ok
☐ Good
☐ Great
☑ Masterpiece
{Along with the graphics and environment, the sound and music was breathtaking. The music added even more to the environment, it is as if they worked in tandem with one another.}

===[ Difficulty ]=== 
☐ You just need 2 arms 
☐ Easy
☑ Medium
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master 
☐ Hard
☐ Dark Souls
{Though this game isn't hard by any means, it can still be difficult at some parts.}

☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)
☑ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)
☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)
☐ Long ( 12+ hours)
☐ Endless
{I beat it in just under 5 hours. It may not be a long game, But what it lacks game length, it makes up for with good graphics, environment, music, and story.}

===[ Story ]=== 
☐ It doesn't have
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Very good
☑ Fantastic
{Instead of the story being told to you, it's rather shown to you through picture and visuals. This adds so much to the story as its relies less of your ears and more on your imagination.}

☐ Game itself is one big BUG
☐ Bugs destroyed the game
☐ Lot of bugs
☐ Few Bugs
☐ Sometimes
☑ Nothing
{I didn't come across a single bug.}

===[ Final rating ]===

===[ Notes ]===
I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in it. Its been a long time since a game has given me goosebumps or made me feel for a character, and this game did both.

L'histoire est pas mal, mais même si c'est pas fou non plus, c'est le point fort du titre, surtout à la fin où l'on comprend le délire. Il faudra compter 6-7h pour terminer le jeu (en fouinant un peu à gauche et à droite). En ce qui concerne les énigmes, c'est toujours les mêmes, ça peine à se renouveler. En plus, l'exploration c'est surtout pour trouver les collectibles cachés. Collectibles qui ne sont pas totalement inutiles, même si ça relève du bonus. 
Dans le lot il y a quelques bonnes idées mais pas assez exploitées. 

Ajoutons à cela divers petits bugs qui m'ont poussé, à plusieurs reprises, à relancer la partie depuis le dernier checkpoint. En parlant checkpoint, ils sont assez hasardeux et le retour en partie peut être un peu perturbant quand on se retrouve 200m plus loin dans une salle que l'on avait pas encore exploré. Sans oublier des murs invisibles gênants. En plus, je trouve que le jeu est mal optimisé.

Ce que je trouve le plus aberrant c'est le prix auquel ce jeu est vendu, 35€ à l'heure où je tape ces mots. C'est beaucoup trop cher pour ce que c'est, ce prix ne RiME à rien..

Both the visuals and audio are done with such perfection you are moved in ways most large budget titles cannot achieve, and while there is action in a common sense this doesn't hold back the title whatsoever. Not many games have actually brought me to tears but the ending of RiME did just that. However this game is purely an atmospheric title; almost an interactive story. The platforming is very slippery and there is no fighting aside from some puzzles which lead to action. That said the puzzles are quite interesting and deal with day and night, which as well correspond too the story itself.

In short RiME is easily worth your dollar. I most definitly recommend it.

La mayor virtud de esta producción del equipo español Tequila Works, es sobre todo la belleza, tanto visual como sonora, pese a que realmente se nota que el estilo artístico es una muy buena copia de Ghibli, en ambos aspectos.
Por un lado la banda sonora parece compuesta por el mismismo Joe Hisaishi, con temas que parecen sacados de La princesa Mononoke, y por otro lado el aspecto gráfico que parece que estemos viendo un hijo de toda la filmografía del estudio :D.
Respecto a la banda sonora, mención especial al tema creado por la violinista ""youtuber"" Lindey Stirling, y un tema vocal en español.
También se puede comparar bastante con Abzu, Journey e Ico. Es más, el juego ha pasado apenas sin hacer ruido, cuando no tiene absolutamente nada que envidiar a Journey por ejemplo.

No obstante donde para mi falla es en su exploración, el juego tiene unos escenarios increíbles, que daban para hacer mucho mas juego y una sensación de exploración mas profunda. Tenían que haber creado una suerte de mundo abierto y poder recorrerlo de principio a fin y volver cuando queramos o necesitemos, sin embargo han optado por un sistema por capítulos ""inconexos"" entre ellos que en mi opinión no le hace bien.
Los puzzles tampoco es que sean muy complejos, aunque hay alguna mecánica jugable algo original. 

La historia a diferencia de Abzu, o Journey, es bastante clara de entender, y no es la típica fumada mental de tantos juegos indie que salen hoy en día.

Para terminar decir que su rendimiento es bastante malo, pese a tener unos reflejos cojonudos que hacen chupar fps cosa mala.

Recomiendo el juego siempre y cuando nos gusten los juegos relajantes y te llame la estética tan cuidada que tiene.

I don't want to spoil too much, but the end will have some people having wet eyes.

This game is one i really can recommend.  I really wanted to start playing it when i came back on my pc, but i tried to play a level at a sitting so i had to refrain myself when i had only like half an hour.  I probably used more time than the average player, but that's because i also went on looking for items and i have a fair amount of them (all toys, all emblems, 4/6 lullabies, etc etc). 
If you just want a game where you puzzle a bit and have really nice aestethics, then i can also recommend this game, it's got a really nice atmosphere.  For those that also go itemhunting; it gets reflected at the end of the game but i can't tell too much about it as it would spoil the story. Look at it as a little incentive you get ...

I got this game in a bundle (i believe it came with humble monthly, not sure anymore) and the quality of the game really makes the full price worth it, although if you don't search for items the playtime gets shorter and then i'd pay about 50% of it's regular price (which is €17.50 instead of 35€) I believe 20€ wouldve been a better price for the game, but the level of detail they've put into the game and thus work, makes the original price not really overpriced if you appreciate the gametype and play it to it's full extend (thus searching for the extra's).

Graphical fidelity is good (runs on Unreal Engine 4) but the aesthetics are more important to lend to the perspective of the character. The theme is purposely inconsistent between the areas which is hard to elaborate on without ruining parts of the story. Puzzles are simple enough though they do better with creativity than difficulty, some puzzles use perspective, light/shadows and day/night cycle, you will never find yourself stuck though as they stay fairly simple push, pull, carry, climb type puzzles akin to Zelda (though a lot less demanding than Zelda's), pushing yourself past the first area or two is important as they feel over simplified. The controls are good and responsive (even on mouse and keyboard) but like the puzzles, the platforming stays simple to the point some mechanics (like rolling) feel unnecessary and under utilized. The more important point of the game is the aspect that is hard to talk about in a review, the story (that is told with no words) but it doesn't take long before you know something is wrong here...

한글화가 없음에도 ABZU와 같이 게임 내 대사가 나오지 않는 게임이라서 플레이에 지장이 없다.
그러나, 스토리를 진행하면서 도대체 무슨 목적으로 게임을 진행 하는 지 알기가 힘들 수 있다. (물론 결말 부분에서 이 여정이 왜 시작되었는지, 왜 지속되었는지, 숨겨진 아이템들은 뭔지 다 알게 된다.) 

퍼즐요소들은 많지 않고 난이도도 어렵지 않다.  길 찾기가 중요한 게임이다.

위의 요소들에도 불구하고 불편한 시점과 불편한 조작감은 어쩔 수 없다. 그러나 충분히 참고 견딜만 하다고 생각한다.

개인적 기준으로 다시 정리하자면 

그래픽과 배경음악 - 충분히 만족스럽다.

시점과 조작감 - 상당히 거슬렸다.
 
결론 : 정가에 사기엔 상당히 아까운 게임이다.

Beautiful Graphics - Cuty characters, vibrant motions, make players satisfied.
Beautiful BGM - During playing, harmonized music makes you concentrate on game.

A few & easy puzzle moments, mostly find the way to get destinations.

Although above things, inconvenient camera angle&controls devalue this game a little bit. But, it was bearable to me tho.

Graphis & BGM - Satisfied enoughly.
Stories - not bad

The gameplay is not particularly original. It felt like I had already seen these kinds of puzzles, these kinds of adventure in many games before this one. If you already played Tomb Raider, or Zelda, for example, you'll get it. It's not much difficult either, except if you want to get all the achievements. It's also (mostly) linear: even if some places may be huge, there is always only one path. There are not many characters. You'll mostly follow a magic friendly fox, and a mysterious guy with a red cape who remains out of reach. There are some minor defaults, like a camera which sometimes takes dubious initatives, or some zones so dark that I had to switch off the light in my room. It also requires a decent computer.

But it's a utterly fantastic game, and for me one of the best games of 2017. Why? Because of the ambience.
If the vivid screenshots and the trailers didn't give you the compulsive desire to click ""Buy"" right now, wait, there is more:
[list]
 [*] First, like I said it's not difficult; but it's a good point, because you never feel stuck up very long, it's enjoyable.
 [*] Second, the environment is fantastic. It felt like I was visiting an abandoned crumbling civilisation and I wondered during most of the game what happened and what it was all about.
 [*] Third, the melancholic music, barely audible during the game and yet omnipresent, helps me put in this state of wonder.
 [*] Fourth, the story is great, even if it is sad, and is rarely present in the game. The game - all of it - fits the story, and not the contrary.
[/list]

In the end, the downside is that the game is not that long (9 hours for me without speeding up, including getting a good part of the achievements)...

- Very easy to use controls.
- A very touching storyline.
- Is able to tell a story without words extremely well.

Cons:

What I got instead felt like a walking simulator without sufficient payoff, narrative or otherwise.

The single factor that killed this game for me is the size of the environments, combined with the glacially slow pace. Movement speed in particular would have had to be twice or thrice as high for me not to constantly get bored to tears. It's rage-inducingly slow.

And once a game screws up like that way, you know it won't work in other ways, either. For instance, despite the description of ""exploration"", the game is almost entirely linear except for various hidden collectables. But trying to collect those is deeply unsatisfying. Partly due to the glacial movement speed, which discourages walking around. But also because stage select is chapter-based, so trying to collect missing doodads after the fact sounds like soul-crushing pain.

There's no way to save manually, and the autosave mechanic is pretty bad; I played through the game in a few sessions and typically had to replay a small section each time.

The game is rather pretty, I do admit. But it's also full of dark areas and zones, and those didn't work for me at all.

When it comes to the puzzles themselves, there aren't that many, and most of them are mediocre or trivially easy.

A concrete plot underlies the game, but it's told in a very vague, nonverbal way. The end seems neat-ish, but also disconnected from what came before. I had to read a story explanation to make any sense of it. Not my kind of storytelling.

I hated this game. It felt like it was designed entirely to waste the player's time. Like some business guy realized the game only had 2-3 hours of content, and promptly cut movement speed by 1/2 or 2/3 to pad the playtime numbers. Instead of this mediocre game that does neither puzzles nor exploration well, I recommend purer games instead: e.g. The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll for puzzles; and A Hat in Time, a Mario game, or Hollow Knight for platforming and exploration.

Ogni anno esce un nuovo Battlefield, un nuovo COD, un nuovo FIFA, un nuovo F1; microtransazioni e meccaniche di gioco rotte e frustranti pullulano nel ricco paesaggio videoludico, ma ho troncato la lista per pietà.
Non è tuttavia per un pessimo film che la filmografia precipita dall'Olimpo artistico, diventando mero intrattenimento.

A quelle persone ottuse e retrograde che trattano [b]ancora[/b] (dopo 30 e più anni dalla nascita) il videogioco come svago fine a se stesso o peggio ancora come [i]arma di distruzione di massa[/i] o lavaggio del cervello, a quelle persone bisognerebbe far giocare giochi come RiME e chiedergli se non si sono emozionati per davvero.

Un videogioco, fosse soltanto che dura molto più di un film, richiede una propria partecipazione, indispensabile. Viene da sè che l'attaccamento emotivo ai personaggi, gli scenari, le musiche, (un po' meno spesso) le meccaniche, è... significativo.
Per questo quando si finisce un gioco su cui si sono passate ore e ore, a volte ai titoli di coda la lacrimuccia scende.

La mecanica es bastante simple, y la simplicidad lo hace tan bello, resolver puzzles e ir avanzando, muy chulos todos, no muy dificiles, bien adaptados para que no llegues a momentos frustrantes y no puedas avanzar (al menos desde mi perspectiva).

Dieses Spiel hat mich einfach total geflasht!

Für alle, die nicht gern viel lesen - vllt solltet ihr euch ein anderes Review suchen. Das hier könnte etwas länger werden.

Zu allererst: ich bin begeistert von diesem Graphikstil. Obwohl er so schlicht und einfach ist und auch irgendwo sehr kindlich wirkt, schafft er es, wundervolle Orte und Landschaften darzustellen. Auf eine Art und Weise, die bewirkt, dass ich an dem ein oder anderen Ort einfach für längere Zeit stehen geblieben bin und den Anblick habe auf mich wirken lassen oder an anderen Stellen länger herumgelaufen bin, als nötig war.
Jeder einzelne Ort und jede Landschaft hat ihren ganz eigenen Zauber, der einem zum Teil einfach nur den Atem verschlägt. Ich wäre gern länger dort geblieben ;)
Auch der Soundtrack ist von besonderer Schönheit. Ich kenn nur wenige Spiele, die es mit dem Soundtrack von Rime aufnehmen könnten. Er passt perfekt zu den einzelnen Situationen und besteht aus wunderschönen Meolodien, die trotz ihrer vergleichsweisen Komplexität nicht aufdringlich sind, sonder weiterhin im Hintergund das Spiel untermalen und die Intensität des Spielerlebnisses noch verstärken.

Zuletzt das Spiel selbst: Zu Beginn des Spiels strandet man am Strand einer unbekannten Insel, deren markantestes Merkmal ein riesiger weiser Turm ist. Im Folgenden stehen die Erkundung der Insel und das lösen diverser Rätsel im Mittelpunkt des Spiels.
Eine genaue Erkundung lohnt sich hierbei nicht nur, um die verschiedenen Punkte der einzelnen Landschaften zu entdecken - gleichzeitig können auch verschiedenste Dinge gefunden werden.
Die Rätsel waren relativ einfach (ich habe aber auch schon etwas Erfahrung mit Rätseln) - nichts, was man nicht schaffen kann (auch als Rätselanfänger). Manchmal ist ein wenig Geduld gefragt, zum Teil können Rätsel auch erst später gelöst werden (womit wir wieder bei der Erkundung der Gegenden wären) und bei anderen lohnt sich genaueres Hinsehen.
Im Verlauf der Erkundungen und des Lösens der Rätsel wird einem Stück für Stück in kurzen Episoden die Geschichte offenbart. Dazu möchte ich ungern mehr sagen - es ist eine Geschichte, die jeder für sich selbst entdecken und interpretieren muss. Nur so viel: Lange Zeit wusste ich nicht genau, worauf die Story hinauslaufen wird und war gespannt darauf, was der nächste Teil bringen würde. Es lohnt sich, dran zu bleiben!
Die Charaktere, die im Spiel auftauchen sind mit viel Liebe gestaltet und jeder wächst einem im Laufe des Spiels irgendwie ans Herz. Es gibt keine Dialoge - stattdessen wird alles über Mimiken und Gestiken ausgedrückt, was eine noch stärkere Bindung zu den Charakteren hervorruft.
Von der Steuerung her: Ich hab mit Maus und Tastatur gespielt - kann also nichts zur Steuerung mit einem Controller sagen (obwohl ich das vllt auch mal noch ausprobier). Die Steuerung ist einfach und jeder, der öfter mit Maus und Tastatur spielt, sollte sie im Grunde schon kennen :) Ich hatte nur wenige Stellen, an denen es mit der Steuerung oder der Kamera nicht ganz so war, wie ich es vllt gern gehabt hätte. Im Großen und Ganzen hat alles supergut funktioniert.

Ich persönlich bin auf jeden Fall total begeistert von diesem Spiel und werde es vermutlich noch das ein oder andere Mal neu anfangen und nochmals spielen.

Für alle, die sich überlegen das Spiel zu kaufen: Ich würde jederzeit wieder in dieses Spiel investieren.
Noch eine Bemerkung für alle, die es sich gekauft haben und es anfangen: Ihr werdet den Turm früher erreichen, als ihr vermuten würdet - aber keine Angst, das Spiel geht länger, als man denken würde. 7h Spielzeit sind auf jeden Fall drin :)",1533488737,1533488737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Instead, RiME copies the superficial qualities of those games, like the minimalism. ""If there are no words used in our game, that MUST mean that the game is deep!"", thinks RiME.

A ver por donde empiezo...
Es un juego que, en su mecánico es bastante básico, y donde se podría haber profundizado un poco más en cuanto a tipos de movimientos del personaje, fluidez y realismo en algunas físicas... Pero después de habérmelo pasado dos veces, creo que su encanto reside en esa sencillez. No es complicado de superar, por lo que es un título apto para todo tipo de público, pese que la profundidad de la historia no lo sea. Es una historia arrolladora y aplastante como la vida misma... Lo que empieza como una aventura de un niño que despierta en una isla desierta, sin saber por qué ""que por cierto la isla es preciosa, con ese toque de isla griega"", se convierte en un viaje cada vez mas oscuro, misterioso y lúgubre, para darte cuenta, y no hago spoilers, de que al final, todo era algo muy distinto a lo que el juego te estaba mostrando y darte un buen gancho de izquierdas al corazón... Vamos, que si eres un poco sensiblero como yo, acabas llorando a moco tendido con el final xDDD Y aquí reside la importancia de una buena historia señores, el hecho de que al tenerla, al juego se le perdonen otros fallos, como los que anteriormente he mencionado. Ya no me importa la sencillez de la mecánica, ni el irrealismo de algunos movimientos o físicas... este juego me ha llegado al alma y me ha hecho LLORAR señores... que hoy en día es muy difícil... Porque aunque no lo parezca, este juego trata de algo muy común de la vida cotidiana de las personas... Algo por lo que todo el mundo pasa.

Lo recomiendo encarecidamente en versión PC, ahora que no tiene DNUVO, luce genial a 60FPS.
La banda sonora es preciosa, y me encanta que el estudio de TEQUILA haya decidido poner una canción final para los créditos en español, si señor! Que quede la marca ESPAÑA en algo de tanta calidad...

Me hubiera encantado que el viaje durase mas, en unas 7-8 horas puedes pasártelo en una primera pasada, depende de la facilidad que tengas en resolver sus puzzles, pero habría estado genial que el mundo de RiME hubiera sido mas basto y grande, pero supongo que el presupuesto para este título era algo limitado... No hablamos de un Assassin's claro...
Ojalá les vaya bien a TEQUILA para poder hacer un RiME 2 u otro título diferente con la misma magia.

I would actually describe Rime like that: developers took Journey mechanics, expanded it to big locations and flavored it with mystique and more or less reasonable ending. If you still do not sure whether you should buy it or not, here are the details:

Graphics – just perfect. Seriously, about 2 hours of my walkthrough I just walked and enjoyed sceneries. The picture is far from photo-realistic but it has its own soft, vivid, saturated style, which creates just wonderful beauties, the sky at night is just something indescribable.
After completion, I collected whole wallpaper pack for my desktop, where half of the pictures were my own screenshots. 

Atmosphere is also hard to characterize. I would just say that you dive into the game’s wonders and become astonished by the sceneries. 

Music is great. It perfectly fits the graphics and atmosphere, and the only drawback is inability to by soundtrack directly in Steam. 

Story. Well, I don’t wanna spoil it, so I’ll tell you shortly: itself it is not really unique, but with the local storytelling and narrative where you do not really understand what’s happening until the end of the game, it becomes just great and perfectly fits the game. 

Gameplay. Frankly, not much to say about it. It mostly resembles Journey, the only differences are bigger levels, more freedom and various goals or destinations throughout the game. The rest is quite similar: you walk through beautiful surroundings, solve easy puzzles and encounter only 1-2 aggressive creatures during the whole game. For some it may seem too meditative boring but it’s nice for such a game and complements it. 

So, all in all, RiME is great and in some part even original game, because, despite usual utilized elements, together they form something new and unique.

PROS:
-Original puzzle mechanic.
-Excellent design.
-Good Music.
CONS:
-Not challenging at all. You have to get how a puzzle work, once you get it that mechanic will repeat over and over and over.
-A tendency I've seen in other games and I hate, is the fact that it's easy to advance to some area or trigger a cutscene and loose all access to previous areas that you wanted to explore.
-Very linear.
-The story does not catch you, once you see that nothing you do will lead to any answer; until the end, which is extremly topic and overdone.
-Controls do not work properly. It is frustrating to die several times at a stupid jump.

とある島に漂着した少年がキツネの力を借りながら島の塔の上を目指すという内容だ。適度な難易度のアクションとパズル、作り込まれた雰囲気とマップのアクションアドベンチャーとなっている。
ゲーム開始時にいきなり広い場所に放り込まれるのでオープンワールドと思いがちだが、チャプターごとに分かれている広いマップだ。地形は入り組んでいるがパズルやカメラによる制限、キツネの動きで移動先を示してくれるので迷わないように工夫されている。基本的には一本道だがところどころにシークレットが隠されており探索も十分にできる。パズルは試しに仕掛けを動かして手探りで考える必要があるが難しすぎず簡単すぎない良いバランスだ。中には影を合わせるというような周囲の地形を利用したパズルがある。また、死んでも近くの場所から即リスタートできる親切設計だが任意セーブはできない。

アクションやパズル、ストーリーテリングの配分や難易度など全体的にバランスが非常に良いゲームだと思う。トゥーン調のグラフィックだがマップがきっちり作り込まれており非常に綺麗だ。波などの水の流れや風を感じさせる表現、色合いも美しい。明暗の表現も良いと思う。意外性のあるラストも良い。カメラ制限や暗さで見づらい場面はあるが短所と言うほどではないと思う。

Sarà breve, impersonerete un ragazzo che si ritrova su di un'isola sperduta, dopo essere caduto dalla barca del padre.
In questa isola non incontrerete altri umani, ma una volpe che vi farà da guida, portandovi ad esplorare il paesaggio e e che vi condurrà a quello che spererete sia la vostrra salvezza.
Il punto di forza di Rime è sicuramente l'ambientazione, i paesaggi sono incantevoli, emozionanti, vi toglieranno il fiato e gli enigmi e i puzzle non troppo difficili non vi distoglieranno da questo vostro viaggio attraverso questa isola della meraviglie, mentre cercherete di risolvere i misteri che avvolgono l'isola e l'oscuro figuro che vdrete di tanto in tanto.
Solo verso la fine del gioco inizierete a capire quale sia la verità dietro tutto questo viaggio, le emozioni vi accompagneranno fino allo straziante finale che è proprio ciò che merita questa grande piccola perla di gioco.

Ve lo consiglio se vi piacciono i giochi tranquilli, in cui avete il tempo per esplorare e deliziarvi con la vista dei meravigliosi paesaggi.
Non fà per voi se cercate puzzle che vi mettano seriamente alla prova o giochi con quests che vi guidino attraverso tutto il gioco, in quanto non esiste un vero e proprio obiettivo.

this is a pretty, somber, quiet experience that really nails the aesthetic and tone it was shooting for. it easily brings you through a gambit of emotions such as confusion, loneliness, joy and melancholy. its not so much that the story is complicated so much as it is very well told. there's no dialogue in this game so all the story telling has to be shown and not told. from a movie fans perspective i appreciate this.  its amazing how such a simple game can brig so much to the table with such a simple story. this is where the game shines. where the game could do a bit better is on the difficulty side. the puzzles and climbing sections make up the bulk of the experience and while they are clearly not phoned in they didn't really break the mold or challenge me. there's nothing inherently wrong with that of course but your not going to feel like your breaking new grounds. no completely unique mechanic that lights you up, nothing too hard. that's gonna turn some people off. there was maybe one or two puzzles that slowed me down for a sec but nothing too hard. there's a place for that in gaming in my opinion though. not everyone wants to be scratching there heads for hours on every single puzzle.for me this broke no deals.

RiME is a puzzle adventure game in the mold of ICO and The Last Guardian, while also evocative of other indies like Journey, Abzu and The Unfinished Swan. If you enjoyed any of those titles, then I’d say it’s safe to say that you will really enjoy RiME.

Originally debuting with 2012’s Deadlight, developer Tequila Works delivers a real gem with RiME. While I enjoyed Deadlight, a good-not-great post-apocalyptic sidescroller, I would have never guessed they had it in them to make a game like RiME. I compared the game to Sony exclusives ICO and The Last Guardian, which is funny because at one time RiME too was a Sony exclusive. I’d say the split worked out pretty well for Tequila Works and gamers as a whole since more people get to play it now. I also firmly believe that RiME is a better game, and experience, than either ICO or The Last Guardian.

Being as spoiler free as possible, you play as a young boy who wakes up on a mysterious island. On this island you solve various environmental puzzles that I found to be both fun and intuitive. The game strikes a good balance of being accessible to most people while not making its solutions obvious on first glance. The game also boasts a striking visual aesthetic than is strong throughout and wholly cohesive.

Gameplay wise, it’s most similar to The Last Guardian, albeit with much, much better controls. I actually couldn’t finish TLG because I found the controls to so offensively bad. RiME is much better with it and I rarely found myself missing a jump and falling off something. Luckily, if you do make a wrong jump the checkpoint system is quite generous, so you’ll never lose too much progress. Perhaps the thing that most impressed me gameplay wise was the camera system. So often in third person games the camera can get hung up on the environment or just plain get in your way. This is not the case with RiME at all. It’s very cinematic and truthfully I rarely had to touch the camera controls. It always seems to be in the right place at the right time and more importantly does not impede you at all.

I’m keeping this review somewhat intentionally vague because I think it’s best to go in blind. If you liked the games I mentioned at the top, then know that this is a game for you. It often bests what those games do and will definitely deliver on the emotional beats as well. Tequila Works really outdid themselves with this one and delivered one of the best indie experiences of the past couple of years in my eyes. This should be a game in everyone’s collection.",1530487918,1607228724,True,5,2,0.561151683330535889,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Take your fingers completely off the keyboard between movement changes during climbing puzzles. I'm guessing it doesn't handle key-holding well because the game was designed for controllers. Except for that and a few issues with climb-onto-box-directly-in-front-of-you, keyboard + mouse works just fine.

TIP2: Achievement Hunters! Don't even bother looking for the various collectibles if you want to avoid a walkthrough on your first playthrough. You absolutely will not find them, and some are pretty convoluted and will require multiple playthroughs. Do yourself a favor and play the game once for the story, and then again for the achievements. I HATE using guides/walkthroughs, but it's a must for this game.

Recommending this game because I bought it on sale and got at least a dozen hours of playtime out of it. Under any other circumstances this would be a negative review due to poor performance, lack of manual saving, poor controls, tedious achievements, and an embarrassingly bad-looking protagonist. Aesthetics aside, the reason for making a game in this style is an easy performance win, but too much unoptimized-for-PC polish added to that makes the game run sluggishly. I'm sure it runs great on consoles, but the cool water effects just aren't worth the frame loss on PC when you have a main character whose face looks like Mr. Potatohead. To estimate 6 hours of playtime (single playthrough) seems reasonable, but $30 for a game with no replayability outside of achievements seems steep to me. For $15 though, there's enough good going on that I recommend it.",1530478371,1530478984,True,10,0,0.652059435844421387,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ce jeu est tout simplement une pure merveille. Un mélange d'onirisme et de poésie portée par une ambiance graphique et sonore irréprochable, le tout, offrant une narration impécable.

Pourtant, le jeu est court, très court en fait (pour l'histoire sans chercher tous les objet à trouver) vu que je l'ai fini en 7 heures. Cela dit, le fait que l'histoire ne soit pas plus longue fait sens et une fois le jeu terminé, je me suis dit que plus long, ça aurait pu être raté. Mais certains aspects du jeu sont pour moi un peu trop survolés (je ne peux rien dire de plus ici, cela spoilerait) et auraient mérité qu'on leur accorde plus de temps.

Pendant que j'ai joué à ce jeu, j'étais vraiment dedans, ce jeu est bien fait en tout point : On se laisse porté par l'histoire, on ne se prend pas la tête, les ""morts"" seront rares et nullement rageante, en fait, ce jeu vous fait passer un moment agréable. N'est-ce pas le but premier d'un jeu vidéo ? Vraiment, dans ce jeu, on se sens plus dans un film que dans un jeu.

Pour ce qui est du gameplay, rien à redire de mon côté :
- Prise en main facile : Z-Q-S-D + 3 touches dont une sur la souris.
- Plateformes simples, agréables et intuitives (90% du temps) et d'une manière générale, je déteste les jeux de plateforme.
- Enigmes simples et très intuitives, avec peu de variations sans pour autant tomber dans un jeu rébarbatif, les énigmes sont cools jusqu'à la fin du jeu.
- Un gameplay rapide et fluide (j'ai quelques lags en jouant mais mon PC ne supporte pas la moitié des jeux actuels sans avoir quelques lags).
- Ce jeu se finit tout seul, si vous n'aimez pas les jeux impossibles à finir, celui-là n'offre qu'une résistance minime.

Prix : Je l'ai acheté à 50% et je ne suis pas vraiment déçu d'avoir attendu car le jeu à beau être proche de la perfection dans presque tous ses aspects, 35€ les 7 heures, c'est pas excellent quand on considère qu'une fois l'histoire finie, il n'y a plus grand chose à faire. Par contre, je vous garantie que vous ne verrez vos heures de jeu pas passer.

- Jouissif au départ, onirique et poétique, on suit précisément les émotions que les créateurs veulent transmettre et cela fait du bien.
- Vos sentiments changent avec l'avancement dans le jeu au même titre que le récit du jeu et si, comme moi, vous rentrez entièrement dans le personnage, vous suivrez naturellement ses émotions.
- La fin du jeu est triste, vraiment triste. Tellement juste et poignante, elle retrace les différentes étapes du deuil et c'est narré de façon spectaculaire.
- Par contre, certains aspects du deuil sont largement mieux représenté que d'autres (je parle d'un point de vue psychologique, pas de gameplay ou de longueur ""d'actes"")
----- Déni : Impécable
----- Colère : Impécable
----- Marchandage : En deux parties, la prmière est surprenante de justesse là où, pour la seconde, le lien avec le deuil est beaucoup plus subtil et même en ayant fini le jeu, il est compliqué de voir le lien entre le temple et le marchandage pour qui n'est pas coutumier des étapes du deuil et de leurs aspirations.
----- Désespoir : Proche de la perfection
----- Acceptation : Trop court, trop rapide, j'aurais aimé en avoir davantage sur la dernière étape de la dépression car c'est tout de même celle où la personne s'en sort et il aurait été agréable que cela dure plus de cinq minutes.",1530376794,1530376794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I started out going ""Okay, this game is so saturated with Ico and Shadow of the Colossus that it's an irrefutable fact that it will be sad or uplifting (or sadlifting).  I'm prepared so I'll be fine.""

And somewhere along the line this went to ""Ok that's pretty sad"" to ""Ok that's utterly heartbreaking actually"" to ""WAIT NO NOT THIS, STOP, RIME PLEASE NO I HAVE A FAMILY.""  So, fair warning, if you possess empathy, Rime will get tears out of you.

A lot of people complain that the story was vague, but it in fact seems extremely straightforward to me.  If you're confused about something then you're probably taking it too literally.  Also, just look at the names of the levels (either at the end or on a walkthrough like I did) and the nature of the game itself should be made extremely clear to you literally at first glance.  (So on that note, fair warning that looking at a walkthrough is a kind of spoiler, but this one probably enhanced more than hurt my playthrough tbh.)

On that note, yeah, I had to use a walkthrough once or twice.  There are some little finicky points in the game where things just aren't that clear (e.g.; I got stuck in an area where an enemy kept blasting me off a ledge, which no one else seemed to experience, until I figured out that I had to pass by from MUCH closer to the enemy than the game had taught me was wise, but to be fair it had also taught that moving around just under this enemy was okay, so--YMMV).  I also struggled when the game got dark, because Enu (the kid) will usually stop and hang from a ledge but sometimes he apparently just says ""screw it"" and jumps.  This was only a mechanic in one or two areas though.

Otherwise, the graphics are beautiful, and I didn't struggle too much with the controls.  The keyboard support is definitely nice for people like me who're short on controllers, but there are a lot of areas where it's super clear it would be more fun with an analog stick, and camera control through the mouse is very much an acquired taste on this kind of game, so I'd definitely recommend a controller where possible.

Also, yeah it runs short (and if you're an Ueda fan then you're probably used to that sad inevitability), but there's a lot of replay value.  Collectibles carry over at the end of the game, so you can play at your own pace and not worry so much about missing out.  And the multiple levels are sprawling, with a lot of different tones, so in most of them it's very easy to get distracted from your goal by exploration.  I'm definitely looking forward to poking around again without having to worry about advancing.

So yeah I recommend it.  I don't know how to end this.  I'm gonna go rest my feelings now.",1530047218,1530047218,True,7,0,0.595532834529876709,0,True,False,False,False,,,

GAMEPLAY: i was wary when starting out because a lot of these adventure walking-simulator puzzle games seem to have beautiful artwork and assets, while the actual controls are...not so enjoyable. but this game? the camera is amazing. the hitboxes make sense. there were maybe two or three instances where the camera was annoying and caused me to miss a jump and/or fall, but those barely affected my overall experience. 

the attention to detail in this game is ASTOUNDING. i think the very first thing that let me know this was a story made with a lot of love in the first *two minutes* of opening the game, was how the walking animation changed when MC was in knee-deep water. you know when you're at the beach and you're trying to walk through the water but it's hard because water is like, actually really heavy? the animators and devs actually kept that in mind, and changed MCs walk cycle and speed to reflect that. such a tiny detail, but one that delighted me a lot. and that's just the very first one i noticed!

now for the story...

i won't spoil it, because it's genuinely unexpected enough that to witness it for yourself is something worth doing, but despite my own doubts about it that persisted up until literally the Very End of my playthrough, there IS  a story, and it IS absolutely incredible. it changes the way you think about the entire game -- and when i say the entire game, i mean the entire game; the main parts of it, and the collectibles as well!

tl;dr: excellent controls, heartwrenching story, and while i bought this game for the summer sale, it's more than worth the standard selling price. 9/10",1529917282,1529917282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Oyunun olumlu yanları da var ancak tavsiye ediyor muyum diye düşününce olumsuz yanları ağır basıyor.

Birincisi; Oyun bug dolu. Bug'la karşılaştığında oyuncunun son kaydedilen noktaya geri dönebilmesini sağlaması gereken ""Restart from last checkpoint"" seçeneği konmuş ama bu checkpoint'ler o kadar seyrek ki geri dödüğünüzde son 15-20 dk'yı tekrar oynamak zorunda kalıyorsunuz.

İkincisi; ciddi optimizasyon sorunları var.

  Üçüncü olarak da hikayeden bahsetmek istiyorum. Oyun size oyun boyunca hikaye adına inanılmaz fazla şey vaadediyor. Son ana kadar size daha diğerlerini açıklamadan merak edecek birbirinden alakasız şeyler vererek ""Acaba bunlar nereye bağlanacak"" diye merak ettirerek her an dikkatinizi diri tutuyor. Ancak bu oyun da bana aklırsa finali açısından bir ""The Witness"" vakası. Oyun, oyun boyu ""Nası yani?"", ""Bu ne şimdi?"", ""Bu ne alaka, dur bakalım ne çıkacak"" dedirterek oyuncunun beynini yakan abuk subuk şeyleri gösteren sanki o değilmiş gibi aşırı alakasız ve klişe bir sonla bitiyor. Bu bana artık ""Dear Esther yapınca olduydu bizde niye olmasın"" diyerek yapıverilen bir çeşit çakallık gibi geliyor. Özellikle son dönem indie oyunlarda çok sık yapılan, formülize hale geldiği için de sinir bozucu olmaya başlayan formül şu: Oyuncuya, oyunun sonunu sanki aşırı kapalı şekilde anlatıyormuş da o salaklığından anlamıyormuş hissi yaşatacak acayip soyut sinematikler göstererek, aslında hikayeyi hiçbir yere bağlamamak. Bağlayacak yer bulamamayı kurtarmak için zekice bir yol ve Dear Esther'in başarısının ardından birçok indie oyun yaratıcısı tarafından bu formül kullanılmaya başlandı. Ancak Dear Esther'de zaten dolu dolu bir edebi dil hazzı vardı ve gerçekte hikayenin ne olduğu önemsiz bir teferruat olarak kalıyordu. Tahmin etmeye çalışıp teoriler üretmek de keyif veriyordu. Tek kelime konuşmanın olmadığı bir oyun için bunu söyleyebilmek pek mümkün değil. Görsel olarak çok güzel olması, oyunu kurtaramıyor bana kalırsa. 




Karşılaştığım bazı bug'lar;
-Başlarda bir yerde karakterim duvarın içine girdi ve orada hapsoldu. Restart etmek zorunda kaldım

-Üstü açık yerlerde durduğunuzda size kuş saldırdığı, ya kapalı alana girmeniz ya da su altına dalmanız gereken bölümde, girdiğim kapalı bir mağarada kuş sanki açık alandaymışım gibi gaipten saldırabilmeye devam etti. Aynı yerde respawn olduğum için de dirildiğim anda tekrar saldırıyordu. Oyun burada sonsuz bir döngüye girdi. 

-Sonlarda yağmurlu karanlık bölümde karakterim bir kayanın üzerinde aşağı düşme animasyonunda havada takılı kaldı tüm komutlar devre dışı kaldı. Bu en son 2001 Harry Potter'ın ilk oyununda başıma gelmişti. Restart ettim 

-Bunun dışında oyun boyu Prince of Persia tarzı duvardaki edge'lerde tırmanma sekansları var. Bu PoP oyunlarında sevdiğim bir şeydi ancak bu oyunda maalesef bu kısımlar da bug dolu. Kamera açıları siz tırmanırken sürekli sapıtıyor. Bazen tırmanma sekansı bitip yere indiğinizde normale dönmesi gereken kamera açısı dönmüyor, karakterimle ekrandan çıkıp gittiğimde duvarı göstermeye devam ediyor. *Restart*",1525287734,1525371253,False,3,0,0.461573541164398193,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i] I'll be honest with you, when I first heard about this game, I wasn't sure what to make of it.

I'll be the first to let you know, ""RiME"" is not for everyone. The game doesn't tell you anything: you interpret the story in your own way, you aren't told where to go or how to get there. Some people might get frustrated by that. Me? I was so moved by the game that I couldn't care less. The game is visually breathtaking, emotional, fun, exciting, heartbreaking, and all-around excellent (It reminded me a lot of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The sound design is also incredible, and I can say without hesitation that the music really added to the experience as a whole.

如果这是一个推理游戏，那么还没有开局我就已经判断失败。男孩黝黑的皮肤是最直白的证据，何况那艘贯穿始终的帆船。我却胡乱猜测出西方传统民间故事里失落王子的背景，想着这是个被巫师诱骗的可怜王子通过破解诅咒唤醒失落的祖国，被诅咒的国王和皇后的故事。记忆碎片也是不断佐证我的错误猜测。

却未想到却是满盘皆输。人的记忆是经过伪装而呈现在人的大脑的，少年通往万物生灵最终归宿的这场旅行就像《卖火柴的小女孩》一样在冰冷和困意中自己送给自己最后的礼物。没有哪个少年不想畅游于古堡中探险，儿童文学中也经常有这种题材。死亡之旅也许就应该像古埃及人在亡灵书中所畅言的欢乐安详，在此祝愿游戏里的少年得到一个安徒生式的结局。

游戏记忆和现实交织在那艘令人悲伤的帆船上，父子二人记忆中的相互错位是游戏在表达：既是我失去了你，也是我失去了你。玩家承受了父子两人的两份失去，以及从手中滑落的红色披风。双重的无力感实在令人窒息。

The story was pretty gripping, the characters were all very emotive as you knew what they were feeling without them having to say a word, and  the mechanics were pretty unique. I bought this game a while ago placed it on the backlog. Had I played this the year it came out I'd be screaming GOTY CONTENDER.

Anyway if you liked games like 'The Witness' or 'The Talos Principle', this game is right up your alley although I didn't find the puzzles to be as mind-numbingly difficult.

The pace of the game for me personally was perfect. I walk up to a puzzle, don't understand it one bit. After some pondering and playtesting with the physics/mechanics the eureka moment hits and it all makes sense. I never felt like pulling my hair out.

If you like an immersive, well paced story, progressively harder puzzles with different mechanics for most, and an eye for the art style (It only gets more beautiful) GET THIS GAME :D",1521533908,1521533908,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gorgous graphics, amazing storyline, and great gameplay. The game is one of very few on steam that I absolutly love that has no violence in it whatsoever. While some darker areas on the map may scare small children, and certain mobs as well, overall it is a very great game I could recommend to anyone looking for something to sink their money into. However, without spoiling the game I will say this, the objects and objectives in the game are highly symbolic. I recommend AFTER completing the game to go look for a simpler explanation online as the game, espeacially the ending, is not very obvious in its meanings. This is also a very puzzle and story centric game, keep that in mind before purchasing if your looking for something faster paced, as this game is generally very slow, and mostly aims to invoke different emotions in the player.

As for the cons, there aren't very many. They are on the development side, but here they are in order from greatest complaints to least:

For one, Anti-Aliasing in this game is broken. I am running a Vega 56 card overclocked and I COULD NOT run SSAA even in 1080p medium settings. I was getting 20fps tops with horrible input lag. TXAA also has issues barley letting me hold on to 40-50 fps with some massive frame rate spikes dipping into the 20s. Honestly however, FXAA looks fine and seems to work great in this game. I was able to hold 60fps (as the max allowed in this game is 60fps for some reason) at 2k resolution max settings with FXAA on. I really wish the developers would fix this, but since this game is ported from console I can see why they would have issues like this.

Second, the parkour mechanics (at least on PC) can be frustrating at times. The main character you play has issues grabbing onto ledges you are supposed to climb or jump onto if you are already on another platform. Even if the distance is small and it is obvious that is where you need to go next. To make your life easier here is a TIP: While climbing be sure that your character is reaching out for the next platform BEFORE your make any jumps, this will tell you if he will make the jump or not without uneccesarily falling to his death.

Third, even without VSYNC, Freesync, Gsync, or whatever else you have, 60FPS is the max allowed in this game, I don't see why but that is just the way it is. Mabey it's for the physics engine or something but I doubt it. You really don't need more then 60fps in this game but I thought I would mention it.

Fourth: By far the most minor complaint, but it shows a small lack of polish with the port of this game to PC. MINOR SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!....... With that being said in certain spots in the game where you have to run from a mob (like in the above game pictures and preview section where you are running away from the bird) you character does not run straight across the bridge because of the camera angle. Because of this it is way to easy to fall off the bridge while running for your life. Its easy to fix this by just tapping the direction you need to go to compensate for the slight drag you have while trying to go straight but it needed to be mentioned so a dev can fix this small issue in an otherwise amazing game.

Overall: This game recieves 8/10 for what it is, and only loses the 2 points due to some issues with the port to PC. Keep in mind, I am a harsh critique. With that said, if you are on the fence, BUY THIS GAME!",1521481506,1521481506,True,1,0,0.526749014854431152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ma la storia che si dipana davanti al giocatore via via che prosegue e colleziona i giocattoli, gli emblemi e le serrature nascoste nei vari mondi, è molto diversa. 
La soundtrack è qualcosa di veramente pazzesco e la voce sarà un elemento importantissimo tanto nei puzzle quanto come elemento ricorrente nella storia. 
Se volete una vera sfida per quanto riguarda i puzzle, beh questo forse non è il gioco per voi, ma se siete collezionisti incalliti, vi darà spesso filo da torcere.

RiME è un gioiellino, consigliatissimo per chiunque voglia immergersi in una storia diversa dalle altre, come anche i nomi dei mondi suggeriscono. Era da parecchio che non mi emozionavo così e in mio parere merita un acquisto full price.
Davvero complimenti ai ragazzi della Tequila Softworks per questo piccolo pezzo di poesia videoludica.
Non darò ulteriori informazioni, quindi eccovi i miei pro, contro e voto finale.

PRO 
+ Atmosfere magiche e fantastiche, leggermente malinconiche riuscitissime
+ Soundtrack veramente emozionante
+ Personaggi credibili e storia eccelsamente raccontata 
+ Numerosi (ma non troppi) collezionabili, spesso nascosti in maniera veramente malvagia ma intelligente.
+ Possibilità (una volta finito) di rivivere i capitoli per collezionare tutti i trofei
+ Camera fluida, che potenzia i momenti topici lungo la storia e segue bene il personaggio
+ Level design interessante e quasi mai ripetitivo

CONTRO
- Sarebbe stato meglio, a gioco finito, permettere al giocatore di rivivere determinati momenti all'interno del capitolo, piuttosto che farlo ricominciare dal principio dello stesso
- Quando la camera si sposta, così fanno anche i comandi, quindi se si percorre un ponte ad esempio, e la camera si sposta per motivi cinematografci, il nostro personaggio andrà in diagonale piuttosto che orizzontale
- A volte è tedioso rivistare luoghi o tornare sui propri passi per la relativa lentezza del personaggio 
- Avrei inserito all'interno del gioco qualcosa per far capire al giocatore che dopo quel determinato punto, non sarebbe stato più possibile tornare indietro

Es kommt selten vor, dass ich ein Produkt als ""perfekt"" bewerten würde, aber RiME hat es aus meiner Sicht verdient:
Das Spiel bietet ca. zwei Tage lang ein spannendes Abenteuer, das nahezu gewaltfrei und damit auch für Kinder ab ca. 10 Jahren empfohlen ist. Aufgrund teilweise düsterer Passagen halte ich es für kleinere Kinder eher ungeeignet. (Die können z.B. ""Seasons after Fall"" spielen.) Kann der Protagonist, ein schiffbrüchiger Junge, im ersten Kapitel noch eine idyllische Insel recht ungezwungen und in Ruhe erkunden, so sind die späteren Level deutlich linearer aufgebaut, und es gilt stellenweise auch, Gefahren aus dem Weg zu gehen. Ein süßer Fuchs leitet einen durch den Großteil der Geschichte, aber wer nur ihm folgt, übersieht manch versteckte Wege...
Unterwegs kann der Junge durch Schlüssellöcher Fragmente einer (seiner?) Geschichte erfahren, aber ich finde, erst am Spielende erschließt sich älteren Spielern der tiefere Sinn.

Die Grafik ist, wie man Trailer und Screenshots entnehmen kann, zwar cartoonhaft, aber die Szenerien im Wechsel der Tageszeiten trotzdem so stimmungsvoll, dass ich als Hobbyfotograf häufig von der ""digitalen Kamera"" (Screenshot-Taste) Gebrauch gemacht habe, und sei es nur zum Einfangen eines kitschigen Sonnenuntergangs mit Ruinen. Über 500 Fotos und ""Selfies"" sind so entstanden. Immer wieder gibt es Räume oder Orte, da fiel mir so richtig die Kinnlade runter! Auch die eingestreuten animierten Sequenzen fügen sich nahtlos in das Spiel ein.

Neben der Grafik kann das Spiel zudem noch mit einem tollen Soundtrack punkten (im Handel erhältlich), und auch das Gameplay fand ich gut. Die von mir gespielte Version 1.0.4 ist nie abgestürzt und hatte keine nennenswerten Fehler. Auch das ein Pluspunkt. Es gibt kein ""Game Over"" und keine Sackgassen, aus denen man nur durch Levelneustart wieder herauskommt - stattdessen werden Fehler (etwa Fehlsprünge) verziehen und man bekommt schlicht eine neue Chance. Selten kommt es auf exakte Präzision oder Timing an. Das macht das Spiel auch recht frustarm. Die Puzzle sind selten schwer, und das Spiel lässt einen meist auch eindeutig wissen, was funktionieren soll und was nicht. Wer allerdings auf die Suche nach den ganzen Sammelobjekten geht, wird gute Augen benötigen. Manche sind leichter, andere schwieriger zu finden oder zu erreichen.

Wenn es etwas zu kritisieren gibt, dann ist das wohl die Armkraft des vielleicht 12-jährigen Protagonisten, die Profi-Freikletterer neidisch machen würde. Na ja, künstlerische Freiheit halt. Höhenangst hat er offenbar auch keine. ;-)

Wer sich ärgert, dass das Spiel nach vielleicht zwei Tagen schon vorbei ist, kann sich noch an die Suche nach (bzw. die Herausforderung von) den restlichen Errungenschaften machen ... irgendwas gibt es garantiert noch zu entdecken.",1521326554,1685738492,True,4,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,False,,,

well here you go.

[b]visuals: 10/10[/b] this is a bit subjective since you could dislike the artstyle though they absolutely nailed what they were going for and nothing feels out of place

[b]soundtrack: 8.5/10[/b] gets boring after long play sessions of time but fits this game really well most of the time

[b]gameplayy: 7/10[/b] smooth and solid, doesn't run very fast and kdoesn't have many cool moves. basic movement at its best

[b]polish: 9/10[/b] you can get sort of stuck on small invisible ledges, sometimes when you jump to grab a ledge you won't grab it and you'd have to try again, though nothing major like crashes or weird bugs. Very solid experience.

It's a really good game but that doesn't mean you'll like it.
The pace is fairly slow and it gets more fun when you've played for at least 45 minutes.
I don't think this game is worth it full price for the average gamer but if you consider games as art, go buy this because the environments always look and sound great!

Game similar to this one: ABZU (and journey of course but that's not on pc so it doesn't count ;) )

+ beautiful graphics: water, rocks, metal and other textures are all breathtaking. The color palette is also perfect.
+ ‎nice soundtrack
+ ‎not super long
+ ‎can be fun to play: climbing, swimming, exploration and puzzle solving

- framerate drops in certain areas even with specs above the recommended
- ‎few characters and no dialogue AT ALL. I personally prefer games with different characters, dialogues and interactions
- ‎puzzles were mostly too simple and repetitive. A lot of the time, I wouldn't even call them ""puzzles"". It's more like acting a script in a movie because you just go and do the obvious. Only a couple of them were fun for me.
- ‎I found the ghost-like figures too creepy
- ‎a map would have been very welcome, I felt lost a lot of the time after stage 1.
- ‎no manual save points... Sometimes you just can't keep playing anymore and you wish you could just save and leave it there.
- ‎my biggest complain: the story, the ""adventure"". First, it's way too vague for me. I hate stories were you have very little concrete information and are left wondering and theorising, absolutely hate them. I didn't expect this game to be like this and it totally is. Also, the story itself... Spoilers ahead: I was totally disappointed to see that this island was somehow not actually real and the quest, the adventure I thought I was living, was totally not like what I had imagined. I thought this would be a great adventure were we would end up saving the island somehow, that we would have a victorius and happy ending. But it turned out to be a vaguely defined tragedy. I don't play video games to get depressed or confused while theorising. I play to go on a wonderful and exciting adventure that leaves me feeling satisfied and happy in the end. Think Zelda. The problem is that you advertise the game like it's this great magical adventure, like something super exciting, when it turns out to be a sad and tragical story, not very exciting at all. You should hint at this in your description so that people like me don't end up disappointed.

Top notch aesthetics! There are few locations visually quite distinct from one another. And while I did prefer chapters 1 & 3 for their brighter palette, all of them painted a really nice atmosphere. 

The game features some puzzles too, but if you're following the main route, they are all quite easy and fairly obvious to figure out what needs to be done. The difficulty raises only if you decide to go for all the collectibles - many of them are tricky to obtain & hard to spot. Although there are way too many sets of objects to collect that don't serve any other purpose than collecting for the sake of collecting. Only few types were useful, like outfits, lullaby song parts (such a beautiful tune btw), or metaphorical story panels. But I can stand behind making the difficulty dynamic depending on how the player chooses to play :)

The story was vague and enigmatic most of the time, but when the reveal came at the end it turned out to be very emotional. I quite enjoyed the game overall.

Ça commence comme une caresse et se termine comme une claque.

La caresse, elle, vient de ce qu'il est beau. Pas d'une beauté superficielle, qui s'imagine que, pour plaire ou susciter le désir, il faut à tout prix se couvrir de fard. Un fard qui masquerait d'ailleurs l'essentiel, une manière de supercherie s'apparentant à un bel écrin vide. Non, [i][b]RiME[/b][/i] est d'une beauté simple, authentique, sans fioriture.

Une beauté libre, sincère, au sens où ce qu'elle montre est le reflet fidèle de ce qu'elle recèle. Une beauté qui ne craint pas que coule son maquillage, sous quelque déluge de pluie. Après tout, elle n'en porte aucun.

Seulement, la caresse finit tôt ou tard par se muer en claque. Oui, tôt ou tard, selon votre degré de perspicacité. Me concernant, ce fut tardif au possible. Peut-être parce qu'il m'a d'une certaine manière subjugué, de sorte que je suis passé à côté des indices qu'il avait pourtant semés sur ma route. Ou peut-être parce que, depuis toujours, en particulier en matière de jeu vidéo et de littérature, j'aime à me laisser surprendre. C'est plus fort que moi, que voulez-vous, j'incline par-dessus tout à fermer les yeux sur ce qui les crève, pour mieux reconstituer le fil de l'intrigue a posteriori. Mais ne vous méprenez pas ! la gifle en question ne résulte aucunement d'un vice caché ou de défauts qui prendraient le pas sur ses qualités. Non, cette gifle-là émane en réalité d'une prise de conscience aussi poignante qu'amère : sur le charmant visage de cette beauté simple, la pluie se mêle aux larmes.

Vous me permettrez de taire les détails, sous peine de vous gâcher la découverte. Pour me faire pardonner, je pourrais vous décrire la chose par le menu, avec des considérations d'ordre technique, dont certaines confinent au pinaillage. Des considérations du style ""[i]chargements longs, mais très rares[/i]"", ""[i]parkour pour ainsi dire téléphoné[/i]"", ""[i]quelques chutes de framerate[/i]"", ""[i]impression de liberté appréciable, qui cache en fait une aventure linéaire[/i]"", ""[i]narration muette, assez nébuleuse, reposant pour partie sur des collectibles très - trop ! - bien dissimulés[/i]"", ""[i]énigmes nombreuses, variées, très bien conçues[/i]"" ou ""[i]ambiance, notamment sonore, et direction artistique en général de haute volée[/i]"". Honnêtement, l'envie me manque d'autant plus qu'une analyse chirurgicale de cette beauté-là ne lui rendrait pas hommage.

Et puis, pour sa défense, l'aspect [i]parkour[/i] est secondaire. Il ne constitue pas le coeur du jeu, très loin de là : une vétille, donc. Vous noterez du reste que ce qualificatif ne figure pas parmi les tags du jeu ; à juste titre. Tout dépend sans doute des raisons qui vous auront poussé vers [i][b]RiME[/b][/i], mais sachez une chose : si le [i]parkour[/i] en fait partie, vous n'êtes assurément pas au bon endroit !

Enfin, j'ajouterais que vous incombe la responsabilité de rendre cette expérience non linéaire, tout comme il vous appartient d'élucider les grandes lignes de son histoire, autant que faire se peut. Vous vous devez de ne pas la parcourir en ligne droite. Vous vous devez de vous écarter des sentiers battus. Sans quoi cela reviendrait à juger de sa beauté sans lui avoir accordé le regard qu'elle mérite.

[u]EDIT[/u] : Est-il nécessaire de préciser que [i][b]RiME[/b][/i] compte, au nombre de ses influences, l'oeuvre d'un certain [b]Fumito Ueda[/b] ?

[h1]Verdict : 5/5 - Le sans-faute, à acheter les yeux fermés ! Et à jouer les yeux grand ouverts.[/h1]

Apparso come un fulmine a ciel sereno mentre guardavo il mio pannello di Nvidia, mi sono approcciato a questo gioco che avevo fugacemente visto un paio di volte tra le notizie, lasciandomi catturare dalle sue peculairità in poco tempo.

Ci troviamo a vestire i panni di un bambino, apparentemente naufragato su un isola tropicale, che deve riuscire a ritrovare un modo per tornare a casa superando i vari enigmi dell'isola, mentre una figura rossa incappucciata lo osserva sempre da lontano...

La prima cosa che mi ha colpito è stato l'impatto visivo.
Il design cartoonesco e i colori vividi sono elementi che saltano subito all'occhio del giocatore, risultando facilmente apprezzabili.
Questi elementi sono poi messi in ulteriore risalto dal level design delle varie zone, il quale oltre che nella struttura varierà anche nella palette di colori utilizzata, facendo trasparire da parte dell'autore una forte ispirazione artistica.

Questi e anche altri elementi (come la totale assenza di dialoghi in game o la bassa e calcolata presenza di nemici nel gioco) fanno percepire mentre si gioca una certa vicinanza ai titoli di Fumito Ueda come Ico, Shadow of the Colossus o The Last Guardian, e infatti anche questa è una storia che si racconta in silenzio, senza Npc simili a noi con cui interagire o parlare, con dettagli nascosti pensati apposta per coloro che sanno/vogliono osservare...

整部游戏的建筑风格美到令人窒息，可以看出来取景自爱琴海小镇与希腊风情，同时还有埃及的影子。解谜可以用简单二字形容，不能说简单好或不好，因为画面和配乐做的很赞足以弥补没什么存在感的解谜，画面独特和优美，偏卡通风格的3D，却看上去如此的自然和成熟。动听的BGM：BGM大多是小提琴、大提琴与钢琴的相互搭配，有很多不同的调子，可以听出来制作组在音乐这方面也下了不少功夫，接近尾声和结局多处激昂并且搭配感人剧情的配乐更是令本作再次升华了一个层次。

老少皆宜的艺术品游戏，除了欲言又止的剧情小孩子可能看不懂，从头到尾没有一句对白与旁白，却讲述了一个悲伤的故事:[h1]以下介绍含剧透：[/h1][spoiler]本游戏讲述了一名父亲大意在一次航海过程中失去了他的儿子，他的儿子不能接受自己死亡的事实一路寻找归属，然后和还活着的父亲紧紧相拥，最后化为乌有。玩家最后会控制他的父亲松开手上的红色披风让它飘向远方，相信也是松开他们父子彼此一直摇摇欲坠的、沉重的心。把握当下吧， 明天和意外，你永远不知道哪个会先来。[/spoiler]剧情蛮感人的，但是没玩到后面可能会一头雾水，如果看不懂剧情耐心玩下去就好，总比那些从头到尾都让人一头雾水的游戏要好。

rime讲了一个关于失去关于释怀的故事，告别了狐狸球球的温暖，小男孩才能继续走下去，放下对孩子的执念，爸爸才能重新开始生活。当红斗篷消逝在风里时忍不住泪目，这个世上有太多太多的无能为力，我们能做的只有释怀与放下，然而仅仅是释怀，已经是太难太难的事了——网易云热评

Opinie były różne, lecz w każdej z nich podkreślana była wyjątkowość tych produkcji. W końcu nadarzyła się okazja do zagrania w tytuł nawiązujący do wyżej wymienionych gier.
 
Jakby tu zacząć? Może jak zawsze od początku! RiME zostało wydane przez Grey Box, za co im serdecznie dziękuję. Początkowa gra ta miała być ekskluziwem na PS4. Sony na szczęście się rozmyśliło i zmieniono wydawcę, dzięki czemu mogłem zagrać na PC. Jest to moje drugie podejście do gry i powiem, że zrobiło na mnie..., ale o tym później.

Fabuła gry jest dość oszczędna i do tego wydzielana dość skąpo, co traktuję na plus, bo pozwalało to interpretować czy też domyślać się o co w niej chodzi. Na początku  dowiadujemy się, że kierujemy chłopcem na oko 10-letnim. No, i że jest rozbitkiem, bo cała historia rozpoczyna się na plaży, gdzie zostaje on wyrzucony przez morze. Teraz wypada nakreślić jaki cel będzie nam przyświecać. No właśnie... żaden.

 Idziemy przed siebie, gdzie nas nogi poniosą. Brzmi to trochę jak żart, lecz tak jest. Generalnie gra jest o stracie, pogodzeniu się z losem i akceptacji bądź nie, tego co życie ze sobą niesie. Uprzedzam jedynie, że jest to dramat, który może wycisnąć łzy, choć mniej wrażliwi mogą machnąć na to ręką. Wszystko zależy od tego czy wczujecie się w grę.

The story tho is good (atleast to me.) it made sense when the ending revealed and the environment also look good and beautiful but sometime it just too dark and sometime it just uninspired af.

The puzzle are super ez which is good for someone who just want to feel the environment this game made but for me I think it's super lazy, I mean it shown you some good puzzle and then use it over and over and then it made you feel great again with new puzzle and then they use it over and over and the loop continue..",1517381969,1517381969,False,4,1,0.404800593852996826,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The design of the world is beautiful, but in terms of render quality it's not really close to the top new games. The camera behaviour is also a bit irritating at times (although certainly not the worst I've seen).

I found the puzzles engaging but not particularly hard (once I'd worked out the mechanics of a new puzzle piece). If you are primarily interested in challenging logic puzzles, there are other games that will do that better. This is a more relaxed style of puzzle.

The story is not handed to you on a plate, and it's not clear what's going on until the end (and even then, there's a reasonable amount left to the player's interpretation). The ending packed a real emotional punch, though, and a lot of that comes from the subtle build up.

本作的探索解谜难度不算高，几乎不会因谜题卡关。题目没有特别惊世骇俗的创新之处，食物吸引，声控，视觉偏差等已经见惯不惊。全程无语言文字是一个亮点，不过游戏中很好地设置了指引和「标杆题目」，不会出现道具不知该怎么用的情况。RiME同时还提供了多套搜集要素，集全的话对于理解游戏的故事背景和世界观大有帮助，没有的话也不影响最后通关时理解剧情。如果完全不在意搜集的话，游戏流程倒是蛮直接的，二周目对着攻略补全落下的少许搜集物时，从头通关甚至不需要两个小时。

但是如果在意搜集要素的话，大范围跑动搜刮时会抱怨主角这小短腿跑步太慢，还时不时撞墙带来手柄一阵剧烈颤抖。与解谜相类似，物品的搜集方面也没有特别烧脑解题困难之处，大多属于你顺路留意到「这里有个缝」「那儿可以爬」「这是个可疑的死胡同」等。于是，如果稍微一走神，就错过了，而且多数没法回头，只能等通关后再单独选取五章之一进行补完，游戏时长10+小时大多拜其所赐。由于隐藏要素在「地点」，游戏中自然就有了一批设置得实在丧心病狂的物品，比如[spoiler]循环场景那俩碎片[/spoiler]，虽然有规律，但不看攻略直接发现这个的我还是蛮佩服的……

至于优化方面，尽管看起来不似发售时段评论中的那般惨烈，但风扇呼呼呼响是避免不了了。此外顿卡依然存在，不过本作对时机的容错性比较高所以还好。崩溃倒只出现了两次，所以还算幸运？不过看报道本作的Switch版还是掉帧异常惨烈且移植外包方表示完全不知所措，这只能说加油吧。

最后是剧情方面，RiME从头到尾握住了讲故事的节奏，保持了足够的耐心和克制，配上绝佳的BGM引导着玩家的情绪，没有出现浮躁的「故事的坑填不住」的烂尾，这个对于小制作的开放式解谜游戏来说殊为难得。游戏的世界观维持了相当一段的隐晦。游戏中我会对陆续出现的各种超自然的能力好奇，引路而追不上的红衣长者，狐狸，歌声，透视镜，[spoiler]一个能操纵时间的红衣男孩[/spoiler]，它们都代表着什么？而随着搜集到玩具和锁孔，其中透出来的信息碎片让我还是怀疑是[spoiler]王子归城复仇记[/spoiler]。[spoiler]而最后三四间章摧毁了之前的假设[/spoiler]，直到最后一章一切豁然开朗。应该来说虽然有反转，但是[spoiler]没有达到很强烈的冲击[/spoiler]。对于这个故事的结尾，反而应该和男主一样，缓缓而平静地接受了这一切。Let it go。

总体评价：B+

+ 无文字语言下很好的教学指导，游戏过程流畅
+ 节奏把控良好的精心安排的世界观与剧情，适宜在温暖的午后就把它通关了吧

It's a very pretty game and you can tell the developers really put a lot into it.  It's another ""mysterious boy wakes up and must run through the world solving puzzles in order to contine proceeding through the world"" games.  Its okay...it's fun in some parts, over-long in others.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.  By the end, I was wondering when it was going to end since it started to drag on and on. 

So here's the biggest issue...It wants to be Ico, but the problem is, the character you play is so generic.  In Ico, the boy stumbles around in a way that gives him character.  He has a girl to interact with and you get to care about him because he has personality in his body language and the way he interacts with her.  In Rime, you're just some kid who shouts at things a lot.  There's no emotion, and even when there is a part where he is crying, it still doesn't come off very realistic...now we just have a generic character who is crying.  Even worse is the lovely score hits you over the head literally trying to violently pull some feelings out of you, but it feels so cloying, it just comes off as ""meh.""

The end, well, I get it...and it was probably the only part that gave me a few goosebumps, but it's a little too Deus Ex Machina for me.  It's lazy.  I'd rather have a game like The Witness not even pretend to have a story but be somewhat entertaining, then the ending here that felt a little too tacked on.  Like they got to the end and went, ""Oh, we really do need to find some time to make up a reason why the player is doing all these things...""

Anyways, I recommend it because it is pretty, has a nice soundtrack and it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of evenings.  Just don't expect to remember it for long when you're done.",1516506301,1516506397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игру делали долго и качественно. Сразу видны и источники вдохновения, первое это конечно Journey, но тут много всего (Ico, The Legend of Zelda, работы Миядзаки). В одном моменте я даже увидел прямой референс на Limbo. Все что связано с визуальной частью и музыкой просто потрясающе, проделана поистине колоссальная работа. Не знаю во сколько обошелся production, но после такого сразу отпадают вопросы о, как мне казалось, немного завышенном ценнике на игру. Геймплей относительно простой, состоит в решение несложных пазлов и эксплоринге уровня на поиск разных (необязательных для сбора) вещей. Карабкаться по уступам, бегать, прыгать и плавать придется много. Пазлы кстати сделаны очень креативно и красиво. Игра местами трогает, здесь очень милые сцены, а концовка уж точно заставит пустить слезу более менее чувственного человека. После прохождения таких игр как RiME у меня на душе всегда остается что-то теплое. Возможно гордость за таких людей как TequilaWorks, которые дарят нам маленькие шедевры и надежда, что в индустрии дела все еще идут хорошо.

Из проблем стоит отметить плохую оптимизацию, в игре часто проседает FPS в определенных местах, независимо от того насколько мощная у вас видеокарта. А вот багов не было замечено ни одного.

Определенно, одна из лучших игр прошлого года. Если вам нравятся такие игры как Journey, ABZU рекомендую к прохождению.",1516470171,1516470171,True,2,0,0.556840062141418457,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I got this game as a Xmas' gift from a friend. Let's roll:

[b]TLDR version[/b]

buy this game if:

+ you love games that visually and emotionally are able to stimulate 
+ you like story driven games with a [u]side puzzle component[/u]
+ you fancy games that show different scenarios and setups quite often

don't buy this game if:

- you don't have a ""decent"" / above ""mid-tier"" pc
- you believe that spending 40$ on a 5 hour game might be too much
- you love games heavily based on puzzles

Verdict 8/10, well done, deep (expensive too) and meaningful gaming experience 
Time required to complete the main game : 5 hours
Time required to 100% the game: 8-10 hours 

[b]Detailed version[/b]

A quick summary of the most important subjects:

1- [b]The price tag[/b] can be discouraging and intimidating. The game hasn't any replayability value: replaying the story chapters will only grant you the chance to grab those collectibles you'll be needing for the real ending. Now... im not a business or budgeting manager, so i don't know why this price tag has been decided. I'm not saying that this title doesn't deserve its money, just keep in mind that for 40$ you can get many good indie titles at the same time rather then getting only this gorgeous, deep and terrific looking one that will last only for 5 hours.

2- [b] The pacing and story telling is extremely well structured [/b] as the game will start off with a sunny seaside landscapes, ruled by a peaceful environment and will keep changing throughout the whole game by switching themes, songs, enemies and situations, while being able to be and to seem fresh and never repetitive through the whole experience, which will be heavily puzzle based at the start and will get more and more platforming centered after.

3- [b] Frame drops aside, the game is really polished and meaningful [/b] as shown here:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275327542

just to give you an example, when the young protagonist has to climb a slope, has to lean, sit down or just performing physical activity...he's actually realistic as his moves are properly represented. 
You will his see his legs moving accordingly and his whole body reacting naturally. Many puzzles and rooms are based on ""dignity and magnificence"" so you'll always have a chance to admire the landscapes, secrets and clearing out the game areas without any abrupt shifts or pauses (unlike Hob, just to give you an example).

TO SUM UP:

Play this game if you want to be enchanted by a gorgeous, expensive and short puzzle - story driven game. If you're looking for a long puzzle game only, you might have to look for something else.

It looked gorgeous and relaxing - just the type of game I love to play. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.

Pros:
-Absolutely stunning.
-The soundtrack is fantastic.
-Puzzles aren't too difficult (definitely don't overthink them or you will get stuck).
-Super interesting visuals and ideas.

Meh
-The story is simple but you don't really understand much until the very end. Once the ending was revealed, a lot of the gameplay mechanics and symbolism really made sense, but I would have liked to have understood a bit more as I went through the game. Going OH repeatedly at the end of the game took away from the story. This is the type of game you need to replay to get the full value of the story/symbolism.
-Controller controls are a bit meh.
-Maneuvering the boy can get a little annoying - you have to hit some things just right or you have to start all over.
-The game is essentially a jumping/parkour simulator. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is not what I wanted out of a game, so I got super bored quickly. Especially when I kept missing jumps and had to start all over.

Cons
-The camera is horrible. It locks in certain areas, making it impossible to look around and see where you need to go. Other times it positions itself weirdly and the angles make it seem like you're closer to something than you really are, resulting in missed jumps.
-Sometimes it is really hard to figure out where you need to go/what you need to do. The level layout is a bit wonky. It allows for a lot of exploration if you're into that kind of thing, but it can become a maze-like convoluted mess to those who just want to run through the game.

I really, really, really wanted to adore this game. And in some respects I do. It is stunningly beautiful. The soundtrack really adds to the atmosphere. The story is emotional and interesting. Yet, at the same time, the game is boring. The first chapter consists of running around 'collecting' a few things. The second chapter consists of running from spot to spot while being chased. The third chapter is by far the absolute best - the puzzles are great, the gameplay mechanics are wonderful, and the story bits are fantastic. Then the fourth chapter is basically a repeat of the first chapter but with rain. I think, overall, I was just disappointed that the game wasn't what I expected. I wanted a super compelling story game with puzzle mechanics. Instead I got a jumping simulator with a story that doesn't really make sense until the very end. Nothing that continuously compelled me to continue playing.

A playthrough of just the story will take you about 5 hours. Collecting all the things and achievements might take you around 10 hours. You will likely be super bored.

The Spanish team Tequila Works, known for Deadlight (2012), began working on it in 2010 with the temporary title of Echoes of Siren; it should have been an action RPG with isometric view, crafting and survival mechanics, building of fortifications, strategic battles, exploration. Microsoft initially supported the project but later rejected it; the ball passed into the hands of Sony, which made it an exclusive for Playstation, until in 2016 Tequila Works repurchased the rights to distribute it on all platforms. Meanwhile, the concept of the game was completely transformed; the title became RiME, which I think it’s for Rest in MEmory and alludes to the meaning of the whole adventure that I leave you to unveil: this review is spoiler free.

It is a third-person 3D adventure characterized by a pleasant cartoon-style cell shading graphics; it is set on a mysterious and fascinating island that offers a great variety of breathtaking scenery. You impersonate a child with a red cape that is shipwrecked on the island and wakes up on the seashore; the starting scene is reminiscent of the final scene of ICO, one of RiME’s inspirational sources; other sources of inspiration are certainly The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002), Journey (2012) and The Last Guardian (2016). From the beginning you are captured by the magical atmosphere of the island, and stimulated to thoroughly explore it for understanding its many mysteries. Sceneries offer majestic architectures that remind of the ones of ICO and The Last Guardian and therefore refer to the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio De Chirico and in part also to some visions of Salvator Dali. A certain spiritual, mystical, and ancestral aura is strengthened by the rapid cycling of day and night, with effects of light and color enchanting eyes and spirit. If you have a romantic and sensitive soul, I advise you to play immersed in the quiet of the night to get the maximum enjoyment.

Main components of gameplay are initially exploration and contemplation; later on, environmental puzzles prevail. Puzzles make use of the alienating architectural perspectives and of light and shadow effects; they are well-designed and help to keep high the enigmatic and mystical atmosphere of the experience. Their locations are full of symbols that recall the unconscious, the past and the memory; they are not too difficult, do not require particular skills. Some of them are cooperative and have to be solved with the help of your companions; yes, you are not alone on the island: a little fox will be your guide spirit, and a strange automata, a sort of Wheatley from Portal 2 but bigger and on iron stilts, will lead you towards the end of your journey.

Gameplay will be sometime interrupted by enigmatic cut scenes concerning child’s past; they help to keep attention high and feed the desire to go on and understand the meaning of the experience. Aura of mystery is strengthened by frequent and suggestive encounters with a black and faceless man wrapped in a red cloth. Pace is well calibrated thanks to some moments of action where you have to face a few threats; in particular a big prehistoric bird that will give you a long hard time, and some strange hooded beings, a sort of dark priests who fear the light. Challenge is really minimal, and it is right for a game that focuses on contemplation; in any case you do not run the risk of dying: if you happen to fall from a ravine or get caught by the prehistoric bird or the dark priests, by magic you would start the game from the previous checkpoint, just a bit confused and bruised, just like in The Last Guardian.

And now we come to the less successful aspect of the game: narration.....

Рыдала как последняя маленькая лодочка для эвакуации при кораблекрушении. Серьёзно. Человек я впечатлительный, ибо сначала пришла в восторг от саунда, красивых видов, ярких красок (видимо, чтобы мне прийти в восторг много не нужно) а потом всё сменилось озадаченностью и затем грустью. 
Сюжет, видимо, типичный для жанра бродилок - ходишь, ищешь, разгадываешь и постигаешь какую-то историю. Играем мы за посона попавшего на чудный остров после шторма. Остров этот напоминает своей скалистостью острова средиземноморья. Мы исследуем руины некогда богатого королевства архетиктура которого больше похожа на смесь греческой, инкской и майя. Вокруг бегает свинина, растут апельсины шикарных размеров, греет солнышко, птички летают...в общем красота. Саунд не раздражает а даже наоборот всячески соответствует происходящему в игре. Мелодично и в то же время грустно. 
Единственное что меня заставило проораться - это камера и управление. Камера жутко вымораживала когда переходила из режима третьего лица в какой-то статичный режим и посана нужно было направлять бежать уже по-другому.

Some of the puzzles are really cool conceptually - I love some of the light amd shadow puzzles in particular - but they're almost never confusing or frustrating. Overall, this was a really artistically resonant experience. The ending isn't exactly surprising, but it was nicely done.

That said, there are a few moments where I thought the game lacked polish. Some of the climbing segments twist the camera at odd angles where the controls stop being predictable, and it becomes difficult to orient the character for a jump to another ledge. Some of the scenes are very visually dark, which can be difficult to look at, let alone complete things in (thankfully, the puzzles are all pretty simple). The art style is also so beautiful, especially as evidenced in the first and third levels, that it's a shame how often the game goes dark and dim.

 progress) — and the guidance of a helpful fox (cute, yes / helpful not so much)—you must explore (climb, jump, push and puzzle) the enigmatic island, reach the tower's peak (not because there is a reason to do so, it is just the only thing to do), and unlock its closely guarded secrets (i think the game contains more optional collectables than enything else)

Потрясающая природа, загадочные руины, животный мир и конечно же огромное количество головоломок ждут нас. В игре прекрасный визуальный стиль и музыкальное сопровождение, головоломки не напрягающие и интуитивно понятны, для любителей исследования разработчики на территории всего острова расставили коллекционные предметы и придумали много интересных достижений. По факту перед нами красивая и немного грустная сказка, конечно же, со своими минусами. Критичных тут два: 

- Сложность: Её здесь практически нет. За всё прохождение я не увидел ни одной загадки, которая потребовала хотя бы 10 минут на своё решение. От вас требуется только внимательность. Мозг включать нужно исключительно в последней главе и то минуты на 4. 

- Управление выполненное топорно. 

Итог: Не напрягающий пазл примерно на 5-6 часов. Естественно без выполнения достижений.

The game not only suffers from performance issues, but is also quite short, and aside from catching up on collectibles offers almost no replay value.

RiME é uma obra de arte.[/h1]

Sabe aquele jogo que você joga em um final de tarde no feriadão e que depois de um tempo nem lembra que jogou? Pois é, RiME [b]não[/b] é um desses jogos. Apesar de possuir uma história simples, ela consegue te conquistar por ser emocionante e marcante, além disso, a forma que ela é contada é admirável, praticamente todos os elementos artísticos do jogo se encaixam perfeitamente e tornam a experiência ainda melhor.

A sinopse do jogo é a seguinte... Você acorda em uma praia de uma ilha misteriosa sem nenhuma explicação aparente, a partir daí o objetivo é explorar o local e descobrir quem é você, que ilha é essa e o que está acontecendo, o game abusa do mistério e praticamente te obriga a explorar bastante, enfim, a curiosidade que ele te proporciona em relação ao enredo faz parte da experiência e acredito que ir além dessa pequena descrição seria cometer um baita pecado com quem pretende jogá-lo, pois como eu disse, a história é simples.

O game bebeu de uma fonte muito rica, pois se inspirou em jogos como LIMBO, INSIDE, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons e principalmente nas obras de Fumito Ueda (Ico, Shadow of the Colossus e The Last Guardian), jogos que conseguem facilmente encantar o jogador através de seus visuais e mecânicas minimalistas, sem falar na facilidade que esses jogos têm em contar uma história de maneira satisfatória, mesmo não possuindo interface (HUD), barra de vida, skills (habilidades), textos e outros.

— ''Hááá!'' — Além da maravilhosa trilha sonora e dos efeitos sonoros de qualidade absurda isso é tudo o que você ouvirá, aliás, é assim que grande parte dos quebra-cabeças do jogo funcionam... o menino grita ou cantarola para ativar certos mecanismos e avançar pelos cenários, destravar portas, ativar recursos, liberar objetos necessários, entre outros também existem os puzzles mais ''clássicos'', aqueles relacionados a mover objetos e mecanismos. Na minha humilde opinião nenhum dos puzzles apresentados é desafiador ou inovador, porém, acredito que isso tenha acrescentado positivamente para a casualidade da obra, talvez isso seja um ponto negativo para os que buscam por um desafio mais complexo, para mim não foi.

Balde de tinta, mistura de cores, explosão de êxtase e... arte! É o que o jogo parece, uma linda pintura feita com as mãos. Sério, o contraste que os gráficos e o visual proporcionam é deslumbrante, o azul intenso do mar, o branco das construções e o verde da vegetação se mesclam de maneira esplêndida, é até difícil descrever. Apesar das cores serem muito vibrantes, ele não é o tipo de jogo que depois de certo tempo incomoda quem está jogando (ao contrário da falta de saturação que [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/corvinho/recommended/360430]MAFIA III[/url] apresenta ou do excesso de saturação que Battlefield 4 possui). Há somente um ponto negativo que eu gostaria de comentar sobre o visual, o fato de alguns cenários serem muito escuros, escuros mesmo, escuros ao ponto de você nem mesmo saber para onde está indo, creio que isso tenha sido uma escolha pessoal dos desenvolvedores, mas depois de algum tempo jogando percebi certa falta de sintonia entre os trechos iniciais e os finas, isso poderia ter sido facilmente corrigido se aprimorassem o sistema de iluminação dos cenários, ou até mesmo se alterassem as cores das texturas (de preto para branco), enfim, apenas um detalhe pessoal que achei válido mencionar.

Infelizmente nem tudo é perfeito, a versão para computador deste game possui vários problemas e mesmo após inúmeras atualizações de correção o jogo ainda conta com muitos problemas técnicos e isso é desanimador...
[list]
[*][b]Desempenho:[/b] A primeira vez que adquiri o game ele estava injogável, literalmente, pois o desempenho era ridículo, simplesmente não ''rodava'', foi então que efetuei o reembolso. Agora, depois de muitos tempo, grande parte dos problemas de otimização foram resolvidos, entretanto, ainda existem trechos (principalmente em locais fechados) em que o desempenho cai para a metade e se mantém inconstante mesmo em uma máquina de última geração, confira o vídeo abaixo;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyHDlIU_hA
[*][b]Crashes:[/b] Nas 16.5 horas jogadas o game fechou sozinho duas vezes, como eu estava monitorando o desempenho da máquina posso afirmar definitivamente que não foi problema no hardware;
[*][b]Problemas gráficos:[/b] Não cheguei a notar delays de renderização, porém, pude notar paredes desaparecendo e reaparecendo em diversas situações;
[*][b]Jogabilidade:[/b] A movimentação do personagem em determinados momentos me irritou e prejudicou meu jogo, por exemplo, ao executar um pulo de uma plataforma para outra o boneco errar o local por falta de precisão, isso me lembrou um pouco Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, por causa da velocidade em que o personagem anda;
[*][b]Outros bugs:[/b] Além do desempenho, esses foram os problemas mais sérios que tive. Ao cair ou pular de um local meu personagem simplesmente travou no ar e tive que voltar o checkpoint, isso aconteceu cinco vezes e foi extremamente frustrante. Até fiz uma gravação do ocorrido, segue vídeo abaixo.

[/list]

[b]Conclusão:[/b] Depois que terminei de jogá-lo e em meio a uma profunda reflexão sobre o sentido da vida foi que decidi recomendá-lo, mesmo após os vários problemas técnicos que encontrei. Penso que, se um jogo conseguiu me fazer ''parar de viver'' para refletir sobre algo assim, definitivamente ele merece a recomendação, mesmo que não seja a full price... RiME é essencial para os amantes dos jogos do mestre Fumito Ueda, um jogo artisticamente encantador, visualmente indescritível, agradável de se jogar e com certeza agradará jogadores que buscam jogos de puzzle casuais, ricos em narrativa, ambientação, visuais, imersão e trilha sonora, mas infelizmente ainda apresenta muitos problemas técnicos que podem degradar sua experiência, por isso talvez seja melhor comprá-lo somente com um bom desconto (talvez algo entre 40-50% dependendo da situação e do jogador).

Just as Hob and other games, RiME does not tell you the story by dialogue or text, but instead it tells you by visual queues or by soundtrack, ultimately revealing the whole story at the end. Its hard to describe without spoiling but I will say this, you wont expect the ending. I enjoy obscure story telling and RiME did a good job at it. 

Visually, RiME looks incredible. You will progress through lots of varied zones, from sunny beatiful islands, to dark caverns. Whats great about the levels is that every single one is tied to the story and once you finish it, you'll understand in what way. Theres also a time of day in the first map which was fantastic. 

Gameplay basically consists of platforming and puzzle solving. All are incredibly easy and straightforward. I would've enjoyed a bit of a challenge though. Still, it never gets dull and it always feels cool. 

Soundtrack, as with everything else in the game is tied to the story as well. The more you progress the soundtrack shifts its tone. The songs are well made and arguably touching. 

Overall, what I was expecting to be just an okay adventure game, turned out to be a really great experience. Highly recommended 8.5/10.",1514846069,1514846122,True,2,0,0.422956675291061401,0,False,False,False,False,,,

La historia me ha dejado impactado ya que en de primera mano puede parecer una cosa muy distinta de la que al final es. Tiene momentos super tiernos y emotivos que te hará poner los ojos humedos, por así decirlo.

Los puzles si que es cierto que no suponen ningún reto, alguno más enrebuscado tardarás máximo 10 minutos en resolverlo, pero la verdad es que agradezco que no hayan hecho los puzles complejos ya que considero que se romperia el ritmo del juego y, Rime busca explicarte una historia no hacerte comerte la cabeza para seguir avanzando. Su duración me parece la ideal para este formato de juego, ya que no se hace pesado en ningún momento y tampoco te quedas con ganas de más, simplemente, satisfecho y contento por el producto (por lo menos por mi parte).

The music is touching and simply beautiful to the ears, this is a soundtrack I could listen to outside the game as well.

I'm a slow gamer, that likes to explore, so on my first playthrough it took about 5-6 hours to complete, and in total 13,5 hours to 100%.

RiME builds a beautiful world with stunning cel-shaded style artwork and a soaring soundtrack, and entices you with early ideas about where things might go. But then, after a memorable area of hide-and-seek (like Limbo's spider), the plot gets lost. Mechanics that are introduced get a little bit of iteration and then are never used again.

You're supposed to be climbing a tower, but then randomly you'll just be in some other area entirely. One part has a groundhog day-esque section, then in another you're really just following some magic robots. The forest area was a confused mess, with no clear goal. Neither does the rainy area have a sense of place - it's just an arena to run around and solve four simplistic platforming puzzles. Where is it? Is it on top of the tower? It looks too big to be there. If these were meant to be inside the tower, it sure didn't feel like it. If these were meant to be around the tower, the tower should have been there in the background as a reminder of where we were and what our main goal is.

The game tries to give a sense of emotional weight to its narrative, but it doesn't spend enough time developing it. The fox for example, you bring it into being at the start and then it just acts as a guide of where to go. You don't really interact with it further, and then it rushes through its beats at the end. The nameless spirits are sometimes scared, then they're dangerous, then they're indifferent. Sometimes the soundtrack perfectly picks up the pace and setting, other times it's curiously absent.

With a better sense of progression of the tower, more interaction with the few characters so that their stories carried more weight, it could be greatly improved. It's an enjoyable experience, maybe a 6.5/10.

There, I liked a game on my own merit, it's not impossible. It's also not impossible for me to like a game despite being biased against it.

I bought the game after having only seen a few bright, colorful, and cheerful advertisements about this kid solving puzzles and chasing after a spirit fox. I did not sign up for a depressing story about a family death, finding graves and ghosts, and overall the plot/story being representative of the cycle of grief. Especially when one of the achievements hints that the fox might ""die"" too.

I find myself a simple person. I like amazing graphics, exploration, feeling successful, and solving puzzles or otherwise feeling witty and special. I, having had family deaths in my history, do not like stories where a person or animal you become attached to passes away. I do not like admitting that the cycle of grief exists or that I have problems accepting the past. I especially didn't like the symmetry between my mom passing away and the scene witnessed through the keyhole.

Still, I like this game. It throws trials at you that may require some poking at times, but are simple enough to enjoy the scenery. I love the way you move through the water, considering few games realize how difficult it can be to be partially in the water.There's also the way the grief cycle is represented; it hit the feels. The biggest puzzle is the metaphors presented, not the puzzles themselves. There's the story you read on Wikipedia and then the alternate stories within RiMe. I'd love to talk about it more, but I'm also trying to be vague and let you figure it out yourself.

I recommend looking into it; the puzzles aren't as tough to solve as those presented in The Legend of Zelda, but it's got a way more complex story than rescuing a princess from a tyrant.

The symbolism and foreshadowing that are almost ubiquitous throughout the game have led to countless ""oh FUCK that's what that meant"" moments for me, which is always a great feeling. 

The soundtrack is probably one of the best I've heard in a very long time, such that I threw literally all of my money at that shit and it'll be the only I listen to while I starve because all my money went into buying hundreds of copies of the soundtrack. Worth it. 

In terms of gameplay and difficulty, RiME is very forgiving, which is great for those who prefer to focus on things like story and exploration instead of aggravating precision platforming. In that same vein, the puzzles are relatively easy -- I was never stumped for more than 10 minutes on any one puzzle -- but they were still fun and satisfying nonetheless.

It also goes without saying that the graphics and art style are stunning; it's very easy to sit at the top of a tower overlooking the ocean for ten minutes because that shit is gorgeous as FUCK.

Весёлые и грустные, светлые и добрые, порою странные, иногда немного страшные, но неизбежно погружающие с головой в мир фантазии и волшебства. Однако годы стремительно бегут, подгоняемые ветром перемен и непрерывным потоком времени, навечно меняя всё вокруг и не щадя никого. И вот, в какой то миг, затерявшись среди мирской суеты, ты осознаёшь, что уже не веришь в чудеса и смотришь на мир серыми глазами прагматика, принимая весь холод и суровость мироздания. Но всё же где-то в глубине твоего сердца всё ещё живёт тот ребёнок, которому по-прежнему хочется света и тепла. А сказки, возможно, есть самая прекрасная форма эскапизма, радужный уголок покоя и чистоты, раскрывающий тебе свои объятья, готовый приласкать заблудшее дитя и пробудить его от долгого сна.

RiME зовёт нас в увлекательное путешествие, полное тайн и загадок, приключений и опасностей, неизбежно встречающихся на пути любого первооткрывателя. Пролетая сквозь ветер и грозы, лицезря весь гнев Посейдона в рядах вздымающихся волн, мы оказываемся на неведомых берегах вместе с маленьким мальчиком - главным героем игры. В ясном синем небе кричат чайки - вечные предвестники суши, крохотные крабы ползают у побережья, ветер тихо покачивает кроны деревьев, а в лазурных водах моря плавают рыбы и медузы. Прекрасная умиротворяющая идиллия, словно бы призывающая забыть о страшном шторме. 

Но кто же наш юный герой?  Зачем судьба забросила его в эти прекрасные края? И словно гигантский исполин, маня, зазывая к себе, в небе высится таинственная белая башня с отверстием в виде замочной скважины. Возможно за ней и кроются столь желанные ответы?

У Tequila Works получилось замечательное, яркое и разнообразное приключение. Гармоничный симбиоз цвета, музыки и игровых механик, подобно неистовому порыву ветра, подхватывает вас и несёт вперёд по полотну истории. Пылающие жаром пустоши, подводные глубины, призрачный свет кристаллов в недрах пещер, царство зелени и край вечного дождя... Каждая локация запоминается, имеет своё настроение и располагает к исследованию. Однако игра не любит подсказывать, целиком и полностью полагаясь на смекалку игрока. Здешние головоломки в меру сложны и прекрасно чередуются с платформенными этапами. Магические шары, меняющие день с ночью, уступают место пряткам от гигантской птицы, а волшебные сферы, светом своим разгоняющие порождения тьмы, предваряют сотворение жизни из камня и металла. 

И всё же не смотря на все чудеса и красоты, игру пропитывает лёгкий, едва ощутимый налёт печали, тревожное предчувствие, тонкими штрихами передаваемое через детали окружения. Ответы на тайны становятся всё ближе, яркие краски заменяют более тёмные тона, а нотки меланхолии звучат всё чаще и отчётливей, исполняемые незримым оркестром. Мантия волшебства спадает и рассыпается на мириады сияющих осколков. А за ней оказывается подлинная человеческая драма, история о жизни и смерти, ода вечной любви, ранящая в самое сердце, и памятник людям, познавшим всю боль утраты. 

Но за любой, даже самой сильной болью, следует катарсис, гнев со временем переходит в смирение, а тьма неизменно сменяется светом. Всё это лишь часть бесконечного и столь прекрасного цикла, именуемого ЖИЗНЬЮ...

I don't have a particularly good GPU, but even on lowest graphics settings I'm getting ~5-10 FPS in some areas with this game (15-20 in others, depending on ""visible"" detail) whereas with other games it's been ~20-30FPS.  Apparently this has been a long-standing issue even after the removal of Denuvo, yet nothing appears to have been done about it.

Update: I managed to power through it.  This game's atmosphere was the only thing stringing me along.
At the end, I was... mind blown, to say the least!  RiME is an amazing adventure, but in the end, [i]es tan triste![/i]  Like Life Is Strange, the writers had the courage to embrace sadness.

...and, well, I might as well bring out the pros & cons:

++10/10 Mediterranean atmosphere and gorgeous music that will surely draw you in if nothing else.  It's very much like The Witness, but with the dreaminess of TRI (actually dreamier than that).
+Captivating story à la Journey, told through adventure and panels
+Good puzzles (nothing hardcore though)
+Surreal (reminded me slightly of NaissanceE, or perhaps Antichamber)
+Quick death respawn

-Controls when platforming feel a bit weird and counterintuitive, as Jim Sterling has mentioned in his review.
-Camera movements in these same areas (and a few others) were likewise wonky.  Sometimes I just wanted to look around.

---Graphics and framerate issues, as mentioned above.  In fact, I was [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/493200/discussions/0/1621724915787261571/]almost[/url] about to refund this game!

Partendo dal presupposto che con la mia GTX 960 riesco a far girare DOOM a impostazioni Alte (non Ultra) tenedo una temperatura di massimo 73-74 gradi mantenendo anche un massimo di 75 FPS con drop fino a 58, non mi aspettavo che RiME (mettendo tutto alle impostazioni minime) mi avrebbe dato problemi dato i requisiti minimi nemmeno troppo esigenti.

[list]
    [*]Nella prima zona del gioco, un massimo di 44 FPS, questo si è andato a risolvere man mano che ho proseguito
    [*]Nonostante le impostazioni settate al minimo, la mia GPU dava di matto, 80-81 gradi per tutte e 7 le ore di gioco
    [*]Nei caricamenti, MSi Afterburner mi dava addirittura la bellezza di 281 FPS, per poi scendere miseramente al valore che ho scritto prima (wtf)
[/list]

Insomma, si poteva fare di più per l'ottimizzazione.

Mentre il gioco in sè non è niente male, alcuni puzzles sono noiosi, ma non troppo difficili da intuire per proseguire nel gioco. Trama interessante e curata ma poco dettagliata se non recuperate gli oggetti e non guardate nelle serrature nascoste per le aree del gioco (come me che ho pensato qualcosa solo alla fine, ma sembra una trama a libera interpretazione). Ambientazioni fantastiche e colonna sonora magnifica. Consigliato per chi ama questo genere di giochi ma soprattutto per chi vuole provare degli indie un pò diversi dal solito. Magari prendetelo quando ci sarà qualche sconto perchè per il lavoro di ottimizzazione pessimo, nessuno lo prenderebbe a prezzo pieno.

Quite glad this was re-acquired to become a multi-platform release. I'm disappointed that this sat in my library for such a long time before getting around to it, I think part of the problem was the story seemed ambiguous to me.

[b]It's by design.[/b] After completing this story your perspective on the entire adventure changes. So much thought was put into keeping you in the dark about the reality of what's happening and it's going to slap you in the face when you complete it. Potential spoiler - [spoiler]The only true hint may be the boat in the desert, I feel it represents limbo,[/spoiler] and even if you interpret that you still don't have the whole picture.

Rime is absolutely beautiful to play in both visual and audio design. There's no dialog though you can shout using basic words/sounds. Its world has a dynamic weather and day/night cycle which really brings it to life. Music presentation is outstanding, changing with your actions and the environment to set the tone for the story.

This is listed as a puzzle game, and to some extent it is, but don't jump into this expecting some Myst-style adventure where the puzzles are difficult. The puzzles feel interactive more than anything, they're put in place as obstacles and it's clear the writer doesn't want them to interfere with the story.

Rime absolutely gets my recommendation, hands down what a total surprise this one was. It'll leave you with an ICO meets Journey sort of feel.

Story: The story is really good. I did not expect it to wrap up in the way it did. At first, it seemed to be all over the place but by the end of the game. You begin to fill the pieces, and the story becomes clear to you. I really enjoyed the story of this game. One of the better ones in recent memory.

Gameplay: Controlling the protagonist is fun. This game is a puzzle platformer, and it does its job decently. You won't be disappointed. I encountered less than a handful of bugs throughout my experience. Most of them did not repeat after the first time, and they did not hinder my experience throughout the game since they only occurred in circumstances.

Graphics: I really really loved the art style of this game. At first, I thought the developers would use the same style throughout the game, but they changed it up multiple times. The game has varied environments, and each one looks just as good as the other. There are plenty of moments where you will look at it, and say wow! That looks awesome! To put it simply, it's gorgeous in many cases.

Sound: I loved the soundtrack of this game even more than its graphics. I'd go as far to say that without the soundtrack, this game would not have impressed me as much as it did. I wish they released a digital download of it (I would buy it asap). It picks up when it needs to, and it slows down when it needs to. It's done so well. It won't disappoint you at all.

I recommend this game for those that are looking for a great puzzle platformer. If you're the type of person that does not enjoy solving puzzles. There is a good chance that you will not enjoy this game because it might get frustrating for you. The puzzles are not difficult, and they are laid out in a pretty logical way in most cases. There are not many games in which I wait for the credits to finish, but this is one of the games in which I did exactly that. It left a strong impression on me, and I wish there were more games like this one. If you are a numbers person, I would give this a 10/10 (It's not the perfect game, but it gets damn close to it for me).",1512058568,1512058666,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Positives:
-Let's start with the important one, story. The story is.... AMAZING. One of the best stories I've played through, even though it was short, I really enjoyed it. At first the story seems a bit weird but slowly it all starts to make sense. The story even got very touching towards the end.
-The camera angles are most of the time in the scenes well done, but this also makes the movement sometimes different, since you move your character with for example W, you move your character forward, no matter where you look. This only happens in ""locked"" camera angles and otherwise the camera moves with your characters movement.
-The details on the textures and animations are amazing. There are so many cool little details that make the game just a slighty better. One of my favorites is that if you run for a while and run into a wall, your character will fall and get up.
-The sounds and soundtracks fit perfectly into the game and in every scene are just perfect. It really made every part of the game better just by being really fitting to the part of the story.

Negatives:
-It isn't that well optimized. Even with a GTX 1080 with max graphics, I was able to get 50-80 fps in most parts, and on some very detailed areas and such, it dropped down to 40ish. The game was still enjoyable, and I could've set down anti aliasing and such small, but very performance eating settings.
-It's too short. The story is full and amazing, but I want more just because of the soundtracks and graphics.
-The price. I got it for free from a giveaway (thankfully, because I wouldn't pay 35€ for this even after I've played it). But if it goes on sale and you want an amazing game, buy it. it might be worth it depending how much you are ready to spend on a game with only max 10 hours of gameplay, unless you play it all over again.",1511900857,1542825597,True,8,1,0.615606725215911865,1,False,True,False,False,,,

and it generally left me in awe with its simplicity of graphics, it's haunting soundtrack and it's interesting characters you meet along the way. Rime takes you on a emotional roller coaster ride with scenes in the game that range from confusion, wonder, joy, anger, sorrow and grief.  
 That being said; this is a game which left me feeling like I wanted more and that it was somehow still missing something. As other reviews have stated they are correct that this game is short and could use more material within it, however I saw no problem with the controls of the game or the operation of it, making Rime an easy win in my book for performance. if you have ever played a little well known game called Ico, you will surly like this game. Replay value is not too high here, completing a collections and adding more achievements does not really add much, the outfits are cool, but Rime's ending really cuts it for me. So should you invest your time in this game? sure!  the first play through would be no problem and generally worth it, but besides selecting stages for a second play through I don't see myself going back and playing the whole game again and that's sad. Rime has a great recipe of all the good ingredients that generally makes a really good game, what it lacks is enough support and enough material to expanded. It is fixable, easily adding some DLC creating more stages and background stories would help round out this game and complete it. All in all (FAIR) 7.5 out of 10

Und am Ende hat es mich besser unterhalten als so manche AAA Spiele dieses Jahr.  Dabei fängt Rime alles andere als spannend an. Man strandet als kleiner Junge auf einer große Insel.  Ohne zu wissen wer wir sind und wa spassiert ist erkundent man die Insel die Anfangs noch wirklich schön aussieht aber mit der Zeit immer....na ich will nicht Spoilern ;) Allgemein hat mich das Spiel ziemlich überrascht. Sei es von den Gameplay her oder den Ausgang des Spiels.  Großartig gelungen ist übrigens der Soundtrack! Mitfühlend und könnte dafür sorgen das manch anderer ein feutches Auge bekommt.  Grafisch ist das Spiel hübsch gemacht.  

Weniger gelungen ist die PC Umsetzung.  Auf MAx Settings habe ich mit mein I57600K/10606Gb GTX fast eine Diazshow was aufgrund der Kantenglättung geschuldet ist.  Dreht man die runter läuft soweit.  Aber auch sonst hat das Spiel leider oft mit mini rucklern zu kämpfen ( wie auf der PS4) was leider sehr schade ist weil es doch etwas nerven kann.

Fazit:
Wer ICO von der PS2/PS3 mochte der könnte auch Rime sehr gut finden. Das Spiel ist nichts für Spieler die nach Action suchen.  Sondern mehr für Entdecker die in der kurzen Spielzeit mal in einer komplett anderen Welt abtauchen möchten und von den Rätseln und der Musik leiten lassen möchten.

+ Музыкальное оформление. В игре нет озвучки, поэтому эмоциональная связь между игроком и миром игры устанавливается именно с помощью музыки. Без неё RIME лишилась довольно значительной части своего шарма.
+ Очень приятный графический стиль. Помимо очень приятной картинки (что ещё можно ожидать от UE4) авторам прекрасно удалось рассказать историю в виде образов.
+ Игра получилась крайне трогательной и приятной. Авторы смогли вложить в каждый уровень свой оттенок настроения (и это тут хорошо чувствуется). Создать трогательные сценки и влюбить в себя встречаемых персонажей. Очень сильно чувствуется влияние проектов Фумито Уэда (Ico).

Почему не стоит играть:
- Возможные технические проблемы на некоторых видеокартах. К примеру, на моём Radeon игра упорно вешает весь компьютер в определённых местах. Поэтому прохождение лучше не откладывать в долгий ящик, чтобы потом не было проблем с возвратом средств.

It's a very nice experience of exploration and discovery.

However, don't expect too much from the gameplay : even if the environment changes a lot and a few things are introduced, the gameplay will still revolve around jumping and climbing over specific areas. You're too much directed to where you can or cannot go, and I feel it hurts an exploration-based game. Basically, there is the main path, and secondary paths where you get collectibles. However, straying from the main path will often be rewarded, especially if you go for the 100%.
One other bad design choice is that camera orientation defines the direction where you'll be moving forward. So if you want to look around to enjoy the stunning environment, you'll have a hard time keeping moving straight at the same time. This flaw is especially bad in the few bridge cutscenes when you don't control the camera angle and have to walk straight on a bridge despite the camera being oriented sideways. The visual effect is good, but the gameplay requires you to sidestep in order to advance forward on the bridge (or fall and die)

All in all, it feels like playing a beautiful movie : follow the script, and enjoy the show. Damn worth it.
So, is it worth the price ? Well maybe not completely, it's pretty expensive, and these flaws prevent you from fully enjoying the experience. I think you better get it on sales.",1511470247,1512356057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've had it on my wishlist for awhile, and was pleasantly surprised to get the free game key.

I want to like this game, but ultimately it's not really the game advertised on this page. Contrary to what the description would have you believe, this is not an exploration game, but rather a highly linear adventure with a few small side areas with collectibles. Which is really a shame, since the strongest part of the game is the world. I've always enjoyed the ancient sci-fi theme, and I wish I could actually really explore a world based around it instead of being railroaded through it.

The graphic aesthetics are great. The world, especially the first few areas, are beautiful and beg to be explored. Music is just okay, it's very much mood music and gets repetitive pretty quickly. 

The puzzles are fairly simplistic, and the only reason they can be difficult at times is because the game can be very vague and even directionless at times and you won't see the ledge you're supposed to climb (or realize that you can interact with the critical object you need to move forwards) until you've run around for quite awhile. The game literally throws you into the world with no inkling of what you're supposed to do or what the controls are or how they work. I get that many AAA games handhold the player too much and the devs want to encourage exploration (as limited as it is), but mant times it felt like this was taken a little too far.

On top of that, the controls are quite clunky and unresponsive at times, and only being able to save at checkpoints is something that should stay in the past and not be dragged into the present. At times, the camera can be a nuisance as well with the forced perspective changes.

I've also run into a few bugs with puzzles that let you get into previous areas, but then can't get back to where you're supposed to be so you have to reload the checkpoint. Checkpoints are a little too far apart for being the only place to save, resulting in having to replay good sized chunks of the game if you have to quit in the middle or run into a bug.

I also had some issues with optimization, this game is very heavy on the CPU for no good reason that I can see given the simplistic gameplay. Might be a result of this being a console port with the PC version taking a back seat.

Then there's the story. I'll try not to spoil it, but the ending is depressing, and I think this would have been a better game is the devs had kept it as ancient sci-fi with a fantasy story instead of having the depressing link to reality it is now.

There's also the issue of length. I have no problem with short games, but I do have a problem when they're priced like much larger ones and don't have much in the way of replay value. As you can see from my playtime, it takes about 3 hours to finish the game. I didn't hunt for collectibles, if you wanted to go back and get those it would add a few more hours, but you're still not really getting a great value at the asking price. Especially since I didn't really find the story rewarding.

Overall, not bad at all for a free game, or even for a modest price, but I'm glad I didn't impulse buy it earlier when it was on sale. I'm giving it a thumbs down because overall, the only really good thing the game has is the aesthetics and the world, yet you're not really given a chance to explore it.",1511342185,1511342322,False,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The game starts out in a world that's seemingly open and ready for exploration, which it is to an extent, but it's mostly secrets and collectibles that hide in the corners of the world. The game itself is linear and that's okay. The world is interesting enough that the exploration feels satisfying just to make your way through the beautifully crafted design. I definitely felt drawn to investigate the nooks and crannies and interact with all the objects that allowed it.

The main character is part of what makes the game awesome. The entire game revolves around this boy that finds itself in this mysterious place, guided by a little fox while the full story gets revealed through flashbacks and symbolism throughout the course of the game. His design is absolutely adorable, with a bright red cape and an innocent appearance. There is a dedicated 'yell' button (which activates certain objects in the game) which is the best. I love yelling at stuff. I love how flames flair up as he screams and I basically couldn't stop screaming (or humming depending on the situation). His animations are also just lovely. He feels genuine and lovable in a world that caters to his mystery.

All in all a very recommended game. It takes obvious inspiration from Team Ico games, especially Ico. If you enjoy those types of games then this is right up your alley. At times there are some janky moments with the camera or controls, but honestly it's not to the point of frustration.

游戏的画面相当舒服，由前期采用柔和的亮白色调，整个场景宛如天堂，到后面转变为暗色，一下子坠入地狱，最后回归亮金色。
游戏画面的变化基本就是剧情的走向，剧情并没有多余的对话，但是可以通过场景里的浮雕、角色的梦境等暗示做出自己的判断，所以每个人对剧情的理解都会不同。
其实这样的游戏，卖颜值就够了，游戏中的解谜元素只能作为小菜，首先是解谜难度不高，基本不需要太多时间就能解开；其次是解谜创意一般，无非就是推箱子和借位。
游戏里最惊心动魄的地方在躲避大龙追击并且兼顾解谜的第二章，压迫感十足，提前发力导致的后面整体爆发力不强，着实可惜。[spoiler]海景真好看[/spoiler]

......

After reading relatively mixed reviews, I balked at the price, as I usually try not to pay this much for a game nowawadays. In the end, being a sucker for art styles of this kind, I bought Rime expecting a gorgeous puzzle game with a relatively balanced difficulty and clear nods to ICO, an old PS2 favorite from my college days. What I got was an unexpectedly emotional journey, told mostly through level design alone, about loss. Having recently had a family member pass away, I can only say that this game cut deep, and while the conclusion hurt like hell, it feels oddly providential to have played it this close to my family member's stepping beyond the Veil. Granted, I also did not see this story coming and only in hindsight does the way this game is built, make sense. 

Good old hindsight. Life is always a little clearer looking back. Rime is no different. I've played a few games similar to this one. Again it reminded me of ICO and Shadow of the Collosus and Journey and a few other expected note strikers lots of critics have hit in their reviews. With this game though, the epic setting and mythical atmosphere, really touch on a sense of loss and the process of grief that frankly, hit much closer to home for me than any of the previous titles, because it isn't a prince trying to save a princess by killing Gods, or a boy leading a blind girl out of a fortress. This is about a broken family, and the peices that must be picked up after that breaking occurs. You may be guiding this boy through a quest, but you're also piecing something together, that was broken, all so that you can let it go. 

Being a puzzle platformer that is more about the amtosphere of the journey than the puzzles themselves, this kind of game is not for everyone and for others, it may be best to wait till it's on sale. For me, this was a kind of catharsis, that I guess fate decided I needed to experience at this point in my life and given the love the devs put into it, as well as the thank you's they write in the end credits, well, that kind of heart ended up being worth $30.",1510547426,1510547636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However when I won a giveaway for this game I decided to give it a try, and boy was I happy I did. I personally love these types of games, and RiME definitely filled a hole in me that I didn't even know I had. RiME is not for everyone, but for the niche audience it is for, you are in for one ride, and it is one hell of a ride.
[i]Note: the game does suffer from some minor optimization issues, but is more than playable[/i] 
[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1] 
RiME's artstyle and visuals are the best I have every seen. Every frame is awe-inspiring, with crisp textures and an amazing artstyle that is reminiscent of Abzu or The Witness. I found myself stopping and admiring the environment every minute or so, it's that good. Animations look amazing and feel extremely smooth. RiME also focuses on letting the player take a high ground and observe the entire area that they just explored and that only adds to how beautiful this game already is. 
SCORE 10/10 
[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1] 
RiME is a game mostly about exploration and puzzle solving. Puzzles are fairly easy and don't require too much thought to be put into them, but they are enjoyable and have some great concepts behind them. Puzzles feel like they are built into the environment, which makes them feel natural. Exploration is enjoyable, mostly due to the fact on how amazing the graphics are. However, most of the game is a walking simulator which might be a problem for some people, but not for others. RiME is also a fairly short game, only being 5-6 hours long, which wasn't that big of a problem for me since it's obvious to see how much the developers tried to put in into those 5-6 hours.  
SCORE 8/10 
[h1]AUDIO[/h1] 
The musical score in RiME is fantastic. The music is incredibly relaxing and matches the tone of the game perfectly. I'm not a big fan of classical music, but RiME's soundtrack obviously has so many emotions thrown into it that it's hard not to appreciate it. I'm not really a music guy so there's not much else I can say other than the music really is amazing. 
SCORE 9/10 
[h1]STORY[/h1] 
After playing through the game and reflecting on the story I am truly amazed. There is no real lore about what is going on around you, but the characters and the deeper meaning behind the story are extremely well made. There is no dialogue, just the environment and a few cutscenes. That only makes the story more interesting and makes you want to find out about the world around you. The only gripe that I have with the story is that it is way too cryptic. It's ok to have your story just be the environment and few cutscenes and to make you think about the story, but there is a real lack of explanation for a lot of things, at least a point in the right direction would go a long way to helping everyone understand the story. 
SCORE 8/10
[h1]SUMMARY[/h1] 
RiME is one of the most beautiful exploration game that I have ever played, with great music and an interesting story. However, the story is a bit cryptic and it's a bit short. Apart from that though, I would say RiME is one of the coolest games I've played in 2017.

但是我还是想提出一些重要建议，希望你们可以采纳：

1：游戏优化确实比较差，毕竟这是游戏不是电影，游戏性才是最主要的！所以强烈建议改进，否则非常影响游戏体验。
2：游戏解谜过于简单。 希望能够提高难度，（尤其是第二，三章）否则很多玩家会感到无聊乏味。
3：希望增加一些收集品的奖励，比如额外剧情或关卡，让玩家不是为了做任务才去收集。毕竟这是休闲类的游戏，如果剧情关卡方面没有新奇的地方，很多人会没有耐心重新玩。

Esta pintura en movimiento no podia ser acompañada con tal epica banda sonora que en mas de una ocasion te remueve por dento, sublime de lo mejor del juego y me atrevo a decir a la altura de otros juegos similares. 

Estos dos puntos anteriores para mi son lo indiscutuble del juego a partir de aqui son cosas que para muchos seran diferentes:

La historia es buena, no esperes nada epico ni tampoco algo nulo, la histria se cuenta a traves del mundo , su banda sonora y las pocas cinematicas que se encuentran. Durante la aventura puedes incluso deducir una historia que al final resulta ser otra, en muchos tramos te emociona. 

A resumidas cuentas si te gustan los juegos tipo Journey o Abzu no lo dudes compralo. Con un pero...

El juego se basa en los puzles y si esperas algun reto de ello este no es tu juego ya que personalmente la mayoria de ellos son relativamente fáciles, bajo mi punto de vista no es algo malo ya que creo que el tipo de historia no le encaja unos puzles demasiado complicados pero debes tener eso en cuenta

Tecnologicamente hablando tube algunos problemas de frame rate y creo que podria estar mas bien optimizado.

Personalmente el juego me ha llegado, me ha emocionado y asombrado a partes iguales, si buscas una experiencia unica no debes perdertelo.",1509875667,1509875929,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[/quote]
Rime是一款动作冒险解谜游戏，由西班牙制作团队Tequila Works开发。这款被称为向ICO致敬的游戏，在第一眼看来，其美丽如吉卜力的画风，静谧的音乐着实吸引了一大批玩家。此前本作由索尼投资并作为ps独占作品推出，但是开发团队收回了游戏版权并在全平台推出，如此的雄心壮志，加上游戏美丽的外表，却难以掩盖游戏本质的不足。

游戏的故事在一位倒在沙滩上的皮肤黝黑的男孩身上开始，醒来后，完全陌生的小岛，白如象牙的高塔和石块，绿意盎然的风景衬托下，美丽无比，这就是小岛的面貌。玩家要做的就是操控小男孩去探索，发现小岛的秘密。作品一开始没有给出任何的背景，也没有任何台词，所有的剧情发生都靠角色的互动来阐述，随着剧情的推进，这些谜团慢慢地在回忆慢慢拼凑起来，最后在一波反转后水落石出。剧情叙述总的来说非常不错，在男孩和小狐狸相遇，到在飞行的怪物爪下逃生，再到剧终同伴的付出奉献，这些点总能抓住玩家的心，使游戏本身不落俗套。

游戏本身并不是很复杂，作为一个解密类游戏，没有塞尔达那样的战斗系统和养成系统，玩家只需要在建筑的突出位进行攀爬，或者利用呼喊、视角错位、光线来触发机关，这些解谜起初都很有意思，但是到了游戏后期，游戏解谜仍然还是围绕着这些元素，缺乏一定的解谜深度，比起它的前辈，《风之旅人》、《ICO》甚至手机平台的《纪念碑谷》，解谜成分上是差了一截。同时在解谜难度上，还是那种很容易就能解出的难度，玩家基本不会卡关，在旅游观光看剧情的层面上，这样做也不是不可以，但是作为一款解谜游戏，少了令玩家解谜成功产生的成就感、巧妙感，当然也不会有二周目的游玩。

游戏地图比较开放，场景做得都很不错，但是那么大的地图，互动还是零星地散落在游戏各个角落里，玩家虽然可以攀爬、游泳，但是地图还是很空洞，有很多完全无用的巷道，大部分玩家的时间都浪费在赶路上，好在主线关卡的地图设计还不错，利用率很高，往往在开启机关后原本的路会发生变化。同样游戏还有很多收集要素，不过这些收集要素对于剧情的推进没有任何帮助，完全不痛不痒，要不是那些成就摆在那，玩家非常容易缺乏收集的动力。

游戏的画风十分清新，令人神往，这一点是毋庸置疑的，在制作组强大的美术功底下，那个充满惬意风景的海上小岛呈现在我们面前，建筑风格又有点希腊古建筑的风格，而地下建筑则有埃及建筑的风格，得益于虚幻4引擎强大的表现能力，这些风景加上漂亮的光影，还真是让玩家流连忘返。

游戏BGM十分迎合游戏的风景，有时玩家可能察觉不到它的存在，但是在解开机关后音乐悠扬地响起也是十分拨人心弦。没有激昂顿挫的激情，没有印象深刻的旋律，仅仅靠细致入微的音符牵动玩家的耳朵，或许这就是制作组强大的表现力的体现。

Rime仅仅只有6个小时的游玩时长，没有复杂的系统，不需要玩家耗费太多的脑力和时间，只需找一个安静的下午，推完这款游戏，或许可以像读到一本沁人心脾的小书一样，带来的感悟也许超过了游戏本身的价值。

优点：
+清新的画风
+不错的BGM
+剧情叙述方式很好

缺点：
-解谜过于简易
-地图空洞，收集无聊

unfortunately, the game failed to deliver on all of those parts.

i had major issues with this game, but i'm still recommending it for a couple reasons. one, the final sequence of the game's story almost made the game worth my money - without any spoilers, it was emotional, heartwrenching, and wondrous. it was the perfection that i had anticipated from the game beforehand. and two - even with these major flaws, i still ended up enjoying RiME and what it had to offer, an beautiful artwork and art style that it presented so wonderfully.

one of the main problems i had with RiME was the lack of what it promised to offer. story clips were only found at around 5 points within the 8-hour game and never lasted more than a minute or so, and were often disappointing and had so little emotional impact. most seemed like they were sped up and went by so fast that the watcher had little time to wonder and realize what was going on. even the final sequences, which i loved, were so short and felt like they could definitely be much longer and magnify that impression of emotions on the player.

but that's not to mention that the story didn't have its good parts either. i enjoyed the plot and how the events of the story were implied and ultimately left to the player to figure out. the final sequences almost had me in tears, and it was nice to see a story that was definitive but also left some details up to the player to decide on what had happened.

another problem i had were the puzzles. for a puzzle-game that even developed its own interesting mechanics and puzzle devices, the puzzles themselves never really developed beyond go-get-that-block or pull-this. they clearly were thought to be second-hand to the story, which was disappointing because the story didn’t really live up to its expectations. increasing the puzzle difficulty a little more i feel would interest the players a little more, and especially make the game more interesting in its slower areas.

then there are the collectibles. these are interesting and fun to find in your first playthrough, but the sheer amount of them (about 30-50 i would hazard) made me annoyed as i went through the 8-hour game again to find them, and my reward was often nothing more than a worthless sentence in the final moments, a brief song clip, a playable costume, or even simply an image on the menu screen. there needed to be a better reward system in place besides some simple achievement that made these worthwhile to the player.

a final problem i had were some faulty mechanics and frame rate issues. the art and shadow quality is automatically set to high, which stifled the frame rate even with a fairly good computer (i'm no expert on computer specs). i had to lower both to medium quality which was ultimately weird as when playing i didn't seem to find any major difference between the medium and high quality. and with the mechanics, there were about three major problems, and all of them had to do with ledges. RiME, for some reason, has a ""boundary"" on edges of cliffs and such where the character wobbles around like he's about to fall off a cliff whenever he's on a ledge, which was helpful in some cases where i would rather not fall off, and not helpful in others where i was purposefully trying to jump down. and the fact that the player controls the camera on some ledges made the controls very weird depending on the camera angle – almost like the forward button meant left or vice versa, and somehow when the camera control was fixed it was also annoying, as i either couldn't see where i was supposed to go or i missed that lack of freedom with the camera. and that's not even mentioning the problems i had RiME's death animation. pretty much the only way to die is to get your soul sucked out by vicious passive-aggressive dementors or to jump off a cliff. the soul-sucking is fine, i guess. but when you jump off a cliff, within a millisecond the game realizes that you're gonna die and the screen goes black and you respawn. there's nothing interesting about the animation. for example, what if, when you fell off a cliff, you could watch the boy fall right until he was about to hit the ground and then the black screen? this gives the player more emotional connection with the character and a better reason to not try and jump off cliffs.

but that's not to say i didn't love RiME. again, without any spoilers, i loved the final moments of the game, and i really enjoyed the atmosphere, artwork, and even the story at times. i'm not so certain that it's worth its full price of $30, (maybe at $20 or $15 is a better price) but i enjoyed my time with RiME overall, and i'm certain that if you're into these types of games that you will, too.",1509206740,1612072680,True,5,0,0.53844153881072998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can see how much time I have put just into finding them and re-interpreting the story (which is kind of simbolic).

Overall I loved it and would recommend if you're into this sort of game. Bit expensive though, would wait for a sale.",1509022874,1509022874,True,1,0,0.49572908878326416,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Pros:

+Gorgeous Graphics
+Amazing Music
+Good size world
+similar to Journey and ICO in some respects.
+6 hours of content (add 2-3 MORE hours if your going for 100%)
+the game actually makes for a more interesting second playthrough.

Cons

-Gameplay while changes throughout the game, is not deep enough, did get a little tired of the game by the end.
-lack of character upgrades like faster running hurts this game slightly, considering all the exporing you'll be doing if you plan to go for a 100%

Tak to teprve zkuste tuto úžasnou hru RiME, která je stylem velmi podobná právě zminovanému ABZU. Ale tady mi hra přijde mnohem více dotaženější a graficky zase úplně trošku na jiném levelu.

Příjemná a uklidňující hra s úžasným hudebním doprovodem a zajímavým ""SCI-FI"" příběhem, který vás rozhodně nadchne a nepustí od hry, dokud nezjistíte co je za tím zač a co se stane když uděláte určité kroky ve hře.

Jediné co mě v této hře trošku zklamalo je konec hry, který jsem očekával trošku jiný a více epický, ale rozhodně neurazí a do konceptu této hry se asi hodí.

Hra má zhruba asi 4 hodiny hrací dobu, když budete zkoumat všudepřítomné místnůstky a prostory, zabere vám to ještě více času. Já se spíše zajímal o hlavní děj této hry. Hra není vůbec náročná, jak jsem psal na začátku jedná se spíše o relaxační hru - doporučuji zahrát po těžkém dni v práci (tak jako já), a rozhodně se od hry neodtrhnete :)

However, don’t let the product’s screenshots and trailer cinematic fool you… because when you finish it, the narrative will leave you heartbroken, and very possibly a bad aftertaste; YMMV.

Also, there seems to be some serious optimization issues with the game’s highest graphics settings that causes severe framerate drops.  I played on 2nd highest setting due to that, since the minor drop of sharpness didn’t bother me.

Despite all that, I still recommend this game, especially if it’s on a discount.  Maybe because it being wordless, atmospheric, touring of dreamy and exotic landscape really being my cup of tea.  When you are prepared for the revealed truth of this gorgeous journey being less of a happy ending, sail onto RiME, and let your emotion be the current, from a veiled denial to the final acceptance.

Seems like the arthouse crowd is sometimes too lazy to buy anything on this platform, and some people have absurd expectations with budget titles, which is a shame because games like this deserve better sales. 

Rime is an amazing experience. It's as simple as that. I played this on PS4, and all I can say is the graphics are even better here, and the FPS is a solid 60 on my 1070/2600K setup with 1080p. Anything more and you might run into some troubles without better hardware.

It's totally acceptable that this game wears its inspiration on its sleeves, and yet who cares when it all comes together this well? Miyazaki films, Joaquín Sorolla paintings, and the games Journey and Ico come to mind. This world is so profoundly lovely and attractive that I can basically overlook almost any flaws with the game.

The gameplay experience is actually soothing and fun to me, and I enjoy a very wide variety of games and difficulties across genres. No, you aren't going to be challenged like some SMB platformer or a PUBG gun game. It's not meant to be that way. It wouldn't even work that way. This is a relaxing puzzle game that swings toward the easier side, but it makes up for it with a decent amount of collectibles, and the game never overstays its welcome.

The graphics and world here are like some amalgamation of a Miyazaki film, Wind Waker, and ABZU/Ico. Honestly, I wasn't sure I was going to be impressed by their world, as there is limited interaction, but it is actually a breathtaking accomplishment. I am injecting SMAA at 1080p and the image quality is fantastic. While not overly detailed the bloomy resonance of the island recalls games like Ico and Shadow of the Colossus in tone to the point you really got to congratulate the team of 18 people in Spain that made this over the years. It was a struggle, but what a diamond that struggle birthed. There is just something wonderful about running around a deserted place that has no equivalency in the modern world.

I cannot help but love this thing. It's too charming to hate, too pretty to leave behind, and overall the experience is something that the whole family can enjoy. You would think there would be a bigger audience for such an indie, but with time more and more people will find this gem as it releases on all the platforms.

Anyone looking for a beautiful world spanning day and night that wants to solve a few puzzles and gaze at some gorgeous visuals is in for a treat here. Some of the collectibles are hidden fairly well and will take some logical thinking to collect. It's all very peaceful and heartwarming.

Gierka może jest trochę za łatwa, jeśli zdarzy nam się zginąć to praktycznie teleportuje nas o parę chwil wcześniej.

You start as a boy who stranded on an island and trying to figure out what this game is about. You get the feel ""well i guess i have to explore this island"". But then the first revelation there is nothing or at least not much to really explore. That island really feels like a level that tricks you into thinking it is an island. And seriously why is this game running to piss poor, i have a 1080ti and R7 1700x and this game runs with 40fps on max details on 1440p, the looks of this game and size of levels don't justify this performance. Then you start to enjoy the art style but the feeling that the developer were just lazy. You can make a minimalist artstyle but then you have to make up for it so it doesn't feel cheap and empty and yes this game feels cheep and lazy. 
A big problem what comes in hands with it is the massive hand holding, it is impossible to miss the goal because first you have a fox that leads you to every spot they can't mark white and second because well they made every edge of importance white. This little detail should have used on almost every edge, not just on spots where the game wants you to go and would improve the graphical quality of the game.
I am pretty aware that many games are dumbed down compared to games that were released in the 80s and 90s but this game shouldn't have that massive amount of hand holding and lack of stakes. You are playing a boy who is on an adventure...but there are no stakes not sense of real adventure. Where is the adventure when the game holds your hand and says ""you go there, then there and then there oh and by the way you can't really fail"". I would hate that as a child, it's like going to the playground with your parents and never leave their side. It doesn't make any sense in the context of this game. And don't come with ""well that big bird can snatch you"" at me, you totally know that it was so easy to avoid that from happening. The puzzles-if you want to call them that- are way too easy and obvious because of the handholding. So you don't get any feel of accomplishment. You are basically just running to spots where the games leads you to, then walk to different spots where the game leads you to to collect keys to open gates and doors from previous spots. Yep no thinking or figuring out involved, just running from spot to spot, no puzzles in this game folks.
Nothing to say about the story, very surface level and not very interesting or engaging. But they still figured out to ruin this experience. The last scene of the game is a big ""DO YOU GET, THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS THIS AND THAT OBJECT THIS, DO YOU GET IT?"" which really made me angry. The game was over with the scene on the boat, everything what comes after ruins any attempt, since the actual scenes with story are so scarce.

在购买这款游戏前我去做了一系列的搜索。这款小成本游戏的开发商是一个西班牙的工作室，而且许多游戏网站和媒体对《RiME》的评价是非常两级的。也就是爱的人很爱，不爱的人无感。造成这样褒贬不一的评分的原因除了是由不同玩家和测评人个的人喜好、审美、兴趣不同以外，这款游戏自身命途多舛的背景也带来了一定影响。《RiME》最早是被微软看上，后来又辗转去了索尼。早在13年的时候就宣布要在PS4上发行而且连精美的预告片都做出来了，但不知为什么索尼撤资合同流产。外界很早就对《RiME》投来了怀疑的目光，但最终这个几乎不可能实现的游戏还是在去年登上了各大平台。光是这样的背景，就足够让好奇心重的我报着一睹为快的心思点开了Steam上的游戏预告。点开的那一刻我并没有特别被游戏封面、或是探险、解密这一类的标签所吸引，再加上我个人不是特别喜欢偏向Q版小清新画风的作品，一开始还真有些不以为意。真正让我萌发一定要购买这个游戏的欲望的原因，就是Steam上那两个短短的宣传动画。精美的图像和流畅的画风，搭配上动人悦耳的旋律，让我不自觉的就深深被吸引住了。我看到有评测过的朋友形容这个作品是一个""不容错过的、值得收藏的艺术品""，对于此我不能赞同更多！尤其是在我查过了这个游戏的制作背景后，并得知第二个宣传动画的背景小提琴曲竟是小提琴女神Lindsey Stirling演奏的后，我强烈建议喜欢纯音乐的朋友们仅仅是为了支持音乐作品也应该购买和支持这个作品以及开发商。在此再次感谢制作人的用心，让我得以享受这个视听盛宴！不过也有技术流的玩家提出这个游戏由于成本较低，在画面的光影还是流动性什么的（我不懂的专业术语）并不算最出色，还是停留在几年前的水平，这一点上我可能是认同的。因为在游戏中，某些角度上看会觉得画面好像是透明度不够还是什么的，水流似乎没有那种波光粼粼的感觉。但是并不会影响游戏体验，反倒是让常玩大型3D游戏的我认为这是一种别样的画风而已。

接下来是关于游戏内容的，有些朋友讨论说觉得游戏内容比较单一，谜题不够复杂，剧情稍显单薄，还有情节的起伏和节奏把握比较奇怪等等，对于这些言论的个别点我持不同看法。在谜题难度方面我基本可以认同，作为独立游戏谜题不算复杂，我这种比较笨的玩家也能够慢慢摸索出来玩法，跟着网友分享的攻略走就更明了了。接下来是有人说游戏内容单一的这点，我恰恰相反，认为这个游戏可以称之为非常饱满。除了从游戏长度，和整个冒险的过程要探索过的地方来评判外，就是因为《RiME》这个游戏把一个简单的命题“亲情”发挥的非常细致，可谓酣畅淋漓，使得单一命题的游戏给人以十分深刻的印象。所以内容上我认为已经是极致了。再往更深了理解，这个游戏除了“亲情”以外，还包含了“自我救赎”“自我认知”等非常人性和深刻的考量。游戏中还包含大量线索、标志等等，甚至连章节名称、成就标题方面，都非常成功地运用了象征的手法，向玩家阐明这个故事的主旨和内涵。那么剧情方面，结合我刚刚所说的，我认为剧情也是，从游戏长度设计和游戏主旨去看走向的话，已经算是比较长和丰满的了，伏笔也埋得充分。如果非要在内容上挑剔的话，我会说这个游戏是一个需要在玩的过程中思考其本质的东西，而正是因为离真相本身并不遥远，所以才会更希望和玩家产生思想上的共鸣而非只是走完故事流程。我觉得部分玩家感叹剧情简单，大概只是因为个人审美的不同、游戏需求的不同，抑或只是过于理性吧：D

综上所述，我会推荐这个游戏给心思细腻、善于感悟、爱好艺术的玩家，这绝对是你这几年都不想错过的一部作品！我个人给予这个游戏满分10/10的评价，希望你也能够喜欢并早日购买这部优秀的作品！感谢读完。",1505381066,1506632117,True,19,1,0.711340665817260742,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I wouldn't call it a walking simulator although the game is reminiscent of Abzu like other reviewers have said. After an opening hour of confusion (about what kind of game RiME actually was), I grew to enjoy the game, especially the third level. It's questionable whether there is enough ""meat on the bone"", gameplay wise, to justify the price, but at the same time the length of the game feels pretty much perfect and it's not a game that would benefit from being longer I think.",1504789891,1504789891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Devo dire che sono rimasto molto soddisfatto:
- sia la grafica sia la colonna sonora sono di alta qualità, con ambientazioni che vale la pena osservare a ""360°"" ed un accompagnamento musicale che crea la giusta atmosfera;
- la trama è molto ben strutturata e ""ben raccontata"".
Di contro, gli enigmi sono abbastanza semplici (non si può avere tutto...).
Non aspettatevi combattimenti; non ce ne sono.
Il gioco si basa sull'esplorazione e la risoluzione di enigmi per poter avanzare. L'esplorazione dell'ambiente circostante è anche un punto chiave per il completamento degli extra (facoltativo) e la possibilità di visualizzare il finale completo (che vale la pena vedere).
La trama è molto godibile, anche in assenza di dialoghi (ebbene sì, non ci sono...). Il gioco, infatti, può essere definito un racconto introspettivo che, man mano che si avanza con la storia tra i vari capitoli,  ha come punto di forza la capacità di trasmettere emozioni al giocatore facendo un sapiente uso di immagini e suoni.
Il finale resta uno dei più commeventi che abbia visto in un videogioco.

I enjoyed it, despite some small issues I had with it. It had an interesting narrative which had a bittersweet feel to it throughout. Art style is brilliant, and it caused me to constantly hit that F12 button throughout as there were so many wonderful shots. Music fit the feel of the game perfectly, and its impact on mood should not be overlooked. Game is relatively short, but I don't have a problem with this, as it tells the story it needs to in the time it takes up. I'm sure when I return to the game to try to get a 100% completion (with colectible stuff hidden everywhere) it'll add a bit more to the played time, but a standard play through will take less than 10 hours. Just something to consider if you think long play time to be a deciding factor.

Really the only issue with it is that sometimes the controls feel a little clumsy, especially in regards to camera movement. Why can't I adjust zoom manually?

Overall an enjoyable game, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale. I get all my games on sale though, so eh.

EDIT: OK so I did a 100% walkthrough and I enjoyed it more the second time through than the first time. Getting the locked ending is something worth trying to achieve at the very least.

=======
6小时剧情通关，4小时按着攻略收集全成就。这部作品的成就设计很合理，由彩蛋和全收集组成的，彩蛋让人很惊喜，收集要素像神秘海域那样，是设计在岔路上，不会拖慢游戏进度，但是偶然发现的时候又有柳暗花明又一村的感觉。
风景和BGM是这作的两大亮点，起初买这个游戏的人，大部分都是被LOGO图那片蓝得醉人的海吸引了吧。
为了看风景，UI设计精简到不能再精简，但是提示又恰到好处，游戏会在你长久的浮在水面上时冒出一个潜水按键的提示。
解谜和关卡设计，难度恰到好处，第三章守护者的地图制作可见功夫之深，许多场景都是楼上楼下连过道都充分利用，之前过不去的地方，有了守护者帮忙就能过去，无形中还加深了玩家和AI之间的感情。
字幕？台词？汉化？不需要的。这样“灵魂交流”的游戏，全篇没有任何台词，有的只有男孩的呐喊，从坚定到虚弱，再到坚定。[strike]那些在任何非中文游戏下都刷“We need Chinese”的朋友可以散了，就让他们错过这部佳作吧[/strike]。当然如果你不看汉字连调画面设置都困难的话，还是去找个汉化包吧。游戏存在些许优化问题，最高设置（抗锯齿FXAA以上）画面掉帧明显，我1070显卡也只能跑20多帧，但开低一些不影响画面观感，帧数能瞬间回到100多，建议进游戏后检查下是否默认最高画质。
剧透反黑
[spoiler]由于没有台词，游戏流程中没有说明的剧情可以在收集品“钥匙孔”中得到补完，每个钥匙孔是一幅画，画记录着这个悲伤的家庭从男孩降生以来的故事。透过锁孔看到的是真相，也说明男孩所处的世界反而是幻象。第三章结束时过场CG骗了我，让我以为是男孩失去了父亲，然而第四章我才知道，当时坠海身亡的是那个男孩。[/spoiler]
[spoiler]钥匙孔讲了这个家庭的故事：在男孩诞生，幸福的日子没过多久，这个家的母亲患病去世了，父亲悲痛欲绝，男孩也在迷茫和痛苦之中，选择了以海相伴，发泄他的悲伤。在一次风暴中，父亲和男孩的船剧烈摇晃着，男孩失足摔入了海中，父亲没有拉住……落水的男孩灵魂无处可依，在幻象世界里游荡寻找着方向。所以他的目的地总是灯塔，那是他生前住的小房间，每天从窗子望去，都能看到那座灯塔。陪伴他旅途，让他不再孤独的是他的玩具小狐狸，化成了可爱的生灵。为他指引方向的，则是那身着一袭红披风的父亲。低着头的黑影，是孤独哭泣的亡魂，是人们无处消散的积怨、遗憾、忿恨和悲伤。那一抹静静等待着男孩到来的白色影子，是妈妈。（收集了全部的白色影子后，在尾声章节，能看到一家人相隔着时空，在此刻紧紧抱在了一起）[/spoiler]
[spoiler]赚够了大家的喜爱和眼泪的，圆头圆脑又有着细长双脚的守护者，才是整个游戏设定里最神奇的一环。它们的形象取自男孩窗前的风铃，但是他们有思想，充满好奇心，同情心，甘愿奉献自己。谁都不知道，死后的世界会是什么样的呢？如果有这些精灵相伴，或许就没那么孤独。这或许是真实的幻象，又或许是生者对亡者的祝愿。男孩在经历了这些孤独和生死与共后，一次次痛失挚友而变得成熟，灵魂也得到了安息。这坎坷的旅途，又何尝不是地面上的父亲在痛失所爱后的心路。[/spoiler]
[spoiler]尾声章节很短，其成就名为“放手”。当儿子迷途的灵魂回到了家，当父亲再次打开儿子的房间，那一刻仿佛全世界的色彩又回到了这个小天地，他抚摸着那些木制玩具，然后下定决心，让那一片衣角随着他的悲伤、男孩的灵魂安息，留下的只有这个家曾经的那些美好记忆。逝者已逝，生者当如斯。[/spoiler]",1504468049,1511376815,True,7,1,0.628571450710296631,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]此游戏有三大泪点：[/b]

1、被小男孩千辛万苦救活的大脑袋机器人们，随着不断接近最后的真相，他们为打开一扇又一扇大门时把自己化为了钥匙，你以为，这就是他们的使命，但当那个小男孩亲手造就的机器人，在最后一扇门前停下，你才发觉这一路陪你走来，已经只剩下它最后一个机器人。
小男孩此时明白过来，它也要化为开门的钥匙。
“不！我不要你去！我不再追寻真相了！你不要离开我！”
大雨中，男孩用尽全身力气抱住机器人的腿，试图拦下朝着钥匙孔前进的机器人。
一路上，你们曾互相帮助对方，它已经成为你不能失去的伙伴，它虽然不会说话，但它用一次又一次的行动告诉你，它懂你。
你曾以为你们能一起走到最后，但当面对抉择时，它却要选择牺牲自己，为你打开真相的大门。
它也许并不想离开你，可它知道，只有它的牺牲，才能换回你的自我。
“不——！”小男孩眼睁睁看着机器人嵌入钥匙孔，化为一道金光，为你打开大门，而它却永远地被分离成两半，代表它“生命”的那道蓝光，永远的黯淡了下去。
男孩的泪水汹涌而出，雨还在下，但伙伴已经不在了。
小狐狸懂事的轻轻走过来，钻入你的怀里，用自己的毛发，擦干你的泪水，用自己的体温，温暖你那颗受伤的心灵。
“为什么~这是为什么~”男孩搂着小狐狸哭得更凶了。
“孩子，别哭，你还有我，只有你继续前进，才不会辜负它的牺牲。”
[h1] 真相总是伴随着代价[/h1]

2、当小狐狸陪着小男孩在大雨中集齐所有的雕像，每当收集到一座小雕像时，小狐狸就会充满悲伤的趴在雕像前哀鸣，就像在做一个告别，一个万般不舍的告别。
“小狐狸，你怎么了。。。。。”
小狐狸没有说话，只是看着男孩，眼中竟也泛起涟漪，不知是泪水还是雨水。
就在即将打开通往真相的最后道路时，小男孩发现一道道金光从自己身后飞来，化作万紫千红汇入最后的雕像，为它注入开启道路的力量。
“这些金光从哪来的？”小男孩疑惑的转身，却发现身后的小狐狸已经虚弱的趴在了地上——它在用自己的生命为雕像注入力量。
“不！快停下！”男孩一把抱住小狐狸，刚刚放下没多久的泪水再度决堤而出，他已经不能再失去伙伴了。
从一开始男孩流落在这个岛上时，小狐狸是他结识的第一个伙伴，当他为前进道路而感到迷惑时，小狐狸便总是冲到前方为男孩指引方向，当男孩成功搞定困难时，小狐狸又围着男孩跳来跳去，庆祝他的成功，他们一起哭过，笑过，他们一起累过，走过。
但一直，小狐狸都没有离开过。
男孩现在终于明白，小狐狸之前为什么在雕像前悲鸣——它在对男孩做最后的道别。
“只有我的生命，才能打开这最后的雕像，别怕，别哭，勇敢的走下去，我会一直在你心里”
小狐狸在男孩怀中露出最后一个笑容，便化为了片片光芒，汇入那个最后的雕像。
“你为什么不早点告诉我！不————————————！”男孩绝望的看着怀中小狐狸消逝，他失去了最后一位伙伴。
[h1]一旦你决定寻找真相，就只能与孤独为伴。[/h1]
前进吧，孩子，你还有路要走，你最后的道路。

3、男孩终于来到最后的地方，现在他失去了伙伴，失去了所有，终于看清了那个真相，那个残酷的真相：自己已经死去，这一路走来，不过是找回自我，找回记忆。
他终于明白当初在自己脑海中一闪而过的碎片代表着什么，那个在船上被风浪裹入大海中的，不是那个红衣男人，那就是曾经活着的自己。
男孩筋疲力尽的看向周围，看着周围一个个灵魂纵身跳入那个深渊。
“跳下去吧，只有跳下去，你才能开启生命的又一个轮回”
“是。。。。吗？”男孩眼睛迷离起来，他蹒跚着走向那个深渊。
[h1] 当知道一切真相时，一切却显得那么苍白无力。[/h1]
男孩跳下深渊，周围的一切越来越模糊......
————————
画面一转，一个小屋中，男孩的父亲手握一把钥匙，一把儿子生前房间的钥匙。
“我已经在大海上寻找你了很久很久，我多希望你能有一天笑着回到我的身边，可是。。。。。可是。。。。”
男孩的父亲梗咽了。
父亲擦干眼泪，他已经失去了他的爱人，现在，他却又不得不再接受失去儿子的事实。
他站起来，走向儿子的房间，用那把钥匙，打开了房间的门。
“最后看一眼儿子房间也好。。。。。哪怕是最后一眼。。。”
房间里一切如故，就像孩子还在一样，墙上的风车还在旋转，床上的狐狸玩偶仍然乖巧的趴在枕边，只是，它们却再也等不回自己的主人。
此时窗外的阳光洒了进来，给这个凄凉的家庭带来了一丝温暖，父亲走向窗边，思念又让他的泪水又不住的流下来。
“父亲。。。”一个熟悉的声音在身后响起。
父亲震惊的转过头，看到一个无比熟悉的身影。
“我的孩子！”父亲激动的冲过去，一把抱住儿子，生怕再失去他。
“父亲，我是回来和你道别的，我要去陪妈妈了，她在那边很孤独。”可是儿子却轻轻回应着父亲的怀抱。
“我的儿子长大了。。。。。”父亲笑着，也哭着。
“再见了，爸爸，下辈子，我还做您的儿子。”一道光芒包裹住了儿子，父亲想要留下那道光芒，却发现最后自己手上不过留下了一块红色的残布。
那是儿子跌入海中被他抓住的残布
泪水再度流下，他知道，逝去的人，不会再回来。
父亲忍住悲伤，把那块布条轻轻放手，窗外的风儿也轻轻的接过布条，带着它飞向天边，飞向遥远的彼岸。

There are some nice ideas used in the puzzle designs, particularly with the play of light and shadows, that could make for a more fulfilling game. There are a number of collectables to find with additional exploration and/or level navigation to give this replay value.  The core game took me about 6 hours to complete, and I felt that's about the right value for the price.

What does make this game excel is the relatively simple story. It might be straight forward when you start, but the game uses a number of sublte tricks that lead to a great end-game twist. It is an emotional-driven story and the suprise at the end caught me off guard.  The music and setting all plays perfectly to that tone.

这游戏我玩了至少五周目。 优点就不多说了，场景体验感真的很棒，画面与BGM结合真的很像在旅游，不知不觉待在一个地方久久不愿走远。 每一个场景和剧情的结合也十分紧密，玩一场下来等于感受了人生的离合悲欢，引人深思。  在寻找隐藏物品时也犹如发现新大陆一般，每一个隐藏地点都是一次惊喜。  （所以真的不理解那些只喜欢赶路和一股脑找隐藏的人，只顾着登上山顶却忽略沿途美景，到头来又说这游戏无趣，很无语。）

但是它也有一些公认的缺点： 优化比较差，解谜也过于简单，比较影响游戏体验。所以还是应该加以改进，毕竟游戏的体验感才是第一位的！

+剧情构思巧妙，令人回味
+场景效果宏大震撼
+感染力强

-优化问题，掉帧严重
-解密过于简单，尤其是2，3章
-收集品意义不大，降低可玩性

Prince of Persia: Warrior Within - всё выше сказанное + прокачка, битвы с мобами (не самые простые и разнообразные), комбинации приёмов с разными оружиями, комнаты испытаний.

I finished the game after around 9 Hours and its my game of the year 2017!

Why?

- the graphic looks amazing
- the artdesign is in some way similiar overall, but then very different from location to location
- the puzzles are all very intuitiv and not too hard, or way too easy, so the fuid of playing is not quite fast
- exploration is hell of fun, as every location is huge and has a lot to offer in many ways
- the interactions are ot much, but somehow you find out very soon what you can do
- they way the game teach you how to do stuff is very intuitiv, you don't even recognize it (not text)
- there is also no HUD, no lifebar, just pure gamepla and graphic, which is very refreshing
- no talents, no exp to gain and no crafting, it sounds like a downside, but this is one of the parts why i looked forward toplay this game, it has no ballast
- the soundtrack is really well made, it suits perfectly the gameplay and also feeld rewarding when you find secretcs and progress in the game
- the emotional part is incredible, when you find your partner for your journey, when you met new creatures and if you part ways

I played 8-9 Hours and thought originaly i was going to finish the game in below 5 Hours, but i was so wrong, but i explored a lot while i didn't even found everything, only 1/2 of all secrets. 

The ending was expected from middle to finish, but i got the wrong person, so at the end it was a bit of a shocker and i was truly sad when i saw the final ending.

Tequila Works, iam so happy i played your game, it was in many ways one of the best experience i had.

If you like games like

- Abzu
- Journey
- Bound
- NaissanceE
- Ico
- Shadow of the Collosus

..you may like this game a lot, as it is in some ways similiar (pure gameplay, good soundtrack, fantastic and very special artdesign, intuitiv, not HUD) but still different enough to gain some new experience. 

Again, thank you very much for the great experience!

rime的美术风格还不错，大面积使用低纯度的颜色让画面看起来非常清新和舒适。有一些journey的影子。
游戏的地图设计也比较出色，某些关卡会重复使用一个区域但却不会单调。
但是谜题的设计总的来说并不让人满意，多数简单且经不起推敲，让人眼前一亮的谜题非常少。重复也很多，经常有解决一个谜题要跑很远的情况，比较单调，很麻烦，比如潜水那一段真的是有一点折磨，而谜题却非常无聊，稍微有地点玩不下去。
剧情来说较为平庸，不再剧透，大家自己体会。
游戏的优化有待提升，较为频繁地掉帧还是比较影响游戏体验的。

游戏的流程不是很长，在不刻意追求全收集及的情况下一个晚上就可以走完。还是建议一口气玩完，完整的体验还是会让人感受更深一点。虽然体验体验也不是很好。

个人认为游戏出色在代入感上。故事主角小男孩虽然不会说话，但却会根据剧情场景发出带有各种情绪的声音，这让人很容易和自己的情绪产生共鸣，将自己代入小男孩的角色里。印象中比较深刻的有小男孩踏入黑暗中，虽然恐惧得瑟瑟发抖，但是通过歌声可以照亮脚下的路。让我想起自己小时候害怕黑暗的时候，就和自己假想中的黑暗中的生物说话，交朋友，小声哼歌，就没有那么害怕了。其实所有孩子的心路历程应该都很类似，作者通过对孩子心理状态贴切的描画，让我们找回了心中那个充满童真的自己。

[b]剧情部分（含剧透）： [/b][spoiler] 作者通过一个巧妙的叙事方式来讲述这个悲伤的故事。这种叙事方式极易将我们带入角色：一个被海浪冲上岸的无助少年漫步在一个无人的充满神奇力量的岛屿，从最初的好奇兴奋（Don’t say no），恐惧愤怒(Unbearable)，努力尝试(Ask for miracle)，绝望悲伤(No hope)，到最后，得到记忆，知道自己无法回到现实与父亲重聚，接受自己已经死掉了的事实决定去往生的平静(Letting go)。就像是自己经历了一遍这所有的一切，我的心境也随着故事的发展起起伏伏。当画面最终回到小男孩生活过的房间，看到和这片岛屿上的一切有关的事物：狐狸抱枕，野猪玩具，天花板上的星星，门上的标识，窗户外的风景……一路走来的一切都在眼前浮现。最后，父亲回头看到了小男孩的影子，在最后的团聚中，小男孩带着不舍随风飘散。
值得注意的是【放手】这个动作。其实在游戏中很多次都有重点描写：父亲抓着小男孩最后留下的一片衣角，缓缓放手；站在悬崖边犹豫了很久最终跳下往生的小男孩，还有无法挽留的牺牲自己的机器人。包括故事的最后一个章节成就的名字【Letting go】也是这样，作者想让玩家去做出放手这个动作，让玩家自己体会放手背后无法言说的情感。让我想到之前玩【A bird story】的时候，最后要按下方向键将手上的鸟儿放飞，这个设计其实很犯规，让玩家来作出这个最艰难的动作，就好像做出决定的是我们自己一样，这背后的情感也自然附加到了我们身上，让我们真的能够感同身受。[/spoiler]
不过我想，这正是游戏作为第九艺术，其他艺术无法取代的独特魅力。它真正让我们成为主角去触摸作者所创造出的世界，感知其中的情感。

One large seamless, lovely world, full of moments of wonder. The puzzles, while not yet terribly difficult, are well-constructed, and the level-design has a great sense of flow. I'm rarely frustrated by puzzles or traversing the landscape, and there's very little backtracking.

Despite having a pretty similar control scheme to a 3D Legend of Zelda title, they've refined the controls to better fit a game filled with puzzles, but no enemies. While I'm a huge fan of Zelda games, Link seemingly has little regard for self-preservation, and likes to hurl himself off of every available ledge, whether I tell him to or not. Our nameless hero in Rime, on the other hand, notices ledges, and stops himself.

The music should be remarked upon as well. A mix of traditional and modern elements, with some beautiful cello work. It's wonderfully atmospheric, and makes you feel as if you're playing through a studio Ghibli film.

As for complaints, I have very, very few. Originally when I played, the camera was super buggy indoors, and would clip through walls, obscuring your view of the level and character. This has been fixed. It was also poorly optimized, and did not run well on my machine despite it exceeding the system requirements significantly. This too seems to have been fixed. There was, at one point, some sort of invasive DRM software. This was removed early on. The devs seem to be really responsive, and very much willing to fix issues in order to make the game a better experience for players.

　RiMEは三人称視点による3Dプラットフォーマーのパズルアドベンチャー。調べるとリリースまで相当紆余曲折があった模様。当初はMicrosoftの独占タイトルEchoes of Sirenとして開発されており、リジェクトされたのち、今度はSonyからPS4の独占タイトルとして発表。初めて公の場に姿を現したのは2013年のGamescomで、その後開発元のTequila Worksが著作権を買い戻してマルチプラットフォームとしてリリースに至った経緯がある。少なくともプロジェクト自体は2012年以前より稼働していたと見るのが適切ではないかと思われる。

　激しい嵐に見舞われたのち、柔らかな波打ち際に打ち上げられた少年が目を覚ますとそこは白い塔がそびえ立つ絶海の孤島だった。最初にプレイヤーに与えられる情報はこの程度の最小限なもので、何をすべきかどこを目指すべきなのか全くもって分からない。フィールドもそれなりに広く迷いそうに見える。ただ最後まで不思議と迷うことは無かった。一見広く見えるフィールドも、海から範囲外へ出ようとすると水母がいて押し戻されるように、移動できる範囲は存外狭く作られている。次に進む一歩を見失いかけたときに、石畳の道や岩壁の汚れきず、夜間に聳え立つ光の柱など、自然と移動しなければならない場所へと導く、露骨に主張しない巧みな視線誘導が感じられた。
　この感性はチュートリアルに対しても通ずるものがある。進行を中断する通過儀礼めいたチュートリアルはなく、初めて行う操作の折に操作方法を示すアイコンがすっと表示され、気になるオブジェクトにそっと光が添えられる。体験を阻害しないための配慮と美意識には感心した。

　美意識といえばビジュアルについて言及せずにはいられない。ゲームを開始して真っ先に感じたのは、ただただ吸い込まれるような空と海の青が美しいということ。トゥーン調のシェーディングと光沢が抑えられたマットな色彩は過度にリアルな印象を与えず、絵本の中のような不思議な世界観を構築するのに機能している。彩度が抑えられているゆえにジョルジョ・デ・キリコを思わせる白の塔がより一層映えて見えるし、昼夜のサイクルによってガラリと印象を変える表情の豊かさや、ライティングとそれによって生じる陰影が絵本のような平坦な絵柄に濃淡の深みを与えているといった影響を確認することができた。端的に言えば色の配置とコントラストによる魅せ方が上手であり、美しい。

　少年のアクションも実に洗練されている。基本的な操作としては走る・ジャンプ・転がる・叫ぶの4つしかなく、あとは地形との接触とパズル用オブジェクトへの干渉しかない。これらはコントローラーのアサインでいえばLスティック(Rスティックはカメラ操作であるがアクションの話なので割愛)と4つのボタンに集約され、肩にあるトリガーは使用しない。使用するボタン数を抑え、機能を集約したことでプレイヤーに強いる習熟コストを最低限のものにしている。殴ったり武器を振るう直接的な戦闘要素は存在せず、主軸である謎解きと探索に集中させる意図が操作体系からも読み取れる。
　アニメーションの遷移も滑らかで、移動操作だけでも少年は実によく演技するし、見ていて楽しい。ただパズルプラットフォーマーというジャンルの特性上、進行をスキップできるようなショートカットには細心の注意が払われているため、掴めない地形は絶対に掴めない。ちょっとした階段状の段差を横から登ろうとした際に横からよじ登ってくれればと期待したものの、お間抜けな垂直ジャンプが出て興が冷めることが何回かあった。あまり気にし過ぎることではないのかもしれないが、アニメーション遷移判定の細部が気になる人はいるかもしれない。

　パズルには賛否両論あると思う。なぜならそれほど難しくなく、大体は周辺をウロウロすることで完結することが多いからだ。より複雑なパズルを求める人にはこれは看過できない問題に見えるだろう。これは本作が進行に応じて後戻りできない作りであることに起因しているところも大きいが、意図してそう作られた背景があると見ている。パズル専用ゲームならまだしも本作はデモを含むシナリオ演出があり、それが動機となってプレイヤーをより没入させるための試練と報酬の構図がある。より力強くシナリオを押し進めるのであれば、一ヶ所に著しく長い時間拘束するのはテンポを損なう。だからちょっと頭を捻って少し考えたら解ける案配が最適解なのだと思う。実際ユーザーが参加できるコンテンツ作成型のゲームでは、そのコンテンツが極悪に難しいステージで溢れかえるのはよく見かける光景である、と言えばわかってもらえるだろうか。

　報酬としてイベントデモなどのシナリオ演出を挙げた。アンビエントなBGMが流れる中、パズルを解くとリアルタイムで不意にオーケストラのスコアがフェードインしてくる。ただパズルを解いただけで、行く先に思いを馳せるようなストリングスが響き、心の中が一気にざわめき立つ。この音に乗じ、美しいエフェクトを帯びた演出が始まる。抑えられた色彩ゆえにブルームの効いたエフェクトが一際目を惹くのは先述の通り。少し残念なのはリアルタイムで制御するゆえにデモスキップが見送られた点だろうか。ただそれでも本作のサウンドは掛け値なく美しいし、プレイヤーの背中を押してくれる力は強い。

　リトライのしやすさにも幾つか言及すべき点がある。アクションでありつつもゲームオーバーは存在せず、たとえ高所から落下したとしても最後に立っていた地形からすぐに復帰してゲームを再開できる。また進行に応じて要所要所でオートセーブが走り、巻き戻りが最低限に抑えられているのも特徴だ。収集要素は取得するごとに個別にセーブが入るため、取った時点で記録される。再開時は進行に応じたセクションの冒頭からとなるが、取ったアイテムは既に持った状態となっておりフィールドからは消えている。つまり普通に進める分にプレイヤーはいつでもやめたいときにやめられるように配慮されている。
　ただ問題としてセーブファイルが1つしかないことが挙げられる。これがオートセーブであること、後戻りできない作りであること、探索による収集要素が大量にあること、との相性が悪い。取り逃した収集要素を再度探しに行くことができないのだ。ゲームをクリアしたらステージセレクト(チャプタージャンプ)も用意されているのだが、1つのチャプターが長く冒頭からしかリプレイできない。コンティニューとしてゲームの再開時に適用されるセクションが、チャプタージャンプでは参照されないのは収集家を悩ませる種となっている。

　最後となったが、シナリオとプロットについて語る。本作ではUIこそローカライズされているものの、作中で一切意味の通じる言葉を喋らない。何もわからない状態で孤島に投げ出され、知らず知らずのうちに塔の頂上へ導かれるように進んでいく。その旅路の途中でお供となり得る者もいれど、決して話す言葉を持たない。そういう様子をプレイヤーが見ることで少年は今きっとこういう気持ちに違いないと感情や感性で少年との一体感、結束を強めていく。明確な示唆を持たないゆえに、プレイヤーの数だけこうかもしれないというストーリーを作り出していることに成功している。最終的に一定の示唆は与えられるが、それは是非最後までプレイして確認して欲しい。私は少し複雑な気持ちになったが、それでもこのシナリオが好きだ。


　何かを評する際にその指標として似たようなものを取り上げることはよくあることだ。ただ既視感に阻害されて自身の感性を放棄することはしたくない。既存の枠にとらわれることなく最後までプレイして感じてみて欲しい。私は本作を金字塔を打ち立てた偉大な先人達に負けず劣らずプレイすべき価値があると評する。近年は表現技術も向上し、時折胸をえぐるような体験をもたらすゲームに出くわすことが増えてきた。本作もそうしたゲームの一つで、だから私はゲームをプレイすることをやめられないのだ。",1503354335,1503400647,True,21,2,0.649004161357879639,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- PC优化很一般

原本是打算等Switch版出了再入的，不过最近刚好吃鸡卖包回血了不少，又刚好入了新的手柄，就入手了Steam版来玩。

开游戏就喜欢上了本作画面和配乐，称得上艺术品。常常玩游戏的过程中就忍不住狂按F12截图，最喜欢操作主角仰头看星空。

作为一个解密游戏，本作的解密难度其实并不高，整个游戏我只看了一两次攻略就可以自己摸索着全部搞定。虽然并不硬核，本作利用光影、声音来解密的设计依旧值得解密游戏爱好者一试。

剧情上本作完全不需要汉化。去下了3DM的汉化补丁，其实也就只有菜单需要汉化而已。剧情并不复杂，主要在最后一章揭示了剧情，感人而致郁。[spoiler] 主角之外需要的两个角色小狐狸和机器人都在帮助主角之后而逝去。两者逝去的画面玩的时候挺伤感的。[/spoiler]

很大的一点不足是PC端的优化很一般，会有掉帧或卡顿，这点很蛋疼。

整个游戏我花了7个小时就通关了（没有全收集），流程并不长。总之是值得一玩的游戏。",1503303702,1503303702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game play itself is not that overly difficult or challenging, but I don't think it that type of game anyway. I think the game is more relaxing and even meditative at times, I truly was in awe of the music and visuals at times.

Overall the story is quite profound and also a little sad. Something about the whole game just spoke to me, I honestly think it had some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard in game. 

I would highly recommend people give this game a chance. And ignore the negative reviews from some people. I think the game when combining the visuals, the beautiful soundtrack and the moving story comes together to form a master piece.

딱히 대사라던지 자막이 없어서 메뉴선택지(Setting, Resume 이런거요!)만 읽으실 수 있다면 그냥 진행하셔도 전혀 문제 없습니다! 플레이 중엔 언어관련으로 아무것도 안나와요!

처음에 난이도 어렵다는(난해하다는) 후기를 보고 살까말까 고민하다가 트레일러의 그래픽과 사운드 믿고 질렀는데, 저 세상에 이렇게 친절한 퍼즐게임 처음입니다.
고민하다보면 반드시 해답이 있고요 힌트도 많습니다. 아무래도 스토리에 중점이 있어서 그런듯합니다.
굳이 조언드리자면 [이유없는 힌트는 없다.]정도 드리고 싶네요!

친절한 난이도의(쉽다는 뜻은 아닙니다. 적절하다고 생각됩니다)퍼즐,
플레이 내내 눈이 호강하는 그래픽,
여운과 감동을 남기는 스토리, 
그리고 편안하고 아름다운 음악.
3 조화로 n시간동안 시간가는줄 모르고 어제 밤새 했네요..오늘부턴 도전과제합니다.

볼륨이 큰 여타 게임에 비교하면 플레이타임이 짧다고 여겨질 수도 있겠습니다만, 저는 값어치를 했다는 생각이 더 크게 듭니다. 
나는 게임에 할 게 많아야 해! 오픈월드 원한다! 하시는 분에게는 비추일 수도 있겠네요.
하지만 그래픽과 사운드와 스토리가 (정말로) 열일합니다. 이쪽 좋아하시는 분들께 강추..

개인적으로 (당연하다면 당연하지만)게임패드쪽이 조작감이 좋습니다 아무래도 키보드는 대각선 이동이 힘든데 이 게임 걸을 때마다 카메라시점이 자동으로 움직이거든요! 천천히 진행하시면 아무 상관 없습니다만 키보드로 쭉~~~~~ !빠르게! 이동하려고 생각하시면 바뀌는 시점 탓에 아주 약~~간 답답하실수도! (그래서 전 재빠르게 패드로 갈아탔습니다)
그래도 조작감 나쁜 편은 아닙니다. 카메라 강제이동만 빼면 매우 친절해요! A에서 B로 뛰어야할 때 <가능한 지역>이라면 99%성공합니다!(1% = 실수로 너무 일찍 혹은 늦게 잘못 뜀)
제가! A~B점프로 nn번 트라이 해야하는 게임을 하다와서 그런지! 이렇게 편할수가! 없어요! 좋은 게임입니다.
최적화랑 렉이야기가 있어서 약간 걱정했는데 전 렉도 거의 없었어요.(닥소3, 위쳐3, 압주의 최저사양이 그럭저럭 돌아가는 컴입니다) 사운드가 한 두번 지직거렸나? 전혀 문제될 정도는 아니었습니다. 편안한 플레이였어요.

쓸만큼 쓴거 같네요! 다시 겜하러 가야지. 선택에 도움이 되었길 바라며 즐거운 게임사는 시간되십시어..!

Rime, c'est une histoire poétique mêlant imaginaire enfantin et psychologie humaine. Une merveilleuse aventure aux allures de conte. Un subtil mélange de références : les mystérieuses cités d'or, Atlantide, Zelda et plus largement les civilisations mayas et égyptiennes. 

Comme d'autres jeux avant lui (notamment Abzû), le récit sera délivré au travers du décor, d'éléments parfois VRAIMENT bien cachés. Nul dialogue : tout est dans l'observation.

Les musiques, quant à elles, vous envoûteront dès les premières notes pour vous plonger dans de somptueux niveaux.

Et cette fin... un plotwist qui vaut clairement le détour ! Je ne peux pas tellement en dire plus, de peur de vous gâcher l'expérience. Mais en tout cas, Rime est réellement une belle occasion de voyager en un ailleurs somptueux et riche en émotions. 

GAMEPLAY

Côté gameplay, ne vous attendez pas à des énigmes alambiquées. Elles invoqueront bien souvent le temps, l'ombre et la lumière, ainsi qu'une logique de placements d'objets. Peut-être un ou deux puzzles plus ardus qu'à l'accoutumée... mais rien de bien sorcier en somme.

La principale difficulté réside dans la recherche des fragments, trous de serrure, habits, etc. Mais ne vous en faites pas, si vous loupez certains d'entre eux, vous aurez la possibilité de rejouer les différents chapitres en fin de partie. Ce qui est plutôt pratique au vu de certains chemins devenant par la suite inaccessibles... de quoi vous faire recommencer encore et encore ! De même, des succès s'activeront après certaines interactions pas forcément évidentes. Donc vraiment, soyez attentif à votre environnement, ouvrez l'oeil ; ce dernier recèle quantité de chemins cachés et d'actions dissimulées. 

POINTS NOIRS 

Un souci d'optimisation graphique qui peut vous occasionner quelques lags. Pour une bonne config comme la mienne, je n'ai pas pu profiter de l'ultra, ce qui est assez dommage car la différence est assez nette. Ce sera très certainement mon seul gros point noir. 

Pour ce qui est de la durée de vie, elle me semble satisfaisante. Plus longue et cela aurait pu devenir bien vite redondant. Par contre, si vous rushez, vous pouvez facilement diviser votre temps de jeu par 2. Et ça, peut-être que ça en gênera quelques uns. 

Enfin, pour chipoter, certains chemins sont vraiment compliqués à discerner. Notamment celui menant à la fin alternative (enfin, je dis ""fin alternative"" mais ce n'est en vérité qu'un seul élément qui apparaîtra lors de la scène finale, vous donnant droit à un succès).

I mainly play FPS's and open world/survival type games, and wanted a break from the norm. 

This game is simply beautiful. It is a linear game but tells a great story with no dialogue, and there is always beautiful music and visuals every second of gameplay. The puzzles in the game aren't too difficult, but I have found myself stuck in rooms for 15 minutes trying to figure them out - they are very creative and clever. I noticed that some reviews said this game has little storytelling, but if you pay attention to all the details (i mean ALL of the details) while playing this, you'll find out it has a very compelling story of an island that once thrived with life. And this game tells that story very well without saying a word. It's very hard to find games as well made as this these days with how saturated the market is with endless indie games and open alphas. I highly recommend this game.

£20 (on sale) is about right for this title. I finished it in around 5 hours, although I'll admit I didn't hunt every corner for every secret, I ended with about half. 

My first impressions of the game itself were rather breathtaking. I love this style of graphics design, and the music really shone out as exceptional. I don't normally give too much attention to music in games, as frequently its mainly an annoyance. However much like Little Inferno, the music in RiME drastically added to the game, and it really one of its greatest features. The music brought out emotions (to the point of, I was worried I was going to cry!) that completely immerse you in what is going on. 

The gameplay itself was fun, although not ground breaking, I enjoyed it for the mostpart. Some of the puzzles get quite repetitive in areas although it was not overly noticable whilst playing through, more an afterthought after completing the game. The sidequest of collecting toys, looking through keyholes etc seemed pointless whilst playing. It wasn't until I finished that I regretted not getting all of them.

The real selling point of this game is the story (which is heavilly complimented by the musical score).
As someone who does not generally play single players, and extremely rarely cares about story, I feel RiME shines brightly. 
It doesn't really start coming together until towards the end of the game, which is where you can begin to put all the pieces together, and as there is no dialog in the game, that in itself is difficult to do until you have actually finished. However this adds a wonderful mysticism about the game.
The fox annoyed me most of way through, and I suspect I'm not the only person who told it to 'shut up' on multiple occasions as it was barking at me while I was trying to find another toy. However by the end of the story which I will not ruin, I found it to be such a compelling character, I almost felt more attached to it than the protagonist. 
The mechs are a good example of something which shouldn't have worked, which did spectactularly (if that makes sense?). 
The first mech to come to life in the game, confused me to no end, it didn't make sense in the world I was in (and to be frank... still doesn't?). However it did not take long at all for me to be emotionally attached to the mech I had just saved, and the following level(s) with their company gaved me a lot of satisfaction, and heart-break.

There are negatives about the game however:
-It is very poorly optimised for PC - I had a lot of frame drops (1080gtx) 
-Camera control is sluggish, and in areas, completely frustrating
-Jumping can be just as frustrating (mainly wall-wall jumps)
-I have some continutity issues with the story telling - The 'character' in the red cloak just stops appearing about half way through with no reasoning (unless I missed it) 
-The angry bird - There didn't seem to be an explanation of what it was/represented at the end, which I was acutely dissapointed about (again, unless I somehow missed it)

In summary, I would pay £20 for this again, however would be reluctant to suggest it to a friend for more.

The core of games like this - light on gameplay/puzzles, more focused on presentation - is the general atmosphere and story. Both need to be great for the overall experience to be good, and while I enjoyed [I]RiME[/I] deeply while playing it, after the ending and with some reflection I'm really not sure what to think.

Starting with the good, the art design and music is excellent. Levels are well thought out and designed to seem as if they actually exist. Each stage is self-contained but all aspects of that stage are consistent with the boundaries that we can see - nothing seems to exist in hammerspace as it were. There's tidbits of story that exist as murals and miscellaneous architecture and given the rather esoteric nature of the beginning plot finding these is its own reward. There's also a decent number of collectibles for those that like treasure hunting.

The issue I have with [I]RiME[/I] comes from its ending. My view is somewhat hard to explain without spoilers, but essentially the entirety of the game is a red herring. After the ending the intended symbolism of the levels is explained directly, but even still the details of the levels don't fit with the ending. That's not really too big of a deal in of itself, but I feel that if the details of the levels actually did relate directly to the story the game would have been better for it, and it still would be possible to implement the ending that's already there. When examined independently the ending isn't particularly weak - in fact I think it gives an excellent message and that message is treated with care - there's just wasted potential when there was obviously the opportunity for a more detailed setting and story that could have been told while also keeping the original moral.

I'm still not sure if I would recommend [I]RiME[/I] or not. It's not a game that I have any interest in replaying, but I don't regret the experience either. I suppose that's enough.",1502828718,1502834478,True,13,1,0.618701756000518799,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Todo en conjunto hace de este título una cautivadora aventura en un paraje mediterráneo. Su banda sonora, su apartado artístico, su trama y su jugabilidad, lo convierten en un imprescindible de este año, o quizás de la década.

Solo unos pocos me han emocionado, pero con [i] RiME	[/i] me he visto por encima de esa experiencia, llegando a sentir algo que ni [i] Brothers: A tale of two sons	[/i] consiguió ni creo que otra obra lo haga jamás. Podríamos decir que este juego desprende más pasión que la planteada por los desarrolladores del mismo.	

[h1] Análisis sin destripe	[/h1]

Debería hacer una reseña en frío, pero me ha entusiasmado tanto esta mágica y emotiva aventura, que he decidido analizarlo desde mi más cercana experiencia cronológica, pues es un título que puede variar su propuesta según tu estado, ya sea solo o acompañado, al jugarlo prestando atención al detalle, etc.

Respecto a la jugabilidad, en principio aparenta simpleza, pero la mecánica de utilizar la voz del protagonista es tan única que convierten una aventura con plataformas sencillas en un mundo construido a base de puzles. Arrastraremos bloques, ""cantaremos"" y nos moveremos cual marsupial en la jungla por los salientes, todo con un detalle impresionante. 

La primera ver que vi a la [i] IA	[/i] me quedé atónito de lo impresionante que es. No sé si dependerá del motor gráfico, que es el [i] Unreal Engine 4, 	[/i] pero igualmente nos hará sentir como niños curiosos, tal como mencionaron los creadores. El mundo nos guía como un chavalín a la aventura, cada vez más inmersiva.

Con relación a el apartado técnico, [i] RiME	[/i] no pretende ser un portento gráfico en ningún momento, y para ello lo demuestra mediante su apartado artístico, que es lo que dota de identidad a los mejores títulos. Sin esa belleza de dibujos, que pueden semejarse al espléndido [i] The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild, 	[/i] no cautivaría lo mismo.  

Todo este cuidado al mínimo, tanto los cangrejos de la playa como el fondo submarino, pasando rayos de luz desde el agua más bella que he visto, a excepción del océano de [i] Sea of Thieves. 	[/i] Ello acompañado de unas animaciones espectaculares me incitan a revivir esos grandiosos escenarios, sobre todo los de lluvia, que, para mí, son los más destacables.

En cuanto a la trama, es una parte esencial del videojuego, y los señores de [i] Tequila Works, 	[/i] la desarrolladora, saben cómo contarnos una historia sin palabras. Esta empresa española está formada por exempleados de maravillosos estudios como [i] Blizzard Entertainment	[/i] (algo cuestionable según quienes), [i] MercurySteam	[/i] (creadores de [i] Castlevania: Lords of Shadow) 	[/i] y otros estudios. Esto es perceptible a la hora de llevarnos por la senda de la exploración, la cual nos incitará a descubrir más sobre esta inédita historia, con un trágico final que resultará en algún que otro sollozo.

En lo relativo al apartado sonoro, podría ser catalogado como la mayor identidad del título. Desde el comienzo hasta el final, nos acompañará la excelente banda sonora y los redundantes efectos de sonido que convertirán nuestro camino en toda una experiencia.

Absolutamente digo y diré, que es una de las mejores, aunque hay otras muy destacables también, bandas sonoras que he escuchado en mi corta vida. Emotiva cuando debe serlo, cautivadora, y, por supuesto, trágica en los mejores momentos. Asimismo, los efectos de sonido son una delicia. Desde los pequeños pasos del chico, hasta el briznar de la lluvia o el soplido del viento en la naturaleza son meros ejemplos que se extienden a lo más mínimo del plano.

En conclusión, creo haber conseguido englobar [i] RiME	[/i] en esta minúscula reseña, que ha pasado a ser una de mis obras preferidas por siempre. Viví de todo: curiosidad, impresión, alegría, tristeza y lo principal, lo he vivido yo, así como tú también deberías.

It looks really nice, the graphics are clean with excellent lighting and a lot of attention has been spent on the artistic side. The sounds and music all fit very well and add to the immersion. 

I knew what to expect before I bought this, it's more or less a linear walking simulator with some puzzle elements and some minor storytelling. A bit like Abzu you could say.

So why am I still giving it a negative review?
- It's rather short for the price.
- not good optimized for PC, I'm getting a lot of fps drops which really break the immersion, even on lowest settings. (I can run games like DOOM and KF2 on very high-ultra without fps drops)
- It can be a bit boring at times, there is no action and not a lot of life in the game (unlike abzu which is brimming with life).
- navigating the character can be a bit tricky sometimes.


I do recommend it to people who like:
-pretty and relaxing games,
-exploring ruins,
-mediterranean climate,

but I would wait untill the price drops

Lo mejor que pudo hacer SONY fue perder los derechos del juego, si no lo hubiera hecho no hubiese podido disfrutar de esta grandiosa aventura. La sombra de la cancelación ha estado rondando muchísimo tiempo, demasiado tal vez.
Quizás RiME no sea un juego de los que te llevarías a una isla (a pesar de que se desarrolla en una), quizás no esté en ningún Top-algo de casi ningún jugador. Quizás no sea ese juego que le guste a todo el mundo... Pero, eso... quizás.
No considero a RiME como un superventas, ojalá lo sea porque realmente se lo merece, pero pienso que es de esos juegos que todo jugador debería de jugar al menos una vez en su vida. Pocos juegos de este tipo, creado con mucha pasión se hacen estos días.
Lo primero que entra por los sentidos es el estilo gráfico e inmediatamente después es la música, sublime para mi gusto. RiME quizás no se pueda entender o jugar igual sin la música que lo acompaña.
Me parece increíble como los chicos de Tequila han contado una historia sin usar ni siquiera unas breves líneas de texto.
Cierto es que recuerda en parte a Journey o a ICO e incluso a The Last Guardian, pero RiME tiene una identidad propia que los hace a la vez muy distintos a los títulos mencionados.
Los primeros compases de RiME sean probablemente los más sencillos del juego y nos sirven para poder aprender los controles. Éstos son muy básicos ya que sólo usamos tres botones y los sticks. Los primeros puzles que nos pone el juego nos dan una idea de que, sin llegar a ser complejos, nos va a poner a pensar un poco con bastante frecuencia. 
He de decir que la resolución de todos los puzles está en la misma habitación, casi siempre a la misma altura o en la planta superior. La primera zona es llamativa con árboles y sombras y una maravillosa playa para nosotros solos. El pequeño zorro que pronto se nos une (su misión es parecer para indicarnos a dónde ir para a continuación desaparecer) consigue que le cojas cariño y te alegras cada vez que lo encuentras de nuevo.
Gráficamente el juego luce bastante y bien y va muy fuído, aunque he sufrido un bug que me ha hecho perder no más de cinco minutos.
El sonido fx es correcto, pero sin duda, lo mejor del juego esla música, al menos para mí. Y, es que como he dicho antes no concibo RiME sin su banda sonora. Simplemente de las quince mejores soundtracks de juegos de todos los tiempos. Se adapta como un guante a lo que se está viendo en pantalla en todo momento.
Los puzles a medida que vamos avanzando van haciendo que tengamos que pensar un poco más, pero no llegan a ser desesperantes y una vez que los superas te das cuenta de que no son para tanto y que con un poco de intuición y picardía no son realmente difíciles.
Si el apartado gráfico es bonito, sin duda es en parte por los escenarios que componen el juego. Desde la playa del comienzo a la zona del diluvio universal (por lo menos lo parece) del final son paisajes realmente bellos. La zona submarina está muy lograda y es realmente bella, sin embargo, la zona del desierto ha sido la zona que menos me ha gustado.
Las cinco zonas del juego, o los cinco estados (cuando os paséis el juego lo entenderéis), están bien realizadas y tienen arquitectura y estilos distintos. Comenzamos en una paradisíaca playa, para dar paso a una zona desierta que nos lleva hasta una zona bajo las aguas para llegar a una zona de arboleda interior que nos lleva a una zona, la final, que llueve a mares. El agua de ésta última zona está representada de una manera muy realista. 
Los dos aspectos negativos que le he encontrado es que no se puede tener más de una partida a la vez. Es decir, si yo empiezo una partida, mi hija o sigue por donde voy o empieza una nueva borrándome todo lo avanzado. Y el segundo, y esto es una opinión personal, es el final.
¿Qué les pasa últimamente a los que diseñan las historias? Sinceramente creo que esta historia merecía un final más… Otro final.
Como nota yo le daría un 8.5 ya que, aunque sublime, tiene unas mínimas carencias que lo hubiesen encumbrado al olimpo de los videojuegos actuales. 
Muy bueno, pero levemente mejorable. Para los autores: Por favor cambiad el final.

There, consider that something of an... I don't know. Disclaimer? Anyway, now that that's out of the way, the actual review.

RiME is a game about a boy (or a very tomboyish girl? I'm not 100% sure about this), who wakes up on a beach and explores a brightly coloured and mystical island full of ancient ruins, colourful vistas, clever little puzzles and cute cuddly-wuddly animal-friends. It's all nice and lovely to start off with, but as the very start of this review may have clued you in: the game takes some dark turns. Personally I have to say I didn't enjoy the change in tone, although I cannot say it was poorly executed or anything. Just... not my thing. 

Visually the game is gorgeous, although even with a GTX 1080 I couldn't manage to wring out a steady 60 fps out of the game. The animations are fluid and detailed, the environments are full of life and hidden secrets to discover. All of this is enveloped in a lovely ambient soundtrac and some perfectly pleasant SFX work. 

The platforming is fairly basic, mostly ledge climbing with very few, if any, options allowing for the player to make mistakes. The game feels like it was made to toe the line between a walking simulator and a proper puzzle platformer, so don't expect any headache inducingly difficult puzzles here. 

All in all, I enjoyed the vast majority of RiME greatly and would recommend it, save for one thing. It's a SPOILER so I hid it down, below the meaningless scores.

I just finished playing it, took me about 6 hours over a couple of days (it felt longer), and am very moved emotionally.

I have been a gamer since the start, and this is one of the most beautiful games I have played, it gave me goosebumps on several occasions.

At its heart it is a puzzle game, and the puzzles are the right amount of difficulty IMO, some can leave you thinking a bit, but not enough to have to run off to Youtube to find a walkthrough.

To me it felt similar to an early Tomb Raider or Prince of Persia, but without the combat.  (You've got no weapons, but starting in level 3-ish there are things actively trying to hinder you.  Most of the game, no arcade reaction skills are required.  There's also never a big penalty for missteps, just a minor rewind to a safe location.)
There's a pleasant differentiation between the five main levels, both visually and through the addition of new (sometimes minor, sometimes major) gameplay elements.
It might be worth noting that there's no in-game map, despite some huge locations. But there was sufficient visual differentiation (and landmarks) that I never felt lost. 
This is a very pretty game, and despite a lack of true speech (nonsense sounds are used, but they convey plenty of emotion), it manages to tug one's heartstrings.

I can see why both Sony and Microsoft dropped this game as an exclusive. Rime is a glorified running simulator, the games vast areas have you running from point A to point B solving annoying puzzles where, get this, the boy has to scream at statues?! There is basic platforming along the way that would make Mr Drake raise an eyebrow. The game can't decide whether its trying to ape Ico or Zelda and fails at both spectacularly. Also starring a creepy bird and nosey fox, Rime has a weird latency problem with its controller responsiveness, everything felt slow and laggy despite running at the supposed 60fps. I had to use Steam's controller config to reduce the analog stick's dead zone to the point where even a teeny nudge had the character do a sprint, that's how frustrated I was with the controls.

Didn't take me too long to finish the game but I had to force myself to the finish line, there is no point to exploring, no other meaningful gameplay, its pretty much 70% running, 20% screaming and 10% jumping. That's all there is. The one positive, the game has good music that can sometimes be downright amazing, gave me strange Tomb Raider Underworld music vibes.

Don't play this one if you're depressed.

The puzzles in this game are environmental/atmospheric - figure out how to get to this place, move this object a certain way, what can I drag to put on this floorplate switch - that sort of thing. You will not suddenly have to stop and break story to do a math or logic puzzle. Platforming elements are jumping and ledging; grabbable ledges are always very clearly marked by what some sites and walkthroughs call ""chalk marks"" but to me looked like bird droppings. I am a lousy jumper and I only missed maybe one jump in the course of the whole game, so that should tell you how forgiving the jumping is.

You don't get voluntary saves; the game saves at checkpoints (look for the shell icon to appear at the top right corner of the screen briefly). They're frequent enough, and it's hard enough to mess up, that this isn't much of a problem in practice. Note that there ARE one or two places where you can blow past a collectable or achievement easily and you won't get another chance at it without replaying the game - which would likely be pretty tedious, once you've seen it all once you likely won't want to see it again.

The only annoying decision is that the game sometimes locks you into a particular fixed camera angle for whatever perverse reason of its own, and this can make some of the jumping and so on in that area much harder. Also, if you're playing with keyboard you'll find that the keys change depending on your orientation, so you ledge around a corner by pressing D, then stop moving for a moment, and now the direction you were going is ""up"" so if want to keep going that way, now you press W. This matters for backward jumps in particular. Fortunately, the character gives good visual cues, looking over his shoulder when he's ready for a backward jump or reaching out to the side when he's poised to jump sideways to another ledge.

Also, some of those fixed camera angles require you to move diagonally with precision, particularly two long bridges where you could easily fall off, and this is nearly impossible with a keyboard. Bottom line: Playing with a controller is probably better.

I wish there were more games like these!

since the games seem so comparable in my mind, I may as well compare them more: RiME is a little more platform-y and puzzle-y than ABZU, but never anything that requires any crazy reflexes. both have lots of hidden goodies to find, and they're hard! when you find one, you feel good and smart. RiME is a longer game. I do not believe that more length == more value, but having said that, RiME is not longer because it's padding the gameplay with mindless tasks; I feel like the game is constantly throwing new mechanics, or settings, or... ""characters""? at me. which is great! I keep thinking ""surely this is the end,"" but it's not, and there's yet more cool stuff I've never seen before!

the only bad thing I'll say about RiME is that it has a couple things that make me go ""did they have to rush this part?"" the menu has some weird issues (every time you go into the controller settings, it reverts to keyboard, even if you've previously selected gamepad), and the swimming controls are a little janky? they're fine, it just feels less polished than the swim mechanics of most 3rd-person action games, and it's weird to see that when the rest of the game is blowing my mind on so many other fronts. maybe they just decided their time was better spent on the game itself. or maybe the keyboard+mouse swimming is PERFECT - I haven't tried it. who knows!

again, it's a super-minor point. this game is beautiful; it's amazing. the world feels like something out of a Miyazaki movie. I recommend it 100%. play RiME. play ABZU.",1500691088,1500691312,True,5,0,0.544678092002868652,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love Ico is one of my most beloved games of all time, so the Ico associations that well up inside of me while playing RiME, is just a really nice thing, but that should not suggest that RiME does not have it's own charm and originality, because it truly does.

The world of RiME is absolutely gorgeous and nothing like the dark setting of Ueda games, even though i love that.
It has beautiful cartoonish/wind waker type graphics, and the world is very big for a puzzle game!

The often breathtaking scenery and charming but also melancholic score left me in awe several times!

The music is mostly playfull and contemplative piano pieces often accompanied by strings.

While there is no leitmotif to speak of, the music sort of reflects the game worlds free roaming spirit, but will often break out into grander themes in tanden with what you are doing in the game! So the game often responds to you by lifting the music and tempo and harmony up a notch or two!

Sometimes the music felt very inspired by Joe Hisaishi, there is almost the main theme for ""Mononoke Hime"" in there, but hey, that's not a bad thing, not a bad thing at all!

Solo por eso ya merece la atención de mucha gente que busca algo diferente y original. 

En lo jugable no es innovador en nada, no hay practicamente acción, nuestro personaje solo puede saltar y pegar un grito, que es como interactua con el entorno. Pero por contra esta plagado de puzzles muy variados que nos hacen usar un poco la matéria gris. Ya sean jugando con sombras, con objetos en diferentes posiciones, jugando con la perspectiva etcétera.

Por otro lado tenemos las plataformas, que es el típico sistema de subir por paredes o saltar a diferentes repisas de distintos niveles, pero realizados con un nivel sublime, que se te hace cómodo e intuitivo desde el primer segundo y con la cámara perfectamente ubicada, sin problemas de saltar cuando no debe, ni ""muertes"" por caída inesperada como en muchas otras aventuras. Si habéis jugado a ICO o Shadow of the Colosss, es un muy buen ejemplo para compararlo.

En lo gráfico, yo creo que es donde mas destaca RIME. Es un estilo parecido a los dibujos, con colores pastel muy al estilo de Journey, con un diseño de decorados brutal, dónde no tenemos mapa ni falta que nos hace. Lo cual nos quiere decir lo bien diseñados que esan, porque al igual que DARK SOULS, no lo necesitamos ya que no nos vamos a perder en eningún momento. Y si así fuera, no aparece un amigo que nos acompaña toda la aventura, que es un zorro muy simpático que nos ayuda con sus ladridos.

RIME no es un videojuego para niños, porque es probable que no entiendas la metáfora que nos pretende transmitir y que iremos entendiendo a medida que lleguemos a los compases finales de la aventura, que es cuando atamos cabos y entendemos el porque de cada zona y entendemos a su vez el motivo de la aventura y lo que nos ha querido explicar.

Al principio cuesta un poco entrar en su mundo. El movimiento del personaje se puede hacer un poco tosco, empiezas en una playa en la que nadie te dice nada y no sabes por dónde ir... 

Al menos a mí me paso eso, me costó un poco entrar en la historia, pero poco a poco el juego me fue enganchando y metiendo en su ambiente, las mecánicas se van descubriendo por sí mismas si eres un poco paciente y al final la historia se abre ante ti y termina sobrecogiéndote y arrugando el corazón.

Desde luego es uno de los mejores juegos españoles a los que he jugado, eso sin ninguna duda.
Hay toques evidentes del Team Ico, del Studio Guibli y de todo ese tipo de contar una historia sin tomarte por tonto, que sea el propio jugador el que con sus actos y su exploración vaya entendiendo todo.

La banda sonora me ha recordado mucho al gran maestro japonés  Joe Hisaishi, han hecho un trabajo excelente.
Al principio pensé que era una pena que Sony se hubiera bajado del proyecto y no confiara en este estudio, pero con este juego demuestran que hay mucho talento e ideas muy muy buenas, así que me alegro un montón de que hayan podido sacarlo adelante y que esté teniendo el reconocimiento mundial que está teniendo.

Current PC scenario, pre-ordering a product is absolutely the most riskiest decision to make. I still did it, 

Day 1 - So many bugs, Screen Tearing all over the place inspite of keeping V-sync, on and Double buffering on in the settings.

Patch 1.01; Still lots of issues were faced, lot of people started asking for Refunds, especially some users wrong mouthed the developer in the Steam forum {Darius].

Patch 1.02; A little better but not the best, at least the Framerates were a bit stable

Patch 1.03; Denuvo was cracked , and so Denuvo was removed with this patch, the game performed a lot better inspite of RiME developer Darius stating that Denuvo didn't hamper performance.

Final Patch {My Guess} 1.04 ; The game now runs beautifully and some settings like Bloom and Depth of Field are off Defualt, so far its runs smoothly.

Despite all these issues and Intial negativity, let us all as Gamers get this clear, regarding these issues, RiME,,,,RiME is a Beautiful Masterpiece !!! Nothing else to say....... Throughout the game the soundtrack was the highlight, how beautiful it is too listen, the ambience it creates, the atmosphere that is produced, is impecable ! 

Into; 

Stage 1 (Denial) ; The breathtaking view we all see in the beginning of the Story, is absolutely Beautiful , stunning and Interesting to explore !! Gameplay asthetics are very cute like throwing the fruit at the Pigs so they leave a way for you to shout at the statues, Foxy companion is so cute !! Love it !! 

But the issue i had, Puzzles were very  Easy ....too Easy...maybe they were targeting even  younger generation Kids to play.

Stage 2 (Anger) ; This stage is interesting for Puzzles and the Big Bird boss battle , the atmosphere here is searing scorching hot dessert like atmosphere, the story drags you into a rutheless scenario.

Here we were having lot of framedrops in this level, but its fixed now !

Stage 3 (Bargaining) ; The atmosphere completley changes as soon as this stage begins as you end up in a foresty area, feels like we are inlands of the island ! 

The main problem i had with this stage was the Achievement 'Hold your Breath' where we restrict ourself when swimming to 1 bubble of air as we go underwater and pop up on the other side ! so many retries, it was crazy...But i achieved it !!! 

{BTW; All my Indie games has a 100% completion rate in terms of Achievements]

Stage 4 (Depression) ; This is by far the Stage when Sadness hits us as everyone we know and our Knowledge of ourselves, starts to vanish, the Wet Rainy atmosphere, the melancholy soundtrack, and the depressing boys emotions starts to hit you before the final stage.....

Stage 5 ( Acceptance) ; This is the ending , shocking Revelation !!!! This makes you realize the way we viewed the story was actually from a totally different scenario, a Different Perspective as the Realistion hits us on what happened actually ......Its so emotional, there are two endings , the alternative ending is the best one and you can achieve it by getting the White shade achievement ( Sweet Memory). Now is when most people start crying !!! 

At the end of this game, you can now unlock each stage individually !

This is when to all the people who had asked a refund made a BIG Mistake !!!!! 

Thank you Tequilla Works, Greybox for publishing this game and Unreal 4 Engine for bringing this game to light !!!! 

Thank you Darius and Rubio for this Masterpiece !!! Never regretted Pre-ordering this game !

Le gameplay est simple et se résume au strict minimum : se déplacer, crier et intéragir avec des objets.

Après honnètement RiME n'a pas été une révélation ou une baffe pour moi non plus, seuls les thèmes musicaux, la construction et la fin (et l'émotion) sont réellement excellents.

It took me around 9 hours to finish the game and I found a bit more than half of the secrets... so there are some more hours in it for me.

Rime manages to stay interesting and never puts you in situations that feel tedious or unmanagable. And you are gently guided by your little fox companion, if you ever get a bit lost.

The soundtrack is also great and reminded me a bit of Journey. (In a good way)
Combined with the optical style of the game it never gets old to look at the scenery.

You are tasked with exploring and solving puzzles inside a dreamy set of landscapes in order to unfold the real reason behind your journey; the contemplation of the incredible level design is of course an integral part of the experience but RiME, unlike the aforementioned games, offers a very satisfying and layered exploration gameplay which at times resembles the popular ""Legend Of Zelda"" saga.
The worlds you are going to visit aren't simply vast corridors to traverse, but intricate sets of structures filled with collectables, secret passages, hidden treasures and very engaging puzzles.

Just like the previously mentioned ""Zelda"" saga, RiME offers some very pleasent puzzles which won't prove to be too hard to solve, but most of them definitely showcase some very clever designs, especially when it comes to the handling of light sources.
I'm not saying more on that simply to avoid giving spoilers.

Since the very beginning of the game it's clear that most of the areas are very vast and intricate, and sometimes you are even treated with some breathless views of the landscape you just traversed; it feels like exploring ""small"" worlds, rather than separate maps, and the level design is alkways top notch.

Of course the second biggest appealing factor of the game are the ""dreamlike"" qualities of the experience itself; the worlds you are going to traverse whisper to you of ancient worlds, mind abstractions and physical manifestations of fears, ranging from ancient ruins caressed by the sun, to shady hallways roamed by dark spirits, and while you'll be busy taking in all of this, a superbly melancholic soundtrack will guide you to the end of the adventure.

It can't be denied that RiME is a game that is made with and speaks to the heart but, while still recommended, I have to describe its evident shotrcomings.
The game is simply a bit rough on the technical side; the graphics themselves are delightful, but the game simply doesn't seem to run well, not even if you have a decent PC or try to be humble with the antialiasing and such.
A recent patch made things better and there's no Denuvop working in the background anymore, but unless you lower all the settings you have to be prepared for some stuttering here and there.
Also some of the game aspects, like the climbing mechanics (not featured that much, fortunately) aren't nearly as smooth as in ""Uncharted"" or ""Tomb Raider"", leading to a couple of frustrating moments, when the character doesn't respond exactly as intended.

If you don't mind a couple of rough spots I still highly recommend playing RiME, especially because it shows that you don't always need to sacrifice gameplay to create an engaging dreamlike experience.

Pros:

- Intricate and vast level design
- Delightful graphics and style
- Captivating melancholic feel
- Real exploration of the environments
- Very original puzzles
- Misterious and dreamlike
- Nice rythm
- Fun to play as well as to ""experience""

Cons:
- Technically rough (It simply doesn't run very well)
- Imprecise controls

-El como han enfocado la historia y en mantener la intriga hasta el final.
-El apartado artístico y sonoro, es un juego muy contemplativo.
-Que no haya nada en el hud
-La ambientación 
-Los puzzles (Aunque son fáciles)


Lo que no me ha gustado:

-Pequeños fallos de programación 


Conclusión:

Se lo recomiendo a todas las personas que disfrutaron con ICO porque le encuentro muy parecido, es un juego muy bonito artísticamente con una historia que te engancha de principio a fin. Uno de los mejores juegos al que he jugado en mucho tiempo, muy recomendable.

 라나뭐라나. 버벅대고 끊겨도 부드러운 느낌의 그래픽이라 그런지 짜증보다는 천천히 둘러보듯 즐긴것 같슴다. 퍼즐의 난이도나 맵을 헤메는건 그렇다 쳐도.. 그래도 여우가 길을 알려주기도 하고 거이 외길인 셈이라 크게 어렵진 않은것 같습니다. 헤메는 과정도 주변을 둘러보는 것이라 생각하면은요. 배경이 아름다우니까요!

 플레이 타임도 2회차 요소도 있어서 좋았습니다. 세삼 2챕터는 체감상 플레이 타임이 더 길었던것 같습니다. 마냥 평화로울줄 알았던 이 게임에 쫒기는 요소가 있다는것 때문이죠! 그래도 역시 그래픽때문에 딱히 지루하거나 하진 않았습니다. 그런 황금색으로 빛나는 곳을 아무런 제약 없이 돌아다닌다면 그냥 슥 보고 지나쳐버릴것 같기도 하고.. 뭔가 여러모로 기억에 남는것 같네요.

 결론?은 아름다운 그래픽과 노래, 독특하고 준수한 난이도의 퍼즐이 뒷받침되어있어 좋은 게임이라고 생각함다. 어드벤처와 퍼즐을 좋아하는 사람이라면 추천하는 바이고, 길치이거나 팡팡 터지는걸 좋아하는 사람이라면...... '')..

I just finished the game, and I gotta say, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. RiME manage to hit the right notes in music, aesthetics, narrative and gameplay in order to compose a beautiful melody of a game. From the moment I started playing, the hypnotizing atmosphere, relaxing and melancholic music and flawless and fluid animation of the child protagonist, kept me glue to the screen until completion, this was amplified as I start to encounter murals, hints and key hole paintings, that slowly revealed the tragic story behind this apparently light-hearted game. 

As most gamers out there I'm used to the usual interaction mechanics: drive the car and win the race, fly the plane/ship and shoot the bad guys or kill everything in sight with your sword/gun... it was a pleasant surprise to see that most of the ""combat"" and puzzle interaction in RiME was render entirely through sounds and vocal cues made by our main hero. I've never felt more connected with a video game character as I felt with this little kid. The sense of wonder and loneliness I felt as I call out for anyone in the deserted beach at the beginning of the game, or the oppressive feeling of despair that I felt crying every time I clicked towards the end, were feelings that I rarely get in a video game.

RiME is a piece of art, an introspective journey across innocence and fantasy. An intense yet relaxed experience that will take you through very adult feelings like sense of lost, acceptance and hope, through the skin of a child. This is an experience that I wish to share with all my love ones, the same as a movie or a good book.

In a sea of carbon copies of the same Action/Adventures, RPGs, FPS, RTS and all that we've been cater as regular video games, RiME breaks the rule and go directly for the art behind the game, giving us an entirely new experience of joy, sadness, bonding, wonder and adventure, all wrapped up in a beautiful and unforgettable package!

The easiest way to describe this game would be to compare it to Journey.

If you haven't played Journey you are missing out, it's a Playstation exclusive which is a shame, but this game gave me exactly the same feel over the whole game experience.

By all acounts this game is an atmospheric game. The story and the music are central to this game. There is not a lot of interaction except for a few puzzles that will keep you occupied. 

Overall I would grade this as being not as good as Journey, but they are both games i'd easely put at the top of the genre.

The awesome story's beautifully told completely through imagery, as there's no dialogue in the game whatsoever, but even so it simply means that there're no language barriers holding people back. It's a story that some might find slightly challenging to follow, but what you are shown is easy to remember, and everything makes sense when it gets tied together in the end.

Game time is roughly 5 to 9 hours depending on how long you want to spend exploring, taking screenshots, collecting everything, and achievement hunting. I will say that you should take your time with it though, it's not a game that you should rush, even if you can.

ゲームはステージが区切られているが、ステージ内はかなり広く、特に1、2ステージは半オープンワールドのようになっている。

プレイ時間は6時間程度。収集要素含めたら8時間程度か。

Большая часть ""геймплея"" заключается в том, чтобы бежать вперёд по длиннющим (примерно втрое длиннее нужного) коридорам (или карабкаться по стенам), крича (буквально!) на все подозрительные предметы, чтобы они либо сделали что-нибудь полезное, либо сломались. Время от времени попадаются ""головоломки"", но они мало того, что изначально элементарны, так ещё и практически сами себя решают всевозможными подсветками и маркировками. Затыки иногда случаются только тогда, когда банально непонятно, куда именно игра хочет, чтобы ты сейчас пошёл.

Да ещё дизайнеры завели совершенно дурацкую привычку время от времени внезапно блокировать управление камерой, принудительно устанавливая самый неудобный из всех возможных в той или иной ситуации ракурсов. Залазишь на высокую скалу, чтобы нормально осмотреться - а тебя заставляют смотреть в лицо своему же персонажу. Карабкаешься вверх по какой-нибудь стене - камера заботливо поворачивается именно под таким углом, чтобы ты уж точно не понял с первого раза, какой именно комбинацией на WSAD можно прыгнуть туда, куда тебе сейчас нужно...

Исследования, невзирая на наличие соответствующего тега, нет совсем - не считать же за него поиск модных нынче ""collectibles""? Да и тем мне заниматься как-то быстро перехотелось: всевозможных закоулков в игре вроде бы и хватает, но почти всегда там просто ничего нет. Даже когда, казалось бы, само просится... Видел намёки, что сбор всего этого хлама мог бы помочь с пониманием сюжета, но... серьёзно? Раскрывать весь сюжет через коллектиблз? Нет уж, спасибо. Обойдусь.

Кстати, о сюжете: смысл происходящего на протяжении абсолютно всей игры остаётся совершенно непонятным. Какое-то подобие понимания приходит лишь буквально в самом финале, но подаётся так, что сперва только ещё сильнее запутывает. Хотя на самом-то деле всё элементарно, предсказуемо и вдобавок абсолютно никак не связано с событиями собственно игры. Те, кто всерьёз говорит здесь о какой-то атмосфере и чувствах, подозреваю, просто не играли в [b]Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons[/b]. Которая ничуть не менее красива, а при вдвое меньшей (благодаря незатянутости) длине содержит вчетверо больше и атмосферы, и сюжетного смысла...

Ах да. Здесь же ещё был какой-то волшебный лис! А вот на кой чёрт он здесь был - я так и не понял. Похоже, что единственная его задача - служить целеуказателем, время от времени садясь где-нибудь впереди и навязчиво тявкая. А потом надолго исчезая за ненадобностью, чтобы вновь появиться, когда о нём уже начинаешь забывать.

Не могу сказать, что это совсем плохая игра - в неё явно закладывалось множество интересных идей.

Was wie eine Zusammenwürfelung von geklauten Ideen klingt, ist weitaus mehr als das. Ja, man erkennt im Stil sehr viele Parallelen auch zu anderen Games, aber dennoch schafft es Tequila Works ein ganz eigenes Spiel zu erschaffen. Es ist nicht groß und vergleichsweise simpel, aber dennoch wird es niemals langweilig oder verliert seinen Reiz. Penibel genau passen die Rätsel- und Kletterpassagen zu den kurzen und teils interaktiven Cutscenes, die einem die Story sukzessive näher bringen sollen. 

Und genau das ist es auch, was RiME am meisten ausmacht. Man weiß tatsächlich bis zum Schluss nicht ansatzweise, warum der kleine Junge (der in der Tat keinen Namen hat) auf dieser idyllischen und mystischen Sommerinsel gestrandet ist. Das gilt es selbst herauszufinden. In der nicht ganz so offenen Welt findet man diverse Rätsel, die man lösen muss, um beispielsweise ein Tor zu öffnen oder Gegenstände und Maschinen zu aktivieren.

Aber dennoch kommt die Spannung nicht zu kurz. Diverse größere oder kleinere Gegner und Hindernisse sorgen für kleinere Herausforderungen, die aber stets fair sind. Wer sind all die rätselhaften Figuren, Abbildungen und Gegenstände? Was erwartet man von mir? Und vor allem: wer bin ich und was mache ich hier?

Inhaltlich ein außergewöhnliches Spiel, das es wert ist gespielt zu werden.

Das Gameplay ist eingängig und vertraut. Die Kameraperspektiven großartig und unterstützen die Narrative, die einen selten so emotional zurückgelassen hat.

Absolute Empfehlung.

Rime is not only wonderful to look at (I don't know how many screen shots I've take so far) but it tells a beautiful, emotional story without the use of words, relying on the scene settings, music, and visual aids to guide you through. There are some puzzles that you will need to figure out but they aren't very hard and I will admit sometimes it takes a couple minutes to figure out what you need and where you need to go but the game does its best to lead you in the right direction.

I also encourage exploration. I've completed the story but will be going back to get the collectibles I missed (there are a number of them so if you are a collector like me you'll want to be keeping an eye out for the orange glows).

I have noticed people in the comments mentioning it is a shorter game, and it is. It doesn't take a long to complete, its the hunt for collectibles that eats up some time. But this is the kind of game that isn't meant to be hours and hours long, its meant to be shorter, to tell a story about a boy who has found himself on this fantastic island and his journey as he explores it.

However, it didn't end up being one. First of all, i'd like to say that this isn't a bad game. I don't mind the length (I spent 5 hours completing it). However, certain aspects truly made the experience feel mediocre. If you didn't already guess, the sound and visuals are stunning. The story is great when you have reached the end. Until the final part of the game I was just running for the flagpole (top of the tower), not because I wanted to explore the story, but because I wanted to see what the game was going to award me with. 

The one thing that really bothered me is how the path you take in the game is straighter than something drawn with the guide of a ruler. One example, is when you have to go to three different windmills. Here I feel like the developers missed an oppertunity for the player to choose which order the three are done. In reality, you get forced to do them in a certain order and take the one path put in front of you. In a game with exploration as a tag, I would like for there to be more exploration.

Going on from the last part, the platforming in this game isn't the greatest. It feels more like a game of simon says than anything. ""Simon says, hold left and press A to jump to the next part."" This is caused by the lack of skill needed to get from ledge to ledge (the game is filled with ledges). From what I remember, there wasn't a single moving platform in the game. Nowhere did you have to time your jump to get to the next platform. This is something I feel was a bad choice. There was nothing that really tested me as a player. I thought it was going to be a challenge to get to the top of the tower. The platforming was lacking, boring and linear.

The puzzles ranged from too easy, to easy. Some of the puzzles are neat especially the environmental ones. But, when markers are placed on the floor with the object symbol, you can't really call it a puzzle.

There's also a lot more that I just can't be bothered writing about. For example how the fox you meet doesn't really interact with the main character other than saying ""look here, this is where you go next"".



All in all:

+ Visually stunning
+ Audio is great
+ Story is good
+ Environmental Puzzles are fun, especially the ones using light

- Platforming is lacking, doesn't test the player
- Puzzles are far too easy
- You can't explore freely, you have to walk the set path
- Main character doesn't interact with the companion, except when they first meet
- Answers to puzzles are basically written on the floor through markers
- Story only becomes good towards the end
