Probably something to do with an internal timer, maybe a Vsync controller gone bad, I don't know. I had to run CheatEngine and set the speed hack to 5x (effectively making the game 5 times faster) for animations to finally be fluid. Except of course it made cutscenes go much faster and killed the mood entirely.

So, what can I say about this thing..? It's another story that reduces Mexican lore to a joke (well, at least there are only few references to the Day of the Dead and wrestling, but still...), it has a nice soundtrack, good backgrounds that are ruined by terrible character graphics (probably based on real pictures, which never bides well in-game), boring mini-games, acceptable hidden object scenes (at least you don't get to revisit them once they're done, so it's a good thing), and a story that bare made sense to me. Probably wasn't helped by the fact it went by so fast...

Finally, there are the bugs. Tons of them. Minigames that don't trigger automatically and require you to leave the game and relaunch it, for instance. For the record, if you alt-tab out of the game during a cutscene and come by to it, it'll say 'Paused', and you have to click to unpause. Which also has the added effect of skipping the cutscene. Happened to me on both of the ending cutscenes, which would be funny if it wasn't frustrating. Well, not that HOG endings really matter, eh..?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1359151829

A journalist visited that village to investigate the legend of the weeping woman which claim that Maria's spirit shows up every moonlight and kidnap children. The story's pace was really good and the investigation will make you suspect things going on. I liked the festival theme of Dia de los muertos but they called it 'Flores de los Muertos' in the game which is dedicated to the kidnapped children. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1359143875

At first, I thought there is no map in this game at all as they made you walk back and forth in a couple of areas, but later you'll get a fast traveling map, a good one too. The journal doesn't say much, I actually didn't like it because it doesn't keep the piece of papers and clues you find all along the investigation, you can only read them once picking them up. 

I can't deny that I did enjoy the art and soundtracks of the game. The colorful and well-drawn locations tempted me to take many screenshots! Sad that this game doesn't have steam achievements but it does have in-game achievements which are easy to acquire. Even the puzzles were easy and fun although I disliked one of them, fortunately, it wasn't hard to solve.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1359199102 

Pros:
+Fitting soundtracks.
+Beautiful colorful graphics.
+Good story
+Good voice-overs and accent!
+Fast travel map.
+Fun puzzles.
+Collectibles.

Cons:
-No steam achievements. (There is an in-game achievement) 
-No steam cards.
-Not good journal, it doesn't keep the evidence and papers you find.
-Short game (Took me almost 4 hours to finish the main game and bonus chapter.)

I didn't like the bonus chapter as it was a totally different story. It is funny that instead of calling the authorities to help, they asked a journalist to solve their problems! Aside from this, the game is really good and I do recommend it.

[h1]Сюжет.[/h1]
Игра поведает нам историю журналистки, расследующей пропажи детей, по уверениям местных жителей производимых Плачущей Женщиной - покончившей с собой красавицы, чей муж оказался не таким уж и верным и сбежал от неё к более молодой пассии, с их детьми. Действительно ли в пропажах детей виноват злой дух? Или же кто-то прикрывается этой легендой? Мы выясним это в игре. Сюжет основан на латиноамериканском мифе о Ла Йороне, то есть собственно Плачущей Женщине. В бонусной главе, есть отсылка к другому персонажу латиноамериканских легенд El Sombreron`у, то есть ""Шляпнику"". В целом получился неплохой триллер с налетом мистики.

[h1]Геймплей.[/h1]
Много паззлов, много сцен поиска, все достаточно хорошо уравновешено. Есть дополнительные задания по поиску цветков и черепушек. Минус - внутриигровые достижения есть, стимовских нет. По геймплею игра хороша.

[h1]Графика и звуки.[/h1]
Картинка приличная, есть неплохие кат-сцены. Музыка неплоха для атмосферности, к тому же есть английская озвучка, с характерным акцентом латиносов.

[h1]Как итог.[/h1]
Хороший представитель жанра ""поиска скрытых предметов"", к тому же по мотивам относительно редкой темы - латиноамериканских мифов. Любителям жанра, а также интересующимся культурой Латинской Америки, пройти стоит.

Why? I think it’s largely because every backdrop was rich in festivity and colour. It was like, I was being secretly stalked by a rainbow.

The story is about a popular Mexican folklore ghost tale of La Llorona who lost her two children by deliberately drowning them in a river as a means of revenge against her unfaithful husband, before ending her own life the same way. Being prevented access in heaven because of her murderous deeds, her spirit is said to be trapped at the river’s edge and all along it you can hear her wailing as she seeks other children to replace her own.

In the game though, there is a big variance to the folklore. In game the ghost of the weeping woman approaches you and informs you that someone is tarnishing her reputation as a bad ghost by taking children of the nearby village and blaming it on her. Hence the evil kidnapping entity is really just a misunderstood nice ghost needing your help so that you can hunt down the real kidnapper. Is it just me or should random drug testing be introduced to the script writers at http://www.gunnargames.com/games.html ?

The puzzles range from basic to slightly challenging, being always loyal to that casual gaming theme. A guide accompanies the game so that you should never really get stuck. There is the additional tasks of finding morphing flowers and hidden skulls throughout the game for padded gameplay and my only beef with the game is for those that wish to 100% the in-game achievements will discover that they need find all these things before coming across the end. If they do not, the game does not allow you too simply to go back in it, to find the remaining hidden items you’re missing. Instead you will have to create another profile and start all over again. A very poor and tedious mechanic of the developers.

There is also a bonus chapter about another popular folklore El Sombreron who is a devilish Romeo spirit which likes to braid women’s hair with magical hair ties that will make them eternally besotted unable to live, eat or drink without him. In game you will uncover the ‘scoobydoo’ mystery of the person playing this villain role and their absurd makes no sense agenda. Surprisingly these nonsense boogeymen ghost stories terrorise the Mexican populace in general and is it just me or should random drug testing be introduced to the whole Mexican population?

In final a colourful, not to be taken serious expose of some very strange Mexican folklore, artfully drawn in vivid festive detail and dazzling colours. A stunning pageant of the strange and weird.

An investigating journalist arrives in a small town in order to solve a case of a missing child. Sounds familiar? It should, as it is not just the basic premise of Lost Legends: The Weeping Woman, but of most any standard modern hidden object games.
Luckily, this HOG here knows how to play the cliché. It creates an engaging environment with an actually populated village and by using a Mexican festival of the dead as the main theme to build its mystery on. Said mystery is hardly difficult to figure out, by the way, but the plot is tight enough to not worry about predictability.

Game mechanics tread on safe grounds as well, in a good way. There are plenty of above-average hidden object scenes, and the same goes for the puzzles too. Probably the biggest problems are the constant backtracking and the barely-helpful map, but even those are tolerable. All put together, The Weeping Woman is an average HOG, but of the engaging and fun kind.",1474183976,1474183976,True,22,0,0.743582606315612793,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Kazdorocne se pak ztraceji mistni deti a lide to kladou za vinu duchu teto mrtve zeny. Na vas je vysetrit, co za tim doopravdy stoji. 
Umisteni do Latinske Ameriky umoznilo vyuzit pestre barvy - nekomu to muze prijit preplacane, ale podle me se to sem hodi. Vsudypritomne motivy malovanych lebek a kostlivcu tomu davaji lehce morbidni smrnc. Hezky vizual kazi jen ""prkenne"" pribehove cutsceny, ktere vyuzivaji herniho 2D enginu a pusobi ledabyle (rozostrene zoomy, trapne pohyby), naopak rozhovory s NPC se povedly.
Story je opet primarne zamerena na zeny-hrace, ale kdyz si to date na Hardcore, i chlapi budou mit s touto adventurou takovych 6 hodin co delat :) U logiky pribehu bych si jen rypnul, ze na sve ceste neustale potkavate nejake ""duchy"", coz na konci vubec neni vysvetleno... Mozna mohli autori zvolit i temnejsi atmosferu, ale to je jen muj subj. pocit. Co naopak realne vadi, je strasne zjednoduseny denik, kam se zapisuji jen hlavni ukoly, misto aby (jako u jinych HOPA) uchovaval veskere texty a videa, na ktere narazite - takze peclive ctete a sledujte vsechno, protoze zpetne se k tomu uz nedostanete. 
Puzzly maji akorat obtiznost, kdy to preci jen chvili zabere, ale pritom to neni frustrujici. HO screeny jsou dobre nakreslene, takze nevadi. Celkove se hrou postupuje pomerne plynule, tedy pokud peclive ""scanujete"" kazdou obrazovku, abyste nasli vsechny pouzitelne predmety. 
Hned napoprve se daji udelat i vsechny achievementy, i kdyz najit ve hre 25 skrytych zlatych lebek a 25 menicich se kytek je docela otrava. Jsou schovane na hlavnim screenu, nikoliv v podoknech a vzdy max 1 od kazdeho na jedne obrazovce. Ale nekde muze byt jen lebka, nekde jen kytka, nekde oboji...zkratka nema to logiku ani zadny indikator, takze pokud tyto achievy chcete, musite opravdu peclive zkoumat vsechny lokace, coz odvadi pozornost od pribehu a zbytecne to prodluzuje hraci dobu. Klidne tam tyto achievy vubec nemusely byt. Navic se asi nedaji ""dodelat"" druhym projitim hrou - na 2. zahrani je totiz nutno vytvorit novy profil, takze vse zrejme zcela od nuly. O to vic mrzi, ze jejich splneni uvidite jen ve hre - na Steamu nejsou. 
Steam karty hra taky nema. Je ale v CE edici, tak aspon dostanete wallpapery, artworky a bonusovou kapitolu. U te ocenuji, ze neni jen nutnym pokracovanim deje, coz je beznym neduhem HOPA her, ale je opravdu samostatnym - ac kratkym a predvidatelnym - minipribehem.

It was about the 6-in-1 Bundle from Alawar, with the excellent Mexicana: Deadly Holidays and the fact that for once, the action was set during a Mexican celebration. Well, the life is weird because I've played Lost Legends: The Weeping Woman without even knowing the plot and I ended up with a legend from San Cristobal, with a celebration where you see also skulls masks and other accessories around deaths.

The Weeping Woman is a woman that lost her husband and her children to another girl and that drowned herself in the river nearby. Children were disappearing, so the villagers created a celebration to appease the sad spirit. However, while it was calm for years, now, drama is happening around. You're sent to San Cristobal as a reporter, however, you'll be thrown into a kid's disappearance... Is it really the Weeping Woman?

The plot is well-done: while you're doubting that it's the spirit behind the disappearances, the truth was shocking in the end. I loved the fact that it sets during a celebration and that you have such mysteries around a legend. You're even visiting ruins at the end, changing from the little village and from the country.

While the gameplay is the same as any of the hidden object games here, I found the scenes very easy and the puzzles not very complicated, even if some can be seen as hard as it needs some logic that usually fails me. However, you don't have the instructions at first sight, to know what you need to do, you have to click on a button. I don't like usually not being told first about the rules.

Given the fact that the game is a collector's edition, you can find a bonus chapter: San Cristobal needs you because of another legend: El Sombreron is enchanting girls that fall into a coma after having their hair being braided. You'll also find concept arts, wallpapers, etc...

I loved the graphics. I loved that little village and the atmosphere typically in full celebration mode. I also liked a lot the passage in the ruins. As for the soundtrack, it was very well fitting.
