I love how the developer managed to merge a real time campaign with real time battles, much like a mix between Paradox Interactive strategy games and the Total War series. 

Its not without its flaws though. 

Unless you have the speed set to its maximum on the campaign and battle map, everything will look like its going at a glacial pace (even then the campaign is still very slow at max speed). So it's not for the impatient player. 

The economy system is perhaps a bit too abstract to understand on first playthrough, but ultimately the only thing you have to do is make sure your producing more goods than you have demand for and try to reduce your reliance on foreign imports (for example, you have a demand for Iron of 22 but you produce 10 Iron in your own craft buildings, the economy AI will make up the rest by importing from foreign countries). Just try to reduce your dependence on foreign imports and you should be fine overall.

If you play as one of the 5 Great Powers in the game you'll probably be fine as they have the starting cash to make being bad at the economy mean very little. But play as Sweden and you'll struggle to stay afloat before the War start if you don't manage the economy well (don't be afraid to get loans as the historical events in game will bankrupt you sometimes).

Luckily, there is an option to let the AI run the economy for you, but with the slow pace of the campaign, there's very little else to do for the 6 years before the war starts, so you may as well try and learn how it works. 
It also sports several starting points so that you can skip the lead up to the war, getting straight into the action instead of that's what you want to so.

I will give a major bug notice for the economy. For some reason after 2 years in game the supply of Iron on the global market will just vanish. The enemy AI just doesn't seem to prioritise the production of Iron and after that 2 year mark construction projects and goods production buildings that require Iron will just stop and they will never start up again. 
This is certainly true in the ""Road to War"" start date. 


So that's the bad side of the game, the good side is mostly when the war starts, but I do like the building and goods production side of the economy, even though I barely understand how it works. Its a level of depth I've been missing from Total war games lately.

The way the warfare works is tense. Since it's a real time campaign, you have to be very conscious of the enemy armies around you and pick your battles.  You have to make sure your not fighting away from your supply hubs (the cities) as over stretching yourself does have consequences. Soldiers desert, morale tanks and if you get into battle under those conditions, you can kiss your army goodbye even if you outnumber your enemy. 

The strategic depth of this game is great and its again something I've been missing from Total War games. 

This game is definitely worth a try, but do go into it with the knowledge that somethings probably just won't make sense when it comes to the economy.",1650830934,1652626090,True,3,0,0.553213655948638916,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Production in The Seven Years War (TSYW) is a matter of making basic goods, transporting them, and using them in production, construction, and mobilization. So far, so familiar. The vibe is similar to games such as the Anno series and nothing about the concept is wrong in itself.

The issue that this game has is in transportation. The ability of your own and AI economies to use anything but primary materials is hindered so badly by your (and their) teamsters' (cart operators) refusal to move stuff around as to make it more trouble to run an economy than it is worth. Both you and the AI will get timber to construction sites just fine. Getting bricks and iron there may well not happen once the initial stock runs out.

To use a brick in a construction project, you have to mine loam and then: 
1. transport ti to the provincial center,

3. transport to the brickmaker.
4. transport bricks to the provincial center, 
(5) transport to the province the construction site is in, if different. 
6. transport to the construction site.

A single failure kills the whole supply chain. A broken supply chain for either bricks or iron means you can build almost nothing past about the first year or so. Including buildings required to make bricks or iron!

The game gives you abundant tools to make teamsters do their duty - prices, haulage and construction site priorities, and stockpiling being four - but the basic system is terribly convoluted, cumbersome, and - worst of all - delicate. Furthermore, reasons for or solutions to failure are never provided. Stuff doesn't get moved, and you are left entirely on your own to find which, if any knob, will make it stop failing.

I was never able to find such a knob. Nor is the AI in much (if any) better shape. Construction of buildings critical to their economy hangs year after year waiting for that last brick or iron bar.

I can only suggest not purchasing this game.

It is a shame, however, we do not have a variety of games covering this fascinating war. Regarding The Seven Years War game, I can only speak about Historical Battles and Custom Battles, that are the features in which I am interested in. The game covers some of my favourite battles in History such as Leuthen, Minden, Rossbach, Lobositz and I really like the armies layout. The game doesn't have the best graphics, however, this is more a tactical game, not as heavy as others but still have the depth and details that I was looking for. One of the aspects I really appreciate is that armies are organized by divisions and brigades and unit orders are enough detailed to have a great warfare experience. I like the fact, for example, that a variety of formations can be selected: single line, double line, column, square. Another great feature is the morale and AI, the AI is really good, what makes me to get involved in the battle and have a great gaming experience, facing a challenging enemy. The fact that morale can affect to the rest of the enemy army or your army even without being engaged makes it realistic, being possible to defeat a more numerous enemy army, this is something that other games of this genre lack of.

Is a shame that we do not have a variety of games based on this period.

A priori il y avait beaucoup de chsoes pour me combler : une période peu mise en avant et originale ( la guerre de 7 ans), de la gestion poussée, une mixe heureux de wargame qui prend en compte tous les aspects économiques diplomatiques, scientifiques et pas seulement militaires... mais là C'est tout simplement INDIGESTE ! L'interface est juste incompréhensible cafouilleuse desservie (très mal en l'occurence) par une 3D dont on dira pour être polie qu'elle est vieillote et rajoute de la confusion. On en s'attend pas à des graphismes derniers cris, OK, mais bcp de jeux de stratégie savent intélligementen  tirer partie soit en privilégiant une direction artistiques 3D sobre (genre Europa Universalis, Crusader King) soit en optant pour de la 2D voire un style ""dessin/artbook/BD"" autant de pistes jamais envisagées par les devellopeurs semblet-il et c'est bien dommage, car avec une bonne DA on pardonne bien des choses.
Le problème est que la localisation bancale en français rajoute du ridicule à une interface déja fortement contre intuitive, de plus il ya trop d'informations, les détails sont totalemnt inutiles et ne servent pas à approfondir le jeu, juste à le rendre illisible, on ne sait pas quoi faire, démuni devant un didacticiel baclé et pas clair (cf la localisation foireuse) et pendant temps l'horloge défile alors qu'un système de tour aurait sans doute était plus pertienent mais non, là encore on cherche a concilier le carpe et le lapin, on reprend les mécaniques des jeux Paradoxe et on soupoudre de Total War, mais là encore ce n'est pas pertienent à ça dessert le gameplay au lieu de le rendre cohérent !
Alors à moins d'être une immense patience et doté d'une bienveillance au dessus de la moyenne couplé à un passionné indécroitable de cette période en aprticulier je suis forcé de déconseiller ce jeux, non suelment aux néophites (allez du coté d'un Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic-les derniers en tout cas- ou même d'un Total War si vous voulez cherchez quelquechose d'accessible) mais aussi à la majorité des Fans de Wargames Hisotierques et de jeux de stratégie en général, à ne conseilleur qu'aux hardcore masochistes. reste le prix qui est raisonnable (mais ca reste cher pour un jeux auquel on ne joue pas, impossible de lancer un petit run), à la rigueur à prendre en soldes a moins de 2 euros...

The reason is because if I cant enjoy the battles in anyway I see no point of playing a campaign in it since the game actually simulates a war :)   

So if you want a more indepth review of this I suggest you to look elsewhere and I also strongly recommend you to do so because if you are interested in a game with good depth in the campaign I think this can be gem that has been hidden for many.
 

It´s harder to get into than Scourge of war even if it has a much easier UI interface. For me the problem is actually not the simulation mechanics and instead the lack of sounds when troops marching and that you can´t zoom in on your units very close, so instead you are forced to you have a birds eyeview of the battle.  So....read the other reviews instead about it. 
I´m looking forward to the teams new game called "" Grand tactician"" that seems to be the best of 2 worlds

+ interesting theatre of battle

- One of the most horrible UI I´ve seen with neongreen markers on the map in game that wants to portray an era of older times this looks more like it belongs into a sci-fi game than anything else.

- low fps, or very stuttering. perhaps its meant to be like this. Personally I get very irritated by it. I have installed the game three times and allways forget why I uninstall it until I play it again...this is the main reason along with the UI.

So please read more about this lovely game developement here

Personally I couldnt enjoy "" The seven years war"" due to the problems with the immersion but I´m quite sure it´s doing what it´s supposed to be doing in according to the simulation aspect and depth.

The Seven Years War's combat system will be very familiar to those who played the Scourge of War and the Take Command series, and those who already like those games will surely enjoy the realism options and the interesting historical setting for this game. You get to command at regiment, brigade and division level with an accurate order of battle.  Around the great combat system a very complex campaign system has been built, and it can be very difficult to get into, mainly due to the scarcity of documentation.

Combat wise, the base game offers 6 historical battles of the Seven Years War, all involving the European Theater of the war, as far as I can say.  A few things worth noting : there are two DLC packs for this game. One of them, Battle Pack, is basically a necessity for the wargamer, since it's what unlocks the Custom Battle option, as well as some new historical battles and weather effects to the battles. Oddly enough, some commands also require the DLC, like being able to use the charge and retreat orders in battle, so you should keep that in mind when considering getting the game for the battles only.

The game takes it to whole new level in the campaign mode. In vanilla, you can select 5 of the major European Powers involved in the war: France, Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria. The Pomeranian War DLC obviously introduces Sweden as a playable nation. The game focuses mainly on the european and american theater of the war. In Europe you find Prussia fighting for its very existence as a sovereign state later in the war, and the Americas see a struggle between France and Britain for colonial expansion and the support of the native tribes.

Every nation has its own advantages and resources, as well as specific objectives, such as colonial dominance in Britain and France's case, to recovering Silesia  and defeating Prussia for the Austrians. The campaign itself is very complex, almost like a paradox game, but critically lacking in documentation. The game does come with an 60-page manual, explaining most of the humongous quantity of statistics the game presents, as well as production chains. The developer also posted a few tutorial videos on youtube, but as far as I can tell, this is basically all that you will find, and you surely will stay guessing for a long time what's wrong with your trade or why the revenue seems to fluctuate so much (even while you are paused).

Your options are many in the diplomacy: making offers and demands of trade, trading prisoners, technologies, and territories. Making alliances and setting rally points for your allies. You have a few policies to choose from, which tend to specialize your nation, as they focus on improving on a certain area while decreasing your effectiveness somewhere else.
You may also make research in military, economic, industrial and agricultural fields. Build provicial buildings to collect raw resources and crafters to process these resources into goods which can then be sold.

Trading is made primarly by automated traders, who follow supply and demand rules: buying low and selling high, trying to make a profit. This profit goes to you. It is important to keep your prices below the provincial average if you hope a merchant will buy your goods and make a profit. Otherwise, you will be losing money due to the costs of maintaining and staffing provincial buildings. You can also tell your merchants to focus on trading of stockpiling resources for times of need, such as stockpiling weapons and uniforms for wartime or food the winter, which does affect your production as well as the morale of your armies.

UI wise the game does feel unpolished, but since this game was developed by just one person, it is very understandable. Icons in the UI will require some reference to the manual, as the meaning of some of them may seem very obscure at first. The menus are also very small, as well as the font. You may find it difficult to read many of the tooltips and even the resource icons are hard to see; the games does seem a little hard on the eyes at times. The graphics are passable for a wargame, as well as the sound design.

Overall, this game is a very good representation of 18th century warfare, and is the only game I can think of to encompass the Seven Years War, known by some to be the first true world war. The battles are very fun, altough very slow when compared to a Total War and other RTS games, battles with 3 to 5 divisions can take upwards of an hour to finish. The campaign, once you get the hang of, can be very satisfying and open ended to play, as you can make and break historical alliances at will, either reliving the historical progression or completely subverting it.",1518712179,1518712179,True,7,0,0.598606228828430176,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its conclusion set the stage for both the American and French revolutions, the second British Empire and securing Prussia’s role as a major player in European politics. Oddly, no strategy game has taken an in-depth look at this conflict. Paradox’s Europa Universalis IV and Sega’s Empire: Total War take almost abstract approaches to this war while AGEOD’s Rise of Prussia only deals with individual campaigns.

The subject deserves more detailed analysis. Fortunately, one man, Oliver Keppelmüller, spent years making an extremely detailed RTS game of the war. 

The campaign mode allows play as Britain, Austria, France, Prussia and Sweden. Each has a campaign starting in 1750 and going through 1763 and a campaign beginning in 1756 and finishing the war. On top of this are country-specific shorter scenarios, e.g. Britain’s crisis in North America. The goals for all of these are unique to the country. Hence, Britain need only run the French out of North America while Prussia must fight hard to survive. The tools of play reside in several levels of panels. For instance, opening the financial panel reveals further panels of action. Handling these levels becomes second nature after some hours of play.

The key to successful campaigning is not moving troops around but finance. Under-supplied and unpaid soldiers and sailors don’t fight well and tend to desert. The Seven Years War handles money through a very detailed supply and demand system.

The production chain resembles that of Civilization III: resources are exploited by building mines, farms and so forth but these facilities need resources themselves. Products are brought to cities and trading outposts by traders and merchant ships. These traders and ships move automatically around the map looking for the best deals. Although their profits go directly to the player, traders may ignore the country’s own products if they are overpriced, making production irrelevant. Adjusting prices and demand priorities in cities influence traders indirectly and aid cities.

Cities are also crucial to population morale. Factors like religion, health and level of corruption contribute to happiness. Players can influence these factors by building “Feel Good” facilities such as schools, doctors’ offices and forts. A high level of happiness allows for tax increases. Cities are also where soldiers are recruited and ships for the fleets are built.

The general status of a nation can be enhanced via research and government policy. New technology can yield better production and new weapons. Policies can decrease corruption and initiate popular reforms. If all of the above seems a bit much for a wargamer, never fear. The military focus option turns all of the civilian functions over to the AI, leaving players to concentrate on why they bought the game – imposing their will on the world.

I utterly love the tactical battles and I would recommend the game even if that were the only thing to it.  The campaign game, however is a different story.  Maybe I am missing something but it seems to me that in order to play and enjoy it you have to be a doctual student or professor in economics.  The economics in the game are overwhelming to me and take up most of the time playing the game.  I would really like to see a setting where the AI runs the economy with the player being able to intervene on important issues.  This would make the campaign game playable for me.  So my recommendation is as follows:  If what you want is a wonderful tactical battle game on the 18th century drop what you are doing and buy it today.  If you have an overriding interest in an 18th century micro-management economic game then ditto.  If what you want is a campaign game revolving around troop movements etc with minimal economics avoid this like the plague.",1510514909,1510514909,True,3,0,0.52245938777923584,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall, I'd recommend the game but don't expect a seamless experience.
First the bad:
* There were immediate bugs encountered. Everything from running the game under Windows 10 to game crashes to mangled troops. That said, I wrote the developer and he *immediately* either gave me a workaround or actually fixed these bugs. I've never seen support like this before and this alone makes me recommend this game.
* The play balance is still a bit off. Certain commodities like cotton are only found in the colonies, so only England and France have access to them. If the AI is running these countries and doesn't develop them, everyone ends up short. There are plenty of similar examples.
* The AI is really bad. Even with the agressive option set it can't really offer much of a threat. That said, it's still fun to stomp on. But the objectives you need to win are trivial to accomplish.
* There are various UI annoyances, from poorly designed interfaces to stuff like trouble dragging troops around (half the time they snap back and you've got to do it again).
Second the good:
* Really detailed economic model. You not only can develop resources and build production buildings, but you can trade with foreign powers. Most of the trade is automated and made simple, despite there being ~20 resource types. You can also dominate a given commodity and force the price up, making a ton of money. Playing the economic game was as satisfying as the military.
* Very cool system of troop recuitment and organization. Both troops and officers are recruited separately, with officers limiting the number of battalions your army can have while troops fill in the bulk. Reorganizing armies is easy and makes a huge difference in the tactical battles.
* Good quality graphics for an indie game.
* Excellent developer support (bug fixes in days!)
* Active improvements. I expect once the bugs and balance issues get worked out this will be an excellent game.

Overall I'm giving this a positive review despite the negatives, mostly because I believe it will work those out soon and be a truely good game.

Make no mistake though; you`ll never be able to satisfy all you wants.

Battles are fun, although I harbour the suspicion that cavalry by this time was a little less reckless than the AI allows.

Voici un jeu que j'avais acheté il y a quelques temps déjà car je l'avais repéré, mais mon niveau en anglais n'étant pas fabuleux et la prise en main demandant de bien comprendre l'ensemble du fonctionement du gameplay... je l'avais laissé par manque de courage de côté...  

Puis il y a quelques jours mon regard s'est porté dessus alors que je naviguais dans ma bibliothèque de jeu et je me suis dit qu'il faudrait quand même que je m'y mette... Surtout qu'entre temps la localisation française était sortie. Alors je vais vous l'avouer tout de suite, la traduction est une horreur ^^ ! Cela en est même parfois drôle ! Le plus embêtant étant les fautes de syntaxes qui la parsèment et qui m'ont empêchées carrément de comprendre certaine partie du gameplay ! Pour vous dire sur certains cas j'ai repassé le jeu en anglais pour pouvoir comprendre le truc ^^ ! Heureusement plusieurs guides (en anglais eux aussi mais compréhensibles pour mon petit niveau) sont sortis et m'ont bien aidés. Merci à ceux qui les ont rédigés d'ailleurs. Et depuis je découvre la profondeur, que je soupçonnais de ce jeu ! 

Alors si vous aimez les jeux ayant le soucis du détail, ayant un système économique structuré et qui tient la route, si vous aimez passer du temps à gérer et déveloper  vos villes (d'ailleurs la gestion de ces dernières me rappelle un peu le vieux mais excellent Forge of Freedom), si vous aimez planifier vos invasions afin notamment de gérer l'approvisionnement en nourriture, armes, munitions de vos unités, prévoir de protéger vos lignes de communications (très important ! Une guerre peu se perdre rien qu'en se faisant couper ses lignes !), nommer des maréchaux, des généraux, des colonels ayant chacun évidement leurs propres caractéristiques, former vos régiments, brigades, divisions, les entraîner, upgrader leurs  armes, si vous aimer user de diplomatie pour retourner des alliances, s'allier avec les amérindiens, si vous aimez les arbres de recherches technologiques fournis , si vous aimez les batailles qui durent longtemps, où vous avez enfin le temps e faire manoeuvrer vos troupes avant que la bataille ne soit finie, si vous aimez affronter une IA pas trop débile (on parle dans les couloirs d'un multi possilbe ?), si vous aimez vous plonger dans des périodes qui ne sont pas souvent traîtées dans l'univers du jeu vidéo et si vous aimez bien toutes ces autres choses encore qui font la profondeur d'un jeu, et bien foncez ! Achetez le ! Vous ne serez pas déçu ! Alors évidement les graphismes, bien qu'ils se soient améliorés depuis le moment où j'avais acheté ce jeu, ne sont pas au top... Vous ne pourrez pas zoomer non plus à 3 cm du nez d'un mousquetaire par exemple... Mais franchement entre un Total War version vanilla qui est magnifique mais qui sonne creux  et un tel jeu, mon choix est fait. Surtout pour le prix !!! 

Du coup alors que seul le DLC battle pack m'intéressait, j'ai acheté les deux pour soutenir ce développeur qui tout seul, nous a sorti une perle ! Et franchement ces DLC ne m'ont pas ruinés non plus.

Voilà des heures de plaisir en perspective qui me mettent en joie et du coup j'en ai rédigé ma première évaluation sur Steam ^^

the games UI is detailed enough to enjoy setting formations and advancing retreating etc..., the info is great but needs some mouseovers . 

I did not have to read the maual or do a tutorial to work out how to do a battle, that's a big plus, you can read later its first impressions that count.

Its probably the best RTS I have ever enjoyed, felt like strategy rather than a click fest, 

The period of the battles is great.

I loved this game and it should be on matrixgames as a top title its better than many wargames Ive played, its not getting enough publicity I never seen it before, I would probably of not bought it if it was more expensive because I would of thought it a risk, but If Id of paid double on a wargame site, I would of felt pleased at what I bought. Ive not played all the game like the grand strategy or economy yet, so great thing ahead.

I cant praise this game enough, its got the right pace in battle, the battle creater is great,

The game was a must-buy for me and I really wanted to like this game.

After several tries, hoping that updates will make this game playable, I have to say no-go.

In short:
- terrible UI
- ugly graphics even for indie game (I am not expecting eye-candy, but I would like to recognize forests or swamps from plains)
- historical mistakes (a lot of them)
- absolutely no feel of 18th century warfare

Longer explanation:
The two last points are rather for 18th century enthusiasits; readers of Duffy, contributors to Kronoskaf. I had to mention it, because a lot of positive reviews are praising the ""historical accuracy"", which is definitely not true. I cannot recall all mistakes, but just a few of them:
1) Dragoons can (and do) fire from hroseback > this was prohibited under punishment in Prussian army. All regular cavalry in all armies used cold steel (shock) tactics (yes, dragoons had carabines, but hussars and curassiers had them as well and they cannot fire from horseback ingame). Here, you can have 2 standing lines of cavalry shooting at each other...
2) Unit portraits are full of mistakes, just a few of them:
- hussars have picture of dragoon
- Prussian Guard Grenadiers have picture of obsolete (1700 era) grenadier uniform
- some regular infantry have picture of fusiliers
3) Regiments are represented as bigger battalions, brigades are made of 4 such ""regiments"" (so there is roughly half the number of brigades) 
4) Historical battles = inacurately represented troops (according to OOBs from Kronoskaf) of both sides are just put to ugly and inacurate map without names of villages and towns (names like town 1, town 2...) in line formation (should be column) at the very beginning of the battle
5) Commanders are not represented; units (brigades and divisions) just have to stick together to work properly
6) When I tried the campaign mode just after the release date, the initial troops of 1756 scenario were not according to history. I am not sure now, since I have not tried the campaign after I recognized the battles are still wrong.

I tried Kolin as Prussian > I was not able to recognize the map of actual Kolin, the troops in line formation were not according to OOB and they were somewhere in the fields, not on the Kaiser road where they should be at 5:30. All Austrians were far away in one bulk, no grenzers or hussar squadrons as forward recon. 
I tried Leuthen as well and it was better, the map looked like the Leuthen battlefield a little and the troops were more accurately positioned (troops were still not according OOB), but still in line and some troops (line formation) in woods(!!)

I wrote points 1) and 2) on game forum (in more detail), but the author just ignored them (he replied something, but left the game as is with mistakes)

The approach to enemy is really slow, clumsy and without any complex command-and-control rules (you have simple delay of orders). The engagement itself just feels strange and is no fun.",1475351210,1475441938,False,35,5,0.666082859039306641,1,True,False,False,False,,,

作者的更新还是不错，在汇报一些BUG后，第一时间论坛给出了反馈以及修复。目前游戏还是存在一些细小的BUG以及战术和战略AI的欠缺。目前发现AI无论是进攻触发战斗场面还是防御，都不会主动向玩家主动发起进攻，所以导致，玩家永远是进攻方。。这很蛋疼啊。。总体来说个人觉得还是更偏向于经济发展游戏，侧重点是战斗，此游戏没有攻城战的场景，攻城就是一张图片，然后在画面上安排各个部队做不同的事情，比如挖掩体，修工事，安排在战壕内等待攻击，还是安排在侧翼。。总之攻城还是相对比较单调的。自动完事。。。

I mostly play wargames nowadays, on a board. There just usually arent that many historical simulations that are so immersive as the Grigsby games, John Tiller series, AGEOD, and so on. Most of these included on cover popular more modern wars as well. 

This game is a welcome masterpiece on a little studied conflict that had major consequences for the remainder of European history. I admit I suck at the battles, I have always been bad at real time strategy games preffering turn based, but the battles themselves are portrayed accurately and with the historical options on units can only use the formations that were around at the time (not sure why the other way around is automatic?) 

To me where the game really shines though is through its campaign system. Most people that arent either interested in history, logistics or economics will have a hard time with this side of the game. The crux of the system is focused on trade and logistics, which at first seems counter intuitive for a wargame except in that so much of the war depended on trade and supply lines. You can pause the game to plan out your strategic operations, build plans, and then most importantly (as ive just found out) managing your trading cities' priorities so you can actually accomplish the things you plan out. 

One con I have with the game is that I think Diplomacy is broken in some ways. I'm currently playing as France, England has never declared war, and the rest of europe is my ally or paying me a shit ton of money. Not exactly sure how the diplomatic points work but I would have prefered some kind of chance or random element given this particular abstraction. I think the game could have used an in game tutorial on battles as well, as someone who doesn't play other real time strategy games I could use the help. 

So yeah, if you are a grognard and know what that means go ahead and buy this game, its great, otherwise maybe read a few wikipedia entries on the war to see if you are interested before you spend money.

Das Spiel hat Potential mein Lieblingsspiel zu werden aber im derzeitigen Zustand ist es für mich nicht spielbar.

Bugs und vorallem die schlechte AI machen einfach keinen Spaß

Was müsste besser werden?
-Straßen!!! zurzeit sind die lächerlich. In Cossacks 2 haben die wunderschön funktioniert hier aber nicht.
-Diplomatie. Man sollte das System von EU4 übernehmen. Stattdessen hat man das von Total War genommen und nur leicht verbessert
-Schlacht AI ist zurzeit unter Total War Niveau
-Die Art wie gekämpft wird. dazu hier eine längere Beschreibung die als Vorschlag für den Entwickler dienen sollte

Es gab keine Divisionen sondern Armeen in Brigaden Unterteilt, in der Schlacht hat man Schlachtlinien sogenannte Treffen gemacht welche von hochrängigen Generälen kommandiert wurden und damit die Vorform der Divison waren. Dann maschierten die Linien aufeinander zu und besch0ßen sich bevor ein Charge meist die Entscheidung brachte.
Um das Spiel besser zu machen bitte schaff die Divisionen ab und mach daraus Armeen welche keine begränzung haben. Im Gefecht sollte man Gruppen erstellen können welche von einem General kommandiert werden den man der Armee zugefügt hat für solche Sachen. Diesen Gruppen Befehligt man dann einfache Angriffs und Verteidigungs Befehle. So würde alles verlaufen wie is damals verlaufen würde.

second, this game is a scenario with variablle start dates to select, comparable to the heart of iron series, the earlist start date is 1750, as mentioned it covers a scenario and not an epoche like the total war sereies or paradox titles

there are also some scenario battles

regarding economics, on first sight it may be hard to understand the economic parts of the game, but who did understand every aspect of a paradox title after half an hour play time?
no, there is no need for neverending micro management, it is an economic system you have to balance, develop and adjust to your country's needs

about bugs, i bought the game in january 2016, the dev is constantly updating the game and all of the reported bugs in other reviews or in the steam forum are fixed, sometimes there are some new bugs coming along with new features, but given to the limited recources of the dev it's not that big issue as those bugs will be fixed anyway as soon as the bugs are reported

a few words to the dev Oliver Keppelmüller, he's constantly working on this game, listens to the community feedback and is open for ideas

i can fully recommend this game for players who like in depth strategy games, because this game combines aspects of existing strategy games to a new subgenre of strategygames, that hopefully will succeed

The in-game tooltips and given information has also improved a lot, with the manual explaining most of the game mechanics. What still may remain an issue may be stability. But that too is a lot less common than before. 

The game may not be the most beautiful out there, but the blend of real time strategic campaign, including quite a sophisticated economy model with a Settlers/Railroad Tycoon type of production chains, and real time tactical battles with huge amount of troops and good combination of realism and playability, it is a thoughtful strategy game that brings to mind many of the 1990s classics. 

In short, this game may look a bit like a Total War game (Empire or Napoleon), but it goes deeper and requires more thinking from the player, being less of action oriented: something that I really like.

Let's face it they're a bit of a mess. I'm not sure what is going on most of the time. Battles last a certain length of time and frustratingly  just simply end suddenly without you really knowing which side won!

But the biggest complaint I have about the battles in this game is that they don't 'feel' like European SYW battles. Two things in particularly get me:
1. Square formation - absolutley unheard of in major battles of the SYW. It just wasn't doctrine. Read Duffy, Nosworthy et al if you don't believe me. Lines of infantry simply turned their rear rank. Cavalry rarely took on formed infantry head on - again just not doctrine. There should be no capability to form square in this game.
2. March column - again only used to get to the battle - not a fighting formation in any shape or form. Tactics were linear. Troops formed up in line well before they got close to the enemy.

And what's this thing about forming lines into skirmishers!! Ridiculous. Again more like a Napoleonic battle than a SYW one!",1464189153,1464189348,False,18,5,0.583793818950653076,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I have just over 9 hours of play time . I bought it the other day . I was blessed that it was also 15% off may not sound like much. I live on limited income since a mugging causing perment head tramua in 2004 . I been saving for 6 months to get a new computer and spent 400.00 on the desktop to play this game and few others like it . I came across this game oh 6 months back been following the boards since.
The most impressive items are this is a one person project . I viewd videos of battles said this was impressive one person could design all this . some reveiws  say graphics are bad . I say for one person design are great. I been playing this style before internet with Gary Gigsby's civil war games and  battles of napolian .  was not untill I played a 1/2  battle till I realized oh my the detail this game has in the battles . Name a Big name company this game has the same if not more detail realism into the battle and you can dial it out or in pretty much as much as you want. 
Now when doing the 30 turn tutorial I felt like was the King of England ,there once more is so much detail it blows major other games out of the water .I read the manual before and still after and will most likely print it out or get another screen to pull it up durring game play .  
The developer thought of just about everything and what he did not others did , for whitch he was quick to respond to with his feed back on a patch or disscussion on it.   for example  I was marching a army at REAL TIME was like this game going get old fast . all of sudden the tutorial says go speed up the game once you do this this and that . !!! bam few seconds later was at the place . set speed to normal . another plus orders comands and other tasks can be done while you pause the game . A real big plus . Ever play a space game go modify a ship only to find out the capital was just blown up and you never knew it ... 

So the game off sale is arround 20.00 bucks it is worth every penny of it . this is not a game to sit play casual or I don't think it is . There is a learning curve but the game is friendly about it with the pause button till you know what your doing . the default is auto save one week time i set mine every day  until I can figure out how to manully same several stages of the games progress.
All I can say is with only 9 hours so far into the game I have a feeling this game will be in my top 5 all time best games to play for enjoyability and historicaly ..
please excuse my grammer, spelling the head tramua was a mugging in 2004 that killed me, revived me.I woke up after 3 days in a coma ,18 in ICU  Mike Tyson could not done a better job it ended my nursing carreer as well .

Kampaně jsem zatím moc nehrál, takže k nim nemohu moc říci. Historické bitvy však ano, takže tu taktickou část hry znám a mohu říci, že je velmi dobře udělaná. Grafika sice není jako v sérii Total War, takže se nemůžete kochat detaily jednotlivých vojáků, ale o tom strategie nejsou. Je zde dobře použit prvek ze série Scourge of War, který spočívá v tom, že nemusíte vybírat jednotlivé pluky, ale klidně celou brigádu nebo divizi, takže je vedení bitvy mnohem snazší. A nejen že je můžete společně přesouvat, ale také můžete celou divizi jedním klikem například zformovat v kolonu, linii nebo dvojitou linii. Dalším dobrým prvkem je, že doručení rozkazu jednotce nějakou dobu trvá, takže se nezačně, stejně jako ve skutečnosti, hýbat hned, kdy si velitel armády usmyslí, že by měla. Pro Čechy je jistě také zajímavé, že jednou z historických bitev je bitva u Kolína, kde jsme v roce 1757 porazili Prušáky. Dobře také vypadá obléhání, kde, opět jako ve skutečnosti, postupně budujete přibližovací zákopy a dělostřelecká postavení.

Und für jene die es kennen könnte man dem Spiel sogar unterstellen ein EU4 nur mit Schlachten zum selber spielen zu sein. Das alles würde zutreffen . . . Einerseits . . . Andreseits ist es aber auch eine Simulation mit viele schwächen. 

Der Diplomatie zb: ich kann zwar auf einen blick sehen wie mein verhältniss zu den anderen Nationen aktuell ist, aber ich  weis nicht wie die Nationen zueinander stehen, oder ob sie sich miteinander im Kreig befinden, ein Bündniss schließen ect. Ich muss mich darauf verlassen das sich alles so entwickelt wie es mir im Geschichtsunterricht beigrabracht wurde.

Einheiten rekrutierung: Bei einem strategiespiel das den schwerpunkt auf Konflikt und Kampf legt sollte man meinen das die Einheitenrekrutierung und das zusammenstellen von Armeen sehr leicht und ohne viel geklicke zustandekommen sollte. Nun hier verhält es sich so das man die Regimenter zwar noch in Städten rekrutiert, allerdings auf eine sehr umständliche art.
Bsp:
Stadt A hatt ein garnisonsregiment und keine weiteren plätze um Garnisonen unter zu bringen
Nun führt man Armee B in den einflusbereich von Stadt A um sie mit neuen Regimentern zu versehen. 
Gesetzt den fall man hatt raus bekommen das man die unterkünfte der Garnison benötigt um ein neues regiment aus zu heben Stellt man fest das die Garnison von Stadt A um die Stadt verlassen zu können und somit die unterkünfte frei zu bkommen  eine eigene Armee C Bilden muss. Dann kann man das neue Regiment aufstellen. Sobald das fertig ist muss dieses regiment um Armee B zugewiesen zu werden und die Garnisonsquartiere verlassen zu können wieder eine eigene Armee Bilden das ist dann Armee D Zwischen Armee den Armeen B und D wird nun das regiment verschoben und Armee D Wird aufgelöst. und Armee C wird wieder in die Stadt verlegt und ebenfals aufgelöst nach dem das Garnisonsregiment wieder in das Garnisonsfeld verlegt wurde.
Produktionsketten sind aktuell nicht möglich, und es fehlen noch komfortfunktionen.   

Die Darstellung: Die kampagenkarte selbst ist ehr ""Nüchtern"" man kann versiedene Gebeudetypen (Minen, Forts, Bauernhöfe, ect) frei auf der Karte Platzieren Logischer weise sind Minen und Forts an speziellen Punkten wesentlich günstiger platziert. Ob sie auf der Gefechtskarte auftauchen wenn man in ihrr nähe eine schlacht begint weis ich nicht.

Bisher beschränken sich die Objekte auf dem Schlachtfeld auf Ortschaften, Brücken, und Hügel. Unebenes Gelände gibt es auch das ist aber sehr schwirig zu erkennen, und ein absoluter alptraum für jede Infanterie, den es beschränkt die feuerreichweite im extremfall auf geschätzte 5m
Ansonsten haben sich infrastruktur wälder und gewässen auf den kampfund bewegung der Regimenter und Armeen bisher nicht ausgewirkt. Ich hab jedenfals noch kein Regiment bemerkt das eine Straße benutzt oder sich schlotternd aufs andere Ufer schleppt nach dem es im Dezember einen Fluss durchquert hatt.

Was mich zur KI bringt, die in den Schlachten alles andere als Clever agiert. Der König von Preußen hatt mehre male in der Schlacht bei Leuten seine Armee in einem riesigen blob zusammengefasst und ist sturr drauf los geprescht. keine schiefe schlachtornung an meine Flanke, eine vernünftige Formation, ect Und ich muss gestehen das Schlachtfeld auch nicht wieder erkant zu haben.

Ich kann ja das mal dazu verlinken: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWFhdR0wzc&index=59&list=LLLhPw0Cwb2UR46EMI24OYbQ&pxtry=1

Das spiel ist ein sehr ambitioniertes ein man Projekt mit dem sich der Schöpfer meine ich übernommen hatt. Es funktioniert, es macht spaß aber es hatt auch viele ecken kanten und bugs. aber es hatt auch tolle kleine ideen die einem in keinem anderen spiel geboten werden und einem nähr ans Schlachtfeld bringen.

Gotta love the effort, but I cannot recommend this game.

Its goal is admirable: to be a Total War/Scourge of War hybrid that provides more tactical depth than the former and includes a strategic/operational layer that the latter doesn't.  And it does so with a period of history that has not been the subject of many PC games- The Seven Years War.

However, the execution is not good.  It's currently unstable.  I had crashes in both the battle and strategic maps.  And the stratAI came across as a comatose.  My biggest problem, though, was the game's incredibly complex and unintuitve economic engine.  It seems geared towards economics graduates or MBA students rather than players interested in an 18th grand strategy/tactical wargame.   Why would I want to bother with setting ""selling points"" and ""profit margins"" in a wargame?  I don't.

Also, the game doesn't really assist with its steep learning curve.  The manual is rather useless.  The tool tip aids are incomplete with lots of misspellings and awkward grammar due to the developer speaking English as a 2nd language.  And even the ""Let's Play"" youtube clips are not helpful.  The one player who is regularly posting them seems absolutely clueless as to many of the game's facets.

I fiddled around with it for two hours before deleting it.  Maybe there is a good game hidden there somewhere, but I don't have the patience to dig through the unintuitive interface, poor documentation, and CTDs to find it.  AGEOD's Wars in America or Rise of Prussia do much better with the subject material at the operational level.  And Scourge of War tactical battles are infinitely superior.

The Seven Years War (1756-1763) ist eine recht komplexe Wirtschafts- und Kriegssimulation. Entgegen der Jahresangabe im Namen des Spiels, darf man eine lange Kampagne bereits im Jahr 1750 beginnen und die Geschicke einer der großen europäischen Nationen dieser Zeit lenken. Zur Auswahl stehen England, Frankreich, Österreich, Russland und Preussen. 

Das Spiel läuft komplett in Echtzeit. Kommt es zu einer Schacht wird diese in Total War Manier ausgetragen. Hinsichtlich Grafik, Animationen und Sound darf man das Spiel natürlich nicht mit solchen Genregrößen vergleichen. In Sachen Komplexität, Realisums und Anspruch hat The Seven Years War (1756-1763) allerdings klar die Nase vorne. Müsste man einen Vergleich ziehen kann das Spiel am besten als Mischung zwischen Europa Universalis von Paradox, Pride of Nations von AGEOD, Forge of Freedom von Matrix Games und Empire: Total War bezeichnet werden.

Ich kann die Regimenter (mehr oder minder) historisch korrekt benennen, so wie ichs schon bei ETW und NTW gemacht hatte; um zumindest ETWAS Tiefgang nebenher zu erhalten (ungefähr nach diesem Muster benannt: BB IR No 2 v.Canitz).

Doch dieses Spiel hat ordentlichen Tiefgang, zumindest, was die Wirtschaft angeht - Uiuiui!
Mikromanagement, aber überschaubar.

Son bißchen Victoria light mit spielbaren Schlachten (mit Kommandovergabe à la Sid Meiers Gettysburg - sehr intuitiv, Daumen hoch) - davon habe ich seit ...hmmja... seit Jahrzehnten geträumt (seitdem ich Shaka Zulu im TV als Kind gesehn hab und die Schlachten dann mit Legosteinen, nicht Figuren, nachgestellt hab...)

The game depth is outstanding, there are a lot of options which add to variety and fun: trade and ally with natives, build up complex economy chains, raise your armies on different hierarchy levels, historic events, research, policies, diplomacy etc. First the game elements were hard to understand but the developer added a campaign tutorial shortly after release which helped a lot, there is also a game description on the homepage which should be read!

The battles run smooth and have a good flow although you cannot expect arcade style combat of the Total War series. They seem a bit more strategical and historical accurate, e. g. you have to spend a lot of time in maneuvering your army to get a good flanking position. There are some nice features like playing fife and drum music to gain a moral bonus or delayed order execution.
 
Although graphics and effects cannot compete with comparable 2015 blockbusters they are fine for an indie game in my opinion but you can take your own look on that in the videos and images on the shop site.

The game was quite buggy shortly after release but the developer seems to be fast in fixing so that the game runs mostly smooth right now, maybe there are some balancing issues which should still be improved.

The developer has clearly invested a lot of passion into this game, but I found it unplayable in its current state. That said, I'm going to follow this game's development closely.

Pros:
- Game seems to model to detailed economic and development systems.
- Basic supply seems to be modeled.
- Theres a command-and-control delay implemented in battles.
- Graphics are adequate and reasonable for a indie strategy game.
- Tons of passion and historical knowledge invested into this game.

I use the term 'seems' several times above, as there is a lack of feedback in the UI, and a lot of information is presented in opaque and difficult to understand ways.

Cons:
- This game desperately needs a detailed manual. The video tutorials are a basic introduction, but are insufficient to understand the game.
- UI exposes information in opaque ways. It seems like important informaiton is not presented. For example, in several scenarios, I watched the morale of my armies drop quickly to zero, but there was nothing I could see in the UI that would cause this. Bug? Feature? Can't tell.
- Actions in the UI often work in strange ways, and not always consistent ways.
- Bugs -- many, many bugs. For example, I was sometimes not able to set a policy at the beginning of a scenario (despite having no policy set). Restarting the scenario, I would then be able to set a policy.
- If you have Nvidia NSync, the game crashes on launch. It has to be turned off globably for the game to launch.",1446509749,1446509749,False,68,4,0.777271926403045654,2,True,False,False,False,,,

 - One man band developer who is passionate about the game, and wants to make it the best he can. The developer is highly responsive to feedback.
 - Somewhat outdated graphics, but in a quaint and engaging way, rather than just being a pixellated mess. Building graphics have a level of detail that draws the player in.
 - Ambitious scope (real time, player-controlled battles, trade, economy, diplomacy, research) with a time period that has been very much neglected by other companies
 - Complex and detailed systems that provide a great deal of replayability and ensure mastery will take time
 - Detailed strategy map that segues well and accurately into battle maps
 - Prussia!
 - Challenging

Minuses:
 - There are still a number of bugs that are being worked out (but the developer has acknowledged them, fixed some, and seems determined to tackle remainer)
 - At times certain systems can seem somewhat obscure (this is a plus and a minus - draws you in and is more satisfying, but sometimes frustrating)
 - Still a great deal of work required for battle AI and campaign map AI
 - A number of the systems still require some considerable polish. This game could have benefited from a round of beta testing, but understand likely not within means of developer

Overall, this is an ambitious project that has the potential to be very interesting, and has some unique or new takes on systems that bring some innovation to a genre that has been lacking such innovation for some time.

If you enjoyed the Take Command series of civil war battle simulators or even the more recent Ultimate General: Gettysburg but wished you could have it a grand strategy form this game will probably be to your liking. For someone like me who would actually name the regiments in his Empire Total War armies, and make brigades out of the regiments within those armies, the order of battle and divisional heirarchy system will be immensely fun. Every regiment has a commander that can be replaced if ineffective, as well as its own equipment and level of experience.

The Seven Years War (1756-1763) is definitely not going to be for everyone though. The learning curve is somewhat steep but I found the initial gameplay to be more intuitive than games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings. The graphics aren't very good, but in a sprite-based battle map I can overlook this, though improvements are always welcome. Chances are though that if you're even considering buying a game like this, you're the type of person that would enjoy it.

I do agree with the people that suggest some tutorial scenarios would be nice, and it would be helpful to be able to zoom in just a little closer on the battlemap for times when you want to order individual regiments around instead of brigades or divisions.

This is my first review, because the dev is really worth it to be supported. I did not play the game for long yet, but the game surely has some big potential and the dev is listening and interacting with the community and regularly publishing patches. There are only very few hardcore strategic games in the RTS branch. Knights of Honor or the Hegemony series are a few. This one lets you develop your economy, build buildings, research, build armies and has an XP and promotion system for commanders and armies as well as moral and supplies. 
You can fight tactical land battles and influence sieges in a mini game. Fleet combat is automatically resolved. 
The UI can be improved and there are typing errors and some smaller bugs still present. But I do not have any doubt, that the developer will take care of it. I´d like to see this developer ( and he is really only one person ;-) to keep on improving this game - so I do recommend it to be bought - it is fun already and there are very few games touching this genre at all - and has even bigger potential if given enough success and time. 
If you enjoy Paradox game, AGEOD games, Matrix/Slitherine games and other Grognard strategy games, with pausible gamesplay, then you should enjoy this one too.

I am an old grognard who loves games varying in compexity from Gary Grigsby, through the Scourge of War series to Total War and some of the great mods that have been made.  The point is if there is a new grand stategy game that comes out I will buy it.  No refunds, I will gradually work hard to understand the game and if it isn't quite a diamond in the rough to start with I'll be patient and revisit from time to time.

There is a huge amount of promise in this game.  The mechanics make sense and I do love the passion that has gone into making this game.  I will say straight away that it gets a recommend from me simply because of the ambition and effort of the one man who put it together.

The game lacks finish at the moment, the graphics are poor although you can easily see through this with a bit of imagination.  There are moments where glitches occur to make the game look a little untidy such as words overlapping.  There is also the frustration of not being able to use certain links whereas others take you straight to where you need to go.  All of these are mild problems - as an old grognard I'm used to chasing little boxes around screen and imagining these litte sprites and boxes represent an army or a village.  This is a game where your imagination must get involved.

But it does have a huge learning cureve and this really needs some support.  The tutorials are not good enough but like many others I am already hooked an determinded to learn in stages.  I can see a few big couck ups along the way but I believe there is real hope in this game not least from the positive way that the developer has responded to questions and support.

[i]Update Nov,28: Since the game now features a tutorial which makes the game more accessible, I am now at a point in which I can recommend the game.

Video Commentary can be found here: https://youtu.be/k11-Fc0nkGI

In terms of gameplay mechanics I have to say that the amount of customization and things to do the game is fairly widespread. So in terms of content the game has got you covered pretty well.

However, there are still some negatives to be found in this game:
[list]
[*] Framerate drops when hovering over cities and moving around with buildings
[*] [strike]Research UI is a mess: Due to dependencies spread across 5 tabs, you sometimes have to click 5-6 times to research prequesite technologies.[/strike] [b]Now pretty much fixed with Update 1.083. [/b]
[*] Loading screens inbetween seasons(all 6 months ingame) disturb the flow of the game
[*] Inconsitent UI elements that make it hard to figure out which one are interactive and which are not
[*] Game Requires Direct play, which is a depricated api and in some cases cause compatibility issues(crashes and lags)
[*] [strike]Missing tutorials make getting into the game unecessarily harder.[/strike] [b]Tutorials are now ingame and working properly as of 1.086. An own tutorial for the battle viewer is not necessarily required, but it would be neat nonetheless. [/b] 
[/list]

[i]Update Nov,28: As stated above the game is now in a state in which I can consider a recommendation for it. The pricetag might be a problem to some people, but all in all the content which is in the game is enough in my opinion.[/i]",1446231817,1450335137,True,2,3,0.405120253562927246,6,False,False,False,False,,,
