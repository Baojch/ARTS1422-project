Sugarmill is a very basic small scale city builder that add little to the genre. In fact, it add nothing new. There is no creativity in this game. It also suffers from the same things as other city builders. You spam the map with the same buildings to improve your production and satisfy the needs your pop. Graphically behind compared to other indie games. Mechanicall dull as it brings absolutely nothing new, it only steal other's ideas and uses them like so many other clones and copies of other's work out there. The day-night cycle is dumb since in but a few minute or even one or two minutes depending on game speed, a year has past. So the day-night cycle is completely useless and a waste of resources of the company, even if it is a small thing, that small amount of time could have been used to design an original mechanic instead. Also, the game is all about waiting, you wait constantly, even at x10 speed (there should be a x 50 speed). When you make your players wait they do not play and you lose them. Players want to play a game, not wait in front of a screen... tell me devs, have you seriously played your game for 2 or three hours straight? If not, you should, it will show you how much waiting you do.

Do not buy if you already have at least one base or city builder in your Library since it has nothing new it in and everything it has is probably already in your older game, which is probably prettier than this one too.

Until they can prove that they are original instead of copying other's ideas, it is a thumbs down for me. Way too boring (especially the waiting and uncreative work).",1604151066,1604151066,False,4,0,0.572815537452697754,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I bought this before 1-2 years? Just took a look in different times of developing...

This game looks fine and have some good ideas, but in the end... it´s very very bad and still unplayable.
It´s annoying by the simpliest things...

Turtorial:
- it doesn´t explane the game or how it works, just say what you should build next... learning by doing would be ok, but by this game speed? I was often very close to fall asleep cause i couldn´t do anything... Even you push the gamespeed to highest (10x) it takes soooo long before you can build something new...

Roads: 
- you can´t delete roads, once placed no chance to change.... also nice if you wanted to click some in menu and builded without a wan´t to build...
- you can´t build it far from an existing building... but, when you build a building close to the road (before it says it´s too close), you can´t build your existing road further, cause the building is too close...
- if you see the road is not placeable, then you can right-click to stop, but not have the road build still in active, you need to go back to build menu and hope next time you find the correct place, or same again...

Food:
- you can farm different food, but! everything else than bean are useless... i was wondering why i produce 1000 corn or carrots and only 100 are used, but my storage has none of it?! food expires.... yep but nice to produce 1000 and the people don´t eat this... so better only produce beans cause they don´t expire?
- you can buy fish or meat, but not build an animal farm or fishing hut.... (iam sure in some early access version you can build a fishing hut...)

Wood:
- a main component to build and produce some other stuff... yep, but in turtorial it comes very very late to build one.. and if you build it on the very beginning, it´s produce nearly nothing... in one year with 3 workers: 100... i pushed up to 8 workers and got 100 too... and there were many trees nearby...
- a building costs between 500 or 2500... producing 100 per year means many many many many hours to build one building... that kills the progress of game perfectly

Buildings: 
- if you want to destroy a building, you get no ressources back, yea cause by 2000 wood, there is no 100 wood to save, makes sense...
- if you place a building and want to destroy it, before any builder starts to build it, it takes time before it will be destroyed...
you can priorize which building will be build next, but! not the buildings you want to destroy... and when you want destroy one placed building and want to destroy another next, you can´t... so all new buildings get build before one is detroyed and you get no ressources back if it´s builded....

Storage:
- you have a small buggy window with your ressource in the top left... but when you look into your storage, you don´t see what exactly is in there... you see a symbol of the ressource, but not what this symbol means... there is a function called: mouse over, would be fine when the devs know what that is...

Gameplay:
- you can expand notification window, but it´s allways get closed, when clicking anywhere... 
- you get a sound when a child is born... by gamespeed 10x and people of 100 you will probably hear it very often.... who don´t like to hear a crying children?
- if you don´t take the ""freemode"" you can´t build every building and need a number of people to free it... yep, but problem is, if you don´t have any nails, but need to get this people for blacksmith, you´re lost... (only one example)
- you want to buy a new region, but if you scroll, often the buy mode is dropping... and you have to click it many times again, to get this mode on....
- why you can´t scroll with the mouse? maybe by holding right-click?.... better use your keyboard...
- i could go on, but it´s probably enough now...

Feedback:
- you can give a feedback in the game, but it´s useless... 9 of 10 option are positive... and when you want to write a text, then never use ""n"" and ""spacebar""... cause that will start a new game...

I hope the devs read this and will fix the simpliest things what is needed for this genre... thx!",1580415692,1580416000,False,27,1,0.735534906387329102,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Before I get to my review, however, I need to address some other reviewers:  this game does not come close to comparing with Banished.   Maybe it will reach that point at some point in the future but not at the moment.  Banished is light years ahead of it in everything but graphics.

Now, why don't I recommend it? 

CONS:

For starters, it is based on a really weird premise - you must buy land to develop - WHY?   Who the heck are you buying land from?   There is no one already living where you are building your town.  This is one of the more baffling things about the game - and each new section of land you buy increases in price by $3,000 - again for no known reason.

But that is a relatively minor complaint.  The real issues come when you start playing:  

A Lighthouse is supposed to increases your port's reputation - but it doesn't.  

Citizens flat out refuse to die.   My current game has a bunch of people who are over 140 years old.  This causes severe problems with housing.  normally, when people die, young people move into the vacant houses.  But when old people refuse to die, young people have no place to live so they don't have kids.  If you build more and more houses, you run out of room for other buildings you need and, as previously stated, land becomes increasingly more expensive to buy so you end up with the game in a death spiral financially.

Roads do nothing except make your citizens feel better about their community.  Your sims won't use the roads; they apparently just enjoy having them there.  And the citizens take some kind of bizarre speed drug because if they have to walk very far, they proceed at a normal pace for a short distance then move at warp speed the rest of the way.  It is quite freaky to see and I don't recommend watching them if you are on shrooms - you will completely lose it.

The graphics may look ok, but nothing is scaled properly. Fields are miniscule in size - your average large shack is bigger in size than a medium field.   

A BIGGIE:  the game has an annoying habit of crashing once you are over 100 citizens so you lose all progress unless you literally save every game year.

If you have structures set to build, save and stop playing, when you load the game and resume playing, you will not see the planned builds on the map.   If you click on where they were, the build info will still pop up, but if you forget what you were building or where the new structures were placed, there is no way to see what is in the works.

PROS:

The dev frequents the Discussions pages and responds to input/feedback.

As previously stated, the graphics are decent. 

The overall concept of the game is promising if the dev can work out all the issues.

RECOMMENDATION:

At the moment, this is a game to FOLLOW and see how it develops.   

As with most Early Access games, issues are common so if you are looking for a polished end game, this is not it.  However, if you like Banished-type city builders/suirvival games, Sugar Mill deserves watching.",1508181552,1508181843,False,80,5,0.774257361888885498,6,True,False,True,False,,,

It's still in EA but it is very playable even at this early stage. It must be because I have played almost 100 hrs and still very much enjoying it.

What I like about this game is the freedom to build as you see fit, experiment with different starting positions.

Graphics are superb and the accompying music fits in very well with the theme of the game.

I love the diversity of the buildings too.

It's a slow game at the start but it gets extremely entertaining the further you progress.

Yes, there are still some bugs but the dev is very keen to receive feedback so he can fix the bugs.

The dev is very comitted to this game. Nice timely updates and hotfixes too.

From the Roadmap there are lots of additions on the way. What a great game this will turn into and I can see myself building up lots of many hours in Sugarmill.

If you like this type genre then this is a must game, not only because it very playable and with a unique setting but it has a dedicated dev behind it.

Its improving all the time so there's lots to look forward too.

Enjoy Sugarmill and what it has to offer.

First impression shows good promise to a really good village sim. The devs seem to really support the game and is one reason I bought it, just by the number of updates in last month.  I have already come across a bug in first try. Bulldozer Icon gets left on the map with no way to remove it. If I click on bulldozer again it just gives me a new one with old icon still on map. As I play it more and learn more I will update my review. Would recommend to friends or anyone who likes this type of game. I do hope they add workshop to game and make it moddable later.

Update: After playing the game for couple of hours now I find it to be a very enjoyable game. It being early access you will come across a bug, but you can easly report it to the dev with a in game bug report function. Few things I have found missing that I would like to see is that you cannot build a well to get water. You have to trade for it. Maybe add a bath house to promote health, a water tower for storage to supply a large settlement. Introduce illness and injury's to the game and add a docter and hospitial, herbalist to make medicine. Some workers should be at higher risk of injury then others, like miners. A ship should have chance of bringing in a disease. 
And finally should add some decorations to the game to fill in some empty area's . Things like flowers, trees, benches, fountains, statues. etc..

Game is well worth the $15 price tag to me. Graphics is good at high settings and wouldn't overload a lower end pc. Not everyone has a super computer.

A contrario, si comme moi vous n'avez pas aimé Banished, vous allez avoir du mal avec SugarMill. 

Oui, dans son état actuel, SugarMill n'est ni plus ni moins qu'un clone de Banished en early access. Bon, il y a quelques détails mineurs qui les distinguent mais c'est tellement peu, essentiellement l'existence d'une monnaie utilisée pour le commerce au lieu du troc (Commerce avec qui d'ailleurs ? On n'en sait rien, peut-être les marchands de Banished ou les Vénitiens d'Anno qui se seraient égarés dans un repli de l'espace-temps. La scénarisation se fait sentir par son absence). Mais comme Banished, SugarMill n'a pas d'économie interne. A quoi sert donc cet argent ? Bonne question ! Et bien à acheter des terrains autour de la parcelle initiale, à la manière d'un City Slyline. Ouais, bof, il fallait bien une utilité au flouze, n'est-ce pas ? 

Il y a aussi un onglet militaire, qui, de ce que j'en ai compris, propose quelques batiments en vue de prévenir les attaques de pirates alléchés par votre commerce florissant. Tellement fondamental dans l'esprit du (des) concepteur(s) que les pirates sont optionnels à la création de partie.

Sans que ce soit réellement étayé par du concret, au vue des listes de construction possibles à ce jour, j'ai l'impression que SugarMill pourrait finir avec un peu plus de bâtiments et de produits que Banished, ça nous aménerait quelque part entre Banished et Banished+Colonial Charter. A condition qu'un prochain patch dote SugarMill d'un vrai générateur de carte, actuellement c'est le service minimum sans aucun paramétrage du terrain de jeu.

Dans ce type de jeu, personnellement, je reste déçu par l'absence de personnalité et de gestion des citoyens. A part réagir individuellement aux besoins de base, ils sont totalement désincarnés et interchangeables. En réalité ce qui m'a le plus plu dans SugarMill, c'est l'énorme envie qu'il m'a donné de rejouer aux Tropicos.

Voilà, en forçant le trait, je dirais que si vous aimez le city-building un peu moutonno-autarcique dans une optique d'équilibrage plus que d'esthètique, foncez. Si vous vous passionnez pour des aspects plus commerciaux ou logistiques ou politiques ou simplement pour réaliser une ville proprette et jolie tout plein, bah tournez vous vers... euh y'en a plein en fait.

I can have faith in the developers, but this game require quite a lot of work to reach that price!

1) Improve ALL the compartment, then this could become an honest 15 € game.

Within five minutes, two bugs. First, I could not get the buldozer to work. At all. At times clicking the icon gave me some helpful ""hey, right click to cancel, left click to delete"" but neither right clicking nor left clicking did anything of substance. Then, while placing a road, I got a notification and upon moving my mouse a giant red area appeared on my map.

TIP: To assign workers, there is abutton on the bottom right (looks like pages), click that button, and then assign workers. I found I had to assign more workers to the masonry to get goods moved to and from buildings.

The gameplay itself is very intriguing so far. It's fun to play. There are many products you can make. You can import, and export via the dock many products as well. There is also a pirate threat one you become more profitable (I haven't gotten this far yet). I believe eventually they plan on adding random maps, or more maps at least, but the starting map they give is a pretty good size. You can expand by buying plots of land on the map as well. 

Children are born, people age, you can click on people and follow them and see what they are carrying as well as details about that person.

If you're looking to support the developers I'd recommend this game. If you like this genre of games, I'd also recommend it.

Overview
Sugarmill is a city simulator with an emphasis on economics and resource management. It is currently available through steam as an Early Access game. The developer is Aatlantis Code, and it was released Dec, 2016.
The player starts out with a minimal amount of workers, a fixed amount of resources in storage, and the main goal is to survive and prosper as a community. Threats include: pirates, starvation, exodus, as well other concerns.
Though there is a pirate threat, it seems there is no PVP in the game yet, but there are military construction options that act as a sort of deterrent.
The game offers unique aspects such as resource expiration (like food spoiling), management of carts and carriages to move supplies, and villagers needing places to live—as well as needing their own specific material goods that will continually eat at your resources.  
All those features being said, it is important to note that as of this date many of these features are still in development and need balancing.  

graphics
The graphics host a traditional top-down view of the game similar to other simulation and RTS games. The game does do a good job on presenting perspective in the correct way on building and villagers, and each building seems visually distinct. 
That being said, the graphics are basic, and textures could use some further attention. If you scroll around the map you can see vast areas of bland greens with some trees.
The graphics do the job, they are simple, but there is no confusion on what and where objects are.
It would be nice to see some refinement of textures and an ability to zoom further into the village to see small details. One of the aesthetically pleasing aspects is to see the working running around in busy patterns, and being able to focus on these micro patterns would be quite pleasing. 

Sound:
The sound needs a lot of work. Volume controls are rough and touchy, the soundtrack volumes vary greatly, and various ambient sounds are loud and off-putting, but all that is forgiven in Early Access.
8 One objective concern is the soundtrack itself. On Sugarmill’s website it seems that the music in the game is more than a placeholder, and we may see it as the final product in the game’s soundtrack. The music itself was enjoyable at times, but overall the soundtrack seemed uninspired and bland. There were times where I found myself enjoying the soundtrack, but overall I was not impressed.
To me, one thing indie games can do well is the sound. I feel that being small provides a special ability to be flexible with music, and it can really set a game apart from the rest. I feel if this is the music that is going to be used in the final project it is a missed opportunity for the game to set itself apart from its peers. 
To be clear, I am not calling the music bad in itself, but rather it is not the best fit for this particular game. 

Plot
The game takes place during the 16th century during England’s colonial expansion period in the Caribbean. The actual townspeople come from a crashed ship that washed ashore the island, and all the pressure of surviving is on you the leader. There are two options: reconnecting with the Crown or establishing a permanent settlement on the island you find yourself on.  
One main goal of the game is to establish a port to allow for imports and exports to allow for your settlement to thrive. This initially takes a long time, and as your port influence increases you receive more clout, and more shipments will come in faster. As your reputation increases, more trade ships will come to support the island.
While the main goal is to promote economic prosperity, each advancement your group makes attracts the attention of ever-watching pirates. To deter against this threat your group will develop military outposts and military technologies. 

Gameplay
The game uses a combination of macro and micro controls, and means of player influence is dependent strictly on the allocation of workers. You assign workers to various tasks, and they set up the various resources available for the community.
This is a top-down strategy game that focuses on building and workflow management, not specific unit control. Think more like the SimCity series as opposed to Age of Empires or Command and Conquer. 
The focus is on influence, economy, and security. Though you will construct military outposts, weapons, and dedicate units to defense, there is no actual combat in the game. To my understanding, there is a Pirate Threat threshold that, if passed, will result in an automatic game over. 
The game in its current form does have some obvious bottlenecks. One main area of concern is in resource gathering. Undoubtedly, the game needs to work through to balance the costs and gather rates to make a more fluid system.
As for understanding the mechanics, prepare to learn as you go. There is a complete lack of tutorial and online references currently, and information it limited. 
There were times where I found myself setting the pace to 10x speed (the fastest in the game) and I still was sitting back twiddling my thumbs—waiting for various resources to gather. I believe this is due largely to the Early Access aspect of the game. Hopefully more balancing will come.
The amount of gameplay currently available lacks depth, but the core system this game employs is immense. As it sits now, the amount of content available in the gameplay department is very limited, and every player interested in this game needs to weigh that fact heavily when considering purchasing this game.   
The Devs have laid out a roadmap for the game, and they state there will be weekly updates on the game every Friday on Steam. The next three major update milestones are set to be December 23rd, Jan 20th, and February 17th. These updates focus on integral components of the game such a balancing, new buildings, and added depth in character mechanics and buildings. A current list can be seen on the game’s website.

Conclusion/rating:
I played over 10 hours of this game, and I felt I experienced everything it has to offer at its current state. That being said, the development team seems dedicated to listening to its consumer base. I felt encouraged as I played, reporting bugs and making comments was at the forefront of the experience, and as I played the game, it actually had a balancing update. 
The bottom line: this game is for people that are prepared to have limited gameplay at the moment. Buying this game is more about being involved in the development process, and anyone who has strong passions about the genre may benefit from a purchase. 
The Steam reviews seem to mostly say the same things: The potential is immense, and the game needs a lot of work in its current state. 
I give this game a conditional buy status, and anyone interested in the game should consider the scope of the game in Its current state. 
I hate a great time with this one, and the devs seem passionate about bettering the game. 



Past Post:
Hey, just giving a preliminary outlook. I bought the game today, and so far I am impressed with the mechanics. I am looking forward to doing a full review for the game, and as of right now I would suggest it. I will update this post as I get more hours. Below is a link to some gameplay that is longer than any I’ve seen so far on YouTube. Hope this helps, and I will update soon.

Not much has improved or added to the game...
It doesn't add anything new to this genre...

I'd probably just sit back and wait for the reviews to improve to see if it gets better but there are a ton of other games that can scratch that itch for city building.",1482109047,1604205237,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With Early Access, it feels as such as parts of the game remains incomplete. It is playable to a certain extent with resources being able to be extracted an absolute cinch. There are just a few complaints from me at this very moment. When the game is patched up a bit more, I wiil come back to this review to decide a new score.

The first complaint has to do with placement of certain buildings, particularly mines. It is quite difficult to discern where a flat terrain starts and a mountaineous region begins. The building rather follows the height of the mountain, making the mine impossible to build even though the required area to be on a flat land is already as such.

The second complain has to do with land purchasing. It is impossible to buy some lands that have mountains. It is bad enough the tutorial does not explain how to buy land, but buying some hilly land is downright impossible as the signpost is now hidden inside the hill, impossible to be clicked on.

The third complaint is about the laborer system and work queues in most working buildings. The masonry is used to build almost all the buildings in this game. However, there are sometimes the work queue for certain buildings disappear. If you delete the unbuilt structure, the other unbuilt buildings will appear in the queue. This is especially true for pottery workshops.

Also, at times, workers in the building will just disappear and appear later in the game. Is this due to the gender of workers?

The game is playable to an extent. Again, I will return to it at a more patched period for a review.",1482054153,1482156469,True,8,0,0.52377617359161377,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Offensichtlich ist eine Anlehnung an Banished erkennbar, aber dieses Spiel geht einen Schritt weiter und bietet nicht nur mehr Waren sondern der Schwerpunkt dürfte im Handel liegen.
Hier zeige ich einen kurzen Einblick in dieses Game:

My initial impressions : The game has great potential. I hope the community doesn't come down too hard on the developer for the current state of the game. Yes, the graphics are pretty basic and the textures are not quite polished, but you have to look beyond that. Having played for a couple of hours now, I see the game has depth, e.g. one of the achievements is to reach 1000 people to unlock new buildings etc, that's pretty intense!
Allocation of workers is a bit confusing, I think there needs to be a ""professions"" menu, because as it stands now you have to highlight every building in order to increase/decrease workers. One thing I did notice is that workers will only go to jobs closest to their homes if the pay is the same in each profession. Only when I increased the pay scale for a farmer did workers go there.

The developer has produced a Roadmap of where the game is heading, you can check this out on his website.

I'm pretty sure the feedback from people who buy the game will help the developer enormously. He has stated his intentions are to make this game the best in its genre. Let's hope so.

One more thing......when a baby is born, get ready for a loud noise that will make you jump the first time you hear it!

Finally, give the developer  time guys, I think he has something good here if given the time to fine tune it.",1481891773,1481891773,True,25,1,0.629323065280914307,2,True,False,True,False,,,
