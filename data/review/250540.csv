On to it: Art is wonderful, story is cool and combat is fluid for most part.
Now I got two main points regarding the later: 
-Constant chatter of the characters mid combat - combat here is not turn based and there are no voice overs, so it means combat stops in the middle of action for really lengthy conversations between MC and his AI. I love the flavor text you guys use however for combat information it is really long winded. Either give us a text only tutorial accessible anytime in the game or make info more on point and or only at the start of a battle.
-Don´t make us lose itens when we lose, just gives a straight game over like most games do. Or at least give us an option like ""Normal mode - you just get a game over when you die"" and ""survivor mode - you lose your itens when you die and can try again"". I mean it is not an easy system and being fast means we can also lose quickly and losing itens with that is really bad.

Basides those two points, loving the game thus far :3

With Kickstarter, there's a 50/50 chance the game you're backing could be like Shovel Knight, which became a surprise megalomanical hit or this, which slowly degenerated it's development over time and caused both the fans and the development team to give up on it. 

There's nothing I can really review about this game that hasn't been said. It's less tactical and more real time focused, a button-masher with confusing and sometimes difficult gameplay. The first demo from the kickstarter and subsequent demos were real-time tactical gameplay but were more rewarding to play based on the limited tile spaces, even with my obvious bugs.

追加 2016 Feb 11： 另外这个游戏在steam安装时显示要占用我2200MB的内存，然而游戏本身只有60mb的大小，就算是为了后期更新余留了空间是不是也太夸张了点？ 更新完毕之后游戏可以用shift打开商店，目前没有任何问题，但是我只要一将召唤兵带入战斗，整个游戏就出现问题，表现情况为：人物可以移动，但是攻击时攻击动画和音效明显鬼畜，并且敌人受到攻击后会保持硬直状态不断飙血并无法杀死敌人。 目前只碰到过3次，但是都是使用召唤兵之后的第一次战斗出现问题。

Backed on Kickstarter based on the pitch in the middle of 2013. Played the alphas, liked where it was going. Seriously, look at the difference:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1054244612/c-wars-roguelike-pixel-art-pc-game/description

Tons of radio silence throughout this, of course. There was limited mention about why things were taking so long, what was going on with the team, etc. Eventually I just forgot about it.

Then, suddenly, they went to Early Access. Man, was I excited - I thought the alpha must have progressed enough to warrant releasing it on Steam! But... alas... it wasn't the same game pitched at all. It didn't feel the same, the battlefields weren't structured the same way, my dreams of playing this on a touch interface were basically shattered.

What happened? Everyone, including the dev, said to give it time. Fair enough. So, after August 20th, 2015, I waited. I figured, well, if things need to be overhauled, that'll take a few months, right? Three? Why stop there? Let's wait 5, just to give it extra time.

Man, what a let down. I know it's early access still, but this game's two years past the original deadline. It feels like a flash game, it runs like a flash game. 

Activating the ""grid"" to see movement literally puts hex outlines in a checkerboard pattern on a square grid, and the player can only move in the four cardinal directions. The controls for keyboard are rather poor. The best part of the game, the animations, are choppy and have a limited amount of frames each (it's like they were animated on fours rather than twos or ones) and the sprites themselves are low detail. It's hard to get into the game when it's so clunky, but the majority of it seems to be moving from battle to battle with little to do inbetween. The combat itself is tedious to the point that I'd rather just go do chores.

I can't recommend this game. I'll probably let it sit in my library until it's out of early access (if that happens), but it's on my ""remove from account without refund because it's that bad"" list.",1454225646,1454225884,False,56,0,0.788954079151153564,1,False,False,True,False,,,

TLDR Game Description: Are you aware of the megaman exe series before? If you are, this plays a lot like it, if you aren't the units here move in real time along a grid, and you move on the grid to dodge enemy attacks and launch your own attacks. The game mechanics are extremely addicting as it is reflex and tactically based, there are lots of times you can die but you will want to retry it. 

Yeah so, just a background C-Wars was actually a game pitched in kickstarter more than 2 years ago, the dev team underwent severe issues both personally and financially and as a result the game spent time in development hell and entered early access by the skin of its teeth...this is the reason why the game has a lot of negative reviews when it was first launched it was really closer to a tech demo than an actual game. 

FORTUNATELY, the dev team went into super saiyan mode and started releasing daily updates since then, right now I can say it can be positively compared to other EA games in terms of actual content, and consequently is now worth the EA price. For the price of a cup of coffee you get beautiful pixel art, ok music and fun and frenetic gameplay. I suggest you buy it now because the price will likely increase. 

I mean at the end of the day the game is receiving daily updates, patches, bug fixes and various quality of life improvements so it will definitely be worth your purchase. Buy it now and encourage them to improve the game even more. Plus, it is highly original this is the first megaman exe style game I've seen anywhere apart from the original megaman exe games themselves.",1447999556,1447999556,True,17,0,0.434944778680801392,0,False,False,True,False,,,

A lot of reviews comment on the fact that you're not getting a lot for your money. There's hardly any content, and it's incredibly buggy. These reviews were posted within the first day or two of release, and do not reflect the current stage of the game right now. This is, after all, an early access game. Oni-punks have been releasing near-daily updates, adding content and tweaking bugs since release. Is this a finished product? Not hardly. But what it IS is a taste of what the final game will entail. 

You have a grid, you move on the grid, you attack your enemies. Conserve your ammo, choose your targets, and time your attacks properly to avoid reprisal. There are three characters, each with unique weapons and abilities. Each has a set of stages through which they must pass, along with optional side missions. Since that first release, bugs have been fixed, the stages have been improved and organized better, and the game in general just feels better as well. As I said, it's still more of a demo than anything, but it's growing steadily.

In time, you will have helper characters, along with a wider variety of heroes and weapons from which to choose. Sure, it's been a long time coming, but it's heartening to see these basic building blocks, to know that the game DOES exist.

So they threw out alot of their kickstarter animations , characters, I didn't mind the whole level redesigns, again I thought it was going to be bigger and better, so no updates since march of last year, tottally diffrent from kickstarter, while they didn't tell anyone about the redesigns when it came to EA, to now where they commented on this review ""We'll continue to work hard to fill up the content and be entirely reachable for feedback and suggestions."" can be taken as a false

With that being said, let me be perfectly clear: This is not a game. This is essentially a limited demo with pretty much an hour worth of content. Due to the incredibly unfinished condition of this ""game"", I cannot recommend it to anyone. 

When it comes the game itself, what it provides it decent enough. Three separate characters, each with their own missions (although they barely vary) and they all control pretty differently. 

EDIT 8/20/15: They now have a prompt that shows the control scheme, which alleviates some of the issue of not knowing what's going on.

That's not nearly enough to understand what's going on with multiple weapon types, ammo counts to manage different ranges for each and much more. You end up fumbling around until you somehow find the magic attack that is strong against the particular enemy type. Gameplay aside, there is practically nothing left. No story, no customization, very limted sound and music. 

After waiting two years after plunking down cash on this project, I am horrifically disappointed that this is all they've had to show. I pray they are able to crank out updates on a regular basis to flesh out what is essentially 99% of the remaining content.

All you get are 3 Characters, who get no introduction, you just select them in one of the worst select screens I have ever seen and are just thrown into the game...
And now you are stuck with this character, because the only way to get back to the select screen, is when you beat all available missions with that character. Which is near impossible with those controls. 
Your character is moving on a invisible grid and can only move one space at a time and when you are finally close enough to hit an enemy, he will just dodge it because the attack animations are too long. 
Take the gun, pose a bit, aim straight forward, shoot and put the gun back to where ever you've got it from. 
I see what they are trying to do, (I guess) they want to have a mix of real time and turn based combat, but that is one of the worst attempts to do so, that I have seen yet.

The goal in this game is quite simple, collect money, upgrade and buy ammo, trying to get to the next level and enjor the fun!
Even right now its early accesss version but I can still see the potential of this game.

Great design, great music, however, still a long way to go!

Good: 
* Daily update since the initial earlyaccess release
* Gorgeous pixel art
* Sci-Fi action game & Tower defense
* Looks like Megaman battle network
* Gain your XP by eating bread and worms

Bad
* [strike]I could use a jill sandwich but [/strike] I don't like bread..

To be honest, the current gameplay is straight forward enough: Realtime combat; Tower Defense element; Control your hero and make combo; Try to survive as long as you can in different missions, and, it looks like Megaman battle network, seriously! 

For a humble price like this, $7, plus at least 2 hours play time and replayability, people are still complaining? With the free backer keys on top of that? Really? 

Sure there are  stuff need to be added. The game needs a final touch too, but, it could be a great game. Plus, I can see there are more coming, like story, store, item management and stuff. That's why it's still a early access product isn't it?

I am a backer of this project myself although I backed it thru paypal not ks but I still love their KS video which is pretty funny. 2 years ago, honestly, I only backed the project because of these fancy animations.

Now? It's more like my type of game.

That's my 2 cents.",1439783461,1445970509,True,68,4,0.556941866874694824,6,False,False,True,False,,,

Missions basically played like real-time chess, characters move on squares while a bunch of enemies spawn that you take down using abilities, 1-use items and anything else that goes boom. Levels didn't seem to be randomly generated as suggested, not sure if that's a bug or WIP. Gamepad and mouse controls were available but only keyboard worked for me. Asking price is fair given the current content and with everything said, if a fan of tactics, pixel art and anime it's worth at least keeping on your radar.

Beautiful pixel anime graphics, great unique real-time action combat in a block-based battlefield system. There's a bunch of characters to choose (3 at the moment), more to come I'd presume, all with their own unique weapons an play style and missions. Same with the enemies, there's a handfull of them with their own unique attacks to tackle.

At first I was confused with the game's combat when I looked at the trailer, was it turn-based combat or real-time? Turns out it was the latter but placed in a block-based battlefield system.

You can't say no to this game for that price. Althought it would be great to have mouse controls, please devs? =)

Just to counter the cons people are saying about the game:

-""certainly nonfunctional""
= it's functional and working just fine.

-""There are no indications as to what the controls are, or what you are trying to achieve within the game.""
= there is indications of what the controls are, and what your objective is in the game.

-""There is no explanation of what the game's system actually are.""
= Yes there is, which is the controls description",1439555386,1440275073,True,63,3,0.523963689804077148,2,False,False,True,False,,,
