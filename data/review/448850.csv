The controls are excellent, it feels so smooth and easy flying your ship. Even in some of the more labyrinthian levels it rarely gets disorientating and the combat is frantic and fun.
The graphics style sits somewhere between retro and modern and explosions are really cool with sparks and particle effects flying everywhere. I think it looks great.

This is kind of a niche style of shooter but if you like this genre you will know exactly what you're looking for and Overload has it in spades.

So I'm near 40 years old and grew up on Descent, it was basically all there was to play on PC for years back then. This is just Descent 4, there's no real way to put it.

It's a good game, but I'm only a couple hours in at this point. Obviously, if you're a Descent fan, there's no real reason not to buy Descent 4, since those first few games were legendary. And since this game was poorly marketed even I didn't know it existed until now.

Off the bat, one of my criticisms is that you can definitely feel that the developers are from a different generation. This primarily comes from an aesthetic and movement perspective. The aesthetic of this game feels like they took the old geometric approach to Descent's design and just updated it with modern graphics engines and slightly overdid it with the lighting and effects. It's not a bad thing, but hopefully as they explore further iterations of this game, they can work on the atmosphere a bit to feel a little more organic. Turning off lens flare and decreasing some of the shinyness actually makes the game look better.

Desecrators is a more recent roguelike game that is basically Descent 4 as well, but as better movement and more intuitive, streamlined QOL in terms of how it plays. Graphically, however, Overload is better.

[i]Overload[/i] is a decently enjoyable, though occasionally frustrating, game. My review is focused on the general gameplay and the campaign, played once using a joystick controller and then keyboard and mouse. I have not played multiplayer, so this review does not address it. Overall, I would give it a high 7/10. The gameplay is excellent. Yet, some maps lean more towards tedious rather than difficult. This detracts from the overall experience.

[h2]Overview[/h2]
[i]Overload[/i] is a 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) game, where you pilot a spaceship in a ""zero-G"" environment. The ship is armed with a variety of energy or ammo based primary weapons and secondary missiles. The player dogfights with drones in a maze of tight corridors, finding keycards to progress through the level, and destroying a base reactor. The player is confined within tunnels and rooms, where are no open-air locations unlike other dogfighting games. Various pickups, from health to special powerups like invulnerability, enhance the player ship. There are also upgrade orbs, which can be collected to upgrade the ship between levels. For those familiar with [i]Descent[/i], the gameplay is fairly the similar; for those who are not, think of a shooter like [i]Doom[/i] with the addition of vertical movement. 

The campaign is short, with a total of 16 campaign levels and no secret levels. Depending on your playstyle, you may range between 4-10 hours for your first campaign playthrough. There are five levels of difficulty, in which higher difficulties increase enemy projectile speeds and reduce the effectiveness of health/ammo pickups. A player can save at any point and the game only autosaves at the start of a level.

[h2]Gameplay and Design Review[/h2]
Map design is the main aspect that makes or breaks the experience of [i]Overload[/i]. When done well, a map allows the gameplay to shine. Large hallways and rooms allow for greater maneuverability, which makes dogfighting far more enjoyable. Some levels have good enemy placement, in which the player is neither overwhelmed nor unchallenged. A good level can also be completed without a reliance on powerups. However, there are some frustrating maps by virtue of poor design (I say ""poor"" because it relies less on skill and more on foreknowledge). Certain enemy types are unavoidable if placed in short corridors. There are also cases in which particularly deadly enemies are hidden around corners or behind doors. Sometimes, this results in unavoidable damage (especially when no invulnerability power-ups or homing missiles are available). As such, this will necessitate save-scumming and cheesing enemies by knowing their location. This is especially true for higher difficulties, in which enemy projectiles move faster and health pickups are reduced. I found the final four levels to be the most frustrating because due to the combination of enemies with tight halls and blind corners. Expect frequent deaths and make liberal use of saving.

There is a decent enemy variety. Most drones are fairly simple and pursue the player, while some hang back and attack from a distance. Enemies seem to attempt to dodge player attacks, though not to an extreme degree. Weapons are a mix of slow and quick projectiles, with some enemies firing a whole barrage. Fortunately, nothing has hitscan weapons (no Class 1 driller-like enemies). So, everything is technically dodgeable. That said, there are occasions where a barrage of fast moving projectiles is essentially unavoidable. Some enemies fire homing projectiles, which can also be dodged provided that the player has room to do so (which, depending on map design, is not really possible). One criticism about enemy variety is the underwhelming variety of unique functions (consider the spider drones from [i]Descent 1[/i], which split into smaller drones when defeated). Most enemies in [i]Overload[/i] simply attack and are destroyed, which may get stale without more varied behaviors and functionality.

Regarding the player controls, [i]Overload[/i] has a nice variety of weapons and movement is smooth. The ship's maneuverability is very good, allowing for effective dodging and dogfighting (map permitting). There is a nice variety of primary weapons, which I believe are viable. Each has a unique function, rather than simply being a variation of the same basic attack. The missile variety is mostly useful, each distinct from others. Some are best saved for particular situations, based on map and enemy types. The player also has a ""smash"" attack (charging into enemies). While some weapons have fast projectiles, most energy weapons and all missiles have a slower travel time. This will require decent predictive aim, but the most enemies in the campaign do not usually dodge rapidly (multiplayer will doubtlessly be different). Some weapons have or can be upgraded to have tracking, which reduces the aim requirement. I found that aiming with a mouse is far better than with a controller, as the quantity of enemies in some levels requires fast and steady aiming. Playing with a mouse also allows for more reckless (therefore, fun) combat. That said, a controller is still viable to complete the campaign.

[h2]Closing Thoughts[/h2]
In conclusion, [i]Overload[/i] is a decent modern 6DOF game. The enjoyability relies primarily on the map design, in which the campaign levels are hit or miss. Beyond map design, the gameplay is smooth. I have no complaints regarding the movement or gunplay itself, beyond what is possible given the level design. Mouse and keyboard is preferable to controller, but it is playable with either. If you are looking for a more open-air dogfighting game, [i]Overload[/i] may not be your cup of tea. For those who do enjoy the 6DOF genre, I can recommend this in addition to classic titles (though, given its length and price you might hold off for a sale).

[i]Overload[/i] also works well on the Steam Deck with about 3 hours without charging (that
said, I experienced occasional stuttering).",1703106123,1703106905,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'm only 2 hours in and already I'm hooked. Overload is a blast and represents a piece of gaming that's been lost to us for so long and I am HERE for it. This is what I've been waiting for decades to have again and if it wasn't for the imminent release of From software's return to the Armoured Core series later this month I would be spending every gaming second playing the bejeezus out of this little gem.

For the uninitiated, Overload is a ""6 degrees of freedom"" (6DOF) shooter. If you like FPS games, imagine doom, but where you are essentially floating all the time and can go up and down at will as well as left, right forward back and the usual strafing movements. While it sounds like it can be confusing, it quickly becomes intuitive to move around as the controls are basically standard FPS controls with the ability to 'fly' wherever you want by pushing forward to move wherever your camera is pointing, even if that's straight up. This lends a measure of verticality to the level designs that makes your environments more immersive and combats more strategic and more intense than your average FPS. 

Overload lays on the atmosphere thick, borrowing every cue it can from it's spiritual predecessor, Descent. The sound cues, colour palette, level atmosphere, gameplay loop and even the 'corporate doing bad things' story  are taken almost wholesale from Descent so you'll feel right at home if you've come from the any of the Descent series. If what you were looking for in a game was ""Descent, but modern"" and somehow you missed this, stop reading my review and but this right now - you will not be disappointed at all.   If you don't know what descent is, read on and I'll tell you why this may appeal to you.

Imagine flying through a starbase or the innards of a moon in a space hovercraft armed to the teeth where every robot worker you meet wants you dead. As you work your way through the environment uncovering tunnels, rescuing colonists in cryosleep, you're looking for a reactor to detonate the facility and wipe out all the robots and whatever naughty things the bad corporate types were up to in one fell swoop. You set off the reactor's meltdown sequence and then realise, "" I can't teleport out!"" so now you have to dash back through the facility looking for an emergency exit before you explode with the facility....
It's a rush and a far more atmospheric and tactical experience than 90% of traditional FPS games. If the passage above piques your interest or makes you think ""That could be fun"" then Overload is for you. Go get it. 

If you are still on the fence, 6DOF style games bridge a gap between space combat sims like colony wars, X-wing/Squadrons or Wing Commander and traditional FPS games like Doom, Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem, or Serious Sam. I draw the Doom comparison more due to the themes (moonbases where bad stuff happens and what was once good now becomes bad). People who like the idea of Space Combat but who typical can't get along with target tracking or flight controls will find 6DOF style games better suited to them as a 6DOF game doesn't have the typical flight control issues, target tracking or constant moving. If you stop, you hover. So, if you are worried about tracking targets or getting lost, don't worry. this game feels like playing Doom but where you have wings. 

While Overload seems to have been written for people missing Descent (like me!), the devs have made this a very friendly experience for people new to the genre. Multiple difficulty modes, an excellent automap, a little drone to help you find your way around if you get lost, a clean UI, accessibility tools, fully remappable controls and controller support with a well thought out default control scheme help a newbie get involved at their pace easily. There's also a great training mode and plenty of things to find that isn't just ""shoot the bad guy and panic"" so the gameplay loop doesn't feel stale as you learn. Getting started is easy and if you are used to FPS games rather than flight sim games you can even invert your Y axis to act more like you'd be used to in a traditional FPS game. 

For the vets of 6DOF games all the options you'd expect are here: Multiple weapons to discover, upgrade paths for your arsenal, plenty of secrets to find, story bites through discoverable audio logs, mouse and keyboard or flight yoke support, a plethora of graphics and audio options, VR support, online multiplayer. There's a lot to like here for the newcomer or the veteran.  

In play, the game is smooth and the textures work well. Lighting is nice and the flares/headlamps work very well to light darker spaces. Control is smooth, whatever methods you choose, and audio cues for waiting robot foes are present so you can be clued in on imminent ambushes or hidden doorways. The map is so much better than the old Descent map and reminds me a lot of Sublevel Zero's map system. Audio in combat is meaty and the weapons feel varied with some thought put in to how to make the various missiles look and feel different from one another both is visuals and effect.

As far as drawbacks are concerned there is one I've encountered - interactables in the environment aren't always super clear. The first you come across is a big red button. When you see it for the first time you may dismiss it as a light or a grill but once you know what it is you'll be looking for more. It's, admittedly, a minor gripe in an otherwise excellent game.

If you are looking for a 6DOF or your next Descent-style fix, or if you want something different from your usual FPS or space combat games, Overload has what you want. Get it, get lost in it's winding tunnels, let the story carry you away and try not to call yourself Material Defender while you're scrapping robots.

It really was the gateway game for me that brought me into PC gaming. Sadly, with the implosion of Parallax Studios and Interplay, what remained of Descent also imploded in the early 2000s.

That being said, I have not found a game quite like it, that plays and handles the same way since then, until I played Overload. I actually gave it a shot, and after some enjoyable game time, and some follow up research, I found that it was a group of the original Descent crew that put this project together. The music has the same grunge sound. The ship handling and level atmosphere are, for being a different engine, identical, in my opinion. I put on my VR headset with this a few times, and it was so realistic that I was getting dizzy. 

I honestly wish my little brother hadn't passed away because he was my wingman in Descent when we were teens. I believe he would have enjoyed this just as much if he could get his hands on a pair of x-52's.

It plays almost exactly like Descent. Given how easy it is to die you'll either be saving a lot or relaying stages a lot. Games back then weren't known to be fair and this game is no different. The difficulty curve is also all over the place, going from super easy to super hard back to easy in the span on seconds. If you're fine with that you might enjoy this.

My big complaints are the environments are very samey and so are the enemies. It makes the whole experience kind of blend together. Rooms often look very similar. Given how labyrinthane these games are, samey environments make navigation a chore. The navigation drone is almost required and feels like a crutch for this.

I also wish they'd done more to modernize the game, making it more fair, while keeping the challenge. It really needed something to make it stand out from Descent. It seems the only real big addition here is the upgrade system which feels under baked.

I'd only recommend this to die hard fans of the genre but even then there's far better titles in it. Even the original Descent (which has aged like milk) had more interesting enemies and environments.",1689292980,1693623139,False,1,0,0.496661126613616943,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Overload revives the long forgotten original 6DOF FPS design. Alongside the Tribes games, Descent was one of the most unique shooters ever made. It was innovative, complex, addictive, and damn hard. With the current boomer shooter revival, it was time for Descent to make a comeback and here it is. Overload executes Descent's unique mechanics perfectly and arguably better. You once again have 6 degrees of force, labyrinthine levels full of secrets, secret levels, multiplayer that takes serious skill, and a hard-as-nails campaign. Seriously, there's a reason only 2.1% of players have beaten this game...ON MEDIUM.

The 16 missions featured here are huge and confusing to navigate. You'll be checking your automap often. Navigation is something that people have complained about for being unclear and nauseating. I can't speak for how it'll make your head or stomach feel flipping around constantly. I played Project Wingman in VR, so it's hard to really make me nauseous. By the way, this game has a VR mode and it's awesome. Regarding the confusing design, you can always check your extremely detailed map or just use the hologuide which will literally show you exactly where you need to go in real time. It'll even come back to guide you if you get separated. I'll agree with the complaint that levels aren't visually distinct much. Every few levels take place in a unique location, but they look similar until the final levels where the game goes from challenging, but fair, to cheap enemy spawns and SPAM. As a Descent fan, this game is much easier than those games. Much of the difficulty is mitigated by an easy mode (Rookie) for newcomers, upgrades between missions and the quicksave feature that can be used almost anywhere any time. No shame in spamming the F8 key.

This is as much a skill-based shooter as Quake or Unreal. You gotta move constantly and be as accurate as possible. Spatial awareness is king here. The enemy AI is just as smart as it once was in Descent. They will wait until you enter their room, dodge your shots and surround you. The enemy variety is excellent. You gotta learn their quirks to optimize. There are a ton of primary and secondary weapons each with their own strengths/weaknesses. My favorite is the Driller which kicks like a mule and drops enemies from afar. The game sounds incredible with great punch and variation to each weapons' shots. Combine that with an amazing atmospheric electronic soundtrack and it's a feast for the ears. Game doesn't look bad either. Levels are colorful and enemy designs are really distinct and memorable. There is a story here and it's well told. You'll find numerous audio logs from the personnel working in these overrun facilities fleshing out the background lore that explains what went wrong. It's also fully voice acted which is a nice touch. The story is nothing mindblowing, but it provides context. Too many boomer shooters coming out with literally no plot whatsoever which is fine, but nonetheless, a missed opportunity.

Overload is the total package. It's got everything you could possibly want in an old school shooter or Descent game. Once you've finished the campaign, you can always go back to find the secret levels, play on a higher difficulty, play the Challenge mode, play some of the user made levels or engage in deathmatch online. There are multiple endings by the way, but I won't say how to unlock them. I believe this game is worth the price. There aren't really any major gripes I have here. Maybe I'm biased since I'm a Descent fan already, but I'm feeling a 10/10. Now would someone please bring back Freespace?",1688180324,1688180324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The game plays exactly like the ""originals"" (for those not familiar, they play mostly like a first person shooter, but in 3 dimensions), with slick 6dof combat in enclosed levels.
Weapons feel balanced (none of that godawful plinking away at 10,000 hp grunts that you sometimes see), movement is response, and the visuals are fine. No performance issues either.

My only complaints are that the explosions are a bit too detailed; obscuring whats behind them for too long, and the map sucks. (The 2nd to last level is also a nightmare to navigate).

Luckily Overload does not have the same problems that D3 did. It stays very true to the original D1 and D2 formulas of ""clear the mine, find the exit, memorize the escape route, blow up the reactor, get out before the mine explodes."" This time your ship has a more interesting selection of weapons, and an upgrade system that you'll probably never max out, even in a New Game +.  In short, it's as faithful of a throwback to Descent as you can get. It's basically Descent remastered, with the gameplay polished to a mirror shine.

Short version: If you liked Descent, you need to get this game. If you've never played a 6DOF FPS before, this is the game to get because Overload does the best job executing on the idea. Highly recommend.

Does Overload do anything wrong?

One thing I wished they did was to have a better tutorial. There's a few new features that can be easily missed or misunderstood. For example, better explaining what those red circles found in the levels are, how to spot secret doors, the fact that holding down the flare button will launch a sticky flare, and the smash attack which seems to really only be useful for speedrunners, but apparently gives you back shield energy? See, it's not clearly explained in the game. Players have to consult FAQs and guides understand what the ship can do.

The level design is routinely dark, relying on headlights and flares for visibility. I'm always playing with my headlights on. Apparently flares do alert enemies (again, needs a clearer tutorial). And most of the exist require little to no planning to get to when the reactor explodes. Your map only lets you drop one marker, and sticky flares is not mentioned in-game (that I can remember). So if they tuned that part of the game we would have had some more exciting races to the exit.

All in all, the game is great. Played the game twice and I'm now going through the challenge modes. I may even buy the two community packs for the game.",1674067663,1674067663,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Overload delivers on that intent.  Let me take a step back to show you my history with Descent, and with other nostalgic re-releases, so I can truly tell you how much I appreciate Overload.

It was the first game I really got into as a kid.  I couldn't beat the boss on the 7th level, so I played the first 7 levels (up until I got to the boss room) over and over again.  I got to the point I literally beat the first three levels with my eyes closed.  Not just beat, but 100% - picked up the hostages, hit all the secrets, killed all the enemies, blew the reactor, and escaped in the time limit.  It was on the easiest difficulty, but hey, I was like 7 years old.

Flash forward to remakes of games.  I've played many expansions and sequels to games I've loved, and come away with a bitter taste in my mouth.  Nostalgia plays a huge part in my interest of a game, but not in my enjoyment of it.  In order for a game to be enjoyable, it has to be a good game.  It has to take what I've loved and retain it, and take what could be improved and made better.  A prime example of this is the Star Wars: Battlefront remake.  I loved the original Battlefront 1 and 2.  I hated the remake of Battlefront 1, and did not even bother with Battlefront 2.

Now, let's actually talk about this game.  It is close to perfect as a spiritual successor to Descent.  One thing it does, that very few games nowadays do, is it doesn't have a pricing plan that's designed to milk players for all they're worth.  But that's not the half of it.  Overload maintains the high-octane action and 6D freedom that Descent had.  

The main campaign is much improved, with the addition of voice acting and and upgrade system, as well as some missions that aren't just ""kill reactor and leave"".  You actually get a benefit for rescuing the hostages (er...collecting the cryo-chambers) instead of just getting points.  The addition of the challenge mode is very welcome.

However, there are a few things I think could be improved.  For one, the lighting contrast is so stark, that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on.  I think it was easier in Descent to tell enemies apart, because enemies had a distinct shape and color that you could clearly see.  In Overload, the eyes glow so bright you can't really see much of the robots.  The textures in the map don't do a good job of orienting you which way is up.

The secrets in the maps are sometimes very arbitrary.  Some doors are locked, and it's not very clear how to unlock them.  Sometimes there's a button you can destroy to unlock or open a door.  Often times I'll destroy one and then not even know what it did or what it opened.  I think this was also a problem sometimes in Descent II.

It would help in the campaign if there was a way to keep track of how many upgrade points you've found so far in a level, as well as if you knew how many there were.  That way I know if I want to keep searching or make my way to the reactor.  Similarly, an option to replay the level if you didn't get everything.

And, while Overload does have some game modes that Descent didn't (or didn't invest as heavily into), one thing that Descent had that Overload doesn't is a cooperative mode.

Overall, the game hits the nostalgia button just right.  It feels like Descent in all the right ways, and improved in just the right places.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it's a million times better than most reboots.",1673586435,1673586435,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's not a bad game, this is a great game, technically speaking. It's well put together, the overall format, the gameplay loop, the basic good things.
I just can't recommend it.

There's a story of some sort, but I ignored it because the premise is bad.
80% of the game just has you as an anonymous pilot destroying miner robots due to reasons.
In the final 20%, there's alien levels, where the pilot actually gets a name and is related to the characters, and is actually cool on the face of it, but is too little too late.

It's a fun game, sure, but it's hard to say if it ever felt like it was supposed to feel.
A lot of the game was spent finnicking the controls to get them just right.
It's most fun to rotate around the enemies ""trichording"", but there isn't much space for that.
It's a step down from Aquanox in many ways, story and sound among them, of course.

On sound, some of the guns sound good while others sound really bad, and some of them are just really not worth using.
The default gun Impulse sounds good, but isn't so great to use, while the Cyclone is great to use, but sounds like a flimsy laser. 
Driller sounds great, but is very weak. There's a shotgun equivalent (not Flak), and it sounds great, but it's semi-auto fire. 
I have a most hated gun, Reflex, simply because it sounds so bad. It does not sound like something that would hurt a person, nevermind metal.
The worst gun is Thunderbolt, it just really is not worth it. It's a charge shot, semi-auto, you hold then release the mouse to shoot. You have to charge every shot for it to be useful. So sluggish.
There's the Lancer weapon, but there's little ammo for it. It's an endgame weapon, and by that point you can't upgrade anything anymore.
It really doesn't meaningfully differentiate itself from Impulse, besides charging the puzzle locks in the last levels (like the Thunderbolt).

I forgot, the levels. They are fairly lengthy, which is nice, but some of them are symmetric, and I'm like, what's the point, are you kidding me? The environments already look similar to one another, having symmetry makes it worse, and it's plainly uninteresting.
Another reviewer said the levels are just abstract things put together, and he is right, I noticed this right away. The story says the robots are miners, and so the levels are mining structures, but that is bullshit, it obviously isn't the case, visually.

The part I hated the most was the visual design.
1. It's unclear which objects are interactable and which aren't, and they share designs. For example, there's two glowing red lights, one is a circle, another a triangle. The circle one activates doors around the level, the triangle does nothing. If the circle was interactable, maybe it should glow green instead? Basic things like that.
2. Enemies, when exploding, cause too much visual noise even at lowest particle settings.

I also hated the fact the sticky flare glows less than the ordinary flare.",1669975155,1669977837,False,1,0,0.460452079772949219,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Note for Steam OS users: If you run Multiple controllers, you might find the controller has stopped responding in the menu.  Go to ""Reorder Controllers"" and set the preferred controller to #1.

When I played Descent for the first time in the 90's, it blew my mind - 6 degrees of freedom, 10+ weapons!  Even more stuff than Doom!

Now, decades later, I played the updated Doom, and I wondered if there was an updated Descent as well.  Yes, it's this game (not Descent Underground, which is not great).

Everything about this game gives me flash backs of my childhood -- zipping around the mines, destroying robots in tight corridors.  Being older now, I have more patience looking for secrets and exploring, and this game delivers on that too.  Everything about this game just screams fun, and I could not put it down.  My biggest complaint about Descent as a kid -- navigating the maze, has been helpfully solved with a guide bot that leads you through (but doesn't reveal secrets).  Unlike Descent 3, there aren't any obtuse puzzles that require you to visit a Wiki.  

The game is all about zooming down tunnels and blasting robots.  With a side helping of exploration and secrets finding.

My complaints about the game are minor -- 2nd tier upgrades can't be undone (unlike new Doom games, where you can swap on the fly).  The orientation of my ship in automap can be tricky to discern.  And finally, the hud turns off by itself sometimes and doesn't come back unless I reload an earlier save (I'm mostly playing on Steam Deck, if that matters).  

Someone did mention that if you don't find secrets in a level, and progress on, you just missed out on them for the rest of the run.  That's correct.  The upgrades are mostly discoverable if you look at the minimap, as they tend to be either in side paths, or in a bulging box that sticks out from the of an area.  There are also excellent Steam guides and Jbode's videos revealing them, though I do understand that tracking these down may not be for everyone.

In short, I missed Descent, and if you are tired of playing the same FPS over and over again, this might be something to look forward to too.",1668369292,1669602837,True,12,0,0.611435651779174805,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I play this without VR, though I have a headset. It's good both ways, but I'll probably stick to non-VR.

After playing for a bit more, the level variety is a bit lacking. I'd love to have some different levels that feel different. I guess they are all space stations and mining stations so how much variety can we have but i dunno; maybe it would be cool to be in one of those big spinny habital rings? going through the vents or something? would be nicer to see something a different colour at least.

e: finished the game; the level design changes eventually, though IMO it should have happened sooner! the later levels can be confusing. lots of flying around after you've killed everything to try to find the thing you obviously missed, and you can't use your holo thingy anymore.

Six degrees of freedom is, from a design standpoint, both really cool and a very fertile ground for new experiences. But also, because of how uncommon these types of games are, it's a dangerous gamble. The rules are different, the dynamics are different, and the player has to get used to a lot of new concepts, so you can't use the same tools as if you were making a traditional FPS.

I really want to say that Overload nails it. It gets a lot of things right, with really fun combat and visuals, movement feels very nice with a lot of customization options, a compelling, well acted story and loads of content.

But the reality is that it gets more wrong than it gets right. There's a lot to discuss regarding outdated design decisions and problems with the control scheme, but the main issues, for me, reside in the level design.

The navigational issues present in 6DOF games are not helped at all by abstract, Classic Doom-like level design. With such a developed story and lore, you'd think that the levels would be constructed as recognizable bases, science labs, mine shafts, etc. But this is almost never the case. Only late game are some environments used to communicate a place, but still with the same labyrinthine level design, made even worse by the fact that certain very important guiding systems are disabled. In general, nothing identifies what is up, down, left or right, and areas do not flow logically. So, you get lost. A lot. Adding to this the abundance and importance of secrets, most of the game is spent floating around being unsure of where you're going.

There are many other things wrong. The weapon selection system is truly terrible, the default control scheme is weird, and the game kind of overstays its welcome. But most of these thing could be forgiven if the levels were designed with easy navigation in mind. It saddens me, because Revival didn't deserve to go under, and a sequel could have fixed all these issues and made a truly amazing game. And what's here is a fun and unique experience.

I can't sincerely recommend it, unless you're ready for a particular kind of experience. The kind that Descent fans would enjoy. This definitely feels like a game made for the fans, but sometimes, relying on nostalgia ends up working against you.

I am an old school Descent fan, having played all the games back on their original release in the 1990's.  Even bought a Voodoo FX 3000 card just to play Descent 3 on back in the day of the Pentium 2 processors.  I have been playing Descent 1 ~ 3 recently (using the Rebirth Mod) and having a blast.  So I was searching Steam trying to find an updated Descent clone to play and I stumbled across Overload.  I was reading about it and found that it was made by the original Descent Team.  Instant buy for me.  I have been playing the game and it is great.  Great graphics, great sound, great enemies, great 6D maps with tons of hidden paths and items.  I was stoked <3.

Then I was reading in the forums about how the Dev Team had to shut down in 2019 since sales were poor and my heart broke  </3.  These guys did a hell of a job on this game and they should have been met with fanfare....

The level editor was something I really immersed myself in in 2018 and made a few levels using some I had made for Descent 1 or 2 in 2006 (as well as Titan Core and an Overload version of Tethys Mine, which by the way is possible on Insane but just extremely hard to avoid getting blown up at the very beginning - I have done it).

The OG Descent devs got together to make a spiritual successor to a classic, but forgotten FPS series, And boy what a ride it is!

For those of you who are unfamiliar a bit of a history lesson. Descent was released in 1995 by Parralax Software, it was a First person shooter that used an honest-to-goodness 3D engine and instead of being locked on the floor and running around as an infantryman, like in every other FPS game before and most since, you are in a Zero-G environment and pilot a vehicle thats more akin to an Attack helicopter with an array of energy weapons and missiles, only you can freely rotate, and strafe in any Axis. You thought circle strafing in quake or unreal was nuts, Add a vertical element to it! And there you have Descent! You fought Mining and security robots gone hayware from a computer virus in all the games, rarely killing actual people (Mostly accidentally in 3, completley on purpose in 3 Mercs). I completely missed out on underground but I've heard it ended up being and unfinished buggy multiplayer-focused mess that was canned by a shady publisher who screwed the developers over in the end.

As A kid I played a LOT of Descent 1 and 3, never quite beating them (1 had limited lives and very long levels, 3 was buggy and I could not progress due to a crash bug on the moon mission, I did play and beat the uneven Mercenaries expansion however), only picking up 2 when it became available for GOG, 2 Ended up being my favorite of the three for its incredible pacing, UX improvements, and Soundtrack (nevermind some VERY satisfying weaponry). 

1 was innovative and a technical marvel at the time but could be a slog and had cheap enemies. 2 Ironed out a lot of 1's rough edges, by introducing an optional guide bot that was locked behind a cage at the start of each mission that would lead you to each key and eventually to the reactor or boss, passing up secrets as a drawback (it would come back annoy you like Navi or Fi in the Legend of Zelda games if you deviated from the path). and 3 (and it's expansion Mercenaries) was structured a little more like Goldeneye over DOOM, being more objective focused rather than ""Get all the keys and kill the reactior and escape"" adding in puzzle elements to the mix, while it helped vary up the level design, the implementation was hit-or-miss.

The reason why I went on this history lesson is because Overload Faithfully preserves everything good about D 1-2 (and some elements of 3, like being able to spawn your guidebot anywhere and some weapons) and then improves on nearly everything it brings back. Really writing the history of the descent games will explain 80% of what overload is

Descent's weapons did feel kind of samey but in Overload, They all have different tactical applications and gimmicks. There's even an upgrade system that allows you to fine tune your playstyle and encourages exploration more! Audio logs flesh out the story, SPAWNERS CAN FINALLY BE DESTROYED, and modern options can even help alleviate some of the motion sickness the series is famous for inducing (FOV Sliders reportedly, I never had this issue but I know its been a hard sell when I try and hype it up to my friends)

Given that service's slow, corruptive sublimation by Amazon and the fact that Overload is on its own merits a very good game, I had absolutely no issues repurchasing it here on Steam, especially given that I didn't have the DLCs or a VR headset the first time around.

Overload is a newer title from many of the people who worked on the classic Descent series, including the co-founders of Parallax Software and composers from all three Descent games, and plays very much like those games with a variety of quality-of-life improvements, as well as VR support. The game is fully playable in VR but the limited FOV coupled with the intense lighting effects made it less comfortable then playing it standard.

For those unfamiliar, Overload, like its spiritual predecessors, is a ""6DOF"" FPS, meaning ""Six degrees of freedom"". As you are in a spacecraft within a zero-gravity environment, you can move, look, and fire in any direction, and so can your enemies. If this sounds like it would cause you to become nauseated or disoriented, it very well might, so beware. It also has harsh, tron-esque lighting effects that can readily cause eye strain on some monitor setups or if you have sensitive eyes to begin with, like myself.

Here's the setup: It is the year 2118. You are a gunship pilot stationed aboard the service vessel Iberia, bound for the moons of Saturn, to which you have been sent by mining corporation Juno Offworld in response to a distress call from their subsidiary of Cronus Frontier. Their complement of ""autonomous operators""; a fleet of curiously aggressive-looking mining robots, have seemingly gone violently haywire. Assisted by the Iberia's AI, Mara, you will have to enter Cronus' various mining and support bases, battle the auto-ops, retrieve the cryopods of any survivors you might find, and then, destroy the reactor and beat a hasty retreat before the facility collapses in on you.

Overload's campaign plays out over a series of increasingly complex and mazelike levels littered with enemies, equipment and secret areas. You have a full 3D map screen upon which you can place markers for navigation, as well as a ""hologuide"", a construct similar to the Guidebot of the Descent series, but this time completely invulnerable. The hologuide by default will lead you to the next sequential objective to proceed through the mine, and can be instructed at any time to instead lead you to supplies, enemies, or cryotubes. Sometimes it can find secrets in this way, but for most you will be at the mercy of your own wits for those- or at least, a number of very helpful steam guides.

You begin Overload's campaign with a simple ""Impulse"" dual laser cannon and dumbfire ""Falcon"" missiles, but you can find a range of new primary and secondary weapons. There are both energy-based primaries that draw from your ship's energy supply, shared with your lights, afterburner, flares and hologuide, and ballistic ones that draw from a seperate ammo pool: My personal favorites are the Cyclone, a rapid triple-shot energy cannon, and the Crusher, a nasty dual shotgun that imparts considerable impact force on enemies, often screwing up their aim. Secondaries include various missile types and a few outliers: Rapid-firing Swarmers, seeking Hunters, mine-like Creepers and more. In genre tradition, Overload trickles in new weapons and enemies one or two at at time per level over the course of the campaign, and the weapons can often be obtained one level earlier then they are formally introduced in the pre-level briefing screen if you find them in secret areas.

New to Overload versus Descent is a persistent upgrade system. Scattered throughout the levels, both in the open and in secret areas, are green glowing Upgrade Points, as well as purple Super Upgrade points. Every weapon has an upgrade track with a linear upgrade for the first level, bought with the regular points, and then a choice of two final upgrades, purchased with the super points. Passive upgrades are linear and include, but are not limited to, more damage reduction, reduced self-damage from explosions, more movement and boosters speed, and removing the energy cost from boosting, flares and headlights.
It is possible to fully upgrade everything, though not in a single run. There is however a new game plus feature.

Overload also follows in the footsteps of Descent 3 in particular, with a greater emphasis on plot, character and worldbuilding. Each mission is prefaced by a briefing from Mara, who also periodically contacts you in-mission with updates about the evolving situation in the Saturn system. Along with scattered audiologs, all of these are fully voiced, telling the story of a mysterious plot by Cronus head honcho Gabriel Kantor to ""prepare humanity for the future,"" and the events leading up to the auto-ops' sudden attack.

At the time of this writing I have not sampled the multiplayer mode or the two DLC campaigns, comprised of community-made levels made official, with half of proceeds from such going to the level creators.

Overload is of course a treat for returning Descent veterans, but I urge anyone interested in old-school first person action to give it a try. It's not typically mentioned in the context of the retro-FPS revival but I believe it  deserves to be counted alongside games like DUSK, HROT and Supplice.",1657903534,1657904000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Anyone giving this a negative review is either WAY too nitpicky or isn't a fan of this type of game. I was always a big fan of the Descent games (all of them). I'd always wished they would make a new version of the original with today's graphics. This game does exactly that. It's a slightly different story, different name, but same ideas and most of the same cool weapons and features. But, who really plays a game like this for the story? I just love gliding around blasting stuff and figuring out the little puzzles (which amounts to finding key cards and hidden switches).

I like everything about Overload. The music, sound effects, the story, and of course the graphics. Most of all, I enjoy trying to find all the secrets, power-ups, and captives in each level. I love it when you enter an area, the exits all get blocked and alarms go off. There's going to be a fight. This is classic FPS beautifully rendered and perfect control. The controls by the way can be completely setup your way.

Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. If you're an old-school DOS/WIN95 FPS game fan from the early 90's, you need this one. 10/10 for me. I would love to see more from this team, especially a sequel to this one, perhaps something akin to Descent: Freespace (another old favorite - a starfighter game you can actually play that doesn't have 40,000 buttons to remember).

The multiplayer doesn't work without downloading another app.  The main mission is too short and the puzzles aren't even close to the originals complexity and imagination.  Oh yeah, and there are fewer weapons.  In a nutshell, just less of everything that made the original Descent series so amazing.  My advice is if you have a VR headset wait till it goes on sale.  At least 50% off. or better yet, find an old copy of the original series (D2 was my favorite) and play through that.

3. Achtung Spoiler: In der Mission vor den Alien Leveln gesammelte Upgrades k√∂nnen nicht mehr genutzt werden.

7. Die Steuerung ist ein wenig unrund.

Positiv: 
1. Die Gegner KI ist einigerma√üen ok.

I love this game and have played through it multiple times.
There are also community levels you can download and play, some which are very creative. There is no Workshop integration though, the easiest way to find the community content is probably through the Overload Discord.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
In Overload you control a spacecraft within mining facilities on Saturn's moons. You'll fight your way to rescue captives, destroy reactors, and then escape before they explode. The game's 16 levels are labyrinthine interior environments full of cramped spaces and variable lighting. Navigation is aided by a hologram wayfinder, automap, flares, and headlights. These tools will prove useful as you'll need to explore thoroughly for weapons, energy, armour pickups, audio logs, security keys, and upgrade points used to buff your weapons and ship between missions. Rescuing captives is optional though provides rewards and impacts the game's ending. 

Your 16 weapons are split evenly into two groups. Primary weapons are your main guns ranging from gattling lasers to flak cannons. Secondary weapons are explosives ranging from missile launchers to time-slowing bombs. Separate weapon wheels for each group makes for convenient swapping. All weapons have two tiers of upgrades, the second of which is a choice between two options. For instance, you could opt to improve your missiles' homing ability or instead go for a straight damage boost. Enemies vary in their own weapons and maneuverability posing ever-greater threats. In addition to standard foes are three boss battles spread evenly across the campaign. 

Story is delivered between missions and during play with additional details found within collectible audio logs. The game provides quicksaving and manual saving, with no in-level autosaving (that I'm aware of). Overload includes a campaign, newgame+, multiplayer (not reviewed), and two challenge modes. Challenge mode is a series of 12 separate maps to destroy as many enemies as possible either within a 5 minute window or as long as you can survive. XP earned from killing foes in all single-player offerings go towards permanent ship upgrades in challenge mode. Weapons in challenge mode are levelled up from scratch each time you play a round. 

An uptempo soundtrack complements the action. Overload includes 50 Steam Achievements with the majority attained by less than 1% of players. In a little over 16 hours I beat the campaign on the 3rd of 5 difficulty options as well tried most of the challenge mode maps.

[h1]Critique[/h1]
Midway through the campaign I was having a blast but upon beating it was left underwhelmed and disappointed. A good first impression made me willing to overlook a misstep or two. But the further I got the more problems arose to the extent they could no longer be ignored. The freedom of movement, the combat, and the majority of the level design was well executed. Hunting for secrets was just as fun as winning battles with both offered in equal measure. Though I amassed a series of minor gripes what killed my enjoyment was a lack of consistency and, more glaring, an unfairly balanced difficulty.

Upgrade points are mainly found in secret areas, a design I've hated since 1997's Jedi Knight forced secret hunting to improve Force powers. That said Overload is a lesser offender, for though it's doubtful you'll locate every secret you'll still find enough to upgrade all the things you'll actually use. During my run I was able to upgrade my mainstay weapon to maximum, all of my ship upgrades, as well as most of my preferred secondary weapons. Annoyingly, around mission 9 you'll lose your ability to upgrade entirely, despite the fact you'll still be acquiring new weapons. 

Like in the campaign, when you level up your weapons in challenge mode you are granted a choice between two options. Unfortuntaely the options aren't described, instead referred to with generic names like Missiles XL. Lacking a Codex to review upgrade options you won't have a clue what you are choosing. Since enemy and weapon descriptions are often provided before campaign levels I found the lack of a Codex strangely absent.

All of your secondary weapons have their own ammo counts and you'll use them all. Primary weapons don't have ammo that is collected, but rather that is pulled from one of two of your HUD's status bars. This was confusing, something I only figured out for myself after beating the campaign, reading the manual, then going back to play around some more. Some weapons use energy while others use ""ammo"" represented by the white bar. You won't need to swap primary weapons since enemies don't have particular weaknesses and most fights will be fought in a confined space. Because of this, slow firing weapons are terrible. My preferred weapon was energy based and energy is in great supply. Frankly I feel the white status bar could have been removed.

Secondary weapons are the most inventive yet some are lackluster with others downright annoying. The Vortex is one of the last acquired yet barely deals any damage. The Time Bomb is the worst offender as it literally slows things to a crawl. Three time-limited powerups can also be found consisting of a weapon boost, invulnerability, and cloak. These work fine but not when placed in a secret area you'll never locate when beset upon by enemies when entering a new location.

Overload's biggest issue is that it is less about skill and more about managing saves. Without autosaves you'll rely on quicksaving, and should you not make additional manual saves at high health, you can find yourself in unwinnable situations. Certain level sections make avoiding damage impossible, such as when you are locked or teleported into a small room surrounded by enemies. These moments are made worse by the fact that found health pickups are finite. I'd often quicksave with less than 100 armour expecting to find a boost later on, only to instead be thrust into a confined space where enemies would destroy me in seconds before I could get my bearings.

Enemy spawn stations and wall turrets that can't be destroyed, secrets tied to time-limited escapes, and forced weapon swapping to open doors can all be attributed to poor design choices in what I initially thought was a really good game. And don't get me started on the story. Oh, a virus has turned autonomous machines against the crew of an expensive mining outpost? Rather than just save the crew and destroy the machines, blow the station up too. That makes perfect sense.  

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
The level design is good. The soundtrack is apt. And the challenge modes make for quick and fun combat. In light of its problems I can only recommend it on sale. Should you buy it, take my advice. Set the difficulty to Rookie, don't obssess over every secret, find a weapon that works for you, and make manual saves too. EVERSPACE and Sublevel Zero Redux offer similar combat with more consistent design and can often be found at a discount. I would have been happier had Overload been outright bad. It nails some of the hardest things to do right. I'm saddened by how little it would have taken to transform my frustration into complete and utter delight.

[u][b]Premise:[/b][/u] In 2118, you'll operate a multi-purpose service vessel (MPSV) donned the ‚ÄúIberia‚Äù registered to the Cronus Frontier which is a subsidiary of Juno Offworld Automation.

You, the ostensibly [i]unnamed[/i] pilot, will awaken and be contacted by an AI named ‚ÄúMara‚Äù onboard the Iberia. Mara informs the pilot that an outpost on Ymir, a moon of Saturn, has had its operators ‚Äî what are mining and security drones in the facility ‚Äî  malfunction and become hostile. During the mission, the pilot learns more about the tumultuous relationship between Juno Offworld Automation and the Cronus Frontier CEO, Gabriel Kantor.

The story is exclusively told through preamble voiced text before each mission as well as audio logs found throughout the levels. The voice acting is quite good. Anecdotally, Overload feels a bit like System Shock, Red Faction and Perfect Dark 64 if they were all combined and re-imagined as a 6DOF game. Of course, this game actually made by the same devs as ‚ÄúDescent‚Äù under a different banner ‚Äî appropriately named ‚ÄúRevival Productions‚Äù. Chiefly, Matt Toschlog, Mike Kulas of Parallax Software (now called Deep Silver Volition) and Luke Schneider of Radian Games.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
[i]Most[/i] level objectives are straightforward and.... unchanging. Typically revolving around very light exploration to find security keys, then going through the subsequent security door and destroying the main reactor. That or destroying a boss ‚Äî then escaping. On occasion, you'll run into lockdown sectors that you need to destroy the subsequent security in order to leave , other objectives might include destroying a smaller reactor to de-power a security gate. Nearing the end however, this slightly changes. For narrative reasons, you need to pass through portals after supplying them with enough power. All without the aid of your holo-guide.

The game does not take place in ‚Äúouter space‚Äù so much as it's inside of outposts and facilities around the moons of Saturn. A sort of ‚Äútunnel shooter‚Äù.

If you're unfamiliar with what ‚Äú6DOF‚Äù means, it essentially means you've got full control of pitch, yaw and roll movements of the ship. ‚Äú6 degrees of freedom‚Äù. A number of movement aids are available if you're easily disoriented, such as auto-roll ‚Äî this can be augmented to the degree of which it is active with both strafing and mouse movement adjustments. 

6DOF games require a bit more spatial awareness than a traditional shooter. For instance the sight-lines are different, were this Call of Duty or Battlefield, you'd be able to reasonably predict where an enemy may appear around of the corner ‚Äî being filled with ground-faring creatures. Even in something like CoD: Advanced Warfare or Titanfall, you can make a reasonable prediction that enemies' center of mass will appear just above the ground but not so high that your aim is perpendicular to the to the ground. Otherwise, a rough estimate can be made where a player could reasonably be wall running. In Overload/Descent, or in any 6DOF game for that matter, anything could be anywhere.

However, if you get lost, you can assign the holo-guide to track specific things on the map. Need more power? Tell it to guide you to an energy center. You can't overcharge there, but it can get you out of a bind. Have no idea where to go next? Tell to it to guide you to the next security key/gate. This of course only works in facilities assigned to Cronus Frontier.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2631696831

There are enemies in which their first parameter for attack is simply ramming into you ‚Äî occasionally they will attempt this in a relatively furtive way. You'll be exploring for secrets, power-ups or what have you and all of a sudden this big metal beast will smack you on the side knocking you around.   With the clank of your metallic hull combined with the antagonistic engine sounds and the operators make, this surreptitious ramming can make you feel rather vulnerable ‚Äî especially if you already feel uncomfortable with ideas like there not really being an up or down.

[h3]Misc[/h3]
Operators break up nicely. You can see them ignite from the inside and become inactive, ultimately sending them careening to their demise. Recognizing when they go inactive can save you a fair amount of ammo.

You can find upgrade points throughout stage. Used to increase stats like maximum ammo or damage from specific weapons.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2631686786

There's a challenge mode with its own separate unlocks and progression. But there is an NG+ after the campaign is completed.

Headlights draw small amount of power, which is acts as health underneath the shields. So it behooves one to use flares instead. They can also help reveal clocked operator positions ‚Äî plus they look really cool.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2631686770

There's also cross-platform multiplayer, though I would not suspect it's very active.

Weapon variety is pretty decent. Everything from standard lasers and missiles to time bombs ‚Äî and I don't mean a bomb with a timer, I mean a bomb that slows down time itself. There's also chain guns like the Cyclone that increase its rate of fire the longer the trigger is held, creeper mines that slowly seek out operators among many others.

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
It's a very fun, fast-paced and challenging shooter ‚Äî especially on higher difficulties. There's not a lot of variation in the level design or mission objectives, which can be a real bummer. The story is actually pretty intricate and compelling, that is, if you actually pay attention to the mission briefs. Personally, I would wait for a sale, as I don't think what is here will satisfy people that are not actively seeking out a modern replacement for Descent.

1.) My top savegame will randomly be replaced by a several months old ""ymir save"".
...Not only the top ones, other are starting to get replaced too, and they are OLD savegames, like im not sure all of them are actually mine... they could be from other players too...
2.) At one of the later levels in the game, as soon as there are more than 2-3 enemies, it will drop fps to maybe 10... Which would be explainable on older hardware... But this is a 5600X, RTX 3060, 16gb 3600mhz Ram... I have a gigabit internet connection, and the game is being run of a ssd...
I can¬¥t find ANY solution online, or here on steam...
3.) The Holo-Guide is located on ""Z"" which i have never used, but accidently hit, while playing...
There litteraly is NO possibility of turning it off! 
-BUT it gets worse! -It can open doors, all by it self! -Which it ofcourse did! -Which made every enemy close to the doors on the other side react, and ofcourse follow it, to attack ME... It kept doing that for 15 minutes or so, while i had to fend enemies of, because there was a couple of ""Auto Fabricators"" which ofcourse kept producing more and more...
In the end, i had to remap the Holo-Guide, to the farthest key on my keyboard, so i wouldent accidently hit it again!
Also the button layout for weapon change, are 2-3 keys per weapon... and you just have to keep on pressing, hoping to get the one you need...

** DLC **

The DLC is actually WORSE!
I know, i know, it¬¥s made by other players... and they are not experts... and what not... But hey, i¬¥m still paying for it.. it¬¥s still money, for something that¬¥s less than okay... i mean the maps for instance, are almost useless! -Doors are showen as ""normal doors"" but are either security doors, or ""event activated doors"" ... meining you have to look thru all the other rooms, to try and figure it out! -For instance: i was flying from room to room, looking for secret doors, panels ...whatever that would open a door... turned out to be a pack of Vortex missiles i had to pick up... which didn¬¥t auto-trigger when i flew thru it, because my Vortex ammo was filled up!?!!??
...And the logs you pick up, are ALL text! ...you cant pause to read them, and enemies are chasing you, sooo you wont see any of them!
The levels are mishmash of all the different stages from the base game, and all taken out of context... even the enemies are randomized... so enemies from alien worlds are mixed with lava robots, and levels are mixed lava, ice, alien worlds, coal mines, and industrial complexes, all mixed int o one... 
This is BAD! DLC is not worth it! Even if it was free... it got so monotinous, that i just hurried thru them to get it over with!

Pros:

Plays like Descent. Same freedom of movement, enemy types, weapons- all great graphics. And since this is a VR compatible experience, Its even more incredible with my headset on. 

Cons:

The enemies could be a little more interesting-looking. I mean, compared to Descent, they didn't seem to have as much character. However, I may need to play a bit more. The protagonist's ship is somewhat bland as well.

If you like Descent, or 6DOF games like Forsaken, it's just about everything I could ask for.  It very much feels like a DOS era game with better graphics and modern controller support.  There's nothing really new or innovative, and I'm fine with that.  You fly a ship, blow sh*t up, and go the wrong way a lot because you're disoriented and confused, and tell yourself that you don't need that stupid navigation bot.

Playing with a controller is a decent Descent, like with the originals you'll have to rewire your brain a bit.  Joystick options too, but I haven't tried them yet.  The story is you don't care, just blow up stuff.  Graphics are minimalist, but it works well here, making everything look suitably science fiction-y without being too busy so as to confuse your eyeballs.  Robots blow up good, too.  Attention to detail, like being able to blow up the monitors on the wall brought a smile to my crusty old face.",1627800601,1627800601,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Many video games were a no-no, but Descent was a-Okay for them. His dad showed it to me and let me play it. My own father eventually got it and we both spent many hours on it. Then the series disappeared. I had completely forgotten about it. 

Fast-forward to 2021. I'm going through a plane flying game phase and stumbled across the ""Take Control"" bundle on Humble. This was included. The idea peaked my interest, but it wasn't the first game of the bundle that I played... and that's too bad, cause this kicks ass. 

Non-stop action, bots flying out of every corner and crevice, sneaking up on your ass (I'm playing on Hotshot). Hit 'em with a double-whammy of continuous lasers and rockets while moving in anyway you want to avoid their shots. 

I lack a joystick, so I'm playing on mouse and keyboard. It plays like an intense modern-day Doom-esque shooter when you're on a straight plane, but you also have entirely different directions you can go. Up, down, spin. For those unfamiliar with Descent, think of a hovering spacecraft crawling through a confusing FPS map. It takes a bit to master the controls for this, but once you do, it's incredible. 

Speaking of confusing FPS maps - A huge pro for this kind of game is the navigation bot. I had not paid close attention to the opening hints and found myself lost on the first level, until I was reminded that I just need to hit 'Z' and a bot will guide my way. I vaguely remember getting myself lost in the old Descent games and found myself so lost in the first level, so it's great that they included this. 

Some downsides - I'm not incredibly far yet, but the mod options seem rather bare minimum. Ammunition for the various weapons has to be picked up while you're on a mission and nothing carries over to the next level, aside from a few upgrade points. The upgrade points allow you to make power upgrades before starting a mission. The missions themselves are more arcade like and do not feel like a proper campaign/story. I understand why they may have took a classic approach on these things, but including some modern mechanics, especially around modding and ship customization, would have been a huge improvement for this game.   

It also does not play well with a controller (tested on Xbox One controller). The buttons have to be manually assigned and the calibration refuses to work. I can get it functional with my controller, but it's just not right. There may be workarounds for controller use, but this seems to be a bit of a weakness for a game released in 2018. 

However, overall, this game is what I needed. And despite it's pedigree, it feels like an entirely new and unique experience. It's easy to jump into, looks amazing, and runs extremely smooth - never dropping below 60 fps in 4k on my upper-mid-end PC.  The action is intense and relentless. It's incredibly challenging, but rewarding. Would recommend.

Edit: I went back and played with the controller settings some more. It is definitely playable with the controller. My preference remains mouse and keyboard, however. BUY THIS GAME.",1627259307,1627438949,True,3,0,0.519481420516967773,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I wish reviews would allow a 1 to 5 Star Rating. I'd give this a solid 2 - 3 Stars. This is great for fans of the genre but if you're just like shooters in general and look for something generally well made and entertaining, this is most probably not it. And not worth more than $15.

It was great fun when I was still motivated to play because I wanted to see and experience all the levels and the upgraded weapons. But it felt really boring and slow and long... more like work... so I stopped playing for half a year.

Now after the pause I tried picking it up again and the flaws became really obvious and I stopped playing after a couple of minutes because of a bore-out:

My main point of critique:

- The levels are extremely generic and lack any form of sense, reason and structure. 

I guess this could be seen as ""staying true to it's descent roots""... but it just feels boring and uninspired after a while. 

There's generic space corridors, generic engine rooms, ice caves and lava caves. That's it. 

Nothing stands out as very tight, very spaceous, good looking, well structured, impressive - just architecture that has an obvious purpose - a level that has a certain logical structure. 
It all feels like endless generic space-corridor boringness. Any oldschool computer could have generated these levels without the help of any human brain.

And this also leads to the next point:

- The fights are always the same - because the environments are always the same.
Enemies appear. You shoot them... most of the time you do no have much space for moving around or really using the level to your advantage because the enemies always follow in the same way - or by flying around you ""wake"" up more enemies.


So I wish there would be some sort of logical story... and then some sort of progression that you can see in the world... maybe starting in generic corridors but then also entering different planets. Frozen, Lava, Jungle, Desert, Metal, Water... Structures that are huge, strctures that are tight, outdoor parts, new scifi levels, old rusty dirty scifi levels, then destroyed or wrecked space ships (inside and outside), dangrous environments, friendly environments, old green-houses with plants taking over, sunken cities, old ruins, just anything but only corridors... 

Then every environment would create it's own playstyle and different strategies. 
But I guess time and resources were not there... which would be fair for a $10 game. But $25 is just too much.

[h1]Overall Rating - Seriously Flawed ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1]
Not since Star Fox 64 back in 1997 have I played many SHMUPs where you don't just look at a small ship from overhead, as piloting a ship in a 3-dimensional manner doesn't seem to arise very often. The only exceptions I'm generally aware of come from jet fighter sims. Regardless, looking at Overload (OL), I was excited for the opportunity to play such a game again. With such positive reviews, I was all too happy to take a key from someone who didn't need it.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As already mentioned, this is a first-person perspective SHMUP style game, and true to form you face off against an enemy count that greatly outnumbers you. Your progress carries over from stage to stage, including ammo and energy reserves. At least, I think so, due to the otherwise arbitrary amounts of items you start a stage with, since you don't start off maxed out. Additionally, you're able to upgrade various stats of your ship, such as the power of your weapon systems, speed of the ship, durability, etc. Doing so requires you to find upgrades scattered about each stage, in contrast to gaining XP by killing bad guys. There are also secrets, some of which require careful navigation to find.

Each stage includes progressing objectives. These essentially involve finding keycards to access secured areas, before blowing something of importance to pieces, such as a reactor or boss. Completing the last objective triggers a short count-down before the entire station you're at self-destructs. If you don't escape in time and haven't manually saved during the stage, you would have to start at the very beginning again. You're also able to rescue hibernating people before the base explodes, but more often than not, I can't find where they are and let them die.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487989336
[h1]Controls[/h1]
Flying a spaceship is surprisingly complicated, but that's because of how much control you have over it. Since you're freely navigating stages in a three dimensional space, you need ways to adjust your trajectory, height, and direction. The controls are fairly intuitive as you get used to them, and give all the tools necessary to fly where you want to go. It takes time to get used to, and it can feel floaty, but the controls work pretty well overall. You also have tools that can be toggled, such as a guide and which weapons system you want to use.


[h1]Story[/h1]
I can't say the story is that interesting, primarily because of how it's delivered. Although it does include voice-overs, you listen to the voice acting while staring at neon green text on a black screen. There aren't cutscenes or images of the people involved to give the events some context, as the only time you'll see the visage of a person is when rescuing people in stasis. Even then it's nothing more than a photo ID. A story is nothing without characters, and the events taking place come across like some paranoid businessman getting ticked off because others won't support his research.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488112691
[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The locations you fly your ship through exclusively consist of research facilities set in outer space, and excavated tunnels, which doesn't make for the most exciting or diverse environments. For all intents and purposes, it could all be taking place on Earth. In spite of the sterile location, the visuals still look smooth and crisp. Kind of like the environment, enemy ships and the projectiles fired aren't that distinct, but that wasn't what drew my attention to OL in the first place. With my original concerns about the visuals, I'm glad that my orientation in the environment didn't feel obtuse or hard to discern. 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1]
I wouldn't say the music strikes me as spacey, even though the synthetic sounds may have tried to impart that effect, as this is taken over by the consistent style of grungy rock. Some songs slow the tempo down so it's not as aggressive, but I could see all of these songs fitting together on the same CD. It fits the game well enough, though I don't find it to be memorable music either. I didn't mind the voice acting, as infrequent as it might be. Similarly, the sound effects of missiles blowing enemies up, and the other weaponry, sounded as I'd expect from a game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488112031
[h1]Pros[/h1]
üåü I didn't notice a lot of difference in the primary weapons, but I could see the distinction more clearly in the secondary ones. This variety helps address different enemy types and situations.
üåü If you like exploring, there's plenty of secrets hidden in each stage. I doubt you'd find most of them without a guide though.


[h1]Cons[/h1]
‚ùå The environments aren't broad or open in any sense. You're always flying through tight, compact locations. It somewhat defeats the point of flying a spaceship, because you have no freedom or room to take advantage of your range of flight. 
‚ùå For whatever reason, I found myself playing the game a mission at a time, not really feeling like playing more of it right away.
‚ùå Enemies get bullet-spongey quick, so you'll almost have to spend upgrade points on your weapons.


[h1]Tips[/h1]
üîç With the ammo and other pick-ups available in each stage, you'll want to use your secondary weaponry evenly so that you don't have a slot that still has full ammo and no need for that refill, but are completely empty on something else. Since your weaponry isn't unlimited though, make your shots count.
üîç Enemies can be tucked away in dead-ends and around blind corners, so you can't be too careful while going into unexplored areas. With how enemies suddenly show up, some won't spawn until you trigger a spawn point.
üîç Explore the level by yourself for a while before turning on the guide. When I play levels without guidance the whole time, I tend to find more upgrades.


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
What I enjoyed most while playing OL was the sense of movement as I flew around, and even though some angles might disorient me, it always felt pretty smooth. However, the game itself didn't give me as much satisfaction as I hoped for. The stage design worked against what these controls could have allowed for, putting you into a concise box with almost as little visual interest. With an emphasis on needing to explore for upgrades and secrets, it reminded me of Nintendo 64 games. I remember games from that era hiding power-ups in out of the way locations, and your time in any given stage increased significantly in spite of not accomplishing anything. 

I think the reason why the game gets such good reviews is because it initially feels good. However, the achievements for getting very far into the game aren't earned by many people, with only 15% of people beating the first 3 stages (not including the tutorial). I might recommend OL if I thought more people would even beat it, and since that seems unlikely, I'd suggest skipping it.

What a great modern version of a game I played as a kid! Playing in VR is definitely the way to play it, environments are superb and combat feels real and almost scary at times with scorpions jumping out at you from hiding places to grind you in the face! 
Upgrade point system is good, it's got a use but I did like the way weapons were upgraded in the original Descent better, finding active upgrades rather than ticking boxes feels more organic personally. 
Only real annoyance is the lack of controller input in menus. Having to lift my VR to find enter or navigate the upgrade menu is junk, it's not a huge let down considering my xbox controller works 100% in game but it would be smart to have it work in a future update.
Honestly can't recommend it enough if you played the Descent games!

TL;DR
Whats good
- Graphics
- combat
- movement
- environments
- puzzles
- enemies
- weapon choice

Whats in the middle
- Sounds

- story

The upgrade system works well and you really notice the difference when you upgrade shields/weapons/speed etc. Story is engaging; in fact, this is the 1st game EVER I went from the beginning to the end, simply because I wanted to know how the story ends (and was not disappointed). I also don't suck nearly as bad as I did 20 years ago, probably due to better hardware (PC with Ryzen 5, GTX 1660Super, and 16Gb RAM, and I get good FPS on maxed out settings).

The movement is good.

The weapons are crap. Everything is a barrage of missiles, or plasma bolts, or shotgun pellets. Every fight is a horrible clusterf..k of rockets and chunks of glowing death flying everywhere. I mean, if you enjoy that, feel free to buy the game, but personally i prefer to be able to count the bullets on the screen and address each of them meaningfully. There is a weapon, Thunderbolt, which actually takes skill to use and does not fill the battlefield with 1000 pellets, but good luck getting everybody to stick to it.

But the biggest issue is the glow. You get hit, the screen glows. It flashes white, it flashes orange. I should sue the devs for harming my eyes for whatever 30-ish minutes of multiplayer fighting i experienced. No, there's no way to turn it down. No, it has not been addressed since the game came out. Conveniently i've been told the next update will address it, and that should come out in a couple of weeks... but for some reason i don't really trust that.

I wish i could refund it, but Steam's refund policy is ass. The 5 hours i played were me trying to figure out how to play the game by fighting bots, while waiting for the multiplayer match. Only when i finally joined the latter, did i realize: no, this game is not for me. $15 wasted for 5 hours of boring shooting of dumb bots.",1618522317,1618522317,False,1,0,0.465226203203201294,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Great enemy design, great level design, good weapon variety and the same angry noises coming out of your mouth after a robot sniped you from around a corner on Insane difficulty. 
The only gripe I have with it is the upgrade system, which does feel very forced. Some tier-2 upgrades are pretty nonsensical and only exist to justify having an upgrade system. If you choose the upgrades that *do* make sense, though, there's a neat sense of progression giving you the firepower you need to survive the brutal, brutal endgame levels. Of course you can also play through the game without upgrading anything - there even is an achievement for that - but you'll have a pretty hard time near the end. The actual feature they wanted here was weapon configurability, which can be done through other means; no upgrade system required.

Looking past this, though, the actual gameplay of Overload is exactly what it should be; it's classic Descent action alternating between slow sniper-type battles and frantic enemy ambushes - sometimes in Lockdown-events where you can't escape from the combat area - that force you to make good use of your arsenal or perish. Like the Descents, Overload expects you to play these levels multiple times, gradually learning where each enemy is, where the secret doors that give you upgrade points and ammunition are, and all the while increasing the difficulty level. There's also a NG+ mode with an even more vicious ""Insane+"" difficulty available - even with the full endgame weapon arsenals and a ton of upgrades, Level 2 on Insane+ already murders your life if you're not careful. The replay value of Overload stems almost entirely from your own skill improving, which is exactly how it should be in a good action game.

Also worth mentioning, the soundtrack is really good; it's made by several composers who did work on the original Descent series and it really gets into your head after a while - the soundtrack from the endgame alien levels in particular is a great experience when you first get there. And I think I even recognized some motifs from Descent 1 somewhere around the Titan Collider level. Honestly, great stuff.

This is the first time I have played a 6D shooter so I hope this review helps newcomers like me.
Presentation-
The game looks great. The environments are greatly textured and the lighting is very well done to create a pretty sweet atmosphere. The music is a banger as well appropriately adding to the the ambience. There is a story told through large paragraphs before missions. There are also audio logs scattered throughout missions which are decently voiced. I personally didn't care for the story mostly because the paragraphs at the start crawled so slowly onto the screen that I got bored and skipped it.
Gameplay-
Now this is the best part about the game. The controls in this game are very tight and responsive which is great. Levels are mostly open areas where you fly around shooting enemy Operators. The operators themselves are very smart. There is a wide variety of enemies each with different weapons and they move around alot and flank you with their numbers. Hopefully you have some pretty sick weapons too divided into primaries and secondaries. Primaries include a stuff like a Machine gun,Flak Canon and Lasers whereas Secondary includes Missiles,Bombs and other various explosives. Level design in this game is really complex and its easy to get lost ,luckily there is a holo guide and an easily readible map to guide you in case you're stuck.
Overview-
I had alot of fun with Overload considering it is my first 6D shooter. Level design can get confusing at times and there are a few difficulty spikes like stuffing you in a small corridor with tons of operators but all these are not major deal breakers. The core gameplay loop is solid and never gets old as the game keeps rewarding you with new toys to play with.

The controls are intuitive and smooth. The music is absolutely stellar and I still listen to it from time to time in the background.
Sadly the performance was always an issue for me, Unity engine doesn't quite like old potato laptops, and some of the single player campaign levels are large elaborate mazes. 
Most of my meager playtime came from jumping into skirmish because those levels were mostly small, and I just was drawn to that moment-to-moment combat.
Remember that exclusive fullscreen is hidden behind a launch command with Unity engine games:
""-window-mode exclusive""

So much fun to have a modern rendition of them!

The gameplay is better than the originals, and the graphics are great!  It has such an ""old but new"" feel.  If you like the old ones, you will love this one.  I really wish there were more games like this and not all just first person shooter that play on one plane of movement.  In my view, Descent is harder, and much more fun to me once mastered than most first person shooters.       

Note:  I didn't previously have a joystick for this, so I took a gamble and purchased the Logitech Extreme 3d Pro Joystick for this and it is perfect!

Descent is one of those games that players in their thirties remember with a nostalgic tear in their eyes. While the younger ones probably have no idea what Descent is. Now all generations of players can experience what flying in narrow tunnels is like. Or in closed rooms, where swarms of robotic enemies are pouring in on you from all sides.

Overload is basically the same as the original DESCENT. Anyone who has ever played Descent will immediately know that these two games have the same genetic basis.

Your opponents fall into four categories. The most numerous group are those who are trying to pierce you with beam weapons. Then there are those who shoot you with rockets from a distance, at best with unguided ones. The third group is represented by robotic drones who want to share it with you up close. And the last category is kamikaze robots that rush to you and detonate. Enemies often understandably attack in mixed groups.

You can gradually hang up to sixteen different weapons on your battleship. There are either cannons (energy or projectile) or a wide range of missiles:

In addition to the story campaign, Overload also offers multiplayer competitions and an endless mode where you can test your reflexes and accuracy. That is, provided that all those turns, turns and quick movements do not make you sick.

     Graphically, the game looks decent, the sound and music are ok. Overload is well optimized and does not require disk space. I would recommend it especially to those who still remember Descent and want to relive the challenge of a tunnel shooter.

     And I secretly hope to see a remake of Descent: Freespace, which in its time offered experiences comparable to the Star Wars space battles. Even without claustrophobic levels, with giant enemy cruisers.

I probably should've played them a long time ago, though, because their spiritual successor Overload is pretty damn awesome.

Developed by many former Descent devs and poaching most of the main gameplay mechanics, Overload is a generally fantastic game. Working as a kind of 360 degree Doom, you traverse claustrophobic bases in a very agile ship, strafing and flipping in any direction as needed to navigate. It's a huge shift from what I've come to expect in the more traditional space sim, which was a pleasant surprise! Overload combines all the freedom of movement I love in space dogfights with the twitchy paranoia of corridors filled with things that want to kill you. 

It all culminates in a thrilling rush to the exit after blowing a generator, twisting, boosting and manoeuvring quick as you can through the squadrons spawned to get in the way. It's a gimmick lifted completely from Descent, but I can see why because it's easily the best part of any level, desperately trying to stay oriented and keep your bearings while your screen visually assaults you will explosions. 

Even the story is a lot better than the average 90s shooter. When I first picked up Overload I played usually one or two levels a day before moving on to whatever bigger game I was working on. But by the midpoint or so, I was getting pretty interested in what would come next, both in terms of plot and level design. By the end, I beat the last five levels in one sitting‚Äîthoroughly hooked, if you couldn't tell.

Being unfamiliar with Overload's main inspiration I'm sure I missed a bunch of other shout-outs and design refinements, but the point is that Overload is super fun even without the nostalgia‚Äîthe best of both worlds that every Kickstarter retro revival should try to hit. It's a criminally underrated game‚Äîlikely done in by the cult space sim audience and impossible to Google name‚Äîand well worth picking up as a sleek, modern entry point to the spaceflight genre.

With that gone, you can speed through levels, blasting baddies in full 3d with 6 axis of movement and dance through beautiful chaotic fight scenes to get your adrenaline pumping!

Then stop.  And rub up against every single wall panel to find that one hidden door with the upgrade point so you can still handle the baddies further along in the game.  Slowly.  Because at full speed, you might go right past the door.  True, there are sometimes visual cues that there's a hidden door.  But sometimes there's not.  And sometimes the visual cue is a lie.  And sometimes it's a locked door that's part of an area later on.  It would be one thing if the secret doors just had a bit of extra energy, armor, ammo, whatever.  But it has these godforsaken upgrade points.   Or worse, sometimes the hidden doors are actually the next location on the map.

And you need dozens and dozens of these points to upgrade your ship.  Tons of upgrades, only a few every level.  Balls.  A fantastic fun game ruined by ""searching for secret doors"".

To put it simply, this is basically a clone of the originals... and developed by people who actually worked on them.

It's a simple premise, fly into underground bases and complete your missions... Stop the infected autobots... blow reactors and shut down/destroy the outposts.

It's simple shoot up fun and mayhem... the learning curve is good, the levels get harder and the DLC offers plenty of extras... and there's at least 50 or more muiltiplayer maps and challenges. Skiill levels range from Trainee to INSANE... Leaderboards are there to see how you rank against others, but only from Rookie level upwards.... Put it this way... On Rookie, I'm doing ok and in the top 10-20% on most of the challange levels I've played so far.... next level up... My ranking drops drastically.

I'm old you see... in my 40's now and my reflexes aren't what they used to be.

But this game is fun, and I'm put around 50hrs into it so far and have completed the game and the DLC and am halfway through challenges on the first 3 levels. So there's plenty to keep you going and it's well worth the ¬£10 I paid for it.

So grab your popcorn, sit back and remember the good old days when you were actually a gaming god. instead of the podgy middle aged dude you are now. :)",1595620034,1595620034,True,1,0,0.496183216571807861,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you haven't seen or played them, I would suggest checking them out, Descent was the first 360 ship shooter in existence, and there are still those who keep the games working, even after over twenty five years.

Moving on, you start out with a pair of laser cannons and dumbfire rockets.  As you advance, you'll find more advanced weapons that can be used differently, or just do the same thing the previous one did with a slightly different twist.  Those who have played Descent will recognize the weapons, as many of them are almost identical in function to the ones from Descent, with a few that are similar to ones from the third installment (remember the seeker mines?  Powerful but only if they catch the bot.)

The objective in most mission is seek and destroy; Find the core and destroy it.  This will cause the entire facility to be destroyed, so make sure you know where the emergency exit hatch is.

Throughout the missions you can find hostages, a must for advancing quickly, kept in cryotubes.  Just make sure you retrieve them before you blow the core.  Among the levels there are also communications from current and former employees, collect them for a little more lore on the story.


Also as you advance, you encounter more and more powerful enemy robots, each with a different brand of death waiting to serve you.  At the end of every sector, you'll encounter a boss, who will be equipped with unique weaponry that will hurt a lot if it hits you.  Take the boss bot down to advance to the next sector.

Overload uses a lot of what Descent had back in the day, improving on the parts from the originals that...just weren't quite there yet, especially from the third installment (Although lets be honest, there were a lot of things from number 3 that needed improvement.)

It feels exactly like a new and modernized addition to the Descent series and I couldn't be happier with it - especially since the official Descent Underground title is beleaguered by legal troubles and may never even see the light of day.  I commend the Revival Productions team, who raised half as much money as Descendent Studios to develop their new game, and delivered this rock solid title just over two years later.  By comparison, two years after Descendent Studios' Kickstarter we instead saw Descent Underground removed from Steam Early Access, and nearly three years after that we are still left waiting for any meaningful progress.

+ Modern features
VR support, Tobii eye tracking support, and surround sound audio really take the immersion to the next level - provided you can afford all those accessories and peripherals.

+ Great controls
I love games that let me take full advantage of my Steam controller, and gyro controls really shine with this title.  6DOF games do come with a somewhat steep learning curve, it can take some time to get the hang of navigating and aiming accurately, but using a Steam controller made this less difficult.  You can easily map any other gamepad or joystick you have instead if you prefer.  It is definitely more challenging to play with just a keyboard and mouse however.

+ That Descent feel
The story, the level design and lighting, the models of the enemy robots, the weapons, the sound effects, the music - all of it will bring back that Descent nostalgia by being just similar enough to the original series.  As a fan who played countless hours of the original trilogy of Descent games, I loved every moment of this game.

Other thoughts...

* This game is hard.
I've seen a number of reviews complaining about the difficulty of this game, from the hoards of robots you face during later levels to how hard it can be to locate all of the secrets within the maps.  These are not negatives but positives in my opinion.  I'm honestly tired of how most modern games hold your hand too much and don't present you with a real challenge.  There will be none of that here with Overload.

* Multiplayer, but not enough players
There's maybe at best 30 players online at one time, so while the game supports multiplayer, unless you bring your own friends to play with you there sadly isn't in reality much multiplayer action to be had.  Unfortunately 6DOF games don't have a very big player base to begin with.

* Built on Unity?!
Usually I can tell right away that I am playing a game built on Unity by the obvious lack of quality.  It is very easy for a developer to build a mediocre game on Unity, it is much harder to build a good game on Unity that doesn't immediately look and feel like a Unity game.  Further testament to the skills of the Revival Productions dev team for managing to make such a quality title on this second rate game engine.",1594880560,1594880560,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

When you kill a ship it starts to drift off until it hits something and explodes. And I just love those effects. 

There's multiple primary and secondary weapons to collect and use. There's secrets found within maps that you find by back tracking and exploring the areas. I usually don't like back tracking in games, but I don't find it as tedious in this game. I don't usually get every secret, but it's still worth it to upgrade my ship. In other reviews I heard it being said that the different stages feel too similar. But I don't agree so far. They use some of the same map elements in different maps, but it doesn't feel too same-y to me.

There is a story, but I have trouble following. I get pieces but I only partly understand.

The 'cutscenes' that are in the campaign (including the one you see every time you escape at the end of a level) don't appear to have sound, so they all feel a little unfinished, especially if -- for whatever reason -- you decide to play without the music on. Since the game also ends with a cutscene, the lack of sound (as well as the lack of bombast with which the cutscene plays out) felt a bit anti-climactic, but this is maybe the only area in the campaign where the polish wasn't up to the high standard set by everything else.

On the music, all the tracks are great, but I none of them instantly stuck in my head like some of the tracks from the original Descent did, though they all did a great job at laying an atmospheric bed for each of the levels.

In my opinion, there are a few too many guns available, and the intended role of many weapons is either unclear, or undermined by other weapons. As such, I rarely felt the need to switch away from the Crusher (essentially a rapid-fire shotgun). If I could make any changes in this respect, I would have made the weapon roster both more streamlined and more specialised in their purpose.

A major downside for anyone interested in multiplayer is that the servers are virtually dead, and setting up a multiplayer game isn't very straightforward, with the server browser only being available though a third-party executable. Further, one of the biggest draws from Descent (as with many other shooters from the era) was the ability to play the campaign cooperatively; a feature that Overload is sorely lacking.

It has its shortcomings, but it's otherwise very solid and -- on sale -- is worth the asking price for the campaign alone.

+ Controls have been modernised, it's easy to drop in and play I didn't rebind any keys, didn't even feel the need to change mouse sensitivity. Your ship has weight to it and is very easy to control.
+ Lockdown sections (especially the optional ones) explore how different enemies act and work together and put you in an isolated arena suited to those enemies strengths. These sections really stood out in the overall level design.
+ Hidden goodies are easier to find, thanks to better graphical fidelity you can see the seams where wall panels might slide away to reveal a hidden room or cubby.
+ Enemy AI employs a range of tactics. Some enemies are just dumb and sit in place shooting at you. Some will fire off a salvo and run away behind a corner to surprise you later, others will aim to ram into you and if they miss will continue to attack you from behind, others will actively set up flanks and others still will attack head on in a pack and dart away to pull your attention in 3 different directions.
+ Thanks to enemy AI being at the level it is, it's very satisfying to trash them. It actually does sometimes feel like you're outsmarting them.
+ On that note, horde mode! Trash as many bots as you can without dying and make it on to the leaderboards.
+ Weapons are all made to fill a niche and can be upgraded and specialised.
+ No hit-scan weapons, weighty turn speed. You can avoid most shots and you can exploit some enemies slow turning speed to get yourself into their blindspots if you're quick enough.
+ Multiple difficulty settings to offer a nice consistent challenge.

+/- Maze like map design

- Grey rock tunnels look the same in both directions. Overload takes a realistic approach to decorating levels as opposed to Descent with its purple cave walls and running water (on an asteroid) on the floor (in zero-G). Everything looks a lot better but reorienting yourself without those hints is more of a challenge. It's a tradeoff, luckily the minimap is very good.
- There are two pairs of ""model twins"" among enemies, Goblins and Ogres share the same profile as do Gorgons and Krakens. It's not a mistake you'll make after a couple of hours in game but it's an exceedingly painful mistake for those couple of hours because in both cases one twin is mostly harmless and the other will happily burst you down at medium range. I can't help but compare to Descent once again, not only did each enemy design have its own unique garish paint job but they were also all radically different shapes so none of their targeting profiles blurred together. This is again a tradeoff with graphical fidelity, thanks to all the pretty lighting and reflections it's hard to tell what kind of paintjob a particular bot has at a glance.",1593692734,1593692734,True,5,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I thought the gameplay was very good, the different weapons all felt unique and there were situations for most of them. The biggest problem is that upgrade progression is tied to finding secrets in the world (to find upgrade points). These points are rather hard to find, and are simply just finding ""the out of place tile"" or looking on the map which is really annoying (as opposed to figuring it out through context which I really like). Because these points are progression you basically have to find them or the game will be really difficult. Finding these secrets is also tied to destroying control panels, but it's not at all clear which panel is linked to which doors, which is a huge problem. Towards the end the enemies didn't keep up with upgrades so they became a little bullet-spongey which was disappointing.

I thought the level design was really good, for the first 80% or so of the game I could never really be sure I was ""safe"" - things kept jumping on me all the time, which I really liked. I figured out most of the patterns by the end and it wore off though. 

I thought the story was going to just be an excuse for asteroid levels but it turned out to be deeper than that and had some gameplay consequences which was pretty neat. A lot of the findable logs told the story but it was missable so they basically caught you up in-between levels which was pretty cheap. Every log seemed to be directly related to the story, there's no ""world building"" logs. 

If you're interested in 6dof shooters this is almost the best ""pure shooter"" I've played - everspace has much better world building, a more interesting story, and better progression, but for pure gameplay overload is better. I still prefer everspace myself though by far because I like the former qualities better. I personally think UT99 is still better than Overload (better weapons, levels, aesthetic) but that's a high bar.

One caveat - steam cloud sync does not work, so make sure to back up your saves if you want to keep them.

I backed this game on Kickstarter because many of the people who created this game gave me my start in the game industry.  I‚Äôve worked closely with some of the people on the team. I didn‚Äôt even give this game a score when I looked at it previously because I am biased. 

After the first hour:

Overload is a return to the era of Descent.  I think Descent was the first 6 Degrees of Freedom game where the player flies around a mine to blow up the reactor and escape.  Overload is essentially the same game though made a couple of decades later.

Much of Overload is exploring large environments and trying to find keycards, stranded civilians, and the reactor, all while dealing with modified mining drones that will attack you on sight.  This isn‚Äôt the stand and shoot type of game, but more focused on constantly moving and dodging attacks while shooting the enemies as well.  It‚Äôs very different from anything that is currently out there in the video game market.

A big piece here is that 6 degrees of freedom.  What that means is the game allows you to move and rotate your ship in any direction, similar to how planes would operate, but without the force of gravity it creates a very strange experience with trying to move through the large bases you‚Äôre on. 

I would recommend this to anyone who remembers Descent or anyone who wants a very different style of gameplay.  Overload is made to replicate the original game so if you‚Äôre not interested in a game like Descent, this might not be for you. There is also a slight chance of motion sickness because you can move in all six directions but I didn‚Äôt experience that myself. 

There is also a VR mode for the game so if you like VR, you could check that out but I would also caution on that because I find that VR mode hard to play and it‚Äôs a bit sick inducing.

Such freedom of movement, in regard to not only sliding in various directions, but turning and traveling in various directions as well. It was wild at the time, and as a bit sci-fi fan, I was sold. The music was neat at the time, the gameplay was cool, and there weren't really any other games I played that compared with it. Secrets were fun little temptations to get the next cool weapon one mission before the game practically bounced it off your windshield later on, and it worked. This was essentially the same tactic games like Doom and Doom 2 used in the '90s as well. Great stuff.

Overload is mostly a love letter to Descent in that it feels almost exactly like playing a Descent game with far better graphics, high-quality sound, and even better music than before! The gameplay is slicker/smoother, the new ""guide-bot"" (or whatever this game calls it) is nice for helping you find enemies, exits, reactors, etc. like in the original, if not better than before, and just...so much is here to love!

However, the way this game handles secrets deviates from the way the original handled them - and by proxy - the way Doom and Doom 2 handled them. Instead, it uses an approach more akin to how Doom 2016 handles secrets. So instead of  just being delayed on obtaining something, you permanently lose it and are gimped the rest of the game. How so? Well, Overload has upgrade spheres hidden around the levels. A few are plain as day, and others are so hidden that I scoured the first mission and only found half of them. There are a limited number of these, and based on the number appearing in each mission, and the number of upgrade points one can spend, if you miss some of these, you will never get all of the upgrades. This is not in line with the premise of the original Descent games, and I find it to be to Overload's detriment.

While I love persistent upgrades, having missable upgrades in a game where you can literally fly in any direction through sprawling maps with hidden doors is counter-intuitive to the exciting pace the original games had. Flying around in Descent 1-3 was exciting and didn't have terrible slow-down. However, if you're having to search everything or get permanently gimped on upgrades, then the pacing is drawn to a screeching halt. Although I overall enjoyed Doom 2016, the '90s Doom games handled pacing far better with their secrets, whereas Doom 2016 had missable persistent upgrades. It was annoying in Doom 2016, but with the additional freedom of movement afforded by Overload, finding all of the persistent upgrades becomes an even more aggravating chore detracting from my enjoyment of the game.

As someone often against games over-relying on nostalgia, I find it surprising to be stating that I would have vastly preferred the original Descent games' approach to secrets and new goodies be used than the Doom 2016 model. I believe that the original way of handling secrets was wholly superior to how Overload handles them.

However, if you just don't care about being permanently gimped as you go through games, or you have fun pausing, looking up a walkthrough for a secret, unpausing, rinse, wash, repeat, until you've found all the upgrades in every mission lest you miss them, then this won't matter to you. =p",1591846870,1591846880,False,117,4,0.692446768283843994,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game looks dull all the time, the levels are the same and unmemorable, the story is boring and uninspired, it's so dark so you will be throwing flares everywhere, the weapons are underwhelming (except for 3 i guess), and the sound effects are similar (pew pew). BUT, the AI and core gameplay is remarkable, the music is above average, movement is on point.

Overall, i had very good moments with this game, but i just can't recommend it to anyone because there are so many bad moments i had with being stuck in a dark tunnel, throwing flares everywhere, and interpreting where i was in the automap. COMPASS PLEASE!

The one below the line goes to the specifics
=================================================
------------------( AESTHETICS )------------------
The aesthetics and colors are so dull i just can't enjoy it, I've never had this kind of problem until now.

If you played the first level then you've seen it all. All of the levels are just grey rock or grey metal with some neon lights slapped in the corners. I didn't have a sense of progressing because all of the levels look the same. 

         FOR EXAMPLE, what do you think a mining facility should have to mine? Drills, shovels, and something to haul the resources? Guess what, none of these appear in the levels were you're supposedly in a 'mining facility'.

The enemies aren't any better either. The silhouettes and colors are all similar in appearance which makes them hard to differentiate which enemy is which. None of the enemies are memorable visually; i can only think of one, but only because it makes a certain sound.

But the main problem is with the DARKNESS. There is only a few light sources that actually does something, and that makes everything more eye squinting. Going to tunnels that splits everywhere while not knowing where you are or what you're looking at is so nauseating.

Which brings me to

----------------------( LEVEL DESIGN )-------------------------
The level design is best described as a bunch of tubes interconnecting each other. I don't mind this kind of level design at all but if ALL of the levels are like this, then it will feel repetitive. And that's exactly what the level design of this game is, a jumble of tubes everywhere.

There are many unnecessary walls, and secrets are scattered randomly. So when you want to 100% it it will be a massive chore with you constantly looking at the automap and wandering around like a zombie

-------------------------( GAMEPLAY )----------------------------
This is a challenging game, you'll probably die a lot. I don't mind that, but there's a super fancy death sequence every time you die that get's very annoying. And there's no ""load latest-save"" option, so you have to manually load the last save. All of this amounts to a very time consuming death which you will see A LOT.

Weapons are boring and uninspired, 80% use the exact same projectile but with a different color on it. One is a basic pew pew weapon, the other one is a basic pew pew weapon but it bounces! That is how the weapons are like in this game, with only an exception of 3 weapons. The missiles are a different story though, they are actually great!

Codec dialogues are everywhere, and there's nothing you can do about it when you accidentally collect one and have to hear an essay about the evil mcbusiness doing evil stuff.

Flares? really? Yes, i know the Descent games were the same. But with a game as dark as this, and a futuristic world with space colonies, you would expect a flashlight in your ship. Instead you constantly press the f key to see where you're going.

The movement is actually great! It feels responsive and you can rebind the controls when it doesn't feel right.

The AI is one of the BEST i have ever seen! They flank you from behind, some snipe you and quickly hide away. They all have individual personalities and i love it! They know what they're doing if it comes to programming.

There's a ship upgrade system to help your ship to overcome stronger enemies, or more difficult levels, requiring you to discover upgrade tokens hidden through the levels in order to take advantage of.

It's easy to become disoriented while playing, due to the [i]six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF)[/i] nature of the game, just like the original [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/273570/]Descent[/url]. To offset this, you're provided with a 3D level-map to help you find your way if you're lost, which can also be used to help you find secrets.  In addition to this, you have flares and headlights built into your ship to help you navigate darker sections of a level, and a holographic guide-bot to lead you to where you want to go.

On the downside, the Internet multiplayer aspect of it could have been improved, because you need to find the IP address of a server to join using a web browser, and I felt an in-game server listing would have helped immensely.

Aside from that, I highly recommend this game if you're even slightly a fan of any games in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5605/]The Descent Classic Collection[/url], because [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/]Overload[/url] is clearly the spiritual successor of them all!

Just with an added upgrade system (which is actually pretty cool and strongly encourages level exploration), the guidebot from Descent 3 (yep I'm okay with this, 6DOF shooters are always a battle against disorientation more than anything else), and fancy modern graphics (it's an older version of Unity but it gets the job done).

If you enjoyed the original Descent games then you will enjoy this. In almost every way this game is Descent, just without the name. 

A few notes:

Mouse and keyboard support is good in this game! If you tried playing the original Descents with M+K you know how unwieldy it is. fortunately not the case with this game.

I haven't tried multiplayer, but with how it is set up, I imagine that it is something that you would want to try to set up with friends rather then randoms. (I'll add and edit if I ever get to try it out)

I just got the game on the humble bundle, which was a very nice surprise, since I've been wanting this game for quite a while now, but wasn't sure if I would like it.

I played Descent 2 alot as a kid with my original Microsoft Sidewinder Joystick back in the day. I always loved the fast paced action and the great soundtrack. I would have never thought that I would be playing the successor in VR some day, but they absolutely nailed it. The action is faster and more frantic than ever, the soundtrack still rocks (and is similar in style) and the controls with the xbox controller is super fast and precise (after getting used to it). This is just great fun in VR, I really love it. Only thing I noticed is that the performance sometimes drops with many enemies and explosions on screen. Granted, I have every setting on high (no super sampling though), but I'm also rocking a 3900X with a RTX 2080 Ti.

Finalement les graphiques. Ce sont pour moi le point fort de ce jeu.

Petit point n√©gatif: Je trouve ce jeu un peu redondant. Entre les niveaux qui ont des objectifs semblable au d√©but, cela me procure g√©n√©ralement une heure de plaisir √† la fois. Avec un mal de t√™te! J'ai toutefois toujours h√¢te d'y revenir apr√®s une petite pause!

Been falling in love with it ever since Valve added World-Scale settings to SteamVR‚Ä¶(60% FTW).

Has story/campaign mode, and a highly-replayable Challenge mode (good quality/quantity of arenas, spawns, etc‚Ä¶be sure to check it out);

///\\\
\\\///

Regarding World-Scale and VR:

1.
100% scale is unnaturally large on the Valve Index...(a cockpit sized for a giant; robot-monstrosities; etc)...I highly recommend reducing scale by at least 20% ( I prefer 60%).

(SteamVR -> Settings -> Video -> Per Application -> Overload).

2.
If you've already lost your ability to experience discomfort in VR, try disabling the cockpit...it improves both gameplay and performance.

3.
Nearly all in-game Graphical settings can be reduced to minimum without fundamentally altering image quality.

‚Ä¶just keep the following settings one step above the lowest tier:

""Shadows""

""Effects Lighting""

""Texture Resolution""

""Post-Processing""

*Anisotropic Filtering (negligible performance cost)

*Screen Space Reflections (negligible performance cost)

**Reduced Shaders**
Enemy cloaking causes a spontaneous performance drop in some Arenas...the reduced shader setting appears to prevent this by disabling the effect on some maps, but it also reduces the quality of dynamic lighting for sparks/explosions.

4.
Weak CPUs may choke in specific sections of a map due to the to the aggressive/sloppy automatic culling used in the game. Just keep that in mind and/or stay a certain distance away from certain fans, etc.

Overload satisfied my craving for both a reimagining of the Descent experience and a 6DOF game in VR, even with my skepticism about its capability to do so. I had a blast initially playing through Overload a number of times, and even revisiting its campaign a few years later. I feel like I'd be doing a disservice to anyone who might appreciate a wonderful 6DOF experience by not recommending this game, but by the same token I feel obliged to temper that recommendation with some of the major flaws of Overload.

My biggest issue with Overload is the level layout. I never quite felt [i]lost[/i] in any of the levels like I did in Descent. That's probably because most of the levels are obnoxiously linear. The Titan and [spoiler]first two alien[/spoiler] levels, in particular, are horrible offenders on this front, which is particularly unfortunate considering they constitute the bulk of the game. The two Phoebe levels are significantly less linear than the rest of the game, but still don't manage to be quite as exciting to traverse as any of the original Descent levels. In almost all the levels, the exit is located very close to the reactor, so you'll never have to fear getting lost in the mines as they're about to implode around you like you would in Descent, which definitely detracts from the excitement of actually overloading the reactors.

The soundtrack was also a bit of a letdown. I've been listening to the Descent I soundtrack almost as long as I've been playing the game, and its music has always been a personal reference point for what video game music [i]should[/i] be. Perhaps the flaw here comes from Overload attempting to emulate Descent II's music, but the soundtrack almost always seemed to be unnoticeable or trying too hard. There were a few exceptions, namely Titan Workshop, Titan Harbor and [spoiler]Cygnusoria[/spoiler]'s music, which all felt like they added to the immersion of their respective levels. On review, I found a further few tracks to be notably good, but still didn't feel they quite fit their levels.

I've also found the netcode for this game to perform poorly. In my experience with online play, I found that I was practically unable to connect shots with opponents without leading tremendously, far in excess of what one would expect from the velocity of the target. On top of that, there's no cooperative play for the campaign mode - a disappointing omission given that Descent included such a feature far ahead of its time.

Also, the Kodachi gunship and most of the operator designs look dorky. It's a minor complaint, but still disappointing to me, especially when I imagine the Kodachi next to the Pyro or most of the operators next to their Descent counterparts. Perhaps another minor complaint - the upgrade system is something I enjoyed, but at the same time frustrates me in that it effectively prevents any true ""cold starts"" of individual campaign levels.

Aside from those complaints, the game is solid. It has a terse but compelling story which is nicely accentuated by the log file powerups you'll find throughout and begins its climax with [spoiler]Cygnusoria, complete with its awesome musical intro and confrontation with Kantor[/spoiler]. It has beautiful environments that feel like an appropriate modernization of Descent's visuals. It has a nice variety of weapons, some better and some worse than their Descent counterparts (don't get your hopes up for the Plasma-equivalent), though not every Overload weapon has a Descent counterpart and vice-versa. It has a fantastic challenge mode which, albeit a sorry replacement for secret levels, stands strong in its own right. It has a weapon select menu that slows time when open, which is a subtle addition that makes combat feel drastically more fluid and satisfying. Oh, yeah, it also has GREAT 6DOF COMBAT, and that alone is enough for a fun game.

Overload met my expectations, but did not exceed them. Given that my expectations have been set by the high bar of the Descent series, however, I think it's impressive that Overload has simply met them.",1588030859,1588030859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is fun and challenging, the controls are responsive, it looks amazing; the levels are well-designed, and navigating the sprawling 3D levels is immersive.  Plus it maintains a nice sense of style.

However, there's a lot of little elements of the VR experience that make it seemed tacked on as an afterthought.  For example:
I wish more of the HUD was on the surfaces inside the ship, rather than hovering, or attached to the player's view; I think that'd help 'ground' the player more into the cockpit, which may help with the little bit of motion sickness I'm getting (which I never got from the old games).  Also the way the weapons magically appear & disappear kinda takes me outta the moment.
It'd also be nice if debris bounced off the windshield, rather than floating magically into where my legs should be.

Room for improvement 
- I couldn't find good key bindings for weapons. I wanted to just have some mouse button dedicated to my favorite primary weapon, and another to favorite secondary.
- I didn't find a way to see how many secret I've found during playing the level. So only way is to finish the level, and the reload to find missing secrets (if there are any).
- the enemies look all the same, they have same shape and colors, so it's very difficult to distinguish between them during the fight.

This is one of the best experiences in gaming due to the game-play being roughly the same as it was back when it was called Descent by the same developers. Yes, retro gaming, this is from the time when gaming meant the most to the culture I grew up in, when there wasn't a blockbuster movie that could  be connected to or tied into this  type of game, when the direction of the shooter genre as a whole, degraded into its own stupidity and realistic approach because it couldn't compare in function to this type of shooter, where movement, X,Y and Z, expressed  mathematically in true 3D was considered convoluted by the main stream. 

Level Design: I am impressed by these industrial complexes that are structured, with and without symmetry but appear congruent to the method of exploration at a dissident kind of angle, this is the tried and true formula exemplified of grabbing keys, hitting switches and secret hunting in a 3D polygonal area. Zero gravity and 6DoF exploration with one entrance and one exit, maps go vast and deep with twists and ambushes, and one can lose themselves ESPECIALLY in VR here, in the total unknown deep within the crust of some moon there is seldom time to relax.

 Some issues, nothing game-breaking, I became aware that:
It may seem as if the levels keep coming without a difference in color or texture they do seem to run together and might as well be combined together if the story didn't say otherwise also the areas do not penetrate as deep as the experience seems. On a plus note, the endgame has different atmosphere yet same architecture. If the premise was to escape an enormous citadel fortress of mechanical nature from deep within it's depths then we would really have scored due to the mania that the story could assume. Even Descent 3 had differing locations such as a prison and outdoor segments - not so in Overload, each mission has one goal, to Overload the main reactor or a boss fight which there are few, and escape. The levels get better as they get harder and that is the business and always has been.

The team never promised anything really story-wise, but what we got is some technical jargon with nice audio clips provided by survivors we scoop up. The soundtrack can't be beat and is really really really freaking amazing retro-techno that is complimented as the rambunctious orchestra of firepower erupt into grinding metals eclipsed by explosions of light intensity providing  blinding showers of sparks and trails. The artificial intelligence is ruthless, be warned

It is the last of it's kind, Overload is well worth it as an exercise of what it used to be and a retrofitted gem. It looks really crisp with the  explosions going off in the darkness. An arsenal of weaponry to boot, all very different  sounds and looks and even feels, overall very kinetic (and/or claustrophobic).

Overload is an Arcade 6-Axis-Shooter made by the original designers of Descent 1 and 2. Reducing its gameplay to the core, Overload pits you in deep dungeons filled by relentless robots, dangerous traps and countless secrets to be found. Framed by a small story, which reveals via short audio descriptions  scattered around the levels, the player has to fight his way through 15 huge and quite confusing stages. In classical manner you have to find keycards, power-ups, new weapons an ammunition in order to progress.

The smooth graphics bound with a psychedelic, impulsive soundtrack and the fluid controls deliver a fascinating flow. Every inch of this game oozes spirit of its predecessor, and I really enjoyed the action-loaded, unvorgiving, colourful trip, that felt like a time travel back to the golden age of gaming in my youth, where there wasn't any silly trophies, no social awkwardness and not a single uncalled-for stretching mechanic.

What I do want to clarify is, Overload is a game you can have a lot of fun with. But its also a game that will severely test your patience for bullshit.

First of getting the unimportant stuff out of the way. The story sucks, has a boring villian and is forced in your face way too much. No one cars about Evil Corporation ManMcgee.

The controls are awful for weapon switching often making it tedious to switch your various missile and weapon loadouts. Furthermore the menu UI is uniquely awful. Why is my last save on the bottom of the list and why is restarting the level prioritized? Why would most people want to restart the level first? 

The games hard, which makes the overlong death animations infuriating.  What doesnt help is the various monster closets and cheap ways the game will throw you into the enemy without being able to see them. Hitscan enemies also just blow chode. 

Enviroments are also extremly drab and boring to look at. Doesnt really FEEL like im in a space station or mining colony or whatever. Its all too similar.

Combat feels rewarding: crunchy explosions, pieces flies everywhere, no shortage in ammunition encourages to shoot more. Add a good music and you will be sucked in for a good couple of hours before making a break!

Yes, there are already a bunch of games trying to bring back gold old descent-style feeling, but this one is especially good. In my opinion Overload IS better than, let's say, Sublevel Zero and here is why: Overload got fixed hand-crafted levels and some meaningful plot (if someone cares). No questionable procedural s*it. Proper save-load mechanics over permadeath. Well-defined weapons - you don't have to read trough specs and carefully choose which one to keep. Combat is placed above looting.

VR mode:
Most of time played the game in a normal non-vr mode, but the review can't be complete without trying it in VR. I put on my Vive and tried it out. Right away, for some reason, the game hangs on attempt to load a saved game. Finally was able to play after 3rd try. There is absolutely nothing special in VR: yes, you can look around in a cockpit and move your head side to side, but that's it. The controls still mouse + keyboard (or some other non-vr controller if you prefer) and after a while you found yourself keeping head in a fixed spot looking and shooting forward very much like in a regular mode. Except the resolution is much lower, FOV is now limited and locked to match natural FOV of your eyes and visual FXes with A LOT of flickering looks annoying as hell. Especially when you using flare!
After about 5 minutes you completely realizes VR adds literally nothing to the game and even makes it worse in some aspects. It looks and plays better on a decent full-HD monitor and absolutely awesome on 4K.

The good stuff:
+ Fells like descent 1-2
+ Good visuals yet the game is not resource hungry
+ Full-blown single-player campaign with some plot. The plot is of course optional: you can just ignore it and proceed to blow up robots
+ There is MUSIC and voice-acting
+ No procedural-permadeath s*it.

There is also not so good things as well:
- The design of levels/missions feels kinda limited in variations and sometimes lacking details. Many levels feels the same. Level design is behind what we saw in descent-3 and barely stands for today's game industry standards. But still, levels are more interesting than in sublevel-zero.
- Something wrong about guns: a dozen of missions through the game and still didn't saw any vulcan or gauss? The ""driller"" feels like an oddball - like something B-graded: not fun to shoot. Very few upgrades to a basic ""laser"". Some guns are basically the same. The same about missiles: feels like game designers where out of ideas after implementing basic ""standard missile - homing missile - cluster-mega-badass-missile"". Other types of missiles are just variations of those basic types.
- Strange crosshair: no markings indicating the very center, sometimes makes it hard to aim properly. The targets usually not that far away but still - feels like the crosshair is missing the main part.

The level's are unlike anything you've ever experienced with other FPSs, and it can take a little while to adjust to the fact that there isn't really an up or down, and that the path you need to follow might be directly above you.

Overload is a modern version of Descent.  The graphics are fantastic, the game runs super smooth for me, and the level design is mind-bending.  It's very fast paced, and at higher difficulty levels can be very challenging.

It also has some nice quality of life features, like an holographic guide that can help you navigate through the twisted corridors and lead you to your next goal.  This is great for beginners that are still getting used to 6DOF, but vetrans don't need to enable tho guide if they don't want to.

I've only played a couple hours so far, but I'm already really loving the game.  It's a very reasonable price as well.

If you enjoyed Descent, that this is really a no-brainer.  Do yourself a favor and pick this game up, you won't regret it.

If you've played Descent
----------------------------------------------------
It's literally Descent 4 under a different name, so if you enjoyed the previous games, get this one. New maps, new weapons, new enemies, epic new soundtrack. The graphics aren't as revolutionary as Descent and Descent 3 were for their time, but it gets the job done.

The biggest criticism I can level against it from the perspective a Descent veteran is that it doesn't evolve the formula a lot. It's a pretty ""safe"" game from the perspective of, it didn't try anything really outside the box from previous games in the series: It's still a linear string of missions with a few secret levels on the side, it's still you against world, it's it's still a matter of finding and blowing the reactor then finding the escape tunnel.  It would have been nice to see them try something like adding allies, strategic/resource-management gameplay, an overworld, dynamic loot, etc etc. The most significant addition is the upgrade points system which.... It's not *bad*, but they don't let you reassign points or really specialize into any one area. There's only 2 upgrade levels per system and if you explore levels thoroughly you'll get a ton of upgrades, so there's really no concept of replaying the campaign over with different a different loadout e.g. specifically a cannon sniper, or a missile boat, or a minelayer.


----------------------------------------------------
If you have not played Descent
----------------------------------------------------
This is a ""6 degrees of freedom"" game (6DOF), where you pilot a space ship through zero-gravity environments. You can yaw, pitch and roll like an aircraft, move backward and forward, and also slide laterally up/down or left/right.  Getting used to the controls might take a little but, the smooth flight physics and total freedom makes just getting around the levels feel enjoyable in itself.

You'll pick up a variety of primary weapons (machine guns and laser type things) and secondary weapons (rockets, missiles and bombs) and be able to use both of these simultaneously. Secondary weapons tend to pack a big punch but ammunition is fairly limited, while your primaries use energy or bullets which are plentiful. Each weapon is aimed at specific tactical scenario, and learning to quickly recognize the best weapon for a given situation and deploy it is key.

Levels are large and complicated. The 6DOF flight model means that you will be twisting and turning in every direction. Levels usually have a general sense of ""this way up"",  but doors and hallways will often split off at all kinds of crazy directions. There is an auto map feature in the game to help you find your way around by showing you where you  have been and where you have not, and there's also a friendly guide bot that can lead you. So navigating the levels requires some lateral thinking but are not intended to literally be mazes.

Enemies? There's lots of enemies to shoot at. The story is the classic AI-gone-rogue horror show, where all of the machines meant to build, mine, and defend the space colonies have gone haywire and now attack you on sight. There's a good variety of different robots, which though they kind of look similar, have very different weapons and tactics. Some robots are relatively stupid and just lumber in your general direction firing off plasma cannons, while other robots are weak and sneaky and like to shoot missiles at you while your back is turned then run away.  There's even melee robots that will rush at you and try to dismantle your ship with buzz saws and giant claws. Robots are generally smart, challenging, and you'd swear they are actually working together sometimes....",1561929995,1561929995,True,7,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Es ist ein Arcade-artiger 6DOF-Shooter, eine Art Remake von Descent aus dem Jahr 1995, das durch seine eing√§ngige Steuerung im gravitationslosen 3D-Raum beeindrucken kann.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1767571284

Unsere Aufgabe in den sich √§hnelnden Leveln ist (soweit ich das gesehen habe), mit unserem Fahrzeug Stationen von Feinden zu s√§ubern und einen bestimmten Zielpunkt zu erreichen, meist um dann die Station zu sprengen und zu verschwinden. Auf unserem Weg m√ºssen wir gewisse Objekte einsammeln, um Zugang zu anderen Bereichen zu erlangen. Andere Objekte stocken unsere Vorr√§te an Munition und Energie wieder auf. Weitere Objekte erm√∂glichen uns den Zugang zu geheimen Kammern, die wiederum etwas f√ºr uns bereit halten.

Die K√§mpfe sind nicht so schwierig. In bisher unerforschten Bereichen lauern sie auf dich. Einige kommen kamikazartig auf dich zu, andere feuern auf dich, sobald sie dich entdeckt haben. Das ist nicht hochkompliziert und insofern vielleicht nur eine Weile unterhaltsam.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1767570051

Das alles ist nicht spektakul√§r aber nett gemacht. An sich ein rasanter Shooter, Action pur mit entsprechend fetziger Musik. Allerdings sind die Stationen geradezu Labyrinthe, in denen man sich verirren kann, weil alles sich irgendwie √§hnelt und weil man wegen der Bewegung im 3D-Raum oft nicht mehr weiss, wo ""oben"" und ""unten"" ist. In den ersten Leveln ging es dennoch noch recht gut, aber dann habe ich viel zu oft die Orientierung verloren und irrte ewig lange durch leere Korridore umher, nur um herauszufinden, wo es weitergeht.

Die 3D-Karte, die man aufrufen kann, ist ganz OK, obwohl es immer etwas dauert, die aktuelle Ausrichtung des Fahrzeuges mit der Ausrichtung der Karte zu koordinieren, um sich zu orientieren, aber sie zeigt NICHT an, wo es lang geht. Vielleicht ist das Absicht, aber dann geht mir das gegen den Strich. Stirbt man doch mal, kann man den ganzen Level √ºbrigens neu beginnen. So habe ich den Phoebe-Komplex x-mal probiert, bis es mir wirklich Oberkante Schnauze stand, durch die leeren G√§nge zu streunern. Ein einfacher Wegweiser, im HUD oder in der Karte w√§re ein Segen gewesen.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1767569701

Die Grafik ist relativ gut, die Gegner, die Sch√ºsse alles ganz nett gemacht, aber die Umgebung ist √ºberaus eint√∂nig.

Der Sound ist nett, vor allem mit wummernder Musik und kr√§ftigen Ger√§uschen f√ºr Sch√ºsse und Explosionen.

Die Steuerung mit dem Gamepad ist sehr gut. Ich war erstaunt, wie gut die Steuerung im 3D-Raum funktioniert.

Pro & Contra:

+ Arcade-artige Shooter-Action
+ Gelungene 6DOF-Steuerung

o Labyrinth-artige Umgebung

- Repetitive Umgebung und Abl√§ufe
- Keine Zielwegweiser
- Daher (sp√§ter, evtl.) langes Umherirren auf der Suche nach der Fortsetzung

For those of you who played Descent, this was developed by the original developers, and it shows.

If you've never played this type of game before the controls will take some practice, but hang in there for a bit and you'll be surprised how quickly you catch on.  Once you do gain a basic understanding of the control scheme, this game handles like butter.

11/10 for sound and graphics, I am in love with the synthwave-esque sound track, it compliments the frantic gameplay very well.  It's shocking that the graphics in this game were developed by such a small team, they give AAA games a run for their money.  Not to mention the lighting effects, which I'm normally not one for noticing these sorts of things, but they are incredible.

The gameplay is, however, where this game truly shines.  As I stated, the gameplay is an improved version of descent in every possible way (for those unfamiliar, think like an old school arcade style shooter like Doom or Quake, but with an extra degree of movement.  So, in essence you are floating in the air and can move up and down like you would normally move forward/backward/left/right).  
     The single player campaign is excellent, with a large variety in each level, and tons of secrets and power-ups to find.  Unlike Descent, you will be able to spend your power-up points to permanently upgrade your ship, which adds an interesting element of replayability.  
     There is a multiplayer mode, I haven't played very much of it, but from what I've heard it is very smooth.  
     The final mode is Challenge mode, which is a horde like gametype where you try to survive as long as possible against wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies.  This is my favorite mode, and is a good way to hone your skills if you needs some practice with the controls.

The only thing I think that could improve this game is if they allowed the campaign to be played co-operatively.

I really think the devs poured their heart and soul into this game, they knocked it out of the park in every area.  I would definitely recommend this title to anybody who wants a quality game with addictive gameplay",1558569972,1617464606,True,17,0,0.661257505416870117,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's Descent in a good and bad way. Overload is as we remember Descent with our nostalgia glasses on.

The gameplay has not changed much, so it has the same feeling as Descent,
but the game does not feel fresh at least to Descent veterans.
Everything here feels too familiar and the story could not be less interesting.
Sometimes we load up an old game to find out why we uninstalled it.
And so it is with Overload. It feels as if we have played the game already. So I am a bit disappointed. And my motivation to complete Overload is at a low point.

However the graphics are smooth, the weapons are a blast, the controls are perfect.
And to my knowledge there is still no other game that achieved the same as Descent,
though there are some cheap clones who tried to copy it's gameplay.
And when I now see a video of Descent I can hardly go back to those graphics after Overload is here.

After giving Overload a second try I am even more bored. I had to disable the (heavy metal like) soundtrack. The unforgetable original midi soundtrack was much cooler. The story is not only boring but annoyingly boring with bad voice acting, disturbing a potential flow. 
The first level does not even have a reactor to blow up, just terminate every enemy and getting beamed out. Enemies and enviroments look great but samey.
The levels are not immersive (no sense of a real place like a mining station).
So this is maybe fun for multiplayer or VR, but I have no more desire to play this as a singleplayer game without VR.",1557782089,1579726268,True,8,3,0.55041128396987915,0,False,False,False,False,,,

i remember spending hours exploring the tunnels of descent, jumping when those clawed slasher bots snuck up behind me. and giggling like a child (because i was a child 20+ yrs ago) when i dropped an earthshaker on a single drone. just because overkill. 

I hope to see sequels, lots of them. this game is everything i wished Descent 3 was back in the day, except prettier. its a modernized Descent, but the flight mechanic and combat are true to their roots, lots of low velocity projectiles, defensive flying. interesting weapons. the creators didn't forget anything that made the original games great/iconic. 

so far so good. still hoping to find an earthshaker missile. i'm only a few missions in but i can se this becoming one of my favorite titles. i hope the team at descendent studios is paying attention, admittedly their game was looking prettier than this, last time i played it, but if the gameplay isn't as good as this, everyone will know the real successor to the Descent legacy is Overload.",1551238743,1551239590,True,11,0,0.64502263069152832,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overload ist ein Spiel, bei dem man wahrlich nicht wei√ü, wo oben und unten ist, da man st√§ndig ein Gef√§hrt steuert, dass sich mit Hilfe einer Drehung die Decke zum Boden machen kann und umgekehrt. (Simpel gesagt, man dreht eine Kamera.)
Und da f√§ngt auch schon meine erste [i]Warnung[/i] zum Spiel an. [b]Wer, bei zu viel Bewegung, schnell mal unter Schwindel leidet, sollte lieber die Finger vom Spiel lassen![/b]
Overload ist mit seinen engen durchfliegenden Korridoren, auch eine recht klaustrophobische Erfahrung, weshalb bei mir stets der Wunsch aufkam, dass das Spiel mich irgendwann mal doch im Weltraum spielen lassen w√ºrde und nicht immer in engen G√§ngen. Leider ist mir dieser Wunsch verwehrt geblieben.
Irgendwann wird das Spiel auch mal repetitiv. St√§ndig auf Drohnen einzuballern macht halt nur bedingt Spa√ü und das auch nur f√ºr eine kurze Zeitdauer.
Und dennoch. Diese kurze Zeitdauer, bevor das Spiel irgendwann repetitiv geworden ist, ist der Grund, warum ich das Spiel letztendlich empfehle.
Spiele wie Doom, Serious Sam, oder auch Overload sind einfach so simpel im Design, dass es irgendwann einfach unumg√§nglich ist, Langeweile zu versp√ºren, aber bis es soweit war, hatte ich stets viel Spa√ü mit dieser Art von Spiel!
Wer also kurzen, aber vergn√ºglichen Ballerspa√ü haben m√∂chte, ist hier also genau richtig! Wenn man es auch nur auf eine halbe Stunde pro Tag verteilt, da sonst das Spiel an einem zerren k√∂nnte.

Kommen wir f√ºr die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:

[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]

+ Grafikm√§√üig hat Overload einiges zu bieten. Lichteffekte und Reflexionen im Allgemeinen haben mich von ihrer Sch√∂nheit fast schon geblendet!
+ Die Musik strotzt nur so vor Energie! Jedoch habe ich mich irgendwann selbst dabei ertappt, dass ich ihn irgendwann schlichtweg √ºberh√∂rt habe
+ Beeindruckende Optionsm√∂glichkeiten. Da l√§sst sich beinahe alles N√∂tige einstellen
+ Auch wenn die Geschichte f√ºr mich belanglos war, so haben wenigstens die Synchronsprecher sich M√ºhe gegeben, sie etwas interessanter r√ºberzubringen
+ Das Spiel ist recht gut optimiert worden. Ich konnte alles auf Ultra ohne Probleme spielen
+ Secrets sind ziemlich gut versteckt und haben immer wieder Freude gebracht, sofern man eines finden konnte. Allerdings hatte ich mit den Secrets auch so meine Probleme (siehe Contra)
+ Mir hat es irgendwie gefallen, dass jede Mission mit einer Zerst√∂rung endete
+ Die automatische Verbesserung von Upgrades war, fand ich jedenfalls, ein interessantes Feature. Das habe ich noch nirgends irgendwo gesehen
+ Das Item [i]Tarnung[/i] ist zwar so gestaltet worden, wie man es erwartet, dass die KI meinen Standpunkt nur kennt, wenn ich schie√üe und dementsprechend auf meine vermutete Position schie√üt, allerdings fand ich das total geil, wenn ich so die KI ausgetrickst hatte. Hat wirklich Spa√ü gemacht!

[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]

- Es ist ziemlich unbefriedigend, wenn man ein Secret gefunden hat, aber die T√ºr dazu verschlossen ist und man erst noch einen Knopf, oder dergleichen zerschie√üen muss, um hinein zu gelangen. Oft habe ich mir dann selbst gesagt, dass es das einfach nicht wert sei
- Die Geschichte ist absolut belanglos. Klar, ein solches Spiel kauft man sich nicht wegen der Geschichte, aber ich m√∂chte es dennoch mal erw√§hnt haben
- Im Verlauf des Spiels macht man oftmals so ziemlich das gleiche. Man findet Schl√ºssel zu Sicherheitszug√§ngen, stets von Level 1 bis 3, zerst√∂rt einen Reaktor oder rettet Crewmitglieder und flieht dann. Da h√§tte wirklich Abwechslung reingeh√∂rt. Im Allgemeinen √§ndert sich im Laufe der Kampagne stets die Karte und erst gegen Ende wurde von dieser Formel endlich mal abgewichen

[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]

+- Hier und da, habe ich Rechtschreibfehler in der √úbersetzung gefunden
+- Vor lauter Explosionen kann es mal vorkommen, dass man Gegner manchmal nicht sieht
+- Die Gegner-KI ist nicht wirklich die Beste. Beispielsweise scheint sie damit gelegentlich √ºberfordert zu sein, mir durch T√ºren zu folgen
+- Der Ladebildschirm h√§tte etwas besser gestaltet werden k√∂nnen

Overload kann man sich mal zulegen, wenn man mal wieder den Drang zu ballern hat. Allerdings w√ºrde ich dies zu einem Sale empfehlen. Overloads Kampagne ist schnell durchgespielt und ich bezweifle, dass das Gameplay mich noch an der Stange halten wird, um vorschnell zur√ºckzukehren und mehr zu spielen.

Ich danke f√ºrs Lesen und w√ºnsche sehr viel Spa√ü beim Spielen! ;-)

Sono sempre stato un grande appassionato di Descent, il gioco del '95 dei Parallax. All'uscita del 2, l'anno dopo, non stavo pi√π nella pelle e le aspettative furono ampiamente ripagate con novit√† di tutto rispetto (SVGA!!!) e una maggiore diversificazione dei ""mondi"" che si andavano a visitare.
Questo Overload √® sicuramente il degno successore dei sopracitati titoli: c'√® lo stesso vibe di allora, con un controllo fenomenale da joypad (imprescindibile, direi), un bel feed nell'uso delle armi e mostri vintage in giro per le miniere.
Cercare segreti √® intrigante, cos√¨ come capire, leggendo la mappa in 3D, se sia pi√π conveniente una data strada piuttosto che un'altra. Azzeccato il tocco di potenziare la nave/armi grazie ai power-up (RPG style) e, pi√π in generale, GRANDE sfoggio di Unity da parte dei Revival Production.

[h1]MA...[/h1]
Nonostante le mappe siano ben costruite e la navigazione per i corridoi sia un piacere, si sente la monotonia che gi√† si leggeva nel primo Descent, con una certa frustrazione negli ultimi livelli, dovuta allo sleale posizionamento dei nemici e alla loro estrema potenza (cosa che spinge verso la vile modalit√† quicksave/quickload).
La storia √® esposta prima di ogni livello dal computer di bordo e supportata da registrazioni audio durante la partita: un metodo davvero poco efficace (e lento) se si vuol catturare l'attenzione del giocatore annoiato.
Visivamente non c'√® grande variet√† nelle location e i mostri sono tutti uguali a distanza d'ingaggio (tranne un paio). Ci√≤ spegne l'esaltazione mano a mano che il gioco procede (almeno nel mio caso).
Personalmente, dei 16 livelli di cui si compone il single player, me ne sono divorati una decina in due o tre giorni, per poi rallentare inesorabilmente e finire gli ultimi a fatica e NON per la difficolt√†, seppur elevata&scorretta, ma per noia.
Un co-op con qualche amico avrebbe indorato la pillola, ma il multiplayer si limita al solito PvP, senza alcun tipo di PvE, esattamente come vent'anni fa. [b]:-([/b]
Pelo nell'uovo: ho trovato fastidiosa la scarsa ""intelligenza"" della guida olografica, che su carta ci dovrebbe aiutare a trovare armi e munizioni senza impazzire con la mappa, ma che spesso ci porta a quelle di cui siamo gi√† pieni. Non penso ci volesse molto a limare un po' questa sua brutta abitudine.

Quindi 'sto Overload vale la pena o no? Dipende. Se siete fan dei vecchi Descent e dei giochi spaziali in cui il sotto diventa sopra in un istante, non lasciatevi intimorire dalle lamentele e compratelo: vi divertirete (soprattutto all'inizio). Se per√≤ siete nuovi al genere provate prima il [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/450220/Overload_Playable_Teaser_30/ ]demo[/url].
Io ci vedo pi√π pregi che difetti, ma √® innegabile che la pessima abitudine di creare gli ultimi livelli con nemici che ti arrivano addosso dal nulla (dicasi ""aumento di difficolt√† con mancanza di idee""), abbia un po' rotto il ca**o (scusate il francese).",1550276307,1550276307,True,3,0,0.57024538516998291,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Room for improvement :  

I think that a co op campaign would expand the fun to be had in this game by a long shot.  Having maps that require 2 or 4 or more players would allow an enormous amount of complexity, puzzle solving, and ambush tactics.  I would love to get in on a game like that.

I had no idea how to play, I was a little kid doing everything wrong.  I thought shooting flares was my gun.  I achieved nothing except wonderment at the idea of a 3D game where you fly around and fight robots.  Now 20-some years later I got to try my hand at the spiritual successor, Overload, and this time‚Ä¶ I know how to shoot. 

[h1] A Brief History [/h1]

Overload was kickstarter funded in March of 2016 and went into development under Revival Productions, a team with members of the original Descent team.  It was released just over two years later in May of 2018.  The whole event snuck under my radar.  Probably because I had my gaze focused on another Descent spiritual successor, Descent: Underground.  A game also successfully crowdfunded with some former Star Citizen developers.  However, unlike Overload, it had a much more rocky release and is currently back in development for a single player campaign.

[h1] On to the Actual Game [/h1]

I have to start by saying this game is definitively representative of Descent as my nostalgia-riddled mind can remember it.  It really feels as close to the original game in all of the core aspects.  I know most people aren‚Äôt familiar with games well over two decades old, but luckily you can still buy and play all of the original series on Steam.  Nice, right?  Yet, if you don‚Äôt want to jump back in time, Overload brings back a much of the gameplay, but with a wonderful rendition of modern graphics.    

What sets Overload apart from the modern resurgence of space dogfighting games is how it squeezes you in to tight spaces and down narrow maze-like hallways.  I‚Äôm not using ‚Äúmaze-like‚Äù loosely here, with the nature of your ability to fly in any direction and roll 360 degrees without much defining what is up or down, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to get lost in this game.  Navigation, of course, is used as one of the main components in the challenge of the gameplay.  The level design has you traveling into random corners and through hidden doorways to both find secret bonus items and upgrades as well as progress through the game itself.  It can easily be overwhelming, especially early on, as you desperately dip in and out of the massive 3D rendered map looking for some hallway or doorway you missed.  To combat this, Overload includes a ‚Äòhologuide‚Äô that you can pop up at any time that will lead you to the next objective, whether that‚Äôs the end of the level or just another key to unlock a door.   

[h1] Fight the Power [/h1]

As you progress through the relatively short story and it‚Äôs 15 levels, your biggest hurdle outside of figuring out where the hell to go is shooting your many different weapons at a decently diverse set of enemies.  You end up with eight standard weapons that pull from two pools, energy and ammo , as well as eight secondary weapons in the form of various missiles, rockets, and mines that have a wider variety of functionality, but a much smaller pool of ammo.  While on the relatively low difficulty that I played, ammo was more than abundant, it is important to make sure you use weapons efficiently and swap regularly for what best fits the situation.  You can (and should) spend time exploring levels to find upgrade points that you can use to make weapons do more damage, fire faster, or in some way increase their effectiveness.  In addition to this, you have to split the limited points with upgrading other portions of your ship like its health and speed, which can be just as important when things are getting out of hand.  

It may not seem like it at first, but things will get chaotic as enemies can be generated from spawners (that you can destroy) and some are particularly good making things hectic by charging right at your face for massive damage or filing the screen with explosives.   Overload‚Äôs level design is specifically tailored to allow these enemy robots appear out of hidden doors and from around corners to be extra effective with their attacks.  The oddly Jurassic way they often roar when they attack from that hiding spot makes for tense moments as well.  Yet it doesn‚Äôt really step into the realm of the tension you‚Äôd feel in a survival horror game since you‚Äôre armed to the teeth with robot shredding weaponry.

[h1] Cherry Picking the Past [/h1]

Overload gets a lot of things right.  It has plenty of action, tons of secrets and exploration for the people who are willing to dive into that insanity, and even a decent story that gets moving as the game progresses.  The soundtrack is a little hit or miss, but is very prominent throughout, so that could be a strong point for some as well.  If you look at the campaign alone it is a bit short, but if you‚Äôre a completionist, you enjoy challenge levels, or you manage to find some people online to play the multiplayer with, you can sink many more hours into the game.  It could probably also benefit from a little more visual design variety since nearly every level features the same gray walls and industrial assets with rock caves thrown in randomly.  It also wouldn‚Äôt hurt to see a little more variety in the objective types for each level, where the vast majority are simply destroying a reactor.  Yet, even with those issues it‚Äôs not hard to see that this is a great spiritual successor and fun to play.  However, at this point seven months after release, it‚Äôs probably safe to say you should be looking for it a good bit less than the base $30 price tag.

I think we have the privilege these days of a nice combination of accessible game development tools and a huge history of great games that can be revisited to entertain old fans and make new ones.  Overload took a classic franchise of the past and built a game that not only appeals to the old farts that enjoyed it back then, but can also be appreciated by people who weren‚Äôt even alive when Descent was in stores (on shelves, you had to go pick up a giant box, it was cool).  That quality is sometimes forgotten in modern remakes and spiritual successors, and I‚Äôm always happy to see a one that has a potential for broad spectrum appeal.

I was expecting something much more lowbudget since 6degree shooters are not super popular; but while this is certainly not an AAA game, it doesn't have a low budget feel either. A lot of time, care, and polish was put into it. It runs really smoothly.

The best way to describe this game would be, think Doom, but more 3D and with robot spaceships.

Like Doom, you level up by finding secrets (in the main campaign), but my beleif is, that this is the biggest downside of the game. This is just my personal opinion, and I know many will disagree, but I think in a [i]shooter[/i], leveling up should be earned by [i]shooting[/i] things. For example, kill two enemies with one shoot, get double the upgrade points, ect.

Realy nice. A true successor to Descent and a very good 6 degrees of freedom game. Graphics are sharp, xplosions are mind blowing, gameplay is comfortable, supports vr and there is a level editor :)

Long review:

Overload is a 6 degree of freedom space shooting game against robots. Aaahhh, even this reminds me of my childhood with descent :) You are gonna clearing levels, actually moons of saturn, jupiter and etc.., from robots. The story is sort of figthing against rebel robots. I think this game is a good successor to Descent and i also hope they release Descent Underground too. I have already paid for that game :D

Gameplay:
You are usualy clearing closed levels, there is no open environments is this game. You will be exploring a map and there is a guide bot that can help you find a securty key or reactor or a power up or robots. The levels are confusing just the right amount :) You are gonna be operating a spaceship from inside. You have primary and secondary weapons. Secondary ones are missiles and explosives. Primary ones are lazers and plasma kind of things.

The weapons are not the most interesting thing about this game. The action and thrill in the game is top notch. Robots are smart and they will track or hunt you down :D In the campaign mode, every mission begins with a breifing and the game informs you about the robots you will face with. The levels have 3 levels of security and those doors need clearance. I would prefer blue, yellow and red keys :( At the end of each level, there is a reactor or a boss robot.

You will find upgrade points in the game and you can upgrade your weapons and ship. Super upgrade points are harder to find and rarer but they will upgrade the ship and weapons beyond the max. The game has 5 different difficutiy settings. I would like to enjoy the game without getting blown up, so i play on trainee difficulty :) Rookie, hotshot, ace, insane are more difficult obviously.

After you complete the campaign without cheating, you will be able to start a new game+. Which is amazing. The game supports vr, i don't have one but it would be super awesome. Controller support is also cool. I play with keyboard and mouse and the customization of controls are plenty.

There are challenge levels where you can select weapons from the get go. I haven't tried the challenges yet but you will be unlocking new ones as you progress. There is amultiplayer but i haven't found anyone :S You can play head to head with a player, choose anrchy mode as free for all or team anarchy agains a team. I don't know if there is an option for coop campaign. That would be cool.

Audio, Visuals
The game has a pretty suited soundtrack. I usualy silence the music in games and listen to my own :D But this one enhances the feeling in the action. Descent 1 is better then this game but that game is legendary. The robots and explosions are making clear noies. You can detect and identify every single chattering. Which is requeired while all sorts of mayhem going around.

Visuals are impressive and optimized. Except from screen space reflections (tooo heavy) and post processing, my i5 2500 and r9 380 rig is able to handle the game at almost 60 solid. The lighting is important in this kind of game and it is done perfectly. The explosions are gonna spread tons of pieces, which is a visual festival for me :)

Cons:
I can't think of any cons actually :D I don't know why but i couldn't find any online matches.

Overall:
If you like space shooting games, this one is good. If you liked Descent, actually there is no possibility of disliking the Descent, if you have played Descent, you will like this.

Descent to me was revolutionary in my eyes because I was still playing Wolfenstein and Doom back then. Overload was able to capture EVERYTHING and provide even more! I kept feeling this was the Descent every fan deserves. Finding out that the original creators were involved in Overload had given me goosebumps and I didn't care whether or not the game was on sale. I had to have it. The graphics is definitely a huge step up and it really felt more immersive with the modern light ambience and spectacular explosion. The music had an obvious retro sound to it but it perfectly matches the intensity of the gaming experience. I love the new ship and weapons upgrade choices between levels because it does make you spend more time looking for those power-ups. My only con is the ship design haha. It's so utilitarian looking. I thought the original design of the ship in Descent was seriously cool. I made so many play-doh versions of it. I hope there's a DLC that will allow you to use the original ship design.

Combat is smooth, fast-paced and at times daunting. In the old Descent I used to be able to retreat to other parts of the level to restock, here you need to actually get into the thick of it, especially if there are fabricators around.

The upgrade and experience system gives players an incentive to give replay the single player campaign and discover all the secrets. It's a cleverly featured role-playing element.

The graphics are superb, however the colour palette seems to have little variation and also the operators look rather similar.  I could identify the robots easier in the old Descent games. Here, you need to wait for shots fired, to realize what you're up against. Also the explosions, while rather impressive, seem to clutter everything up.

Sound and music however seem very punchy, something I liked in the prequels as well. There is plenty of bass to listen to, when you fire your weapons and blow things up.

Welcome to the moons of Saturn, Mining robots are malfunctioning and started attacking the humans working in the factories, It is up to you to destroy the miners. There is a whole story behind it, But honestly that is not what the game is about, I adore the backstory and the insane amount of details, but for me this game is all about the action, blowing up Operators in zero gravity.

These Operators come in many forms, Some come in swarms, some rush in on you and some have nukes with your name on it. They all have the element of suprise, They are placed tightly around corners and will always catch you off guard. It will take some solid strategy and a clear head to clear out the rooms and the tight hallways.

The game is tough as nails, Beating this game on the hardest difficulity is next to impossible. There are also lots of secrets to discover, Collectables, but also hidden weapons and powerups which you can use to upgrade your ship. You can upgrade every weapon, but also your speed, armor, shield, among other things.

Next to the campaign there is a challenge mode for some quick games of carnage. Sadly there is no Offline multiplayer or co op, But it makes up for it with Online PVP. You can go Head 2 Head in a 1 vs 1 deathmatch. You can also play Free for All with 3 to 6 players and Team Deathmatch with 4 to 8 players

The graphics are great, I think it is among the better looking Unity games, It is a very dark and metallic atmosphere, It almost feels like an horror game, But they are just autonomous operators wanting to destroy you, Nothing creepy about that right?

Just learning to control the ship is a pain, It is practically a FPS but just add up down and roll into the controls, But having the freedom to go in every direction really makes for an unique challenge. I think it plays best with 2 combat flight sticks But a Controller works just fine.

The game is non stop action, full of secrets and impossible to clear on the highest difficulity level. It is a must have for anyone who loves a challenge and especially any fan of the 6DOF genre I have to give it a solid 9 It truly is an example for the genre

This is the 6dof FPS successor to nineties Descent, made by the original developers. They are back with all the action packed gameplay fans were waiting for so long down to the iconic music of the first titles. Sure, the enemies look different and the Kodachi ship the player flies cannot replace the beloved Pyro and the PTMC is just a side note in the singleplayer storyline. But make no mistake, this is giving you the original Descent vibe in any way: destroy lights and signs while you explore twisted levels without gravity, fighting off loads of robotic drones and reach the reactor to blow up the whole mine. Along the line you pick up hostages in cryo tubes and tiered access cards replace the good old colored keys. And there are lots of secrets to find and switches to be shot, sometimes giving the players quite a puzzle to solve. If you get lost, summon your holo guide to find what you are looking for.

And this time you really get to know what made the robots turn hostile.

Apart from the campaign there is also a challenge mode, where you navigate a small level and fight against auto-ops that spawn endlessly and to compete on the online leaderboard for highscores. There is a tactical element as well, as you will be able to upgrade your weaponry as you progress and kill bots, each weapon offers a binary choice like either more damage or higher rate of fire. The single player mode has these as well, but upgrades are more varied in the campaign and only availabe to tinker with in between missions.

Some of the challenge maps are part of the campaign as well, available as secret levels. But this time the secret levels do not end your current map and warp you to the next one after you finish them. Instead they teleport you back to the place in the campaign map where you entered them and the secret levels are all running against the clock.

Of course there is a multiplayer mode as well. And while it is really good deathmatch fun, this is where the game does not meet the high standard of its predecessors. There is just Anarchy and Team Deathmatch, no zero gravity game of football and sadly no co-op mode to fight through the main storyline with your friends. It also shows that though this game is a true gem, it is also part of a smal niche: there are only a small number of people playing this online. And most of them know the ins and outs of this genre by heart. But don't be afraid to enter the matches as a newbie, the small community is very friendly to newcomers.

The game also features a wide range of all kinds of options to customize your experience and has fantastic support for gaming peripherals. There is even support for multiple joysticks and gamepads at the same time for a player, so you will be able to play with two flightsticks for example, which do not even need to be the same type. 

Another thing to note is the levels are still built with hollow cubes, just like the first to Descent titles. But this time there are  lots of decals to be tacked on the walls like pipes, lights, wiring, plating, signs and so on and the cubes can be deformed in ways the Descent games were not able to 20 years ago, so the result will not look blocky at all. Even better: the caves really bring the mines those games are staged in to live like never before.

I love everything about this game. Built with love by the team that brought you the classix 6DofF. The community is dedicated and committed, and the Dev team is constantly working on updates and maintaining a close connection with its community on their Discord channel [https://discord.gg/Ke2UVe]

I was surprised by the extent of the single player campain. It felt polished and engaging, considering the story isn't the driving force, I'm always ready to start the next mission. It certainly has that 90s game feel, which I personally think games are missing these days. Truly a fast paced rush of adrenaline. 

There's a lot of games out there that has fantastic semi realistic graphics, and while this game doesn't match up with that level of detail, once you start playing, you wont even notice or care. The graphics are well enough that it Nothing to complain about, it does its job!

As for Multiplayer, it works too, but given the size of the Dev team and how much they put into this game, it's easy to say that some things are lacking, but you can totally forgive them for it. The best way to get into a match is to get onto the discord and say ""Hey! who wants to play?"" and the community will be there to log in with you! But since the community is still small, if you don't request a group to play and you just randomly try to search for a match, you could be waiting white a while in Que. 

While some may want to use their Joystick, I personally recommend this as a mouse and keyboard game. As a Joystick player, I eventually converted back to the mouse, and the controls are smooth and polished and it feels absolutely seamless and fantastic to fly. The sound when making a kill is thrilling and satisfying! and if you turn up the difficulty and make it to the end of a mission, you will certainly feel like you have truly accomplished something!

I have to say that they did a great job. Its just as engaging as the original. The graphics are improved but not to the point of looking overdone. The feel of Decent is 100% there. 

The most notable improvement in my opinion is the mouse control feel. I normally play with a joystick but on the few occasions I had to use my mouse to play it was smooth and not at all motion sickness inducing, unlike past experiences with flying games (orig Descent included).

Overload is a game developed and published by Revival Productions, LLC. and is a sort of 'reboot' of the classic DESCENT series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game is hard especially in single player mode but a fun game nontheless especially with friends which sadly I don't have

Overload overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts!

If you loved the Descent series, this is a must. It's quite good, though perhaps a bit too faithful to the first two games in the series.

Pros:
- Gameplay is exciting and quite polished. The robots show more intelligence and character than in Descent 1/2 and are fun to hunt down.
- EXCELLENT sounds and music.
- The story is not bad. Was surprised to see that there IS a coherent story, certainly compared to Descent 1/2.

Cons:
- The graphics and level design are the biggest letdown. Visually, everything is clean, sterile and boring. The environments are mostly uninspiring. Descent 3 levels were much more atmoshperic, interesting and grand.

This is an incredible game, graphically immersive and very challenging mission wise depending on what difficulty you choose i love the missions but i love MP more.  Like many games that have not long come out of early access it has its fair share of bugs which is understandable and they will be sorted in time.

Where i am torn is the lack of server support in the Oceana region, so i am dependent on servers in the states which i do not mind. In saying that the best server for me ""Oregon"" is a good 100ms ping slower than a North American server that is much further away in another 6Dof game where i can actually compete on a more equal footing with my stateside friends.

Overall I love the game period!

Pros:
Graphically Impressive!
The campaign/missions are fantastic and the story line is rich.
The Control and feel of the game is excellent.

Note: The ability to choose a server would be a nice addition

Cons: There is only 1  
No Server support in the Oceana region for MP which makes for a dreadful experience in MP. Yes i have tried the whole VPN thing and it does not work for me. Us server support is abysmal with the best US server giving me pings in the 280+ range while i can get pings of 160ms+ from the North American server of another 6Dof game which confounds me.

Of Special Note: I have gifted this game to 2 friends one in Germany and one in New Zealand and plan to gift it to another so it has my support and it is a fantastic game.

Finally i can not recommend the Multiplayer aspect of this game for players based in the Oceana region because of the frustrating and very weak server support from the states when i get incredible server support in a similar game. ie approximates 280ms+ as opposed to 160ms+ < this being from a server that is much further. 

This review is open to change should there be an improvement in server support.

The campaign is very short. Multiplayer is very sparsely populated. Those two things mean you probably wont come back and replay the short campaign unless you want to try harder difficulty levels or do the achievements. Now there is the issue with DLC. Community maps being sold as DLC reminds me of the Bethesda Paid Mods scandal. New maps developed by the community being sold by the devs? The original Descent games came with multiple episodes. First one was shareware and then came others if you wanted more of the game. Now we pay full price, which is fine, but devs are charging you money for the hard work of the community. They create tools to make maps so that they dont have to but still charge you money for the content created by the community. That is not okay.

My only complain about this game is the plot and setting are very close to the original trilogy: you're a pilot who flies through mines on various moons, destroying virus-infected robots, and ultimately blowing up a reactor to escape just in the nick of time. I would've liked to see an added twist on this, and I wish they would've kept Descent 3's formula of going outside to the moons' surfaces at times, rather than just flying through a complex of corridors.

If any of the team reads this, kudos to also keeping the original trilogy's difficulty level names. Nice touch. :)

to skip backstory skip to second paragraph...

I had a computer as a child. Since 286s were a thing.  I really started paying attention when the Descent series started to come out.   Descent 2, especially, was a huge thing for me when I was really young.  I can't really say much about the later installments in the series, I played them a little but it wasn't the same.  I did play the Freespace series and did like it but thats another story.  

Overload feels like a great return to form for the series, even if it is only a spiritual succesor.  The way the ship pilots and how the weapons feel really remind me of Descent 2.  Definitely very eerie getting that same feeling from the combat over 20 years later.

The AI is not as sneaky or scary (as Descent 2) but I have only played up to hotshot difficulty so I am not sure if they become that way in hgiher settings.  That being said, in Descent, the higher difficulties just meant FASTER reacting enemies, not necessarily smarter or sneakier.  This aside, I do still like the AI, its just different.

The Graphics are good but not overkill good.  Just enough to make it still feel ""gamey"", which I like.  Game plays very smoothly, framerate wise,even in big fights. I like the level design AND the bot design.  ALMOST as much as Descent 2. 
 Very polished so far.  One thing I did notice is the lack of large interiors for huge fights.  Maybe that changes later on. Maybe its a conscious decision by the developer to keep battles less reliant on kiting.

The Sounds are ok.  Descent 2 had better sound and better music, more on that further on.  I really miss the more unique sounding ""barks"" of bots that were so recognizable in the Descent series.   I remember being TERRIFIED upon hearing the crys of late game bots travelling near by yet still unaware of my prescence.  Especially the ones that shot nukes.  Back then the game ran on a life system so retrying was a lot less of an option.  It did add to the adrenaline and stress but I feel that leaving it out, as Overload has, was ulitimately a good decision.  It makes the game easier to just hop in and start playing, rather than having to get your mind set up and get warmed up.

I haven't played (and don't plan to play) multiplayer.  Its not really my thing for this type of game.

And now for the reason I'm writing this review.  The music... And it won't be what you think I'm going to say...

I credit in game music as starting my passion for music in general as a child.   I can trace my influences back to such composers as Frank Klepacki and Yasunari Mitsuda.  Music is now my livelyhood and it is a very important part of my life.  When I play a game, I pay SPECIAL attention to the music and see if it fits the game's moments well.  Most of the time , recently, I'd have to say no... I am a huge opponent of cookie cutter orchestral scores in ANY game, no matter how intellectual and grand their creation is.  Most games tend to have this now a days but back in the magical era of the 90s and very early 2000s, video game music for action titles was techno, metal and rock.  It  was GREAT time for game music, in my opinion.

Overload tries to straddle the feel of the old Descents with some more EDMish (maybe somewhat industrial if i squint my ears) sounding music which ACTUALLY wasn't half bad.  I actually liked it.  I didn't expect to AT ALL but wanted to give it a chance, as per my habit.  But this brings me to the crux here...

I had planned already to get this game on sale.  I knew EXACTLY what I was going to do when I bought it.  I waited so long for it to drop in price because I had been hurt by sooo many remakes in the past.  When I finally got it I executed my plan.

Acquire a copy of the ORIGINAL RED BOOK AUDIO from Descent 2.  Turn off in game music.  Turn on Descent 2 music.  Turn up volume.  Set difficulty to hard.  

My god it was a glorious experience and still is!  Instant adrenaline upon entering combat.  Somehow the music STILL does this magical thing that predicts the ebb and flow, the tension and release, of the room to room battles.  EVEN IN A DIFFERENT GAME! HOW!

It fits the game WAY better than the original overload music, even though it is good in its OWN right.  It just had no chance.

Its like this style of game was made for that sound 

If you've read this far then you atleast value opinion to a degree.  Take my advice,  buy this game, GET THE MUSIC.  Take some of the crappier tracks out and voila.  Perfect no grav mining tunnel mayhem experience.  Only made far greater if you have the nostalgia to boot.

1. Absolutely horrendous weapon slection and cycling UI. You can only cycle forward with the mouse wheel (unchangeable, I have a mouse with 2 wheels and I can't use the second one effectively), and weapons and missiles are doubled up for each selection key. So there is no way to map 1 weapon or missile per key (also unchangeable). This makes changing weapons in combat error-prone and unintuitive.
2. In the upgrade screen, there is no tech tree allowing you to see upcoming upgrades, so it's hard to tell if a weapon is worth investing in.
3. The save and load game screens have to indication as to which game was saved last, and no quick way to resume the last save.
4. Unskippable death animations without a quick way to reload the last save, but provide an option to restart the level (sure, how many people would like to restart a level from the beginning because they died?)
5. Last few levels don't provide access to upgrades, and you are not warned about that
6. Speed upgrades are week, and afterburner much slower than Descent, making movement feel sluggish

No Hoard
No Flag
Ships that die near players don't damage other players
No Rear view camera with picture in picture method as in HUD.
youc an fire weapons when using after burners
no  netgames server lsit where player can shoose whats erver to join
Unable to join gaqmes thatare already running
Host can't choose was server to host from
Dedicated servers work via OlProxy 0.2.0 only hereby needing 3rd party software to get you server running
Community m,aps need a seperate folder in the Overload DLC folder
Many community maps suffer ligting bugs that is caused by Overload's Unity Engine.
CryEngine 4.0 or Unreal Engine with Vulkan API would of been far superior
No Survival mode[/b]


And I know there was a limited budget, even I know some of these things could of been added Co-Op & Flag mode for example, would of given Overload a much better content.

rookie difficulty was too easy and just a fly through, which made me miss out on a lot of what makes the game. start with hotshot difficulty at least. i now restarted my first playthrough on ace difficulty and have to plan my ammunition and constantly save and load because it is that challenging in later levels, but it is fun. play with mouse and keyboard, it's more like an ego-shooter and you wont hit much with a gamepad. the sound design is notable, you get different songs in different levels, sometimes horror-game like background sounds in different areas and some of the coolest weapon sounds ive ever heard. oh, and the enemy sounds are like a horde of demons coming down on you. well done.

This is a Descent series game and is everything Descent stood for back in the 90's.

The single word: Descent. Those familiar with that game will feel at home with this one. If you want to feel the controls to feel more like the originals for the mouse, turn a lot of the optional mouse settings off and it'll play like the legend. It's not a 1 to 1 remake, but it doesn't have to be.

Majority of the changes between this and Descent are positive, and I'm not only talking about aesthetics. Sound effects have the right amount of crunch to them. Enemies are easy to spot and the improved graphics aren't intrusive to the experience. The physics of the ship are as tight as the spiritual predecessor and the weapons...the WEAPONS!

The weapons really show off the innovation of what could be done in a repetitive shooter market. Many of these weapons draw inspiration (or are blatant rips) from Luke's previous 2D Dual Stick shooter, Inferno (which is great in its own right). Many weapons are ingenious and extremely useful, like the Creepers and the Reflex (especially when fully upgraded). Others are clearly taken directly from Descent in form and function, like the Thunderbolt (Fusion) and the Impulse (Laser). There are weapons for different playstyles. Enjoy close quarters? Use the Crusher or Cyclone. Prefer to play it safe from a distance or aren‚Äôt too accurate with your shots? Use the Reflex, Missile Pods, or Hunters. Are you actually accurate with your shots? Use Falcons and the Driller. Another added layer is the upgrade system. It is a welcome addition and definitely good at empowering your weapons. It takes a little time to get used to, but once you do, you‚Äôll be scouring maps for precious upgrade points to upgrade your favorite weapons. Want old fashions Quad Lasers? Done. Gauss or Vulcan Cannon? You‚Äôre set. Every weapon feels like it fits into a different niche and has its own purpose except maybe the Time Bomb (except when fully upgraded) and the Flak Cannon‚Ä¶which to be fair, I haven‚Äôt given enough time to try.

The level design is phenomenal. You‚Äôll find yourself crawling through levels that twist and turn in every direction that even the auto-map gets confusing. Every inch of each map is teeming with encounters. The only critique I have here is that a lot of the areas have a samey feel. Maybe it‚Äôs just the nostalgia goggles, but I miss the elemental themed levels (as clich√© as they might be) from the classic games. While comparing a game like this really isn‚Äôt fair, it still doesn‚Äôt help that I can‚Äôt visually tell if I was in Titan Collider or Phoebe. Of course, the ending levels are very far placed from the rest of the game so you get a good amount of variance there.  Additionally, in this game, I feel that enemies can be a bit repetitive so that you‚Äôre used to the same Harpies, Gorgons, Wyverns‚Ä¶and the darn Golem/Reavers. Other than that, the ship design looks like a flying toaster and customization is fairly simple. I also wish that pressing Esc would fast forward so you can see all the text for cutscenes instead of skipping the cutscene altogether.

And that‚Äôs it. Those 4 minor gripes are the only things that bother me about this game. Just about everything else is amazing. This game fits like a glove when you get the controls right, the difficulty is great, the level design is great, and the weapons are the best. Definitely recommend this for anyone interested in skill based combat in an old-new genre of shooter. 9/10 in my book :)",1533581263,1533583418,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Descent has always been something of the odd man out in the pantheon of FPS classics. Despite innovating on the basic first-person formula with its six-degrees-of-freedom free-flight combat, it never took off or spawned the slew of imitators its peers did. It did get two sequels and a brilliant spin-off space sim series, though, and now after far too long it has returned. Only now it‚Äôs called Overload, and all the names are different. The head-spinning combat and ravenous robots and flashy weapons and explosive escapes are all back, along with a few new tricks learned in the intervening decade. But in some ways, Overload might be a little too tethered to its ancestors to really rise to its occasion.

Space mining corp Juno Offworld has pushed out to the moons of Saturn with their Cronus Frontier initiative, a network of bases manned by skeleton crews and worked by robotic autonomous operators. Something has gone drastically wrong though, and the auto-ops have begun taking their mining lasers and rock crushers to the humans instead of the minerals. Your ship, the Iberia, just happens to be in the right place to intervene and happens to have a smart little gunship for you to pilot on search and destroy missions. To root out whatever madness is afoot you‚Äôll need to battle back the auto-ops and destroy the reactors of the fallen facilities, hopefully escaping the blast in the process.

The formula is very much the same as in the first two Descents, but new to Overload is a fairly involved story. The pre-mission briefings drop tons of tidbits about what‚Äôs going on in Saturn‚Äôs orbit as you gear for your next assault, and each mission has a bunch of concise audio logs that detail the strange machinations that led to the robot rebellion. Eventually the many plot threads weave together to explain the whole mess and point you to a final showdown that‚Ä¶ honestly only resolves a small piece of the story. I‚Äôll forgive them a weak ending for keeping the narrative running just through text and logs, because there‚Äôs a surprising amount going on that you only really hear about.

Your concern is going to be getting in, blowing everything up, and getting back in one piece, and that won‚Äôt be a simple task. Being a six-degrees-of-freedom game, you have the ability to fully traverse the cavernous chambers and winding passages of each facility. These places are packed with deadly robots, with smarter and fiercer ones appearing the further into the adventure you get. Battles are hectic, with you dodging lasers and missiles from every angle and returning fire with your own impressive arsenal. As you progress you‚Äôll unlock gatling lasers, flak cannons, homing missiles, room-clearing warheads, and even exotic tools like time-dilating bombs and vortex-generating missiles.

Finding secrets earns you upgrade points to improve your arms, and this part of the game deserves special note. Overload is absolutely THICK with secrets, tucking away literally dozens per mission. They can be as simple as a floor panel that slides open when you bump it, or a button hidden behind a grating that drops the forcefield around a reactor that powers another forcefield that leads to a maze of tunnels loaded with enemies and items. The upgrade points you find are split into two types, normal and super, used to upgrade each weapon twice. The normal upgrade usually gives a single bonus like more damage or a new feature like enemy tracking, while the super upgrade lets you pick one of two powerful suites of improvements. Even if you‚Äôre not dogged in your search for secrets you‚Äôll be able to upgrade your favorite weapons, but if you‚Äôre the obsessive type you‚Äôll come out with a devastating arsenal.

And you kinda need it, because Overload can get pretty brutal. I say this fully acknowledging there are five difficulty levels and you can switch at any time, but I was determined to beat the third and while I did, it wasn‚Äôt always a pleasant experience. The early levels ease you into fighting dangerous auto-ops and big swarms, and the middle levels ramp this up to a thrilling challenge. By mission 11 it was getting a little ridiculous, as new enemies could pound my armor down to nothing in an instant if I ever failed to dodge or juke a salvo. There are no checkpoints either, so I resorted to saving regularly once missions got to be 40 minutes long and the risk of failing an escape at the very end became real. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the last four missions of the game have a significant change of pace that I found more frustrating than anything.

Overload fits right in with the recent wave of aggressively-retro FPSes, and not just for its old-school sensibilities about challenge. The sixteen sprawling levels you‚Äôll blast your way through feature dizzying networks of shafts and chambers that make the most of your free-flight movement, just as the original Descent and its sequel did. But modern level design has been making places look like actual places for decades now, and Overload‚Äôs levels‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. As detailed as the auto-ops are and as luscious as the particle effects get, the rooms your battles rage in tend to be extremely plain. They never look like real, functional locales, just tunnels for you to hunt keys and secrets and robots in. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they serve their purpose in their layout and complexity, but I have no doubt that a talented environment artist could have added details like catwalks and airlocks to make the levels feel lived-in and real.

Despite these missteps, Overload‚Äôs gameplay is some of the most hectic and gratifying you‚Äôll get in the genre. Your weapons feel powerful and impressive as they shove auto-ops around and shatter them against the walls. Sparks, fire, and metal bits cascade through rooms with every robot you smash, making huge battles veritable typhoons of destruction. And for the explorers in the audience, you‚Äôll have hundreds of secrets to turn up across the seven or eight hours it takes to blast through the campaign. There‚Äôs a challenge mode, New Game+, and even multiplayer that you probably shouldn‚Äôt count on being populated but hey, it‚Äôs there. Overload is the Descent revival we didn‚Äôt know we wanted, still a little stuck in the past but flashy and fun enough to make a solid shooter.

You can have amazing games with retro graphics and sound and people will love it. But why? What do they have in common? Let's take two recent success stories with Sonia Mania and Shovel Knight.

Sonic Mania - ""Exciting level design, a stellar soundtrack, and cool expansions on the original formula""
Sonic Mania - ""A breakneck platformer that uses classic Sonic as a foundation for something fresh and exciting. ""
Shovel Knight - ""Shovel Knight is a modern classic that takes the 2-D platforming genre and modernizes it. ""
Shovel Knight - ""Old and new in almost the best ways.""

What is the common factor here? Both have retro graphics and sound but their gameplay is modern. So what happens when you have a game with modern graphics and retro gameplay? A very mediocre game, thats what. And that is Overload.

When you look at the reviews, you can see that there is a great deal of gushing about how much this is like the old Decent games. The way the ship handles, the enemies, weapons and environments. And they are very, very right. It's like the developers have been locked in hypersleep for the last 20 years and then woke up and decided to make a game. But this isn't what actually happened, they've simply rejected what progress designers have made on how to make games as fun as possible over the years, In their own words, they wanted to bring back what is missing in modern games. Things such as enemies appearing right next to you when you push a button. Remember that from the old days? Opening a doorway with an enemy facing you on the otherside for a free hit. Ahh, that old acorn! Running along face-grinding walls and shooting random surfaces to open hidden stashes of weapons and powerups. Oh, the fun! Enemies that stand perfectly still and silent only to attack without warning as soon as you turn a corner. Every level having the exact same goals with no variety. I won't carry on. Put simply, everything which drags a game down and everything which has been tossed away as refuge by modern games is back! This folks is the Mighty No 9 of 2018 - the wrong kind of retro.

The level design and balance is equally as poor, with you frequently being fired upon down narrow corridors where you have no room to dodge and you need to back up to the nearest corner to play peek-a-boo. Whole rooms cleared because you went in, backed out and then just shot the bots as they came through the narrow doorway one by one making the whole affair a tedious chore. Enemies dropping health like candy because the developers haven't got the hang of enemy placement and map layout so in order to keep you alive they have to keep throwing health at you. Powerups, like invulnerability, hidden in secret compartments well away from the action so when you do get them they're utterly useless. There is also the questionable fact that it is impossible for them to carefully design levels to be fair for the player when their difficulty system increases the projectile speed of enemies. So if you're in a room with a bot at the other end and you can just narrowly avoid incoming fire on the lowest setting, it then becomes impossible on the high settings. Same room, same bot placement but with a completely different result. Suddenly you need cover but none is provided.

But it's not all doom and gloom. The music is nice and the graphics are decent. But Overload is simply the wrong way to do retro games. It tugs on the nostalgia by including hi-scores and Decent-like gameplay but it ends up being mediocre because it revived all of the great things about the series along with all the bad game design habits that should stay in the past.

4) A difficulty curve that eases you into the 6-Degrees of Freedom, but then thoroughly challenges you once you've mastered the basics.
5) A narrative with a sympathetic villain and an equivalently morally ambiguous organization giving you mandates creates a sense of crossed loyalties; is it worth this sacrifice to build a new world? No, it's much more than that, and you'll keep second guessing your own actions as well as those of others until it's explained at the crescendo.

There are three primary game modes available:

[h1]Single Player Campaign[/h1]
Much like the old-school shooters it draws influence from, the biggest draw in this game is easily the single player campaign. The Cronus Frontier campaign is no-nonsense, fast-paced action. While a little bit shorter compared to the classics of old, the overall level design and difficulty balance is much more polished. With five selectable difficulty levels, both directionally-challenged newbies and challenge-seeking veterans should be able to find some enjoyment here. The upgrade system offers a nice bit of flexibility to your playstyle and nicely rewards those with a keen eye for secrets. My only criticisms are that I found most of the boss fights to be somewhat underwhelming, and that some players might find the lack of mission variety to grow a bit repetitive by the end.

[h1]Challenge Mode[/h1]
Challenge Mode pits you into an arena with endlessly spawning bots, with two seperate sub-modes: Countdown (Get as many kills as possible in a 5-minute time limit) and Infinite (Survive as long as possible, getting as many kills as you can before being taken down). The item and enemy spawns are randomized on every playthrough to ensure that no two plays are the exact same. While this does keep the mode from getting stale, it is a bit of a double-edged sword for anyone looking to place high on the in-game leaderboards. Ranking up in that regard can often feel somewhat dependent upon randomly rolling a favorable intersection of high-value targets and strong powerup pickups. If you're not too worried about chasing leaderboards, though (or even if you are!), there's still quite a lot of fun to be had here once you've finished up the campaign.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
Multiplayer is, much like the single player campaign, all about straightforward, no-nonsense action. Rules are simple - blow up the other guys, but don't get blown up yourself. First, the bad news - the multiplayer experience is currently considerably restrictive and laden with flaws. Long wait times, finnicky ranking system, squirelly lag compensation, lack of a server browser, and very limited number of servers all mean that getting a balanced match without frustrating hit-registration problems is unfortunately not something you can expect to get consistently. There's also a distinct lack of multiplayer co-op options available for the campaign and challenge modes.

The good news, though, is that the developers have stated that they are aware of these issues, and are looking to make improvements here one of their next focuses once the console versions are completed. Here's hoping we see improvements in the future.



Overload is absolutely worth picking up if you're a fan of shooters, especially 6dof shooters like the classic Descent - but only if you're looking for a solid single player experience. If you're looking for a good multiplayer experience, I'd probably recommend holding out for a bit until after the console versions release.",1532536939,1532536974,True,5,0,0.582580387592315674,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As a whole, the game is incredibly well designed. It looks and feels incredibly satisfying to play. The ship handles most similarly to the Descent 3 ships, in that it moves fast and has a fast turn rate, but I actually think this suits the more modern style and the Unity engine the game runs on. The graphics are simply lovely. The levels themselves are fairly minimalistic but they look gorgeous, leaving very little to be desired in the graphics department. Particularly impressive is the attention to detail with lighting; the dynamic lighting from weapons and effects is simply wonderful and the game makes heavy usage of dynamic lighting from the map's own lights, which also do a great job of looking pretty while guiding the player and serving their utility purpose. Perhaps my only criticism of the base game as a whole is that I think performance is a little poorer than one might expect, but that may just be an unavoidable byproduct of the many high-resolution textures and intense usage of dynamic lighting. The game also has a great UI and the options menu has all the settings and features you'd expect from a proper PC title. I had no complaints.

The singleplayer is an all around excellent product. It achieves a perfect blend of that satisfying old school core gameplay loop of: kill bots, find keys, rescue hostages, kill reactor, escape via exit exit, with some more modern shooter elements, such as: weapon upgrades, audio logs, story snippets, etc. Because of this it feels fresh, while also familiar and fun. The story is immersive and enticing and unfolds at a perfect pace; but it is also entirely ignorable if that sort of thing is not your cup of tea. The weapons are well balanced, numerous, and satisfying to use and experiment with. The levels are very well designed and nicely varied - I never really felt fatigue or repetition while playing it. The bots have a lot of personality and are varied, reasonably intelligent, and fun to fight. I've played through the singleplayer campaign 3 times now and I still enjoy it, finding new things every time. There's an excellent New Game+ mode too, as well as speedrunning and % completion options too, so there's something for every level of player.

The multiplayer is also great, but leaves a fair bit to be desired. I'm a veteran of Descent 1 and 2 multiplayer, having played them over Kali for more than 10 years now. I think the core gameplay loop of Overload's multiplayer is solid: the weapons are mostly well balanced and the ships feel responsive and fast, and the game plays like Descent really should. It's a more modern Descent. I think some of the weapons may have some balancing issues; in particular I think the Driller and Flak are a little too overpowered for what their purposes are intended to be, but it isn't anything that couldn't be solved in a quick patch. I quite like the loadout, perks and XP progression system that is in play; again, it's a nice little modern element that doesn't carry too much weight. It entices you to play a bit more and unlock stuff but none of it is massively impactful so you never feel like you are at a huge disadvantage if you don't have the higher level stuff. The level selection is also pretty great; I don't feel like many of the maps are instant classics like everyone's favourite MP maps from Descents 1 and 2, but what's there at the moment certainly does the job well. There are no maps that I dislike or felt bad to play.

The areas in multiplayer that I feel are slightly lacking are the features. Multiplayer was never intended to be included with the base game, so while it's a lovely bonus for players that is still totally worth playing, it still shows that it was somewhat of an afterthought. There's no variety in gametypes (deathmatch only), searching for matches can be a bit of a crapshoot (the MP population is somewhat hidden so you never know if there are actually others playing or not), the ranking system is neat but rather obfuscated, and there's no option to easily play with friends outside of a private server. I think there's a lot that Revival can do to beef up the multiplayer and make it a really solid part of the game, and I hope they will do so in a future update. I know the passion and the desire to improve the game is there, so here's hoping!

Overall, Overload is a fantastic game and a worthy successor to Descent. This is an old school game revived and done right. You should play it!",1532431620,1532431620,True,4,0,0.587500035762786865,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So my review is from the perspective of a newcomer to the series and to the 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) gameplay. Overload is a zero-gravitry, bullet-hell, close quarters FPS that feels like classic DOOM, but with space ships and modern graphics. It's fun, challenging, well-priced, and I will say it again: DOOM IN SPACESHIPS!

In fact, the call back to classic games is done better here than in modern DOOM. Levels are confusing nonlinear complexes with A LOT of secrets hidden in each level. There are no meaningless collectables, just powerups, weapons, story logs, and upgrade points to spend between levels. This encourages and rewards exploration.
You can save anytime you want but there are no checkpoints. Difficulty can quickly range from easy to nigh impossible. And the overall music and aesthetics harken to Reto Arcades. Some critics say that because of these things the game feels dated, but I prefer the term: Authentic.

Multiplayers! You either become good at this game or get destroyed by 6DOF Veterens. Also, as of writing this review the game is sadly under appriciated and has not gotten enough attention, so the player base is small. Challenge Mode is just that, fun survival or timed challenge levels that you can use to compete with freinds or Steam Leaderboards.

In short, this game is a wonderful FPS gem that newcommers can get into and enjoy without even knowing what Descent or 6DOF is. More people should be playing this game, and praisng the developers for a solid job well done! Bang for your buck, best $30 I've spent in a while.",1532286825,1532286825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overload brings back the six degrees of movement tunnel games like Descent 1/2/3 and Forsaken. However, the development team went far beyond just the nostalgia of the past, they created a game that represents a near perfect 6DOF game. Through out the development, the dev team listened closely to the community and kickstarter donaters to create a game that shows how much passion the dev team has for this game. I believe you will be hard pressed to find another title that has this much direct support and community. While many dev teams disappear after release, you can still find the dev team actively interacting with the community through their discord channel, forums and weekly streams on twitch. The devs also run weekly challenges that will keep you engaged well beyond the standard play through.

The gameplay in Overload is amazing and whether you play on a gamepad, joystick or mouse you will find highly customizable settings that will allow you to find your perfect playstyle. This is especially true for mouse players, something D1/D2 did very poorly. So if you were a previous Descent player that used a Joystick, you might find you can easily play with a mouse and keyboard combo.

In the previous 6DOF freedom games you only had the ability to play either the single player mode of multiplayer modes, Overload introduces a new mode called Challenge Mode. In Challenge Mode you will be put against an ever increasingly difficult set of bots. The more bots you kill, the number of  bots increase and the harder they get. During the run, every so often super bots will spawn as your  number of kills increases. You will also be awarded weapon upgrades to ensure you can keep up with the ever increasing horde of bots You can play in either infinite mode, where you play until you die or timed mode, which challenges you to kill as many bots as possible in a set time limit. Challege mode also requires you to pay attention to your ammunition levels and make every shot count. If you don't you will be frantically flying around with no way to kill the bots. Leader boards are present for all levels and difficulties so you can let the world see just how good you are. Challange mode is also a great way to hone your flying skills in preparation for multiplayer madness.

Another new feature is the ability to customize your ship. Instead of being forced to find upgraded weapons, you can now select any weapon and missile setup, with the exception of the rare super weapons that spawn randomly during gameplay. You can also select ship perks that allow you to modify several aspects of your ship to further improve your flying style. While these customizations might make you think there is a perfect setup, I guarantee you they don't, The dev team really spent a lot of time balancing the weapon sets to ensure there is no one setup. This is especially fun for multiplayer where you can select two different ship setups that will ensure you have the right weapon types for the varied levels. Gone are the days of starting with a weak old pea shooter and frantically running around looking for a weapong upgrade. Instead, you are immediately a threat as soon as you spawn. This keeps the multiplayer games fun and furious.

Multiplayer offers three different modes. Anarchy, all against all. team mode and 1v1 . You can either queue for a game or setup a private passworded session so you can always team up with your friends. The private sessions are especially fun because it allows you to customize almost every features of the game. This includes changing the win conditions, levels, weapons and several other items. Multiplayer also supports optional setting for cross platform play. This provides a larger number of players to keep the action going. The level design are some of the best maps I have ever seen for this style of game. The will have you changing your ship loadouts to be effective in the session. Since you can pick two different loadouts, you will always have the right setup for the map type. You are also able to change from each setup during the gameplay so you will always be prepared. Overload also released a map editor which will ever increase the number of levels to play on. Revial Productions has published tutorials on how to use the tools so it is easy to get started.

Like most modern games Overload uses a queuing system to search for a session. While you can still ensure play with your friends using the private game setting, the regular queue requires you to wait for other players to join the queue. This means if no players are online, you will be stuck staring at a search screen until someone else joins in. There is no way to see how many people are currently online so you could be staring at the search screen for a long time. You can use the discord channel to try and find folks to play with, but this requires you to install another application to find a game and relies on other players to do the same. You are also unable to select the region you are playing in which can heavily impact your ping times. This dramatically changes your gameplay experience and can often leave you frustrated. Another area missing is the ability to join games currently in session, or immediately restart a session once the session timer expires forcing you to rejoin the queue. Since the queue has a session timer you may be stuck with only 1 other player. Ypu can host your own server, but this option is only available for local LAN play. This concerns me because this service requires Revival Productions to pay for the hosting, and without continual passive income, online play will go away. It is however important to note that the inital Kickstarter campaign did not include multiplayer as a feature. The dev team really pushed hard to get this feature in and shows just how much they love this game and their commitment to the community. The dev team is also actively engaged with the community to improve the online play so some of the issues may be resolved in the future.

To sum it up, I love this game and encourage you to try it. The graphics are amazing, the maps are varied and you can also play in VR mode giving you a whole new immersive experience. Former Descent players I promise you will feel right at home and be dog fighting in some of the best levels I have played. if you have never played a 6DOF game, I encourage you to the best game I have played in the 6DOF genre. With the release of the level editor, you are also ensured to have new caverns to explore that will keep the gameplay fresh.

Naturally, it was EXACTLY what I was looking for, and holy crap it has a VR mode! YES, YES, YES, YES PLEASE!

Now that I have a consumer VR setup (and only 20 YEARS after getting a 5 minute taste of VR during a birthday visit to a nearby science center!), this is a dream come true.

I got just a little bit motion sick after playing it in VR mode the first time, but my brain got used to it much faster than I expected. By the second time I played in VR (the next day), I had no issues other than a little bit of eye strain because I played waaaay too long.

I tried the Demo and absolutely loved it. Finally decided to pull the trigger on buying the game with the 20% discount and wow this is probably the most exciting space shooter out there. If you don't know what Six Degrees of Freedom means, there's no reason to Google it, because I'll just tell you. It means on top of being able to move up, down, forward, & backward; you can also pitch, yaw, and roll. Okay, now Google pitch, yaw & roll ;)

After playing this game for a while, you won't know which way is up or down or left or right (although I cheat and look down at my hand ... my strong hand). I definitely recommend playing this game on normal. Just save often but not often as in when you're you have a warning sign that your shields are low. Often as is when you did good and your shields are good. So for a total noob like me, that means save after clearing every room. If you do bad, don't save. Die. Then do good, and save. Go to the next room. Rinse and repeat. Quicksave is your friend.

Lots of powerups to pickup. Weapons & Shields. Definitely need to find the shield potions or whatever they are. They are lifesavers. Enemies get progressively harder. You get used to what enemy ships do what. Some are fast, some take lots of damage, some throw like bullet landmines that you have to get out of the way or you will get rocked. Others shoot fast. You learn to know your surroundings. Nothing like backing yourself into a corner so your enemy can easily shoot you. Don't do that. At least don't do that more than a few times like I have done. In case you haven't figured it out, I have died a lot in this game. 

It's like close-quarters combat Doom in a space ship flying through clausterphobic corridors with secret doors with treasure (usually missiles/bombs) or enemies that will kill you fast all over the place! Anyways, this game is amazing in VR. One of the best. I just feel sorry for all people playing this game Non-VR, they don't know what they're missing. Then again, I guess that's good for them. Better to not know what you're missing out on if what you're missing out on is absolutely fantastic.

Overload is the spiritual defacto scuccessor to the old classic games. and O.M.G, the feels, the bots, the sound of locked doors, the weapons, the (pyro?) ship: behave and sound the same but still have an upgraded feel to it, worthy of the modern era we live in.

The way the levels are made, sometimes - symmetric, sometimes chaotic - gives me exactly that feeling as if I'm playing an old descent game. And I meaan we go way back , to descent 1 and 2. It really feels like these games have gotten a modern update with this game, even if there's no general Dravis or material defender, it's another time in the fictional universe but it's a ""sister game"". There ARE referrences made to PTMC tho! 

When I play this game it is although I live in a suspension of time and had a modern computer in 1996. levels look like 2018 graphic technology, with a robust engine that allowed the devs to create a classic feeling of descent gameplay that ""ticks"" these old nostalgic glands as you spin out of control through the depth of the new mines, and ofcourse combat a newly created virus that make the bots go out of control and attack everyone in sight.

your lasers shoot and ricochet of everything, the guided missiles poor out of your ship and it's all mayhem and so familiar, yet upgraded for current gen. The gameplay experience is excellently updated as well. It's still Descent but somehow it is although you are playing it with a golden joystick. Smoothly interpolated and you can even design your own independent axis of control! 

You're dealing with waves of bots that act in a specific ways, either in your face bots, flanking bots and also cowardice bots. And after the hard work to get rid of waves of enemies, from moment to moment I stop to enjoy the current gen lighting too, still with my mind in 1996. When deep in a base I suddenly notice that a backlit grate or ventilation system casting an eerie shadow. If you have so much love for the old games it almost feels romantic to experience this, ""wow, now we have a descent with great atmospheric shadows too!

In so many ways, this is the perfect successor to Descent and is very inteligently designed; however simple and elegant.
  But I also cannot help but mention that a bigger overall opportunity was missed. Overload could be a Doom 2016-like revival of the concept. Overload takes Descent's concept so it could do what Doom did to Doom, to Descent. 
  Overload has a perfect story basis for a ""Heart of Darkness-Apocalypse now in the future"" type, basic story that won't get in the way too much. Mad men turns his armies on his own people. One guy has to go deep into his land and solve the problem. This could be Overload's answer to Doom's -evil or incompetent scientists open a portal to hell while doing research on Mars, one marine overcomes and becomes a mythical figure- could be that drama. Descent had some short but effective ""mysterious dark dystopian corporation"" cutscenes with depressing music that rocked. That style could be an inspiration.  More environmental hazards and puzzles like Descent 3 could be used -along with more environmental detail and variation obviously- and you have got a revial like Doom did. They probably just wouldn't be able to gather that kind of budget. All the best of luck for future games from their new company.

Sadly, I missed the Kickstarter campaign, so I'll just say thanks to everyone who contributed to help make this happen. The devs did a fantastic job, and it's evident how much care and attention went into the project.

There's not much I can add to the many other reviews, so I'll just mention a couple things that stood out for me.

The single-player level design is great, with interesting architecture and geometry and many large, complex, and nonlinear levels.

I also have to mention the sound design, which is top-notch. So many cool sounds - everything from the bot sounds, to the 'spang' of bouncing off a force field. (I'll admit I would occasionally run into things just for the sound effects...)

The graphics are quite pretty and have a pleasant aesthetic, the movement feels very, very rewarding and has a great sense of speed and momentum when you boost down a hall, then duck into a side passage or down a shaft. Mouselook is very well implemented and has no real hard turning cap.

Combat feels great as all weapons and missiles have good audio and visual feedback. You can feel the force of impact and it just feels good.

The levels are spacious and well designed, you would sometimes get a little lost but it's nothing too horrible and you have a holo bot to guide you to your next objective, if you need it.

Multiplayer works surprisingly well. The community is tight but you can always count on the matchmaking finding you an opponent, even if it's just you two queueing, which is great. The multi maps are fun and varied in size and style.

Gli stessi ragazzi di Parallax quindi decidono di lanciare una campagna crowdfunding nel 2016 proponendo un seguito spirituale della loro storica saga videoludica ed aprendo un nuovo studio sotto il nome di Revival Productions. Evidentemente il ricordo della prima volta in cui uno  sparatutto restituiva la totale libert√† di movimento era ancora vivo in chi ha vissuto l‚Äôepoca dei 386 e la campagna si √® chiusa con successo. Esce quindi il 31 Maggio Overload, un copia-incolla dichiarato di Descent e i suoi seguiti, ovviamente modernizzato dal punto di vista tecnico e con il supporto alla VR.

Come nel titolo originale, in Overload avremo la possibilit√† di affrontare una campagna dalla durata pi√π che discreta attraverso una serie di livelli labirintici che ci chiederanno di distruggere dei reattori, cercare delle chiavi colorate e ripulire le aree dai nemici. Ogni tanto spunter√† fuori qualche boss, ma il cuore dell‚Äôesperienza sar√† fondamentalmente quello di uno sparatutto doomlike. Ci√≤ che rende grande il gameplay di Overload √® per l‚Äôappunto la completa libert√† di movimento data al giocatore all‚Äôinterno della sua navicella. Attraverso il pad o con l‚Äôaccoppiata mouse e tastiera (i motion controller non sono supportati) potremo quindi muovere la navicella a destra e a sinistra, in alto e in basso, avanti e indietro e ruotarla a nostro piacimento. Il layout base del pad risulta in fin dei conti abbastanza intuitivo, nonostante il primo approccio possa spaventare a causa del numero elevato di tasti da utilizzare e le varie combinazioni. Nel giro di un‚Äôoretta staremo tuttavia sfrecciando a tutta velocit√† attraverso stretti corridoi pieni di nemici mentre spariamo all‚Äôimpazzata e ruotiamo costantemente in tutte le direzioni senza problemi di comprensione. L‚Äôesperienza, dal punto di vista del puro gameplay, √® davvero solida e divertente e non mancher√† di regalare momenti ricchi di adrenalina e tensione.

The game play demands that you keep your head on a swivel. With enemies popping out of hidden areas or swarming you at an objective. I have met up with a few right around a corner, which takes from zero to fight immediately. 

The game offers single player modes where you can alter the difficulty while you adjust to flying. It has a brutal multiplayer experience with new and a few hardened Pilots from Descent. Although a veteran pilot, I still get my butt handed to me. You can use joysticks or keyboard + mouse.

My favorite part is the creative side where folks can create Challenge mode, missions, and soon multiplayer levels. This is all done through a seperate editor released by the Overload team. I am so happy to see the creative side again that I am in the process of resurrecting a retro styled version of my site www.GameEdit.Net that hosts game editing tutorials.    

The team at Revival Productions are still actively working on adding more to the game. I hope they do another Kickstarter campaign for what comes next, because we need to keep that team together! They are very involved with the community, which shows their commitment to their product and the fans. Although I am not a pro, I have interacted with a few studio teams in the past when hosting tutorials for their games, it was like pulling teeth with most of them. This team seems to love the game and appreciate their audience!  

Check out the conversations on Discord or to a lesser degree on their forums, and currently every Saturday on Twitch for an interactive chill session. They also have a youtube channel that posts content weekly.

I've been a lifelong fan of Descent and 6dof and to put it simply, Overload is the best 6dof game I have ever played.

The good parts: pretty much everything related to the gameplay itself.

- The flight is outstanding. I play with 2 joysticks (Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro) and the feel of moving around in the game is perfect. This is the most crucial part of any 6dof game for me and Overload nails it. Flight is fast and responsive (especially with tri-chording mode selected). Every little detail of inertia makes you feel like you are flying a spaceship!

- The visual design is striking. It might be minimalist but everything from the robots, to the weapons, to the world you fly in has personality. The lighting is incredible and the VFX fit perfectly into the experience to increase your immersion without making it hard to see what's going on.

- Overload's sound perfectly matches the game. The weapons sound powerful, the robots are terrifying, and the music is phenomenal! I highly recommend getting the soundtrack if you like Industrial/Electronic music.

- Enemy AI does a great job of both making the robots feel like characters and providing a serious challenge. There are 6 difficulty levels and the difference from one to the next is incredible. The increased difficulty is provided by smarter, faster enemies rather than simply giving the bots more hitpoints.

-Your arsenal of 16 weapons is very satisfying. Each of them has their own role in the game and provide very different ways of handling situations.

- The level design makes good use of those extra degrees of freedom. Levels include a lot of vertical elements and get pretty complex and fun to explore.

- The story of the game is interesting, and it's fun hunting down audio recordings left behind by survivors to hear more about the events that left the levels in their current sorry state.

- Challenge Mode is a fun diversion and may end up being where I spend most of my game time. This is a survival mode where you fight off bots in compact arenas until they overwhelm you. This mode features online leaderboards.

- Overload includes a level editor. I have only scratched the surface with it but I get the sense that it is very powerful. In fact it is the tool that the developers themselves created to build the game. There is a large community of people who made custom levels for Descent (100s over the years) and many of these people are already learning Overload's editor. With them on board I wouldn't be surprised to see a steady stream of custom content to play. At the moment the best place to find Custom levels is Overload's Discord Channel.

The less good parts:

-The story could be better supported by the level design and objectives. Overload's story is interesting and well written/acted but the campaign levels (the maps themselves) don't help to tell it. Each is good from a gameplay perspective but they feel like a series of semi-random labyrinths which were built for no particular reason. If not for the pre-mission briefings and the audio logs you find in the game there would be no way to tell what kind of facility you were exploring. Similarly, having things to accomplish in the levels other than ""get to the end"" could have made you feel more connected to the story.

-The Multiplayer is pretty limited and features no modes other than 3 variations of deathmatch. It also has a very small collection of maps. Finding other players can be challenging unless you go to Discord and ask people if they want to join you. This is likely to be improved however, and eventually the level editor will support multiplayer maps. More maps will add a lot to the experience, and being able to create your own arenas to play in should be really fun. Also, as with most games, more players will make the biggest difference.

- There is no co-op. This is something I miss since it would be really fun to play the levels with a teammate or devise team strategies for surviving longer in Challenge Mode.

Overall, Overload is probably my favorite game I have ever played. It has a few shortcomings but the gameplay is so good, the enemies so smart, the weapons so satisfying, as to make me want to spend countless hours flying through claustrophobic tunnels hunting down or running from the robots that lurk there!",1530244723,1530244723,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Stellar large non-linear secret-laden level design, weapon variety balance, incredibly intuitive and customizable controls, intelligent enemy behavior and enemy variety come together to form a pure and action-fueled experience with no bullshit or long boring corridors between each fight.

Overload is not 'just' a Descent clone, it is also a refinement in many ways that makes it the ultimate 6DoF game. It's way more fair in how health items are placed, hitscan enemies are used tastefully, the Thief-Bot, Class 1 Driller or Red Hulk is no more in Overload, the difficulty overall is more balanced, robot generators are destroyable, and reactor rooms can no longer be cheesed. Even on the higher difficulties you can just dogfight enemies in a fun way rather than having to hide behind corners and take potshots so you don't die. The new Smash Attack, where you ram into enemies directly with your ship, even recovers a bit of health so you can get more aggressive. 

It features an upgrade system, but unlike other games where you end up with every upgrade in the game towards the end, here you need to make a permanent decision between two upgrade branches for each weapon, each of which augments the weapon in a different way, but you can't have both. Kind of like augs in the original Deus Ex. This way you actually have to weigh your options and decide which one suits you the best, giving you more replay value for future playthroughs if you want to try something different, as opposed to providing you with an illusion of choice where you'll get everything eventually, and the only choice there is is what upgrade you want first. Upgrade points are mostly found through secrets, so you really want to explore as much as you can.

There is an actual story this time around, mostly told by intro briefings and finding audio logs scattered around the levels, but the logs themselves are very short so they don't get too intrusive, and the story never forces you through unskippable cutscenes or forced walking(/flying?) sections where you can't do anything. You can pretty much disable it all in the options menu.

It features a functional multiplayer mode which usually has about 10 or 20 people playing it as of writing, but don't really expect it to get really populated outside of finding matches on the Discord. Do expect that you will get your ass kicked by Descent veterans who have been playing its multiplayer for over 20 years. 

The passage of time has allowed Overload to improve its visuals over Descent in many ways. Bots explode in chunky debris and hellfire. Kill an enemy by ramming into him and his corpse is sent flying across the map. Dynamic lighting makes the dark cavern areas much more tense to fight in. Robot eyes flicker when they take damage, and they light up to indicate more strongly they're being damaged. The particle effects enemies like the Shredder give off makes them even more menacing. The only unfortunate part is that the texturing and the colors used for the levels themselves makes them stand out much less from eachother.

Even though this game runs on the Unity Engine, it is remarkably well optimized, and save for certain shaders I experienced next to no framedrops on a medium system.

If you call yourself an FPS fan and are also anticipating the full release of other old-school FPS throwbacks such as DUSK, Ion Maiden and Amid Evil, do yourself a favor and get Overload. If you completed the game once, you can try it again on New Game+ with revamped enemies where late-game enemies appear much earlier on to shake things up.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+Classic non-linear exploration-heavy level design in the vein of games like Descent and Doom
+Controls are incredibly smooth and customizable, supports several flightstick setups
+Enemy AI is actually responsive, and some enemies have uniquely different behaviors (they can even respond to your headlights)
+The lighting, enemy designs and explosion effects look really good
+Tons of unique and properly balanced weapons to mess around
+No Thief-Bot
+Destroyable robot generators
+Non-intrusive story
+More fair this time around, but can be still very challenging on higher difficulties
+Upgrade system actually adds to the game and is also decently balanced
+New Game+ adds another playthrough worth of replay value
+Challenge Mode and Multiplayer for the competitively-oriented players
+released Level Editor means many more custom missions are to come
+Excellent soundtrack by former Descent musicians

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-The game's too lenient with Driller ammo
-The boss fights are lame and can be powered through rather easily
-Ship upgrades could also feature branching upgrades
-Some newer 'stronger' enemy variants towards the end are paradoxically easier to fight
-Starting with loadouts for multiplayer is decline
-Having permanent Challenge Mode upgrades be locked away until you play the game itself long enough is cheap

- The level design: If you could add some even bigger maps like those on Descent 3 that would be perfection, but besides that.... nice ideas, specially the end levels.
- The AI... woow.... robots run away and sometimes to ambush you gathering others, avoided creepers, surprised me many times...amazing... I'm going for the NewGame+ to see what else I could find
- Bosses !! Probably I could ask even more but I enjoyed the ones that are here....
- The secrets sub game : This is related also to the level design.... I enjoyed it a lot. And I liked to see that is balanced, some are easier and some require to think other clues.
- upgrades: You nailed it!! One of the best features in the game, I absolutely loved it, please if you can add one more level for an expansion I'll buy it !!
- The robots: I loved the variety, the Ai, the weapons and auto op situations.
- VIRTUAL REALITY ---> You can do a perfect circular strafe while side looking. And I swear I was moving my head as a reaction avoiding shots, or looking quickly to the sides up and down when I'm about to enter a suspicious hall.  Incredible.. .. guys... is a gamer's dream.

My only complain is... I WANT MORE.

Thank you!!

What a shame that I cannot enjoy Multiplayer action, I have too much lag to play correctly against those servers (can you improve this to South America Players?)

UPDATE: DLC is amazing too. Great level selection because they change the previous level design that was already great but this time the levels are very different ideas, first ones are shorter but have some nasty surprises, the others are some medium and very very large ones and you cannot use your holo guidebot on some so be prepared for a new level of challenge. 

Another hit, seriosuly good with new enemies that have some devilish AI.

- Gameplay

Overload spielt sich genauso fl√ºssig und dynamisch wie sein spiritueller Vorg√§nger. Es f√ºhlt sich einfach [i]richtig[/i] an und macht wahnsinnig viel Spa√ü. Unterst√ºtzt wird dieses Gef√ºhl von einem bombastischen Soundtrack und den wuchtigen Waffensounds, die ein gro√ües Plus zur Atmosph√§re sind. F√ºr jeden Descent-Fan ist das Spiel uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen.

Trotzdem gibt es eine Schattenseite in Form eines lieblosen Designs. Das Spiel ist in etwa so fantasievoll gestaltet wie sein Logo: Es ist funktional, bietet aber auch nicht viel, woran das Auge h√§ngen bleiben kann. W√§hrend Descent 2 noch mit beeindruckenden Kavernen, Wasserf√§llen und Eisplaneten aufgewartet hat, sieht in Overload einfach ein Minenschacht aus wie der n√§chste. Das ist nicht nur √∂de, sondern erschwert auch die Orientierung ungemein. Bei den Anflugsequenzen, mit welchen neue Levels eingeleitet werden w√ºrde ich sogar soweit gehen zu sagen, dass es schlichtweg peinlich ist, was die Entwickler da abgeliefert haben. Ein kastenf√∂rmiges Schiff auf eine unf√∂rmige Weltraumkartoffel zufliegen zu lassen h√§tte man sich auch sparen k√∂nnen.

Trotzdem: Auch wenn es Abz√ºge in der B-Note gibt ist Overload ein ungemein spa√üiges Game und ich hoffe, dass die Einnahmen ausreichen, um bei einer eventuellen Fortsetzung mehr Augenmerk auf das Design zu legen.",1529752831,1529752831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are so many thoughtful design improvements over the original games that fans of Descent will welcome, such as the ability to destroy enemy spawners, and much thought given to the balance of the new weapon set. You'll quickly find ideal situations for weapons, and the upgrades will satisfy all your immediate thoughts of ""This weapon would be so much more useful if...""

Newcomers who haven't played Descent may find the controls awkward at first, due to the uncommon nature of moving in all 3 dimensions and the fact that you are steering a ship rather than aiming a gun, but the game feels just as at home with a mouse as it does with a joystick, due to increased max turn speeds compared to Descent (yet the ability to limit it to feel more like it). So, the barrier for adjustment is not high.

Levels feel most like Descent 2, with more open rooms and not just cramped tunnels. Cool VR support is a nice bonus to the game, looking around the cockpit looks like a blast, though I do not have a VR headset myself to know...

The only real complaints I have are that the enemy AI feels much more simplistic compared to Descent, enemies tend to only move towards you and shoot, only sometimes dodging or retreating. However, the game is challenging enough regardless due to the level design and enemy placement that maybe it's a good thing that enemies aren't smarter. Additionally the explosion effects are a bit overdone for my tastes, a single enemy exploding will shower the room with sparks and smoke and completely obscure anything behind it (from more enemies to incoming rockets) for several seconds.

Whether you're a Descent fan or a new player looking for something fresh in the world of shooters, this is a quality video game in the year 2018 that you will smile at.

EDIT: Further into the game I am finding even my complaint about AI is unwarranted; later robots are much more keen on dodging attacks and retreating to find ambush positions.

Well ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to report that Overload never got the memo.

Made by the creators of Descent, Overload is everything a fan could possibly hope for from a spiritual successor.¬† It sports prettier graphics and a larger feature set while retaining everything that made the original game so special.¬† The levels are still as large and complex as ever, weapons and enemies still come in great varieties, and yes, you still have to destroy reactors and run like hell before the whole place explodes.

If you've never before played Descent or any other six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) shooter, you're in for a trip.¬† The 6DoF movement system means you can fly in literally every direction and even roll your ship.¬† Although this can be quite disorienting and even nauseating (especially at first), it also gives you an unprecedented amount of control compared to traditional ""grounded"" first-person shooters.¬† It makes combat more exciting, too, since threats can come from any angle and you aren't just limited to strafing left and right in order to avoid incoming fire.

Overload's campaign is broken up into 15 levels, three of which feature boss battles.¬† Although that might not sound like a large number, the sheer size of these levels means you'll be spending up to half an hour or more on each one.¬† The levels are so complex, in fact, the developers not only included a full-fledged 3D automap but even implemented a ""hologuide"" that can be deployed at any time to lead you to the nearest powerup, security key, or even enemy.¬† Best of all, the levels all play out without any interruptions.¬† There aren't any cutscenes whatsoever--only collectible audio logs--and even the pre-mission briefings can be skipped in an instant.

Perhaps the biggest change coming from Descent is the addition of an upgrade system which allows you to improve and modify both your ship and weapons over the course of the campaign.¬† Some examples are the ability to make Missile Pods seek nearby enemies and a big boost to ""smash"" damage so that you can turn your ship into a powerful battering ram if the need ever arises.¬† It's worth noting, however, that upgrade points can only be acquired by finding and collecting them, therefore it's strongly encouraged that you explore to your heart's content if you wish to be at your very best going into each new level.

In addition to the campaign, there's also a challenge mode (Overload's take on horde mode) as well as local/online multiplayer.¬† As someone who's never been a huge fan of multiplayer in these types of games, challenge mode is my personal favorite.¬† The goal is simple: survive for as long as possible against killer robots that constantly spawn in all around you.¬† There are 12 arena-like stages to choose from and the more you play, the more XP you earn and the more persistent perks you unlock.¬† It's admittedly simple, but incredibly fun, highly replayable, and a great way to hone your combat skills.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of Overload aside from its oldschool nature (minimal cutscenes, maximum gameplay) is its vast array of weapons and enemies.¬† There are 16 different weapons--yes, you can have them all at once--and my favorites include the Crusher, a punishing shotgun that can be upgraded to become fully automatic, and the Devastator, a large missile that explodes into a bomb cluster to deal insane damage.¬† The enemy variety is even more impressive with over 20 different types of robots.¬† You'll encounter everything from Guardians, which pester you at long range with precision shots, to sawblade-armed Shredders that launch themselves at you arms-first with very bad intentions.

I also must bring attention to the game's excellent soundtrack.¬† The audio as a whole is great, from the weapons and explosions to the eerie, mechanical groans emitted by enemies themselves, but the soundtrack is what shines the brightest.¬† Composed by Dan Wentz,¬†Allister Brimble, and¬†Jerry Berlongieri--all of whom worked on the Descent games--Overload's soundtrack is a perfect revival of the same techno-like musical style that helped make those games so much fun to play and listen to.

Overload is one of those rare titles that, in the process of reviving a long-dead franchise, somehow manages to hit all the right notes.¬† Even the graphics are surprisingly good, with excellent lighting effects and awesome, over-the-top explosions.¬† The only complaint I can muster up is that I would've liked to have seen a greater variety of levels and locales, but I'm sure even that will be smoothed out in time thanks to the recently released level editor.¬† Suffice it to say, if you've been longing for a new Descent or just a new oldschool first-person shooter in general, Overload is like a wish come true and you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to pass it up.",1529522032,1529617256,True,82,2,0.855355620384216309,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Only one tiny tiny disappointment: It's not like you to ever get to see it that much, but i miss the mean, ""weapons-forward"" x-wing type design of the earlier Descent ships. This one has a kind of... Star Trek shuttlecraft feel to it, which is incongrous to the deliciously powerful feel you get from the numerous weapons systems.

One tip for newcomers: don't get discouraged with the controls. I used to rock a keyboard-only setup on the original and CRUSH deathmatch. But apparently flying a 6DoF ship is NOT like riding a bike, and adding a multi-button gaming mouse to the mix... welp, you're going to hit a lot of walls and lava, and practically everything else at first, until you tweak your setup.

The are plenty of difficulty levels, and quite a bit of content with the Challenge Mode and multiplayer. If you're a fan of Descent, it's easily worth the $30, probably worth $40-50 for fans of Descent, so $30 is very fair for what it is and the quality of the game.

This makes for some amazing gameplay experiences. 

Just like it's predecessors, great care has come in the level design. Being able to spin all around can become disorienting; luckily the 3d map makes navigation much easier. In single player, as you increase difficulty levels, learning the maps and remembering enemy positions is key to surviving and doing well.

Multiplayer is excellent as well, however I feel like this game hasn't received the attention it deserves and as such, it may be difficult to find a full game of anarchy or team anarchy at times.

It's a fun throwback and I enjoyed my time with it.  However, I will say that it's faithful to Descent to the extent that it might as well just be a graphical overhaul of Descent II.  Key hunts, powerups, largely abstract level design, and enemies that feel perhaps a little too familiar.

I think the developer delivered exactly what they promised: a new Descent; but in retrospect, I'm not sure that's all I really wanted.  In truth, I'm not sure this is a style of game where there even is any room for meaningful gameplay evolution, but I would have liked to see them try.

See that ""Overwhelmingly Positive""? Those are first impressions.

It starts strong and gets deeper.

Once you learn how to enable trichording in settings, you'll be zipping and flipping through room spaces at absurd angles in order to survive two seconds and loving it. When you have enough experience to take advantage of the continually interesting and varied robot AI, single player is a charm.

If you dare, multiplayer has an incredibly high skill ceiling as well. It's brutally fast paced and requires that essentially everything be muscle memory in maneuvering and firing.

Lets start with the [b]Multiplayer first[/b].
Finding a match usually goes quite fast, max time i had to wait so far where about 5 minutes, ofc. it really depends on the time, especially during the hours where EU peeps head to bed and US peeps get home from work the multiplayer can be quite dry untill they all ate their dinner and are rdy to match up (wich is, the way live works, so not really a negative point)

The multiplayer matches themself are quite fun, i love the 1v1's since it reminds me alot of quake, ofc. the item spawns are random, but the player who keeps map control and item control (as random as they may be, this ones actually important) has the upper hand, aswell as knowing where ur enemy can come from, so skilled prefiring works just fine to get the headstart in a dodgefight.

The Anarchy matches (in other words, free for all) deliver alot of action, aswell as planning ahead, either u are that type of guy that goes straight into the action or the one that sneaks up behind of all that mess to try and snack a few kills.
And this game does contain ""assists"", so there is no real ""kill stealing"" since those ""assists"" give u points aswell (ofc. not as much as a solid kill) - this especially kept my frustration low haha :D
Same for the Team Anacrhy (TDM) , it can be really fun to play this in a 3v3 or 4v4, sticking to your teammates or spreading out to flanck the enemys.
Sadly i couldn't find any TDM without asking/gathering people in beforehand.

Next thing are the servers, there arent many available and me as EU player, i often see myself ""forced"" into USA servers, the netcode isn't too bad, but u feel the lag at around 150ms and people with 30ms ping have a clear advantage on you.
Gladly u can setup private matches, with your own set of rules and invite people to it, wich is also tons of fun.
The game does contain a matchmaking and ranking system, but as you can guess, matchmaking only works well when there are enough people playing at the same time - so it can happen, especially at those ""empty"" times ([i]see above[/i]) that a plat player gets qued up with a bronze or silver.

Time to check out the [b]Campaign[/b].
The story itself consists of Radiologs and Text, since theres quite alot of stuff going on it can take 2 playthroughs to really understand the story, since listening to those radiologs WHILE fighting a hord of bots isn't really the easiest thing to do.
But they deliver every reason to do the campaign twice because after your first runthrough u unlock the ""NewGame+"" where u keep all your upgrades and weapons from your first run through in addition to more and harder enemys, delivering you a real challenge.
The campaign itself is actually quite easy for most experienced 6dof players, it really comes down when u play it on harder difficulties - wich sure is challenging, but can sometimes just be straight out frustrating.
Keeping the difficulty high tho makes up for the repetitive objective *blowing up reactors, all day long*
Every 5 Levels u get to fight a boss, wich... sadly i found underwhelming so thats a minus from me.
The maps themself contain the well known secrets, switches, locked doors, secret levels etc. wich reward u with upgrade points wich u can invest into your ship after each level.
Now it really depends on what kind of player you are, but if u enjoy hunting secrets etc. for a 100% playthrough then this can keep u on your toes for a while.

Time for the [b]Challenge mode[/b].
This is by FAR my favorite time killer in the game, it is so much fun!
U got several maps to choose from, several difficulties and u can choose between countdown and infinity.
So why do i find it the most fun? Becouse i love to top the scores of the other pilots, especially when u can show off in their Discord :D
Infinity literally means that u try to survive a hord of bots as long as u can, the difficultie increases the longer u last.
The most fun part is countdown tho, u get 5 minutes to destroy as many bots as u can, as fast as you can and since it is only 5 minutes u start to tell yourself ""just one more run, just one more run"".

Due to the amount of configurations the [b]Options[/b] become their own part in my review!
At first it is overwhelming and superb confusing, escpeially for people who have no idea what mouse limiting does, or what tri-chord,allwas and hybrid means.
If u have problems with setting up your controls then i STRONGLY ADVICE that u head into their discord and ask the people!
It really helps out, i had my configuration set up after a few minutes and it feels spot on for m/kb.
It gives so many things u can change/tweak/play around with that u can literally set it up for dual joysticks, hotas, gamepads, probably even a steeringwheel with pedals - it's truely amazing!
You just need to take that time to set it up tho - but its worth the effort.

So all in all, the Campaign could have been a bit more - especially the bosses, but i did enjoy the extra challenge with my second and third playthrough on higher difficulties.
Aswell as gathering the achievments and finding the secrets.
So this part gets a 4/5 from me

The Multiplayer gets a 3/5 from me - it could have been more love, like a serverlist for example.
On the other hand, if the playercount rises just a bit more then i give it a 4/5 - becouse then it is garanteed to get big TDM matches up'n'going without having to gather people in discord.

Just the fact that i spend 80% of the playtime in Challenge-mode makes me give it a 5/5, it is still not boring and beating the top scores is so satisfying.

The options get a 3/5 from me, because i had my difficulties with them at first, not knowing what they exactly do - wich forced me to ask in their discord for help and advice.

All in all a 4/5 game for me :)

Ay, i hope i didn't forget anything.

Another good thing is the GuideBot. I remember the old game also had a guidebot but here its almost ready any time. if you got lost or stuck you just press ""Z"" and the bot apears and leads you to the next key or entrance. Sometime its just the small things that make good games. One last notice: for me haven't playing alot in the last years. I find it a bit to frightening, you pick up something and around the corner there are some enemies and they are very close, so that you can get the frills very quite. but its also whats makes it fun.

Ich spiele es in VR (Windows Mixed Reality via SteamVR) und es f√ºhlt sich gro√üartig an.
Das wirft direkt in die Jahre zur√ºck, als man Descent1-3 mit vollem Elan gespielt hat und sich immer vorgestellt hat wie geil es doch w√§re, wenn man wirklich im Cockpit sitzen w√ºrde.

Im Moment verwende ich zur Steuerung ein Gamepad. Das funktioniert ansich ganz ordentlich, nur komme ich damit √ºberhaupt nicht klar. Ich werde wohl also bald meinen alten Joystick wieder auspacken.

Die Grafik ist nett gemacht, wenn auch keine absolute High-End Grafik. Die Effekte der Waffen und Explosionen sehen super aus und auch die dynamische Beleuchtung sieht gut aus (wenn man sie einschaltet.. sie Ist standartm√§√üig stark reduziert).
Die Spielphysik ist realistisch und auch das Trefferfeedback wird gut dargestellt.

Thema VR:
Hier muss wohl jeder seine eigenen Erfahrungen machen. Solange ich ruhig geflogen bin war es ein tolles Erlebnis. Als ich jedoch dann angefangen habe etwas k√ºnstlerische Flugman√∂ver zu fliegen wurde mir ganz leicht flau. Ich denke mal mehr als eine Stunde am St√ºck w√ºrde ich im Moment noch nicht durchhalten. Aber das m√ºsst ihr einfach selbst probieren.

Thema Technik:
Ich wei√ü nicht, ob es nur daran liegt, dass WMR offiziell nicht unterst√ºtzt wird oder ob andere VR-Systeme noch √§hnliche Probleme haben. Im Moment ben√∂tige ich immer 2-3 Versuche, bis das Spiel in SteamVR erkannt wird und in der VR-Brille angezeigt wird. Es ist jetzt nichts was total st√∂rt, aber andere VR-Spiele sind hierbei zuverl√§ssiger.",1528622946,1528622946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's great fun and you almost get that Descent vibe while playing, but not 100%.  
I will say I'm a bit disappoined with the lack of more open spaces.  The levels almost seem the same but just layed out a bit different.  This gives the game sort of a vibe that you're on one HUGE level and never really see anything new and never seems to end.  Not that I want it to end, but would like to feel more like I am progressing than playing the same level over and over.

Still, this game is worth it if you loved any of the Descent games.  Plays awesome so far.  Ace difficulty is a bit challenging on some levels until you get a foothold and also get your playstyle  down.

Made by the original creators of the good old Descent titles from the 90's, this masterpiece (Overload) mixes all the best points and mechanics from the past games and blends it in such a masterful manner that it's a must play for every fan of the Descent games and the 6DOF genre in general.
Level design is superb, it has beautiful graphics, a not so complex but very interesting story (even if it has some clich√©s), and the action (specially on Hotshot difficulty and up) is constant and fast-paced and overall very fun to play!

-WARNING - THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AHEAD (I'm focusing on the Single Player campaign)-

[spoiler]It plays mostly as Descent 1, specially during the first 12 levels of the campaign:
it has a VERY similar atmosphere, design and gameplay (robot placement and level flow) to that of Descent 1 campaign, with just a bit of extra elements from Descent 2 (switches to unlock doors or disable forcefields) and small details from Descent 3 like accelerator tubes and small mini-generators that you have to destroy to disable forcefields.
But each one of those elements just so well balanced and placed that I consider it like the Descent of my dreams (and it has the advantage that doesn't has the features that I didn't like from Descent 3 on its time)

Of course, I'm not saying that this game is just a copy-paste of the classics made to please the old fans (like me) that just want some fanservice, it has a good deal of new features to be considered a new and different title from those of the Descent saga.

Specially from level 13 and onwards, the atmosphere and mechanics changes enough to feel separated from the original Descent games, and I applaud the developers for those new gameplay elements that feel so great when you mix them with a Descent style gameplay. The latest levels really blew my mind.

The fact that there are a couple special weapons that you only find on those levels, how you need to activate special alien 'cores' to advance through (to open doors or forcefields), how you encounter a different set of enemies from the past levels and how it's aesthetically different from the rest of the game not only makes the story develop better, but also adds something that the original Descent titles lacked or didn't implement well enough (even if Descent 3 Mercenary was [i]very[/i] close): the feeling to be very far on real alien worlds, much like on Half-Life with planet Xen.

My only complain of the game is that I don't like the design of the last boss arena on level 15, it turned the fight against the boss enemy a bit frustrating and infuriating, I had to lower the difficulty just to advance that level, but it's not a big game breaking element, fortunately. [/spoiler]

Overall, I find Overload to be a complete masterpiece of the 6DOF genre, and I put it at the same pedestal along the big ones, Descent 1,2 & 3. :)

Finally another GOOD game in this genre. I have been waiting for a Descent clone/sequel for years, and Overload is IT!

Six degrees of freedom, lots of enemies firing a plethora of projectiles at you, powerups, upgrades, confusing mazes, secrets.

Now that Overload is out, I hope Revival will start evolving the underused genre further. Get creative and inject new concepts into Overload 2 (when it happens).

My only (minor) gripe so far with Overload is the upgrade points you gather through exploration and secrets. The game doesn't tell you how many upgrade points are hidden in each level until you complete it. If you miss one, you can't go back later to look for the missing one. Well, you CAN go and replay any previous level at any time, but even if you find all upgrade points this time, it won't affect your current save. They must be collected in a linear fashion.",1528449884,1528449884,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you enjoyed Descent, you will enjoy this.  But why?  What about this game is special?

1) The Nostalgia

The moment you teleport into Ymir Outpost and start moving around, you already begin to recall the feeling of the original series.  The first secret you discover.  The first robot that pops out of a secret room after you trigger it.  The first time a Scorpion surprises you.  The first cryotubes you rescue.  The first secret level you find.  You will remember everything you loved about the original game as you get introduced to some of the new concepts that Overload brings to the table.

2) The Music

Much of the music of this game comes from Descent music legends Dan Wentz and Allistar Brimble.  You'll hear styles from Descent 1 and 2 as you play through the game.  But can we talk about Descent 3's Jerry Berlongieri and his absolutely brilliant ""Unmanned"", the soundtrack to level 14?  If there's nothing that gets me, it's music that fits what's going on.  Kantor's descent into madness is captured perfectly by this soundtrack, which starts making you, the player, start questioning reality.

3) The Story

The story starts out with you investigating various accidents that happened.  As you learn more, you start to feel that things are wrong.  This culminates in the level 15 mission briefing, AKA the ""Three Queens"" story.  Everything is PERFECT about this.  Not only does this briefing explain everything up to that point, it invokes a level of terror that you'd expect from rounding the corner into a Scorpion.  The voice acting on this part is exceptional as well, sends chills up and down the spine.

4) Challenge Modes

And after the story campaign, you can keep playing more with the addictive challenge modes.  12 maps teeming with robots for you to destroy and set high scores on the leaderboards.  Try to play as long as you can with infinite, or see how fast you can kill things on countdown mode.  It's a simple idea that players love.

While I can't help but glow about the single player experience, the multiplayer experience isn't quite as good.  This is largely because multiplayer wasn't intended to be part of the 1.0 release.  However, the team at Revival pivoted and decided to add multiplayer to this mix late.  This really shows in the disparity between in polish between single player and multiplayer.  While it might be difficult to justify criticizing the game for including something that it wasn't planning on, it is no longer Early Access, and needs to be looked at as such.

There are a number of missing features with multiplayer: co-op campaign compatibility, server browsing, joining games in progress, hosting dedicated servers, Hoard CTF & Monsterball game modes that were popular in Descent 3, and a way to observe games in progress (my #1 feature request).  It really seems like multiplayer is something that either should have delayed the release of 1.0, or should have been part of a 2.0 release several months down the line.  It is not great that multiplayer was released half-or-less-finished.

For playing multiplayer itself, you're forced into playing client-server.  There are no peer to peer options, which means that a 50ms swing in ping can be the difference between winning 9-8 and losing 11-20 against the same pilot, just because you had different pings on different servers.  The lower your ping, the more what you see is accurate, which means you get a pretty big advantage over someone who is at a higher ping.

Anarchy has a strange points system that rewards 3 points for a kill and 1 point for an ""assist"", which requires you to do a certain amount of damage right before someone else gets the kill.  I very still much believe anarchy should just be based on kills, because now you get situations where games end because someone with 18 kills and 6 assists win over someone with 19 kills and 2 assists.

Don't let this get you totally down about multiplayer.  The actual multiplayer games can be quite fun, and as long as you can deal with these nitpicks, you'll still have a good time.  No other game outside of the Descent series has a multiplayer that can even be called comparable to that series, so Overload at least has that going for them.

The other thing that Overload has going for them is their exceptional and responsive dev team (edit: See below for update).  All those multiplayer nitpicks I discussed above?  They're *working* on resolving some of them, and are very good at listening to player feedback when determining what to tackle next.  I feel confident knowing that this game will continue to evolve, especially remembering where the closed beta of multiplayer was a month prior to release, and how far it has come since.  (Spoiler alert: It was *terrible* back then.)

So if you're looking for an authentic Six Degrees of Freedom single player experience that brings the genre into modern times, I can't recommend this game enough.  It even supports both Individual Level and full game speedrunning, has a new game+ mode where the levels change up to add even more difficulty, and has a ton of replayability.  Multiplayer feels unfinished, but give it a shot, and if you're not happy with what you see yet, don't be surprised if in an update down the road you see something added that you wanted in the game.

[edit]
I wanted to edit this review because eight months on from release, and not a whole lot has changed with multiplayer.  The main nitpicks are still there.  There've been some weapon balance passes, but no major change into how multiplayer works.

What's worse is the dev team has gone silent.  I have said in a number of places that this now seems like a 2019 indie company thinking like a 1995 corporate studio.  I don't know what happened between May and now, but this no longer feels like it's going to get any major updates, and the lack of communication from the dev team on this and other major issues (XBox is *still* unreleased) is frustrating a lot of players.

I still highly recommend the crap out of this game for single player, and the DLC has extended the life of the game for sure.  However, it's a shame that the best multiplayer 6DoF game is going on 24 years old this month, and no game in 20 years has managed to even exceed Descent 3's multiplayer.
[/edit]

[edit2]
Revival Studios is no more, so no more updates will be coming for the game.  They did make a v1.1 update to allow for online play without their own servers, but the experience kind of sucks because there were no changes to the net code.  So, if you really want to play Overload multiplayer, be sure to check out my Steam guide on olmod to learn how to play multiplayer in olmod.  olmod was conceived by Arne de Bruijn, and since has been modified by no less than a dozen other developers who love this game.  It has many improvements and quality of life features that have made multiplayer an awesome experience.

It feels like jumping right back into descent except with nice modern graphics and amazing lighting and particle effects. I've been playing through on normal difficulty and just finished level 9. There are 15 or so levels in this and some are so large that they will take you a long time to get through, especially if you get lost or have trouble with some of the enemies.

As far as the map design goes they are very well done. There are many secrets to be found on every level and cool story bits that give you audio dialogue and reveal the story as you pick them up.

The control is nice and smoothe using keyboard and mouse. With 6DOF games I find a controller doesn't really work out as well but usually if you have a jotstick those seem to be alright. Keyboard and mouse though is by far the best with this title I would say. 

As far as other game modes than the campaign there are challenge mode and multiplayer. The multiplayer is alright, the levels I played seemed a little small for my tastes and I wasn't a huge fan of the level design of the multiplayer maps. They remind me of the typical arena style maps you see in FPS games a lot where every way you go has a back way and everything seems a bit too symmetrical. I prefer maps that are not the arena style, I like maps that are closer to the campaign style of maps where it's not symmetrical and there are dead ends, places to park and set traps etc. The multiplayer seems lacking on this one.

One other thing to note is that there is a level editor coming. This will add to the game with new maps being created and available by the players and that's always cool.

The music, sound effects and ambiance are fantastic and fit the levels very well. I really enjoyed the music in this.

The weapons on the ship are pretty cool and so too are the secondary weapons. Each are upgradable multiple times based on how you prefer to play and sometimes you can give them added effects too like turning dumb missles into homing or extending the life of homing mines, lots of cool stuff here. Your ship also has a headlight which slowly drains power but you also have flares that you can use and they are really cool with awesome lighting and the way the bump off the walls is so neat.

If you like 6DOF games, the old descent series or sci-fi in general this game is really good and you will probably enjoy it. A lot of work and effort went into this game and it shows, you feel it while playing. There are 4 or 5 difficulty modes, something perfect for everyone's skill level or to challenge yourself. I think the price for this is pretty fair as well. I can't wait to see what sort of maps people make when the editor releases.

VR is not required and I greatly enjoyed the game without it (not that I wouldn't try it if I had a headset).

A run of the campaign on Hotshot (medium difficulty) took me about 13 hours, and that was with a lot of secret hunting. While said secret hunting certainly helps, and some players will find a lot of fun in it, it's by no means required - you can play slowly and carefully, trying not to waste the many missiles and powerups you'll find, or you can blaze through the mines with your favorite weapons.

The demo was a big plus for me and i buyed the game.

Now the full version i notice my opion has changed. 
I played it but it didnt had that wow factor i had before. The grapics are oke but not good, even crysis 2, 6 years old? are much better. The gameplay is more about hunting for hidden secrets if you want to have succes (upgrades to your ship). 
All the decks on the level are the same so in the end you have no idea where you have been and where not. There is a map but is so badly implemented that i didnt try to look at. Also later levels are so big bigger then descents that is not helping either when they look alike. 
I liked all the descent games and played them tot death. But this game not. I really dont care avout the last level, replaying the levels gets bored. Doom and Crysis 2/3, i played 50 times again and again. Because you make progress here it i   
The game is also now $30. $20 or even $15 would be more fair, because you can finish the game in a few days.

The game is still a good game if you can but it for 15 or 20, but to me its not decent. Yes Its from some of the makers i know but not decent4.
For $30 in the state it is now, its ok but not enough ok to say thumbs up. 
I am sure the full game will get less hours from me the 5 level demo.

edit: 17.06.2018
After playing for another 20 or 30 hours i cant say it isnt worth the money anymore :-)
Played some more now, i know the best weapons and best upgrade path that works for me. I used some cheats to get all weapons and with that i enjoyed the game much more. The frustration went away. More cheats are coming i heard. But i dont think i need them anymore, maybe for some fun ater aka more super upgradepoints.
Found some more secrets and upgradepoint so i can upgrade the weapons i wanted right away (1. TB and 2. Crusher)

Also finally understand how to use the map to help me i use markers and the pointer now to guide me also i check the map many times to see where i am. helps me to rememeber the map.
 
Arent there any negatives?
1. Yes they are. The grapics are still to simple the game would look much better with more colorfull HD textures. I hope in the future.
2. Secrets can be easier found now if you listen to a special sound they say. 
That true but even with max volume i only sometimes hear them most of the time not even when i am sitting next to it. Its broken somewhere. So no real help here and if you shoot your speakers explode because the volume was on 10+ in hope that you could hear the sound a a hidden upgrade point.

So much so the controlling is amazingly similar.

However unlike the original DOS based Descent, multiplayer still leaves a lot to be desired. If you're like me, you bought it for co-op online multiplayer, but the developers couldn't be bothered to add it yet--and go so far to say it may be too complicated to implement at a later time (which is frankly not true). A basic system could be implemented that allows you to invite a friend over steam into the session.

The second problem is that if you relent and decide to do the multiplayer battles; the lobby system is a bit odd and there's no option to add any AI challengers in the mix.

All-in-all the game is great, but has so many drawbacks when it comes to multiplayer. They really should clarify that the multiplayer is crippled from the original counterparts.

Which makes sense considering it's the same guys, down to the soundtrack, which rocks.)  

To all the VR enthusiasts out there, there are several things I want to point out that will hopefully sway you to pick this one up.  

1)  It offers the option at launch to either play through the traditional PC arrangement of the monitor and whatever input device you like (HOTAS, kb/m, controller) or your preferred flavor of VR HMD.  This is fantastic because you don't have to set a launch argument, and instead can decide to play flat on a whim if you're just looking for a quick session or for whatever reason don't want to always play VR.

2) On my 1070 I can crank EVERYTHING up to max.  In addition it seems incredibly well optimized and should run fine on any rig that isn't 10 years old with a discrete GPU.  VR settings are just as forgiving, allowing me to leave them at max with no perceptible frame loss.

3) If you're not a fan of the VR cockpit (I am not) you can simply remove it.  I AM BLOWN AWAY by this option.  Allowing me to get a full view of the environment greatly enhances my immersion and allows me to not only see what's going on where normally I'd be occluded by cockpit, but it also works really well and you forget that it's not there after 30 seconds.

I cannot imagine not owning this for VR - do yourself a favor and grab it if the idea of flying a small craft in mazes and blowing up enemy robot craft all to a killer pumping soundtrack appeals to you.",1528268801,1528268801,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After playing this game for about 8 hours, I can say that it certainly scratches the Descent itch I've had for all these years.  M+KB controls are excellent, and this game is exactly what I would hope for in a modern day spritual successor to Descent II (my personal favorite in the series).

And I'm gonna try and gear this review towards not those people.  Cause it looks like the majority of these reviews are already aimed at fans of Descent so what would be the point in that, eh?

Simply put this is the best zero gravity shooter in recent years, and possibly in forever. --yes more games like it exist, but not very many, and this is absolutely the one you want to buy first.  The extra dimension of movement adds an extremely simple sort of complexity to the game -- it's surprisingly easy to pick up but still needs you to put in the work to master it.  This is the sort of game that anyone who's dreamt of flying and woken up feeling wistful about it needs to play.

Overload is a joy to control -- every movement feels responsive and all of the weapons in the game have their place in the task of destroying your robotic foes.  I would encourage new players to spend some time in the training level getting a feel for strafing up and down and rolling left and right, flying on their back -- any other sort of movement or orientation they can dream up... this sort of excersize not only helps get yourself used to the controls but will also help you navigate some of the more complex levels.

And complex some of these levels are.  The game provides you with a holographic guide robot you can activate at almost any time and will lead you from wherever you are to your next objective so you don't need to worry about getting lost if you go exploring.  The game does get punishingly hard as you get farther into it so dark souls fans should be in love. :P  Although there is no checkpoint system you can also save at almost any time.

Finally, there is a simple yet surprisingly deep plot going on as you make your way across the moons of saturn and beyond... It's presented as a sort of murder mystery and hooked me in even though I didn't think I was playing the game for its story at all.  You can tell the writer is a fan of Ender's Game and Agatha Christie since the story comes across as something like a mix of the two.  Even if you don't manage to find all the audio logs and background information you never feel lost in it, and it's remarkably well-written as well as being engaging.

So, even though the mission objectives can sometimes feel repetitive and the three bosses might be a *titch* too easy once you've wrapped your head around flying instead of walking, I still wholeheartedly, unreservedly recommend this game to anyone, not just fans of the old Descent titles.  It's an exhilarating experience that, if you've ever dreamed of flying and woken up feeling wistful, will never get old.

VERDICT: A tricky, and intense, successor to a classic first person shooter. 

This is a nice and easy review if you played Descent back in the day and loved it. The same developers, the same premise, and gameplay that's just as intense and frantic as you remember it. There's a few modest additions to the formula, which I'll cover in more depth later, but they enhance the game and I'm confident you can buy this without regret. If it has a flaw, it's that the difficulty can spike in a few places - namely the boss battles, and the area where the reactor is can be tricky to overcome. Otherwise it's pretty enjoyable, and scratches that nostalgia itch.

If you've never heard of Descent, or never got to play it way back in the 90's (?) - it's a straightforward enough game. It takes place in the future, at a time when corporations have set up mining facilities in outer space. The worker bots in these facilities have been infected with a virus that is causing them to attack people. You are the clean up crew sent in to destroy the bots, and blow up the reactor core. Once you do that you then have a limited amount of time to escape, before it all gets nuked to a crisp.

Because you are in a ship, movement is freer than 99% of FPS'. You have your strafe, but can also rotate the craft around, and move up and down as well. It might sound complicated, but it's not too tricky to get to grips with how much space you can cover, and it controls really well with a pad. I just find this control method (which obviously takes a lot of keys) to be most accommodating on a controller, and it's totally configurable too so you can do all that you want quite easily. With radial wheels for everything (two sets of weapons, and a third for a final ability), that are quickly accessed by holding the relevant button, it's really smooth to play.

Enemies can come from every angle, and due to how your weapons fire it can be advantageous to have rolled your ship around to accommodate this. Instead of strafing, which may leave one of your blasters hitting a wall as you're not far enough past it, you would want to alter the pitch of the ship and then use the vertical controls to ""drop down"" and have both weapons free to hit. It's a bit mindbending to do, but the controls are up to it, and your craft handles really well.

Whilst the level design can be a bit of a swine due to this freedom, most enemy types are actually fair in how they attack. You have fast shooting ones that do less damage, and slower ones that are more powerful, and they only really get to blast you quickly when you're gingerly creeping into an area. When you're moving faster they do take a little longer to respond. It's entirely possible to whizz in, flip the ship around, blast a few and then whizz back out. That's if you don't totally lose your cool, and your bearings, and fly smack bang into a wall....

Which, uh, I've done on more than one occasion. Then at other times I've been an exhiliratingly slick WHIRLWIND OF DEATH. It's not so much a case of when the game works, as it works very well 100% of the time, but it can be overwhelming  and the developers don't ever let you get comfortable. But that's why it's such an exciting game, as it's unpredictable - oh, and they do some stuff flike having enemies pop out of hidden panels.  Which will often cause a shock when you think you have the upper hand and one has appeared right behind you....

You have two different weapon systems: your primary is energy weapons, and the secondary is ammunition weapons. Primary weapons deplete from a pool of energy that is also shared by a third system - the light of your ship, and a probe that can guide you to ammo / energy reserves. This energy can be replenished through dropped items from enemies, and at a limited number of recharge stations. Ammunition weapons are based around supplies that are found in the environment.

There is no health recharge in this game - you only get it returned by destroying enemies, and having them drop replenishment. Combined with relatively scarce ammo it makes for satisfying risk / reward gameplay. You're low on health and ammo, but if you want more...well, you're going to have get stuck in. Them's the breaks! 

As exciting as all of this is though, it's really when you blow up the reactor that Overload (and Descent before it) gets just a  tad sweat inducing. When you've got an alarm blaring, and a timer ticking down...and you can't for the life of you remember where the exit is, and you're frantically haring toward somewhere, anywhere, in the hope of escape...and the devs have yet more bots popping out of hidden panels giving you a fright....

Make it out in time and there's a cool sequence of everything getting blown to bits behind you as your ship whizzes out. Big explosions!!! If all of that doesn't get your pulse racing then you're either dead, really boring, or harder than adamantium crossed with vibranium. 

There's a mild upgrade feature for your weapons in place, which means exploring for some hidden (and not-so-hidden) upgrade points is worth the time. It looks good, with some very funky particle effects and nice lighting. Crisp graphics, albeit not hugely detailed - at a guess I'd say this doesn't require a particularly hefty pc to run it at a very smooth framerate. Excellent music that gets you pumped for the action, great sound effects and voiceover work.

There's also a multiplayer, though I'm not really a mutliplayer kind of guy, so can't comment on the quality of that. But if it's been done with the polish of the single player, then it ought to be good. So far I've clocked up nine hours in the campaign, and according to the game blurb there's 15 levels, with my progress currently sitting at the sixth level. 

That's playing on the hotshot difficulty, which equates to medium. So, a rough guess would be that it takes about 20 hours to finish, and for the cost I'd be pretty chuffed with that. It's been bug free so far and mostly fun - with a few small exceptions that are holding back my progress (usually I'd prefer to finish a game before reviewing it). 

There are some difficulty spikes that can be annoying. I've already dropped the difficulty down one level (currently the third of five levels) and I'm still finding area's where things aren't quite right. They have a device that pumps out bots endlessly unless you can destroy it, but at times there can be too many enemies to deal with them and trying to stop more from coming. 

I just did a reactor where it had two of these devices which couldn't be destroyed as they were shielded, and ended up having to snipe the reactor from a position enemies wouldn't go to. As it was just too much to get any closer and deal with it without cheesing it. The one boss battle I've encountered so far was rather lame in design and to battle, and I ended up with no ammo just flying around in a circle shooting it (you get one energy back so you can still shoot, though it's slow to recharge).

It's a pity. It doesn't take away from the fact that 90% of the game is enjoyable, exciting, and challenging. It does mean that some of it can get a bit tedious. Most areas are quite tricky, but some are the wrong side of that. A small blemish, but it's there nonetheless.

For the price this is an almost perfect nostalgia trip if you were a fan of Descent, and a tricky and exciting game if you are new to it. It runs well, for the most part plays well, and has a decent amount of content. Add in the muliplayer, and that's great value in my book. Overload gets a thumbs up because it is fun, but there are a few bad elements bringing it down slightly. Coupled with the games intensity, and slightly bewildering scope, it may prove to be a game you finish in chunks, rather than a couple of sittings.",1528240392,1528293622,True,21,0,0.633816361427307129,5,False,True,False,False,,,

It's basically the original games' formula, revived with shinier graphics. It's got everything the original had - reactors and emergency exits, miners to rescue, secrets (sometimes inside other secrets), a 3D automap, etc. It does bring some new stuff to the table though, including being able to find and spend upgrade points to improve your ship and weapons between levels, and a New Game+ mode. Even the music was written by the sound designers of the original games and provides the perfect soundtrack for blasting robots.

These are my biggest complaints about the game right now, but keep in mind they are very minor gripes in an otherwise fantastic game and didn't ruin the experience at all.

[list]
[*] There's a major bug where doors sometimes get stuck closed after loading previous saves (possibly involving secret levels) but I expect that to be fixed in the first patch.
[*] I'm 2/3 through the campaign and the emergency exit shafts are still located pretty close to the reactors, in contrast to the original where you often found the exit halfway through the level.
[*] The automap has a fixed vertical axis that you can't rotate more than about +/- 80 degrees around, meaning the levels always have a fixed vertical axis you can orient yourself with. The originals' automap could be freely rotated in any direction without limits so the levels felt much more disorienting.
[*] There's a quicksave keybind (which you'll be using a lot, since there are no autosaves), but there is no quickload keybind, meaning you'll be spending a lot of time waiting for death animations and navigating the ""load game"" menu if you're on a higher difficulty.

Overload wird ja sehr unterschiedlich bewertet von der Spielepresse, von Gamestar 62 % bishin zu 4players 85 %, deshalb schreibe ich auch meine Meinung zu dem Spiel hier in diesem Review f√ºr Interessierte oder unschl√º√üige auf, allerdings bisher nur f√ºr den Singleplayer Teil des Spieles. Ich hoffe ich kann Euch bei Eurer Entscheidung helfen wenn Ihr unschl√ºssig seid ob Overload was f√ºr Euch ist (es gibt auch eine spielbare Demo, was nat√ºrlich noch besser ist ;-)  ).

Als ich die ersten paar Meter geflogen bin und dann auf den ersten ersten Gegner traf, hatte ich ein breites Grinsen im Gesicht... ich liebe Overcent ...√§h Descload... √§h Overload, es fliegt sich wie fr√ºher, und auch das Spielprinzp hat sich gl√ºcklicherweise nicht ge√§ndert, d.h., die Labyrinthm√§√üigen level zu durchqueren, dabei die Mission zu erf√ºllen, und so viel wie m√∂glich von den Versteckten Kammern/R√§ume/bis hin zu ganzen Arealen / Levelabschnitten zu entdecken. 

Dem jenigen dem die alten Descent Spiele gefallen haben, und auch nichts anderes erwartet, wird auch sehr wahrscheinlich mit Overload seinen Spa√ü haben.
Wer allerdings auf Inovation, oder auch eine Geschichte wie z.B. in Freelancer und Konsorten oder Open World wert legt, wird h√∂chstwahrscheinlich ent√§uscht sein und mit Overload nicht viel anfangen k√∂nnen. 

Ich finde ja das Overload ja √§hnlichkeiten mit Dark Souls hat ;-)  , wenn man bei beiden Titeln zielstrebig die Missionen  erledigt und nur dem Hauptpfad folgt, wird man einen gro√üen Teil des Levels/Spiels nicht zu Gesicht bekommen. Man mu√ü sich da schon ein wenig reinfuchsen (verbei√üen ;-)  ) wenn man alles entdecken m√∂chte.

Revival Productions LCC haben aber einiges getan um die Baker/Fans der alten Descent Spiele und neue Spieler zu erreichen, und es √ºr diese etwas leichter zu machen. So gibt es nicht nur 5 Schwierigkeitsgrade wo f√ºr jeden Skill was dabei sein sollte, sondern auch eine gut funktionierende automatische Karte (was bei 6-Achsen Spielen gar nicht so einfach ist) und als i T√ºpfelchen eine Drohne der mann ein Ziel vorgeben kann (vom n√§chsten Gegner/Munition/Energie/Reperaturgebiet/Ausgang bis hin zu den Missionszielen), und diese einem den Weg zeigt indem sie vorraus fliegt und man Ihr nur noch folgen mu√ü. Ich finde das so gut gel√∂st, die alten Hasen k√∂nnen z.B. die Drohne einfach ignorieren, und den neuen Piloten wird damit die Orientierung erleichtert.

√úber den Multiplayer kann ich allerdings noch nichts sagen, denn ich m√∂chte erst mal die Kampagne abschlie√üen.

Egal bei welchem Titel, ich w√ºnsche allen noch viel Spa√ü beim Spielen.

The single player campaign takes a sharp turn in the last third and  lots of poor game design decisions finally stack up. I didn't finish the game. Bot AI,  flying and dynamic lighting are the best parts of this game. 

[b]Botched control configuration[/b]
Let's start with the stuff that broke the game for me. Later on the game relies on armies of enemies with powerful hit scan weapons. It also forces you to use a weapon you hate. Before that you could use any weapon you like to get stuff done. You *could*  switch to your favorite weapon but bugs and dumb configuration options ruins it.

The selection wheel never matured into a usable tool because you either can't pick a diagonal item or your selection interferes with your movement. You can't assign your favorite weapon(s) either because they are paired. And finally, the slowest fall back method of previous/next selection is broken because it maps internally to ‚ÄúInvert Y‚Äù.

Edit: Clarification
This section sounds a bit silly but I fly with joystick and aim with mouse, so buttons are very limited. At this tough stage of the game I'm suddenly and needlessly forced to toggle between two select weapons very fast. Neither the games' options nor my button contingent/configuration allowed that and I never trained it. I could remap everything but at this stage I was already weary, so I decided to quit.

[b]Poor story progression[/b]
Story went from a nice start to lots of short, repetitive chatter to heavy handed crap. 

[b]Environment kills flying[/b]
The environment is heavily stylized with nice textures and a nice color palette. It's rather sterile and lifeless and there are only a few rooms that look truly exciting but I kind of liked it. But I didn't like the overall darkness.

Flying in this game is 50% of the fun. To increase the sense of orientation and movement/speed the environment needs to be visible and close by. Lots of dark areas and (later) black hole textures (the already feeble headlight becomes useless) don't make sense for this game.

[b]Explosions kill motivation[/b]
The explosions also got changed for the worse. 1. No more easily visible flashes indicating a robot death. 2. Heavily darkened debris trails leading to disconnected/confusing debris explosions. 3. Usage of cliche fire textures.

Killing robots became tame, less visually rewarding and less fun. For challenge mode it essentially removed the primary motivation (have fun playing the game) and promoted secondary motivation (play the game to be on the leader boards).

[b]Bright, ear-piercing sounds and annoying music[/b]
I actually tried to play the game without any sound, just to see if I can. It wasn't fun. I settled on -10 db treble, low effects volume and no game music. It's a pity, because I usually liked parts of each track (nice Dark Knight reference) and some sound effects but I couldn't stand the '70s bright whining lead guitars, bright mixes for '80s dull speakers and far too many noise-based, bright, digital, processed, distorted sounds.

FYI: Playing time is wrong, I played mostly without Steam.",1528108448,1528203058,False,15,4,0.525369942188262939,10,True,False,False,False,,,

This is everything I could have wanted from a modern remake of Descent. HARD, addicting and deep. This game isn't a simple nostolgia cash-in. It's a full-blown love letter to the 6 DOF genre, crafted with care. 

Like Descent 1 and 2, this game is claustrophobic and disorienting. You can never know when a robot is hiding around a corner, waiting to ambush you. 

The AI behaves intelligently, not simply flying straight at you, they will dodge your shots and missles, and some robots will retreat to get a better angle and hopefully suprise you around another corner, or play chicken behind a pillar before popping off a few shots and hiding again. The AI doesn't do the same thing each time, even when reloading from a quicksave. They will try out different tactics. It feels very dynamic.

Playing on Ace (second hardest difficulty), I had to replay some sections dozens of times, and I've only played the first few levels so far. The difficulty is insane and I love it.

This game expands on the Descent formula with an upgrade system. You find upgrade points hidden throughout the levels and use them to upgrade your weapons and abilities between missions. I like this system even better than the old way of just finding every upgrade, since you can choose what to upgrade.

If you get tired of exploring the maze-like campaign levels, you can hone your combat skills 
in Challenge mode, surviving against increasingly difficult waves of robots. There are leaderboards and you can easily see your rank after each round. You'll find youself saying ""just one more try.. I was so close to 100,000 points..""

I haven't tried the mutiplayer PVP mode yet, that's next on my list.

The game plays beautifully with a joystick, for old purists like me. The control options are extensive and will cover any setup you have. Every key can be rebound, joysticks have deadzone and sensitivity options, and you can even adjust the response curves for keyboard presses and mouse movement.

The graphics straddle a line between simplistic and realistic. Overall I think they look great, especially the particle effects. Showers of sparks and smoking bits of robots go shooting off in every direction. It's satisfying just to play the game and watch it all unfold.

I highly recommend this game to Descent fans, fans of sci-fi action games, or just fans of games that are hard, fun and replayable. It's a very addicting and well-tuned formula. There's honestly nothing about this game that I dislike.

I do have a wishlist: co-op would be amazing, to play with a friend through the campaign levels. I'd also really like to see some of the classic Descent 1 and 2 levels ported over to this game.

But at its heart, Overload really just seems to be about blowing stuff up.

It's an incredibly... well... crunchy game. A good selection of weapons, but not too many, all of which result in delightfully satisfying explosions when applied to the robotic minions you'll encounter around every corner. It's not the usual experience I expect from an indie developer, and it's really hard to get bored of.

On top of that, the campaign is pretty well-executed too. It's fairly long, but not too long - five to ten hours, probably, depending on your play style - and what seems like a fairly ho-hum plot at first began to draw my attention by the end. The minimalistic (but nonetheless voiced) cutscenes, briefings and in-game dialogue make the game's budget more obvious but they made good use of what they could afford.

Once you get to the end of that, if you're not done blowing stuff up, you can move into Challenge Mode, which is basically an endless zombie-survival kind of game where the objective is to score as high as possible and climb up the leaderboards, or multiplayer where you can choose between free-for-all, head-to-head and team game modes. Both options are considerably tougher than the main game, so I'd recommend tackling them later to most people - you'll need to have well-practiced 6DOF flying skills for best results.

Unfortunately, there is no co-operative multiplayer mode, at least not for the time being - that's probably the most glaring omission in Overload. A capture-the-flag mode might not have gone astray either. But there's still easily enough on offer for the game to be worth playing.

Overall - considering the spotty track record of indie/self-published games, the professionalism Revival displays in Overload is pretty remarkable. Even if 6DOF isn't your cup of tea, they've shown they're a studio worth watching in future.

The music tracks are great, the dynamic lighting feels very real in the mines just looks great. The campaign is a joy to play.

The multiplayer is also really fun as a whole and feels pretty well balanced.

N√§m√§ niin sanotut 6DOF-pelit olivat jonkin hyvin lyhyen aikaa muotia. Descent on kuitenkin nyt vihdoin palannut, ja sen takana olleen Parallax Softwaren perustajat ovat perustaneet nyt uuden pelistudion ja tuoneet oman pelins√§, Overloadin, markkinoille.

Overload jatkaa kahden Descent-pelin muistoa ja tekee siit√§ niin paljon paremman. Nykylaitteistoa hy√∂dynt√§en grafiikoista ja etenkin r√§j√§hdyksist√§ on tehty upeita. Musiikista vastaavat my√∂skin tutut nimet, ja niiss√§ ei ole yht√§√§n mit√§√§n moitittavaa (soundtrack kannattaa siis ehdottomasti hankkia pelin mukana).

Olisihan se tietenkin kamalaa, jos peli itse ei olisi huvittava pelata, mutta se kuitenkin on, ja se on aivan mahtava. Ohjaimet toimivat jopa pelk√§ll√§ n√§pp√§imist√∂ll√§kin upeasti, vaikkakin hiirell√§ pelaamista suositellaan, sill√§ se kasvattaa tarkkuutta huomattavasti. Tasot ovat suuria, monipuolisia ja niist√§ l√∂ytyy aina lis√§√§ tutkittavaa, onhan ne pullollaan salaisuuksia Descent-pelien tapaan. Runsas ase- ja vastustajavalikoima vain tekev√§t pelist√§ entist√§ maukkaamman, ja aseen joutuu valitsemaan yleens√§ tilanteesta riippuen (vaikka yhdell√§ aseellakin p√§rj√§√§, se ei ole aina viisain strategia).

Jos t√§m√§ ei viel√§ riitt√§nyt, Descent-peleihin verrattuna uutta on se, ett√§ alusta sek√§ sen aseistusta voi p√§ivitt√§√§. Pitkin tasoja sek√§ salaisia alueita l√∂yt√§√§ pisteit√§, joilla voi ostaa alukseensa parannuksia tasojen v√§lill√§. Jokaisen aseen voi p√§ivitt√§√§ kahdesti, ja toisella p√§ivityksell√§ on aina kaksi eri vaihtoehtoa.

Peliss√§ on jopa Challenge Mode, er√§√§nlainen selviytymistila, miss√§ pelaaja suljetaan pienemp√§√§n tasoon ja pistet√§√§n vastaan loputtomia m√§√§ri√§ vihollisia. Se on mahtava ty√∂kalu taistelutaitojen ja lent√§misen harjoitteluun, ja jos kilpailumielt√§kin on, voi kilpailla tulostaulun huipulla olemisesta.

Kaiken p√§√§lle peliss√§ on t√§ll√§ hetkell√§ hieman pettymyksen tuottava moninpeli (jota tullaan parantamaan vastaisuudessa, etenkin konsolijulkaisujen my√∂t√§) sek√§ tasomuokkain, jonka avulla voi itse tehd√§ peliin omia lis√§tasojaan. Kaiken kaikkiaan peli on aivan mahtava pakkaus ja on todellinen jatko-osa Descentille.

Suositteluni t√§h√§n peliin kohdistuu Descentin faneille mutta my√∂s FPS-pelien sek√§ toimintapelien faneille yleens√§kin. Kokeile vaikka ilmaista demoa ja siirry sitten kokoversioon - sen voi taata ettet tule pettym√§√§n.",1528048382,1531947401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ABER!!! einige f√§hige Leute aus der Community haben das scheinbar Unm√∂gliche geschafft!

Es gibt ein Update f√ºr OVL auf steam zu Vers. 1.1, in der das katastrophale Matchmaking deaktiviert ist und statt dessen der Weg der Community vorgeschlagen und m√∂glich gemacht wird.

Auf der Seite tracker.otl.gg ist ein Gamebrowser und die n√∂tigen Hinweise zu OLMOD. OLMOD ist  ein Tool welches in das Hauptverzeichnis von OVL entpackt wird. OVL wird ab jetzt NUR NOCH √ºber OLMOD.exe gestartet.

Ab sofort gibt es dann im Spiel einen Serverbrowser, hier kann man Spielen beitreten bzw. selber MP-Spiele starten und das dann auch mit Community-Leveln, die um L√§ngen besser und mehr sind als die wenigen Maps der Entwickler.

Achtet darauf dass die Option ""Join in progress"" aktiviert ist, sonst bleibt ihr alleine im Level ;-)

So closely, in fact, that muscle memory kicked in rather quickly and I found myself flying through the levels just like I used to. Only issue is that, instead of knowing every map, bot and weapon like the back of my own hand, I know nothing. The result has seen me repeatedly flying into large unknown spaces and groups of bots as if I had played the level many times, and then realising that I actually have no idea how to use my gun, what this missile does, or if that corner is safe to duck behind. The other thing I noticed was that I had to remap the keyboard to exactly how I had the Descent series set up because muscle memory kept trying to use that instead of WASD; which I thought was really cool because I could fly just fine with a typical WASD setup in every other 6dof game I've played in the last few years. A testiment to the solid controls here.

Technically, The game seems pretty solid as well. I've not had any performance issues, and it runs as I would expect it to run on my PC. No major glitches yet in the few hours I've been playing, though I did have one odd moment when the game appeared to freeze for maybe a second or so. Level design is claustrophobic and easy to get lost, turned around or just upside down in, as typical of the Descent games. It definately feels like you are flying through a fully automated mining camp.

It feels and plays exactly like it, the levels are large and intricate, i only played past the first boss (6 levels or so ?) but it looks fantastic.

With 15 levels the game seems small, but i already played 5 hours for the first few levels and aparently they get much larger and more complex.

A level editor will be released (i think), so hopefully talented people will mod the descent 1 and 2 levels in it ;)

Haven't played MP yet, but MP is just a bonus for me.  

We've waited forever for a new Descent game.  There have been some solid 6DOF games in the past 15+ years, but none of them get the feel right.  However, this isn't some cheap knock-off made by a different company.  This game is made by the guys who created it to begin with and understand how a Descent game should play and feel.  Everything about this is smooth.  It controls beautifully, and blowing up robots has the right amount of punch to make it satisfying.  The weapons are fun to shoot and varied enough to allow for different play styles.  The levels are well designed and interesting enough to make me want to explore to find all the powerups and secrets.  The story is interesting enough that I actually don't mind that they don't have the rights to the story and setting from Descent, and I actually like the audio clips that you collect in the levels a lot.  There is also a pretty fun horde mode which provides some single player replayability (though the campaign is worth playing again at harder difficulties and to find all the secrets). 

It's hard for me to complain about anything in this game as its pretty much exactly what I wanted - basically Descent 1+2 updated for the modern age.  It's simple, but it should be.  I've heard that the Multiplayer matchmaking system could use some work, so there is that.

Singleplayer is fun and the maps can be large. The AI is fun to toy with, well, they toy with you; the AI is smart. There are a lot of secret areas to find and exploring is fun. Between levels you‚Äôre given the chance to upgrade your ship (based on upgrade points found in the map) which I really like.

Multiplayer seems put together well, and if cross-platform play comes into the picture, it will be even better! I haven‚Äôt played that much multiplayer though. As you play both singleplayer and multiplayer, you‚Äôll gain XP for multiplayer which lets you set your starting loadout (all weapons spawn in the maps though, nothing is hidden from you) and you can also tweak your ships playstyle to suit you. For example, you can have a little more armor or a little more damage as one of the many types of mini-tweaks you can do. This gives the game some variety while not being game breaking.

Fast paced, action oriented gameplay that hearkens back to its roots, making small changes to the formula. If you didn't play Descent or its sequels, it's a 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) shooter which means you can move in any direction, including yaw, roll, and pitch. Although you're technically in a space vessel of sorts, there's minimal inertia so it still plays much like a normal FPS otherwise. 

Its best features are pulled right from 90s game design, including its labyrinthine maps, chock full of secrets and pickups. Exploration is encouraged as the maps hide numerous powerups, many of which can be used between levels to improve your craft and arsenal. Weapons are satisfying to use, with most enemies dying to a few good hits and having a good sense of impact. As both you and your enemies all use projectile weaponry, it makes combat fast and frenetic as you try to lead your target with your weapons whilst simultaneously dodging those of your opponent. 

The campaign is great and ramps up the difficulty well, with several difficulty levels available from the start, with a hidden hard difficulty and harder new game plus mode. It also includes a challenge mode where you compete on leaderboards in a wave based arena mode, and multiplayer modes. At the time of writing only free for all deathmatch has any regular activity however. 

Overall I love this game. It's a modern take on Descent that retains everything that made the original great, adding on just enough elements such as the upgrade mechanics, and the story told through voice logs to elevate it above simple pastiche.",1527948061,1577436771,True,1,0,0.490463197231292725,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The controls are very customizable, so anybody can find something that works well for them.  The ship flight mechanic is great.  It just seems to flow.

I haven't finished the single player campaign yet, but so far the level design is fantastic.  It is haunting and claustrophobic.  The music and robot sound effects just add to that.  Trying to find your way through a pitch black cavern and hearing the quite noise one of the melee bots makes can be a little creepy.  The story is intriguing so far.  I want to see where it goes.

There are different modes to choose from.  There are two types of challenge mode.  One sets a timer, with the goal to kill as many ""auto ops"" as you can.  The other is infinite.  Both are great and have leader boards so you can see how well you do compared to others.

The level design is old-school Descent--minus the claustrophobic tight corridors--and there's not a lot in the way of the more-realistic detail work we're used to seeing in games these days, but I find that I don't really notice the lack. Overload does a really good job striking a balance between the minimalist aesthetics of the old Descent games and the more slick visual fanfare of contemporary titles.

The soundtrack is audiophile heaven. It makes liberal use of the industrial sounds of the Descent 2 soundtrack but is much more symphonic and melodic. Whereas Descent 2's soundtrack was brash and ""in your face"", Overload's doesn't scream for your attention and just lets you play the game but still has enough cool riffs and beats to stand out. With several different artists in the mix it can sometimes be a mixed bag when styles diverge, but it's still all good. If you're into soundtracks, do yourself a favor and get the package with the soundtrack.

In short, Overload is a must-have for fans of the old series and a great entry to the 6 DOF shooter genre for new fans, and the explosions are pretty enough to keep even the most shameless eye-candy junkie sated. Better yet, it supports VR out of the box and playing with a headset is an absolute blast. Mileage may vary...if you tend to motion sickness you're going to have a bit of a rough go of it. But if you've got the stomach and the chops, VR is the ONLY way to play Overload.

buy it, even at full price. it's great
-----
Coming into this game having only played Freespace 2, which came after the Descent games, I quickly learned I had no idea what I was doing. And I loved it. This game is fast paced and it definitely took me an hour or so to get the hang of it, but so far I'm really enjoying it. The campaign levels have taken me on average 15 minutes to complete (on the 3rd hardest difficulty), but that doesn't include dying! Also, I nowhere near finished any with 100% completion, so I'll be replaying a lot after I finish the game. 

I play on an xbox 360 controller because a flightstick would probably confuse me too much with how fast you need to fly. I really like the 360 controls and will most likely stick with it, but i've heard some people are experimenting with Steam Controllers which I might try (gyroscope).

Multiplayer is really fun and you have to approach it differently than singleplayer. As of writing, I bought the game one day after its release so there aren't many players on yet but the longest I've waited for a game is around 90 seconds, not too bad considering how few are playing right now. 

Supposedly, there are many cool sounding updates planned that should add even more.

I upgraded my 486/33Mhz CPU to a 486/66Mhz just for this game,  and then a week later built my first Pentium 1  133Mhz system;  again, just for Descent.  I then bought a Virge DX 3D video card (which was more like a 3D Deccelerator...).  Descent cost me a lot of money and time,  but it was worth every penny.  I bought Descent 2, Descent 3, and every mission pack that was released for all the games.    I even managed to break the high-hat off my Thrustmaster Joystick several times playing Descent, where Thrustmaster tech support's first comment was,  ""Been playing too much Descent, huh?"".  They sent a mailer with three new high-hat switches and I installed them myself (on multiple occasions).

So here we are today with a very worth successor to the original Descent series.  This game has beautiful graphics,  familiar-yet-fresh/modern gameplay, and a few new tricks along the way.  The game is story driven without being pedantic,  so you have a good sense of mission throughout the game's levels. I like the little audio logs you find along the way that help unfold the story about how the mining robots ran amok.   They also added a new 'upgrade' mechanic where you find multiple upgrade spheres during a level which can them be used to improve ship features and armament.   You're rewarded for being thorough when searching through the levels with more upgrade sphere and more audio logs that really fill in story details.  

I also LOVE that the devs of this game really spent some time showing love to all kinds of control schemes,  so that a Joystick is not required to play.  I'm playing through the entire game with my mouse /keyboard and it feels natural and fluid.  

10/10 would buy again.

Rather than lifting a slapdash assortment of gameplay components without understanding why they worked (a la Doom 2016), Overload understands exactly what made its source material so compelling: purity. At the core of it is movement, and movement in Overload feels extremely right - your ship is nimble and responsive, and the auto-leveling is smooth, smart, and adjustable. Weapon design is well-considered if slightly perfunctory, with each weapon filling a particular niche and providing plenty of zappy/explodey feedback. With regard to the single player campaign, enemy design is tight and smart, with placement and enemy types cleverly ramping up the difficulty the deeper you get. And the level design is phenomenal, with an impressive judiciousness when it comes to space - its areas rarely feel claustrophobic or cavernous, but the influence of the environment during firefights is keenly felt. Exploration is heavily rewarded, with part of your finds relegated to an XP/point system that allows you to selectively upgrade your ship and its weapon systems. Though visually it's a bit short on spectacle, everything on display is extremely clean and well-textured, with excellent lighting and bloom that really makes the otherwise spartan sci-fi industrial environments really pop. Overload does not reach far beyond the confines of the Descent games it's succeeding, but within that framework, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do with confidence and style, and given the drought of proper shooters on the market (especially among remakes), that's a special thing indeed.

There's something about the way that they blend the feeling of the movement, the weapons, the enemy design and AI, the level design and art, and the sound and music to produce something that just can't be matched by their imitators.

How to truly appreciate the Descent lineage:
Play Descent 1 + 2 (Rebirth) > Overload

PROS:
Ship/weapon customizations
Stellar graphics 
Fluid control
Authentic Descent experience

CONS:
No co-op multiplayer... but the original did.

Personal CONS:
- Player ship design is unaesthetic in comparison with the original Pyro-GX design. It looks like a space tractor or a cargo loader. But it's not like it's in your face all the time.
- Enemy designs are also a bit underwhelming and not as menacing/creative as their original counterparts (inspirations).

I've only played in VR and that's the only way I intend to play. 

The store page says amazing graphics, I wouldn't call them amazing, they get the job done and are passable, but not amazing, but then VR games rely more on Immersion and fun, even so I think some things could do with looking a bit better.

Controls, first I tried a PS4 controller, ugh ugh ugh, terrible, I mean it works but trying to tilt the nose up and down with any kind of accuracy sucked.  Swithed to Keyboard + Mouse, heaven.  Precise control, made it more enjoyable.  Using a Keyboard + mouse in VR was fine as there's not many keys to use.

Not sure if this was my end or some other issue, but now and again the screen in my Rift went black for a few seconds,  so will see if it's the game or something else.

Before purchasing I was a little concerend about VR motion sickness, I mean you're twisting, turning, spinnng etc in the game and whilst I don't suffer from VR sickness it was a concern, happy to say I didn't get any.

The gameplay is basically the same as Descent, it obviously won't have the same impact as it did back in the day but playing it in VR is fun and brings back some good memories.",1527846843,1527847025,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If that franchise name (or Forsaken, for that matter) means anything at all to you, you can stop reading and buy it now (if you already haven't). But, if it doesn't, there are plenty of reasons to buy Overload.

Essentially, Overload is a modernized Six-Degrees-Of-Freedom corridor shooter - in layman's terms, a zero-gravity FPS. Think the ending of ""The Return of the Jedi"" meets ""DOOM"" and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect here - not just in terms of control, but of gameplay. At it's core, Overload is as old-school an FPS as they come. Explore huge, labyrinthine levels, collect keys, find the nuclear reactor, blow it up, and fly through the escape hatch before the countdown ends. Collect a wide variety of weapons, pick up ammo and health, and shoot anything that moves.

But all that describes Descent too, and that's a game that's a whopping 23 years old now - and despite being totally playable even today, it's a product of its time. Where Overload shines is in how it updates the gameplay so effectively for a modern audience. As the humble joystick has fallen out of favor with most gamers - especially FPS fans - the controls have been optimized for both mouse & keyboard and gamepad players (although joystick is still a supported and viable option). RPG-Lite elements such as weapon and ship upgrades encourage exploration and critical thinking. A relatively in-depth story with surprisingly strong voice work helps lend a sense of purpose to the action. A fully-functional challenge (arcade) mode with online leaderboards will appeal to those with a really competitive side, and a modest but well-balanced and highly-competitive multiplayer suite rounds out the package. There's a lot of content for the modest asking price - more than most AAA titles, actually.

With a revived interest among gamers in reviving old-fashioned FPS games (See: Doom '16 [which the Overload dev team credits as being a large inspiration], Dusk, Ion Maiden, etc.), Overload shouldn't appeal to only a small niche of gamers that remember Descent or Forsaken from their youth. No, this is just a fun shooter, plain and simple. You like fun shooters? Buy this game.",1527824985,1527824985,True,2,0,0.50354611873626709,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You're still clearing mines of virused mining robots. You're still collecting keycards. You're still saving hostages. You're still blowing up reactors and rushing to the exit.

If you thought DooM/Quake had big, complex maps, prepare to be [i]absolutely overwhelmed[/i] (you can use a guide bot if you want).

Hell, even the mapping tools of Unity were adjusted by the devs to make it more like the original Descent (which used a cube brush for everything). This gives the levels that nostalgic feeling, but comes at the cost of map fidelity - and it's rather noticeable. A lot of textures are rather same-y (especially inside unstructured caves), as a result of which the planets/moons you're visiting don't really get their unique theme the same way they do in old Descent games, where each mine had it's own theme and feeling depending on the geology there. This makes orientation hard as well, because a lot of places look way too similar.

The devs tried to do the same thing DooM 2016 did to arcadey shooters, especially in the upgrade system part, but it really does come off as if they were... too afraid to do anything crazy. That's really the only criticism I have for this game - it does Descent very well, but it doesn't really try to evolve in any way.

So take that as you will. If you loved the old Descent games, you will feel 100% at home here. The environments even feel the same, right down to their blocky, rectangular architecture. Unfortunately it also gives them something of a weird out-of-time feeling, since it almost feels like an HD texture and lighting pack on top of the original geometry. Environments lack detail or clutter, and generally still feel like tubes and corridors, rather than a cohesive base with purpose or layout.

But at the end of the day, that stuff doesn't really matter. This isn't Deus Ex. You aren't exploring the environment for clues or opening cabinets to find hidden goodies. This is DESCENT. Fly around in zero G and blast the s**t out of anything that moves. Run into suspiciously placed walls looking for a ton of secrets (the first level has 15). Blow up the reactor and scramble to the exit before you're caught in the explosion.

So yeah, if you loved Descent, you will love this game. If you wanted some kind of reboot that controls like Descent but looks like Doom 2017, you might be disappointed.

Personally, I got everything that I paid for (as a backer of the Kickstarter). I signed up for a new Descent, and that's what I got.

Overload is made by the original creators of Descent. It‚Äôs almost identical to the original but created from the ground up for modern systems, including VR support.

I usually prefer VR games that allow you to stand and use motion controllers. But for this I was happy to make an exception since I‚Äôve enjoyed playing the original Descent games ever since the late 90‚Äôs.

This brought back a ton of nostalgia for me. Many elements of this mirror the originals. Like the obvious 6 degrees of freedom, the way the enemy bots behave, and how the levels end by blowing up the reactor and escaping before the end of the self destruct sequence. All of the things that made the original great are here again, and cranked up to 11.

There‚Äôs just one thing missing that I wish for: CO-OP campaigns. There‚Äôs currently deathmatch multiplayer, which is fun. But being able to play through the campaigns in CO-OP with other players would be especially great.

This game doesn‚Äôt require VR. But for me, it‚Äôs the only way to play.
If you love the original Descent games, then I highly recommend it.

This happened to me with [i]Overload[/i], and it will happen for many of you who have experienced the [i]Descent[/i] series as a kid (or as an adult too üòä).

I remember loading up [i]Overload[/i] for the first time, and it triggered the memory of my dad buying my first new computer when I was 9 years old: a Compaq Presario 9232. It had three games: [i]Hardball 4[/i], [i]Magic Carpet[/i] (RIP Bullfrog), and [i]Descent: Destination Saturn[/i]. I remember loading up [i]Descent[/i] for the first time and could not move at all. I was used to using the arrow keys for games. So I was just rotating my ship around, shooting the destructible signs, and thinking when are the bad guys going to come? Embarrassingly, it took me about a week (after finally reading the manual), that you move forward and backwards using A and Z. Once I held that A button and heard that first scream from the Class 1 Drone, I knew I was in for a real treat. My dad rarely bought me games because he was worried about game violence (e.g. [i]Doom[/i]), but he knew [i]Descent[/i] was more family-friendly. Over the years, he gave me [i]Descent: Anniversary Edition[/i] (which I didn‚Äôt realize until I got the game that the campaign had me going past Saturn), [i]Descent 2: Infinite Abyss[/i], and [i]Descent 3[/i]. Prior to [i]Descent 3[/i] coming out, I convinced my dad to get me a PC with a graphics card since [i]Descent 3[/i] required one. He agreed, and my new PC came equipped with an S3 Savage4 card. Although it was a budget card, I was able to experience the final chapter of the Material Defender.

Subsequently, I was following rumors and possible concept art for [i]Descent 4[/i], then hearing [i]Descent 4[/i] being cancelled, then reading that Interplay was bankrupt, and then Interplay sort of re-emerging which gave some hope that the series might revive again. Nearly 20 years later, the original creators of [i]Descent[/i] created its own company, [i]Revival Productions[/i], to develop the long-awaited spiritual successor of [i]Descent[/i].

I was bummed that I missed the Kickstarter for the game, but I cannot imagine the anxiety of the developers during those last 24 hours. I wish I knew about the game to help out at the time. So, thank you for all the Kickstarter backers for making this game happen! I know if the developers start another Kickstarter project (e.g. [i]Freespace 3[/i]‚Ä¶ fingers crossed!), then I will definitely contribute knowing how well [i]Overload[/i] was developed and produced. Thank you to the Revival team for allowing me to relive my childhood memories and congratulations for producing a fantastic game!

Many reviewers have already gone into the features of the game, but I would like to reiterate that there are many types of gameplay that fits everyone‚Äôs needs and extends the replayability and life of the game. It‚Äôs not just a [i]Descent[/i] game with modern graphics. There‚Äôs the single player campaign with a deeper storyline and voice acting. In addition, there is your arcade-like Challenge Mode that would likely bring hours and hours of gameplay to get to the top of the leaderboard. Then there is the multiplayer to challenge other pilots in anarchy and team anarchy with more multiplayer modes coming in the future. Lastly, there is the Level Editor that will be released shortly after [i]Overload‚Äôs[/i] release day that would bring on countless customization.

Sadly because star citizens hack developers got the descent trademark long before the original descent team did their kickstarter.  The descent team did there own thing, the problem is they only got 300K during the kickstarter.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revivalprod/overload-the-ultimate-six-degree-of-freedom-shoote

versus the hack devs here:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/descendentstudios/descent-underground

So overloads kickstarter had its thunder stolen from it and you can feel it in the end product.  Not only that, the original descent developers haven't worked on descent in almost 20 years.  The last time they worked on descent was roughly 18 years ago and you can feel it.  The problem with that and many of them largely being out of the game industry is that many of the things that made descent, descent were removed for overload.  

Descent team doesn't seem to grasp fully what made the earlier version of descent 2 great.  They had stumbled upon the right weapons, movement and weapon feel for a great party multiplayer game because the weapons were so bloody devious.  If you were not so good at the game you could spam smart mines around doors and in halways and rack up the kills, or you could go for the earthshaker and get a room full of people who were busy fighting one another and cackle maniacally.  To use an analoguef from another game - think about the blue shell in mario kart vs the earth shaker in descent 2.   It gave weaker players hilarious ways to get back at the 3D spaceship flying gods of descent.  That equalization between low skill vs high skill players has been removed and sadly overload is basically a high skill loaded game.

Overload as a game is a real mixed bag, they captured somewhat the feel of the descent games but the game overall feels very sterile because there has been almost 20 years of game evolution since Descent 2 in 1996.  Descent 2 being the best version from a game mechanic standpoint.

Overload is only inspired by descent and unfortunately you can feel it in the end result with the weapons.  Many of the weapons for overload weren't really thought out too much.  That and many of the quirks from descent 2's homing system were actually to descent 2's benefit in multiplayer.  Basically back when descent 2 was released early in 3D videocard history, there was a framerate bug that made homing bullets lock in on you better the higher your framerate on the 3dfx version of the game.  The great thing about that was though was it increased the challenge of the game, I remember roaming through the halls of minreva and having smart missle bullets and gold smart mine bullets everywhere.  When you turned down the fps, many of the homing bullets were trivial to dodge thereby making them useless.  This is one of those wonderful accidents of history that was missed, unlike what happened with quake and bunny hopping where the movement momentum bug in quake became integrated into the game.

The overload campaign is nothing to write home about and tragically the things that were actually good about descent's single player have been forgotten by the devs, like huge endbosses at the end of levels.  The things that were actually the high points of descent 2 single player.

The story in Overload is bizarre to say the least, they created a great feeling universe that is undone with the last acts of the game as the story writer is too obsessed with crazy nerd theories regarding collective superhuman AI consciousness.  So all the atmosphere they built up with the voice acting and the feel of the universe, comes undone in the last few acts.

Overload is not a bad game, but don't go in expecting a true ""Descent 4"".  Descent overload isn't, Overload is really a hybrid of all the worst aspects of D1 with all the worst aspects of modern progession based weapon design.

The thing that made descent what it was, was the battle for the powerups and the weapon/missle powerups that allowed low skill players to also have fun which is totally missing in overload tragically if you have any inkling to play its multiplayer.",1527687706,1536047484,False,2,0,0.461226314306259155,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ahh 6dof, how I've missed thee.  Since the days I was running Kali in Dos with a 14.4k modem, I've been playing descent online.  I took a long break, as did many others over the years.  Went to different games.  Got hooked on Overwatch for the last 2 years (600 hours on Reinhardt) but lately, it's been a struggle.  I was then hit with an epiphany, it's the game.

Multiplayer in Overload is a completely different vibe.  Overwatch gets frustrating, because usually when you lose it's your knucklehead team mates.  In Overdrive, [b]YOU ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF[/b].  When you lose or do poorly in Overdrive, you end up admiring your opponents skills and techniques.  There's nobody else to blame but you.  Everyone types ""GG"" after a game.  

[b] a primer on 6dof[/b]

6dof stands for ""Six Degrees of Freedom"".  In most shooters, you run along the ground, and point your gun at people.  6dof games offer something substantially different.  The ability to rise from the ground and move in any direction.   Probably the closest thing that can describe it would be First person drones, but in a zero-g environment.

[b] Gameplay[/b]

The pre-release game contains both single player campaigns, and if you ask nicely from various sources, a multiplayer component.  In 2 days of this review, it will be included in the release. In addition to these game modes, there's also a ""Challenge Mode"" where wave after wave of enemies with ever increasing difficulty come after you. 

You fly a small spaceship that's equipped with a variety of main weapons, that come in 2 flavors, energy and ballistic.  The ammo for either can be used on a fairly nice spectrum of guns.  You have plain lasers, a charge laser, shotgun, flak.   On the secondary side you have missiles or bombs.  Missile pods are small missiles with rudimentary tracking.  Hunters are full homing.  There's also a time bomb that in campaign or challenge mode creates bullet time, slowing down the gameplay giving you crucial time to lay some robots to waste.

[b]Controls[/b]

Developers did a fantastic job capturing the feel of the original descent.  This is probably the most important aspect of this game is the controls.  There's a lot of things you have to turn off to get the original trichord control style, but it's in there.  The controls menu offers a plethora of mappable controls, and even an analog axis recalibration tool.   Very very nice.  I can't talk this up enough.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

This is really what it's all about, and will make or break any game these days.  Multiplayer will be harder for newcomers, because a lot of the people playing this game have been playing similar games since 98' (Wow, 20 years!)  but if you're up for a challenge, this game has already gotten the seal of approval from all these old 6dof ""pilots"" I'm no top tier, but even when I lose like I said above, nobody gets mad.  

There's a total of 3 modes for multiplayer.  Team vs Team, 1 VS 1, and deathmatch.  All of these modes are fairly self explanatory.  

I do find some critique with the multiplayer though.   The original gamebrowser in Descent 2 was great.  Joining games in progress that had no time limit was great too.  Not really a fan of the queuing system, but for all intents and purposes it works.

[b]Graphics[/b]

Very nice.  Sparks fly out of damaged robots, and when things die there's a giant explosion of sparks flying everywhere.  It's sort of like watching the death star blow up. Settings will allow you to do everything from run your graphics card cool, to cooking breakfast on it.

[b]Overall[/b]
5 out of 5.  A game like this hasn't been made in a while, and it's every bit the successor to the game that inspired it.¬† If you've never tried a 6dof game, start here.¬† If you're an old Descent Pilot looking for a new place to hang your helmet, hang it here.¬† Everyone from the old days are here.

Overload is a game of sublime movement and shooting, quite bare-bones in the EA release but what is there is bunkers and reactors & other industrial-looking corridors that pour out occasionally into caves and lava flows, teeming with deadly bots that sometimes seem cunning, sometimes wildly erratic.  I have spent many quick 15 minute sessions with the challenge levels climbing the internet leaderboards, and have played the single player campaign maps all several times and can't wait for the full release.  In whatever mode, the game makes well for short bursts and long runs, and can be quite addictive if you wish to be tops.

The biggest promise this game has is its' as-of-yet fully detailed or released level editor (probably not out at launch either) and the robustness of the campaign.  For the price i would say it is a fair risk even if the level editor ends up being a year away, what is in the Early Access at this point is well enough to recommend for those that loved the 6DOF games of yesteryear, this truly feels like the best tribute and extension that could be.  For those that require an open, moddable level editor may want to wait to see how that pans out.  Multiplayer should allow for plenty of replay value and play well beyond what the campaign alone and challenge maps will bring while we wait.

It's a blast and one of the most sorely missed types of games imo, and it is so great to see it back and represented so well.  For FPS gamers of all types, especially those willing to add another dimension to their thinking, this is it.

Move in any direction, stop on a dime, fly around obstacles, and try to take down foes who can do the same, in claustrophic environments full of hazards. The ceiling is lava.

It's a different sort of frantic first-person shooter where eveyone can fly, with a single-player mode focused on exploration. You may find yourself upside down with no idea where you are. Bring Dramamine.

Pros:

It feels great, controls great. Every pro of Descent I and II slots in here alongside much-improved mouse support (to be expected after 20 years). Robust single-player, now with a plot beyond a text blurb prologue, ranked online multiplayer, and a Challenge Mode score attack against AI on the multiplayer maps.

You kill robots (Autonomous Operators, or ""Auto-Ops""), pick up energy and shields (*cough* armor) in the form of yellow and blue orbs, and expand your arsenal across single-player levels. Two varieties of upgrade points, often found in secret areas and awarded for rescuing hostages, add minor RPG elements in the form of weapon and ship upgrades that persist between levels.

Cons:

This is a revival of Descent II more or less as it existed, with minor modern touches. If you're looking for an evolution of the format in terms of setting and objectives, Outrage Games released the somewhat-different Descent 3 in 1999.

This is the game the Descent fans have been waiting for and even though it doesn't have the Descent name, it does have its developers and that is what matters. The game doesn't only feel good, it feels better than Descent. The weapons feel impactful and strong, the robots are menacing and provide quite a challenge. Overload has 5 main difficulty levels with one extra ""secret"" difficulty. The different difficulties make sure that a wide variety of players with different skill levels can have a fun and fairly challenging time. 

The single player campaign levels we've had a chance to play in early access have been very promising. In addition to the classic Descent style mine clearing and secret hunting, there is now an upgrade system, so your playthroughs can actually vary a fair bit depending on which types of weapon and ship upgrades you choose to specialise in.

The visuals in this game are great. The modern game engine allows for some very impressive visual effects which truly bring the game alive and make it very atmospheric. The lighting in particular is great. Firing a flare down a dark cave system or seeing a robot's headlight coming around a corner in a dark tunnel is truly something special.

Overload also comes with two ""challenge modes"". ""Infinite"" is essentially a last stand survival mode. Robots keep spawning and you have to survive for as long as possible while destroying as many robots as possible. ""Countdown"" has a 5 minute timer, destroy as many bots as you can and try to survive until the end. Once the 5 minutes runs out, your ship blows up and it's game over. Both modes have online leaderboards, so there is definitely a competetive aspect to it. The modes do have some luck-based elements such as powerup spawns. If you get a bunch of invulnerability powerups, you're most likely going to score higher. Such elements can be quite frustrating for the really competitive players. Overall the challenge mode is a very fun experience where you can really push your limits.

Finally there's the Multiplayer. Currently there are two game modes Anarchy and Team-anarchy, essentially deathmatch and team-deathmatch. Weapons are altered from their single player counter-parts for balance reasons.

Multiplayer beta plays really quite well as long as you have low ping. Currently the multiplayer uses official matchmaking servers that are in different parts of the world. The servers seem to be good quality and connected to the German server I got ping ranging from 30-50 while connecting from Estonia with a 100/100 Mbps connection. To the North American East Coast server my ping was 120-140 and West Coast was 180-200.

‚óè [i]Sublevel Zero[/i] added procedural levels, gear crafting, and unlockables into the equation to become a pleasant enough distraction, but never a real contender.
‚óè [i]Elite: Dangerous - CQC[/i] is a polished multiplayer 6DoF experience but is also a totally different beast from Descent.
‚óè [i]Everspace[/i] is fun, but with more Roguelike elements and open space instead of claustrophobic tunnels, the vibe is once again very different.
‚óè Hmm, and I guess there's [i]Descent: Underground[/i]. Let's just not go there.

After so long we'd probably be happy for [i]any[/i] half-decent spiritual successor - fortunately for us, though, Revival didn't simply set their sights on half-decent.

Well, yes, my friends! We're going to wait 20 years, but finally it was born! This is REAL DESCENT! The feeling, the sight, the mood, the music, the effects are all the same as in the original, first Descent - but in absolute contemporary quality.
The game is flawless (ok, some tiny things need to improve, but it's under development), thoughtful, clever, heart-souled professional work. Beautiful spectacle, fearful enemies with excellent AI, simple but challenging gameplay, a clear menu system, full customization, and excellent hardware support.
ABSOLUTE RECOMMENDED! For Descent-fans REQUIRED !! Although its name is different, it has been the best Descent ever - including similar attempts.

Many thanks for the developer team!",1523316125,1523456913,True,7,0,0.61538463830947876,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I'm literally speechless about how good this is.

The gameplay is great, it's smooth, the weapons are pretty good you feel very empowered using them, killing the ennemy ships /robots is rewarding, the level design is fantastic.
Overall flying with the ship is like a fusional relationship. 

I'm playing on both regular monitor & in vr, this game is a masterpiece.
It's simply the best six degrees of freedom game since Descent 3.

These developers put their heart and soul into this game and you can feel it the second you start playing it.
The only thing I dislike in Overload is that we cannot set FOV above 90¬∞.
If only there was options for 100-110 FOV it would have been perfect.

What!? How? Really? Is it back?

No other ""remake"" or ""re-imagining"" can hold a candle to this. I wish I could shave 20 years off of my age and be at the same store I bought the originals. Oh, the awe, the anticipation to return home holding the brand new box and on to install it on my 486 precious rig.

It is finally back, and it's better than ever. Not just the feeling, but the gameplay as well.

[i]It's a shame...

...that this game isn't widely marketed to the public.

Not only does it satisfy the ""nostalgia crave"", not only is this a perfect emulation of the Descent of yore (no wonder with the guys -legends- at the helm), it's a lesson in contemporary games design. It encompasses multiple genres (FPS, flightsim, stealth and tactics) and distills them into a unified, solid experience. Like we were used to in an era long gone by. :)

What Doom '16 did, this one does better. Spread the word!

In a way, it is that kind of oldschool, and they made so many correct descisions in development where almost all other developers fell through or missed the mark by a few centimeters.

The whole thing starts with the startup. You are looking at no logos, no unskippable animations, no advertisement. Nothing. A load screen you are in the main menu. As simple as that may sound, this is pure delight.
This continues within the game in an unapologetic way. It feels as the developers implemented a ""No-nonsense"" doctrine. Items, powerups, weapons, level design. Especially the latter: If this may be too much of 3D at the start, as it was for me, go out of your way and try to adapt. Even though I played the games of old, my brain forgot how challenging this was. That is 20 years of dumbed down FPS.

Gameplay is fast and balanced as it used to be, but not without challenge. Sometimes, the learning curve is steep, but, as you reading this, chances that this is something new to you are slim. I read the following somewhere in another corner of this site: ""Rapid unscheduled disassembly"". That is an accurate description. Everything considered, the developers mastered that part.

The level aesthetics, however, could use a bit more variation. Some single levels do indeed look more varied, which shows that it is fundamentally possible, so there is hope that more of this this will translate over to the final campaign. As the levels are now, this is my only real criticism on the game. There are wow-effects however, when suddenly the crowded space opens up and gives room to a - vastly - bigger interior. More of that large scale contrast would be nice.

Overall, graphics are excellent. They deliver exactly what they should, whit added emphasis on beautiful explosion. Soundtrack is lovely and the sound effects are colorful, too. While writing this, it strikes me that
I cannot remember the last game which had a soundtrack. From the not too distant past, just can remember games with ambient tracks or sequenced samples, so this came as a nice surprise.

Controls are awesome. I know that there are several people out there who think that a HOTAS setup is the way to go, and it indeed might be for them, but this comes from a convinced mouse+keyboard user. I think it just works, it does not get in the way and after an enormous short amount of time, thinking about it disappears, which is the greatest compliment I can offer for gaming controls.

This is the only early access title I own, which is telling. I played the demo and that was it. It feels like a finished game - with just the full content missing. If this was 1994, the early access title would be equivalent of a shareware release and, consequently, the mail order game is what this will hopefully be at Version 1.0.

And it's made by the guys who originally made Descent!
What you see is what you get.

If Descent 1 & 2 were done in this day and age, this would be it.
The moment I saw Rift support, I was extatic. While the Rift doesn't enhance the experience greatly, it is still something I appreciate seeing greatly.

Considering that this is a price point at which I would've definitely bought the original 2 Descent games when they came out, this is definitely a fair price for what you get.

Keep in mind, I am two levels in, just got to my second reactor.


Pros: 
-It's Descent, but new again
-Rift support
-Great soundtrack, not that this is exactly surprising from this franchise
-More weapons than I've ever seen in a Descent game. Keep in mind, I have not played Descent 3.
-Graphics very close to the original, if it were fully rendered with ambient occlusion, screen space reflections, bloom, a proper lighting system, bumpmaps/normalmaps. Most of the mining robots have kept familiar shapes, but they look infinitely better.

Cons:
-High probability that mouse acceleration is being used. Still a step up from previous games when it comes to mouse support though.
-Does not like ASW one bit, though I would attribute that to ASW being ASW more than anything else.
-Framerates can vary greatly. I've found turning off AO and anistropic filtering didn't yeld terrible results graphically, and improved framerates greatly.
-Bloom cannot be fully disabled from in-game menus.
-You don't have a physical body. You are an empty, haunted ship.
(To the developpers of the game, I'm just mentioning this because it's fairly jarring to look down to an empty seat in VR)

If you're complaining about experiencing great motion sickness in this game..
It shouldn't even be a surprise at this point. Game was already confusing in 2D at first.

Would probably be one of those people who would bash a game about being an astronaut because it made them sick.

This might be the game that actually attracts a younger newer audience like the original game did back in 1994.

This game is literally Descent. You may make your own mind up as to whether or not that's a recommendation.

To go into more detail:

Were you born in the late 80s or early 90s? Did play flight-sim/shoot-'em-up hybrids like Hellbender and Descent religiously? Do you enjoy the thought of guiltlessly murdering a variety of hovering robots with a colourful selection of guns and missiles? Do you like flying around in extremely constrained spaces?

Congratulations - you will love this game!

When I write reviews on Steam, I try to shy away from the whole ""if you liked X, then you'll love this game"" clich√©, but in this case I think it's appropriate. If you liked Descent or any of its direct sequels, you will very likely love this game, because it's literally just Descent but with better graphics. All the guns and missiles are more or less straight ports of weapons from the old games with new names. The robots are different to some degree, but even there I could see some obvious design similarities. Everything is more or less the same.

This also includes the claustrophobic, labyrinthine level design, the dozens of genuinely secret secret areas in each level, the fast-paced, nerve-racking gameplay and a pretty period-accurate soundtrack. The controls need a little bit of work here and there, but they're generally as tight and responsive as I remember then being back when I was 9 and only very slightly worse at video games than I am at 29.

Beyond a fairly simple upgrade system, this game makes no real attempt to innovate on the Descent formula. The slight changes it makes to core systems from the old games feel like additions that should always have been there. And for fans of Descent 3, I should say that aside from the general look and feel of the game, this game cribs far more heavily from Descent 1 and Descent 2 than the third installment. You shouldn't expect any wide-open outdoor spaces, mission control updates or gigantic set-piece boss fights in this game.

I had genuine fun playing the four missions currently available for this game, and it's one of the few Early Access titles I felt was genuinely worth my money. I can't say for sure whether you'll feel the same. This game is decidedly a nostalgia trip, and if you were never a fan of Descent or you want something that takes the genre some place new, this game will not satisfy you.

If I had to say what I liked least, I'd have to say the levels. They feel characterless and confined. In descent 3, the levels were big, important chapters of the game, each feeling distinct. Switzers lab, the city, mars, the battleship, the prooving grounds--all of them had their own feel and shape. And they all took a good amount of time to get through too, but whether or not that's a good thing is up to debate.

The enemies feel less important too. I could barely tell what I was fighting let alone pay the distinction any mind. The most I could tell was that one of them attacked via ramming.

Once again, to compare to descent 3: The little blue police-looking robots which told you to freeze, The big screeching brutes, the ones with the claws, the soldiers, the flying squid things, the gunslingers. All of these had character. 

In Overload they've been downgraded to making simple noises and all looking relativly the same.

cons:
-The Cockpit is really boring, no appliances or displays.
-Really BAD Cockpit texture, yes 1 cheap texture for the whole ship... OMG even descent1/2 got a better cockpit -.- (It feels like a placeholder, not immersive in VR at all...)
-Hud is only a overlay, no displays in your ship.
-own Weaponshoots went straight into your cockpit when you strafe your ship.
-no resolution adjustment (Pixel Density/SS) for VR.
-Mission Briefing is only a text file with radiovoice
-no Brightness adjustment for the stupid HUD, Godrays incoming... 
The brightness in graphic settings only adjust the whole game.

pros:
-good weapon sounds
-nice environment sounds
-nice particel effects
-good performance
-good AI

If the developers decide to improve the game, i will update and change my Review.
But at the moment i cant really recommend to buy it, if you looking for a game in VR.

Update1:
-The developer response to my feedback, and announced improvement for HUD and
weaponfire that moving into the cockpit and the missing Pixel Density feature.

Update2:
-Last Patch released few days ago and still no improvements for VR.
Devs told me to wait and promised they working on it after console build is ready.

Anyways i lost faith in Overload, if they not releasing a really great VR improvement update, i just wasted my money, there is no reason for me to play it in this state. :(

Update3:
5 days till release and no VR Updates at all in sight, really sad... dont buy it if you looking for a good polished VR game.

Update4 Release version 1.0:
Final Release Version is out today, No VR improvements at all!
It was all a simple lie, the developer dont put any work to improve this game in early access.
I wish i never backed this game, big disappointment.



There is a fresh updated demo, you can try this out... dont buy this game blind, if you still intrested!

I was a fan from descent1 and 2 and also from forsaken.
Im expected a really good VR game, but the quality isnt there yet and potentialy never gets improved. I hope im wrong here, because i like the genre :(

Bravo, and thankyou to the team for making it. If you were a fan of the originals just buy it, you won't be dissapointed.

**UPDATE AFTER OFFICIAL RELEASE**

The game is amazing, so polished it shines. Now that I can progress further into it I have encountered incredibly clever new bots, awesome weapons and upgrades. 

The Bot AI particularly impresses. They flank, quietly sneak around behind you, retreat and sucker you into ambushes. And have a creepy ability to navigate even complex cave systems, and use the environment to their advantage. I have jumped out of my seat occasionally like I'm playing Doom when one of them has sneakily surprised me. Spooky!

It's rare to find an early access game so polished. Sure it doesn't have fancy hollywood cut scenes and a story written by Joss Whedon. But most of us just usually skip that stuff anyway. What it does have is distilled to perfection game mechanics, graphics and sound.
Throw in some mind bending navigation puzzles, a long campaign and multiplayer, and it's all you will ever need.",1513375228,1528916054,True,0,0,0.451499909162521362,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I AM a backer!  I was hesitant, yes, but I saw the teaser they released when their Kickstarter success looked grim.  I JUMPED at the chance!   The teaser turned it around and they got what they needed.  
And THESE GUYS CREATED the original Descent and Descent 2!!  AND one of the best level creators back in the day is working with them to make really great places to combat rogue mining robots!
Their TEASER Looked more polished and played SO WELL, better than other attempts at Descent-Type play, it grabbed attention and has held it very well.  For new players and old Descent players alike it is thrilling nearly everyone.
EXCELLENT 3D, VR support, Multi-Platform (PC, Xbox One, PS4, LINUX!), and the game is now FAR MORE polished, better, and feels SO MUCH like playing Descent 2 with awesome graphics.  Ability to upgrade your ship in many areas, not just weapons.  When you destroy a robot ship it is VERY satisfying with parts scattering everywhere, smoke trailing many of those parts, great particle physics with sparks and flames and destruction!  You only have ONE life, but you have the ability to save early and often!  If one strategy doesn't work, reload and try again.  Many difficulty levels, many options for  YOUR preference of Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick or Console-type controller. and completely configurable keys and buttons.
The SOUNDS are fantastic, atmospheric graphics and sound really suck you into the scenes, good music, surround lets you know quickly something just came up behind you, and overall this has been done very very well.
There have been public demo releases, but the beta versions for Backers have been a joy to play.  They hit ANOTHER ONE outta the park!  
GET IT!  Back it!  Play it NOW.  Every update to the beta versions have introduced really nice changes and they are listening to the beta players finding bugs and requesting features.
It is all Single Player at this time.  But there are several modes, from Training, to Story mode, to Challenge Mode that has you fighting wave after wave of bots as long as you can stay alive in one of many different and really cool levels that cover many types of environments to play in.  One is mostly ICE!
When you go to www.playoverload.com you see the game played on the background... not just a little window, but the WHOLE browser background is actual game play.  (many scenes, not one session)  And you see exactly how it will look when you load it up!
This one is great for all Descent fans old and new.  There is little I can really complain about so far, except that I think the rock in tunnels dug by bots are a bit plain, but hey, it's just rock!  VERY minor.  They still might change that.
It's obvious I'm loving this game.  Loved Descent 1 & 2.... Descent 3 was Okay, but just okay, though it was fun too.
Overload takes the whole experience NOT to the Next level... but SEVERAL levels above!

This game is great, and is a must play. Even more so if you have a VR headset. Everything I wrote below was refined and distilled into a great experience the 6DOF genre hasn't seen in a very, very long time. If I could thumbs it up more I would.

So I'm giving this a recommend, but under the pretense that you add this to your wishlist and keep an eye out for it when it comes out of early access. Everything about this game feels promising, from a gameplay and even development standpoint, but in it's current state it is a glorified, albiet very polished demo of sorts.

Everything from the music, to the graphics, to the ship handling, to ther weapons feels phenominal. 

Weapons have a certain ""weight"" to them and varies depending on which one you're using. They all feel like they have thier place and are balanced well against the enemy types.

The music is this mid 90's ""Goldeneye-esque"" sound that meshes well with the games atmosphere, especially considering it's a love letter to that era and the height of 6DOF games. 

The graphics are great, and are exactly what they need to be. Sort of inbetween old and new. Blocky enough to harken back to the old style, but with enough polish and pop to fit in with newer titles. Like the ships themselves look very much like that chunky classic design, but the lighting effects of the weapons and levels really stand out and look great,

Control-wise, even as a flightstick/gamepad player everything is responsive and smooth. All buttons and axes can be bound and rebound to whatever your heart desires. Your ship feels great to control and manouvering around obsticals and enemies is effortless once you get the hang of it, which isn't long. The control scheme and handling make it easy, especially if your used to flight/space sims or even FPS games.

Gameplay feels great, making use of the stay moving or die philosphy of old shooters. A lot of the challange comes from keeping tabs on your surroundings, your weapons, your energy and your enemies at the same time. Balancing booming and zooming, full on assaults, or retreating to replenish health/energy/weapons. All in all, the core of it is very satisfying to get a hang of and clearing out a horde of enemy ships all trained on you is very satisfying.

Again, as this is an early access ""beta"", there's not a lot in the way of game modes, and while maps and game types are still being added, what you have are some broken up story maps and survival modes. But if Revival stays the course and completes what they set out, what we'll have is one of the best 6DOF games in a long, long time.",1508305944,1530069998,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

From the people who made Descent so many years ago, a modernization of the same mechanics (without the same title, for legal reasons). Even the weapons are mostly the same concept. That's not to say that the game isn't original or inventive; there are plenty of things unique to it as well (time bombs, creepers, the overload powerup). The game simply draws from an older inspiration, and is therefore better thought-out, and has even picked up some of the old community surrounding Descent.

The ship is a joy to control, and all the weapons and so on are intuitive and responsive. The game has an easy setting on which you can demolish hundreds of enemies, but it can also get very challenging if you set it that way. The atmosphere can vary from map to map, but it tends to be a little dark and somber. Not a horror game, but dark nonetheless. A lot like its predecessor, Descent.

As it currently stands, the game has three story-mode (read: campaign, there is no real story) levels, and an infinite survival sort of ""challenge mode"" with eight or nine maps. The challenge mode can get a little repetitive in my opinion, but it takes a while. Updates have been regular and never fail to introduce something new and interesting.

The six degrees of freedom in this game combine with using an HMD make for some really sick gameplay.

TLDR; If you enjoyed the original, you will likely love this one. I do.

Some context -  I'm an old gamer. I'm an Elite Dangerous early backer (to recapture Elite from back in the BBC micro days). I also backed ""Descent Underground"" for the same reasons - nostalgia - for the days when low-ping-bast*rds and modems were a thing.

A while ago I re-bought all of the original Descent (1/2/3)  series (ty GoG) hoping to enjoy the replays. - Sadly, in my eyes, those games are just too dated on modern hardware.

This version, by the original Descent crew, has entirely captured the original feel, and If I'm being honest, more so than the similarly named 'Descent Underground"".

I'm looking forward to the full version and wondering what mutli-player is going to feel like.

Come on guys, you kinda/sorta have the mass-driver, now bring on the MegaMissile. quad lasers, fusion cannon and lets not forget the vauss.. I need the vauss cannon.

Has a nice challenge mode where you fight to the death vs CPU droids in various arenas. Probably the best game mode IMO.

Some of the robots are not very well balanced and to be honest the single player and challenge mode is drastically impaired as a result. For example, some enemies fire at you IMMEDIATELY when you turn a corner, giving you no chance at all to react. I honestly HATED wandering around the mines in this game for this one single design choice. It totally wrecks my enjoyment of the game. I don't mind fighting tough enemies, but watching 1/3 of my non-regenerating shield disappear because there is ONE enemy shooting me point blank the moment I turn a corner is something that I just can't forgive this game for. I mean, I can take out a room with like 20 or 30 droids without taking a single hit... only to have 1/3 of my shield taken out by ONE droid like that? For God's sake, at least give the robot a small pause before it starts to shoot. Even on a multiplayer game, theres always a small reaction time when players turn a corner and bump into each other. But no, these droids shoot INSTANTLY. Tell you what, how about you just remove the droid and delete my shield with a few lines of code instead huh?

Not many games in the 90s held my attention quite as much as Descent! The tension, the claustrophobia, the intense atmosphere combined with frightening AI and crazy level design.

Would 100% recommend! This game has come so far in such little time, really looking forward to the finished product. Keep up the good work!

2 : Its created by a team that licenced the name and even had the cheek to include original Descent footage in there launch trailer to trick buyers as if they contributed! (This has since been removed but still, it‚Äôs a dirty tactic that‚Äôs obviously caused them some shade) 

So my conclusion, this is the spiritual successor to Descent in every sense of the word!

I'm not, and never was, a ""Triple-D"" (Devout-Descent-Disciple) - I admired the concept, but simply didn't fall in love with 6DOF back in the 90's. 

There are enough reviews from ""Triple-D's"" here on Steam as well as the Overload forums, that virtually everything positive about Overload has already been said - so what can I add as an apparent ""pagan""?

For those gamers that perhaps have either never indulged in a 6DOF affair, or have dipped their toes in, but found the temprature somewhat uncomfortable, Overload is a breath of fresh air - because it works flawlessly and is absolutely accessible in a very minimalistic way ! When it comes to gaming that involves wreaking explosive havoc on any form of enemy by means of an impressive incendiary arsenal, there are some critical factors that must be in place to hook me and keep me coming back for more: minimal time spent in config/setup menus, pitch-perfect and responsive controls, ambience and immersion (art-style, sound, lighting), simple and compelling gameplay. I was having fun with Overload within 10 minutes in much the same way that ID games captivated me back in the 90's - all of the ingredients were there!

Challenge mode alone is currently worth the price of admission, although the MP component (available in 2018?) will hopefully provide a few game modes similar to UT3 (i.e. bot matches) thereby providing eons of fun for years to come. 

Again, for anyone relatively new to this genre, but with a love of FPS's, this won't disappoint, especially given the support  for various control devices ! You certainly don't need to be a ""Triple-D"" or a flight-sim genius to enjoy this high octane, easily accessible, addictive arcade shooter and at this point, it's hard to pinpoint any significant negative aspects of the game. 

UPDATE 08 SEP: 
There have been a few build releases in the interim adding new weapons (timebomb), new CM maps (Blizzard - probably one of the best thus far) and overall game balance adjustments (some good, some not so good) . Overall, still highly recommended, although it's likely that a truly well balanced and well honed CM mode won't be seen until much further along in the dev cycle.

UPDATE 15 DEC: 
An additional CM map has now been added (Backfire), leadeboard scores have been completely reset, and further balance adjustments have been made. Balance however still appears to be an issue in Challenge Mode, particularly with a select few of the bot enemies (Reavers) as well as the RNG, which can at times be quite frustrating in ""grinding"" for that perfect run. Hopefully, they'll find that ""sweet spot"" in the next 3 or months leading up to final release.

UPDATE 18/07/18: 
This remains without a shadow of a doubt my absolute ""go-to"" game for sheer visceral excitement. Challenge Mode is definitely my vice and I'm hoping for some superlative killer community generated CM levels in the near future ....perhaps even co-op challenge mode will materialise at some point (I'd personally drop $$$ to see that come to fruition) ?

Avoid this game carsick people, or don't be a puss and play this, it rocks
this game was decently optimized at release as it ran 100+fps on FX and RX470 OC'ed with all toggled except ambient occlusion (NVIDIA) and all maxed out except SSR in the 120-150fps range using Ryzen and Vega 64.
A 1080ti/i7 user should get locked 200fps maxed easily - this game is made in Unity and some patches may cause slight stutters, but the gameplay is immersive enough to tolerate it.

I've played Descent 1 - 3 since 1994, an Overload feels like Descent again.

Overload even improved the automap with the heatmap, at the end of the level you
can look at the whole level and it also shows where you killed bots (red dot) and 
where you took damage (blue dot).

The enemy bots show intelligent behaviour and there are several types already,
I very much like the close combat bot that charges you with two sawblades.

The controls also work very well. I play with a 3 axis joystick for turning and 
a keyboard for sliding, you have the option to map a key for slide toggle which
lets you slide left-right and up-down with the joystick just like the original Descent
had (this feature is sadly missing in Descent: Underground).

What this team has done over this past year is mind blowing.  The care and love they have for this game is obvious.  This early access proccess has been the most enjoyable that I've participated in and this is the best gaming community I've had the pleasure of being a part of.  We've all been waiting 20+ years for this.  Well, here it is.  Buy it.


I just finished my first playthrough of the story.....It was far beyond my expectations.  Even after seeing what these developers can do for the past year, I wasn't ready.  This is so. damn. good.  Every second was enjoyable.  Every level was a blast.  All the new enemies are great additions and the story was excellent.  I found 0 of the secret levels on my first playthrough (serioiusly).  I didn't explicitly look for them, but thats how well hidden they are lol.  

I put nearly 80 hours into the MP beta for the 3 or so weeks I was in it.  I think that should tell ya how I feel about that aspect of the game.  It's fantastic and has become my go-to multiplayer experience.  

Challenge Mode is what I sunk nearly 140 hours into during the EA process.  It is simply excellent (seem to be using synonyms of this word a lot lol).  

Check out the Playable Teaser.  See how you feel.  I will see you in the mines afterwards ;).

Early Access Review:

Like everyone before me has said, if you have fond memories of Descent, this game is certainly for you.  I ended up purchasing the game as soon as I played through the demo level for the first time.  Twas love at first play.
The controls feel great.  The level design is great (from what i've seen so far).  The map design is great (seriously, this is how you make a player map).  The sound effects are great.  The music is great.  The enemy design is awesome.  The weapons feel really meaty and fun to use.  The game overall just FEELS good, ya know?  Doesnt hurt that it runs flawlessly on my rig.  Maybe I'm hitting the nostalgia feelings hard, but I am in love with this already.  Can't wait to see where the devs take it.

*update*  controls - I just purchased a HOTAS setup the other day and this game works beautifully with it.  There is no going back to m+kb after having experienced this game with a HOTAS.  Thats not to say the m+kb contols arent phenomenal, they are, but wow is this game a blast with a joystick and throttle.   This is probably the best EA purchase I've made.  The game is brilliant.

** Now playing with dual joysticks.  EXCELLENT.

*****Thought I should comment on the dev's.  These guys are awesome.  Consistent and reliable communication.  Meaningful monthly updates!

And their mark on the history of Online gaming deserves to be noted.   For those of you whipper snappers who aren't in the know, 

These guys played a huge part in the creation of Online gaming as we know it.   I dont want to get into a history lesson, however - this development team in my opinion, are the creme de la creme.  Throughout the early access release I have been nothing but impressed with these guys and the work they've put into the game. The amount of features they've added and adjusted in support of the PC gaming community has been massive. Controller support, VR support, TrackIR support, if your kitchen sink had a usb cable you could plug it in.  Ok.. exaggeration* 

That being said - if you were a fan of the Descent series - This game is definitely for you.  You'll be able to relive the glory days these youngsters just don't know about. 

If you're new to the genre, this game is ultimately a shooter.  If you know your way around a mouse and keyboard, you'll be able to adapt to this.  Just think of it like - not only can you move forward/backward/left/and right. You can go up and down as well.   Congratulations you can pilot a spaceship and begin unleashing your wrath on a hoarde of killer robots, blow up the reactor and escape the mines.  Oh, and don't worry, the dizziness goes away eventually. 

This game has a fun factor that is 10 out of 10, and the dev team has shown interest in listening to opinions that keep it that way.  

Don't believe me? Try out the free demo.. just search for the overload teaser on the Steam store.   Just get a feel of how that flies, and how the game runs.   Now imagine doing that playing against other people in maps with multiple exits in every room, where you have the option to fly away and try to pick which door the enemy least suspects you to come out of. 

As the devs work to release the game on console, I have to say, if you enjoy GOOD shooters, and PC gaming in general... BUY THIS GAME. I'm not popular enough to get paid for saying that.   The involvement from the dev teams throughout the development of Overload has earned that from me without charge. 

There are too many words for me to type.. go download the free teaser.. get a feel for the ship. Think of it as a shooter, and have fun.   If you want to plug in an expensive hotas, rudder pedals and the like, or stick to your mouse + KB for that pinpoint accuracy only a mouse can provide.

Plays and feels EXACTLY the same as legacy Descent 1/2, except much more streamlined features and absolutely BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN graphics and interface.  The weapons are definite improvements over the original descent designs while being somewhat familiar in feel.  You can tell they've tapped into modern computing power which enabled some more advanced mechanics and visuals.  THIS is how video games were meant to be played.  Nobody to this day has made a combat game like Descent EXCEPT for this team, and this title perfectly brings back the complete smooth 3-dimensional control combat mechanics.

The biggest CON for this title at the moment is the utter lack of multiplayer PVP (local LAN support especially important for those 90's Descent fanboys out there).  I read that they are promising a multiplayer expansion in 2018.  I can't wait.  But I guess that gives me plenty of time to grind through the single player content up to the highest difficulty.

Good luck dev's, stay vigilent, keep up the excellent work.

There's definitely nostalgia factor because I loved the original descent games even though I was terrible at them as a kid.

The challenge modes and the demo levels play extremely well and are very fun. 

Only criticisms so far:

1. I can't play this effectively with a steam controller or gamepad. The controls functioned much better with a mouse and keyboard.
2. The explosion particles are too big at times. I know  this sounds weird, but sometimes I'd waste rounds or rockets on a robot I had already destroyed. 

Good things:
1. Challenge mode feels finished and makes me feel like the narrative missions will be worth the wait.
2. The controls, motion, and weapons feel right. The projectile weapons feel a bit underpowered due to their reduced range but they still feel like they have impact.
3. The robot designs I've seen so far are very reflective of the original source material. I love the boxy utilitarian look they have -- they look like robots in Descent should. 
4. The ""find the exit, find the reactor, blow it up and get out"" gameplay cycle shown in the demo level plays exactly as I would like.
5. The map system is good.
6. Using keyboard and wasd to play this feels great and feels very natural.
7. It runs great on my old graphics card  -- a GTX 960 4GB -- at a consistent 40-60+.",1491596116,1491596116,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I really see and feel Descent with this game, the gameplay, the visuals and the music really make me think of the original Descent. I am most impressed with this and am glad I have supported development by purchasing this game in Early Access. I am not a fan of Descent: Underground, which ended up as an average(ish) MMO and does not deserve the Descent Branding. Overload really should be Descent IV.  at the time of this review this game is still very early in development, but so far I am impressed.  

The controls feel fluid and rock solid, and the gameplay mechanics and physics are well....   Descent like. for want of a better word.

This is a great way to relive the glory days of Descent in a modern form.  
Like a true Descent game Singleplayer is the focus.  Multiplayer will be added later.  
Unlike Descent:  Underground, which is an MMO and the only news about a story campaign is ""we're working on it"" which is wearing thin.

So get Overload, rather than Descent: Underground if a true successor to the Descent Lineage is what your trigger fingers are craving for!",1491048589,1491050539,True,1,1,0.502222239971160889,0,True,False,True,False,,,

VR support is a given, and indeed it works extremely well in VR.

Remember back in 94 when you heard about that VFX1 VR headset that worked with Descent, but nobody could actually afford? It really wasn't that great actually, but man were we eager to play this in proper VR. Now you can.

If you liked Descent, this comes highly recommended.

Update October 2017: The latest update added another campaign level, more robots and overall feels like an extremely polished game. And even the escape sequence is back! If you want a proper sequel, this is it.

Update December 2017: My performance woes in VR have been resolved by the latest updates. The new maps are a treat and I love the timebomb gadget, which is a nice throwback to F.E.A.R.

I just purchased a new speaker system. Its like I was deaf before. :-)
I cannot believe the quality of audio while playing this game, aside from the panic, stress, ""HOLY MOSES Where did THAT come from"" and ""Dammit!"" as I spin in yet another golden  starburst of defeat. 
The noise of this game is astounding. From the weapons to the crunch of metal impacts to their death-grunts. Horroble creature noises as if something was alive in the shell of the exploding Robot and this wierd really spooky gutteral throat-splutter. Creepy.

The craft are gorgeous to look at and their controls are veryr ealistic. Enough drift to feel youre flying and hovering and enough manouvrability to swing in and out of obstacles. 
The environments are thoughtfully created.  We've all seen digital worlds from laboratories to sunny wastelands but this is a kind of mixture of rocky tunneling as well made by ""something burrowing!!!"" and hi tech arenas.

Only one thing I would like included. I enjoy the surprise of these Bots springing out at me and the ""heart leap"" as they appear and blast me to hell BUT..... I would like them to hum, whine, whirr or clatter as they ambled about chasing me. Not just whine deafeningly with a circular saw chiseling off my shields. 

If you remember Descent of olde, this is just like that only better. All the good points emphasised. 
If you dont know what Descent was because you're too young.... you're in for a mean surprise. 
It's already money well spent and it isn't finished yet.

For me it was one of those games I fondly remembered as one of the best ever. A game that I thought had always been vastly under rated and I would rave about it to anyone I could over the years. Descent was so damn fun and multiplayer was amazing. Hiding upside down on the roof of a a tunnle waiting for your victum to fly underneath you then drop down like a gd spider king. Awesome! When steam released 1,2, and 3 I was overjoyed. When Descent Underground was announced I was again overjoyed and had high hopes. Well since it's beta release I've been disappointed. Not that it's a bad game, but it just didn't feel like the descent I remembered. In fact lots of other companies have tried to recreate 6dof but none have felt ""right"".

Until now. Overload from the orginial creators of Descent absolutely feels ""right"". It's actually superb, perfect, excelent, amazing, and awesome. It is the perfect game all over again. It's not just a remake with updated graphics, I mean it is that but they've really topped themselves here. It's just like original Descent but fresh and new. I think it feels a bit darker in tone than the orginial. Just a bit though not too much. A little more hard scifi serious but still very much Descent like. The robots are 10x better with 10x better A.I. Each bot is different with different movement and attacks. The level design is 10x better, they're bigger, badder, and prettier with more floors and more twists and turns, and more secrets. The graphics are also 10x better with more partical effects and cooler lighting. I was really impressed with how well the caverns were done. They're pitch black. You have to use your flares to navigate and when you light them up they're beautiful. The flares shoot ahead of you for a bit then slowly die out prompting you to launch another. Meanwhile enemy bots are hunting you. You get a jump scare when they pop up behind you, above you, below you, etc. Omg what a start. If this is just the tip of the iceburg we are in for one hell of a game here.

This is the game I've wished and hoped for for the last 20 years. All I can say to the developers is thank you, thank you, thank you so much. I can't wait for the full release.

Its basically my favorite game, revived ! Its Descent, with better sounds, better graphics, better music, better everything, in smooth, 1080p, 60fps goodness!! I LOVE the voice actors (one of the the new Doom game voices, ""every doctors voice"" in half life)

WINGNUT IS BACK (hes not called that, but i call him wingnut)
and boy does he help in terms of finding the objectives. BUT, dont rush through the levels as they are SWAMPED with secret areas withholding goodies for you to find!

Levels get increasingly more difficult (as is to be expected) and it feels great cause you get to upgrade your ship. 10 / 10 , this is my game for 2018, my early bday present!

This was my review prior to release
posted: 24 Jun, 2017

Its being made by parts of the old Parallax team! Unlike the other Decent ""clones"" and ""wannabes"" out there, this one has a large chunk of the original team building it. and booooooooy does it show.

The reviews here all agree ""its JUST like the old Descent"".
Indeed it is! It FEELS like Descent, it looks like a more modern version of Descent, and it even SOUNDS like Descent, music AND sound effects! and of course, the good ol ""find keys to open doors"", to ""find the reactor"" to, ""find the exit"" procedure. aahh nostalgic goodness! (when enemy locks on to you, its the same sound from back in the day <3   )
(is NOT the case anymore)

i for one LOVE this game so far. oh haha.... and my GOD is it cool in VR. Back in the Descent days, in the ""ms dos setup part"" of the game, there were options to use ""VR goggles"", and I was always sad not being able to try it. Well folks.... with the VIVE....... its unbelievable!!!

This game is fun, fast paced, balls to to wall 6 degrees of freedom, robot destroying FPS. I highly recommend this game. 

This game has a lot of difficulty options, enough that can be good for any player of any skill.

The AI is phenominal, with each type of AI having unique personalites in their combat styles.

Also they will be releasing a level editor for this game, so you can make your own levels and play other peoples levels, so that can add endles more fun.

The music is phenomenal.  The music is done by the same people who did the music for Descent 1-3, and really adds to the ambiance as well as the intensitity of the fights.  There is also a lot of different pieces of music, I honestly can't remember any piece of music repeating from one level to the next, and it even changes to a new piece while in the levels at times.

I use KB/Mouse, and the controls are fantastic.  For me it feels just like Descent, even the ships acts the same way, you do feel like you are in a ship when controling it.  You can change any of the controls to whatever key you want.

There are many secrets through out each level and I really enjoy looking for them.  I especially love it when the game toys with you by showing you a secret from the other side of a grate, and you have to go on a hunt to find how to get to it.

As you go through the levels you can find upgrade points, this allows you to upgrade your ship and weapons in various ways.  You will not be able to upgrade everything to the fullest, so you kind of have to pick and choose what you want to have the most upgraded.  Though there is New Game+, so you can probably get everything up eventually, though I am not sure about that, other than there is new game+

Along with the single player campaign, which the storyline was written by the Freespace 2 writer and it is a great storyline, there is also challenge mode.  There are more than 12 maps and different modes for each maps to fight through, gaining experience points to upgrade your Challenge mode ship/weapons.  There is also a leader board so you can see how you are doing against other people.  I love the challenge maps cause they are great for shorter bursts of gameplay depending on what kind of time you have.  The challenge mode maps are not the same map as the campaign maps, which really adds to the variety.

The maps nearly feel like a sprawling maze, and given that you have 6 degrees of freedom you can easily get lost or disoriented.  There is a guide bot in the game if you want a little help to get where you need to get to, though it will not help you find secrets.

The sound effects in the game are very satisfying.  Each weapon sounds different from another, the robots explode with a nice ""boom"" sound to go along with it.

In the single player campaign there are data points to pick up that give you audio logs that give you backstory of what happened on the map you are on.  These adds a lot of the storyline and I really enjoy it.

Overall I highly recommend the game.  If you loved Descent series, then chances are you'll love this game, cause it really does feel like playing Descent but with upgraded graphics.",1490079538,1528087696,True,2,0,0.382248550653457642,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Overload gets the old Descent feeling way better. That's for several reasons:

Overload's gameplay is way more fun. The action takes place mostly in close combat, where navigation is key without the game being too hectic. Your weapons have this Ooomph that just feels right. Also the weapons have a good variety (I love the Creeper mines and the Driller cannon!). Enemy's have good recognizable silhouettes and an already pretty good variety. Although the levels are small in this Early Access version, they are well structured and despite one section in the demo level that's labyrinth-like have a clear layout where it's hard to lose track.

The graphics are great. Yeah, they are more simple than in other games, but that's for the better in this kind of genre. When your action is fast paced and your orientation is difficult because of the six degrees of freedom, it is best to keep the visuals simple to not overexert the eyes (as Descent Underground does). It has style and atmosphere and serves the gameplay - and for me that's far more important than fancy shaders and trillions of polygons on screen.

My only cons thus far:
- I encountered several crashes
- there is only one single player level
- there are only four challenge levels
- there is no multiplayer

Minor Updates 25 April 2017, Version 0.3 Build 30
Disclaimer: Kickstarter Backer.

Alpha version number, late beta playability.
‚ÄòSurprisingly polished‚Äô would be an accurate summary of the game in its current state, with the majority of features at a stage that nears fully completed. Inputs are smooth and customizable, there‚Äôs a robust roster of primary and secondary weapons- each with a role and unique properties- an expansive number of robot enemies that complement each other, and very slick graphics.

Of particular noteworthiness are the enemies: they explode spectacularly which makes the so-far central wave survival mode visually rewarding, and each is unique in not only design and weapons but also behavior. For Descent veterans, you won‚Äôt find much that you don‚Äôt expect here, but if you enjoyed Descent, you‚Äôll enjoy Overload.

Currently the game features a [s]single[/s] pair of ‚Äòreal levels‚Äô, which mimics the gameplay of the original Descents 1 & 2; fly through the mines, shoot some robots, grab a couple weapons, then blow up the reactor and hightail it out of dodge. The original sample level is short and to the point, but features the familiar claustrophobic levels and secrets aplenty. The second sample level, said to be the third mission of story mode, is much expanded and quite long. It features additional mechanics such as robot spawners, locked doors, and rescuable hostages/cryopods. It also hints at an upgrade system with 'upgrade points' scattered about the level, but currently there doesn't seem to be a system for using them - presumably this is a feature that will occur between levels in story mode.
The premiere game mode is currently a wave survival mode, which is as straight forward as it gets: kill robots until they kill you, for glory and personal/online leaderboard high score. While the mode is nothing more than ‚Äòkill things‚Äô there is room for improvement with evidence of several systems which might be leveraged to add nuance to the mode, and you can earn (temporary, for the current life/attempt) weapon upgrades by reaching certain milestones. In addition to the endless style of the wave survival, there is also a timed survival style, where you must last five minutes against a much more aggressive spawn rate of enemies. There is no overt functional difference between the two modes other than the time limit. There are only [s]four[/s] six maps for the wave survival mode.

The game runs impressively well on a GTX 860M, 16GB RAM, and I7 6410HQ 2.5Ghz quad core. Though I don‚Äôt have the graphics maxed out, it looks plenty pretty with medium textures and normal post-processing options. I‚Äôve had no issues with stuttering or slowdown.

However, the game does have some particular shortfalls.
The graphics options menu is lacking in granularity/separate options, [s]and I haven‚Äôt seen support for 21:9 monitors, which is my desktop, but I don‚Äôt have access to that currently; the game may tailor available options based on detected capabilities. I will update this review to account for new information should that prove the case.[/s] FOV also maxes out at 80 degrees. Though the HUD is much improved from the Playable Teaser, I feel it has additional room for improvement. I find the music is also somewhat lacking, but that‚Äôs a pretty personal opinion and your mileage will vary greatly.
Update: Game DOES support 21:9 ratio, and it plays very well while doing so. HUD and menu is natively scaled, without stretching or other unflattering effects.

My overall recommendation for the game in its current state is: ‚ÄúRecommend Sale Purchase‚Äù.  Though the game is amazingly polished and very playable, there is not quite $25 worth of content at this immediate point in time. 
However, keep in mind that Early Access titles are investments, and if you act on faith here you will likely have an excellent product at the end of development. I personally look forward to the finished game and have confidence in the developer to deliver on their stated goals.

This game is absolutely amazing for the fact that it really feels like I'm back in Descent, but with cutting edge VR technology and current day graphics. It's simply incredile. Smooth controls, lots of input options, well polished UI's for VR, an immersive feel, good enemy AI (much more mature that two other current 6dof shooters I've tried; those being Sublevel Zero and Descent Underground) and a far more ""complete"" feel to the single player experience.

I'm hoping this project continues, because I do look forward to playing a long, grueling solo campaign through as many levels as you can toss at me. Titan enemies (bosses) in large arenas could also be a plus to the current level-end ""destroy the core"" type mechanic. 

So far, excellent. I truly hope this project comes to completion, because the core elements are there, and they work better than any other games in this category.

As it stands, it is an excellent successor of Descent.

The game plays just like the original: Navigate 3D environments in a space ship, collect items and weapons to progress, blast robots to bits, and then blast the reactor to bits... oh, and escape, or you'll also be blown to bits.

The individual robots are very smart, especially in the challenge mode. They'll go and cut you off while you are running through a tight corridor, hunt you in packs, approach you from behind and grab you... The fights are really tense, especially on higher difficulties.

The graphics and the overall design is a win as well. The environments are detailed enough to be attractive, but simple enough to be navigated. The levels look distinct from each other, but a little bit of ""same"" feeling *may* be there, perhaps after a quite while of play time. I connect this issue to the state of the game right now, as there are not much levels yet... and these levels are very well played, I never felt bored in repeated playthroughs. In fact, their pace is so frantic, especially on higher difficulty challenge levels, that one doesn't think about graphics that much.

The individual robots can be recognized at a glance, and the damage system is ok (maybe you can dismember the bots, without destroying them? Imagine a bot, which has one arm destroyed and is also on fire, doing a kamikaze...). They feel quite different from each other: the little pesky ones, the big bad rocket platforms, the maniacal Shredder with its charge attack and distinct scream (which will be in my nightmares, along with a certain bot from the first Descent. You know which &%+ Wheeezer I'm talking about.). Excellent work.

The weapons are designed well so far, and they are very fun to use. They have distinct strengths and weaknesses, making them situational weapons: There is the starting laser, dealing low/moderate damage with moderate firing rate, a few shotgun-like guns using matter or energy for close quarters, a charging weapon that deals high damage with low refire, dumbfire missiles, homing missiles, missile pods that fire tons of missiles very rapidly, mines that are excellent for shooting around that corner, and that big one going with an extra-large kaboom. And there is yet to come (I'm sure they will be great and tested well, without being TOO annoying, right? RIGHT?? I'm looking at YOU, designer of those !&% HOMING FLASH MISSILES!!! My EYES man, HAVE MERCY! - Good programming, by the way). You can try each of them in challenge mode, where you are dealt with different weapons each time you start a new game...

Speaking of weapons, you can also ""Bump"" into the robots, like a melee attack. You can finish off weakly arnored bots like this. You can also use this to gain an additional boost as you are boosting. One thing, however, this bumping ""locks"" into the nearby enemies, which isn't good if you are trying to dodge them - you get smashed right into them instead, sometimes with additional bots surrounding you. I'd like an option at the very least, to turn this locking feature off, we can smash our way without it.

One thing I noticed that the environment doesn't get damaged...  Granted, we're in early access, so this aspect might be added later. Still, I looked for destroyable screens everywhere...

The interface is great, you can tell your ship's status at a glance. Only a minor alteration I'd suggest, maybe a bit larger fonts, especially for the central armor counter near the reticle... It is somewhat hard to read :)

EDIT, 20.03.2017: Re-reading this, I realize I forgot a major part out: The sound and the music, and both are over the top. The sound design is fantastic: the weapons sound deadly, and the robots sound even deadlier. The only nuisance was the automap on/off effect, it sounded a little too close to an actual robot hunting you...

But the most shining thing in this game is the music, with the one in the 4th challenge map (Centrifuge) being my favorite. In fact, I played that challenge map over and over, just to keep listening it :).

Overall, the minds behind the game are putting up an excellent job. It is expected, since it is a team of veterans, the creators of the original game(s), as well as great mission sets for those games. I'm confident that they will keep up the good work, and I cannot wait for the rest of this game's development... especially THAT level editor!

I recommend this game with confidence in this team. Godspeed, Revival productions!

Potential f√ºr ein tolles Spiel, aber beim Backen kann immer was schief gehen und wie viele vielversprechende Spiele wurden eingestellt, oder verbugged und supportlos auf die Spielerwelt losgelassen.

Nun in diesem Fall hat es sich gelohnt! Als Descent Fan der ersten Stunde - ja ich bin so alt ;) -  muss ich sagen: sehr, sehr geil!

Die Stimmung kommt sofort wieder auf, enge G√§nge, verwinkelte Maps und Horden von Gegnern. 

Grafik: gef√§llt! L√§uft maximiert sehr fl√ºssig in WQHD unabh√§ngig von Gegnerhorden und Strahlengewitter (i7 3770K @ 4,3 GHz, GTX 1070). Die Optik gef√§llt und passt zum Setting.  Licht- und Partikeleffekte passen auch.

Steuerung:
mit Maus und Tastatur ist recht pr√§zise mit dem Abstrich, dass das Wechseln der Ausrichtung und das Wechseln der Bewaffnung/Raketen nat√ºrlich nicht ganz so intuitiv ist. Aber das Ausrichten der eigenen Position und Optik ist definitiv einfacher als in den alten Teilen.
Mit XBOX 360 Controller funktioniert das Spiel fabelhaft. Die Steuerung ist absolut intuitiv! Links- und Rechtsrolle, Steigen und Sinken, Weapon Slot und Raketen durchschalten bzw. beides einsetzen. Super!

Mir gef√§llt sehr gut, dass wenn man ann√§hernd parallel zum Untergrund ist, sich das Schiff selbst ausrichtet, das macht den Verwirr-Faktor wesentlich geringer und erleichtert die Navigation durch die Level

Soundeffekte und Musik: Sounds passen, Musik war auch da :D Die Hintergrundbeschallung ist mir im Kampf-Stress weder positiv noch negativ aufgefallen unn das reicht. :)

Spielmodi: 
Kampagne: Das erste der Level der Kampagne ist noch √ºberschaubar von der Gr√∂√üe, anfangs √ºbersichtlich und dann ziemlich verwinkelt. Wenn man glaub, man hat es ges√§ubert, kommt doch noch von irgendwo ein versteckter Gegner vor. Macht absolut Spa√ü.
Challenge: Endlosgegnerdeathmatch in verschiedenen Maps mit Leaderboard. Mir gef√§llts, eignet sich auch gut um den Kampf gegen √úberzahl zu trainieren und verschiedene Waffen zu testen.

Zuerst hatte ich die freie Demo angespielt, da schwante mir schon √úbles. Diese Early Access Version hat bereits alle meine Zweifel weggewischt! F√ºr Fans der Descentserie oder schneller, verwirrender Shooter absolut empfehlenswert! Bis das Spiel mit Kampagne ver√∂ffentlicht wird, werde ich mir die Zeit im Challengemode vertreiben.

Made by the original creators of the Descent games of the 90's, you get exactly what you would expect from these stalwart developers. Well designed, tight, beautiful environments. Engaging and robust AI. Interesting and varied enemy types with a spectacular design that is both classic and modern. Great audio and sound design, and stunning new graphics that ensnare and captivate the auditory and visual senses. All that and their classic, pristine Six Degrees-of-Freedom movement system that made their previous games some of the best games of the 90's. Combat is as challenging as ever with more enemy types than the playable teaser and demos. Giving you an invigorating experience as you attempt to fly through superbly designed, tightly packed caverns and beautifully simplistic star base styled rooms. All while trying to dominate a wide variety intense robotic enemies that have a very challenging and sinister AI at higher levels of difficulty.

The UI is smooth and clean. Power-ups and weapons have simple yet nicely designed meshes and textures, that fit the world space and overall game design very well. The controls are fantastic and fit in with all their previous classics; They are quick and easy to learn and will have you flying through the ""Labyrinth"" of level design with precision in no time.

The only problem that I even have with the game is that it did not get its full release this month. However that being said I am truly grateful they decided to release it as an early access game for the time being, giving everyone a chance to experience the wonderment this game has to offer. Plus I would much rather have a game months from now that is complete and well thought out than get a game that released too early with game breaking day one bugs and the feeling of incompleteness that plagues so many of the modern games released currently.

This game will not immediately seem engaging to everyone. It is not an open world game like so many of the other games of the modern  day. It won't have huge numbers of side quests(which is good in my opinion as so many modern side quests are useless fetch quests.) It is a classic arena styled game with simple objectives. In comparison to all other contenders of 6 DOF this one in my opinion shines out among the many for its precise controls, engaging game play, and well thought out design. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good arena flight game as it definitely rings out among the rest. Give it a try and stick with it for an hour to get comfortable with the controls and I guarantee you will be having a blast for hours to come.

Pros:
‚Ä¢	Smooth Classic Controls
‚Ä¢	Engaging Compact Level Design
‚Ä¢	Superb AI
‚Ä¢	Great Sound Design and Visuals
‚Ä¢	Menacing Robot Design
‚Ä¢	The Classic 6 DOF Shooter
‚Ä¢	I Was Given Early Access Free as a Backer(Subjective as it only applies to me)

Cons:
‚Ä¢	It isn't a full release
‚Ä¢	Splash Damage feels like it needs an increase for some weapons and with some enemy types
‚Ä¢	Damage from some enemies feels like it needs more balancing on higher difficulties
‚Ä¢	Some super robots feel far less menacing than the heavily armored robots, ie they don't feel quite as super as I expected

I will continue to update this review as the game progresses through early access, on it's full release and have a final update with the release of multiplayer. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I do and thanks for reading my review!

EDIT: I was going to continue to update this review but I have pretty summed it up here. The only thing I can say is it continues to get better with every update. The Challenge Mode continues to get new invigorating levels and the bots feel far more balanced than in the early release and updates. The story missions released are engaging and fun, with the classic style of Descent gameplay taken to a whole new level of visual prowess. This definitely is a ""Revival"" of Descent that's been ""Overload""ed with tighter controls, more challenge, better graphical fidelity, and the best small team Indie Developement can hope for powering it to the new generation. This is Early Access done right. Can't wait for the full release and see the full potential this game has to offer.

OVERLOAD represents a return to form for REVIVAL Productions, composed of those who created a series of games that served as Overloads' spiritual predecessor - The DESCENT series of games. Overload taps into the best of each Descent title, and the team more than manages to create a new experience (the rights to the Descent name and content are, shall we say - messy) that is fully their own (notwithstanding their publishing deal with EA).

Games such as the new DOOM combine conteporary trimmings with oft-overlooked aspects that made games of yesteryear historical gems. Overload does this in spades in honoring Descent, with fast-paced gameplay, winding levels, and a plethora of weapons and enemies that are uniquely distinct and NOT generic. Wyverns are elusive critters, while bladed 'Shredders' charge at you with alarming regularity. Most bots go down easily, though in Challenge mode you'll encounter rarer 'Super' versions of these robots - an RPG convention that fits in well with Overload's action to keep you on your toes. Well, your WINGS - you're flying after all!

The levels are beautifully crafted, and even the few environments we've seen thus far feature much in the way of variety, while tying the game together as a whole thematically. I can't wait to see what other locales we'll visit - acid, ice, and even overgrown batthegrounds are all ripe for possibility. In traiditonal single-player sense, you're required to find a reactor, destory and thus 'overload' it and the mine, and escape with your life out of the exit. A tried and true callback to the original Descent games that never gets old since each reactor encounter has different, alternate and increasingly tough challenges and puzzles per map to ensure things remain changed up.

If you're a fan of FPS, flight sims, and even RPG's, you'll wanna check out Overload. And you're going to enjoy the ride.",1489509886,1489509886,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Gameplay is fluid and dynamic, simple and yet challenging. It's everything we've been wanting from 6DOF games, and now it is closer than ever to coming to fruition. 

If you yearn for the haydays of 6DOF, this game is for you.
If you played Descent 1, 2, or 3, and loved it (it MADE my childhood), this game is for you. 
If you like space shooters, this game is likely for you. 
If you appreciate Dev's that actually care about their customers/fans, this game is for you. 

I cannot think of one single complaint about the game. My only hope is that somehow the orginal Descent 1 & 2 engines could be run through Overload.....

10/10 game (esp. for EA). 

Congrats is in order to the dev team and the testers/backers who made this possible. Us old descenters owe you all a great deal of thanks :)

Right now there is training, a demo level, and a few challenges. If you buy now challenges is what you will be spending most of your time doing. 

For the challenges there are 2 modes, countdown and infinite. They are fairly similar, the one big difference being you die at the end of 5 minutes on countdown if you haven't blown up yet. There are 4 maps, each have some slightly different enemy sets I think. The maps are just about the right size- not so big that you will get lost, but large enough you feel like you have somewhere you can run too. There are also 4 difficulty levels and an additional level (Insane) that can be unlocked. Each of the challenge modes gets more difficult as time goes on - so with time even the lowest difficulty rookie mode becomes tough. You will see your score up on the global leader boards at the end of the challenge, as well as a summary of the enemies you killed, etc.

While there isn't many levels to play everything else feels like a finished game rather than something in early access. The levels, enemies, and attacks all look and sound great. It could use some changes to the default XBOX controller layout (the fire gun and missile buttons are right bumper and right trigger so you can only fire one at a time), but you can change them to your liking. You will most likely have to change the sensitivity of your mouse, but the mouse and keyboard default setup feels natural otherwise.

Overall the game doesn't have a ton of content at the moment, but it has the polish of a finished game. Releasing the challenge mode first though was a excellent idea, since they have great replayability for a small amount of content.

Therefore it plays and feels exactly like Descent brought up to date; great feeling, insane dogfights in mines against smart AI robots. It's not called Descent because someone else has the license now, but you wouldn't know it.

Although it feels highly polished and bug free, it's basically limited in content right now. There's a full single player campaign coming, but there's only a single example level available right now. The rest is single-player challenge mode: four maps against waves of bots, with leaderboards. It's all enormous fun and feels ""complete"", but it's only a taste of the final game. There's even a free Playable Teaser available which contains quite a bit of this initial Early Access release, so if you're on the fence perhaps try that first, but the devs are working on this now with content drops planned each month, so the difference will soon become highly apparent.

Buying Early Access can be risky. Will they deliver? Well, these are veteran devs with decades of industry experience (and the brains behind some of my favourite games). They clearly know how to manage a project, and so far they're on track albeit slightly behind the original schedule. I have complete faith. Oh, and this is very much single player only, although multiplayer is coming after the final full release.

The term ""spiritual successor"" can be pretty loosely defined, but let's get one thing straight: This is Descent 4 in all but name. Even better, it goes back to the template laid out by the first two Descent games, and captures the dense, labyrinthine level design packed with secrets, as well as the floaty, cramped zero-g combat. Even the visual design and sountrack are instantly recognizable throwbacks despite the added sheen. 

But this controls better than old-school Descent ever did, and the move to a modern control pad feels great. There are some added story elements, as well as an upgrade system, and some polish to the overall feel, but all of it feels like it fits with the old school, level-based formula, which hasn't been altered. 

On a negative note, the VR implementation seems to suffer from performance issues that force it to run in a reduced framerate with reprojection. I find it unusable. Don't buy this for VR, at least not right now.

PERFORMANCE:  On my laptop GTX 970m i7-6700hq it runs great with settings turned down but still really looks great!  Might have difficulty running on anything older than a GTX 760?

GAMEPLAY:  Action, suspense, and explosions!  AI is fun to play against (it better it's only singleplayer for now)

CONTROLS: If you have never played a game like this it might taking some getting used to, it feels great when you get the hang of it though!  

TLDR: Game is looking awesome and developers seem to be doing the series justice, support them!",1489465695,1489466005,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Designers for the original Descents have made a proper spiritual continuation, it looks and plays exactly as it should; you smash panels and parts off repurposed mining robots until they go fireworks, while they try to extract the meaty bit from your ships metal shell using various methods.

The controls are intuitive, the momentum physics behave as you would expect, the weapons have a solid feel to them (even the frickin laser beams) and each connecting hit gives a physics reaction and a pretty light show as reward.
The sound is great, the baddies sound suitably demonically possessed, the lighting is a real treat, accurate realtime shadows (something of a rarity these days for some reason) are on full display and it all sits together in a surprisingly atmospheric package.

You still get as disorientated as the original Descents and the screen fills with carnage quickly, but that's a positive in this reviewer's book. It may be early access, but these developers have actual pedigree and an impressive work ethic, if you genuinely enjoy a 6DOFFPS, you won't regret the purchase.

In any event, Overload is shaping up to be a fantastic spiritual successor to the Descent series. I play with mouse and keyboard, and the flight feels exactly right once I turn off mouse smoothing, turn mouse limiting to strong, and enable full trichording by pushing F8 in-game.

Right now there's a training mission, a campaign-style mission (blow up the reactor and get out!), two challenge modes across four extremely well-designed maps, and several highly-varied weapons and bots. They've also introduced a new physical smash attack, and there's no more badass feeling than smashing a superbot to scrap metal. There are five difficulty levels, with separate leaderboards for each, and the most difficult must be unlocked for each map; this challenge is sure to keep you coming back if you're the competitive type.

It's worth highlighting the variety of even just the four maps and weapons -- one map is bright with relatively open spaces, another is arranged in a geometric pattern of tunnels and medium-sized rooms, and the other two are full of dark, foreboding tunnels. Because of the different spaces and lighting, each map encourages the use of different weapons and tactics -- the Reflex Cannon probably won't be your first choice on open Syrinx, but it bounces around in deadly fashion in the narrow tunnels of Labyrinth and Caverns.

The development team is also using dynamic lighting throughout each map. This choice gives the darker maps an exquisitely creepy atmosphere, as you can see the bots' headlights growing more intense on the wall around a corner as they draw near.

The bots themselves are diverse and interactive. They have a variety of behaviors, from swarming and chasing to running to (as far as I can tell!) predicting your escape and trying to cut you off. They're extremely satisfying to hit and blow up, as they get knocked back, lose pieces of debris, and exhibit a variety of explosions. Above all, they're *tough*! 

To top it all off, they're supporting Linux natively, and the game runs fantastically on my Arch Linux machine with an I5 processor and GTX 750 Ti GPU with proprietary drivers.

I almost never write reviews, and the few that do exist are in response to the creation of games that reach the highest pinnacle of worth.

I could expound without end upon the quality of work they've produced, here.  Anyone remotely familiar with the concept of 6DoF shooters knows what they're in for.  And if you already played any of the Descent games in your younger years, then... well, let's face it - that's most likely why you're here in the first place.  No need to read any more of my words.  Go get your fix.

For those new to the genre, the game concept is simple.  It hearkens back to the original Doom/Quake model (and Descent model) where you need keys to open doors to progress to the next area of the level, with occasional boss mobs or hard-to-find treasures mixed in.  Where the real challenge comes in is in the controls and the lack of gravity or an up/down.  At this stage, the videos included with the game can portray it a lot better than I can.  Just know that, as the devs who made this are the same who brought us Descent, you're in very good hands.  Very.  Good.  Hands.

The result of Revival's efforts, a fast-paced zero-G first-person shooter worthy of the genre, has delivered all that you could ever hope for in a spiritual successor to Descent and more.  The only feature missing that some may lament the loss of is co-op play.  Everything else from the originals is here, along with the addition of Challenge Mode, an extra gameplay mechanic that quite a few Overload players have embraced and enjoyed.  Graphics, sound, music, gameplay, controls support, VR support, and developer support are all top-notch.  The price is reasonable, and the resultant product is a significant value.  A free level editor is on the way, there's already talk of recreating favorite multiplayer content, and there's even been experiments with porting some of the original content from Descent 1 and 2 into the Overload engine.  See the 12-hour launch day live stream on Twitch for examples of this in action.

If you enjoyed any of the Descent games, there is no question that you will enjoy this.  If you enjoy games that require a higher than normal degree of skill to master, this will do nicely.  And if you enjoy a mulitplayer experience with a lot more head games, prediction, chaos, and memorable moments, look no further.",1489451780,1528254940,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

While it's not a perfect game, and the multiplayer component in particular is disappointing compared to the best that Descent 2 offered (mainly thanks to the enormous variety of community-made maps it received), the single player and challenge modes are all incredibly fun. It's also one of the best seated VR games I've played; it's up there with Elite Dangerous and Thumper.

Revival Productions went above and beyond with their development efforts on this game and I really hope it paid off for them. Throughout the Kickstarter alpha period and Early Access they were quick to respond to feedback and even made the effort to port the game not only to Mac but also Linux. They also included custom support for many niche input devices as well as VR, something few developers put in the effort for.

Don't be scared off by that Unity logo. Unity gets a bad reputation because it's free and and it's easy for first-timers to work with, which results in a lot of very amateurish products being made with it. In the hands of a talented developer it's capable of amazing things, and Overload is a showcase of Unity at its best. It's a beautiful game that performs well on a wide variety of hardware, though Unity's famous engine inefficiency does keep it from performing as well as I'd like with the highest settings. It's a challenge to keep a steady 120+ FPS even on a 1080 Ti and overclocked i7-4790K. My ageing CPU is probably the limiting factor there. Unreal or a custom in-house engine might've alleviated this, but would've likely also added unrealistic cost and time to what I imagine was already a lean development cycle considering the game barely met its minimum Kickstarter funding goal.

I highly recommend Overload to anyone looking for a quality game in the nearly abandoned 6DOF shooter genre.

If there is ever a grand list of exceptions - this should be on it. 

The original Descent games transformed my perception of what an action game could be. They expertly avoided pitfalls of modern games - the pacing was dramatic, the tension was visceral and the atmosphere sublimly chilly. Overload, in everything but the name, is a Descent game made by the original developers to be a modern interpretation of the Descent franchise. Everything that made the original games great is here, and in a time where stagnation is prevalent, the laser focused design of this game makes for a very refreshing experience. 

Most surprisingly, to me, is that after all these years of playing a Descent game with a joystick I never thought I would be say this but here it is: 

This title has such good mouse control that you don't need to bother with anything else. 

This is a stellar achievement by the development team. The joystick was one the reasons the originals didn't become quite as ubiquitous as the likes of Doom/Quake. This is no longer the case!

Strongly recommend that you support these developers early on. As a backer I can verify that they have met every milestone and contiually updated the community - they have been very professional and have provided realistic timelines for deliverables - which gives me great confidence that the final product will be delivered in its entirety by the end of 2017.

So........I played this for 20 mins. Thats all I needed. Actually going through the training level is all I needed. This game is EXACTLY what I wanted in a Descent game. Such a simple formula, which I've never seen perfectly replicated by any other publisher. After nearly 20 years of waiting.......... all I can say is it felt like I went straight back in time to 1996. Descent 2 was one of the first PC games I ever played, I loved it then and still love it now. I hoped that Descent Underground would be able to bring back that feeling of nostalgia but they have failed. When I saw that the original creators were involed in this.....what seems as a spiritual successor to the Descent series, well all I can say is that I've been sitting in front of my PC waiting for this to unlock early access. I don't regret waiting. First time ever I haven't regretted paying for early access to a game, even though it is just one demo level. You can tell straight away that this game has the original creators fingerprints all over it. 

Pros:
The fluidity of movement (if you're Descent fanboy like me you muscle memory will kick in split seconds), 
the electronic soundtrack (which you think wouldn't be an influence but for me its a big deal), 
gameplay itself hasn't change from the originals which makes it so good. 
Visuals are pristine, 
AI, holy sh*t! first time I actually felt like I was being hunted. Very few games I've played where I  actually had to flee for my life.

Cons: (there are some which are minor, really not worth mentioning
Is there a guidebot?

Thats it, if you've read this far my question to you is, why are you still reading and not purchased? And this is coming from someone who is firmly opposed against purchasing early access, DLC, season pass which are blatant cash grabs.

To the creators, you made a mid 30's gamer feel like a teenager again. I'm home! Thank you very much! :)

P.S. I come back from time to time to see if there is any updates which there has been. So I played the second or third level. Yep, did nearly jump out of my seat when I pretty much flew straight into a trap.

The original creators of Descent are back, and ready to send you into another pulse pounding experience where your senses are in, well, overload! This spiritual successor brings that classic gameplay into the modern age and is the only 6DOF to truly give you the same feeling as Descent. The bots are menacing looking and sounding, are ruthless, their AI a true modern evolution for the 6DOF genre. The weapons are varied and gives a nice feedback for use. You'll see some old favorites with a modern edge and some all new concepts. The lighting is excellent and the music is phenominal. If you've played the free playable teaser for Overload before, then consider that just a ""sample"" of what's in this. Everything about the game contributes to your immersion and to the fun you'll have. The Early Access is starting and it's already blowing it out of the park. The completed game will have a full single player campaign by the writer of Freespace 2, and a multiplayer expansion will be coming about 6-8 months after that. The game already has a sample mission, as well as Challenge Mode, a veritable gauntlet of merciless bots coming after you wave after wave. Do you have what it takes to survive? Well strap in and hold on tight, this is gonna be a wild ride and you're going to love it every step of the way.",1489402262,1489402262,True,8,0,0.410987883806228638,3,False,False,True,False,,,
