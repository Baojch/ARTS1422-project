the only things i liked about the game:

[*]the art is very nice. someone with really high skill in pixel art was obviously at work here
[*]the gameplay feels very fluid and satisfying at its core
[/list]

but

[*]the game is still buggy as hell in 2021. items falling through the floor, button inputs randomly not working, the player character and enemies standing in the air.
[*]the music and sound effects are garbage and eargrating.
[*]the controls are garbage, you cant leave menus by pressing cancel, you cant skip dialog by pressing continue. scrolling through the menu is bound to the button you bind your dash to, wtf?
[*]it is very confusing at the start, no direction at all is given and you go to 4 different areas.
[*]the game is very very hard. dodging and blocking sucks, and you do not have any kind of dependable healing. you can farm out coins and buy healing potions, but you can't equip a shield and a potion at same time. everytime you want to switch your equipped item you have to go through the horribly controlled menus.
[*]there is no map for the entire game, only very tiny area maps that do not help at all because the game is split up into hundred of tiny areas.
[*]there are a lot of errors on the in game map. showing paths where there are clearly none, always on the same 2 map tiles being connected.
[*]you can't even find a map for the game anywhere on the internet. well tbf you can't find anything about this game anywhere. probably because it is so bad that everyone quits after finding the first upgrade.
[*]you can not dodge through enemies. and their attack range is higher than you dodge range. this means if you are close enough to hit them, you can not dodge away far enough to evade their attacks in any way, forcing you to basically cheese any enemy you find.
[*]enemies do not give xp. this means your character never gets stronger in any way by killing monsters. so you basically skip every enemy in the game because there is not reason for killing them, eventho this should be a game about killing enemies.
[*]in the end 90% of the gameplay is dying over and over and doing platforming with bad movement.
[*]enemies drop useless currency that falls onto the floor and bounces around falling off of edges, causing you to lose about 50% of everything that drops.
[*]enemies kill you in 2-3 hits. but even the most basic enemies in the game take 5-15 hits to kill.
[*]i opened a chest to find 3 throwing axes inside. these are SINGLE USE and deal less damage than your basic attack. i couldn't even kill a single basic enemy with the contents of the chest. if you buy them at the store you need to pay money from like 50 enemy kills to buy enough axes to kill a single enemy. but that won't even work because you can only carry 9 of them. you need around 10 to kill one enemy tho. jesus christ how can a game be this bad.
[*]whenever you leave a screen-area (they are tiny) every enemy respawns. even less reason to kill anything.
[*]i thought i was having a bug that my equipped item randomly changed to another but i found out that if you press up to jump and dash at the same time your equipped item cycles through to another one. there is no information about this anywhere in the game or the control settings and it can't be unbound. edit: i found a setting where you can disable it, but it's not in the controls menu.
[*]you can't stunlock enemies even when they take 15 hits to kill. (they have no flinch animation)
[*]you can't block or perfect parry boss attacks, so the shield is basically useless
[*]even the very first boss spawns additional very hard enemies throughout the fight
[*]most of the abilities/attacks in the game require some kind of street-fighter-like button and directional input. really horrible when you are in the fray fighting enemies. they won't work 90% of the time.
[*]8 achievements of this game are basically impossible. lovely for a completionist.
[*]the bosses seem to do percentage based damaged. so collecting health powerups is useless. yay!
[*]your damage never increases throughout the entire game. very unsatisfying. this also means that the areas are not balanced at all.",1620514584,1620655836,False,5,2,0.583821237087249756,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The developers released one patch a week or so after release, which seemed to have fixed the initial issues that the game had. As the team was a bunch of game development students who had to move on from the project, they more or less abandoned this game once that patch was released. Personally, I had no major issues or bugs occur while playing the game. The game took just under 6 hours to get all the upgrades and kill all the bosses. For $5, I would say that is relatively worth it, as I had a lot of fun. I would recommend the game even if the price were doubled.

The controls of the game are excellent. I had no issues with map traversal or the light platforming present in the game. As the protagonist, you will get the ability to double jump, air dash, divekick, and dash through enemies. This makes traversal very entertaining, and it lends well to speedrunning, though I have no personal interest in that. In fact, I think the entire game was made with speedrunning in mind, but that didn't take away from my initial playthrough at all. 

The combat is also fun, for the same reasons. Using the movement abilities to essentially do a crossup divekick and continue your combo behind the enemy is satisfying as hell. During early parts in the game without the abilities, the combat ultimately involves simply slashing a couple times and dashing away before repeating that cycle. Honestly, I still find that sort of combat fun, as it harkens back to SotN. Also, because the game has no experience points, even avoiding enemies is made fun and practical. This allows you to use your combat/traversal tools however you consider to be fun for yourself.

The level design only furthers the great controls and combat/traversal. Traversing through these maps is made easy and fun due to the good placement of enemies and platforms. When you have all the tools at your disposal, you can easily get from one side of the map to the other without taking much or any damage. There are spots where I expected there to be some sort of secrets or treasure chests, but I will chalk that up to the fact that the game was not fully realized before being released and subsequently abandoned.

The art is great, as well. Sprites are beautiful, animated well, and the colors used are very easily discernible. The music is only okay and not too memorable, and certain songs loop much too quickly. Some songs seem misplaced, but they aren't horrible to listen to anyway. I actually enjoyed the drum machine used to emulate a typical drum set with double bass pedals, though that is mainly due to surprise and fun factor. There really isn't much of a story, nor much lore or backstory to research. There are only a few little bits and pieces of information and notes strewn about the map, many of which are directly tied to the bosses and battles, but only a couple of notes that really add to the lore. 

The map, which was not even in the game at release, is not that great. It only shows you the region that you are in, and you cannot zoom out to show the entire map. It also does not show you where you are in a room, only that you are in said room (same goes for save points within rooms). This confused me for a good while until I played the game enough to memorize where everything was. Also, there is at least one instance of the map showing incorrect room placement, but that was easy enough to figure out.

If you enjoy Metroidvanias with very satisfying controls and traversal tools that let you zip across the map, then I would definitely recommend that you play this game. It lends well to speedrunning, as well, if you are into that sort of thing. Go get the world record, or something. There are certain aspects of this game (controls, combat/traversal tools, and presentation) that I think are more polished and entertaining than other games with professional development teams and 3 to 5 times the price tag. As I have gotten all the upgrades, I honestly don't know if I will play this game any further, but it entertained me greatly. Enough to write a review to simply raise the score of this game. It does not deserve a ""mixed"" rating, especially not for its release issues and lack of support from a nonexistent development team.  I had a blast playing it.

It can be more rewarding to farm lanterns for money than going out of your way to whittle down enemies and risk dying to one shot attacks.

This is one of those unfortunate hidden gems that got dunked into the bog of bad reviews on launch, and never managed to make it out even after constant updates and improvements. I really enjoyed this game and it's honestly worth more than they charge. 

Pros: 
+ Movement feels very fast, and there are a lot of cool movement techs you can do with the abilities.
+ A lot of unique, interesting abilities.
+ Ample backtracking, but especially generous on the vertical movement (which I personally appreciate).
+ Beautiful art, to the point that I wish there was a gif version of the title screen available for use as a desktop background.
+ Inventive, inspired designs. This is especially apparent with the save rooms full of cats. Tons of games just blatantly copy the Dark Souls bonfire or something similar, but I've never seen a save room where a giant cat that lives in the wall saves the game for you.
+ The boss fights are very fun and while I did die a few times, it was never an outrageous amount. It was difficult enough to be fun, but not so difficult as to be annoying.
+ I really enjoyed the platforming and puzzle aspects of the game. Searching around for the gems, hidden rooms, using the spear to make otherwise impossible jumps, etc.

Cons:
- Having separate buttons for dashing feels... bad on keyboard and mouse. I figure you're probably just meant to play on controller, which would mostly negate this issue, but it still would have been nice to be able to choose between two separate buttons or one button. Once I got used to it, it was doable, but I never preferred it over just having a single dash button. Overall, kind of annoying, but not a deal-breaker. The one plus side of this is that it makes it possible to back dash, but throughout my play through I never really needed to use back dash anyway.
- No different costumes/armor. To be fair, this game only costs $5. I can't really expect it to be packed with non-essential content. 
- Very few NPCs. Again, this is non-essential content, but I would personally have enjoyed seeing more NPCs since I like the designs in this game.

Overall: I really enjoyed this game. As far as I can tell from my playthrough, the devs have fixed all of the issues that were in the game on launch. It now feels like a complete game, and in my opinion is worth more than they charge. I recommend this game to anyone interested.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]
It didn’t take me very long to discover why [i]Demon Peak[/i] has mixed reviews on Steam. This game loves to kill you, and unlike many other similarly sadistic games, it’s not always fair. However, my hard rule of having to beat a game before I can review it for the Metroidvania Review has proven favorable here. It still lacks a lot of polish, so for many people I could totally understand if you’d want to skip this one. However, for a mere $5 as a starting price, you do get a pretty fun and challenging experience if you’re able to look past its faults. 

The best part of [i]Demon Peak[/i] is how it controls. You’re given two dodge buttons on your controller’s shoulders, so at any given time you can choose instantly which way you want to shift out of the way. Used in tandem with jumping you can conserve momentum and pull off some pretty impressive acrobatics. It’s tempting to go for the three-hit combo on your melee attack, but in many cases it’s more effective – and more fun – to dash in for a strike and dash away to safety. The regular enemies are fantastic to play with using these mechanics. After the initial learning curve you’ll be weaving around your foes, striking them in the back and mocking their feeble attempts to stop you. Unfortunately, while the core gameplay is excellent, there are a few misteps in the stat design and, most importantly, the bosses. 

[i]Demon Peak[/i] utilizes a “souls-like” level of risk, but it lacks the supporting mechanics that make that design fair. Enemy attacks can knock off a third of your health bar, making each mistake a potentially lethal blow. When you die, you lose all your progress, which can be incredibly disheartening if you’ve extended far beyond your last save point. There is a certain thrill to being too far beyond your last point of safety, but even [i]Dark Souls[/i] kept all of your item progress when you died and gave you a second chance to collect your gold (souls). The biggest issue with this setup is how most of the bosses are designed. Not every attack is telegraphed well, so suddenly you could be blindsided and be stunlocked to death at any given time. Simple pattern memorization solves this problem, but it’s not really an ideal solution for a game like this – especially since one boss doesn’t have a save point too near to it. 

With all that said, there really is only one boss that I’d consider completely broken. The rest, once I did recognize their patterns, were a lot of fun to finally [i][b]beat their lousy face in and show them who the REAL boss is  [/b] [/i]~ ahem ~ I mean, they were a good and satisfying challenge. The game ends on a really high note too, as the final boss is a mostly grade A polished fight. It’s not perfect, but as I said, for a game priced like a Mini-Meroidvania you’re still getting a pretty good deal.

While this game is fairly short (I think you could technically get to the ending credits in less than an hour) I’m not sure it really qualifies for the Mini-Metroidvania category. First off, I doubt most players are going to be able to beat this one in less than 4 hours simply because they’ll be dying and trying again – or just getting lost in the game world. But beside that, if you’re looking to 100% this game, there are enough obscure health and mana upgrades that you could be searching for them for up to 12 hours. It’s worth mentioning that level design overall is quite good, making it very fun (and tempting) to explore the game’s corners.  And, if you’re looking for more play time and you’re especially insane, there are also a few challenging achievements to shoot for.

[i]Demon Peak[/i] probably deserves mixed reviews; not everyone is going to be willing to push past its difficulty curve. However, at its core it’s a hidden gem, it just needs some cutting and patchwork to expose its precious mineral. I think if the developers polished up some of its wonkier animations and retooled the telegraphing issues it could easily be a 4 out of 5 game. What they’re charging for it is completely fair though, for what it is, and I personally enjoyed it.

The graphics are slick, most of the time smooth animations along with great choice of colors, befitting the multiple areas you'll be going through. The gameplay is satisfying, you die really fast if you aren't cautious. There's a lot of room to improve though. 

-Some poorly designed ennemies (and others that are brilliant)

The combat is the major point of frustration, because it is a bit unintuitive (the dash is not really a dodge), and the bosses feel pretty weird (the strategy to beat them feels too much like an exploit). Also, there are a few minor glitches still in, like a small delay after you land before you can jump again, and some objects that get trapped in walls.

Once you get used to it, however, the game becomes more fun than frustrating. The player character is really fast, which allows you to dominate the game if you know what you are doing.

I knew what I was going into, it looked very promising when I randomly found it, dark setting, old school shinobi-hagane vibes.. The reviews were all mostly negative, I don't know why exactly I bought it.. curiosity probably.. and it is quite cheap right? Besides there are a lot of games that are widely considered bad, and when you try it yourself sometimes they aren't THAT bad.. it's not one of those situations here unfortunately..

After I beat the game, it left me with the feeling of disappointment, not because of how bad and short the whole game was, but how much potential it had, the whole concept is amazing, the art direction is captivating, but to throw it all away and release such mess is just sad.. I learned through forums, that it was a short project by inexperienced students, and they officially expressed how everyone lost interest and didn't wanted to invest any more effort into it.. why this information is not available on the product page? If this is an experimental game, why is this not for free somewhere on Newgrounds? To summarize this so called ''project'' it would go like this. They made a little project for testing and learning, then decided to push it as a fully fleshed out game by fooling people, just so that they could earn some extra cash from it and later carry on with whatever else they want to do. It doesn't matter that it's cheap, it's not worth even that.. such methods of squeezing money out of your abandoned projects shouldn't be put into practice. If it's not done, you are not going to do anything else with it, be honest with yourself and respect your customers.

I will start by saying, this whole game is still in alpha stage.. sort of in ''debug'' mode, it's like a naked skeleton.. locations are empty, monotonic, lifeless.. Same goes for the level design.. The art though is kinda ok, but most of the stuff has that messy/sketchy feel to it, you can easily tell it's rushed. I'm not a fan of pixel vomit, I prefer when sprites have a proper depth, light sources, contrast and animations use more frames. I have a feeling they made a character first, then much later started to build levels and didn't notice how big he is, it's disappointing to see his legs sticking out of walls, during platforming you will fall down earlier, due to your character having a different hitbox skin. Of course they wouldn't try to redo it or fix it by any means..

Combat is fast, sometimes messy.. but overall I had no problems with it. At least the game features quite a big moveset, but their execution is cryptic.. to perform a lot of moves, can be really confusing. In such situations when you have to stand on a tiny platform, throw a spear to get an extra jump, by failing to do so you can easily fall down and waste a lot of time by climbing through all that hemorrhoid infested obstacle course again just to get another shot.

A lot of bosses and enemies need a proper balancing, they can be too easy and at the same time too hard, but that usually happens when your char glitches somewhere in the wall or gets locked in a place. But overall you can cheese anything, the last boss and Centaur Lord were the only ones who gave me a little bit of challenge, but it won't take long for anyone to read their patterns and find their weaknesses after few tries. Those hints aren't subtle.. they are kind of in your face.

I ignored all the negative reviews and still played it.. if you want a proper good game with a feeling of satisfaction and immersive world, full of details go better play Hollow Knight or Castlevania titles on GBA or DS. This game won't give you anything but the feeling of disappointment.. it will make you feel like a fool, for wasting money and time. I highly recommend to do not play this game and support the idea behind unfinished/rushed games.. If it would be in early access stage it would be totally fine and understandable, but it has been abandoned by the devs long time ago.

Pro's

-dark and chilling soundtrack
-Dark Souls themes and mechanics (monsters reset after saving at a checkpoint or after leaving a room; both mechanics are also randomized to add difficulty)
-great art concept
-apart from bosses, even lesser monsters can kill you easily (most can kill you very quickly)
-levels are small but have enough in them to keep you exploring for hours
-combat is simple yet challenging (all monsters have weaknesses to specific combo types)
-monsters have a great design and actually invoke fear when you fight them
-no bugs (none that I've seen anyway)
-saving a game at a checkpoint is fast and easy
-interesting story

Con's

-levels are too complex so its easy to get lost if you don't keep track of where you are
-the key-mapping for certain skills like spear throw are so strange that you cannot use said skill (the game requires you to use spear throw to progress through the game; so how can you if the game prevents you from using this vital skill!). (Update, spear throw is used via pressing the back and forward keys based on where your character is facing)
-I said before that lesser monsters can kill you easily; turns out that there are other monsters that are so OP that they can kill you in one hit even if you are no where near them.
-half of the bosses require intense strategy and focus to vanquish (or you die very quickly), while the other ones are insanely easy to beat. I wish all the bosses were tweaked so that they all were more consistent but also allowed the player a fairer chance of winning.

I am currently stuck due to the fact that I have failed to learn how to use spear throw so I cannot progress much with the game. However, I know as a fact that other players have beaten this game, some with little difficulty. If the dev's update certain aspects of this game then it could be less stressful and worth more respect. I liked this game when it came out and I still like this game, but until I learn how to use spear throw, I can't progress any further T_T

(Update) After learning how to use spear throw, I was able to slowly progress through the game. I really had to use my head to remember the level layout in order to not get lost. Despite the few issues i had with the game, the more I played, the more I fell in love with it. The boss battles were epic and challenging, and progressing through the game actually felt rewarding like when you beat a boss or find a hidden power. And the final boss was a fight I will never forget. 

My original rating was a 7.9/10, but I will now give it a solid 10/10. I wish the dev's make more games like this in the future, they actually made something worth remembering.",1532184618,1668123372,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Far away there is a mountain that is the birthplace of evil and horror, demons live there and call the mountain home. 
These nightmarish fiends leave there mountain home to go and terrorize the humans, even dragging them to the mountain top to be slaughtered in unspeakable ways. But some brave humans try to claim the top and in this evil.

That’s where you come in, you play as a ruthless warrior wearing the grinning face of a demon, and it is up to him to kill the most powerful demons of the mountain get to the top and face the master demon of the mountain, and end this evil nightmare once and for all.

So with the story done what I liked about this game. The combat was good, kept you on edge sometimes like with the last boss. 

Even those we did not get to fight a lot of bosses, the one we do get to fight are awesome look and pretty fun to fight. All the power ups were good; the music was nice to listen too. 

But the best well to me was the Retro/2D/Pixel Graphics art style. As I have said before I love Retro/2D/ Pixel Graphics art style for games it’s one of the reasons that proves you don’t need millionaires of dollars to make a great game. 

Anyway the art style was very good my fav being the background for the level the Monastery I mean it’s like something from bloodborne or a lovecraft story.

Okay time to start off with well not bad but annoying/could have been better. To start off with the game could have used more bosses or hell even sub-bosses you have to beat to get to the main boss.

Could have more NPC’s to talk too, the map could have been better, why will you can’t scroll up or down to look for a place you have been too. Same with the sup-weapons and potions can’t scroll up or down with them.

Game could have used a warp thing, like when you get far ahead you can warp to an old place. And game could have used Notes and the like to give more story. And lastly ending was a bit anticlimactic.

All right with that all done, this game is a pretty good Metroidvania game with good art good combat and good bosses.

The game isn't very long and at times I felt I was gaining upgrades almost too quickly, but that just meant I always had a good supply of abilities to play around with.  As for currency, the game is pretty generous with it, so there's not usually a need to ration your healing items unless you're saving them for a boss fight.

Not amazing, but not terrible either. I didn't really know what to expect, but I didn't really have high expectations going in.  The platforming aspect itself feels great, the controls are tight and the movement is smooth, precise, and predictable. Same goes for the combat.  Janky controls/movement can completely ruin a game for me but I managed to finish this game in one sitting.

If you're looking for a story, you won't find it here.  Demon Peak gets straight to the point, which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for.  The level design is pretty basic, the music is just OK (a little too intense and reptitive at times imo, can kinda get annoying), and sadly there are only a handful of enemies in the game, with even fewer boss fights.  Different ""worlds"" don't have different enemies, it's just the same uh.. demons.. throughout the entire game, which gets more than a little repetitive towards the end.  The handful of boss fights are pretty good though, aside from one which seemed like an afterthought.

The game world itself is pretty small, but I think that if it were a lot larger, the lack of variety with enemies would have just made the game seem tedious.  It's easy to get around, there are a save points similar to Super Metroid, and some secrets here and there.  

The combat and movement is where this game actually shines.  It's fast, predictable, and precise in a way that you won't be blaming the game if you die--you'll know it's your fault.  Throughtout the game you acquire and buy different types of attacks, which are then used with button combinations similar to a fighting game, which are fun to use and most have their uses.  For $10 or whatever I paid (honestly I forgot tbh), I think it was a pretty good deal.

tl;dr:
Good:
-runs good
-gorgeous pixel art/animation
-great combat
-great movement
-pretty good boss fights
-decent amount of exploration

Bad:
-small/repetitive game world
-map needs work
-very small amount of enemies, gets reptitive near the end
-enemies don't change in different areas

Visually: the characters are much nicer than the maps (so far) but there's nothing wrong with the maps, they're just typical stuff, where the characters I'd say are really nice looking. If you just had these maps and the same gameplay but with little cute bobble people (as per so many games of this kind), I'd have moved right along from this title - YMMV.

The only mechanic so far that's an irritation is a spear throw that's a back then forward and fire - I've rebound movement to D-pad to try and make this easier as I was failing to pull it off with control stick on controller most attempts.

The music is nice and generally I just find it fun to play. It is a bit weird that you can go back through your explored rooms to get back to save location and then go back to where you got to last with all the enemies respawned but just jump over the enemies, rather than fight again.

Sure enough with this last thing, if you look, there is a speedrun video showing exactly what I mean, you can just ignore the enemies and jump through rooms - once you're to the exit, they're history. I'm sure that gets tougher and in any case, it's fine if you want to exploit the speed of movement that way, but personally I'm only doing this when coming back from a save with respawned guys I've already killed. Once I get to a new room, I'm back to clearing it out properly.

Perhaps this is too indicative of those early video games in that regard; I applaud the idea of a challenge, but after the first two powerups you get, there is very little to lead you in the direction to go next and if you die, you're back to the save point, unsure if you were *supposed* to go in that direction or if you should try another one.

Do not let that rating deter you from giving this game a shot, from my understanding when this game was released there were several bugs, such as maps that didnt work, save points which randomnly teleported you around the map, unfinished textures and other graphical bugs.  If I played the game in that state I probably would have given this game a negative review also, but all of these features have been fixed in the latest version.

The game itself is a standard metroidvania, but a very well done metroidvania.  Like most games of this type you have a decently sized map to explore and as you traverse the map you acqurie new abilities that help you access new areas.  You have some standard stuff like a double jump and the ability to breathe underwater, and a few unique items like spears which are a ranged weapon but can also be stuck to walls to be used as platforms.  

Exploring the world is fun, you are always finding new upgrades and new combat moves which keeps things fresh, your character moves fast, the animation is fluid, and the controls are perfect.  Your character and his weapons look awesome and the world is varied with a wide variety of enemy types to fight.  You also get a some moves that are used with street fighter style inputs which I had a lot of fun with.   There are a total of 4 bosses, all of which are fun to fight and present a nice challenge.

The game took me about 3 hours to beat, and I had an absolute blast playing it.  The combat is fun, the platforming is fast and precise, and the exploration is very rewarding.

The character moves so fast, is expected to change platforms so often, and the camera has no smoothing and directly moves with the character; it's very sickening.

Beyond this, although the graphics and animations are very nice; the combat itself is very spam based and badly structured. Player attacks do not stun or disrupt enemies and most of them have a decent amount of health and a moderate attack speed. Thus combat basically becomes a damage race of spam, the only way to really avoid it is by rapidly mashing the dodge button while trying to keep hitting the enemy. Which not only is awkward and inelegant, but is also impossible on smaller platforms. They could have made is so enemies have low health and thus die quickly, or made it so the players attack stun enemies; they did neither and the combat feels very unrefined because of it.

The environments aren't very impressive either, they really just are not shaped or designed in a way that makes them feel remotely immersive, real or in theme to the world. It just looks like the developers made a couple primitve ground and wall textures and then pasted them onto various pieces of geometry with a paltry amount of actual objects and decoration thrown in.

The fact that the game was essentially broken at launch and the developers barely patched it before abandoning it and trying to phrase it in a way that didn't make them sound like scum, also doesn't help.

If you want a review in video form, here you go. I try and be funny in this so if you prefer text, written review below

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrEz0HAJPHs

This game is basically Ninja Gaiden meets Megaman zero. Demon peak is a solid action platformer with metroidvania elements. The combat is tight, the enemies are diverse and the movement is incredibly fun. While the game has a few glitches lying about, none have affected me in any of my 3 play throughts of the game so I can't really comment on them.

The aesthetic, artstyle and music of the game are very unique and really add to the overall appeal. I realy enjoyed the Samurai and feudal japanese feel to it, and the pixel art and animations accentuate this aesthetic perfectly. The music can be a little out of place, with the very first level having very out of place backing music but overall the soundtrack is solid. While there isn't much in terms of progression other than the secret health and essensce upgrades, the game has a fairly deep combat system that can make fighting enemies enjoyable even 14 hours in. It's a lot of fun to chain super moves together and to parry the fast attacks of enemies, even after doing it dozens of times. 

My biggest gripe about this game is the lack of replayability and late game content, with there only being 1 difficulty and new game plus being identical to the base game apart from keeping your upgrades. Overall, if the game added in more bosses, preferably very hard bosses that are optional, or more elite enemies on new game plus, it would be a much more complete experience. Apart from this you can't really buy that many new attacks and the secrets are a little lackluster, but the game puts core gameplay over extending the play time, which is admirable, but it makes it very disappointing when you've basically seen everything the game has to offer after 6 or so hours.

As it stands, the game will definitely sate you for about 7 hours and I'm sure you'll enjoy your time with the it. If you enjoy megaman zero or valdis story at all you'll really enjoy this game. With that in mind, I highly recommend Demon peak.",1500971831,1500972236,True,5,0,0.51173710823059082,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I started a brand new game and was quite pleased with the fixes. I managed to beat this game in a little less than 3 hours, and i enjoyed every bit of it! I enjoyed myself very much. Will be going back to this game to find everything that i missed and grind for the rest of the achievements. Also, i will be giving this game a positive review now since the way it currently is thanks to the latest patch, it's definitely worth it now, and i could recommend it to anyone. Especially the oldschool heads such as myself. Love metroid and castlevania? Got $5 to blow? Get this now!



(Before The Patch) - Coming from someone who has invested 5-6 hours into this game, and has even streamed it twice, i have to say that it has so much potential. But the game has so many bugs, glitches and issues, that i wouldn't recommend buying it as it is now until they patch the things wrong with it, Which i will explain it all in a sec. There is alot of bad i have to say about it, so just hear me out.

It's not much to really explain on the setting of the game other than the fact that you are somewhat of a human samurai demon slayer that is trying to make his way out of a demonic mountain peak. The game is pretty much a metroidvania styled indie, so if you love metroid and/or castlevania, then this will interest you. But the amount of bugs in it's current build can certainly take the fun out of it.

Literally within my first 3 mins of playing this game, I suddenly ended up in the foreground of the game, being able to walk through the whole world in the background of the stage without being able to see my character. With some constant fighting with the game, i managed to get myself back out somehow. There is also one particular area that you can reach with the demon wings in the beginning area of the game that causes this same bug as well. Another huge gripe i have with the game is that ever since i started playing, i have not been able to access the mini-map. According to the game, you're supposed to be able to access it by either holding your menu/inventory button, or tab if you're using keyboard. Or you can press the menu button, and just press your lb or rb buttons to get to the map. When you try to do it this way, you don't ever see a map. and holding the button does nothing either. So because of this, i literally have been playing thru the game barebones trying to remember where everything is on like some original nes metroid status. Myself loving oldschool type games, i tried to deal with this. But when there's a huge world in a game, and so much to explore and find, it can be quite frustrating to not have a map to go by.

Another huge issue i have with this game is that i realized that sometimes when you enter certain areas (especially most save points) when you exit the save point, you could end up in a completely different area than where you previously were at. For example, lets say i was in The Heart (which is where you can shop for potions, skills and stuff) There is a save point there too. If i went in the save point and left back out, i could end up in the monestry(which is another area in the game). Times that this happened was extremely frustrating to me. And considering that i had no map to go by, it made it that much harder and stressful to try to find where i was before that bug happened.

Another issue is the fact that Most treasure chest in the game don't give you anything. Chest are well hidden in this game, and some of them wont reward you anything once you open them. And the majority of the time when you do get something, it's usually either coins or potions. When you obtain a potion or a type of item out of chests, it doesn't tell you what it was that you picked up. So because the game doesn't do this, you have to go into your sub menus and see what it was that you picked up for yourself. Even healing items such as meats that come out of breakable objects such as candles don't tell you what they are. They just heal either your health or your essence (magic) depending on the type of consumable it is.

Textures in this game can be a huge issue too. I found myself constantly having to restart the game because often times when going thru different sections and areas, the textures would disappear to the point that all i would see is my character and maybe some candles and the save cave if there was one around. Even when it doesn't do this, some of the textures on some platforms are not even visible, and most hidden areas that you would need to use a supermove to get thru seem to be pointless and either go nowhere, or offer anything.

The very first enemy that you come across is a bit on the overpowered side. it's nearly impossible to take him out without taking any damage. Im pretty sure it's the first enemy. It's the ones that scream alot and leap out at you constantly slashing you with their claws. Once they are on you, it's a bit of a hassle.

The music is not bad. The only bad thing i would probably have to say about it is the fact that you can hear it loop in some sections of the game. Aside from that, i don't really have much issues with it.

The Overall gameplay is actually great. Trying my absolute best to cast all the negative things to the side, and using all the amount of patience that i possibly had, i was still able to enjoy the game. If it wasn't for the bugs, i could definitely enjoy it 10x more. It truly does feel like a successor to the oldschool castlevania games and metroid games. And even though the game is just a mere $5, i still couldn't recommend this to anyone until they fixed everything that i mentioned was wrong with it. I still dealt with it because i have alot of patience, but the next person may not take the bugs and issues with this title as lightly. Keep your eyes on this game though if they fix all the issues, Because it has MUCH potential.",1500242568,1500359071,True,6,0,0.536322832107543945,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Anyways, even with those few bugs and the forced ""hardmode"" (due to missing upgrades), the game is really fun to play if you like things like RogueLegacy and the DarkSouls-Series. It has a nice artstyle and ambient-music to it and the combat as well as the platforming is - after half an hour of learning enemy-behaviour and the controls - really enjoyable. The Bossfights are challenging and the Bosses themselves not necessarily easy to find, which makes exploring the areas a huge factor in this game.

Disclaimer: I have not beaten the entire game.

Let's talk about the good first. The character you play as is cool looking and the abilities you get are just as stylish and flashy. The character itself is fun to play with all the dashing and other movement abilities. The best part of the game is simply moving, and I found myself dashing and manuevering my way around a lot of the levels because movement was more fun than the combat.

Now, the bad. 

1) The game is incredibly glitchy. 

Several times I would go into a save room and then on my way out, find myself in a different map somewhere else in the area. This was especially confusing right at the start since I thought it was a mechanic of the game, but when I had it happen elsewhere later I understood that it was just a bug of some sort and a very confusing one at that.

Currently the dev has turned the map off since it wasn't working correctly, but that leaves the game a little hard to navigate. I ended up finding my way eventually, but there was a lot of backtracking through areas that had nothing in them, just because I'd forgotten.

There was also a time where there was clearly supposed to be an invisible wall and instead was a large light blue rectangle full of 1's. See that here: http://i.imgur.com/I2Ya6l8.png

Multiple times I came to a hard-to-get-to chest and there was nothing inside. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just a laugh in the players face, but it's rather dumb.

Also, as I was going into one of the boss rooms my fps dropped to like 2 and I had to slowly drop back down to the previous area for it to stop.

I also remember several times I was standing on this air, as there was a dropdown-able spot, but it didn't put in the texture or something, so my character just floated.

2) low effort art

There are several whole areas where the background is literally just black. Even if the point was to be pitchblack (which I'm not convinced was the intent) it needs some sort of flavor. There was also a pretty rediculously bad background of a skeleton which made me laugh and a send a picture to all my friends: http://i.imgur.com/X2h8tXo.png 

3) unpolished

Most of the game just simply feels unpolished. I feel like the little guys that throw aaxes in arcs throw them way too far/high and do way too much damage and are rediculously annoying. The mages are cool, but they generally suck as the player can just run at them and kill them before they do anything of worth; exception being the purple orb guys. Also, the health and gold pickup hitbox is pretty terrible. You have to stop your play significantly to wait for the orbs or coins to get collected; this was probably one of the most annoying things of all.

OVERALL: Kinda fun at first, but terribly bugged and low effort art makes it horrendous. I would accept this if it was listed as an early access game, but as a full release this isn't okay. I do look forward to seeing if any of these things are fixed in the future, but as of now I would not recommend playing it.",1499914558,1499914558,False,16,0,0.638887166976928711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Até então possui inúmeros problemas de polimento e compatibilidade, parecendo um legitimo acesso antecipado. Contudo, eu consegui desfrutar a proposta jogo e mesmo com muitos problemas ainda me diverti bastante. 

Existe alguns pequenos detalhes de level design que deixa o jogo a desejar e a dificuldade em si é mais pela injustiça do que habilidade, por que alguns inimigos são extremamente poderosos e outros são bem fracos, logo de inicio você percebe o desequilíbrio neste quesito onde os dois primeiros inimigos já são bem apelativos e a mecanica de combate não é ensinada de forma adequada.

Um ponto que me incomodou bastante é o recebimento de dano, por que não existe uma tempinho de imunidade quando você é atingido, fazendo com que sua barra de vida seja drenada muito rápido se o inimigo colar no seu pé. (Os olhos flutuantes e os peixes matam você em instantes).

Ainda no combate outra coisa que me deixa um pouco frustado é que dificilmente os inimigos sentem dor ao receber dano e com isso abre-se uma brecha para o inimigo sempre te acertar mesmo você batendo bastante contra ele, ou seja, é quase que inevitável receber dano mesmo com vantagem, obrigando você a bater e correr caso queira sair ileso, sem contar que o dano é altíssimo e alguns ataques é quase morte instantânea.

Os baús são quase que esqueciveis já que o basicamente só vem poções, sendo que os mesmos itens podem ser comprados na loja bem baratos! E de vez em nunca vem ouro  nos baús

Os chefes são fáceis porém quando estão para morrer começar a apelar de forma irritante, mas ainda sim não vejo como um ponto negativo.

Mesmo com esses pontos ruins o jogo ainda possui bastante coisa interessante, muitas habilidades que faz diferença no combate e possibilita acesso a lugares novos, acertar um combo completo de maneira eficaz é bem satisfatório e aprender a lidar com cada inimigo da uma sensação de aprendizado quando você acostuma com as dificuldades. Explorar o mapa é bem legal mas poderia ser melhor por que tem muitos pontos que exige uma certa habilidade aprendida e quando você a tem e chega até o local as vezes você é recompensado com um belo nada.

Os gráficos são muito bons e a musica também está muito boa porém não muito diferente de outras partes do jogo ela não são bem polidas dando para perceber os cortes e loops.

Em resumo o jogo desaponta em algumas coisas e manda muito bem em outras, ainda da vontade de continuar jogando para avançar e descobrir novas mecânicas! A sensação é muito boa e mesmo com todos os problemas da para perder algumas horas e ver beleza no jogo mesmo não estando muito bem construído.

But even though I do, [b]I cannot recommend it in the current state[/b][i]As of 7/11/17[/i]

For what the game is trying to be, a faithful remaster of SNES Castlevania/Metroid, it does a great job. You can feel the atomsphere from the level design and the musical score, though repeative after a few minutes or even cuts out randomly, does a good job tying in the darkness of the game. The game play itself is very solid and after mastering combat, the game will remind you often that you'll never really get stronger but your ability to handle enemies will get better.

Sadly, that's all I have to really say that's good about the game in the current state. To start off the things terrible about this game would be [b] the lack of a map[/b]. I get it, you wanted to design a game in the Metrovania style... [b]But why the hell isn't there an active map?! It's extremely difficult to remember when you're going in this game[/b]. Not only that, but the game also forces you to [b]REMEMBER[/b] certain spots of the game when you get a power-up to break it. This, as well as a lack of actual direction in the game [i](As I can gather, you can travel to any location and there's no real 'first location')[/i], really break the game play apart. [spoiler] I also think finding the Demon's Lance ability is SO obscured that I doubt many players would even find it... That move alone has helped me gain so many secrets that I don't understand why it's tucked away in a rather awkward place...[/spoiler]

Next are parts of the map that are broken. I've found two places where the map will glitch you into the next area as an invalid object, surfing around and hoping you'd go back where you came. I had to restart my entire game because of it. On top of this, there are chests that don't actually drop anything. I don't know if this was an over-sight for the programmer missing chests or if they're meant to have nothing, but having a chest randomly sit in a hard to reach place with nothing in it is rather defeating.

Finally, there are a few monsters in the game that cause great distress for me and I can't imagine how other players would handle it. In later areas of the game, smaller mobs will tick HP slowly and have a bit of stun, making them annoying on their own. In the mobs they roam in are a nightmare. I've died numerous times to floating eyes and freaking pirhanas because I couldn't dish out enough damage to either groups.

I'm sure the developers are working hard on this game... But I can't recommend this game for anyone else to play until these issues and many others are addressed.",1499779510,1499779510,False,5,0,0.516371667385101318,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(As of July 10)
Devs stated that the game had to be pushed out, and to be honest it shows in some areas (including one of the early bosses sadly)

That said, when you consider the price tag and the premise it's still quite fun. The gameplay is deep enough that you can't just play through the intro area and expect to be able to steam roll the game. It's very satisfying realizing the patterns of enemies and learning the areas. I played through the game without a working map, and it was still easy enough to navigate that I never felt lost because of the area diversity.

Big up was the sense of power I had being able to access and trade well against the end boss. [spoiler] Though he was, in reality, the easiest of the bosses, [/spoiler] It felt empowering to be able to learn his patterns and develop a sort of strategy.

[spoiler] The vomit worm and the centaur king, on the other hand, felt unintuitive and a bit broken. Neither felt like my skill had anything to do with me winning, and they sort of felt more like a chore than something I needed to do with how little the fights were necessary towards fighting the end boss [/spoiler]

First of all this is a review with constructive criticisms due to the fact that it is an indie game and I really want it to be everything it should be.

-The game crashed six times before it launched.

-The music goes from good to Windows 95.

-It feels unfinished overall.

The game is simply unfinished and the developers have even admitted this because of a publisher deadline. Fix the bugs, the soundtrack and give it a bit more polish and it could be something quite  special.

The combat takes a bit of getting used to at first, but now that I've gotten the hang of it and unlocked a few things it's actually pretty fun, though I still manage to die frequently mainly because I suck.
The artstyle is amazing, everything looks great.
The music is pretty nice. I didn't really like the tutorial music all that much, but the rest of the game's music so far fits pretty well, and sounds great.
Exploration is nice too, though I did get lost a few times because I missed those crystal switch things you have to hit to open pathways.

There are of course a lot of issues with the game. Frequent crashes, bugs, fullscreen option breaks the game, invisible platforms, missing sprites, inconsistencies with how some enemies will only spawn once while others respawn the moment you're off-screen, and a few level layout choices that are kinda bad(a place where jumping up takes you to a different room where you  immediately fall back down to the previous room onto a platform with the enemy respawning and hitting you when you land).

Apparently the developers were forced to release the game early thanks to a contract issue with their publisher, and weren't allowed to just put it into early access, which is why there's a bunch of bugs in the game, and the developers are trying to fix most of them.

So, if you're willing to give the developers the benefit of the doubt to fix all the bugs and get the game in a better condition, go ahead and purchase it and try out the working parts. If you would prefer to wait until they fix everything before trying out the game, then do that instead.

I played for only a couple minutes and can tell you this the environments seems bland and simply made, the character controls loosely, ledges are perfectly parallel to each other and you are expected to jump up them, also something I found weird is that I was playing with a xbox one controller and the input commands were showing up as keyboard prompts. Also, when doing research about why the game isn’t “great” is because a publishing contract.

If you really want to play a “Metroidvania” that is good get Dead Cells or Hollow Knight or wait for Chasm, Deaths Gambit, or something that I really want which looks Effin badass is Blasphemous. Honestly if you want a good game that just feels good right now get Dead Cells it is basically up to par with Castlevania Symphony of the Night or get that game.

So, what really makes this game hard for me to play besides the combat and not being able to dash past enemies, is honestly the music, yea the music. When I play this game, it reminds me of some cheesy 16-bit games it mainly reminds me of the sounds of the Sega Genesis but not in an effective way. I think they were trying to go for some hardcore metal sound but without actual instruments it just sounds dated. Something that I suppose really made me not feel like this game was submersing was the fact that the enemies were stupid enough to just walk over ledges without code to safeguard themselves from their basic AI.

So, my overall rating of this game. For now, I’m going to have to give it at least a 3/10 basically for the only good part about it is jebaiting me into buying a game because it said Metroidvania and that when I looked at the art in the store page I actually thought it would be good, but once you actually start to experience this game it starts to become Afro Samurai 2 Revenge of Kuma all over again without a license to even sell it accept for trying to capitalize off of the Metroidvania genre. Last Dead Cells if half a game and still twice as good as this game and polished.

There are many issues with this game to the point it's impossible to play (For me anyway, and it'd be a shame to waste money on something you can't play)

The game experiences issues where certain sprites are missing or not found, so many times certain icons/animations will be replaced with a black rectangle. In the short time I played they made it impossible to play. Especially when I restarted to try and see if that would fix it, only to have everything lose their sprites.

Aside from that, combat feels horrible and the sound design just annoys me to no end.

According to the game devs, they're just a couple of students who were ""forced to put this up by their publisher and not release it in early access"".

This is definitely one to pick up now!

Original review:
Demon Peak is a faithful-to-SNES-capabilities Metroidvania-style game where you play a nameless demon samurai journeying to the top of, well, Demon Peak. Honestly there's not a lot of story to be had in the game and that's fine, because it would probably be dumb and just get in the way anyway.

Let me start out by saying that the game is significantly flawed. In fact, before I get into the meat of the issues let me note that this game is not at this time marked as Early Access. It really, really should be. I soft-locked the game twice, and  I actually found a marker in a secret area that seemed to be a reminder for the developer to add a shop in that area. Overall, the quality of things is a little inconsistent, and the game is sorely lacking a final polish pass.

Some of that lack of polish might be due to the game's almost-slavish faithfulness to the capabilities of 16-bit game console hardware, though. The music is straight out of an SNES game, SPC700-style. The visuals are pixel art but the sprites are on the whole fantastic, and the environment detail work ranges from competent to excellent. The environments themselves could use some work; it's a bit strange how most of the time, so much of the screen is taken up by empty black void outside of the play area. Some more intelligent viewport control could have helped with that.

The consistency issues extend into the gameplay. Sometimes you can attack faster than other times and it's not always clear why. Some enemies can be dashed through, while others can't. Sometimes a given enemy will kill you almost instantaneously, while other times it will only slightly damage you. I fought a major boss (bosses have a big red lifebar at the bottom of the screen) and sometimes I could stand inside it and whack away, while other times touching any part of it killed me almost instantly. It's not a constant problem, but when these issues crop up they can be pretty frustrating.

While I'm talking about the game's flaws, let me bring up the biggest one: the movement. The player character in Demon Peak runs fast. Very fast. Sonic the Hedgehog fast. This is awesome when it's working for you, because it feels great in combat and in some areas. Much of the game is fairly precise platforming, though, and there's a sort of simulated inertia to the movement that doesn't feel like inertia, it feels like you're constantly in an ice level. The game is slippy and it's hard to move with precision. I've taken ten seconds just to exit a save room because I can't get positioned in front of the door.

So that's a lot of issues, but don't let the above scare you off. The movement can be mastered with a little effort and the rest of the controls are really solid. The combat is fluid and precise, and surprisingly technical. Attacks can be high or low, like a fighting game, as can your (and enemies'!) guard, which reminded me of Zelda II. You end up with a fair range of options, and you can blend light sword attacks and heavy hammer attacks without having to swap weapons. Shortly after the beginning of the game, you get a shield, and you can use it to block or parry enemy blows. 

You don't change weapons or equipment, or anything like that, though. This game is much shallower than say, Symphony of the Night or Valdis Story: Abyssal City. In fact, comparing it to those games is sort of unfair because it's just not the same kind of game really. It's a simpler title that yearns for an earlier era.

The title I can most readily compare it to is Super Metroid, although it's deeper than that game by a fair whack. There are also comparisons to be made to Dark Souls, as it clearly draws inspiration from that title in many elements. The theming, the overall structure, and the ""you will die a thousand deaths"" difficulty all remind of From Software's dark fantasy epic. As I mentioned above, it lacks the RPG mechanics and equipment of that game, and eschews them for a Metroid-style powerup hunt with open exploration and reasons to re-visit past areas. I wish there were more to the game, but then, it was only $4. (Regular price $5.) 

The price is ultimately why I'm giving this game a thumbs-up. It is not a great game, it's not even really a good game. But it's definitely not a BAD game, and it has some aspects (like the sprite art) that are really outstanding. The developers say they're going to keep working on it too, so hopefully it will improve into something really great.

In short, if you like 2D action games like classic Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, and Castlevania titles, pick up Demon Peak and give it a shot. Here's a few tips:

—Try backdashing while attacking, instead of blocking or just tanking the hits. This is especially useful against the little beast enemies that bum rush you.
—You can ""just guard"" or ""parry"" enemy attacks using the shield with good timing. This even works on things you wouldn't necessarily expect to be able to parry. Parrying ranged attacks sends them back at the attacker!
—The spear is a utility tool, and has limited use as a weapon. You can stand on it after you stick it in the wall.
—Don't be afraid to just leap over an enemy, instead of trying to fight it straight up.
—Enemies can damage each other! Bait the mage enemies' magic blasts into their friends.",1499671084,1500475749,True,12,0,0.620952367782592773,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I would say that game feels about 90% finished so it is not unplayable. Actually, it does not start for some people but I did not have that problem myself. After replaying the latest patch most of the small issues were fixed (many of those negative reviews don't reflect the update). My biggest problem with the game is NewGame+ because it changes absolutely nothing. I am a little bit angry at devs because they pushed a balancing update and did not change NG+ difficulty (there goes all that replay value). I thought the gameplay was pretty decent so it made it much more disappointing. I hate this developer but personal feelings aside, I think the game is still worth buying if you see it on sale.

The character starts with only few moves which makes a bad first impression .However, like with most games in this genre, you will find a lot more powers and upgrades overtime. Most of the unlocks are actual new moves and not just stat increases. Default dash controls are a little awkward but you can switch them in options to a more common set up. I think it plays fluidly once you get use to timing special skills .Most of the enemies can be beaten tactically if you know their weakness. The difficulty is pretty fair aside from some unpolished boss fights. Basically you have to find and kill 3 bosses in order to access the final area.

It takes a couple hours to beat depending on your experience. Not that much to explore aside from hidden power ups which might add another hour. Platforming gameplay was average, nothing too special. You can unlock a few different mobility tools like dive-kick and double-jump. The soundtrack was enjoyable depending on the area. I agree with most players that some of the music did not match the tone of the game. In general, the game is at least average in every aspect.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

+ decent combat and platforming gameplay
+ several powers to unlock
+ hidden items
+ enjoyable visuals and music

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

- does not work for some (works for me just fine)
- still has some bugs but not too many
- weak level design
- NewGame+ changes nothing

[b] Verdict 7/10  [/b]

I was really looking forward to what this game could have been. It just feels like the developers were making a good game and abandoned it too quickly. I would enjoy it so much more if NewGame+ actually had increased difficulty (is that not an easy fix?). Damn that one hurts. I don't like how the developers left some people with a broken game and loyal fans without NG+ fix.

To summarize, the game is not ready to be released. There are a plethora of bugs that are nearly inexcusable when selling a ""completed"" game. Not only bugs, but also game design decisions. I'll make this a simple pro/con list. (Although it says 8 hours played, I beat the game in less than 5. At least 3 hours were AFK in menus).

Pros:
+ Very nostalgic Castlevania feel
+ Good art
+ Multiple usable items/skills that can be unlocked
+ Good enemy variety

Cons:
- Some chests (the ""rare"" ones) are empty. You will not be rewarded for finding some of the rarest chests in the game.
- Incorrect map programming. There will be multiple zones of the map where you exit a room and end up 2 rooms away instead of the correct room.
- Missing/Poor textures. Some platforms don't have textures yet and hidden walls underwater have a very awkward texture that makes them stick out like a sore thumb.
- The weakest enemies in the game are some of the strongest and will make the first few minutes very frustrating.
- Bosses are way too easy... I beat the final boss without much of a problem while only having beaten one other boss (I didn't even need this). When I beat the boss, I only had like one health upgrade and one stamina upgrade.
- Although there are many skills, your main auto attack, double-jumping (unlocked) and health potions are all you need to beat the game. Literally.
- Enemies don't have anything to fight against your ""cheese"". Almost every enemy in the game can be ""cheesed""... except for the first/weakest mob in the game and their upgraded counterpart. They are the only difficult enemies because of their extreme speed, damage, and inability to be read.
- There appears to actually be ""debug"" stuff left in the game. Invisible portals, ""notes"" for where merchants should be... not sure if these were debug tools, but they didn't add anything to the game.
- There's actually a point in the game where you can soft lock by getting stuck in a room if you don't have the ground smash yet. You'll have to quit the game and load back in to your last save.
- The soundtrack. I muted the music in the first 5 minutes and played my own music. The music does not fit the game at all. If there are better songs later in the game... then that might be nice. But I doubt it.

So, if the game actually required me to defeat all of the sub-bosses before the final boss, that'd make the game much more enjoyable. If all the bugs I mentioned were fixed, that'd also help. If the  last boss required anything more than the main auto attack, double jump, and health potions... that'd also be nice.",1499658761,1499658761,False,159,1,0.868912279605865479,17,True,False,False,False,,,

The game takes place thus far in a dark medieval fantasy setting akin to Castlevania or Dark Souls, with a variety of enemies from hulking monstrosities to creeping little skulls taking place in a variety of locations including underground tunnels and decrepit monasteries.

The game's biggest problem that turned me off initially while playing (I'm using an Xbox One USB controller) is that the platforming feels somewhat imprecise and a bit like your character's speed builds momentum too fast, it feels a bit like you have to press jump a couple steps before you're about to reach the end of some of the game's smaller platforms. I'm more used to it now but it took a fair amount of getting used to.  The combat as well seems to resemble more of a mash fest versus certain enemies but there is precise timing involved as well. You have a back and forward dash with LB and RB and you also pick up a shield which can block damage.What is there can range in feeling from a mash fest DPS race versus certain enemies (with your default abilities, anyway...) to precise dodges required to defeat bosses. I haven't unlocked a double-jump yet, or another item to unlock something on the ground, so more player abilities will probably add to the player's feeling of mobility and fluidity that may be lacking in the early sections of the game. You can tell early on while exploring the levels whether it be a platform ~just~ out of reach or a strange looking wall that you'll be retreading areas (for better of for worse, I don't mind) with new abilities to unlock the next part of the story once you can ""use the mist."" 

Speaking of the story, it seems very minimal at this point, which I don't mind ambiguity in a game's storyline, but you're pretty much just thrown in to explore without much incentive beyond seeing the new areas and enemies. The game graphically looks great and runs fine, with well-done pixel art for your main character, bosses, enemies, and attacks. The levels have a good variety of where they take place -I just arrived to a Monastery section- but how they take place on some of the platforming sequences do feel a bit uninspired/limited (i.e. I have to jump to how many of these moss platforms before I see something new in the background?) that being said, I imagine a variety of traversal options will speed the pace up quite a bit (double-jump, etc...) The music and sound effects are all really well-done as well.

As others have mentioned, this game is very hard. Some of the enemies I've encountered are unforgiving with no predictability to their movements which keeps players on their toes. The one boss I've beat so far was easy to defeat once I learnt his pattern.

IMPORTANTE

Antes de cualquier cosa, informo de que hay una alpha disponible GRATIS para probar en la página oficial del juego, si os quedáis con dudas después de leer el análisis, o queréis sacar vuestras conclusiones, podéis probarla.

¿Qué es Demon Peak? 
La historia nos cuenta brevemente como el mundo ha sido invadida por demonios y criaturas malignas, todas salidas de la misma montaña: Demon Peak, donde todos los males se concentran. La humanidad es atacada constantemente; Incluso se dice que todo ser humano tiene su contrapartida demoníaca. 
Sabiendo esto, un número de valientes se adentra en la montaña para acabar con estos demonios. Tú eres uno de ellos. 

Y ya está, de momento no puedo contar nada más de la historia, pero realmente, para el tipo de juego que es y a lo que intenta recordarnos, no necesita mucho más. 

Recomiendo este juego por muchos motivos. El primero de ellos es su arte, el arte es muy agradable a la vista , y las animaciones son muy fluidas. Todo conecta como debería: los golpes de los enemigos, tus ataques, los arrojadizos...
Los escenarios también están bastante detallados, aunque la localización tampoco da para mucho (cuevas y demás).

El aspecto sonoro está bien cuidado, quizás el pequeño doblaje de los personajes sea un poco de bajo presupuesto, y suena algo mal, pero en cuanto a música y efectos está bastante conseguido. La música es bastante pegadiza y me recuerda bastante a la saga de Megaman ZX (de hecho, todo me recuerda a esa saga, no sé el porqué)

Jugablemente responde a la perfección. Permitidme que vuelva a compararlo con Megaman ZX o Castlevania Symphony of the Night, pero es que se parece mucho, en lo bueno y en lo malo. Es dificil, pero si dominas el esquive que tienes desde el comienzo del juego, los artefactos que consigues, y el golpear-huir, tendrás una experiencia muy divertida, y casi nunca vas a sentir que has perdido por algun truco sucio del juego. 

Lo he probado con mando de PS4 y con teclado: funciona bien con ambos, pero como es lógico, la posición de serie de las teclas es algo difícil de usar, pero es jugable de sobra. Con mando es muchisimo más asequible, claro está. 

El juego bebe de la cultura asiatica, me gusta especialmente la presencia de los gatos, en concreto, el gran gato que te protege y hace de punto de guardado. 

El último punto a favor es su precio. Por 4 euros, 3 de oferta, yo creo que es un MUY buen producto calidad-precio. Y no sé como de largo es, pero por el trabajo que tiene, ya me parece un buen precio. 


 [ + PROS +]

- Jugabilidad divertida.
- Música pegadiza.
- Gráficos bonitos. 
- Buen precio. 


 [ - CONTRAS  - ]

- Curva de dificultad complicada, como en todo este tipo de juegos. 
- El doblaje patina a veces.
- Controles confusos con teclado al principio.


TE GUSTARÁ SI TE GUSTÓ: 
- Megaman, especialmente ZX.
- Castlevania, cualquiera, pero especialmente las partes de espada en Symphony of the Night.

Having played around an hour and a half of DEMON PEAK I can tell I'm in for a real journey. If you're like me and have a taste for the nostalgic days of Castlevania, Mega Man, Metroid, with a hint of (NES)Ninja Gaiden thrown in for flavor, you're in for a treat. 

LEVEL DESIGN
Let me start the review by comlementing the art of the game - the levels are absolutely stunning with sprites you can tell were hand crafted with the utmost care. When I came upon an ancient ruin with a waterfall pouring over the delapitated stonework it nearly took my breath away. It's one thing to make a game that harkens back to the graphics of old, but to actually take those styles and vastly improve upon them creates a true work of art. The whole world makes me want to explore deeper into the darkness, with many different paths to take I feel like I'm constantly finding something new.

MUSIC
The music and sound effects are top of their class and blend perfectly with the world. It's hard to deside what my favorite song is so far, but I really love Rainy Ridge's theme - those horns are amazing and the whole song gets you pumped. I've found myself rushing to keep up with the tempo, dashing past enemies and closer to the next boss fight. 
Truely a perfect mix of old and new, hints of east asia, western riffs and european orchestras that blend together to form the sounds of the world around you. 

SOUND EFFECTS
You can tell each sound effect was built for a specific purpose, nothing feels repetitive or recycled - giving you audio cues as to what enemy you're up against. The sound of rushing waterfalls, growling demons, massive stomping bosses with hulking hammers the size of your entire body bring the chaotic and dangerous world around you to life.  Each action, each power or item, all seem to have their own sound to them creating a lot of diversity. Everything sounds so organic and real, in fact so real I wonder if they were hand sampled then digitized. 

GAMEPLAY
The game can be played at whatever pace you would like, but I for one see it as an excellent speed running candidate. The mechanics involved in dashing and jumping can become quite complex as you progress through the game. Perfect timing is important when dealing with multiple enemies while assending platforms, some with highly lethal ranged attakcs  others charging you with melee attacks, while also dodging spinning blades attached to some of the platforms. 
It all creates a pretty pulse punding experience and while at times I was having difficulty passing an area it was usually due to my own horrible timing and/or understanding of new/different enemies. Thankfully a save area is never TOO far away and I always found my way back into the fight quickly enough, but not so close as that I didn't feel rewarded for finding the next save zone.
That's something I noticed right off the bat over all, I feel rewarded for progressing in this game where other titles have lacked that same feeling for many years. I remember when games were difficult not for the sake of being difficult, they were challenging to give a sense of accoplishment once you had progressed past a hard boss/platforming area, found the next save, or held onto just enough health to get you there.

END THOUGHTS
DEMON PEAK is going to be quite a ride, I can tell. I'm not a skilled platformer these days, and haven't played a 2D side scroller very seriously in years, but this one has me pulled in and I'm loving it. From the absolutely amazing music and sound effects to the art and design of the levels, this game oozes passion from the developers. It all has a very unique but somehow familiar vibe to it that brings about the feeling of discovery as well as nosalgia. 

While I did find a few minor bugs through the hour and a half I played, I can see that the developers have put a lot of love and time into the game and are sticking with it by rolling out patches as quickly as possible. I've seen them personally address multiple issues people have had and have immence respect that - so many ""AAA"" games or even other indie titles hardly communicate with their community - especially when there is something wrong.  I have faith after theses initial hiccups it'll be smooth sailing from here on out.

[h1]良い点[/h1]

・キャラクター達のアートデザインは全体的にカッコいいものが多い。ピクセルアートが好きな方は気にいることだろう。主人公が日本の甲冑を装備しているのが特にお気に入り。彼のピクセルデザインは目を見張るものがある。

・BGMの出来が非常に良く、引き込まれる。種類が豊富で、エリアを進めて新しいBGMを聴くのが楽しみなってくる。

・主人公は最初、通常攻撃、ジャンプ、回避（ダッシュ）しかできないが、ステージを進むにつれ、サブウェポンを入手したり、新しい技を取得する。戦闘のメカニズムが面白く、取得した技を使用するのには格ゲーの様なコマンド入力をしなくてはいけないが、慣れるとこれが使い勝手が良くて面白い。回復系のアイテムもあり、購入したり、道中で入手できたりする。

・回避や技の使用には緑色のゲージ（所謂スタミナゲージ）を消費し、これを管理するのが重要で、後半に進むほど戦闘によい緊張感をもたらしてくれる。後半は使用可能な技が増え、ボス戦で使うことが多くなってくるからだ。勿論、プレイスタイルにも左右されるが。

・戦闘は主人公の技がある程度は揃ってからの方が面白い。特にボス戦や強力な敵との戦闘が。主人公のHPは簡単に尽きてしまうので、ヒット＆アウェイが基本になってくる。ただ、戦闘に関しては一部の敵は問題がある、こちらは下記の悪い点に書かせてもらう。

[h1]悪い点[/h1]

・キャラクターとステージのデザインが合わない。主人公がウイてしまうステージが多く、デザインの統一性がとられていない印象が強かった。個人的には特に主人公のデザインが好きだったので、余計目立った。

・一部「高難易度」の意味を勘違いした敵のデザイン。敵がむやみやたらに硬く（HPが高い）、こちらの操作ミス待ちという物が多い。慣れてしまうと完全に作業になってしまう。加えて、同じ行動パターンでデザインが違う敵も多い。勿論後半に出てくるものほどHPがさらに高くなっている。

・配信開始時点（2017年0７月0７日）では細かいバグだけではなく、進行不可になるバグ等もあり、デバッグ不足が目立つ。一番致命的だったのがセーブルームから抜けられなくなるバグだ。

[h1]総評[/h1]

少なくとも、このレビューを執筆している時点（2017年0７月08日）ではお勧めできない。購入を検討されている方は今後のアップデートでバグ等が改善されてからでも遅くないと思う。主人公のアクションのメカニズム自体はとても出来が良かったので、残念だ。

The art looked amazing, and gameplay videos I saw looked promising. Unfortunately, there were too many issues to consider this a game worth purchasing.

The controls aren't tight, and I often had trouble making basic jumps I can easily make in other games.

Enemies are far too aggressive at the beginning of the game. There's one enemy that constantly chases you and lunges after you; I didn't even bother fighting it and just jumped over it or ran away. It's the beginning of the game, where players are just getting used to the controls and mechanics. They shouldn't be thrown in to the deep end that quickly.

The shield feels like it's supposed to combat the archer enemies, but it doesn't really do much to succeed in this. The dash feels pretty restricted as well.

The music felt unfitting to the game world.

Overall, I can not recommend this game in its current state. I hope that the developers take these criticisms into account to offer a higher quality experience in the future. I don't want to give up on Demon Peak, but I simply can't enjoy it as it currently is.

First there was no game data in the installation, then a game breaking save bug, then a boss that was just totally broken. After all the crap I went through for buying this on release and 3 hours in game, I have some new opinions.

Let's start with the pros:

[list]
    [*]Very fun, challenging combat with a good selection of moves and items at your disposal.
    [*]Mostly well designed enemies that keep you on your toes and constantly changing your tactics.
    [*]A beautiful, varied game world with great pixel art and a whole lot of style.
    [*]Overall quite good level design with lots of secrets and interesting pathways.
    [*]Awesome soundtrack that at times reminds me of Castlevania's tunes.
    [*]Extremely helpful and quick responding devs that are dedicated to fixing any issues the game has.
    [*]Cats.
[/list]

Onto the cons:

[list]
    [*]Pretty damn steep learning curve that has you frustrated early on due to overly-aggressive enemies that do a ton of damage.
    [*]Some very situational items that you just kind of forget about at times
    [*]Somewhat iffy sound design. Some sounds are just badly made.
    [*]Sometimes overly confusing level layouts and long periods with no save points. (Could be a pro or con depending)
    [*]An overall lack of polish (due apparently to the devs having to rush the game per the publisher's orders). Not too severe, but you can definitely feel it from the raw platforming, the rough inputs for some moves, and the rather minor bugs, such as a few platforms being invisible, one (optional at this time) boss being basically broken, and just a general clunkiness to everything. Like I said, not that severe honestly.
    [*]Personal Con: A lack of weaponry. There's your basic sword, a hammer, a limited throwing axe and a boomerang ninja star. I personally would have liked to have another primary weapon or two. Though to be fair, there's a few moves that are sort of different weapons.
[/list]

Overall, for fans of pixel art games and metroidvanias, I'm going to say I recommend it fully. At $5.00, it's a very good purchase. It's only several hours long (depending) but it's generally a good time.",1499466250,1499495806,True,8,0,0.49628874659538269,2,True,False,False,False,,1499468123.0,"Hi, thanks for the quick review!

We've already identified the exact issue with the said save room, and it will be fixed in the next patch. We hope you have the stamina to give the game another chance!"
