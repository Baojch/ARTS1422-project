There is both good and bad here.

First the good:
- For a low budget indie the voice acting was surprisingly pretty good and did not distract from the game at all
- The graphics are good
- When it works, moving between ""rooms"" is a neat feature (this is roomscale only, with no teleport) 
- Is a bit longer than Blue Entropy's other outings but it is still very short.

Here are the negative points:
- I like holding the torch but on the Vive you have to hold the trigger the entire time you want to keep something held. This becomes very tedious very quickly.
- There is a section where you have to bring objects from one ""room"" to another. Since you cannot place items in any kind of inventory, like a pouch or belt, you have to ferry each item to the room by going back and forth multiple times
- The puzzles are very linear. You only have a single puzzle in front of you and you only ever need to search for items for that puzzle. So basically if you find an item you immediately know it's used to solve the puzzle for the current situation.
- Puzzles are pretty easy. If you are puzzle veteran you will blow through these puzzles. Nothing here is going to stump or confuse you.
- If you quit the game midway or the game crashes, you restart from the beginning every time with no way to skip the opening monologue.

Overall you aren't going to spend more than 10 minutes on this game, and a portion of that is the unskippable monologue and the [spoiler]automated platform ride at the end[/spoiler]. The time you spend solving puzzles is very enjoyable, but you're just left wanting a little more.",1556988600,1556988642,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Occasionally I was frustrated when I couldnt find the missing gem, but I guess thats normal in an escapce room. 
 I did notice a few objects floating in air and it seemed like the rotation of the objects in my hands was off. Maybe this is because I am running a rift through steam. Maybe the game is optimised for vive. I dont know its just a little weird but no big deal. Also some objects were stuck in the air when I threw them and I wanted to smash and break the pottery.

Not the best that is out there for room escape but if your a fan of the genre it's worth a run.

The prior game, 'Cabin' was excellent, but this title returns to the lower quality of the first game 'Gleam'.

The engine configuration resulted in that pixelated UE4 crap fog over everything -- a phenomenon I can't stop complaining about, sorry devs. The verticality of the game was new and interesting, but the triggers to change sections (climb up the ladder, slide through wall crack, etc) were finicky and prone to errant activation. The puzzle was the same thing repeated a few times (collect the gems), which is fine with me, but more effort should have been put into the puzzles or the game, instead of being spend on the story scenes.

Die Rätsel sind nicht besonders schwer und das Spiel ist sehr kurz. Spaß gemacht hat es mir trotzdem, da echtes ""Roomscale"" für dieses Spiel benutzt wird, was der Immersion sehr zuträglich ist. Nettes Spiel aber leider auch nicht mehr.

This gave me a bit of the feel of Indiana Jones on a quest so that's immediately awesome.  The escape room genre is also my thing, and having done a number of escape room/puzzle experiences, I can say with impressiveness that this game made use of a couple new types of puzzles so kudos for originality there, too.

I agree with everyone else on the roomscale, graphics, intuitive puzzles, story, voice overs, etc.

If I had to get tough on my review it would be with (both) endings.  They both felt a bit flat/anti-climatic to me.

Do this one over a long lunch hour for a quick 'escape'.",1492197163,1492197163,True,3,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Leider erlaubt mir die schwarz/weiss Bewertung von Steam keine bessere Möglichkeit.


The Ruins ist ein Escape the Room Spiel... wie der Name bereits ankündigt. ;-)
Vorab folgendes:  Das Spiel ist sehr kurz. 

Ein geübter Spieler wird dieses in 20-30 geschafft haben.

Die Rätsel sind nicht unbedingt immer einfach aber leider sehr langweilig.
Es will nicht so recht Stimmung aufkommen.

Allerdings ist der Soundtrack und die Vertonung der Story auf einem wesentlich höheren Niveau.
Für den Preis dürfte man aber gerne noch ein paar Rätsel dazu packen.


+Guter Sound und Vertonung
+Rätsel sind lösbar
+Story vorhanden
+Room Scale (HTC Vive)


-Die Grafik ist zwar gut aber nicht stimmig
-Sehr Kurzes Spiel
-Langweilige Rätsel

Fazit: Das Spiel könnte mehr aus sich machen. Es sind Gute Ansätze vorhanden doch es wirkt als wenn es nicht fertig wäre.",1492194068,1492194206,True,7,0,0.551882445812225342,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I helped beta test this game for Oculus Rift Touch.  

The immersion and puzzles are realistic and make great use of the environments and the items in the room.  I will be a supporter of Blue Entropy Studios for their intuitive escape room game design.  You can tell there is much thought and effort that goes into making a quality game and experience.  The developer has been very considerate of my opinions and advice and I anticipate their future developments.

It has some buggy mechanics, but nothing that hindered the overall gameplay.  Very comfortable VR experience.  Excellent use of room-scale.  Great story!  Great design!  Great experience!  I highly recommend you purchase this now.  Worth full price!  $6 at release.

In my original review, I mentioned that the graphics were blurry; hence, the developers comment.  This was quickly resolved in an update.  Graphics are now crystal clear.

Created by the same developer of The Cabin, The Ruins is an escape the room game. These short games are perfect for vr and show the virtue of roomscale gaming. What makes the games from this developer a little better than some is the crafty use of space, During the week my room scale is pretty average and yet at no time did i feel it too small, what is more is i did not need to re-orientate myself in the room space….crafty developer had made each room follow on from where you are but lead back into the main part of your roomscale space (very neat! That is holodeck level thinking!)

[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] 
The environments are small and feel perfect for vr (though as with the last game you will find yourself crawling at times, i really need to get that rug for my vr space!). As mentioned above your roomscale space is used in a very good way in game.

[b]GRAPHICS[/b] 
Nothing to complain about here, the atmosphere is in keeping with the theme, good textures, perfect for this type of game.

[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
I did not have any performance issues in my testing of the released version (i helped beta test and can say now that the developer was very quick to fix any bugs or issues, good to see a developer care so much about their game, some triple A titles could benefit from this ideology) 

[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
The game is very intuitive, you will not struggle with the controls.

[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] Low price.
[*] Great atmosphere.
[*] Great use of roomscale.
[*] Well thought out puzzles.
[*] Good sense of achievement when completed.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] Bit short.
[/list]

[b]VERDICT[/b] 
As with The Cabin i have not included a video* as i feel it may be classed as spoilers due to the short length of the game. However do not let the short length put you off, again think of the cost as a rental, escape the room games do tend to be short and i can certainly say i really enjoyed playing this one. If you are a fan of escape the room games then this is a must get!

*a solution video will be on my channel later today for anyone stuck :)
