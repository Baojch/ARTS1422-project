The different puzzles string together a touching tale of one young woman's life-or-death battle against illness.

[b] Summary [/b]
The game begins with the protagonist, Beth floating peacefully within a bubble. The end of her life is approaching, and she has decided to take a few minutes to reflect on her life's journey.

[b] Overall [/b]
Labyrinthine Dreams is a great short narrative-centric game. The soundtrack is surprisingly diverse for a game that is so short in length. The game utilizes conventional game mechanics to tell a deeply moving tale of finding love of life even while staring death in the face.

Rating: 8/10

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706952365,1706952365,True,1,0,0.464285701513290405,0,True,False,False,True,,,

其次，剧情叙述是游戏的一大卖点，然而实际剧情推进过程中，故事线索模糊不清，角色塑造苍白无力，背景设定浅尝辄止，很难让玩家真正沉浸在游戏的世界观中。对话选项虽多，但似乎对剧情走向的影响甚微，让人感觉选择的自由度只是一种表面形式。

再者，游戏的画面表现和音效方面亦不尽人意。虽然采用了手绘风格的画面，但由于分辨率较低，细节处理粗糙，无法给玩家带来赏心悦目的视觉享受。同时，背景音乐及环境音效单一重复，无法营造出与游戏情境相符的氛围，进一步削弱了游戏的整体沉浸感。

在操控和兼容性方面也存在一定的技术问题。偶尔出现的卡顿、延迟反应，以及对部分硬件配置的支持不佳，都影响了玩家顺畅游戏的体验。

综上所述，《Labyrinthine Dreams》在核心玩法、剧情编排和视听呈现等方面均存在显著缺陷，未能充分挖掘迷宫探索题材的潜力，也未能利用好叙事元素增强游戏的情感共鸣。对于期待深度剧情与精巧解谜相结合的玩家来说，这款游戏恐怕难以满足其期待。真心希望开发团队能够倾听玩家反馈，对游戏进行彻底改进，以实现最初设计的美好愿景。",1647539476,1710322262,False,2,0,0.521135091781616211,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay involves players finding their way through an invisible maze, in a seemingly simple map.

While this is my first maze-like narrative game, more often than not the frustration of the design annoys me and I find myself losing the core point of the plot due to that. The rule of ""you can only turn right after taking a loop at this spot"" often have me wondering if it's a hardware or software malfunction, than the idea of ""sometimes life requires a sidetrack"" that the narrative is trying to tell me.

Add to the fact sometimes there's an input lag, and you miss that exact one square to turn and walk into an invisible dead end, with no chance to simply turn around to redo that part, instead of retracing that one step.

Quite often than not, I find myself trying to recall the exact precise layout of an invisible map, than the plot or message of the game. 

I do applaud the effort taken though, even if it's a bit lost to me among the frustration of trying to experience it, especially the effort to put in voice acting and audio composition.

If I may make a suggestion to the devs, add in a feature that can show the player the paths they have taken, and some of the invisible walls they had encountered, so they can at least have some information to work with.",1644186184,1644186184,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

After a traumatic childhood and a tough entry into the world of adulthood, she was just starting to take control of her life. However, she is now up against an insidious enemy who threatens to take everything away from her. During what may be her final hours, Beth wanders through important moments in her life while also staying a few steps ahead of the monster who won’t rest until she is no more.

Mazes in dreams are said to symbolize the dreamer’s feeling of “being trapped.” As Beth tries to find meaning and strength in her life, players must guide her through a variety of mazes, each with its own twist. The most challenging sections are reserved for confrontations with the monster, who must be outmaneuvered and outwitted to proceed.

Labyrinthine Dreams - это короткая игра-головоломка о Бет, молодой женщине, которая стоит на пороге смерти. После травмирующего детства и трудного вступления в мир взрослой жизни она только начинала контролировать свою жизнь. Однако теперь она столкнулась с коварным врагом, который угрожает отнять у нее все. Во время того, что может быть ее последними часами, Бет блуждает по важным моментам в своей жизни, оставаясь также на несколько шагов впереди монстра, который не успокоится, пока ее больше не будет.


Лабиринты во сне, как говорят, символизируют чувство сновидца “быть пойманным в ловушку.” Пока Бет пытается найти смысл и силу в своей жизни, игроки должны вести ее через множество лабиринтов, каждый из которых имеет свой собственный поворот. Самые сложные разделы предназначены для конфронтации с монстром, которого нужно перехитрить и перехитрить, чтобы продолжить.

游戏表现上类似于走迷宫，但如果初玩的话很容易一脸懵逼：
整张地图类似于由大量单向道路构成，在这些道路上，除非你正好唯一多条线路的交叉点上，否则你只能不停往前移动
而这些路线你又是肉眼所无法观测的，只能依靠反反复复的尝试后才能得出正确的路线

除了这些迷宫外，每一个大场景中间还存在另一个玩法的逃脱小游戏
在这个类型的游戏里，你需要躲避一个不停查着你当前位置追赶过来的恶魔，利用卡视角的方法诱导它的移动轨迹，最终在不被它追到的前提下达到终点

游戏总体关卡数量并不多，关卡玩多了以后其实也大致能猜到作者设计的移动轨迹会有哪些，在此基础上多作几次尝试后也就能通关了

The writing was bad. Really bad. Mind you, that's not really all that surprising for an RPG Maker game. What [i]is[/i] surprising is that they actually hired voice actors to deliver the bad dialogue. Ouch! A more economical use of the budget probably would have been to just hire a better writer instead.

I'm a big believer in the idea that, when it comes to games, the gameplay should reinforce the theme or tone. Here, the puzzles are just that -- puzzles -- and they really don't fit the theme at all; they just feel like busywork. Tonally, the taxicab segment was especially jarring.

Lastly, regarding the theme, I feel like this game missed a chance to say something worthwhile about -- I don't know -- [b]anything[/b]. The game could have addressed mental illness, capitalism, or end-of-life care. Instead, what we're treated to is superficial, mawkish, and aggressively tin-eared. Nor does the game have anything to say about the black hole of suck that is healthcare in the United States. (This game is already short at two hours; just how imagine how short it would be if it were set in Canada!)

Я не могу назвать геймдизайнера этой игры никем иным, кроме как садистом. Эта игра - как издевательно, и лишний раз доказывает, что rpg-,maker, не тот движок, на котором стоит делать игры.Почему? Ну, сам движок для этого слабо предназначен, да я еще и  не видел ни одной игры, которая на этом движке выдала бы мне нечто особенное, что хотя-бы стоило своих денег хоть капельку.

В самой игре не jrpg, а самая тупая форма пазла. Тоесть, 25% от потенциально нормальной игры на рпг-мейкере тут выдают за 100%, хоть и короткую игру. Сюжет мутный, диалоги озвучены посредственно, но из них ничего не ясно. Какое-то нытье главной героине о её отце и собственной гибели и без того унылой жизни. В общем - сопли  14-летних девочек. Первый же лабиринт, что встретился мне в игре, довел меня до точки кипения и бешенства. Если в твоей игре есть 4 типа лабиринтов, и самый сложный из них ты ставишь в начало игры - то это не самое лучшее решение, друзья. Представьте себе лабиринт в изометрии, где ходить можете в 4 разных направления. Но нельзя ходить влево и назад. Звучит не сложно, правда? А что, если я скажу вам, что управление менятся в зависимости от того, в какую сторону смотрит персонаж. Правда  интуитивно?! Зато есть поддержка геймпада. В игре, где первый же пазлл - это сломанное управление в лабиринте.  Просто восхитительно чувствовать себя владельцем геймпада в такие моменты.

Вишенкой на торте является длс -это саундтрек к игре. Он продается как отдельно, так в паке с игрой.  То, что это унылая дрисня, никого не волнует. Главное, что контент есть, который можете купить дополнительно.

Przyjemna gra logiczna na silniku RPGMaker (bodajże XP, ale głowy sobie za to odrąbać nie dam). Wcielamy się w rolę dziewczątka, które... Dalej nic nie zdradzam, ale fabuła raczej nie jest mocną stroną tej gry. Pomimo udźwiękowienia (niezbyt częsta sprawa w tego typu grach), dramat całej tej opowieści zdaje się być ""wymuszony"" i robiony na siłę. Momentami pachnie tumblr'owym blogiem lub ""sztuką dla sztuki"". Bez bicia, przyznam, że większość dialogów/monologów przeskoczyłem.

Gierka podzielona jest na serię maleńkich labiryntów/poziomów podzielonych na grupy. Każda grupa posiada własny sposób na ich pokonanie. Po każdej grupie następuje grupa poziomów z bestią, ścigającą protoganistkę przez labirynt. Grafika przerywników to w większości proste arty (ala devianart, a przynajmniej takie mam wrażenie). Grafika poziomów to w większości lekko zmodyfikowane zasoby podstawowe RPGMaker. Oprócz własnej muzyki i udźwiękowienia części dialogów, użyto typowych efektów dźwiękowych silnika.

Całą grę pokonałem w 70 minut, wliczając w to 15 minut, kiedy musiałem odejść od komputera (gra działała dalej) i wielokrotne podejścia do poziomów. Zresztą połowę byłem w stanie przejść za pierwszym razem. krzywa uczenia tutaj raczej nie istnieje. Wszystko zależy od tego jak szybko odkryjecie sposób na przejście poziomu.

Ogółem: Za krótka. Za mało ""polerki"", ale interesująca. Rzadko przechodzę do końca tego typu gry.

This game has a million problems in terms of gameplay, plot and dialogue but it's good, I say, it's good!

2. It's short but complete. This is a good choice if you have a free evening and aren't ready to commit to dozens of hours of gameplay and just want to drink a few beers and hold a controller. 

3. The million problems I mentioned in 1, they are made up for by the actor who plays Beth, the main character. I can't find her name anywhere (it was in the final credits but I didn't write it down or anything) but I will find it someday and hopefully update this review. Maybe she will be famous and we can all be glad for her.

4. The other actors were not all that great but nobody really ruined anything.

5. This is an RPG Maker game. I don't give a shit but I guess this drives some nerds up the wall so I thought I'd mention it. I'm not that kind of nerd myself but everyone has their quirks. Not gonna judge.

6. The core of this game is puzzles. They are pretty alright. I was kinda close just once to looking up a video to solve one of them but mostly they are just tough enough to be satisfying and no more. 

7. I thought the first section was actually the toughest by far and then breezed through the rest of it until the very last one. 

8. Storywise... I dunno... This is kinda sentimental for my taste. It's too sweet for this bitter old man. I'd prefer if in the end the protagonist lost her shit and hijacked a dirigible and crashed it into your mom. Though, I do suspect it'd be difficult to tell which large body is the dirigible and which is you mom. 

9. Part of[i] Labyrinthine Dreams[/i] story involves the notion of starting an art gallery. This section is so incredibly naive about how the art world works, it's borderline insanity. Mrs. LogicalFrank is a pro-fessional international type artist so I know for sure.

10. I actually did not realize until just this moment the game was called[i] Labyrinthine Dreams[/i]  and not [i] Labyrinth Dreams[/i]. I'm dumb but that's the least of my problems.

11. I played this w/ a controller and, by god, the controller support here is balls on ass. I was constantly having to restart puzzles because I walked one step to far accidentally. There were levels where this happened five or six times to me. It took two days after finishing the game for me to stop being angry about this. 
 
12. I kinda dug the overhead style art in this. It wasn't ground breaking but it was simple and effective enough. The anime-style cut scenes I was less crazy about. Everyone was just too darn good looking. 

13. It is kind of hard to not notice this feels like a first or at least early effort by the developers. There's lots of rough edges here and some aspects that are kinda amateur hour if I'm being honest. Still, I found this compelling and got more and more involved in the plot as the game rolled on. You can play it in an evening and it's good enough to be worth an evening's time so play it.",1491180724,1491180724,True,4,0,0.591175258159637451,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Controls are laggy.  Odd complaint for a puzzle game I know, but it results in inadvertant moves and since there's no undo you have to reset.

Labyrinthine Dreams - это приключенческий квест про молодую девушку по имени Бет, которая находится на грани жизни и смерти, и старается отсрочить свою кончину.


Действительно стоящая инди-игрушка в жанре головоломок, графикой под ретро, качественной озвучкой и музыкальным сопровождением. Однако игра на данный момент включает в себя только английский язык, так что без знания хотя бы его основ вам будет крайне сложно не только понять суть сюжета, но и ориентироваться в необходимых действиях игры.


Итак, хорошая история, интересные, необычные способы ""сломать"" мозг, неплохая рисовка и отличное звуковое сопровождение - вот что вы встретите, если решитесь попробовать поиграть в эту игру.

Tja Leute! Nach langer Zeit suchte ich wieder mal ein RPG-Maker Game das ich zocken könnte und fand beim stöbern meiner Bibliothek dieses Kleinod. Es wird in der Beschreibung schon darauf hingewiesen, dass es sich hierbei um ein kurzes Game handelt, aber dennoch ist es einen Versuch wert.

Kurz mag schon stimmen, aber dafür empfängt es uns mit einer netten und gleichzeitig traurigen Stroy um Leben und Tod. Untermalt werden die hübschen Englisch vertonten Dialoge von schöner, dramatischer und passender Musik. 

Das Gameplay wiederrum sticht auch von den normalen Games hervor. Es gilt einige Labyrinthe zu bewerkstelligen, wo mehrmals schon andere Konditionen zum Erreichen des Zieles verhanden sind. 

Es beinhaltet Sammelkarten und Achievments die man locker in maximal 2 Stunden Spielzeit schaffen könnte (wenn man sich die Achievment-Bedingung vorher ansieht, dann weit aus schneller)

Vom Preis her gibt es Spiele die eindeutig länger dauern, doch dank des Charme dieses Games ist der Preis fast gerechtfertigt.

""Labyrinthine Dreams"" est un jeu très court comme annoncé mais au contenu étonnement riche et bien construit. Vous incarnez Beth une jeune femme et vous devrez la sortir d’une succession de labyrinthes qui ne sont en faite qu’une représentation de ce qu’elle ressent. La narration et la musique collent parfaitement avec l’ambiance de cette sympathique histoire qui flirt entre rêve et réalité. 
Les graphismes sont certes très loin des chef d’œuvre de 3D qu’on nous pond aujourd’hui mais ils restent agréables dans le genre et ont le mérite de ne pas trop faire chauffer votre pc. 
Le jeu est vraiment court mais le prix a été plutôt bien adapté en conséquences. Si vous ne vous jeter pas sur les solutions il vous divertira quand même pendant quelques petites heures, certains labyrinthes nécessitant un peu plus de réflexion que les autres. 

[h1]En conclusion :[/h1] 
""Labyrinthine Dreams"" est un jeu court mais sympathique. Ce n’est certes pas le jeu de l’année mais il est parfait pour se changer un peu les idées ou se vider la tête le temps d’une soirée ; à la condition bien-sûr d’aimer résoudre des puzzles ou labyrinthes. Je recommande !

The puzzle types seem to reflect the themes of the girl's life. First is the only-turn-right puzzle, which is about the ""right"" choice that society seems to press on us, and on her father and her in the story. Frustrating, but the ""rule"" dictates that it's the only way they can advance.
The second puzzle, which actually spans throughout the game, is the battle with her disease, and the rule is very unfair for her.
The third puzzle is turning the car in the direction of the arrows. This relates to her father, who died in a car accident. But, through her father and mother's words, things are not quite so.
The fourth puzzle is step on all tiles. I think it reflects her dream, to dream high up in the sky and conquer all.
The fifth puzzle is when she's free of her body, drifting away in space, finding the way to her ""ship"".
The game tries to convey the optimistic message that even all goes wrong, there is still hope, and you can get through it no matter what. A little too optimistic and simple to be honest, but I can't say it's wrong. People are different and complicated, one solution is right for this person may not work on the other, but I value its effort.

The game has a story that a lot of people could relate to in one way or another, with a lot of depth.  Don’t believe those saying the game and the story are disconnected, as they’re actually really tightly connected on a very deep level.  I can’t get into it more than that without giving too much away, but if you wander around and use (Z Key) the random objects in the very first area it’ll start to paint a picture for you that’s fairly easy to follow.

This game is mostly a puzzle game where you have to plan your movements carefully in order to complete each area.  Sometimes you have to outthink the moves of other NPCs.  Sometimes you are limited in the directions you can turn.  Sometimes the ground even vanishes as you use it, leaving you having to carefully plan your route to the end.  Sadly I do have a couple gripes with the game and I’ll go through them one at a time;

First, I found the limitation on video resolutions to be a bit of a letdown.  The game is set to a strict resolution (640x480) and that’s the only video mode there is.  You can go to a full-screen mode in which the area around the window is just black, or you can stretch it to full-screen which has the effect of seriously degrading the video quality.  For those with wide-screens, even the full-screen stretch leaves you with black letterboxing on the left and right.  I would have liked to have seen at least a high-resolution mode added for those (like myself) who have resolutions set over 1600x900.

Secondly, I found there were several bugs that heavily affected game play to the point where exiting and reloading the game was the only option.  The most notorious bug was the “Additional Keys Disabled” bug which hit me within the first 3 maps.  The map was designed so I could only do left-hand turns and walk forward but suddenly (after a map reset) I found myself ONLY able to walk forward.  The game had accidentally disabled the left-hand turns in addition to the right-hand turns.  I was unable to correct the problem without exiting the game.  I also found the “bad guy” would sometimes get stuck and the AI couldn’t figure out how to chase me, which made some maps too easy.

All in all the bugs aren’t really enough for me to not recommend this game.  The cost of a few bucks is a fair price and if you can see the link between the story and the puzzles you’ll really enjoy it.

Ich bewerte das Spiel hier nach der Werbung des Herstellers und der Erfahrung die ich beim durchspielen gesammelt habe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A unique and emotionally powerful story with vivid characters and potent real-world themes

Das einzige was ich daran so durchgehen lassen kann, ist das ""real-world theme"" also das realistische Szenario. Einzigartig ist die Story nämlich auf keinen Fall, da man sie schon in etlichen anderen Spielem schon einmal gesehen hat. Emotional ist auch für meine verhältnisse zu hochgegriffen. Dafür ist einfach die Erzählweise und die Länge des Spiels nicht ausreichend, um dieses Kriterium meines Erachtens nach zu erfüllen.


*A variety of mazes which challenge players while complementing the narrative

Herausfordernde Labyrinthe ist ein wenig übertrieben. Es kann vielleicht herausfordernd für jemanden sein der noch in der Grundschule ist, aber darüber hinaus denke ich nicht das es wirklich schwer ist, geschweige denn herausfordernd wenn man die paar Labyrinthe und Story in gut 60 Minuten durch spielt.



*Gorgeous artwork that brings the surreal world of Beth’s unconscious to life. 

Bei dem Artwork kann man wieder streiten, ob es einem gefällt oder nicht. Ich für meinen Teil denke es erfüllt seinen Zweck, aber mehr auch nicht, da es jetzt auch nicht herausragend ist.


*Voice acting that drives home the story’s emotion
Hier ist das einzige was ich dem Spiel als großen Pluspunkt anerkennen muss. Nicht nur ist eine Sprachausgabe enthalten, auch merkt man das sich die Sprecher Mühe gemacht haben den Charakteren, eine Personalität zu geben und nicht einfach ihren Text runter sprechend wie man es aus manchen Vollpreistiteln kennt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAZIT:

Lasst euch nicht von den Versprechungen ders Herstellers täuschen. Es ist ein ganz einfaches Spiel, das man einmal gespielt haben KANN und dann eigentlich wieder in der Bibliothek versauern lässt.
Für 2€ kann man sich das Spiel kaufen, wenn man unbedingt ein bisschen rätseln möchte mit einer leichten 08/15 Geschichte und einer netten Sprachausgabe.

First, the gameplay is just so clunky and slow. There was multiple times while playing that I needed to move in a straight line for a long time and ended up zoning out, since it takes about 1 second to move a single tile, and overshot where I needed to go and needed to reset the map. This led to me just getting more bored with the game and encountering this issue more often. I don't believe this is a limitation to the RPG Maker engine, but was instead a design choice by the programmers. If the game changed the speed, or was even just mouse controlled instead of controlled with the arrows, I would say the that puzzles were better.
The overall quality of the puzzles though, well, it all goes downhill after the first batch. The forest puzzles where you need to go in each direction was really neat and I'd never seen something like that before, the car puzzles were just boring with no way to fail and could be solved just by mashing directions, the demon puzzles weren't too bad but they felt inconsistent, the sky puzzles were a step up in quality from the car and demon ones, and then the game ended on sliding puzzles which no one likes.

Now my second criticism of the game is the story. I didn't like the story, but that's not what I'm going to complain about. The game has you solve these completely unrelated dream puzzles and then it feeds you a bit of story. Meaning the story and gameplay are completely disconnected. Unlike something like Professor Layton, where you solve various puzzles for people to get information to progress the game's plot, or even to solve something blocking your progress, this game has you solve completely random puzzles.
The game said in the credits that this game's story is based off of a story written by the creators of the game, personally I'd say just go read that.",1471745737,1471745737,False,4,0,0.586466193199157715,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- tradding cards to collect...
- nice music
- nice voice acting
- good riddle design

CONS:
- ...but you need to grind the last one

CONCLUSION:
I would recommend this game for finishing once. The story is nothing special, but not too bad either. But the real strength of the game lies inside of the riddles. They\'re very clever made and you need to think really well, to finish each challenge. The game never get\'s too hard, but is never as easy, that it becomes boring. The voice acting is nice, like the music too, but again nothing special. For achievement hunters is to say, 100% is a piece of cake. Trading card collector need to grind for the last card. Because I completed the game with 100% achievements in 3 hours, but I need to grind another 2 hours. (\\ô/)",1464744297,1464744297,True,2,0,0.533678770065307617,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Challenging if you don't pay attention to the rules, however, so no skipping dialogue and zipping ahead!  Well, still a challenge in places, but in a fun way, not a ""zomg, I've headbutted a hole in my wall!"" kind of way, like if you ignore the rules instructions.

This is a short but enjoyable maze-puzzle game with trading cards and 7 semi-easy achievements.  It needs at least 2 playthroughs, with the first to map mazes with resets, and 1 playthrough for the no-resets cheevo... or just stare at the pictures-provided guides right here on Steam to do it all in 1 playthrough  =^_^= (found the guide after mapping several mazes  T_T  ). 

If you like maze-puzzles, want a good game for trading cards, or just another game to 100%, this is your game right here! 
This game is also good from a story view point, as it chronicles key points in the main character's (Beth's) life.
WARNING: If you cry easily, make sure to have a box of tissues nearby, because the story is definitely sad (if you couldn't guess from the ""About"" section of the store page).

Lastly, a small sidenote: Usually I don't buy game soundtracks on Steam, but am considering it for this game:  The music in this game is simple, but hauntingly good, and enhances the sob potential in the storyline (at least for me).  No tinny 8-bit music or rock & roll, but soft, haunting (yes, I know I already used that word, but it IS!) melodies that have a noticeably decent quality unusual for most cheap games.

I saw the news post on Labyrinthine Dreams' price reduction from whatever it was before (I think $4.99?) to encourage people to not abuse Steam's refund policy, but I would have paid that and then some just for the music, the mazes/gameplay, or the story alone (even better, Steam Trading Cards for Badges!).  All 3, combined with beautiful artwork, makes for a masterpiece equal to or maybe better in some areas than many big-name SNES games (and we know how much money THOSE were, even back in the day!).  I remember paying much more than that for Myst for my PC when it first came out, and accidentally beat THAT game in less than 10 minutes!  As a kid!

This game is definitely a wonderful addition to any game library, especially for the (imo way too low) current price tag, and if you normally play games on mute, you'll want to unmute your computer for this game.",1463895827,1463895827,True,3,0,0.552845537662506104,0,True,False,False,False,,,

„Es ist nur eine weiteres RPG-Maker ähnliches Spiel. Von denen gibt es doch schon bereits tausende auf Steam!“ -  klein Timmy, 2016
Timmy hat damit wohl möglich recht, jedoch ist dieses Spiel jeden Cent Wert! 
	Ich selbe habe mir das Spiel gekauft, weil ich das Vorschaubild von Steam schön fand. Ich ging das Spiel ohne Erwartung an und fand es einfach nur bezaubernd. Die Musik passt zum grübeln der Puzzeln und untermauerte die Erzähler. Das Spiel hat nämlich eine Voice-Wiedergabe! Das komplette Spiel ist vertont was mich positiv überrascht hat. Die Stimmen sind sehr angenehm und passen zu den Charakteren und deren derzeitigen Situation. Doch welche Geschichte wird eigentlich erzählt? Das Spiel ist leider nur 2 Stunden lang und die meiste Zeit geht beim lösen der Rätseln davon. Nur soviel: Die junge Dame Beth, die Protagonistin, hat den plötzlichen Tod ihres Vaters nicht so gut verkraftet, wird darauf hin depressiv und fragt sich warum das ausgerechnet ihr passiert ist und warum sie nicht einfach sterben kann. 
	Um diese Fragen dreht sich dann auch das Spiel. Sie erzählt von ihren Schicksalsereignissen und findet schlussendlich auch antworten auf ihre Fragen.",1463835924,1467551918,True,3,0,0.566666662693023682,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Для игры такого масштаба - отлично.
К сожалению, за такой промежуток времени нельзя целиком погрузиться в сюжет, вы только начинаете туда вливаться а оно уже заканчивается.
Но между делом это можно так же назвать плюсом. Ведь вовремя закончить подачу сюжета не менее трудно, чем вовлечь читателя или игрока. И в какой-то мере здесь это сделано добротно.

You'll notice that my time played on the game is quite short. How about that.

I like puzzles. I play a lot of games with ACTUAL puzzles. But mazes aren't puzzles as far as I'm concerned; there is no brain involved. Here, they've tried to add a little brain by making each set of mazes have a different rule which they don't tell you. Or maybe they try to tell you. I THINK the game was trying to tell me the ""rule"" of the forest maze, but did so in such bad English that it took me three screens to realize the actual rule: In the forest, you can't turn left or back up. That's it.

So then I went and looked at some walkthroughs and realized the rest of the game was just more mazes, with a rule change every four maps or so, plus a story which, frankly, seems pretty obvious just from the first few panels of dialogue and the unsubtle clues in the maps (really, IV stands scattered all over the woods, that's the best you can do?). Yeah, yeah, dying, hallucinating, in the hospital, replaying life, trying to figure out whether to go on, monsters from the brain - I've seen that before, seen it done better.

Oh, well. That's why I buy 'em cheap.

--- Diabetes-inducing story about overcoming an illness through sheer force of will. Nice gutpunch for all the people that lost a loved one *cough* lost twin to cancer *cough*. Apparently THOSE people didn't try hard enough.

- Feels. So many. Your experience may vary.
- Some puzzle mechanics are quite unique, enjoyable for a few minutes.
- Easily refundable if that is your wish. I didn't.
- If you ARE a person that's depressed/starving artist/currently suffering from illness this might get you the extra push to keep going. Highly unlikely that you'll be surfing games for your emotional support, but still.

游戏主要流程是解谜-跑场景过剧情-解谜，因此解谜占的比例也是相当大，将近70%的样子。由于RM机能限制，大部分谜题是在特定条件下移动到出口的类型，个人感觉设计者在这方面也算用心，至少每一关的限制种类不一样。这一类谜题有攻略没攻略两个难度，反正有攻略也就不多说了。总的来说是个可以拿来打发时间的小游戏，没必要特意买。本作有卡有成就，成就很好刷。",1451822181,1451822181,True,6,1,0.605129063129425049,7,False,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay was a mixture of puzzles, that were equal in quality and complexity to the gyms in Pokemon (and I'm not kidding, the puzzles were replicas of ones features in those (yes, I know Pokemon didn't come up with them first)).

-while very cliched Beth is a good character and it's easy to relate to her thoughts

-the mazes are fairly interesting and challenging

-good soundtrack

-it's fully voice acted, a true rarity for RPGMaker games

[b]CONS:[/b]

-the gameplay is very simple and boils down to solving a maze/ puzzle followed by a cutscenes, there's very little variety in it

-the narrative is a bit ham-fisted with lines that are a bit too blunt and cliched

-while the voice actors are decent the actual sound recording can be a bit off or noisy at times

-pretty short, expect around an hour to an hour and a half

Labyrinthine Dreams was an ok game, while it doesn't do anything particularly well it also has no major problems. The story is quite simple and sadly somewhat marred by a narrative that lacks finesse in dealing with its subject matter, you can expect some pretty obvious lines dealing with depression or being stuck in life. The gameplay is decent with mazes you must navigate with limitations on your movement (e.g. can't turn left), other places where you must clear all tiles touching them only once or have to outmaneuver a monster that follows certain movesets.

If you like these kind of puzzles and are ok with its simple story then Labyrinthine Dreams is a decent choice considering it's fairly priced for what it does even when not on sale.",1448775007,1450636182,True,12,0,0.649551510810852051,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a short puzzle-adventure game in which you play as a girl struggling with her inner doubts and thoughts, which have manifested into a literal demon that constantly drives her away from her goals and the people she loves. Ludically, this boils down to some traversal puzzles coupled with stages where you outrun a demon in a turn-based maze. Again, not much to it, but it comes together quite well and serves the story.

This is also one of the rare moments where a developer knows the advantages of video games as a medium. At the end (SPOILERS), you are running from the demon down a long hallway, which you can't possibly win (becuase the demon moves twice as fast as you). Then, as Beth comes to terms with her past, you can outrun the demon at last (3 spaces per turn to the demon's 2). You can defeat your demon, but you have to keep moving.

These are the kinds of things, though a little blatantly obvious here, that you can't really convey in any other medium.

First, I think it might be a little too short. You can potentially beat the game with all achievements in about half an hour. Since it's such a straightforward game, there's not a whole lot of replay value. That means leaving it idle to get the card drops. Having the player make choices throughout the game that change how the story plays out could add to replay value and give an opportunity to flesh out the story some.

Second, the game engine is great for 16bit RPGs, but I think this game would have been better suited with something else. A different engine, even something like GameMaker Studio or GDevelop (which is free, open source, and easy to use), would allow more versatillity with the graphics, controls, layout, interface, and also easily port to other platforms, even mobile. This game doesn't use the biggest advantages that RPGMaker has over other engines, which would be inventory, battle system, character stats, etc.

These drawbacks don't mean it's not worth getting though. It's definitely worth a play. The graphics and visuals are rather good for the engine. It has a great story with meaning to it, even though it leaves some stuff to the imagination, which can be good in a case like this. Also, the voice acting is top notch for a game that's telling a story.

The mazes are rather creative. They look really simple, but the machanics of how each one gives it a challenge. It's nice to see mazes that are actually puzzles... or would it be puzzles that are actually mazes?

At any rate, definitely give this game a try if you like story driven puzzle games. It's short, but also cheap.",1445945814,1445945814,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Wcielamy się w niej w Beth, młodą kobietę bliską śmierci. Gra przeplata wydarzenia z dzieciństwa dziewczyny wraz z wytworami jej wyobraźni i opowiada emocjonalną historię, poruszającą problemy życia codziennego. Opowieści słucha się przyjemnie, głównie ze względu na dobrą grę aktorską postaci. Pod względem rozgrywki, Labyrinthine Dreams to mieszanka różnych labiryntów. Na jednych planszach możemy skręcać tylko w prawo, na innych zatrzymujemy się dopiero po napotkaniu ściany, a na jeszcze innych musimy stanąć na każdym polu planszy dokładnie raz.

Oprócz dojścia z jednego końca mapy na drugi, musimy nie dać się złapać demonowi, który z każdym naszym jednym robi dwa kroki i stara się do nas zbliżyć.

Something in my brain tells me that from a literary standpoint this saccharine monologue told within the dreams of a terminal cancer patient on her death-bed is shallow and driven primarily by the player’s emotions. But what I’ve come to find more and more lately as I’ve begun to take steps to break myself out of depression and hopefully come out the other side a happier person, is…I don’t care what that part of me says anymore.

Labyrinthine Dreams’ may lack nuance and come accompanied by some dreadful artwork (those facial expressions are the stuff of nightmares), but its sincerity and earnestness meant so much more to me than what questionable character designs or clichéd plot points could take away.

Perhaps it’s a tired tale; an expected narrative being directed at people like myself who see themselves so easily in the mundane lives of struggling artists forced to give up on their creative dreams under the weight of a socioeconomic machine. Maybe I’m just looking for reassurance that I’m not throwing my life away by not pursuing a more marketable degree and Labyrinthine Dreams is the relatable, consoling voice I’ve been longing to hear. But then, is that such a bad thing to want? Even if it’s at times trite, does that diminish Labyrinthine Dreams’ message of hope to those in need of it?

This isn’t a review. You’ve likely realized that by now. It’s not a critical interpretation of a work or even a basic bullet-pointed list of pros and cons. It is almost nothing, but in what few words I’ve found to describe my feelings toward Labyrinthine Dreams, I hope it’s clear that it connected to me in a very personal way. It wasn’t deep; I can’t describe it in thousands of words dripping in analogical prose and life stories; I find myself struggling to even write enough to feel as if it could serve as a legitimate recommendation.

All I can say is that Labyrinthine Dreams is honest. Honest about what it is, in its characters, even in its fantasies. It’s solemn and optimistic, that no matter how badly it could go wrong and how much everyone tells you you’re living in a dream, your life is worth more than a paycheck and losing the chance to do what you love. A few years ago I’d have rolled my eyes. Now, this simple positivity has come to mean something deeper to me, and I’m thankful every day that there are people who understand that sometimes all anyone needs is encouragement.

First [i]Serena[/i], then [i]Cahors Sunset[/i], and now [i]Labyrinthine Dreams[/i]... This is starting to become a habit. I wouldn't like to seem like a tragedy junkie. I just wished to play an RPG maker game, and look what it has done to me: all teary eyed and big with the decision on Carpe Diem!

In [i]Labyrinthine Dreams[/i], our protagonist is Beth; a young woman who is crippled with anxiety, due to the timeless death of her father. In many ways, she is terrified that she may end up just like him. She is trying to deal with judgement, apathy and depression while recounting the events of her life from a dreamlike perspective. She travels within many dream fragments that symbolize both important moments of her life and her hopes, dreams and fears: namely her inner world. Within those dreams, she constantly tries to escapes from a monster, a dark creature that comes after her. For every step that Beth takes, the monster can take two. Is she doomed to end up in the grasp of her inner demon despite whatever she tries?

The gameplay is the marriage of a visual novel and a refreshing selection of movement puzzles. Puzzles are decent, and takes some time to figure all if you were not to use a guide. I'd like to add that, every detail that you come across, alongside with the nature of puzzles you solve, the game world is genuinely symbolic. You shouldn't expect a straight forward story consistency. The story works around the linear concept that you expect from an RPG maker game. For example: for the first puzzle that you come across - The Forest - you are not allowed to make left turns. It gave me the sense that Beth is forced to abide by the expectations of society: one way only. There should be millions of other paths that she could take to finish the labyrinth, but she is forced to use a single one. Beautifully thought!

There isn't much free will, but Beth's tale is so ordinary, so real and everyday; I found no problem on emphasizing myself with the character. The game asks the same question that we ask ourselves everyday: Will I make it? Will it be okay? Am I taking the right decision? Is it foolish to chase a dream? We all are afraid if we do not abide by the rules of the society, and work on a course of 'guaranteed future', we could end up wasting our life after a dream that we shall miss in the end. We all are a 'Beth' when a new day begins.

This is a very short game that you should spare the time to take a look at. At the end, I promise you, you'll feel better about whatever your life may hold for you. I know I feel better, and every Beth is a hero.

The story has a good message despite being fairly predictable. Although, it does have trouble meshing gameplay and storytelling. It works with cutscenes in between puzzles for story and while the puzzles do act as symbolism, you could get the same effect by watching a playthrough. For example, the protagonist is confused while trying to figure out her problems, so the games puts you into a maze with her inner monologue. Neat! But also could have been achieved if the game was a short film. There [b]is[/b] one moment at the end where it makes good use of mechanics for the purpose of storytelling, otherwise it's not too impressive with it's storytelling.  

The actual story itself isn't very remarkable either, although, It does set the scene for the puzzles nicely. In fact the story does little more than provide a scene for these puzzles to exist. That said, the best part of the game is probably going around and enjoying the environment as you play. Yes, even though it's a tile based game it still looks pretty good. It's impressive considering the game also does this with mostly default RPGmaker assets. That said, the puzzles themselves are pretty fun, interesting, and generally feel good.

That brings us to voice acting and let me tell you, WOW, [b][i]I hated it[/i][/b]. I forgot that the game supports autosaving so I stuck with it simply because I felt I got too far to just restart. Still, I feel the mood would have been way better in silence. Even if you got better actors, better direction, or better writing, the absence of voice would make the words more powerful. It also helps that the players can insert their own voice as well. The only problem with this is that it may be hard to tell who's speaking in certain parts of the game (The maze part switches between speakers).

Overall, it's a pleasant experience. The game's lackluster features are easily forgiven since it's fairly short and for 2$ it's worth the price of admission. Plus, you're probably going to get it for a dollar during a sale sometime eventually. At worst, you'll probably just find it OK.",1436977854,1436978097,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Nice and cute artwork for both cutscenes and in-game 2d sprites.

CONS:
- Game length is short (but you really can't complain at the current price.)
- The game only supports 640x480 resolution and there is no fullscreen option either (though the dev is planning to add fullscreen option in the future.)

Final Remarks:
The game was short but impactful. In spite of its length, character development of the protagonist was really well-done as I was able to emotionally relate to her deeply. The important and positive message that the game conveys is worth a lot more than just watching typical Hollywood flicks in my opinion.

1)	The gameplay is not build as much around exploring. The main gameplay consists of puzzles in the form of mazes with growing difficulty. 

2)	It is much shorter. Labyrinthine dreams can be described as one shot that focusses on a simple but moving and quite deep story that lasts for about an hour.

You play as a woman name Beth who must accept the decisions she made though life while dealing with death. Everything is done through a series of thoughts and dreams. To progress through this powerful and emotional story you must clear different mazes and puzzles that are themed during her life. This is not as easy as it sounds as some puzzles have limited turns, properly clearing all tiles, logic puzzles or even avoiding demons. 

The graphics is very colorful and the art is simply outstanding. You have different areas like forests, cities, skys and even dark evil zones. With these areas you have hand drawn art that must be seen to believe. With such great art you have some very unique and often eerie music that complement the story's different moments perfectly. Another treat for players is that this game has fantastic voice acting!

　本作はプレイヤーに物語を体験させることを至上命題とし、不必要な要素は徹底的に削ぎ落として作られた、そんなゲームです。
　物語は主人公Bethの過去からスタートし、彼女が自由を制限されながら目的地を目指し、強力な悪意に囚われそうになるのを何とか誤魔化し、ルールに迷いながら進みます。これはストーリーラインではなくゲームプレイの概要で、これら全てが物語と強く結びついています。すなわちプレイヤーは彼女の物語をプレイしており、知らず知らずのうちに彼女の物語を仮想的に生きることになります。この体験は非常に強烈で、終盤はあまりの悲痛さで本当に胸が苦しくなるほどでした。
　物語が感動的なゲームは数多くありますが、ここまで強く突き動かされたのは本作が初めてです。
　
　Labyrinthine Dreamsの物語は等身大で悲痛な、しかし特別に独創的なところはない、ごくありふれたものではあります。これはゲーム以外のジャンルでは、ひとつの作品として成立させるのが難しいのではないかと思います。もちろんつまらないとか質が悪いということではなく、例えば映画ならば極めて高いレベルの演出や役者、シナリオやカメラワークが、小説ならば批評家と読者に待ち望まれ続ける洗練された筆致が要求される、ということです。
　ゲームで物語が主軸というと（あまり好意的でない含意のある言葉ですが）電脳紙芝居のようなジャンルがありますが、本作がそういった形態を採らなかったのは、以上のような理由によってのことではないでしょうか。制作チームのうちの誰かにとって、何としても他者に経験してほしい、大事な物語だったのかもしれません。

　本作には強力な敵をなぎ倒したり障害物を盛大に破壊したり、といった要素は一切ありません。ですが、世に発表される「物語」のフレームワークが、ゲームによって少しずつ変わりつつある、そんなことも実体験させてくれるとても稀有なゲームです。

　ゲーム内の英語もさほど難しくありませんでした。わからない単語について辞書をひくことを骨惜しみしなければ難解な点はありませんし、テキスト量もそれほど多くありません。",1412246565,1412246565,True,31,5,0.7293129563331604,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-However, this game is not repetetive; you will most likely just play it one time (Unless you didn't quite understand the story). 

-The voice acting was okay, i don't feel like too much emotion was put on the most drastic dialouges; felt like the same tone.

-Art is great! The images fully went on with the story and were just so full with tranquility.

-Music was right on! Perfect melody at the right spots! Though, the enemy's theme was somewhat spooky lol. I literally just wanted to clear the puzzle as soon as possible when i had to escape.

-Puzzles tend to be rather quite easy once you have figure out the kind of pattern that is being used in specific puzzles, there is only one way to the exit, can't take any other road but the one assigned for you.


I really wanted to know more about her, but it seemed that the only way was by completing puzzles and getting the dialouges , if you interact with objects though she will tell you something about the past.

What elevates this above a simple grid puzzler is the fact all the puzzles are actually a part of the story: it makes sense for them to be there, and they are not just thrown in to pass time between the short cutscenes. Cutscenes which are done in an anime style with fully voiced dialogue.

Roughly said there are four types of puzzles in this game, all with their unique move sets and rules. Each ""level"" is beautifully rendered, and has a score fitting the scene.

The game's soundtrack is simple yet beautiful, and the  voiced parts are done by  good voice actors. 
All the dialog is subtitled as well and the voice can be skipped, not that I felt the need to do so even once.

The big minus point is that this is an RPGMaker game, and therefore suffers from the engine limitations.
The game has absolutely no resolution control: you either have to play fullscreen, or in a tiny window, and then use something like Windows' Magnifier to blow up the window.
The game can also be very short. Once you learn the trick behind the puzzles you can probably beat it in no time.

For an RPG Maker game, Labyrinthine Dreams is incredibly beautiful. On top of uniquely crafted environments, Labyrinthine Dreams features several RPG style cutscenes, with fully voiced lines, which gradually unveil how the protagonist came to enter this between-worlds state. 

The story is very human and touching, though I can't say much more without spoiling it.

Now as for the gameplay itsself, I quite enjoyed nearly every second of the tile-movement puzzles, and though, admittedly, I rarely play games from this genre, I had never experienced most of the puzzle mechanics which constitute the majority of Labyrinthine Dreams's play time. Some of the puzzles are quite tricky, but I strongly encourage you to figure each of them out on your own, as all are quite do-able. 

Hopefully that made some coherent sense. But anyway, I do strongly urge you to buy this game. For $2.99 (or even the full $4.99) it's well worth your money.",1401162653,1401162653,True,21,1,0.678390622138977051,0,False,False,False,False,,,
