Bird of Light has a very mobile games look to it when you look at the game play videos, and that’s because it was originally going to be a mobile game, but they released it on PC first because apparently the PC gaming market is much friendlier and easier to find a publisher than the mobile gaming market. Despite this, it actually fits the PC gaming world better, through keyboard or controller, because it does get more complex with the controls and gameplay as you progress. The graphics are simple and cute. I got a little giggle at the animals, especially the shape of the cows and how cute the little piggies were. The art and graphics are spot on; they’re cheerful, cute, and allow you to enjoy the game and not take focus away from what you are trying to do. The goal of the game is simple enough: you play a little girl whose family just moved to a farm, you are running around and have to find the key and get to the castle at the end of each level. Don’t let that fool you though, it does get trickier and more complex the deeper you go into the game. You have to work your way through a maze of paths, while dodging and leaping over the farm animals and other obstacles, while also collecting the coins and eggs. Coins can be used between levels to find out where the level key is on the map and even the eggs. The eggs? Those are to be collected for the bird that guides you through the tutorial. They’re not needed to finish levels, BUT they do add an extra bit of complexity to the game, making it a bit more challenging if you do want to try to collect them and get achievements. The eggs unlock achievements within the game. You can also get achievements for speed running levels or completing levels without using the checkpoints. The further you progress into the game, the more obstacles and tricks they throw your way! Seriously, head on over to the developer’s site and read the “Dev Diary”... things sound like they a bit more hairy deeper into the game! I am only at level 6 or 7 so far. I will be coming back to the game from time to time, trying to get further. Not sure if I will ever get any of those speedrun achievements though! Which is okay, because I would rather just sit and enjoy a casual play through than frustrate myself trying to speedrun a level while dodging and jumping over animals and other things. A great game for just casual gaming but also has that added perk for those that like to get achievements for speed runs and other things.

Bird of Light is a cute little puzzle-platformer of an indie game that released a week ago onto Steam for PC. The game features Steam Achievements and is currently only available for PC on Steam; it supports keyboard and controller. Created by the small team of Roach Interactive, this game was born out of an idea that slowly grew but finally started to fruition when the lead designer’s own daughter is born. You see, Rahul Sehgal, founder and lead of the Roach Interactive team, is from India, a place where violence towards women is sadly “just a part of life”. Thanks to the internet and many proactive groups in recent years, including the women themselves standing up and fighting back, things are starting to change, but only slowly… and only in some areas. Other areas, the violence sadly occurs daily. Rahul wanted to make a game that was fun but without the violence so common in his home country and in a lot of video games nowadays. He wanted to make a game where the lead was not only female, but one that was not overly sexualized. He stood firm on these two ideals and it has paid off. When the game was finished and his team was trying to find a publisher, many turned him down or he turned them down, because they wanted a male lead or asked he change it so the player could decide on the gender of their character. If he’d given in, it would have destroyed the soul of this game, of his baby, because part of what gave birth to this game WAS the idea of having a NORMAL female lead. I admire the man and team for sticking to their guns.

The story the game tries to tell is interesting and, by going to the steam page and looking at the description for the game, you can tell that the developers had an idea of what this game could be going into it.

Herein lies one of the many problems with Bird of Light.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFR_y0v1oHk

The game itself is an endless runner-style, speed run-encouraged game with maze-like elements. Each story moment is told by a pause and a cut scene where you press a button to go through the dialogue of these incredibly atrocious looking animals. These poor things look like they’re waiting for death to take them, or that they’ve seen some serious trouble in their life.  It tries to convey a story, but it doesn’t. Not only because of how they chose to make this story come across graphics-wise and gameplay-wise, but also because of this line they say:

“The gameplay is an abstract representation of Tara's search for The Truth.”

It isn’t portrayed by these scenes between the animals or between Tara. It also isn’t touched on in the gameplay, because by this strain of logic, being in a maze, finding the key and finding the exit, means that the mazes on the back of cereal boxes are also an abstract representation of a search for the truth.

[url=http://game-wisdom.com/podcast/roach-interactive-mobile-games]When I spoke to designer Rahul Sehgal about it,[/url] the game was originally pitched as a mobile game. He ran into trouble with finding publishers willing to let him create the game he wanted. In response, he moved the game over to PC and Steam to finish the game that will now eventually be ported back to mobile at some point. Despite the problems during development, Bird of Light shows a lot of smart design decisions for a very unique game.


[b]To the Country:[/b]

The story of Bird of Light may be a bit confusing. Told by static cutscenes, the game's heroine Tara moved to the country with her family. After befriending the animals, she finds one day that they are disappearing. To find them, she must seek out the bird of light and explore abstract dreams to discover the truth.

For an unusual story, Bird of Light has unique gameplay to match. Each level takes place on floating islands set up in grid formation. You have a set number of platforms that you can set up in any empty field. To beat a level, you must get the key and make it to the floating castle.

Tara is always moving forward and you can control her direction, position on the track and can jump over obstacles. Running into something or falling off will force you to restart either at the beginning or at a checkpoint.

The game is less about action and more about figuring out the best run through the level. There are global leaderboards set up to view the fastest times (and your friends eventually).

While the game is easy for players just wanting to get through it (and there are advanced mechanics later in), Bird of Light features some great use of achievements and progression to make you want to try harder.

[b]Earning a Medal:[/b]

Each level has three different types of medals to earn that are based on skill at the game. You get one medal for finding all the eggs, one medal for beating the par time, and one for finding all the eggs, beating a time and not having to use a checkpoint.

The levels were designed explicitly to challenge the players who go for the medals. You'll have to both be quick with controlling Tara and figuring out the best setups in order to go for gold. Getting medals is the only way to unlock achievements in the game.

This was a smart move and is a great use of subjective difficulty and how the game is only as hard as you make it. Getting through the levels with just the key is very easy; getting through the levels and earning the mastery badge is a different story.

Tracking the best players is also a great way to test yourself further and be amazed at the times people are putting out.

My only issue with Bird of Light has to do with its mobile background and how it slightly feels like it's caught between two masters.

[b]Stretched:[/b]

Bird of Light was originally designed for mobile interfaces and it shows. The controls feel all over the place for either the keyboard or gamepad. For example, the hop commands could have been tied to one button that just alternates, as it's really a black or white mechanic. While it felt more natural to use the gamepad for moving, the keyboard and mouse was better for moving pieces before each level.

Even then, the game never reached a point of feeling natural to me regardless of the control scheme I had. The game felt just on the edge of being button heavy when trying to play it with the keyboard.

Because Tara is always moving, I had some timing issues with quickly making jumps or changing my direction at crossroads. One last bit of mobile design would have to be the token system. Tokens can be found on each level that can be spent to permanently show the locations of all the eggs and the key on a map by map basis. I have a feeling that this was a leftover from the original mobile design or IAP feature. While it doesn't get in the way and can be ignored, I would have liked them to be better integrated into the experience.

Maybe have another medal or leaderboard for collecting them alone or with the eggs under a specific time; something to give them a reason for expert players to go after them. Another thing I felt that the tokens could have been used for would be revealing the obstacles on the map. It's hard to gauge perspective sometimes when you're always moving in terms of where obstacles are.

The problem is that the same obstacles are used for any variations of blocking the path, so a sheep could block the left, right or middle of the road. This makes it hard to quickly spot safe areas and the map doesn't help you out on this regard.

The last problem is more of a nitpick, but Bird of Light is on the short side for players who want to blaze through it. I think this would be the perfect kind of gameplay for a level editor feature if Rahul is ever able to integrate it.

[b]Shining:[/b]

As Roach Interactive's first PC game, Bird of Light is a great puzzle experience. From our cast, this was definitely a unique concept and I'm glad to see that he was able to get it out the way that he wanted it. For fans of all skill levels, it's a delightful game if you're looking for a casual or challenging experience.

Overall this is a must play.....it is a fresh and unique experience...",1468843975,1468843975,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It'd be nicer if they can talk better English, but since they're animals...
Yeaaah, they're doing fine. xD

-Great Storyline, reminds me of Harvest Moon
It's a about a young girl escaping the city to an imaginary farm in the sky. Complete with talking animals.

-Challenging gameplay
(Temple run + Maze runner - Evil things) * colorful and child-friendly characters = Bird Of Light
It may seem simple, but It's really challenging.

-Really Cute Graphics
Perfect for 6-10 Year olds
And for people who are young at heart.

-Cheerful Soundtrack
The soundtrack sounds happy and cheerful, I'd give this game 8/10.

I'd recommend gifting this game to kids 6-10 year old.
Challenging, fun and better than killing zombies. Really. Worth it's price if you're a kid at heart.
Honestly, give this game to anyone with a heart and they'll appreciate it.

I'm 17 and yet I am still enjoying this game.
Great job Devs!",1468803632,1468803632,True,4,0,0.52068638801574707,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It is one difficult game to master but that makes it equally satisfying when you complete a level. Loved the visuals. The game gives you enough freedom to set your own path instead of forcing the player to play in a certain way. 

Negative : Could have been more lenient with collision with objects. Even slight touch with an object would stop my run. 

Will write a final verdict once I've finished the game.",1468769131,1468772136,True,2,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,
