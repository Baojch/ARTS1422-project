La idea de controlar un villano que rapta princesas es sin duda algo muy interesante. Las princesas (y el príncipe) tienen su carisma, sobretodo Mayapple, que no llega a ser del todo una deconstrucción de Peach en plan Fiona de Shrek, pero tiene sus pros que la hacen un muy buen personaje. La idea de controlar los bosses en ves de al héroe es un concepto divertido, Crow, el malo, tiene su carisma y habilidades POTENCIALMENTE interesantes... Pero joder con los fallos del juego.
Lamentablemente este juego se siente muy amateur, algo que no debería considerarse producto final. Si, está completo, es jugable y no tiene bugs que rompan la partida... Pero tampoco es algo que merezca uno decir ""buen trabajo"".
La mecánica de atacar/disparar en base al puntero del mouse se me hace innecesaria e incómoda, con lo fácil y disfrutable que sería un control estándar de teclas, porque... ¿A QUIEN SE LE OCURRE QUE ES BUENA IDEA UN CONTROL CON PUNTERO EN UN PLATAFORMERO? Por no mencionar lo inútil que es la mayor parte del tiempo, en el final malo tiene su utilidad... Pero joder que es algo super incómodo de controlar.
Las físicas del personaje dejan que desear, Crow es un tanto lento en movimientos y el tema de rebotar con granadas es un maldito desastre, a veces no hay colisión y dependiendo de donde rebotes te puede mandar para cualquier lado.
El aspecto gráfico está un poco descuidado, algunos sprites in game dejan mucho que desear en contraposición a los diseños que muestran en sus cajas de diálogos. Por supuesto que no se espera la misma calidad... Pero por dios que algunos diseños como el Sonic abeja, Mayapple, Mack y por supuesto el vikingo entre otros se ven horribles.
Explayandome en eso, los escenarios se sienten muy vacíos y carentes de contenido, con un diseño muy pero muy básico y otro que depende del rebote de granadas (Y es un completo dolor en los huevos). Algunos niveles son decentes, como el del tren, pero hasta ahí.
En general los controles y el diseño se sienten como de juego flash y no de uno memorable. La música es un 50/50, y el aspecto amateur se deja más en claro cuando no saben hacer un bucle decente de música, notándose el corte de la misma en niveles.
Hablando de amateur, las transiciones son demasiado malas, las implementaciones de textos se vuelven tediosas cuando regresas a un nivel y volvemos a la historia en lugar de jugar el nivel normalmente ya que eso ya pasó. Al principio hay un uso decente de los recursos del juegos para presentar cutscenes, pero ese aspecto se va perdiendo en gran parte del juego.
Puedo entender que este sea un juego pequeño e indie (Y creo que financiado por Kickstarter si mal no se), pero no.... Una buena idea y un potencial juego que podría atraer la gente se ve muy limitado con estas falencias.
En si, no recomiendo de todo el juego, tiene cosas positivas pero se ven opacadas por una programación primeriza y básica, un diseño de nivel pobre y un estilo artístico inconsistente. Espero que el creador, de tener una segunda oportunidad, pueda aplicar todo lo bueno y más en un remake, la idea no es mala y este juego tiene sus virtudes, pero requiere un mejor trato en manos profesionales.",1688773320,1688773320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Puede que esto suene muy cliche de videojuego antiguo pero lo cierto es que el juego lo hace a proposito, es consciente ya que el mismo es una parodia/referencia a varios videojuegos retro, con cada reino con su respectivo villano y heroe, dialogos que hacen referencias a la logica de los mismos, etc.
El gameplay es bastante sencillo, si buscas un reto pues lamento informarte que aquí no lo encontraras ya que no evoluciona mas aya de ""Saltar, lanzar bombas ya sea para atacar o rebotar como si fueras Junkrat de Overwatch y dar puñetazos"", mas si le sumamos el hecho de que el dinero que ganes en los niveles podras invertirlo en mejoras para el protagonista. Pero eso si, te encontraras con varios personajes carismaticos, y si bien su historia tambien es sencilla, sabe sacarle provecho del contexto y los personajes que tiene, ademas de que tiene su lado un tanto oscuro que le da seriedad al asunto.
Dependiendo de la princesa que capturemos, esta nos otorgara un power-up en su nivel para lograr superarlo, ya sea un salto mas alto o munición infinita.
Las batallas de jefe son inversas, con esto me refiero a que nosotros tomaremos el rol de jefe al final de varios niveles, cosa que tiene sentido ya que nosotros somos el villano, y si bien suelen ser sencillas las batallas y llegas a sentirte poderoso pues esa es la gracia.
El juego posee 2 finales, el cual dependera de unas decisiones que tomes en momentos concretos, no es algo de que preocuparse ya que si tomaste X decisión en X nivel, podras volver a jugar hasta llegar al punto de tomar esa decisión.


Como puntos negativos podria decir que:
-Al juego le faltan mas efectos de sonido ya que, por ejemplo, hay un momento de la primera misión en la cual estaremos siendo perseguidos por la policia, pero a pesar de esto, no hay sonidos que nos demuestre el caos que esta ocasionando nuestro personaje, esto es algo que sucedera frecuentemente pero bueno, al menos el soundtrack, el cual cabe aclarar que esta bien logrado, logra hacer de esos momentos algo mas epico o alocado.
-Su duración, ya que en una tarde libre te lo podras pasar sin problema con ambos finales, yo se que la calidad no esta definida por la duración del producto, pero es que con este mundo el cual posee muchas historias que contar (ya llegare a eso) es algo que puede llegar a decepcionar.
-El dibujado de los personajes, a ver, en mi caso no tengo problemas, pero aquí es cuando debo mencionar el webcomic, si, Nefarious posee un webcomic que funciona como secuela de uno de los finales del juego, dichos comics cuentan mas tramas con otros personajes, mas transfondo de su mundo como tambien de algunos personajes y posee dibujos de un muy buen estilo, sin duda Josh Hano (el creador de Nefarious) supo manejar de mejor modo el dibujo en el comic que en su videojuego.
-La falta de idiomas, en mi caso pude entenderlo bien, pero para aquellos que no lean el ingles pues se les puede dificultar a la hora de querer entender la historia o dialogos.

Datos extra:

-Josh Hano tiene un canal en Youtube con su mismo nombre, en dicho canal suele subir contenido de Nefarious, como por ejemplo 2 videos musicales los cuales son canon.
-Nefarious posee un sitio web en el cual podras leer su webcomic gratis, eso si, solo algunos tomos, si de verdad quieres apoyar a su creador y de paso, acceder a todos los tomos de su comic, puedes apoyarlo en su Patreon, no tiene perdida.

En conclusión, Nefarious no sera el GRAN VIDEOJUEGO DE PLATAFORMAS pero si es un juego que logra entretener y hacer reir gracias a sus dialogos, personajes y las referencias a otros videojuegos.

Story and characterization: 4/5

Without spoiling the game, you play as Crow who desire to kidnap certain characters for his own goal while fighting obstacles characters inspired by popular 2d 90s game characters. The game shine best when comes to characters interaction which takes place in hub place or levels. You do learn various characters situation and personality which can be funny, intriguing, character you want to root for, something that is sad, and WTF moment as well.
======
Gameplay: 3/5

Like megaman, you can customize your weaponry where one arm does punching ability which isn't that great to be honest where other arm can use 4 types of projectiles. The game does encourage you to use regular or sticky grenades to give you extra jumping boost to reach certain treasure chest (this is money), crowns, and vinyl records. Problem about this that you can't change weapons doing gameplay despite there are choices of using rockets and assault rifle which doesn't give you jumping boost. This would mean that you wouldn't use rockets or assault rifle until you finish the game. 

The game is generous to have saving point within the level and infinite lives. Since you are a super villain, you would interact with certain villains and get to use various machines on most levels. You can use 3 save files which can be convenient for those who are sharing the game. 

This game does something different compare to other 2d shooting games that I have ever played and that is using captives' passive ability to your advantage. Do note this passive ability isn't used often through out whole game which would have been neat idea if they did. 
======
Music: 2.5/5

Music is okay which nothing really standout but there are few very annoying music. Luckily this game does give you option change the volume of sound and music. 
======
Presentation: 4/5
I thought this game did good job for indie game where some are animated as well. Some characters needed to be updated for such as Mayapple does not look right when comparing her to other characters.

One problem though is the upgrades are kinda useless.  Theres 4 punches and 4 grenades you can get but the grenade upgrades a useless cause you need the default grenade to grenade jump, and some collectables can only be attained using these.  You can get sticky grenades for bomb jumping too, but the other two upgrades removes your ability to grenade jump so you'll always leave them unequipped even after buying em (unless you're replaying a level).  The explosive and ""Far reaching"" punch upgrades also dont feel like they do anything unless you specifically got the chargable punch, so ultimately the upgrades feel like they're just kind of tacked on.

The concept is charming, and there lots of neat details sprinkled throughout. 
The tone of the game and how the characters interact, as well as the fun mechanics and fresh ideas is some of what makes it so charming.
It's one of those, short and sweet games, with interesting characters and a compelling story that makes you want to play it all at once. 

…But, it does have some shortcomings. 
1.	The controls can be rather awkward at times, and the final boss of the 'good ending' is a pain to beat.
2.	Only a few of the dialog lines are voiced, even though I think the game could have been even better fully dubbed.

But, that being said, Nefarious is still an overall fun and charming experience, and though it has some shortcomings, it's still totally playable and a great game in my opinion.

tl;dr: I wouldn't take this over Undertale or Hollow Knight, but it's charming. It's got good story/writing, but be forewarned of the below, and if you think you're skilled enough at platformers, give it a try.

First, the bad, the in-game sprites look like they belong on Flash games(okay, that's more personal preference than anything, but whatevs). Some tiles clearly do not connect seamlessly to other tiles(obvious in the level mapping for the Japan-themed level). Movement has that acceleration thing where you start at a snail's pace, then get to normal speed after 3 or so seconds(very annoying for platformers). Levels are unpolished, there are some breakable blocks that are just there; they just lead to a dead end. The main projectile is an explosive that has travel time, and also gravity fall physics, which you're trying to use against flying enemies that constantly move around while you're also trying to move around and jump to dodge projectiles (hope you're clairvoyant; You can replace the grenades with bullets, but you lose the only mobility ability that you have). Mediocre voice acting for the few scenes that have them. Instant death environmental hazards(there are checkpoints, though). Title screen options menu is slow to navigate, and doesn't have audio options for some reason; you have to start the game, and go through an unskippable cutscene before you can lower the volume. Found it hard to play with controller, so I recommend mouse and keyboard, but the camera tracks where you're pointing the cursor, which is weird when you're also trying to aim at an enemy, and needs some getting used to. Story is slow to start. So much references to other games, the main character looking like a Megaman boss is fine since he's a villain and all, but the mario references are just there for being there and there's also a sonic expy??? and idk just a minor gripe. Navigating the level select is rather tedious because it always starts you at the first two levels, then you have to navigate to the second and third screen every time you want to progress the game. The final stage has an orange background, which makes it hard to tell where the red cursor is, making it even harder to aim. BUT! BUT, BUT!

The good:
[list]
    [*]Other art assets look good. Especially the character portraits(artist is Gashi-gashi I think). Character designs are an A+ for me.
    [*]Humor starts getting good after the first two levels.
    [*]Doesn't have that awful ice-level slide that other games have. Also, infinite retries I guess is a good thing that not all games have.
    [*]Each boss and princess has a different gimmick for the short while that you're on that section. I think the quantity over quality approach for interesting mechanics helps more than harms in this case, for a short indie game like this (game can be finished in an afternoon or so).
    [*]Tagline for the gameplay: it's interesting once you get the hang of it (hit or miss)
    [*]The writing is good. The characters are an especially strong point. I just love the story. Definitely the strong point for this game.

Гейплей. Платформинг. Но не надо кидать игру в мусорку,если не любите такой жанр. Она приносит механику,похожую на Rocket jump.

Пройдёмся по минусам и плюсам.
 
Минусы
1.Спорный lvl-дизайн. Он не лучший,спорный,местами он спорный,местами отличный,местами непонятная мразь. 
2.Игра пустая. Нет,не буквально. В ней есть что-то. Я про звуковое сопровождение. Что бы понять о чём я,надо выключить музыку. Вы услышите тишину...мёртвую. Вот пример-Первый уровень,босс. Густой авто трафик,город в огне,вертолёты,сирены. Отключите музыку...ничего. Пусто! Не подвезли звуков и это ужасно.
3.Проблемы со сложностью. 60% проходится на отъебись,или чуть сложнее. Лишь 2-4 уровня,где сложный платформинг.

Теперь по плюсам
1.История. Она нормальная,может зацепить,задумка интересная,просто норм кароч.
2.Персонажи. То,что держит эту игру на плаву-это калоритность персов,их взаимодействие друг с другом,местные шутки. Причина покупать игру по скидке или играть с торентов. 


Вывод.
Игра не лучшая,и заслуживает лишь 6/10. Увы,своих денег она не стоит. Я советую купить по скидке,или торент. В игре нету русского языка,вам будет сложно играть,если вы не шарите в английском на уровне училки. Кстати,я без памяти и забыл уточнить одну вещь.

1. Есть игра и комикс,события комикса происходят после игры. Важно знать. Есть русский перевод комикса,поищите,но он не полный,ибо отсутствующие главы только для патронов создателя.


По баллам-она тянет на 6/10,был бы лучший lvl-дизайн,фоновые звуки,ещё 3-4 часа гей плея,и игра тянула бы на 8/10.

Quick answer: don't

Long Answer:
when i played it i felt like i was playing an.. unfinished game. i haven't gotten all the achievements, i could try to get them, but i can't get myself to do it.
the idea alone for this game was very cool, heck, it was one of the most important reasons why i bought and played this. but no matter how cool an idea is, it has to work in practice. this game itself is just wasted potential i'm not saying that this game is pointless, it presented a great world of ""legalized"" hero vs villain fighting with tons and tons of potential. i've seen a kickstarter for the graphic novel (book) of this universe and read some free parts of it and it's not that bad. but this game could work way better if it had different gameplay. the biggest and best characteristic of this world(to me) is its base idea, so a platformer, that shows you more action and parkour and less story isn't gonna go far. if developers gave more personality to their characters, more drama between them, more reasons and motives of characters to do certain things (why are they a villain, what are they gonna do after getting world domination, what helps them with goning forward), if they had shown us the rules and rights of this world, i would be way more interested in it and would look forward to that graphic novel and (eventually) future games. Unfortunately, creators gave us a mediocre (at best) combat system and tried to turn it into the rock and fundaments on which the whole game would stand (you're the boss of the stage, you have those giant death robots and you're the one using dirty tricks) so the game turned out to be mediocre at its best too. you are also very limited when it comes to choices. there are like 2 situations which dictate whether you get a good ending or bad ending (both of which are kinda out of place/ don't feel like what an actual ending would feel like) and close to none romance options (saying certain things on a tv show and getting a different answer after returning on your ship) which is the worst thing to happen to an idea with that much potential. if you have a simple, but great, one-in-a-million idea, which represents itself mostly with morals, you are OBLIGATED to let the gamers decide their fate. 2 endings are not enough for this. with that much potential in your idea you should easily be able to create 4 or 5 different endings to this game. and yet there's only 2. those aren't great endings aswell.


===Spoilers===
 the *bad* one is when you have the world domination, which was the plan of the protagonist all along, and the good one is when you get a *""Magical change of heart""* and decide that this is bad and you shouldn't do it. result very different to Crow's (protagonist's) hopes and dreams to say the least.
===No More Spoilers===


so, if you still want to buy this game, it won't be one you will remember very gladly after you end it.
 
Nefarious? More like I'M FURIOUS THEY WASTED SO MUCH POTENTIAL THAT WAS STORED IN THIS BRILLIANT IDEA

I laughed out loud many times. Good plot twists and good writing all around.
Although our protagonist is a stereotypical cartoon villain, Nefarious has a fun story with genuinely charming characters. The story reminds me of Undertale in some ways which is high praise. The gameplay is also fun and I was surprised to find that it has a certain amount of hidden depth to it.
Nefarious leans on the fourth wall constantly.  The story successfully draws lots of humor from absurd situations involving video game cliches, cool fantasy kingdoms and lots of punching and blowing stuff up. There are also moments where it gets a bit too real for a cartoon (in a good way) and the characters voice well thought out ideas. The cartoon fantasy kingdoms have to deal with complex politics. Most of the characters have rounded personalities and plenty of moral grey areas. There's some weird, disturbing science fiction moments. There's emotional moments. The 2 endings thing is cliche but this game handles it well enough, and the ""true ending"" is a blast.
The gameplay takes from the oldschool platformers and adventure games Nefarious is a parody of, but it also feels modern with things like 360 degree aim. I'd call myself a veteran gamer at this point and I am happy to report that the difficulty is not too easy or too difficult. Death will happen but it's made much easier by frequent checkpoints and there is no ""lives"" system to hold you back. If you want to be a completionist you'll want to beat the levels without any deaths (and find some secret items) which raises the difficulty more than enough for those who want it. There are some fun techniques with bomb jumping and you'll have to learn lots of enemy patterns and not fall in pits.
I recall seeing reviews pointing out some mechanical flaws, particularly in the janky boss battles, but personally this part of the game doesn't bother me. Any time a game has a unique mechanic used for only a small portion of the game there is a risk of it being under-developed, but I thought the boss battles had just enough to them to still be entertaining (even if they aren't that hard) which is precisely the point. Being the boss battle is FUN. (I might be biased towards liking the bosses though, I'm a HUGE fan of physics engine gameplay).

Of course I have to reccommend this game. Short as far as gameplay hours, but it packs so much quality in to a short game that it is worth every penny.",1545107718,1545107718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I tried my absolute hardest to enjoy it. The concept was amazing, the characters were good. But the storyline? The length of the game? The gameplay? There's no nice way to put it, I'm sorry. But it absolutely sucked. 

The difficulty felt completely artificial. Whether it's swarming the screen with endless enemies, positioning enemies so that they constantly knock the player into instant death pits, the [i]OVERABUNDANT AMOUNT OF INSTANT DEATH PITS[/i], and the fact that the hitboxes for the enemies are extremely off. The machine gun can fire for multiple seconds straight through some enemies without harming them, as an example.

As for the boss fights, (the part of the game I was most excited for) they absolutely sucked. First off, the ranged weapons can down some of them in literally 3 seconds. And each boss fight, while it has a nice reference, has a major problem with it:

The first boss fight, where you pilot a vehicle similar to Eggman's wrecking ball, was the one I was the most excited for. And yet, it misses the point. The game was advertised as allowing the player to pilot these things against heroes. Except they gave all the heroes basic boss battle characteristics, making it feel less like playing as the villain and more just playing an unconventional boss battle. As for the fight itself, the hero can't shoot unless he builds up a pillar beneath him. And while you can hit him for a little tiny bit of damage, hitting the tower underneath him makes him fall down and stuns him for a long time. This mechanic seems odd. Hitting the tiny target on top deals chip damage, but hitting the massive tower underneath him once opens him up for attacks? Shouldn't it be the reverse?

The next boss is Dr. Mechano. Although, he's more of a midboss. He pilots a flying vehicle and you can only hit him by bouncing up the wall and punching him... At least, that was the idea. As usual, they forgot about the grenade launcher and machine gun. Since they didn't put invincibility frames after the enemy gets hit, you can just spray your gun and kill him in about 5 seconds. 

Next, let's talk about the giant mech fight against the viking hero. Once again, it sucks. The entire fight breaks down to ""punch randomly and occasionally hold left or right to dodge"". And it gives you SO MUCH TIME to dodge the attacks, making it a joke to win, except for one tiny thing. At least when I played it, it seemed to forget to tell the player you can hold left and right to dodge the attacks. As such, I was stuck trying to use the punch to dodge, until I accidently figured it out. Maybe it did show the left and right arrows and I missed it, but regardless, some labels as to what the buttons did would have helped. Terrible tutorial aside, the fight is just boring. Like I said above, you punch, punch, dodge an extremely telegraphed attack, punch

Continuing, we have the RPG boss fight. This one got me so excited when I saw it. Playing as the rpg villain? AW YEAH, LET'S DO THIS!... Until I realized you have only 2 attacks and each hero only has 1 attack. Basically just grenade launcher twice, then orbital cannon whoever doesn't get healed. I don't even want to talk anymore about that fight, it just makes me upset about it's wasted potential

Next, we have the fight against basically the Mechazord. Although, you're not in a giant robot yourself, instead being in your normal state. You know what that means! The grenade launcher or machine gun downs it in about 5 seconds!

Following that, we have a mecha godzilla suit against Mack! No way they could make THIS suck, right? WRONG! Mack only moves up and down at the same rate for the entire fight, and fires very slow shots. You can't actually shoot on demand, instead you fire after blocking about 3-4 shots. The problem with this is, if an enemy is moving up and down with no deviation in speed or turning point, you can just follow his position with the arm and block every single shot. Boring AF

The next few fights are just repeats of previous boss fights, no need to say anything here other than that they still suck

Now, we're getting to the end. Spoiler alert ahead!








Still here? Alright then. 
You pilot the Doom Howitzer against Hyper Mack, and... Well, you already know what I think of it. It SUCKS. Although I like the idea of having your character have 3 phases, it's pointless. You can't die or kill Mack in form 1 or 2, so the fight only starts at form 3. When it does start, you have full movement, tons of health, and a laser that downs mack very quickly. I would like to mention, while this happens you're getting attacked by hordes of mini-bots that seemed pointless at the time. The fight itself is kind of bland. Mack dies easily, it's nigh impossible to be hit if you keep moving, and touching Mack with the ship damages him.

Now for the true ending boss fight. THIS is the one thing about the game I didn't completely hate. You fight AGAINST the boss you were controlling in the normal ending. And the tiny robots from before? They're used as projectiles against the boss in the true ending fight. I did really like that little touch. 

As for the true ending itself, THAT was the one thing about the game I liked. Normally in games where you control the villain, he conforms and becomes the hero. While Crow DID perform a heroic action, he stays as a villain. I really liked that break from the status quo.

Although, one problem. Can a good ending save a bad story? My stance is unfortunately no. Although, I'm not here just to mindlessly complain. This was a kickstarter game, and it's obvious they tried their absolute hardest to make this good. So, I'll leave here some suggestions I have that I personally think could make the game better. If the devs want to include any of them, that's fine. If they don't care and like the game the way it is, that's fine too. After all, it's their game, if they enjoy it more this way then I'm in no position to judge them.

First, the boss fights need more variety. In traditional boss fights, the player (controlling the hero) and the boss itself have a wide array of attacks and weapons to use. Having both the boss and the hero have what boils down to only one attack is a major problem with the game. Also, maybe patch the issue with the gun hitbox and the ability to down bosses in 5 seconds with the gun

Second, focus a bit more on enemy placement. While having flying enemies with homing attacks placed right by death pits will kill the player, that's just artificial difficulty. It's just not fair to place enemies so they pop up around the screen border and knock you into instant death pits. Btw, maybe tone down on the death pits. They're literally everywhere

Third, the final boss fight (non true ending) has no closure with Mack. He gets shot, and it cuts to The Doom Howitzer opening fire. I feel like there needs to be a scene with Mack actually talking inbetween him getting shot and that cutscene. The change felt so abrupt, and could really use that little bit of padding

Finally, I'd like to see an extended DLC story at some point or at least a DLC with more things to do. The game has so little content, and honestly isn't worth $15. It's barely worth $5

In conclusion, I don't think the devs were lazy. They tried their hardest to make this game what they wanted, but it's filled to the brim with problems! If they fixed the endless problems, I'd be more than willing to change my review. But at the moment, (as much as I really wanted to love this game) It's absolutely awful. 

Honestly wish I didn't give this game a chance to prove me wrong, since I can't even get a refund now. If you start playing the game, and don't like it, the rest of the game is even worse so don't try to give it a chance. Just get your refund and buy a better game.

There’s no going around it – the game’s horrible controls make it very annoying to play through. It’s generally easy enough that you can do most of the levels with only a few deaths, so it’s okay.

The levels aren't overly long, which keeps the story and game flowing along nicely. Even with completing the additional side-missions the game took me about 5 hours to complete. But I was having so much fun, it hardly felt like it. 

The protagonist and supporting characters get fleshed out pretty well, as you play through the story. You'll face off against various heroes and rival villains as well. Combating them in unique boss battles, where you control the mechs and robots that you would be fighting against in almost any other game in this genre. I also have to comment on the music, it's very energetic and keeps you engaged in the action. Each level has its own unique music track to listen to, which you can also listen to on board Crow's airship, which you can use to visit each level.

*UPDATE* Welp, now I've finished it, and I can now say that the concept is still good, and it's also witty as all helck, but it's pretty short, and thus not worth $14.99.

Only found out by mashing buttons during the start of the Heartless Abyss or whatever it's called.

[h1]Геймплей[/h1] Он может быть как интересным, так и нудным. Плохо только то, что практически все интересные места показали в трейлере, а о типичном нудном прохождении уровней нам упомянуть забыли. Да, геймплей я могу оценить как [u]неплохо[/u], но это общая его оценка. Как уже было сказано, геймплей в разных местах разный, и играешь ты только ради сюжетных и геймплейно-интересных мест. Но всё это как и полагается в старом 2D платформере приправлено нудятиной из долгих хождений по уровню. Я ничего не имею против этого клише, но на дворе был 2017 год! Можно было хоть как-то разбавить эту скукотищу. В итоге особого впечатления от игры в целом не остаётся, остаются в памяти только эти прекрасные коротковременные моменты.
[h1]Дизайн[/h1] Мягко говоря-не очень. Идеи дизайна для уровней и персонажей может быть и хороши, и в тему, и приятно глазам. Но реализация как всегда отстаёт. Убогий дизайн и рисовку персонажей можно понять только посмотрев на лицо ГГ и сравнив с портретом. Дизайн уровней такой же как и геймплей: нудный, неинтересный и кривой. А ведь могли неплохо так атмосферки и красоты подбавить за счёт него, ведь как уже говорилось, основная составляющая игры-уровни.
[h1]Сюжет[/h1] Я спойлерить не хочу, по этому особо о нём рассказывать не буду, могу только переписать описание игры из магазина стим. Но могу сказать, что это [u]сильная[/u] часть игры. Он действительно, в отличии от дизайна и геймплея, интересен, а самое главное ещё и [u]комичен[/u]. У каждого персонажа есть свой ярко выраженный характер, своя история и своя часть клиширования. Но почему клише является положительным аспектом игры? Потому что данное клише и создаёт ту самую комичность и яркость персонажей, и вследствии этого их черты характера очень хорошо раскрыты.
[h1]Саундтрек[/h1] Особенного ничего сказать не могу. [b]Чистый среднячок[/b]. Он не настолько крут или ярок, как например в Undertale, но он просто подходит под ситуации, и его можно слушать. В нём тоже есть своя степень клишированости, но это плюса ему не даёт.
[h1]Арты[/h1] Это единственное, над чем разработчики [spoiler]если их можно так назвать[/spoiler] решили постараться. Портреты персонажей выполнены на высшем уровне. Но это всё не придаёт игры завышенной оценочки, поэтому эта часть не так интересна. Я её упомянул просто потому что она [b]ВЫДЕЛЯЕТСЯ[/b] на фоне всего остального.
[b]Итог:[/b] Игра уж точно не стоит своих денег. Да, она стоит хоть каких-то денег ради сюжетки и просто классных моментов, поэтому если уж очень сильно хотите [strike]пофапать[/strike] посмотреть на арты персонажей или влиться в сюжет, то покупайте по скидке не меньше 50%. А так 350 рублей это не стоит.

Let start of with the villain protagonist concept. Yes, there are just a handful of games that is fully dedicated to this concept, and most of them follow a 'dark humor/satire' theme like Overlord. But this game went even past that, with its loyalty to traditional video game villain tropes and nudges to classic video game villains. 

Next, the very much endearing characters. From the ever witty and villainous criminal mastermind Crow, to the always loyal and surprisingly effective minions, I assure you that you'd end up loving most of the characters. The prince(sses) all have their own little personalities, your secretary is an endless source of good banter and professionally funny dialogue, and even the heroes are characters you'd just love and love to hate cause they're heroes! The only concern I actually have for characters is the lack of depth of the special minions since they seemed to have so much potential. 

Gameplay. I'll be honest, the gameplay was very annoying and hard to master. It seemed to require greater skill than non-rage 2-D sidescrollers but when you do get the hang of it, it became manageable. Though I must warn you, there will be sections that you will curse with your entire being. 

Finally, the actual story. It started simple, having a humorous context and a nice villainous scheme to execute. Then as the game progressed, you got to look more into the different characters, especially Crow and Mayapple, and see deeper than just their face-value personalities. The game gradually became more and more deep, but it still retained its happy ambiance which just highlighted its best qualities. Finally, when you reach the endings, the game hits you with very emotionally satisfying (atleast for me) scenarios, which will leave you with a smile (nefarious or otherwise) as the screen returns to the main menu. 

All in all, this game no doubtedly has endeared itself to me and most likely stay in my heart forever since it pushed all the right buttons for me. The only actual downside with this beautiful game is that it doesn't have a sequel. And now I'm sad.

Nefarious is a run-n-gun platformer that flips the script by putting the player into the role of Crow, an over-the-top megalomaniacal supervillain with a horde of henchman and an evil scheme brewing.  As villains are wont to do, most of the game is spent invading various kingdoms, kidnapping princesses, and causing general mayhem as Crow's overwrought master plan comes to fruition.  Gameplay-wise this amounts to about ten straightforward levels of punching guards, flinging grenades, and surpassing platforming challenges while collecting money to obtain better punches and grenades.  The end of some levels even puts the player in the role of the boss fight against the local hero.

The true strength of this game is in its premise and characters.  It's an interesting enough subversion to follow the villain's adventure rather than the hero's, and Nefarious takes it a step further by really looking into what the everyday life of a comedic cartoon villain is like.  All the different characters have vastly different opinions of Crow and his villainy: some write him off as a two-bit wannabe, some skeptically tolerate his antics, some are just along for the ride, and a few genuinely try to get him to see the error of his ways.  Crow himself is all-in with his villainous persona and hams it up so much that it's hard not to laugh, even when he's actually succeeding, or accidentally doing something nice.  Throughout the course of the game the story actually gets surprisingly contemplative, looking into the philosophy of good and evil, the ends justifying the means, and what a ""villain"" truly is.

As much as it hurts to say, the weakest part of the game is the game itself.  Level design is uninspired and feels rushed, especially the boss fights; what should be a magnificent feeling of finally being at the helm of a giant death machine against the puny hero is reduced to simplistic dodging minigames.  Aiming projectiles is a chore with a controller and not much better with a mouse, and this combined with floaty controls makes the frequent bomb-jumping and dispatching of flying enemies very annoying.  A mechanic is introduced where kidnapping princesses grants a temporary special ability, but this mechanic is severely underutilized, occurring only once per princess in the whole game, and cries out for better implementation.  The majority of the problems present in the game seem to be hallmarks of the ""Kickstarter Curse"", wherein the project creators simply don’t have enough time, money, or experience to polish up the game the way they envisioned at the start.  Fortunately, they DID have enough time to invest in both visuals and music, which are as beautiful as they are thematic.

Not every game can be the full package, and Nefarious is certainly lacking in gameplay substance, but it just as certainly makes up for it with a whole lot of style and creativity.  Those to whom content is a deal-breaker might find themselves disappointed in this game, but to the rest, a fun and storied experience awaits.",1517626398,1517626398,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In Nefarious you play as criminal mastermind/ serial kidnapper Crow as he attempts to kidnap all the world's princesses (and one prince). The game is dripping with satire and charm while placing you in a unique environment; the villian of a platformer game.

The gameplay is a typical sidescroller mold with collection elements so nothing new there. Once you capture the princess of the level however, you gain unique abilities from that princess (ex. A queen bee princess gives you a high jump, etc). 

This all culminates with the boss fights which flip the formula on its head; you are a villian in a platformer, i.e. you must do battle in the crazy mechs you see from this gerne and, let me tell you, I have new found respect for Eggman's Ball and Chain weapon! All of these are unique and fun to use, if a bit tough to learn at first.

tl;dr Nefarious is a unique little gem who places you in the shoes of a crazed evil mastermind on the quset to do what any good villian does; kidnap princesses.

*ahem* Then Nefarious is for you. A fun little platformer that's short, but sweet. Taking inspiration from games of the past with the traditional 'hero saves princess, handsom hero gives chase, quest ensues* format, you put yourself in their shoes. 

I'd nearly compare it to megaman in terms of both appearance and mechanics, but it lacks to 'weapon get' and has a number of different mechanics. You can run, jump, shoot grenades (or bullets, but you can grenade jump), and punch. I'd highly reccomend using a controller for this alongside the shoulder buttons, as using the face buttons while trying to aim can feel a little janky. Speaking of jank, while the game as a whole is fairly easy or smooth so long as you're compitant, the final level and some of the optional levels can be quite frustraiting, even if you're familiar with the mechanics, due to a combination of RNG in some wierd cases and...akward extra grenade jumping while dodging enemies that knock you back. There's also a few bugs still in place, such as falling through the ground in an ice level, through the entire stage and into death in a large purple..place beyond the normal realm of the game. Aside from that and an issue in a lab-based extra stage, the game as a whole seemed bug-free.

The music, while it reuses the main theme a LOT is fun and jazzy and 'bad', and the artwork (be it sprite work, backgrounds, or art by Gashi-Gashi) is awesome.

Overall, I'd say the game is worth $10 rather than $15, but I'm more than happy to pay a bit extra to support the devs. I'm glad to have playtested this at more than a few cons (and discovered more than my share of bugs that they readily fixed), and am glad to have played the game.

Basically outside of the ""Boss Fights"", it is your standard platformer. You can punch, fire grenades, andd occaisonally get a small little upgrade for a level thats lets you do things like jump higher or have you grenades leave a smoke trail in the air that lets you walk on it. But these upgrades are not around for very long which is unfortunate because they were kind of nice to have.

The boss fights are interesting and nostalgic but fairly simple and managed to go through the ones I got to fairly quickly.

But for a game with such simple controls it has a surprising challenge to it. Not because the levels are hard themselves persay but because the control scheme just isn't very well displayed or handled. There are these little pads that when your character is over them let you jump again. But the distance you get varies by how long you hold the button. I would normally like this but you can't really get an indication of if you did it long enough and most likely you insta die because you held it for to short.

Similarly I HATE the grenade launcher. So hard to tell whether or not it is charging up or not making it hard to hit the flying enemies leaving a really unsatisfying feeling.

The game is only hard because they made the controls awkward to use. I think the idea of playing the villan is cool, but the game just feels like a platformer with different style boss fights.

I tried playing it with a keyboard and with a controller and I absolutely thing a keyboard/mouse is better. Allows you to aim and gives more reliability to the direction of your punches and grenades.

Overall, it's an amazing game with some sizable issues, but those can be overlooked if you can manage to get past them. Definitely recommended.

The gameplay was very fun, excellent platforming challenges mixed with an entertaining form of combat that made me look forward to replaying levels with missed collectables rather than dreading it!

The music was amazing, fitting to every situation and every area and really hyping me up to play the game.

I also adore the fact that you can set the hub music to whatever track you like, so long as youve found the hidden collectable for it.

The story blew me away, it really made me enjoy myself as the villian, taking me through the other sided of the classic story of a captured princess, but with a fun spin!

I cant bring myself to spoil anything here even for the sake of the review, serously you jsut have to see it for yourself.

If i had to force myself to name a flaw, its the only one i found, nd its not een big. pretty much whenever i use the grenades sometimes it does a long shot, even without me holding the button which can hurt grenade jumps on the fly. Really not a huge issue as the areas you need grenade jumps are mostly optional, and few and far between. So Yeah thats seriously no reason to take away any points.

I used $10 to support the [url=https://www.patreon.com/JHano/posts]Patreon[/url], so that's why I checked the box that says I received it for free, 

There are some glitches, but I haven't encountered any that would hinder you in any way. On the contrary. In order to get a certain crown in a certain level you need to grenade jump across a certain lava pit. Normally it's very difficult, but you can also glitch through from above in order to get it, making it much easier. 

There are also two endings: The bad ending with an easy boss fight, and the good ending with the ridiculously difficult boss fight. Why is it difficult? Well, in order to damage the boss, you need to hit flying robots into the cockpit. However, it's the classic ""the final boss has three forms"" fight (which you take advantage of in the bad ending, as you are piloting the final boss). The first two forms are easy once you get the rhythm down, to the point where I ended up consistently only losing half a heart to the second form. However, it's the third and final form that sucks. It takes place in space, with both you and the final boss having full mobility. The way to take the boss down is the same across all three forms, but therein lies the problem: with both you and the boss flying about, everything is zoomed out, making it much, MUCH more difficult to hit anything, despite hundreds of drones available for you to hit at the boss. Your best bet is staying above and to the left of the boss while trying to knock drones onto the boss's head. 

Steam controller compatibility is top-notch, with one exception: the bad ending's boss fight. As you may know, the Steam controller has a trackpad. Now normally you aim and move with the joystick. But for SOME REASON, aiming is reserved for the trackpad for this fight, while the joystick is still for movement. Normally that would be fine, but whenever you try to aim, it keeps snapping back to it's original position instead of staying where you last pointed the cannon, which is what you fire during the bad ending boss fight. I ended up having to abandon the controller for a mouse during this section, which was way easier.

When I first time see this, I pretty much liked what I saw in trailer and decided to give a try and my first impression was that this kinda has voice acting in the game, but it is mostly just text.

So as you can see the design of the main character and some others are pretty much inspired from megaman and others and the art style is quite nice to look at, especially on Crow's character design (oh by the way, Crow is the main character)

As for the gameplay, it is good ol' platformer and you have to get to end of the stage for boss battle, but with one twist with battles, YOU are the boss of the stage and I was pretty much waiting for it to finally show other bosses how it's done for real.

Nefarious also has upgrades, but to be honest, you're mostly going to use just grenade launcher perhaps for entire game, only if you're trying to collect all stuff from stage.

Alright, let's just check all the Positives, neutrals and cons.

POSITIVES.

+ Interesting gameplay.
As I said and as you saw on trailer, you play as villain and as stage boss, than as another ordinary platformer where you just go there, beat the boss and save the world.

+ Artstyle
The artstyle is quite comical and perhaps even fitting for this kind of game, where you are as typical villain.

+ Story
I will say once again, I'm not good with story section, but this one has good one on comedy side, kinda reminds me Disgaea.

+ Music
As being villain, you need kickass theme... Or Jazzy one too.
I pretty much like Crows theme and some other theme as well, especially the final battle theme.

+ Being as villain
I don't think I need to explain why, but these kind of games are rare and I know you can be evil in other games like skyrim or other, but I mean being the absolute threat to the world, to be leader of  evil force, to be the villain in game.

NEUTRALS.

= Crow having a nose.
I dunno why I focusing on nose, maybe because, other doesn't have one or on main cover and mostly he doesn't have it and I kinda liked about his design, but it's a random thing that suddenly popped up and doesn't even matter on this.

= You need your first range weapon to get all collectibles.
I've used grenade launcher to get all crowns and vinyls, even if some part you don't even need it, but you still mostly use it.

= 12 hour gameplay.
If you do everything in the game, get all items and other levels, it is just 12 hour of gameplay or less if you're good at it, but it isn't that bad, it just depends your opinion how long gameplay it should be or so.

CONS.

- Less upgrades
You can almost get all upgrade on playing couples stage and getting all the credits that you can find.

- Jumping points almost ridicilous precision points
I don't know if you're struggling with these, those purples points that has bombs in it to make a jump, I had a great difficulties to manage those jumps, even with the controller, I still manage to fail to jump from them, because it feels like it is very precise on when you push the jump button.
Most of the times however, I manage to jump on them, but some reason certain parts just went for fail jump several times.
Still it might be just me or xbox one controller is derping around those parts.


Conclusion.
Nefarious is those rare villain games, which I want to see more, rather than those others where you can be ""villain"" if you want to, but is this game worth of your attention?
Well, it depends, but if you want my opinion, I say it is worth your attention, since after all, I am the mad scientist and an villain who just happens not having his own fortress... And minions... Or rival...

ANYWAY, that's all for now.

Of course that only out of 182 reviews so I'm pretty sure many people have never even heard of this game.  If you look on the internet, there really isn't a lot of praise for this game either (5.5/10 on destructoid)

This is not a good platformer.  The controls are very floaty.  You press a button and a second later your character punches.   
 There is no precision when you are shooting anything.  It's infuriating.  

There are fights where you are fighting waves of enemies for up to 10 minutes and you just wish you could move on because you're not having any fun.  There is simply no way to dodge the bullet storm they throw out at you.  The camera is also horrible as it zooms out so far, the characteers turn into the size of ants.  

I guess some of the appeal is that there are boss fights where you play the boss that are inspired by classic games.  Again, the camera pulls out so far that it loses any sort of feel for any of that.

I got this as part of my Indie Box subscription and it just shows me that not every game they pick is a winner.

A great twist on calssic 2D platformers, playing as the villain! The story is excellent and changeable (different endings) so you really feel immersed in the game. Playing with a controller can be difficult at times, and general control sensitivity can be rough. Difficulty spikes appear often, with one level being fairly simple and then the next being off the charts difficult.

gameplay starts out a litle nnnnnnnn but when you leanr to juggle yourself around with your grenades it gets really EEEEEEEEEEE

Although the game advertises the reverse boss fights more then anything else, I'd say they're probably the weakest parts of the game. Being generally sorta buggy and stiff. Fortunetly, they don't last long, letting you get back to the good parts of the game very quickly.

Overall, the game's a little rough around the edges in a few spots, but if you stick with it long enough (and remember to go for the good ending) it will do way, way, WAY, WAAAAY, more then enough to make up for it.

And one last thing:

If you're using a controller, you can use the right stick to aim without moving. You can also can use the left bumper to jump.

Однако если, скажем, Dungeon Keeper предлагал эту схему в декорациях фэнтезийного приключения в подземелье, а Evil Genius пародировал бондиану, то тут у нас имеется платформер и мир, живущий по законам Марио, Соника и прочей классики жанра.

Итак, наш персонаж - злодей Кроу, который очень гордится своим происхождением из потомственного рода злодеев. Он очень серьезно подходит к своим злодейским обязанностям: строительству гигантских роботов, похищению принцесс, сражению с героями и, конечно же, попыткам захватить мир! Однако, в один прекрасный день, когда он как обычно похитил принцессу Мэйэпл (явная отсылка к принцессе Пич), всегда останавливающий его до этого герой Мак просто взял... и отказался спасать принцессу. Он заявил, что Кроу не представляет реальной угрозы, эти спасения принцессы превратились в какую-то рутину, а Мэйэпл вообще чувствует себя в крепости Кроу как у себя дома и явно не испытывает особого дискомфорта по поводу своих похищений - так что Мак лучше займется чем-то полезным и разберется с настоящими преступниками, нежели будет участвовать в бессмысленном ритуале. И вот так злодей и принцесса остались без героя... Уязвленный до глубины души Кроу решает, раз уж такое дело, отправиться в другие королевства: похитить тамошних принцесс и одолеть тамошних героев.

Вот такая вот завязка. Гемплейно игра представляет из себя большей частью достаточно стандартную аркаду-платформер, сложную, но в умеренной степени. Однако, все же, есть некоторые необычные элементы, в основном вращающиеся вокруг двух моментов: а) того, что мы играем за злодея, а значит почти все битвы с боссом будут проходить в классической расстановке... только вот в роли босса будем выступать мы (то есть, на сей раз, это мы будем пилотировать гигантского робота или лазер смерти, в то время как противник будет пытаться разломать наш агрегат), а также б) Кроу все-таки путешествует между королевствами, а для здешнего мира это равносильно перескакиванию в чужие игры, из-за чего порой возникают вставки иных жанров, непривычных для нашего главзлодея (к примеру, с азиатской партией героев придется разбираться в пошаговой баталии a-la Final Fantasy). В целом, на самом деле, во время прохождения у меня не возникало ощущения однообразия игрового процесса - игра не то, чтобы постоянно переворачивала геймплей с ног на голову, но все же делала это достаточно часто. Причем, как уже можно было заметить по примерам выше, это зачастую обосновывалось сюжетно - ну или персонажи просто не упускали возможности подметить игровые моменты, кажущиеся им занимательными. Как такового пробивания четвертой стены в Nefarious, в общем-то, нет, однако сам Кроу, его приспешники, другие злодеи, похищаемые принцессы и защищающие их герои - почти все они всячески применяют свою, так сказать, жанровую подкованность, демонстрируя обширные знания канонов и штампов. И, в отличие от некоторых представителей подобных пародий, здесь это, так сказать, подсвечивание не надоедает. Здесь вообще мало что успевает надоесть, еще раз подмечу.

И все же большая часть обаяния сего творения держится на персонажах и сюжете - который, повторюсь, порой весьма тесно переплетен с игровым процессом, но это не единственное его достоинство. Конечно, идея рассказать историю от лица злодея не нова. Ну а тему ""что будет со злодеем, если останавливающий его герой самоустранится"" мы уже наблюдали, к примеру, в том же ""Мегамозге"" - но вот тут, кстати, эта мысль развита несколько иначе и с иными акцентами. Кроу, конечно, обожает разглагольствовать о том, какой он злобный злодей, читать пафосные речи о захвате мира, а также сеять хаос и разрушение... но, в то же время, он может быть весьма дружелюбен, миньоны и роботы обожают его за хорошее с ними обращение, а принцессы в большинстве своем воспринимают свои похищения как мелкое неудобство (а иногда - и как удачное стечение обстоятельств). В случае с Мэйэпл их динамика вообще полна отсылок к взаимоотношениям Пич и Баузера - с игрой в теннис, совместными походами в картинг и фактически положением Кроу, как ""друга семьи"", который периодически похищает принцессу по долгу злодейской роли. Вот только загвоздка в том, что Кроу никогда раньше не был так близок к фактической победе - ведь герой по канонам жанра всегда останавливает злодея... И вот теперь, когда статус кво полетело к чертям, у Кроу может появиться причина всерьез задуматься - а насколько далеко он реально хочет зайти, учитывая, что завоевать мир может быть не так уж и невозможно? Во множестве историй есть злодеи, которые никогда не добиваются успеха, динамика их взаимоотношений с героями начинает напоминать дружескую, а противостояние становится скорее забавным, нежели угрожающим. Таким персонажам аудитория нередко начинает сопереживать, и даже болеть за них... Вот только все же они остаются злодеями, и, когда у них появляется реальный шанс на победу, они начинают казаться далеко не такими забавными. Поначалу это может не бросаться в глаза, но, с развитием сюжета, это становится одной из основных тем Nefarious.

Как можно понять из вышесказанного, здесь есть некоторая доля драмы, моменты со сменой настроя на более серьезный и попросту случаи, когда сердце кровью обливается, но, все же, в первую очередь перед нами задорная комедийная пародия. Кроу откровенно наслаждается своими стереотипно-злодейскими выходками, да и остальные персонажи не отстают, обычно воспринимая все как веселое приключение. В истории предостаточно ярких действующих лиц и забавных ситуаций, в которые они попадают - шутки, в целом, достаточно хороши и порой весьма остроумны, атмосфера завлекает и наблюдать за этим сборищем злодеев, принцесс и героев откровенно весело.

Еще у этой игры совершенно шикарный саундтрек. Он, надо заметить, достаточно разнообразен - злодею предстоит посетить весьма различные по своей стилистике королевства, плюс, как я уже подмечал, игра порой довольно резко меняет свой настрой... В большинстве случаев, музыка весьма приятная, уместная и задающая настроение, к тому же мелодия порой может сама по себе быть отсылкой к жанровой классике. Единственное, следует подметить, что некоторые отдельные композиции хоть и хороши, но ужасно приставучи. После визита в псевдояпонское королевство Сукочи вы, вероятно, еще долго не сможете выкинуть из головы это ""Амефутте... амефутте... чикатамаааарууууу!"".

Переходя к недостаткам, самым основным в этой игре я бы назвал управление. В общем-то, сейчас уже всем прекрасно известно, что в хорошем платформере сложность должна создаваться за счет дизайна уровней и врагов, а не за счет того, что игрок не может толком контролировать своего персонажа. Последнее считается чем-то вроде моветона и создает ощущение издевательства над игроком, а не попытки создать некий челлендж. В данном конкретном случае управление... скажем так, не то, чтобы совсем ужасное, но далеко не идеальное. Грацией наш злодей явно не отличается, в то время как от нас зачастую требуется именно удивительно точное исполнение очередного прыжка. Справедливости ради, обычно вся хитровывернутая акробатика нужна для достижения особо вкусной добычи, запрятанной в каком-нибудь дальнем уголке, в то время как для прохождения самого уровня таких ухищрения, как правило, не требуется. И все же, некоторое ощущение несправедливости во время борьбы со здешним управление наблюдается. Помимо же управления... Ну, визуальный стиль Nefarious у кого-то может вызвать восторг, а кому-то совсем не понравиться - такие вещи обычно воспринимаются предельно субъективно. Собственно, пожалуй, к той же расхваливаемой мною музыке это также относится. Игра, в добавок ко всему, не очень продолжительна, но я бы не стал относить это к явным недостаткам, поскольку, как подмечалось выше, здесь, в целом, нет ощущения скудности контента. Хотя некоторые маячащие на горизонте темы все же не раскрыли так, как могли бы.",1497371893,1497371893,True,34,1,0.800324559211730957,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has great characters and a story that you can't help but get invested into. That being said there is one huge issue with this game:

THE CONTROLS ARE NO WHERE NEAR TIGHT AND RESPONSIVE ENOUGH
You are very slidy as a character and your close range attacks are a joke. If you are like me you will basically go through the whole level using your projectiles as you cannot get in close without running into the enemies. Most of the levels I can go through no problem. However, there are several moments in the game where i bang my head in frustration as I fall in pitholes or die from enemy attacks I simply was not able to avoid due to the slidy controls. It is like playing an ice level in mario. So why i am not waiting until after i beat the final boss to write the review? because the final boss is one of the most frustrating moments because it relies on precision attacks while avoiding a lazer, something the controls are not capable of doing. 

The game would get a strong review from me if were not for this, the levels are well made and very unique, but they are designed for tight controls, which makes completing them extreamily frustrating. 

So why do I still recomend the game? 

Mainly because I am a sucker for good story and characters. If you want a good story and experience and are willing to forgive the not so stellar controls, then this game is for you. If you don't care about the story and just want a solid platformer, then I would suggest to stay far away from this game.



EDIT: Wow, i never thought a single boss fight could change my whole review. However, the final boss unfortunatley has forced me to change my review to a negative one. I will try to not spoil it, it is a multi stage boss fight that requires precision attacks and you must do so all on the same life with no checkpoints. A game with tight controls can pull this off, no problem.....This game does not have tight controls. It is possible to beat it and many will boast they have one it in two to three tries. that being said, it is probably in my opinion one of the worst designed bosses in the game and really highlights the lack of understanding the designers had toward their game's controls. I have used a controller for the game and it feels awful. I really want to love it, I really do, but either the controls need to be tightened up or the final boss needs to be tweaked to make up for the slippery controls.",1497109955,1497110990,False,33,0,0.711415350437164307,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I got it by accident when I forgot to cancel my subscription to Indiebox and while I am having a lot of fun with it, it is also an incredibly unfinished game with awful menus and some awkward animation and sound glitches.

Pros:
-The art of the character portrait and some of the ones in game are great.
-The concept of reverse bosses is so cool.
-The characters are very charming and fun to meet. From Crow to the princesses.
-It has a pretty decent duration. I took me 6 hours to beat it with both endings without all the collectibles. It's not great but it's more than I can say for a lot of indies.
-The music is pretty neat.
-The gameplay is surprisingly fun, sometimes original too.

Cons:
-The game is painfully amateurish in its transitions and some of the storytelling.
-Some of the art looks like golden-age-newgrounds stuff. Sometimes the in-game art is not very representative of the character portraits.
-The animations are pretty cringey sometimes.
-The collisions sometimes screw up.
-The sounds are clearly stock royalty-free sounds, some of them don't match the rest of the game and it just sounds weird. 
-The audio sometimes screws up but I would blame that on Unity.

Conclusion: It's an alright game. Pretty fun at times and the characters and writing is pretty damn good. It's a shame most of the time the art is so bad and there are so many unpolished details with how it looks and feels.

While an enjoyable single player experience, it felt hollow at times to me.

*BEFORE I go any further, note this review will have spoilers. I want to dissect this game and why its problems stand out to me in full. So because of this, I wont have censor bars. If only because that would get annoying to see almost half or all of the review blanketed. Thank you.*

    First off, the music. Its not bad, but at times during a level, the music really didn't fit the mood of the situation. It feels awkward to me and the music can potentially get annoying hearing it on repeat. Some change in music would be nice sometimes.

    Gameplay is weird, and it is a MUST, I REPEAT MUST to have a controller, or you'll have trouble with this game. Its movement feels a bit sticky and slippery at the same time, as your character slides with what little momenteum he's got. This makes it troubling when in later levels you have to deal with instant death pits and surfaces. It is ESPECIALLY frustrating on the secret level, when you have to hop on small moving platforms to get to the next checkpoint. I just got frustrated at this game really. The punching is awkward as it sometimes, if not, always misses the enemies or doesn't push them back enough to not get hit. Making the ranged weapon a must use. And lobbing grinades is annoying enough as it is as you have no way of telling what the tragectory is unless you spam it, which is equally risky as your bombs can knock you around.
    Topping this with platforming and enemies that can fill the screen and/or attack through surfaces like walls, then you have frustrating gameplay. And this doesn't help when the true final boss is a little more fast paced than previous fights. And this current state of the gameplay isn't equipped for that if you top THAT with bad hit detection, which is very, very frequent. Weapons that should miss you by inches hit you anyways, and being on the hearts system, thats not a good recipe. I really dont like this gameplay on later levels as it really does break my interest in the game when I have to be focused on the dumbest things. Especially on bramble path, which, by the way, has the most infuriating platforming in a game with slippery/sticky controls while enemies flood you at every orface. This is not fun, this is annoying. A bunch of badly made mechanics are clumped together to create an annoying game that is realized later down the line.

    The one thing that kept me going, although, was the story and humor. The humor is gigglingly funny if only because the story lines up well with it. Being about a villian trying to break the status quo of ""Hero beats baddy, wins the day"". I like it then, but then the story goes into ""friendship solves all problems"", which was kind of a let down, but the humor was enough to make me ignore some of the stories downfalls. If you like funny and witty dialogue, come down here.

    The artstyle, let me be honest, is not that great. Its trying to go for a cartoony look but it just doesn't fit. I feel it should've had more flare to it or at least some interesting theme around it, but its just plain cartoony. In all honesty, I dont like it. It doesn't have to be pixelly or anything, but I would prefer it would be more interesting to look at if anything.  Mixing that with the music and it honestly feels bland after the seventh loop of the same song. Not that great in my personal opinion.

    The ""Reverse-Boss Fights"" are...really meh when you think about it. Really its just pressing some buttons, while doing one thing that dodges their attack. It could've been more dynamic or challenging, but it just didn't feel like so. The final boss on the normal route though, that was honestly good to play, if only because the challenge felt like it was there. The true final boss fight, again, was near impossible unless you had a stroke of luck. It practically requires a controller to play and even then good luck with the hit detection/hit boxes.


    Overall, not that great. It may have good humor and an interesting story, but its just held down from being what it is, a video game. Unless its on a damn good sale or you just want to see what its like for yourself, go ahead. Just be warned as the repetitive unchanging music mixed with a featureless artstyle, frustrating gameplay and somewhat disappointing outcome of the story can make for a boring experience that might as well have been time spent on something else.

While the whole game is nothing amazingly new there are some pretty cool things in here which make Nefarious a definite highlight in an already jam packed 2017.

The basic levels are pretty standard platform run and gunning type games. There is a pretty cool mechanic that halfway through each level you manage ti kidnap the princess you are hunting (for your princess powered doomsday device) and she alters the controls and gives you a brand new ability that alters the rest of the level.
I am surprised that you could not the go on to replay levels with the other princesses powers to access new areas but perhaps that was what the Metroidvania game this really should have been could have done to stand out from the crowd.

A real highlight fo the game, however, is the boss fights where instead of playing the sprightly hero you play the big hulking boss complete with big death rays and easily telegraphable attacks. Most of these fights are excellent and it really is something that makes the game stand out.
Visually the game is very pretty and some of the more artistic sections (particularly and underwater level) are damn right gorgeous to loo at.

The storyline is also very interesting and I was desperate to see where it was going to end up. I must say however the standard ending was very disappointing and I was left desperate to see the true ending which sadly didn’t massively improve the outcome.

The general gameplay is a mixed bag but mostly enjoyable and I really did have a great time with Nefarious in my 4hourish playthrough.

Nefarious is not perfect by any means but it is a very enjoyable game that I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a fun action platformer with a decent twist.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
Excellent character design and development
Brilliant music (Bonus Round for ten hours needs to be a thing)
Multiple endings!
Reverse boss fights! (YOU control the giant mecha and defeat the hero!)
Fantastically solid gameplay mechanics. I cannot overstate how good the grenades are!

Nefarious is a bit short but overall it's a fantastic little game that has unfortunately gone under the radar for most people. I've purposely avoided mentioning the story in this review but the main character sums it up best in the intro:
""Tell me if you've heard this one before....Bad guy crashes party. Kidnaps princess! Makes dramatic exit. But, funny story....Yea, I'm the bad guy!""

So after playing for well over 100 hours (Steam has not been able to track all the hours for various reasons) I can honestly say I know this game better than most, and the controls are precise (yet forgiving), boss fights can be a bit on the easy side, music is fantastic,level design works flawlessly with the controls, the characters really draw you in to a brilliant story and there are almost no bugs (believe me, I'd be happy for some!).

It has potential but it also has it's own share of problems.

Let's start with the positives,  One of the games biggest strengths is it's character interactions.  The game does have a lot of charm to it and I do like a lot of the characters that we do meet.  The artwork is alright with the character portraits being some of the best looking bits.  The music isn't too bad and I found myself wondering which track is my favorite because as soon as I thought I had one favorite track the next level would suprise me with an even better track.  It has a decent amount of stages with secret ones that show up once certain criteria are met.

However there are a few flaws that I would like to talk about.  
One of the biggest ones has to do with the music.  As nice as the songs are, they have a problem with not being able to loop seamlessly like you would see in practically every other game.  The songs have clear endpoints and start points so it's obvious when the track restarts.  Heck some of them even leave you with a few seconds of nothing before the music starts up again and it can be annoying especially on the longer stages.  Again the music isn't bad but I just wish they actually looped correctly.

The next point of contention has to be the boss battles.  They are somewhat varied as in the stages that do contain them have different fights so that the fight in one stage is not the same one you get in another.  One example would be the snow stage boss involves you in a giant robot while the lava stage boss fight is a turn based rpg battle.  However this variety comes at a cost.  No boss fight feels really complete.  They are all barebones and simplistic.  This would have been a great chance to get creative but it seems to be a wasted opportunity.  An example of this would be the snow stage.  It basically consists of you inside a giant robot with the only thing to attack with is your robo fists, by smashing them down on the hero running across the bottom of the screen.  You can see everything about the fight within the first several seconds becasue that's all the fight is.

However the biggest problem lies within the sovereign.  If you happen to leave the game and come back, you will be in your ship however all the princesses that have been kidnapped so far will have disappeared.  This will lead to a problem in three seperate occasions.  The first being that there is a part of the game where you need to talk to them for a quest and since they won't be there because you quite the game, you essentially become stuck until restart the stage because restarting the game won't fix your problem.  The other two times so far will cause you to miss cutscenes that happen when you try to select a level.  One of the cutscenes that can be missed will in fact lock you out of a secret level because the cutscene is needed to initiate the stage that unlocks the hidden stage.  It's a problem that I don't know how the developer missed it  through testing.

All said I would recommend the game because despite it's flaws it really isn't that bad.  It just needs more polish and for the boss fights to be fleshed out better and not be so barebones.

The concept of pitting the player as a boss type villain in a platformer is original, the world is colorful thanks to the artistic talent of Gashi-Gashi, the music is serviceable with a few catchy tunes you'll no doubt be humming to and the writing is charming due to the quirkiness of the many characters present in Nefarious. However, the one component that is holding the game far back is the gameplay itself. There's a great game underneath waiting to be released from the chains of its frustrating sluggish controls, the slippery platforming, the odd lacking of sound effects in game and the questionable placement of enemies in the game. The ""Boss"" Sections of the game while no doubt harking back to that of classic bosses felt underwhelming in execution with said sluggish controls and lack of sound effects bringing down the feel of being this destructive ""final boss"" and ruining the satisfication one would normally experience in other games as the hero beating said boss. 

This by no means is a horrible game but rather a game with unrealized potiential, a game that very much needs more polishing to fully realize its concept as being this platformer supervillain boss in a quirky colorful world. I would buy this game again in a heartbeat if these issues were addressed but for now it is not worth the $14.99 price tag.

Memes aside, Nefarious is a indie 2D platformer that was funded via kickstarter where you plays as Crow, the boss of a vilainous group, who kidnapp princess for a living and try to take over the world. The game is fully aware of the different tropes of the genre and fully play with it. Since you play as the bad guy, expect boss fight where YOU are in the giant mech.
While the game is good, it's far from perfection.

Graphically speaking, it's not very great. The differents backgrouds are nice and everything is well animated, but the rest is kinda meh (think of flash games you can find on newgrounds)

Gameplay wise, it's solid. Movement key, jump, punch, shoot and interact. Most level ask you to go and capture a princess, leave while using some power given by her then fight a good guy to end the level. Each boss fight is different and no level feel the same.  With the money you get during levels, you can upgrade Crow by expanding his life and grenade count or change how his punch and grenades works. The game is rather easy since there is a lots of checkpoints and death is only a nuisance (you lose some money, you can get it back if you go where you died).

The game isn't that long but each level has 3 crown to collect and a vinyl (used to listen to the OST between levels), each level taking from 5 min to 15. There is 2 endings and a bunch of difficult achievement.
Speaking of OST, some are great, some are meh, the only big downside is that the music doesn't loop properly, leaving a blank of 2-3 second before playing the intro again.

The story isn't that deep (which is expected for the genre but still with some surprising twist) but some of the characters are well written (saddly, most of them are meh or haven't enough interaction to have any real personnality).

The game cost 15€ but I'd recommand to wait 'till it's on sale before buying it. The dev' promised some bonus content in the futur even if they haven't met any stretch goals.

For example, the first boss fight sees you piloting a small spherical ship carrying a wrecking ball on a chain that you swing around to hit the attacking hero, which is essentially the first boss fight from Sonic the Hedgehog but with you as Eggman/Robotnik. Great idea, right?

The hero raises these towers from the ground that he'll stand on to shoot at you, and you can use the ball to knock them down. But when you knock them down, they just fall over. There's no particle effects, no screen shaking, there aren't even any [i]sound effects[/i] to go along with it. And when you hit the hero with the ball, it just plays a small ""whack"" sound effect and [i]the ball[/i] bounces off of [i]him[/i]. You'd expect that he'd get flung across the stage from the force of being hit, but no. He's not affected by being struck by the ball in the slightest, except that it makes him a little dizzy. The ball, however, bounces right off his head as if he's made of concrete. This makes it feel like the ball actually weighs [i]less[/i] than the hero does, and more like you're swinging around an oversized party balloon instead of a massive wrecking ball of solid metal.

This kinda stuff doesn't make the game BAD, but it really gives the whole experience a very ho-hum feeling because nothing you do seems to have any real impact. Any POWER! You're finally given access to all the rad weapons that every villain you've ever had to fight has used against you, and they just seem hollow and lackluster. Combine this with the fact that there's ZERO dialogue after beating any of the heroes (in stark contrast to practically every other interaction with them), and the end result is that these super cool and cleverly designed encounters just come across as unimpressive and gimmicky. Which is a real shame, because the actual gameplay is pretty fun and interesting, and you can tell that a lot of effort went into making them challenging while being faithful to the original boss fights they were inspired by AND also fun at the same time.

I [i]sincerely[/i] hope that this is something StarBlade can address by pushing out some updates to the game or something, because it wouldn't take a whole lot of work compared to what they've already done, and I have a feeling that it'd really improve the game's overall reception.

Revived from the ashes of every 16-bit action platformer ever, Crow is a princess-capturing evil genius who manages his first triumph when the resident hero of Macro City decides he’s tired of dealing with bi-weekly kidnapping attempts and skulks off. Stolen princess in hand, Crow returns to his floating sky fortress, which is resplendent with an army of minions and a collection of war machines, desperate to keep his streak going. With only another four more princess' in tow, he’ll finally be able to power his Doom Howitzer. Then, all of those pesky governments would be forced to bow to his demands!

Only… there’s something a little off with his tyranny. Though Princess Mayapple is undoubtedly his prisoner, she seems pretty relaxed about it, asking Crow’s minions about the well-being of their families and treating the sky fortress as a second home. It becomes clear quite quickly that she’s actually quite fond of Crow and his gang of crooks, hanging out with his assistant, Becky, and (to further her parodying of Princess Peach) reminding Crow of all the times she took him to tennis matches and kart races on their down time. Successful missions add further captives, who all socialise among themselves and lead to a dynamic I never really expected out of Nefarious. We’ve all seen the roguish villain turn out not to be the black-hearted cruelster he initially seems, but rarely has an evil-doer’s sinister persona been so expertly assaulted.

It’s hard not to take an instant liking to Crow, thanks to his pseudo-Mega Man get-up and his self-admitted addiction to villain tropes and clichés. All he wants to do, after all, is rule the world, which is something he inches closer and closer to doing as the game proceeds. Each stage he undertakes is a kingdom ruled by one of those princesses he needs, the completion of which leads to another member of royalty in chains, and another populace’s defence force smashed. Mayapple’s human kingdom is awash with rookie officers and police mechs, while a nearby Insect kingdom tries to defend their ruler with wasp knights and armoured beetles. They all maintain the familiar genre groundings of hidden collectibles and scattered currency to collect, but still offer differing environments to explore and overcome.

Let me just start by saying I love what this game set out to do. I've been wanting something like this since I first started gaming as a child. Sure there's plenty of games where you played a badguy, but never before have you felt like THE VILLAIN. Princess in tow, Hero on your heels, running a life of crime from a flying fortress. And Nefarious delivers. Its concept, design, idea, and even style is top notch. However the game is far from perfect.

Where Nefarious suffers a lot is in the gameplay standpoint. Now, its really hard to rate this because I've never felt this way about a game's gameplay before. How do I phrase this properly?
I love the gameplay, but I don't think it was perfected. The ideas are there, but it feels like there was some programming issues that were never looked at or resolved before release, possibly due to the size of the team. Jumping is floaty, and slippery, and can get stuck on things. The hit box for your punching sometimes doesn't add up. Being hit and hitting things doesn't feel right, everything just kind of rubs off eachother like two balloons. 
And the sound design. WOOF. Does someone need to get fired for the sound design. Music doesn't loop properly. Sound effects for things as basic as footsteps aren't consistent. The volume is all over the place, including a boss battle in particular that has a nearly Screamer level sound byte that made me jump the first time I heard it. I had to play the fight with my headphones off, and there was no way to adjust it.

Overall, despite my gripes, the love was there. The idea was there. It just felt like the project ended up bigger and more complicated than the team had planned for, and some unfortunate things had to be rushed or cut.

I would love to see this game get a sequel, where the gameplay is trimmed up, improved, and expanded upon, and the story is pulled to a much larger perspective. I would fund the shit out of that.

The writing is witty, entertaining and in serious moments it caught me off guard more than once. The story itself is a deconstruction of villain-centered tropes, but the characters and world manage to be colorful and imaginative enough that they're memorable in their own right.

Crow is a villain protagonist, and without spoiling anything, he manages to form real connections and have genuine development with the other characters without hitting the muck of anti-heroism. He's a villain 100%, and he does it because he loves it. It's as simple as that, without it being all that simple.

The Princesses are monarchs in all but name of their respective kingdoms; true videogame princesses. And even from the position of being kidnapped and stashed on Crow's ship like a trophy collection, they all have personal agency and an active role in the story. They all have interesting personalities and defining character moments.

The game manages to avert gameplay/story segregation. During gameplay it still felt like there was a story happening around me, and strictly story moments didn't lose the sense that I was playing a game.

Gameplay: 5/10

It lacks polish. The controls are sluggish and imprecise. I found myself relying more on Crow's ability to absorb damage than reflex or skill. His basic melee attack has a delay that feels like it belongs in a slower-paced, more methodical game, and his alt-weapons made every effort to not be overpowered and feel equally stifled.

Checkpoints are frequent and you don't have a finite number of lives. This helps, but it's still subpar as platformers go.

The reverse boss fights are fun the first time, but all consist of learning one tactic that works and repeating until the fight is won. Even the true final boss is like this; the fight itself is a technical mess, but it becomes easy once you learn the winning pattern.

Sound: 7/10

If this music was in anything other than a 2D platformer it'd be solid gold, but as it stands its pacing is too relaxed and doesn't click right in the brain.

The sound effects are solid and there's nothing to complain about. I wouldn't even bring them up if not for some instances of the soundwork standing out in a positive way, such as the regular steel groaning inside Crow's airship.

Visuals: 9/10

The characters are all hand-drawn down to the faceless redshirts you blow up and they look beautiful. Crow's heavier mech hand dangling behind him when he runs is a touch you don't see just anywhere. The different regions feel visually distinct.

Overall

This kind of game is to my taste, and I found it well worth the $15 wish I'd supported its Kickstarter. This game is a gem. A semi-cut, flawed gem, but a gem.",1486462376,1507220415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So I went ahead and bought it on launch day and played through the whole thing in one sitting, and felt... Marginally satisfied. Could have been better, but it's still quite good.

PROS
-Superb art and animation, it pops well and looks sufficiently cartoony for the theming.
-Excellent soundtrack, wonderfully catchy and atmospheric.
-Good design choices lifted from Shovel Knight (Infinite lives, pick up money after death, music pickups, etc).
-Well-written story with fun characters and witty dialogue. Has lots of good trope-skewering moments and affectionate parodies.
-Controls smoothly, maneuvering isn't an issue and the platforming is good.
-Good level variety.

CONS
-Combat is weak. The maneuvers you can do are very limited (Punch or throw grenade), and some enemies can be frustrating due to too much health, too many of them, or attacks that are too tough to dodge.
-Boss fights are kind of meh; Good concept, but often weak execution due to oversimplification or the heroes acting like predictable bosses, destroying the point of the fight. Can also be frustrating, ESPECIALLY the true final boss. 
-Level design is good for the most part, but can be very obtuse/annoying in a few places (Looking at you, last level).
-Wonky sound design; Some sound effects are too loud, others are too soft or just aren't there when they should be.
-Not much replay value outside of finding the crowns (Which do nothing as far as I know).
-Short; As noted above I completed it in one sitting. However, it was a long one and it's a $15 budget title.

OVERALL
I think this game had a superb concept and some mostly-good execution but some iffy parts; The team behind it put passion and interest into it and probably put a lot of love into it and I absolutely appreciate that, but there are a few mistakes that make me think they were inexperienced. Or maybe they didn't have the resources considering the Kickstarter just barely made its goal. Regardless, as a fun little $15 game, I rather liked it. It's a little disappointing compared to what I was expecting; Honestly, with the fact that the devs clearly were invested in the project I would feel really bad giving it a negative review. It's still an all right time, though; I would rate it at about a 7/10. Maybe 6.5.",1486423894,1486424426,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is by far the most excellent part of the game. The dialogue is clever and fun, and the story is enjoyable while allowing the player some agency over its direction. 

My only complaints were a few platforming puzzles that felt awkward and not fun to traverse. Also, the sound effects could use improvement in a few ways. Namely, some sounds are not well normalized and are too loud versus the rest of the music and sounds. Also, there are moments where, if you had the music off, there would not be enough sound effects to match the action going on. There needs to be a few more sound hooks for explosions and other events in the game, particularly during boss fights and cutscenes. 

The soundtrack is very good. The vocal bits were really well done, and for the most part, everything fit very well with the game. Similar to the audio complaint above, there are some moments where, for cinematic purposes, it would be nice to have a music cue change, but the same track keeps looping. A minor complaint though, as all the tracks are good.

Overall, I'd give this game a good 80% rating. I think it would have benefitted from one more polish pass over some of the awkward platforming segments, the sound hooks, and some cinematic moments ending a bit a bruptly. If those were polished up, it'd be a 90%+ game in my opinion.

Most of the characters are simple enough, while still be exciting.

However, what a lot of people criticize it for is the gameplay.

The gameplay isn't phenomenal, and shouldn't be why you play it.  It's simple and fun enough that you can usually breeze through and enjoy the rest of the beautiful game without too much issue, with just enough challenge that it feels like you're actually doing something.
When it does get hard, it's usually obnoxious jumping challenges or parts that just feel unfair.  That doesn't happen often, so it's not too big of a deal, but as said before, it reinforces that this isn't really the game you play to get a game with solid gameplay.

There's also a few places where the world wasn't made quite perfectly, so if a few small flaws will get to you, perhaps something else.

I beat this game in a single run in 3 hours 35 minutes. But that is because I tend to blow through platformers, and speedrun similar playing games. 50 minutes were likely dedicated to the Secret True Ending path alone, which is a decent increase to the time if you did the math.

A quaint little game with an interesting premise. There is an always present problem with playing a villain (or just a dark side character) in any game ever - it always comes down to one of two ways: either game forces you to be a complete douchebag who is a jerk to anyone and everyone just for the sake of it, regardless if it is beneficial for you or not, OR while you're being called ""bad guy"" throughout the game, the ""good guys"" are actually much worse than you so the only difference from being a hero in some other game is switched labels.
Nefarious manages to gracefully dodge both of those pitfalls - the protagonist, Crow, is definitely a villain through and through (the whole point of the game is wreaking havoc, stealing coins and kidnapping royalty), yet he doesn't do anything depraved, adheres to some sort of moral code, etc. And, spoiler alert, Crow never does heel-face turn - he is the villain till the end.
So if that's the experience you were looking for - playing the villain ""as seen in the NES era games"", then look no further.

Some think that they stand on the shoulders of giants, contributing little and coasting on nostalgia.

As the name would suggest, this game casts you in the role of a dastardly antagonist, and each level ends with you mounting into some overcomplicated contraption to stomp out a hero.

I want to love this game so much. It's premise is super fun. Every level is unique. So many little things in the game made me laugh, which is no becoming a rarity these days. I love all the banter.  I can't stress how good the music is.  Great twists on the game etc etc.

However the game play is...lack luster. I found myself in quiet a few infinite death loops near the end of the game because I was either dorking around or got hit by something mid air and then glitched through whatever platform I landed on.  Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the hell out of this game. But I feel like there was a lot of potential to go full ham on this.  However this isn't too bad when you consider that the kickstarter fund was only 50k for development.

I really hope that the creators use this game to understand and expand on this universe. This has so much great potential and I would hate to see it go away. It was a ballsy move to use Unity 2d platformer imo. It can be a tricky beast as I often found its coding to be floaty at best. 

Anyway. I would highly recommend this game if it goes on sale or you need something to kill the day with. It's still cheaper then a movie and just as entertaining.",1486034916,1486034916,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I think this game is a good start for Starblade.  I think this game touches on some right ideas well but misses hard on others.  

Pros:
Artstyle - very similar to those seen in many Wayforward games.  This is a good thing.  The background art sometimes is a bit lacking but overall is good.  

Control - The controls are free-aim + sidescroll platforming.  They offer many simultaneous options to control the game.  You have the option to use trigger/bumpers only while using dual sticks or if you prefer face buttons you can use just the right stick to move/aim while always having the left stick available to you for precision aiming w/o moving.  

Weapons - Punching things is super satisfying.  Honestly I think the game should have focused more mechanics based around the big robotic arm rather than the projectile based weapons.  Though I think those are quite satisfying to use as well.  There was a level where you are given a grenade whose smoke trails create temporary platforms and that made for some interesting mechancis.

Level Design - Overall level design is well done.  There is a decent variety of enemies who are exclusive to each map and they are deliberately placed in logical places with intended player solutions in mind.   There are a couple of visual language cues that don't communicate well and sometimes you end up dying because of those confusions.  Overall though traversing the levels are at least fun.

Mixed bag:

Narrative - The humor is smirk-worthy.  Other times it's cringe.  At its best you get exchanges with local heroes and their hang ups in life.  At worst you are actually reading the phrase ""bust-a-cap"".   The dialog is accompanied by this robotic chugging sound for all characters.  I think this was a poor choice.  The art and writing has a lot of personality while this sound constantly going while you read robs much of that personality away.  There has to be a better design choice here.  Others have used simpler methods like single voice lines (laughs, grunts, oohs, and aahs), emotive gibberish also works too, and when all else fails use nothing or subtle blip noises from older games.

Music -   Some tracks do a good job adding to the whole ""puckish villainy"" motif of the game while others are poor cultural pastiches with gibberish vocals which sometimes grate on the nerves.  Overall this is neither a great or terrible soundtrack.  It's pretty middle of the road.

Boss fights - The first boss fight was a simple ""take their weapons and turn it against them"".  Cut and dry but clever enough.  Every other boss fights are scenarios that utilize their own exclusive mechanics not used anywhere else in the game.  Don't do this.  Boss fights should be a test of your mastery of the mechanics you've spent the level mastering.  At best you are given a somewhat enjoyable wrecking ball fight based around using physics and motion.  At worst you are frustrated trying to crush a viking with giant fists using dubiously consistent aiming and hit detection.  I know what they were trying to do (you are the bad guy so you are the boss fight) but in terms of player game mechanics this is bad design and it served no benefit to the game.  These types of things should only be bonus stages, not boss fights.


Verdict:

It's far from a perfect game but it's a good start from a budding indy studio.  There's definitely talent and potential exhibited here.  The game itself can use some tweaks and fixes here and there but overall is fun enough.  It's at the very least worth getting when on sale.",1486016238,1486093762,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The Story is interesting and amusing. There's plenty of references to a lot of games, even a modern ones.  The animation is tight and colorful. As said in various places, there's boss fights, but from the Bad Guy's perspective. Remember the very first boss fight in Sonic the hedgehog 1? the one with the wrecking ball? You get to use it against a sonic-ish character!

While the game might be short, compared to games nowadays, I'd rather have a short good game that I can pick up anytime, than a long one where it takes me awhile to get back to if I am away from it for a period of time.

Now for the pros, cons, and on the fences that I have about the game

Pros
+Humor
+animation of the characters
+ Can use Keyboard and Mouse, or Controller.
+Easy to learn on how to move around and fight in the boss fights.

Cons
-Could use a way to configure the control
-the grenade weapon is a bit tricky to use and can miss a lot when you're in a hurry.
-Could use a way to reload to the last checkpoint.

On the fence
?From what I hear, the boss fight on the good path is really hard
?Could use something like homing missiles or grenades
?Grenade jumping is still a bit tough to use at times for me.

All in all, the game is worth checking out at least once.",1485972642,1485972642,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I absoloutley love the main character, Crow is a cleaver, well designed, and almost literal representation of the villian trope complete with an arsenal of weapons that would make Dr. Robotnik jealous. Every other princess was adorably drawn and had a little character to them, just, not as much as Crow. They all seemed two dimensional compared to the work put into Crow. The artwork is beautiful  especially in the portraits but when I looked down at the sprites they were cute but... not nearly as well designed as the portraits. What really bothered me was whenever you entered a boss fight the sprites wouldn't change at all. They would just stand where a seat would be and continue their mini animation loop while in the machine.  The music was cute but personally, it kind of layed on top of the level instead of imersing the player into the world they designed. When you are in the dwarf kingdom and the princess decides to make crow her new steed the music just continued on casually, failing to convey any sense of excitement or energy. In the very same level- should you die during the ""boss""- you would respawn with the same music playing but it would soon change and fade into the new song. For me that made me feel I hadn't finished the previous portion of the level and and skipped over it in my mind, feeling as if I had just selected a random mini game instead of fighting a boss. The water level is what really did it for me though. It reminded me of a level in the new Donkey Kong Country, where everything is a color sillouette and you have to navigate that way. With this level everything felt so..flat. there was no sense of depth anywhere and everything felt like it was drawn in Microsoft paint. Some of the misc. underwater plants hovered off of the border, and the backgrounds they were placed on felt empty. The Eels felt like a two bit amusment park animatronic, lunging forward and trying to bite you and then mechanically retreating back into the wall. They came off as lifeless and mechanical, seeing where their jaws where hinged as they jumped out. The platforming was enjoyable but the constant repetition of three enemies per level seemed lazy. The fire effects wasen't stylized, it just seemed like it was grabbed from a stock animation website. 

I can't stress how much I loved this game but I was incredibly disappointed with the seemingly rushed design. It felt like I was playing a flash game..but not in a good way. I expected artwork comparable to the Shantae games. If the entire game held up to the same style and effort put in as the portraits, I think it could have been an amazing game.

I would have prefered a bit more megaman in the mix, like wall jumping, double jumps (without timing grenades) or metroid/castlevainia elements to make the platform aspect more enjoyable. there was also a few times i got miffied that I could not change weapons in the field, you need grenades or sticky grenades like 99% of the time, and the last few times where rockets or machinegun actually could have helped you more it just isnt worth it. Alot of secrets, collectibles and so on require you to use the grenades to jump up and so on. I guess i am just picky with my platformers, the whole exploding jumping is however fun the first 2-3 stages, but it gets old especially when you need to do them where a single mistake causes you to die and end up having to treck back quite a bit to try again. but for the most part those locations are near a respawn checkpoint. Well hope this review helps you decide on yes or no. I am leaning more towards no due to gameplay, but if you do not mind dying a ton of times because you are attempting to reach that chest on top of a ledge then this might actually be just your type of game.",1485821091,1485821091,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Now then, this game is kind of borderline on whether I'd recommend it or not.  I love just about everything about the game that isn't the gameplay.  The game could probably have used another few weeks for a bit of tightening and polish, a bit more content, a bit more instruction, a handful of bug fixes, some extra playtesting, that sort of thing.  The rest of it, though; the music is amazing, the level design is good when not requiring precision platforming, and the story and dialogue are all stand-outs.

The TL;DR on this is that I'd recommend it now for people who can look past some mild-to-moderately frustrating gameplay for an actually engaging story and beautiful world with awesome music.  I'd recommend this generally to anyone if it goes on sale.


[h1] Pros [/h1]

[list]
[*]The music is good.  Really good.  If you've ever read Brawl in the Family, or played Tadpole Treble, this is the game guy who did the music for those.  

[*]Once you get about a third of the way into the story, the story starts growing teeth.  You're asked to make some decisions; some minor, some major, and I actually agonized over some of these for several minutes.  I was genuinely taken aback by how much I had to consider everything.

[*]The... combat, for lack of a better word, is very satisfying.  Whether it's shooting and punching your way through minions, or trying to smash those plucky heroes, I had a lot of fun.  

[*]The writing is top-notch, especially the dialogues.  You can get a real sense of personality from what they say, and every character is vibrant and unique.

[*]I felt the animation was solid.  Now, I admit I'm not exactly a keen eye in this area, so your mileage may vary on this one, but everything felt smooth and natural as far as movements went.  Visual design in general is pretty good, too, I spent a fair bit of time just examining the background and foreground of various areas, with how much detail went into them.
[/list] 

[h1] Cons [/h1]

The cons are a bunch of little issues and a handful of big ones, none of which are really dealbreakers on their own, but can add up to larger annoyances when put together.

[list]
[*]The music isn't looped properly in several cases; by that, I mean that the song finishes, fades out, and starts over at the beginning.  

[*]The story's first third or so does itself a disservice by being kind of rote, and just generally treating Crow as a chew toy

[*]This game often asks you to do precision platforming when the character feels kind of floaty (notably, momentum is preserved somewhat oddly).  Throw grenade jumping with both fixed and moving targets in the mix, and things get really frustrating.  Most of my deaths were trying to navigate said sections.

[*]Relatedly, the physics tend to act a bit differently than you expect them to.  The grenades actually work fine, but when you need to send one thing flying into another thing, you're likely going to be frustrated.

[*]Side note to platforming, the game loves to include breakable blocks, sometimes as obstacles, usually as helpful platforms.  99% of the time, nothing is hidden behind them or inside them, and you can actually get yourself into serious trouble if you break blocks you shouldn't.  I can't even think of why some of these are there, since there's no combat in some of the ""helpful platform"" parts.  This legtimiately baffles me; the only reason I can think of is to give the opportunity for the more explorative players to get themselves stuck.

[*]The game is short.  I clocked in 5 hours to do everything except a handful of achievements and attempting to S-rank everything.  While it makes good use of the time, the game does leave a couple unanswered questions and lingering plot threads that they really could have addressed with an extra level or two.

[*]The game's really bad at explaining some things.  Most notably, during the ""reverse boss fights"", you're given a whole new set of controls and mechanics without being told what those controls are.  I died a few times in one of these because I didn't know I could dodge the enemy's attacks.

[*]Achievements are bugged, for good and ill.  I got the achievement asking me to collect the first crown in the stage by collecting the vinyl, instead (I couldn't figure out how to get the crown, so I left it behind).  On the frustrating side, I collected all the crowns (I'm presuming, since I collected all the vinyls, too), without it giving me either crown collecting-related achievement.

[*]Voice acting in the game is minimal, in that the character usually says one word or makes some noise related to the topic.  The exceptions are the tutorial intro (narrated) and one box of dialogue at the end of the tutorial stage (sung).  I wouldn't be so annoyed about this if the very first thing we heard wasn't voice acting.

[*]There's a few other miscellaneous issues, ranging from a bug that made me restart a level that I couldn't reproduce, to the occasional breakable object buried deep inside the floor for no reason, to not really being able to interact with your minions to a large degree.  The backer minions say the same thing every single time, and nothing really changes the HQ itself between missions, so the whole thing tends to feel stagnant.

[/list]

In it's current state, it's a solid game. The gameplay is good where it counts. Especially the boss fights, since you're the boss fighting the good guy with death machines. They resemble past boss fights like Final Fantasy, Sonic, etc. The goal of capturing the princess is about the same as playing the good guy. Fight good enemies, open treasure chests and collecting coins. The usual.

Picking up princesses will alter the gameplay after you pick them up. The bee princess will make Crow's (lead character) jumps floaty. Because her wings are flapping in a panic. It is a rather funny game all in all. The loading screens are practically non existant as they only flash on screen for a second.

However the game is in version 1.0. So there is a bunch of missing sound effects from the good henchmen that protect the princess. The platforming needs some polish. As there is no warning of when stuff may come up. Unlike in Mega Man, they spell out what kind of attacks an enemy has. There is no spacing between the player and the enemy. So expect some moments of ""How was I supposed to avoid/get that?""

There are destructable cubes that Crow can destroy. Very small amount of moments occur when a cube does not line up with other platforms. Jumping and punching do not seem to pair up properly. It is different then Castlevania with the whip delay and more like jumping and attacking do not work as often as they should. So there is moments of punching the air on the ground when the player is trying to jump and attack.

In conclusion I do reccomend this game to anyone who likes the concept of playing the villain. It is just that this game still needs some finishing touches on it's master plan. Mua-ha-ha!",1485738986,1485738986,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Nefarious  brought back memories of playing the Mega Man franchise, especially in the SNES era. This game has catchy 'get stuck in your head' music, and a hilarious, intellegent story. Nefarious is a very self-aware nostalgia trip, as well as a videogame and hero/villan trope savvy adventure that has an abundance of re-play value. 

I found myself playing and re-playing the game to: 
Find all the crowns.
Get all the vinyl (like a true hipster!)
Get all the upgrades.
Attempt no upgrade runs.
Search for secret passages. 
Unlock secret levels.
Attempt speed runs.
Practice on a level or a boss fight so I can work for that better score.
Replaying to choose different options to learn more about the story of this world and the relations of the dynamic cast of characters.
Finding that better ending.
Working towards that 100% clear. 

All of the the personal accomplishments that made us re-play many games of the 8-bit ans 16-bit era. My favorite moment was when I accidentally stumbled upon a secret part of a level and I was rewarded with more backstory and a dark plot twist to what I thought was going to be a very lighthearted game. It gets dark. It gets deep. It makes you relect on past gaming experiences. 

This game was easy to pick up and hard to put down once you get into the nuances of the story. The game requires skill and practice to get all the goodies (and it leaves you feeling accomplished when you finally do find that one thing you were missing) but it doesn't have a ""skill check"" that is so hard that will make the rest of the story inaccessable.

This game is just a basic barebones platformer with a (albeit very pretty) bad guy theme pasted over it. The levels feel so simple and empty, and don't mix well with Nefarious's gameplay, no option to use a controller or rebind controls along with an out of place wonky aiming system make the game feel very clunky and awkward to play. The music is also nothing to write home about.

On the other hand, the character design and artstyle are great. Everyone is expressive and looks great. They have charming personalities and really interact with eachother well. Also the whole theme of being the bad guy and taking control of the boss is a very unique promising gameplay idea.

Bottom line, Nefarious is not great. It's not bad by any means, but, at the current price and it's current state I feel it's not worth the money.

Are we good there? Ok, now for the details.

I've been following this game ever since I heard about it on the Brawl in the Family webcomic, there was just something about the concept that intrigued me. Having played through, while I felt it was a bit short for such a long wait, I'd say it's still definitely worth the price tag.

The story isn't anything too complex. Kidnap princesses, manage evil empire, use doomsday device to conquer world.  What makes it memorable is the characters. Ranging from Crowe's style, to Princess Mayapple's unbreakable optimism, to Princess Farrah Day's hilarious misunderstanding of the situation, any time a dialogue box pops up, you're in for a treat.

The gameplay feels quite smooth. Jumping from platform to platform is quick and precise; combat is over in one or two punches, and although grenades do have a slight arc in their trajectory, I found that most of the things that I can't hit the first try tend to be unable to fight back. Although I will admit, any time I'm expected to bomb-jump across gaps tends to be extremely frustrating.

The Reverse Boss Battles, probably the most unique concept of the game, unfortunately ended up being the weakest aspect for me. They throw away the smooth platforming for clunky, difficult to aim attacks, and have ZERO explanation. The second reverse boss is an especially bad example of this.

I find that, at the end of it all, although there are these little points that niggle at me, it didn't subtract that much from the experience as a whole. If you're fond of old-fashioned 2D platformers, but wish they had the smoothness that today's generation can offer, give Nefarious a shot.",1485601605,1485601605,True,4,0,0.498116880655288696,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's short (only ~5 hours), but the game itself is very satasfying.

It's not without its problems.
Many...
MANY problems...
But if like platformers and good characters, you'll like this game.

From this point on, I'm going to talk about each stage, the mechanics, what works and what doesn't.
I love this game but HO BOY, are there problems.

Lets start at stage one; The City.

It's a decent opening level. Not much else to say on this front. It does a good job of establishing the senario and main characters were going to be follwing, Crow and Mayapple. It does a nice job of introducing the various mechanics used throughout the game.
It does point out what will be a major flaw, though; Crow's damage intication. Crtow's sound effect isn't very audable, the effect isn't very noticable, and the knockback is non-existant when it wants to be.
Could it have been better? Sure, but I can't point to anything specific holding this level back.
Don't worry (Or do), I will later on.

Well, now that were done kiling cops and destroying massive amounts of city property, lets move on to the airship. I will be using these airship interludes to talk about certain mechanics I can't pin to one stage for a good example of. but for now, I'll just say it's nice, compact, and I like how the elevator will not stop at the second floor if you punch ""up"" again.
If the game had more little things like that strewn about, this review would probably be less negitive.

Now for stage 2, and the stage where we really start to see some of the holes form. The stage itself is fairly forgetable, unfortunetely, but the experiences arn't. Specifically, with the flying enimies here; They are too abundent and too erradic. The reapers in the last stage had far more predictable movement, making hitting them with the grenades a challenge, but not annoying like with the flying bees. The other enemies are fairly standard (and the Manti are actually fun to kill).
Then you rescue Bee princess (I forget her name)and you come to THAT area. An area I have dubbed ""Cluster-fuck Collum"", Because it is mostly just an upwardpath chock full of enemies. It's not challanging, it's annoying.
Otherwise, Dull stage, Dull power, and... Ok, the princess isn't dull, she has a few good lines, so I can't give this the triple D.

The Reverse boss fight here is a play on the classic eggman wrecking ball machine, but YOU control the ball.
The fight itself, (Minor Spoilers) Is arguabely the best Reverse boss in the game, as it works like it's inteded too, there's no way to cheese it, and it's just fun to wave around the wrecking ball. Dash's mechanic of building up towers to hit your ship is fun and works well with the boss (or... Hero? I'm going to call these hero fights from now on. it'll be easier.)

It's your standard platforming action: hopping across platforms, grabbing coins and collectibles, punching and blowing up enemies. It's simplicity done well, and it manages to please most audiences to a certain degree - whether you're a casual player, a speedrunner or a completionist, there's something here for you in the gameplay.

The story is nothing truly special overall, but the way the dialogue is written is nothing short of charming. That and, the appreciable hand-drawn art style and generic, yet wholesome and appropriate, music makes this a solid parody game.

Where the game does have room for improvement is largely polishing work. I'm playing the v1.0 right out the gate, so this isn't entirely surprising. The end of each stage transitions (sometimes jarringly) between the final boss battle and the grade screen with little to no ceremony. Additionally, it felt like there were some control limitations, as if some artificial difficulty had been inserted to give the game a ""classic"" feel. It honestly may have just been me being bad at game, though, so this is a minor quibble. Some art assets also felt out of place due to how three-dimensional objects ""popped"" versus the two-dimensional models, but that's another easy clean-up thing.

While in the beginning, when I just started playing the game it felt kinda cheap in terms of graphics, design, soundtrack seemed kinda odd with all these themes with vocals...But the more I played - the more I enjoyed it. All dialogs in the game and overall character interactions are just golden, by the end of the game I was so attached to almost all the characters and their personalities it was even sad the game ended. Gameplay is simple and yet fun, upgrades add a nice touch to gameplay and one can customize Crow with skills he prefers.
I've always liked villain characters, especially those who have this special charisma about them and Crow does the thing for sure. And while he is trying hard to act as a bad guy there is some good stuff in him in a right amount, so ""good stuff"" doesn't spoil him as a villain and only adds to the character's greatness. 

Also, while there are plenty of games where you play as evil character I wonder why did nobody ever thought of reverse boss battles, where you are the boss - it's just a genius thing that got me interested in the first place. I hope devs will sometime do a sequel, there is so much room for new stuff and ideas.

In the end I can say that I found something special in this little game, something  that captivatd me. Maybe some people won't like it that much but iff you like platformer games like shovel knight, megaman x games etc. I would highly recommend to try this game out.

This is one of those games. The would-be greats, the ones that could have, should have been good, but for whatever reason or other just didn’t end up being. These tend to upset me more than just outright bad games, since it seems so easy to look at things that could have been changed to make it great. Nefarious has a lot of those.

You play as Crow, latest in a line of bird-themed sky pirates whose MO is kidnapping princesses. His typical target is Princess Mayapple, but is always foiled by her kingdom’s hero, Mack. At the end of the game’s tutorial level, though, Mack decides to throw in the towel by breaking up with Mayapple, since in his own words she sees Crow more than he does. It’s a good introduction to the game and decently humorous.

Even though he’s not used to actually winning, Crow decides to go whole hog with the opportunity, and steal four more princesses to power a doomsday device and take over the world. Each resides in a different themed kingdom with its own gimmick, and you have to bust through their security, kidnap them, and make it back out. You do this through platforming, and this is where the game unfortunately starts to become lack-luster.

Crow’s arsenal consists of a metal gauntlet he can either punch people with, or fire grenades out of. You can do these in any direction you want, although bizarrely your punch is right click on a mouse and the grenades are bound to the left, which seems really backwards. Now, even though you’re the villain (a very silly, essentially harmless villain, but one nonetheless) in the story, it never felt to me like that factored into the gameplay much. These two attacks are pretty much all Crow has, and he ends up feeling weaker than many heroes from similar games: Mega Man and Shovel Knight have a whole arsenal of weapons by the end of their games, Kirby has whatever power you want to have, Mario is a deft acrobatic, Shantae can shapeshift into a ton of different forms, and that’s only a few examples. Crow doesn’t really have anything unique of his own, and that would be bad enough if he were just the hero, but the idea of most villains is that they’re set up as superior to the hero, a real obstacle. 

Which Crow still sort of is, but only because the game is so easy. You can breeze through the stages pretty easily, and most enemies are ineffectual. You start with three heart containers, and damage typically comes in halves. Health drops very often, and you can buy three more hearts inexpensively, letting Crow take up to twelve hits before expiring. All death does anyway is make you drop a bit of your money, Shovel Knight style.

Midway into each stage, you kidnap that world’s princess, and gain an ability from each of them (except for Mayapple since her kingdom’s the tutorial). This is where something interesting could have come into play, but I found it a letdown. The first, a bug princess, gives you a hover-jump, which isn’t bad but has been done before. The second, a dwarf, turns the rest of the level into an auto-scroller after she decides to make Crow into her steed. I actually really liked the demon kingdom’s gimmick, where you send out a wave of fire upon throwing a grenade which hardens into a platform, but you hardly use it. Once you bring a princess back to the ship you don’t use their ability again, so none of their mechanics feel as fleshed out as they could be.

Before that, though, you have to deal with the heroes protecting them. In theory this is where Crow’s villainy comes more into play, as instead of fighting them on foot you hop into one of his robots, flipping the perspective around. That’s a great idea, but the devil lies in the execution. The first of these places you in what’s basically the wrecking ball hovercraft Doctor Robotnik used in the very first Sonic boss fight. Instead of it working like that game, though, you’re fighting with the physics engine to swing the ball at a fairly small target, sort of spoiling the homage. In the second, you’re in a giant robot (I assume also a Robotnik reference, in this case to his final fight in Sonic 3 & Knuckles) trying to pound a dwarf with its fists, but your movement is limited to jerking the body back and forth, and punching at the same two spots. It’s clumsy, and nowhere near as enjoyable as I imagine they hoped. The two guys you fight also have clear patterns and vulnerability periods, so they don’t really feel like you’re fighting something controlled by the player - compare it to Shovel Knight’s boss fight in Plague Knight’s campaign, where he has tactics for every situation and uses his full arsenal of weaponry.

A lot of other reviews of this game praise the characters, and here I sort of have to disagree. The princesses you kidnap are pretty one note, and while Crow himself is a decent character, he’s the same kind of ‘laughable bad guy’ I’ve seen in plenty of other media. It’s not anything new, and that’s actually true on Steam as well, since Plague Knight (I'm sorry for bringing that game up so much in this review) pretty much does everything Crow does but with much better gameplay. I was particularly disappointed with the heroes you fight, since they're practically non-entities aside from Mack and only show up for their fights. It feels like they could have been a more constant premise, although that would probably take more levels for each kingdom.

Overall Nefarious could have been a classic, but unfortunately the gimmick seems to have overshadowed having really good, or even just solid gameplay, and you can’t get away with not having that in a platform game.",1485482066,1485579095,False,102,0,0.72096717357635498,3,True,False,False,False,,,

-controls occasionally feel like they're fighting you instead of helping you during non-platformer segments

-two of the grenade upgrades effectively limits your ability to 100% any given platformer level by not allowing grenade-jumping.
Pros:
+hitboxes are somewhat generous and levels ease players in for the most part by throwing more advanced and damaging enemies in as you progress
+interesting topics and idea are brought in character dialogue that toy with the idea of what heroes and villains are in context of the game;
+inside jokes/references/shout-outs
+dying doesn't make you want to quit; and punishes only by taking away a fraction of your money (like Shovel Knight)
+You're allowed to win as a villain; and you feel like you've earned it by the end of the game.

My main problem was the presentation, mostly the audio. Most of it is bland or generic, blending into the background. This stood out to me especially in the dwarf level with the miniboss. The regular music was used for the entire fight, making the whole thing feel less exciting than it otherwise would have.

In addition to this, there are very few sound effects, and the game seemingly doesn't acknowledge if you lose against the heroes in the boss fight - not even the far too speedy and soundless window that normally appears when you die. I'm not saying that your money should drop if you lose these fights, I'm saying there should be slightly more here than an unceremonious dump to the checkpoint 5 seconds before the fight.

More, minor issues include using B (on a 360 controller) to talk to people, but trying to open the upgrade screen by pressing B immediately closes it. Also, even if using a controller, keyboard prompts appear during cutscenes by default each time until you press a button. The game should at least remember what input device I'm using.

I personally reccomend Nefarious to anyone who's looking for a fun platformer filled to the brim with charm. All my cynicism washed away right when the game drops you into the action. 

The art style is great. Each character has a design that perfectly fits their personality. You might believe otherwise, but this is actually something you rarely see in games. I wish the in-game sprites were as consistantly good as splash-art. If anything should be updated, it would have to be that. 

Sound design is on point too. While none of the songs are playlist-worthy, I found myself fighting to the death to collect the record collectables scatterd in each level so I could relisten to the level music in my might villious warship of death and destruction! 

The gameplay is simple and functional. It does its job well enough, and never overstays its welcome. The reason you buy this game is for the character interaction, art, music, or for the reverse boss-battles. The normal platforming is good. I find the grenade launcher and rocket jumping to not work all the time. I will say, that when I needed them to work the must, they did. Take that as you will. 

At $15 for a rock-solid 6+ hour experience, there is no reason not to buy this game right away! Especially right now, when it's 10% off.",1485385353,1485385353,True,1,0,0.482315093278884888,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Deep down I knew I really wanted to be the villian. If you wanted to kidnap princesses and cause chaos as only a true villian could, I suggest this game. With Nefarious, puch and lob grenades through each level with the goal of kidnapping the princess. Along the way you collect crowns and records as well as collect money.

After you manage to kidnap your princess you must make an escape. Each princess will alter your abilities during the remaining portion of the level. And of course what good would being a villian be if you could not face off against the heros? At the end of each level you must fight that stage's hero. You do so by using a giant robot fit for the task.

There is plenty of humor in the game, and a few surprises to those that look for them. The music was, for the most part enjoyable. The controls are not the greatest, and takes some getting used to.

The game itself lasts for a short 4-6 hours.

Overall, I do recommend this game. It was a refreshing take on the genre. I do hope there will be another Nefarious down the road.

I would be lying if I said that I wasn't torn on weither I would recommend this game or not, but my view centres almost dead in the middle with a score that would probably be a 5/10. This is why ended up saying it isn't worth it. The price compared to the quality of content you get here is quite frankly a bad deal. With a few more pounds, you could get any of the two recent Shantae games instead.

Anyway, let me explain why I don't believe this game is worth it.


I think it would be best to start with the presentation, as that's most likely the thing to hook you in and try it. I was hooked in by the artwork by Gashi Gashi, an artist whom I had seen numerous times before. I felt excited to see their talent used for a video game, however, I was sorely disapointed when I found out that their artwork is only used in conversation segments of the game. The rest of the game boasts a fairly decent artstyle, albiet a bit... bad? In places? It varies on a level to level basis, seemingly almost at random. One good example is an underwater scene where for some reason the artstyle abruptly changes to matte and solid colours. Another one is a horseback riding scene where the background is the same style as the main game, but both your character and the enemies are coloured only in red and blue. Was there actually an art direction in this game? 

This game doesn't look bad, I'm not saying it does, but it has a HUGE lack in consistency. Gashi Gashi's phenominal work atop the game's lukewarm, sometimes MS Paint esq artstyle creates a huge disconnect for me personally. One specific scene where you're on a dating show just looks... pretty bad. I spent most of my time looking at the conversation icons instead of the actual scene the characters were placed in. 


The music to me is also a bit of a disapointment. There are a few tracks that really stand out and create such a nice atmosphere, like the one in the underwater segment, but the rest are pretty bland and generic. Mostly uninteresting songs you could shove into any 2D platformer and get similar results. At least the music is always there, unlike the sound design. I honestly began to wonder if the game was just horribly bugged to the point that some sounds just chose not to play. But nope, it turns out that there's just isn't that much sfx in the game anyway. It really does feel like there wasn't much of an effort to create a game that both looked and sounded interesting.

The gameplay is pretty much your typical 2D platformer, however, it's inspirations become very clear once you've played but a few levels. Most of it came from Shovel Knight if I had to guess. Grenade jumping somewhat like what the Plague Knight does with his bombs. Death mechanics which are pretty much just a copy paste. Stupid and unfair death pits which only serve to artificially increase the difficulty. There really isn't much new in this game to experience gameplay wise if you have already played Shovel Knight. 
However what really does actually piss me off, is how the game introduces and throws away interesting game mechanics in the same level. Each Princess you capture has a different mechanic to them, but guess what? A majority of them are literally used once in the level you capture them in and no where else. There's one where throwing bombs creates a smoke cloud you can walk on, creating some very intriguing and interesting terrain puzzles. However after having 15 minutes of fun with it, it leaves never to be seen again. So much oppertunity was lost in making you just chug through every new game mechanic. 

So, what can I praise in this game? It's characters. Each character is noticably diverse and interesting, their personalities shining through the sometimes brilliant writing that went into the story. Each character's interaction with each other is a delight to read, especially those involving Crow (the protagonist). Crow is smug, witty and overall a great hoot of a character to watch. His quips and comebacks to each situation keeps him feeling like the star of the show. The other characters are given a decent amount of time in the spotlight too, with the princesses all having a different view on Crow and their surroundings. It really is the biggest strength this game has, alongside it's character design maybe.

I could really see this game being right up WayForward's alley. It's 100% something they would do, but the excecution here is decent at best. It lacks overall quality in areas that it matters, polish is missing from all the levels which are quite blocky and uninteresting anyway, and it introduces and abandons interesting game mechanics a few minutes into their initial introduction. 

Like I said, it's a 5/10. You may think I'm being too harsh, but for £10, I think my score is easily justified.",1485380960,1485381369,False,9,0,0.516161918640136719,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
[list]
[*]The boss fights are a blast, crushing heroes with classic end-boss superweapons (usually, if not always, inversions of classic boss fights from other series).
[*]The story is funny, and the writing (as long as you do the side quests) is fantastic.
[*]The majority of graphics have a fun, clean, cartoony style that properly evokes the best of slapstick.
[*]The platforming is challenging, but features forgiving mechanics to prevent it from becoming frustrating.
[*]The music is well-arranged and well-performed.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Crow's ""signature"" punch actually feels rather lackluster. The range too short, and the animation too delayed, to almost ever make it preferable to the grenade launcher, which you get the feeling is the primary mouse button for a reason. Not only that, but it takes several punches to destroy destructible obstacles, which are almost always boring purple blocks. For a supervillain weapon, it's underwhelming.
[*]Likewise, the ""grenade jumping"" mechanic seems unfinished: I never saw it explained in-game, the timing is difficult, and it's basically never necessary. You're more likely to fall to your death than get anywhere.
[*]The faces of some of the characters in-game areoften disconcertingly different ([i]very[/i] simplistic & disproportionate) from the well-drawn faces presented in the portraits for dialogue.
[*]The writing of the characters could have been fleshed out more: characters' (especially minions') dialogue rarely change, and the characters feel like stereotypes of themselves if only because most only get a little screentime.
[*]Some areas seem designed more for appearance that functional platforming; for example: platforms that can only be reached at the absolute apex of your jump, (forcing you to jump ""into"" the wall rather than ""on to"" it), and it can frequently be hard to tell background objects from foreground ones
[*]Levels involving jumping off of grenades suspended in midair are buggy, they frequently don't trigger, leaving you to fall to your death.
[*]Some ""missing"" graphics: some enemy projectiles disappear upon colliding with terrain but show no animation when they do, things falling into lava, etc. leave no ""splash"", and in fact fall in ""front"" of it, making it look like a background instead of a hazard.
[*]There are a few actual glitches: walking off of one type of platform directly onto another may trigger the ""falling"" and ""landing"" animations despite not really dropping, and one map has moving platorms that move down into what is apparently the ""fallen to death"" zone, despite no graphical cue (such as lava) of the danger
[*]Sound effects tend to range from hardly noticable to shrill

The game is not capped to 60fps, running great at 144fps.
The dialogue is very funny. 
The art design is excellent. 

Cons) 

There is an excellent game in here however I feel it needs a bit more polish, the major problem with the game that I've noticed is the sound design. I'm not the only one who has noticed it either. 

Stock sound effects, Music that doesn't loop and has too much of an easy going tone for the game plus there is no victory fanfare when you win a hero fight. 

Beyond that there is instances of missing graphical effects that most other games have. For example when you're in the level select screen and select the next area you'd normally expect some kind of scene transition but instead it just instantly loads the next thing. 

Compare that to the newest Shantae game, when you select a level you get an appropriate sound effect and animation before fading to black. This is just one example too. 

Don't get me wrong here, maybe that sort of thing doesn't bother you and if thats the case all power to you but I can't help but notice these things and it does take me out of whatever I'm doing. 

I wish there was a middle ground between yes and no on the recommendation, because right now I'd say this was a fairly average experience due to the sound shortcomings. I have to be honest and not recommended the game. 

The good news is the  problems I have with the game can be fixed so I'm hopeful for that in the future.",1485301102,1485301172,False,18,0,0.588419914245605469,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Now it's finally out, and it was a day-one purchase for me simply because I was waiting for it for the better part of a couple years. Was it worth the wait?

Okay, let's start with the positives: The game looks real great and the animations are smooth. I can notice the odd slip-up with graphics here and there, but for the most part everything looks good. The different looks of the stages are a nice touch as well, with some of them being bright and colourful and some being dark and ominous. There are only about five different ""islands"" spread out between all the levels in the game, so you will notice a bit of repetition in graphics between the levels that take place on the same island, however.

Gameplay is good, and playing with a keyboard and mouse I had few issues with the controls. The controls do take a little bit to get used to, especially with the mouse, where the right click is the melee attack and the left click is the ranged. Normally I would picture it being the other way around, but here I was able to get used to the controls pretty quickly. For the most part, the gameplay is largely running, jumping, punching and throwing bombs, but different gameplay mechanics come into play on some of the levels, usually just for one level. Things are for the most part kept pretty basic.

As far as the humour in the game goes, I found a lot of the dialogue to be pretty funny, and a lot of the jabs are usually at Crow's expense. There are references to all sorts of different game genres scattered throughout the game, and I'm sure most gamers will pick up on them.

Now for the negatives: The biggest, glaring one is the downright cheapness during a few of the levels. For the most part, the levels are pretty straightforward and nothing you shouldn't be able to handle, but a couple of the levels have enemy placement and instant-death surfaces that shoot the difficulty factor past hard and into unfair territory. The last level alone was the cause of most of my respawns in the game solely for how annoying the enemies and pits were.

While they're few and far between there ARE some noticeable graphic errors here and there. This is something that hopefully can be fixed later on, but for the moment it IS a little nitpick I have with the game.

Overall, I do like the game and I think it's worth picking up.

Pros:
+The storyline and the characters were fantastic. It can be hard to pull off good characteriziation in this type of game, but everything from the banter to humor was spot on for me.  
+The level designs and style of play varies, and a few levels were a neat surprise for me.
+Good music. Cracked up at the start of the Dwarf Princess' song.
+Upgrade system is logical and adds some nice variety to play.
+- Well done animations for MOST of the characters, there's a few that end up looking a little like flash animation stiff though.

Cons: 
-Some of the enemy hitboxes could be a bit wonky
-Some of the controls were not quite as on point or precision as I'd like them to be for platforming. I feel like this is a problem that follows Unity platformers though.
-The game is relatively short for the price, I made my first playthough in just under 3 hours. 
-The battles where you fight heroes can be a little jarring as your thrown into it with no instruction on how to operate what your using. They also felt slightly underwhelming when they were given top billing in the trailers.

Hier angesiedelt in den Klischee des Prinzessin-Kidnappers.
Um den Job in den unterschiedlichen Leveln zu erledigen, steht einem auch Upgrades zur verfügung, welche mit in den Leveln gesammelten Geld, erworben werden können.
Nett sind einige Anspielungen auf bekannte Spiele, ebenso sind die Dialoge hin und wieder ganz ulkig.
Die Grafik tut ihren Job, bietet aber keine überraschungen.
Was mich stört, kam sogar direkt am Anfang: Eine fehlende Vertonung. Der Anfangs Dialog ist noch schön vertont worden, was dann allerdings noch während des Anfangs zurück geschraubt wird auf maximal ein Wort und der Rest ist klassisches lesen. Nun mag das ja nicht dermaßen störend sein, wenn der Text nicht nach einer kurzen Zeit einfach weiter geht, anstelle auf die Eingabe des Spielers zu warten.
Dann finde ich irgendwie die Spielgeschwindigkeit zu langsam. Alles wirkt enormst langsam und dahin kriechend. Ich weiß nicht ob es nur an der Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit der Figur liegt oder an den Leveldesigns. Vielleicht beides.
Dann die Musik. Grauenvoll. Die finde ich enormst schrecklich geworden. Ich empfinde sie als unpassend und aus nervigem Gedudel bestehend. Da ist nichts was einem ins Ohr geht und dort auch mal gerne verweilt. Wenn die Spiel Geschwindigkeit stimmen würde, würde ich den Mad Max Soundtrack dazu eher einschmeißen!

Diejenigen welche schnellere Jumper gewohnt sind, ala Mario (die älteren NES und SNES Titel), der findet hier vielleicht nur gefallen an einigen Referenzsprüchen und -Ereignisse, auf andere Titel. Dafür ist der Preis zu hoch angesetzt.

It pains me to do this but I have to admend my review, the final boss fight in this game is such a mess of bad controls and bad design that I cant overlook it. Its to the point it has ruined the experince, and in many ways ruined the game for me. I will avoid spcifics here to keep from spoilers but I have a discussion started about it if your curious what I mean

First off gonna say I am really enjoying this game, about 3 hours in and loving it, but like so many others  I share the same thought of sound. The game has a good soundtrack and I enjoy the music but it could use some work in the sound design area. Its too quiet for the type of game it is in many places and cant stress enough how good use of sound can give impacts more umph, there have been so many times I been hit and not known it because I had no real indication that I could notice through all that was happening. Like what happens when I punch people, I need something like that to let me know when I get hit. That aside being surprised as the content in this game, more than I expected with a surprising amount of heart in the characters. That is what is snagging me more than anything.

I will be suggesting this game to friends, just with the sound design caviate I noticed, all in all good game for a good price",1485275580,1485450160,True,0,0,0.496499329805374146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've been waiting for this game [i]forever[/i].

The good:
+ 4 to 6 solid hours of gameplay.
+ Amazingly witty dialogue.
+ Wonderful soundtrack.
+ Colorful and varied visuals.
+ Wildly varied and interesting characters to interact with.
+ Well-used worldbuilding.

The bad:
- MegaMan-fast multi-grenade-jumping over a death pit while having taser bullets fired upon you from out of reach and your own projectiles potentially throwing you off the edge as well. There is such a heavy dependancy on this core gameplay mechanic that entire rooms are dedicated to nothing but flying on the wings of fixed-point respawning explosives. Over an instant death pit.
- There are few solid upgrades to your equipment -- After getting fully modded, the only things to save money for are generic health / ammo boost and optional weapon side-grades.
- Your minions are never seen actively performing any useful function (outside of ""standing idly in one place saying they secured the area while the way ahead is still full of enemies"" in the first level) and you end up spending nearly the entirety of the game doing all the work yourself, fighting your way through massive hoardes of annoying enemies singlehandedly, like a hero.
- Having full control of the camera and character during ""cutscenes"" occasionally leads to the person or thing you're interacting with being entirely offscreen, heh...
- The ""heroes"" are the least-menacing part of the entire game, instead acting as a fun minigame reward for beating everything else in the stage.

The ugly:
- When you die in a death pit, at least at the time of my playthrough, your loot is dropped [i]in[/i] the death pit, often difficult or impossible to retrieve. (And also entirely possible to break with a post-humus explosion.)
- Running up most slopes is an annoying affair, with your character repeateadly breaking into a run while abruptly losing momentum each time they do so.
- Occasional ""object scale"" bugs during cutscenes or while dying whenever in a scene where the camera is zoomed out.

Summary:
    Extremely entertaining game, some annoying gameplay elements, can be challenging at times.

The writing is fantastic. Every line is pure gold, the jokes are great, and the plot keeps me guessing.

All the characters are unique and interesting. For a game with such a stereotypical concept (kidnap princesses) it really know how to play off those tropes in interseting and creative ways.

The gameplay is arguably the weakest category. It's a side-scroller platformer with shooting and punching. But even that has a pretty balanced sense of difficulty. You're bound to die a few times unless you're the hardest of the core and there's some intense challenges if you collect everything, but it you just want to see the story, it never reaches ""insurmountable"" unless you don't know how your weapons work. 

The music is fantastic. It's not quite Undertale level, but some of those songs come close, pumping you up for action, winding you down for a moodier moment, and always, always, creating those earworm melodies that you find yourself singing along.

As far as the gameplay is concerned, I honestly wish this game had controller support as it's much harder to platform with WASD and shoot with a mouse than, say, use two analog sticks. With level design and enemy placement that creates nearly unavoidable damage at certain points, the gameplay itself is not a high point at all. Not to mention how frustrating it can be to grenade jump properly at certain points or how I experienced glitches, one of which sent me falling out of world when I stood between two police cars.

But, I never knew it was possible, until this game, that it was even possible for me to get so irritated by the small things, that I had to abandon the game. It makes me sad. This game had so much potential, and I'm really sad I had to let it go. The audio mastering was terrible, both in the general sound effects department, and in the BGM department. the BGM had its own character, and flavor, and was unique, but didn't jive with the gameplay. Fun, action-oriented levels with passive, underwhelming music in the background, I felt like all of the music being used in the main levels should have been used in instances of dialogue, instead. It's like combining an eye-opener of a game, with music you could fall asleep to.

The music was the least of my worries, however, as the sound effects for the game just sounded cheap, REALLY cheap. Which,  when combined with the aforementioned music choices, it made for a really empty experience.

I was pretty excited to play this game when it came to my attention a couple weeks ago. I was excited to play from the other side. I always thought that the villain was always the more interesting character. For a good portion of the game though, it plays out like a lot of other typical  platformers. The way the game sets itself apart being the delightful banter between characters and the power-trip of being the bad guy. There is a variety of gameplay styles included in the game, but the majority of it your standard platformer ... a platformer that  can be rather unforgiving. This really seems in contrast with the power-trip that I wanted to get out of this game. 

So yeah, the gameplay was disappointing in parts, but I fell in love with the characters. I have little desire to actually play the game anymore, but I felt I got what I paid for. I want more of the characters, but I don't feel like it has to be from here. If there was a TV show, movie, or comic book with Crow as our lead guy I'd be all over it. That being said, if this was introduced to me some other way, it wouldn't stick.

I agree with previous reviews that so far the levels are basic and easy (especially the first two) but once the 3rd stage hits the complexity kicks up a little and the music really begins fitting the action. The gameplay is smooth with the exception of the reverse boss fights, but I think these fights are meant to be a bit clunky. 

The story and humor remind me of Shantae and more than make up for the polish and complexity that Nefarious lacks. I was let down by Mighty No. 9, not so for this game. I've already got my monies worth and look forward to finishing the game.

The game's levels play like a Megaman game with the ability to power Crow up as you collect money, and a fun and interesting ""bomb jump"" mechanic that lets you perform a non-damaging double-jump when colliding with your own projectiles in mid air. An added bonus is most princesses you kidnap embue with some of their powers while you hold them, like higher jumps or unlimited ammo. Then come the bosses...

Ever played Sonic, gotten frustrated and said ""Dr. Eggman is so cheap and has it so easy in that giant machine.""?
Well, this game's signature ""reverse boss fights"" let you see from Eggman, Bowser and the like's perspective that the grass isn't neccessarily greener on the other side. Instead of playing Hulk Smash, the fights are a challenge akin to swatting a very intellegent fly.

J'attends de voir comment va évoluer l'histoire du jeu si après avoir capturé les 5 princesses il y a autre chose à faire ou non car si ce n'est pas le cas je ne donne pas plus de 3 à 4 heures de jeu.

Je ne suis pas très bon en anglais donc je n'ai pas pu tout comprendre de l'histoire juste quelques phrases mais le si peut m'a fait rire je pense que quelqu'un de douer en anglais pourra passer un très bon moment en plus du jeu.

It's certainly not a terrible game or anything - it is good. But it's not really great, either. Just kind of... average good.

Like, ok, so the art looks fantastic. The game is downright gorgeous, as you can see from the screenshots. And the writing for the story is pretty top-notch as well, and the game has some very creative moments involving the story. But as for the gameplay? Well, it's not *bad* or anything, it serves its purpose. But its not super entertaining. Once you upgrade your health one or two times, the levels become very trivial (except for the final level which spikes up in difficulty so far it feels like slamming into a brick wall). And the reverse boss fights - which were easily the thing I was looking forwards to the most, mind you - were a bit of a letdown. They all controlled a bit clunkily, and the one where you punch the ground gets special mention for being incredibly frustrating to control. Not to mention the heroes you're supposed to be fighting are very, VERY predictable, and as a result not difficult at all to fight.

But, in my opinion, the game's biggest sins come from its sound design. Now, the music on its own is all fine - I love Taranto's work, usually. This time around, however, the tracks sound... lacking. I'm not quite sure how to put it other than that. They feel like they needed maybe a couple more passes to make them something truly spectacular. On top of that, most of the time the tracks are far too sweeping and slow paced to fit the fast paced, action-y feel of the game. Also they commit the unforgivable sin of improper looping - instead of seamless loops (which have clearly been composed into the tracks), they fade out after about 2 loops and then start over at the beginning. As a sound designer myself, I cannot forgive that. It's just lazy.

Overall, this game feels... unfinished. The sound design all sounds kind of work in progress, there's a lot of areas where the game feels a bit unpolished (no death animations, no flashy animations for defeating heroes (hell, not even any dialogue for that), things that clearly should have sound effects not having them, etc.).

I still reccomend the game. For what it's worth, it's a good, servicable product. Just don't expect anything great.",1485198446,1485198446,True,111,0,0.879194855690002441,1,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is something special! 
Not only does it look beautiful with its obviously hand drawn graphics, but the music puts on the finishing touches to make the whole game feel like a well orchestrated experience. 
I got into this game expecting a simple platformer, but after the first level got surprised by the extensive and beautifully written dialouge. After a while I started caring for the characters which I didn't think i would tbh! 
Gameplay wise this game is a blast, with all its upgrades it has something for every playstyle!

JC-U3613Mだと全然動きませんが、ロジクールのF310なら大丈夫です。

オプションがボリューム調節ぐらいしかなく
フルスクリーンをAlt+Enterで強制的に切り替えると
バグります。早く何とかしてくれ。

勧善懲悪的なストーリーを逆の立場から…ってのは
国内でもそれほど珍しくない題材ですが
主人公がカッコつけてるけどちょっと間抜けそうなノリ(日本一ソフトウェア的とでも言いましょうか)と
バリエーション豊かなボス側プレイが気になったので買いました。
まだ序盤ですが、さらった姫やナイト役との掛け合いがグダグダで楽しいです。

姫をさらう道中は近接パンチとグレネードを武器に戦う
比較的シンプルなプラットフォームアクションです。
ここは個人的にマウス照準+キーボードより
ある程度角度固定でいいからゲームパッドで操作したかったですね。
難度は先に進むと結構急に上がったりします。
雪のステージは雑魚の投げてくる斧が痛かったり
姫をキャプチャーしてからは強制移動+ジャンプゲーになったり…
死んでもすぐチェックポイントから再開できるので
そんなストレスたまらないですけど。
道中に時間制限有りでいいので
ボスメカを使える要素があれば
もっと面白くなりそうなのは惜しいですね。

売りのボスバトルはまさしく醍醐味ですが
でかいなりに操作にクセがあって
小さいヒーローを狙う難しさってのを実感させてくれます
(この辺はヌルゲーにしなくて正解だと思います)
欲を言うなら、ステージごとに固定ではなくて
いくつか候補から選べたり、グレードアップ要素があっても
面白いと思うのですが。というか実装してくれまいか。

総じてアクションとしての面白さは並程度ですね。
やはり悪役主人公とどこかしらおかしい姫、ヒーローとのやり取りを
楽しむ方がメインな感じのゲームです。
買うならセールで気楽にプレイするのがおすすめです",1485190509,1488561478,True,9,2,0.572626352310180664,0,True,False,False,False,,,
