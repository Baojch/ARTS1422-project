The Fun:

1: Deep base/resource management.

The Flaws:

I honestly want to like this game. I honestly think that there is a good game here ONCE, and only ONCE, you've built up enough resources in game to get the Advanced Training Center up and running. You see, after those first three upgrades you can get with the Basic you are stuck. You will not have the power to take out any city without lots of time wasting back and forth and you can't build that ATC without several power plants set up early on. Several power plants that can take up to 2 hours of grinding, waiting, and careful planning especially if you didn't know you needed this specific set up in order to get past this sudden spike in difficulty. 

As a new player, I didn't know this, only realizing after the first half hour and spent the last hour trying to grind out those 500 Power resources I needed, which are surprisingly hard, especially if you are still learning the game. Sadly I was not able to do it in the 90 minutes I played and I doubt I can do it with 30 more minutes.

So I'm left in this situation. Grind out the next 30 minutes past the 2 hour refund time Steam draconian rules demand just so I can have the CHANCE to maybe enjoy the game to it's fullest while still risking that I might not like it or completely give up on the game before I know for sure if it's any good or not just to assure that I can at least have the 'chance' to get my money back because let's be honest, Steam isn't always consistent on their refund policy. 

Ironically, if the game didn't force me to ideal for perhaps a third of my playtime as I waited for upgrades, repairs, and buildings like a freaking dollar mobile game I could have perhaps gotten the resources I needed to properly enjoy the game and find out if I really liked it or not.

Myself and others have noticed that attempting to enter some of the larger cities will result in the game simply crashing, and you must enter those cities to step on everything in your quest for world domination in the first place. 

The monster training sessions, too, are too long and dragged out. If you want to upgrade your monster with new abilities and skills and the like, you have to set it off to the side to undergo some training, which even at the second tier can start eating away at weeks of in-game time. Who decided a vast portion of their Godzilla sim should consist of hammering the +Speed button and watching numbers tick down?

Kaijū (怪獣 kaijū) (from Japanese ""strange beast"") is a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle.

You know names like Godzilla, King Kong, Mothra, Rodan or King Ghidora? Then this game is just right for you. In Kaiju-A-GoGo you can Godzilla like stomp cities in the ground. Your monster is created by a crazy scientist who has a secret research base on an secret island in the Atlantic. To this island, you let your monster return again and again, if on the one hand your life energy perishes or on the other hand you want to upgrade your monster with new special attacks. At the same time, the base can be expanded even further. By destroying the cities, you collect resources with your monster that can then be used accordingly.

The process of destroying the city is done simply by clicking the mouse in the direction the monster should take. Everything in the way destroys your creature on its own. The longer you live out your destructive craze, the higher the alertness of the people living there increases. So, it does not take you very long to get a huge amount of military personnel attacking you with tanks, missiles, warships and fighter jets. If the life energy then sinks towards the end, then you have to leg it and run away. This is done by simply reaching the edge of the map.

What's the one thing giant monsters do best? Why destroying cities, of course! From the days of Rampage, there's something satisfying about playing as large creatures using urban landscapes as their playground. Kaiju-a-Gogo takes this concept a few steps further and lets you roll through multiple cities across the world, destroying famous landmarks, all the while building your own secret base. On paper this sounds like a great concept. And it is! ...But it's not without some flaws.

You are given the choice between several monsters from the start, with varying stats and abilities. The game barely tells you anything useful about each monster, so here's the rundown: Ginormasaurus, the mecha-godzilla clone, is probably the easiest. He's heavily armored, can carry a lot of money, eventually gets combat drones, and can get two(!) city-wide AoE attacks. Armagordon, the super-sized Bane, is best suited for hit-and-runs, able to move and strike quickly, has point-blank AoE, and can automatically grab all resources dropped, but is generally fragile. Shrubby is a slow oversized regenerating Pirahna Plant with long range, spawnlings, and strong anti-air. Pick your kaiju and start demolishing your first city.

Combat is pretty straightforward. Click on the map and your monster will automatically attack anything in its path as it walks to that point. You are given a hotbar of 6 slots (or more depending) to use various abilities that you eventually learn. This can unfortunately get old quickly, as combat is painfully slow, especially when starting out and you have no abilities. Training new skills takes a very long time as well, so you might be stuck with nothing new for quite some time. Things don't start to pick up until you get some real AoE which comes late. Having been through the game a few times, I feel the game could use a fast forward option to speed up combat. It's tempting to try to have cities surrender on the first go, but it might be a good idea to run when your coffers are full and come back later, as you won't have to put up with prolonged city defcons, and spend less time healing back up.

I'd say the game could use more tutorials, as it's not inherently obvious how to train new abilities, or even how to build buildings properly. The build interface is weird for a variety of reasons. First of all, in order to build a structure, you must click on the resource icons below the building, not the picture above. If you change your mind and don't want to build the structure, it goes all the way back to start, forcing you to scroll all the way back to where you were. If you try to place a building on a tile you can't build on, it only gives you an option to cancel, which is not only unnecessary, but might cause a player to wonder why they can't build stuff. There's also one strange design decision; on most screens and submenus, hitting escape merely brings up the save menu, but on the build screen it actually does close the window, so I get confused.

One problem I have with the training system is that there's no respec/refund option so that you can't test out an ability to see if it's to your liking. This is particularly irritating as training some later abilities take upwards of a month and cost rare resource, purpletonium. If the skill sucks, tough luck. I would like some method to speed up training too, as the game's flow grinds to a halt when going on training binges.

The single most ridiculous feature of this game is having your base found out. At this point the game will periodically send invasion fleets to attack your base, costing you far more time and resources than it's worth to defend, and a good game I spent 15 hours on went to complete waste because of this. There's a bug to avoid these, but rather than resort to that, it's far better to seek and destroy hunter fleets when they appear so that they can't find your base in the first place. The game mentions hunter fleets the first time, but after that, you must dilligently look for any new hunter fleets that pop up without warning.

The game runs... poorish. This might be a dealbreaker for some, but yeah, the game crashes without fail. Should the game crash during combat, you'll have to load an autosave from the start of combat because you are not allowed to save in battle. On top of that, there can be slowdown if there's a lot of stuff on the screen. I played the game a year ago before writing this and these problems persist even now.

There is one shining beacon through all this though - it is relatively easy to edit the game! Most of the game's editable files are in plain text, so if you want to create truly apocalyptic skills, you certainly can. I have to admit, the ability to do this bumped up my enjoyment quite a bit, but the rest of this review is from the perspective of the default game settings.

Despite the crashes, I find the game fun, especially once you get the crazy AoE abilities, but before reaching that point, I could easily see many people quitting long before then. I give Kaiju-A-GoGo a C, which could easily be improved if the bugs were ironed out and the game sped up. With the ability to edit the game files, I bring the score up to a B because who doesn't want to see 20 city blocks nuked in one go?",1525534338,1525615307,True,6,1,0.574486792087554932,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Знаете, в игрострое частенько встречаются ситуации, когда на словах определённая игра звучит просто невероятно привлекательно. А на деле получается вываленный в паразитах какиш. Перед нами как раз такой случай. Согласитесь, возможность поиграть за огромного монстра, крушащего города и нагибающего весь мир звучит очень вкусно. Но увы, всё крайне печально. Разберём же:
Плюсы:
[list]
[*]Симпатичный арт-дизайн городов.
[*]Более-менее разнообразные враги, включая особых боссов, которые спавнятся только в высокоуровневых городах.
[*]Встречаются забавные шутейки в разговорах персонажей.
[/list]
Минусы:
[list]
[*]Унылый гринд. Наш кайдзю может таскать с собой лишь ограниченное количество ресурсов, которых почти всегда будет достаточно мало. В итоге приходится из раза в раз ходить штурмом на какой-нибудь город, собирать там максимально допустимные для нашего монстрика ресурсы и тащить их домой. Всё это медленно, долго и несправедливо. Несправедливо, потому что ресурсов на строительство зданий (да, у нас есть своя база, на которой надо их строить) требуется много. И этого мало: каждый игровой месяц у нас забирают кучу ресурсов, ведь надо кормить свою базу, снабжать её энергией и, видимо, платить миллионы долларов налогов. Это очень быстро надоедает.
[*]Зачистка городов осуществляется понижением морали. Мораль падает, когда у города умирают жители. И, чёрт возьми, это тоже очень долго. Для захвата города нужно опустить его мораль ниже 40-35%, на что порой (у городов 5-го уровня) может уходить по паре часов (с учётом всех заходов, ведь за раз вряд ли получится).
[*]Боёвка. Это край. Мы можем лишь 3 штуки: 1) ходить, 2) применять активные абилки и 3) выбирать врага целью для активной абилки. Всё. Видите проблему? Правильно, в игре нет клавиши атаки. Мы можем лишь приказать нашему чучелу идти в указанную сторону и оно там (только на конкретной линии) будет автоматически бить все дома и врагов. Вот только рейндж атаки у него микроскопический и для атаки он должен буквально залезть во врага. На третьем ранге абилок у монстра, конечно, появится пассивное умение ломать окружение простой ходьбой, но ещё дожить надо.
[*]Враги ужасны. Начиная от быстрых внедорожников и танков, заканчивая лазерным гoвном и бомбардировщиками. Враги все очень быстрые, легко маневрируют меж домов и, что самое главное, наносят огромный урон. И только ты наращиваешь урон, чтобы быстро убивать внедорожники и лёгкие танки, как игра начинает спавнить тяжёлые танки и цистерны с кислотой. Когда игра решает, что настала пора лазеров, то кидает на вашего монстра лазерные танки, лазерные турели, лазерные истребители и сверхтяжёлые лазерные танки-бегемоты. Прикольно, вот только несколько лазерных атак за пару секунд снимают нашему монстру около трети здоровья. И они не могут промахиваться. Да, есть абилки на игнор некоторых атак, но они работают секунд 10 и сидят на кулдауне секунд 40. Вкупе со всем вышеназванным один заход в высокоуровневый город может закончиться через 8 секунд, потому что на вас напал десяток лазерных истребителей.
[*]Активные абилки в большинстве своём являются мусором. Их много, отличаются они слабо, их эффективность метается от фуфла, которое не может уничтожить даже лёгкий танк до ракетных залпов, снимающих боссам по половине хелсбара. Каждую абилку надо изучать не только за ресурсы, но и за время. И если за это время вас вынудили сражаться с патрульным отрядом, то весь прогресс изучения оборвётся без возможности восстановления.
[*]Идиотские ачивки. Тут вам и накопи 1 миллиард (оставил 1 город, прокрутил несколько месяцев, набрал менее 400 миллионов, за месяц получал 9 миллионов), и захвати Париж 10 раз (т.е. пройти игру 10 раз, т.к. города не ""раззахватываются"" обратно), и уничтожить 10 очень редких фабрик за одного конкретного монстра, и совершить 100 стелс-атак (у меня за всё прохождение получилось аж 8 раз). Пфе.
[/list]
Эта игра ужасна. Первые час-два от неё можно получать удовольствие. Но мой вам совет: оформите возврат средств, как только игра начнёт наскучивать, ибо дальше будет только уныние, скука, гринд, постоянный отступления и грызня с надоедливым флотами вторжения. Не советую ни при каких условиях.

Anderseits ist es Schade, dass man dann doch nicht mehr und noch komplexere Aspekte mit rein baute.
Das ist die Kurzfassung.

Etwas ausfühlicher.
Es ist ein sehr ungewöhliches Strategiespiel. Ziel ist es natürlich die Weltherrschaft zu übernehmen und zwar als verrückter Wissenschaftler (Evil Genius), der  (wie solls anders sein) auf einer geheimen Insel ein Kaiju (Riesenmonster) erschaffen hat mit dem er Terrorangriffe auf Grossstädte der zivilisierten Welt startet.
Bei der Zerstörung sammelt das Monster fleissig Resourcen ein, mit denen es auf die Insel zurück kehrt. So kann man mit der Beute Stück für Stück seine Insel ausbauen und das Kaiju optimieren. Nach einigen Angriffen steigt der Zorn der Weltbevölkerung und das Militär der Nationen fängt an Städte zu schützen und das Kaiju anzugreifen.
Je nachdem wie gross und wichtig eine Stadt ist desto schwieriger und gefährlicher sind die Garnisonen dort. Zudem können Einheiten auch das Kaiju abfangen. Anfangs ist deshalb alles recht leicht, aber man stellt schnell fest, dass man sein Kaiju ständig verbessern und neu modifieren muss damit es neue Beutezüge überlebt.
Gelingt es einem Kaiju eine Stadt fast komplett in Schutt und Asche zu legen, kann die Stadt kapitulieren und man bekommt monatliche Zuwengungen als Tribut. 
Ab wann man das Spiel komplett gewinnt, wieviel man dafür erobern muss weiss ich nicht. Soweit bin ich noch nicht gekommen.
Jedenfalls werden neue Mods am Monster immer teurer was dazu führt, dass man das Kaiju auf immer gewagtere Beutezüge schicken muss um mehr Resourcen zu erbeuten.
Sehr wahrscheinlich kann das Militär auch die geheime Insel angreifen, da man auf der Insel auch Verteidigungsanlagen bauen kann.
Es gibt leider nur drei verschiedene Kaiju. Einen Supergorilla (King Kong Ähnlichkeit) ein riesiges Planteagewächs. ein riesiger Kampfroboter (mit Ähnlichkeiten zu Gozilla). Es gibt dann noch ein DLC mit einem neuen Monster (was ich aber nicht habe)
Es gibt noch weitere DLCs die aber alle unnötig sind da es nur alternative Skins für die Kaiju sind.

Kommen wir nun zur sozial gesellschaftlichen Kritik.
Zwar ist das Böse mal wieder ein abstrakter durchgeknaller Einzelgänger, doch wie bei Evil Genius ist man diese Unperson selbst. Was es einem wiederum leichter  macht die Absurdität der Stigmatisierung zu erkennen mit der die westliche Kultur eben alles Schlechte dieser Erde erklären möchte.
Zudem findet Eroberung nicht auf eine rein militärische Art statt, sondern durch Terror gegen die Zivilbevölkerung, Reduzierung von Zivilisten fürht gleichzeitig zur Resignation und somit zur Kapitulationen. Man will ja auch heute feindliche Länder nicht mehr militärisch einnehmen sondern durch Umsturz innhalb der Zivilbevölkerung.
Die Kaiju spilen dabei die Rolle der Massenvernichtung. Der mechanische Gozilla, steht für die zukünftige Drohnen und voll mechanisierte Kriegsführung (Drohnen die sich auf Menschen stürzen, roboterähnliche Tötungsmaschinen und Cyborgs) . Der mutierte King Kong steht eher für die biochemische Manipulation, dem genetisch optimierten Soldaten. Und zuletzt die Riesenpflanze steht für die biologische Kriegsführung mit Bakterien und Killerviren.
Egal, jeder zukünftige Waffe wirkt wie ein Kaiju, zum Terror gegen die Zivilisation, diese zu dezimieren und den Rest neu auszurichten und gefügig zu machen.
Von diesem Gesichtspunkt aus versteht man dann, man spielt hier nicht etwa einen verrückten Soziopathen der die Welt bedroht, man spielt den militärisch industriellen Komplex, der sich ja immer mehr von der Zivilbevölkerung der Erde loslöst und eingene Ziele und Weltanschauungen gegen die Zivilisation durchsetzen will, quasi die Zivilisten vor den Zivilisten zu schützen.
Ich halte daher das Spiel aus sozial gesellschaftlicher Sicht für wertvoll.

Auch aus rein spielerischer Sicht ist es zu empfehlen. Trotz seiner Schwächen.
Die da wären, 
- dass man zu wenig Inhalt mit rein gepackt hat mit dem man die Kaiju hätte noch individueller machen können 
- dass man nutzlose bis lächerlich kleine DLCs herausgibt, anstatt mehr Gameplay zu bieten
- dass die Steuerung das Kaiju etwas ungenau ist
- dass die Beutzeroberfälche etwas unübersichtlich ist und wirr erscheint.

Denn das Spiel hat vor allem im strategischem Bereich Stärken.
- Fehler werden kaum verziehen.
- Beutezüge und Terrorangriffe müssen wohl überlegt sein
- Auch der Ausbau der Insel muss überlegt sein
- Bebauungstyp von Städten spielt eine Rolle, mit welchen Attributen ich mein Kaiju ausstatten soll.
- und auch die militärischen Einheiten verhalten sich je nach Typ und Garnison anders.
- Feindeinheiten verhalten sich teilweise clever, vor allem mit stärkeren Garnisonen

Alles in allem ist das Spiel daher zu empfehlen, für Freunde der ungewöhnlichen Strategie.  Unschlüssige sollten einen Sale abwarten. Für unter 5 € macht man ganz bestimmt nichts falsch.

Ich liebe das Spiel dafür was es sein könnte. Es macht einfach Spaß als Godzilla like Monster Tokyo zu zerstören.
Das Problem ist das sich die Steuerung sehr schwammig anfühlt und man das gefühl hat seinm Monster braucht ewig bis es auf eingaben reagiert... und machmal reagiert es sofort (okay ich weiß es liegt daran dass das Monster gerade eine andere Aktion ausführt aber manche lassen sich abbrechen und andere nicht.. und oft bricht man eine Aktion ab die man nicht abbrechen will)
Das Managment seiner ""Böser Wissenschaftler Insel"" ist zweckmäßig und eher nervig als sinnvoll... Ganz nett aber in dem rudimentären Umfang eher lästig auf lange sicht und nicht berreichernd. Besonders weil man eher bestraft wird wenn man eine Stadt in einem Angriff einimmt. Denn es gibt lila Meteor Teile und man kann immer nur eine bestimmte Anzahl mitnehmen aus einer Stadt. Und man braucht diese um sein Monster aufzuwerten... und wenn man allle Aufwertungen (von denen der großteil nutzlos ist und nicht mehr variation reinbringt) haben will dann muss man sich disziplinieren ^^
Die Grafik würde ich als zweckmäßig bezeichnen... nicht schön aber auch nicht hässlich... einfach Mittelmaß.
Der schwierigkeitsgad ist auch unausgegoren... Am Anfang zu schwer, besonders wenn man nicht weiß wie man es spielen soll (es gibt keine Einführung), und am Ende zu einfach.

Daß hört sich alles sehr negativ an aber im großen und ganzen hat mir das Spiel SPaß gemacht und deshalb der Daumen nach oben. Wäre alles rudimentärer oder weiter ausgefeilt gewesen hätte es mir wesentlich mehr Spaß gemacht.
So hockt dieses Spiel mehr auf der positiven Seite von mittelmäßig.  Das Spiel macht Spaß aber man merkt ihm heftig an das es hätte wesentlich besser sein können.

Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library

TLDR: Outcompeted by Brigador. The core gameplay takes too much inspiration from a freetowait. Imprecise clicker cooldown ability gameplay.
 
Simple clicker game where you send kaiju on overland map of the globe with urban centers pointed as capturable. You do your base management off an island in the middle of nowhere and grind ressources. You perform upgrades, eventually you can go on to take over the world. Simple setup. Obeys simple point and click interface once you get used to the click and hold to drag screen. Feels almost tablet-like but is a fun change from the hercules type games or farming themed nonsense.

Second half of game is clicking on houses and leveling gas stations and squashing civilians and little trooper guys. Vehicles are fast and therefore annoying. Always keep the way to the extraction (anywhere to edge of map) in mind and extract kaiju for repairs and return the pillage.

In the end you can play cat and mouse for a few hours and give up or saddle for the long ride, but you experience diminishing returns as the game becomes repetitive and new upgrades are further away. You would be better off just playing Brigador instead since it gives score for destroying cities, you operate an oversized mech, you get Xbox360 pad support, nicer enginer, and fighting back against the town is more engaging.

While I keep playing it, more out of stubborn determination than enjoyment, the game progresses by getting TEDIOUS and frustratingly more difficult while offering next to no reward for the player.  Half-baked I can't help but imagine how good this game COULD have been; if the monster was reasonable to control, there were any kind of customizations, destroying a major city was fun, the world would actually run out of stealth bombers, I COULD have loved this game.  But instead it is just fucking boring.   BORING.   

I play a game like this because I want to have fun and destroy cities and take over the world.  NOT to endlessly ""fight"" an infinite supply of shitty tanks and planes over and over and over and over and over again.

Still, imagine if this game combined with Sim City and Mechwarrior... where the cities arent just awful grids of generic buildings, but actual recreations of the cities as they are known, and you can design and custom build and then ACTUALLY CONTROL your monster from various POV, and wreak havoc, you know, for fun and enjoyment.   Where a sense of... dare I say, realism, would actually improve the experience.    I fantasize.

I was always excited to finish another round of training but holy moly the actual gameplay / capturing cities is an exercise in frustration that spoils it for me.   There's a lot to like but the number of times I could ruin a city enough that it should capitulate but found my kaiju with too little health to really look around for that last objective needed to trigger the city's surrender.

And that's the worst part, there's no way to check progress towards beating a city except the City's Morale.  Once it's low enough the city may surrender, but it always felt like i had missed some arbitrary objective.  One more tank kill, or one more unique building, or military base, or attack helicopter.  But there's no way to figure it out and in the early game (years 1-2) i could never count on having enough health to be able to find it.  It was either leave and have to slog through it again on a return trip or try desperately to get to that last Blue-ringed building in the middle of the city now-full of defenders.

So frustrating.  After the 4th time exclaiming ""dang it, that's not fun!"" i give up.  Let buildings crumble in a single swipe so my path of destruction doesn't feel like a slog, and work on the also-frustrating and arbitrary crash-to-desktop issues and I would *love* to give this another shot and my recomendation, but as-is the fun doesn't last long enough to justify the frustration.

Would you like Brigador with more grind, crashes galor, no support, a paid DLC monster with abilities that crash the game? Congrats, here you go!

Concept wise, this game is cool. In fact I like it a bit more than other games by the company. The RPG aspects, while grindy are pretty neat. The monsters are diverse and each play's very differently. As you conquer cities, you start to feel like a serious threat, as you gain abilities that destroy whole city blocks, the kaiju defense force employs more and more desperate attempts to stop you, and you start to need to worry about defending your secret lair. However a few pretty major problems hold this game back.

Later on, even on good computer's the game has performance issues when attacking some of the bigger cities. These range from slowdowns, to even just outright crashing.

This game is also filled with bugs that never seem to get fixed. Some of the bugs are pretty major. The paid DLC monster is largely non-funtional as it's abilities cause the game to crash to desktop. These are issues that should have been noticed and fixed before launch. It shouldn't even be in the store in that state. There's also a bug where if you delete the first training facility you make after making the next tier of training facility, you literally can't train any skills or build a new training facility until you get rid of all tiers of training facilities you already built and then rebuild them sequentially. I reported that bug months before support for this game dropped, and it is still there, despite being a pretty major bug that can ruin a playthrough.

Finally, this is a pretty minor nitpick but the game just feels like it was intended to be a lot more. Some ingame text seems to indicate that the mad scientists are all trying to conquer the world at the same time, but you never run into any competition. The only opposition you face, is the city defense, and some easily crushed KDF patrols. This causes the game to get really repetitive fast. The game also has the same type of geoscape map as XCOM, but the only thing you ever deal with is moving your kaiju around. You never get another kaiju, or the ability to get a second evil lair. There is no KDF construction facilities or anything to find. It's just more of the same, and leaves the player feeling like some major feature was cut from the final product that was supposed to be in there.

Unforunately, a very similar game called Brigador is now out, which largely has the same gameplay as this, but with continuing support and no game breaking bugs. If the devs came back and fixed the crash issues, then I think this game could compete, but for now, it falls short.",1496889912,1496889912,False,9,0,0.593293905258178711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In that respect, I have to say that this is one of the best games I've ever bought for that much. I often buy cheap sub $1 games if they look even remotely interesting, and more often than not, I'm met with expected disappointment. I'm never too worried, as I tend to buy these games with money earned from selling trading cards, but occasionally, I come across a real gem.
This game is one of them! 
Having read other reviews on here, I expected this to be buggy and crash a lot, but I don't think I experienced a single crash in all my time playing so far. (13.6 hrs at present - I just finished conquering the world for the first time.)
The only bug I came across in the whole time I was playing, was when upon returning to a city I had attempted to conquer before, it was showing the graphics for buildings which I'd previously destroyed, when they weren't actually there. (They can  rebuild them with time)  As a result, my monster was stomping around, shooting missiles at areas and such, and was doing no damage. It wasn't til I moved to a different side of the map that I realized what was happening. 
Considering that's the only bug I've come across though, I'm fine with that. 
Over all the game has been a great casual romp that I can play for 10 mins here and there, and the tech tree of skills for your monster is huge! 
I'm not sure that I would recommend it at the price of $14, but if you can get it for $5 or less, don't hesitate! It's a very odd game, yet so strangely satisfying once you get the gist of what you're supposed to do :) 
I was surprised to see that it supported 3840x2160 resolution too! A lot of these sort of games don't support resolutions that high unless you hack it in yourself via an ini file or something, so that was a real bonus for me too! 
I finished it with Ginormasaurus, and I think I will actually go back and play it as the default plant creature now as well, partly just due to the fun, and partly to see what abilities await within its tech tree!",1494041958,1494042165,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Unlock new abilities! How do they actually work? What's the base value of the thing it'll add 10% to? How does detection work and is -10 to it a noticeable change? Who knows?

Euer Monster entspringt dabei einem verrückten Wissenschaftler der auf einer Insel im Atlantik eine geheime Forschungs-Basis hat. Zu dieser Insel lasst ihr euer Monster immer wieder zurückkehren,wenn zum einen eure Lebensenergie zugrunde geht oder ihr eurem Monster Neues beibringen wollt. Dabei lässt sich die Basis noch weiter ausbauen. Mit dem zerstören der Städte sammelt ihr mit eurem Monster Ressourcen ein die sich dann dementsprechend verwenden lassen.
Der Ablauf beim zerstören der Stadt erfolgt einfach mit Mausklick in die jeweilige Richtung die das Monster einschlagen soll.Alles im Weg befindliche zerstört eure Kreatur selbstständig. Umso länger ihr eurem Zerstörungswahn auslebt umso höher steigt auch die Alarmbereitschaft der dort lebenden Menschen.Demnach dauert es auch nicht sehr lange bis ihr ein riesen Militäraufgebot um euch habt,welches euch mit Raketen und Maschinengewehren beharkt.

What makes it work is that it possesses that undeniable ""fun factor"" that keeps you coming back despite those flaws. The strategy layer plays like a single-base xcom while the tactical layer (city stomping) plays out like an  ARPG. The city stomping starts out as really fun, descends into monotony as you realize how everything works, and then becomes extremely satisfying once you get the truly fun kaiju abilities later in the game. 

On that note, watching entire city blocks being decimated by fiery/nuclear/.etc destruction just doesn't seem to get old, especially if you've been to the cities you're destroying; that is to say, the cities are modeled extremely well after their real life counterparts. The myriad of ways each Kaiju can accomplish this destruction keeps me coming back and replaying the game.

Regarding the ARPG-like gameplay, your kaiju is given 5 to 7 ability slots for you to populate. These abilities range from completely worthless to outright broken (read: extremely fun to abuse). The abilities themselves are broken up into three categories: attack, defense, and metabolism (utility). Of these, some are passive and always on whether assigned or not. Unlocking these abilities is accomplished via ""training"" in the strategic layer and is addictive in its own right as you manage your evil lair so as to provide your Kaiju with said training. 

The Kaiju Defense Force is your cpu opponent in the game and, in addition to defending the cities you trash, sets up patrols in order to discover your evil lair. This is where a surprisingly fun addition to the game can be found for those who can get through the initial doldrums of a Kaiju with only a few abilities to arrive at mid-game: evil lair defense. In addition to outfitting your evil lair with production facilities intended to help fund your Kaiju training and development, you can setup defenses to decimate any invaders to your secret base once discovered. Despite the extremely simple nature of these invasions when they occur, they are deeply satisfying to watch when your defenses obliterate the invaders without any need for your Kaiju to intervene.

As far as flaws go, the KDF attacks come out of nowhere in city defense; they'll spawn right on top of you, next to you, or on the other side of the city seemingly randomly. In easier cities, they'll do this rather slowly, but in more advanced cities, they tend to do this quickly and at once. What this means is that, instead of fighting an organized defense, you're typically picking them off one at a time until harder cities. This isn't nearly as satisfying as breaking a well organized looking army and watching them flee.

This problem is exasperated in the later cities when the city defenses spawn very quickly and often right next to your kaiju. The differences between KDF tiers (organized by defcon levels from easisest 5 to hardest 1) are very stark; what is laughably easy for your Kaiju to deal with at defcon 4 is overwhelmingly deadly at defcon 3. Certain Kaiju's have an easier time dealing with this rampup than others, but the difficulty isn't linear at all between tiers and you'll find yourself playing ""ninja"" hit and run with your kaiju instead of demolishing city defenses until you can get the right abilities to make everything trivial again. Once you come to terms with this, however, the game becomes deeply satisfying again as you realize what military units you can overwhelm and what you have to run away from.",1482013995,1482013995,True,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I played several early kaiju - those released before the dlc that should have been functional, and found a very, very long list of problems with each - aside from the bug/issue/problem list in the game itself. 

This game was obviously not beta tested, or possibly not played by the developer at all.  Several powers for mulitple kaiju do not work at all, descriptions are incomplete, wrong, or unclear in almost every single case.  The fact that many of these problems are apparently easy to fix only makes the matter worse, because there is little evidence that the developer cares beyond doing what was needed to sell a dlc.

Be aware that the game also frequently crashes near the endgame, though the game is finishable with a bit of a struggle.

Given the state of the original product at the time they released a dlc, not only do I not recommend buying KAGG at this time, even on sale, but I recommend avoiding the developer until they have satisfactorily addressed the games issues.

トレイラーから受けるであろう印象とは裏腹に、ただ勢いに任せて力を振るうだけではあっさり返り討ち。大暴れするためには怪獣のスキルトレーニング、それに必要な資源の略奪と生産をできるだけ効率的に行わなければなりません。本作には４段階の難易度設定が用意されていますが、高難易度に挑戦するならどのスキルが強力なのかを把握しておくことが必要不可欠。そのような点で知識の比重が大きいゲームデザインになっていると言えます。準備戦略が実を結び、怪獣が成長すれば、トレイラー以上の大破壊を引き起こすこともできます、ゴ○ラも真っ青！

As it was mentioned in his excellent review, this is a revamped version of Crush, Crumble & Chomp by the the wonderful EPYX (more famous for their sublime 'games' series and Impossible Mission among many memorable others) from the halcyon days of the (still) great C64.

I'm enjoying this game very much as well as the additional humour and impressive tactical depth that they have introduced to the initial games concept. Thank you for this Kerberos Productions Inc..

It almost brought a tear to my eye that a current developer has remade this and that fellow Steam reviewers like =7Cav=RCT.Pickle.A are still knowledgeable enough to recognise the influence/heritage.

If like me you grew up playing games initially on a 1970's Tandy, the various Atari or Nintendo systems and then were lucky enough to have had everything from the Spectrum 48k, C64, Amiga's, ST's, PC's, Megadrive/Genesis, Snes, N64, Playstation etc etc through to the big beasts of today and quite literally everything in between (including Orics and the dead at birth systems like the Jaguar et al) then you will know the warm glow that this game brings.

To play this on my state of the art gaming rigs must seem anathema to newer gamers but to retro gamers like me this is a thing of beauty.

There is such a rich vein of what is now termed as 'retro' games to reinvent for the current gamer that it seems ridiculous and almost selfish not to do exactly that.

It's personally a wonderful thing for me to have lived long enough from the early days of gaming in order to be able to play the bleeding edge games of today but to see the indie and 'bedroom coders' making a resurgence alongside them in this amazing time for gaming is equally important.

Kudos to you Kerberos.

I have played through with Shrubby and Armagordon and have had a good time doing so.  If you liked King of the Monsters and/or Rampage, then this is worth a look.

This game has more depth than I originally anticipated.  You can't just run around willy-nilly attacking everyone and everything or the regions of the world will unite/focus on hunting you down and destroying you.  In the beginning, there is a lot of hit-n-run while you build up your base and your monster.  The later game is all about conquering the cities so you have the monthly income to sustain your growing secret base.

+Each monster has 102 skills (3 branches * 34 skills in each branch) which offers a lot of variety in your build.  The three monsters play very differently.  It is fun smashing the cities and landmarks of the world with a giant monster.

-I have encountered many achievement bugs (mostly with DLC monster achievements) and a few random crashes.  Nothing game-breaking, but they are annoying.  Also, there is a lack of information in-game regarding skills.

I would LOVE to see more skill information in the game before you spend the time and effort training (really my largest complaint).  Give me some kind of test area I can build on the secret base!

The destruction process is the most fun and it's very satisfying swatting a helicopter down and watching the crash cause fires!

If I had anything negative to say, its  that the lack of instructions can be pesky for your first time playing through.  I got  confused by sidebar icons that I thought referred to the city but where actually about my kaiju!

The concept of this game is really great , and I got so excited by the demo video that I didn't even bother to check that the game does not support a controller. I would have been a big hint for what I consider to be the game worst problem: the battle system.

The battles are extremely disapointing , as all you do is click on the direction you want your Kaiju to go , and it automatically destroys everything on its path to the way point. 

There are ranged skills that you can trigger during the battle , but they are not fun to use either. You get attacked by many different units and have the option to target then so that everytime you hit a the skill button ( they have coldowns and / or consume resources ) it is fired on them. However , small units tend to move fast so whatever you fire goes to the direction the unit WAS and usually misses. Try to reach it with you Kaiju and you might have both trouble clicking on the small enemy moving fast behind high buildings, and have the Kaiju actually reaching it. When it finally does, it will have received serious damage. 

Then you return with you damaged or destroyed Kaiju to your base and speed up time until it gets repaired. And you start a new attack on the same city or a another one. It is always the same. Even with upgradeable skills and different scenerios and enemies the dynamic is the very same. Walk a little bit over the city with the monster destroying things automatically and getting damaged by enemies and then leave.

Other than the battles there is a resource management / building part whose interface is not intuitive or easy to use in my opinion. Eventually I gave up with over little 5 hours of gaming,",1460359008,1460359008,False,9,0,0.644003331661224365,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Auch ist der Verbrauch an Satelliten und Transportraketen eindeutig zu hoch für den Preis. Vernichten sich die Satelliten nach dem einmaligen Senden selbst, oder wie? Transporter kosten Geld wenn ich sie nicht benutze, aber wenn ich sie benutze bleiben sie in der Stadt liegen. Auch wenn mir die Stadt hinterher gehört. Selbst ein böses Genie sollte an Recycling denken. Grade wenn man so doll auf seine Ressources achten muss wie hier. 

Erste Runde mit Scrubby. Angriff zwar überlebt, aber keine Lust, die 3 Gebäude und Wände nachzubauen. Wenn wir eh schon dabei sind so mit Material rumaasen, kann ich auch alles aufgeben und neu anfangen.
Jetzt noch mal mit Gino... Gonor... Gironimo... ...mit dem G-saurus angefangen. Läuft bisher ganz smooth.

Die Skins sind leider scheinbar nur skins und völlig nutzlos. Kostet nur unnötig Ressourcen eine Fabric fürs Umrüsten zu bauen.

Nachtrag: 
Nachdem das Game mal wieder einfach trotzig abgestürzt ist, als es grade mal wieder ZU gut für mich lief (Tokyo hätte ich in dieser Runde komplett platt gemacht) habe ich (ebenfalls als Trotzreaktion) den Daumen nach unten geändert.

The gameplay is fun and straight forward: take your monster out to destroy and conquer cities, regions, and eventually the world! Repel and destroy the forces of the world as they organize against you. Accomplishing your goals will require resource gathering, base building, and researching skills to upgrade your monster. 

While the game is fun, it is pretty difficult, brutal even. Don't expect to beat normal difficulty right out of the gate- this is one of those games you will want to try easy mode first. Sad as it is, you can expect some bugs now and then as well, the worst of which can be when the game crashes and your last save is pretty old. Make sure to save often.

Kaiju-A-GoGo is an action strategy game made by Kerberos Productions (Sword of the Stars: The Pit). As the name suggests, the game revolves around controlling your own kaiju that will help you, the mad scientist, to get the control over the whole planet Earth.

The game has off-battle management similar to XCOM series or Xenonauts, as you'll see the world map and everything you do doesn't cost just obvious resources like money, but it also takes some time. The secret base management (well, from graphics point of view, the whole game) looks like a SimCity clone that was made to be a Facebook game.

But let's talk about the main part: Action and destruction caused by your epic kaiju! Well, don't get your hopes up high, it's boring. You'll mark where should your kaiju go and it will destroy anything in the way. Meanwhile, you'll be using classic kaiju skills that 9 of 10 Godzillas would approve, like laser eye beams. If you keep up with playing, you'll see a solid amount of skills in talent trees that every kaiju have.

This could have been a dream of every kaiju movies fan but it ends up being mediocre game that requires you to have nerves to success with your late invasions. It promises a good amount of playtime but I wonder how many people even gets to the end of the game. If they can beat the higher difficulty, there's the whole dullness in the gameplay, as it gets boring to keep marking ""go there, destroy everything"" for hours, while trying to survive attacks of human army units.",1456580651,1466838047,False,26,3,0.654442846775054932,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is even worse for air units where you have to move just right to take a swing.  These control options are coupled with lack of explanations.

You get to build a base in this game.  The downside is buildings like everything else have little explanation.  Those that do reveal how grindy the game gets. The further you get into the game and the stronger the building, the longer it takes to build it.  Later buildings can take 45+ days to create, which means sitting for over a minute as your little building bar rises.  Even better is how with each series of buildings the amount of resources needs jumps violently upwards.  It leads to months of grindign just for needed resources, this is especially true for research as the second building costs so much research it doesn't even pay for itself for 2 months. The tier 3 god research building? Welp sorry boys and girls it costs 1500 research and only makes 550, hope you liked wating 3 months to get any value from it!

Dans ce jeu solo au concept atypique, vous incarnez un savant fou envoyant sa créature géante (3 au choix, avec des gameplay différents) détruire des villes immenses afin de vous approprier leur argent et leurs ressources.

Au fur et à mesure votre créature deviendra encore plus résistante et mortelle à l'aide de compétences actives et passives (avec un sacré arbre de compétences), et deviendra plus imposante (détruisant simplement en marchant dessus des bâtiments de plus en plus gros).

Si vous faites suffisamment de dégâts (et surtout de victimes) et que le moral d'une ville descend en dessous d'un certain seuil la ville se rend, et vous aurez une rentrée d'argent régulière. (plus amusant que les satellites de X-com, non ? )

Le revers de la médaille, c'est que les villes se défendront de mieux en mieux les jours passant : le jeu devient de plus en plus difficile, et vous vous retrouverez face à des défenses de plus en plus élaborées (tourelles, chars de divers types, bombardements avec dommages collatéraux qui font plaisir, lasers, missiles, et même d'autres kaijus ...)
De plus il y aura des patrouilles sur la carte du monde qu'il faudra affronter (ou fuir) si ils ont le malheur d'être sur votre trajectoire.

Il faudra donc de plus en plus faire attention, et ne pas se fier au début du jeu qui est assez facile (peu de compétences et de résistance) car par la suite il faudra anticiper son trajet et garder un oeil sur les renforts ennemis : se prendre une volée de missiles fait très mal !

Il y a aussi une partie de gestion de base assez sympathique. Il est possible de construire des bâtiments générant des ressources ou divers avantages comme du soin, l’entraînement du kaiju, menacer des villes ... Plus tard dans le jeu votre base se fera même attaquer à votre tour ! On inverse ici les rôles, et c'est une excellente idée en plus d'être cohérent.

Donc voilà, un concept génial rondement mené. Il a eu une bonne note dans CPC, ce qui m'avait convaincu de l'acheter vu le concept ... ravageur
Lorsque je parle de ce jeu, pour plaisanter je parle d'un ""sim-city inversé"", vu qu'on casse toutes ces belles villes J'espère avoir convaincu quelques joueurs indécis. 


[b]voici quelques conseils en vrac, les guides pour ce jeu étant trop rares :[/b]

- les bâtiments uniques sont visibles en bleu (ils apportent pas mal de ressources dont la ressource rare du jeu)
- on peut mettre le jeu en pause avec espace (utile pour planifier son trajet tranquillou, surtout si on n'a pas encore les moyens de prendre le contrôle d'une ville)
- le clic droit permet de cibler une unité ennemie (la compétence utilisée ensuite est censée le viser)
- lorsque la santé de son kaiju est basse c'est une bonne idée de rester en relative sécurité au bord de la carte de la ville attaquée : vous vous ferez attaquer par moins d'angles et surtout il sera possible de fuir à tout moment si le besoin s'en fait sentir.
- à noter qu'il existe un mini-pic de difficulté une fois que vous commencez à attaquer les villes en T2, c'est normal : les devs ont volontairement baissé la difficulté au début du jeu pour ne pas décourager les nouveaux et qu'ils aient le temps de s'approprier ses mécaniques.
- le niveau d'alerte d'une ville est de terminé par plusieurs facteurs, entres autres : il aura plus de chances d'être bas la nuit, en cas d'attaque surprise (déplacement plus lent sur la map), ou si vous avez la possibilité de réduire votre ""signature"" avec des compétences passives. Ce niveau augmentera progressivement lorsque vous attaquerez la ville, il ne baissera pas vous incitant parfois à fuir la queue entre les jambes (mais les bras chargés de ressources )
- la fuite est la plupart du temps la meilleure option, car vous conserverez vos ressources et votre réputation. A vous de voir si vous vous sentez capable de prendre le contrôle de cette ville ou que vous vous contenterez de la piller pour le moment ...
- pour qu'une ville se rende il faut de préférence avoir entraîné son kaiju en lui donnant de nouvelles compétences actives/passives, et commencer si possible en niveau d'alerte bas. Le but est de réduire le moral à 40 ou moins : à partir de là la ville peut se rendre à chaque baisse supplémentaire de son moral. Tuer des civils est un must pour ce faire. Il y a davantage de population dans les zones résidentielles (et les bâtiments y sont plus petits et moins résistants qu'au centre ville)
- il est à un certain stade du jeu possible de menacer une ville, qui répondra plus favorablement à vos demandes suivant votre réputation
- il existe différents type de ressources, certaines étant nécessaires pour activer vos pouvoirs, et toutes servant à construire de nouveaux bâtiments. Leur répartition est logique :

    la nourriture se trouve dans les habitations (miam) et les commerces
    l'énergie principalement dans les centrales
    l'argent dans les containers, commerces et surtout les banques (bien cachées et assez petites généralement)
    la connaissance dans les universités / tours de bureaux
    la ressource rare du jeu, le purpletonium, se trouve principalement dans les hôpitaux
    si possible toujours détruire les bâtiments uniques : possible drop de purpletonium en plus de nombreuses ressources",1454418906,1454418906,True,5,0,0.605918467044830322,0,True,False,False,False,,,

did i buy a speed run trial and error game??

For perspective, I beat Xcom Terror from the Deep and that is a challenging, but fun game.  I found this game difficulty to be unfair.  Examples of this include spawning in cities surrounded by enemies that force me to run immediately or when in the process of running have numerous enemies spawn around me that drop my health to zero quickly.  I get that enemies need to spawn in the city but having over a dozen laser tanks suddenly appear in my vicinity when I'm trying to exit the map (which can be hard enough, I'll get to that later) is just waste of time when they suddenly kill me.  The controls can be clunky.  I understand this isn't an action game but part of the strategy seems to be clearing lanes and staying near the edge of cities.  I can click on buildings near the edge to destroy and I constantly get prompts to ""Leave city?"".  That's frustrating enough but when I try to run out of the city and click off the map the monster goes wandering parallel to the edge indefinitely (and dies when the spawns appear out of nowhere).   

I am confident I could beat this game, but don't intend to because the randomness/difficulty makes it a grind where I have to return to each city many times to take them.

Plus I'm not on the biggest/final tier cities yet so I'm throwing in the towel and not wasting my time.

It does have some balance issues and other minor quibbles (I feel like there are far too many active abilities for example) but the gameplay is good, the Halloween skins are cool (really enjoying my pumpkin shrubby). The Developers are active on the Steam forums.

Pros:

+ Gameplay is good, it can be a little frustrating trying to get the monster to hit air targets manually but over all it's not difficult to get the hang of, deceptively simple but there is some micromanagement if you want to thrive and a lot of things outside button mashing abilities aren't immediately apparent.

+ Variety of enemies, although some could definitely use balance work.

+ Variety in the layout of cities, for the most part they all feel like unique locations and many of killable recognizable landmarks (""Prump Towers"" comes to mind). Some seem to favor one monster over another (because of how much more of a specific type of resource they have).

Cons:

- High difficulty even on lower settings, part of this stems from the depth of the game coupled with the total absence of an in depth wiki or manual which it desperately needs.

- The clock. I understand why they felt this necessary but some of the time it takes to do things like build/repair after a lost fight are too long. They take too long, though, only because the world doesn't stop moving in the mean time and once your island is discovered by a hunter fleet it's pretty much game over so you're always in a race against time. I wish this could be disabled or toned down considerably at lower difficulty levels and a quick persual of the forums here will show I'm not alone in that.

- I would like to see a wireframe out line of enemy units hidden behind and in between buildings, like most RTS games do. Often you can't see what's hitting you until you're already taking lots of damage.

Neutrals:

* This game is marketed as being ""Casual"" but there is a surprsing amount of depth and it's easy to fuck up and wreck your game. That wouldn't be so bad for a truly casual game but this can happen after 12+ hours in game where the it has the feel of an oldschool arcade coin-op trying to milk you for money or an angry pen and paper gamemaster hell bent on murdering your favorite character.

* At the time of this writing there 3 playable characters. Given how much stuff are in the various tech trees and that they all play differently I can see why there are so few but it seems like the developers are still working on more to release which more variety would be appreciated.",1450266965,1450266965,True,11,1,0.620381414890289307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My boyhood dreams have come true.  Everything on the maps can be leveled. You really feel like you are leading a giant walking monster of destruction on a path of apocalyptic fury. The vine whips feel brutal and the eye lasers have that aw inspiring annihilation.  Oh and the Kaiju themselves, there are 3 for right now, each one feels really unique and different, they arent simply reskined (more are likely to come). The Replayability is very high because of this. Its just .... FUN. 

A simple Breakdown:
PROS
     * Fully levelable Maps
     * Teired growth of your Kaiju (with cities to match each teir)
     * A Varity of Kaiju that each have their own playstyle (mostlikely more as DLC in the future!)
     * Unique quaint art style that looks beutiful while you crush hopes and dreams
     * Lots of enemy unit types
     * Base Building!
CONS
     *  *slighty* buggy, occasionally my game crashes when loading a city map, however, the autosave always saves me. 
     *  Balance, the game is still relatively new, the Enemy Base Attacks are a bit OP, and need to be reworked
     * occasionally city leveling feels grindy, however, the game difficulty adjustment and city teirs help with that.
     *  the game doesnt feel fully fleshed out yet, Base construction choices are a bit limited, the defenses build costs are too high.

I also have to question just how fair the game is to the player when your secret base is eventually discovered and attacked. Even when cheating in an attempt to squeeze more replayability from this game (by giving myself infinite resources) I was shocked to find my top-tier base defences completely overwhelmed at the first sign of trouble. 

And unless you're saving regularly and have a point to go back to before your base was discovered: loss of base = game over. Start the arduous process of attacking and researching all over again. Only this time you will see the grind coming.

The controls are incredibly janky, NO MONSTER DON'T SQUISH THAT, RUN THERE!, as is the time accelerate feature, which will force you to increase the speed of time every time an insignificant building is created. This may not sound like an issue. But after your 100th wall piece is finished building you're pretty sick of having to press the speed up time button just to see the next wall finish.

I suspect that the late-game content of having your base investigated and thrashed is tied entirely to your kaiju's tech level. Which, if it is the case, is really lazy programming. Why not have the response of the civilized world grow proportionate to the amount of damage you do? As the game stands, upsetting one continent is the same as upsetting 5 continents in terms of armed response, so why would you care to focus your attacks?

I totally agree with the people appraising this as a mobile game come to PC. The only thing missing is micro-transactions to speed up the monotony.

After ten minutes I was bored, I wont lie a game can bore me quite easily but I guess my expectations of this made me think it was going to be better at this stage in development.

After 12 minutes I shut the game down and deleted it thinking I would come back to it after it is finished (as i assumed it was still in early access) Only to find it had in fact already been released. with the content and gameplay as it is, I think the game should be marked as Early Access still as it just doesn't feel like a full game to me.

破壊した街から資材を奪い、怪獣を改造し、はたまた悪の秘密基地も要塞化し地球防衛軍から守りぬけ！とディフェンス要素もあったり・・・
簡単に言うと「世界征服するクセしてちまちま侵略するな」って感じのゲーム

怪獣を操って街を破壊するって割に大分トロトロと侵略するので、「怪獣を使って世界征服！」と意気揚々思ってプレイするとやってられません。
初期の怪獣の性能はメチャクチャ悪いです、動きも遅く街を移動するのにも時間がかかり、そのうえ攻撃力も低いので行く手を阻む建物を破壊するにも時間がかかり面倒にかなり感じます。
もちろん街を破壊すると敵、ここで言う「防衛軍」がやってきますが、これも的が小さく動きが早いのでターゲットするのに苦労します、そのうえ建物の間をランダムに縫うように動き、建物を重なると狙うことすら出来ません。
そして上にも書いたように技の威力も低いので、序盤から敵を倒すのも一苦労。そしてターゲッティングも悪く、なかなか敵にあたってくれません。戦車だよ戦車！なんで建物狙ってんだよ！

シム要素、タワーディフェンスもありますが、これのせいでかなりチマチマと侵略しないといけない面倒なシステムになっています。
街を侵略し、破壊すると資材をゲット出来るのですが、到底ここだけで手に入る資材だけではやりくり出来ず、秘密基地に発電所やら研究所やら建てないと足りません。そのくせ維持費まで取る。踏み倒せよ悪の科学者！
序盤から考えて秘密基地を改造していかないと中盤に差し掛かる前に詰むことになります。秘密基地防衛戦は敵が強く数も多い上に、秘密基地の施設は防衛不可能、怪獣も操って防衛するのですが怪獣の攻撃で壊れる方が多いくらいでどうしようもありません。

そしてなにより気に入らないのは「いつまでも怪獣が弱い！」
怪獣は改造して強くなるのですが、基本的にステータスは全くイジれず、技・スキルの付け替えだけで戦わなければならないのですが、弱い！弱すぎる！
序盤はどれも使い勝手が悪い上に怪獣のHPは低いので、ちょっとやられたらすぐ逃げ帰って来ないと行けないのがイライラ！
中盤になってHPアップや電磁シールド、広範囲にダメージを与えれるスキルがてにはいりますが、その頃には防衛軍がそれを上回る物量と攻撃力で必滅です。悪の科学者が防衛軍の開発力下回ってんじゃねーぞ・・・

と言っても終盤になれば、怪獣は一撃で街を火の海に変えるほどの火力を持ち、モニター一面真っ赤になる様はかなり爽快です・・・ですが、そこまでの道のりはかなり遠く最初から怪獣で暴れ回りたいと思ってる方には全くオススメ出来ません。",1434945648,1434945648,False,16,1,0.604105472564697266,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1) There are some glitches, a few maps have terraquatic battleships for instance.
2) It can be a little bit difficult to auto target aircraft.

That's it. Seriously, that's all I can complain about. The first thing is actually hilarious to watch in action, and the second is easily solved by manually right clicking on an enemy and using an ability.

So the good stuff: This game is hilarious. You get to play a Kaiju, an enormous mechanical Godzilla-like robot with lazer eyes, fire breath and a whole slew of abilities to lay waste to all in your path. There are some strategical points to consider (which makes the game fun and adds a bit of a challenge) such as funding for your base in the form of money, biomatter and research. You can build and customize your base, choosing from facilites to generate power, resaerch and food or to train your Kaiju. 

Attacking the cities of the world is enormously enjoyable, you can destroy famous landmarks (over and over) and fight anything from infantry to lazer tanks and battleships. The longer you stay in a city, the more dangerous it becomes but you might be able to capture it. Captured cities = money so it can be worth the risk.

Good solid fun for casual gamers, especially ones who love being bad guys.

Having spent so many hours playing this game, I felt like it was about time I wrote a review.

I'm always interested in games which you can play from the 'opposite point of view'. Games like Evil Genius, or Stubbs the Zombie, or Dungeon Keeper, where you can take on the role of the traditional 'bad guy'.

This game lets you take control of a city wrecking Kaiju in your bid to take over the world. Some people have made the comparison to the old school arcade classic Rampage, but this game is so much more intricate and has so much more depth. It's hard to compare it to anything else I can think of. It has base building elements, character development as you power up your Kaiju, strategy at a city level and global level. Resource management. Although you could play it as a casual city stomping experience, if you invest more time and attention in the game, you will come to appreciate the depth here.

At a secret base level, you have to juggle your resources and facilities, making raids to gather all the money and power and organics to maintain your base and build new facilities. You will have a couple of years to build up your base and Kaiju powers before the Kaiju Defence Force (KDF) begin to attack your secret base directly. But when they do, you'd better have some defences in place because even their first attacks can send enough units to wreck your base and overwhelm your Kaiju.

At a global level, there are many cities rated from Tier 1 (weak) to Tier 5 (strong), and spread across 6 global regions. Each attack on a city will raise the alert level of a region, from green to yellow to amber to red. It's much easier to catch a city off guard in a region with a low alert level, and the alert level will drop over time if you don't keep attacking the same region. On the other hand, you can capture cities faster with repeated attacks, but doing so will leave a region on Red Alert level, which I've never seen drop back down to amber, even after several in game months. Attacking cities which are on alert makes your raid much tougher as there will be more units on the map to greet you. Catching a city off guard will give you some time to stomp around without any enemies to oppose you. That can make a big difference.

The only way to force a city to surrender without plunging the whole region to red alert is to hit it when the region is on green alert, completely unprepared, and make it surrender with one attack. That adds a level of strategy. If you have no regions on green alert, do you risk a raid and force that region to an even higher alert level, or take a break, maybe spend some time training new abilities until the regions calm down again? Or do you just attack relentlessly and pay no heed to the alert levels, risking being ambushed when you arrive at a city, or facing a lot of enemy units as soon as you arrive, instead of catching them by surprise and having some time to wreck whatever you wish without having to fight off the defence forces?

At a city level, each city has its own character. The developers have made each city look like it should with the building styles and map layout, and each city has a different selection of units to protect it. Some rely more on helicopters and aircraft, some have more tanks, or hi tech units, some use lighter long ranged units like missile trucks and missile tanks. Each kind of enemy unit requires a different kind of Kaiju power to counter. And with only 6 power slots available, picking the right abilities for each city is important. No point taking normal Eye Beam Lasers when you know you're going to be facing tanks. You'll need Radioactive Death Stare for those. But then again, if you're only going to be facing jeeps and light tanks, normal Eye Beams are much more useful, they cost less power to use, and have a much quicker recharge time. No need for overkill, always picking the most powerful abilities you have.

Also, each city has a different balance of available resources. Some cities might have many colleges and universities, making it a great place to raid for Knowledge. Others might have several banks or large office building areas, great for looting cash. Some have extensive dock and port areas, where you can get plenty of energy. Some cities might not have many buildings where you can get power, so you'll have to make sure you head out with plenty of power already in your Kaijus batteries. Others might have so many power buildings that you can afford to go there running on empty, so you can bring back to base a huge amount of power for building better facilities.

Either way, even though you have a massive monster under your control, you will inevitably be overwhelmed and forced to retreat as the defenders send more and more units against you. So you have to hit a city hard, grab what you need, destroy your chosen targets and get out again safely. Do you want to force the city to surrender and supply you with monthly cash income? Take out their landmarks and stomp on as many civilians as you can. Are you just making a raid for cash, or power, or knowledge? Find the buildings that contain what you need, and smash them to the ground to get at the goodies inside. Banks, Universities, Power Plants, Office Towers... they all give up more loot than simple houses and stores.

You can definitely play this as a casual stress relief kind of game, having fun stomping on fleeing citizens and infantry, swatting helicopters out of the sky and melting tanks with laser beams and plasma breath, but for players who love deeper strategy and unique or unusual gameplay, this game really has a lot to offer.

And with the upcoming release of two more Kaiju, with different abilities and features, it has more to offer in the future. I can understand why some players are disappointed that all three monsters weren't available at launch, but the develpers have been toiling hard behind the scenes, as well as polishing the game as it stands with tweaks, bug hunts and game balancing. Over 200 hours with only one Kaiju, and two more to look forward to. I didn't play Skyrim or Fallout 3 as much as I've played this, and those two games are definitely on my top 5 list of most awesome games.",1434030409,1434030409,True,79,1,0.874203503131866455,0,True,False,False,False,,,

戰鬥中的操控其實不大流暢

滑鼠左鍵是控制怪獸移動  攻擊只能交給怪獸的AI控制
而AI會自動對著路徑上的可攻擊目標一路打過去 ( 因為怪獸的普攻都是近戰攻擊嘛)
拆建築沒什麼問題  但是對於那些會高速移動的人類軍隊相當頭痛
(地面載具坦克.飛行單位戰機.海上戰艦)
因為你不能指定你要攻擊的目標   只能像瞎貓抓老鼠一樣的嘗試著讓怪獸朝目標走過去 然後近戰打掉

地面上的各種會移動的戰車載具 很容易誤擊建築或平民而讓目標高速逃逸 
或是目標隱藏在都市叢林之中看不見而不斷的滋擾著  
天上飛的戰鬥機轟炸機等則會因為是2D遊戲 難以分辨飛行單位的相對位置來抓位置使用近戰攻擊
海上的小型戰艦則會被怪獸在海面上走動時的水花特效蓋過而看不見  難以抓位置打擊
導致戰鬥方面很不痛快


而滑鼠右鍵則是施放特定技能時的輔助鎖定   像是投射物 光線系 飛彈 砲擊 觸手穿刺類的攻擊

Pros:
+City destruction can be fun, for a while at least
+Nice presentation and theme

Cons:
-Clunky kaiju controls, and the way Power works decreases your chances to really cut loose with special attacks
-Grindy, repetitive gameplay loop that gets old pretty fast
-Doesn't explain itself well at all, and some aspects of base management can cripple you for making mistakes
-Feels unfinished and full of bugs

Lots of potential, but it just isn't there yet. Worth keeping an eye on.

One of the main reasons I first became interested was due to the look.  Immediately I was struck by how similar it was to an old game I enjoyed (also a monster destroying the city type game), The Movie Monster Game (C64).  the only difference being you directly controlled the monster in the C64 title, while in Kiaju-A-Go Go you have basic control over direction and what building to attack, but not true direct 1:1 control.

This game can be a bit of a grind to get your Kaiju built up.  Though if things were easy you'd probably not keep playing.  The game requires you to balance upgrades, buildings which come in numerous categories (such as production, training, storage, defense and the like) against your current monthly upkeep budget.  You can steal resources simply by attacking cities.  If you should manage to get one to surrender you will receive a monthly infusion of cash from that city.

Cities come in multiple difficulties.  So you will have to upgrade your Kaiju to tackle anything more than the basic level 1 cities (which can still be a challenge if you're only working with level 1 and 2 upgrades).  You do get plenty of upgrades to choose from once you've build all of the upgraded training facilities for your Kaiju.  So fret not, mad scientist. 

Aesthetically, the game looks quite good while still retaining the isometric camera view that games like The Movie Monster game utilized back in the mid 80's.  Cities look very nice at night, and you can zoom in or out to quite some degree.  The game also runs for me without a hitch, and on an older gaming rig (Core 2 Quad @ 3.72GHz, 8GB 1066MHz RAM, and Radeon HD6970 2GB video card) that's in sore need of an upgrade.

I played a game with my brother. It was called Rampage. I have fond memories of that game, smashing buildings and general chaos. Alas I grew up and those games seemingly have been forgotten by time. This genre needs to make a come back and Kaiju-A-GoGo may be the start of it. The goal is simple, world domination. Is it easy? No. Is it fun? Yes. Is it repetitious? Sadly, yes. 
Kaiju-A-GoGo is a sound video game on paper. Kaiju attacks city, gets resources, takes said resources back to base for upgrades and base expansion. However there is certain things that just hold the game back from being amazing. Controls are abysmal. Base management is more  a chore then actually fun. The long grind to getting your Kaiju up and running with powers. Despite this though, Kaiju-A-GoGo is still a really fun game. The moments you find yourself blasting lasers, fire, or god knows what. Watching everything explode around you is blissfully giddy and captures that giant monster magic. With more Kaiju monsters coming and PLENTY of abilities and upgrades. You have plenty of bang for your buck. The graphics and music are just fine as well. I want this genre to come back and Kaiju-A-GoGo can make it happen. With some patches and changes.

I played this through all the way to the finish for a very underwhelming game ending.  There weren't even any credits!  I dug around in the files and found some cool unused music in the soundtrack which left me dissappointed as it would of made the end game sound a lot more fun.  Especially when you start to actually fight things that are your size (which is both boring and a bit more tedious since you can't target them like you can everything else.).
All in all, the game could be a hell of a lot better.  And I don't see them changing the way the game plays.  The small buildings give you trouble through out most of the game until you're stronger.  But that really just pads out the length of the game and makes it boring.  It would of been better if you could just simply smash through anything small from the start and having to use your abilities on the larger buildings.  And having to use the stomp animation on civillians and infantry makes it hard to run away from getting killed, they should just die when you move over them instead.  I was also expecting some back and forth dialogue between the mad scientist and the likes of the ultraman and power ranger knock offs.

You will then start play at your Secret Lair, an uncharted island, and launch your first attacks upon the unsuspecting world. As you crush city after city with your magnificent creation, the resistance of the people in that region will weaken, until eventually they bow to the inevitable and admit that you’re in charge.

Many of the negative reviews are talking about the launch and people who don't understand the controls. Indeed the game was in a rough shape on the launch, with crashes and bugs, but it's perfectly fine right now and being updated with frequency! The devs are very attentive and quick to act about any problems that show up! 

From the creators of a marvelous game that I love too (Swords of the Stars: The Pit), this gem is perfect for those who are fan of kaijus (giant monsters) and strategy games.

In this game, you have to plan how to upgrade your kaiju (it even changes his appearance in some upgrades!) and your secret island, to help your efforts in taking over the world.

Destroy cities and make them surrender their command to you, making them vassal states.

Fight against air, ground, sea military forces and even other kaijus that will try to stop you!
And most important: Have tons of fun doing that.

The game controls can be a bit frustrating in the beginning, and the targeting of some attacks may look confuse, but with a little time and patience, you'll get in to it! Just keep in mind that you're controling a giant monster in a city, and that pesky tank you're trying to hit with your Eye Beam may be behind a building or something, and remember to lock the target on them with the right mouse button! :)

By the time, there's only one kaiju, but there are 2 to be released as dlc (for free for those who buy before their release!) and they plan to release more after the 3 initial ones, and maybe even a expansion!

Repetitive play, clunky design, and a feeling of being unfinished get in the way of the fun.

Kaiju-A-GoGo is a kind of reverse X-Com or reverse Defend The Planet type game.  You're the force of evil that threatens the world, and it's your goal to conquer it while others try and stop you.  They will, of course, fall before your might.

The game itself is a mixture of Kaiju stomper/environment destroyer, RPG, resource gatherer, and evil base management.  You send your Kaiju forth to devestate cities, gather resources while you traumatize the population into submission, and then upgrade your base.  As cities fall before you, they send tribute to further fuel your efforts - which you'll need as forces rally to stop you.

The game comes down to:
1) Send a Kaiju to a city, and use a simple point and click method, plus various powers, to cause havok.  Gather resources as you smash and conquer.
2) Use resource to upgrade your Kaiju.
3) Use resources to upgrade your base (including deciding on geographic layout).
4) Repeat until you conquer the world.

Unfortunately, the game's various pieces don't line up:
1) Combat feels clunky and repetitive - point, crush, lookt, continue.  It moves slow, targeting is iffy, and environments get samey very quickly.
2) Kaiju Upgrading takes time, though there is an extensive upgrade system for those who get deep into the game.
3) Base management has some strange interface issues, but mostly comes down to trying to clear land and build structures with resources.  There's not a lot of guidance or help to determining your path (some simple projections would help)

The game ends up being less fun, more management, rather slow, and not that exciting - and there's not a lot of initial guidance on the gameplay that make a lot of it a case of stabbling in the dark.

Though the game is, simply, very flawed and unpolished, I do have to credit the great art style and the enthusiasm.  There's a kind of cartoony vibe provided to the game, with amusing character designs and a real sense of humor.  It's a game that feels ""right"" - until you play it.

The designers seem very commited to the game, promising new monsters and updates.  That gives me some hope as it shows promise, but it's not there yet.  It feels very Early Access - and not in a good way.

So I have some hope - but for now, take a pass, unless you truly want to relive the old days of Crush, Crumble, and Chomp or The Creature That Ate Sheboygan.  The game has a way to go, it's a bit of a monster of the wrong kind.",1430512343,1430512343,False,1,0,0.431624054908752441,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Just the name of this game has you wondering what it could be about. Abound with curiosity, diving in head first might not always be the best idea. What claims to be an homage to City destroyers of yester year, ends up making us wish this game remained in that time. Kaiju-a-GoGo has a somewhat creative concept but, does having a game with giant city destroying monsters automatically make it worth your time?

	With basically zero tutorial you are dropped into the intro of the game. Some characters flash on the screen only long enough to become annoying, and to tell you that you’re about to unleash your monster on Anchorage. This may seem like a fine way to teach you game mechanics, but the only mechanics really to teach are click where to go, and automatically destroy things along the way. Each building you destroy gives out some type of resource that is indicated by a symbol. Batteries, Books, Crystals, Money, and Chicken legs; are the resources dropped when buildings are destroyed. It is not immediately, or eventually apparent what each of these symbols represents. Chicken legs are to represent bio fuel in this game; I guess an oil drum was to confusing.

	After returning from your first outing with your loot, It is quickly taken from you in the form of expenses for your secret base. These expenses include operating costs mostly, but you can spend your ill-gotten gains on upgrades for your facility. Your monster needs time to recover from its last endeavour; giving you time to explore your island. 

	Your mad scientist utopia starts covered in jungle that your need to periodically remove. Using the resources that your monster gathers from the destroyed cities, you can build facilities that will allow you to improve your monsters abilities and better defend your island. Defending your island is essential as armies from vengeance seeking countries will come looking for a fight. For the most part you build facilities that produce resources which you use to build more facilities; making this process somewhat of a grind. Other structures include warehouses that give you a bigger max capacity for specific units. It never feels like you will be hitting your capacity but, players who do a lot of grinding could eventually run into this problem.

	Essentially the game is a kind of cycle where you use your monster to destroy cities, use the resources to build up your facilities, which in turn makes your monster better at destroying cities. For some this might be seen as a grind, and it certainly feels like one too. Your monster has a capacity for how many resources it can carry back from a city. This makes the progression incredibly slow paced, and feels like an intentional way to stretch out the game. You’ll increasingly feel the futility every time you come back to your island with such a small amount of loot.

	All of these problems resemble something that you would find on Facebook, rather than Steam. In fact the entire game reeks of a freemium online and mobile game. The resources you collect are over simplified, the monsters power ups are few and far between, and the improvements you make to your island take time to be completed. Your monster also needs time to be repaired between destructions. Granted there is an in game clock that you can manipulate to make faster or slower but, this seems like an online flash game with real time waiting periods that has been adapted for a full release. This kind of game design is essentially flawed. Constructing a game that is designed to waste time and make money, isn’t the way to release a full game on Steam. It also feels like that’s how they landed on this rather expensive price tag. The price you pay on steam must factor in what they think the average person online spends on this game over their playtime; but that’s just a theory.

	Besides being a cash grab some of the artwork is okay. It resembles the first Plants vs. Zombies, with a colourful hand drawn art style. Although where PvZ was over the top and cartoony, this game sits on the fence between cartoon and reality. Not picking a side in this matter becomes problematic. The art style wants to tell a quirky story while some of the dialogue contradicts it with references to real world cities. I think this game could reach the same kind of audience as PvZ, if they would just play up the wackiness of the concept. For instance, your monster looks like something out of a kids cartoon; thumbs up. But the building you destroy are obviously illustrated with a certain level of realism. The cities you destroy look more out of SimCity then what I would expect a skyline to look like in a kids show; thumbs down. Overall the artwork has potential, but looks cheap and is cheapened by the animations. The monster moving doesn’t look very convincing, in fact it just looks like twinked animation. Not something that most people would really notice while destroying a city, but it’s so bad it’s distracting

On the whole this is a game for kids. I guess it’s not really something to aspire to, selling a game to kids who don’t know that it’s worse than any other game from the 90’s and early 2000’s. Ultimately I would give a child Roller Coaster Tycoon, also available on Steam for less money, before I gave him something as confusing as this mess of menus. That’s not a knock on RCT, it’s legitimately an entertaining game for all age groups. This game just fails on the execution of its gameplay; and if a game isn’t fun to play then whose going to play it. Games that grind are fun when it’s amounting to something, but this just doesn’t ever seem worthwhile. Your money would be much better spent on either game aforementioned in this review.

[*]It doesnt look remotely good even for a sprite based game.
[*]It runs horribly and crashes are common.
[*]It's lacking content [i](Theres a story behind that but its irrelevant)[/i]
[*]Its got more than its fair share of bugs, which leads into the next point...
[*]Patches are not tested, coming out and making the game even worse.
[*]The UI is clunky at best.
[*]All the 'strategic' gameplay outside of directly destroying cities seems like its just there to facilitate the city destroying. Those parts of the game havent been executed well at all.
[*]Base building specifically is awkward and slow. If you want to build a wall thats 5 tiles long you would need to click 20 times around your screen. [i](Unless you need to click behind a piece of UI, then youre boned)[/i]
[*]Training new abilities becomes very slow very fast and as you cant use your Kaiju while training new abilities it all feels very discouraging.

You'll grow tired of the ridiculous management game long before you grind to tier-5, but the first few tiers are well worth the price.  

There is the basis of a VERY good game here.  With experience and feedback ""Kaiju a GoGo 2"" will be something to look forward to.  Hopefully future efforts will have more KAIJUs in it and less silly phone ap, spreadsheet management, stuff.

It starts very slow, and may seem abit boring, but eventually you'll be dropping tac nukes, calling in drones, and generally obliterating huge areas in true 'kaiju' style, eventually when the other two kaiju get released there'll be more options, but even for now we have a huge variety in a single character.

Just thinking about what I have unlocked in my current game is quite significant, 3 tier 1 abilities, followed by 9 out of 9 tier 2, 12 or so out of 18 third tier, and I can't even remember how many fourth tier, as well as 4 tier 5's. 

Now what does that mean? well I have three types of eye laser, rapid fire blasters, a cluster rocket launcher, a guided cruise missile, drone calls ins a tactical nuclear missile launcher, advanced armor, self repair capability etc. the list goes on. from small passive upgrades to massive options like the ""Brimstone"" missile, a missile which rains fire on the entire map of a city. The variety, and options in this game are astounding. Definitely worth it's price, and best yet if you buy a copy you'll be garenteeing further support, meaning yet more variety, and options.

It needs ...more...  They have a good game foundation built (other than some bugs that can be annoying but not game breaking), but I can see it getting old fairly fast.  After a bunch of runs in to destroy cities, usually about 3-4 per city so far to conquer it all the way, it does gets a little old hat doing the same routine each time.  Especially the early game.

Stomping around in the cities is just left click to move and it auto attacks anything in your path.  Your abilites are tied into the same energy pool of pickups that you want to bring back to your island, so for quite awhile you will be conserving your energy as much as possible.  Makes things feel very slow early on, although later it gets better.

I should also add that it is a bit on the grindy side to the point that cutting build/training times in half would really help kill off the facebook game vibe you get while playing sometimes.   

All that said, I do enjoy playing it.  It is by no means a terrible game, without Rampage around anymore there really isn't much else like this out there.  The graphics are fine, the cities look good with a fair number of different structures in them, and a city on fire at night is flat out beautiful.  It does a great job with the atmosphere and making you feel like a giant monster running amock. 
   
I have no regrets purchasing it but I am leaving my review negative for now simply because this game is not for everyone.  TLDR - Very slow begining, fairly grindy, has a bit of a facebook game feel to it, but fun concept and great in small doses.

Many of us who grew up in the games world of the late 80's and 90's miss the days when a neat concept game would hit the shelves and surprise with something new. For the decade prior, a new game was the latest FPS, RPG or MMO whos distinguishing feature would be how much sharper the graphics are THIS time. Far from perfect, but a lot of fun, Kaiju-A-GoGo is essentially a unique strategy and tactics RPG about destroying cities and conquering the world with a giant robot.

Concept: Rather than state that the game is bad or good because I happen to like it, It would be better to simply describe the product's appeal to me, and let the reader decide if it appeals to him/her as well. The objective is to conquer the world. The game consists of a strategy metagame and of course the tactical destroy-the-city game.

The strategy gameflow is to build up various resources to improve your Kaiju. You only get one. The game has a base building feature to generate resources and train the Kaiju similar to X-com. The Kaiju is improved by adding abilities you research in a tiered structure. Each successive tier features more abilities than the last, causing the player to be more judicious about which abilities he wants to research. 

The tactical game consists of ordering the kaiju to move in a certain direction in the city and using the active abilities for certain effects. The objective is to destroy as much as possible, driving the city's morale down and picking up resources to bring back with you. The lower the morale, the higher the chance the city will surrender. Building types will generate certain types of resources and certain cities have more of some resources than others. As the city wears down, the defenders will grow stronger and the player has to consider the endurance of the Kaiju vs. the his ability to escape or cause a surrender. A surrender is the main way to generate the money resource.

I'm a big fan of this type of gameplay, so this is basically my list of pros. The game is a progressive/grind type of metastrategy game, which does not appeal to everyone. Making the Kaiju stronger and destroying a city is great fun for me, and though the mechanics have some problems, the build up is quite satisfying. 

Now for the problems: 

The Kaiju can be hard to control sometimes and the amount of enemies and congestion makes maneuvering more difficult than it should be. Some common sense changes, such as allowing clicking off map to escape, and scrolling using arrow keys or some alternate method would be helpful. The kaiju also has a tendency to just shoot whatever it wants rather than the intended target. This can be frustrating.

There are some siily bugs, boats on land and at least once, I had an issue where I wouldn't take damage, my shots wouldnt land and the defenders stopped spawning.

Todays gamer needs a much larger amount of handholding than any generation prior, and this game does very little of it. Though the game can be figured out quite easily through trial and error plus deductive reasoning, these players often have youtube accounts with thousands of other easily confused player subscribers. A manual would probably help them enjoy thier game experience better. I don't know, for me the idea that I should look for an escape route for my Kaiju and be prepared to dig through some buildings when I'm at a certain health level...seems common sense to me.

Unfortunately, this small team of developers did not make the game in first person, or use the unreal-whatever engine to generate graphics. If you need these things to enjoy a game [strike]I feel sorry for you[/strike], maybe there will be an action spin-off rail shooter if this game takes off...just for you. The art style won't appeal to everyone, and sprites are a thing of the past, though for some sad reason, creepy not-really-lifelike awkward 3d models of people are not.

Thousands of people that have wasted their entire lives playing an mmo where you grind, have done a good job of telling the world how bad it is to grind. This game has a grind. If you enjoy the game, it's an enjoyable grind.

tldr: All in all a fantastic example of a decent crowdfunded game. It provides a gameplay concept (destroying cities with a giant robot x-com style) that would never see the light of day in the traditional model. Even though there are hits and misses, this is a great time to be a gamer.",1430094916,1430096060,True,30,7,0.636486291885375977,0,True,False,False,False,,,

UND... die Entwickler sind sehr nah am Spieler und fixen was das Zeug hält. Gehört sich auch so, denkt ihr? Weit gefehlt, wenn man manchen großen Publisher sieht.

Worum geht es in dem Spiel. Angelehnt an den (ich nenne ihn mal) Big-G, König der Monster Godzilla, erschafft ihr mit eurem verrückten Wissenschaftler einen Kaiju. Ein Monster. Mit dem wandert ihr über eine Weltkarte und müßt Städte in Schutt und Asche legen. Auch hier eine Warnung. Es artet ein wenig in ""grinden"" aus. Aber (meine Meinung) es lohnt sich. Jede Stadt ist anders. Jeder Stadtlevel (Tier 1 -...) hat andere Gegner für euren Kaiju parat. Bis hin zum Superpanzer oder andere gemeine Sachen. Es lohnt sich also länger als 2 Stunden zu spielen in denen man (so sagen es andere Rezensionen) angeblich eigentlich alles gesehen hat.

Nebenbei müßt ihr von den gesammelten Ressourcen eures Kaijus diesen ausbilden und immer neue bessere Gebäude in eurer Base bauen. Lagerhallen, bessere Reparaturstationen, Forschungslabore usw. und nicht zuletzt Verteidigungsanlagen für eure Base,. Denn es kommt der Tag, da schlägt die Kaiju Defense Force zurück und greift euch an.

Dieses Spiel hat wesentlich mehr Tiefgang als es zu Beginn den Anschein macht.

Jetzt doch ein wenig Fan-Boy... ich bin seit frühester Jugend Kaiju-Fan und spiele seit 20 Jahren am Computer (ausschließlich, deshalb kann ich ähnliche Monsterspiele für andere Plattformen nicht beurteilen) und auf ein solches Spiel habe ich immer gewartet. 

Wer mit ein paar Bugs leben kann, schon immer mal in die Rolle des Monsters schlüpfen und alles zerstören wollte, was ihm vor die Füße läuft UND ein wenig Ressourcenmanagement und Basebau betreiben wollte, der ist hier gut bedient.
Bei der momentanen Arbeit der Community (alles Fanboys und ein paar Trolle) sowie den sehr engagierten Entwicklern sehe ich hier echtes Potential.

Ihr bekommt einen Kaiju für euer Geld und es werden (nicht unendlich aber einige, 3 sind bereits terminiert) Kaijus nachkommen, so dass auch hier für Abwechslung gesorgt ist.

Wie immer mein Tip, glaubt dem Grummel nicht alles, sondern lest euch alle Rezensionen durch und stöbert im Communityforum zum Spiel. Dann trefft eure Entscheidung, dass Spiel zu kaufen oder nicht.

Ich für meinen Teil bereue es nicht und freue mich auf viele weitere Stunden Zerstörung.

	Kaiju-A-GoGo is a game where you take your Kaiju (Giant Robot Monster) to destroy different cities around the world and take their resources to upgrade your Kaiju/base. I am not going to lie and say that this game is perfect. Actually, it has plenty of problems, but the fun gameplay and the potential Kaiju-A-GoGo has greatly improves this games “awesomeness”. At times Kaiju-A-GoGo is very grindy and the base building has some glaring problems with it, but since it is in Early Access we can tell the developers the problems with it and we should see this game become nearly perfect before the full release. It show great potential and I can’t wait for the future updates and the new Kaiju.

	Kaiju-A-GoGo is a game of destruction and resource management. It has its problems, but it is in Early Access and this means that the problems of the game should be fixed before a full release. If you are willing to follow Kaiju-A-GoGo as it evolves into the full release version, it is 100% worth the money and you will get tons of fun out of it.

This game has a lot going for it. There is something primal and satisfying about laying the smack down on an entire city and watching it react to your engine of destruction.  This game is a great buy as is, but with an active dev tweaking the game on a regular basis, Kaiju-A-GoGo is going well on the path to being an epic standalone in a genre I will coin S.O.S. or strategic overlord simulator.  

This is an early access review...yada yada yada, followed by yada.

Interface
Currently fairly simple and barebones. You load the game or start a new one. Aside from the options to turn off sound there are no real options to speak of. You can turn off the tutorial, but there is not enough of one yet to be considered. oh yeah.. be sure to save your game often, as there is not autosave. I repeat SAVE YOUR GAME ON A REGULAR BASIS, less your game crashes and you go back a year in game time...sigh. To dev, please please I beg you implement an autosave.

-Tutorial
 see above. The game is simple and forgiving enough that you can find your way, but it would be nice to have something to explain some of the mechanics, units, and world system.

-Graphics
I am going to be totally honest, I am slightly torn on the graphics. On the hardware side of things, it runs on my laptop for the most part, so I'm happy. Definitely not going to tax your turbocooled hyper threaded pc. The characters and monsters have a hand drawn feel. The cities, monster and military units are all isometric, but the units that actually move have about 4-6 frames, covering most angles. I like it, reminds me of the days of Mech Commander. 
The stylized look of the kaiju kaiju works, and I like it just fine, but it would be interesting to see if the design was a little realistic, and less comic or cartoon like. The animations are really cool for the attacks, and its really refreshing to see that quality and know that someone put in the time to make them. 

Sound
The background music of the game is cute and quirky, while the in game music is of the ominous type. Some variation or options would really enhance the mood of the game. Sound effects for the bang pow stuff, sounds like explosions and gunfire, so that works well. The attacks and abilities also have nice sound effects. In its essence, the game actually sounds like you are watching over a 200 metre behemoth tear apart a city.

Controls
I have a feeling that this is where this game is going to have a lot of attention, as the in game character is controlled via left mouse click while abilities are used with the number keys. Some will cry that more control should be allowed, like a WASD scheme, and while that would be a cool option if that would work with this style game(isometric), I don't know/think that it would translate very well. 

Bugs/Issues
- The base development and resource management aspect is fairly solid, although there are a couple issues with menu overlay- like when you are trying to build multiple buildings near each other when zoomed out.
-Crashes. the game has crashed on me a couple of times out of nowhere, leaving me to load from my previous save.
-SAVE SYSTEM- autosave would be a really great tool to prevent minor frustration from when the game crashes.
-In the assigning abilities menu, no info is available when you click on the abilities. To get that info you have to go to the training menu wheel and click on the ability you want info about. Can be a little confusing when you have a large wheel of abilities.

 As I write this, only one Kaiju is available, but I think 2 are on the way, with skins I hope/pray. You can tell I lot of thought and creativity went into the upgrading system, the game, the artwork. If I were ever to make a game, this would the game I would want to make. ciao",1430032446,1430032446,True,7,0,0.46436271071434021,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After much consideration I've changed my recommendation from ""No"" to ""Yes"".  That doesn't mean the game is perfect, or even fixes all the issues I had at launch, but I think in the last 2.5 months it has improved enough to be more good than bad and feel like a more complete game.

The controls are now more responsive, with the monster not ignoring so many clicks to tell it where to go.  They've added a second monster that plays pretty differently.  I'm not crashing frequently like I used to.  There are now proper sound sliders.  And many other bugs have been fixed alongside small additions and tweaks as you can see in the patch note posts.

I'd still love to see some better handling with a ""flee/non-aggressive"" mode toggle, as well as improving the base building and defenses part of the game, making it less grindy, improving readability/intuitiveness of the economy readouts and several other things.  

But overall I think enough has improved to make this worth a recommendation for the default price if you like giant monsters.  

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I was an Indie GoGo backer so I have been looking forward to this game for a while.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend it at launch.

By many measures this should be an Early Access game and not considered a ""full"" release.  The game only has one of the three promised kaiju, contains plenty of bugs, and it just does not feel done.

The controls are abysmal, frequently frustrating and responsible for multiple infuriatingly avoidable deaths already.  I have no idea how they thought this was a good control scheme.  Or the fact that you can't tell your monster to not attack things as you are trying to run for your life.  Whether your robot listens to you or not seems like pure luck.  Juck keep clicking and hope that it quits being so stupid.

I'm not personally a fan of the art style and I think the way that the monster is made up of several detached sprites instead of being a single animated sprite looks kind of bad.  The cities don't look bad, though, and when lots of things are burning and exploding it's pretty cool, especially at night.

As mentioned, I have run into several bugs.  I've had the game crash to desktop.  I've had cities where no enemy AI every spawned despite raising several Defcon levels.  There are Patrol Boats that drive right through ground terrain in many areas of cities.  There are no actual volume sliders for Music or Sound Volume.  

The game is also very grindy.  You'll have to keep attacking the same beginner cities for ages to build up enough resources to upgrade your island to then upgrade your monster.  But then when you inevitably die because of the poor controls you'll be knocked back a bit and have to build up resources again.  And be ready to spend most of your time speeding up and slowing down the passage of time as you repeatedly wait for basic things to complete, like walking to a city or repairing your monster.

Overall, this is just not ready.  There are some fun concepts here, but the actual gameplay is sorely lacking.  Hopefully in time this will be more fleshed out, better to control, and more polished overall.  Time will tell.",1430012364,1436463223,True,0,0,0.498169988393783569,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Both about giant monsters invading cities for total destruction, escaping it or even rescuing it's offspring - a bit weird when the monster was a robot, which was also capable of eating(?!?) for healing. The graphics were... well, let's say they were not bad back then (using a LOT of imagination).

Then comes Kaiju-a-GoGo: the trailer got me back to these old games and I got the game as soon as it was off.

Or at least, it should be a tablet or phone game and not a PC game, the way the interface was done.

Anyone who says this is X-Com like has never actually played X-Com.  Not turn based, not squad combat, just one unit.  Yes, you build a base, and yes there's a globe and time clock where you select where to go... but it's not searching for and intercepting anything.  It's the same places you can go any time you want.

Pros:
- You're a mad scientist controlling a kaiju
- You get to smash cities quite thoroughly
- There is some customization of kaiju abilities
- Simple interface

Cons:
- Difficult to target attacking units
- Seems very grindy (at least early on)
- Did I mention repetitive?
- Incomplete, and should be Early Access as of April 25, 2015
- There's an ad when you exit you can't skip.  WTF.  I bought the game.
- Buggy.  For instance settings not saved, and constantly resetting the clock speed when you don't want it to.

I'm not going to comment on the graphics other than to say there's not much variation.  At all.

I'm not going to comment on their business model and how they're selling it.  They have pretty solid reasoning for it, though it is unconventional.

Is the game worth the current $12 price?  No.  Would it be worth $15 with all 3 kaiju?  No.  It should be a $5 iOS/Android market game and not a Steam game.",1429995372,1429995372,False,15,3,0.577809393405914307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I truly hope the developer continues to add more Kaiju after the 2 additional already planned and/or immediately begins taking my money for a sequel.

ETA:  Many many more hours in, I wanted to expand on this.  The game definitely lives up to it's X-com meets Evil Genius vibe.  Plenty of other reviews, and youtube footage explain or show how the game works if you want to get a feel for the actual gameplay.  I just want to say, if you enjoy giant monsters and enjoy strategy games, I can almost guarantee that you'll get at least some fun out of this game.  If you love giant monsters and mad science more than anything, you'll love this game because a decent game that feeds that love only comes along maybe once or twice a decade really.

At this point I feel the game has a very satisfying level of difficulty and rewards smart playing, while not being too punishing in the learning curve to figure out what exactly a smart play is going to be.

The original game balance was a touch easy, and in the first week it's been tweaked up and down a bit in response to player feedback.    While it's easy for some people to say 'Well, it should have been right the first time, why don't they have testers/what are the testers for?' Sometimes it isn't so easy to see the forest for the trees if you've been involved during the process.  Fresh eyes on the subject, and a wider range of play styles brings a lot of new info in and the devs have been HUGELY, AMAZINGLY responsive.  In fact, they've been so on the ball that I'm confident enough in continuing support for the game to want to be sure that they have the opportunity to do so and have bought 2 more copies for friends.  If this turns into a franchise with the legs to last I'll be quite happy, but after the effort the dev team has put in I feel confident that even if there were never another full game released in the series I'll be able to play it years from now and find bugfixes and compatibility updates for Windows 2035 HyperWeb Edition.

*cough* 

Despite the current issues (crashes - now less with 1.03 patch, some unclear gameplay mechanics) Kaiju-A-Go-Go will fulfil all your Evil Scientist needs, and despite it's deceptively casual appearence it hides the heart of a classic XCom like balance of strategic choices in terms of resource gathering, building and conquering. Along with disturbing your fellow humans with evil cackling when cities surrender to the might and terror of your robot dinosaur. 

City smashing wise it's relatively simple, but you will need to plan out your route of attack so you don't get bogged down and defeated by the local defenders and balance out you use of abilities to avoid being out of power, along with gaining the needed resources for upgrading your Kaiju and hidden island base. 

And trust me on this - you will need lots of power plants, also making a beeline towards and nomming on cargo ships, banks, container lots and power plants ensures you'll usually have enough resources at the end of the month. Otherwise for city conquering, hit the suburbs and crush, lase and burn those civilians to show them how hopeless their resistance to you is, Muwahahhahahahahahahahaha!

You start off attacking Alaska with limited abilities and limited resources. This quickly builds as you collect resources from the cities you destroy and take them back with you to your base to construct facilities for production, defense and storage. 

Also, one building type in particular gives you ability enhancements. From here, you will purchase and train your Kaiju in skills chosen from a tech tree. All the cities are different and have a variety of difficulty levels. You are attacked by various military units and there is quite a few. You can only pick the one Kaiju for the moment but more are coming in Summer. Here's my pro/con list:

pros:

- Unique & successful idea set into motion.
- Easy to start but yet pretty deep
- Really fun destroying the cities (each city has special buildings or landmarks)
- Can advance your Kaiju and make him stronger and stronger
- The art style is interesting and looks good
- There are many cities to conquer and some simply can not be conquered from the start

cons: 

- loading times are a bit long
- controls can be a bit wonky why you are trying to destroy a military unit attacking you
- UI controls for the base are a bit confusing (I didn't realize I had to build a advance facility to get to Tier 2 skills until later that I would have liked)
- the game crashed a couple of times due to a bug when leaving a city (twice but isn't a huge issue)
- some cities regenerate pretty quickly (rebuild and restore morale) 

But all in all, it is a fun game that you should try if you like action mixed with base building and an a bit of an RPG element. It is a game for all ages!",1429917540,1429917540,True,12,0,0.52728581428527832,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Earlier I recommended the game but to buy later when stuff was fixed, well lots of it has been fixed really fast since release.

UPDATE 2: My DLC concerns are out of the window as of May 5th 2015 due to the next two monsters being free for current owners of the game, and the price will go up for new buyers by $1 per monster which really isn't that bad at all. More fixes and balancing was done, and a free skin for the first monster was given free to current Steam owners until May 8th. The game is a much smoother experience and is coming along nicely and at a good rate. I'm actually surprised, being so cynical about the current state of the gaming industry it's really rare to see devs do so good and honestly makes me more than glad I bought this game on release day. The issue I had with 'depth' isn't as bad as it may sound if you read my original review below, but when I said 'deeper than it looks but not deep enough'  I want to revise that to 'deeper than it looks and deep enough for most'. Original review below for those still reading.

Original review:
I do recommend this game but there is a few caveats (UPDATE: 100% recommend the game at this point to anyone who would ask). It is deeper than it looks but not deep enough in some spots (UPDATE: revised above in my 2nd update of this review). It's like a reverse XCOM in the sense that you are trying to destabilize the world instead of save it, but you only have one base to operate from. That is a way to describe it, it's almost like you are playing the alien side in the original XCOM with your hidden base and once found will be assaulted.

DLC are advertised and that bums me out since we might not get anything for free at a later date, that is enough to scare off many people because we all have seen how well that worked for Evolve (UPDATE: As of my 2nd review update above this is not a problem at all, and definitely nothing like Evolve). Maybe the devs will have a better DLC model, but most of the time DLC just bums me out from purchasing any at all. Still this game is easy to lose a time in as it is now. Gameplay is simple and satisfying, this game can work as pick-up and go where you smash a single city or for extended gaming sessions and to top it off this shouldn't require a powerful PC. A few bugs here and there, nothing bad found yet. They are getting squashed at a regular rate though. I will swear there is nothing quite like controlling a mecha-godzilla stomping around a city while drinking some beer, that is seriously some good times.

So while I do recommend this game I would tell anyone who asked to buy it if you really dig some vids that are out now and if you are on the fence then wait on a sale maybe but the price is still good (UPDATE: I'd tell anyone this is a good game experience at this point and is getting better, 100% recommended purchase) Since there will be DLC in a year or so we might see a DLC pack on sale or a GOTY edition. At this point the game could develop well or not, anymore you never know even with companies with good track records. But the price is good, $13 to start. Wait and see how these DLC roll out and see how many features get added, but the developers are doing very good on stabilizing and balancing the game in it's current state and the prospects for the future of this game are much better than others we have seen recently I shall not mention. If I were to go in the past for a do-over I'd still buy the game when I did, I call it a good purchase for myself.

Edit: Updated after the 1.03 patrol hotfix. 

Updated Bit: 
 - You can now recycle unwanted buildings at your lair, and there are more tooltips for the secret base buildings. 
- For those who were worried, volume sliders are in. 
- Threatening cities (once you have built a properly dangerous reputation) is in, provided you build the proper base facility. 
- Stupid play is still stupid play: Don't expect stomping only small apartment complexes to give you the resources you need. Tactical and strategic city-stomping is rewarded... time is a resource before city defenders show up, so go for the JUICY targets like universities, banks, and power plants. 
- Core gameplay is in and solid. Technical issues (slowdown spikes on some rigs, very strong patrols) seem to have been addressed, but this game still has some rough edges. If you require prefect functionality, this game is not for you. 
- Still an easy recommend if you are into city-stomping and varied monster training. 

Pros: 

- First Kaiju City Stomper/Base Building game in ages (ever?)
- Kaiju is not a static creature, but one the player nurtures and develops through resource gathering and training
- Training does not follow a fixed path! Game has 99+ abilities for the Kaiju, and the player is only expected to unlock around 33 on a normal run. Abilities are unlocked via a web, whereby you can't simply rush to the ability you want. Prereqs must be unlocked too. 
- The world is not JUST your punching bag. Each region is building its own unique Kaiju to thwart you! There are six regions, each with a different mix of defense units. 
- Resources! 5 you gather (Power, Knowledge, Money, ""Organics"", and Purpletonium) and one you can only spend- time! After five years of raiding and conquering, the Kaiju Defense Force is coming for you and your secret base.
- Unique city layouts! Each city is different and persistent, so the approach to optimally convert Caracas will be very different to the strategy needed for Seattle. Player decisions and needs matter and the game rewards considered city destruction. (Juicy targets may be mostly hidden behind terrain or skyrises, so there is an element of treasure hunting/Where's Waldo?)
- Base Building: The way you lose is if your secret Lair is destroyed, so you will need to build both defensive and production buildings to properly suceed. I don't have much experience with base defense yet, but you can make walls and at least 3 defensive turret types. 
- Made by Kerberos Productions as an Indie! KP has a fantastic track record of support for their indie titles, both tech and free content. (Look at The Pit, their roguelike, which had numerous updates and tweaks in addition to expansions for over two years.)
- You get to stomp cities as a giant monster! Did I mention that? I think I did...

Cons
- Some sound effect kinks remain. The sound of tank tracks, for example, can play in the background even when you have left a city you are fighting. 
- Kaiju control is very much ""go there and bash things,"" no way to differentiate auto-attacks from just defenders or just buildings. This is a minor quibble though, as the player has pinpoint targeting control of most of the activated abilities you research. Can make the first few cities frustrating. 
- Will not cure cancer.

Yesterday, I had the chance to play Kaiju-a-GoGo and interview the lead designer, Martin Cirulis. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, or just how much of a blast the game would be.

Kaiju-a-GoGo is the kind of city-crunching, monument-stomping, laserbeam-shooting, cutely-terrifying Kaiju'em Up I've been waiting for. With a surprising amount of depth under the hood aside from STOMP STUFF KILL THINGS (things burn easier in dry parts of the world--who knew!), it captures the raw simplicity of, well, stomping stuff and killing things without becoming one-note.

I may be on a watchlist now after telling my friends charming things like ""Make sure to burn the houses in Wellington,"" or ""Have you tried attacking Seattle yet?"", but that's okay! All I need is one more upgrade before I sign off for the day...

Although controlling your Kaiju is very simple, the gameplay is pretty deep.  You need to carefully choose what to build on your island base, what path you take through a city, WHICH city to attack, which abilities to use etc...

A few things I didn't expect going in:

1) The level of detail. In terms of managing your secret base, upgrading and repairing your kaiju, there is a lot to do and consider. 

2) How much actual fun causing mayhem in a seemingly helpless city is.

3) Level of difficulty. It's not quite as easy as it seems either. Cities will ramp up their efforts to repel you as you tear down more and more of their infrastructure (why are they so hostile?). So expect infantry, combat jeeps, tanks, helicopters and more to try to take a piece out of your precious Kaiju.

Apart from the aforementioned stuff, the art style and attention to detail in the layouts of the cities is very fitting and well-done. Who doesn't like goofy mad scientists bent on world destruction?

To summarize: Get this game if you want a casual, yet deep strategy experience that you can easily play in small bites or marathon sessions. It's strangely addicting. Just don't cackle in glee with your friends or family around. They...probably won't understand... Anyway, just get this game. You won't regret it.

P.S. Did I mention the X-Com like world map and  time compression system? I'll do that next time.",1429835685,1429835685,True,69,5,0.723169147968292236,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Somewhat of an inverse-XCOM because you're the bad guy trying to defeat the world by attacking cities and building your secret island base.  You can look all day long for a strategy game where you stomp through a city as a giant monster... I'll wait...  right, there aren't any others.  So, if that's your thing then this is your game.

It's evident that Canadians made this, because all the N. American cities are the ones with good hockey teams.  The soundtrack is fun, and there's no mistaking that it's considerably inspired by Toho's own soundtracks.  Buildings burn NICELY, and the fire propagates, so you'll have some pretty epic views of burning cities at night.  Multiple tiers of unlockable powers - breath weapons, eye beams, armor, shields, big guns.  The game has a single Kaiju in it now, a Mechagodzilla inspired robozilla, and down the road they'll release at least two more - maybe more.  Maybe if enough of us chant ""Cthulhu"" in the comments that can happen.  :-)

It works, it's fun, and it's the only game like it... so it's a pretty easy $12ish to spend.",1429827812,1429827812,True,87,13,0.801282346248626709,11,False,False,False,False,,,
