My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706938605,1706938605,True,1,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Bilinci yerinde olmayan elit bir savaşçıyı keşfedip kurtardıktan sonra, medeniyete dönüş yolunu bulmak için bir göreve koyulurlar.

Oyun, iki zorluk modu, fare kontrolü ve otomatik kaydetme ile 8 saate kadar oyun süresi sunuyor. Inferno'nun benzersiz özelliklerinden biri, oyunun geliştiricisi Indinera'nın imzasını taşıyan, sürükleyici diyaloglarla dolu yenilikçi hikayesidir. Oyun ayrıca harika sanat eserleri, prodüksiyon değerleri ve oyunun genel sürükleyici deneyimine katkıda bulunan atmosferik bir ses ortamına sahiptir.

Oyuncular ormanı keşfederken, zorlu koşullar ve öfkeli canavarlarla karşılaşıyor, bu da görevi zor ve zorlu hale getiriyor. Hayatta kalmak için zekâlarına, güçlerine ve ormanda bir rota bulabilen garip arkadaşları Josef'in dehasına güvenmeleri gerekiyor. Oyun dönemeçlerle doludur ve şans müttefikleri Pristine'ın geçmişi yavaş yavaş gün ışığına çıktıkça, hayatta kalmak göz korkutucu bir görev haline gelir.

Genel olarak Inferno, büyüleyici hikaye anlatımını sürükleyici bir oyunla birleştiren ilgi çekici bir oyundur ve macera ve RPG türüne mükemmel bir katkı sağlar.

最后，游戏的BUG也是个问题。我遇到了不少导致游戏崩溃或者操作无法正常执行的错误。这让我感到愤怒，因为这些问题本可以避免。

Not for the faint of heart.****[/b]

I've never been a fan of neither short nor survival style games. But honestly, this game had me hooked for it's story.
It wasn't my cup of tea, as there were no towns nor a leisure pace (It was dungeon after dungeon with no end in sight). The overly convoluted dungeons (despite being linear) and the constant battles wore me out as much as the characters themselves were worn out 😵. But that perfectly captures the essence of this game, fighting for survival in what can only be interpreted as a post-apocalyptic world.

[b]Battles:[/b] (I played the normal difficulty.)
The bosses themselves were not that hard once you know the buffs and debuffs to use and states to inflict.
The random encounters however, were a nightmare for me. I've never escaped so much in an Aldorlea game as much as I've done in this one 😂. I chalk it up to my paranoia of using up all restorative items and getting stuck 😅. 
The stat gain from levelling up would definitely be worth the grind though 👍. It might even make the encounters easier to deal with. (But hey, I was running for my survival here. no time to grind! 😆)

[b]Characters:[/b]
Mathilde was really well written. She was dealing with her inner fears while having to struggle to survive in a land she knew nothing about while not having any skills to do it. 
Josef played the crazy-inventor-in-love-with-his-creation well up to the very end.
Pristine was too much of a mystery until the end (Read the ending discussion for more).

[b]Ending discussion:[/b]
[spoiler]I had my suspicions when Pristine didn't notice Switch's disappearance, but was thrown off by Pixie not noticing it too (I honestly doubted the innocent cute cat 😭).
But after Pixie disappeared, I was certain Pristine was behind everything (Around the halfway mark I guess?). Though I didn't know she was a robot until Josef stated it (Actually blew my mind 🤯 that I didn't pick up on it).
While playing the game I hoped for a happy ending, but somewhere in the back of my mind I had a feeling that they were only delaying the inevitable. The person I least expected to live was the one left standing in the end. And understandably, she couldn't handle it and chose to end her suffering.
Then comes the open ending style, where we are left to imagine the reasons for Pristine going bad. So here's my interpretation. 
The lab in the jungle and the entire continent was a secret experiment gone bad. It was the army's directive to eliminate all personnel from the lab and since Pristine had the skills/mind of a soldier ""installed"" in her, it was only a matter of time until she turns on the survivors.[/spoiler]
