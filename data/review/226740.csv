[b]In the dim-lit recesses of the Steam sprawl, I chanced upon a game that spoke in hushed tones of the supernatural underworld – ""Monster Loves You!"" A digital realm where monstrous decisions bore the weight of a leaden conscience in the stillness of night.

The visuals struck me with the precision of a well-oiled revolver – sharp and unyielding. The grotesque choreography of creatures and the raw, unfiltered art formed a world where monsters transcended mere denizens of the night; they became damned souls clawing for survival in the asphalt jungle.

Choices, in this digital noir, were not mere options; they were wagers in a high-stakes poker game. Each decision sent ripples through the narrative, akin to the echoes of gunshots reverberating through an abandoned warehouse. Would one embrace the darkness as a ruthless fiend, or tread the path of a misunderstood creature yearning for redemption? The dichotomy ensnared me, pulling me into a realm where morality was an elusive, shifting beast.

The soundtrack, a haunting melody that permeated the essence of the game, formed a symphony of despair echoing through the twisted alleyways of this virtual city. It set the stage for a narrative that delved into the recesses of the monstrous psyche.

This wasn't a mere tale; it was a descent into the abyss, a journey through the fog-choked streets of moral ambiguity. The plot unfolded as a mosaic of gritty choices, cutting through the digital haze like a switchblade in the hands of a desperate soul. Consequences were relentless, stalking like shadows in the dimly lit corners of the narrative.

""Monster Loves You!"" transcends the realm of a mere game; it is a dark odyssey. A plunge into the unknown, where the line between monstrous and human blurs like the dissipating smoke from a snub-nosed revolver. A story that seizes one by the throat, refusing release until every bitter drop of its narrative is savored.

To fellow gamers and inhabitants of the digital underworld, if an appetite exists for a game that orchestrates a heartbeat in rhythm with a city's nocturnal pulse, consider ""Monster Loves You!"" It is a journey through the twisted landscapes of morality, where monsters love, monsters hate, and destiny is shaped by the razor edge of gritty decisions. A digital noir opus that will linger in memory long after the echoes of the narrative have dissipated into the abyss.[/b]",1705478839,1705733646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Story:

As soon as the game begins the story explains that you're a monster that is about to be born and you're going to witness every aspect of it's life, to being born, it growing up and beyond.

The game is mostly a choose your own adventure type visual novel, where every choice leads to a different path and a you basically create a different type of monster as you go along your journey. I will say I was quite impressed with how the story is written. It seem seems expansive and the writing itself is really charming and in moments actually quite funny. I will say that I could not bring myself to play through it multiple times, because the story is fine, but not worth playing through multiple times, however I will say that there's quite a bit of play value if you really want to see all the possible outcomes. 

Graphics:

Visually Monster Loves You! is pleasing to look at, but it's very minimal in the graphics department. The monster and environment designs are really decent and the bright colors and quirky designs are really pleasing to look at and I quite enjoyed seeing my monster grow over time. However 90% of the time you will be looking at a wall of text which will not allow you to truly appreciate the art style. 

Audio:

Apart from the music there's not much audio design. It's overall decent, but nothing incredibly impressive. The music is cheerful and fits the tone of the game well and acts as nice background noise while you're reading text and picking out your choices.

Gameplay:

As I said before, Monster Love You! is to an extent a visual novel, choose your own adventure game. You're basically picking a choice, reading a bunch of text and then picking another choice to progress further, but this game has a few other mechanics to make your journey interesting. 

You're basically trying to pass time while you grow up and you have days in the corner and every so often time will move forward and you grow up slightly by the end of the set. Your choices also can give you stat boosts like cleverness, ferocity bravery, etc and these will allow you to go for different paths to increase play value. 

Verdict:

For what it is, Monster Loves You! is a great little adventure game if you want something sweet and funny to play, however I find that while decent, the writing is nothing special to warrant multiple playthroughs and the one was enough for me. I will say on a sale this one is well worth it, if you like the genre.

Final Rating:
6.5/10

Pros:
+ Great art style
+ Tons of play value
+ Charming writing

Cons:
- Overly simplistic story
- Music is quite bland
- Can get too wordy at times

Monster Loves You! is a game developed by Radial Game Corp. and Dejobaan Games, LLC. and published by Radial Games Corp.

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Monster Loves You! overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay-ish to meh adventure RPG game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

Real Monsters. Each stage of life comes with slightly different challenges, from interpersonal disputes to wilderness dangers, though you never have any actual risk of long-term harm. The final stage as an Elder is much different from the others, relating to the relationship between human and monster-kind.

Each run only takes about 45-60 minutes, but different possibilities invite the potential for several play-throughs. While the events you can choose are scripted with multiple options, the challenges available are not the same in every run, and it is possible to play significantly different runs by going through different events and playing them differently.

This game is a great premise. It is far from being complete. For my taste, it could take 100x the time it does take to play through. You really get the chance to ask yourself questions about yourself, what should you do to be a specific type of person and to enact a specific effect on your world.

Sadly, just one bad thing that comes to my mind now is this: your options are somewhat misleading so you may end up with different consequences than you intended and you are not allowed to go back.
That is bad in a game which is 100% about your actions and their consequences..I  hope the devs are going to fix this.

+ Pleasant visuals and audio
+ Funny writing, sometimes even tense or touching
+ Alright gameplay, though the huge font and buttons make it feel like a mobile game.
+ Many endings

[h1]The bad:[/h1]
- Often hard to guess the outcome of your actions (although sometimes it's a nice surprise - less so when you're trying to get the last few achievements and accidentally end up with eg. too much respect).
- Only one save slot, and even that is automatic
- The game is quite grindy - you are supposed to replay the entire hour-long monster life 14 times to get all endings. Fortunately there are some guides that help to reduce this to 4-5 times.
- The stories are randomly selected each time you reach a new stage or load a save file. This helps with the grindiness, but it also makes it unreliable when you're trying to improve certain stats.

It's an interesting casual narrative game. Mostly lighthearted and silly, though a bit grindy if you care about unlocking all endings/achievements. Recommended, though wait for sale.",1583683759,1583683978,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I won't spoil what that moment is, but how you've lived your monster life will change what you're able to do when that moment comes and decide the fate of the monsters and the future of their world. The art and music are very cute and catchy; No animation here whatsoever, just still art and background music with sound effects. It can be fun to play through multiple times and see what decisions you didn't make previously and what different ways you can affect the outcome of the game. There are achievements to earn for certain endings and outcomes so there is some extra incentive to do this. A normal playthrough takes maybe 30-45 minutes so if you know you're not the type to play a game more than once then it's definitely not worth the money, but if you are then I think you'll get a lot out of this game.

Pros:
-Different appearance per playthrough
-Different options per life stage 


Cons:
-No variation in main story. Makes multiple playthroughs a bit arduous
-Story is pretty weak.
-Ends abruptly. Should've had more elaboration near the end 
-Sort of related to the above, but there is no option to become an ancient, even though that's something that's in the game.
-Very generous when it comes to earning stats - pretty easy to get all stats reasonably high in one playthrough.
-Earning more of a stat does nothing. Wouldn't be a huge problem, but related to the above point. You end up with monsters which are sort of same-ish in terms of stats at the end because of this. 
-No save points. 


Wasn't very impressed. Sure, this game apparently has 900 choices...but they're not very interesting. Humans come into the picture...but not to a large extent. The whole human-monster war thing seems to be the only significant part. I guess you could also count the elder part of the life cycle, but that's just isolated interactions with you. There's not much in the way of ""changing the world."" Really, it's about the ending. 

 Another thing is the game has less replay value than you think because you cannot save the game(it does so automatically), meaning if you want to see all the endings, you need to do a full playthrough. This would ordinarily not be a problem, but again, it's pretty easy to get high stats and the endings are only affected by everything after adulthood. All this means each playthrough is pretty similar to each other. If this game had a save system, you could just change your choices at the elder stage and probably see multiple endings without needing to redo the entire game. I have nothing against having to do the game again, but the tedium is what makes it a dealbreaker. 

Is ""Monster Loves You!"" a bad game? No, I actually enjoyed it somewhat. However, is the game worth the price? No, I don't think so. Maybe I'm not cut out for these type of games, but even at various discount prices, I think there are better games out there. It's the type of game you play when you don't have anything better to do, but really, doing playthroughs is pretty tedious after the first 2 or 3 times. Monster Loves You feels like the result of when you focus too much on the ""choice"" aspect of choice based games.

There are many, many reviews that mention a story, but I found none. Each moral choice question is short and disconnected from any previous choices. Also, a lot of reviews say that this game is not good for adults, at least it is good for kids. Do kids like bad gameplay more than adults? Let's see some actual positive reviews from actual kids, rather than adults telling other adults what kids should be enjoying.

General: 

Rating: T
Price: $9.99
Genre: Simulation
Time played: 23 hours

A choice based simulation of a Monster’s life.  Every decision changes who you are and your skills, and eventually will determine the fate of all Monsters. 

Gameplay - 6

There’s not much to this game, you make choices, then advance to the next stage of life and make more choices.  All these choices combined form the monster you become and affect the world around you in a myriad of ways. 

There’s a lot of choices, too many to get on 1 play through, per stage of life and each has a story of its own to tell.  There’s a lot of reading, but the game made me feel like I was playing a “Choose your own Adventure” game. The background changes depending on what stage of life you are on, but there’s not much going on graphically. 



Story -  10

You start as a small monster in the ‘spawning pit’, you make choices that helps develop your personality and characteristics. Eventually you leave there and move on to the next stage of life, more choices to be made more development.  Eventually you will reach adulthood where your personality won’t change as much per decision but your influence (respect) will grow with the other monsters.  Eventually you have a chance to become an elder, depending on your characteristics and choices you’ve made thus far you may become one, or you might dissolve back into the spawning vats to create the next generation of monsters. 

I’m skimming over a great deal but don’t want to give away too much. 

Graphics -  ??

There’s not much graphics in this game, mostly looking at a still image which changes depending on the life stage you are currently.  



Controls - 10 (mouse)

Point and click.  Click on where you want to go (usually there’s only 1 choice) then pick an adventure (10 - 20 depending on where you are in life) read the event, then use the mouse to decide a course of action. Pretty simple. 



Repeatability - 6

There’s plenty of things that can be accomplished. Not everything can be done on a single run so you’ll need to go through a few times to unlocked/see everything.  It can get repetitive and boring, since you just make the choices and things play out per a script.  But , still a cute charming little game. 

Music - ??

Atmospheric, I think it provides a nice ambient type feeling. Without it the game would be missing something, but not a lot I think. 

Multiplayer -  N/A

Initial Thoughts: 

A cute little word game.  Neat I can upgrade stats. What’s this I can interact with humans and decide how/what to do with them? Interesting… very interesting. 


Soma Says: 

A great game and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I did about 5 playthroughs, in that time i managed to befriend the humans and we lived in peace and harmony.  I also managed to destroy the humans and now the monsters reign supreme over the earth.  I managed to get myself and all other monsters enslaved as pets.  And other things that you can figure out on your own. 

The game was good, but not very action oriented. You’re mostly reading and choosing the action you think would benefit you the most on this run (Several later runs I was trying for a specific trait and would max that out ignoring (as much as possible) other traits. 

If you’re not a fan of reading and making choices, I would steer clear of this game.  If those things don’t bother you then I would say go for it and enjoy the game.

Сюжет довольно простой, поэтому игра будет идеальна для детей: она учит делать моральные выборы и справляться с последствиями. Игрок управляет монстром и сопровождает его от момента рождения до старости. Основное, чем придется заниматься в игре – читать и делать выборы между предложенными реакциями на события. Выборы влияют на черты характера монстра.  

Всего есть 5 черт: храбрость, ум, кровожадность, честность и доброта. В зависимости от решений, которые игрок принимает в ходе мини-квестов, формируется характер монстра. Он, в свою очередь, влияет на то, будут ли доступны некоторые варианты действий в текстовых квестах и как монстра будут воспринимать в обществе.

Игра разбита на уровни, каждый из которых описывает определенный этап жизни монстра – детство, юность, зрелость и так далее до статуса старейшины. За каждый уровень можно исследовать ограниченное количество мини-квестов. Изначально цель игры – развить характер монстра, а также получить признание или ненависть сообщества (дополнительная характеристика, которая может расти или уменьшаться в зависимости от принятых решений). В статусе старейшины придется, помимо прочего, учиться мирить общество монстров и общество людей и стараться угодить и тем, и другим.

В игре поднимается много сложных тем – это и вопросы самостоятельности, взросления, взаимопомощи, поведения в обществе, агрессии, расизма и толерантности. Поэтому детям игра может быть вполне интересна, а вот взрослым ее можно рекомендовать, пожалуй, только как интересный способ изучения английского.

I don't mean that as an insult, as I find the game genuinely charming, and I had a blast raising my first monster, carefully making decisions in my community to develop the way I wanted him to develop, and, ultimately, uniting the Romeo and Juliet societies at the end. What follows is where Monster Loves You is lacking. 

The game restarts, having forgotten all of what you've just done with your first monster, and having unlocked your first of (fourteen or so) endings. Your choices that meant so much for your first don't carry any weight into your subsequent playthroughs. Also, each stage of life is faced with the same scenarios you had before. You can pick different branches, but it's more or less a familiar tale. As one's fright wanes upon their second go on a spooky amusement park ride, so does one's youthful curiosity and excitement for each decision to be made. 

This is why I would suggest this game for children, or for people who don't mind revisiting familiar patterns over and over again. Children are the champions of repetition, just ask any worn out VHS copy of Shrek. Again, though, I must stress, this is [b]not[/b] a bad thing.

The music is positively whimsy gone sonar, and the backgrounds and drawings of all the other monsters are beyond adorable. Sadly, the monster you are raising doesn't seem to change with each generation; something I felt quite let down by. Though upon a replay the vignettes feel sort of stale, or unsurprising, I did honestly have a blast the first time through. The writing is great, and feels like a very well written children's or young adult book. Wonderful usage of quirky verbs and adjectives paint an image so clearly, that one forgets one is just clicking buttons on a computer screen. 

As one playthrough can take as little as 20 minutes, but hardly longer than an hour, it's quite short. If you intend to chase down each of the 10+ endings, though, that'll be a grind of a challenge. 

I really had to step away, and take my time to consider this game. Time and time again, I find myself wanting a neutral review option on Steam. We are all familiar with this problem, I imagine. Because of the lack of newness on the second go around, I hesitate to declare, ""Positive Review, buy, buy, buy it!"" 

So, consider my words as I've written them above. If you have an imaginative youngster who might be interested in playing a Choose Their Own Adventure game on their own (or as a family), I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you are interested in a single playthrough, be sure to pick it up on deep discount. If neither of those things appeal to you, pass this one over.

Pros/Cons:
+ Great writing
+ Cute graphics/background images
+ Nice system of choices-- they all affect stories/stats in different ways.  
+ Appropriate music
+ Compelling storytelling-- feels very nostalgic, like a story book.  

- Can get repetitive-- unlike a visual novel, Monster Loves You! is played in events that one chooses.  These events are not guaranteed to change from playthrough to playthrough, and 14 playthroughs add up.  
- Some endings-- the 'dissolve into...' ones-- are all very similar and a bit tedious to obtain.  
- Not a super great value for the length-- I got ~6 hours from 100%ing it, but I was only at ~4 hours when I felt 'done'.  

Overall:
Monster Loves You! is an adorable choose-your-own-adventure game.  It plays much like a storybook where not everything is illustrated.  The characters are portrayed through language and their true likeness is up to the reader's imagination.  The storytelling is really good, the events are really cute and affected by choice.

This is a short, fun game. (Less than 45 minutes for me, while taking my time.)

The graphics (which aren't really to my liking and only consist of a handful of repetitive, still images) turn out to be entirely irrelevant because this is all about the text. Much like a Choose You Own Adventure type of game you get multiple choices of how you want to react to something, which in turn determines your likelihood of succeeding.

The idea here clearly lies in making you replay the game often to explore how many different outcomes you can achieve. Not sure yet how the text will hold up to multiple revisits, but we shall see.
Luckily the story is funny, with very cute moments, so that could help with the replay value.

Being me, I only really explored the nice options during my first playthrough, though. It will be a challenge to turn brutal and ferocious and spread hate.


-------- Many years later:

A few days ago I returned to this game on a whim and now I can't seem to stop playing it. It's funny, sad, happy, and really cute. [i]Really[/i] cute. Even the graphics have grown on me, but the best thing by far has to be the music! So addictive. I would snap it up in a heartbeat, were it for sale.

When I first played this, I only did a single run. As it turns out the game improves further with replays - for me, anyway. There are so many fun scenarios and so many fun and often unexpected ways they can go.

It's true that I struggle with being mean (for certain outcomes I just have to not let the lines sink in about how I made someone cry etc), but even those branches tend to result in a giggle or a touching moment. Sometimes an option I was sure would end badly still has something wholesome to it - even if I just ate a toddler.

I am now chasing the final achievement/ending and it is not as easy as one would think. Still very relaxed and sweet to play, of course.

So, while this game might not be for everyone (which game [i]is[/i], anyway?) - if you don't mind a childlike approach mixed with more mature undertones, and if you don't mind some repetition as you explore options, if you appreciate text-based games, and if you just want to chill out with really uplifting music and zen-like musings? Then this might amuse you. :3",1519441075,1637910777,True,1,0,0.529147982597351074,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My biggest gripe is that on repeat playthroughs you will regularly encounter the same scenarios as before making it easier to cheat the system and min/max your characters personality/respect stats on subsequent playthroughs.

So it may lead to some fustrating moments as you character does the most stupidest things and you having to restart the game. Some characters are interesting, but most are forgetable.

The story was too short for me. And after going through the first playthrough I felt no need to play it again. The story is partically repeat of the story and most of your decisions don't have an impact until the end. Majority of the game is you making sure your character gains all the right stats and marks all the right check boxes before coming to a major decision point to get your desired ending.

Good concept, but there's a few issues with the game. 

Overall the game is played by telling you a story and then having you choose a response.  Everything in the game is with this system, you normally get a choice to ""go on an adventure"" and have to choose from 10 or so adventures.  You go on your adventure, get stats and start over.   If there's 10 adventures, and 8 ""days"" you will go on 80 percent of them. 

After your 8 choices, you'll evolve to the next form and continue.  This is the entire gameplay loop, while there's a few stat checks as you go on, if you play well your stats should be high enough that you seem to always succeed.  I got what I believe is the best ending (or at least the ending I wanted) on the first run.    That first run took less than an hour. 

And the second playthrough is where the problems really start. 

You see, on the second playthrough you get the option of 10 adventures again.  However it doesn't appear these 10 adventures are different, in fact the two I tried on my second playthrough (before putting the game aside for a while) was exactly the same.  This is disappointing, because it really does feel like a choose your own adventure book.  Now I realize that what I'd be asking for would be a ton of work, but for 10 bucks, you get a 30 minute adventure that an achievement hunter will have to play through 14 times if they don't make a mistake.  That's 7 hours of gameplay.  I just don't think it's 7 great hours of gameplay. 

But at the end of the day, I realize this is a choose your own adventure book in a video game form.  If that's what you're looking for, this does fit the bill, I just feel there could have been a much better more randomized game where I felt I was going on new adventures each time. 

Ultimately, I do recommend this game because the choose your own adventure is a fun take, the writing is excellent, the ability to explore the monster world is fun, and there's good characters in it.  But it is a choose your own adventure that doesn't have a wealth of gameplay or story, and for gamers, that might be a reasonable deal breaker.   But I did enjoy the time and I do look forward to a second play through trying to do something different.  I just wish I wouldn't have had to try so hard to find a new adventure.

I also would probably wait for a sale as 10 bucks is a bit pricy for this, but at the same time, it's what you want to make it.",1510265100,1510265146,True,15,0,0.717849195003509521,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Le jeu est intégralement en anglais (sans autre choix de langue), ce qui est important de rappeler, puisqu'on est là sur un jeu qui n'est que narratif. (vous n'avez pas de visuel, ou très peu, de ce que l'on vous raconte)

Graphiquement c'est très mignon, avec des monstres au design burlesque et enfantin qui m'ont rappelé le film de Pixar ""Monstre & Cie"".
L'histoire en elle-même est intéressante et il y a beaucoup de situation amusante (l'esprit du jeu reste enfantin, quand bien même on parle souvent de bouffer des humains, voir d'autres monstres, ou de gentils animaux de la forêt).
Au premier essai, je dirais que l'histoire se fait en 1 à 2 heures, en y jouant sans se précipiter.

L'histoire offre un peu plus de 5 (je ne sais plus exactement) fins possibles, certaines plus dur que d'autres à débloquer.
Niveau difficulté, c'est très casual, il n'y a pas vraiment de challenge.
Mais ce n'est pas l'idée du jeu, qui cherche surtout à vous distraire en passant un amusant moment à vivre la vie d'un monstre qui se fait sa place dans son petit village.

Pour les achievements hunter, le jeu est facile à finir à 100%, je l'ai fait en 7heures.
Ca va vite une fois qu'on a compris la mécanique.

Finalement, le point négatif qui est surement souvent relevé est la durée de vie.
Une fois qu'on a croisé les 3/4 des petites histoires du jeu, c'est sûr que la rejouabilité est faible, mais bon, c'est toujours le cas des jeux narratifs.

Il ne coûte que 10€, ce que je trouve très honnête.
Certains diront que c'est trop cher, pour un jeu qui a une durée de vie de moins de 10heures,
mais faut mettre ça en perspective...
Je rappellerai juste qu'une place de cinéma pour aller voir le dernier film Marvel (bon ou mauvais), voir une chiasse comme ""50 nuances de gay"" c'est entre 8€ et 13€ (pour les malheureux qui paient plein tarif) pour tout juste 1h à 2h de divertissement...

Donc bon...

It’s a well-polished adventure storybook game that's definitely worth a play.

The game is charming, funny and adorable, tells a great story of your own partial making and displays a great visual art style.  The choices you make (initially) feel unique and personal. The soundtrack fits the game just right and provides helpful atmosphere.

The only issue is that it's not really worth playing more than one time since in order to get unique endings you have to click through tons of sections you’ve already seen before. Endings are usually only a few clicks away from each other and sometimes require a few small difference in choices throughout a playthrough.

I would recommend it if you can find it for a bit cheaper or if there’s someone special you’d want to share the experience with.

Le jeu est divisé en chapitres, ""les âges de la vie"", et en épisodes ""aventures"", qui déterminent les compétences de votre monstre, en fonctions de vos choix.

Bien que lors d'un premier essai, j'aie essayé les choix qui me plaisaient le plus (grosso modo, être gentil, honnête et prudent), on se retrouve vite à faire les choix nécessaire à l'atteinte d'une certaine fin. 
Le jeu est devenu pour moi alors plutôt un jeu de gestion des compétences du personnage. 

C'est une conséquence récurrente des jeux à fins multiples que de vouloir absolument chercher toutes les fins, et de sacrifier l'impression d'importance des choix, à sa curiosité. Très souvent, la rejouabilité immédiate m'empêche un réel investissement dans le choix, qui m'apparaît alors banal. C'est aussi le cas pour ce jeu.

Ce n'est pas grave en soit, mais j'avais espéré un impact moral plus profond, à la manière d'un conte de fée, comme le jeu s'inspire explicitement de ce genre.
 En somme, il n'y avait pas de tension narrative, comme dans certains aventures à choix que j'ai pu expérimenté gratuitement comme ""Who is Mike"", ""Rising Angels Reborn"" et ""The Bottom of the Well"" (disponibles gratuitement sur Steam). 

Monsters Love You! en fait plutôt une histoire simple, mignonne et parfois rigolote certes, mais qui ne vaut pas à mon avis le prix demandé à la base.

The writing is clever and the outcome of your choices can be surprising at times.  Each playthrough of the game you get a handful of scenerios to choose from to establish your monster's character and hopefully survive to the next stage.  Because the scenerios offered are randomized, and there are more scenerios offered at each stage than turns you take, every game will play out differently making each playthrough an unique story.  It's not the kind of game where you know how to get the next ending by simply altering one or two choices from one playthrough to the next.

I have played through this title over and over and I never get tired of just trying one more time.  There are 14 ending achievements to try and get, but because of the variety and randomization of each playthough it can be hard to figure out how to get all of them.

The whole visual novel genre feels like the perfect place to revive stories like that, but it hasn't really happened in any conspicuous way. Monster Loves You! is like a lot of those little adventures and choices rolled into a big, gooey, adorable ball, which is probably why I found it so engrossing. It's not quite on the level of those literary odysseys of old, but its monstrous heart is in the right place.

The game cold-opens with you being formed in a spawning pool, as all monsters are. Through some initial choices you set the foundations for what kind of monster you'll become, and learn a little about the monster life cycle. From these sticky beginnings you guide your monster though childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and beyond by making decisions during key events in their life. These decisions affect a number of stats which define your monster, and later in life determine what they are capable of and what kind of ending they can achieve.

This might sound a bit heavy so let's dial it back to the part where you're eating garbage and scaring goats. All of these life-altering decisions come in the midst of monsters chewing on each others' heads, pranking each other, and screaming until their ears bleed. The quirky, friendly tone of the writing makes it clear this is a cartoony take on life (as if the vibrant art didn't give it away), and also takes the pressure off of making bad decisions. Nearly everything you do will raise at least one of your stats, though there are rare choices that do nothing or even lower stats a tiny bit.

Your monster is scored by percentage on their Cleverness, Honesty, Bravery, Ferocity, and Kindness. Presented with dilemmas like tricking, scaring, or helping a friend should lead to obvious increases in the corresponding stats. That's actually one thing I want to commend Monster Loves You! for, how clear the results of a choice will be from how it's presented. Other visual novel adventures like Vlad the Impaler don't really give any clues as to how a scene will affect you but all the choices here feel very well telegraphed, enough to easily max more than one stat without any prior knowledge. And once a stat is maxed, it opens up some new options depending on the situation.

Mechanically, there's very little else to the game besides making text choices. Each stage of your life has a number of days to while away, and on each of those you choose an activity. Activities are shown only as icons so you'll never be sure what's going to happen until you've been through them once before, a bit of a contrast from how clear the actual choices are. At the end of the third stage (adulthood) there's a check to see if you can proceed to the final stage, which offers some additional choices and a proper conclusion to the story of the monsters as a whole. It's all quite gratifying to work through, really, given how much thought and detail was put into constructing the monster world and society.

Running though one monster life should only take 30 to 40 minutes, and after that you'll pretty much be chasing endings and achievements. It won't take you long to recognize the same events coming up and start clicking through them madly so don't bank on a ton of replay value here. There is value to be had, though, in the charming writing and visuals that welcome you to the strange and wonderful world of family-friendly monsters. As long as you're not expecting anything sprawling or epic, Monster Loves You! is a fine little diversion that brings back the charm of choosing your own adventures.

So my latest completed games has been some short ones. I've been pretty busy lately. 
But I'm playing for the adventure, story and experience - And I don't necessary need a lot of hours in-game to have that. 

Dejobaan Games' ""Monster loves you!"" is one of those games. 
I bought it on steam sale, the other day after having it on my wishlist for too long. 

It was not what I was expecting, but that doesn't need to be a bad thing.

Some endings are slightly harder to get than others in the beginning.

And I love this game in return. It's a bit of a choose-your-own adventure game, a point-and-click title to be sure, and if that isn't your kind of game, you may not enjoy Monster Loves You!. It's short, too -- you can get through a game pretty quickly, and there's also a ton of reading to be done since the majority of the game is conveyed through text.

But-- that said, this game is still absolutely delightful for what it is, and if this IS your kind of game, you're going to have an amazing time. 

Visually, the game is delightful and eye-catching. The art style lends itself very well to the game and the stories that unfold, in my opinion! The music and sound effects are also perfectly on-point, as well, and honestly the main menu music is really good, it's something I listen to by itself because it's so peaceful. The design work that went into Monster Loves You! has not gone unappreciated as far as I'm concerned.

Mechanically, the game works by giving you different actions you can take at various stages of your Monster's life. There are MANY different choices you can make that infleunce your monster's growth, and each one has bearing on not just your stats, but on both your own life and the lives of your fellow monsters. Each time you play, it's a unique experience -- there are so many different events that can happen and choices to make that it keeps things fresh well into multiple playthroughs. Your choices really do have impact and shape how you grow up and how you can later impact the world, and the monster you grow into being will depend entirely on the choices you make. The number of things you can choose to influence the story, the different ways you can ultimately shape the world if you choose -- it's really special.

For those who are interested in them, there are Achievements for completing the game in numerous different ways, and that can incentivize a person to keep playing and to see what more the game has to offer.

At the end of the day, Monster Loves You! isn't a game for everyone. It's a mostly text-based adventure, it doesn't have multiplayer, and it gets repetetive over successive playthroughs.

But it's also a solid game, and it will hold your attention while you play it. It is polished and charming, and even in 2017, the devs are still maintaining and improving it. It is a robust experience for what it is, and even if it's not for everyone -- for those who did take an interest, well, I can at least personally say that I had a ton of fun with this game, and I still pick it up now and again because the world the developers have crafted is nothing if not endearing. It is FUN -- and sometimes that's all a game needs to be. Monster loves you is fun, and well-made, and it's funny and quirky and, at times, poignant, too. It is a well-made experience that puts a smile on your face when you play it, and I think that's a pretty great accomplishment.

-each play through takes around 45 minutes
-graphics are nice

[h1] PROS [/h1]

-Cute art style! Very kid friendly and appealing. It's endearing. I wish there was MORE art to look at though, as most of the game is text based. I could see this being a book series for kids! :)

-Simple and easy to follow, again it's very kid friendly. I didn't have any confusion or difficulty understanding what to do, and the text is written in easy enough terms. However, it's not ""too simple.""

-More on the story text. It goes into just enough detail to weave together a nice story, without being overly complex. It's all about monsters so it can be a bit ""gross"" and ""cartoonish violence"" at times, but it's not disturbing or anything. It has a very whimsical charm to it. I know I've said this already, but it's probably aimed more for 8-12 yr old age range. But as a 25 yr old adult, I still enjoyed it. :)

-Multiple endings and many personal choices. I had fun seeing 2 different endings. It's short enough to run through 2-3 times in one night if you felt like it. So it wouldn't be too much for a kid to handle.

[h1] CONS [/h1]

-As I said.... it's for kids. So you might not enjoy it fully as an adult. The dialogue, story, art etc. is all aimed for a younger audience. 

-That said, the multiple choice endings are a bit shallow. There's no real point playing more than 2-3 times. I don't see myself grinding for achievements.

-It's more of a visual novel then a game. There's minimal animations, which is a shame because the art style is very charming. It's mostly just point n click, reading text, and using your imagination (which is not so much of a bad thing!)

[h1] OVERALL SCORE: 7/10 [/h1]

I'd pick this up on sale, if you have kids, or are new to the whole idea of choice based story games. It's a simple and cute way to get into the genre.

I had the initial impression that it was a point-n-click adventure, but that was very wrong.

The game play revolves around making choices. There are no puzzles of any sort in the game. The gameplay consists of clicking on different icons that start an event that then present different choices for you to pick. The first two thirds of the game incentives building up all your stats as best as you can so that you can eventually become an elder. I failed the first time through and returned to the goo from whence I came to pass on memories to future generations. You can think of those failures as premature endings with little variation depending on your main stat.

My second playthrough was more successful though and I became elder. I decided that I wanted peace between humans and monsters which was easy enough to do since I knew what to do to build up my stats very high all around. The ending variations at this point are much more interesting than the goo type. Unfortunately, while there are some funny or interesting moments, the game’s overall writing wasn’t really compelling. There was hardly a resolution in place for the peaceful ending I acquired which made it feel abrupt.

Replaying the game isn't very attractive since the CYOA aspect is heavily dictated by the desire to max your stats versus making interesting choices. What I mean is, any choice you pick that might seem fun or logical can feel wasted if you could've gained much more by making the ""correct"" choice. There are plenty of endings to collect for those that don't mind going through the same events over and over. In comparison, I thought Choice of Robots had a more interesting way of making game altering choices from earlier on which kept my engaged for many more playthroughs. I felt satisfied after only two rounds with MLY!.

Monster Loves You! is merely an okay game and does seem geared toward a younger audience.

As a whole, it clearly is more of a textual rpg rather than a 2D videogame. There aren't many backgrounds at all, and nearly all of the time you'll be busy getting through the challenges, which are all presented in a textual manner.

+ Pretty enjoyable if you've never played a text-only Choose Your Own Adventure game before. My one previous attempt, The Forest of Doom, felt much more tedious and ended prematurealy.

It's not the same as an exploration game where you punch in keywords or try to work your way around somewhere.

The time it takes to complete the actual game is 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how fast you're picking options and reading. Technically, you can fly through it in approximately 15 minutes or less if you know what events and choices you want. Each achievement for the game is completing it with a new ending, and when you replay, the events don't change unless you trigger something specific at the first endgame point.

If you care about getting the achievements, you can reuse saves as some guides explain. It really is not that worthwhile to replay it 14 full times because more than half of those times you'll be choosing the exact same actions.

I thought the game looked a bit interesting in drawing style, hence why I got it. But it turns out that there really aren't that many different graphical screens. And most of the time, they're just shadowed out because of the text boxes, sitting on top of the screen for you to read and decide upon.

Your monster has a set of stats that you can increase as you choose certain events, and the game's ending is determined essentially by those stats, as well as a few other endgame choices. No event until the ""final"" age event actually triggers the ending. Thus, the game fits an exact carbon-copy mold of the same general things happening over and over, which also adds to your boredom and the game's lack of fun replayability.

Going through the adventure of the game was just really disappointing, as not many of the events are that exciting. The developer's claim of the 900+ choices is quite an exaggeration, since most events don't differ by much at all with their choices. And the fact that it's an extremely short story means that it doesn't require any investment or make you even care about what is happening.",1481948776,1481949564,False,8,0,0.552579522132873535,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Let’s get rocking.

The Good

It’s hard to classify what genre this game should fall into (gameplay wise) as it is very similar to a visual novel, but it does have aspects of an RPG. Whatever it is, it does a good job of being what it is. MLY! has a lot of possible endings and a lot of ways to get to those endings. Naturally, this provides a lot of replay value, which is always a good thing.

The artwork in the game is consistently charming. It is kid friendly (some of the content may be a bit darker for younger audiences. just so you know) and vibrantly colored.

The game as a whole, I think, is very creative. You, as the player, experience the entire lifespan of a monster from spawning to death. What events fill the time in between those two are entirely up to you. Every choice you make in the game not only counts, but very significantly impacts your late and end game.

The Bad

Go ahead and scroll on past this one.

The Meh

If you’re not really a fan of reading, this may not be the game for you.

If you’re looking for a gory, violent game about being a monster, this may not be the game for you.

Verdict: Yea

All in all, Monster Loves You! is a fun, lighthearted game that, I think, anyone can enjoy playing.

About this game:

A text game basicaly where you are a mosnter born and then get thrown into different situations. Problem is, this particular game is buggy. For example, the ending just freezes up the the game. As much as i want to upvote this...in good conscious i cannot due to it being buggy. If you still want to try it, it is somewhat fun if it was not for the bugs. I suggest if you want to try it, wait for a sale to buy it.

Also, there is a repition issue. The game store page states the game changes storyline every time you play, but it really does not. It just rehases it over and over again in different situations...sure it is fun for like 2 rounds of it, but it gets old very fast.

Ultimately I cannot recommend this game for the price given its limited gameplay and repetitiveness.

Most 'levels' have you choose something like 12 or 14 actions out of 15 to 18 options. So even in a single playthrough, you are going through like 80%+ the options. Most actions are not complex enough to have more than 2 or 3 outcomes, so it really limits replayability. It makes completing the primary goal, which is getting all the endings, quite the chore.

It has a ton of compelling visuals that tie a lot of the lore together. THere are a lot of positives about this game: the textual descriptions are detailed and tie the various approaches to the story together. THE main negative to this game, s many have stated, is the length. It is a rather short game for 10 bucks, especially if you're looking to play through it once. It's value lies in multiple playthroughs. Experimenting with different character builds is where this game shines. exploring the different options the game gives you  is a very fun experience.

The options vary and change for every new game, though i will admit getting achievements was more grinding through the game over and over and did get tiring after a while. A good thing about the game is its varied endings, there are the endings in which you choose to dissolve{though i'm afraid that once you've dissolved once the others are practically the same thing for the other traits} and endings where you ascend to elder status - these are actually a little different every time.

The other sneaky options and secret endings were quite fun to try and figure out though, the neurosurgeon one was pretty cool.

Simple, but deceptively replayable. It's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, starting you as a monsterling that was just born. With multiple stats (initially at zero), your actions will lead to the community respecting you (or not) and increasing statistical values about your personality (bravery, cleverness, etc.).

This is simple but, again, rather adictive. After 6 hours and about 8 (?) playthroughs I'm still getting newer and newer stories as I go along, which adds the replay value of the game (besides the fact that it possesses 14(!!) ending, to my knowledge).

Graphically it's just multiple backgrounds with no real animations (unless you click your monster avatar, which will make him jump and say weird shit xD), so to review graphics, I'd really review one thing:

[h1]UI (INTERFACE)[/h1]

Nothing short of great. Buttons are clear, with something indicating what the story behind each clickable button may consist of. A scared monster face may lead to a story about investigating a human house, for example. Nothing more to say, really, informative, simple and slick, the UI excells in this adventure game unlike for of its genre.

[h1]AUDIO[/h1]

With no voice acting, that leads the music which is kind of a few tracks that repeat themselves. They are pretty good and chilling, suiting the happy and cute atmosphere the game transmits.

[h1]STORY[/h1]

Barely got anything to say about it:

You start -> You're born.
Game ends -> You[spoiler] shifted the course of the world, creating an endless war between monsters and humans, or united them into one civilization filled with compassion and honor between eachother. OR you simply died, recognized for the trait you leveled up the most (braveness for example).[/spoiler]

This allows for alot of replayability considering you like the style and the atmosphere of the game. Since it's pretty much YOUR story, relatability to the main character resides in you and only you. It's well done and the cuteness of your activities, monster reactions, UI design and drawing [b] give the game a MASSIVE boom of charm and interest to the player. This is precisely where you'll find the best part of the game. The juxtaposition of the charming style and the story make the game worth, in my opinion a purchase at any price equal or below its base one (9,99€).[/b]

The emoticons are expensive as fuck, tho. Anyway, I digress. Game's fully worth it for it's uniqueness among the genre. A solid 8/10 for me!

[h1]P.S: Kinda weird steam updated it's review system and forgot the much asked ""meh button"", the score system introduction and all that...[/h1]

The game is amazing and has nothing to do with said ""Meh"" button, but still... this review system still feels rather barebones and Valve sure has the potential to make this a great environment for a complex but useful review system (since any idiot can hop on Metacritic for example and bash a game they don't like, like Call of Duty (and that does happens to CoD, we all know it!)).

The game consists of many small storylets which you can choose a respone to, and are then rewarded with stat points corresponding to that response. These stat points make up the “personality” of your monster, and later may determine how much other monsters respect you, and ultimately your ending.

I generally like things like raising sims and CYOA games, so I was kind of surprised by how little I enjoyed this game. Overall, I see two major issues with it: it lacks meaningful choices, and it’s too long for what it is. Most of the storylets described rather mundane events (i.e. should I save my friend from bullies, or join in on beating him up), so seeing alternative resolutions to those wasn’t especially interesting. And there doesn’t appear to be any real consequence to raising a ferocious monster versus a kind monster, aside from gathering achievements.

CYOA-type stat building games can be fun if they don’t overstay their welcome (for example, The YAWHG), but I found myself getting pretty bored by about the halfway point of each playthrough of this game.

Bardzo często gry tego typu określa się mianem point&click, co w tym przypadku oznacza iż całość rozgrywki polega na wskazywaniu i zatwierdzaniu wybranych przez nas odpowiedzi bezpośrednio wpływających na los naszego bohatera.

W grze wcielamy się w tytułowego potwora i od momentu jego urodzin kształtujemy jego osobowość. To bardzo wciągająca rola, możemy wybierać odpowiedzi, które będą zgodne z naszym własnych uznaniem lub starać się je dobierać tak aby nasza postać uzyskała pożądane cechy. Konsekwencją wyboru może być, choć nie musi, otrzymanie lub utrata punktów przydzielanych do danej cechy charakteru. W ten sposób na końcu gry możemy stworzyć potworniastego przytulaka, inteligentną bestię, silnego i nieustraszonego bohatera lub krwiożerczą bestię, oczywiście wariacji jest dużo, dużo więcej i uzyskanie ich wszystkich jest naprawdę trudne.

Grafika gry jest kreskówkowa, ładna ale mocno statyczna, można powiedzieć że przyjemna dla oka, udźwiękowienie niczym specjalnym się nie wyróżnia, jest poprawne, muzyka jest zapamiętywalna i wpada w ucho. Gra owocuje w wiele zabawnych sytuacji i komentarzy co czyni ją ciekawą i bardzo wciągającą. Nasze wybory mimo dużego skupienia na naszej postaci często nie dadzą zamierzonego rezultatu i by wykreować docelowego potworka trzeba zagrać wielokrotnie. Choć gra moim zdaniem jest zdecydowanie za krótka, gorąco polecam ją wszystkim miłośnikom tego typu produkcji. 

Wskazówka:
Aby uzyskać bardzo jednolitą postać należy ukierunkować swoje wszystkie wypowiedzi w ten sam sposób, tzn jeśli chcesz by Twój potwór był krwiożerczą bestią wybieraj tylko najbardziej kontrowersyjne i brutalne odpowiedzi.

Monster Loves You! - prosta przygodowa gra typu click&point, obsadzona w kreskówkowej grafice, w której nasze decyzje wywierają ogromny wpływ na rozwój naszego potwora. Chcesz, aby Twoja postać była okropnym tyranem, który zabije wszystko co się rusza? Inteligentnym stworzeniem, którego inteligencja przewyższa nawet IQ najmądrzejszych ludzi? A może uczciwy i pomocny stwór, który nie znosi zła? Wszystkie te cechy i wiele innych możemy wykreować swoim potworzastym stworzeniem!

Zapraszam do obserwowania mojej strony [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33268259-Krasny-Feuilleton/]KURATORA[/url], aby być na bieżąco ze wszystkimi recenzjami!

[h1]Grywalność[/h1]
Jest to typowy click&point, w którym to my jesteśmy 'mózgiem' naszego stworzenia, którym kierujemy jeszcze od ""narodzenia"". Zasadniczo gra jest na jeden raz, ponieważ to wtedy najbardziej wczuwamy się w losy naszego potwora, często starając się utworzyć go na swoją podobiznę. Przyjemna w swojej prostocie, zaskakuje nas często swoimi nieprzewidywalnymi zwrotami wydarzeń i przedziwnymi sytuacjami, gdzie nie wiemy jak zareagować. Wciąga na krótko, aby zabić trochę wolnego czasu.

[h1]Dźwięki[/h1]
O dźwiękach w grze zasadniczo wiele nie można powiedzieć, ponieważ całość gry opiera się na jej czytaniu i reagowaniu w pewnych sytuacjach, wybierając odpowiednie wg naszego uznania przyciski. Muzyka jest prosta, przyjemna, lecz czasami może być monotonna. W zależności od sytuacji, bądź przygody jaką wybierzemy zmienia się w pożądany klimat rozgrywki.

[h1]Grafika[/h1]
Monster Loves You! oferuje nam rysunkową grafikę, która jest w dość ładny sposób przedstawiona. Bardzo fajnie narysowane potwory, które jak widać wykorzystują sporą część wyobraźni rysownika. Jest przyjemna i miła dla oka.

[h1]Fabuła[/h1]
Fabuły w grze oczywiście nie można określić mianem liniowej, ponieważ to my decydujemy jak toczą się losy rozgrywki. Jednak nie ma większego znaczenia to co uznamy na słuszne względem późniejszych możliwości do wyboru. W grze, na każdym etapie życia naszego potwora mamy określoną liczbę dni na jej rozwój, które są równoznaczne z ilością wydarzeń jakie możemy przeżyć/wybrać. Rozgrywkę możemy zakończyć już wcześniej, jeżeli zdecydujemy, że nasza postać nie nadaje się do dorosłego życia, topiąc ją i roztwarzając w głębokiej ""misce"" z zieloną substancją - prawdopodobnie kwasem. Brzmi brutalnie, jednak to my musimy się dostosować do kultury jaka panuje w Potwornej Rasie. Rozgrywka może nas również doprowadzić do różnych zakończeń fabuły. Od protokooperacji potworów z ludźmi, przez bycie ""pluszowym"" niewolnikiem człowieka, aż po dominację potworów nad całą planetą (bądź też nawet wyginięcia całej potworzastej rasy).

Being short and shallow is forgivable, but an added lack of replayability should put anyone off the 10 euro price tag.

In any other story game, what you do locks you into a distinct route through the story. Befriended a certain character, choose to pick up a sword and take the route through the creepy forest? You can be sure that character will remember, you're more likely to become a swordfighter and you might learn something in the forest that you can use later on. Sure, there might be some statistics involved, as you'll need strength to handle your sword and maybe at least 20+ survivalism to make it through the forest, but these are the things that bind you to the story. It sets you on a certain path that creates a mood, an understanding of the world, expectation of what happens next and gets you exclusive endings unavailable somewhere else that makes you feel like it was worth investing. It makes you feel the game/story recognizes you and entertains you with how it accomadates your unique choices and personality. 

Monster loves You has none of that. The game has three to four chapters, one for each stage of your life. In each stage, you have the choice out of some 20 adventures, with you having the time to go on some 12. All of them are already unlocked straight from the get go and they have no bearing on what kind of monster you are or on what what choices you've made before as a story. Being the goal of the game, they each raise your stats by a bit and by the third chapter certain adventures require your stats to be at a certain level before you can succeed to gain... more stats. By the fourth chapter, you can proceed to use your stats to crudely manipulate the outcome of the game and get the different endings by... raising or lowering new stats with the correct stats. 

You can randomly kill one day and spare the other. You can get nearly killed by humans at the start of your life and then get a happy ending with the humans at the end, without any explanation. It just is... because of stats. Other monsters don't actively recognize your past actions. As long as you pick the right buttons to make the correct gauges go up, and regardless of who you are, you can work yourself up towards any available outcome. Sure, sticking to a specific personality gets you furthest, but only because you can't possibly level all the stats and being consistent at least raises enough of them to succeed to pass checks. 

It deprives the game of personality and the feeling you're interacting with a living world, when the two of you simply don't react to each other in a way that is based on story. 


That said, the game looks okay if you like the artstyle and I can vouch that the writing is actually kind of great, but as a game or an interactive story, it fails abysmally with shallow mechanics.",1450449259,1450449259,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Style is cute and also the soundtrack is very nice.
Maybe the only one minus in the game is that there's so much text to read and you can't really interact with anything and it might get boring in a while. Otherwise I really enjoyed playing it.

The actions you take allow you to accumulate points which determine your most prominent personality traits: bravery, honesty, kindness, ferocity and cleverness. You must also gain respect from other monsters in order to ascend to Elder status - the final stage of the game in which you influence the fate of human and monster relations.

Nie ma co oczekiwać po niej skomplikowanej rozgrywki - cały schemat opiera się na kreowaniu swojej osobowości i dorastaniu poprzez przechodzenie kolejnych, krótkich przygód. Podejmujemy w nich wybory, które mogą (ale nie muszą) odbić się na pięciu wskaźnikach osobowości - odwadze, inteligencji, dzikości, szczerości, życzliwości oraz na szacunku jakim darzy nas społeczeństwo Potworów. 
W sumie taką przygodę można ukończyć w mniej niż godzinę, jeśli nie bawi was powtarzanie niektórych rzeczy po raz kolejny, ale moim zdaniem warto. Niektóre decyzje podejmowane w przełomowych momentach mogą skutkować bardzo różnymi zakończeniami (tak, można umrzeć po 20 minutach grania :D), satysfakcjonujące jest docieranie do samego końca po przejściu Monsterlinghood, Adulthood i Elderhood, tam też decyzje skutkują różnymi zakończeniami, na które wpływ ma nie tylko to, co zdecydujemy, ale też nasza ukształtowana we wcześniejszych etapach osobowość, szacunek oraz nastroje panujące w tym potworzym społeczeństwie.
Każde zakończenie nagradzane jest osiągnięciem, w sumie jest ich 14. 
Mini-przygody są losowane z większej puli, więc może zdarzyć się, że kilka z nich się powtórzy, ale na pewno nie będzie to ciągle ten sam scenariusz.

Monster Loves You! is a story-driven choice-based game where you play a newborn monster. You're tasked with answering a few questions and solving a few problems in order to determine a personality. Your personality is essentially your skills, and how you answer the problems and questions will determine your skill level. The skills are things like Honesty, Bravery, etc. and will be increased/decreased by how you respond to situations in the game.

The game is strangely addictive and I find myself wanting to see all the endings. 

The UI looks and feels like a mobile app. It consists of large, easy to press, buttons on a simple background. The buttons come in two different types, pictures which are somehow related to an action, and dialogue for different choices and tests. 

The game play is simple, you click a button, read some text, and see how your choices modify your stats. You go through several development phases, starting as a baby slime and moving up through full fledged elder monster. If you make it to the end, you can decide the fate of monsters and humans.

The choices and options can get repetitive over multiple playthroughs. This is particularly frustrating since auto-saving means you you need to start from the beginning each time you attempt to get a new ending. As there are 14 different endings, I really wish there was some sort of save or rewind functionality so that you could skip the earlier phases. 

As long as you don’t mind eating children or kittens it's a good game to kill some time.

Monster Loves You is a charming little choose your own adventure game in which you develop a monster from birth to death, or even beyond when it's death should have come, if you play your cards right. The whole story is played through reading little vignettes about moments in your monster's life then deciding what it's going to do at that moment. When it's still a baby your choices will mostly just effect its own personality, but as it gets older the things you decide will also come to determine how much other monsters respect it and eventually how well their tribe gets along with their closest neighbors.

The game contains much more replay value than you might expect; you never get enough turns in a stage of life to pick every story to read through and it's also randomly (as far as I can tell) chosen what stories will be available for you in each new game, so if you start a new playthrough you'll find plenty of new scenarios to play through as well as being able to make different choices in ones you've drawn before.

You begin life in a bizzare monster birth from a vat of slime, and progress through senility (if you live that long). While fun and interesting at first, this game quickly becomes repetetive and is easily completed in less than half an hour if you read fast. I've played the game about an hour or so total, and I've beaten it at least three times. Once you've beaten the game once, you can play through it again rather quickly, as many of the options are the same throughout the game and once you've read them the first time, there's no real reason to read them again. All in all, it's a fun time waster, but with limited replay value. I recommend it if you can find it on sale and want a VERY light visual novel to play around with. It's a lot of fun and there are some good humorous bits, but overall it's a pretty ordinary game.

On the whole this is a cute, fun and at times funny game, but if you are trying to get all the endings I'd recommend leaving the game awhile inbetween each playthrough. The reason is that even though you don't always get the same quests, after awhile they do start to repeat...so after the first couple of playthroughs it gets a bit, well, repetitive .

You grow older, and there are many more adventures to follow. Will the other monsters respect you? And how do humans view monsters and visa versa? You can decide that with your own behaviour in the stories. 

The game is not very long, I think you can complete one story in 45 minutes. Luckily, the game has a high replayability due to the multiple endings. The stories where you can choose from are amusing to read. 
The artstyle looks cartoony and I think it looks very cute as well. The slow paced music fits the game perfectly, because it is a cute but relaxing tune.

I would recommend to buy this game in a sale. It is a good game if you want to take a break from all the fastpaced games.

This game is very unique. The art and soundtrack are charming, the story is intriguing, and it's very replayable. There isn't really much for gameplay, being that the game is mostly decision making, which is by no means a bad thing. It'll take you at least a while to get all the endings, and even then there is just a bunch of different things that can happen. The writing is very humorous and clever, and the whole style of the game is charming. 

There are 5 different stages in this game: Morsel, Kid, Adolescent, Adult, and then Elder. Each of them have some differences. The 1st stage is very short, and will also determine a large part of what happens later in the game. The second stage doesn't have any major twists, although your traits (kindness, cleverness, honesty, etc.) will develop much more rapidly, which makes this a good chance to get a headstart on what traits you want more of. The third stage is much like the previous, but the story is more open, because you aren't in the brood cave the whole time like you were in the second stage. This stage takes a few more days and you become a little bit less impressionable, as well as it being much more likely to lose parts of your traits as well as gain them. There is a few chances of respect being earned in this stage, but it will not be majorly used until adulthood and elder. Similar to the other stages, the fourth stage takes the longer than any of the other ones. This stage is more free because you can decide whether to socialize with other monsters, or go out and adventure. During this stage you will be much less impressionable, and your traits will probably stay mostly the same. You will also rack up respect. Respect is very important as in most cases, it will determine your fate. Once adulthood is over, you will start to realize that your life is coming to an end and you have to make a few decisions, if you want to try to live, if you will dissolve, if you will ascend, etc. Once you go back to the spawning vat you will be confronted by elders. You can dissolve, or try to ascend into an elder. This part is kind of complicated, so I'll just sum it up. If you dissolve you will end your game right there, but if you try to become an elder you will have a chance to be tested. If you fail the test or dissolve, you will dissolve, but if you complete the test you will move onto being an elder. Once you become an elder, it's up to you to determine whether to fight the humans, make peace, etc. (Or become a neurosurgen.) This stage is probably the most unique for a few reasons. It adds two new factors, Humans opinion on monsters and vice versa. By the end of the stage the percentages and a few last decisions will determine how the game ends. Besides that, most decisions will require a trait. So you will have a better chance to complete something that requires more ferocity if you have 90% compared to 30%, adding a more rpgish aspect into the game, making the elder stage even more interesting.


Sorry if this was more a guide than it was a review, but I hope it helps. This game is great, and I really love a lot about it. Of course there are downsides to a few things, like not as much character establishment, and things like that. Another thing about the game is that the story is VERY open-ended, almost everything is determined through your choices, which might explain why there's not as much character development. Other then that, this is a very unique concept and was very well executed. The game is charming, funny, replayable, and even at some times heartwrenching. And I would love to see a sequel to this game, because it really deserves it. It's definitely worth the money, so buy it and give it a try.",1423878155,1423878155,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.

This short, light hearted narritave driven game aims to tell a notably different story every playthrough based on your actions.

One's actions have little effect on future story arcs, with only the occasional action which benefits from high stats in certain areas.  Additionally, the overarching plot is weak.  It lacks substance.  Very little that happens in the tiny sub-arcs actually seem related to the main story-line at all, and the climax of the game seems to have little to no build up.  It just suddenly happens after you've complete the requisite amount of missions.  Every aspect of the game I can think to name lacks depth:  the interactive elements, the characters, the story, the visuals (there are only a few images used the entire game).

- The premise is cute and funny.
- The cartoony artwork perfectly matches the tone of the game, and the randomly generated character designs help keep each playthrough fresh.
- The music is relaxing, yet upbeat.
- The gameplay is simple, revolving entirely around text trees, but it effectively facilitates a successful choose-your-own adventure.  
- There are a huge array of quests programmed into the game, and you will get a slightly different mix of options each time you play.  I have run through the game 15 times, and have yet to explore every scenario, let alone every dialogue option of every scenario.
- The humour is great.  It can be a bit crass or gross at times, but you *are* playing as a monster.
- I like that you can mold your character's personality as you go, so if you don't want to be a mean monster you don't have to be.
- Each game takes just 15-60 minutes (depending on how fast you are clicking through the text), so it doesn't feel like a slog to keep trying for new endings.  Also, it is great to play as a virtual palate cleanser in between other games.

As the write up states - it's a choose your own adventure.  

The game have basically five phases (birth, child, adolescent, adult, elder).   Each phase has ""mini adventures"" from which to choose and then options within the adventures.  The choices drive your ""personality""  

Good - the little adventures are amusing and there's a semi randomness to what gets offered as a selection in each phase that lends to some replayability.  There are 14 possible outcomes for the end game.  It takes about 10-15 hours of game play to achieve all 14 outcomes. 

My criticism is with the choices lacking materiality on the final outcome.  The choices cause the trait percentages to vary. Basically you get about 30 or so choices and find they lead to one final choice yielding your outcome - you could choose the same 30 adventures/same choices every play through, get to 80% in every trait and about 70% in respect.  (not that you'd do that, but you could and it would not restrict final outcome overly much at all other than neurosurgeon and modest legacy).  

Basically the choices at birth/child/teen just arent material enough.  They should cause the final outcomes to be far more restrictve and potentially open up new content.  Instead  all forks in the path lead to what is effectively a common point.  

My second criticism would be the elder phase -  the choices are mundane - one choice will pretty much cause How monsters/humans view one another to go up and the other cause it to go down.  The phase is akin to clicking ""help"" or ""sabotage"" buttons 15 times in a row.  The adventures themselves were creative but the choice selections and how they cause """"your own adventure"" to evolve in my view lacked creativity.  

Summary - The mini adventures are quite amusing but other aspects of the game are lacking.   

For 2-3$ and the replayability of seeing how each choice affects your traits it gets a borderline thumbs up.

其它方面的话……画面是儿童画风格，还算整齐干净；音乐感觉和游戏稍微有点不搭，但是还算好听，至少能记住一些旋律；里面的表情超级好，推荐收一套自己用，其它就没了。

总体来说是个还可以的休闲小品，闲着没事干的时候打一打也不错，不过就不要有太高期待了……当然，依然不建议原价买。

Avez-vous lu ma review pour The Yawhg (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ny-Nady/recommended/269030/) ? Non ? Dommage car ici ce sera quasiment la même chose.

Monster Loves You! est un jeu mignon, sympathique, enfantin et hyper accessible (qu'en anglais par contre). Le menu est choupinou comme tout et on se fait très vite une idée du plot : on va élever un petit monstre tout mignon et décider de sa vie jusqu'à ce qu'il devienne vieux. Super c'est Princess Maker mais on remplace les petites filles par des pitits monstres ! (et on enlève l'inceste) Bref, ça promet. J'adore vraiment les jeux au gameplay ""minimaliste"" (que ce soit sous forme de visual novel ou de livre dont vous êtes le héros que je bouffe à n'en plus finir et que je peux recommencer 30 fois), autant dire que je suis pile le public visé. Mais au final, je me demande vraiment QUI peut vraiment être emballé par ce jeu.

Expliquons rapidement. Votre petit monstre est né, bravo ! (NDLR : vous êtes le monstre) Maintenant, c'est parti faut vivre et s'adapter à la société des monstres. Allez-vous tout bouffer ? Faire des câlins ? Pleurer ? Voler les autres ? Plein de choix sous forme de texte vont se présenter à vous pendant quelques minutes. Des stats vont augmenter/baisser (ça augmente beaucoup plus que ça baisse honnêtement). Bref, vous connaissez le truc. Pour l'instant, les stats n'ont AUCUNE incidence sur ce qu'il se passe. En gros, vous augmentez/baissez des stats un peu random (gentillesse, intelligence, férocité...) sans trop savoir à quoi ça sert ?? Niveau graphisme, vous avez juste un fond statique. Et y a une musique en boucle aussi. Voilà voilà.

SOUDAIN le narrateur te dit que ton monstre a grandi et qu'on passe à une prochaine phase ! Grosse hype. Sauf qu'on va faire la même chose qu'avant. Seule différence : on a le choix parmi des ""aventures"" (sous formes de petites images rondes sans intitulé) qui sont des petits événements très courts avec des choix bla bla bla. Pour faire simple, ces petites aventures se sélectionnent un peu au hasard et on ne peut pas toutes les faire en une seule partie (mais bon, aucune aventure n'a d'influence sur l'autre donc quel intérêt à part vouloir tout lire ??). Au niveau du scénario ça n'a pas changé hein, vous êtes toujours un petit monstre qui évolue en société et il doit soit tabasser les autres soit les aider à chasser les loups. M'okay. Dans tous les cas vous allez devenir plus fort et ça ne va rien changer. Vous allez aussi commencer à gagner du ""respect"" en fonction de ce que vous faites. On sait pas à quoi ça sert non plus.

Votre monstre grandit encore. Il est ado. Ok. On recommence. Aventures random. Les stats n'ont toujours aucune influence.

Il grandit. Il est adulte. Pas d'influence des stats. Zut. Mince.

PETIT MOMENT DE TENSION on nous apprend que notre monstre va partir à la retraite. On a donc une petite phase sympatoche où notre monstre est très stressé : comment les monstres vieillissent ?? Soit il devient vieux, soit il retourne dans le lac moisi dans lequel des nouveaux petits monstres vont naître. Et si on veut devenir un vieux monstre et toucher une bonne retraite, il faut passer (ENFIN OUI OUI) un test pour voir si on a bien augmenté nos stats (j'avais quasi tout à 100% kek). Je passe le test haut la main et je deviens vieux. Ok.

NOUVELLE MISSION RETOURNEMENT DE SITUATION. Le jeu te dit ""wow t'as eu une influence de ouf en tant que monstre adulte déjà (ah bon) mais là en tant que vieux monstre tu vas carrément influencer les monstres ET LES HUMAINS INCROYABLE PLOT TWIST"". Donc l'histoire se déroule ainsi : comme vous êtes vieux, vous voulez emmerder le monde et vous occuper de la relation entre les monstres et les humains. En fonction de vos choix (lol) vous allez dégrader la relation humain-monstre ou l'améliorer. Hum ok. Ai-je besoin de préciser à quel point il est facile d'atteindre les 100% (c'est limite si les humains veulent pas copuler avec les monstres dans ma partie tellement ils se kiffent) ? Y a vraiment aucun, aucun challenge. Alors, ouais, ça y est, on a des petits ""tests"" pour nos stats. Mais on est tellement fort de partout déjà qu'on les réussit sans problème. En plus, ils nous DISENT quand les tests vont arriver. Genre les choix se présentent ainsi : ""Manger un poulet (ATTENTION CA DEMANDE BEAUCOUP BEAUCOUP DE BRAVOURE)"". Subtil.

Et puis voilà y a une fin ""bravo les humains et les monstres se kiffent et waouh t'as un peu de respect bravo"". Et c'est fini.

Et si on recommence une partie tout ce qu'on a fait avant ne sert à rien et on aura exactement les mêmes choix qui vont se présenter. Vous verrez littéralement la même chose. Ok, vous choisirez des petites aventures différentes (et encore, y en a pas énormément) mais au final vos stats vont bouger de la même façon, ça n'aura aucune sorte d'influence.

Votre monstre pourra avoir une personnalité différente... Ouais... et alors ? À aucun moment celle-ci se montre vraiment. Les graphismes sont presque inexistants, les musiques aussi... Il n'y a pas de scénario, seule une succession PREDEFINIE d'événements. C'est donc très, très répétitif.

J'ai voulu lancer une 2e partie, je me suis ennuyée très rapidement car j'avais déjà tout lu quasiment. Il n'y a clairement pas assez d'engagement, pas assez d'ambition même pour un petit jeu de ce style. La force devait être dans le texte. Et même si celui-ci est très rigolo, il n'est pas à la hauteur d'un jeu véritablement prenant et charmant. C'est dommage car pour moi ce jeu aurait pu être super marrant, si seulement il avait été fait de telle sorte que des événements différents/aléatoires arrivent en fonction de ce que l'on fait.

À la prochaine.

Well that was upsetting. Monster Loves You! is a text, choose-your-own-adventure game where you start your life out as a newborn baby monster and you live your life up until your return to the slime vat pool or until you finish the game as an elder who transcended above death to decide what ulitimately happens between the humans and monsters when the inevitable conflict happens.

You have 5 personality traits, Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, and Kindness. You gain and use your traits to your advantage in situations that require them. This would be awesome if there was actually more situations that required that. Because more or less everything you do it a sure thing. It's pretty obvious if you're going to lose something or gain something from most interactions. I'll continue that shortly.

You use these personality traits to your advantage to gain respect from other elders and monsters so you may be respected enough as an individual to transcend into becoming an elder on the day you are supposed to die. Then once you are an Elder, you must work to either build or sabotage human and monster relations in the coming days before the conflict of humans and monsters. It is this point I believe the story ends with the effort you put into this before the conflict.

Everything about this game was really cool except that this game doesn't vary or switch up the story at all. By my second playthrough I already knew pathes and things I needed to say to reap the most (xyz) out of that ""adventure"" So I could get my stats high or close to maxed out as possible while getting tons of respect from the elders. I was hoping that after each death it'd be like a new life with new characters and new adventures. But I kept seeing the same thing over and over again already and it got really tedious and simply not fun. It immediately became apparent that i'd just start grinding to get medals for achievements. I don't care so much about the medals. It's nice to see new endings. But that's not the point of a game like Monster Love You! or at least shouldn't be circled around what the ending is going to be. The meat and soul of the game which is the time spent in each life stage is where you're spending most and pretty much all of your time as opposed to the scripted age-transistion stages. It was like I had a really amazing, fan-friggin-tastic sandwich, and in two playthroughs I felt like I was eating the same sandwich for months. I was so sick of it.

Contining on that point is that you get really familiar with each adventure pretty easily, they're very distinct and memorable most of them. And the options listed make it very obvious which choice is going to get you the most points and the good stuff.
I was investing in honesty and kindness to achieve renown for honesty and kindness in the game, but I knew the choices in the game so well and understood where I could get off chalk-free in two playthroughs I already knew where I could build ferocity without consequence. I had kindness and cleverness maxed, I had honesty about 86% up there and I had roughly 69% ferocity. I shouldn't be able to get my ferocity stat so high while striving to get honesty and kindness. Cleverness was just so easy to pick up. It made it super-easy to bend the end game to my will because I had such high stats overall I could make the story anything I wanted it to be. Therefore there was really no reason to keep playing the game. Because in two playthroughs I could understand the routes I need to take to get the most (xyz) and how to get the medals and other things.

It as a really fun game my first two runs. After that, it just simply wasn't fun. Definitely wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I expected much more out of it after reading such nice reviews.

Also continuing, from what i've heard in the game, sounds like the game has only 3 soundtracks in it. And that's just a big no-no. The art directive is okay. They could've worked harder in a lot of areas, but whatever. The humor in this game is great. But it's not funny after you read it the first time.


Regardless, Monster Loves You! is a nice and funny and enjoyable game. But after the second playthrough or third, you realize you're just doing the same thing again and it's not fun. I was really hoping that my deaths in the game would have an influence on my next life (which I read this in a review, this was a lie or a fabrication of their beliefs of what's going on in the game) But it doesn't and that's when I realized I was going to just be doing the same thing over and over again.

Overall, this game wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I bought it for about 4 dollars and I personally just wouldn't really recommend it at all to be honest. As I said, it's fun and it's nice. But I personally think you should keep that money for something nicer that pops up on the steam store or in a steam sale that you'd rather grab.

The main backbone of the story follows your life, as a monster, from the moment you are born in the ""spawning vat"".  As you progress through the story, at certain points in your life you are given adventures to go on. The choices you make in these adventures determine the course of your life, and the overall outcome of the story. There are a wide array of adventures available at each section.

You might think that this is simply a game for kids, but while kids will enjoy this, it does have some aspects where an adult might understand the more mature themes. It is worth noting however, that the overall playtime for the game is quite low, but trying to get the possible endings & exploring all of the available adventures will bump that time up somewhat.

The graphics in this game are very nice. Although they are not the most important part. That falls to the text. The story is written in a very nice way, that makes it easy to enage in.

The game is controlled via a mouse although if you can stream to or play the game on a tablet, it will work much better.

The music in this game is very nice. It's not too obtrusive and compliments the storylike nature of the game.

Something I do feel that this game would really benefit from is if there were some way of making user-generated adventures. After several play throughs, you will come accross all of the adventures and end up repeating yourself.

All in all, ths is a very nice choose your own adventure game which is definitely worth buying. Although, If you don't like reading, then don't buy the game.

You go through each stage of a monster's life, from being born, an adolesencent, an adult, and then you either dissolve and die or become an elder.

Depending on your choices you gain points in personality traits, which you need for other decisions later in the game. Based on your personality and your choices you can get one of 14 endings. An average play should take about 40 minutes, as it did with me.

But Back to the Here and Now.

Gameplay

The Gameplay is more like a classic text adventure. Much to read and at the end you get a collection of things your character can do. For better visualisation you have beautiful handdrawn background, depending on your current location. To make every choice in this game more worthwhile (and to compansate the missing feature of running around in the world and exchanging things for something you could actually use on your adventure) there is a little stats-based system build into it. Nothing much, it keeps track of various characteristica that change depending on the decisions you make. And it actually doesn't do anything else in the game, it's only needed at the end to calculate which ending you will receive, which can range from tragic to hilarious, if you play your cards right. But more of that later.

Story

You start your adventure in a giant green pool of goo. Soon you will grow arms, and legs, and wings? Maybe. You can help those little things around you, or just eat them. And when you have grown strong enough you will embark from the slimy goo, seeing the light of the sun for the first time, and begin your new life as a little Monsterling.
The Story follows you through your life from a little monsterling to your adulthood and eventually your death (and even beyond if you meet certain criteria). In every life stage you receive a collection of adventures you can go on, each one takes a day from your clock until it's time to grow up. But careful here. You have more adventures than days, so you can't take on all of them, the adventures are only presented as icons, and many adventures share the same icon. So you can only guess what you will encounter there. This system will go through all 3 life stages. As little monsterling you learn the ropes of being a monster and rarely leave you broodchamber. During your childhood / Teenager times you learn something about the outside world and how dangerous and fascinating humans can be. Those humans should be on a modern day level. Your adulthood begins with an initiation rite to determine what kind of task you will do in the monsterworld. It's calculated from the stats you build up in your life, but doesn't add anything to your further adventure. You just live your life and do tasks inside and outside of the monster settlement. At the End it's time for you to return to the pool of goo you came from and pass on your memories to the monsters of the next generation. Or, if you did something right with your life, you may receive an oppurtunity to become an elder and just maybe doing some great deeds out there.

Conclusion

What you can expect from Monster Loves You! is a fairytale like adventure game which let you see such stories from quite a different perspective. And maybe you encounter characters like Puss in Boots, or Hänsel and Gretel. The Art is exceptionally well made and the fact that each playthrough will have different adventures and outcomes you gain a certain replaybility. So give it a try and choose your own little twisted fairytale.

Monster Loves You! - замечательный текстовый квест. Здесь нет геймплея как такового - нам нужно только читать и выбирать варианты того, что мы скажем или сделаем. А выбирать здесь стоит внимательно - каждый поступок, совершенный нами, начиная с нашего рождения и заканчивая старостью, влияет на основные показатели нашего монстра (храбрость, свирепость, доброта, интеллект, честность), его репутацию в сообществе монстров, а также на отношение людей к монстрам и монстров к людям. От каждого из этих показателей зависит то, как закончится повествование (а концовок здесь, кстати, 14).
Но очень важно отметить, что игра - не для всех, я бы даже сказал, что для узкого круга людей. Первая проблема игры - английский язык в игре, где весь геймплей состоит в чтении. Если вы не знаете этот язык нас среднем/высоком уровне, то можете смело пропускать эту игру. Вторая проблема близка к первой - геймплейная составляющая. Если вам не нравится читать/не нравились текстовые квесты в, например, Космических Рейнджерах, то, опять же, проходите мимо этой игры.

Die Musik passt zwar gut, wiederhohlt sich aber zu oft

Das Spiel ist recht schnell durchgespielt und wiederholt sich danach immer öfter. Der Wiederspielwert ist zwar da, aber die Szenarien hat man recht schnell durch.

Noch etwas zum Gameplay 
Es ist ein simples durchklicken von Textboxen, da das Spiel nur auf die Story ausgelegt ist.

Fazit: Ein Spiel mit einem lustigen Humor, dass aber leider viel zu kurz ist. Es ist wohl eher für Kinder gedacht.

This game could have been promising if, Crusader Kings style, when playing as a monster born after the previous one the impact of the previous monster could be felt, but every time you start as a new monster, it is as though you had never played the game before.  The game teases social changes in monster society, but since the game never advances forward in time, it's all just window dressing, as no matter what everything will be reset once your current monster dies.  Given that each playthrough is extremely brief, the result is a shallow experience.  Most of the endings are basically stamps for finishing a brief runthrough with a monster who had a certain combination of stats.

Your choices in the game affect your monster's personality, but your monster's personality stats do not have much effect overall.  As far as I can tell, when you begin a new game you get a randomly selected monster image to act as your monster's avatar.  Unfortunately, unlike other monster raising games (like the genre-creating Tamagotchi, cutting age software from the year of our lord 1998) your monster's personality and disposition do not affect its appearance.  Your monster's personality stats affect skill checks in the ""Elder"" segment of the game, and in a few places before, but once you get to the Elder segment the game allows you to choose your best stat for use in skill checks, meaning you will pass every one that you attempt.

Another complaint is that the game features a few recurring characters, but events show an image of a generic monster whose emotion is meant to represent the emotional energy of the scene.  It would have been nice for these images to show the recurring character that is involved in the scene instead.  

This game has a lot going for it - the art is fun and the interface is fine.  The monster society has some fun ideas behind it.  But unless the game can get more interactive, I cannot recommend it to others.",1410223437,1410223437,False,1,0,0.530744314193725586,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Das sind doch immer diese bösen Viecher, die uns Menschen Angst und Schrecken einjagen sollen, oder? Nun, wer weiß das schon so genau, aber das Spiel Monster Loves You!, das bei Steam erhältlich ist, lässt uns tiefer in die Welt eines Monsters blicken als uns vielleicht lieb ist - denn in Monster Loves You! schlüpft man tatsächlich selbst in die Haut eines Monsters. Und wie sich dieses seltsame Spiel spielt, verraten wir euch in einem kurzen Test.

Das Schwimmen in der Ursuppe

Monster Loves You! beginnt jedes Mal ganz am Anfang. Das bedeutet, dass ihr jedes Mal als kleines Monsterschleimchen mitten in der Ursuppe beginnt und euch dort bereits behaupten müsst. Hier genügt es, wenn ihr einfach den Antworten folgt und euren Charakter formt. Anschließend könnt ihr wachsen und in den Kindergarten gehen. Das Spiel selbst ist übrigens in Tagen unterteilt, im Kindergarten verbringt man acht Tage, diese verstreichen allerdings, wenn ihr Aktionen ausführt.

Im Kindergarten geht es dann los, dass ihr auf verschiedene Abenteuer geschickt werdet. Diese sind dahingehend wichtig, damit ihr eure Charaktereigenschaften Ehrlichkeit, Mut, Freundlichkeit, Cleverness und Grausamkeit steigern könnt. Habt ihr diese auf einem hohen Level, fallen euch spätere Entscheidungen wesentlich leichter und ihr könnt euch besser durchsetzen. Im späteren Spielverlauf müsst ihr euch dann auch noch Respekt erarbeiten, sodass ihr die Möglichkeit habt, ein Ältester zu werden. 

In Monster Loves You! durchlebt ihr so die verschiedenen Lebensabschnitte eines Monsters und könnt am Ende auch noch dafür sorgen, wie sich das Verhältnis zwischen den Monstern und den Menschen entwickelt. 14 unterschiedliche Enden stehen euch dabei zur Wahl, die ihr ganz allein durch eure unterschiedlichen Antworten bestimmt.

Gib mir mehr Gameplay

So interessant wie das Spiel nun vielleicht klingen mal, so abwechslungsarm gestaltet sich das Spielkonzept. Es gibt genau ein einziges Spielelement im gesamten Spiel, das durch unglaublich viele Alternativen abgewandelt wird. Jedes Mal, wenn ihr zum Beispiel auf Abenteuer geht, wird euch eine Situation geschildert und ihr müsst eure Antwort aus vorgegeben Antworten wählen. Dies hat dann Auswirkungen auf euren Respekt, eure Charaktereigenschaften oder die Beziehungen zwischen Menschen und Monstern. 

An einigen Stellen im Spiel wäre es sogar angebracht gewesen, kleinere Minispiele einzubauen. Zum Beispiel werdet ihr zu einem Brettspiel herausgefordert, könnt aber auch nur entscheiden, ob ihr beispielsweise das Brett abfackeln oder euch abwenden wollt. Das ist sehr schade und nimmt dem ganzen Konzept ein wenig den Reiz. Dennoch ist selbstverständlich der Reiz vorhanden.

Ein Monsterleben dauert in etwa eine Stunde, wenn man sich Zeit lässt für die Entscheidungen. Das bedeutet, dass ihr auch mit deutlich weniger Zeit durchs Ziel gelangen könnt. Schon allein deswegen verfügt Monster Loves You! über einen ganz besonderen Reiz, der einen immer dazu veranlasst, schnell noch eine Runde zu spielen und zu schauen, wie sich das Ganze denn nun am Ende auswirkt. Ärgerlich wird es dann erst, wenn man nur noch ein Ziel zur Komplettierung benötigt. 

Bugfrei!

Wer hätte das gedacht, aber durch das wirklich einfach Grafiksystem ist Monster Loves You! absolut fehlerfrei, zwar auch animationslos, aber immerhin. Im Grunde habt ihr es mit einem sehr simplen Zeichentrickstil zu tun, der allerdings wirklich sehr einfach ist, da nur ein paar Hintergründe erstellt wurden. Auch hier wäre ein wenig mehr Abwechslung und Bewegung wünschenswert, denn alle Hintergründe sind statisch und bewegen sich nicht. Es gibt ähnliche Spiele, da huscht dann wenigstens mal ein Hase übers Bild oder dergleichen mehr, damit es nicht ganz so langweilig wirkt. Auch hier wäre Abwechslung wünschenswert gewesen. 

Auch im Sound kann sich Monster Loves You! nicht wirklich behaupten, denn dieser wiederholt sich ständig und wird nur mit plumpen Geräuschen, die Monster wohl so von sich geben, untermalt. Das wirkt am Anfang passend, nutzt sich jedoch sehr schnell ab und wandelt sich zum Einheitsbrei. Sehr Schade. Es wäre wirklich besser gewesen, wenn sich die Entwickler ein ganz kleines bisschen mehr Mühe gegeben hätten.

Und, sind die Monster einen Blick wert?

Monster Loves You! ist ein niedliches kleines Spiel, über das sich nicht allzu viel sagen lässt, aber das dennoch seinen Reiz hat. Im Grunde schlüpft ihr in die Haut eines Monsters und folgt seinem Leben, dabei liegen alle Entscheidungen, die nicht das Wachstum betreffen, bei euch. Ihr könnt beispielsweise dazu beitragen, ob die Menschen noch mehr Angst vor Monstern haben oder ob eine Freundschaft möglich ist. Die Entscheidungen selbst trefft ihr dabei, in dem euch eine Situation geschildert wird und ihr zwischen vorgegeben Antworten wählen könnt, wie ihr reagieren würdet. Dank 14 unterschiedlichen Enden sind die Entscheidungen recht komplex, sind jedoch nicht immer gleich offensichtlich.

Monster Loves You! ist auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert, wenn man ein Spiel für zwischendurch sucht, da die einzelnen Runden nie wirklich lange dauern. Eine Runde dauert etwa zwischen 30 und 60 Minuten und ist somit schnell zu absolvieren. Falls ihr dennoch mal nicht viel Zeit habt, könnt ihr einfach zwischendrin aufhören, es speichert automatisch euren Fortschritt. Neben der interessanten Art des Spiels ist es ansonsten allerdings sehr abwechslungsarm, da man keinerlei Minispiele oder etwas in der Art eingebaut hat und sich sogar so der Sound sehr schnell abnutzt. Sehr schade, denn hier wurde definitiv jede Menge Potential verschenkt, was leider auch Abzüge in der Wertung kostet. Dennoch ist Monster Loves You! ein sehr interessantes Spiel, das sich lohnt, vielleicht nicht zum Vollpreis von 10€, aber mal als Schnäppchen ist es ganz gut geeignet.

But it is far too short to justify a $10 pricetag. There is simply not enough content to justify it. 

Another thing worth considering is that your actions, generally, provide few negative consequences. You would have to actively seek out the worst possible answer to even reach the worst endings within this game. There is simply no challenge, though in retrospect, that may have been the point. 

However, given the lack of content, this only serves to hurt the game instead of actually reinforcing the gaming experience, gaming being used very liberally in this situation.

I really do like this game. I appreciated the variety in the scenarios and the writing was very cute. However, there is simply not enough to do in this game and the things to do don't provide any measure of challenge. I found myself with most of stats being maxed out without any active consideration towards any stat but one. 

It was honestly harder for me to not get both Human and Monster relationships up to 100%. It just seemed like this was too easy and even though I'm not expecting something difficult on the level of some other Steam games, it just felt like this game was handing everything to me.

I was interested in this game after discussing it with my brother, who had seen a playthrough by YouTube personalities Game Grumps. A few days later, this game was the Steam Daily Deal.

If you like super casual gameplay, choose-your-own-adventures, and text-based games, then you will enjoy Monsters Loves You!

The game is extremely short - I completed one playthrough in less than 45 minutes. Keep in mind, however, that I read A LOT and can read considerably quickly. 

The aesthetics (like most other elements of this game) are fairly casual with a small pool of recycled pictures and text. The detail in the scenery is good, and your monster's appearance varies greatly and seems to be determined by the initial options you select. The music is suprisingly good, and the ending background music in particular adds a majestic, urgent feel to the gameplay. 

The controls just involve you to click, and the learning curve is minimal. There is no apprent tutorial, however, many of the options have a ""help"" button that you can click, allowing things to be explained without progressing the story - in dialogue options, this is usually presented as the top/first option (clicking it will provide you with additional situational information without continuing the story).

I have to stress that gameplay is extremely casual, and since this is a text-based game, you will have to really rely on your imagination to fill in the details. Readers interested in the theme will probably like this game, however, if you do not read regularly (especially for recreational purposes) you may find this game to be very boring. 

Almost every decision you make in the game will result in you obtaining (or even losing) different stat points like bravery, respect, ferocity, honesty, etc. For example, fighting a bear and winning may give you points in bravery, ferocity, and respect. Besides respect, every monster stat is represented on the bottom of the screen in the form of different icons, and you can click each one to give you additional information. You can level all stats to a maximum of 100.

The stats are important for the end-game, where many of your actions are dependent on your stat scores (ex: to successfully fught off an opponent you need a high bravery/ferocity rating). Furthermore, respect is extremely important for getting other monsters on your side, especially in political situations. While the ""politics"" element really interested me, remember that this is an extremely casual game, and the politicial intrigue is reflectively minimal. Most of the politics involves your interactions with both the human and monster communities, and the end-game (if you get that far) will add two new gauges - the ""how humans view monsters"" and ""how monster view humans"" meters (maximum value of 100). 

Respect is critical for the end-game, where your decisions will determine which particular ending you receive.

Each ""phase"" of the monster's life cycle is broken up, and you have a fixed amount of turns before you advance to the next stage of life. The last stage requires you to have a high respect rating and/or high character stats. 

During each ""phase,"" you can go adventuring. I really liked this part, because you only have enough ""turns"" (represented by days) in each ""phase"" to go on adventures. When selecting an adventure, you must click on different icons to activate a mission - you are not given any information besides the pictures on each adventure icon. I loved this mechanic because it made things less predictable and also more exciting. I am not sure if the available adventures are randomized for each playthrough, but I have noticed that they can be different each time (it may depend on the initial options you pick right when you start playing).

For achievement hunters, you will have to do A LOT of playthroughs, since you need to unlock every possible ending. After doing enough playthroughs, you should be able to progress through the game fairly quickly, especially once each adventure icon becomes more and more familiar to you. 

That being said, it is very, very easy for you to become bored of this game if you try to get all the achievements in one (or few) sittings, since all of the decision tree consequences will be known to you. Instead, I strongly suggest you only do one playthrough per sitting, and try to spread the playtime for this game around to keep things fresh. Remember, there is A LOT of text in this game, so avoid it if you do not like reading.

For choose-your-own-adventure buffs and text-based game lovers, this casual game will fit very well in your libraries. For anyone not interested in those things, you might want to avoid playing this.

There are different endings you achieve by boosting the right stats and making decisions. The art is lively but the majority of the game is text-based. The events that take place are randomized with each playthrough making it practically impossible to see every outcome. I feel that is a good thing.

The choices you make often give surprising results making it easy to construct your own highly personal narrative.

I particularly like the deceptively dense lore of the world. Different paths give you amazing insights into the nature of the monster species.

Compared to other games of its kind, it is very easy. There are no failstates nor do you have to keep track of laberynthine event trees. It is suitable for younger and/or inexperienced players. That said there is a fair amount of violence so discretion is advised.

각 상황에서 선택하는 그 선택 하나하나가 이후 선택지에 영향을 미치고, 각 능력치의 상승/하강을 유발하고, 결국 이런 과정이 쌓이고 쌓여 스토리의 흐름을 좌우하게 된다. 유년기에는 다섯가지의 기본 능력치 관리가, 청소년기에는 주로 '신뢰도' 관리가, 성년기에는 인간과 몬스터간의 관계도 관리가 중요한 게임. 이것들에 의해 게임의 흐름이 변하게 되며, 청소년기까지 기본 능력치 관리를 제대로 하지 못하여 성년기로 넘어가는 테스트를 통과하지 못 할 경우 몬스터 풀의 양분 신세가 되어버리기도 한다. (일부러 성년기로 가지 않고 몬스터풀에 용해되는 것도 가능하긴 하다.)

성년기의 경우 몬스터와 인간의 관계도를 통해 엔딩이 결정되는데, 이 때 서로의 호감도를 상승시키기 위해 이전에 쌓아두었던 다섯 능력치가 중요하게 작용한다. ......만, 성년기가 되기 위해선 보통 능력치가 좋아야 테스트 통과하기 수월하기 때문에 여기까지 왔으면 보통 분쟁유발보단 평화주의 엔딩을 보는 게 훨씬 쉬워진다. 호감도 상승폭이 감소폭보다 훨씬 크고. 역시 러브 앤 피스, 평화가 최고시다.

한 번 플레이하는 데 시간이 15~20분 정도로 많이 짧으나, 여러 번 플레이를 통해 각종 상황을 이리저리 구경할 수 있다는 점 때문에 플레이 타임이 짧은 것이 도리어 장점이 된다. 더불어 각 플레이 때마다 선택할 수 있는 상황도 조금씩 바뀌므로 플레이마다 나름 이것저것 선택해보는 재미도 있다. 각 상황별로 확률이 존재하기 때문에 가끔 테스트 불합격해서 내 몬스터가 녹아내릴 땐 조금 씁쓸하긴 하지만, 보통은 능력치가 높으면 대개 성공하기 때문에 크게 걱정하지 않아도 되는 부분.

이 짧은 게임 안에 나름 몬스터로써의 희노애락을 전부 넣어놨다. 나름 훌륭한 영어교재이며, 잔잔한 유쾌함을 보여주는 썩 괜찮은 게임.

As a Monsterling, your choices are simple ones. Do you chase those poor little mice (+1 Ferocity) or protect them from the dogs (+1 Kindness)? Do you come clean about that fungus your friends ate (+1 Honesty) or cover for them (+1 Bravery)? As a youth, your choices determine your personality. 

But all youngins must grow up. Monsters and Humans have been at odds for centuries, and there are Human villages on the other side of the enchanted woods.

Its a kind of ""Build your Adventure"" story game in which you raise your own monsterling from birth to adulthood. It involves quite some good reading and humor. The game gives you lots of choices, like ""save the monsterling - or eat it"", which in progress develop your character and the storyline.

Besides the many small story bits, its not overly complex, but its very entertaining.

The Achievements are fun to hunt down and you will need to play through the game several times to get them all. Generally the game has plenty of replayability with its varied small stories, so that is not too much of an issue. I played it several times over and still find new ones. A playthrough shouldn't take more than an hour i guess, maybe less.

If i had to criticize something, then its probably that its not very long, but i guess that's the way the game was designed, its not meant to be a complex long thing, more something easy to play in between.

And i would have loved to be able to design the looks my own monsterling, sadly the game doesn't give that option, i think its random how your monster will look like.

Technically the game is solid, no bugs or anything that i would have to mention.
Also i totally dig the artstyle, but thats personal preference =)

It also has the best emoticons, so thanks for that.

Each monster ""life"" in Monster Loves You can be finished in less than 30 minutes. You can tackle different scenarios (which are various but do become repetitive) to get different results but in the end there is not much to this game. The art style is nice although it doesn't animate much at all and everything is pretty static. But the visual style and fonts are at least easy to look at. 

I can't say if this is suitable material for younger kids because it does have some rather violent imagery brought forth in some of the written scenarios but they never get too serious or morbid.

遊戲內容實在太貧乏了
雖說有12個結局
但過程重複性太高
我只過了兩次就沒興趣再玩下一輪了
因為只要玩到第二次
你就會發現一堆重複的內容
基本上就是前期升數值
後期用你有升的數值的選項來做選擇
舉例來說
前期你很誠實 於是誠實數值很高
那麼後期就可以選以口頭說服人的方式
前期你就很暴力 於是暴力數值很高
那麼後期就直接用暴力讓其他怪獸聽你的
而兩者在最後並沒有差別...
你的怪獸本身並沒有個性
除了會看數值的少數特定選項之外
平時就算暴力數值低也不會讓你選擇殺死的選項失敗
至於怪物長甚麼樣子 就更一點關係都沒有了

I didn't enjoy it very much (and still don't enjoy GTA-style games in general). The second game I ever played was much better - Age of Empires 2, on the PC. Why do I bring this up? Because it's important to note that I started playing video games well beyond the era of the text-based adventures and RPG's of the 80's. Which is important to note because Monster Loves You! is essentially a text-based adventure game, albiet one that doesn't require typing and has a graphical interface.

It's definitely a solid game, with a clearly defined goal that you're working towards, and it's probably the right length for a modern text-based adventure. The graphical interface is cutesy enough, and is very effective in capturing the player's interest. The game also successfully incorporates some clever RPG-like stat-building, with a series of stats that can be raised or lowered depending on the conversation options the player chooses. All these elements combine into a lighter game that will be enjoyed more by casual gamers than those that play more seriously.

Which is why I can't recommend this game; most people on Steam simply won't enjoy it for long enough to get their money's worth. While I enjoyed it, that was only for 51 minutes; I have no desire to play through the game again. That's not the fault of the game, moreso the fault of the genre. Gamers have simply moved on from the days of the text-based adventure, and now prefer their RPG stats to be accomponied by a 3-dimensional world that they experience through the eyes of a character they make.

Monster Loves You! Este un joc potrivit in special pentru copii, dar poate pune ceva probleme adultilor in explorarea tuturor posibilitatilor oferite de acest titlu.

Povestea

In Monster Loves You, vei controla viata unui monstru de la nastere si pana la moarte, iar actiunile si deciziile pe care le iei in joc vor afecta viitorul si existenta monstrilor in lume si convietuirea lor langa oameni.

Orasul in care se desfasoara actiunea la inceputuri se numeste Omen („semn” in engleza). Ca orice monstru, esti o fire independenta si rebela si vei fi obligat sa iei decizii din clipa care te nasti. Deciziile tale te pot duce la un sfarsit prematur sau te vor ajuta sa intri in „sfatul batranilor” si sa traiesti fericit pana la adanci batraneti. Actiunile tale vor afecta viitorul relatiei monstrii-oameni si, implicit viitorul tau. La fiecare inceput al jocului vei lua niste decizii care vor schimba soarta monstrului tau de la o incercare a jocului la alta, iar finalul este de fiecare data diferit.

Gameplay

Monster Loves You are un stil de joc unic, similar unei povesti interactive. Jocul se controleaza doar cu mouse-ul si tot ce trebuie sa faci esti sa-ti alegi o anumita misiune sau scenariu si sa iei deciziile pe care le doresti. Fiecare decizie contribuie la creionarea profilului tau. Ai 5 calitati de baza: Curaj, Istetime, Ferocitate, Onestitate si Bunatate. Fiecare decizie a ta va contribui pentru una din cele 5 calitati, iar echilibrul dintre ele iti va influenta relatia cu ceilalti monstri si durata de viata. Odata ajuns la maturitate va trebui sa aduni Respect din partea celorlalti monstri pentru a-ti asigura prelungirea duratei de viata si intrarea in randul inteleptilor.
Lipsa respectului si decizile pripite iti vor aduce moartea, insa nu e neaparat un lucru rau. Cand un monstru moare, se intoarce la locul nasterii si lasa o mostenire genetica neamului sau.

Daca reusesti sa treci in randul batranilor, vei avea o problema mare pe cap: relatia monstrilor cu oamenii. Deciziile luate de tine in aceasta perioada vor determina ceea ce se va intampla cu monstrii pe viitor: vor intra in razboi cu oamenii, ii vor invinge sau vor fi invinsi, vor face pace intre ei si vor invata sa convietuiasca, vor deveni animale de circ sau pur si simplu vor fugi. La fiecare incercare a jocului vei obtine rezultate diferite, iar cele 14 realizari STEAM disponibile pot fi atinse doar cu 14 finalizari diferite ale jocului, deci pentru a le obtine va trebui sa rejoci toata actiunea din nou, lucru care poate deveni plictisitor si intra in rutina. Aveti mai jos un video cu un gameplay complet pentru o realizare STEAM:


Jocul vine si cu carduri STEAM care pot fi adunate sau vandute pe STEAM market, un trend modern prezent pe toate jocurile noi.

Grafica si sunet

Monster Loves You are o grafica placuta, dar simpluta. Cum controlezi jocul doar cu mouse-ul poti sa nu observi anumite aspecte, dar mediul inconjurator este si el interactiv in unele locuri.

Sunetul este simplu, exista o singura coloana sonora, iar daca joci mult devine repetitiva si plictisitoare de multe ori.

Concluzie

Monster Loves You a reusit sa ma tina conectat 4 ore pana acum si imi va mai rapi cateva ore bune, pentru a atinge toate Achivementurile, in pofida asteptarilor mele cand am inceput sa ma joc. Odata inteleasa ideea, jocul te va prinde si vei avea o experienta placuta, asadar investitia de 7 euro se merita pentru Monster Loves You.

Are you old enough to remember Alter Ego? The mid-eighties life-sim is a major influence over this quirky title.

Essentially entirely text-based, you click your way through multiple-choice scenarios, which determine the personality of your monster, as you guide it through the life-cycle. It's certainly charming, but quickly became dull, and didn't (to my mind) hold much replay value. There are some stats being tracked 'under the hood' and achievement chasers might care to spend time there, but for me a couple of playthroughs was more than enough. Younger players will probably revel in the fantasy, but it might be more wordy then their patience will stand?

The major CON compared to Alter Ego is that the events (or specifically, their outcomes) are even more random: the authors have tried to give 'Monster World' a consistent logic, but it can be pretty hard to second-guess.

It isn't until the latter of the game, which you may or may not reach due to your decisions in game, where you begin having an influence on anything beyond your monster village and the woods around it.

Monster society is darkly humour- black comedy abounds. You meet many different fairytale creatures and have an opportunity to try and befriend or viciously murder and eat all of them. The soundtrack and visuals are bright and cartoonish, and fit perfectly.

Each play-through will take you about twenty to thirty minutes, depending on how fast of a reader you are, and getting most of the endings is pretty intuitive. It's a good game to pass the time.",1391520765,1391520765,True,26,1,0.728601157665252686,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are 14 achievements in the game were each is awarded for one of the 14 outcomes of the game.

You can take the time to think out your responses with an end goal in sight, or just haphazardly click on whatever sounds good at the time and get a result. With roots in storytelling and even text-based adventure games, Monster Loves You! is a charming and unique title that will take most gamers 30-45 minutes to play through, but getting all the endings will take more than a little thought and time.

It's more of a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing. There is no platforming, no questing, no inventory, no racing. And that's completely fine.

That said, if you've ever enjoyed books that allowed you to choose your own adventure, you're bound to love this. There are a lot of options and outcomes, all done in a cartoonish and clever style. Don't be fooled by the presentation though, this is not quite what you'd call a ""kid's game"".

While there is no voice acting, the options you're presented with all have distinct feeling to them, which plays great with idea of shaping your monster from a morsel to an Elder. The various personality traits - such as bravery, ferocity, kindness - increase or decrease depending on your choices. Your options for the final outcome are determined by how high or how low these traits actually are. This also gives MLY plenty fo replaybility, as there are plenty of different outcomes each granting an in-game emblem as well as an achievement. Great for trophy hunters.

I definitely recommend getting this if you're looking for something mellow and relaxing to pass time with. Each ""run"" is about 30-60 minutes long, depending on what scenarios you receive and how fast you read.

However, [b]know what you're getting into[/b]. I cannot stress this enough.

        [td]
Ringrazio Miky che mi ha regalato questo gioco tempo fa e questo mi permette ora di fare questa piccola recensione.

Diciamo che non sono esattamente un amante del genere indie, per quanto sporadicamente escano piccoli gioiellini da quel mondo di sviluppatori.

Sinceramente da un gioco con un titolo del genere non sapevo cosa aspettarmi, ma lo stile graphic novel mi ha attirato abbastanza.
Fortunatamente mi attendeva una bella sorpresa: questo gioco è una specie di GDR dove l'obiettivo principale sarà quello di cercare di dare una personalità al nostro personaggio, accompagnandolo fin dai primi passi che muoverete da mostriciattoli alla tragica quanto filosofica morte in pieno stile platonico (o alla possibile ascesa a ""elder"", un manipolo di mostri prescelti o per il rispetto ricevuto o per particolari abilità).

Ha una giocabilità abbastanza limitata in ogni caso e svariati finali.
Decisamente un gioco ben realizzato e molto divertente.

Consiglierei di prenderselo se mai entrasse in qualche bundle conveniente.

After a few playthroughs, you'll probably start to recognize some of the options.  This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either.  The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.

The soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar  is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well.  A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing).  The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game.  It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.

The writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar.  It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child.",1383868565,1511377410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If I had to compare MLY to a video game, the closest thing would be a very, very old game called Alter Ego (from 1986, not the 2010 game of the same name). The similarities are striking, with the exception that in MLY you play a monster in a fictional world whereas in AE you were a male or female human in the real world.

 Although MLY's interface is better than AE's, it lacks the same depth. In AE, you didn't just make decisions and get older, but you could get an education, hold down a job, get married, get pregnant (if you were female), die prematurely, and so on.

It is very similar to the old game Alter ego (which you can play for free here: http://www.playalterego.com/alterego). I really love games in which you are responsible for the actions you make. There are every new quest new choices to make. If you decide to be brave you will receive +bravery points. This will have influence on option that are available later on in the game. For example if you want to impress certain Monsters or Humans you need to roll two dices (based on yoru bravery) to see if you are succesful.

It is very easy to build up your personality points, and some options are really obvious what the outcome will be. The quests results are a bit predictable at times. But nevertheless it is a cute game which i enjoyed very much. Although for a very short time. You can finish this game in under an hour. Of course there are many other paths to take and endings to see.

Pros:
- Decisions, decisions, everything comes down to decisions.
- Humorous and fun to read.
- Different endings.

Cons:
- Very short.
- Decisions have only influence on your personality not on the overal storyline.
- Text-based.

You're presented with a situation and you choose one of the 2 or 3 responses to the situation until you evertually reach one of the 12 endings.

Unfortunately, there's very little random variation between games and choices early in the game affect your stats but not the scenarios you encounter later. After two playthroughs, you'll have encountered most of the scenarios even if you make very different choices on your next playthrough... so there's little incentive to try for the other 11 endings after you've seen your first.

A nice multiple choice game with a high replay value due to its actual shortness (5 to 15 minutes per playthrough, depending on certain choices and the amount of text you get to read)

But that's okay, because then you can start all over, make different choices and get completely different results:
• Lecture fellow monsters about the dangers of human tools OR convince them that not everything human-made is THAT bad.
• Comfort a grieving woman OR just eat her.
• Scare away birds from some bread crumbs and eat those OR follow the crumbs to a strange little house made of gingerbread. *hint hint*
• End the feud between monsters and humans OR go to war and either get killed, enslaved or succeed and become the new ruler of the world.

All of this is just ""shown"" in textual form (nope, no animated cutscenes and no running around, just reading, choosing, clicking, reading, choosing and clicking), but it's still a lot of fun when you get to read the results of your doings:

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?

Sadly, the best choices will get stuck in your head and you'll just click through everything in less than 5 minutes before you start a new game again, but that's only the case if you don't care about the different endings, because getting those is the actual challenge (which adds even more replay value).",1372381040,1372381040,True,0,0,0.287649214267730713,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The developers found a nice, clever way to tell a story where you decide the outcome. There are multiple endings (14 if the achievements aren't lying) so there's more than enough replay value here. One playthrough should take you about an hour.
