I played 20 minutes and I realized I'd better watch someone else solving the puzzles on youtube. It is simply not fun to die again and again doing a bunch of trial and error, with an inventory that lets you keep only two objects at a time, a mechanic that implies a lot of backtracking and some very bad platforming. Puzzles are not even clever, and the story is absent. I am sure this game was memorable and enjoyable in the old days, at the arcade... So buy it and play it again if you want to revive your childhood memories, or if you are somehow interested in the history of the genre. But if you are looking for a game that is fun to play today, choose something else. 
It is a good port, enriched with nice extra material. But all in all, it was a good game, that sadly did not stand the test of time.",1673136803,1673136803,False,3,0,0.559050261974334717,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Its something old. (yeep)
Its something borrowed. (artstyle)
Its something blue. (much is blue in this one)

What could ever go wrong with that?

Nothing really.
Its one of those classic do something or die trying to do said something games.

Worth 5,99Euros.....
Nope. not even close. (you can get Batman; Arkham city for less, just as an example)

Worth a 1/10th of that at the most.

Games that looked like this in the 1990s......wouldnt had payed it any attention as there where alot better titles out at that time....

Simon the sorcerer 1 & 2 to mention just something....
This one should be considered a neutral vote for me but as we all know there is no such on Steam.

So its a yes i recommend. but just.",1591212092,1591212092,True,1,0,0.481213867664337158,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Dizzy series and their imitators, BMX Simulator, Steg the Slug, Rockstar Ate My Hamster, Tilt...

And then we get a Codies game released on Steam, in more or less its original form, and... it's Slightly Magic. I'm not sure if I had any prior relationship with this game. I think I owned it at some point, but maybe it was one of those tapes that rarely loaded properly. Maybe I gave it a try but was immediately put off by the apparent difficulty and oblique puzzles of the first few screens.

Having given it more of a chance, to make the most of my Steam purchase, I'm a bit more taken with it. It turns out there is more to it than getting fried by the dragon right at the beginning. The puzzles have a logical progression to them. The platform jumping seems fairly sophisticated and forgiving, but I suspect that's an aspect of the remake rather than the original. Overall, the game certainly has that 8-bit charm. It's just so good to play a game with that white sprites, black background Spectrummy look. For a Dizzyalike, Slightly Magic has its own unique style.

Is this worth a purchase if it doesn't hold any nostalgic appeal for you? I'd like to urge yes. It's certainly more worthy than a lot of Steam indie games. At full price, it might be asking just a little bit much. This is a game that cost 3.99 on release (inflation, I know). Achievements and trading cards would do a lot to add value.

I hope between this and Deus Ex Machina, this is the start of seeing a lot more games of this era on Steam. While this release seems to be a one-off project by Colin Jones, I'll keep dreaming of that Atari Vault style collection of Codemasters classics.",1505242253,1505242253,True,3,0,0.560965001583099365,2,True,False,False,False,,,
