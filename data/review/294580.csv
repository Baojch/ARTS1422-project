Когда увидел две аркады по Фредди, подумал, что эта будет куда интереснее чем лабиринты, потому что сеттинг лабиринтов не такой интересный и драйвовый, но я очень сильно ошибся. 
В этой игре очень много минусов. Словно она и отдельной игрой не должна была быть, а только мини-аркадой в какой-нибудь из частей про Фредди. Прошёл её полностью за 3,5 часа и выделил следующие минусы:

- нестабильная на 10-й винде. Если Maze Madness шло стабильно, то тут часто вылетает при загрузке уровня;
- уровни отличаются только количеством необходимых червяков, фоном, скоростью пузырей и количеством мобов. Но в общем все 100 уровней одинаковые и однообразные, от чего очень скучно;
- крайне скучный геймлей с маленьким количеством усилителей;
- есть плюшки для новичков, но игра настолько лёгкая, что я вообще не знаю зачем они;
- много визуального шума;
- много лишних повторяющихся комментариев, как от самого Лютера, так и от других мобов;
- в Maze Madness была подвязка на сюжет из-за чего игроку понятно ради чего он собирает семена. Зачем Лютер утонул в пещере и собирает червяков? Не понятно;
- [h2] свинья на субмарине скидывает шары для боулинга?! Что простите?[/h2] 
- система рейтинга. Вроде круто, добавили, но только для игры на очки. И посмотреть её можно только после игры;
- в очках синглплейера смысла вообще нет;
- есть игра на двоих. Которая подразумевает что сначала один игрок проходит уровень, потом другой. Что? Зачем? В чём спортивный интерес или интерес помощи?

Крайне разочарован игрой. Не зря в детстве она меня не затянула. Три бала только за приятную фоновую музыку да за то что фоны перерисовывали. И на том спасибо.",1699285707,1699285707,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Freddi Fish and Luther's Water Worries is a bubble popping game. You just pop bubbles grab brown worms, that's it. Also I had to down-graded to buzzed me, cause drunk me won't be able to finish this.

This one isn't as bad as Maze Madness, but it's still pretty bad. The main problem with it is how punishing it can be. You're only way to fire your weapon is to click the mouse. You'd think you could just hold the mouse button down, but if you do that Luther runs out of breath and you can't fire for a few seconds. So the best strategy is to just mash the button through the entire level while constantly on the move to dodge the many obstacles. This caused my hand to constantly cramp up and just became unpleasant.

This isn't helped by the onslaught of hazards to avoid. There's these little lantern fish that will automatically zoom to a worm doodle when you pop the bubble it's on (you can still get it if you get there fast enough and then it just swims away) and wigglers that cause Luther to vibrate for a few seconds. Those aren't that bad. However there's tons of hazards that stun Luther for a long time. Jellyfish, big bubbles, seaweed, falling rocks, UFOs that drop bowling balls, and big sponges. The worst part about these is they can stack. So if say you're trapped in a bubble and accidentally hit a jellyfish or touch seaweed, then you're stunned for even longer. This isn't that much of an issue in the early levels, but by late game it becomes obnoxious especially when the screen is filled with jellyfish cause they don't go away until they fall off the screen.

A lot of this could be fixed if the powerups were more common and did more than they do. There's 4 types of powerups. Extra lives, super ammo which makes it so you can just hold the button down to fire and frees you from bubbles when trapped in them, a sea urchin suit which pops bubbles that touch you and makes you invincible to hazards other than seaweed, and one that raises the water a bit so you have more time to finish the level. What I would have liked to see is have the super ammo at least be able to get rid of the jellyfish. Either that or let me grab collectibles like worm doodles or powerups when stunned. If the game can fight you so hard by throwing tons of projectiles at you all at once, especially in the late game, then it could at least be nice enough to let you grab any worm doodles you might have popped before being stunned.

I can't recommend this game at all. Maybe if you're just wanting to get high scores or play a few of the early levels and then be done, but if you plan to play all 100 levels, this game turns to shit fast.",1650340693,1650340693,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play as Luther and all you do is pop bubbles with his slingshot to keep the water from draining out of the level you're on and along the way, you have to collect a certain number of Luther's worm doodles in order to proceed to the next level which is real easy. You know what's also real easy? If you click and hold the mouse button to fire the slingshot, Luther gets tired out for a few seconds. Get Luther trapped in a big bubble, you're out for five seconds.

This game tells us about adventures of a small green fish called Luther who was sucked into the cave by whirlpool. The cave is populated by various kinds of fish. Water in cave is oxygenated - a lot of bubbles come from bottom all the time. Because of that all inhabitants are suffering inside those bubbles (remember, fish cannot live outside the water). Luther makes a tough decision to free them by shooting bubbles with his trusty slingshot, but in order to survive he has to take the food (worms) away from them. Does Luther truly realise the output of his actions? Can the unarmed liberated fish make its way outside the cave along with Luther or will they die without food inside bubbles? You will find the answer to these questions after 100 tough levels.
