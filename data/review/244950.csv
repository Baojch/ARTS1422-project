I don't typically find those two things in the same space yet I find it here. The aesthetic is so sweet it could give you cavities and the concept seems wonderful with the trailer on the store page bringing it all together to paint a picture of what to expect. First off let me just say that the bits that weren't incredibly obvious or easy were VERY trial and error dependent. This essentially boils down to the fact that it'll take patience and lacks actual challenge. Saying this game is challenging would be like saying a race is challenging just because they blindfold you for 1/4th or more of it. If you're diligent you can mostly figure out which screen connects to one another, however there's still plenty that you'll only discover through a leap of faith. Which is something that produces artificial difficulty if not mild frustration. It gives you the controls bit by bit and doesn't explain them leaving you to more trial and error as well.

While not exactly a bad game, by the end of my playthrough my opinion on it had lowered enough that I cannot recommned it; there are plenty of other games in the genre more deserving of your time.

The gameplay consists of around 20 short levels, where you must navigate three characters to the end and optionally collect hearts.  The three characters can serve as platforms for each other, and on some levels have unique powers that are needed to solve the puzzles.  The main gimmick, however, is the way that instead of showing the level in a single screen, it is broken into segments which are arranged quasi-randomly.  The challenge is then to figure out the actual layout of the level from this presentation.  At first, I thought this was an interesting idea; but it quickly wore out its welcome.  This is especially true when you must jump from one segment to another; even the simplest jump becomes unnaturally hard when you can't see your target or the whole arc, and to me it feels like fake difficulty.

There are a couple of technical issues that also worsen the experience.  The absence of gamepad support is annoying; while not necessary, I would have preferred to play it that way.  Also, in a game where you are challenged to get all collectables in each level without dying, the absence of a [i]restart level[/i] button is a criminal oversight.  Instead, you must quit to the level select screen and re-select the level you are playing on, and in the more challenging levels that quickly becomes pointlessly frustrating.

[h1]Il gioco:[/h1]
Where is my heart? è un platform in cui non avremo una visione completa del livello in cui ci stiamo muovendo, o meglio sarà completa, ma frammentata in tante finestre e rimescolata, in modo tale da rendere così anche i più semplici movimenti molto più ardui nel passaggio da un riquadro all'altro; il proprio personaggio infatti saetterà da un lato all'altro dello schermo come in una versione caotica e stereoscopica di Portal. Ad aggiungere un po' di sfida ci sarà anche la possibilità di utilizzare tre differenti personaggi, ognuno con un potere unico che ci permetterà di muoverci più agevolmente tra questi ""frammenti di livelli"".

- Grazie alla [i]meccanica della frammentazione[/i], non risulta già ""visto e rivisto"" come molti altri platform.
- La [i]grafica[/i], pur essendo minimalista, nel complesso risulta ben curata, soprattutto a livello cromatico.

- Come tutti i fan del genere sanno, in un platform la [i]storia[/i] di fondo può contribuire molto, ed è un vero peccato che in Where is my heart? sia quasi del tutto assente.
- Quando uno sviluppatore crea un gioco che tutto sommato soddisfa il giocatore si dovrebbe ben guardare dal renderlo un'esperienza mordi e fuggi, eppure Where is  my heart? è [i]brevissimo[/i] con i suoi pochi (30) livelli, e le pochissime ore di gioco necessarie per completarlo: vi basterà sapere che in poco meno di sei ore si possono completare tutti i livelli, prendendo anche tutti i collezionabili.",1532620390,1532620390,True,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Experience[/h1]

I don't like this game. You can get all the achievements roughly ⅔ into the game, at which point I quickly lost the will and motivation to actually finish it - a very rare occurrence for me. I did manage to stick with the game long enough to see the final level being beaten - and saw there were like 4 more extra levels showing up. I then quickly decided to move on and swiftly deleted the game - again, a very rare occurrence for me; [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/balancetraveller/recommended/234900/]I usually enjoy post-game content as well[/url].

[h1]Commentary[/h1]

The thing with this game is that they're stepping up the challenge not by creating real puzzles that'd tap into more of your brain power, but simply by adding more frustrations to fuck you up. More fractured screens, more blind jumps, more maliciously placed platforms and spikes, and more trials and errors on where to make those dimension-shifting leaps. And that's it - the levels just became lengthier and lengthier; there was no new mechanism after each of the 3 spirits got their own share of ability introduction, and the story was just plain awful. Well, actually I wasn't even sure if there's a functional storyline at all. I'm not saying that there's a huge [i]caveat emptor[/i] here, but there are definitely better games and experiences you can buy with the same amount of money.",1507413092,1543658027,False,3,0,0.488175570964813232,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is somewhat headache inducing at first, but I eventually learned to start steadily traversing around levels, piecing together how they're actually supposed to look in my mind before routing a course to finish them.

On the other hand, there are unfortunately some irritating, borderline luck-based issues with the transformations. One of the transformations is the ""Rainbow Spirit"", which allows you to rotate the level's fragments by 90° intervals while remaining in the same place spatially. However, if you land even just a few pixels within a wall, you'll die and have to respawn. A similar problem is presented by the Antler Ancestor, whom turns its companions into fireflies that, when you detransform, also turn back to normal. The fireflies flutter around in a semi-random fashion and detransformation isn't instant, so it is incredibly easy for them to end up trapped in a wall or falling to death. Fortunately, the levels that involve detransforming the fireflies in a certain place are very few, but the one that had timing it as its primary puzzle took me an hour to finish without dying and doing so felt entirely out of my hands.

It's not actually necessary to complete levels without dying, and the levels are compact enough that having to respawn at the entrance is only a minor inconvenience. However, there are also hearts to collect in each level as a score, and each death reduces that score by one. Considering the above transformation problems, as well as how each level starts with each of the three characters spawning in one-by-one, and also how there's no quick restart option, I wouldn't be surprised if an eighth of my gameplay time was spent quitting out of levels and going back into them. Personally, if I were to redesign this game's levels, I would have removed the death penalty and also put the hearts in more interesting and challenging places to get to, since a fair amount of them are sort of just arbitrarily placed wherever.

But again, getting a perfect score on every level is optional, and there doesn't even seem to be any reward for doing so — not even an achievement. I'm not sure whether or not I should be upset about that.

Fortunately, as if to counteract all that mess, the aesthetics of the game are super soothing. The spritework is cute and drawn with pleasing, pastel colors, and the soft chiptune soundtrack is so relaxing that I have honestly spent far more time falling asleep to it than actually playing the game. If nothing else, I definitely suggest that you give it a listen [url=https://alessandrocoronas.bandcamp.com/album/where-is-my-heart-ost]here[/url].

I was almost going to give this game a positive recommendation because, despite all of its flaws, the levels and their puzzles were still fun to work out, and I didn't regret playing until 100% completion. However, I just noticed that the normal price for the game is $7.99, and the lowest the price has ever gotten is apparently $3.99.

""Where is my Heart?"" - если коротко, то это пазл-платформер с целью собирания сердечек и прокладыванием пути от точки А до точки Б. Иногда уровни без пазлов как таковых, иногда без платформера как такового. Но в целом это очень милый и достаточно короткий проект.
На прохождение может уйти час или меньше.

Ключевая фишка: раздробленность экрана. Таким образом, если представить путь от А до Б по точкам 1, 2, 3, 4 , где каждая точка - отдельный экранчик, то игра зачастую меняет это так, что вы будете видеть что-то вроде 1, 4, 2, 3. Разумеется этих экранчиков может быть десяток и больше. Эта фишка очень сильно усложняет игровой процесс, и одновременно является основной, из-за чего игра остается уникальной.

Главная проблема игры - садизм разрабов. Вы можете собирать сердечки для максимального счета (счет не влияет на степень прохождения или получения идеальной игры), но игра так устроена, что вы теряете по 1 сердечку (не уходя в минус) за смерть любого из персонажей, и каждый раз. Это пеналити не приносит совсем никакого удовольствия, скорее раздражает. Это как услышать от разраба ""хаха, лузер!"", но на деле вы (1) умираете, (2) ждете респаун N секунд, (3) наблюдаете как портится счёт (который ни к чему в целом).
Людей это раздражает. Раздражает что им тыкают носом в каждую ошибку, при том что игра сама по себе устроена как прохождение методом проб и ошибок.
Это как наказывать за то, что ты играешь так как задумано.

[h1]Приятности:[/h1][list][*]Красивое пиксельное исполнение. Кроме того всё разбавлено симпотичными анимациями.
    [*]Оригинальная задумка (на своем опыте ни одной подобной игры не встречал, вообще)
    [*]Непродолжительная, хватит на 1 вечер, и легко получить 100% достижений
[/list]
[h1]Отторжения:[/h1][list][*]Конфликт идей между поощрениями за хорошую игру и провокацию на совершение ошибок
    [*]В сети есть разные видео, гайды и прочее. Кажется, в какой-то момент игру обновили, добавив новые уровни, о которых даже нигде не упоминается. Так вот, планка БДСМ в них просто зашкаливает, превращая милый ненапрягающий пазл в Super Meat Boy.
    [*]Вместо того, чтобы добавить новые механики и идеи в игру, разраб больше баловался добавлением чертовой кучи мини-экранчиков, что не привносит никакого разнообразия в геймплей, но может стать раздражителем игрока.[/list]

[h1]Итог:[/h1]

Взять по скидке. Пройти за вечерок-два. Выбить достижения. Забыть.
Игра запомнится оригинальной идеей фрагментированного экрана, но... больше ничем.

You see only fractions of each level through a kaleidoscopic collage of windows, and you must navigate your three companions to the end gate using the limited information you are given.  There's something beautiful about the broken-up aesthetic, and it creates a mixture of both curiosity and hesitance as you prepare to cross into the unknown when you reach the edge of any given window and can't see where your character will end up next.  Even more exhilarating is when you are given the power to rearrange the windows and cross from one to the next at will (although this mechanic is limited to certain levels, depending on the design of the particular area).

The creators seemed to realize the best way to solve each puzzle is often to take a leap of faith, crash into some spikes or a pit or water, and add that new bit of info to your mental map of the complete level.  So with unlimited lives and time, you are free to enjoy the lovely pixel art and soothing ambient music at your own pace.  For the completionist, there is the added challenge of collecting all the pink hearts in each level without dying, which brings some measure of frustration but also accomplishment once you get them all.

Gier, które są tak nieszablonowe jak ""Where is my Heart?"" jest na prawdę niewiele. Mechanika ekranu jest bardziej rozbudowana niż nam się na pierwszy rzut oka wydaje. Wyświetlana plansza nie jest podzielona na równe fragmenty, a niektóre miejsca mogą wystąpić nawet kilkukrotnie.  Chociaż teren widzimy prawie cały, w głowie samodzielnie musimy złożyć go do kupy i zapamiętywać lokalizację poszczególnych fragmentów. Często zdarza się, iż będąc pewni ułożenia platform, okazuje się iż zamiast na gruncie, lądujemy między kolcami.  Pomieszanie naszego widoku nie jest oczywiście jedyną mechaniką. W grach dostępne są różne power-upy, z pozoru prosta platformówka nieraz nas zaskoczy. Fakt, iż bohaterów jest trzech też nie pomaga. Często będziemy musieli przechodzić przez niebezpieczne pułapki trzy razy pod rząd, mając na uwadzę iż upadek może oznaczać rozpoczynanie całego procesu od nowa. Do opisania tytułu nie użyłbym jednak przymiotnika ""frustrujący"". Wszystkie śmierci wydają się sprawiedliwe, dzięki nim lepiej poznajemy poziomy. Cukierkowa grafika i ośmiobitowa muzyka sprawia, że aż chcemy przy tytule zostać kolejne kilka minut. Jest to moim zdaniem tytuł jak najbardziej godny polecena miłośnikom wszelkich platformówek, oraz tym, którzy są fanami oryginalnych pomysłów i niecodziennych rozwiązań.",1469117439,1517845292,True,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Whenever I found myself stumped it never lasted more than a minute or two, and then the layout of the puzzle becomes clear and you get that great feeling where you can see every step to the end after trying to figure it out for a while. It does become significantly more difficult about halfway through but I got used to it. And, I was surprised by how quickly I got used to rearranging the broken map in my head. If spatial reasoning isn't your strong point though, this will probably be quite difficult. 

The art is adorable. The sound design and music are great and create a very relaxed atmosphere that doesn't distract you from the puzzle but rather draws you in.

My main complaint would be that the parts where you use the rainbow spirit to flip the screen around can feel a little tedious and try-fail try-fail sometimes. But, that feeling never lasted long and I pretty much always ended those levels feeling very satisfied.

Let me start with the good: The art in this game is very nice. From the pixel-art style to the subtle transformations animations, coupled with the ambient sounds and so on, it's all very nice. As well, the concept of the game is very good. You're given a sort of fragmented level wherein you try and collect hearts.

The big problem I have with this game is that if you should die at any point, you basically lose your progress on that level. I.e. if you want to get 100% completion of a level (colect all the hearts), if you make a single error, you have to restart the level. I'm not a massive fan of that.

Also, in a lot of cases the level will rely on trial and error to complete it. Given that there are part where you can figure it out using logic, I don't think that making the player resort to trial and error to figure things out is a good approach to take in your level design.

So, it's an okay game, but I really think it needs some changes to be truly a good game.

The only actual goal in a given level is figuring out how to get from start to finish, and anything else is entirely optional. There are no enemies, there is no time limit, and you have infinite lives. You can collect hearts if you want to, which you will lose each time you fail. The level-select screen lists the highest number you've collected in a single run, which is a goal you can work toward if you want to. Although there is one achievement tied to collecting these hearts, there is a single level where this can be earned easily.

The game features 26 levels in the main game plus 4 ""bonus"" levels. Each level can be solved in a matter of minutes, giving at least an hour of playtime. Some levels may of course take longer to figure out, and collecting the hearts without dying can multiply your playtime substantially, I thought the fragmented screen mechanic was used well enough to hold my interest, although there were at least some bits pertaining to collision that were frustrating.

Its main feature (shattered screen) is fairly unique, but sometimes it ends up feeling like more than just a simple inconvenience. While it's certainly the thing that makes this game in any way challenging, there are times when it makes a jump that's challenging enough on its own absolutely obnoxious.

The game's main downside is that if you die, you get penalized by making it impossible to collect all hearts in a stage, ultimately forcing you to restart the entire thing if that's what you're after. I'm not entirely sure what was going through Bernie's head when he decided that this was a good idea. To make the whole process even more frustrating, there is no quick restart button or menu option. Every time you wish to restart you have to exit to the stage selection screen and load the stage again, which ends up being a chore after you fail a precision jump by a milisecond for the umpteenth time.

The story and relationships between the characters feel rather shallow. While I don't necessarily need a story in a simple platformer, I do expect something a little more substantial than what Mario had 30 years ago.

That means the levels you lead these fellows through are broken into mixed-up tiles, some that overlap and others that are in reverse order. If that sounds like a pain in the ass to navigate, you’re absolutely right. It’s a neat gimmick for about five minutes but after that the extra mental exertion required to keep it all straight starts to wear you down. Plus some of the connections require leaps of faith or pure guesswork, and when you have to be totem-stacking three slow monsters to get anywhere the time spent adds up.

There are other puzzles like bonking same-colored boxes with your monsters and collecting nondescript hearts to make platforms appear. Your critters can combine and transform into three special monsters, one of which can rotate the level fragments into new configurations. This is used heavily once introduced, and though it sounds neat it only adds more headaches. You’ll be expected to perform complex midair shifting combos, and rotating him into a wall is instantly deadly. Despite the frustrations I was still able to get halfway through the game in about 45 minutes, and that was more than enough for me. It’s a fine concept and I love the adorable art, but it just doesn’t translate into a fun time.

I see people are divided on this game, and I can see why. Personally, I agree that it is annoying the game is set up to force trial and error, jumping where you don't know to land, and lots of repitition. It is kind of cool how it being slip up plays with your mind and you make mistakes you shouldn't because you're tripped, but that only happens sometimes. Most of the time it's just dumb. The platforming is boring and the game is repetitive. It's mostly just a puzzle game. You are forced to control 3 guys instead of one, to triple the annoyance, and you get just from point A each level to point B. You use the same 3 abilities, and jump on boxes to get hearts. This never changes and gets old fast. It is dumb how there is no ability to sue controllers in a game made for it. Also there is no story. The graphics are terrible. Some of the powers, especially the spinning the level, can be confusing on how to use, and are so finicky because you have to be in the exact perfect position or you will end up in a wall or die, which is annoying. The game is just pretty meh, but sometimes it can be fun to figure the puzzle out yourself. Other than that not much to see here.",1440883546,1440895431,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The main gimmick is hiding information from the player, for no other reason than to be annoying. A few cases you can vaguely piece together the world but a lot of times it's just pure trial and error figuring out where everything is.

There's one character who can rotate pieces of the world and it's trial and error to figure out where you need to start and end in the map because there's not much indication of where you'll end up.

When you start most levels, you have to wait for all three characters to come in from the door, which takes something like 10 seconds, and is unnecessary on almost every level. It's really tedious. Add to that the slow pace of the gameplay and there being no quick restart, and you have got a colossally slow-paced, tedious mess.

I think there's a few shreds of an idea buried in the stack of trash, but I really, strongly recommend not playing this game. I actually gave up on the first bonus level, which is, no joke, essentially fumbling around mostly blind trying to figure out where the next platform is, and one mistake and you have to restart from the beginning.

De FEZ, ce jeu en garde aussi quelques mécaniques. Les différents tableaux fonctionnent en effet en trompe-l'oeil. Vous aurez l'impression dévoluer dans un miroir brisé, ce qui signifie qu'en vous déplaçant vers la droite vous pourrez très bien vous retrouver en haut à gauche de l'écran.

Beaucoup de monde critique la très faible durée de vie de Where is my Heart en arguant qu'il se termine en 1h. Alors certe: vous n'êtes pas obligés de terminer le jeu pour avoir tout les succès et vous n'êtes pas non plus obligé de faire tout les niveaux pour atteindre la fin, pas plus que vous ne devez récupérer l'ensemble des coeurs du niveau. Mais tout le challenge se retrouve ici justement: récupérer tout les coeurs et surtout: ne pas mourir.

Il m'aura donc fallu 4h pour atteindre mon objectif. Mais peut-être que mon arthrose de quart de siècle commence à me faire souffrir...

Le plus gros bémol du jeu est, à mon sens, l'absence de détection de manette. Étant un aficionados du pad, j'ai toujours un peu de mal lorsqu'il s'agit d'avoir de bons réflexes au clavier. Si vous êtes comme moi, il faudra donc passer par un programme comme JoyToKey et configurer les quelques commandes en jeu. C'est l'histoire d'une ou deux minutes. Cependant, les manette xbox360 ayant ce gros défaut d'être un chouyat trop sensibles, il m'est arrivé de mourir à cause d'une infime pression éfleurant la mauvaise croix directionnelle.

Ceci étant dit, Where is my Heart reste un très bon petit jeu et devrait ravir ceux qui ont déjà apprécié FEZ, Braid ou encore The Bridge.

各ステージは断片化されたマップの破片がバラバラに配置されており、マップがどうなっているのかを推測しながらプレイしていく必要がある。例えて言うなら、様々な方向から撮影した映像を頭の中で1つにまとめるような空間把握能力が必要だ。自分を映した複数の監視カメラの映像のみを見て行動するといったイメージで良いだろう。この断片化されたマップがこのゲームのパズルをユニークなものにしている。
ただし、難易度バランスについては良いとは言えない。ステージ開始直後で方向キーを押してないと死ぬといったイジワルなレベルデザインと断片マップの組合せで状況確認もままならない理不尽さがあるからだ。操作テクニックにしてもやや説明不足さが感じられる。死んで覚えるゲームにしては即リトライができないために全ステージパーフェクトを取ろうとすると非常に大変だと思う。

[b]Minor Cons:[/b]
Rainbow spirit’s ability to jump out of the puzzle and fly around is a little difficult to use with the controls sometimes
Bat king’s ability to see and use special terrain felt disconnected from the other abilities and wasn’t used to its fullest potential

Although I’m usually not a fan of pixel graphics on anything other than arcade style games, I found the art and sound effects of Where is my Heart? very pleasing. The atmosphere the game works to create is very fitting of three little tree spirits on an adventure. The exact story of that adventure is a little hazy as the game tries to tell it wordlessly through the first and last levels and you’d learn more by just reading the steam page description, but the mood is there. Most of my complaints are around the special abilities of the characters. Rainbow spirit if often not as responsive as I’d like to buttons relating to his special abilities and the requirement to jump before rotating yourself out of the puzzle to drop into a new screen sometimes moves you into another screen and your rotation happens from that place instead. Bat king’s ability to find hidden ground to stand on is only useful for him but somehow the hidden holes he finds the others can walk into. Of course, if they stop inside the hole and bat king moves away they’ll phase into solid matter and die. All that said, the game stuck to its cute and childish roots with random amusing sayings from the characters between levels and a lot of effort was put into the puzzles to really utilize all the spirits’ skills and the player’s ability to mentally rearrange the fragmented screens. Clever use of background patterns, made more clear by the pixel graphics, provided ample clues as to how the pieces of the level were actually arranged relative to each other. Overall the game was a cute and short with puzzles that stretch the player’s visualization abilities.",1433273803,1433273803,True,17,4,0.656270265579223633,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Is it a platformer?  Is it a puzzle game?  Well, it's a little of both.  Okay okay, so that was a generic opening, but it is what it is.  Where is my Heart is unique among puzzle platformers in that the levels are broken-up into fragments.  As the player explores to the edge of one segment, they must watch the rest of the screen to see which segment the character will be navigating next.  It's a little bit of spice that makes what would otherwise be a bland and straight-forward platforming game into a puzzle, almost in the literal sense as the player is required to look at a jumble of pieces, and try to make-out the greater whole.

Story-wise, I couldn't tell you what's going on.  I remember reading a quick summary on the store page, but the game itself doesn't make much mention of it, and that's fine.  During the game, the player controls one of three members of a monster family.  One looking like a Domo wannabe, one orange thing, and a vampire, because of course there's going to be a vampire.  The player must toggle between them to navigate the levels; using them as stepping stones to reach higher ledges, or unlocking character-specific locks that reveal a passage elsewhere on the level, and even forming a sort of totem to turn the top member into a special spirit beast.

Yes, each member can turn into a special spirit beast, and it's often required to do-so in order to complete the level.  The brown monster turns into a forest spirit that can double-jump, allowing him to reach higher platforms; meanwhile the other two members of the family turn into spirits so that he can take them with him.  This allows the player to reach areas that would otherwise require someone to be left behind after being used as a stepping stone without needing to leave anyone behind.  The orange monster turns into a rainbow spirit that lets you rotate the segments while she remains in the same spot on the screen, thus allowing her to skip around the stage (though it has its risks if the player tries to ""teleport"" into solid ground, or stays in a space without a segment).  Finally, the gray monster (the vampire) turns into a bat spirit that can see hidden passages and platforms that he can use so that the other two can use him as a stepping stone.

The levels are short, but sweet.  It's a case of quality over quantity, allowing the player to focus on a smaller playing field while trying to figure out how to navigate the heroes to the end goal.  Every level has two goals.  The first is to simply get each hero to the end goal, and the second goal is to collect all hearts without letting anyone die.  The first goal is oftentimes simple enough, where some of the levels will really stretch the player's mind to figure out where that heart with very little context clues in its tiny segment might be hiding in what would otherwise be plain sight if the level wasn't broken-up into scattered segments.  The only real hassle is that once the path to the end goal has been opened up, it can feel like a bit of a chore having to manually walk the other two characters over there to finish the level.  Some levels require the other characters to take a new path, but for most levels it's just selecting the next character to walk the same path three times.

What few faults this game has are out-weighed by it's over-all charm, so I can definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good puzzle/platformer.",1410564582,1410564582,True,6,0,0.588345646858215332,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Definitely recommend this game.

It's filled with cute 8-bit music, lovable characters and an easy to follow storyline.  

However, the game is rather difficult as the levels go on. You basically have to play russian roulette with where is safe to walk, jump, fly, etc; This is because the entire world in this game is jumbled up like a jigsaw puzzle, and you never know where you'll end up. (This also makes the gameplay really frustrating, but worth it in the end).

As well as the challenge they have throughout this game, I've found out that every time you die, your way out (a tree) eats black hearts, which of course are seen as a bad thing. Eventually the tree becomes miserable, though I haven't gotten so far as to find out what happens when they ingest too many corrupt pumping pixels.

A little later in the game, you're able to add all of your little characters together to create one with special powers. There are specific boxes that you can jump on in different levels. With these boxes, your characters must jump on each other as a tower and make sure a certain colour is on top; (The game itself will guide you with this). 
The boxes that I've encountered so far are pretty neat. One of them requires the orange character to be on top. This turns him/her into a flying white cube angel that can rotate the map, but will deteriorate if left outside of it for too long.

The other box, I'll leave you to figure it out.


All in all, I really enjoy this game, even as someone who usually isn't into these sort of styles. It opened me up and did NOT have me wondering where my heart is! :-)",1409360831,1409360831,True,2,0,0.546599507331848145,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Diesmal geht es um “Wo ist mein Herz?” Tja das kann ich euch auch leider nicht sagen, wo sich euer Herz befindet. Vielleicht am Rechtenfleck wie es sein sollte und somit Sozial wie auch Mutig oder vielleicht doch etwas zu weit Rechts das ihr euch bei mir unbeliebt macht. Klar ist, mein Herz brennt und damit komme ich nun zum Spiel.

[b]Where is my Heart?[/b] ist ein Spiel vom kleinen Entwickler Team namens [i]Die Gute Fabrik[/i] und so gut wie die Firma sich beschreibt, so gut finde ich das Spiel. Denn es ist mal wieder ein Kopffi*** Spiel wie man es noch nicht so kennt.

In [b]Where is my Heart?[/b] spielt ihr gleich drei kleine Waldgeister auf der suche nach ihrem Zuhause, einem großen Baum namens  Heart Tree (Herzbaum). Dieser steht für das Symbol das Herz des Waldes.

Zwischen diesen Waldgeistern wird per Tastendruck gewechselt. Somit könnt ihr diese unterschiedlich Steuern. Das ist auch von Nöten, den nur gemeinsam schafft ihr die kniffligen Levels. Diese Levels sind bestückt mit jeder menge Herzen die ihr sammeln müsst, um neue Wege freizuschalten um zu dem Ausgang zu gelangen.

Klingt ganz einfach, ist es aber doch nicht so den hinter Where is my Heart? verbirgt sich mehr als nur Pixelherzen und kleine Waldgeister. Denn jeder dieser hat eine Fähigkeit die nur durch das Stapeln der Waldgeister auf einer Plattform Aktiviert werden.

Der Orange Waldgeist verwandelt sich in ein [b]Rainbow Spirit[/b] (zu deutsch [i]Regenbogen Geist[/i] ) und kann das ganze Level für sich und die anderen Waldgeister passend drehen. Da verliert man doch schon ab und zu den Durchblick.

Der Braune Waldgeist dagegen verwandelt sich in einen [b]Antler Ancestor[/b] ([i]Geweih Vorfahren[/i] ) der Doppelsprünge vollführen kann und somit ganz nützlich ist den oft gibt es Bereich die nur er erreichen kann.

Der Graue Waldgeist hat eine coole Verwandlung die mich an Batman erinnert. Den er ist der [b]Bat King[/b] ([i]Fledermaus König[/i] ) der mit seiner Fledermaus Fähigkeit, nein nicht fliegen sondern verborgene Stufen benutzen kann (Nur er kann diese sehen und nutzen).

Hier zu sehen die Fähigkeit von Rainbow Spirit:

Die [b]Steuerung[/b] ist dazu [b]ganz einfach[/b] und unkompliziert gehalten und trotz das dies Spiel für PS3 und PS Vita gibt hat es kein Controller Support für den PC. Kein Must Have aber so bleib ich bei der Tastatur & Bildschirm statt am TV. 

Somit bedanke ich mich bei dem Team von Die Gute Fabrik für ein super Zeitvertreib Spiel das sogar Errungenschaften besitzt, das den Spielspaß weiter antreibt.

[b]Fazit:[/b]

Für die, die gerne Rätsel lösen und auch für kleine die das Räumliche Denken erweitern möchten ist dieses Spiel empfehlenswert. Dabei tut es auch dem Geldbeutel nicht weh und ist jeden Cent wert. Für mich eine klare kauf Empfehlung!

[b]Where is my Heart gibt es auch für die PS3 und Vita über den Playstation Store.[/b]

断片化されたフレーム間を移動したり、空間を回転させたりとFEZっぽい要素もありますが、主軸は特技の違う3人のキャラを随時切り替えつつステージをクリアする古典的名作アクションパズルゲーム『バイキングの大迷惑（原題：The lost Vikings）』に近い（ただし敵キャラは一切登場しません）。
元々は2011年に海外でPSN向けに配信されたゲームらしい。

ハートを集める要素がありますが集めなくてもゲームは進められますし、実績もコンプできます（もしかしたら、全部集めるとエンディングが変化したりするのかもしれません）。
ハートを集めようとするなら、そのステージ間ノーミスで進めなければならないので大変。フレーム間の繋がりが把握しにくいため（それがこのゲームのキモでもあるんですが）、基本落下やトゲで死んで覚えることになるのでその点で若干人を選びます。

The idea is simple; the level is split up into several little windows all containing parts of the level, and some of them overlapping each other. So if you walk in a straight line you'll appear in a different window after just a few steps (which can basically be anywhere on the screen), all this while still walking straight, mind you. It's a difficult concept to explain and really needs to be seen in action to understand it all. It's confusing at first, but once it clicks it's one of the best and charming puzzle games you'll ever play. 

It's short, with its 26 levels (2 hours) of gameplay, because it's also the only way to keep the idea fun and fresh. Any longer and it wouldn't have made such an impact. Well, or maybe less anyway. 

There's also a story behind all the puzzling and it too is charming, and even a bit sad. The retro graphics help set the mood and they truly fit this amazing little game. And the music manages to support the game in a relaxing way.

Where Is My Heart? is highly recommended and needs to be played by as many people as possible.

I guess the big question on whether it's a good buy or not would be how long it is - just getting into it, there are certainly times that it feels like it ought to be one of those free flash games.

I don't know quite what it is about the mechanics that appeal to me so much more; there's a spark of genius in the it, certainly, but i think it's the execution more than the mechanics or gameplay that's making me enjoy it so much.  

The sounds are also just perfect.  I think I could just sit and listen to someone playing this.  (I also wish I had an hour long version of the promo video, listening to the sounds and the woman talking there is the most relaxing thing ever)

Perhaps I'll have more to say as I get through this, but it's lovely and cute, but most of all fun.  It's the first puzzle game in a while that I've tackled where grinding on the same puzzle to get a perfect score is a thing I want to do, not a chore.

It's a rather existential question that I wouldn't have an immediate answer to. Perhaps with a loved one, or a place I am or long to be; at any one time my heart could be any number of places or nowhere at all, if I'm feeling especially down. Where is my Heart, the game, doesn't concern itself as much with metaphorical musings or heavy philosophical discussion, but all the same invites a certain curiosity to it. Even when saying little, there's a distinct undertone of the developers hinting at something more meaningful than the journey of a trio of monsters to find their magical tree, which feels trapped just beneath the surface longing to get out.

Before I get ahead of myself, Where is my Heart is a puzzle platformer best summed up as a walk-in sliding puzzle. The world has become shattered, disorganized, split into various sized panes that each show but a part of the whole level. Your objective then becomes one of observation and out of the box navigation, having to traverse an area where walking through one pane rarely puts you on the other side, but instead somewhere entirely different on the screen. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around, even after spending a good deal of time with the game, but as you begin to understand it as a mechanic its brilliance starts to become apparent.

Taken out of context, the levels themselves rarely amount to much, but when splintered into dozens of screens then switched around they become puzzles within themselves. It pushes you to think of abstract paths and tests your memory to remember which panes line up with each other. Adding in a selection of special character powers only adds to the tantalizing challenge, that seems so thoughtfully planned out and lovingly designed. But for all the love and care that evidently went into making WIMH, all throughout the experience it seems almost scared of becoming too clever, or inserting too much personality into the level designs.

The outcome of this is a game that lacks substance. Levels are enjoyable to navigate but disconnected from each other and unmemorable in their own right. When I saw the end after only two hours, I couldn't help but feel like much of the game was a missed opportunity to use such an original mechanic, which never seemed to evolve past what was seen in the first few levels. This doesn't mean I disliked WIMH, but I was disappointed that it made such shallow use of its design concepts, instead playing it close to the chest with a game that's cute but not especially inspired beyond its core mechanic, and as such will likely fade from my memory rather quickly.

All that aside, Where is my Heart is still a rather deliciously adorable adventure that is worth undergoing if you can accept it for what it is. The charming ascetic and soothing audio design goes a long way in making up for its underwhelming ambition, to the degree I doubt I could legitimately hate the game even if I wanted to. Much the same as a children book, it's simplistic by nature even to its own detriment, but still incredibly easy to fall in love with and want to revisit again and again.

So where is my heart? I suppose right now it's being held captive by an enchanting little game that wants so much to love you too, if only for a short while.",1401478022,1401479021,True,23,0,0.647378981113433838,4,False,False,False,False,,,

Behind its cuteness overload lies a gameplay design that is exceptionally complex and unique. The stages are fragmented into multiple disorganized segments which makes navigating through them a real challenge. There is a fine balance between platforming and puzzle solving. You're required to be cautious and constantly aware of your position among all the scrambled segments as well as to use teamwork à la Thomas Was Alone in order to collect hearts and progress to the next level. As if that wasn't enough, the game introduces imaginative character transformations which add another layer of complexity and appeal to the game.

So understand my feeling when I say that this game is a labor of love, and that it shows in every facet of its design, right down to the oddly (somehow) unique pixel graphics. 

The premise is simple: you have three little monsters, you control them one at a time, and you must guide them each to the exit of each level. There is no time limit, and no serious penalty for death; they simply respawn at the entrance. But here's the tricky bit; the world has become fragmented, though not necessarily broken. You can see the full picture, it's just that the full picture is muddled and confused, with pieces going every which way in no discernible order. Simply reaching the exit of each level becomes more complex, as even a straight pathway can take your monsters to every corner of the screen, or worse, numerous corners all at once. 

Each monster has a specific color, which may be required when activating a block or, as you'll later discover, special abilities. Each monster can transform into one of three specific beasties, each with their own special ability necessary to complete a stage. The only one I'll mention is that of our orange monster, who transforms into a bird(?) of sorts and has the ability to shift the fragmented world in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. For the other monsters, this matters little, but for her, she can remain still, while the world swirls around her, allowing her to move to entirely different fragments that may have been unreachable otherwise.

To reach each end, you must gather a number of hearts strewn about each stage, thereby opening the door. But as you progress, this task slowly becomes more complex, as mechanics more complicated than jumping ledge to ledge are uncovered. The way these mechanics present themselves is a big part of why I enjoy this game so. See, it's never spelled out for you; there isn't a mid-level tutorial message or loading screen hint giving a dry description of how hitting a switch opens doors. The game simply presents you with the opportunity to touch and experiment with things, and these range from the simple (hitting a block with the correctly colored monster) to the complex (learning to properly manipulate the world's fragments). What makes this game special is that even the simplest mechanics are so often used in different and unique ways between each level. I often felt impressed by the simple brilliance of many of the layouts, and how so many of them would educate and influence your actions in the next. It quickly became intuitive to take what I already knew and wonder, [i]""but can I use it this way..?""[/i] or, [i]""what happens when I try this""[/i].

Each level presents the challenge of gathering every heart without losing a single monster even once, rewarding you with a special heart symbol and, on occasion, an entirely new level. Majority of games, I wouldn't care for such frivolity, but the very clear dedication that went into making each and every level stand out as a unique entity makes the practice of perfecting every single one of them feel very, very worthwhile. 

At the time of writing this review, I've completed what I suspect to be over half of the available levels, and I do plan to complete the rest before too long. Should I make any new discoveries in that time that I feel just [i]has[/i] to be in this review, I will be sure to make note. That's just how good this game is.
