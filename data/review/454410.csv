You still need to be somewhat fast to parry, dodge and attack but the most important aspect on the boss fights is understanding what to do and when since the bosses are invulnerable to damage if you do not use the correct action at the correct time.

What this game excels at: 
- Boss fights are really fun and unique: the fist fight felt impossible to complete in the beginning but after properly understanding the mechanics they are really nice to play
- Some Puzzles are pretty challenging and are all quite enjoyable to complete and since they rely heavily on physics there are plenty of ways to complete them

Some not so great things:
- You can't skip dialogues: I get it that they had a certain vision of what they wanted the game experience to be but some of the dialogue just feels really dragged out and I would definitely prefer if there was a button to simply skip it instead of having to keep pressing space
- The movement is ok: they could definitely be better and you will be fighting the movements a bit but it's not the worst, just takes some time to get used to it
- You have to interact with interest points to save their location: this is just a small annoyance but i believe the game would be a lot more enjoyable if this was not a thing, some times I forget to interact with the beacon (fast travel point) and have to walk the long path again  or forget to interact with the locked paths long dialogues and would need to check a external map to remember their locations.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It's wild nonsense through and through, a physics-based puzzle platformer and an action platformer that are somehow mixed together just jankily enough that it both works and doesn't in just the right ways.

I don't mean this as a big sh*tpost, this game unironically brings me joy. You do need a bit of patience to play it, but for the exact reason I laugh every time I do. The puzzles are both super clever and held together by spit and prayers, in such a way that you won't believe your eyes when something works as intended, and also in such a way that you can do everything correct and have the final piece of junk you need get stuck in a wall... and also somehow accidentally activate the switch on its own by doing that.

It controls a bit clunky, but the action component is actually kinda fun for how run-of-the-mill the combat is! The bosses especially were impressively seamless action puzzles to me, being centered around countering their attacks.
That said, don't expect Super Metroid from the metroidvania component. Largely it feels like the rooms are connected together to make everything feel nice and huge, but it's not really something you can sink your teeth into. Same with the frankly inexplicable skill tree, which can't offer much anything meaningful because it generally doesn't want you to get puzzle tools from it.

And for those saying the PC version is the incomplete one: it has a level editor(?! [b]how does this game have a level editor?![/b])

接下来，我简单讲两句。

这游戏本质上是一个解密游戏，但是它又加入了战斗和血条。拥有糟糕的镜头（一大块屏幕人物只占了5%，操作都不好操作）以及一个非常狗屎的物理系统。就是游戏里面有很多的石块和垃圾。你要用自己手上的工具来给这些东西塑形，构筑你过关的道路。
别看我这里记载了12个小时的游戏时长。真正流程就四五个小时，其他时间都是被这游戏系统给浪费掉的，就那个……它那个物理系统很垃圾，敌人爆出来的东西或者破坏了的场景会让你脚滑，然后你一滑就掉刺上了，然后就挂了。然后你前期做的准备都没了。这关就只有重来。又要花大量的时间去准备。。

这游戏其实后面还稍微好玩点。前面你拿着它的机制很容易就会把它认为是一个弱智游戏。不推荐给没耐心的碰友，推荐给愿意玩智力游戏，自己的心绪又跟喜马拉雅山上的积雪一样平静得碰友。

[spoiler] 以下就是我在极度愤怒的情况下写的评价了 [/spoiler]

这游戏本质上是一个赌博游戏：你得赌，赌在这神奇的物理系统下，气体会不会恰好飘到你想要的位置，岩石会不会恰好落到你想要的位置，弹球会不会恰好把你弹向你想要的位置…只有在各个不确定因素都恰好满足你所需要的条件，才能够通过障碍到达下一个关卡，这就是这游戏物理系统的[strike] 狗屎 [/strike]魅力。除了浪费玩家时间和情绪之外毫无用处:我解开了谜题。现在只需将构想化为现实。随后我为了解开机关，杀了海量的敌人、布置了许多的场景，然后最后被不知道滚到哪里去了的石块给毁了，我只得重新来过。

明明可以通过做一个步步为营的回溯系统来减少玩家在试错上浪费的时间，但是，游戏开发者显然不想让玩家这么舒服，任何一处出现失误就得从头来过，大大增加了游戏无用的事件。难受程度让我想起了自己小时候写作文。写完之后也不会去读通不通顺，直接交上去让老师难过。

你让我赌物理引擎那飘忽不定的概率的同时，是否会想到，赌桌上自己的筹码是这个游戏的好评。

所以最后我花了钱，浪费了时间在无用的流程上，还一肚子的火。而开发者收到了玩家愤懑的评价，新的玩家被评价劝退，销售额没有达到应有的高度。所以，这一切值得吗？

You need to collect debris to perform different actions, like slicing, drilling, creating platforms and cubes. Switching room resets the collected debris, so every room has its own limited supply of debris for use in its puzzles, which is a fine idea.

Generally, the game feels a bit messy, mostly due to being a physics puzzle game. Sometimes it goes hard on both being a physics puzzle game and action platformer, where you know what you need to do, but its hard to do a certain step with the right timing, causing you to have to reset the puzzle over and over again and repeat the previous steps.

When running or jumping on physics objects they move around and it isn't unusual to lose grip when walking or landing on them. When killing an enemy they typically generate debris and inert debris, inert debris cannot be collected, but are physics objects. I can't count the number of time I've tried to jump to a platform just to step on a tiny piece of debris and bounce of the platform.

The boss fights had telegraphs and patterns that were consistent, so they were solid.

I decided to cave in during the last summer sale and buy it. I have to say, the game is fun and engaging. The story was evenly paced, the platforming aspect needs a little bit more tuning (I found myself going straight thru platforms I felt like I was going to walk on just fine), I would had loved to have a double jump or some sort of jump compensation, as most 'trick' jumps came down to physics. 

There will be puzzles in this game that is guaranteed to get a rile out of you, I know I had plenty during the last few puzzle rooms. The boss fights in particular are intense.

If I was forced to give a rating, I'd say the game is a solid 8/10. I take 1 off for the physics of the game almost condemning you to reset strictly off of machine parts blocking off push buttons( there is no good way of clearing some spots of body parts, thus you MUST reset the level and try fighting the blocks falling again ).

 The other point being taken off comes from nitpicks that throw the game feel off. There are some things in the environment that will sound obnoxiously loud, trying to adjust this from the menu would lead you to believe it would be tolerable, it wasn't. There is also some sort of grime filter over the screen, with no way of turning this off. I would think that it is there to help with the design of the game, all this did was make some things look fine and others look strange. 

My last nitpick is 1 design choice in particular. There is a skill tree in this game for some reason, you are able to build towards a game play style you like, whether that is chucking blocks, using the blade, using the javelin or drill. One perk in particular is deceiving. I cannot remember the name of the skill, but it boils down to being able to cancel a drill mid flight with recall. This is a wasted skill, most puzzles you will be doing, that drill bit is going to outer space and you will love it doing that. Thankfully this wasn't crippling for me, as you can disable it via the same skill tree. It's a shame that there is an achievement based around getting all of the skills with only one being 'worthless' in my opinion.

If there is any advice I would give to the next person buying this, it'd be 3 things:

1. DO NOT TURN VSYNC ON, IF YOU HAVE 165HZ REFRESH LIKE I DO, THIS WILL MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE, TOO FAST, MENU IS UNUSUABLE. (Unpolished, don't know why this matters at all, just don't do vsync)

2. If you play on a controller and have a nasty habit of pressing buttons on accident, you might want to rebind an ability that comes later in the game *SPOILER* [spoiler] Eventually you will be able to go back in time, this is useful for resetting a level without walking to the portal to reset it, sounds nice right? WELL YOU CAN RESET YOURSELF D U R I N G  A  B O S S F I G H T!!!! It will RESET the fight and take your stupid button mashing ass back outside and think about how you flail around your controller.[/spoiler] Don't be dumb like me, when you get it, rebind it. For those who don't want to spoil themselves,  rebind B on Xbox, or O on PS controllers. I recommend rebinding it to Right Stick Click, as the game has no use for the right stick at all, safe from 'accidents.'

3. Astra Kadru is best girl. This isn't advice, this is a fact.

Closing Comments:
While I rate the game highly, I might not come back to this title for a while. It's one of those games you will enjoy heavily and might not pick it back up. Thankfully, if you do decide to get addicted to the game, there is plenty of custom levels for you to try out.

The fights against enemies are very limited as you either kill an enemy in one hit or don't do any damage at all. You just have to attack enemies in order and that's it. 
A lot of the controls feel a bit clunky as well. You can't make small jumps only high and a bit higher ones (almost not noticeable). The character movement has no momentum, you either stand or run. No slow walking. Jump controls feel weird as well. You have a minimum jump distance which makes platforming harder than it needs to be, as you have to steer your character back after a jump. 
the controls themselves wouldn't be a problem, if the puzzle were matched to it. At the beginning they are okay, but result to two types of puzzles basically:
-Kill all enemies in order
-Reach a certain point

The first one is pretty mundane, but the second type has some interesting ones. In the later parts of the games they get pretty annoying due to quirks of the physic engine.
You randomly can fall through a platform if it's angled to much, pieces fly all over the place when you hit them sometimes not landing where they are supposed to and gravity based puzzles randomly not work (blocks not tipping over or not turning as supposed to). The fact that doing basically the same thing results in different results for some puzzles really kills it, as it becomes a tedious resetting of the same puzzle just to get it work.

The metroidvania part basically results to travelling from room to room, but the only hidden stuff are cosmetics. Power Ups and similar are locked behind a leveling system which you can just farm in normal levels. Besides Hp it also doesn't really provide that much interesting/game altering.

The game tries to tell a story, but fails at 2 points here:
1. The story isn't that interesting and is just split in very very tiny bits
2. The text boxes are barely readable due to their high transparency and white font on glowing backgrounds. I really can't understand how this slipped past testing.

The game introduces new mechanics over time, but everything just feels similar. Bosses are just 2 or 3 counter attacks followed by a normal attack.

Was this game made by one or two people at GameFreak? Cause the budget seems to be atrociously low.

To the point of having a non-symmetrical character sprite being simply mirrored when you turn left and right.... When the character's everything, but symmetrical: her right arm is human, her left arm is robotic. Or the other way around if you just turn. I swear you can't make this sh*t up.

Ok, but nitpicking aside:
1. This game has awful graphics - art is good, but the technical side lacks polish and basic stuff like anti-aliasing so the sprites don't look like garbage.
2. The writing is typical awful ""been there, seen that"". The dialogues are just unbearable if you've played more than two japanese games with written dialogues.
3. Gameplay seems to be more of a proof of concept. That's not completely fair for me who only played for half an hour (and had enough), but the game feels half baked.
4. Overall, the budget shows. I can't believe this game was made by GameFreak - feels like one of those indie games usually made by a very small and amateurish studio, or even one person.",1687103725,1687105414,False,13,1,0.560079514980316162,2,True,False,False,True,,,

ストレスフルなのが操作性
通常の横移動や空中制御は結構いい感じなんですが、このゲームはその構造上斜めの地形に立つ事が結構あります
その際、段差から飛び降りるようなモーションを取るのですが、このゲームなぜか段差から飛び降りる最に横方向のベクトルがそこそこかかります
すると何が起きるかというと、高頻度で針山（即死床）に落とされます…
また斜めのガレキは不自然な場所で突然床抜けしたりするのでそういう場面でも落ちます
更に、敵やガレキを破壊すると吸着可能な破片以外はそのままフィールドに転がっているのですが、
なんとこのガレキ乗ることができ、かつ殴って排除できないくせにアルケーブロックなんかの当たり判定はあります
ブロックを置きたいのにガレキの破片が邪魔で置きにくいことが結構あり、落下地点にある破片に着地してそのままポーンと横に飛び出して針山へなんてことも結構ありました
幸いリトライは簡単ですが、微調整ばかり必要なパズルで解けたと思ったら死んでやり直しってのは結構イライラポイントでした

またパズルも、新能力の紹介のような簡単なパズルならともかく、
ガレキが物理演算じみた挙動をするため、終盤になるにつれて必要になってくるのは微調整に次ぐ微調整という感じで、

In addition to that, I'm having so much problems with the camera, as sometimes there is an enemy, or traps just off screen that you won't realize that you walk into them. The trigger for the next camera are so far in the distance making matters worse. I'm taking so much leap of faith that my already troublesome trust issues worsens. 

The combat is meh, specifically the enemy damages you despite they're in 'charging' animation. The hitbox extends beyond the attacking parts, but their whole body which seems fine? but I think it's stupid. The boss fights are quite fun, though lacking directions. Call me dumb but I was struggling to fight the first boss because I just don't know what to do. Why would you put a reflex based combat but without even a slight hint that you can counter them? And I feel like the 3rd boss mechanics works best for the first boss compared to the 1st or the 2nd one as it's easier. 

Movement sucks, it doesn't feel right to me. Taking damage bounce you around so much it's frustrating. Blocks make you slide around, and sometimes you pass through the physics blocks. I'm flinging from one place to another I don't even intend to.

[u][b][h1]Main Review[/h1][/b][/u]
[h2]1. Visuals - 8.5/10[/h2]
Unique and vibrant environments make up the background and the platforms of this game. When you reach certain areas with very large backgrounds, the camera would slowly pan out to allow you, the player, to get a full view of the background and all the little animations happening within it. The animations bring the game pieces to life, from background environments to enemies. There are visual indicators as well that work with the environment and to help the player identify which object is what. CGs and cutscenes have very endearing visuals, ranging from the boss cut-in images to CGs used in the beginning/end of the game.

[h2]2. Story - 7.5/10[/h2]
The story is fairly decent for a short game and does its job of giving the player something to engage with. It begins with Reika Rekkeiji, the main character, is imprisoned in a jail/camp. It deals with time dilation/warp as one of the main focal points of the story progression. Personally, it was used very well to ensure that no confusion occurs in the events that play out even with all the time warping that happens. Some morality is touched upon, such as good vs. evil, but the main focus of the story is Reika, the ruined Earth, and the robots. The end of the story is nothing of a bombshell, but gives hope for Reika and [spoiler]Amane[/spoiler].

[h2]3. Sounds (BGM) - 7.5/10[/h2]
The BGM is divided into a few parts; Main Theme, Cutscenes, Area, and Boss music.
The Main Theme is great, using bass and a somewhat upbeat tune seemingly to indicate the desolate land that Reika has to go through against the imposing enemies.
Cutscene BGM gives the same feeling/atmosphere as the Main Theme, albeit with the feeling of curiosity in the unknown being added on.
Each three Area tracks are distinct from one another and all three fit with the respective area boss's personality. A good example is the Mine BGM which sounds more happy or joyful while the area boss herself is a young curious girl who is cared for by the other major antagonists.
The Boss music is done very well, and seems to be the ones that was developed the most. Each Boss track is unique but all have a tinge of similarity to keep the idea that the area bosses are all related. Spoiler ahead: [spoiler]The most distinct Boss track is admittedly Amane's boss track. Amane shows to be losing her sanity towards the corruption and this is reflected in the track, with the track switching from tunes to fast-paced almost-glitchy-like sounds.[/spoiler].
There are not that many tracks in the game, but that is to be expected of a short game.

[h2]4. Characters - 8/10[/h2]
There are a few characters in this game but each have their own personality and is fairly well-built with regards to their demeanour. Reika is a bit pure-hearted and naive, but has a strong will and sticks to her beliefs. She gets character progression with regards to how she learns new information, handles the environment around her, and her interactions with the other characters. Every other character gets their own screen-time when its their turn to say something, but Reika is the main focus. Every other character is somewhat equal in importance with regards to the overarching story. A downside is that we do not learn much about the backstory or the past of any character. We learn a small snippet of how things came to be and even (major spoiler ahead) [spoiler]a short dialogue moment on how the robots were actually human that was turned into robots to stop a disease and the people responsible for it. Oddly enough, this was not talked about much after it was mentioned[/spoiler]. Overall, the characters are memorable as they all pull their own weight to be important in the story.

[h2]5. Gameplay - 8/10[/h2]
The main part of this game is its physics-based gameplay with action being a secondary genre. Reika uses a variety of objects and tools to solve the puzzles, from blades to cut platforms to drills to destroy far blocks. Physics in this game work very well and often produce both predictable and unpredictable results, all of which are satisfying to see. An example is using a Debris Drill to cut the platform above an enemy to make blocks drop and kill them.
A skill tree exists in the game, but mainly just upgrades your health, health regeneration rate, your Debris objects, etc. Some upgrades are far more useful in exploration such as being able to use multiple javelins while some are more useful in boss fights where you can heal during downtime in the fights. Every skill in the skill tree along with achievements are unlockable in one playthrough.
Reika also uses the main feature of the game, which is Debris that you collect to increase your attack range and power or transform into various objects such as cubes and javelins. The Debris is also the only way to defeat the bosses in the game.
With regards to bosses, each boss is very unique and have their own set of attacks and patterns. It is extremely satisfying to learn the pattern and successfully counter their attacks. (Spoiler ahead) [spoiler]The final boss is unique in how she uses some attacks from all three bosses but in a powered-up way[/spoiler]. The gameplay works well when it does, but when the physics does not go how you hoped it went, it gets very frustrating.
A bad part of the gameplay is the actual physics. When it works, it works great but when it doesn't, it becomes a 15-minute stage-reset-fest to redo the puzzle because a block didn't fall exactly where it had to be. A couple puzzles have been extremely frustrating due to objects not working as expected or just some enemies being tedious to deal with such as homing missiles that turn really sharp or a homing bomb that'll fly to you. The constant stage reset that was necessary was very tedious and felt like time-wasters as the failure point of the puzzle could be as far as the end of the puzzle but the restart goes back all the way to the beginning.
Overall, the gameplay has ups and downs. The ups make the game very satisfying to play while the downs simply frustrate and wastes time.
Side note: Achievements are sort of odd. They seem to be cumulative despite the description saying otherwise. An example is the achievement ""Watch your head"". You have to destroy an enemy with the Debris Lock (debris cube) dropped from more than 10 meters above it, but it will unlock anyways if you drop it above an enemy enough times that the distance it fell from added up to 10 meters.

[h2]Overall: 7.9/10[/h2]
Great physics-based platformer with relatively simple but well-executed and satisfying action combat. The soundtrack is great and does its job well. Characters feel distinct from one another, but mostly lack backstory or a biography of each.
GIGA WRECKER is a great game that is somewhat short, taking me just under 12 hours to finish with all achievements. Base price is a bit high so personally, I would suggest to get this game on a sale, as it gets a large discount of -75% fairly often and will make your money feel more worth it.

The physics engine is super wonky, you can do the same action the same way, but your results may vary. The boss fights are honestly very good, but get worse leading up to the final boss fight that, for the life of me, I could not figure out how to dodge most of the moves. I had to use the regen upgrades just to keep myself alive.

The Puzzles start out decent enough and really spark that ""Eureka"" moment, which always feels nice, but as the same with the bosses, it gets worse over time. In fact, because there are so many puzzles, it gets pretty bad pretty fast. I'm not one to complain about difficulty very often (I enjoy many difficult games such as the Souls series) but the puzzles become so brutal that you really have to wonder about some decisions being made for various puzzle levels, like, do I really need to cross this gap to get the scrap EVERY time the physics decides to fail, when i know I'm doing the right actions? Why are there spikes EVERYWHERE? Isn't it enough that I can absolutely destroy the entire puzzle (in a bad way) and have to start over, but I also can instantly die and have to start over as well?

Another point about the physics, the debris left behind from breakable environments and enemies can be interacted with, but not easily pushed out of the way... unless you are running or landing on it. Many times I had to fall onto a platform, only for the debris in the way to slide me off, or shoot me into an undesirable location, such as a spike pit.

Next, the English translation of the game. Game Freak, if you are reading this, please get 
in contact with me. I will fix all of the dialog, for free. Why? Because its so awful I feel second-hand embarrassment from reading it sometimes. Also, while a bit of a nitpick, why are dialog boxes only 2 lines, before it scrolls up? There is so much wasted space, it feels like they wanted you to see as little of the dialog as possible.

Talking about nitpicks, the art of the main character is all over the place. The in-game sprite looks like she has robot legs and of course her arm, and while the legs could just be armor, it looks nothing like that in the artwork used for cutscenes. Her eye color in artwork is mostly orange with a bit of blue near the pupil, but in her dialog box, its the opposite! Its like they had 3 different people making different parts of the artwork needed, and they all only had a text reference on what the character should look like.

One last thing, lets talk about a bit of the game-play, but in a more overall way. If you are good at puzzles, you will easily clear most puzzles in a single try, maybe until the last few rooms. If you are bad, of course, you'll probably have to keep resetting the room until you get it right. Now I'm not gonna say if you are good at puzzles you'll suck at the bosses, or vice versa. But inside normal enemies and some destructible environments are blue crystals which are used to gain skill points, which in turn, make you slightly stronger when you allocate that point into your skill tree. Resetting a room, DOES NOT remove the EXP you gained, nor does it remove it from the room, meaning you will end up grinding EXP without even realizing it, which sounds nice right? The problem is, if you suck at puzzles you will be better off when you fight the bosses, than if you complete them effortlessly! Shouldn't that be the other way around? If you are clearing the puzzles as intended or within the first few tries you should be rewarded with more skill points/EXP, not less! And likewise, you may feel the need to grind EXP if you are stuck on a difficult boss encounter, which halts the pacing of the game.

Was/is Giga Wrecker a bad game? 
No, not necessarily. If you love physics based puzzles in a anime-ish 2D environment, I think you'd find fun in it. 
So, is it a good game?
Not a chance in hell. If I had to give a metaphor for what this game is like, it would be; 

[u]Playing Giga Wrecker is like going onto the website ""CoolMathGames"" and playing a physics-based puzzle game when you were/are in school during a computer lab. If you could've played something else during school, you would've, but every website is blocked and you have no other options. [/u]


If I had to give some advice to Game Freak, wholeheartedly, and not cynically at all. Keep the puzzles either tidy without so much destructible stuff, or have stuff you cannot lift over your head just fall out of bounds through the ground, because the game got so much worse with the more stuff you piled into each screen.",1669436505,1669436505,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The psysics for movement are jerky and it seems that this handicap is used against the player to create an ""artifical difficulty."" Take note, devs, increased difficulty due to poor design choices does not equate to a legitamate challenge, what it does equate to is bad game design and shows a lack of discipline on the devs part. This isn't the 1980's anymore, and things like ""hindered movement in video games"" are no longer excusable in this day in age because we got the tech and prior knowledge to negate this.

画风和配乐都还不错，角色设计很好看，剧情推荐不带脑子看
四种特殊能力和地形破坏要素想法很好，实现起来小问题较多

大问题在于游戏倾向过于平均，战斗和解密占据的要素几乎持平，造成了你想要解密时会有敌人干扰你，你想要战斗时谜题在阻碍你，让整体的游玩体验并不好，整体流程就像是在需要精准操作的平台跳跃游戏中加入海量敌人，你不光要跳的准，时机把握的对，还得提防敌人守株待兔给你一拳把你打到触之即死的尖刺上或深坑里，搞心态还是有一手的啊不愧是你，与这点相比中规中矩的流程BOSS战反而更像令人放松的调剂了

地形破坏想法很好，但在游玩体验中不可控性过大，我无法准确判断我的攻击是否能够达到我需要的效果，就算达到我需要的效果，我也无法准确判断这之后被我破坏的地形会受到什么样的影响，起点和终点都一定程度上不可控，让我的解密体验如同开盲盒一样惊险刺激，过了可能是我操作得当，也可能是我运气爆棚

BOSS战很标准，每个BOSS都有数种攻击模式，生命值降至一定程度后强化全部攻击，每种攻击模式都有破解的方式，但跑图搞心态的持续影响下，我在BOSS战中是以一种焦躁的心态游玩的，多少会让我的BOSS战感觉变差，在这里点名批评最终BOSS的虫洞攻击，其他都是技巧到这里就变成了底力，我得快速连按RB同时躲剑雨，每次重打都能让我的食指疼半天，如果让RB变成按住持续吸取会舒服得多

总之，游戏体感就那样，有优秀的潜质可惜游玩体验拉了跨，建议策划给美术磕个头，不推荐大众游玩，除非你特别喜欢银河城游戏可以考虑入一下",1651698669,1651698669,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Why? This game is absolutely awesome?
Because there is a newer Version of it: ""Giga Wrecker Alt."", which is [u]CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE[/u] and will [u]NEVER COME TO PC[/u]. That version can be found on various consoles (like the Switch), so if you like the extra content (more rooms, more lore and an alternative ending), go buy it there!

Aside from that, as mentioned before, the game is [i]awesome[/i] (even without the extra content).
It features:
- [b]Completely unique mechanics![/b]
- Smooth controls.
- Really cool abilities, you can use creatively even outside of telegraphed situations.
- Interesting enemy types that are different from each other.
- Challenging and interesting puzzles.
- Secrets and unlockables!
- Insanely cool and quite challenging bossfights against well desinged bosses.
- A crazy and quite mature story.
- Really good art and sound design.
And - most importantly, of course - [i]cute girls![/i]

The game is mostly a puzzle game, where you whack your way through a series of environmental hazards, that you need to use to your advantage. By utilising the various tools at your disposal, you shape the mostly destructible environment to help you in the current situation.
It has quite a lot of (even optional) content and uses it's completely unique mechanics really well.
Sometimes, you might even feel like you are in the old school game ""Crazy Machines"", but as a cute girl smashing robots to bits. This feeling is furthered by the fact that there is a [b]LEVEL EDITOR[/b] where you can create your own puzzles or play those of the (small) online community.
Last but not least, the bossfights are quite epic, with tricky attack patterns you need to learn and their own gimmics each you need to understand to defeat them. These bosses are actually quite hard for a game that lays its focus on puzzles, so be prepared.

There are only few things one can criticize:
-  The physics are quite whacky somtimes. Because of that, you may need to replay a few riddles to get the destructible environment to move the way you want.
However, the game conveniently offers a reset-mechanic, which makes life much easier!
- There is a skill-tree, where you can find actually impactful abilities.
However, it has a few downsides: You can make progression through grinding, which is always questionable in an ""ability progression""-based game. Also, with all the upgades, you have so much passive healing, that most damage becomes irrelevant, except for the final boss maybe. Then, there is one talent pretty deep in the skill tree, that is [i]required[/i] to get a certain secret with no other way to reach it. BAD MOVE!
Again, it is not that bad, since you can [b]deactivate[/b] any talent you don't want at any given time (i wish, more games would allow this!). Also, you will probably get enough XP to unlock all talents just by finishing the game and getting most secrets, so no grinding needed.

The characters are also pretty well introduced and quite likable, even the MC is nowhere near as bland as you are used to.

1. Since there's ways to mess up a puzzle room unsolvably, most rooms have an object that lets you reset the room by hitting 'up' while you're on it. Later in the game you can reset a room from anywhere using a gamepad button. Hitting this button by accident while solving a puzzle is incredibly frustrating.

2. Because of the physics, there's a few puzzle rooms that you have to RNG because a pixel difference one way or the other can determine whether a laser bounces to its lock or is a few off. Nothing to do except keep resetting the room to try again.

3. Related to the physics, jumping on objects that are moving (either falling or rotating) is completely random as to whether you'll land on it or fall right through it. Surfaces at specific angles can't be stood on, so if an object is tumbling in the air there's a good chance you'll just phase through it to your death

It's still a fun game and no puzzle took more than a few minutes to solve, but the nature of the physics means the game requires a bit of patience.

Speaking of the good first, it has nice music, great puzzles, and some nice boss fights. It is definitely quite interesting in that regard. The art style, when you get used to it, can look nice, but it's especially great and beautiful in the art cutscene bits and overworld sprites.
I had quite a bit of fun whenever the story wasn't mentioned and I was just playing through it. Well, besides the times I got frustrated. But other than that, I did have fun.

This also does have a level editor which is pretty great to have and with it you can check the workshop and download all sorts of maps so that's good fun.

But speaking of the negatives, on the minor stuff, the translation is a bit spotty with also some typos here and there, the art style at the start can get a bit busy but as I've said, once you get used to it then it's fine and the game can get infuriating at times but with a puzzle metroidvania it's part of the style but, for the biggest negative it has to be the story, it is absolute nonsense, full of loose ends, a bit all over the place and just terrible, in biggest part because of the main character, she is quite literally amazingly dense, insane, with weird motivations if she even has some at any given point and quite possibly blind and forgetful too, she is so infuriating and the whole story being a mess as it is it doesn't help.


Saving someone whose only interaction with her was them trying to kill us, forgetting or refusing to ask the question she wanted to ask as the only motivation to save said person, being generally stupid, it goes on and on. I am glad that the three sisters are decent characters along with the scientist. Without them and the decent gameplay, this would have been much, MUCH worse to play through than it already is.

I cannot say it enough, this story is just nonsense, and no matter how decent the rest of the game is, it can't pull itself up with this massive anchor on it, and given this type of game, it needed to have a decent story imo.
It's a sinking ship, and no amount of floaters can pull it back up.


Overall, it had great potential, and it does have decent gameplay and music with a unique art style and a nice level editor, but despite the good amount of fun I had, for how bad the story is, I can't recommend this, which is unfortunate because I really wanted to.

The physics are janky. 

The gamplay puts it between a metroidvania, and a single room puzzle games (the style where they start with 1-1, to 1-10, then you move on to 2-1 and so on). I wish there was more roam around and fighting while platforming. But this really feels like any roaming you do is just to get from one puzzle room to the next. But on the other hand, I like that it does set itself apart this way. Creates something new to try. Not something i prefer, but I woudln't want every game to just be the same. 

The art is stunning, but you can see that for yourself. The theme for your abilities is interesting, and fun. The mission are just enough to make me want to keep playing. 

This is almost enough for a thumbs up. The thing that keeps it from being an easy recommendation is the jank. The jank is very bad. It's somewhat of a physics game, so some jank is expected. But I finally am changing my barley thumb up to a barley thumb down. The puzzle that convinced me was one where you drop a rock perfectly into a slot so a lazer bounces where it need to. But when you drop that rock perfectly, it vibrates in place. The spazing out of the rock causes the lazer reflecting off it to spaz out, and the puzzle in unachievable. This hasn't stopped progress, but has stopped me from accessing whatever is behind that puzzle. Even this alone doesn't make me thumb down. But it was the final straw, and the worst scenario. I tried many times to hope for RNG against the jank. That has worked on other puzzles. But not this time. Consistent jank. This game just wasn't ready for release.

El diseño artístico del juego es excelente, aunque presenta también algunos escenarios más genéricos y que en ocasiones se pueden hacer monótonos.

総合評価：50点。

クリア済。実績は9割解除。
これを開発したのは「ポケモン」で有名なゲームフリークである。
正直、めちゃくちゃ期待外れだった。ポケモンのヒットが偶然だったと言われても納得する。

バラバラのガレキを集めて大きい塊にして、どーんと破壊！という本作のコンセプトは理解する。
ただ、非常に完成度が低い。いろんな要素をくっつけてキメラ化し、どれもこれも半端になってしまった悲しき実験体が本作だ。奇しくもそのコンセプトと同じく、勢いで世に出したはいいものの、「核」となるテーマを見失ったガレキは空中分解となった。
ひとつひとつの要素は面白そうなのに、それぞれがいい具合に殺し合いをしてくれている。

もしこれからプレイするのであれば
[b]「ジャベリンはかなり重い」[/b]
これを覚えておいてくれ。

[h1]よかったところ[/h1]
道に落ちているガレキや敵をスクラップにし、更にでかい塊を作ってぶっ壊し進む！という戦闘方法はとても好み。
好みなのだが…戦闘や破壊がメインだったらどれだけ良かったことだろうね…

キャラクターデザインは多少クセがあるが特徴的で良い。
敵キャラも含め、出てくるキャラは1名除いてみんな女の子。かわいい。男の子か？と疑うキャラもいたけど、ロボットだからどっちでもいいね？

復讐だ！オメーら全部ぶっ壊してやんよ！という主人公の行動。嫌いじゃないよ！
まあ、シナリオライターさん仮面ライダー好きなんだろうな…という感じはある。
ただこれも後半「ん？」ってなるので後述。

[h1] だめなところ[/h1]
他のレビューにもあるように、アクションとパズルの食い合わせが悪い。
この原因は、パズルをさせたいがためにアクションをかなり制限していることにある。
スキルツリーがあるのだが、いくらスキルを開放しようとも、メトロイドヴァニア系ゲームでお馴染みのダッシュ能力や空中ダッシュ、上昇攻撃や2段ジャンプその他は無い。攻撃手段が増えるわけでもなく「ライフ最大値を増やす」が大半であり、面白いアクションが追加されることはない。
なお、これについてはスキルツリーの醍醐味である「取捨選択の面白み」が全くないのもキツい。
探索で手に入る「設計図」は武器の外観が変わるだけのオマケでしかないし、ほとんどの敵は決まった手順を踏まなければ倒せない。
このせいで戦闘・破壊の爽快感といったものはほぼ無く、俺がやりたかった「ガレキで敵をなぎ倒すぶっ壊しアクション」は全く存在しなかった。少しはあると思ったのに、マジで全くなかった。

物理演算パズルということなので多少無茶した解法が許されるかと思いきや、前述のとおり主人公の動きがかなり制限されているせいで、ほぼ制作の意図通りに動かないとクリアできず（後半のステージは特に）、かつ動きの予測できない物理演算パズルを何度も何度もやり直しさせられるので賽の河原で石を積むのが大好きなドMにお勧め。毒ガスギミックだけはマジで許されないと思う。
かと思えばパズル部分でグリッチめいた動きをすることが正攻法だったりするので、何がしたいのか良くわからない。

また、ボスの強さに差がありすぎるうえに順番がおかしい。
最初のボスがかなり強いのだが、ほかのボスは弱すぎて初見撃破。強化ボスも初見撃破。ラスボスも回復能力のおかげで初見撃破。ラスボスは回復能力がなければ多少苦戦するかも？ってレベルで、特別に強いわけでもない。ほんとにテストプレイした？
さらに、強化ボスも攻略法は変わらず、動きも変わらないし、大して強くなってない。ただし前述の「最初のボス」だけは目に見えて強くなってて、攻撃を当てるまで必要な工程が一手増えている。まあ動きは変わらんけど。

さらに、ストーリーに関しても前半はいいが後半になるにつれて[spoiler]主人公の動機から「復讐」がいつの間にか消え失せ、敵と和解できるかも！みたいなことを言い出す。それ自体はいいんだけどあまりに唐突すぎてついていけない。どういう過程でその考えに変わったの？[/spoiler]
あとラスボスは[spoiler]未来の主人公なんだろうけど、せっかくの美味そうな設定をまったく活かせていない。「ご想像にお任せしまーす」とばかりにぶん投げて終わった。「その後は想像してねエンド」は嫌いではないが、これはただぶった切って放棄しただけだろう。未来人のアマネももう少し掘り下げて良いキャラにできただろうに、特になし。設定を説明してくれるだけの存在であった。[/spoiler]
うーん…やっぱり開発の締め切りまで時間なかったんじゃないのこのゲーム？

[h1]総論[/h1]
パズルゲーだとは聞いていたがここまで完成度の低い面白くないパズルをやらされるとは思っていなかった。
戦闘要素ももう少しくらいはあるだろうと思っていたけど、ほとんどない。戦闘はボスとの戦いだけで、それも大して面白さにはつながっていなかった。
ガレキを使うコンセプト、ギミックアクションパズル、スキルツリーでの主人公の成長。それぞれの要素は好みなだけに、どれかひとつでも完成度が高かったらもっと評価できたと思うのだが、申し訳ない。人に勧められるようなゲームではなかった。",1632709656,1632709656,False,13,1,0.613859415054321289,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I get that it's more of an experimental game that ventures into some very new territory when it comes to 2D physics, but man, there is so much good about this game and I have no clue why no one knows about it. Like, seriously? If you go to any image board there is next to ZERO fanart for this game. I haven't heard of anyone talk about this game whatsoever. The OST has sub-10K views on YouTube. There are literally 2 people who speedrun this game. It's made by GAME FREAK. What is going on???

Game tl;dr in case you consider buying it: Puzzle platformer where you manipulate terrain in a lot of unique ways.

The gameplay is quite well-done. While some mechanics could have been explored further and the overall level/boss design could have been more complex, they took a concept and absolutely ran away with it. I don't know of any real game-breaking glitches but the way that they handled the physics was very clean and I absolutely enjoyed every inch of it. Skill tree system was the only thing that I found kind of clunky, especially since you could just farm XP and level your whole tree pretty easily and it's not like any of the abilities were really that useful.

As for why there isn't any fanart, it's probably because the game already looks so uniquely beautiful in and of itself. I was wondering why it looked familiar - the art in this game is done by none other than Asagiri (asgr). If you haven't heard of them, just go look them up on an image board. Where I come from I see their art a lot. It's beautiful, with such great use of sharp polygonal imagery with hugely vibrant and contrasting colours - so calculated yet expressive. It's not quite sci-fi because it doesn't even feel remotely like our world.

Music is god tier. I think this kind of electronic music is just so under-represented in video games because it's not mainstream. But it just fits so well here. They didn't water down shit, they went all-out and that is what matters.

The story was something I had seen a lot of times, and I can tell they might have had further plans to go with it, but probably didn't have the space to, or just planned it for a possible sequel. It was still well-executed for the scope it covered. Spoiler: it's about Buddhism. Follow the eightfold path and free yourself from the cycle of death and rebirth. Didn't go as far as I wanted with it, but I'm used to a lot more so it's probably still very adequate.

Either way, my only substantial complaint is that there's not more of this. This is the exact artstyle I like, with the exact music style I like, with the exact kind of puzzle I like.

     首先不得不承认这游戏第一眼吸引我的地方是独特的美术风格，色彩极其鲜艳，夸张的风格加上半机械大刀，钻头与美少女的组合，浪漫！
     游戏不只美术风格出众，游戏性也值得一提，本游戏是以物理引擎为主的解密游戏，游戏的核心是女主破坏地图场景，敌人，利用叠方块当垫脚石，光线折射，利用浮力，重力，弹力，惯性等解密。虽然是解密游戏，但敌人破坏在其中占比很重，加上大刀大机械块的破坏快感，经常让我忘记这是解密游戏。
     在画面和游戏性兼具的情况下，没想到本作的剧情仍然给了我一定惊喜，虽然我的期望放得不高，但剧情还是在游戏过程中给了我不少的良好体验，让我很期待接下来故事会有何进展。
     
PS:有些解密关卡仍然脑死，这时候可以试试换个思路，因为自由的物理引擎，不少关卡完全可以不利用作者给的机关和思路，用邪道方法通过，这也是游戏一大乐趣。     打折史低应该是27，因为这游戏在我愿望单躺了4年左右，终于等到个机会打折力度很大才入）",1618498585,1618498585,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False,False,,,

首先说说操作，我是用DS4玩的全程，只能说操作的设定无法理解。
1是按↑键互动。判定宽松的离谱，但凡你摇杆稍微拉上一点角度，就会触发游戏中的进门、存档、时间回溯等等，严重破坏游戏流畅性。而且很多时候是在你对谜题做了一系列的设计准备解密的时候，就因为稍微拉了一点向上的方向路过时间回溯点，所有努力全部木大。。
2是三种特殊攻击，剑、标枪、电钻。剑还好，是绑定的△键，然而标枪和电钻一个是↑+△一个是↓+△。其实这也不算离谱，但是这个事情离谱就离谱在，R2键和L2键本身是没有任何默认绑定的。整个游戏流程完全用不上R2和L2。更离谱的是如果你想把这两个特殊攻击手动绑定到R2和L2，你会发现设定里根本没有针对这两种攻击方式的按键绑定设置方式。很多关卡是需要跳跃的同时做这两个动作，不能绑定单独按键只能说非常的不舒服。

然后说一下游戏的物理碰撞系统。如果说操作的不人性化我看在美术风格逆天的情面上还是会给好评，那么本游戏的物理碰撞系统完完全全的把我给好评的想法打消。分几个方面说。
1敌人的尸体。游戏的设定敌人被打败后尸体会有一部分视觉上涂了黄色涂料的部分可以吸引起来做武器或者结块，这也是游戏的核心玩法。然而每个敌人被打败后不止有涂了涂料的尸体还有和它本身颜色一样的一部分会残留在场景中，这一部分尸体有物理碰撞体积，但是玩家的各种攻击方式又不能触发碰撞。这导致什么呢？玩家如果踩上去，因为它的形状是不规则的，如果系统判定它因为受到玩家重力在滚动，那么玩家就被判定为浮空，这会导致你按跳跃键没有反馈。。天知道我被这种情况坑死多少次。再就是很多时候敌人死亡位置刚好是你需要放结块来垫脚的位置，因为玩家的攻击没法触发尸体的碰撞，但是结块又可以。。就导致了你的结块总也放不到想要的位置。。
2各种可破坏的平台。这种平台离谱的只有一点，就是很多时候解密途中做出一个很平的平台，但是你信心满满的跳上去就是踩不到，直接穿过去坠亡。。

最后说说剧情（可能涉及剧透慎读）。

剧情只能说中等偏下，各种时髦的设定最后讲了个莫名其妙的故事。不过由于游戏体验太差，剧情甚至可以说是本游戏的闪亮点？

剧情前期没什么大问题，抛出各种悬念，引入各种设定可以说吊足胃口。但是后期急转直下。首先是三个boss的结局没有说明，中期开始剧情表现一直引导玩家考虑的是人类和机器人（也就是敌人忘记游戏里叫什么名字了）互相理解。但是最后三个boss并没有被女主消灭，甚至帮了女主一把，可结局中并不能看到三个boss在最终boss被消灭后怎么样了，反而博士说了一句剩下的小股敌人不是人类的对手早晚会被消灭。中间铺垫了那么久的互相理解结果全部喂狗？？
然后就是后期加的设定，未来人类会得一种绝症，也没有给出解决方式。不过也许是为了第二部留悬念吧，就当是这样吧。

总结的总结：游戏体验极差，手柄差点给摔了。剧情没什么亮点。美术虽然给力但是瑜不掩瑕。",1617283866,1617283866,False,5,0,0.56826317310333252,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It has waifus and phisics based puzzles, if you weren't deterred by this you can keep reading.
Even tho it's a game made by a VERY famous company it feels unpolished, from how character and backgrouds lack depth, to how it meshes together in an ungodly blur of overdetailed trash. 
But that's where my complaints end, levels may look uninspired but each has its own solution, character design is good on their own, a story is there, and while generic it has really heartwarming undertones about family and companionship. 
The puzzle themselves are set up in a way where you have to think with your toolbox of powers and how gravity and weight affects the contraption that you either found or set up in the level. 

It's really hard to reccomand but I still enjoyed it.

[h1]Cut the rope in a robot apocalypse[/h1]
Beautiful 2D physics puzzle platformer with an interesting story and really cool ideas. It does have some infuriating moments but I greatly enjoyed it nonetheless. here are the things you need to know before purchasing:

-[u]It´s surprisingly linear [/u] : This is, surprisingly, a story-focused game, even if it has some metroidvania elements in it, the exploration is greatly tied to the story progression, most maps are blocked by barriers that only go away after a certain plot point has been reached, you always have a marker telling you where you should head to and you cannot ever find upgrades outside of those markers, so all exploration rewards are relegated to cosmetic items only. On the flipside, the story is very interesting, involving some fun [spoiler]time travelling shenanigans[/spoiler] and likeable anime characters.

-[u]It´s quite beautiful[/u]: I love the aesthetics the game went for, looking at screenshots you can see that the visual look is quite striking and memorable. But as far as the cutscenes go they are quite simplistic, most of them presented in a simplistic visual novel style, and the more important of them having an unique drawing to go along the dialogue depicting the events. Whether you like it or not will depend greatly on your tastes but I found it more than serviceable. Also the sountrack is cool.

-[u]It´s, at it´s hearth, a physics based puzzler platformer[/u]: There are boss fights, an upgrade system, different ""weapons"" like swords and javellins... but at the end of the day it´s a puzzle game, those ""weapons"" will most of the time be used to solve puzzlers and destroy terrain rather than to fight, boss fights are also puzzle-based, and the entire game can be completed without getting even a single upgrade (also there are a LOT of ""blank"" and ""filler"" nodes on that skill tree), not to mention there is no combo system and most of the ""fights"" also have an intended solution based on the wrecking mechanics (like enemies that can only be damaged if you already gathered enough rubble to have a bigger ball to attack with). This s not a bad thing at all in my book, every new door lead to a new and exciting physics based puzzle to enjoy... or hate, the puzzles are all physics based so there is a lot of trial & error, and even if you figured out a correct solution (or found an... alternative one) executing it sometimes depends more on luck.

-[u]It has a lovely level editor[/u]: The game as a whole packs more than enough content for it´s asking price imo (8hs-12hs depending on achievement completion rate, difficulty and physics shenanigans) but severely lacks replayability die to it´s linearity. however it also packs a very functional level editor with steam workshop integration. This is a lovely feature that allows you to try some amazing levels made by other players while also letting you flex your creative muscles. It is also worth mentioning that an ""updated"" version of the game (GIGA WRECKER Alt) is soon coming to consoles, with an extra harder difficulty, 20 more puzzle levels and a ""hint"" system integrated into the story (in the form of a new companion), but without the level editor, these new features don´t seem to be coming to PC in any foreseeable future but I believe the level editor alone is worth the tradeoff, but you might disagree in which case I´d recommend the Alt version instead.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time with this game, some puzzle and/or physics mechanic really infuriated me for a while but I always enjoyed solving them (even if, sometimes, it was in a purely accidental ""I can´t believe I made that thing fly and land on that exact spot instead of solving the puzzle"" kind of solution). I also enjoyed the limited exploration, as it meant more puzzles to solve, and the story (while not amazing) was quite a nice surprise and left me quite satisfied.",1610396609,1610396699,True,4,0,0.596996665000915527,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The real reason for the fact I don't recommend the game however is the price to playtime ratio. It's about twelve hours if you do all the content. You could double that if you aim for perfection with the Boss Rush mode or try your hand at community content, but even then, that just puts you slightly above a one to one ration with the $20 price tag.

クリアしてラストシーン迎えると、やはり名残惜しい。
それくらいの魅力は間違いなくあった。

The developer has made clear statements that it WILL NOT ADD CONSOLE CONTENT to this version of the game. Hopefully in the future they will change this decision, but as of this writing, it remains true. I might recommend this as a later purchase as it has a different ending and some changed plot, but not at full price.

That said, this is a really good game, with some caveats, from a developer you might not necessarily know, but are very possibly a large fan of. They made this little game series called POKEMON. Now, on to the merits of the game itself, which for everything it does well, there is a bit of a downside to it.

The art style of the game is gorgeous and unique. The painted backgrounds really pop and set the mood, if only that really, as the terrain you actually interact with is more or less the same throughout. The character designs fit the world, being both oddly angular and rounded at the same time.

The story is a bit of a mixed bag. It starts out simple enough, invading aliens take over the planet and humanity on it's last legs, you get randomly shot by a stranger and become a cyborg, but are still terribly confused as to why someone wanted to shoot you. It becomes an intriguing mix of several famous sci-fi movie plots, but its ending is unmistakably anime in follow-through. I'd give specifics, but it would spoil the unfolding of the story's high points.

This metroidvania focuses less on combat and more on physics-heavy puzzles. All the abilities you gain enable you to change how you interact with the destructible and non-destructible environments, absorbing some to enhance your options, and learning what you need to do requires some trial and error, which you get the ability to reset. Sometimes though you might find what the game asks you to do to solve the puzzle dodgy as it does rely on all the physics of your actions proceeding as it hopes, or that all the debris made does not interfere with the solution, as you might slip on some loose rocks and miss a jump, or get stuck in the environs at an inopportune moment. All this can become very frustrating and I would understand that it can turn you off the game.

Boss fights are different enough that I believe i need to list how they function separately. The proceed in the fashion of Mega Man games, with a set of repeating patterns that you figure out how to take advantage of, with the slight change of having to figure out how to get enough usable material from the boss to attack them successfully. The problem comes initially in figuring out how to do that as the game doesn't clue you in to this or what is breakable. You eventually understand the logic, but you will probably die a few times before you understand this. And another issue that comes up with the boss battles when you realize that the controls are fine for the puzzles and the simplistic enemies, but in these battles you realize the controls are less suitable for quick reactions. 

At the end of the day, I enjoyed the game, but it is very unpolished and can be a bit janky. Just keep in mind that this version is probably not the version you should purchase for anywhere near full price.",1595381498,1595381498,True,6,0,0.603399932384490967,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Но из неоспоримых плюсов только внешний вид и любопытная геймплейная задумка. Всё остальное в лучшем случае посредственное.
Во-первых, головоломки хоть и непростые, но довольно однообразные. В большинстве случаев вся загадка сводится к выбору того, что и в каком порядке сломать. У большинства инструментов очень ограниченное использование: используй куб как платформу или груз, мечом отрубай весящие конструкции, буром то же самое, но крепление широкое и возможно на большом расстоянии, копьё используй как платформу (с парой исключений).  
Враги, хоть и беспомощные, но некоторые невыносимо раздражают спамом снарядов. Снова и снова повторяешь схему ""Убей врагов поменьше, затем побольше. Если не хватает размера шара из обломков, скинь что-нибудь сверху"". Из раза в раз. И ведь-то они угрозы не представляют, здоровья столько, что можно станковать почти любой урон, если не упадёшь на мгновенно убивающие шипы. Но и по ним можно немного ходить, воспользовавшись периодом неуязвимости (нет, уважаемые переводчики, не невидимости).
Боссы вполне ничего и даже могут вас убить. Правда, ближе к концу игры можно будет присесть и отхилиться почти от любого урона.
Управление кривое. Постоянно слетаешь с платформы, пытаясь сделать шаг, камера отдаляется настолько, что персонаж становится милипиздрическим, обломки ограничивают передвижение дурацким образом: если поверхность вертикальная, то это стена, если горизонтальная, то платформа, а если под достаточно большим углом, то ты проваливаешься насквозь. И вот так получается, что пошатавшись, платформа заставит тебя провалится, а через объекты иногда можно пройти, зайдя в них из немного другого места. А если много кусков платформ навалены в кучу, готовьтесь к совершенно непредсказуемому результату.
Физика ведёт себя зачастую совершенно не предсказуемым образом. Ударив по предмету, готовьтесь, что он улетит в неизвестном направлении, бросок куба происходит по трудно предсказуемой траектории, из-за чего нужно по десятку раз его перекидывать. В итоге иногда нужно по пятнадцать минут пытаться добиться результата, а иногда головоломка решается сама совершенно случайно, потому что обломок прилетел куда нужно. Я как-то даже шестерёнку кубом раскрутил. И нет, этого нельзя было сделать намеренно, он для этого чётко определённым образом должен крутиться.
Сюжет вроде и пытается быть удивительным, но я в него просто не верю. Неубедительные мотивации персонажей, немотивированные изменения (""Я хотела убить всех аджитов, но теперь я им симпатизирую"" и ""Мы затирали про высшую расу (серьёзно), но теперь мы хорошие"") и тускло написанные диалоги не позволяют им проникнуться. Я прямо вижу сценариста, сидящего над списком с чекбоксами. А концовка, что называется, anticlimatic: ""Мы победили главного босса, теперь всё наверное будет хорошо. Во-о-о-от...""
И пожалуйста, прекратите лепить лейбл ""метроидвания"" на всё подряд. Относительно открытые локации и получение новых способностей ещё не делают игру метроидванией. Да, грёбаный Дарк Соулс — это метроидвания, естественно.
Повторюсь, игра терпимая. Некоторые вон в восторге от неё, но, по-моему, она слишком неотполированная и во многом однообразная, чтобы заслуживать славы.",1572969604,1572969604,False,5,0,0.58866196870803833,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1][spoiler]麒麟臂💪+超能力💆‍♀️，果然还是工具人最好用啊~~[/spoiler][/h1]

[h1] GIGA WRECKER [/h1]
本作是由GAME FREAK制作Rising Star Games发行的一款平台冒险游戏，玩家将扮演经过机械改装的超人少女，凭借麒麟臂在机械人横行的世界与侵略者奋力一战，开启拯救人类的冒险之旅。新奇的题材以及新颖的操作可谓是本作的亮点，优秀的画面表现以及流畅的操作让游戏锦上添花。游戏包含解谜、动作、探索收集等多种元素，内容十分丰富，喜欢平台冒险类游戏的玩家不妨一试。

[h1]👉前言👈[/h1]
支离破碎的世界与失去记忆的神秘少女；
未来世界，机械技术的研究进展迅速，但机器人的入侵让地球陷入危机。强大的机器人在未来世界大肆破坏，地球陷入了前所未有的危机。但更巧的是，逃过一难的神秘女主烈景寺丽华在博士的改造下变成了强大的超人少女。苏醒的少女在了解如今的世界之后，下定决心要凭借着自己的能力改变世界的现状。
面对的是未知的世界与敌人，拥有自己从未拥有的强大力量，这位肩负着寻找自己记忆与拯救人类使命的少女，在险象环生的冒险途中又会发现什么秘密呢… 

[h1]👉游戏体验👈[/h1]

[b]1️⃣探索&解谜[/b]
拥有神力的少女可以在探险途中通过收集蓝图来逐渐解锁各种新奇的能力，广袤的地图满足了玩家心中的探索欲。
除了最开始的攻击外，主角可以使用能力控制聚集量子碎片，手持聚集成巨大球体的碎片，主角的攻击可以更远也更加强力。除了控制量子碎片之外，主角还可以将手中的凝聚体转换成实体方块，通过将其放置在适当的位置通过难以跳跃的障碍；此外，凝聚后的量子聚集体还可以转换为手刀或是变成具有弹性的球体。逐渐增加的游戏内容让玩家的探索过程变得更为有趣。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1886452474
游戏谜题以物理为基础，需要配合玩家目前所拥有的能力。此外，游戏在解谜关卡还设置了一个时光回溯的机关，当玩家过度破坏了游戏的场景后，玩家可以启动时间回溯，回到场景初始的时候，这样一来就减少了从存档点重新打的重复流程。主角在冒险途中可以收集到类似经验值的能量流，通过收集来升级获得技能点，开启角色专属的技能树。
游戏场景中有许多形态各异的机械怪物，强力的技能也对应其致命的破绽，玩家需要打出时间差或是保持一定距离来解决面前的怪物。有些怪物甚至在身体破坏之后还能存活，因此需要注意，只有将怪物打出经验值之后才意味着完全死亡。游戏的boss战难度不高，攻击模式较为单一，但这也不意味这本作对手残党有多么友好，硬核又坑爹的物理解谜分分钟能玩崩你。
[b]宁觉得宁物理学的挺好？也不看看这个游戏是谁说了算。[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1886452519
[b]2️⃣音画表现[/b]
游戏采用经典的2D平面，游戏人物以及场景十分明显的描边看起来十分舒适，炫酷的机器人与战斗特效也让游戏的战斗过程畅快淋漓。除了探索画面之外，伴随游戏剧情还有许多精致的CG不时的出现，截个屏都能当来壁纸用（百合大法好）
游戏没有配音，但bgm选取十分恰当，在玩家的探索过程中可以带来沉浸感较强的游戏体验，配合手残的操作使用更佳哦~

There's a lot of rough edges, but they got the important parts right.

The combat's not bad, but it is a bit limited--there's only a dozen or so regular enemies, they all die in one hit if you fulfill the conditions to kill them, and ultimately most of them were designed more to facilitate puzzles than combat. The boss battles are proper fights though, not puzzle bosses (in fact none of them require a specific ability). The bosses are pretty good overall, though it's often difficult to tell if you have enough debris to hurt them and not knowing leads to taking extra damage.

The puzzles are quiet good. Your abilities are all put to thorough and creative use, as are each level's environmental gimmicks. This is the first game I've played where the ability to ""create a block"" feels fun and versatile rather than just an extra step the puzzles require. Tricky platforming is baked right into many puzzles. There's often room for multiple solutions. Unfortunately, the puzzles aren't perfect. Some require finnicky/luck based manipulation of physics objects. It's sometimes hard to tell what objects are rooted in place or what'll happen if you destroy certain blocks except by trial and error. And the collision detection doesn't always handle the moving/rotating platforms in a way that feels natural. Fortunately resetting puzzles is always quick and easy.

As for the metroidvania part, you advance between areas based more on plot progression than item progression. Each level has one new ability and a few stage gimmicks, and they feel different enough. Warp points are frequent and helpful. Solving most puzzles in an area lets you progress, solving all just unlocks a reskin of your abilities. Unfortunately, it doesn't add important things to the map until you interact with them, which partly defeats the purpose.

Story is nothing special. The translation job is just awkward enough that you won't forget it's a translation (but you can always tell what they mean). Certain parts of the UI lack polish, especially the confusing yes/no prompts. Visuals are pretty good, music is bland.",1563766194,1564241622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Сама идея сюжета, прям для многосерийного сериала или нескольких фильмов для Голивуда. Но, его вроде не полностью показали.
Да и играть по 1-2 часа что бы увидеть 20 слов сюжета тоже не очень!
Gameplay
Игра часов на 9-11 (у меня 12 из-за того что сворачивал игру на долго)
Игра была сделана на Wwise (сам не знаю что это за движок, потом гляну). Как в первый раз играл (часов так 6 подряд) всё было более-менее. Под конец лаги через 5-7 минут игры. Но там надо было игру свернуть и развернуть что бы прошло.
Играл на геймпаде XBox 360 (вроде). На клаву даже не переходил. Играть на геймпаде это... просто надо было привыкнуть. Да и вверх бить, не всегда получалось. А так нормальненько.
По началу всё было просто. Уровни были простые и загадки тоже. Но мля! Под конец вроде автора подменили. И ты вроде проходил уровень по сложности 10 , а стало вроде 50. [spoiler] Нихера не понятно. [/spoiler] Пришлось YouTube насиловать.
Выводы
Я бы не советовал покупать игру, если только вам некуда их девать. Хотя... там есть редактор для уровней. Короче! Просто подумайте хорошенько!
На этом всё
7.5 из 10 потеющих подмышек!

Обожаю подобную вариативность в играх.

Также меня очень порадовало, что здесь нет моментов, когда видишь ключ или апгрейд, но не можешь добраться до него, потому что героиня ещё не получила нужную способность. Открывая доступ к новой локации, у вас будет всё необходимое, чтобы найти в ней все секреты и больше не возвращаться.

Сюжет поначалу не особо интересен, но лишь до тех пор, пока не появляются путешествия во времени. Постепенно нам дают возможность взглянуть на этот мир с разных сторон и пересмотреть своё отношение враждующим сторонам. Враги уже не кажутся такими плохими, в каком-то смысле они лишь жертвы несчастного случая. А первоначальные намерения главной героини делают её не лучше тех, с кем она сражается. В истории имеется небольшая недосказанность, что позволяет додумать пробелы и представить себе полную картину происходящего.

Отдельное внимание заслуживают боссы, геймплейно они интересны и не особо сложны, с ними приятно сражаться даже после прохождения основного сюжета. На мой взгляд, их личности и взаимоотношения друг с другом показаны гораздо лучше, чем у главных героев. Поэтому боссы запомнились мне больше всего.

Despite the fact that Giga Wrecker is obviously not the main focus of the developer, the game is of high quality, and blends together action and puzzle platforming elements quite well.

(+) The debris system is simple to understand yet fun to use. Defeat enemies to get debris, and use that to defeat bigger enemies/ access new areas. It reminds me a little bit of the multiple Kirby system from Kirby Mass Attack, which was another game I quite enjoyed.
(+) The action elements are basic and the puzzle elements aren't the most challenging, but both complement each other very well to make a great experience.
(+) I didn't encounter any major bugs
(+) Physics, especially for the flying debris, are pretty realistic for a cartoony platformer
(+) Large non-linear upgrade tree, which is great for completionists like me, but isn't necessary for beating the game
(+) Many optional puzzle rooms which reward the player for completing them with extra XP, or new skins for weapons (instead of just being paid DLC, thank goodness)
(+) I absolutely LOVED this game's artstyle (I actually use the screenshots I took of this game as my laptop screensaver), but of course  whether you like it or not depends on your personal preference.
(+) Background music was nothing spectacular, but good enough that I didn't feel the need to mute it and play other songs over it

(-) Story is so-so, it didn't really make me care about any of the characters except for the protagonist
(-) Boss battles were pretty easy once you figure out the attack pattern. Only the final boss was somewhat challenging. However, this problem is partially resolved with the post-game Boss Rush mode
(-) Not a very long game. I completed the story and got all the achievements in under 17 hours.
(-) Using a controller to play is almost a necessity in my opinion.

Or using the debris to form a blade to cut something or attacking enemies with increased range. These are some possiblities you can do and there are more of them. Also there is some kind of a skill-tree so you can upgrade abilities by passing some time in game when you got enough exp / materials. The riddles are pretty fun to solve some of them are easier and some of them are more difficult. But one of the most important thing is the timing because I mentioned before that you use physical elements / aspects in this game and at many points of this game you need to hit the right moment to surpass lots of the riddles. If you failed to hit the perfect timing don't worry because in every area with a riddle there is a sphere / orb which you can trigger to reset the area. And there are also some bossfights.

...사실 전 게임을 살때 그 게임에 대한 정보는 최소한으로 보고 사는 타입이라 초반에 이 게임을 봤을때 들었던 느낌은 렉 안걸리는 2D에 오랜만에 잡아보는 플랫폼, 거기에 퍼즐 액션까지? 주인공이 귀여워 보이네 정도였습니다.

허나 막상 플레이를 해보니 단순 퍼즐 게임이 아닌 스토리가 점점 흥미진진해지면서 이야 이거 시간여행물이었네요.
나름 짠다고 잘짠 하지만 미묘하게 아쉬운(시간여행물이 원래 다 그런것 처럼)스토리가 저의 플레이 욕구를 돋구었습니다.

게다가 일본작품스럽게 캐릭터 개성도 잘 살려있고 나름 대화도 볼만 했습니다만 번역이 조금 구글 번역인 부분이 있습니다.

전체적으로 머리를 써야 지나갈 수 있는 퍼즐 게임이지만 우리 사회가 인성과 실력중 하나만 빼어나길 바라질 않듯이 이 곳 역시 머리와 피지컬 둘 다 뛰어나길을 바랍니다.
""아니 뭐 어떻게 하라고...""
""아니 어떻게 해야할진 알겠는데!!아씨 쫌!!!""

이런분들을 위해 준비했습니다. 바로 보스입니다!!

퍼즐의 스트레스를 풀어주기 위해 그들이 왔습니다. 아니, 우리가 갔습니다.

단순한 패턴, 정해져있는 패턴. 아 파훼법을 모르시겠다고요? [spoiler]모르면 맞으셔야죠.[/spoiler]
정말 첫번째 보스에서부터 이걸 어떻게 깨야 하나..무한한 시간의 굴레에 갇혀 해메다보니 박사님께서 정말 안쓰러워 보이셨는지 힌트를 던져 주셨고 그제서야 어렵게 깼습니다. 

그 이후 보스에서도 무한한 시간의 굴레에 갇혀있다가 다른 플레이어의 영상을 보고나서 깨달았습니다.
뭐든 패턴에는 그에 맞는 파훼법이 존재합니다. [u]즉, 한대도 안 맞고 모든 보스를 깰 수 있다는 뜻이며 이건 분명 도전과제에도 존재하겠다는 의미이며 전 진작에 포기했습니다.[/u]
음..뭐, 보스 러쉬 화이팅입니다..

저는 이제 다 좋은데 한가지 아쉬운 것이 있다면 나중에 등장하는 시간역행기술을 어떻게 사용하는지를 너무 대충이었다. 아니 설명이 없었다. 내가 못 본건가? [i]""아니! 무너진 돌무더기옆에서 기술을 쓰면 길이 뚫린다는 걸 왜 아무도 안알려줘서! 내가 유투브 영상을 몇번을 돌려 보게 만드는거지!""[/i] 그 외에도 활용도가 너무 낮았습니다. 물론 사용해야하는 부분이 있지만(진짜로 안쓰면 못꺠는 부분 있으니 참고)  거진 퍼즐 꼬였을때 빠르게 도르마무를 소환하는 용도 정도?

【结语】
本质上是偏向于《风之克罗诺亚》之流利用敌人进行过关和解谜的游戏，但提升了解谜的难度和采用了更复杂的物理引擎。
然而也因为这个物理引擎的缘故，绝大部分时候的解谜失败完全不取决于玩家的操作，而是完全指望这个游戏的物理系统爱不爱你，尤其是后期的高难度部分其随机性更是有故意恶心人之嫌。

比较推荐是体验本游戏的前半部分，直至讨伐完前4名头目的BAD END线尚且具有相对良好的游戏体验，而后半部分的TURE END线的反复流程和难度显著提升的解谜或许会导致体验的下降。

Drill Dozer is the earliest game I can remember them making other than Pokemon; its like the employees were set loose for a bit and made something they wanted to. The game was well produced with a lot of charm and creativity in its use of its central game mechanic. Tembo the Badass Elephant was another surprise; creatively different but just as good.

With Giga Wrecker I see a pattern: Gamefreak is really good at making creative titles. As was the case with the other games, Wrecker focuses on a central game mechanic and delves deep to flesh it out for as many game possibilities as possible. 

The premise is that every piece of rubble, from enemies to walls, can be 'sucked in' to form a ball you carry around that can be used to clobber enemies and the environment. You can use all this debris to form javelins that stick to walls, rockets that chomp away at whatever is in front of them, or a cube you can use as a platform. Most of the challenge comes from using your abilities to get through rooms-this is the puzzle element of the game and the 'meat' of the title.

The terrain that you do break and enemy leftovers on the field leave debris which can be used as a platform and which moves freely on the ground. Later on wiring and a light, poisenous gas is introduced which can be torn from platforms causing them to move and lift said platforms, respectively. This forms the 'physics' aspect of the puzzles.

It's done pretty well and I've never been stuck on some BS puzzle that infuriated me or made use of the physics engine in such a way that you only get it right half the time. In a way the physics are a bit of a red herring: if you look at any walkthrough if you do what they do you will get the same results. There is no need to balance a beam on your forehead or obsessively press back and forth on your pad in order to guide a wire through a needle. Which means that with some puzzles you might 'feel' like you can get something going because you can move the platform and everything around you so much, but typically the answers are much simpler.

I believe its worth noting how amazing the translation is. And by amazing I mean its Google Translate, which admiteddly still gets the message across and isn't that bad, but damn. I feel as if some of the plot elements were lost in translation. Which is a bit of a shame since this is obviously meant to segueway into a possible sequel since they built up a world and left the ending on one of those, ""we've defeated the menace but there is still work to be done"" notes. The writing equivalent of ""keep your hopes up but we're probably not getting a sequel"". Point is they laid enough of a foundation in the writing to make more come of it in the future, but not so much to commit themselves to a sequel.

Oh, and shout outs to the man Shinji Hosoe, known for his musical compositions on the Zero Escape series. He worked on the soundtrack for this game and man is it obvious in some songs. He has a certain musical style that is uniquely his; it was good enough for me to purchase the OST seperately. 

Recommended; more unique, good games from Game Freak please. Because of that I won't complain too much about the translation. Definitely purchase.",1518333770,1518333770,True,2,0,0.527350008487701416,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b] 2D物理パズルアクション　GIGA WRECKER！！[/b]

[h1] [ジャンル詐欺]	[/h1]
ゲームジャンルはSteamの表記だとアクションアドベンチャーとなっていますが、パズルを解いて次の場所に移動すると即パズル・・・うん、パズルゲームだコレ！

[h1][パズルと物理演算の素敵な出会い][/h1]
このゲームの一番の売りである物理演算ですが、パズルアクションとの相性は非常に良く楽しいです。プレイヤーのアクションに対するリアクションが豊富でゲームにライブ感があり一度解いたパズルでも気がぬけません。特に楽しいのは大きなブロックを崩して落下、倒壊させるアクションです。こちらの微妙な操作、タイミングの違いがダイレクトに結果に反映されるのですごく気持ちいいです。
物理演算の影響か本ゲームのパズル要素は緻密さではなく豪快さが目立ち、パズルを解くには論理的思考力より行動力、発想力、好奇心が重要に感じました。
[i]「ぐわー全然わからん、とりあえずこれ落としとこ。おお！？」[/i]
[i]「右上の地点に行きたいけど足場がうまく作れねー！・・・ん？実は行かなくてもこうすれば・・・」[/i]
[i]「このボールすごく弾力あるけどジャンプ以外に使えないかな～」[/i]などなど。
逆に一つの方法論に固執して発想の転換ができない状態に陥ると延々とパズルにハマる危険性もあります。

[h1][合法アクション][/h1]
繊細な操作と大胆な操作が両方求められ、アクションの難易度は高いです。しかし、ミスしてもすぐに同じエリアから再開することができるので難しさも笑って許せる範囲内です。また物理演算の豪快さと相まって難易度の高いアクションを成功させたときの高揚感スゴイです。脳汁出ます。

[h1][ボス][/h1]
ボス戦は何度も戦ってパターンを覚えないと勝てない死に覚えゲームです。アドリブで対処できないボスは嫌だ！認めない！という人もいるかと思いますが、ボス戦も一種のパズルととらえて、何度もリトライして攻略することはこのゲームにあっていると思います。何度かボスにやられると攻略ヒントをゲーム内で教えてくれるので親切です。
？？？[i]「別にヒントが出る前に倒してしまっても構わんのだろう？」[/i]

[h1][おっさん殺しレイカ][/h1]
いちばん大事なことですが主人公レイカちゃんのアクションボイスが非常に可愛らしいです。このレイカちゃんボイスにはパズルがうまく解けないときやミスしたときのイライラを70%削減する効果があります。（個人の感想です）

[h1][不満点][/h1]
・ストーリーがクライマックスに向けて盛り上がったところからラストまで間延び感があります。
・エリア内に配置されているワープポイントなどの重要オブジェクトは手前でコントローラの上を押して調べることでマップに表示されるようになる仕様ですが発見した時点でマップに登録でよかったのでは？ゲートを開くためのゲートキーの開放を後回しにすると、どこにゲートキーがあったかわからなくなります。

[h1][経験者は語りたい][/h1]
ゲームクリアまでパズル要素で４回ほど解法をカンニングしました。解法を見て思ったことは「なぜ気付かなかったんだ、悔しい！」と思う反面、自力では気付けなかったか、かなりの時間を要したかな、ということでした。それはパズルの解法が理不尽というわけではなく、物理演算パズルの弊害として間違った解法にもさまざまなリアクションがあるため、うまくやればいけそうと錯覚してしまうからです。このパズルやたら難しいなと感じた場合、間違った解法にはまり込んでいる可能性があるので素直に攻略動画を参考にしたほうがいいと思います。
自分で気づかなかった発想やゲームの特性をカンニングで一度身につければ、その後のプレイで難解なパズルを自力で解ける数が格段に増えます。一時悔しい思いをしても、リベンジする機会は豊富にあるので楽しみましょう！",1517018497,1526768906,True,30,3,0.698556482791900635,0,True,False,False,False,,,

　近未来的なサイケデリックな世界でのメトロイドヴァニア風味な2Dアクションパズルです。
　ステージではアクション3:パズル7といった感じですが、意外なことに死に覚えゲーです。とはいえ原因の9割くらいは自分自身で、物理演算特有の理不尽さはほぼ無いです。理不尽さを感じるところを強いて言えば斜めになった物体の着地判定くらいでしょうか。
　一方ボス戦は完全にアクションですが、行動パターンはほんの僅かなので理解さえすればクリアは容易です。ボスの種類がたった5種と少ない点は残念ですが、このゲーム内容でボスを増やしたら要素の詰め込みすぎに感じる気がするのでこれはこれで良いと思います。

　スキルツリーによるスキル制をとっていますが、進めるうちに自然と溜まるものなので所謂稼ぎプレイというものは不要です。したい人はすれば良い、くらいでしょう。スキル自体もあれば便利程度のものばかりで、所謂必須スキルはありません。

　全体的に、巻き戻しが容易なうえデスペナルティも一切なく、いちいち読み込むようなこともないためその部分ではストレスを感じることはないでしょう。非常によくできています。

[h1]容量[/h1]
　クリア・全実績解除まで要領の良い人で10時間くらいといったところです。私はちょっとオツムがアレな為パズルで手古摺り約20時間掛かっていますが…。

[h1]操作[/h1]
　個別に複雑な操作はありませんが、組み合わせて行う為そこそこ忙しいです。ステージではタイミングを要求されることはあまりありませんが、ボス戦ではリズム感が大事になってきます。

[h1]実績[/h1]
　全実績はクリアさえできるなら容易です。全スキルの「スキル・マスター」とボスラッシュ実績の「一騎当千」以外はクリアまでの道程で獲得できるでしょう。
　「スキル・マスター」はクリア時点で7～8割、私のように下手なプレイヤーなら9割は埋まっていると思うので、埋めようと思えばすぐに埋められます。（ダルシャナC-06等を周回するのが良さそうです）
　「一騎当千」はストーリークリア後要素です。強化されたりはしていないのですぐに取れるでしょう。

[h1]総評[/h1]
　トライアル＆エラーを我慢できない人にはお勧めできません。パズル好きな人はアクションでイラつきそうですし、アクション好きな人はパズルでイラつきそうです。私自身はとても楽しめたのでお勧めしておきますが、はっきり言って人を選ぶゲームです。
　とはいえ、そこらのインディーゲームとは比べ物にならないくらい丁寧に作られており完成度も高いので2000円の価値は十分あります。ハマれる人なら安いと感じるくらいでしょう。流石ポケモンの開発会社、伊達ではないです。",1516698822,1516748475,True,9,1,0.586968779563903809,0,True,False,False,False,,,

嚴格來說，這款遊戲算不錯玩，關卡解謎的成份多過於冒險打怪。
玩起來的感覺就很像是Trine，只是不用換角色XD，
喜歡關卡解謎的朋友可以考慮入手。

整個地圖主要分成五個區域，除了新手區跟最後的天空之城之外，
每個區域都有自己所屬的BOSS，而打通這三個區域之後，才可以傳送去打最終BOSS。

[h1] 畫面: ★★★★☆[/h1]
遊戲中的美術風格很強烈，顏色的對比很深，整體畫面的精緻度算不錯。

[h1] 系統: ★★★☆☆[/h1]
遊戲的整個核心玩法在於女主角可以利用改造後的手臂，
將含有特殊物質的碎石聚集之後轉換某種物質型態。
聚集數量的多寡，將會決定該物質的外觀(大、中、小)。
而外觀的大小也取決於對於敵人的傷害。

轉換的型態，主要分成四大類型:
1.方塊 ( 主要拿來墊腳跳高用 )
2.切刀 ( 對於某些關卡需要針對性的細部破壞所使用 )
3.標槍 ( 這可能是最重要的型態，雖然也是拿來輔助跳高用，但是使用的方式比較萬用 )
4.電鑽 ( 遠距離+持續性的破壞使用 )

遊戲中，玩家也可以藉由擊碎怪物或破壞某些藏有技能經驗點的石塊來提升女主角的技能。
是的，你沒有看錯，這遊戲有「技能天賦樹」，可以強化某些型態的能力，
但其實升級的重點是提高女主角的血量!!
有個重點，就是請優先升級標槍使用數量的技能!!!!! ( 這真的很重要!!! )

[h1] 操作: ★★★★☆[/h1]
這邊要特別提一下....這遊戲的操作難度頗高。
原因是因為當你跳躍到某個位置的時候，角色會自動的往前走一兩步，
變成當你在跳某些只有一格位置的方塊，常常摔下去.... (所以要常常手動幫角色踩煞車...)

在來就是，因為這遊戲沒有所謂的回血機制，唯一的回血途徑，就是走到紀錄點，並且輕觸它一下XD
所以BOSS戰的時候，就是傳說中的不是你死就是我...重來 (1命決勝負，你沒看錯....)

最後就是關卡解謎的部分，雖然場景設計上看起來好像有某些規則可循，
但其實大多的關卡都是要靠運氣來解，常常一卡就是幾十分鐘=_=|||

[h1] 劇情: ★★★☆☆[/h1]
故事是描述在2050年的未來，一種名為MM-88的傳染病開始蔓延，只要被感染的人，只能在漫長的痛苦中迎接死亡的到來。後來有位博士發明了一種名叫「阿基特式」的療法，主要是在病毒破壞大腦組織前，將意志與記憶電子化。

而接受這種處理方法的人，其大腦和身體會全部更換為機械....
雖然這項技術原本是出自於善意，但是以物質的角度來看，這些機械化的患者已經不能算是人類了...

隨著時間的過去，這群「改造人」也逐漸喪失了人性並且狂暴化，在某位自稱導師的領導下，大舉入侵過去，希望可以藉由找到那位博士，強迫他讓整個技術的初衷改成是武裝而非治療，進而改變未來，讓這群「改造人」的戰鬥性能大幅提升。

The game is a [b]platformer/puzzle game[/b] with interesting mechanics of using debris from broken blocks or enemies to your advantage, by transforming it into blocks, javelins, sword, shooting it or just using it to break stuff, move stuff, made stuff work and destroy your enemies. Your enemies are a race of Ajeets, which are like robots who attacked your world, killed everyone and got control of all they could, using humans as subjects or just work force.

I think to me one of the strongest points of the game were the [b]artstyle, the story and the mechanics[/b]. The [b]artstyle[/b] seems very unique with a cyberpunk theme, and I really like how all the stages and especially characters are drawn, the main characters and the bosses look incredible. The [b]battles[/b] between you and the bosses are very enjoyable. The [b]story[/b] is very unpredictable and goes to unexpected routes, when you just think things were over or were too simple. The physics are very interesting. And the soundtrack is ok, it has nothing really special here. 

The [b]physics[/b] may give you many options on how to solve a puzzle, sometimes making it easier or a little harder,  there are enemies, lasers, moving platforms, shooting lasers, etc. They are not really random like some people mentioned in other reviews(mostly people who didn't beat the game), they depend on how the particles of broken debris are laying after you broke a block, or how much you have of it, but there is always an exact correct way of doing the puzzle, which works everytime, unlike trying different methods and expecting more positive or negative results. But it's good the game gives you an option to solve a puzzle sometimes in a  way that feels like kinda cheating, because of how you used your tools, like it was not how it was supposed to be, but this happens very rarely, or making it seem harder than it is, by doing the puzzle in a wrong way.

The game also has a [b]system of skills[/b] that you can level up to increase the effectivness of your tools and HP, making you have more effective tools, more life and life-regen. You also have an optional customization for your tools, like a different kind of block, javelin, drill or sword. You can find the designs for these all over the game in optional areas, where you need to solve the stage puzzle to unlock them, it gives more variety to the game. You also have an option to teleport between beacons you unlocked, to not having to run from one point of the map to another, and be sure to use your save.

Overall the game is not that hard, but quite challenging in it's aspects ( bosses and puzzles). After beating the game you have an option to get a [b]secret achievement[/b] by defeating all bosses, one after another, in their strongest form, without replenishing your HP between battles, and it counts the time you have spent doing it, so you can make a record. This mode is called the Astra Rush.

Also the game features [b]workshop[/b], and you can play workshop maps that other users made and solve their puzzles, or just to unlock some achievements that in main game require some luck to unlock. Or you can just create your own puzzle stages, the game has a special mode for that.

I thought that since GameFreak has gotten a bit of freedom from Nintendo(I think?), maybe they can make other great games other than Pokemon. And since this peaked my interest more than that other game they made with an elephant, I decided to try it out. 

And it's pretty ok, I think. It ain't great but not bad either. The concept of being able to destroy and manipulate debris is pretty cool, I just think it should had more options on what you can create with the debris. The physics in this game isn't perfect but it works quite well most of the time. Most of the puzzles are ok as well except the ones on the final levels. Those made me infuriated. It didn't helped that the floor is slippery as wax throughout the whole game, which one of my major problem with the game. 

As for the story of the game, it's okay, maybe even great. But that's my opinion on it. I liked light hearted stories with a sense of a dark tone in the background nad vice versa. The main character is up to the usual japanese anime protag in a post-apocalyptic world. One of the supporting characters reminds me of Aikuro Mikisugi from Kill La Kill for some reason. The bosses have great personality, I think. The artstyle is also great to look at. Music is decent enough for a GameFreak game.

The concept sounded cool, and the game definitely has a cool visual style, particularly the CG story illustrations and the boss designs -- a bit reminiscent of huke's work on Black Rock Shooter. There's also a great ambient-electronic soundtrack. The meat of the game though is the puzzles, and for the most part the game plays pretty well. The puzzles have a good amount of variation, including a few particularly good ones near the end where the solution is not at all obvious at first.

The game's biggest problem however lies in the physics. Simply put, they're not always predictable. This isn't a problem most of the time, but when you mess up the same puzzle three times in a row because something tipped over in the wrong direction, it can be a bit frustrating. Thankfully dying or resetting a puzzle only sets you back to the start of that puzzle, but it's still not ideal. Also, the English translation is awkward and stilted at best, lending even the human characters a very robotic feel.

游戏中的破铜烂铁和结块都收物理引擎控制，所以很多谜题和机关靠物理原理解决，比如重力、浮力、反射，还会遇到齿轮传动、传送带等。
背景设定在未来世界被一群狗屎机器人占领，女主角死了爹妈，随后被一个博士大叔所救，结果手都没了就只能用机器人的零件把她改造成改造人，就这样女主角踏上了拯救世界的旅程。

很多地方不仅需要动脑思考这些机关和地形该怎么相互影响触发，也需要在合适的时机到达特定的位置，因此[h1]既需要动脑也需要灵活操作。因此游戏本身是有一定难度的，但是会难得你爽到。[/h1]Boss战反而没有那么大难度，你只需要死一两次摸清Boss出招和可以反击的时机然后练习几次就过了，因为单从血量来说，你比Boss厉害多了。
最绝的是大部分关卡的每一坨废铁、地形的每一处突出凹陷都是设计好的，你需要掌握好废铁的量，适当地改变地形，才能达到最终目的。
游戏中的物理效果都是即时演算，这造就了游戏的亮点也暴露了缺点，由于每次破坏场景之后各种渣块碎片都是即时演算出掉落效果，很多时候那些破铜烂铁并不是掉到你想要他掉到的地方去，所以有时候你就算知道了这个房间的谜题该怎么解，你可能也会被这个物理效果急死。。[spoiler]但是另一方面你有时候也可以利用这一点进行想不到的骚操作。[/spoiler]

Você joga como Reika, uma garota aparentemente adolescente que quase morre e é salva por um cientista que a transforma em um ciborgue com um braço biônico capaz de controlar detritos por meio de um dispositivo. Utilizando seus novos poderes, Reika luta contra robôs e resolve puzzles para salvar o planeta Terra, que está em ruínas.

O segredo da mecânica do game está na habilidade da personagem de controlar e coletar detritos de escombros dos restos de seus inimigos ou do cenário. Você ataca um robô pequeno, pega os seus detritos e os utiliza para destruir um inimigo um pouco maior. Então com os restos desse inimigo, você acumula uma esfera maior de detritos e a utiliza para derrotar robôs ainda maiores. Isso sem contar que com os detritos, você pode criar cubos que servem como pesos e plataformas, criar lanças de detritos para acertar inimigos à distância ou como suportes que se fixam em paredes, e ainda pode criar uma broca perfuratriz.

As fases do game são separadas em 5 áreas que à medida que são desbloqueadas, podem ser exploradas livremente e cada área possui o seu ""chefão"". As batalhas não são fáceis, mas depois de várias falhas e tentativas, você aprende a mecânica do oponente e o vence sem muitas dificuldades. Para facilitar para o jogador, orbs que salvam o progresso do jogo estão convenientemente localizados em pontos críticos, como próximos aos portais dos chefões.

Giga Wrecker possui uma árvore de habilidades. Quando inimigos ou certos blocos são destruidos, eles deixam cair cristais. Para cada 100 cristais você recebe 1 ponto de habilidade para usar na árvore de habilidades (que é enorme) e aumentar a sua barra de vida ou a taxa de regeneração dela, além de vários upgrades em suas armas e poderes.

Os puzzles começam bem simples e com o decorrer do game, podem ficar muito mais desafiadores. Eles dependem bastante da ""física"" e algumas vezes poderão resultar em momentos de grande frustração após várias tentativas sem êxito.

A direção de arte é original e bonita. Tudo parece ter sido desenhado à mão e o design de cada personagem é autêntico e estiloso.

特徴的なのは敵や特定の足場をガレキにして、それを集めて新たに足場を作ったり武器として利用するシステム。

アクションの難易度的にはそこまで難しくは無い。
強化次第では被弾を上回るくらいに回復が早くなり、またボス戦でも数回やられると攻略のヒントが貰えるため配管工のゲームがクリアできるならまあまず詰まる、ということはないだろう。
パズル面に関してはやや難があり、同じような手順で謎解きをしても細かいガレキの破片の当たり方などによって同じような結果にならないなど再現性が非常に低い。酷い時にはどう見ても正攻法で攻略してるのに行き詰ってしまうことさえある。
とはいえそれを逆手に取れば帰り道に当たる部分から突破したりちょっと間違ったやり方でも数回繰り返せば偶然うまく行ったりするため、シーケンスブレイクじみたやり方ができるのも面白い点ではある。

■購買理由
ムービーを見てアクション、パズル、グラフィックのクオリティの高さで購入を決めました。
これに関しては期待を裏切らないものだったと感じます。

■感想
・総評
　やり終えて「悪くなかったな」というのが正直な感想です。
　アクション爽快、パズルそこそこ、ストーリーそこそこ、キャラ良しという感じです。
　良い点、悪い点は以下にまとめますが、悪い点は細かい点が多く、概ね全体的には
　コンセプト通りうまくまとまっているのかなと感じました。
　やって損はしない作品と感じます。
　私はやりこみに向けまだプレイしようと思います。
・良かった点
　①アクションのテンポが良い
　　→敵の攻略法が分かってくると、部分的に流れるように敵を制圧できます。
　　　ゲームスピードも相まって、（この手のゲームにしては）中々爽快でした。
　②パズル要素のテンポが良い
　　→アクション要素が強い為か、パズルもキャラクターを積極的に動かして解く
　　　ものが多かったよう感じます。
　　　全体のオブジェクト配置を確認して、少し考えてから即行動で色々試してみる
　　　というサイクルなので飽きずにやり続けられました。
　　　正攻法でなくともごり押しが部分的にきくため、解けなくても積みにくいよう
　　　にも感じます。
　③ストーリーが壮大で引き込まれる
　　→序盤はロボット軍団に立ち向かう少女の復讐劇というシンプルな構図に見えた為、
　　　ストーリーに重きを置いていない作品なのかなと感じていたのですが、
　　　良い意味で裏切られました。
　　　中盤以降ストーリーに深みが出てきて、この先の展開が見たいという思いで
　　　一気にゲームを進めてしまいました。ただエンディングは私の中で意味不明です。
　④キャラクターが魅力的
　　→これは他レビュアーさんが語っていますので、深くは語りませんが期待通りです。
・悪かった点
　①ガレキが邪魔
　　→オブジェクトを破壊した際に残るガレキにも当たり判定があり、場合によっては足場に
　　　なるため、トゲなどの即死オブジェクトを回避できるのですが、触れるととにかく
　　　キャラが不安定になります。繊細な操作が要求される面もあるため、足場に下手な
　　　ガレキが残った時点で即やり直しなんてこともあります。（イライラするので）
　②オブジェクトをすり抜けてしまう
　　→他レビュアーさんも語られていますが、オブジェクトを足場として利用するのに
　　　当たり判定が独特すぎる為、変にすり抜けて落ちて死ぬなんてことよくあります。
　　　ただこのすり抜けは攻略するうえでも重要ですので、逆に利用してやるつもりで
　　　プレイするのが精神衛生的にもよいかと思います。
　③カメラワークが良くない場面がある
　　→パズル要素は如何に全体を把握するのかが重要と思いますが、アクション要素のせい
　　　なのか、妙にカメラがキャラに寄る場面があり、今アクションパートのか、パズル
　　　パートなのか分からないことがちょこちょこありました。
　④ボスパートの立ち振る舞いが独特
　　→これ絶対避けられないだろ…という攻撃がたまにあります。でも大丈夫、受けた分は
　　　簡単に回復できます。（時間経過で回復というスキルがあり、一定時間回避し続ける
　　　といつの間にか全快しています）しゃがむと回復が高速化するスキルもある為、
　　　常に全快状態というのも難しくありません。
　　　攻撃を受けても問題ないという感覚になった瞬間私の中で別ゲーになりましたが、
　　　回復を意識しないでも難易度が元々高くないため苦労はしないかなと思います。
　　　救済措置のようなものかと思いますので、ご利用は計画的にということでしょうか。
　⑤キャラクターの掘り下げが足りない
　　→メインシナリオは世界観の掘り下げが強く、各キャラクターについてはあまり語られる
　　　ことがなかったのは残念でした。
　　　せっかくキャラクターが魅力的なので、もう少し絡みや生い立ちが欲しかった
　　　気はします。ただその分ゲーム全体がコンパクトにまとまっているので、仕方ないこと
　　　ではある気がしてますが。",1509274627,1542675232,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I found it from a YouTube video, posted by Gellot, of him/her beating all the bosses without taking damage. I was intrigued by the game mechanics and bosses, so I picked up a copy. It was an amazing use of $20.

Pros
-Good and interesting story
-Responsive controls, feels good to use them
-Not too hard, but also not too easy
-Good gameplay
-Great art style
-Custom levels
-Amazing music

Cons
-Sometimes gets random lag spikes
-On occasion, the physics in puzzles needs to be extremely precise
-Some animations are weird


Overall, Giga Wrecker is a great yet horribly underrated game. It needs more love than it currently gets.

==========

Recommend but with heavy caveats.
First things first - it's a physics based puzzle platformer, not an action game. Don't be fooled by the action-esque aesthetics.
Gameplay is fun and reasonably challenging, art is fantastic when it comes to stages and NPCs, and beyond fantastic when it comes to main characters, CGs and backgrounds. Seriously, CG and protagonists/bosses sprites can put many AAA games to shame. Story is interesting but is a bit cliche (you're going to predict all beats and twists an hour before they come, let alone revealed).
The only 2 negatives: it's a physics based puzzle platformer with all problems that entails: solutions are quite wonky and imprecise, you can get screwed up by your action missing by the couple pixels or milliseconds, or by just straight up RNG. Second negative - it seems that art and music is where lion share of dev effort was put in while actual coding was done by either B-team or people who didn't make any 2D platformers before. Game has some collision detection issues, some occasional performance problems and extremely wonky physics.

Overall game is great but you might get mildly(/extremely) infuriated during some of its parts.

P.S. Someone on the team had an ""ingenious"" (<- notice the sarcasm) idea to map ""interact"" to ↑ button so if you're playing on the controller - get used to a lot accidental interactions. Oh, btw, did i mention that the ""reset puzzle even if you've just solved it after spending 10+ min"" objects in game do their function immediately upon interaction, without showing a confirmation prompt?

Le système de ce jeu de plate-forme a osé des originalités, qui constittuent la base même de son concept, et qui méritent à elles seules de l'essayer. Vous acquérirez progressivement des compétences, et celles-ci vous permettront d'utiliser les éléments de décor (les décombres du titre) comme éléments fondamentaux pour progresser. Car vous devez vous-même modifier le décor (et pas seulement le démolir) pour progresser dans les niveaux, et revenir dans le temps si vous avez raté quelque chose. Un peu comme un puzzle-game. Le concept aurait pu être davantage poussé, mais l'expériencen' en demeure pas moins intéressante.
Car à côté de son originalité de gameplay, il faut bien garder en tête que Giga Wrecker est un jeu indépendant, avec ses défauts et ses qualités.
Au rang des défauts, rapidement: des collisions avec les éléments de décors pas toujours logiques (on passe au travers de certains éléments et pas d'autres) et frustrantes, mais tempérées par la dimension ""die and retry"". Des écrans parfois trop austères (skill ou carte). Et certaines habiletés qui n'apportent qu'un intérêt esthétique à l'histoire (notamment les nombreuses ""arche abilities"", qui auraient pu par exemple apporter d'avantage de petits bonus tactiques selon les variantes).
Parce qu'au niveau de l'esthétique, on rentre vraiment dans un travail soigné, pour un petit jeu. L'univers tout entier baigne dans un design post-apo/futuriste assez original, vraiment très réussi et cohérent. Les tableaux narratifs, quoique fixes, sont vraiment des oeuvres d'art, totalement raccords avec le reste, tout en appuyant la personnalité des personnages (nous y reviendront). Les musiques, malgré des boucles parfois un peu courtes, sont vraiment très belles, et alternent toujours au bon moment les passages contemplatifs, lyriques, ou la violence des affrontement. Et les affrontements avec les boss, qui constituent l'enjeu de l'histoire, sont certes assez dirigistes, avec des patterns à comprendre pour triompher, mais bien personnalisés et précis.
Surtout, l'histoire et les personnages sont vraiment bien menés, avec une psychologie très construite, et une évolution progressive du personnage principal, qui change progressivement sa vision du monde, avec une petite nuance de ""Quète initiatique"" toujours très sympa. Et d'une manière générale, au fil des bulles de dialogues, la personnalité des personnages, Y COMPRIS DES BOSS (qui ne sont pas là juste pour se faire exterminer), est précisée par petites touches. Sans spoiler, l'histoire, qui commence d'une façon des plus classiques, sans être une révolution, est très bien menée, et d'une profondeur et une subtilité inattendues au départ.
Au final, si j'ai trouvé le système de jeu très sympa quoique perfectible, je suis tombé amoureux de tous les à-côté: les designs, les musiques, les personnages, l'univers. J'espère sincèrement qu'une suite sera donnée à cet opus, en en conservant le niveau d'exigence et en en améliorant les quelques défauts.",1502563774,1502563774,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First off, this game is much more of a puzzle game than a platformer, at least the portions I was able to get through. So if you are expecting a platformer with puzzle elements (e.g. Trine) you will be dissapointed.

Pros:
Good graphics
Creative Design

Cons:
Disjointed - The different sections of the game don't really mesh well. This is particularly evident in the boss fights, when the game abruptly changes from ""go your own pace"" puzzles to ""frantic timing""
Unpolished:
Both the translation and design seem rushed.
Some areas have no music, with no particular reason why there shouldn't be any.

Seit langem nicht mehr haben mich die Spielwelt und die Charaktere eines Spiels so begeistert. Und genau darin liegt in meinen Augen auch die Stärke dieses Spiels. Es sieht unfassbar gut aus, die Charakter-, Gegner- und Boss-Designs sind ungaublich gut durchdacht ebenso wie das Design der gesamten Welt.
Man kommt zwar ca. in der Mitte des Spiels wieder in die Anfangswelt zurück und die 3 zuvor erkundete Welten, die nur zur Hälfte frei waren, werden nun auch komplett frei. Trotzdem fühlen sich die Level immernoch frisch an.

Das Gameplay macht wirklich sehr Spaß. Ein 2D-Plattformer mit vielen Puzzels. Es kommen immer wieder neue Elemente hinzu, damit die Puzzel nicht fad werde. Jedoch merkte ich bei mir, wie ich gegen Ende hin durch das viele Neustarten und Neuversuchen der Level langsam echt genervt geworden bin, da ich nicht mehr mein Gehirn benutzen wollte, sondern viel lieber den nächsten Storyhappen bekommen oder mich über den nächsten Boss freuen wollte.

Der Soundtrack ist solide, teilweise hat es mich schon etwas gecatcht, jedoch nichts atemberaubendes. Den Soundtrack DLC werde ich mir persönlich also nicht kaufen, aber ich hab mich jetzt auch nicht allzu sehr auf die Hintergrundmusik konzentriert. Vielleicht ist sie an mir auch einfach vorbei gegangen.


Alles in allem kann ich das Spiel nur aus reinstem Herzen empfehlen und Game Freak danken, dass sie ihr wunderschönes Spiel auch auf den PC gebracht haben, da ich sonst auf jeden Fall nichts davon mitbekommen hätte. Ihr habt mit Giga Wrecker einen verdienten Platz in dem Favoriten Ordner meiner Steam Bibliothek. :3",1500511450,1500511450,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, the graphics are certainly not bad, nor is the soundtrack but the controls are kinda wonky and it suffers from some old school game design in the form of ridiculous spiky death traps and obnoxious knockback. Still, not that much of a problem if you've suffered through the NES era.

However what well and truly kills the game and makes me want to throw my controller through the screen in rage is the physics based puzzles. For instance, in some places you need to guide a wall bouncing laser to hit a certain spot. The physics mean you have potentially hundreds of variables to take into account and in many cases it comes down to pure RNG if you get it right or not. Did your block fall in right angle? Did the destructible surroundings settle in the proper manner?

I quite frankly want my money back.

第三人稱動作角色扮演 
[h1]要素：[/h1]
半開放式地圖，技能樹，收集品，自訂關卡，工作坊(自定義關卡)，益智解謎，創造(奈米結晶隨意塑型)
[h1]中文：[/h1]
官方中文
[h1]劇情：[/h1]
一般。略微簡單的劇情架構
[h1]畫面：[/h1]
精美。前期開場動畫很有氣勢！遊戲的背景畫風呈現荒廢破壞的科幻感，有賽博朋克的風格。遊玩過程會穿插簡短動畫，帶入世界觀及女主角的想法。個人喜歡角色技能的呈現方式～有破壞力及打擊感
[h1]音樂：[/h1]
一般。音樂曲風個人喜歡。配樂種類不夠豐富～
[h1]難度：[/h1]
難。場景中的敵人或阻隔物，需攻擊部分區塊（或用技能）才能通過，有時候得靠運氣。因為阻隔物被推動後，會依物理原則移動，有時位置不對還是無法通過。有些關卡會有敵人擋路，但手上的奈米塊卻無法擊破，須善用技能，讓敵人移到不擋路的地方
[h1]操作：[/h1]
難。雖然操作不複雜，但部分關卡除了知道如何解謎過關外，還得有些操作上的運氣，另外跳躍和技能使用的時間點也很重要。還有一部分操作難度在於要小心不能被敵人摸到...
[h1]優化：[/h1]
順暢
[h1] 娛樂：[/h1]
好。遊戲的娛樂性在於有技能樹系統，關卡和頭目也設計的不錯～玩家得使用對應的技能解謎通關。說解謎不大對，應該說是益智，想辦法用技能通過場景，然後一路打敗敵對頭目，有點類似洛克人的通關方式，只是多了益智解謎！遊戲最大的困難點就在於 ""怎樣用技能通過每個路障關卡""
[h1]重玩：[/h1]
一般。除了自行編輯關卡可玩外，也可遊玩其他玩家編輯的關卡～由於存檔點多！個人會重複同一個關卡刷技能^^
[h1] 入手價格：[/h1]
－５０％，NT＄２３４
[h1]總結：[/h1]
[u][h1][b]推薦，個人－５０％特價入手，值得一戰。但部分益智關卡難度稍高，卡久了會有疲乏感，若能有條件的通關提示，或許能玩得更流暢！整體來說是款 ""劇情稍簡單"" 的動作益智遊戲！這遊戲讓我聯想到洛克人^^還有～那個救女主角的博士也太像死神裡的浦原喜助了（笑[/b][/h1][/u]

[h1]缺點：[/h1]
１。時光回朔的粉光常設置在跳躍平台～時常一邊按上跳，然後就回朔重來了...
２。很多的存檔點！但若能改為隨時存檔就更好了，避免剛通沒存檔點～但很難的關卡，結果一過去手誤死了，全部重來
３。不太能適應這種撞到怪，大量損血的機制，尤其女主角血少的可憐，隨便被怪撞一下就少一半血...
[h1]４。導覽地圖上的指引太少，例如有走過的地方，並不會顯示遺漏的能量柱或未開啟的門。有點不夠體貼玩家，有時玩家就為了找那個漏掉的門，到處繞...繞到失去耐心[/h1]

[h1]優點：[/h1]
１。破壞的打擊感很棒！
２。如何使用能力適當的破壞，以通過每個場景～帶有益智性的解謎
３。教學關卡設計的不錯！一步步透過劇情及關卡引導玩家熟悉技能～幾乎沒有遺漏！
４。有關卡的瞬間傳送功能！
５。有技能樹系統～也可以耐心的重複刷技能點升級。唯一可惜的是技能沒有相互變化的玩法
６。""益智"" 關卡設計的還不錯～都是讓你搭配著技能去通過的，不過很多關卡沒有一定的通過方式，比較隨機性

[h1]分享：[/h1]
１。要注意時光回朔的位置，若不是真要重來，切記經過時不要按到上！不然得重打
２。搖桿按上鍵～女主角會敬禮^^蠻有趣的！只是不知道讓角色敬禮的意義是？
３。阻隔物在移動或掉落瞬間是不能踩的！請等阻隔物 ""就定位""
４。每個敵人要擊敗，有對應的奈米結塊大小，當可攻擊時會用藍色顯示，要觀察週遭的是否有奈米塊，要先取得！
５。沒事就按一下ＲＢ鍵，吸一下精華～不！吸一下奈米塊
[h1]６。部分關卡必須善用讓敵人彈跳去撞機關，讓敵人彈跳的方式有兩種。第一種是用彈跳球去頂他，第二種是靠近用跳投的方式向敵人丟彈跳球，""幸運的話"" 敵人會剛好撞到機關[/h1]
７。有時關卡會因為鑰匙沒有，而無法到下一個場景，可以使用導覽地圖，先去其他地方探索
８。跳躍的時間點很重要！
[h1]９。若卡在同一關卡，關卡又剛好有劇情對話，可以按ＳＴＡＲＴ略過[/h1]
[h1]１０。場景中有許多紅色能量柱，一定要去點。因為連結下一個區域的門，都要開啟指定數量的能量柱才能通過。所以若門無法開！表示有遺漏的地方沒有打通，可開啟導覽地圖，在各個傳送點多繞繞[/h1]

- Ótima jogabilidade.
- A história é um pouco confusa, mas bem envolvente (pra mim pelo menos):
[spoiler]É uma história pós-apocaliptica onde máquinas conhecidas como Ajeets estão destruindo e escravizando a raça humana. Por possuir uma história com base em ""Time Travel""(que você só descobre que é baseado em Time Travel la pro meio do jogo), ela é bem confusa e não faz muito sentido. Como a personagem principal pode lembrar das coisas que aconteceram no futuro, quando uma outra personagem volta pro passado?[/spoiler]
- Os puzzles são interessantes, as mecânicas do jogo também. Conforme você faz progresso no jogo, você libera diferentes habilidades que utilizam os detritos que você consegue controlar, e você os utiliza para resolver os quebra-cabeças do jogo, e até mesmo a enfrentar alguns inimigos.
- O jogo não é muito difícil.
- Os upgrades do jogo são pouco diversificados, a maioria são upgrades para aumentar sua energia e a regeneração de energia.
- As personagens são pouco desenvolvidas, mas para a história do jogo, faz sentido não existir um aprofundamento das personagens.
- A trilha sonora é gostosinha. Da pra ficar ouvindo por horas tranquilo.

Existem algumas poucas coisinhas que me deixam incomodado no jogo. Coisa boba. Por exemplo, o sprite das personagens (Sprite = Imagem que representa a personagem), quando você vira de um lado pro outro, é só uma imagem ""flipada"", invertida. Ou seja, o braço direito de uma personagem, por exemplo, quando ela vira para o outro lado, vira o braço esquerdo dela. Como já disse, é algo bobo, mas me imcomoda.

Não é perfeito, mas vale a pena jogar. Daria uns 8, ou 8.5 de 10 se fosse pra ""classificar"" com nota. Mas nota é só um número. É sempre bom jogar o jogo pra saber se você realmente vai gostar ou não. Ninguém melhor pra dizer se um jogo vale a pena jogar do que você mesmo.",1499322122,1499407870,True,1,0,0.502712488174438477,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game gives off a lack of polish due to it starting very fast, the tutorial area is rather short and you are being thrown into action rather quickly. This ""lack of polish"", however, is later barely noticable.


Giga Wrecker starts of rather easy, but later changes to a somewhat moderate challenge, never have I felt that something was impossible or just too hard.

虽说是横版游戏，但是没有特别变态的平台跳跃障碍，基本上没有特别靠反应的地方，大部分地方只要解谜的顺序和策略合理就能轻松应对。

游戏动作要素较少，主要体现在boss战上，5个boss各有特色，打起来也很有意思。同时除了最终boss以外其余boss血量都较少，也变相降低了一些难度。

有中文！

全成就较为简单，适合成就党。

比起上述的优点，个人感觉剧情稍微有点不足，n次的时空倒流有点用滥了的感觉。（虽说这类游戏剧情只是点缀）

The game's art style is really fantastic, to say the least.  A nice, 'chunky' visual aesthetic.  The open-ended approach to puzzle platforming is refreshing, and very well thought-out.  Honestly, taken from a step back, the game is refreshing to play, and I wish there was more creativity like Giga Wrecker's in modern gaming mechanics.

To quickly summarize what the game lacks.. It feels very quickly pushed out.  The physics of movement feels a little lacking; sometimes you fall through what appear to be solid surfaces.  Sometimes, in the vein of classic side-scrolling action platformers, you take one hit, which causes you to bounce into a second enemy or stage hazard (most notably and egregiously in the Astra fights).  And sometimes, the physics engine just straight-up disagrees with you.  All three of the above will generally result in death, especially in the latter half of the game, with the oft usage of spikes and pitfalls. 
Because of the relatively quick loading times, it's not as much of an issue as it could be, but because of the nature of some rooms, you're forced to repeat several sections before you can get back to the segment that caused your death.. only to die to it again because of one of the above, or when you accidentally push the reset button for a fraction of a second.

The music's lacking, and the localization's even moreso.  It's exciting to see Game Freak's name on something considering how much of a mainstay it is regarding my childhood memories regarding the pokemon franchise, so that's what caused me to gravitate towards the game, and, I think, in a lot of cases, it's the same for most of the people who ended up picking Giga Wrecker up.  But genuinely, someone really need to go through these sorts of games with a fine comb before they get pushed out.  I was expecting more, especially after grasping just how intuitive and clever the game's core mechanics are.  Please, make more games like this, but treat them with kid gloves next time, okay?  This sort of result is just not acceptable.

Сюжет тоже в итоге оказался вполне интересным и увлекающим, что не может не радовать.
Развитие в игре происходит постепенно, что есть логично, и развитие это идет в самом подходящем темпе, как я считаю.
Тут и система прокачки есть, что тоже очень приятно глазам.
Так вот, дизайн у игры и музыка мне понравились больше всего, честно. Саундтрек приятен как в простых локациях, так и в битвах с боссами особенно, которые, кстати, тоже вполне интересно сделаны. Про дизайн же я сказал в самом начале...
Сам по себе геймплей заключается в решении пазлов в перемешку с избиением роботов, что, по моему мнению, не оставляет игру казуальной. Переодически, я даже страдал в некоторых моментах и вырубал игру нафиг(не рекомендую так делать, лучше сначала сохраниться перед выходом с:). Боссфайты тоже показались мне интересными, не слишком простыми и не слишком сложными(кстати в игре даже присутствуют некоторые элементы парирования).

В итоге:
Плюсы:
+Миленькая озвучка главной героини и боссов на японском языке(серьезно, они мило орут)
+Хороший саундтрек
+Прекрасный дизайн
+Интересный геймплей, построенный на физике
+Челлендж
+Интересный сюжет
+Всякие плюхи типа достижений и карточек
+Редактор уровней(+ стим воркшоп)
Минусы:

I didn't even look at the gameplay as I wanted to be surprised and I definitely was not expecting one of the best puzzle platformers i've played in some time.

The main gimmick to this game is finding debris and combining it into a large ball of debris that you carry around. You can use this to extend your attack range, make platforms and more as you get new upgrades. Each area you visit has its own mechanics for puzzles, like making your debris balls bouncy or poison gas that lifts platforms as well as a new power in each area to use which makes them all stand out. There is also a skill tree in this game which I feel can increase the replayability, as I went through the whole game without knowing about a skill that can make more platforms.

The best part in this game are the physics and how you use your abilites to affect them. There is a lot of satisfaction when you solve puzzles in this game and it's a lot of fun to see the blocks fall in the exact places you need them to. There are also multiple ways to solve certain puzzles, and in a lot of places I felt like I was breaking the game. The combat is pretty simple, but I don't think this was the focus of the game, and a lot of the time combat is about finding enough debris in the level to attack them. The boss fights are pretty great as they still use the main mechanic of the game, and learning the patterns of the boss is fun and satisfying.

The graphics are unique and look nice. The sprites themselves are very detailed, and the art used in story sequences look lovely. The story is pretty interesting but it is one of the weaker elements of the game because of the bad translation. You can understand what is being said most of the time, but a lot of it sounds strange. Finally, the music is excellent - in the main areas it's nice and relaxing for puzzle solving. It gets a bit more intense during the boss fights.

This review is kind of a mess but I hope it gets more people interested in this game, as I feel like it's a bit underrated right now. A few final notes are that my computer is not that great so the game's performance was slow at times, but the game was good enough that I kept with it. I'm also planning on getting more playtime out of it through the game's custom levels made by other people.",1496502898,1496502898,True,109,0,0.889896512031555176,2,True,False,False,False,,,

　瓦礫と聞くと「おめぇもボスになったんだろぉ、この瓦礫の山でよぉ」という台詞が脳内再生されます。そんな瓦礫を左腕の義手で収束し、加工や投擲をしつつ進んでいく2Dパズルアクション。最大の特徴は物理演算を利用していること。瞬時の反射を求められる場面もあるにはありますが、アクションと言いつつも物理演算を利用したパズル要素が占める割合の方が大きいです。各部屋ごとにパズルを解かないと先に進めないため、どんどん前に進んでいけるタイプとは異なります。

　パズルは力押しでもいける反面、ブロックと装置を接触させる隙間に瓦礫の破片が入り込んで反応しないとか、ブロックを切り倒したり設置するのに微妙な立ち位置の調整が必要など、物理演算の気まぐれによるやり直しが結構あります。但し、リトライはとても高速でストレスフリーです。物理演算を利用すると某Skateみたいに凄い速度で画面外に跳ねたり、キャラクターがルフィやダルシムみたいに伸びることが往々にしてありますが、その辺はうまく抑え込まれているのか一度も見ることはありませんでした。

　ボス戦は攻撃パターンを覚え対応していくアクションそのものでトライ＆エラーを要するため、やり応えを感じることができました。アクションが苦手な方だとパターン構築が結構キツイかもしれません。自己修復速度アップの「リペア・アップ」としゃがみ状態で自己修復速度を促進させる「ダッキング・リペア」の組み合わせは、ラスボス戦ですら攻撃の合間を縫ってしゃがみ続けると体力満タン状態を維持できる強スキルです。アクションで進行に詰まる方は優先的に取得すると良いかもしれません。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=932574066

　左腕の義手は瓦礫を塊として集め投擲する以外にも、進行に応じて4つの能力を持ちます。ロック、ジャベリン、ドリル、ブレードの解禁に応じて移動できる範囲は広がりますが、習得後にその都度あちこちのエリアを飛び回らなければならないほど探索が面倒ではない点は好印象でした。ウロウロしていると大体今移動できる範囲はここまでだなということが感じ取れるようになっています。

　キャラクターデザインは初見だと個人的にかなり癖があるなぁと思っていましたが、憎しみの怨嗟に囚われた心が少しずつ変わっていくプロットに乗じて、ゲームが終わる頃には結構好きになっていました。音楽も荒廃した世界の静けさとボス戦の一触即発をよく体現しており、センスの良さを感じます。明示はしないが暗に思わせる話の作り方にも好感を覚えました。

　やや残念なのは、実績周りと再配置および初期化周りに不具合が残っている点です。再現性の確認まではしていませんが、エディットステージでの再配置設定がおかしかったり、開始直後に入力を受け付けなくなる進行不能バグなどが残っている模様。あとレベルエディタもどこに何を配置しているのかが直感的ではないなと思いました。


　アクションとパズル両方にそれなりの適性を求められるため、どちらか片方を期待して買うと意図せぬ足止めを食うかもしれませんが、立ち止まって考えていざアクションとなった時は動ける、静と動の切り分けがしっかりできる大人な貴方にはピッタリのゲームです。ゲームをクリアした後は他のプレイヤーが作ったステージを遊んだり、自分でステージを作成してみたりと製品寿命も長めです。物理演算は微妙な調整に難儀しますが、同時に様々な解法を許容します。試行錯誤から生まれる貴方だけの遊び方を模索してみてください。",1496436220,1511716887,True,36,1,0.811104118824005127,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I know there were a few puzzles that I did not solve the intended way.
It's really also beautiful. I want to take every cutscene image set it as my wallpaper.

There were a few issues I had with it though.
-It's pretty short, and while you can get make and get custom levels from the workshop, there are only a few dozen of them, most of which aren't very interesting.
-The collision physics needs some work. It's way too easy to accidentally fall through an object you didn't mean to, right onto some instadeath spikes.
-You get several powerful abilities, but they're mostly just for platforming and puzzle solving. Even though you can buy skills to let you use them in combat, there's never really a reason to do so, especially against the bosses. Speaking of which...
-The difficulty progression is off. The first boss was a huge challenge, and I died a ton of times before I got the hang of it. But I beat the final boss on my first try, and the last few before that went pretty easily as well. I'm sure part of it was that I didn't know what I was doing as well with the first boss, but I think that more of it was that I was just too powerful by the time I got to the final boss. Against the first boss, you have to avoid pretty much every attack if you want to survive. But by the time you get to the last few bosses, you have a lot more health and you'll be able to heal damage as fast as they can deal it without even really trying.
-The story/writing isn't very engaging. Maybe it's better in Japanese, but the translation really isn't very good.
-The art during the levels always seems a bit odd since the player and the enemies are so much more detailed than everything around them.

But despite my complaints, I do think the game was a lot of fun. I might not ever pick it back up, but I don't regret the time I invested into it.",1496038975,1496038975,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It leans heavily on the standard Metroidvania framework, but the puzzles and abilities you acquire really make it feel like something fresh and unique. The art is great, the boss fights are satisfyingly difficult until you figure out their patterns, and the puzzles are often difficult enough to make you feel accomplished when you solve them without being so difficult or abstract that you run screaming for an FAQ. I could go on, but I think you get the point: there's a lot to like here.

Unfortunately, there are also a few things to be aware of going into it that might affect your enjoyment. First, the English translation is a mess. It's never so bad that you can't understand what they're trying to say, but it's obvious that non-native speakers translated it and the dude listed on the credits as ""Translation QA"" didn't actually ""A"" the ""Q,"" which is especially strange given that the game came out in early access initially, so there was plenty of time to have those errors pointed out. If you're like me and grew up in the NES days, when broken English was the standard in video game translations, or if you don't care that much about these things, it's not probably a deal-breaker.

More frustrating was that sometimes--seemingly due to debris being at odd angles--I would land solidly on a platform, but I would just fall through it as if it wasn't something I could stand on or that I'd missed the platform. It didn't come up very often, but most of the times it did, the ""non-platform"" was over spikes or a bottomless pit. Even though it was rare, the somewhat finicky platforms are something to be aware of.

道中はアクション＋パズル。

ボス戦は結構ガチのアクション。
パターンを覚えるまでは、アクションが得意な人でもかなり厳しい戦闘になる。

アクション面はなかなか面白く仕上がっている。パズル要素も十二分に合って結構歯ごたえがあるものも。ただ物理エンジンとあいまって不確定な部分があり「手順どおりに進めば必ず解ける」とは限らず、ステージによってはなかなかモドカシイ部分もある。ストーリー・設定面もゲームの要素と矛盾なく溶け込んでおり面白い。

個人的にはボリュームも価格相応以上にあり、全体的に上手く仕上がったアクションゲームだと思う。

    在不远的未来，世上突然爆发了一种传染性很强的病毒，感染后人的结局就只有在痛苦中死去，这时一个善良的医生（烈景寺丽华）和一个博士（东条）发明了能将人的意识转移到机械身上的办法，这种具有人类的意识的机器人被称为阿基特，然而由于电子大脑会受到身体其他部位的电流影响，阿基特的神智会受冲击变得狂暴，因此和人类怼上了，博士和医生都成了千古罪人，战争陷入胶着。
    为了结束这场战争，阿基特决定回到过去，一方面为了率先统治全人类来改变未来，另一方面是抓住小时候的医生（丽华，女主）并洗脑，让她科技树往战争机器研究上面点；人类军则派了博士的女儿东环回去，为了将女主从阿基特手里救出来，或者说必要的时候杀掉女主来避免阿基特的出现。
------时间线回到游戏上面-----
    东环劫狱救女主，失败被抓走，女主重伤，被一个GAY里GAY气的博士（东条博士的导师）救下来并改造，拥有了对抗阿基特的力量，然后女主为了救被抓走的东环而战斗，在一次次的杀戮轮回后女主终于得知了事件的真相，并击溃了阿基特的首脑结束这场战争

1.语言
对于国区玩家来说，刨除其他因素而言，语言绝对是一个游戏很重要的门槛。而在这点上，GIGA WRECKER提供了流畅的简体中文语言，比起其他没有提供简体中文或者使用不经润色的机翻中文来说，这是个相当良心的服务。
2.游戏性
2D的横版动作游戏，容易上手，各种奇特的能力组成了解谜、战斗、跑酷三合一的游戏类型。而某些解谜点并非仅有唯一解决方法也大大扩充了玩家的思路。本身主线流程中等，但是自带了关卡编辑器可以自行编辑或者去创意工坊下载其他玩家的地图，大大延长了游戏可玩性。
3.剧情
稍稍卖了些关子的剧情，虽然谈不上跌宕起伏，但也却一波三折，真相往往比你想象中的要简单却真实。
4.画面
独特而又色彩分明的动画系，给人眼前一亮的感觉。
5.价格
68元的价格并不算贵，如果加上打折可以说是相当值得入手的一款游戏。
[spoiler]6.教育性[/spoiler]
[spoiler] 先不谈那充满哲学和人性的剧情和主题，打完这个游戏之后我满脑子都是简单的几何学和简单的物理学，相信玩过这个游戏之后一定会对你的理科成绩有所提升。[/spoiler]

- The localization is painful, the words can read but it takes some used to
- Some of the hitboxes/colliders don't react predictably, sometimes registering a ""hit"" with the player for no apparent reason and others missing it entirely 
- The soundtrack is really mellow, which if the combat element didn't feature so prominently would be much more fitting
- The physics component is well done for the most part, although I've already experienced issues where the direction I'm facing influences the speed of certain objects making precise positioning needlessly difficult
- The exposition dump is really condensed and jumps straight into terms and structure unique to the game world rather than slowly introducing you to one element at a time and building it up. It reads likea list of bullet points being read to you by someone offscreen

It feels like an attempt at a mix of Kill La Kill, Megaman and a physics based platformer, and so far it's reasonably successful. However the game mechanics and script don't seem to mesh as cleanly as they should for me.

Just ALT-F4'd.
There's no reason that the camera cannot follow the character and keep a functional distance at all times. After realizing that I had neglected to go to a save point (which considering the open world feel and that this game does not appear to be attempting to be a rogue-like makes NO sense) I died because the camera got up close to the character and didn't show me that there was an enemy directly below me. I dropped down and got juggled to death. There are ""zones"" or areas of the map that will cause the camera to draw closer or farther away from the character, and since the camera isn't locked to the character's horizontal movement this actually becomes nauseating.

You play as a young girl called Reika, who has been transformed into a cyborg and now battles the robots that have successfully defeated mankind. The puzzles consist of box physics, lasers and the ususal spikes and pits. You can destroy or cut parts of the level to solve the puzzles. The action comes from the robots that you encounter in the levels and the bosses you must defeat. Bosses each have their own pattern and stages and take a few tries to learn. The story is told through dialog text during the level and every once in a while there is a still art cut scene.

Graphics and sound are good and I personally quite like the art style. Controls are okay, but can also be remapped if necessary. If you have a different aspect ratio than 16:9 you may get some display artefacts. 1920x1200 has black bars that aren't cleared and show whatever part of the Steam overlay was last drawn over them.

The game offers three save slots and you need to expicitly save at save points dotted around the map. After death the game will however restore you at the last door, teleporter or warp point, so you really never need to reload during play.

I do have a few gripes with the gameplay. The biggest problem is the floaty or slippery platforming. This will get you killed often as Reika will slide off platforms you squarly hit and drop into spikes or into a pit. Wobbly blocks sometimes make this worse. Add to that the knockback and the very short invulnerability after being hit and boss fights quickly turn frustrating. I feel that tighter platforming would have made this game a lot better.

Despite its flaws I do recommend Giga Wrecker. If you can deal with grinding the bosses until you get the pattern (and get better at the game in the process) then you will find a satisfying little platformer that rewards the persistent player.",1493077831,1493077831,True,14,1,0.662009298801422119,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Giga Wrecker is a PC exclusive indie game from GameFreak (you know, the dudes that Nintendo enslaved 20 years ago to do Pokèmon) and god damn is it good.

It's basically a metroid-vania 2D platformer except it's not retro style and has very curious mechanics. To me, it feels like playing a sidescrolling version of Portal since you have to solve puzzles with abilities and such.
The plot is very interesting, sometimes weird and makes you question your motives throughout the game, while you're being carried around by a sweet soundtrack that is very fitting.

The art style is lovely, a bit ""edgy"" but considering the whole mecha theme it fits perfectly. It's a pity some aspects have been forgotten, like mono-dimensional sprites, but those are just minor things that could've made the game a bit more polished.

It's not a hard game, the mechanics are a bit unforgiving tho.
The platforms are a bit wanky when not 100% horizontal, you get easily punished if you abuse your abilities, sometimes when you get hit you lose track of the character because the backgrounds are very colourful, the knockback is outrageous and 90% of the time makes you fall to your death to bottomless pits or spikes and the absurd amount of debris that comes out from broken objects is a double-edged sword. It can help you solve puzzles in a non conventional way or can completely screw you up (fortunately every puzzle has a reset pad). 

In the end you're always happy after completion and you never feel frustrated after completing a sector. And if you haven't completed it 100% you can go back at whatever point to find unlockables or get achievements.

I'm going to get the gush out of the way first.  I am severly biased here, as the game's artist, ASGR (aka Asagiri), is one of my top favorite artists in the world and has been for several years. Its no exaggeration to say his art speaks to me. I was downtroden, as over the last year I thought he had dropped off the face of the earth. Low and behold this past February I learned that he had spent that time working on this game.  And hoh boy was it worth it.  I can say I bought this game full price solely for the beautiful artstyle, nothing else included.

So yes, I am very biased in that case, but I tried to look at everything else with a keen eye.

Game looks fantastic at 1080p, everything is drawn very very crisp and there are no upscaling problems; in fact some textures are so high resolution that you get some downscaling pixelation, especially on the player character's sprite when the camera zooms out a lot.  The artstyle is pretty damn strong, and the game screenshots speak for themselves.  The animation is also very fluid and never breaks that artstyle even with its fluidity.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=858914194

Camera is automatically adjusted to provide the best cinematic and puzzle solving experience.  When a puzzle calls for you needing to see the entire area, the camera pans out to do that.  When the game wants you to focus on a specific aspect of the puzzle when you walk into that area, the game does that.  When the game wants to show you some fantastic bit of background to build ambiance, the game does that too!  Its great in those situations, but annoying in others. Sometimes the camera moves unnaturally and too quickly; the panning and zooming when you walk between areas can cause motion sickness, so be wary if you're sensitive to that stuff.

One interesting and unexpected addon to the game are cosmetics for the abilities you gain throughout the game.  Some look awesome, some are nostalgic, and others are just plain funny.  Its a fun addition to the game and definitely helps build some love for it.


[u]Sound:[/u]
Soundtrack is good, but its really repetitive so it might get on your nerves after a while. Given a lot of puzzles take you some time to complete, it won't take you long to realize how short the music loops are.

Sound effects themselves are spot on and really bring the game to life more than you'd think.  I think its the second strongest feature of the game behind the artstyle and presentation itself.

Voice acting is a nice feature and gives personality to various foes you fight, but you'll notice that they resampled quite a few a few voices on the bosses.


[u]Gameplay:[/u]
The game looks amazing, but take away the art and there really isn't much you haven't seen before.

I used an xbox360 controller when playing this game and for the most part it controls fine. Area doors are annoying though, because the same button to attack up is the same button to open a door.

The gameplay boils down to something kind of like a metroidvania and physics puzzle platformer combined, whereas you gain new abilities as you progress through the game and unlock new puzzles with those abilities. Complete more puzzles to progress, and every once in a while there is a boss fight. Unlike a metroidvania the game has next to no optional backtracking, although there are optional areas and puzzles.  There are some RPG elements thrown in that let you upgrade your existing abilities and add on to their capabilities.  An unusual mix of gameplay elements, but again nothing you haven't seen before.

So yeah, ironically the boss fights in this game are better than the core puzzle gameplay. That's my personal opinion, but I felt much less frustration and had a lot more fun on them rather than the puzzles themselves, I explain below.

The Boss fights are the funnest, best designed parts of this game. The major downside to some is that all the boss fights are entirely scripted rather than reactive, so most of the difficulty revolves around timing and memorizing the patterns.  Also, at first many of the boss earlier fight mechanics are never revealed to you until you die several times, at which point the game will give you a necessary hint.  Later boss fights also never tell you that they randomly borrow from the mechanics learned in other boss fights and other parts of the game, so keep an eye out and react instinctually.

More than often not you'll find yourself fighting the physics of the game rather than elegantly using it to your advantage. A lot of puzzles are very frustrating and there were a handful I felt like I had to ""cheat"" my way through rather than take the intended path (note by cheat I mean complete the puzzle in a way that the developers obviously didn't intend). Another handful of puzzles felt like I only completed them from sheer luck. That hints at some bad puzzle design. You can't stop all the exploits, but when its so unclear how to solve them such that the player resorts to unintentional methods or game exploits to progress, that is a problem.  That said, there were some very fun puzzles as well.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=870228994


[u]Plot / Story / World:[/u]
This is the weakest part of the game.  There are times when you'll feel a twinge for the players as you read their dialogue, but its super super freaking cliche and is on the whole unbelievable, even when you consider it from within its own  ridiculous bubble.  If you have encountered much eastern scifi or post-apocalyptic stuff before ([spoiler]or any time travel[/spoiler]), then you'll see everything coming from a mile off.  The game doesn't try to be anything but simple in nature, but its annoyingly simple and very tropey (and not in a good way).  There is little to no satisfaction (comparably to the other features of the game) in progressing to see the plot unfold, since there is barely any there to sustain the player and what is there is so utterly cliche, predictable, and tropey.

That's not to say the characters aren't interesting; many of the bosses are so cool looking.  All I'm saying is that more than likely most of your love from the characters will come from the character designs and actions taken in battle, rather than the dialogue or plot.

The character you play as has the ability to manipulate debris from enemies she kills and from rock formations she can destroy. The debris you collect is used as your main weapon and it has increased utility the more you collect. 

To begin with the combat in the game is very simplistic yet satisfying. Your attacks can be used to solve puzzles and destroy enemies. While satisfying the game does have a lack of enemy variety as there are only a handful of enemy types with single move sets. This however is not the main aspect of the game as the puzzles are what make up the core parts of the game. The only area where the combat truly excels is the boss fights. The bosses have multiple movesets and attacks which make them alot of fun to face even if you're not to great at platformers.

The puzzles in the game are quite easy to solve but are unique in their nature do to the debris ability the game gives you. Most of your time in game will be solving these puzzles and trying to find the unfortunately limited amount of collectable items. The puzzles can either be fun to solve or become a nightmare do to the sometimes wonky physics engine. You may very well know the solution to a puzzle but executing it properly is finicky sometimes. 

The game has a leveling system which is very 1-dimensional as the upgrades you get for them are uninspired. These upgrades  range from more health to extra weapon damage and range.

Finally, the game's story is nothing special as it is filled with common tropes and bland characters. I'm not going to go into the specifics as to not spoil anything. The story is atleast entertaining as for most of the game there is an element of mystery. The overall story is soft-hearted with some dark elements thrown in. If I could describe the story's appeal in 1 word, it would be ""cute"". The character designs also reflect that description. 

Overall I think Giga Wrecker is a fun casual game that you will enjoy if you like cute characters and satisfying puzzle/platformer gameplay.

Boss designs? Absolutely badass. Wish i took a screenshot of the first one but got too engrossed on trying to figure out her patterns... Come to think of it i also forgot to do it with the second one. If any of you kind peeps could get one for me..? Or is there a gallery somewhere?

Soundtrack? Really catchy and endearing. 10/10 would buy the OST once i get the money to do so.

Other complaints other than ice level level movement? Maybe sometimes the screen zooms out way too much but i guess its for visibility so i can't really call that a valid complaint.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

GIGA WRECKER is a 2D action adventure from [b]Gamefreak[/b] who made the Pokemon games which puts you in the shoes of [b]Reika[/b], a girl who is held prisoner in a world that was suddenly overtook by robots in a similar fashion like a zombie outbreak. The story is told through static cutscenes with dialogues and is very clichéd. Right from the nature of a post apocalyptic world to the way the story progresses slowly, it is a typical anime styled story which might be enjoyed by the fans of the genre.

 Reika finds herself being freed by a strange girl who in turn wants to kill her to save humanity and in the process rips off her arm. Reika is then saved by a professor who proceeds to replace her arm with a mechanical arm which is called the [b]ARCHE[/b] which helps her to collect scraps of metal around her and then mold them into a giant ball to wreck other stuff. There are typos in the English translation and that might take out some immersion from the story. Now, onto the gameplay:

GIGA WRECKER strikes a perfect balance between Puzzle and action and looks cool while doing so. The game features some really neat physics based puzzles that vary in their difficulty. While the puzzles are good, they are not overdone to death and always have a couple of exciting battle scenarios between them to beat the monotonous puzzle solving. You can say the same for the battle parts which are broken by a couple of puzzles between them. That makes you keep invested in the game and it never feels too repetitive in that regard. 

In GIGA WRECKER you have the ability to wreck stuff and mold the remaining scraps to form one giant metal ball which can help you in your future endeavours. This ball can grow to more than over twice your size and it is always fun to hit a robot with a giant metal ball which is made out of the remains of its own brethren. Aside from this, you also get other weapons and a skill tree where you can upgrade various skills of Reika by collecting nano machines which are found in various wreckages through the journey. 

The game is quite heavy on destruction given its title and there are times where you can solve a puzzle by just wrecking random stuff. There is also a neat mechanic in place which lets you rectify your mistakes in case you made some mistake and wrecked something you shouldn’t have. While the destruction is not as organic as say, [b]Broforce[/b], it is still really fun to just wreck through various platforms and kill some robots. 

There are some problems present with the physics based puzzles in the game and the hit detection which sometimes failed to register my hits on the opponent. For more replayability, there is also a Level Editor available which is pretty easy to learn and use. There are minor nitpicks but overall it is quite a fun platformer. 

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

Visually GIGA WRECKER is stunning. The backdrops to the battles are gorgeous and have an almost organic feel to them. The levels, enemies and bosses are all very well detailed and the game is very vibrant in nature. Overall GIGA WRECKER has a solid visual quality. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]

It’s Gamefreak. You should expect something above average at least and the game delivers on those. The game has a relaxed soundtrack throughout most of the levels which helps you keep your head on the puzzles while it increases the tempo up a notch while fighting bosses which is enough to make you keep trying against some really difficult bosses.

[h1]Overall[/h1]

If you like 2D action platformers with puzzle elements mixed in them, you can’t go wrong with GIGA WRECKER. It does not feature a deep story but it has enough to keep you invested and the gameplay is solid and fun to say the least. If you are craving for a solid action puzzle platformer, give GIGA WRECKER a try and you won’t regret it.

The Cons:
Artwork is hit or miss, either you'll like the style or you won't.  The dialogue atleast in English is a bit poorly translated and doesn't come across naturally, could use some work.

Combat is somewhat lacking and lackluster, the enemy designs hold more potential then was actually given to them.  Obvious corner cutting in sprites, for instance left vs right facing is the same sprite flipped.  The writing seems to be the developers greatest weakness and is the main detractor for this title.

The gameplay and challenge themselves are well worth the money, so long as you don't mind the weak aesthetics.  Honestly, if the developer hires a new writing team, this is a sequal worthy title.

The hit detection is far from polished, and a lot of damage i took felt cheap.  I would jump over an enemy clearly above his character model, and i would proceed to hit an invisible hit box taking damage which lead to a frustrating demise.  The puzzles were simple in principle yet executing them is another matter entirely.  all too often i found that the physics objects i needed to remain individual components would form together into one collective mass causing me to have to reset the puzzle.

The art style, music, and story however were appealing to me from what i played.  The implementation of tutorial mechanics within the story text was cumbersome and some what redundant.

虽然感觉  游戏物理引擎方面做的有些简陋  移动啊跳跃啊之类的手感并不是非常好
关卡方面做的不是很严谨  甚至有的会有些BUG   大部分关卡看起来不知道怎么玩但是莽着莽着就过去了
以至于整个游戏通关之后我还有一个图完全不知道怎么解  纯粹是莫名其妙打出BUG过去的
作为一个解密游戏似乎有些问题  但是掩盖不了系统的有趣
固锁刀刃标枪冲钻  一个比一个有趣  各种关卡莫名其妙莽过去也是因为它们
BOSS战集解密和动作一体  非常棒  比道中各种解密有趣多了
难度还是比较适宜  然而因为某个技能点出来之后  我就有些不知道我和对方谁是BOSS了
对  提到技能  别的随便点  我就讲三个全游戏我觉得不得不点的技能
第一个是下蹲稳定固锁  这技能必点  站着放固锁扔出去瞎杰宝跑很难受
第二个是下蹲回血  怎么又是下蹲  这技能各种方面相当实用  平常道中磕磕碰碰掉血要回起来要很久  说实在的作为一个解密游戏等回血花去大半时间我是拒绝的  有了下蹲回血之后速度飞快
然而这不是这技能的核心特点  核心在于配合部分小的回血技能  这玩意甚至能达到下蹲接近半秒回一血的疯狂速度  
其效果就是蹲着看BOSS放技能  十万个技能砸完自己还是满血
第三个就是三连标枪  实用性还不错  算是锦上添花
有些地方的高墙似乎只有用多重标枪才能爬上去（我之所以用似乎是因为不用多重标枪也是可以的具体方法就不告诉你们）
然而更无可代替的部分还是能够头尾相接连续戳标枪  
（然而我基本是打到快完才发现这技能有这作用  也就是说全程我也基本没用到这玩意 具体实用度多少我也不知道）
再就是想聊聊根源能力
嗯根源啊  FZ里时臣要将七个servent献祭给圣杯才达到的那个根源啊
月世界魔术师追求的魔术的终点啊
我拿到第一个根源能力的时候满心欢喜在想这是怎样牛逼哄哄的东西啊
然后你™告诉我这就是个武器皮肤？
（好了好了你的不满我们收到了下一个）
咳咳画风很有趣  说真的很有趣  阿基特是好文明[spoiler]（说起来主角啊黑化女二啊BOSS都挺好看  道中小怪怎么一个个丑得要死）[/spoiler]
最后说剧情的话  [spoiler]时间悖论什么的就让我们一句el psy congroo忽悠过去好了
回溯时间化敌为友没啥问题  问题是主角打完一套军体拳嘴炮都不来一发对面就乖乖从良了是什么鬼
从良就算了还要卖自己老上司  你们这群人说翻脸就翻脸啊  阿基特是坏文明
以及照道中化敌为友的逻辑  最后那大BOSS似乎完全没有跟她对掐的意义吧
有什么好说的  当然是选择原谅她啊
然后我们的女主就一套军体拳劈头盖脸打死了……
玩哪出  还是说我没有打出别的结局吗[/spoiler]

장점은 어찌저찌 머리를 굴리면 꼭 개발자가 정해놓은 답이 아니어도 퍼즐을 풀 수 있다는 거고
단점은 대개 그놈의 물리엔진이 암세포를 암에 걸리게 만들어 준다는 것입니다.


본론으로 들어가자면 기가 레커는 액션보다는 퍼즐이 주가 되는 게임입니다.

넓은 맵에서 새로운 능력을 얻고 퍼즐을 풀어서 진행하면서 숨겨진 아이템도 겸사겸사 모은다는 점에서는 메트로바니아로 봐 줄 수도 있겠군요.
수집요소라 해봤자 일종의 스킨인 설계도나 노가다를 대폭 줄여주는 스킬포인트 정도라 애매하지만.

기가 레커라는 제목값을 하듯이 잔해들을 부숴서 길을 만들거나 적을 처치하며 막히면 그 구간만 다시 되돌려서 계속 시도할 수도 있습니다.
암 걸리는 부분이 없잖아 있긴 그런대로 봐줄만한 난이도입니다.

특히나 퍼즐 시스템을 보스전에 잘 녹여낸 건 정말 높은 평가를 주고 싶습니다.

액션만 잡는답시고 닥치고 공격만 하다보면 어느새 클리어라던가
퍼즐만 잡는답시고 퍼즐 몇 개 풀어주면 보스전 클리어라던가

퍼즐 액션을 표방하는 게임의 보스전은 대개 저 둘 중 하나로 치우치게 마련인데
난이도도 너무 쉽지도 않고 어렵지도 않지만 일단 죽으면서 패턴을 파악하다 보면 깰 수 있다.
그야말로 플랫포머 액션 게임의 꽃 아니겠습니까.

몇 번 죽으면 그제서야 힌트를 주고 그 상태에서 몇 번 더 죽으면 이번엔 기다렸다는 듯이 타박을 주는 걸 보면서 기분이 요상했지만.

약간 엉성해 보이는 모션이라던가 화면의 효과 때문에 지저분해보인다던가 위에 적은 물리엔진 같은 게 마음에 안 들긴 하지만
매력적인 게임임에는 틀림 없습니다.

무엇보다도 개성적인 디자인. 특히 보스들 디자인이 심금을 울리는군요.

一开始感觉无解的boss 只要观察就会变得非常简单 有点像洛克人的boss战在过不去还有提示 
的确是有难度的 但是等级的系统很好的给予像我这个手残很大空间的容错率 过不去的话 建议先刷级
玩到现在已经感觉的通关了 所以我也不建议大家看什么攻略视频 个人感觉这个游戏只有第一次通关的乐趣所在 看了是极大的消耗这个乐趣吧
难度需要你去适应这个游戏 所以前面会很难度 后面在有了等级之后 基本就是靠解密了 我感觉难是难 但是没有难到没有办法玩 通关会有成就感 不过过不去的时候 的确会有点冒火
认为自己手残可以入 不过可能需要刷级 认为自己没有耐心就不要入了 因为还是有点消耗脑力的

Il team giapponese ha creato dal nulla una nuova IP dal grandissimo potenziale (e non priva di storture), un puzzle platform dal design sia estetico sia meccanico quasi ineccepibile che strizza l’occhio nello stesso tempo agli amanti del ragionamento e dei combattimenti impegnativi. Affinché lo si possa gustare appieno, però, serve una pazienza non indifferente. Non si tratta di un prodotto dedicato ai giocatori della domenica o ai deboli di cuore. Giga Wrecker è una vera sfida senza se e senza ma. Se vi piacciono i giochi che si completano da soli vi consigliamo di girare al largo. In caso contrario, fatevi sotto.

我的全破時間：22小時(僅供參考)

遊戲中主角可以操控奈米碎片當成純粹的武器攻擊，也可以將碎片形成劍(blade)、標槍(javelin)、方塊(lock)、鑽頭(drill)，各自有不同的功用。

遊戲中雖然有敵人、BOSS要打，但是大多數的關卡都是在解謎，除了必須利用上述的武器之外，多數機關都需要應用物理、力學原理來破解。死亡或是發現自己把必要的場地道具打爛了也不用擔心XD Giga wrecker可以重複接關。

剛看到遊戲畫面時可能很多人都會被花花綠綠的遊戲色調嚇到，但實際玩過之後我眼睛不怎麼痠，背景顏色也不會影響遊戲體驗，但這種事情見仁見智，想買的人還是自已評估。

Boss戰我個人認為在2D橫向動作遊戲中算簡單的，一個Boss我打半小時大概都能破。

遊戲也提供玩家自己設計、上傳關卡的功能，並可以在遊戲中下載其他人製作的關卡，如果未來形成了強大的玩家社群，這款遊戲的耐玩性可望獲得進一步提升。

遊戲劇情不錯，這邊就不劇透了

總而言之這是一款[解謎大於動作]的2D動作射擊遊戲，跟其他的動作射擊遊戲不太一樣，[回收]是這遊戲的核心玩法，也是用來解謎的關鍵要素，玩家必須把遊戲場景中的[奈米殘骸]回收起來，這些殘骸不僅可以用來打敗更強大的敵人(包括BOSS)，也可以製成方塊來墊腳，當成刀刃來揮砍、化成標槍射向遠處等等。這些殘骸多樣化的功用配合遊戲充滿挑戰(玩到後期根本難到發瘋)的關卡，正是本作的特色。

劇情:我不太敢暴雷，但我敢說劇情相當引人入勝，玩到結局甚至有點小感動。遊戲雖然沒有繁中，但還有簡中，而且翻得相當棒，絲毫沒有機翻嫌疑。

關卡設計:五分靠腦力、四分靠操作、一分靠運氣，正是我對這款遊戲的關卡設計的評價。

畫面:沒什麼好說的，就色彩鮮明的美術風格，不過畫風倒是挺特別的。

BOSS戰:嚴格來說不算太難，由於必須收集殘骸才能對BOSS造成傷害，因此想打敗BOSS，必須先掌握收集殘骸的方法。

音樂:音樂聽起來相當舒服又非常融入遊戲(這邊抱怨一下DLC原聲帶竟然是MP3格式而不是無損格式...)。

缺點:
1.我方和敵方的攻擊判定有點奇怪，明明看起來沒打中卻算打中、看起來打中了卻算沒打中。
2.跳躍判定也是很有問題，有時明明跳上平台了為什麼還會掉下去...
3.不知道是不是我電腦的問題，偶爾會有掉幀的情況，一定程度上影響了遊戲體驗。
4.存檔系統並不是很人性，你只能在固定的場景下進行手動存檔。

還有... 這該說是解謎難度高呢? 還是說[試錯性]相當高呢? 除非你有愛因斯坦的頭腦及神人般的操作，不然很多關卡你都會死個很多次才過得去(包括BOSS戰)，但是不用怕~ 這遊戲可以無限續關，死不用錢的~ 但是千萬千萬別忘了存檔喔!",1486824979,1486962235,True,17,0,0.714751720428466797,4,True,False,False,False,,,

GIGA WRECKER这个游戏不但烧脑，还能治手残，还能在某种程度上逼死强迫症
游戏以未来科幻为题材，但是舞台是在「现在」这个节点[spoiler]时空悖论？那是什么，能吃吗？[/spoiler]，这种故事背景的游戏虽然到处都是，但是管它套路不套路，我就喜欢它的画风和故事背景，更重要的是两个女主角之间的友[strike]百[/strike]谊[strike]合[/strike]真是可[strike]喜[/strike]歌[strike]闻[/strike]可[strike]乐[/strike]泣[strike]见[/strike]了，[spoiler]只可惜没有相爱相杀的情节[/spoiler]
虽说烧脑，但游戏烧脑难度一般，但是操作上就需要点技巧了，专治手残系列。
以下说一下我各种手残下总结的主角麒麟臂【大雾】能使用四种主要能力的小小使用技巧：
A方块、F刀、↑+F标枪、↓+F钻头【S还原、D普攻】
方块：按A变成一个方块
1、站在墙边对着墙按的话能很稳地贴着墙边出现，不会滚动；
2、配合标枪使用能跳上只生成大方块不够高跳上去的地方；
3、当你想微调一个大东西的位置时【例如激光反射时用到的木块或者石块】，可以不停地ASAS地切换，同时配合一点一点地按方向键，能慢慢推动大东西来调整位置和激光反射的角度，而不会像刀/普攻那样切割/损坏物体；
4、能挡子弹，能反射激光，[spoiler]还能变成小饼干和一条方鱼[/spoiler]。

刀：按F出刀 
1、下刀处切口平整，物体的大小不会损失，能对物体有位移效果，但是位移幅度大，不好控制；
2、刀的技能后期有一个冲击波和回血效果，冲击波能无视物体阻挡，而且攻击距离比普攻长，攻击力和你收集的碎块大小一样，十分实用【冲击波不会对物体有效果，但对怪有伤害，刀本身长度的范围内才会对物体有切割的效果】；回血就不说了，虽然打boss时好像没什么卵用，但是平时过图的时候残血用刀来打小怪很快就回满了。

标枪：按↑+F能投出一把枪
1、配合方块使用上跳上更高的地方，先往墙壁插一把枪，然后跳上枪上面，贴着墙生成一个方块，有些地方就能上去了；
2、标枪后期最多能同时生成3把【我建议先升标枪和刀方向的技能】，而且当你收集的碎块最大的时候，生成3把枪后还能生成一个小方块，是徒手上高处时的好方法，省了很多麻烦；
3、枪能插在之前的枪的尾巴上，就象这样：→→→│
4、枪插在木块或者石头上面时能增加插着那边的重量，过跷跷板时很好用：标一枪，跷跷板下来，过去对面之后按S回收，你站着的那边就比较重了；
5、标枪能变相延长物体的长度，能卡住原有物体不够长的位置，同理，如果你跳得不够远，可以试试在对面插把枪再跳过去，有不少图都需要这个技巧的；
6、在空中可以使用。

钻头：按↓+F射出钻头
1、空中可以使用；
2、刷技能点神技能，有些图一钻头过去就1/2满了，在重置点重置一下【后期可以直接按T】，射一发，再重置，再射能快速刷技能点；
3、和标枪一样能当作远程攻击手段，而且这个能力回收碎块很方便，射出去之后立马按S基本上就能无损失地回收，而标枪是一去没回头的，有种榴弹炮的感觉，但你回收的是弹壳，弹头是不用回收的。

另外发现的一些小技巧：
1、碰到尖刺会即死，但是如果尖刺上面有小怪的残骸或者木块的残骸，就不会有事；
2、吊在空中的长条如果你想他摆动幅度变大，可以移动跳A扔个方块去砸它；当你在长条上时，可以左右来回跑动实现摆动幅度增大；如果想幅度变小，就逆着长条摆动方向跑，或者逆着摆动方向按D普攻【普攻减速效果很大，不适合微调】；
3、重置点可以作为当前地图的存档点，在重置点重置时，你打开了开关会一直打开，但是如果你没有在重置点重置过，死了会回到门口，你开过的所有开关都会变成你刚刚进门时的状态【有些图很恶心，千辛万苦开完机关，一个不小心死了又要重来一次】;
4、游戏初期有些地方有塌方挡路去不了，后期请记住有一个功能：按T重置地图【别找了，核心装置全在塌方后面的图里】；
5、boss出招很单调，就4-5种，但是有二段变化，在原来的基础上数量增多+额外攻击，但是出招的形式基本没变，摸清楚之后只要研究对应的走位的攻击时机就好了，但是手残就没办法了23333[spoiler]虽然脑子里喊着这样做不行，但是身体很老实地走过去吃招了啊，我能有什么办法，我也很绝望啊，我手不受我控制啊！[/spoiler]

剧情方面我就不剧透了，还不错，总之，[spoiler]心疼反派，百合大法好！[/spoiler]

游戏在晨光中Fin，我在晨光中Fin了游戏【NOOOO我的肝撑住啊！】


今天把成就也做齐了~成就挺好刷的，就是找武器皮肤时花的时间比较长，[spoiler]现在地图上都有标注了，但是这里不能发图啊2333[/spoiler]
基本上在矿山就能做齐，有点特殊的是10米砸怪、20米射怪和同时打死8只这三个成就地点有点难找。

1、10米砸怪在矿山，有个地方【好像就是矿山最长的有传送点的那个地方】是要按s飞上去然后一发上勾拳把一个铁块打飞瞬间秒杀3只小怪的地方。那里飞上去之后先不要对铁块上勾拳，绕后把他们三只怪推下去，然后找些碎块按A往下砸就行了。
2、20米射怪在矿山也能做，只要你走到在屏幕里看不见那只怪的位置，一发标枪过去就ok了。
3、同时打死8只怪在一开始橙色区域那里，有个传送点的地点往右下走，你会发现一路上刚好有8只
能用一个小碎块就能秒掉的怪，把他们引到下面的凹槽里，然后继续往右走会有一块小碎块，回收起来之后回去，找好位置一发入八魂w。",1486772939,1486816140,True,39,6,0.790992140769958496,7,True,False,False,False,,,

      优点：
      1. 画风锐利，和故事背景比较契合，但还是保留了萌的感觉。
      2. 关卡设计有潜力。
      3. 原声还可以。 
      4. 杂兵设计和关卡紧密结合，处理起来比较动脑。
      缺点：
      1. BOSS战缺乏变化，只有一种流水线式的打法，极其无聊，同时有许多极其不合理，反常识的设计（第一个高举大刀的BOSS要从头上跳过去；第二个BOSS要直接攻击本体才能取消她的其中一项攻击，即便游戏在第一个BOSS战里让你感觉攻击BOSS本体是没有意义的）。游戏同时也不给你任何研究BOSS打法的机会，大多数玩家可能要连死三次然后才会由游戏借博士之口告诉你打法——而这个过程你每死几次就会重复。
      放简单点讲，就是这个游戏的BOSS战把你当白痴耍。
     2. 故事的节奏很有问题。有许多部分根本没有将感情传递给玩家，而主线剧情本身则明显的不能再明显。
     3. 教学关之外的关卡设计不够直观。

     总之，不是我会推荐给朋友的游戏就是了。

     今天再玩了一会儿。从研究所开始变得有意思了起来，像激光相关的谜题就做的都很不错，很可惜这关新获得的能力标枪没有什么展示的机会就是了。
      
      研究所的BOSS和之前的挑战感觉天差地别，具体地来讲就是多了不少操作空间，像第一与第二个BOSS那样的反常识设计也基本没有了。打到目前为止感受最好的BOSS。
      
      剧情上还是向着预想的方向前进。拥有回到过去能力的女主角一方面消灭了阿基特，另一方面有保持了自己操纵纳米机械的能力……她不会就是阿基特的创造者吧？
       
      阿基特武器说明做的不错，比较好的侧面描写了各个BOSS的性格。可惜第一个BOSS依然是游戏体验给人感觉最差的……

      应该说总算是感觉比较来劲了。现在至少是有能去结束这个游戏的理由了吧？

《Giga Wrecker》的流程大概可以分为道中的解谜和boss战两部分。我会从这两个方面分别谈谈我自己的看法。接下来的内容可能涉及剧透，请自行斟酌。

解谜：设计精巧。想出最优解需要花一番功夫，但有些时候用野路子解决别有风味。解谜元素多样，各色技能的功用也并不局限于条条框框内（比如标枪不仅能够垫脚，有时候还能用来调节配重）。唯一的缺点大概是物理引擎比较奇怪，在弹力凝胶和石块互动的时候尤其魔性。此外主角竟然无法推动地图中的物体，只能一下一下地用箱子砸...

战斗：道中的战斗其实带有很大的解谜成分，故接下来只谈boss战。
几个boss画风不错，打起来也紧张刺激。我（普通手残玩家）击破每个boss平均花了半个小时左右，难度应该算是刚刚好，能获得不少成就感，又不至于虐到你退坑。

一些缺点：boss的攻击方式以循环为主，随机出招的boss只有两个。如果把毗娜达做成随机招式的话，似乎可以让这场boss战的精彩程度再上一个台阶？
最终boss相当不用心，无论是bgm还是攻击方式...
建议删除蹲下回血，或者至少在boss战中让这个技能无效。在boss输出的间隙抱头蹲防会让这个游戏简单十倍。
后期的剧情和boss战有赶工痕迹。第二次出场的boss们甚至没有p2...

以上碎碎念并不代表游戏的素质不佳，只是对它感到有些遗憾。在平台游戏式微的现在，《Giga Wrecker》依然是一款不错的作品。考虑到制作时（在任天堂压榨下）可能并不充裕的成本和时间，游戏本身已经足够给我惊喜，也能对得起这个中规中矩的价格。

很不错的平台动作解谜游戏。谜题很精巧，难度适中。一些地方对操作有要求，不过总的来说还不算反人类。p.s. 因为物理引擎的缘故很多谜题解法不唯一，有时也要靠点运气。

收集要素没什么难度，基本上该拿的东西都在路边不大会错过。可收集道具只有武器模型有点不爽，游戏内妹子自己都吐槽了，你哪怕弄几套衣服呢。

画风可爱。主角和boss都很戳萌点。动作语音好顶赞。毗娜达姐姐我爱你。

故事背景有点像IJI。不过要是跟IJI比的话这个游戏的剧情就没什么亮点了，不过反正妹子萌就行。

BOSS战很精彩，就是有点少。[spoiler]而且几个BOSS重复利用有凑数之嫌。所有BOSS里我感觉最难的是毗娜达（不论哪条时间线），可剧情反而是最先打她。其它BOSS难度远不如她。[/spoiler]

下蹲回血是个非常非常糟糕的设计。[spoiler]下蹲并不会妨碍你的行动，因此boss战时你可以时刻保持高速回血状态，使得很多boss战（例如最终boss）变得极其简单。[/spoiler]

11日补充：

又打了一遍，感觉这游戏思路有点问题。解谜、战斗和角色成长这三者的关系没有处理好。

战斗前面说过了。等级上去了后期boss就是平推。所以要是实在卡战斗的话可以找地方刷会儿级……就是很蛋疼。

一般来说，解谜部分应该只挑战玩家的水平，和角色等级没有关系。也就是说，谜题不会因为角色升级而变得更容易。这里就得说一下三连射——极个别地方没它过不去（印象里只有一处，进天空城之前拿图纸的地方），而点出三连后有些谜题可以直接暴力破解，解谜变成了平台。我觉得要么取消三连射，要么一开始就给玩家这个技能比较好。不过好在绝大部分谜题没这个问题。

因此说到升级，除了加血之外，最有用的两个技能就是下蹲回血和三连射（再加一个稳定方块，能省不少事），其它技能都很鸡肋，不为拿成就的话不升也罢。而假如早早点满这两个能力的话……请享受easy模式的游戏吧。",1486650948,1486747069,True,1,0,0.502248883247375488,1,True,False,False,False,,,

坏话：基本感觉不到cv的存在，过分注重解谜，击杀怪物的方式单一，重复性有点高，地图实在是容易迷路，卡关现象严重






写测评的时候玩的时间不是很长，才7个小时左右，如果有偏颇，我会尽量在全成就之后补上。


       游戏的立意非常棒，在剧情上交错的时空，智械（误），以及主人公听起来很复杂其实很简单的攻击方式，在游戏刚开始的时候色彩鲜明的配色一度我担心会不会到了游戏后期让我看不清我在哪，但是后来发现根本不会，虽然有些眼花缭乱，但是给人的仅仅是爽快感。游戏在优化上有些小问题，容易掉帧什么的影响不是很大，基本可以忽略（听说原来对inter6代优化有问题）。游戏在手柄模式下表现非常好，完美的震动设定给人很强的反馈。以上使游戏的硬实力非常强，让人在上手的一瞬间感觉到一种神秘的力量从手柄和键盘中冒出。

       在游戏的解谜要素非常多，基本上没有硬刚这条路，必须要解谜，但是这点并没有让人感觉到枯燥，因为每次解谜所用的方法都不同，除了有几处大同小异之外基本上都很有想法，有些解谜上要花些心思，有些则需要动动手，但是有些既要花心思又要动手的……虽然解谜设置的非常好，但是在重复探索地图的时候，也要重复解谜，这就尴尬了，经常出现一个谜题要不停的进行游玩，这些平时来说觉得无所谓，但是一旦卡关这很有可能就是卸游戏的导火索。

       游戏地图看起来不是很大，其实还是需要很长时间跑一跑的，每一张小地图里面都有相当多的要素，这然游戏充满了乐趣，因为你不知道你什么时候会进入下一张地图，需要必须不停探索，探索好地图的每一个角落。但是这时候会暴露一个游戏本身不小的缺陷，有一些地方因为色彩太花哨而看不到路，这就会使刚开始的玩家经常找不到路。游戏对于玩家进行地图探索也基本没有引导，虽然增加了探索感，但是一旦找错路很有可能就是长时间找不到正确的路，这一点icey做的绝对好（可怜的旁白）

       个人认为游戏的精髓在boss战，每个boss都有不一样的技能，每一个boss都有很多个阶段。boss战真的相当的不容易，可贵的是boss的难度真的刚刚好，让你感觉能过却又不是很简单能过的，不过boss战基本没有解谜要素，这很让人遗憾，但是也可以接受，每个boss都有提示，还算贴心。不过boss战太过突出总有些不是很舒服，因为这样一来探索其他地方就变得不是那么有意思，其他时间的探索就好像仅仅是为了打个boss，这给人一种枯燥感。

      这部游戏需要探索的地方相当的多，但是可探索的要素种类却比较少，相对来说也不是那么有意思，甚至有一些收集要素并没有系统的提示，收集要素无聊就没有很大的动力进行二周目，这对于一个做了这多要素的在制作组来说不是个好信号。游戏的物理引擎似乎也有一些问题，有些细节会出现匪夷所思的事情，这点不用细说，也说不清楚，不过上手一个小时之内应该就能感觉出来。

       相比于同样是2d解谜游戏的《勇敢的心》来说，总体素质有一些差距，从bgm到旁白，从主题到互动，但是不意味着这部游戏不是一个好游戏，明快的画风，爽快的boss战足以让你从心里面被这部游戏圈粉，这部游戏绝对不辱pm开发组的名头。

Лично для меня, она стала воплощением тех эмоций, которые я испытывал в детстве, когда играл в платформеры на денди, не того хардкора, а именно эмоций. Но обо всем по порядку.

Геймплей, собственно, делится на две части - путь до босса (условно головоломки) и сам босс. Могу сказать, что обе эти состовляющие показались мне такими, какими они должны быть, т.е. головоломки недостаточно сложные, чтобы бросить, и недостаточно легкие, чтобы надоесть. Боссы недостаточно сложные, чтоб потеть над ними весь день, и недостаточно легкие, чтоб убить с 1 раза и не заметить. К слову все боссы мне понравились, а еще меня особо впечатлили картинки перед боссами, они интересны в плане стилистики и выглядят довольно эпично :)

Об остальном могу сказать, что звуковое сопрождение красиво, графика приятна, сюжет - типичные манипуляции со временем, но со своими неожиданными решениями и поворотами. Также присутсвует мастерская и редактор уровней, что, в перспективе, может дать много хорошего контента.

Минус я заметил только один - слишком долгое вхождение во весь потенциал игры. Лично я немного подустал от игры, пока шел до 1 босса, но потом мне начали давать новые умения, а головоломки стали более интересными, и эта усталость развеялась.

今天上架Steam新游——《GIGA WRECKER》就是这样一款游戏。游戏故事发生在一个人类与机械对立的架空世界里。机械军团将世界占领，死而复生的少女成为了改造人，同时背负着“你的善良会让世界毁灭”的迷之话语。重生让少女获得了将瓦砾——“结块”进行再构筑并化为武器的能力。在接受了自身的改变后，改造人少女决意对废墟世界进行探索，挖掘世界隐藏的真相。

游戏构建了假想的未来空间，使得高科技词汇在游戏文本中大量出现，只看懂了“纳米”一词的我，第一次在游戏里和主角实现共情。和未来的高科技相对应，游戏的UI设计、场景设计和过场插画充满了科技感。当然，科技感的呈现一部分归功于主角的改造手臂，一部分归功于机械敌人，还有一部分想必是归功于充满废土气氛的场景设计了。

如果你以为这是一款以爽快打击博取观众眼球的横板动作游戏，那么想必会对相对不流畅的打击动作感到失望。但随着游戏内容的展开，你会对2D物理解谜逐渐产生认识，并把自己从疯狂的“刷刷刷”中转换到心如止水的新状态。《GIGA WRECKER》并不以流畅打击获得的爽快感为卖点，相反，它需要你静下心来思考，不仅是对关卡谜题，同时也对每一个出现在眼前的小怪。

2D动作该有的元素《GIGA WRECKER》一样不落，移动、跳跃、攻击应该说是2D动作的标配了。除此之外，有异于技能、大招的设计，在游戏中，攻击墙壁后掉落的瓦砾——在游戏中被称为“结块”的作用举足轻重。由于改造人的身体机能，少女的左手可以吸引周遭的“结块”，并将其转换成武器，这在关卡的解谜上将起到重要作用。首个武器——“固锁”拥有着与木箱一般的机能，既可成为垫脚石，帮助主角跳上更高的平台，亦可成为跷跷板的一部分，压着道路的一头以让另一头的翘高，从而继续前进。

作为一款2D物理解谜的游戏，被打碎的墙壁、石头、甚至“结块”都会严格按照重力的物理规则进行作用。在游戏中，我们最常用的就是墙壁的残垣。比如在下图中，当左右两边都有致命的陷阱，并且在主角并不能跳到对面的平台的情况下，击断墙壁后墙壁将会顺着重力倒下，成为我们通往平台的道路。当然，在尝试的过程中会出现失败的情况，但贴心的开发者已经为我们铺好了“重头再来”的道路，只要踩在紫色的高科技发光点上，同时点上箭头，所有的破坏将会复原。

Game Freak制作的游戏没有收集元素简直不可想象，所以在《GIGA WRECKER》中，武器设计图的收集、技能解锁都会是收集控玩家的游戏目标之一。除此之外，广袤的地图意味着可探索内容的丰富，相信游戏在收集方面并不会让玩家失望。

事实上，Game Freak曾在2015年就在Steam上架了《TEMBO THE BADASS ELEPHANT》，但直至现在，《TEMBO THE BADASS ELEPHANT》在Steam上并没有掀起好评狂潮，仅有的300多评价中，夹杂着不少玩家对游戏的改进意见。

而就目前来看，《GIGA WRECKER》在去年8月以抢先体验形式上架Steam后获得玩家的多数好评。而今日正式发售后，在一个多小时的试玩内我并没有对游戏产生厌烦情绪，游戏将动作和解谜结合得相得益彰，从而让玩家在一款动作游戏中获得别样的体验。另外，游戏故事又是相当吸引人，希望随着游戏内容的推进，关于这个奇异世界的谜题将会一一揭露。",1486526673,1486526673,True,68,4,0.740049064159393311,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Turns out, not only do they make them, they're quite good at it. I had a ton of fun playing this game. The puzzles are just the right mixture of genius and janky, and at least twice I have achieved the holy grail of free-form puzzling: the abused-mechanics solution. I will never forget sticking a spear to a free-hanging block, only to stick another spear onto the spear and build almost a free-swinging gondola to throw myself across a gap. It was stupid and beautiful.

Story works, I did play the initial roughly localized version, so I'll have to revisit to see if cleaning up the narrative improved it or robbed some of the charm.

Besides the puzzles, I have to praise the bosses. I died multiple times on each one, mostly because they are violently agressive. They are perfectly beatable once you know them, but they come at you so fast that it's still a challenge to execute what you know. Very enjoyable.

[i]I bought this game during a sale, but after finishing it I'd recommend it even at full price. Felt like it's time for an ""in-depth"", structured review, so expect a lot of text. Also my apologies for the bad song quote joke.[/i]

[h1]Story[/h1]

GIGA WRECKER follows the path of a cyborg girl whose world has been destroyed and now has the power of reconstructing debris and scraps into various weapons in order to find the reason of it all and push back the robot army invasion. There's still a little bit more to it than just this, but I'd like to keep it spoiler-free. Don't expect anything too deep or fancy, though.

As for me the present level of storytelling is fine enough and I enjoyed following it instead of just skipping everything. It's admittedly very anime-like and therefore contains some tropes (as the protagonist's tsundere vibe) some might consider annoying, but I was perfectly fine with it. Not only because I enjoy anime in general, but also because the gameplay/the whole package is the main focus in the end. The story is delivered mainly in rather short dialogues with artworks sprinkled in sometimes.

[b]Flaw:[/b] In the current game state there are still a lof of spelling errors and sometimes the dialogues feel written rather poorly, although it might add up on the game's charm. However, it's been stated already that those errors should decrease with the final release update.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

GW is a ""2D puzzle-platform action game"" as stated in the description already, you probably got that so far. But how good is it really? Well...

[u]The puzzles[/u] vary in difficulty a lot. You might run into very hard ones right after defeating the first boss and run into quite easy ones in a later stage, but to me that's what kept it running, since some of those puzzles (usually physics focused) can be rather tricky and even frustrating at times. Being able to relax (or wreck) a bit after a tough challenge makes you not give up on the puzzles/the game. Apart from that solving those riddles is highly satisfactory, since you get to witness the progress you're making right away, may it be an additional story part, a lot of EXP or a new weapon skin (which are hilarious btw - ever fought with a swordfish/ice cream combination?).

[b]Flaw:[/b] Although there are different ways to approach a puzzle every now and then, (very) few of them didn't make that much sense to me and I pretty much solved them by chance or luck just by randomly destroying my surroundings. This might be intentional, but made me wonder if I actually found the solution and - if not - what the solution is supposed to be. Also some of the puzzles containing lasers seemed pretty unclear to me since they kept changing directions for apparently no particular reason other than placing a block on top of it which should have just blocked it. I managed to solve them anyways, but still a thing to keep in mind. With those few exceptions the physics system works fine.

[u]The platforming[/u] is pretty decent. Every action takes place immediately and I rarely had any problems controlling the character. I got used to the way it behaves rather easily. Unless the map's design is at fault for making you die by containing a lot of traps, enemies etc, this part of the game is executed smoothly.

[u]The action[/u] focuses on the ARCHE abilities of course. I won't explain them in detail now since they're being presented in the trailer already which gives a quite good overview. You either use those tools to crush everything in your way or in order to explore the maps a bit. The four different weapons (apart from the default debris ball) make these things a fun experience through and through and since it's possible to upgrade them via the skill tree, it's up to you (to a small degree) which weapon's going to be your main tool. Furthermore I never had the feeling of over- or underusing one of them since each puzzle usually asks you to do something slightly different or combine your abilities. (Apart from that you can still just spam your attacks and wreck the map in case things aren't going your way. Way to release stress included!)

[b]Flaw:[/b] Except from a few upgrades or the increasing of your total health the skill tree doesn't feel that game changing in the end. It DOES change things for sure, but since you're improving on your own anyways while the game continues, it became a collectible-like thing for me at some point. Then again it's very easy to farm EXP since you'll never lose those points no matter how often you rewind time to recreate the map (therefore EXP orb blocks, as well). I never farmed them on purpose and ended up with a fully upgraded skill tree and almost 11 points left to spare. Probably the only part of the game that isn't a challenge.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

The background music was another factor for me to keep going, even when being stuck at a certain puzzle or boss. While during the stages the music usually has an ambient and relaxing vibe, boss fight themes are uptempo tracks with melodies and beats that kept me pumped for another try. All of the tracks belong to different kinds of electronic subgenres and also feel a bit anime-like (when it comes to boss fights) at times.
Reading through the other reviews the BGM seems to be some kind of ambivalent aspect and I understand that some might consider the music a tad bit annoying after a while, but I enjoyed it a lot (I'd probably even buy an OST CD, but that's just me).

[i]A reminder: there is no voice acting in this game apart from some voice samples when attacking, jumping, dying and so on.[/i]

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

If you despise pixel/2D art or character art as seen in anime and manga, you won't like the visuals, simply put. I do like both, so no downside for me. However, there isn't too much variety and detail to find here, most likely in order to keep the stages easy on the eyes since there is a lot going on sometimes. Characters and enemies, though, are pretty detailed for such a game in my opinion, which leads to a minor...

[b]Flaw:[/b] When the camera zooms out in a few stages in order to give you an overview of the huge puzzle, the character becomes a little bit blurry due to a black outline that somewhat flickers around while moving. Not to a disturbing degree and you probably won't pay too much attention to it, but still.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

GIGA WRECKER is a game every platform and/or puzzle game fan should try out for sure. In case you're also a fan of anime/manga, you'll be good to go. There are still a handful of (minor) flaws, but nothing gamebreaking in my opinion, not to mention that this game isn't fully released yet (upcoming patch will be the final one to leave Early Access) and the developers still have some room to act. I finished the game within 15 hours with every collectible achieved (achievements weren't active at time of completion) and a fully upgraded skill tree. There is also a level editor which I didn't try out yet and therefore didn't review, but from the looks of it, some additional hours should be worth spending there, too. I'll be definitely coming back to this title, though, and I'm eagerly waiting for more.

+++Pros+++
+Incredibly fun (the most important thing in any game and this game has fun in spades)
+Great Brain teasing physics based Puzzles (using your various abilities to break structures and move them for stage progression. etc...)
+Enjoyable fast paced combat (and not too difficult either)
+Great fun platforming (which goes along with the puzzles and combat)
+Beautiful art, and graphics
+Bizzarely Beautiful Nanomachine infused post apocalyptic setting
+Entertaining characters (and a fun poweful female main character)
+Great music that fits perfectly with the game's atmosphere
+Your weapons are also used as your tools for puzzle solving
+Powerful fun bosses that are all awesome robot girls
+The game doesn't take itself too seriously or not seriously enough with a great mixture of comedy and drama (there's nothing worse than a ""trying too hard"" post apocalyptic game or series that has no or very little comedy in it.)
+There is a level editor with pretty much everything in the game at your disposal so you can make your own stages
+Simple and fun progression system/skill tree
+No ""lives"" system (I pretty much only died to the bosses, but outside of that I think when I died the game simply placed me in the same room close to where I died or at the nearest save point)
+Integration of story and gameplay mechanics (The game explains what the save points function as in the universe of the game, and how the upgrade system works for your character in that world, things like that always a plus for me)

---Negatives (these are all pretty minor to me though)---
-The bosses may be pretty frustrating until you figure out how to correctly fight them
-Some of the puzzles (particularly the later ones in The Mine) can be cryptic and frustrating (most have a simple solution once you figure it out though) I'm also not sure if I solved some of the more cryptic and difficult puzzles correctly, but after getting stuck on some of them for over ten or twenty minutes I was ready to take any solution I could
-Some of the character animations seem a bit weird, I'm not sure how to describe it (like they are stiff or jerky?), but not a big issue, and not that noticeable while playing
-Reika (the main character) has a mirrored character model, her robotic arm is supposed to be on her left side, but when turning left it switches over to her right arm, a very minor issue, but it bugged me a little.

+++Maybe Positive/Maybe Negative---
+-The game is originally in Japanese and has obviously been translated by somebody who speaks english as a second language, some people might find this annoying (since it results in some perhaps unintentional humor), but I think it helps give the game a very unique and entertaining charm, and since it's been done this way you get a more ""pure"" translation in my opinion.

I'd definitely recommend this game to anybody who is even slightly interested in it, at the time of this writing the game is still in alpha but I had a blast with it and a ton of fun.
Also the developers have said the price may go up for the full version, so I'd definitely recommend buying it if you are on the fence.

Pros: Combat simple and fun. Puzzles fun to solve when using the debris and it also makes you think of what you need to do. Story seems interesting and wanting more. Love exploring the area for rewards to level up, Kinda reminds me of Metroid. Art style looks pretty sweet. Background design looks impressive as well. The controls are improved including the jumping as it doesn't slow you down. Cosmestics for the ARCHE Abilities are cool and its optional as well. I like how in each area there was something you to manipulate like this one you had to move gears to functioning gears to unlock the door. 

Cons: Movement seems weird whenever you're moving on top of destroyed debris. Some of the your debris can get stuck in a wall when your try to recall it. There was a time where my character got stuck inside the debris which gave me a struggle to get out. I don't like how the enemie debris that you can't pick up or move can halt your progress sometimes when you're about to solve the puzzle. It's better that you explore areas to get the extra xp, because if you don't, the skills you get from the skill tree can help you more or less depending on the situation. So far

Тут довольно необычный и разнообразный геймплей. Нам надо пройти уровень, убивая врагов и решая головоломки. Где-то можно просто крушить все подряд, но чаще придется подумать, как разбить скалы, чтобы добраться до переключателей. Надо точно рассчитать по какому месту скалы стукнуть, куда она должна упасть. Некоторые головоломки надо будет решать используя способность нашей железной малышки собирать из обломков различное оружие.

Проходя уровни и зарабатывая скилл пойнты мы можем открывать новые способности нашего киборга в дереве скиллов.

В игре неплохая графика, отличная музыка и звук, анимешные персонажи и уникальный геймплей. Есть коллекционные карточки и поддержка геймпада (можно включить вибрацию).
Игра еще в раннем доступе. Ее активно обновляют и развивают. Обещают новых боссов и уровни. Но и сейчас это вполне играбельный продукт.

取り合えず一周したので思うところをつらつらと

アーリィアクセスということで、まだボスが１体とMAPエディターが付いているくらいですが
デザインやゲームスピードは一部除き中々好感触、キャラもかわいいです
SEなども良し。


しかしゲームの性質上仕方ないのかもしれないが、[strike]ジャンプする時だけ著しく動きがもっさりになったり、幅の狭い足場で微調整しようとすると滑って滑落してしまうのはどうにかして欲しいところではあります[/strike]
9/12/2016現在随分ましになりましたが、パズルで足止めとパズルを解くのに動き回る分もっとサクサク動いてもいい
スキルツリーにしても、もっとレスポンスが良くてもいい気はします。一々可否を問う必要はないかと･･･

取り合えず動かしてもらおうと言う期間だからかもしれないが、ボスまでを１ステージとするのであれば
チュートリアル込みにしても１ステージが相当長く感じ、単調さも否めない

”面白いんだけどなんか飽きちゃう”と言うのが今のところの感想でした。

良かった所
・壁をガリガリ削るのが楽しい
・壁をガンガンぶっ壊すのが楽しい
・かといって無闇に何でも壊すと足場が駄目になるのが悩ませ楽しい
・物理演算ゲー特有の強引解を生み出すのも一興
・足場を設置したりする技が色々応用利いて楽しい
・こまめな中間地点と任意に行える再スタートでプレイサクサク
・チュートリアルが丁寧
・『マリオにおけるコイン』的な、経験値等のアイテムによるさりげないルート誘導ないしヒントが光る
・半メカ主人公と、マッドなようなマッドでないような科学者のおっさんのかけあいが楽しい

悪かった所
・ボスが熱いのはいいんだけど殆どパズルゲーの通常ステージから唐突にアクションアクションさせすぎじゃないですかね・・・
・キーボードで操作してるのにチュートリアルがジョイスティックのボタン表記（そのうち修正されるかなぁ）
・どっちが正道でどっちがサブでさらにどこから戻ってきたかとか迷う

総評
ゲームフリークさんの新作ということで期待は高かったのですが、見事に期待に答えてくれる作品だなと思いました。

まず世界観と能力が噛み合っているのが凄く良いです。ストーリーも分かりやすく複雑ではないので、プレイ中に頭の中がこんがらがってゲームに集中出来ないとういうこともなく。だからといって単純すぎて、ただゲームをプレイしているだけで味気ないということもない丁度良い物語性だと思います。
ゲーム自体も簡単な操作でいろいろ出来る上に、壁を破壊しまくれるのがやっていて結構気持ち良いです。
大まかな操作説明が終わり、本格的に探索出来るようにになるとマップが思っていた以上に広大なこともあり中々のやりごたえがあります。
謎解きしつつ先に進むアクションゲームが好きな人にはオススメできるゲームだと思います。

残念というか直して貰いたい部分は、キーコンフィングで変えた設定が一度ゲームを終了して再起動するとデフォルト状態に戻ってしまうことと一度見たボス戦前のデモをスキップ出来ないこと。
あと体力が残り１状態の時にスキルツリーでスキルを取得すると全回復になるのはちょっと優しすぎる気もする。
それとせっかくいろいろと探索出来るゲームなのでナノクリスタルだけでなく、何かしらのアイテムが隠されていたりすると面白いかなと思います。

早期アクセスということで少し不安でしたが自分のプレイした限りでは進行に差し支えるバグもなく快適でした。

戦闘は全体的に温めの印象でしたが、後半はなかなか敵が嫌らしい配置になってきたので、今後のステージ追加で歯ごたえのあるシチュエーションを期待しています

ボス戦は演出が熱いしギミックも面白いのでかなり高評価です、難易度も初見はボコられるけどわかってればノーダメも割と楽にできたりするのでいいバランスだなと

不満点としては
壊したりで斜めに倒れたブロックを足場にする際の判定がちょっとシビアっていうかわかりにくいかなぁと、ギリジャンしたいのに思ったより手前で判定が切れてたりするのが何回かあったので。

あと浮き上がる足場がリコールに反応する距離が少し広すぎるかなと、ブロック集めのついでとかで作動して待ちぼうけを喰らうのが少しストレスかも、我慢できるレベルだしこれを利用した謎解きとかも出てくるかもしれないけど一応。

僕の好み、という贔屓目もあるけど世界観、ゲームデザイン等よく出来ていてとても楽しい。絵も良い。
パズルやアクションの難易度も程よく抑えてあってとっつき易いし、手に入れた能力も満遍なく使うように設計されていて丁寧に作ってあるなあ、という印象。
A地点からB地点に行く為にブロックを壊したり積んだりするのだけど、大雑把にやっても案外何とかなるのが良いなーと。
今後ストーリーやマップも追加されるという事で大変期待しております。

現在の進行度は（マップ踏破率を見る限り）８割程度…だけど忘れない内に気になった点をいくつか。

・他の人も書いてるけど歩き始めの移動速度？が安定していないのか狭いブロックでの立ち回りがちょっと厳しい。初動で駆け足ぎみに動くせいかよく落ちる。カメラが寄ってる時と引いてる時で加速度が同じだからなのかな…という印象（引きの時に落ちやすい）

・破壊したブロック、壊し方や置き方（角度）によって判定が変わるのか乗れたり乗れなかったり、途中で落ちたりする事がある

・花状の敵が打ち出すミサイル、塊を持っている状態で防げる時と防げない？時がある。そう見えているだけでもしかしたら壁にぶつかっているのを勘違いしている？だけかも（元々塊を持ってるだけでは（攻撃しないと）防げない？のかな？）

・エリアマップ、拡縮できる事はマップ画面に表記してあると良かった。初期状態だと構造が把握しづらいなーと思いながら遊んでた。（確か博士も教えてくれない…んだけど性格的に教えてくれないのは自然なのでマップ画面に表記してあると親切かなーって）

・全体マップが欲しい。以前通ったエリアに戻される扉とかあるんだけど、大抵届き難い所にあるので「あ、これ前のエリアに戻ってる」って気づいた時には手遅れになってて今まで通ったエリアをもう一度やり直すハメになる（事がある）。正直元の場所まで戻るの大変だったし、進行上無視していいエリア（大抵経験値がドッサリ手に入る）の位置とかも判らなくなるのでやっぱり全体マップ欲しい

・スキルツリー、これも全体を把握したいので拡縮出来ると良いなあと思ってます

・スキルツリー、どんなパワーアップか確認したい時にいちいち道順を辿る必要があるのが面倒。特に分岐する所でそう思う。上にあるアイコンへは↑キーで、下にあるアイコンへは↓キーで移って欲しい

…という感じです。

パッチによりクラッシュが起こらなくなりました。
デザインやギミックがよくできており、今後にも期待できるおすすめのゲームです。
ー追記ここまでー

8/19現在実装しているストーリー(内容としてはチュートリアル+ボス1体程度)はクリアしました。
自分の環境ではXbox360コントローラーでYボタンを入力するとクラッシュする不具合が発生しています。
しかし、それを踏まえてもゲームとして面白いです。今後に期待できます。

ジャンルとしては物理パズル+アクション+メトロヴァニアでしょうか。
探索して、ときには新たな能力を取得し、行動範囲を広くしていきます。
パズルは巨大で、時には主人公の背丈の10倍ほどの大きさの柱を動かすようなものもあります。
物理パズルなのでちょっと際どい挙動を示すこともありますが、それはそれでこのゲームの味になっています。
パズルのやり直しは簡単に行えます。チュートリアルの説明もかなり親切に感じられます。
ロードも短くてさくさくと進められ、時間制限も無いのに素早く最適解を考えてしまうので、RTAをしたら楽しいゲームに感じました。
スキルツリーを採用しており、青い結晶を積極的に壊していくだけでスキルポイントがどんどんたまるので、結構スキルツリーは埋めやすいです。
ボス戦は少し特殊なため、初見ではただ一方的に虐殺されるだけでしたが、数回倒されるとヒントが出されます。
なので詰んでコントローラーを投げる、なんてことも無いと思われます。

デザインは近未来的で、可愛い女の子が巨大な塊を操ったりパワフルな感じです。
すこし既視感を感じる気がしますが、ユーザーのツボを抑えていると思います。

少なくとも自分の環境では不具合があり、何度も再起動を強いられました。
それでもこのゲームは面白く、個人の考えではありますが、少なくとも今の段階でも期待値を込めて値段相応の価値はあると思います。
国産ゲーでSteamにてEarly accessを行っている数少ないゲームのひとつですが、今後の伸びしろが期待できるいいゲームだと感じました。",1471627855,1471963228,True,8,1,0.58479231595993042,0,True,False,True,False,,,

早期アクセス初日で目立った不具合が出なかったのは素晴らしいです。
製作者陣に感謝ですね。

ですが、一つあげるならばキーボード派は一度オプションでキーバインドを確認しておきましょう。
難しい操作はありませんがゲーム中のメッセージはコントローラでの表示になっているので混乱します。

クリアに掛かる時間は2時間ほどでしたがそれなりにサクサク進めたのでストレスは感じませんでした。
アクションはアクションですが、パズルの比率の方が多いです。
ですが、仕組みは理解できても挙動で悩まされる場面があります。
主にガスと樹脂の挙動がピーキーなので、何度かやり直す事になるかも知れません。
また、移動とジャンプの調節に慣れるのに少し手惑うかもしれません。

基本的にはオススメしていますが、ゲーム自体は今の所ガッツリという状態ではないです。
今はまだシステムを理解するためのチュートリアルが付いている程度の印象です。
しかし、何も無いわけではなく、現状はGIGA WRECKERのシステムでステージを自由につくって遊べる機能があるので、暫くはこちらで遊ぶ事になりそうですね。
勿論ワークショップ対応なのでコミュニティが盛んになれば末永く遊べるゲームになりそうです。

ポテンシャルは十分あると思いますので、開発の煮詰りが無い事を願っています。",1471598918,1471598918,True,36,4,0.741095066070556641,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Gameplay doesn't flow as well as it should and hopefully this will be fixed later on. Animations themselves are quite rough and don't read well when the camera pulls out. Despite the camera pulling in and out appropriatley to match what's happening on screen an adjustable camera view would be preferable. I'm only 40 minutes in as of writing this and will update as I continue playing and updates occur, but I can at least say that even this far in I'm still not out of the tutorial and that everything in the core gameplay is rough and clunky. Sometimes the jump button will result in the player character jumping and it's not eactly uncommon for them to fall through walls and floors either, especially when in mid-air. 

The biggest fault so far has been the game's hook of creating and distorting platforms with the rubble the player obtains. It presents interesting ideas, but the game is very picky about using them for combat and they generally only work half the time. In certain tutorial segments the player is outright restricted from using any attacks or skills that aren't the one it asks them to use, despite levels being designed to allow for other skill usage. Levels are actually designed with reset markers in case the player somehow screws up a puzzle and needs to reset the entire screen. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it helps highlight the faults in design when you have to reset a puzzle multiple times as a result of the physics acting up.

So far there is little difference in visual design, but I'm hoping it changes in the later levels so I won't really count that against it unelss that is the case later on.

Wait for a few updates and see how reviews have changed. I've no doubt the devs will turn this into a fun title by the end of things, but for now I'd advise on waiting before you pick this up.",1471549904,1471550568,False,23,3,0.328379809856414795,0,True,False,True,False,,,
