My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705766711,1705766711,True,1,0,0.448413252830505371,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The ""developer"" filled out a basic template in the craptastic Construct3 construction kit (a blight on gaming), changed the name/reskinned a couple of things, and put it on Steam as if it was their own game.

The resulting ""template flip"", Yet Another World, is yet another of literally thousands of 2D retro platformers infesting Steam and lowering the average quality of all video games everywhere.

There's nothing notable about this crap platformer except that you can play it for free on the self-published area of Construct's website, making this a free browser app.  More on that later, but it's important to really hammer home the point this is a browser app and not a real PC game.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

Resolution is locked and can't be changed, this is as much as a limitation of Construct 3 as it is laziness on the part of the developer.  Regardless, it's not guaranteed it will fit the native resolution of your display. 

The game features somewhat lazy, simplistic 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort Flash/browser games and mobile apps.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Construct 2/Construct 3 game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's worse than GameMaker Studio!).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Once more we see greedy devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $6 USD, but it's free to play on the web.  Web developers must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free browser game just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  Who do they think we are?

平台跳跃，每次死亡原地掉落1个圆环并回到初始位置，每关需要收集3个以上圆环并走到发光圆圈进入下一关。
主角可以吃树上不同种类[strike]可能已经坏了的[/strike]果实进入“排气推进状态”来进行二段跳、使地刺消失、使黑影爆炸等操作。每十关新增一种陷阱，后期难度激增，共120关。

[h1]{优缺}[/h1]
+美工绝赞，颜色舒心
+背景音乐及音效静谧和谐，就算不玩游戏摆在那儿挺感觉很静心
+关卡设计很强，陷阱安放位置仿佛读心，有挑战性
-超没品主角，与游戏画风不符
-关于陷阱的解决方法游戏中没有任何提示，抓瞎摸索很迷茫
-难度较高，考验耐心

推荐改一下键位，将跳跃和推进改成一个键，这样可以随时随地二段跳:D

[u]{感想}[/u]
[h1]云兴霞蔚、百啭千声与煞风景的我[/h1]
+1包得来，被封面的景色吸引，认真玩了下，非常有意思。
扁平化的艺术风格，从主世界背景由黛蓝向嫣红渐变呈现的瑰丽晚霞，只有路过才会长出的枯藤老树，到传送门送去风声呼啸的别有洞天，无一不美。另外赞赏一下bgm，优雅空灵，伴随时不时的鸟声啾啾，带来一些禅意。
自第5关后更多陷阱的加入，游戏难度剧增，游戏的硬核本质得以显现，饶是再好看的界面也怕是留不住这一颗颗受挫的心啦。再次表扬美工和选曲，是它们让我心甘情愿地死了又死。目前游戏时长10小时，玩到65关，进度54.2%，简介所说的15h游戏时长诚不欺我。
但是主角他画风清奇，脆弱的消化系统使他变强，却使玩家认为这是一个有味道的游戏。这个主角的确不值得原谅，如果把游戏界面摆在那儿静置一分钟，主角会原地”摘花”……按“P”也可以达到同样效果，这个双关相当恶趣味了。

A Review by [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/29892929]The Casually Addicted Gamer[/url]

[h1]Story and Gameplay[/h1]
While the protagonist is asleep in the land of happy cows, a dark creature appears, thinks of an evil plan, and points its laser eyes at the cows in order to make them fly to space. Once the protagonist wakes up, all cows are gone.
He then starts his journey to free the kidnapped cows. The goal is to walk, jump around and collect a few hovering circles, in each level. Sometimes you will need to enter teleporters, which will lead you to a parallel dimension and backwards, to collect all of the availible rings.
Making a game with hectic gameplay be level-based, was a good decision, as finishing a level provides the good and regular oportunity to relax and take a break.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Both arrow keys and W/A/S/D can be utilized by default to play the game, but it also teaches that in tutorial levels with nonverbal instructions. They are changeable though, if desired. Another smart idea, since sign language makes a game playable for everyone that makes it through the main menu.

[h1]Atmosphere and Appearance[/h1]
Yet Another World launches in windowed mode, but this can be switched in the settings to fullscreen, to use the full potential of a PC screen.
It comes with slow exotic background music, which is ""enhanced"" by farts whenever you press the jump key...but this does surprisingly not alter the reassuring effect of the music.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you are looking for an agility game, which does a good job as casual timekiller, Yet Another World may be the right one for you. Since the game was made by an independent developer, the unusual price of $3.99 is acceptable, as it is justified by the high quality of this title.",1502490059,1502490579,True,4,0,0.567901253700256348,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Я бы поспорил с тем, что расслабляет. Во-первых: монотонный и повторяющийся бит звука. Во-вторых: перепроходить 1 и тот же уровень, умирая на 6+ лвлах, как-то напрягает. В-третьих: хардкор и расслабление - понятие противоположные друг от друга.
Ставлю оценку игре 4/10.

The game was developed by a single Russian developer which can be found here ( http://energymilk.ru/ ) The story is something that could have been drummed up in a kindergarten. An Alien has taken your assortment of colourful cows while you were sleeping, your job is to now get them back. The art style which is basically just squares placed at different angles, clouds, trees etc. I guess by everything made up of squares shows that everything in this world has a basic outline/concept to it. Delinquently basic, this is also demonstrated by your only super power to get the cows back is to fart. Yes by farting you can retract spikes, make boulders fall early which would have normally have crushed you etc. 

Granted there is a single soundtrack which is relaxing, but soon this begins to play out like a soundtrack you get exposed to when you phone up a customer complaint line and get placed on hold. It soon becomes irritating as well. Everything in this game becomes irritating, like a cactus in your shoe. What is a cactus doing in your shoe? Is a strange question, just like it is when you’re forced to ask yourself 'Why am I playing this game which is causing me severe pain!! ?’

What makes this game such a shoddy form of entertainment? For one thing the learning curve goes from one extreme to the other. The first 5 levels consist of you finding 3 'o' rings these will open up the exit gate for you. After level 5 you’re given the option to simply find 3 or 10 'O' rings depending if you are a completion freak. You can also find one 'secret' per level after level 5 too. With 120 levels on offer here you would think that the game would have a gradual level of difficulty. Nope it goes from level 6 onwards into a Normandy beach massacre of having to try and retry. Evidently this game is not suitable for casual gamers which not only would make up a large percentage of the gaming industry, but also would be the ones most attracted to the art style and level design concept.

You see the platform your standing on becomes 'yet another world' as soon as you enter a portal and what was once the outside world becomes the platform. It's hard to describe but it does make the game interesting at first. Why does it not keep the game interesting? Because those portals soon become a hindrance. Every time you die, the portals spawn back even if you accomplish everything within that portal and now they get in your way from reaching where you want to go. This means you have to play the same parts of the level over and over again regardless to the fact you have already completed it. Also every time you die you drop a ring. This means more often than not that the ring gets dropped at a death trap where you have to try and pick it up again. Or that the ring dropped in an unreachable area like underneath the platform which causes you the need to restart. While it may not be so bad at first, it does become seriously tedious in later levels where you’re required to journey the length of the map to get to an exit portal. Hard core gamers will soon tire of this troll of a game. Yes you heard me right, this game serves for no other purpose than to be a troll. With no mid-way save points, with completed portals constantly reappearing and with rings being dropped constantly at inappropriate places. Any short amount of fun you get will be whisked away from careless design.

I honestly cannot recommend this to Casual gamers, and as for hard core gamers there are better products out there such as 1001 spikes, Airscape and Supermeatboy. These are examples of games that both cater for the Casual as well as the Hard core. A game by energy milk I seriously wanted to enjoy, but in the end the product completely tasted spoilt.

Below is me playing the first 9 levels. Should be enough of an example for you to see if dying a million times because a developer can't be bothered putting in save points is a game for you...

[h1]Comments[/h1]
+[b]Gameplay[/b] revolves around collecting a certain amount of rings that are scattered throughout the level to advance to the next. For you perfectionists out there, each level has lots of rings and some even have hidden secrets. Although there are many rings in the levels, only a few are required to progress to the next. You may decide if you want to find them all, or just the bare minimum to move on.

+[b]Difficulty:[/b] similar to super meat boy, with the same amount of frustration. Falling objects and spikes that pop up out of the ground can be found throughout each level. When you die, you drop some of your rings. There is also a death counter so you know how much you suck at playing ;)

+[b]Graphics[/b] colorful, pleasing to the eye; nice and simple. They may suffer from lack of variety, but are acceptable nonetheless. 

+[b]Content:[/b] An abundant amount of levels, around 15 hours of gameplay to complete all of them. Every few levels, traps change and new ones are introduced. 

+[b]Soundtrack[/b] used as a relaxing stimulant, and helps with the frustration of dying. Ties in with simple and colorful visuals.

-[b]Story:[/b] Lacking depth. Basically, an alien comes and steals your cows, and you have to go on a journey to get them back. Then again, this game is more focused on completing levels (like a usual platformer) than anything else. Don’t buy this game expecting a super deep and interactive story. 

-[b]Controls:[/b] A little too sensitive for my tastes; one wrong move means certain death. When you are required to make very small movements, it become difficult, if not near impossible. The controls are very responsive, especially when using a gamepad.

-[b]Glitches:[/b] A few small bugs that don’t have much of an influence on gameplay. Hoping they can be fixed in the future.

[h1]Final overview[/h1]
Frustrating platformer that will test your patience. Has very colorful graphics, a relaxing soundtrack, and many hours of content. However, it suffers from overly responsive controls, a few glitches, and a shallow story.  For the price, it is a great alternative to more expensive platformers. Overall a great little game to pick up and play for fun. Would like it if they fixed some of the things I mentioned and maybe added Achievements and trading cards. Level editor would also be welcome.

The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, if you are looking for some immersive story-rich experience.  Some alien being has stolen your cows while you were sleeping, and you are on a mission to get them back at all costs.  I guess a lot of platformers can be kind of vague in this regard, with very limited story, so I don't really have much to complain about with this, but it is worth mentioning.  I don't really understand what is going on, but the idea is to collect at least 3 of the 10 ""o rings"" in each level in order to open the portal gate thing to get to the next stage, while avoiding traps, pits, falling objects, creatures, and other obstacles.  I've been working on collecting all 10 rings per level so far, and it is fairly difficult on some levels, partially due to the need to have a responsiveness adjustment for controller or keyboards.  Your lives are unlimited, but you will lose a collected ring from the level you are on with every death you incur.

I really like the graphic style, and the mood and setting.  The art is nicely done, in my opinion, and the Gameplay is pretty responsive, but for me, a bit too sensitive.  Music is light and doesn't overburden the experience.  I also like the small square gates you can enter in the levels that will take you to small subterranian tunnels to usually find an ""o ring"" or something similar.  They're  generally scattered around the levels as you progress.  I also like some of the small in-level objects you can ""eat"" or ""use"" to create other effects with your environment, whether it is cooling yourself to tolerate heat better for a limited time, eating various fruits that grow from the regular green trees that will cause farts when jumping, which I believe can potentially kill things.  I am not certain, but I think I might have killed a fish with one at some point, though I am not entirely sure at this point.  There are also some black root-like structures that will grow when you get near them which give you some explosive powers when you jump that will lower spike traps very temporarily.  I also like that you can find hidden bonus items in many levels that you can use from the menu that will help you temporarily as you progress.  They are limited, to my knowledge, so best used wisely!

While I like the art and style, a little more variety would be nice, as progression seems a bit slow at times, due to the fact that I am collecting every ring in each level, perhaps.  I have noticed water as I've progressed though, which is nice, and a few other things every 10 or 20 levels I move onward.  I've had a difficult time using a controller, since the sensitivity cannot be changed at the time I write this.  This can be a bit frustrating at times.  When I use the keyboard, it is much easier to do smaller movements left and right, but still not as easy as a lot of similar style games.  Some areas can be fairly difficult, where you need the smaller movements, which my controller overcompensates for, as does my keyboard - would be easier to play if I could lower the movement speed or sensitivity with a sort of in-game slider or something.  

I haven't figured out one squirting button I noticed on controller, and I'm not sure what that does, or if it is useful for anything.  As far as bugs, if I hold down the squirting animation, and jump away from it, the stream will stay in the same spot, I noticed.  I also noticed you can hear jump noises, or farting noises if the game is paused, and this also happens if you die and try to jump over and over.  Also, if I exit the game, I have noticed that it will default me to the wrong page, rather than what level I was just on, so I will have to go back a bit to start over, if I completely quit to the selection menu.  Once or twice upon falling off the screen, my ring appeared in places where it would be impossible to retrieve it and still collect all 10 rings in the level, making me have to restart the level entirely.

Overall I do like the game, but there are some things I hope can be worked on with some time as it is developed and improved further.  In particular, I hope there will be a controller sensitivity slider that can be used because I find it moves a little too quickly for me with my controller compared to similar platformer-style games.  The glitches are fairly cosmetic, and have no real effect on gameplay, aside from the missing or unobtainable rings prompting a restart.  I feel it is a little bit pricey for what it is at the moment, but for the amount of levels it has, I would say at maybe half the price, it would be a good deal if you were planning on spending a good bit of time playing.  There seems to be at least 140 levels, and from what I have played so far, they have been fairly challenging to collect all 10 rings in each level.  It definitely is not a bad game by any means, and I will probably continue to play more and see what happens as I progress further to beat up this alien and get my cows back!

OVERVIEW

In Yet Another World, you take on the role of an unnamed farmer on his quest to rescue his stolen cows! There is no handholding in this game and you must figure out many of the game's mechanics by yourself. Jump, glide, and dodge your way through various trap-filled levels. In every level there are ""O-Rings"" to collect which power up a teleporter at the level's exit. Collect enough and reach the exit, however, everytime you die you drop your ""O-Rings"" near wherever you died and you must go back to get them again!


═══════════════════════════════════
PROS & CONS

Pros:
Clean, crisp graphics
Easy to pickup
Relaxing soundtrack
Minimalistic tutorial (can be +/- depending on you)

Cons:
Limited trap variety (spikes, falling stones mainly)
Icons used in place of text (- for me), still don't know what ""O-Rings"" are!
═══════════════════════════════════
SUMMARY & FINAL RATING

Fun platformer that provides a challenge at times. Steam achievements/trading cards and other features are on the way to make this game more polished.
