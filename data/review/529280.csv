Yes, it's very short as it's a very short demo/preview, however, what I've experienced in this brief time leads me to believe this could be fantastic if the developers stick at it and the community here supports it. 
I love the intro video - gives you the cinematic feeling of what's to come and in doing so the games feels better for it. I think the graphics are fine and no doubt will get better. The metal clad fellow side kick in the back of the van has fantastic animation - the best I've seen in all VR games as of yet. Yes the zombies look all the same but that will no doubt change - and I love the way they move so fast. Mandarin speech with English text translations but this will be updated at some point I'd imagine. 

Please developers don't be put off by negative comments about the early standard of the game itself and stick at it - you're on to something good here; it has potential!  These are the sort of games that the HTC Vive and Steam VR needs. Good start, stick at it - as the game is a preview think about about releasing a free demo to encourage a loyal following! I'm looking forward to the next updates!

Its also hard to kill them when the other NPC is standing in the way, so I cant see them all that well.

I received a key for the demo release of TEOT, The End of Tomorrow from this thread in the community discussion: http://steamcommunity.com/app/529280

This appears to be a story driven wave shooter but potentially more story/mission based?? It's very hard to tell from this short demo. There is a movie like intro and story trailer but the gameplay that we have is a very small 'wave defense' style area and then climbing a ladder. Hard to tell much from that.

The story seems interesting but it's killed by the localization and the weapon sounds. What I can hear, sounds awkward and the rest is drowned out by the other game sounds. This definitely needs some sound rebalancing. 

Graphically it wasn't too bad though they made some poor decisions with locking your head in place and moving your head for you.

Ultimately I can't say this is worth the download. It's a short and somewhat painful experience. Even if it were free, I don't think I'd give the go ahead on this one. That being said, I'd love to see what they can do to it in a few more months of development.

VR Graphics 6.5/10 (I could play it and not bleed from the eyes but there's a good bit of room for improvement.)
VR Audio 3/10 (Localization issues, awkward VOs and mostly volume balance was not done. Not even attempted...)
VR Gameplay ??/10 (It's hard to say from that short of a demo. Maybe a 6 or a 7 for lack of polish. Less if it ends up being JUST another wave shooter and isn't mind blowing or at least trying something new.)

Locomotion N/A
Looked like we could teleport but not in this demo. We're locked into one spot for the whole thing.


At the end of the day, this does seem interesting and again, I'd love to see it in a few months when it's cleaned up. Right now though, I can't say it would be an acceptable experience if it were free. I know the devs need to eat but they also need to put out a product worth supporting. Right now this isn't it. I think it -could- be in time. The market is prime for some good story driven action. Sadly this one falls short. I do hope they stick with it though and I can flip this review around.",1475279882,1475279882,False,10,0,0.583750486373901367,9,False,True,True,False,,,

But the game is only 1.99$ so why not try it out? Well, have you ever wanted to be in a game commercial? Now you can. This game starts off with a trailer, and also ends with a trailer whether you win or lose. In the middle you have a short game where you fight off zombies from a truck until you’re able to escape. 

[b]The game trailers are over the top and intrusive, and it looks like a lot of time and effort has been put into it. The actual gameplay on the other hand is nothing like the trailers.[/b] 

As the first trailer ends the game starts with a cutscene and the game warns you not to move. This is because your head tracking is somewhat disabled at this point, and moving and looking around simply makes you sick because of it. [b]I think every VR developer should experience this part just to see why you shouldn’t do a “typical” cutscene in a vr game.[/b] 

The graphics are decent by VR standards, but currently there’s only one zombie model and it feel like someone pressed Ctrl+C and made a couple of Ctrl+V and voilà: a zombie horde! You have a great amount of weapons to choose from but none of them feels satisfying. You have to hold down the grip button at all time or you’ll drop the weapons. Weapon aim is done with giant laser sight. And the sound in general is not good. Several times the enemies got stuck in my character and I had to “shoot myself” to kill them. I could go on but let’s just say it feels very unpolished and cheap, even by EA standards. 

My interpolations of the game’s description tells me that this is actually a demo of a game that’s coming sometime in the future. First of all you should not charge anyone for a demo, especially if the demo is spammed with trailers/commercials. Also a demo should encourage the gamer to desire more gameplay and story, rather than more alpha testing..",1475279346,1475279346,False,8,0,0.554986238479614258,2,True,False,True,False,,,
