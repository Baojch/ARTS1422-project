Mars Underground jest oryginalną pixelartową przygodówką point and click. Przyjmujemy rolę chłopca, który idzie pierwszy dzień do nowej szkoły. Matka przypomina nam również na początku dnia byśmy poszli na spotkanie z naszym psychiatrą, dr. Kronusem. Zaczynamy grę w nieznanym mieście, nie znamy w nim nikogo prócz swojej siostry i matki z którymi mieszkamy. 

Wokół nas dzieją się dziwne rzeczy, a najdziwniejszą, przynajmniej na początku jest to, że nasz dzień po zakończeniu rozgrywamy ponownie. Mówiąc w kategorii mechanik jest to gra o znajdowaniu zakończeń. całkiem podobna do House, nieco mniej do Minita i Reventure. Bardzo dużo w niej nie wiemy, ale robimy wszystko by się dowiedzieć. 

Cała gra jest jedną wielką zagadką. Usiłujemy wykonać mniejsze questy (zdobywanie przedmiotów) by osiągnąć zakończenia. Uzyskanie jakiegoś zakończenia podnosi nasze szanse w następnych pętlach czasowych dnia w którym utkwiliśmy. Z tego powodu czytanie solucji do tej gry niszczy naszą zabawę.

W warstwie filozoficznej wydaje się być dziełem dotyczącym tematów egzystencjalnych. Z powodu pierwszego zdania tej recenzji nie mogę jednak tej myśli rozwinąć.

Zalety:
- postacie główne są świetnie scharakteryzowane, zarówno poprzez dialogi jak i poprzez wizualne przedstawienie środowiska w którym żyją
- wiele mniejszych celów jest do osiągnięcia różnymi drogami (nie dotyczy to wszystkich questów, ale jest to miła niespodzianka, bo odmienne sposoby dotarcia do celu dają szanse większej ilości graczy). 
- w miarę naszych metapostępów możemy szybciej zyskiwać  (dzień w którym żyjemy jest zawsze taki sam, jak przenosimy wiedzę o nim do nowego początku tego samego dnia, to potrafimy znaleźć bardziej optymalne sposoby by osiągać niektóre rzeczy. 
- możemy łatwo sterować czasem w trakcie dnia, dzięki temu pętle nie są tak uciążliwe
- gra zawiera wbudowany system podpowiedzi. Zarówno pozafabularny (gdy gra śledzi nasze postępy i ""widzi"" że kręcimy się w kółko (ten system jest opcjonalny)), oraz wbudowany w fabułę, gdzie podpowiedzi są nie wprost. 
- w grze jest dużo świetnych tekstów i humoru (chociaż nie wszystko przypadło mi do gustu)
- za spostrzegawczość, grający jest nagradzany. Niektóre questy mają bardzo subtelne wskazówki a są i takie, które nie mają ich wcale.

Wady
- robienie ciągle tej samej pętli może być nużące, zwłaszcza jeśli staniemy w miejscu
- ponieważ jest tyle niewiadomych i mnóstwo danych wizualnych łatwo zgubić się w próbach rozwikłania czegoś w grze, co żadnego rozwikłania nie wymaga. 
- niektóre mechaniki w grze są eksploatowane do bólu. Mam pewne podejrzenie że jest to zrobione specjalnie z uwagi na filozoficzny podtekst całej gry (takie powiedziałbym pastwienie się nad grającym, które wydaje się być charakterystycznym humorem w tej grze). Przejawia się to tym, że ciągle wykonujemy te same akcje na różnych postaciach by uzyskać postęp w rozgrywce. 

Cechy szczególne (nie mogę nazwać ich wadami albo zaletami):
- wnioski płynące z zakończenia rozgrywki nie są raczej budujące dla grającego

Świetna gra, ale może nie być taka dla wszystkich. Polecam raczej uparciuchom i dociekliwym. Dla pozostałych konieczność wykonywania ciągle tych samych rzeczy może być zbyt frustrująca.",1649262172,1649262172,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Time needed: 5 hours

Yesterday I was in the mood of a point and click game, while browsing my videogame collection I noticed this little indie game. The graphic is rpgmaker-like but the gameplay doesn't involve grinding, leveling up, skills and stuff. It's all about the story, and what's the hook? A boy who lives the same day over and over. Yeah, nothing unique there, but I'm a sucker for those kind of stories so I gave this game a try.
At first, it was just what I wanted, because you unlock more and more story paths while you discover new things and get confident with the world. After a while the mess is higher than expected and it's hard to imagine a ending that manage to explain everything.

Sometimes, reaching a goal is not that easy and you can't find any clues. I was more than happy to peek in a walkthrough for those goals.
When I got to the very end I was hugely disappointed.

In the beginning of the game you're told to do not a thing, I did it and that punished me very, very hard. Meaning I cannot get the true ending, unless I restart the whole game over and follow the simple rule I was thought very clearly. What wasn't clear was that the punishment would have been so hard.

I couldn't find a video of the true ending either, so I'm just left with disappointment.

That being said, the game should be fun enough to be played, if you are hooked by the story, just don't [o]shoot the doctore before your weapon is fully charged[/o].",1630045265,1630045265,True,6,0,0.623171865940093994,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is a game where you have to repeat the same actions over and over again in order to have the items and knowledge to progress further next cycle. Such an idea makes a fun movie like Edge of Tomorrow but that’s partly because the movie skips the parts we have already done and seen for the most part where Mars Undergrounds does not which means it can get on the annoying side very fast. Also while I found many more questions to think of each play through I received little in the way of story progress or answers to any of the questions the game gives me. The movie can also be very rigid in some ways such as if you accidentally pick up feces (how Mars mistakes that for a rock I don’t know) the only way you can get rid of it is by flushing it down the toilet. Why can’t I just throw it away ? Another logic issue is that I retain items like keys or coffee from cycle to cycle but even after getting rid of the feces why don’t I retain the smell everyone originally complains about, I mean I don’t wash the clothes and the game refuses to allow me to bathe. The game seemed to just want excuses to delve off into weird territory without making a cohesive story or reason to keep going. The music is nice and the graphics are alright as far as pixel graphics go. 

	I played Mars Underground on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any spelling mistakes. Alt-Tab didn’t work. On the Steam version achievements didn’t work, which means that issue hasn’t been fixed even though it was initially reported over two years ago. Below I mention that the frame rate dipped to 24 FPS, this was literally a single dip that lasted a second or two. It typically ran at 60 FPS. There is an option to save the game but regardless of where I saved it only ever loaded the beginning of the cycle I was on.

The game manages the difficult task of making gameplay compelling and even addictive without combat or XP or other video game tropes. I also appreciate the many quality-of-life features in the game that they maybe didn't need but are what elevate the gameplay: you get to keep items between cycles, there's a very helpful hint system which helps you along without making it too easy, and when you die the game often lets you restart just before that happens, without making you play it all out again.

The objective(s?) of the game is to solve the mystery of why you are reliving the day.  You gain new inventory items that will allow the world to open up a little more through each time loop.  
 The humor is solid and the underlying story is interesting.  It certainly doesn't hand the story to you on a silver platter, but you reveal clues to the plot in nearly every cycle that you play.
As a big fan of point and click adventures, it was a similar style of gaming without the tediousness of a million options. 

My favorite game features were the reactions that different characters have to things that you are wearing and the ""movies"" that you see in the cinema. They are...terrible, as the protagonist puts it, but I liked the concept of learning tidbits of information this way. (or in the case of ""Bro, Where's my Dude?"" just the ridiculousness of the ""bloopers""). 
The main criticism that I have of this game is that I wish the ending was a little bit more fleshed out. There's a particular location that pops up a few times with your friend Krystal, and I would have liked to delve into that a little more. I also really enjoyed the scenes with the game dev, but just wish I had a little more dialogue.
If there were ever a prequel to this game or a game in the same universe, I would buy it for the story alone.

You relive the same day over and over again, there are many strange ways to break the cycle can you find them all?

You play as Mars trough a single player adventure, where you relive the same day over and over again, You are the only one aware of the situation and strangely enough no one believes you. Explore the town of Phobos, meet all the strange characters, and break the cycle by solving the mysteries and finding the endings

The game is split in parts of the day, Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Night, etc You have to go to school and get back with the bus, so it will be late afternoon before you can get anywhere. It is your goal to ditch you sister, then ditch school, and ditch the entire morning routine eventually. make sure you can spend the entire day solving the puzzles making sure everything happens the way you planned it.

There are talking toilets, Aliens, Cat people, Secret Service Agents, Bullies, Conspiracy freaks, It goes all around the spectrum, Mars himself is also not an example citizen, Slowly you will find out more about your past, and everything will be alright,  Just be sure to take your meds every night.

each ""Cycle"" day that passes you will know more, have unlocked more, which give you more opportunities to end the cycle. Some Endings are pretty hard to figure out, Others are very straight forward, It is quite a challenge to find them all, There is a fortune teller that can tell you about a ending, and you can get tips if you say yes to them before you wake up in the morning, So it is not all guessing work if you are not into that.

I had quite a few laughs throughout the game, I think one of the most funny things where (SPOILER) [spoiler] when I critized the soundtrack, I regretted that a few seconds later when the game just muted all sounds, I went back to maybe apologize and get my sounds back, but I later found out it was muted in the options screen.[/spoiler] Yup that really happened :P

There are some problems with the Linux version, Achievements are not working and Steam Overlay is not working, But I played the game from beginning to end, For the full 200% without any crashes or bugs. The Achievement thing is probably an easy fix, I see more games that have this problem, If anyone has an answer for this, please let me know :)

Overall it is a great game, It is fun to explore the town and figure out how to accomplish certain endings, There is not much replay value but it offers a great experience that I would recommend to play at least once I have to give this game a solid 8

Basically, you wake up one day, go to school, see your psychiatrist, go home and sleep. But then you wake up, and find the same day repeating again… and again… and again. What's more, you'll find that weird things are afoot in your town (aliens, hooded cultists, a government cover-up), which seem to be related.

So your goal as a player is to break the loop. There are quite a number of different ""endings"", most of which come from thoroughly investigating the town and the weird goings-on. Only once you've achieved all of them can you unlock the true ending to the game.

It's fun, and the game will offer you hints (that you can decline to see if you want) if it thinks you seem stuck. The aesthetic and soundtrack are very retro (you'll probably want to turn your volume down a bit, though). The only technical issue I had with it is that no achievements ever unlock if you play in Linux, although I'll also say that the story is somewhat weaker than it first appears ([spoiler]it's never really explained what's actually going on or why, just escalates to a meta-narrative[/spoiler]). I got about four hours out of it, but if you can resist the siren call of hints and explainers you'll probably get more time out of it trying to puzzle all the different endings out.",1563503115,1563503115,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I will do my best!

I first saw Mars Underground at PAX 2018, as a part of the PAX Rising Showcase. This game stood out from the other titles in the showcase, as a 16 bit styled indie title, with the demo station set up with a NES controller.

The main character, controlled by you, is stuck in a time loop. Your first time loop is a regular school day, where you have limited options to alter the course of events. It’s revealed you must seek out anomalies – pathways to subvert the fixed timeline.  Items you pick up, information you discover, and new people you meet, all become valuable tools for altering the events occurring in the time loop to find anomalies.

The game is set in a small town where you travel between home, school, the city centre, and other curious locations like the local park hosting the Loon-R Festival, and the mysterious Moloch Media Headquarters. There are 10 distinct time periods throughout the day. Actions progress time in Mars Underground. Some events, shops, and characters are only available at particular times. As the game is not real-time based, this creates a unique strategy and planning element to the game. I found myself jotting down notes, so I could efficiently plan my future time-loops. Mercifully, the devs allowed us to quickly advance time, if required, by sitting on a nearby bench.

Be prepared to leave your real life adulting worries and grumpy pants behind when you play Mars Underground. I became friends with the strongest woman in town, talked to toilets, danced at the club with a baby in a tuxedo, carried around poop in my pockets, and unravelled the mysteries of Schrödinger’s Cat, on my adventures to find anomalies. If you get stuck, the game offers hints some mornings to suggest what you could do that day. These hints can be switched off if you’d prefer to explore without prompts. There are multiple endings to uncover, which are mostly non-linear. Some endings are completely adventitious, while others require thoughtful planning to execute.

The sound design in Mars Underground was unexpected. I expected 16 bit sounds, which was what was mostly presented early on in the game with industrial and sci-fi themeing. As I visited new areas, uncovered new stories, and as new time periods became available, the nature of the music developed shaping the impact of the game. I particularly enjoyed early mornings where the sound of a string instrument was introduced.

TLDR: With 16 bit styling, Mars Underground brings old-school, fun, and the bizarre to point and click style adventure games.
Score: 8/10

EDIT: Since I got a comment from someone on my personal profile on Steam saying I only left this review because I got the the game for free I'd like to clarify again that I had put some time into the demo for this game which I played through my web browser initially which obviously Steam cannot track.

Days are short and you can start the next cycle anytime you wish, so experimenting was fun and it kept me wanting to play ""just one more day!"" for several hours in a row.

I love the style, the story and the execution and the attention to details. It's been a long time since I enjoyed an ""adventure"" game this much. I would highly recommend it for those who like a graphical adventure game with an atmosphere and some twisty storytelling.

I'm now trying to explore more things in the game and having fun getting some more achievements.
