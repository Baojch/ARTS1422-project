TLDR: Mechanically simple game is surprisingly disappointing Xbox360 pad not detected or working at all. Slow drudging grind then Bactracking to surface.

Only option is to widescreen play area which is nowhere near full screen. The sound felt appropriate for the title, and actually so did the art. Audiovisually this could had been alright. The core gameplay however is insanely repetitive. With it boiling down to tile navigation priority based on a half baked 2D gravity system where you have to avoid getting crushed. Game has the good taste of allowing you to navigate multiple panes at once so that if you feel stuck on a pane rather than trying to brute force things you could just pick up a different puzzle elsewhere. Gaining coins and converting them at the surface and buying things felt incredibly clunky, Slow paced and repetitive. Sooner or later I would zone out and just get crushed. It was not motivating to put in the effort, just for a slow coin grind. If this had a correct PC implementation I might had soldiered on to confirm 100% that there is not a good game underneath the surface but given the circumstances I will simply dipose of it based on what I have experienced.",1499978713,1509702580,False,0,0,0.450019687414169312,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The more shiny rocks you collect, the closer you are to certain death. In the game you play a poor, hopeless, soul who has been banished to the quarries to pay for his debt. In the quarries you will find all sorts of randomly generated treasure to collect and spend. There are also many, many dangers, mostly in the form of falling rocks, and some moving enemies. The basic gist of Scred is that it's a puzzle game. A very easy to lose and frustrating puzzle game. As you go about mining and collecting gems and treasure, the quarries will shift depending on your actions. Move the wrong dirt block and suddenly you have a avalanche on your hands. Breach the wrong path and suddenly enemies are swarming all over you. Oh did I mention you die in one hit?

Now I can hear you saying, ""Wow, it doesn't look that hard. Just got to pay attention.""

You would be correct. However the quarries are sadistic in nature. Rocks block your path and must be navigated or enemies destroyed. Just past that seemingly innocent rock is a mountain of shiny treasure. One that could push your high score or help you win the game. However it hardly is ever innocent. I guess the best thing I could say, is it's easier said then actually done.

Well,  just take a look at one of the quarries. Tell me if that looks easy to navigate.

Yeah, and that is just one quarry. They are randomly generated, multi-layered as well. Sometimes offering even great rewards for going deeper. Now let's pretend after dying 50 times, you get the idea of the game and actually start making a dent into the quarries. (True story on my part.) What does one spend his hard earned cash on? Well the ultimate goal is to leave and win the game. However you can divert some of your cash into buying tech that can give you an advantage. There are lasers, mines, gravity inverters, just to name a few of the items. All of these can be used tactically to turn the tables on quarries.

Suddenly winning the game isn't the main goal anymore. The high-score is your true enemy. Beat the game as fast as possible, with as much loot as possible. This is the staple of the game and what makes it entertaining. You've got to be fast. You've got to be smart. 

From a technical aspect, Quarries of Scred is simply designed but well designed. There are some extra game modes thrown into the mix, ranging from time attack games, to dark mode, where you cannot see anything in the mine and must use flares to light the way. Every day there is a new daily challenge that is shared amongst players to see who can attain the highest score. This must be checked through the website sadly, not through the game. All of these add already to the heap of replay value Scred has. 

The look of Scred is something that may draw you in, if you love retro inspired graphics and minimalistic pixel work. On the other hand, it may turn you off completely from the game. I for one have never been a fan of ASCII artwork, mostly due to personal preference. None of that really matters though because Scred comes with a whole selection of graphical styles and choices. These let you choose what flavor and style you want to play the game in. 

Just as the games visuals are inspired by retro old school games, the music and sound effects are as well. While the music tracks are just fine, there are some sound effects that become grating on the ears as they repeat over and over. Not all the sound effects are bad though. Just expect chiptunes. Any fan of retro games will more then likely be happy with what they hear. If not, blast your own music and mine away.

I haven't met many games that have such a rewarding but harsh nature to them. Scred is incredibly fun and replayable. At the same time though, I raged quit a few times. This was due to my inability and not taking the time to plan out what I was going to do. Completing a quarry or beating the game is a truly satisfying experience. One that is hard to describe after all that frustration. Like I mentioned earlier, the game has oodles of replay value. Albeit it isn't the worlds most groundbreaking, innovating puzzle game, its mechanics work very well. It brings back a retro inspired brutality that games sometimes lack during these times. However the game never cheats you. If you die, it is always your fault. It shows what you did wrong and expects you to do better. Games don't do that these days. Most of the time hand feeding you or giving you a bread crumb trail of what to do next instead.

With a fantastic price, fun gameplay and plenty of mining to be done, bang for your buck is guaranteed with Quarries of Scred.

But seriously

It's a nostalgic little game that you can sit down and play for a few rounds while you're needing to pass the time.  It's challenging without being plain statedly unfair, and it's style is ALMOST painfully accurate to it's retro theme.  If It was a mobile (Vita / 3DS) game i'd give it a solid 9/10 for replayablility and bite-sized randomly generated fun, but when i'm on my computer I always feel like there's a different Roguelike I could be playing, like Cataclysm, DoomRL, or Prospector.

Basically what I'm saying is 8/10, would die of happy if I could play it on my Vita. (Which I know would be asking for much.)

For the price point, the game is worth it either way.  It's frustrating in all the right ways, makes you kick yourself when you do something stupid, and never makes you feel like it's cheated you in any way, while still being pleasantly challenging.",1429804270,1429804270,True,2,3,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I had exactly one issue pop up that was a problem, but the dev very quickly pointed out how to fix it; seems like the helpful sort of developer that actually cares enough to stick around and assist if needed, as opposed to some devs that just drop the game, and vanish into the ether... so that's a plus right there.

But after that, smooth sailing so far, and I was able to get into the meat of the game.

Now the game is labeled as an ""arcade"" style game in the description, but this definitely is heavily focused on the puzzle aspect.  Figuring out just how to manipulate all of those boulders and such in order to get to where you want to go is a huge part of the game.  Most of the time, you can approach this at your own pace, and stop and think if you need to.  You dont need to rush.  And there are some gizmos you can buy that'll allow you to further manipulate the level in order to dig deeper, as sometimes the rocks will be piled up in such a way that you cant get by them by just pushing them or digging.  Learning to use these is an important part of the game, and it surprised me as to just how much they add to it.  Though I havent tried all of them yet.

There are though also some areas that will contain monsters... as you can probably guess, you dont want to touch these.  In those situations, you might have to be ready to move quickly, so you cant ALWAYS proceed at a slow pace.  You can take these guys out by dropping rocks on them, or use the laser gun, or you can try to block them into secluded areas.   Whatever you do, they are definitely a threat, so you need to be careful around them.

Which brings me to the other bit:  The game is PUNISHING.  This is a permadeath game.  You die, that's it, you lose.... no saving and reloading or any of that nonsense.  There IS a way to buy extra lives (called ""drones"" in-game), but they're very expensive, and you dont start out with any of them.  Most of the time, you get crushed by a boulder or something like that, and BAM, that's it, you're gone.  One hit KO!    And you will die.... over and over and over.  It's not uncommon to have a run that lasts like, 30 seconds.  Or to have one where you're deep in there, you've been going at it for an hour, going for the big points/money and then.... BAM, made a mistake, and rocks happened, and.... yeah, that's it.  There IS an ""easy"" mode, which I think does things a bit differently (havent tried it myself) but the game is really designed to be played in the normal way.   It definitely seems targeted towards the sort of player that enjoys things like roguelikes, or games like Spelunky with brutal difficulty, quick deaths, and having to start from the very beginning if you lose.

And what really makes things interesting is that there's a definite ""greed"" aspect to the game.  This one really seems to be designed to be played for a high score... get as much money as you can before finishing (and of course there's a scoreboard to record your best scores, and there are ""daily"" runs to do as well).  ALL THE TIME, the game will be taunting you with shiny things that you definitely want, but that are in dangerous places, or areas that are hard to get to, or that appear downright inaccessible.  And so you'll go after these things (possibly with some equipment in hand), and you'll take the risk because you want the shiny things, and.... BAM!  Oops, you're dead.  But it's very satisfying to successfully get tons of things out of a dangerous area, particularly as you go deeper and deeper into the quarries.  

The screenshots in the store show what looks like just a single room/screen/board/whatever, but there's actually alot of them, and you'll have access to a bunch of them right from the start (by running off to the left or right at the top).  And there'll be passages that can then lead downwards into even more areas, provided you find a way to get there while not being dead.  So there's a ton of places to explore, and it's all randomly generated.


All in all, I'm so far very much enjoying this one.  I'm probably going to be playing this one pretty frequently... it's definitely my sort of game.  It wont be for everyone, as the difficulty will definitely turn some people away... but if you like the sorts of games that I do, if you like a challenge, and so on.... then definitely buy this one.

Many things need to be said for a game which can inspire screams of rage, where mistakes are purely your own, but yet - you'll be drawn right back in next time for another round.

I cannot begin to tell you how great this game is...It is easily in my top 5 games of all time.

Its a simple game but fun and Its extremely replayable. Runs can last from 5 seconds to 2 hours if you want to get really in depth, but if you have some experience with the game I feel most runs go for around 30 minutes to an hour. The game can be very terrifying, I have even jumped from time to time from a death that seemingly came out of no where. One mistep I can assure you will be your last, but making all the right moves and succeeding is one of the most rewarding feelings Ive ever gotten out of a video game.

In closing I cannot reccommend this game enough. The dev is a great great guy with a heart of gold and his game is a tremendous display of art,community, and love of the gaming world.
