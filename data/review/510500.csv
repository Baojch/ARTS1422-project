En tant qu'adepte passionné de FPS, de RTS, je peux vous dire qu'il est rare de trouver des jeux qui osent véritablement fusionner ces genres.

Pourtant, c'est exactement ce que propose Executive Assault 2. Nous voilà plongés dans un RTS spatial classique, où la construction de base, la récolte de ressources et la construction de flotte. Mais ce qui rend ce jeu si unique, c'est la possibilité de prendre le contrôle de chaque unité en FPS pour participer activement aux batailles. 

Imaginez-vous submergé par l'IA ennemie, retranché dans le dernier bâtiment en vue FPS. Les vaisseaux ennemis bombardent votre base pendant que l'infanterie lance l'assaut. Aux côtés de vos gardes du corps (créé dans la caserne et amélioré via l'arbre de recherche) prêts pour un ultime baroud d'honneur ! Ces instants intenses font de chaque partie une expérience mémorable. De plus, l'immersion est renforcée par une bande-son épique et des effets sonores réalistes qui contribuent grandement à l'immersion !

N'oubliez pas de rejoindre le Discord si vous êtes à la recherche de partenaires de jeu en multijoueur.

À ce jour, je n'ai pas encore trouvé d'équivalent offrant une telle richesse de possibilités et d'innovations. Je vous encourage vivement à plonger dans cette aventure !",1710832796,1710832796,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The developer should've just finished the first game, since it was atleast playable, this game isn't.

The first game could be played, and wasn't too bad, though it had issues, was atleast fun with friends, this one is a complete mess, you'd need a lobby of like 40 players before it would even feel like a real game, not to mention the UI would need a complete overhaul, the graphics are fine for what it is, though they seem to be identical to the first game, so im not sure what the point was in a sequel.

- Performance is not all that great; totally playable on current systems, though slightly older laptops struggle quite a bit (in my experience)

Honestly, I could go on for a while about this game. There just isn't anything comparable right now that comes as close to the feeling of a hybrid RTS/FPS as this. The pure scale and the ability of a single soldier on a small asteroid to change the entire match by shooting some enemies and pulling some levers makes the player's actions just so much more impactful than in other games. And being able to join a boarding party of a space station assault yourself as the CEO / Executron will never get old.

 ship weapon for the any of the factions I've played.  With the Science faction, when you try to land one of the link portal thingies for your troops, the probe bounces off into the distance, leaving a trail of your troops just hovering in the air.
Also, there is a massive gap in power between factions.  All of the NPC factions are like annoying insects, to be simply swatted out of the way.  I wish they were more challenging.  You also only get notifications about attacks and such in your home system, so you can be happily doing something in you home system while an enemy faction is happily destroying your stuff in another system.

It is on the other hand a gem of an idea and has enough potential that I will be keeping an eye on it.

Longer form gripes:

Ui polish is the main issue. Not so much that the visuals are bad, but there is an economy of screen space and some menus are needlessly inflated to take up the entire screen. In a game that's REAL TIME strategy can we maybe take that concept to heart when designing the game UI. I don't need the energy screen to be full screen so I can see some silly pipes and uranium waste graphic. Entire screen has like 5 things you can do. It could be minified/collapsible (maybe and expand option to see all the detail) to not interrupt the game play. That idea spread everywhere. Why do I need an entire screen of dead space for the research menu? Etc etc etc. Instead of being part of the game I felt the menus were jarring to the experience rather than part of the immersion.

The FPS is super flighty. When controlling the ground troops that you don't feel grounded but rather flying a set distance from the ground. Weapon play feels clunky and lacks weight. The visuals are fine, but the distance enemies engage with your lil pee shooter fps makes it feel like a sand box demo. A bit of polish here to just make it ""feel"" better and less rail shooteresque. Iron sight engagements with weapons that feel  somehow weak and over powered at the same time.

Ships and game play surrounding them is a strength of the game. Some quality of life improvement would be a welcome improvement. Fleet manager and improved organization would lend itself well to the executive vibe imo. Maybe a screen where you display the ctrl groups. toss some fleet names there and a bit of drag drop ui and i'd be pretty happy.",1708794079,1708794079,False,11,0,0.611877739429473877,0,True,False,False,True,,,

And as advertised, it’s a real time strategy with space simulation.

It can be confusing at first, but thankfully they have tutorials for all the factions/play styles so just go through them and you will know how to get started. 

The really cool feature is that you can take direct control of certain objects like turrets or robots and be right smack in the middle of all the action. Its very fun, but it can be a little slow and clunky after a while. 

The most important here is that you are aware that the whole game is 7 GB, so it should tell you how much new things you can do and discover. But for the right price, I would recommend it.

first negatives

2) how to actually deploy into fights didnt make much sense and wasnt really fun (in the ways i could actually find in my short time)

and finally 

3) and this one is the biggest one.... this game doesnt have controller support (for someone who gets pain while gaming on keyboard and mouse) this was very sad to see. i would love to see this game come to xbox or something like that. i dont think id be able to stop playing this game if it just worked on controller

that said i did try to force it to work using steam input but all of the ui and other things such as flying made it a pain to even attempt as the game is clearly KBnM only

now the possitive

this game genuinely seems dope
it does what it says on the tin and would be my dream game 
watching the fights around you is epic though a little jank 
this game has soo much going for it so i do genuinely recommend it to anyone looking for a game like this

sadly it just wasnt compatible with me and my needs

i do hope with alot of support this game can thrive and maybe ...MAYBE one day i could play this on console

overall this is so many games in one, and it's done perfectly.

Simply put FPS mode needs some work, RTS mode is pretty solid.


But this is a great concept of a game, co-op works pretty well, ship designs and troop designs look amazing. Plays VERY much like star wars empire at war with an fps aspect. The visual effects are amazing. I bought this only for coop and so far it's been wonders of fun. insanely immersive seeing almost all the ships interiors and being able to freely walk around in them, little niche things like that add a lot to the experience. Seriously an underrated gem of a game and concept, hope to see a lot more from this game in the future!

 - Zusätzlich zu der Möglichkeit Einheiten als CEO aus der RTS-Ansicht heraus direkt zu Kontrollieren auch die Möglichkeit als Executron die Rolle einer art Helden-/Eliteeinheit zu übernehmen und das Spiel allgemein als FPS zu spielen.

 - Ein Mehrspieler-Modus für bis zu 20 Spieler (bis zu 4 CEOs und bis zu 16 Executrons).

 - Spezielle Aufgaben, die nicht von regulären Einheiten erfüllt werden können, so dass Executrons mehr tun können als nur mit den NPC Einheiten in die Schlacht zu ziehen.

Controlling minions in this game isn't just a side note; it's central to the experience. It's rewarding to see strategies come to life and to feel directly involved in the action. This game does a great job of making that connection between strategy and action feel seamless and impactful.

Another aspect I really appreciate is the ability to take a step back and watch the battle scenes unfold. The visual elements of the game complement this beautifully, making it not just a game to play, but also one to watch.

Do you ever wish that Star Wars Battlefront 3 came to realization, with the ground and space combat in one game? Or, have you played Silica, only to be disappointed that it is mostly eye candy with hardly enough content and terrible AI?

If you can say yes to any of the questions above, then this game is for you!

Executive Assault 2 is an RTS/FPS hybrid, meaning you can either command units in RTS mode, or directly control units on the ground or in space.

There are 3 factions you can play as:
* Industrial: A faction that specializes in heavy armored units, and giant mining ships to take back large amount of resources. This faction uses ballistic type weaponry.
* Science: A faction that is specialized in using shield technology, and has access to sweet mechs. The economy consists of setting up mining outposts that automatically send cargo ships to and from the HQ to deliver resources.
* Spy: This faction is specialized in using stealth tactics to sabotage enemy operations. The Spy faction uses teleportation technology to teleport resources directly to the HQ, as well as teleporting units to anywhere on the map (don't worry, it is very balanced).

Your team is led by a CEO (player or AI) who controls the RTS aspects. There are also Executrons, players who play the FPS aspect on the ground and in space. There is so much content, and details to this game that it might get overwhelming, don't let this discourage you, as there are tutorials and tips. I've bought this game for several friends, and we've all have a blast. Possibly my favorite thing is playing in FPS mode, and seeing the vast scale of some of these massive ships, plus you can even dock a fighter with them, and pilot them!

Don't know which came first but it's just weird. FPS controls are slow. Piloting ships and operating the turrets isn't very intuitive and often ineffective because the turret will face and fire a random direction from where you're pointing. It's just overall janky.

Saying that... it's a nice time killer with friends if you like to hang out and chat and don't care about super engaging gameplay or challenge. Which is why we should be allowed to edit more than just production speed. We should be allowed to increase or decrease fleet and bot counts.",1700749287,1704767759,False,12,0,0.611048698425292969,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I completely misjudged this game while buying it. For me it looked like some complex space base-building game akin to IXION, maybe something 4X like Sword of the Stars. This game certainly has such vibes, but ultimately isn't that. It's actually more like simple RTS, designed for short skirmishes - akin to Starcraft.

You have your little galaxy, you build your little base, slap 2-3 updates on your units and just go slay your opponents. It's actually pertty simple, and it's not a genre I usually enjoy - stuff like that is best in PvP with freinds, and I have nobody to play with. So if game would explain me clearlly WHAT it is I would just skip it and call it a day... But it didn't, in fact I spent ludicrous amount of time learning how to play. Part of that is on me because of refusing to read game's lengthy manual, but I still see that as poor design choice.

So, initially I became VERY disappointed with amount of content it has. Then I become annoyed with game's clunky interface. Then I become annoyed with uselessness of most of the stuff (and most stuff IS useless while playing against easier AI).

I consider playing it again, with heavily moderated expectations, but until that time this reviev stays with ""thumbs down"".",1700679455,1701802653,False,3,0,0.531499087810516357,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Needs more units that play supportive roles. Repairing ships is kinda meh rn as it is so slow. Ships become obsolete very quickly and the beginning one is practically useless which is a shame. 

A Ship that repairs is needed (needs to be weak) A Ship that carries a single tank (the first options) would be interesting (could actually make this a special for a current ship). A Ship that allows executrons to spawn inside and produce fighters (not drones) into would be great (should be weak). 

There should be more weapons for short (heavy damage) and long range (light damage) (not counting striker or longbow type units as i would consider them max range imo). What we have now is more mid range. This could actually give the starting ships a use as flanking vessels. Ships should be able to have a better turn point the smaller they are. Maybe even make that into a tech. The Smaller ships also would have some sort of cost and build time reduction as a tech option simply because they fall off so heavily or make the higher tier of upgrades increase their HP more then they do now. 

Fighters are meh, only having one weapon blows when you pilot. Not to mention they cost fleet cap. and instead should be limited in a different way like by 5 to 10 per command post or something which could be increased by the tech tree. They also cost alot (without doing much even in large numbers toward the end of the game and just feed XP to a ship )and should be lowered by like 25 or something. More fighter weapon options like more special options. Also the trade posts and docking bat need to have a way point added so the fighters that are built automatically can go to an area. 

The ability to upgrade each building. Health, add/more drones, etc. Interior and exterior defense upgrades, such as some turrets outside the building that a player of CEO can choose. These for the buildings would have it cost extra power constantly unlike the build able defenses now (the ground defenses need to be like the air defenses in they don't use power or attack unless in red alert).  

The FPS aspect needs more options for clones. Like a medic (maybe even revive), repair, grenades. Executrons need to be able to heal/repair passively when out of combat. Maybe even a new tech tree that they themselves buy upgrades they want (would needs a new resource exclusive to them). They can still you the clone upgrades that the CEO chooses in the tech tree, but they dont have to wait for the CEO to get better gear. What also would be cool is allowing exectrons to build some buildings like a bunker, basic turrets, or repair bay for ground invasions. 

More ground vehicle options. A vehicle that builds clones (like 1 every 5-10 seconds) slowly and allows for executrons to spawn off of, a ground vehicle that spawns fighters slowly and allows executrons to get into a fighter or a light vehicle. A fast moving vehicle that allows flanking maneuvers and an artillery piece. Tanks should be able to shoot their secondary weapon when their primary one is on CD. 

But the FPS aspect is lackluster but i dont expect alot from this. Elevation on maps could help with adding light of sight blockers in a simple way. Also a lock on target option to help players in a fighter track their target. As it is easy to lose your target and have no idea where they are unless you are fighting at a base since you have an idea where up is and some times then it is hard. 

But i do like the RTS game so far. A Production complete notification would help players as well, would help me at least. I do also think a player should be able to choose between a small and a large ship factory, A player can only have 2 to 3 large ship factories and 1 to 2 small ship factories.",1700357986,1700357986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The only big thing missing at the moment is a proper tutorial, which is needed for a game like this, but I've heard the developer might be working on one now. You'll have to do trial and error and rely on the tips provided on the RTS mode for now. 

I highly recommend if this type of game is down your alley. Even if there are a few issues and polish needed, which I will discuss futher below, I want to encourage the solo developer to keep making improvements to the game, and also congratulate them on making a good game! The remaining review will be divided into (1) things I would like to see in the future for this game, (2) things I really liked, and (3) things I don't like or need improvement.


[h3]What I like so far:[/h3]

[*][b]The RTS mode.[/b] The RTS itself poses interesting problems between managing your power and building your bases, researching for technology improvements, finding resources needed to expand your empire, and fighting the other factions. All of your ships and soldiers are upgradable and customizable. 

[*][b]FPS battles.[/b] When the battles in FPS are great, they are great. It can be an incredible experience. 

[*][b]Exploring your base in FPS mode.[/b] I've had a lot of fun exploring a vast base in FPS mode with lots of details and things to do. Seeing a populated base filled with soldiers that I've ordered to patrol, and watching gigantic resource haulers unload their materials and take off again have been novel experiences for me. 

[h3]What needs improvement or doesn't work for me:[/h3]

[*][b]Performance.[/b] The performance of the game could be improved at times, particularly in the FPS mode. I've lowered my quality down quite a bit and I still experience lag even when walking through my base. I realize this is something that is a constant challenge, but improving the FPS experience will be an essential part of taking this game into great territory.

[*][b]Length of matches.[/b] So far, matches can be 1.5-2 hours. While this is not necessarily a negative, as there are many players including myself who like longer matches, it would also be nice if there was a mode for shorter matches ranging from 30-60 mins. Especially for starting players, shorter matches allows more repetitions to learn the game. Starting with more resources, making ships move faster, and starting with more technology could all be possible solutions. 

[*][b]Battle of the CEOs?[/b] The only thing that doesn't do very much for me is the concept of CEOs in business suits fighting each other in space. I realize that this is the central concept of the game, but I feel it doesn't add very much and takes me out a little bit of the space battle experience. It might work better if there were more leader ""types"" with different benefits to them, like a general, engineer, etc. instead of just a CEO.

[h3]What I would like to see in the future:[/h3]

[*][b]More FPS abilities and skins for the Executor and CEO.[/b] The Executor should have access to better weapons, shields and fighters from the start of the game. So far, there isn't much of a feeling as an executor that you can really influence battles. For one, having bombs on executor starfighters might help this. Killing the enemy CEO doesn't feel as satisfying as it could. To make CEOs harder to kill, they could have access to more weapons, powerful personal bodyguards located in their room, and perhaps a secret escape hatch they can use as a last resort. Both CEO and executor should have more skins to choose from so you don't have to be some guy in a suit or a robot. Also, having a choice between a CEO, general, or engineer as the leader, all with different benefits, would add an interesting element to gameplay.  

[*][b]Jetpacks.[/b] Nothing much more to be said. As an executor, or as a class of troop, having jetpacks on the battlefield would greatly increase the experience. 

[*][b]More aliens, executor missions and larger landing pads.[/b] The feeling of going into a new ship or abandoned facility and having nothing but your flashlight to see was an unexpected but awesome experience within the game. Adding more content to this aspect of the game would be a great investment for the wonder that a player feels when exploring the maps. This might include more difficult aliens or diplomatic missions with the neutral factions to call for a ceasefire. Also, the landing pads might benefit from being bigger and easier to land on. 

[*][b]Alien factions.[/b] Alien factions with completely different gameplay, technologies, and strategies would be at the top of my list if I had to choose. I feel that adding factions would benefit the replayability immensely.   

[*][b]Better experience as executor for troop landings.[/b] So far troop landings have been a bit of a hassel to coordinate as an executor with an AI CEO. So far I've had problems trying to find where the troop ships spawned, troop ships leaving before they have all been created, and problems with follow and land commands for the troop ships. It is potentially one of the coolest aspects of the game if it works correctly, but so far I've had trouble. 

[*][b]More troop and vehicle types.[/b] With the industrial faction, you can make different troop types, but they aren't distinguishable in RTS or FPS mode. Having the ability to command separately regular troops, rocket launchers, and even snipers would be a great addition. Also, having the ability to form troop groups so you can coordinate an assault would be great. Vehicles that are lighter, faster, and able to counter troops or large vehicles would add an interesting component to battles. 

[*][b]Executor adventure mode.[/b] It would be cool to have a stand alone mode where you play as an executor and explore the maps with missions to find cargo or assassinate people.",1699900676,1700310823,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It is a mixture between an RTS (for the CEO or commander) and a FPS for the Executron (any team member in the CEOs team).

They share some functions, but mainly the CEO will build and command, meanwhile the executron will try everything to kill other CEOs.

The game is now out of EA... and I'm not quite sure what I should think about it...

PRO
 - The game offers three factions with two different playstyles (Spy and Science/Industry)
 - Each faction feels somehow different, which is pretty good
 - The game has a good AI (but the AI is not overwhelming good)
 - There is a level editor to create own star systems (with single defendable systems, for defenders like me)
 - There bugs, but no game breaking bugs, so it is... okay on that side

CONS
 - There are some issues with save games (settings not loading, etc...)
 - The AI could be better, looks like the AI misses late game stuff or is very late in late game.
 - Some parts of the three factions feel pretty unbalanced (especially the Spys are considered pretty weak)

Хромает оптимизация.

Проблема врагов еще в том, что при выставлении 2-х ИИ, один из них 100% аутсайдер, даже при равном уровне сложности. Как бы я не менял их, один доминирует так или иначе, даже если сделать их абсолютно одинаковыми, в плане вида их роли (индустриальный, научный или шпионский).

На данном этапе 6/10, но уже не плохо. Есть просто ОП тактика - с одним из них заключаешь союз, и готовишься гасить другого; отправляешь десант к ""союзнику"", отменяешь ""дружбу"" и выносишь их руководителя, после чего фокусируешься на втором.

The addition of missions and what not sounds super cool but it seems like its behind the separation of the executron which is a weird way to separate the game instead of just letting the ceo do everything. 

Units are once again surprisingly lacking in items and customization? and Even more so, now theres 3 factions so the content has been divided between those 3 factions.

I just wish I could do 1v1 against my friend and have a cool RTS battle mixed with First Person elements, and it's really close to that. But theres a lack of unit variety and depth to the RTS side, and the FPS side is a little unpolished.

I was hoping this would have been a more refined and polished version of the first one instead theres a bunch of new systems added that has just made a bigger pool of systems that are all diluted.

I played this with a group of 4 - 1 player being our CEO. We learned after the first two games that the controls / access to units for the rest of us were very clunky and manual. The ability to fly the ships and dock into others to independently fly them is a neat concept but awkward in execution, while also feeling like a huge waste of effort and time (its an RTS some things shouldn't take .. a few minutes with a high risk of failure). 

Unfortunately the CEO player has the control to play the game themselves effectively while giving the Non-CEO players less controls and makes them feel rather useless / ineffective to the outcomes.

We all noticed while in the main menu that our GPU usage was 100%. This dropped personally down to 7% simply entering the map editor.

EA 2 is a little rough around the edges, but it's foundation is rock solid. The balance is good, there is more than enough content to justify being taken out of early access and it delivers on what it promises.

Stability and performance are acceptable, I have encountered a few minor bugs and the occasional unwarranted FPS drop, but nothing major or off-putting. The UI is a little obtuse as the CEO, and can be downright frustrating as executron. but again it's minor and just needs a tweak and a spit-shine. 
There is a neat mechanic of derelict ships that act as limited time pseudo-dungeons that can be raided for rare tech and other goodies, but once you've seen one you've seen them all. That being said it's still fun and once you get a taste of the sweet loot it offers, you will be hard pressed to ignore them.

I think that would be my biggest complaint about Executive Assault: I want more. Don't misunderstand that, EA2 delivers on what it promises, and with the quantity and quality to justify the price tag many times over. That's the issue though, it promised me a nice dinner and the food was so good I'm now craving a 5 course meal with take-away for later.",1698362631,1698369744,True,33,0,0.792396068572998047,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Если серьёзно, то игра вполне себе хороша
Тут мы играем за корпорацию, продающую всякую хрень(можно самому прописать что, от наркоты и оружия, до чая липтон). В это же время, нам нужно уничтожить своих конкурентов, которые совсем охренели и думают что могут конкурировать с нами.
+Тут есть разнообразные фракции со своими приколюхами и технологиями. Есть ""наземные"" бои, Космические бои и Космическо-наземные бои, в которых можно участвовать самому от 3го и 1го лица.
+Есть кастомизация и билды кораблей, для их усиления
+Есть ядерное оружие
+Можно управлять своими кораблями
+Мультиплеер. Ну что была бы за РТСка без ПВП/Коопа. Но тут можно не только играть как отдельные корпорации, но и за отдельных солдат, которые могут летать делать разные задачи(например идти захватить вражескую станцию), что как бы очень прикольно.
+Что-то на подобии дипломатии и торговли. Тут можно делать альянсы с другими корпорациями и вместе идти бить третьего человека. Так же, в качестве заработка денег, раз в 10-15 минут на посадочную площадку прилетает торговец, который скупает произведённые товары, а так же продаёт разные нужные штуки.

+- Графика и анимации. Тут в принципе на вкус и цвет, но стоит не забывать что игру делал(ет) буквально 1 человек, так что ему простительно :)
+- Обучение. Тут оно странное. Есть подсказки которые появляются по ходу игры, но они часто не дают полной нужной информации. Так же, есть расширенный вариант, но там тоже ерунда какая-та, так что лучше самому провести пару игр с ботами на лёгкой сложности(как игра тебе рекомендует в первый раз) и разбираться по ходу игры.

-Оптимизация. И хотя игра может вести себя нормально, ближе к концу матча, фпс проседает до 20-30(хорошо хоть не 10)
-Отсутствие других языков кроме английского. Для некоторых это может быть проблемно(особенно для троечников), но мне нормально.


Как РТС, игра показывает замечательно, а режим ФПС тут как вишенка на торте, позволяющая самому пойти повоевать.

Pros:
Very pretty game visually compared to the first, and first person controls are very similar to the first, which weren't great, but competent enough to engage in combat.

Cons:
The tutorials popups are as annoying as they are uninformative. A few typos here and there as well but I will not take points away from that since they don't impede gameplay at all. Where tutorials did exist, however, they didn't provide insight on key questions.

In a game, several bugs required demolishing of buildings to allow multiplayer friends through doors which would glitch closed.

Eventually while managing power, my base kind of took on a mind of its own and began building random buildings on its own including a second reactor which the game insists I can only have one of.

Power calculates strangely/poorly. After having 3 power remaining, destroyed 1 building, rebuilt it and suddenly have -1 power which was odd.

The FPS mode is very floaty and feels like a rather bad mid 2000's game on the ground, between janky ADS systems and extremely poor gunplay the ground combat is heavily lacking. Meanwhile in space combat there are a variety of factors that account for a very bad experience such as poor flight controls, horrible enemy ship tracking, region boundaries are not marked and due to how movement/speed works if you go over the boundary for even a moment you can quickly find yourself lost and dead.

You can play as either the CEO who controls the RTS aspect (but can also take control of every unit remotely) or as an Executron who is a first person footsoldier or pilot (3rd person when u take control of capital ships).
The objective is to kill the enemy CEO's.

Initally AI difficulty might seem overwhelming, but as you learn it becomes easier. At first I had trouble surviving on Easy, now I can defeat AI even on Brutal difficulty.

Good:
- 3 rather distinct factions with mostly different units, buildings and even 3 different economies (harvesters, mining bases+transports and telemining).
- CEO can take control of all units remotely or even board them personally (which is dangerous though)
- Dev is very responsive: I report 2 bugs and a week later they are fixed along with other bugs I hadn't even noticed.
- Infantry and land vehicle combat and space combat happening on the same map, not many games do this.
- RTS where u can go inside buildings.

Things I'd rather see changed:
- No first person piloting of capital ships. Probably due to visibility, but I'd prefer the option to switch to first person like in fighters
- Tanks cannot rotate turrets 360 degrees in first person, but are limited to about 90 to 120 degrees, probably to avoid getting disoriented. I'd prefer 360 rotation, with an indicator to show turret position relative to the front of the tank.
- No heavy dropships for the Industrial faction. Infantry along with a single small vehicle (that can enter bases) can be moved with the troop (light) dropship. For larger vehicles you have to use a drop pod launcher, which is silly to me and single use, so u cannot pick up tanks again.
- Global resource pool: I'd prefer every station to have it's own resource pool and that u have to use transports to ferry resources between bases/stations. Only Science factions mining bases have localised resource pools and need transports.
- Can only temporary rotate the camera just like Supreme Commander. when u release it, it reverts to default position. Not much of an issue, but still cooler if it were like Homeworld or 
Ground Control 2.
- It'd be nice that when playing as a CEO, you could also take control of a single Executron (especially in single player).

Bad:
- Camera seems a bit hard to control at times. Centering on a specific unit is hard, especially on land units. Camera and UI sometimes feel a bit clumsy compared to other titles.
- Unit path-finding and moving groups is poor. They try to stay in formation/maintain relative distance, even if u select units that are on opposite sides of the map. It would be nice to be able to choose between ""formation move"" and ""All move to same location"".
- No formations or formal fleets, only groups.

Conclusion & Hopes for future changes:
-------------------------------------------------------
I has evolved from having only space stations and infantry + small vehicles to having Asteroids (square mini planets/islands) and tanks & mechs. It is cool that u can have spaceships in orbit and drop troops and vehicles on land for combined arms assaults.
The developer seems dedicated to the game. The game could use a few QoL improvements, but it is very much playable and enjoyable in it's current state, imho.

It would be cool if at some point it would have actual spherical planets like Planetary Annihilation, Hazeron Starship and the upcoming Fragile Existance, and if dropships could actually be docked onboard capital ships, e.g. 1 small on frigate sized ships, 2 small or 1 large on destroyer, etc. (a bit similar to how rowboats work in Ultimate Admiral: Age of Sail)

But the fact that it's made by ONE GUY tempers a lot of the issues I have with it. It's insanely impressive what he's managed to do on his own. 

The biggest issue is the FPS/RTS hybridity (is that a word?). It's an interesting gimmick that typically creates more problems than opportunities. Unit and VFX scaling has to work in both modes, which is borderline impossible in a game that ranges from ground troops to capital ships. Controlling troops in first-person usually isn't helpful either, and controlling ships is straight-up janky. But it's all worth it to be on the ground when your base is getting nuked from orbit, or to stand on the bridge of your flagship as the fleet warps into battle - it looks absolutely amazing. 

There are also a lot of weird little bugs and UI/UX issues - far too many and most too inconsequential to get into here. 

The good stuff is really good, though: Battles look fantastic - ship explosions in particular look better than most triple-A games. Each faction feels incredibly unique with different play styles and aesthetics while remaining relatively balanced. The AI is competent. The unit customization adds a fun wrinkle to army composition.

3.)  the Executron mechanic. this is such a tedious way to play currently and there's not much that feels like you are helping or really making a huge difference. there's many things that also could be helpful such as quality of life improvements everywhere to lessen this. one thing that bugs me is not being able to use ship ability's while controlling them, you need to ask your CEO to click on you and activate it themselves which i find tiresome. the station combat is a really cool way about it from the executron's pov . One more thing i think would help this alot is maybe adding a personal money system for each executron so that they can buy their own mini fleet or use their cash to upgrade things about themselves only or buy better defenses around the station,place guards,buy fighters,troop transports etc. OK one more thing after that one is let them control units manually that they make or just any from base this lets them be useful and can join front line combat at anytime making the ship battles much more fun and engaging, idk im just shooting ideas currently just feels underwhelming to play as. 

overall a good game with a small team they do good work if you find the concept interesting you'll probably have fun as CEO but as executron its not the best .",1688792025,1688792025,False,1,0,0.508016705513000488,0,True,False,True,True,,,

The game is very fun, while extremely janky, but I do see many people's complaints on how it is highly repetitive with not very much variety in AI tactics to feel like a completely fresh skirmish match. The UI/UX of the game is also flawed, tedious, and aggravating at times to use; the UI feels so clustered at times causing an unimaginative UX. Now one of the main selling points, the FPS/ground control. It is lackluster at best, horrible at worst. Other than using your CEO to walk around your base and watch your beautiful creation, most of the use cases are not there. Why take control of your units when A. you have less control of them and when the actual combat is 2 armies standing and shooting at each other until one army dies. In space its much better, but it still has flaws in the actual flight mechanics. Unit command in this game is also a major con. Whenever you command a group of units to go to a certain place they don't actually go there, what they do is move a certain amount of distance from them to the courser. This can cause units that are far back to not stay with units in front/in the group, creating a mess of controls forcing the player to command small groups or individual units. This is a major issue since by late game you can get massive fleets or armies to that are tedious to command taking your attention away when you could be managing your economy, another battle, building in new space stations or bases. Sadly, without a complete rework of most of game's systems the game will continue to be in a limbo of good but not good enough.

The FPS side would need some work. Going solo in FPS feels slow. You need to be at a place to do anything and dying can make for some travel time. Starting your are out gunned and looking for upgrades in stations/ships feels tedious. 

From what I can tell, being in a building can leave you blind to the outside. Which might mean you're working to grind down an outpost while the main base is getting swamped.

Having a Commander that can communicate helps A LOT. They add a ton to visibility just with their overview. A good commander makes a good game. They can help things feel open with less stoppage. Getting help with personal upgrades helps too. 

The game Needs tutorial too. There are some things online, but they can't cover everything.

Overall, it's a good game. If there's an update planned for the FPS side, I could see this having some fun Co-op.
Having a way to upgrades my own stuff through kills or captures rather than relying on the big guy might help. Like a bounty system, so I'm not taking ages to try and find upgrades.

Hit the ground/ wall/ ... to hard on the attack run to get into the station? Dead. Again. 

After two times it does not make fun anymore. Plus, (all) the weapons feel as if they are from a pre-2000 game and overall it just seems not finished at all. 
Surprisingly the RTS mode (CEO mode) makes fun and has some meaning (with all the management/ trading/ building/ manageing armies/ ...). As CEO you also can fly ships if you want (without the walking after dying), so I do not even get why the ""FPS-only game mode"" is even there. 

Sadly I can not recommend the game. Looking at part one I would wait at least some years (like 5) or better for part 3 and save the money (5$ is way more appropriate than ~20$ now).

As an AI in control of a futuristic corporation, you must build a powerful base, create an army of robotic minions, and strategically battle against rival corporations in a bid for total domination.

One of the best aspects of Executive Assault 2 is the level of depth it offers. The base-building mechanics are intuitive and easy to understand, yet offer a wealth of customization options that allow you to build your base however you want. You can also upgrade your units and defenses to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the game.

The FPS gameplay is also incredibly fun and immersive. You can personally take control of any of your robotic minions and engage in intense battles with enemy forces. The AI is surprisingly challenging, making every battle a thrilling experience that requires careful strategy and quick reflexes.

Graphically, Executive Assault 2 is stunning, with beautiful environments and detailed character models. The sound design is also top-notch, immersing you in the game's futuristic world.

Overall, I highly recommend Executive Assault 2 to anyone looking for a unique and engaging RTS game that combines both base-building and FPS elements. With its deep mechanics, challenging AI, and stunning visuals, this game is a must-play for any fan of the genre.

It still needs work, but in the five years since it has come out, I am really happy to see the amount of growth and love put into this game. I recommend that you all try it, and if you need someone to play with, let me know. I would love to play this game with more people and see it grow. It is that good.

Whether you like FPS or RTS, this game will have something you like. I took a brief look at this years ago and didn't care for what I saw. But now. five years later and ~10 hours in game, I can say I am happy with my purchase. There are three separate factions that each have a different take on how to gain resources, travel, and fight. Industrial CEOs strip-mine asteroids for big chunks of resources, use nuclear power and need to deal with nuclear waste, and make big hulking ships. Science CEOs have lots of cool tech (like their means of transporting troops and ground vehicles, essentially Stargates - or wormholes you can walk through to instantly transport yourself a great distance), but their stuff is more expensive to counter their powerful advantages. Finally, the Spy CEO relies more on subterfuge. They use teleportation technology, and steal resources from their opponents, among other things (watch the newest trailer). I still haven't played them yet, but they seem just as interesting as the Science and Industrial types, so I am very excited to see how they fight.

While some units you produce seem to be carbon copies (e.g., Industrial CEOs get tanks, Science CEOs get walkers, but their UI and control scheme is the same), the weapons and look of the troops between the factions are different. While ground combat still feels a little clunky (I think it is a control issue), it's still fun, manageable, and great to watch a battle line of tanks supported by infantry try to charge your base while you mow them down with a minigun and your clone buddies. Every game starts off in a first-person POV. The mode you selected at the game's start will roughly determine how often you will have to deal with the ground controls (looking at Executrons here), but for an early access game, they suffice for now.

Space combat, however, is where the real fun starts. Taking control of a single star fighter or a large ship is easy to do following the in-game instructions (depending on what mode you are playing, but more on that later). I was stunned by how amazing the visuals were watching ships blow up around me as I led a charge with my capital ship on a kamikaze run into an enemy. Ships have multiple batteries that fire on enemies within range, and when you control the ship, you take over the ""main batteries"" that are typically the real damage dealers of the ship, while the smaller batteries will continue to auto-acquire targets. Big ships are slow and ponderous, while smaller ones zip ahead. If you run into something bigger than you, chances are it will break your ship, especially if you are moving at speed. And most importantly, when ships lose their remaining health, they explode; not like a ""puff,"" more like how the ""Malta"" blew up at the start of Halo 2. They go through a series of smaller explosions until they eventually go critical and shatter. Depending on the ship, it even looks different. TLDR: SHIP COMBAT GUD, DU IT!

As I mentioned earlier, there are two ""modes"" that you can choose between that will really change your game. One has you being the mastermind CEO who has to build, finance, research, and eventually kill their competition. The other has you playing as the CEO's right hand; essentially an officer that can micromanage the troops and fleets produced by the CEO, as well as explore, fight, mine, and recommend attack locations. Of the two ""modes"" available (CEO or Executron), I think I like the Executron the most. It feels like I am playing a perpetually evolving game of Star Citizen, where the galaxy is slowly being filled with more and more ships. And with how tough the AI is (more on that later), playing a game with 3 other AI, and setting them and your CEO onto ""Brutal"" difficulty can lead to some amazing battles and situations. Just be prepared for your CEO to die for your first several games while you are off having fun in space lol. Oh, and by the way, transitioning from fighting in space to landing and fighting on the ground - with no loading screens - is a feat unto itself. But mixed with the graphics and music, you really get an amazing experience darting between battleships in a star fighter, or trying to assassinate the enemy CEO by running past their blockades in your execu-ship.

Some caveats:
 
1) The controls are still hard to come to grips with. Even after tinkering with the settings, I was struggling to land shots on the ground because the sensitivity is so high, and I haven't found a way to change it yet. 

2) This game is HARD. The AI will punish you if you are playing as the executive and not constantly micromanging your fleets, troops, and economy - more so than you would in a typical RTS. Couple this with the learning curve of energy, resource management, research, and base layout that you will need to plan out, and this game gets convoluted fast. (But, I honestly think this is a great thing because the developer has clearly put a lot of thought into this game and its mechanics). This will be a work in process that I know the developer is aware of, but I do want to warn anyone who is still with me here because it can be really discouraging, especially if you value your abilities as a micromanager.

3) It's a novel concept: There aren't many games that do anything like this, so it may take some time to get your head around it and for the developer to come up with solutions for the feedback we give. Aside from maybe Conqueror's Blade, I haven't played many games that let you act as an individual and control AI in combat. It can be very hard to take direct control as a CEO, for example, when you really need to manage the RTS elements, but doing say may help your fleet survive a difficult encounter. However, the AI doesn't take over the micromanagement when your CEO assumes direct control, meaning that you will likely lose efficiency by participating in one of the most fun aspects of the game. It is a pleasant challenge, for me, but I would understand if some people feel overwhelmed by it all. I certainly was the first few hours.

I hope those who stuck around to read this found it helpful and interesting, and I hope you try this game and like it. It has come a very long way, and is still making progress in 2023 as of this writing. I'd also like to thank the developer for their hard work on such a cool game.

The game itself has been getting lots of updates since December, there has been tease of new content coming of new map tools which some have been put already, major balance changes which has greatly improved the game, also tease of a new style asteroid. The developer take on board feed which has been noted in the updates of the game and they are always open to suggest.

Edit 23/11 - Since the launch the game has seeing alot more people now playing the game for matches. Each match is different with the 3 different races its lots of different tec and strategies and can customise your ships with armor/weapon/shields.

[b]3.1.24 The game is now finished, and I can properly inform you of its completed state.[/b]

The RTS, or ""CEO"" experience is a well designed machine of beautiful mechanics.  The menus are breeze to navigate, and the UI never gets in the way.  The economy is diverse but simple to manage.  Base building, unit production, and unit command all work efficiently and intuitively.  CEO's can have players enlist as powerful officer robots called [i]Executrons[/i], or players can to join a company as one.  Executron's have the ability to use [u]all[/u] of the CEO's RTS menus via terminals across various buildings.  CEO's can form alliances with others.  The CEO is able to drop down into first-person mode and control any unit or pilot any ship remotely.  The factions each have unique gameplay and design, with awesome captial ships to christen the late-game battlefields.

The ground experience is an arcade squad-control based shooter.  Simple commands allow you to control your unit's behaviors and tactics.  The enemies are not very difficult, and a human player has much better cover skills than the AI.  The FPS gameplay is no hardcore tactical shooter, but it is very useful to your objective and quite cinematic.  Breaching stations with dozens of troops sprinting around you and hacking doors is some quick fun that the CEO can participate in at any time.  The stations and headquarters look beautiful in first-person, and witnessing the busy fleets and living economy moving all around you is an amazing spectacle.  [b]The experience of scale this game offers is insane- the top down RTS ""visually automated miniature world"" design standard has been shattered by the realization of the entire world from an individual's perspective.[/b]  

And the craziest part: It was all made by a CEO: an human player or AI. 

They are not randomly generated.  They are not a ""set piece"" of a busy station like most RTS buildings.  They are real and fully interactive facilities with real rooms, terminals, mining ships and cargo barges.  This makes the endgame uniquely fun among RTS, even losing- as you will watch a full fleet destroy your base to the last building and then breach your station to assassinate you right at your desk.  Go out guns blazing in a suit and tie and what remains of your company.

The art direction of this game leaves something to be desired.  There is none.  The environments, architecture, and ground units feel as simple and generic as they could possibly be for their respective factions and roles.  The ships are perhaps the biggest outlier to this, as they are diverse and quite fun to use.  That being said, there is a certain kitsch charm to the game's System Shock-esque hallways and goofy slug aliens.  But seriously, I have played browser-based (shockwave)flash games with better aliens (shoutout to Alien X [2001]).  However, the overall function of the game along with its immersive score should be enough to distract you from this.  It is fun, and it works.  There is ambient space music while building, and epic orchestras while battling.

If you're a Star Citizen player, you owe it to yourself to play this.  Everything I want from a decent session of Star Citizen (which can be rare), I get every match in this game.  I get to go mining, dogfighting, looting, raiding, spooling, docking, etc.  Every match.  If you're not an RTS player, it's okay.  This is pure space fun.

This game is a treat for anyone who enjoys RTS, Battlefield, or space sims akin to Star Citizen.  It's really beautiful.",1673877458,1709350188,True,66,1,0.84933161735534668,0,True,False,True,True,,,

Tried it. Beat the AI even though it was fucking hard. Decided to wait a few months to see where it was. They are now prepping it for release so tried it again.

TLDR: Hard pass.

So of course they buffed the AI while doing nothing to help the player. Basic RTS elements are missing such as rally point hotkeys, right click rally functionality. This gets even worse for the execution which not only has nothing to do (it is not a normal hero and as such cannot defend the base against anything but the most pathetic attacks) but is also super janky on the controls. And apparently fixing this before release was not a priority.

Game is also super high contrast, so much so that it hurts my eyes to watch it, especially in executive mode. It was apparently not a priority to fix either.

There is only ONE way to play each faction. And it is in no way shape or form explained to you you what this way is. As a result the game play is stale and boring. For a game which so many aspects to it you would think there would be some room for creativity but no.

Also the executive shuttle is next to worthless as it has no hp. The AI bum rushes you in the first 15 minutes. Base ground defenses are useless. The bottom line is that there was no balancing fixes at all.

The developer is apparently a single dude. Which is fine but know that this is his second attempt at this. He is long on ideas but falls very short on execution. I don't know how he can test his own game and not notice the eye strain.

Fighter controls make war thunder mouse controls look sophisticated and refined. Also not all objects actually have collision so the AI will randomly fly through rocks in space.

Again the ""Execution"" can do nothing to defend the base so when the AI t1 frigate rushes you the only thing you can do is hop in a fighter and then spend the next 2 minutes shooting the same frigate in the hop of doing damage. You do not have a bomber or any anti-ship missiles. Seriously a nuclear missile on a fighter is somehow hard to pull off?

As a early access the game had a lot of promising ideas but it is YEARS away from release at this point and most of the mechanics in the game are going to require a complete redesign, say nothing of the balance.",1673684417,1673684417,False,4,0,0.509826302528381348,4,False,False,True,True,,,

It does have a bit of a learning curve, both playing the game and some bug fighting but its not overly unplayable and it only has Skirmish and Multiplayer for now but the latter, in Co-op is how the game is meant to be played

In short, Its an RTS where you can take direct control of nearly any unit (Miners/cargo ships being more or less the exception) as a simple (and with a somewhat but not unplayable level of jank, mostly visual but some gameplay that has workarounds) FPS or Vehicle (Space and ground) sim, where the bases and space stations constructed in the RTS mode double as Mini FPS levels that occur as fleets battle for dominance in the space around it. You'll be boarding space stations, Commanding fleets, managing trade for technology and equipment normally unavailable for your faction and managing your own space station to further your eventual goal of Killing the Other CEO all at once

I have played EA1 and the only real thing it has over EA 2 is the varied strategies you can employ, EA2  relies on how well you mix your combined arms fleet while EA1 you could in theory, turtle, rush, boom, etc with your different facilities. EA2 is way too much of a macro game to do anything but max production and make sure your mix is good enough to deal with the other Guy's mix (where FPS/Vehicle mode is there for micromanaging fleet/station battles), which is fine but I did like starting off the match with a big 'ol cannon! Plus It wouldn't work here for a variety of reasons, not the least that you will mostly be fighting in Space and its split up into a bunch of smaller maps you fight over instead of fighting in one big map.

EA2 however is a better package because unlike EA1 it actually feels like a complete RTS with a bunch of cool extras. You have three factions with some absolutley nutty gimmicks that make up for EA2's relative strategic Inflexibility (Industrial will be strip mining sectors and sending excess nuclear waste to their foes while outmassing EVERYONE, Science has energy shields and Portals, Spy uses Star Trek style Transporters to ambush bases)

In Multiplayer there even is a very cool Asynchronous mechanic where friends can join in as Executrons, basically First person mini-ceo's that manage the base with touchscreen panels or more likely, lead fleets and ground invasions while the CEO has a high level picture of the whole battlefield. The game even spawns shipwrecks to give the Executron more to do in the early game by letting him EVA Star Citizen or X style to grab crates and give the CEO extra resources or tech, and they are pretty much required for the Unknown ship as its more or less an instanced dungeon where you run through kill off a bunch of infestors and loot the place for crates (You can do this as a CEO but you'll have to micromanage that so much you'll lose sight of the bigger picture I find, better to have an Executron handle that while you deal with your foe)

I HIGHLY recommend grabbing a buddy or two to play it this way, its not required but its the best way to play EA2.",1672600368,1672600368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,True,,,

Executive Assault 2 is incredible, still to this day there are moments when I'm playing with my mates and you just have to stop to take it all in.

I'll try not to go to in-depth but the two major points I'd want to make for anyone who's thinking of getting this would be that, the concepts in this game, the mechanics are just... there amazing, I struggle to think of many games where there's like this 'Hybrid' of FPS and RTS all mashed into one with like a original sci-fi blend, It's just really something else in my eyes.

Second thing to note would be that the games got a lot of love I think from the Devs/Dev... honestly I don't even know if there's a team behind this or if it's just one passionate person working on this but either way it's impressive and the games still getting updates and fixes to this day, so to me that's a really positive sign.

All in all it's an amazing game, I've introduced a lot of my friends to this game, ha and spent a small fortune on getting them all copy's cause I've believed in it enough to know they'd like it too, and thankfully they've all been as blown away as I have, games still in early access so as to be expected there are some rough spots, but the people/person behind this game is still here working on it, each time making it even better then it was before. 10/10 would recommend.",1669862402,1669862402,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True,True,,,

This game is very good for those who like its specific combination of genres. It can go from terrestrial FPS shooter to an RTS commanding spacecraft.

Bear also in mind that I believe only one dev is working on this game, and is doing so out of passion and in their free time; it may never reach a 'completed' stage.
One must be willing to overlook various bugs and visual inconsistencies, as well as a lack of a comprehensive tutorial, to enjoy this game. While it does help that the current gameplay system is simple, it makes a lot of content rather ambiguous. If you stick with it enough, you can sample a majority of the content the game can offer in a few hours, and it offers very short individual games, not allowing much for prolonged combat.

This game has taken years, is being made by one lonely, insane, fuck, and still isn't done. The discrepancy between graphics quality varies wildly from model to model. Most features need incredible fleshing out, and the multiplayer base is all but dead.

That said. This here is one dam fun video game and it's fully playable.

Video games are the biggest entertainment sector globally, bringing in over three bill annually. Now if only the industry could make games instead of a bunch of episodes of video games on an expensive pay per view basis with a shitty finale. 

Rob made this in a cave with a bunch of scraps. His Frankenstein amalgamation of genres plays like how your  inner 12 year old might have dreamed. One second you're sitting in your base, outfitting your meatiest ship with death rays and torpedoes, next you're landing at the enemy's base like D-Day. There's cannons and lasers everywhere. Men and robot soldiers cutting into each other with flame throwers, rifles, and lasguns. Tanks and giant mechs unleashing salvos of siege fire, and incredible fleet engagements overhead raining down godfire upon the hostile fortresses you're assaulting. 

EA2s secret sauce lies in the RTS / FPS combo. While neither a very fleshed out strategy game or shooter, Rob has given his players a ton of stuff to do in between. Every unit is controllable. They can all be upgrade and outfitted to play your way. As a commander, you have incredible flexibility in guiding the war effort system wide. As a dedicated foot soldier, you can apply pressure in specific sectors that can give your faction game winning advantages too time consuming for a CEO to apply themselves to. 

Why this game is particularly notable as of this month, for the first time EA2s playerbase has access to a complete game play experience. From war start, to war end, early game to late, after over four years of early access, Rob is finally able to take this baby to complete game status. While tutorials are hard to come by, the mechanics to play a full game are here, and it feels like it. There's nothing BIG missing it doesn't feel like. Everything I want to do is in here at some level, albiet many begging for expansion upon. If you've been holding off on this game, or have it and have been previously unimpressed, I would endorse this game as currently worth a shot.",1669658197,1669658574,True,1,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,True,True,,,

It has all the building blocks of an RTS, reminding me a little of Age of Empires and Total Annihilation, but the Executron feature makes an interesting change in how you can approach playing it (with friends).

I don't really play this by myself, but when I get together with my wargame buddies we spend 3 hours on it, one as the commander (playing the RTS) and the others as Executrons, following orders, taking over command outposts, claiming Ancient Energen facilities and looting derelict ships. This game is, to me, what makes videogames fun. You buy the game and get the whole game, no paywall for extra content, no battlepass, no nothing. Then the game presents you with the basic building blocks of a genre with a couple of twists to make it unique and interesting and then you play the game however you want. Sometimes, my friends and I will play it seriously, even turning to military commands and terms to communicate. Other times, we'll asteroid bomb the enemy base, and then escort the CEO to the base so he can personally assassinate the enemy CEO, winning us the game.

The only things I would complain about is how the game doesn't seem to be optimised very well, running at about 20 fps, sometimes dropping to 10, and how it could get repetitive in its current state if played a lot in a short span of time.
These things don't really bother me, as it's a once-in-a-while kinda game for me and the gameplay is fun enough that the FPS doesn't matter (but would be a nice quality of life thing)

It takes someone who is more than a good game developer to reinvent the wheel in terms of game feel for a new genre (FPS/RTS). That's why, in my opinion, FPS/RTS games all have terrible game feel.
As you see I refunded the game so this title is no exception to my opinion. 
There are many glaring issues with this title. The clunky almost Empyrion-esque UI / interaction with the game, the terrible gunplay, and very apparent dust trail where the devs are furiously trying to catch up to the features they need to add to make this into a proper game.
Stations cannot have more power added onto them so expansionism is questionably even possible at best. The movement controls are definitely linear in terms of game feel. Multiplayer set-up was also confusing as you couldn't set player count like you would in many other games. It was implied that you were in the game by default and that adding x2 other players would be adding a total of three player slots per game. The economic options are also rather simplistic - which coming off a supreme commander high - is like a drop off a mountain.

Not to be overly optimistic, but this game is not terrible. It's like a rough unpolished lump of metal with both minor and major issues to combat. That said it is by no means a diamond in the rough (to the developer reading this I am sorry for the harsh words). With a very intense labor of love this could be made into something like Zero-K or Empyrion that has replayability and interesting combat. However without polish, gameplay depth, and a complete dive into fixing the game feel: it won't take off the way any of us hope it will. 
There is nothing more annoying than a restaurant critic that cannot cook or a game critic that can't design games on some level so I'm sure this comes across as rather out of line. I'll check back in from time to time, but this needs more work before I can play it.",1652055584,1652055584,False,6,0,0.480928033590316772,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The ships can fit basically lasers and shields with some bought improvements and the research tree is fairly small so it completes in a short time leaving just the fight which for some is good but others want a long marathon style climb up the tech latter. The interface to finding the ships on the systems not galaxy map is challenged an arrow button jumping you from ship to ship would help or something similar. The cargo ship transport lines are very confused and micro managing trade routes if possible is very hard to figure out and the cargo ships have minds of their own which hurts when your money and resources are dependent on them and the specific mats they bring  as science corp anyway. The limit of ships to 100 and droids to 100 is beyond annoying if you want to expand past your home asteroid as if anyone hits any area with a full attack wave of a hundred you cant possibly secure an expanded region when you are limited to a certain amount yourself so your forces will always be outnumbered and the defenses of buildings are not enough either. The ideas of the game are good and if it ever comes together in full vision i think it will be a massively big hit. Still it is a war shooter for those that like that sort of thing but for a marathon rts player we just like alot more.

I would highly recommend this, especially if you have friends to play with. While resource intensive, something that has improved since it's first release, it is a fun romp in a galaxy of corporate warfare. Well, solar system but it still counts. Genuinely good game, and the developer works hard with it. 

Pros: 
-Vibrant and colourful art style, with some really cool models.
-The 3 factions currently available are extremely interesting and give a good variety in the game play loop. 
-The trading mechanics are simple and easy to learn, but also give a feeling of varied play. Industrial goods based game-play is a viable option, where the goods can bring in a decent amount of resources for your faction.
-Watching an orbital bombardment on your base is a wonderful thing, and helps alleviate the sting of death.

Cons:
-Resource intensive, seriously it can make modern extremely capable systems sweat at times.
-The new update, that being the Asteroids content release, is still somewhat bare bones for the factions. Research is limited for them, and there are some factions that are just far more useful.
-There are numerous bugs, mostly involving your own AI, but these are mostly annoyances instead of game breaking.
-Trading, while viable, can be hit or miss. A simple mistake can cripple you for long periods of time, and this can certainly happen because of the AI accidentally nuking the trader when they warp in system.
-The ground combat needs more uses other than station and home base raiding, tanks are really only useful in defending and attacking home stations.

It was fantastic to play, especially with a group of Executrons (though arguably I spent more time trying to protect myself from my friends' morbid curiosity when it came to questions like, ""Will a rocket launcher kill my boss?""). 

Now upon playing the new instalment, I'll put it like this: 
There's a small learning curve to it, much like the last one. However this is absolutely no issue. The game is relatively easy to learn and there's a wealth of info provided in-game through the manuals. If anything, the manuals are far better in this game than they were in the previous. 

I would very very very VERY HIGHLY recommend this game if you're interested in strategy games and I especially recommend it to those who want an RTS game with just a little more action. Being able to go to 1st person at any time and control your units is not only fantastic, its revolutionary. To this day I still haven't found any game/franchise that can compete with this. I've only encountered one other game that does this (somewhat) and it was terrible. Executive Assault takes the gold here yet again. Based on that alone, I'd recommend buying it. For those who are interested in getting a little more detail, I will happily provide. 

This game takes the action and destruction from other RTS games, and combines it with some great management skill (nothing to scare of a casual player in case you're put off by this). Plenty of economy management in there, from running your mining operations, to keeping freighters and cargo shuttles protected, to running multiple space stations. This gives you plenty of things to do in-between combat and helps you make the most of every resource you have. Knowing that I need to defend my station so that I can maximise selling ""Propane and Propane Accessories"" is absolutely joyous. 

Moving on to most people's favourite part, the combat. I'll put this very simply. The combat is very good. The AI has seen some pretty damn fantastic improvements from the last game. Most combat will take place in space via ships, however if you wish to win you'll need to familiarise yourself with ground combat. Unlike the last game, you can now attack/bombard structures from outside. This can do damage like destroying all internal security systems (such as doors and turrets) or in the case of space stations, completely and utterly obliterate the structure. At the end of the day though, you'll need to familiarise yourself with some ground tactics as in order to win the game you'll need to muster up a team and take the fight inside your enemy's base. The CEO will more than likely remain in his office, so its up to you to find him, and blast him back to the dark ages. My friends and I have personally found that the rocket launcher makes for a fantastic CEO-Obliteration-Technique, though if this is unavailable then any old weapon will suffice. The CEO tends to be rather squishy, so if you wish to live long, I would advise you to stay inside and absolutely refuse to touch grass under any circumstances. You're a gamer after all, so this shouldn't be too hard for you. 

My review is already long enough, so to wrap it up, we'll quickly cover unit customisation. Yes. Every unit can be customised to suit any and all needs, except delivery of coffee. To this day I still have not perfected this particular program. Each unit can be equipped with various weapons, armour, gadgets and modules. Each ship can be designed uniquely, and can be given more powerful upgrades as the game progresses. I've personally found that keeping your ships as up to date as possible is a good way to keep yourself alive. You may go bankrupt in the process, but that's ok. Your rivals can't make more money than you if you destroy them first. Build your fleets, create your armies, storm their base and absolutely obliterate their social credit score with some naughty internet searches. 

Overall I give BOTH Executive Assault games an absolutely glowing review. This game deserves more credit than it has been given, and I will stand by this statement until the end of both my natural and unnatural life, as I will be forced to serve our grand CEO as an Executron for eternity. Happiness is temporary. Energen Credits are forever.",1640760187,1640760187,True,14,2,0.640358984470367432,0,True,False,True,False,,,

When you can make server and multiplay stable, this will be one of greatest but sadly not really known game in steam. But I love the game ideas you have in here.

Let user make their dedicated server, it should help playing in multi.
Anyway I really look foward to keep developing of this game.

This RTS/FPS blend that a lot of people tried to do and failed. This is not the case for EA2. Game delivers everything it promises. Three factions, each with different approach to energy which is THE most essential thing in the game. Each with its different designs of both land and space units as well as research is different for all of them since they are all using different tech. You can take control of almost every unit at your disposal (from soldiers to biggest ships). So far i have not encountered any bug and everything works like it should. The game lets you start as one of two positions - CEO and Executor. CEO have total control over everything and Executor reduced control to be mostly military leader (have not tried Executor with only AI yet, only played as CEO). So far i have been learning the game and i think i can say that i learned to play as Scientist faction and its great and OP! I also like that game is not only about taking territory, combat and trading. There is a lot of Ancient Space Stations just ready to be plundered of boxes (research or resources) and taken. There is also one huge ship coming from time to time into different systems but i have not got there so far. In the end, yes you can see that game is really in development, there can be little fps drops and little graphic things about models and collisions. BUT. Everything that game offers is really working and the game itself is in really great and stable state even in its version. I have tried and really enjoyed every unit there is for science faction and game itself is really worth full price even now! 7/10 and i think it will be 9/10 maybe even 10/10 because it has the potential to be the best game in its genre.",1640702229,1640702229,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I still recommended, overall, but it was based off of some misconceptions and assumptions on my part.

It does need work, It's got a steep learning curve. Less so than X-3 but definitely above average. It does have a manual which stands in for a tutorial but it skips out on some of the minor details that can really cause some annoyance.

I did believe it had some balance issues before and while I still think that is true I do not believe it is to a game breaking degree. Tweaks definitely need to be made but for now it is a little lacking content wise. Does have some replayability factor though because of multiple factions and maps.
 Content wise I'd like to see them increase the map choices, more ships, larger maps, maybe twice the size. Right now 9 sectors/planets are the limit (similar to SoSE in visual lay out), at least 18, in my own opinion should be possible, personally I'd like to see 20, a fun little sandbox to play around in. I'd really like to see more technologies to chose from and maybe more expansion options. Right now player can feel rather hemmed in and the ability to produce reactor cores would be great.

What keeps me coming back, and probably my personal favourite thing about the game is the music. It's very atmospheric and works well to set the mood without being monotonal. Build up and combat feels very different because of this. Build up is somewhat relaxing and when the combat music plays you get a small sense of urgency and the little details feel all the more important.

 So thus far I continue to recommend. Whether or not is stays that way, in the long term, depends on how the game develops from here.",1640590306,1641616687,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True,False,,,

On the RTS/Economy side of things... I love it. I'd like to see the economy and interactions with the universe expanded some more, but what's here is quite solid, and enjoyable.

The spaceship combat is arcadey, but fun, and there's actually some benefit to player controlled ships. 

For a $25 indie game, I think it's great. Development has taken some time, but follow the discord for access to the latest betas, and you'll see that it's definitely being worked on... it just takes time, and I think it's worth it to get a 
solid game like this, because if we get an EA3 it's going to be a long long time from now.

If you can look past the Early Access flaws and lack of polish, I'm gonna say it's absolutely worth the money. Just don't go in starry-eyed expecting it to be the perfect FPS/RTS hybrid in its current state.

Oh. One last thing. The gameplay is slow-paced. It's enjoyable to me, but probably good for you to know up front. I spent 3hrs in one match last night alone.

Also... I don't think the game really has a save function yet, so have fun and don't get too attached to your progression.",1636738495,1636738495,True,9,0,0.59922260046005249,0,False,False,True,False,,,

My biggest issue as of Summer 2021 are the UI elements:
-should be able to see unit groups you select
-should have options for scroll/zoom sensitivity and edge panning
-some issues with issuing orders to groups of units, pathing indicators, etc.
-should able to queue orders (e.g. shift+click move, shift+click mine)
-first person sensitivity way too high, couldn't find an easy adjustor
-should be able to see control groups you assign
-camera is clunky, should be easier to look around your ships in 3rd person and admire the incredible scale of the battles
-could really, really use a higher unit cap
-should be easier to navigate help menu/info menu in game
-with no tutorial it is a bit of a challenge the first couple hours

The core gameplay needs some work, the AI needs improved and it does seem to be missing a lot of elements that I think would really draw people in, but for what it is it's a fun and niche game. A few suggestions on what to add:

-FPS ship combat needs to be a thing. The first thing I wanted to do when I made my capital ships was walk around in first person mode. I could easily see this being an enjoyable FPS option. It doesn't have to be all out like turning capital ships into moving stations, but just adding corridors and security checkpoints to give attackers some obstacles on their way to the bridge would be ideal. This would also be great for the large mining ships, allowing you to hijack it and take the cargo, ransom it, etc. More options are definitely key here I think. 

-The base building is great but needs a few minor QOL improvements I think. More corridors would be awesome, being limited to 5 is very annoying when trying to build a large station that's also visually appealing. And it's an odd number which means you can't do the same thing on both sides of the station :/
Another thing I noticed is the garrison, it has literally no doors at all. I don't understand how it's supposed to be so secure if they can just run right through it even on red alert status. I think it needs blast doors on all sides, that way when the enemy breaches a door they run into a bottleneck and get shot from all angles while they attempt to open another door. This could be expanded past garrisons to corridors as well, maybe making security corridors a thing and slowing down the enemy lemming train to your CEO. This would force players to think more and rely on tactics to breach your defenses. I'm picturing the blast doors on the trade federation ship from star wars the phantom menace while I type this lol. And being able to use and modify outdoor turrets seems like an essential part of station construction that was overlooked for some reason. If people want to just build a fortress and not rely on combat ships they should be given the option, and stronger defensive turrets would make fighting the larger ships of late game more appealing instead of dreading it because you're so caught up in the station building atmosphere. Sometimes I like to just see what I can build and getting attacked by large ships every 30 seconds is really annoying when my turrets are so weak and I have to sit there on red alert for 5 minutes. I think an automatic red alert option for stations would be great as well. I built a station in an asteroid rich system and I don't remember getting a warning that it was being attacked. I just switched over to it and it was gone lol. It would have been nice if it fought back on it's own. This also seems like an oversight because of the FPS aspect, it's hard trying to micromanage stations and fight in first person at the same time. And you can't just put them all on red alert because it harms production. 

-Soldiers/cyborgs need more gear too. I like the research but it needs more options I think. I see in unit creation that soldiers have empty slots at the bottom for things like armor and engine, these could be applied to their relevant units for even more customization. I'm assuming this is already the plan though, for a truly great FPS experience you're gonna need it I think. No one is gonna want to run around with a laser rifle and a weak sidearm for too long, more hi-tech weaponry and equipment is in order I think. This would also be great for the CEO, maybe even giving them a personal force field or advanced body armor or even a powered suit. There could also be a larger variety of soldiers and cyborgs that fill different roles giving you more of a team atmosphere instead of just throwing a bunch of lemmings at them until they die. You could have demolition units that are necessary for breaching blast doors and destroying other objects that may have looked at you wrong lol, heavy assault units acting as a front line, espionage units that can steal information or sabotage things, etc. Or maybe just give them a bunch of different gear options so you can create your own specialized units. But this would be a great improvement for the FPS side of things and even if it's not fantastic I could see it at least being comparable to star wars battlefront or something and that would be sufficient I think. Maybe you could act as a squad leader and get AI units to follow you so you could team up with another CEO with their team and accomplish 2 tasks at once. Just various things like that I feel would add more fun dynamics to the game and bring in more players. 

That being said, I like the game and I would definitely recommend it. It's not polished, it has some flaws, but it has potential and there are so many things that could be added in the future.

- [b]The UI is a mess.[/b]  Here's the process to create and join a coop vs AI game:
[olist]
   [*]Select the correct region at the top before hitting create
   [*]Set Rival Corps to 1, set the player/AI slider to 1 AI, 0 players.
   [*]Start game, your friends will not be able to join at the start, there's no lobby
   [*]You must build an executron facility before your game is joinable
   [*]Have your friend input the game password in the password field
   [*]Have your friend swap regions multiple times until a green ""Join as Executron"" button appears to the right of your game in the list

I've had this game sitting in my library for years, and in that time I really can't say I've seen any real development take place. It's shallow, slow, and quickly loses it's rts/fps novelty.

The Long:

I bought this game originally to support it but it's clear the devs are making little to no progress, and the current state, which is little to no different than what it was a few years ago, is probably going to be close to what it is released as.

I have only played in single player, which is currently limited to a max of 2 opponents and 9 systems, and feels tiny. With how slow the game moves (specifically ships) you can expect a game to last no less than 45 minutes, usually going for hours with the first 25 just building up resource ships and a base. I honestly AFK at the start of matches after starting my build que since there is nothing to do.

Ship control is portrayed as epic, but is really only cool for about 2 minutes before you realize that the only real benefit of controlling a ship is cinematics and flying the incredibly slow tugboat to manually scout, it has little benefit in combat, in fact you are more likely to do worse than autofire.

FPS in stations is ok, you do actually benefit by taking control sometimes in that and is the only place where rts actually shines, although dimly. Troop transports are a pain to use, and honestly so tedious I stopped using them as why would I bother capturing a station when the game already moves so slow and it's just easier to blow up and replace? Tactically it costs more time and resources to capture an existing station than to just destroy it.

Everything else in the game is unbalanced, automated or just dull. I can't see any reason why anyone would buy this game over any other generic RTS on the market other than the RTS/FPS combo novelty which is frankly just a poor experience in this game. This game needs a LOT of work to get to being worthwhile and good, and I don't see that ever happening with these devs.

1): The servers are practically empty. There are for the longest time of owning this game for half a year at least so far almost no servers in this game and when there are there is about at max 5 i have ever seen. 

2) Default game movement control issues. The ability to move in the game generally is in a way wonky and has a very sensitive mouse cursor (much like Star Wars Republic Commando if you ever tried it). the speed at which you are moving is difficult to bear as its as if you are speed running and makes the experience uncomfortable. 

3): The inability to talk. Yup, you read it. This game has no ability whatsoever to communicate via voice chat between executrons (player assistants) to the  CEO player. The only voice communication that was once enabled was a 15 second voice transmission only for the CEO. All other forms of communication are by text and that can be incredibly annoying especially with the power issues between executron and CEO.

4): CEO power abuse. The CEO or person who owns the faction when the game starts up can open up an executron factory which allows other players to join in the game as executrons. All executrons are other people basically and their goal is to do what their boss tells them to do in short and simple. The CEO has the ability to kick any executron they desire with or without reason. So add this up with a poor text based communication (#3) and the rarity of servers that pop up (#1), and you may get kicked by the only server there for the week or longer based on a misunderstood order or just because the CEO didn't like you for whatever reason.

5): The bots here are not the smartest. The bots in this game commonly get stuck on corners of the building and when trying to raid an enemy base with a large amount of robots and  it goes down a single file line trickle, your not going to have a good time. 

6): You cant aim. As an executron with some of the rifles that seem to have a scope attached in FPS mode you can right click hold to 'aim' but it is not down the sights, instead it is just zooming your FPS camera screen by about 20% giving you the feel that your head is closer beside the gun. Not a very fun feature to me. 

7): EA2 (Executive Assault 2) discord server is practically unheard of. Believe it or not but there is a discord server for this game! The only problem that i noticed with it is that there is a lack of using the discord chat for the game. Fortunately, this might be a valid solution for solving the problem with #3 IF the discord is made more aware of directly to the game... Or until voice chat is enabled in the game. 

8): Difficulties landing. When playing as an executron, the game mechanics dictate that you have to press a certain button to initiate a landing sequence instead of landing that is much more free willed and manual in any other game. Trust me, ive tried landing manually but every attempt ends up being a crash in the force field right outside the hangar in all forms of stations.

------------------------------
The new 'Asteroids' Update has been released and with it the game has changed in a wonderful way that is now more akin to the Original 'Executive Assault' 

The Core RTS Experience in this game is wonderful (If a little janky at times) with the main game being a resource gathering, base-building space game about invading your enemies base and assassinating his leader. Which is where the Unique Quirk of Exec Assault 2 shines, rather than spamming the biggest units until you blow up the building this game features a unique FPS mode which lets you get close and personal and explore EVERY single building and corridor you have created. Even letting you use the panels inside to construct new units (ETC)

Whilst the FPS experience is the weaker part of this game due to it's uhh... unpolished animations and awful aiming, it is still a charm you can't deny seeing your space armada duking it out above you in real time. (And yes that looks as incredible as you imagine) Thanks to the new asteroids update you can now land your forces at your enemies door using Drop-Pods, Hybrid Space to Ground mechs... Teleports... Spy-Plants? There's a lot of unique ways to win this thing!

The trading system and 'Goods' system is not to my tastes personally, and often feels like it's just a tacked on resource, there should be a more elaborate way of delivering your companies goods so that they could possibly be intercepted or put on hold, as really it just feels like busy work to get you a little boost in research points and such. 

The FPS in bases as i described was pretty cool! But the FPS cockpit view of the Star Fighters is a little jarring, and often results in you just being better off letting the AI handle things! (Perhaps that's my awful flying tho)

Factions are lack luster in my opinion, or at least i never bothered trying to make friends with them as by the time i'd even headed out to other systems i had a big enough fleet to obliterate them. Which does bring me to a personal warning... Don't leave you star system undefended, the 'Protestors' will occasionally storm your main base and attempt to actually kill you. i learnt this the hard way.

All in all Executive Assault 2 is a highly experimental feeling game which should be bought for it's unique features and for a cool factor, do not expect the polish of a triple A title, but rather enjoy it's unique offerings! If you have some friends to play with this game can honestly be an absolute blast to play, you could even have a friend helping as an 'Executron' which is his own unique spawn-able unit which can help you build or defend you. (Or if you want you could just both have your own team and enjoy big space battles which is ALWAYS cool)",1602712706,1639950418,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

It is currently not optimized particularly well, but it will hopefully get there. I am writing this review as a plead to the developers of features I would find very interesting ingame, however impossible they may seem.

First off I am so happy they brought back the troop transports! I however miss the docking on external ports, I got a special star-wars feel whenever I saw the doors open and my troops sally out. I really hope for any type of boarding pods, or such thing to board the biggest ships, and have ship battles. This could be made by having a small crew on capital ships that count towards ""infantry"" population. (15 or so guys on a ship). They would be supported by interior defences and such. And the whole point of the boarding would be to go to the engine of the ship, destroying it to detonate the ship. 

For this to work there would have to be some buffs to ship health to make this a thing you would want to do.

I would be absolutely be thrilled if the main base was on a planet, and the place we build big ships would just be a space station. I can imagine after conquring space, that you have to conquer the planet that your base is on (or a little map) with a planetary invasion and orbital bombarment. With the incredibly smart system of construction and RTS/FPS that exists in the game, I can imagine bunkers and defensive lines, or other ways of defence, depending on the faction!

And a good thing to invest in would be a planetary defence cannon, that can only shoot the biggest and deadliest ships. (Just so you cant use the monolith to devastate the planet)

I can imagine conquering the planetary defence cannon so it cannot retaliate, and thereafter pulverize the planet, uuuu getting shivers.


Oh- add robots that do maintainance and such around the space station once we can get the unit caps really high.

I believe in some sort of version of everything I said because I can see the amount of work Hesketh studios are putting into this project! And I truly believe that are going to implement some really cool features :) 

For now, I would be happy if big ships could dock, and executrons could pilot my flagship, and tell me things from a tactical view :)",1597581508,1597581508,True,14,1,0.650453031063079834,0,True,True,True,False,,,

The foundation is very solid but of course I have a wishlist of things that I hope will come in the future:
- Additional CEOs with different Genders and Species may be even a pure Robotic faction resembling Cylons from BSG.
- Optimised performance. 
- Bridge and/or turret view for the bigger vessels that you can controll while you are fighting. Additional stations on a single Vessel so that one Dreadnought could be controlled by several people. (would be nice to have, not a must)
- Different corridoors for the bigger pods of your fleet. (also nice to have but no must either)
- A possibility to connect portals to your large vessels instead of clicking back and forth as executron on the map.
- Instead of multiple portal per station just one but with a dialing terminal to switch destinations (not a must)
- Classic Sci-Fi vintage explosion sounds (the infamous double kabooms... this I would consider a must have) 
- the ability to take over enemy vessels. 
- tbc. 
- A blue box and an army of angry tincan-mutants wanting to EXTERMINATE everything.

Conclusion: The multiplayer alone is worth a buy if you have a least one friend who is fan of vintage sci-fi or somebody who feels like  she/he is mood for lasers and lots of explosions.

Multiplayer is the most fun, where your friends can Join as a Executron and do the FPS mode dirty work for you! You can Command a fleet or just bring in a Command troop of Marine Bots inside the enemy station to assasinate the enemy CEO! It really is Fun! Your friend can Launch fighters, take Control of Units, Build units bots and much more. Communication is a must so you tell him what to do and you can do other stuff! Imagine having 12 friends in a lobby and you tell them what to do!

Considering the game says you can control multiple ships in multiple fleets.. its not even close to that. The Fleet cap only makes up about 1 fleet In my honest opinion.

This new recent update for me really ruins the game play as it was currently. Theres really not even close to enough ships/tech/buildings in game to split it up into 3 categories like they decided to limiting its already very limited content to now having to choose do you want or this? Which sounds great for different play styles... if there was more content to enjoy it with.. 1 style literally only have 3 titan ships... lame, another has a giant laser weapon that when charged apparently can destroy enemy stations from other side of map.. seems too OP to me. and they removed transport ships from being avail for all 3 classes something which every class should included for the boarding enemy stations thing.. you kind of ruin that feature when you take away certain abilities to actually board... if no transports and no gateway station how? and then at that point what is the use of even making robots other then to defend against the enemy who decided to pick the class with gateway station or the transport..",1593311848,1595682086,False,38,5,0.643587231636047363,0,True,False,True,False,,,

When you control your ships, you can look at yours ships engage enemy ships without directly controlling which I think is cool. I like how you can board enemy outpost and HQs. I hope they add where you can board enemy ships too; I haven't research that far into the game yet so I hope so. The research is a bit generic, but ok.

After the disappointment and terrible treatment I got throughout my time with the first game, I just didn't have any hopes anymore, but I wanted to believe. Sadly, I was right. And I knew I was in for a great start when I found the first bug 5 seconds from the moment I was able to control the CEO. Yeah, that's not how a ""reload"" works.

So anyway, I tried out a few things. To speed up things, cause I sure will not go beyond the refund limit, I've also tried one ""creative"" match. I really don't want to waste as much time and effort as I did with the previous title, so to keep it short:

- Despite what I was told, this game feels exactly like the first and is perfectly comparable.
- The UI needs work.
- The animations, if present, still feel extremely rigid and unsatisfying.
- Overall sound design, or rather the lack of it, leaves no room for immersion.
- Performance is quite terrible. A few larger ships and some fighters quickly dropped the framerate into the 30's. And that's with a 3950X and a 2080 Ti, though neither even cared. The game is just as bottlenecked by itself as the first one. You'll be going for very short matches if you want a decent experience.
- The controls made me want to uninstall within 10 minutes. Pro tip: Never misplace a corridor. You might hurt yourself trying to select it...and then proceed to wait a whole minute until it VERY slowly explodes in order to get rid of it.
- Graphics wise, this game is 95% over the top lightning/reflections. Yes, it looks nice on screenshots and trailers. Yes, you'll get tired of it very quickly.
- The multiplayer is dead. Period. Haven't seen a single lobby. No different from the first one. If you want to play this, you'll need friends. And you'll want friends to play this.
- I didn't even bother trying how the AI works indoors, given the performance issues this game has. But from ship fights alone, it was rather chaotic.
- The price tag is way too high for what's offered. This should be 10 bucks at most. And that's being generous. Honestly, make it 3 or 5 and try to make use of a niche. Or at least give people the ""Ah well, it was just 5 bucks"" feeling and leave yourself some room to work with.

I could go on, but if I give too much feedback I'll get banned again. At least that's the treatment I got when I once put trust into this developer. From my experience with the first game, I can only figure that the developer hates if you point out too many bugs and might ban you along with all your posts. Of course, I am not saying he will, I am just saying that's what he did to me. So I doubt much improvement is ever gonna happen. Which does seem like a reasonable assumption, given it's been out since October 2018 and still has such a terrible first impression. God...I still don't understand how a single man project, of all things, would be so iron against actual feedback and bug testing.

Anyway, I'll be refunding as this recent hands-on experience gave me nothing but reasons to refund it. In a very short time frame, no less. The idea is, just like the first game, very interesting. But the execution, no pun intended, is utterly lacking.

Bonus: The monolith superweapon does not know friend nor foe. If you press that button in your sector, it will nuke your own base, and you cannot stop it. Oversight or feature...hard to tell.",1585582028,1585582114,False,13,5,0.458047091960906982,4,True,False,True,False,,,

There are multiple features which are consistently made unusable by glitches (like activating the Monolith's ""death star"" weapon), and the gameplay itself wavers between acceptable and clunky. The RTS aspects are decent - somewhat reminiscent of Empire at War - but the experience is dulled by more irritating bugs (many ships will start to follow an order, and then stop halfway through; some of them will just ignore you completely and continue flying to their deaths).

The FPS aspect is nothing more than a novelty; while piloting your own ships/controlling your own soldiers does allow you to perform better than the AI pilots, the whole experience is too clunky and unresponsive to make it worth while, much less fun.

Overall, again, the core idea of the game is great, and if you're like me, you'll likely waste a few hours trying your best to squeeze some enjoyment out of it, but all-in-all this game is just a poorly executed, disappointing mess, despite 2 years of development.",1584235879,1584235879,False,31,0,0.65475541353225708,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros
-Easy to get the concept and ideas of. As well as easy and fun to understand
-cool *** space battles, as well as boarding parties onto enemy stations
-Nice graphics for an early access game
-Fun and addicting to play all around in general (I played 2, 2 hour sessions and didn't even notice how much time had passed)

Cons
-In between tip of the ice berg and slightly in-depth on mechanics and items in the games. Although the research tree is fleshed out a bit I'd like to see some unique station design.
-Only doors are hack-able (I know its a strange thing to point out but hear me out). If your raiding a station and its in condition red you'd want to find a terminal to disable that so you'd have a much easier time raiding the station. It'd be nice to see a class of bot that could achieve something like that.
-(relating to my last point) Few bot classes, there a big opportunity to really put some specilization into that category and possibly some more mechs aswell.

All in all its a fabulous start and I can't wait to see what comes next. Certainly a fun concept to mix fps and rts and the game really plays on it well.

It's a vanity project for the developer and a few fan boys.  Otherwise, everything written below about the state of the game and it's playability remains on point.  If you like cramped game concepts, limited development options, and poor replayability, then go for it.

It would be a good idea, if you're considering buying into this now four year old 'Early Access' game to recconsider.  While asking you to invest in the project, the developer has made it clear that only those approved opinions of the game will be considered and then only if you are on the Discord.  Normal discussion is not allowed to influence decisions about game play problems.  Having stated on the page offering the game for sale that opinions are welcomed and will be considered on the discussion forum, this is not the case; and the developer makes periodic changes to be assessed only by a select group. all other opinion labeled as 'hostile' and a bother.  The result is a mishmash of changes, not all bad, but arbitrary with little documentation to explain the changes or rationale for doing so.  Not sure how long a game can justify being early access, but given the arbitrary nature of the current product, let the buyer beware.  The comments below were made over a year or more ago.  While some of the evaluations below don't reflect later changes, including some real improvements--then undone by later 'improvements'--not much has changed.

Once again, the developer has added a bunch of stuff that comes with no documentation, no explanation, no idea on how to use all the added items.  So, it's back to not recommending this to anyone.

Tutorial information has limited utility and some odd glitches where sentences aren't finished.

The trade mechanics are unclear, especially since this is one of the areas of greatest changes that makes the game more interesting.

Sectors are still woefully lacking in resources and control over resource gathering is awkward at best.

The tech tree remains scanty, although station development options are much improved.



Came back after months to find the game little better than first release.  Claims for improvements, like claims that video footage of fleet engagements are from actual game play, test the limits of veracity.  The tutorial is laughable.  The depth of play is a mile wide and and an inch deep.  Still in early access after all this time has passed.  No campaign game.  Galaxy is limited to 9 systems, which of course aren't systems just grid squares with a few resource nodes.  Opponents are limited to 2.  Replay is, therefore, not just repetitive but pointless.  Ship battles are in slow motion.  Research is cumbersome and ship slots only allow a couple of options so you can't, for example choose shields and armor; similar limits on weapons, missiles or beams or cannons.  Diplomacy is pointless.  So, it's back on the back shelf for me.  If you're thinking about buying, well, caveat emptor.


There's a potentially decent game in here somewhere, but so far the developer(s) hasn't found it.  Indeed it seems to get more muddled with the updates.  Not sure how long a game can claim to be in early access and not see real improvements (see comment above) in basics, though opponents are upped to 3.  So, back on the shelf.  Maybe someday.

So, after the latest patch, came back to see if things got better.  Simple answer: NO.

The patches seem to address things that are irrelevant--you can choose your player color--rather than address substantive problems.  

A litany:

The whole system setup, that is where the action begins in a particular system/sector, is feeble.  A corporation is supposed to have made a serious decision to invest in a station in a system that has virtually no sustaining resources--ironite.  On the easiest setting this is only around 30000.  This makes it virtually impossible to develop the defense assets one needs when the AI starts spamming attacks, which it can do in the dozens in the time it takes the player forever to accrue anything worthwhile.  Additional assets can be bought, but traders show up with virtually useless amounts of ironite much of which has to then go into the production of goods for sale.  So, you're constantly strapped for money--unless you use the cheat code, which obviates the whole design for game play, meaning you can spam just like the AI.  No strategy needed.  

There's no real diplomacy.

There's no real economy, and what there is is screwy.  It takes, for example 500 ironite to build the simplest space ship and 230 to build the basic soldier.  Really?  More than half the cost of a spaceship for a soldier?

There's really nothing to do worth doing.  Nice graphics don't make up for poor conception.

9/23/20:

More useless updates from the developer.  Doesn't address real problems/issues.

AI opponents still spam attacks.
Pricing structure for ships/soldiers is screwy--a single mechanoid costs more than most starships.
Research tree is a farce.
Equipment options are a joke.
No strategy need apply.
Base buildings are too limited to sustain the game, even if there were fixes.
Ships still move as if stuck in aspic.
Ships don't respond to attackers and the limited options for directing them don't.
Can't build more than one base per system, so no defense bases, research bases, which if there was a decent research tree would be interesting.  But no.
Resources per system are laughable.

2. Pacing. A large part of the the problem is it just feels so slow, the cheats in skirmish help some but it still feels sluggish.

3. Camera control. I don't how to spell this out, but it just needs some tweaking, maybe Right Click allows free-cam
