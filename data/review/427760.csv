For a game that's been out for almost 6 years at this point, you'd think that'd be enough time to address major game-breaking issues that several people have complained about. 

Not the case - there are so many clipping bugs that I had to restart entire chapters several times. I'd do things like use a crowbar to open a hatch, just for the hatch to spring open and trap the crowbar underneath the floorboards where it could no longer be accessed. At the end of one chapter, I got stuck in a wall which prevented a cutscene from triggering even after teleporting back inside. Another time I'd pick up a key and it would fall through my hand and through the floor. 

Light sources are required in order to progress through certain areas, and yet there were no instructions provided for Valve Index users in terms of their necessity or how to even turn them on (you have to press in the analog joystick).

The puzzles are not intuitive. It's mostly ""inspect everything until something scary appears out of nowhere."" At this point they don't really feel like ""puzzles"" to me.

The scary bits of this game mainly rely on jumpscares in dark areas, which I think is overdone here. It's fine in moderation, but it's another thing when it's your sole method for making a situation scary.

At first, the story seemed kind of interesting, expressed in what I assumed was metaphor or delusion. But then a sequence near the end of the game dumps a bunch of exposition on you that kills most of the mystery and somehow ends up being a lot less interesting than what the metaphors implied.

Not that the puzzles make really any sense. There's a little too much touch a random thing and something on the other end of the room will surreptitiously jiggle and fall down.

It's basically an escape the room game with a horror theme. The puzzles were mostly interesting, although some just made no sense, such as picking up an object to trigger the next part of a puzzle.  There were a few bugs, but nothing that prevented me from finishing the game.

This one is made by Wolf in the Woods who made another scary VR title called Exorcist: Legion. Haven't played that game yet, but I like being scared so I may get around to it. Hopefully they do the old bedsheet ghost coming out of nowhere thing...

 

Anyways....Being a big fan of horror games, do I recommend this game? I want to. I really do, but I just can't. It has great atmosphere, chilling sound design, but it just feels too abstract and unclear. Its one of those games where you kinda have to see the story in your head because you only get small glimpses of it in the game. I'm not a fan of this type of unreliable narrator stuff.

 

What is the game tho? Well your basically stuck at this mental institution and go through your memories as you can't remember shit. Did you kill your family? Did you kill yourself? are you a ghost? who knows. You walk through these scenes and solve very minor puzzles and then some creepy stuff happens or a ghost baby pops up in your face.

 

First the good:

As I already stated, the atmosphere and sound design are stellar. You really get sucked into these vignettes and forget your sitting in your moms basement alone on a Friday night again. You hear alot of dripping noises and the visuals are just dark enough that you don't see the jump scares coming. Just don't turn around cuz they always get you when your backs turned. Seriously though they did make me jump a couple times and I don't jump easily.

 

The bad:

The narrative. I've got to have a good narrative in my stories or games. This game unfortunately just throws a bunch of vague images that are scary, but really don't amount to alot. Yes, a child singing a nursery rhyme in a creepy voice is unnerving, but if I don't feel a connection to it, so what? Even when the story ends your left wondering what happened and they give you a newspaper to read basically telling you what happened because even though you experienced it, you don't know what the hell happened.

 

Overall I like what this game was trying to do and some of you may even like it's storytelling and how vague it is, but I just don't. This game's storytelling just didn't work for me so I couldn't connect with it. It kinda reminds me of one of those haunted house things you pay to walk through in October. You walk through these rooms and different things pop out at you. You jump, walk to the next room, repeat and 20 mins later your walking out and have already forgotten what happened, but still feel a lil jumpy.",1608421346,1608421346,False,3,0,0.526444315910339355,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Da steht man dann in seiner Zelle, weiß nicht warum und muss unlogische Rätsel lösen, z.B.: Nimm eine Origamifigur vom Regal, nimm ein Bild von der Wand und lege die Figur auf die Rückseite des Bildes an eine bestimmten Stelle... Dann wird alles schwummerig und man ist plötzlich in einem anderen Raum, wo man alles einmal anguckt und anfasst, bevor es in den nächsten Raum geht - dabei fehlt der Zusammenhang, fehlt ein motivierender Handlungsfaden und ohnehin alles, was Spaß macht - mehr als Sachen anfassen und angucken tut man nämlich nicht.

Schade, die Stimmung, die durch die ordentliche Grafik und Soundeffekte transportiert wird, ist gut.

• Viele verschiedene Räume
• Gelungene und packende Storyline
• Sounddesign sowie Grafikdesign tragen wesentlich zur Atmosphäre bei
• Einige Jumpscares, die VR nochmal viel reeler sind – vermutlich würden diese so am PC niemanden mehr schocken, 
 jedoch im VR ist es noch einmal ein ganz anderes Erlebnis
• angemessene Spiellänge

• Das Greifen von Gegenständen läuft eher suboptimal
• Oftmals wird man nicht an die gewünschte Stelle teleportiert oder komplett anders gedreht, so dass man sich eigentlich stetig selbst nach regulieren muss, was zusätzlich für Verwirrung sorgt
• Voiceacting war durchschnittlich – durch Hintergrundmusik manchmal etwas vernachlässigt und weniger gut zu verstehen

True room-scale VR games, that adapt to your Play Space, are few and far between, and this is probably the most popular and highly-rated of them all (yet). Sadly it is just not a good game. It is a series of spooky environments with 'escape room' type environmental puzzles, which are either entirely straightforward and obvious or entirely unintuitive/hidden and will require you to use the built-in hint feature (eg. when you have a key and the keyhole is tiny and near the ground in an entirely unusual place, that there is no other in-game direction towards).

It's pretty buggy in a variety of ways, but especially in things failing to trigger (or taking extremely long, random amounts of time to trigger), which can be especially bad when it's only apparent on repeated attempts. For this reason as well as seeming physics bugs, there were multiple major puzzles which just didn't work right the first time, at least once requiring reloading the scene. The way certain objects attach to your hand or even just behave in the world is very physics-glitchy and off-putting. The HMD:environment collision fade is too aggressive, several times getting in the way of close examination of the environment. The game repeatedly commits what should probably be recognized as a big sin (when running in adaptive room-scale mode) of putting objects you're supposed to react with directly at the borders of the play area, and tends not to do much with the majority of the volume in the center.

The story is a classic type of ambiguous paranoid psycho-thriller intrigue, presented and developed [i]excellently[/i] throughout the entire game - for the most part. The framing narrative interludes in your prison cell, where you are given the opportunity to re-read one old note selected from each completed level and to advance by guessing which bird statue to touch, are as goofy and pointless as that description makes them sound. It is intriguing enough to make you want to keep going (with enough little environmental storytelling hints to make it pretty clear what's happening), right up until it suddenly stops with a massive expository monologue and then a brief newspaper clipping.

This is one of the worst VR horror experiences I've had (and not in any good way), which I think is really telling. I'm not sure how well suited this style of slow, deliberate escape-room puzzle-solving is to horror. At no time in this game did I feel threatened, or like there was any possibility of failure (there isn't).

At the $12.50 sale price I got it for, I'm not exactly [i]pissed[/i], as I probably would have been getting it at full price. Same for my having played it post-'remaster', I can't imagine what it must have been like before if this is the 'remastered' version.

I completed the game in about 3 hours. This is a mystery thriller puzzle game with horror elements. The focus is on the story mystery, but puzzles are how you progress. Some of the puzzles were easy and logical, however, several of the puzzles were just obtuse. 

Luckily, there is a hint system which you can activate by pressing trigger and down on your joystick and you will see the clue on the back of your hand. I don't think I would have progressed very far without this hint system. The game has a weird trippy vibe to it. You can tell this is a predecessor to The Exorcist: Legion by these same devs. I would say the Exorcist is a more polished version of this game with higher production values, easier to follow story, and more logical puzzles. This game does not have the clearest vision, but at the end things are roughly put together.

What this game gets right is the atmosphere. There is a slow build up here. There were two jumpscares that really got me because both times they came unexpectedly and during tense moments. The music is also done very good. The voice acting was okay as well. You have varied locations and types of puzzles. 

I did experience one area that I had to restart three times because the event would not trigger (on the swan boat). You progress is saved as far as the chapter, but if you get stuck and restart you'll have to begin at the beginning for the chapter. Movement is either by free movement with smooth turning / snap turning or teleportation. I did have some pathing issues using free locomotion.

Overall, I did enjoy the experience but it was interlaced with some frustrating moments. I thought it was an uneven experience and was expecting better from all the positive reviews. Still, a solid puzzle mystery psychological thriller.

Rate 7/10.

It is a first and foremost a Puzzle game that just happens to have some light horror elements.
So I wouldnt say to buy this game on the idea that you are going to be scared a lot because you will not be.

The game starts off so well and is basically does by running straight out of the gate. The puzzles made sense and
were at the right difficulty to keep it moving forward. The little bits of story was also a nice drive to know more about what was going on. Unfortunately it did not take long for it all to go down hill and fast.

One portion had you sitting in a boat for 10 min or so was the start of the decline which is pretty much after the intro of the game. Puzzles became extremely difficult and confusing. While some where ""Oh I see what I did wrong"" others just felt like the game really lacked any sort of indication you were on the right track. Not saying I constantly need a hint but the game giving me feedback (like a portion where you used a combination lock to open a door and it would vibrate to let you know you got the right number which was a positive example) that you are even using the controls intended was really needed. But some just threw you into a room and there was no indication of what you should be doing at all.

So by the time I got to Chapter 4 or so I was just too frustrated with the puzzle I was on to even be scared anymore. I was just upset and not enjoying myself at all. Which is why I say its a Puzzle game and NOT a horror game. It does start as a horror game but it immediately drops it to be a puzzle game first and foremost. 

I do not feel this is a game worth what its priced now. So if you must try it out wait for a sale or if you like escape room type puzzles that just toss you in the deepend without really telling you how to swim then go for it. Just do not expect a very scary game.",1539535421,1539535421,False,3,0,0.526315808296203613,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich weiß nicht, ich weiß nicht.
Insgesamt eine durchwachsene VR-Erfahrung. Erst einmal dauert das Spiel in der Summe gefühlte 2h - wenn überhaupt und im direkten Vergleich für die 20 € ist ein Kinobesuch eindeutig mehr wert. Zumal die Spieldauer nur dadurch zustande kommt, dass man vergeblich versucht herauszufinden was das verdammte Spiel jetzt nun wieder von einem will. Zwar helfen die Handrücken-Tipps einem schon in gewisser Weise, aber so ganz bin ich nicht immer durchgestiegen was jetzt als Nächstes zu tun war oder hab nicht gerafft, dass ich bereits etwas auslöste. Trotzdem gibt es einige echt gelungene VR-Schockermomente (Flur, Badezimmer, Finale / Epilog), aber das sind seltene Highlights. Viel öfters ließ ich mich dazu hinreißen die Gruselstimmung zu sprengen, indem ich den Diskofinger schwang, mit den Händen wilde Luftfaustkämpfe ausfechtete oder eben Wild-Wild-West spielte... die Story plätschert so vor sich her, die Grafik ist so lala und das Spiel spürbar nur von einer Person entwickelt. Es hat schon ein paar geniale Szenen, aber insgesamt wirkt es ein wenig konstruiert und langgezogen. Ein stimmiger Guss sieht anders aus...

Viele meiner Freunde waren nach anfänglicher [i]""Uuuuuuuuuuuuuh, ein VR Spiel - was muss er denn jetzt machen?""[/i]-Euphorie stark gelangweilt und auch das Zuschauen eines Kumpels konnte ihn nicht ausreichend lange begeistern. Auch ich zeigte als VR-Demo lieber SUPERHOT VR und ließ ""A Chair in a Room"" lieber stecken. Sagt im Prinzip schon alles....

Really great pacing balancing out the scary moments with some down time. For me by far the best example of this was chapter 4, where the chapter opens up without any immediate scares or threats, but as you begin to figure out the puzzle in the room you start to get a sense that things are a bit more sinister than they seem. Then in the second room things get overtly spooky, with an opressive atmosphere so well done that I was totally huddled up in the middle of the room sweating porfusely taking several minutes before ever turning around cause it was just 2spooky. Then right when this dread reaches its crescendo you get some downtime in a room without any scares and even a nice little reference to The Shining to bring the mood up a little. The entirety of the game does a good job balancing out tension like this, where moments of extreme dread are always preceded and followed by some preperation and downtime. 

Story wise the story is good, but not particularly amazing; it's kind of annoying that nothing really clicks until the big reveal, but then again Silent Hill 2 used a similar structure and its my all time favorite piece of media. I think the only real downside with this game's use of that kind of structure is that after the big reveal, if you go back and think of all the stuff in the game, everything has some sort of narrative significance but aside from a few obvious Milton references, most objects lack a symbolic significance. Whereas in SH2 after you know the plot, absolutely everything not only has relevance to Jame's story, but also heavily relates to real world toxic masculinity and sexual frustration. ACIAR's revelations extend mostly only to in-game world.

Overall the game is a very solid little horror title and I am glad I played it. Really all my criticism is just nit-picking and the game is already very very good and intelligently made compared to most horror media.

We played it as a family, everyone switching out one per level. Made all of us really freaked out and nobody was racing to get back in because of the oppressive dread from the game's soundtrack.

Not to mention that it's one of the few games to use ROOMSCALE. They put the whole game in your playspace, effectively, so you really feel like you're standing there in a real room. It's much scarier to have to physically step forward into an eerie place than to artifically locomote there so that's a huge plus and a VERY unique feature of this game which I don't think I've seen any other game really try and pull off in this way.

I wouldn't say anything more than what the description tells to not give anything away. The game ran well and the graphics were fine (could have been clearer in some places). This is not a hard core horror game but more a investigative psych thriller. It does have some jump scare moments but that is not the highlight of the game. The fact that it has a story and flows to a conclusion would be the reason to like this title. Great job Wolf and Wood. I was skeptical of this but in the end I was very pleased. I am terrible at puzzle games but managed to make it through this. There is a walkthrough in the guide section so if you are not a puzzle person like me juse that to get through and enjoy the game. But gratefully the game gives you enough clues to help you move along. Most people shouldn't have a problem. The only thing I found a little annoying was holding the flashlights, blacklights and lighters. You have to keep your hand on the trigger or it will drop. My fingers were getting very tired when taking long to tread through some rooms. That was the only real negative.

I did play this on VIVE with motion controllers so the experience was very immersive for sure. This was a well thought out game. My first play through took 3.2 hours which is what my Steam playtime says. My overall score is a 9/10. Great game.

First play finished. Live play re-run. YouTube may have cut it off at 2hrs. Sorry. Enjoy.

Ride some weird boat into a swamp the graphics were just white everywhere couldn't see anything to be afraid of!! I debated on just returning the game, even though it was on sale cheap, and being done with it. But I decided to play on and went into the next couple chapters....and WOW!!! This game ended up scaring the SHIT out of me!! At one point I literally yanked the headset off and yelled out loud!! hahaha.....so I have changed my mind! My initial impression was not good...but it certainly is good now!!

Die Geschichte spielt in einem Sanitorium im Süden der USA. Der Protagonist versucht herauszufinden, was ihm widerfahrten ist und warum. Aber ich will jetzt gar nicht lange auf die sehr gute Geschichte eingehen, denn das Ende kenne ich leider nicht.

Die Grafik ist hochauflösend und detailreich. Das Spiel leider allerdings unter vielen Glitches, oft versinken Gegenstände in Möbeln o.ä. und man muß dann in die Oberflächen greifen, um das gewünschte Objekt wieder an Tageslicht zu befördern.
Die Lokomotion funktioniert super und ist mit Teleport kombiniert, sodaß man überall hingehen kann. 
(Bis auf eine Stelle in einem Boot, an der ich schon vor meinem vorzeitigem Ende fast verzweifelt wäre. Aber mit Biegen und Brechen - meinerseits, konnte ich dann doch das Gewünschte erreichen)

Damit bin ich auch schon an meinem persönlichem Minuspunkt. 
Im 5. Kapitel muß man ein Vorhängeschloß mit einem Zahlendrehkranz öffnen. Ich habe die korrekte Kombination. Es gibt bei der ersten Ziffer ein eindeutiges Geräusch, daß etwas eingerastet ist. Bei den anderen beiden Ziffern gibt es dieses Geräuch nicht. Manchmal ist ganz leise etwas zu vernehmen, aber das sind nur Hintergrundgeräuche, wie ich dann irgendwann herraushörte. 
 Ich habe mir schon das Video des Entwickler angesehen, wo genau dieses Problem behandelt wird. Ohne Ton! Das Video ist ohne Ton. Das hilft mir nicht.
 Ich greife das Schloß korrekt, ich benutze die Drehscheibe korrekt. linksrum, rechtsrum. Umgekehrt. In einer kontinuierlichen Bewegung, mal so, das ich zwischen den Ziffern pausiere. Nichts! Das Schloß geht nicht auf! Entweder bin ich zu blöd! Oder ich habe einen echt doofen bug!

 Evtl. weiß hier ja jemand Rat....

Das Interessanteste an A Chair in a Room ist das Roomscale. Die komplette Spielfläche wird genutzt und der Raum passt sich perfekt an, wirklich bemerkenswert.

Die Grafik ist in Ordnung, wenn auch nicht überragend. Zu mindest läuft es flüssig (GTX 970, i5). 
Ab und an ist die Steuerung nicht ganz ideal, vor allem direkt am Anfang beim Ballspiel brauchte ich mehrere Versuche bis es klappte.
Doch wenn man sich mit den kleinen Schwächen arangiert erwartet einen eine interessante Erfahrung. Gespickt mit ein paar Jumpscares rätselt man sich durch verschiedene Räume und erfährt nach und nach den Hintergrund der Story.
Die Rätsel sind vom Schwierigkeitsgrad nicht übermäßig Anspruchsvoll, die Story selbst auf jeden Fall interessant. Mit einer Spielzeit von etwas über 3 Stunden (sicher schaffen es Leute schneller, manch einer wird auch länger brauchen) auf jeden fall eine längere Erfahrung, kann man bei dem Preis aber auch erwarten.

Das Spiel ist vielelicht nicht für jeden etwas, aber mir hat es spaß gemacht, von daher eine eingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung.

The environments are very well done, and if you have a big room, you'll enjoy the room scale.  I have a small space, but it was still plenty enjoyable and i felt fully immersed.  The settings are all very artistically done and set moods very well.

The scares..... Scary moments are 10x worse in VR.  It's one thing to see it on a monitor, but another thing to be ""in"" the play space and have it all happen around you.  The dev did a great job ""prepping"" you for scares or non-scares, and by the end of it, you absolutely dread hearing some of the sound effects.

The puzzles and progression are pretty straight forward.  I got a little stuck a couple of times, but it was usually because I wasn't paying enough attention to details.  

It looks like it took me about 3 hours to beat.... over the course of several weeks because I just can't play it for long before having to get my heart rate under control.  It felt like more than the time spent, and that's a good thing.  You will have to be the judge of what price works for you on that amount of time.

Overall, great VR experience, and a good recommend if you are ok with shitting yourself a few times.

Story is absolutely amazing, down to the very end. R rated for sure, I wouldn't recommend this game for kids.

At just about any price, this game is a steal. I'm super cheap, trust me, I likes me my money.

At $60 the story is a little short (5-6 hours or so), but the experience of being ""in the game"" with vr makes it sooo worth it.

The gameplay is pretty basic, but I had a lot of trouble with some stuff like grabbing items, opening doors, etc. as the game just wouldn't allow me to do that. I also experienced a bug that wouldn't allow me to proceed at one point and I had to replay some parts, which reminds me of another problem with this sort of a game.

The game has events that trigger based on when you do stuff / time goes past. This means that you don't really want to replay this as you basically have to touch every item and then wait for something to happen so that you can proceed. I didn't have to replay a lot, but it was rather annoying anyway.

This game is great. You feel on edge at all times. Granted I've only made it to Chapter 4 so far, but there have been some intense moments so far. 

I've played Dreadhalls, Emily wants to play, Affected, etc. This game is a whole new kind of horror. In all those games listed you are expected to get scared, you just know it.

I love this game, it is so immersive you forget you are in VR for a little bit. They do Roomscale real nice in this game, so if you have a good room, you'll love it. You can also teleport as well for those of you who only have standing room.

Both have been a revelation, yet containing so many flaws ([i]Greenwater[/i] especially) that I struggle to give either of them a strong recommendation. Nevertheless, here I am recommending this game, and not just to reward the developers for taking a big risk in a new artistic medium.

This game's strongest and weakest points demonstrate what can be most challenging and most rewarding in virtual reality game design. First, room-scale VR can do horror like nothing else. Most horror movies and videogames bore me or even put me to sleep. But [i]Greenwater[/i] puts you in small, claustrophobic rooms roughly the same size as your physical play space. Unlike in [i]The Gallery[/i], there are no blurry far away objects or textures and no need for potentially immersion-breaking locomotion systems. Everything is right in front of you and within physical walking distance.

This also means that whatever is going to scare you, and you just [i]know[/i] something is coming, it's going to be very close, and running is impossible both in the real and the virtual world. There were some parts of the game where I had to just stop and come back to it later because the suspense was driving me as mad and paranoid as the character you play. I found out after this happened a few times that this only makes the game [i]more suspenseful[/i]; it's better to just keep pushing forward.

There are times when you need to move to a different room, and as long as the door is unlocked, you just press your trigger on the doorknob, and your virtual body fades out of one room and into the next. It's so simple, and works beautifully. Future VR game designers should take note of the techniques used here; mere level design could solve many of the locomotion questions that are still being asked about VR games.

Second, fear seems to make it easier to achieve presence, but wonky unrealistic physics destroys it, at least in games that aren't set in fantasy/scifi worlds. And this game's physics system is deeply awful. Even just picking things up, like the titular chair in a room, feels wrong and awkward the way it swings in your hand. When you pick up pills and put them in a mug, they sometimes fall through the mug. Drawers hardly ever shut perfectly, which is excruciating to me. It feels even wonkier than the buggy physics in Surgeon Simulator games.

This game is basically an elaborate escape-the-room, so having such broken physics occasionally feels like a deal-breaker when your progress depends on manipulation of objects. Perhaps this is good for some people, as it will add some comic relief to a game that would otherwise be so frighteningly suspenseful it would simply be unbearable. But I would rather not be shifting in and out of presence all the time.

The actual story and horror elements in the game are really rather shallow, depending almost entirely on the creepy setting, music (that always seems to be [i]judging[/i] you), lighting, and occasional psychotic visions than on interesting characters. But it all works really, really well in this game, because you are playing a psychotic character. You feel it from the moment the game starts, that your mind is unstable and your perception of the world is unreliable, and that you are always being watched and scrutinized by the mental instutition you're trapped in. In spite of the disastrous physics system, this has been one of the most immersive gaming experiences of my life.

I'm not normally a fan of horror games, honestly, they tend to bore me more than anything. The only one I've ever really enjoyed is Alien Isolation and that's only really because of my love for the source material and admiration for the world they built. But this game... holy fuck.

A friend of mine urged me to try it and I was admittedly curious to see how VR would change my perception of the genre and let me tell you... it changed it. And how.

I started the little small level you can access via the photograph of the girl on the door in the waiting room and then began playing like I always do in these games, somewhat non-nonchalantly trying to faff about whilst progressing to relieve the tension a little. But it really started to get to me. The atmosphere, the sense of presence, the use of roomscale... it all merged together to make a truly unnerving experience that now has me sitting curled up in my chair, lights on full brightness, still alert to subtle noises around the house.

If you were ever in any doubt about VRs ability to transform how you think about games... play this. If you don't normally get along with horror games and want something fresh... play this. If you have some cash going spare... play this. Now if you'll excuse me... I'm going to go make sure the doors to my house are all locked.",1482979527,1493220083,True,2,1,0.548387110233306885,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played this for about 15 minutes and couldn't take it anymore. Stupid. Just looking around in a room picking shit up.  The a big long loading time to the next screen to get bored out of your mind again. The people/programmers that make these games are neither intelligent or creative. I'd have more fun playing on a 8 bit Nintendo. Now that had some FUN games. Not just ""oh look i actually like picked up a pencil in real life and stuff & stuff"" 

I've played all the top rated games and they all stink w the ""I can see the potential"" factor. Lonbow in the Lab is pretty good but it gets very repititious fast and lacks any depth. 

I must say, it's the first time I've played any gaming or any system where everything just stinks. This one also just so happens to cost $800 plus a high end computer. I shot the works on a $3500 Alienware Area 51 thinking, ""Man this is going to be the ultimate!"" Ha, what a joke this turned out to be. 

I'm looking forward to the TPcast wireless adaptor but without any good experiences/games that would just be another waste of money. By the time they come out with anything good on this they'll probably have a new system released. 

IF ANYONE FROM VIVE OR STEAM IS LISTENING, INVEST IN GREAT FULL FEATURED AAA GAMES AND EXPERIENCES. Right now this whole thing sucks!!!! 

Also just wanted to mention that the Steam store is also a big mixed up convoluted mess. It's hard to find anything and you end up clicking around for 10 minutes before your intended purpose. The the reviews. ""Somewhat Positive, Very Positive, Overwhelmingly Positive"" etc etc. Where's the star rating system that works so well for everyone/everything else in the world??? There's no middle ground, i.e., for example 3 of 5 stars on here is equivelant to another Positive and normally someone could clearly see the game is just average at best or junk and yet got a positive review.  

Good tactics but tactics like that don't last forever. 

The Playstation VR although not that great either, but if I had to choose one over the other it would be the PS4. At least in it's infancy has had a few games that are very fun. Can't say that for this system.

I didn't notice glitches like some reviews have stated, however I did wait for feedback in the controls before picking up objects. It's not a fast paced game so take your time and I think you will have the same glitch free experience.

If ever there was an example of how to take a new medium and use it effectively, this game is it.

I dont want to spoiler it too much, you basically have ""levels"" where you have to conform, or perform a set of tasks before you can continue.

It's an absolutely amazing Virtual Reality experience, one that, if you let yourself get into it and let go of your inhibitions - can be mind blowing.

I decided I wouldn't take the pills ..... Then 10 minutes later, curled in a ball on the floor in my living room - or , curled in a ball on the asylum floor.  The pill I'd so confidently dropped from my hand, determined not to swallow - just an inch away, I could take it no longer, the loss of vision , the tinitus - I learned my limit and took the damn pill.

This game, is a mild puzzler but a massive head game . 10/10 - among the best of YEAR 1 with the HTC VIVE. 

Added after playing the free DLC ""missing girl"" - really good DLC , pushes the concept of ""the visitor"" to a whole new level - brilliant. !


PROS:
Great Graphics and use of sound effects.
Excellent use of Room Scale (really is perfect if you have 2.5 , otherwise it uses Lab style teleportation which works well)
Story / Feeling of immersiveness is incredible, just let yourself go.

CONS:
Just want more - 3 hours played all in , a perfect 3 hours and I will definately return, but I'd love to see some more DLC incoming.",1479954456,1480121585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What is very well done is how the game tries to scare you, very few jump scares but it's always kinda kreepy in the rooms. 
And IF there are jump scares, they don't ""jump"" you in a literal way like say the FNAF monsters. That's a very important thing in VR because when that happens most games shake the screen wich would (to most players i guess) give you motion sickness in VR. 

So special probs to the devs for taking care of their players while still scaring them.

The price tag might be a liiiiitle high with 22,99€, but it is a well done game with little to no shortcomings. I can still recommend it. If you see this in a sale it's a must buy for your Vive.

I wish there was some way to rewind and play again without knowing what I know now, to re-experience from beginning to end.  I'm happy knowing that more like this will come.

I don't think a horror game or movie has ever scared me as much as this game did.  As a 27 y/o adult, nothing really scares me (unless it is something dangerous with realistic consequences), but this game gave me genuine anxiety.  I've never had goosebumps so bad that all my hairs stood up until this game.  I screamed out loud several times playing this.  It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, but I don't regret buying it all as it provided a very immersive, emotional experience.  I was sometimes too scared to even start the game, but I was determined to complete it.  It does not rely on jump scares, it is much more genuine and the story itself is scary.  There are parts where I just froze and was too scared to move or do anything.  While I recommend this to most, I can't say it's for everyone.  The puzzles are challenging, and if you don't have patience, focus, attention to detail, and problem solving skills, then this is not for you.  My wife could not get past the first level because she got frustrated from not knowing what to do and would give up too easily.  You end up getting stuck in a room and if you don't figure out what to do you could get stuck there for a while.  You build a relationship with the room and you start to feel trapped, which for me added to the creepiness and immersion-level of the game.  As a gamer I enjoyed the challenge and the determination to continue paid off.  If you are a gamer who has the patience for puzzle games and wants to get scared, this game is for you.  If you want to scare your friends, I recommend beating the game yourself first so you have all the levels available, then just throwing them into a scary part of the game where they don't have a whole lot to have to figure out, and the scares start right away.

Trying to understand the story as you progress through the game worked great and helped you become more immersed in the enviroment. Towards the end of the game you get a stronger boost of courage as you better understand your role in the story and the characters in it.

It suits it's self really well for being in VR. Needing to face the horrors before you can progress was great and something that can't be replicated in as great a degree as in other medias, including non-VR games. Those (sometimes random) sound cues and moments where you know you have to peer around a corner...

$25 may seem like a lot, but it's comparable to watching 2 movies in the States. I would say the cost is fair, but being it's on Steam you could probably wait and get it on sale if it's a concern.

There is not much replay value in this game. I doubt I would play this game again. I also probably won't have any guests playing this just because of the time they would need to invest to fully realize the best parts of this game.

Needless to say, as soon as the first ""scare"" happened I had to spend a few minutes staring at the virtual wall wondering if I should continue...or even turn around again. Horror in VR is a very different beast compared to watching it on a 2D screen. I stopped for the night.

Next day, I steeled my mind and continued, with the actual story this time. Slow start, but boy does it rake in the chill factor.

My main criticism is that the story runs out of steam toward the end. It didn't wrap up in a natural and immersive way.

My only complaints I really have would be about a little bit of bugginess in the adventure game ""Bring Me These Things"" part towards the end, as I was a bit lost as to what the transitionary part of the experience was, and therefore I backtracked into another room where a character repeated old dialogue. 
I also felt the end came pretty quick around the climax, and I expected more escalation just before it. 

And if there was another game with a southern gothic atmosphere, I'd like to see it explored in much more depth to the ""supernatural"" side of it, as it was hinted at to some degree.

What I like the most is the use of roomscale and the game having a story. The puzzles while not being super obvious are good and I've had to check the clue option a few times. 

I have not being scared as of yet being only upto chapter 3. But the atmosphere has my skin crawling and that cold grasp on the back of my neck a few times. 

Only complaints is it took me a few times to realise the options and load games was on posters in the first room. I had started from beginning a few times before that. 

The game runs smooth on my R9 390x with a i5 6600k both OC'ed. I will update review when I'm all the way through the game.

Masterfully done, the game uses ambiance and sound to provide a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, as well as to create a truly immersive experience. Turn the chaperone grid to developer (so it just shows the floor) and you have an experience you'll forget is a game!

The story is equally good, with a small but superbly done cast, solid voice acting, and some very convincing animation (I'm not sure if motion capture was used, but it doesn't matter, the result is very realistic).

The puzzles are not too hard, and the controls are pretty intuitive. I only had to look for help on solving two puzzles, and one of them was just how to operate a locking mechanism. Everything else I was able to figure out by logic or trial and error.

[MINOR SPOILERS COMING]

Now for the scares, because that's why we buy horror games. The scares are GOOD without being overdone or overtly cheap. There were only two moments where I actually screamed out loud, but they were masterfully done. If you scare easily, you will be creeped out by this game. If you don't scare easily, you'll still be tense while playing. That is the hallmark of good psychological horror--even the bravest people will feel the suspense. Now I did say that this game doesn't rely on jump scares, but it has one that will get you. I won't spoil where it is in the game, but it is completely appropriate given the context. Yes, it is one of the times I screamed out loud.

More on the story and how it's told... and this is the only sin the game commits. You have to be TOLD the real story at the end, which is drawn out a bit too long, instead of SHOWN the story throughout the game. I didn't like having to have things explained to me, I should have been able to put it together from the clues. I get why the creators did it, I just don't agree. But when you take in the entire game as a whole, this is quite forgivable.

If you get scared easily and are wondering if you can actually handle the game, without spoiling anything, I will say that there are some spooky moments that can really creep you out, but nothing that was far too scary for me to progress. 

The story itself was pretty good and definitely didn't go where I thought it was going. The puzzles and such were all pretty cool and par for the course from other 'escape the room' games that I've played. There were none that I encountered that I couldn't find out on my own, though that's not to say I never used the built-in hand hint system and there were a few moments when it tool me a little over a couple minutes to figure out exactly what I was to do. 

I really liked how they gave instructions on using gear in the game. Putting the instructions in text on objects in the game was really, really cool. Borderline on a spoiler maybe, but I also really liked how they took full advantage over a player's looking direction. 

My biggest issue with the game was with the play area, though it's not all the game's fault. I have small parts of my Chaperone area drawn in a way that includes parts of my couch and recliner, since they are so low to the ground, they have never gotten in the way of RPG or FPS style games. In this game though, there's a lot of reaching and grabbing that takes place low to the ground, and that made things problematic. Luckily, I was able to push down enough on cushions or squeeze between cushions to reach low places, so it never stopped me from beating the game, but it came very close to me having to pause the game, take my headset off, and moving my couch out of the room. My space isn't small, but I just wanted to get as much as I could. Despite that, and this is where I do fault the game, it placed a small number of things actually outside of my Chaperone space, but luckily this was just space above more couches, so I just leaned over the couches to access these places in-game, but some people may actually have a wall or something that they cannot get through or passed.

So, if you want to play this, it's not crazy scary but has some spooky moments, you better have a large area relative to what other games require, and if you have cheated your Chaperone space then you might want to make sure you haven't cheated it too much.  All in all, I really enjoyed the game and had fun getting spooked. Getting scared in VR is quite exciting and A Chair in a Room has only increased my anticipations of future horror games in VR.

* If you're looking for an atmospheric horror game that makes you solve obscure puzzles while slowly creeping under your skin. (Partially correct, see my edit att the bottom!)
* It has more variety than most other early VR titles... combined. That says more about other VR titles than this, though.
* It's very immersive if you have the space for full VR room scale.

REASONS TO AVOID:
* If you have small space. I have 2.5x2.9 square meters and it's working great, but much smaller would probably not.
* If you are impatient and don't like obscure far-fetched puzzles. This game has them. They are far fetched. Sometimes you just end up trying everything with everything. I'm a pretty clever dude and I almost gave up early on. 
* If money matters to you. As an indie title with low quality assets, it's really worth maybe 10 euros, not 20+. It's overpriced because it's VR, and VR makes everything look shiny.

Minor annoyances that don't really matter:
* Game physics could be better. Objects behave like they have no mass.
* Loading screens could be smoother. Sometimes your ""hands"" disappear and you see default controllers while loading.

-- Edit: August 7, 2016. After playing some more, I have this to add:

Avoid this if you don't handle jump scares well and want to finish the game. At a certain point in the narrative the atmospheric sense of dread and tension becomes a predictable jump scare formula. To me, the whole point with fear in a game is that you can overcome it, force yourself to move forward. But that point is lost if you're certain that there's an unavoidable jump scare ahead. The game makes you look really hard at something and, predictably, startles you with a loud noise and something ugly out of nowhere right in your face. In VR it's not ""fun scary"", it's just painful and pointless and punishing.

In my opinion, as an early VR horror game experiment, it's a failure. It doesn't matter how polished parts of a game are if it ultimately fails to make me want to play it until the end. But I still recommend trying this game because it's an honest effort and some people maybe enjoy being punished for overcoming fear.",1470000553,1470562809,True,10,1,0.601446151733398438,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has taken thrillers and horror games to the next level times 10. Do you remember playing F.E.A.R. for the first time thinking ""THIS IS THE NEXT LEVEL""? This game makes FEAR look like a joke. The polish on the atmosphere is insanely well done. So many times I had chills and heavy breathing because of the anticipation. 

This game also serves well as a VR demo and party game. Hear me out on this. The beginning of the game is not that scary, it's just tense. It does a great job showing off the feeling of presence in VR. Secondly, if you have a bunch of friends around, it can make it easier to get through the really scary parts and also you guys can hot swap in when someone ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""s out of the game. The game is only 3-5 hours long, so savor the moments and spread this game out over a few days. Yes there are some ""jump"" scares, but it's not the traditional jump scare you would think of. It's more like, you didn't expect something to be there. 

PROS:
-very atmospheric
-great voice acting
-will scare even the people who don't normally get scared
-works well for a VR demo and also as a party game

CONS:
-it'll ruin all other ""scary experiences"" as child's play compared to this
-Some bugs are kind of annoying due to room sizing issues and puzzle bugs (i'll explain more below)
-Floor calibration issues seemed particularly bad in this game, but didn't ruin the experience

SUMMARY:
If you own the VIVE and can at least tolerate somewhat tense/scary situations, this game is a must. Nothing compares to it.

Bugs/issues I found:

A few times the room scale and positioning was way off. I freshly calibrated the room in the Steam VR setup multiple times and it still forced us to spawn inside of walls or had to break past the chaperone boundaries in order to reach a critical point. Teleporting sometimes would break or turn off in the middle of a level and we were then stuck. The floor would often be off by a few inches. Nothing game breaking, but still frustrating that this game only seemed to have that issue compared to other VR games I played with on the same steam room setup.

I can't stress enough how under-appreciated and under-represented Chair in a Room is on Steam and in HTC's own marketing for the Vive. I know it's become kind of in vogue to claim that a VR game isn't getting enough love, but this is one title that REALLY (in my opinion) needs to be in everyone's Steam library.

While playing, I couldn't get over the persistent feeling that the game felt like it was breaking first ground for what room-scale horror is going to look like in the next five or ten years. ""I'll bet this is what people thought of Alone in the Dark,"" I thought to myself. And really, the comparison doesn't stop at the positives. AitD had an absolutely atrocious and clunky movement system, and everything felt like it was moving in slow-motion. Similarly, Chair in a Room's object-interaction system leaves a lot to be desired. It's very immersion-breaking to pick up a bucket with an object in it, only to watch that object clip through the bottom of the container and fall to the floor. I won't spoil things, but there's a scene in which you're required to use the Vive's trackpad to dial in the numbers on a combination lock. I'm not even sure how I ended up getting it open. Even with the numbers in hand, I had trouble controlling the precision of my selection.

And yet, the game scared me to death, over and over again. I haven't been this terrified since playing the original ""F.E.A.R."" on my college room mate's laptop back in 2005. Each and every scene is oozing with atmosphere and dread. And the jump scares are punctuated very effectively with the game's sound design.

By the end of Chair in a Room, I was scared to look at ANYTHING for fear that it would trigger another terrifying episode. And yet the developers did such a phenomenal job of guiding the player into those scares organically. The end became a little too expository, but (as with Alone in the Dark), I feel like the story was secondary to the raw, visceral moments of terror that lay within it.

Get the game. I truly believe this is the best horror title that can be experienced in the Vive right now.",1469426872,1469426872,True,4,0,0.530377626419067383,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Also, try to get the 2.5 by 2.5 meter play space so that you don’t have to rely on teleporting around. I did this halfway through the game by extending by chaperone boundaries on one side by 6 inches over my desk (there isn’t any point where you’re swinging your arms so no risk of damaging your controllers really). Also, turn off chaperone boundaries for a truly immersive experience (if you are at the 2.5 x 2.5 meter) since the game scales the rooms to be within these boundaries anyways.

Atmospherically, and in terms of Art Direction, this game is simply one of the best I have played in VR.

It is absolutely terrifying, but in the most thougtful way possible. The frightening aspect is generated all through ambience and without giving anything away; there are [i]some[/i] jump scares, but they're far from 'cheap' jump-scares that flash in your face without rhyme or reason, and are all very tastefully done.

My only complaint about this game, is in terms of the design. Sometimes the game struggles in defining the rules of interaction, which aren't always very clear.
For example, in some scenarios, it takes a lot of trial and error to discover what is an interactive element, and not just set-dressing.
As someone who was completely engrossed in the storyline, it got a bit frustrating to have to mindlessly canvas an entire room for long amounts of time, only to find a solution, that I would have never even remotely guessed was the way to proceed forward.

With that in mind, if you pick this up, and happen to get stuck at some point for the reasons above, I wouldn't shy away from looking up an online guide to help move forward in the game so that you can continue enjoying what is a truly fantastic VR experience.",1467860072,1493781273,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The main premise of the game is that the player travels from location to location and have to solve simple environmental puzzles to proceed to the next area. If the current location is too big for your VR space you can use a teleporting mechanic to move around. A chair in a Room is a fairly short experience of about 2 to 3 hours depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles.

At first I really didn't like the game. The teleporting mechanic feels clunky, the 3d models are of fairly low quality and the game in general lacks polish... yet despite this I found myself completely immersed in the game in a way I have never felt before. It was like playing out a real life horror movie. A low-budget horror movie but with a solid story behind it.

Like many VR games it's rather short (I finished it in just above 3 hours) and quite expensive considering the short amount of time you're likely to spend with it (currently 22.99€). But considering the relatively small audience for room scale VR games at the moment, I guess the games come at a premium.

But if the price is not an issue, you get one of the most immersive and complete ""mature"" room-scale VR games available. The game will creep you out at points, and scary stuff in VR -is- another level than scary stuff on your PC monitor, so you must be able to handle it. The immersion is so effective, in some scenes my thumb was hovering over the steam-menu button as an ""emergency exit"" option, scared that something could happen that would really freak me out and fry my brain or something.  :D
Obviously this game is not for everybody, but if you are used to horror games, it's nothing really too bad.

The game has a nice variety of scenes and a satisfying ending. Sometimes it manages to be fun in a way that is not central to the game, as you can fool around with some of the more playful items in some of the scenes (building blocks!). 

The one thing I didn't like so much is that it relies a bit too much on music and sound effects to put the player into a scary mood, especially towards the end. Of course music is a very effective means for this sort of thing, but towards the end I was getting a little tired of the usual sound cues (they were even starting to hurt my ears a bit, as there is a lot of ""beeping""). I wish they would have made more with visuals instead of relying so much on the sound design.

Yes ""most of the time"" there are 1 or 2 jump scares which you can see coming, which is a little unfortunate.

Overall the game is not pure Horror all the time, it also has some relaxing moments and then throws you in the next nightmarish situation. 

The game makes good use of room scale (but also offers teleportation locomotion). I love the room changing concept and also some other concepts like the lighter or the lock.

It still has some bugs, though. I got stuck once, but the developer is working on fixing everything that gets reported.

23€ for about 3 hours might sound expensive, but it's 3 great hours and to my mind it's totally worth it. (Specially compared to other vive games for similiar prices). This game is the first vive game that offered me an interesting story that I actually cared about.

Firstly, the art and music direction is incredible. This game was very well made and looks great when in the headset. The music really sets the mood and makes everything amazing. 

The gameplay and puzzle solving was not bad. There might be some glitches here and there, but it's a very immersive experience and very fun to play. Although it may not be too immersive when playing with a group of friends yelling at the player to help them with the puzzle sovling, but still totally works as a fun game. 

The story overall is a little intense and diffiicult to understand but intriguing and fun to figure out. Every second keeps you moving forward.

The ""scare"" factor in this game, in my opionion, is ideal. Sure it's not one of those super scary games a lot of people like, but with the story and gameplay it offers, the simple scares it does have are perfect. the immersion in VR makes the simple scares even better. 

Overall this game was a great first VR game purchase and money well spent. The devs did a great job using the Room Scale factor and I honestly didn't even use the teleport moving tool when I first played the game. Moving around feels great and real.

Pros:

[*] Great use of room scale
[*] Sounds silly, but the way you change rooms works really well.  Assuming you're at the bounds of your space when you enter a door, you will start the next room facing the door so the new room is in your playspace.
[*] Brilliant atmospheric music
[*] Full spacial audio is amazing

[*] Great pace to the game, not too fast, not too slow

Well, there's no escaping the creepy **** that pops out to spook you in VR.  You turn around and it's just [i]there[/i].  

Greenwater uses your own psyche against you. Luring you into it's depths with a bit of mystery, really grasping your full attention...And then right when you least expect it, pulls the rug out from under you and reminds you of the kind of heck you agreed to enter when you put the headset on.  

Mechanically, there are a number of relatively simple puzzles that mostly rely on logic and modest observation skills.  It's never particularly difficult, but does expect you to make note of your surroundings and check out things that might seem hidden at first.

The game makes brilliant use of roomscale environment. Recommended is 2.5x2.5m to play without any need for teleporting (I played with ~3.5x3m).  You simply walk around your room which the game environment is appropriately sized to match and give you freedom explore intuitively and incredibly immersively.  Which you want, because the more convinced that you're really there, the stronger the sense of absolute dread and despair when things start to get spooky.


Personally, shooting zombies and chopping up enemies in the dark hasn't really ""spooked"" me in VR---I feel like a badass in those when I can fight back.

This is what I am looking for.  I am a big fan of the scare, creep, unsettling type of games.  When I got the Vive I would thing to myself, ""This would be a great platform for survival horror, overall story telling with a fear filled bend to it.""

This has arrived.  This is the first to come along for me and with this quality title so soon in the lifecycle of VR I CANNOT WAIT to see what is in store for the future.

The sound, environments, story, and perfect placement of things that simply either creep you out, unsettle you, or straight up make you scream is superb.  It does not beat you over the head with constant thing jumping in your face or anything like that.  The creators of this game know the value of subtle well placed situations to make you tense and crazed.

I cannot reveal anything about the story.  This is a game that is played once for the enjoyment.  If you play with others in your cadre of friends or family, make sure the no one is with you unless they have gotten farther than you.  To have the secrets and events spoiled by telling you would be a great disservice.

The environments are top notch, the shine/grime/texture/lighting of surfaces are the best I have seen on the platform.  I did not have the game when a lot of people complained about the controls.  I got the game about a week ago and feel that the controls are good.  Sometime there are funny things with manipulating items but nothing resembles what people complained about when the game was first released.  I think the last update ironed anything that was troublesome out.

You like to feel tense, scared, trapped, intrigued?  This is the game for you.  I can say hands down this is a top title for me.  And as I mentioned before, this is just the beginning, you know it is going to get even more amazing than this as time goes on. 

I would not hesitate to get any title from these folks.

I started playing this, and almost 3 hours later finished it with a giant grin on my dial.  

I feel its the only game that uses room-scale amazingly well, as in on a whole other level.  It uses the entire play area.  As my room was larger than 2.5m x 2.5m you dont teleport.. you literally walk everywhere and that brings an immersion like nothing else!  Far more games should do this.  At one point I was leaning on my physical wall which perfectly matched the VR wall, peering through a VR window.. mind. blown.  Quite scary in parts too, and mature content within it..  A game not for your 4 year old, or perhaps even some adults.

I mean, the first minute was on point. This world is dark, it is too real even if the ""grhafux"" aren't that good (Animations are just reduced to making objects slide or vibrate. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )). It is too small for me to ever feel safe. This world is disturbing. And since it is VR, I'm in this world. The immersion is total, when everything goes right. My room was missing like 20cm to fit in for the game, so it was a struggle of learning how to open real world doors to reach for virtual pills to progress from virtual rooms to virtual rooms. I had to do the first half of the game like this, until they patched in a teleport mode. Though honestly the real room scale mode made me feel way more immersed and helpless into these unknown places. I've never felt that trapped before to be honest


So then first 10 minutes, I dive into the story. This is pretty cool, a murder, mental illness, a psychiatric yard, some doctors with a broom in the ass, flashbacks, some pills to trip with... It really sets in the character of the game, and helps you identify with him quickly. English being my 2nd language, I don't really grasp the story. But all I know is that I'm screwed in the brain and some pills make me go from room to room. These rooms vary a lot. Sometimes I'M ON A BOAT, sometimes in a corridor, sometimes in a cabin in the woods... These are neat. But all these rooms are dark enough to make you feel unsafe. Every noise, would it be the perfect placing of cue music to a simple clock ticking, makes you freak out.


I spend the next hour trying to resolve the mysteries unfolding before me. It feels like a point and click game, and can become quite frustrating since it is so easy to miss objects that are key to progression. The grabbing of the objects can also be infuriating : I struggled for like 3 minutes on the first release version with the UV lamps just trying to turn it in my hand . But all in all, these puzzles are really designed in a refreshing way. And by refreshing, I mean that you drop a huge sigh of relief everytime you manage to put a key on a door, not because of the mentionned control problems, but because it took some good effort to grab that damn key in the first place. Satisfaction and fun. Overall, the progression isn't that hard, but I've had some friends getting stuck for 30 minutes in some rooms, because the clues the game gives you through notes on your hands were written in an English too hard to understand for some. Still, it doesn't hurt the enjoyment to much as you roll through the doors.


And this is when the first ""jumpscare"" happens. I'm here in this corridor, and... I can't describe how much manlyness I lost in the process, screaming like a little child while trying to pass through the physical wall of my play area. This is scary. These moments aren't common, but when these happen, you are in for a treat. These are not Pewdiepie level jumpscares. These are smart. As if you were put in a dark room, and a mask slowly fades in view and approches you. A game that closely reproduces this level and sensation of fear would be Fatal Frame. This is so mentally challenging I had to pause the game at one point to take a breath and regain sanity.


After 6 hours, I finished the game. The story was quite interesting, even though it is totally not as rich as a Silent Hill. But I'm glad I finally came out of this rollercoaster. Damn, what an experience, one of the best I've had in my life. And when I say this, it means it is better than sex. Not that sex gets me jumpscares... I mean, it depends on how the sex is done, and who it is done with... I mean... nevermind.
Drugs are still better nonetheless.

It's a shame that this game is not featured as one of the Vive main titles.
I don't want to give out any spoilers so I'll just state few points
Pros:
-The Best use of Roomscale VR by far. Somebody in the Dev team who thought of this idea must be a genius. Not having to teleport through out the whole experience adds a lot to immersion. The way devs placed the game environment is just genius. They even added teleport support for ppl with smaller space. I think even if you have minimum VR space, you can probably enjoy the game with very little use of teleporting.
-Beautiful graphics. The most realistic graphics on Vive so far. The Lab has good graphics but this one has the most Realistic graphics. None or very little annoying aliasing, thank god
-Plot is actually well written(I don't know the ending yet but it is very engaging yet not too confusing)
-Very good use of BGM and use of 3D sound effects.
-No jump scare abuse that means nothing but horror.
Cons
-Object clipping through sometimes
-Physics is still not as good as how things are in the Lab but it is not horrible.
Bottom line
-The Best full game on VIve so far. I feel like most other games either feel too short, arcade like, not optimized for VR or simply not fun.

I like scary movies, but games have always been a bit too much. I only have a few hours into Alien Isolation, for example.

Regardless, I like to do my part in supporting these devs, especially right now in the early days of VR. And this looked good. I figured that it wouldn't actually be THAT scary. It looks well made, but not what I normally get creeped out about. Except, what I found here, didn't creep me out. It didn't scare me even. It GENUINELY TERRIFIED ME.

Never before, not in any game, not watching any movie, have I been completely frozen in fear. I read someone describe this game as ""Aggressively Terrifying"", and I like that. Suits this quite well really!

I guarantee you haven't played anyting else like this. Horror in VR is so different, you WILL get GENUINE PRESENCE, you won't even think to take the headset off. The headset doesn't exist when you have been gripped as well as this game does, during it's..... moments.

The controls are mostly well implemented
The music and voice acting is fantastic
The story is interesting, emotional and quite complex
The graphics are beautiful
The game isn't as short as people make out - It's certainly worth the money

A few gripes:
The locomotion is missing in a few areas of the game, like when you're on the ""boat"". Not a massive issue though.
I seemed to end up waiting around for something to happen a lot, especially on the scene with the smashed window near the end - I actually removed my headset and YouTubed it and it automatically moved on a few minutes later!

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The developer has clearly put his heart and soul into it, and he should be very proud of what he's achieved. I will certainly be following his work in the future.

Because of the clever use of room scale I really forgot I was standing in a 2.5mx2.5m space and became completely immersed.

The reason I do not like horror in general is becuase of cheap jump scares (monster jumps out and screams in your face full volume) but none of these were to be found here. The horror is built by suspense, environment, fantastic sound work and clever gaming devices. There are some jumps, but they are well placed and used correctly.

First of all, I'm a fan of horror games (always have been since Silent Hill 1 and Resident Evil 1...). A Chair in a Room, to me, all things considered (being 1st generation game and all) comes really close to these AAA titles I so much love. I believe A Chair in a Room truly is how horror games in VR should be implemented !

Pros: 
- Great scary ambiance !! (not relying on cheap-and-easy jump scares)
- Nice general storyline that grabs your attention
- Sounds and music
- Creative and very good use of room scaling
- Since the 1.1 update the mechanics are really good (thanks !!)

Improvement ideas:
- Story could be a little bit more refined (some scenes are a bit hard to make sense of in the general storyline)
- Because every room is basically your room space, it's really nice to move up to the wall and open a door to get to another room. It'd be even nicer if, when you get to the other room, you have the door you just opened at your back (instead of being ""teleported"" in the other room and try to ""guess"" which door you actually came from). Now, I know that, reading this it doesn't make sense as in real life your wall remains there and you can't walk through it, but maybe in the ""loading"" moment when opening the door there could have a UI indication to pivot 180 degrees and then the room would be loaded in front of you (with the door in your back). (Hope that makes sense). I believe, after a couple doors, it'd become quite a reflex to pivot during loading.

Cons:
- Loading times between some scenes are a little bit of an immersion breaker (minor!!)

There are a couple jump scares here and there, but the game primarily relies on psychological horror and storytelling, both of which it does a fantastic job of.

I'm playing in a smaller space, so I'm using the locomotion beta, which works very well. However, for the full experience, I'm sure that having a room that meets the minimum requirements without teleportation would be even better.

So I hardly write any reviews but this game was so damn well executed that I felt the need to.

First to state the obvious that everyone else has: yes, it is pretty fucking scary. I'm not a horror game fan in part because the genre has always felt pretty kitzchy but the developers nailed it on this game.

I know from brief experience that horror games tend to have strong stories or emotional drive and I wanted to see the potential of this type of game going in with a completely fresh perspective. I felt that this title deserves a good word to try and interest as many people as possible.

I think it's important to start with the outweighed negatives. This game has physics issues with interactible objects which can be disorientating at times. I also needed to use the locomotion system (beta build currently) to progress due to my smaller than required play area. In spite of these two ""immersion breaking"" factors, I felt completely involved in the surroundings and universe the developers created. A third factor would be the clue system, there have been two instances I have been frustrated enough with the time it has taken to solve a puzzle that I have felt it necessary to quit out of the game to find the answer. A secondary stronger clue system might be a solution, or just a tweak of the existing ones. I had issues in one scene in the first room and a second scene in the bathroom of the motel. Reading other reviews points out I am not the only person to have this experience, which is a shame. A linked downside to this is that I have had to replay sections up until the puzzle to get back to my progress. Some form of quick autosave would be appreciated for convenience.

Roomscale horror is fantastic. VR allows for some truly unforgettable set pieces. The sound design is superb to go hand in hand with this. The soundtrack is great and it really fits with the environment. To be honest, I do notice bad textures and ""jaggies"" in games (including this), but this seriously makes you look around them out of pure fear and respect for the terrifying atmosphere. There was also some texture pop-in in the onrails sections, but this may be due to my GTX 970 being on the lower end of the performance scale. You quickly get over the videogame aspect and put your mind into the shoes of your character. I would put this title alongside other high presence games, namely The Gallery and Waltz of the Wizard. If I was more sadistic, I would actually demo this game to other people that didn't directly ask just for the sheer immersion factor. It's that good!

Wolf and Wood deserve huge credit for what I consider to be the most substantial and fulfilling title I've played so far on the Vive. The Gallery was magical, but this is brutal and unforgiving and will have a longer overall playtime for the money. At 3 hours in, I am still progressing through the game (chapter 4 for people that have completed it). I believe (and sincerely hope) I am about half way though based on the Polaroids on the start room door.

I wanted to write this review when my initial impressions were still fresh. In spite of this, I would still recommend the game on the basis of value for money and strength of the experience. ""A Chair in a Room : Greenwater"" sets the bar high for future titles in my opinion. I have enjoyed the game enough to put it in my current ""must own"" list of games. If you do not typically enjoy horror games or are unsure you will enjoy this, I would suggest waiting for a sale as I do not recommend missing out.

I cannot wait to see what else the developers have in store and I sincerely hope they continue in this avenue of development.",1464997102,1464997102,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I didn't find it to be too scary, but I'm not easily scared. There were a couple moments that made me jump, and many more that I found rather creepy/spooky. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of presence. There is no teleportation mechanic and you need to actually walk to get to the different areas in the rooms. That being said you do need a larger play area (2.5 by 2.5m) however I was able to manage with a play area 2.1 by 2.4m but I also have a buffer zone that lets me go outside of my bounderies a good bit. Between rooms there is a type blank space that lets you reorient yourself for the next room. I found this to work very well and not break my imersion in any way. The game does a very good job at creating a tense atmosphere. It creates a sense of worry or panic in the player without needing the use of jump scares like other horror games. The story is pieced together very well through memories and flashbacks that keep you from understanding the whole thing until the end. 

That being said, the physics in this game could definitely use some improvement. Items you pick up in the game often clip into things causing them to fall. In one instance I lost a flashlight which I needed because it bumped into a closet door while I was bending down to pick up another item causing me to have to restart the level. The items clip through each other at times causing things to occasionally spaz out. The hitboxes of these items are also a little off. I occasionally would grab the wrong item because something was sitting next to what I wanted to pick up. I found myself frustrated at a couple spots where I knew what I was supposed to do, but was unable to because of the physics. I always eventually got it to work and never quite got the point of rage quitting but I did get fairly close once or twice. Even though the physics can be frustrating, its by no means game breaking. 

Pros
- Great use of room scale
- No need to teleport around (teleporting used in other vr games for movement is something I personally think needs to be improved on, I find it to be slightly game breaking)
- No cheap horror scares, genuine sense of hopelessness and fear
- Good story

Cons
- Object physics

Overall I really enjoyed this game. A majority of VR experiences are demos at the moment and this feels like a full game. It's a short game. It took me only around 3 hours to beat it but I'm sure it can be done much faster, even on a first run through. I spent a lot of time reading the signs and pamphlets in the game and I also didn't progress further until I was sure I saw everything there was to see in an area. Also I had to play two levels over because of physics issues. Realistically I would look to get about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of playtime out of it. I don't really see much replayablility out of it once you beat it once, but it would be good to demo to others who wanted to play a horror game.",1464917343,1464917343,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So there is one thing for sure I think that this may be the single most scary game I have ever played! I know this has a lot to do with the level of immersion that the vive brings to the table but also the games ability to harness it and you guys most definitely did it.

I'm a big horror fan and I knew with VR, these kinds of games would be great for it if done right. Well, I'm happy to say that this is one of the best out there so far for the Vive!

   Pros - Great atmosphere and music. This is something a horror/suspense game needs and this one pulls it off! As for the scares, from what I played so far it does the job. I've been playing horror games for years now and never got scared or felt uneasy. This game made me jump and creeped me out. Great job! For the hell of it, I wanted to see how good of a job it does to make you feel like you're there in the world. I was very impressed with even the little things. When I was on a boat, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, rocking back and forth. The boat actually moved like it would in real life. Bravo for the small details!

   Cons - So far the only thing I can complain about is the object interaction. Holding items feels weird unless you go out of your way to manipulate them until they fit in your hand how they are supposed to be. Then you have items that fall into walls or floors. If that happens with a key item, you have to restart the chapter. The other thing is room scale. It tells you that you have to have a certain amount of space, which I'm sure is true.

Take your vive controller, attach your wrist strap, and let go of the controller. See how it just dangles there all helpless and pathetic?

Let down by janky physics/interface and unsatisfying puzzles.  Still one of the best room scale horror games and worth the asking price.

---

Looks and sounds great, with some great creepy visuals and audio. Story doesn't pull any punches and there's a good element of psychological horror rather than just relying on jump scares, although there's some of those to enjoy too. 
Use of space in room scale is one of the best I've seen too. Rather than rely on a teleport mechanic, you move one room at a time. Between each section you're asked to position yourself so that there's always space to move. I think this works really well, and adds to the immersion as you always feel like your doing the moving around yourself, rather than by some  teleport magic. 

The puzzle design is passable, if you can call them puzzles. None of them really require thought more than just banging together random objects. I found at least one of them to be annoyingly non sequitur.  It's a shame that there was nothing there that I really had to engage my brain for. 

My biggest criticism is with the interface and physics. It really lets down the whole experience. Picking things up, which is arguable the most common thing you do, is awkward as hell. Even if you do manage to get a grip things can annoying just drop out of your hand for seemingly no reason. On more than one occasion the thing that was dropped dissapeared forever causing me to have to replay sections of the game to continue. This was excacerbated by the lack of any inventory system which meant the only way to carry the required items between rooms was in your hands. In general the physics feel seriously janky and really reduced the immersion for me. On the plus side, the physics on the underwater sections were really nice to play with.

On the whole, despite the problem with the physics, I very much enjoyed the game and can recommend it. I'd say in its current state it's only just worth the asking price, but it is worth buying.",1464181387,1464181387,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I know it may hurt immersion, but we flat out skipped some text because it was just too annoying to stick the controller against our faces. Otherwise! The story and atmosphere was great.

Its by far one of the best VR experiences I've had, and trust me I've tried a lot. I felt that i was actually in a movie.

I am yet to complete it, i think i have 1 or 2 chapters left but i would buy the game again instantly without thinking.

By far one chapter stands head and shoulders above all the others and that is the one in the motel. Obviously, no spoilers but there are too many amazing scenes in this chapter.

The game does have a few glaring issues however, mainly the problem of items collision detection being a bit weird, especially when they interact with other items in the same world. Its a bit glitchy. Especially paper and news articles, they tend to get stuck onto each other and make it hard to pull away.

However, don't let that issue detour you away from the game, it is an amazing experience, and i am afraid to finish it so quickly as i want to play it for much longer :D

Devs, please add more chapters to the game or release a sequel ASAP!

VR horror adds a level of debth thats impossible to achieve in any other medium ive experienced. If you are into horror games and you have a vive, do yourself a favor and pick this up.

Pros: 
Amazing atmosphere. Its actually scary.
I dont think ive ever played a game that has made me so scared. Not because what happend was the most frightening ive ever seen, but because it definitely ranked in the top 10 scariest things I've ever physically experienced. Having you be the player, walking around, exploring leaves you so immersed, at times i forgot i was playing a game. I never thought to tear the headset off my face because I was standing there confronting these things and I knew it was hopeless and there was nothing i could do but let my fate unfold.

Great little touches that really immerse you in the game.
The post cards have smudge marks on them from being handled with someone with oily skin. Its only noticable if you hold a card under a light and angle it a particular way. Who thinks of that?! Also, there is a moment where a bright light is shined in your face. I instinctavely held my hand up to the light to shade my eyes and it worked. Little moments like that pulled me in completely and I totally lost myself in the game. The developer did an amazing job making you feel a particular using sights and sounds. I dont think ive ever been so present in a VR experience before.

Cons:
Holding objects is a pain.
Objects you can interact with come in two flavors, ones that you hold steady in your hand in the position you grabbed them in, and objects that kinda swing freely in your hand. I would say 95% of the objects in this game should have been the steady kind. Unfortunately, its only about half that you hold steady. This makes moving large objects very difficult, even if you use two hands. Two handed holding feels like you are grabbing two strings attached to the object and its free to spin and sway however it pleases. But even the static object holding was not optimal. If you pick something up off the floor, and try to look at it, you have to hold your controller awkwardly. Objects are held in the exact position you pick them up in. This works, but i think it would be greatly improved if they snapped to a default position in relation to the controllers orientation. That way you wouldnt need to keep picking things up and putting them down until you hold them in the optimal position for use. 

There is some replay value, but not much. 
This isnt really a con though and just kind of the nature of this expreience. I went back and replayed some portions of the game and the atmosphere stays, but if you know the solutions to puzzles and when some frightening scenes are, you can mostly get through the game unaffraid. That being said though, there were still some times when id forget something was about to happen and jump out of my skin =]",1463521301,1463521301,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

El concepto de Room Scale está muy bien resuelto en esta historia con puzles ya que normalmente pasaremos de una habitación a otra sin tener que movernos con un pad o teletransportarnos, todas están pensadas para ir andando hasta ellas. Os recomiendo que para este pongáis el chaperone en desarrollador ya que los propios muros del juego os marcaran los limites la mayoría de las veces.
Los gráficos me han parecido muy buenos para lo que tenemos ahora mismo en la realidad virtual, muy “creíbles” aunque pequen de pocos polígonos, pero muy sólidos lo que hace que te sientas en esas habitaciones.
El sonido muy bueno, consigue el efecto que se quiere transmitir (no quiero hacer Spoilers).
Las físicas como digo, desastrosas, cuesta mucho interaccionar con los objetos a día de hoy, espero que lo arreglen porque es lo que ensombrece al juego.
Lo importante es que este juego me ha mantenido en tensión como NADA MAS de todo lo que he jugado anterior mente en pantalla. Me he sorprendido a mí mismo gritando con los brazos y torso encogidos cuando nunca antes lo había hecho con películas de miedo (y me gustan mucho).
No lo catalogaría como un juego de miedo, pero hay ciertos puntos en los que te da miedo girarte porque sabes que algo te va a aparecer.
El juego está en ingles sin subtitular, con lo que hay veces que me he perdido un poco, ya que las pistas que te aparecen en tu mano no son del todo claras.
Soy consciente de que es un juego en el que en pantalla no pasaría del 5 pero que en la realidad virtual sube de nota totalmente por la inmersión.

This game does an EXCELLENT job of handling room-scale. You will actually feel like you're in a cramped, dark room with no way to escape. I feel like this is the current benchmark for VR horror games.

Many people (perhaps rightly) complain that most of today's VR games are too short and unfinished to be worth their price tags, but A Chair In A Room isn't one of them. It's short--it took roughly three hours for me to get through it, but it feels complete. In fact, if it were any longer, it would have started to feel as if were dragging on.

It's not perfect, though. The most noticeable problem is with object manipulation. Sometimes you'll spend a couple of minutes just trying to pick up an object. The physics can get weird at times, and collision detection seems to be a bit buggy. The narrative feels a bit strained as well. Honestly, I still don't get it.

But even with these issues, it's still worth picking up.",1462512425,1462512425,True,9,0,0.576588869094848633,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game uses sound, leveldesign and story to make a good atmosphere for the player.
The story is well written althoug a little bit confusing and alot is left to the player but thats how the game is designed.
it also is very rewarding and left me to come up with theories along the way as i solved puzzles.
Downsides this game had was;

Mediocre/bad physics:
 The games physics sometimes screws items up like falling trough the world, although it didnt happen so often it was a bother. also it resets important items if they were to ""disappear"" wich is a good thing.

Requires a very big VR-space:
it requires minimum 2.5x2.5 metres space (wich is alot) and i played it with 2x1.9 space wich works but may break immersion but thats my fault.
The game would otherwise not be that scary or good if it was any less required.

Other than that it is a very much recommended game and definately gives you the chills, and i am looking forward for more games from Wolf & Wood.

It plays as if it were in alpha, as most of the games I've been playing in Vive are in beta and are far more solid.

It suffers from many technical glitches, objects get stuck together, fall through the world, don't move like a real world counterpart, and many times just don't make sense.
My instinct to slide a cup resulted in the cup not moving, but sticking to the table.
Using a lamp I found in a pitch black area didn't light the area at all, just the interactive object in it.

The object interaction is very unintuitive, trying to pass objects from one hand to another results in them falling to the ground. Picking up the ""chair"" results in a strange feeling of it hanging by a string. All larger objects behave that way as I remember. Your hands in game float about 4 inches above where your real world hands are.

The scripting is awkward and transparent. I decided not to take the pills in ep.1 and everything begins all over again without context.

The point being that in order to be scared, you have to be drawn into the place, and all of these things constantly serve as distractions that break the immersion. It's like trying to watch a scary movie with the boom mic and set crew ending up in the camera view.

Aside from that, I only made it to the second chapter and quit of frustration, while not being at all scary to me.
