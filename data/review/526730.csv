Life of Lon is a short, 10-minute journey through space where you crashland on an alien planet. You find yourself greeted by a curious cat-like creature, who then guides you through just a small portion of the surrounding landscape. This small little demo-teaser is denoted as Chapter 1, with a wide expanse of upcoming chapters laid out before you at the main menu; quite clearly Chapter 2 is marked as currently in production. With that said, the developer has been silent in giving any feedback on progress updates, and their last post in the forums was December 2018.

There's not really a lot to say here, since there's not really a lot of content. Life of Lon is basically a 10-minute interactive story that lets you spend half of the time being frustrated by not knowing what to do. Turns out, you just sit there and wait until the game actually shows you what to do next, and then it's just following your new friend to a certain destination and you're done. The environment isn't even that awe-inspiring. There's not anything worth getting excited for, which the developer should've implemented to keep people interested in coming back to see if Chapter 2 is ready. It's pretty well a wasted download at this point, two years after its release, especially given that we have no clue if anything else will be coming.

Eine VR-Story ist immer ein interessanter Ansatz. Über die Grafik lässt sich streiten, da man nun auch unter Wasser noch nicht allzu viel entdecken und sehen konnte. Bisher haut die Steuerung auch gut hin, man kann dabei zwischen zwei unterschiedlichen Modi zur Fortbewegung des Schiffs/U-Boots wählen.

head-tilt work great, vote changed.

Es bleibt abzuwarten, wie gut das Spielkonzept umgesetzt wird. Das erste Kapitel sollte man sich auf jedem Fall angucken. Ich habe auf jeden Fall Lust auf mehr ""Life of Lon"" bekommen.

Danke an die Entwickler.

Currently, it is free and it isn't buggy, so thumbs up for that. Whether or not it is worth your time, will be determined if the devs actually release the intended chapters to complete the story. I hope this is the case because the experience is quite nice looking and it is coupled with good music. 

One thing that would be nice is the ability to change the options at any time. I didn't realize how much masking was going to happen once I started playing, and I would have preferred to dip back in to the options to adjust it.
