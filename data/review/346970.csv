Dev, do you know the ""Risk of Rain"" game? they even joked on the launch of RoR2 because of the port fowarding needed to play online on the first game, you are not only making the same mistake as they did on their first game, but you are not even thinking in changing that, and just says that the workaround is to pay for a service, and this is most likely people that will buy the service will give you some percentage since people will use your code

I really expect this game to change, to be able to create listen server rooms and invite friends on steam to join and play

until then, i'll just follow the game to receive patch notes

For such low number of players, the default settings are somewhat unbalanced.

This makes the ""killer"" strategy non-viable because the player has to spend to buy new ships all the time or risk being overthrown.

I was sceptical that it's early access with no updates for almost a year now, but the game is already fun and playable from start to finish as it is.

It's set around the concept of getting your enemies to act against their own self interest, which you may be confused about, after all, why would your opponents try to help you win? Well, because they think that it'll also help themselves win. The victor is typically the one who best enlists the help of the other players while keeping them thinking that they're not actually sabotaging themselves. Either that or that one bunny which just plays perfectly obedient the whole game yet still somehow wins because they're getting steady progress towards that 10,000 cent goal while everyone else is squabbling to be overlord.

As I sort of alluded to in that last paragraph, the goal is to recieve 10,000 points. These points are presumably a currency of some kind, but it's not actually named, so I just call them cents, because the symbol looks similar. The way you go about gaining 10,000 cents will vary depending on playstyle, you may become overlord at the very beginning of the round, and simply never lose the position, or you'll be the aforementioned player that just does everything the overlord asks yet doesn't lose to them.

Now, presuming you're reading this while having NO idea how the game works, at the beginning of the game, every player is dropped into the world with a bunny avatar. The players all race to the large robot seen in the right hand side of the game's thumbnail. This robot is Robosaru, and it's the centerpiece of every game of Obey. Once the first player reaches Robosaru, they become overlord. The overlord's objective is the same as any other player's, but they now have the ability to use their machine gun to kill any player within their vision, and even detonate the obedience collars of players you can't see. So one may ask how Robosaru has any chance of losing, which is simple: the other bunnies are more valuable to him alive than dead, which gives them a chance to succeed. The overlord will typically force the other players to bring uranium to his collection box, which will give him a substantial amount of money, but of course, the other players won't do this for free, so the overlord can set auto-pay on his boxes to give the other players a specific amount of money every time they deposit uranium.

Essentially, it's a boss-worker relationship, except the overlord is more like a dictator.

Any player can become the NEW overlord at any time, the same way that the first player did, running up to Robosaru's door and entering it. This kicks out the first player, who is now just a lowly bunny, and suddenly you have the exact same scenario, just with a different overlord. But, of course, it's not that simple, as the overlord can kill you at any moment that he can see you. It's not even as simple as staying out of his sight, as your obedience collar lets him know exactly where you are at all times. So what do you do? Well, you take the collar off. But this is a dangerous prospect, since every player gets passive income over time. If memory serves, the overlord gets 8 cents a second, collared bunnies get 4 cents a second, and uncollared bunnies get 2 cents a second. So taking your collar off for a substantial amount of time is very risky. Even more risky is if you get killed, because then you get sent to the dropship. Not only does this mean you can't deposit uranium, and therefore collect funds, but your passive income also drops to 1 cent per second in the dropship, even if you're wearing an obedience collar.

That's pretty much how Obey works. A bit of a complicated and messy explanation, but hopefully it sufficed. Now onto the actual review.

The mechanics, as detailed above, are absolutely flawless. Just fantastic. The music is very dystopian, which helps sell the overlord as a ruthless dictator. I especially like the main menu theme. The art-style is nice, and I was a big fan of the little details, like how the bunnies breath so quickly due to the fact that they're very probably scared witless. The only real criticism I have for this game is that not enough people are playing it, which is actually why I'm writing this review, in the hopes it may attract more players to the game. BUT! Even if it's better with real other players, the bots in this game are actually remarkably good, to the point that I actually find myself losing to them sometimes. Of course, bots are no substitute for human interaction, and playing with them instead of real people does lose the human element, but I'd still say it's worth the money.",1520201979,1576074352,True,5,0,0.565189659595489502,0,True,False,True,False,,,

BUT, it can use a bit more pollish.

The big thing is smoother animation for the main robot, as it feels it lags too much in animation. Another major thing is lessen the time on the smoke clouds from the gun, as they stay for way too long. I get using them as cover can be a good thing, but still lessening the time they stay can still make them usable. Another thing I would HIGHLY recommend doing is giving a cool down for the main gun, make the player think before holding down the fire button as they might have unlimited ammo, but will lose usage of the gun for a bit if used for too long and thus leave them open unless they can use their other tools.

Aside from those major things, only other thing I'd recommend is more tools for the one in the giant robot to use to keep track of others and more options for others to try and sneak into the robot outside of water and bushes and using upper ground as walls.

(they also earn their share of the money). You can destroy people who disobey or try to overthrow you. On the other hand, as a regular rabbit, you have to do your best to escape the clutches of the tower. By either playing along to lull the person in charge to a sense of security, planning distractions, sneaking. All is based around mind games and trying to trick each other, and the tower can even do stuff like bribing other players to keep an eye on you and report you if they notice you trying to sneak into the door. Communication and misdirection are all keys to success.

However, once you take the turret over, you may choose to invest some of your score into penalising other players for dying and incentivising them players to work for you. But of course, if you lose control, the new overlord inherits all of your investments.

As the current overlord you have to choose how to best incentivise other players to obey and making you money.
As a defenseless bunny you must choose either to obey and earn a small share of income, or rebel and risk earning nothing at all.

1. It's like King of the Hill more or less, as the description stated, the longer you hold the robot, the more money you make. It's a concept alot of people are familiar with, and once you learn the controls, (ex. Increase/Decrease Autopay, Purchasing Items, ect.) it's really easy to master. The hard part is mastering how to trick everyone!

2. It's really helirious to be anything you wanna be, you can be a snitch, sitting on a tower, spotting out people to get destroyed by the overlord, you can play as the overlord with an arsenal of things to obliterate anyone you want, or you can play as a good bunny, and passively do whatever the robot tells you. It really does feel amazing to have such options in a game, most games either you are bad, or good, but this game, you can be a no-tolerance overlord, but still be a good guy and pay your bunnies fairly. But I think the funniest part about it, is the varying reactions you get from people.

3. It's easy, and appealing to the eyes. The cartoony style fits well with the setting and it honestly makes it feel cozy to be in a lobby with other people.

4. The people you'll play with are not heavily competitive. Not that I've noticed atleast, as no one really tries super duper hard, or gets super salty when you take over. It's a nice change of pace from most multiplayers out there.

5. The bunnies are just about the cutest darn thing I've ever seen in a video game. Slime Rancher's Slimes have competition with how adorable the jumping, squeaking, and hopping is. It makes you go 'Awww"" every time.

6. People say the servers are ghost towns, but if you join a lobby, play and mess about with the bots for a bit, people will join in. I had it happen to me several times over. It just takes a bit of time, remember, the community is small. Insta-games won't happen until the community reachs 5000 players or so!

[h1]The Negatives[/h1]
1. For a bunny rabbit, who can sprint at a maximum of 30 to 25 miles per hour, you move more like a turtle. Very slowly. And there is no sprint option.

2. If you are hoping for a new experience everytime...It is a small community still, so you will run into the same people pretty much every time you play the game. For some, this is a good thing, familiarity is nice. But for people like me, who like to see different styles, and different things done, if you run into the same group, it feels sort of frustrating, because you know what to expect.

3. You kinda have to be social to play this game. This is under the negative, because I know it is very difficult for some to put themselves out there as it were. And I know some people who looked at this game thought it would be neat, until they read about how having a mic is pretty much imperative, all I can really say is if you really think you'll like it, even though you don't feel socially apt, give it a go! I certainly did, and I loved it.

TL;DR: Gameplay, Art Style, Concept are amazing, and The game is mostly bug free. Negatives: Small, if not tiny community, Servers don't get populated very fast, and It'll definitly put you out of your comfort zone if you don't like using your mic/hearing other people use theres.",1511077987,1511077987,True,3,0,0.508532464504241943,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The first game was somewhat enjoyable. The player who dominated the robot tactically used bunnies against eachother, and managed to gather up a large stockpile of weaponry. Eventually though, he reached the point where giving him uranium and supplies would guarantee that the bunnies would lose, yet people still kept supplying him, instead of rushing him to try to gain control and have a chance of winning themselves. The second game I played was much worse. I took control of the robot early on, and the bunnies consisted of little kids who didn't even want to play the game, just build houses out of supplies. Eventually the more experienced players that joined immeditely left when they realized the bunnies weren't trying. When I attained a 80% of the points needed to win, some of them realized they should probably try to overthrow me. Instead of working together or trying to come up with a strategy, they ran like chickens with their heads cut off. Eventually, the smartest among them started trying to put corpses in the supply machine, which would cost me 1000's of points if succesful. Eventually someone else took control of the robot while I was distracted, but instead of working with the other players to secure an advantage, he just started shooting everyone. I then won due to a lack of any competition as my score ticked up.

The game is not worth the 15$, because no one plays the game.

It's an experience that's substantially different from any other game I've played. It is a ton of fun. 

I'll let other reviews explain the mechanics of the game. What I want to focus on is the strategy and drama that unfolds between the human players.

When you're in command, it's like being an evil dictator of a third-world country. You have to keep your workers in line through power, but also through cunning. Your citizens may ostensibly be helping you, but they'll betray you at any moment if you let your guard down.

When you're not in command, it's like being a citizen of an evil dictatorship. You want to rebel and take control, but you can't be too obvious about it or you'll be quickly punished. If you do rebel, you'll need to work covertly until the perfect moment to strike. Or you can cozy up to the dictator and actually earn a meager living in his shadow.

Things you'll do if you're crafty enough (when you're in command):
[list]
[*]Keep close track of all your workers (other players), to see if they are subtlely undermining you, or trying to escape.
[*]Set and enforce rules to keep your workers in line (not too strict or they will openly rebel, but not too lenient or they will take advantage of you.)
[*]Use your charisma to make the workers prefer you to another commander.
[*]Convince your loyal workers to betray the rebels in their midsts for a reward.
[*]Blow disloyal bunnies to smithereens, but then offer to forgive them so they might still go back to being in your workforce.
[/list]

Things you'll do if you're crafty enough, (when you're NOT in command):
[list]
[*]Pretend to be stupid and make ""mistakes"" to undermine the commander.
[*]Secretly damage the commander's goals while he isn't looking, or do things to cause society itself to fall into chaos.
[*]Threaten to stop working unless pay is increased.
[*]Cause a distraction so your allies can escape.
[*]Take advantage of chaos to make your own escape, and slowly lurk up to the command center to take control (or die trying.)
[*]Betray your fellow workers' secret plot for a reward.
[*]Lie about the location of rebels to distract the commander.
[*]Give up the true location of a rebel that is about to take power for themselves.
[*]Convince the commander to let you do things that put you in a better position (like build things a little too close to the commander to ""help"" him.)
[*]Win by actually being loyal to your commander.
[*]Organize coordinated rebellions or ""jail breaks"".
[/list]

All of the above involves using various aspects of the game's mechanics to your advantage, but also involves social engineering of the other players in order to succeed. It is possible to play without speaking to your fellow players, but voice chat is vital to getting the most out of OBEY.

OBEY gives you both an amazing sense of power, and also the delight of subverting that power. If you're looking for an experience that's likely different from anything you've played before, give OBEY a shot.",1473611298,1473611298,True,4,1,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Obey is a game where you as the player are a bunny trying to get to the center of the map so that you may control a giant robot. It sounds easy and simple at first, yet the robot is controlled by a player that is bound to kill you upon nearing the giant robot that has miniguns and rockets. You must then OBEY the player in dire hopes that you don't go up in flames or get blown up with rockets. Now the game and it's concept is indeed fun, yet the game is hard to learn and the in-game tutorial teaches you little about the actual game upon entering multiplayer. You will end up in a either a empty server or a server with one or two people and you will find it rather difficult to understand the game at first, yet if you do manage to understand the difficulty in learning the game then you will meet another obstacle. Sometimes you will find players in the robot that will constantly kill you whether or not your following orders, and at that point the game becomes Hide and Seek Killer Robot Edition. Sometimes you may be in the robot, and no one will follow your orders at all even though your trying to give easy orders. Those two things simply ruin the enjoyable aspect of the game and makes it into something so pointless. If you do manage to find some players that will play your game then congrats! You will have a few minutes of enertainment until the players leave via boredom/rage. The game after a while becomes pointless and quite repetitive as you work, plot, and either execute or fail your plot (rinse and repeat). Finally, the ONE MAJOR FACTOR IN THIS GAME is that you NEED a MICOPHONE! I cannont stress this enough! If you do not have a microphone then be prepared to lose over and over again as the bunnies steal your robot while you type a order (or they simply ignore you cause you do not have a microphone). I thankfully have a microphone to dish out pointless orders to rebeilous players that never listen.

There's a lot of pointing fingers and blaming going on which is extra funny because every player has exactly the same visual appearance and you cannot distinguish one player from another. It's also a lot about being unpredictable so that other player's don't understand which strategy you follow until it's too late.

This game is very original in concept so let be explain what it is about in more detail:

Everyone is a bunny. A white cuddly cute bunny that has no possiblity of harming anyone with his bunny body. BUT: There is a gigantic robot in the area that can be used to exert dominance over the other bunnies. So it is a good idea to head towards the robot, take control over it and start commanding around the other players. If they do not obey, you can very easily annihilate them with your robot guns. You are now a tyrant and the other bunnies will try to overthrow you by invading the robot themselves. So be vigilant and shoot any bunny that comes too close to your robot.

However, just being agressive will not suffice to be victorious. The objective of every player is to gain 10,000 dollars (or some other currency). Every player has a passive income. The player sitting in the robot has a passive income that is ten times as much as the income of the bunnies outside the robot. Every player can invest his money on items that might give them an advantage ingame. If done correctly, you can win the game, even if you are not in control of the robot.

The interesting thing is: Collaborating players have an advantage. But in the end there will always be only one winner and everyone else loses. So you cannot collaborate at all costs. At some point you have to fight on your own and try to get the lead.

Collaboration can happen between non-robot bunnies and the bunny in the robot. The robot can bribe/reward bunnies that bring him material to the feed box. The feed box is a box on the map where items can be placed. Some items give money or ammunition to the robot. When a bunny delivers an item to the feedbox, the robot may decide to reward him with money, so that it is a win-win situation for both players. But it is stil in the interest of every individual player that no other player has more money than himself.

The controls of the game are simple and sufficient to navigate the terrain and to control the robot. No complaints there.

This game is also fully playable at this moment, even though it is still early access. It is well balanced and it's fun to use the game mechanics to screw over other players. For example, if a bunny dies in a fire, the corpse can be collected and placed in the feed box. When this happens, the player in the robots loses 1000 dollars which is a lot of money. But getting the corpse to the feed box might be a real challenge because the player in the robot will try to monitor all traffic in the map and if he spots you carrying a corpse you have to run for your life.

I think the tutorial does a decent job at explaining the game mechanics.

The only downside of this game is that you need other players to have the best experience. The game has bots that you can play against but this is a game about betrayal and bots are obviously pretty bad at this. But they are still helpful to fill up a lobby. Remember: Every player looks the same. So you cannot even tell if you are looking at a bot or at a real player. And even though the bots are stupid, they do a pretty good job at being hard to distinguish from human players.

 [h1]Review[/h1] 

 OBEY é um jogo de estratégia em tempo real com interacção social entre jogadores, num mapa em 3D, onde para vencer temos de convencer os outros a fazer tarefas que muitas vezes contrariam os seus próprios objectivos, em troca de alguma outra vantagem, ganhando no final do tempo de jogo o jogador que tiver mais dinheiro acumulado. 

 O tutorial podia ser mais completo, dar um exemplo de uma estratégia para vencer e não limitar-se a descrever os comandos e a utilidade de cada objecto. Contudo, é de saudar a vontade do criador (developer) em ajudar quem quer aprender a jogar, convidando pessoalmente os interessados no steam, pelo menos nesta fase de desenvolvimento do jogo, com o objectivo de melhorar o tutorial.

 Apesar de não ser adepto de jogos exclusivamente multiplayer, reconheço que este jogo tem potencial. Realçe para o facto do jogo estar ainda inacabado.

Attention, tout d'abord, le jeu requiert un micro, pour pouvoir jouer en multi (et je n'en ai pas). 

Je n'ai testé que le mode de jeu contre les bots, et ce n'est malheureusement pas très intéressant, car on perd tout le côté stratégique du jeu, j'imagine.

Nor does it run on my 2010 Macbook (Non-Pro) with only 2 GB of RAM.

With that being said, here is my semi in depth review.

Obey is a First Person multiplayer game that sets itself apart from most by focusing on team based play. It can be played online, or with bots, though the bots tend to be pretty easy. It can seem very chaotic and difficult to understand at first, although once one masters the gameplay it gets less confusing. The game's tutorial tries to teach you how to play a little, showing you what different items do and how the game works. Gameplay is basically like a very complicated King Of The Hill, in which players feed items into a massive robot controlled by one player in order to try to earn money so then the player controlling the robot can give back more items and money to the players. In terms that a sane person will understand, to win you basically need to make the most money.

Overall, the game is worth buying for people that are looking for an interesting multiplayer experience that strives to be different from your average online game.

There's only one word I can use to describe it: chaos.

You've only got one goal: get the most money possible.

It's crazy confusing at first. The tutorial helps, but goes so fast and is still not entirely clear (the easiest ways to play are either in the lobby with bots or by looking it up on youtube). You're thrown into a field full of junk, corpses, rocket fuels, etc. You can put these items in a ""feed box"" going to the robot, offering them different perks and giving you a small amount of money. However, the more loyal you are, the richer the robot gets. As a bunny, there's not much you can do besides feed the robot and hope he gives you money for being loyal.

Now, you can always go overthrow him and take control.

This opens up a whole new world of excitement. You have to constantly watch for disobeying bunnies attempting to steal your throne, pay loyal bunnies, order dropships with supplies for your bunnies to feed you, shoot disobeying bunnies, and much much more. 

Overall, it's a great game once you get the hang of it. The bots are super easy to play against, so once you know what you're doing I recommend getting with actual people to play. Mics are also extremely helpful for communication.

No doubt. But there still is some issues. And these issues, doesn't have anything to do, with it is early access.

1. The game is really fun, with a unique concept. The problem is... It gets boring, within 1 - 2 days. The game is limited. All you do in the game is: Obey the overlord, or disobey him. Become the overlord, or stay as a bunny.

2. The game is in a lack of players. There are only 4 - 6 servers, in the game. 5 of them, are North American servers. 1 of them is a european server. There are never any europeans, playing. And when someone is playing in a north american server, there aren't that many players. There are probably only 10 players, in total, globally in this game.

So the game needs to be more populated, to actually be fun.

I do not recommend, buying this game (yet). The game developers are really great people. But i had to refund the game again, because i knew i would never play the game again. So, what this game needs is:

- Nearly unlimited interactions and items.
- More players. It's not fun to play with bots (they dont know wth they are doing).",1452340970,1452340970,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

El objetivo principal del juego es crear interacciones interesantes entre jugadores, poniendo mucho énfasis en la comunicación verbal (altamente recomendado jugar con un micrófono y con gente que hable tu mismo idioma).
Por esto para ganar una partida lo único que tienes que hacer es ser el primer jugador en alcanzar una cierta cantidad de dinero determinada, el como lo hagas depende completamente de tu estrategia. Al empezar todos los jugadores manejan a un conejito con una movilidad un tanto limitada, el primero en antrar en el ""robot"" (una torreta/torre de control) se combierte en una especie de dictador de la partida. Pero este puede ser derrocado con relativa facilidad.
Es tu desición si quieres obedecer y recibir los incentivos del líder de turno o si te combiertes tú en el líder, ambos son caminos validos para ganar.
El problema es que la diversión que puedes tener en este juego está demasiado ligada a con quien estás jugando, puede ser una experiencia memorable o lo más aburrido que puedas imaginar.
Si bien no hay mucho o casi nada que arreglar en el aspecto técnico este juego necesita un poco de pulido y refinamiento de las mécanicas de juego y el como se desarrolla una partida. Por lo que existe la posibilidad de que el resultado final sea sustancialmente diferente a lo que hay ahora, de hecho espero que el producto final sea mejor porque se nota el potencial de la idea base aquí presentada.
En resumen: como con todo juego en acceso anticipado, ten presente que este es un trabajo aún en proceso, no una pieza terminada.

You know, the game where you and your friends pretend you are all civilians, but some of you are actually Mafia gangsters ready to lie and take everyone out.

You and your furry little fellows must all obey one huge monkey looking robot that watches over it all. Do as he says, and he will most probably reward you and distinguish you among your pairs. Disobey him, and you'll probably just fall under his machine-gun. 
Now, before you star assuming this developer has some sort of child induced fear to primates, let me tell you the twist of it all. The giant bad ass looking robot you see from anywhere on the map? That's actually a hamster. That's right, there's one of you just hanging in inside. That bastard got up there first to watch over you and your mates. To be the leader. One ham to rule them all.
Of course, he can't be up there all by his own. All those fancy tech you see? It won't just work of air, he needs some souls to move the gears for him, and he has just the tools to make you WANT to do it.

Now, only if you ever touched a history book in you life, can you be ignorant enough of what is fond to happen in a situation like this. Yeah, those hams won't take it for long.

The fun of it all resides in that there's no actual clear way to play this game. 
Be a loyal feud to your master and gain his trust.
Be a revolutionary leader and lead your pack to subversion.
Be a loner ham or the lunatic that makes everyone's life miserable.

It has a nice tutorial but it only teaches the mechanics and baseline rules. (I had to run the tutorial three times to get it) You really learn the game by playing with real players. (You can play with bots to learn, but I have more fun and learn a lot with real players.) 

Although it is in its early stages I did not encounter any bugs.

I can write tens of pages regarding the philosophy of this game but instead I strongly advise you to buy/play it.

Perhaps a ""demo time"" will be nice so that people can really test it before they can be sure. As for most of the unique games, the only way to understand the game/concept is by playing it...

First off, this game is SUPER unique, I've honestly never played any game like this before.
When I first started playing this game, I went straight for the tutorial and right after to the multiplayer part.
I quickly met this super friendly guy in-game, who was eager to show and teach me how exactly this game worked and some of the aspects in the game, which the tutorial simply couldn't show you.
It turns out, this great guy was the developer of the game, he's a really friendly and nice guy.

In this game you're a cute little bunny, your mission is to first achieve a certain amount of money.
There are different ways to do this, however, you can either be an obedient bunny and do as the robot tells you or be the disobedient bunny and take control over the robot, and start controlling the obedient bunnies.
When playing as the robot, make sure to keep track of your obedient/disobedient bunnies and make deals with them. This way they'll keep OBEYing you and you'll stay in control.

Pros:
+ Super great potential.
+ Extremely friendly community.
+ Great strategy game.
+ Negotiating with people. (Deny, deny, deny. If that doesn't work then just lie, lie, lie).
+ Choice between being the evil robot or the obedient/disobedient bunny.
+ Great response time from developer.
+ Nice variation in maps. (Game includes level editor)

Cons:
- If you don't have a mic, this game could become a little challenging.
- Not super many players yet. (This is where you come into the picture, JUST BUY IT!).


A tip I would like to give you all, ""when"" you buy this game is: Start out with the tutorial and try listening closely to what it tells you. When you have done that, go for an hour or two in multiplayer to get a grasp of the game and then turn back to the tutorial. I myself felt like I didn't completely understand the game after the first tutorial attempt, a bit much information to grasp for me atleast, but when I played a bit of multiplayer and got a hang of how stuff worked, I took a quick turn back to the tutorial and it just suddenly made a whole bunch of sense. 

I rate this game atleast 9/10, close to 10/10.

Would I buy this game?
Hell yea!

Would I recommend you to buy the game?

It's not your traditional kill or be kill multiplayer, and for that it's a breath of fresh air. 

It's a unique experience.

The game runs smoothly on my 3 year old laptop, which is always a bonus too. 

If you're looking for a multiplayer game that's simple to pick-up and learn, but with a surprising amount of strategy (and tension) then look no further.

Each player is dumped into the map as a harmless bunny/sheep creature whose only abilities are to pickup or drop items and perform an astonishing 1cm high jump + ""squeek"" combo of cuteness. There is a huge opportunity for personalising characters with accessories here, which is one of the many updates currently planned. 

The gameplay is essentially defined by the actions of the players in the match in question, but I guess you could describe the overarching type as a strategic game of power accumulation. The winner is decided by who reaches $10,000 first. The way in which they achieve that is up to them and the other players. 

A match usually begins with a mad dash to the giant robot/tower, whose occupant has a variety of extra actions available to them. If they play their cards right, they can make the other players collect resources for them which converts to money for [b][i]both[/i][/b] players. If they fail to carefully watch their subordinates, they can find sneaky ways to detract power and money or even overthrow their control of the robot. 

This is where the unique gameplay mechanics come into play. As controller of the robot, the game provides some generic warnings and instructions to place on the map for your subordinates, but the real gameplay takes place through chatting with the other players, demanding one thing or offering payment for colecting resources or making demands on threat of violence (gun turret, flamethrower, rockets).

As an online-only game (there are A.I bots that work properly, but for me the fun was completely lost without human players), the availability of friends/strangers to play with will make or break your experience with OBEY. I would highly recommend purchasing a 4-pack with some friends or finding a group to play with.

A serious game about decision making, following or being following, betrayals and loyalty with a hint of sneakiness. Aside that you take role of a cute [strike]guinea pig[/strike] bunny with some insatiable lust for money and ravage.[/i]

Now, skipping the lyrical part, game is quite good generally. Game concept where you are supposed to behave in a cat-and-mouse way, with application of being more of an armed watcher tower [""cat""], who supervises his minions and guiding them to earn more benefits, while punishing those who dare to act suspicious with death penalty, - is quite rare to meet in the industry. If I am to describe this game in short, your winning condition is to gain 10 000$ prior to any other player by any means possible, which is either obeying the tower - ""boss"" and working hard to bring goods in a box to gain money both for the tower and yourself, or devote yourself to rebellion and try to overtake control over the tower, and become the ""boss"" yourself. Tower, in fact, must observe other bunnies and try not to miss any sneaky rambos [described in a previous sentence]. Not to say, you can't figure who is who unless you want to learn people's personal behaviour and mark them in-mind.

There aren't any critical issues and I didn't happen to meet anything what could distort my experience even slightly. For the mechanics, rabbits are moving really slow while map is rather big, but such does the tower, which only has a tiny illuminated area to see over the map.  Music is neat, controls are intuitive too. There could be some better explanation guide, aside from the starting tutorial, but it's easy enough to figure on your own during your first playthough (harder with bots though, ouch).

So far game is dedicated to reach its full potential only in online mode, and sadly said, it's almost dead by the time. Good part is that there are bots to replace real players, but this way the ""drama part"" of interaction and cooperation within a small group of bunnies goes to the second plan, leaving in most times meaningless world for you to toy with. So, I'd strongly advise you to found a party, or seek for random people on forums, to truly enjoy the game. Also, people say that devs are often present in-game, helping beginners and leading them through sometimes puzzling aspects of the game, which is a nice touch and really good attitude towards community. I am pretty sure too that there are more updates to come, with new modes, items, mechanics and improved AI (and bigger base of players), so that may be the point where you decide to give this game a try.

[h1]Review[/h1] 

OBEY是一个非常特别的多人游戏. 

作者有很棒的点子，在第一次进入商店页面时我也被作者的创意惊艳到了. 可爱的基地和萌萌的小狗，画风更像亲子游戏的设定.

然而作为一款尚在EA阶段的独立游戏，作者要做的还很多.

[h1]Pros:[/h1] 

[olist] 
[*]精致的卡通画风很吸引人. 
[*]游戏体积虽小但是画面很赞. 
[*]BGM诙谐，音效搭配不错. 
[*]作者正在很努力的改善游戏.

[h1]Cons:[/h1] 
[olist] 
[*]作为一款多人游戏服务器实在是太渣了，不仅对大陆玩家不友好，国外玩家也抱怨连连. 
[*]游戏代入感有点差，不花费一些时间你根本不知道这个游戏在玩啥.

The game requires cunning and deception as you're plotting your way to become the richest bunny in the land. While you can set up a local server and play alone against bots, due to the nature of the game you won't get the ""real"" experience until you play it with actual human beings far more capable of treachery than any AI can provide. Also, while not a hard requirement, a microphone is highly recommended to be able to communicate effectively with others.

Being a socially shy person, I find it a lot more fun to play with friends rather than strangers over the net. Due to the game being in early access, the community isn't that big yet and it can be difficult to find partners online outside of planned events so having friends to play with is a definitive plus.

The game still being in development, there are a few issues that I need to mention:
[list]
[*]I have had issues connecting to the online servers, it can be hit-and-miss at times.
[*]The current tutorial is a bit lacking and need to be improved upon to provide a better sense of the game to new players. 
[*]The only way to practice with bots, before you feel like you've mastered the basics and want to try playing with others, is to start a local server. I would like a ""Practice"" menu option that would drop me in a local game with bots.
[*]While having the possibility to run a dedicated server is a definitive plus, I would like to be able to simply host a game from the UI instead of having to manually start/stop an external server.
[/list]

That being said, the developer seems to be active in the community and has been quick to respond to suggestions and bug reports. It's a one-man labor of love.

If you like an original multiplayer game with a strong social element, you should definitively give this one a try.",1449728683,1449728778,True,16,1,0.599053800106048584,0,False,False,True,False,,,

You are in charge of a giant robot, dictator of bunnies across the land...

OR

You are a bunny, with dreams of becoming the giant robot which you Obey.

This is not a single player experience. Visuals are basic but colourful and fitting for the game. The controls are easy to pick up.

Tutorial level gives a lot of information without any other players, and it can therefore be difficult to imagine a game in practice. The inclusion of some AI for tutorial purposes may have been helpful. The tutorial did cover most of the detail of the game though.

Gameplay is fun, however at the EA stage it is difficult to find other players on mostly empty servers.

The community seems friendly, as to the developers. With any luck this game will spend a long time in Early Access to allow the fine points of the game to be polished to perfection. 

I played Crypt of the Necrodancer through the early access stage and the input from the community and openness from the developers was vital in creating what became an incredibly fun and unique experience - one which I have since happily put hundreds of hours into. I hope Obey continues in a similar vain.

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---        

     This game is simple to play but impossible to master. You will never have the same game twice and at this point in Early Access, multiplayer is a must. With that said, I would fully recommend this game to anyone looking for a great time with a few friends.

     The idea is simple, be the first to 10,000 and you win. How you go about getting there is another story. You are a bunny and can either hop around following or disobeying orders as you see fit. You will receive orders from whoever is operating the ""Robot"". If you should choose to do so at any point and are able, you can take over running the robot which will lead to quicker point accumulation.

     I started with the tutorial and then played a round against the bots. I then repeated the above and thought I had it all figured out and was ready for my first game with real players... Boy was I wrong. There is a lot of things not included in the tutorial which you need to pick up in live games with real players. Games with bots (at this point) really aren't the same as with live players. Keeping in mind the game is still in early access, there aren't always a lot of players available for games all the time. The developer (Dez) is around and if he is free, he spends time teaching new players what to do in the game. There is a spectator mode where you can hear the players speaking over the mic and fly around anywhere in the level observing what is going on and I fully recommend taking advantage of this feature.

     The game is very polished in its current state and with Dez continuing with updates and hopefully adding new features this game promises to be great when it makes it out of early access. Maybe new animals which have unique abilities and different game modes (I think that I was already introduced to a new game mode during the last event) will make this game even greater than it already is.",1449616923,1450828096,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The various in-game rules are what's left to be finished, but you can enjoy the game already. Its weakness tho is that it's online only, and although there are bots, they are mostly to fill servers up, and so playing with them alone is not viable.

Obey is simply a game about power. Big deal, you might think, any videogame involves power. True, but Obey pares it down to its most important aspects: what one does to acquire and maintain it, and what other people have to deal with. Due to this, the game is designed to be played live against other people, and there's no single player. Although there are bots, they are mostly to fill servers up, and so playing with them alone is not viable.

Every players starts being ""created equal"", as a harmless bunny capable of little more than carrying and dropping items, and you mission is to amass a pre-determined amount of cash. Somewhere nearby them is a massive, weaponized tower, as the stand-in for Authority. It's the prime source of cash, and it makes itself felt in that most primal form possible: violence. Oh, and of course, only one lucky rabbit gets to control over. You can see where this is going.

The player commanding the tower (Robosaru) can just plain kill every other bunny with little effort... except there's no point in that, as they can work for him and help him get money faster. Either with the threat of violence or financial incentives, the enemy bunnies are exploited in order to make the Robosaru player richer. But of course, that player most likely won't rule forever, and can lose his Authority if he doesn't pay enough attention to hi unwilling subjects.

And here we have the most interesting part. Each bunny not already in the Robosaru can choose to be a loyal little worker, or try to sabotage and overthrow him. Players who choose the latter can skulk around the map and use various items to hamper the ruling bunny's flow of riches, and similarly, loyalists might get a reward by acting against a rebel. Or he might not. It's all up to the Robosaur's occupant, really. He can be ruthless or relatively benevolent, and the other bunnies might exploit that.

Because of this social element, voice chat is very important (altho players can use text messages), allowing the ruler to better express his wishes, and other bunnies to ask for favors. It might not look like much, but these conversations are essential to keep the game dynamic, and not allowing a single player to hog the Robosaur. Add to it a variety of items (laser fences, landmines, ammo for the Robosaur etc.) and the power relations can get complex.

It's only real drawback at the moment are the lack of players, but that's something that ebbs and flows. Overall, a very clever experiment on powermongering.",1449465360,1449465360,True,3,0,0.478654593229293823,0,False,False,True,False,,,

[*][u][i][b] Gameplay [/b][/i][/u] – The game is meant to be played with players and not with A.I.s. At the start of the game, everyone is spawned randomly around the map, and must race to the tower. Whoever gets in first, will be the leader and the one who everyone should obey to... Or not. The main objective of the game is to earn the highest money at the end of the round. If you were unfortunate to get into the tower first, you now either obey the leader or sneak your way in to the tower to gain supremacy. 

[*][u][i][b] Environment and Design [/b][/i][/u] – It seems that the game only features one specific sandbox map all throughout the game. And the graphics are simple but don't let that fool you, as this game

No, this game is about showing who's the boss and make other players obey you... And then you shoot those who aren't following your orders.

Pour gagner il faudra manipuler les autres joueurs et réussir à les contraindre à œuvrer pour notre compte. Ce concept ambitieux sur le papier est-il aussi réussi une fois entre les mains des joueurs ? [/i]

Obey est un jeu multijoueur riche et complexe qui nécessite un temps d'apprentissage avant de pouvoir être pleinement apprécié. Un tutoriel détaillé (et en français) est le bienvenu et permet de familiariser le joueur avec les règles de base du jeu et avec les objets qu'il pourra utiliser lors d'une partie. Malgré tout c'est en jouant et en se confrontant à de vrais joueurs que l'on comprendra pleinement l'utilité de tous ces items et le potentiel stratégique du jeu. 

Vous commencez l'aventure en tant qu'un petit lapin, fragile et vulnérable face à l'énorme robot qui surplombe le terrain. Après une course contre les autres lapins pour s'emparer du puissant robot vous allez devoir, si vous échouez à mettre la main sur ses commandes, vous plier à ses ordres. Pour gagner il vous faut atteindre 10 000 pièces que vous obtiendrez en récoltant les objets déposés par le vaisseau et en les apportant dans la boîte du robot. Selon le bon vouloir de ce dernier vous serez payés 25,50,75 ou 100 pièces par objet. Obéissez et travaillez pour le robot ou alors essayez de le renverser en entrant par la porte en dessous de lui. Lorsque vous entrez dans le robot vous gagnez plus d'argent et vous pouvez manipuler les lapins pour que ceux-ci travaillent pour vous tout en se combattent entre eux. La manipulation est au cœur du jeu et à ces fins il est quasiment impossible de jouer sans micro. Il faut que les joueurs communiquent et élaborent des stratégies pour que tout cela soit intéressant.   

Pour commencer passons en revue les objets qui seront utilisables durant une partie. [list]
[*] [b]Mines[/b] : Uniquement visibles par le robot une fois placées par un lapin, elles tueront toutes les petites bêtes s'en approchant.
[*] [b]Capteurs[/b] : Les capteurs alertent le robot lorsqu'un lapin passe à proximité.
[*] [b]Collier[/b] : Chaque lapin qui porte un collier est facilement identifiable par le robot grâce à l'icône orange au dessus de lui. Celui qui n'en porte pas peut être considéré comme dangereux puisqu'il pourra tenter une évasion. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569353472 En le portant le lapin gagne plus d'argent à chaque objet déposé dans la boîte du robot mais il est aussi très facile à éliminer car ce dernier peut auto-détruire les colliers. De plus, un lapin ne pouvant que porter trois objets au total, le collier qui compte déjà pour un objet lui demandera de faire plus d'allers-retours stock-boîte. 
[*] [b]Pointeur[/b] : Utilisé par un lapin il permet de pointer une position au robot. Idéal pour les filous qui font une alliance avec le robot et qui veulent dénoncer les lapins qui tentent de sortir des sentiers battus.
[*] [b]Lampe[/b] : La lumière de ces lampes rendra la tâche plus difficile aux lapins qui tentent une évasion.
[*] [b]Murs laser[/b] : Une fois placés ces murs grillent tous les lapins qui les touchent. [/list]
Tous ces objets ne sont utilisables que par les lapins qui vont les placer pour faciliter leur avancée en mettant des bâtons dans les roues des autres ou alors pour se faire bien voir aux yeux du robot et obtenir une récompense pécuniaire pour bon comportement. C'est au robot qu'incombe la tâche de faire obéir ses sbires, à lui de forger une alliance pour que ces objets lui soient utiles mais les lapins peuvent aussi décider de s'en servir de leur plein gré, les uns contre les autres.

Il existe d'autre part des objets que vous pourrez vendre en déposant dans la boîte du robot. Ces objets ont tous différents prix et bien que vous pourrez aussi vendre les objets évoqués ci-dessus, ceux que je m'apprête à évoquer sont uniquement à usage du robot. Celui-ci peut en commander et attendre que les lapins les lui remettent. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569353532 [list]
[*] [b]Uranium[/b] : Un objet basique qui rapportera jusqu'à 100 pièces au lapin et 300 pour le robot.
[*] [b]Carburant[/b] : Ce carburant permettra d'alimenter le lance-flammes du robot.
[*] [b]Roquette[/b] : Le robot pourra tirer des roquettes destructrices sur les pauvres lapins. 
[*] [b]Batterie[/b] : Si le robot dispose de batteries il pourra activer les sentinelles qui électrocuteront les lapins s'approchant de sa porte. [/list]
Remarquez l'ironie dans le fait que vous fournissez vous-même au robot des armes qui pourront être retournées contre vous.

Le robot dispose de diverses commandes qui lui permettront de donner des avertissements aux joueurs ou de les payer. Pour éviter de devoir payer individuellement chaque lapin qui apporte des objets il peut mettre en place un paiement automatique (visible par le nombre de flèches vertes au dessus de la boîte, une flèche égale 25 pièces). Il doit toujours être vigilant et surveiller les lapins qui évoluent à ses pieds pour éviter d'être renversé.

Obey étant un jeu très riche je ne pourrais pas parler de toutes les stratégies possibles mais voici un avant-goût de ces possibilités.[list]
[*] [b]Lapins VS Lapins[/b] : Les lapins s'occupent d'acheminer les objets vers la boîte du robot et devront se méfier les uns des autres car leur paye peut être volée lorsqu'elle apparait ! Ils pourront placer des pièges pour éliminer des adversaires et œuvrer chacun pour leur propre compte.
[*] [b]Lapins VS Robot[/b] : Les lapins peuvent faire une alliance et se liguer contre le robot en effectuant des actions qui lui porteront préjudice au niveau financier (faire crasher le vaisseau contenant les objets que le robot a achetés, placer le corps d'un lapin dans la boîte, éteindre la centrale électrique du robot...etc). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561909620 [*] [b]Alliance lapin-robot[/b] : Un lapin peut demander de l'argent en échange de renseignements. Il va donc dénoncer tout lapin fuyard et avertir le robot lorsqu'un lapin s'approche de sa porte. [/list]
Il existe bien d'autres stratégies qui seront surtout réalisables à l'aide d'un micro comme leurrer le robot en criant qu'un lapin s'approche de sa porte et ainsi s'échapper lorsque son attention est détournée...etc. Les seules limites sont votre imagination et votre machiavélisme. 

Graphiquement parlant, le jeu est simple mais pas vilain du tout. Les lapinous sont adorables et paraissent réellement minuscules face à cet imposant robot. Le thème musical du jeu est vraiment bon mais la musique, absente lors des parties, manque réellement et permettrait d'accentuer l'ambiance de tension qui règne. Toutefois n'oublions pas que le jeu est toujours en accès anticipé et que ce genre de choses peuvent encore être améliorées.

Vous l'avez compris, le potentiel stratégique d'Obey est grand et fait de lui un jeu riche, complexe et très agréable à jouer lorsque l'on trouve des joueurs en ligne. Car c'est bien là son problème, il y a peu de joueurs en ligne et il reste à l'heure actuelle assez compliqué de se rendre compte du plein potentiel du jeu au vu de la fréquentation de ses serveurs. Malgré tout, Obey est déjà très complet et prometteur pour un jeu en accès anticipé et on voit directement que le développeur a été ambitieux en réalisant un tel projet basé sur la psychologie et la manipulation entre joueurs. Un projet qui aura clairement besoin d'une communauté pour vivre.

Great idea, great execution, great fun! Best EarlyA game I've played so far!
*** Note: Headset strongly recommended! ***

Well here we have an Early Access game that acually feels finished and bug-free! And the store page doesn't lie: Obey is unlike any other game.

It's a bizarre marriage of co-op and PvP at the same time - and it's hell of fun! It's both fooling around, and trying to win. Although the mechanics are fairly simple, and kind-of ""easy to learn, difficult to master"", there is no single ""will always work"", golden road to victory - depending on the situation, different strategies can work.

Simply put, being a good bunny earns you cash, being the boss earns you more. Any bunny can be boss - if you manage to enter the ""bosstower"" alive! Bunnies make cash by feeding items to a dropbox, and can hurt the boss by feeding it trash. So you have to be a smart boss, or the bunnies will ruin you. On the other hand, the boss has a chaingun. As a bunny, your only weapon is: acting smart. If you are a smart bunny, you might win even without being the boss.

The first player to reach $10.000 wins. All this, while voice-chatting with the others.

It's about timing (but not FPS reflexes), and knowing when to work together, and when to screw the others - and about the enjoyment while doing so :) Sneaking up on the boss is so much fun, as is fooling around with other bunny mates, trying to steal their pay...

I wish there was a free demo, everyone should try this!
Highly playable, I didn't encounter any bug so far.

The price tag is a little high - I assume because the dev wanted a small, interested community while in EA. I feel like this is more of an $8 game - that said, the 4-pack is worth it if you have voice-chat multiplayer friends. If this is on sale, don't hesitate!

Obey a shining example of how a little team (1 guy!) can make a game that works, without resorting to season DLCs and other shenanigans - if they have a good, realizable idea, and follow it. This is the most complete Early Access game I've come across so far, and the only one that feels finished. But I kinda hope it stays EA, and the dev keeps working on it - even little tweaks spice things up in this game.",1449276348,1449276348,True,8,0,0.555304944515228271,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Meanwhile, there's a giant robot -which is controlled by one of the bunnies- that ""employs"" the rest of the bunnies. The player can choose to obey the robot or try to overtake his or her position. So basically that's the concept. 

I had to play the tutorial a few times just to learn the ropes, because there are quite a few mechanics and I'm not used to multiplayer-only games... and then I found out that there weren't any players online. This has happened the three times I've tried the game, but I may have had bad luck. Luckily, there's a bot system that works pretty decently, so it's not like you can't play... but it's certainly not the way the game was meant to be played, I guess. 

It's kind of fun though. The game itself is based on a cool idea and the implementation is not bad. The graphics are also quite outstanding for an indie game, I specially liked the robot. The way the giant robot looks from the point of view of our bunny is truly imposing.

The price is still quite expensive in my opinion, but once it gets a proper sale price, I guess it would be really cool to play this game with a few friends after buying the 4-Pack. 

And well, I'm not sure what other features will be implemented in the future, but the game is quite playable already. I would like, for example, to have a sprint key or being able to hide the bunny underground or something. I haven't played for too long and I already felt it was sometimes too repetitive to go from one place to another carrying stuff just to be annihilated the moment I stepped out of the ""delivery path"" (yup, the bots are pretty smart)

I also think it would be cool if the robot had some kind of massive speaker and if it gave its orders through pre-recorded audio, rather than text. I think that would be a cool way to implement a bit more of humour into the game and for players to understand the game earlier. I mean, if I had heard ""Bring me more uranium, or die!!!!!"" I would have known right away what I had to do. The bots kind of already do that already through text, but I'd like to see it more often and, if possible, with audio. Just some suggestions. 

I'll definitely come back once more things are added to the game. Specially recommended to those that really enjoy multiplayer games in which you have to interact a lot with other players, be aware though that there aren't too many people online, so be sure to bring your friends with you!

This game is truly hard to describe and easiest to way to describe it that one bunny has an armored mech with huge arsenal and other bunnies try to take it on by various means. And by various means both from mech and bunnies there are mind games involved so mic is really recommended for this game. The goal is to make 10000 points (and mecha bunny gets 10x more than regular bunnies per second). Mecha bunny can either shoot or ask the bunnies to OBEY them to fill various tasks and bunnies can either walk onto mecha bunny's entrance and they then get it, but it is easier than done :)

This game takes a while to get accustomed to but when you ""master"" it you find yourself with tons of fun! Cel Shaded graphics style fits this game nicely. Sounds are nice but ingame music has some catching up to do.

[*]Multiplayer only.

This game is nothing like I’ve ever played before. You either play as a harmless bunny or a killer robot. 

As a robot you command a bunch of bunnies (vocally or via text/on-screen commands). Bunnies have to bring you (robot) ammo, fuel, batteries, etc and do tasks like building defenses around you. You reward them by paying salary. 

As a bunny you must [b]obey[/b] your robot overlord… or not. Robot has a “money generator” and you can sabotage robot’s income by turning generator off. There are other ways to ruin robot’s day. Most importantly, if you are sneaky enough, you can get inside the robot yourself and become the new overlord :) If you don’t obey and act fishy robot will send you to sweet bunny heaven in an instant. 

It is a roleplaying game in sense that everyone has to play a role (there is no inventory, experience or anything like that). Quality of gameplay highly depends on the ability of players to be able to embrace their roles. Headset certainly makes communication more fun. 

I applaud the developer for trying something unique rather than using Unity engine to make another minecraft clone and I do hope this game becomes successful enough for the servers to get populated. At this moment community is very small and there are barely any people playing.

In each match you start off by playing a Bunny and in the arena there is a large looming tower that can be controlled by one player. You have a choice as to how you choose to play. The player who controls the tower issues commands to the other players and then they can choose whether or not you want to obey (hence the name!) those commands or not. You might want to obey the commands from the tower and play the game that way, or you might try to rebel and take over the tower! 

The game play is very strategic, especially if you manage to get control of the tower. There are a ton of items in the game arena that can be used in different ways and add a huge amount of depth to the game. You'll certainly need to play through the tutorial but this isn't enough really. This is still in Early Access so hopefully the tutorial will be expanded in the future but in the meantime I'd recommend watching some Youtube videos to get a better idea of how it works.

If there was ever a game that WTF could summarize a first impression, this would be it. But not necessarily in the way one might expect.

My ""WTF"" moment wasn't due to anything offensive nor was it due to nonsensical or buggy content. In fact, there's nothing offensive in it, no gore, no bad language. There are  no noticeable bugs, no fps drops, no graphic glitches or crashes.  Instead, my immediate WTF reaction was due to just how bizarre and unique this game is compared to anything else I've ever played...and that's a GOOD thing.

You are one of many in an army of bunnies, attempting to cleverly outwit both other bunnies and the ""master"" bunny (who takes control of a giant, stationary yet deadly robot of death). The object of the match is to merely end up with more cash than your peers. You can do the master bunny's bidding and get paid for the tasks he creates to be completed or become the ""master"" bunny yourself and control the deathbot (which earns you cash more quickly).

Do you simply do what you are told and hope the other bunnies' greed will set them back? Do you work with a buddy to overtake the others and eventually, take control of the giant bot?  Are you willilng to backstab the others or do you insist on working as a team? Do you complete the assigned tasks to gain trust and favor from the mighty bot of doom all the while formulating and employing a master plan to overtake him and weilding the mighty power for yourself?  And if you do take control, who do you trust? Are you paying handsomely for the tasks to be completed to gain favor from your underlings even if it means they may start to catch up monetarily? Are you able to notice when a bunny starts to plot against you? Do you destroy the resistence with your mega machine gun or fry them with nepalm?  All questions that you'll be faced with in this game.

Despite it's cutesy look, it's a very deep, strategic game.

There is a lot of potential here. It's still in early access. Stability wise it seems solid. I think the tutorial could use some help as right now it's more of a text based instruction and it's difficult to remember what everything is and how to use them. There's no much in way of strategy guidance either.

The biggest criticism from me about its current state is the lack of consistent players online at any given time. The weekends seem to be more active of course, but during the week, good luck finding anyone online...at all.

I think easing new players into the game better will retain them. I think better marketing will open up the game's demographic. And if that happens, I think this little gem has the potential to be a sleeper hit.",1448562419,1448562419,True,3,0,0.34562981128692627,0,False,False,True,False,,,

La prima cosa che voglio dire che questo gioco diverso da qualsiasi altro abbiate giocato online, quindi vi consiglio prima di tutto di guardarvi diversi video di gameplay e dopo sono sicuro che vi piacer. 

Le meccaniche di gioco sono un pò complicate da capire ma se giocherete il tutorial riuscirete a capirle abbastanza bene (ma non del tutto), ma solo la pratica online aiuterà realmente. Le musiche e gli effetti sono belle e divertenti, specialmente il salto del vostro consiglio xD 

Adesso il gioco ancora in sviluppo ma a tal proposito vi consiglio di acquistarlo, lo sviluppatore sempre presente con la comunit, e spesso gioca anche lui online e il vostro aiuto sar essenziale!

[b]En pocas palabras:[/b] Si hay algo que define a un buen juego es la diversión y sobretodo cuando es compartida. Y este juego lo logra a las mil maravillas, por encima parece ser simple, apoderarse del robot y mantener a raya a los conejitos para obtener más ingresos y ganar, pero en el fondo hay mucho más pues no se trata de tener más puntería sino de tener cerebro para colaborar, liderar, manipular, engañar y sacar partido de cada acción que realicen los jugadores incluyéndonos. Este aspecto de interacción social a través del micrófono, chat y ordenes en el juego, es lo que lo hace tan divertido. Si bien la curva de aprendizaje puede ser algo lenta con el tiempo se va ganando la confianza para ser estratégicos al momento de jugar.

En el aspecto técnico el juego esta muy bien y no me ha presentado errores a pesar de ser de acceso anticipado. El diseño es simple pero bueno, el sonido cumple su función y los menús son claros en su mayoría. Jugando con teclado no tuve ningún problema y se comporto bien a nivel de FPS.

Este es un juego que todo el mundo debería probar alguna vez, puede que no les guste a todos, pero a los que sí, les gustara muchísimo, y quedaran enganchados.

[b]Pros:[/b] La mecánica de juego es increíble, mezcla elementos de shooter (podemos dispararle a los conejitos), estrategia (se debe gestionar nuestros recursos), rol-social (podemos asumir toda una actuación si queremos para interactuar con los otros jugadores), teniendo en cuenta que cada juego es siempre distinto porque depende de las acciones de los jugadores.

El desarrollador esta muy comprometido con el juego y la comunidad alrededor de este, así que es seguro que el juego terminara muy pulido y con grandes mejoras a parte de las que ya tiene.

[b]Contras:[/b] Al ser un juego que requiere interacción social es obligatorio tener la capacidad de poder tratar con otros, y en ese sentido a veces es posible que encontremos barreras como el idioma.

Lastimosamente hay poca gente jugandolo ahora mismo pero supongo que va a ser algo que cambiara con el tiempo, porque sin gente no hay juego (se puede jugar con bots pero no es lo mismo).

OBEY is a very fun cooperative (or should I say uncooperative) multiplayer game. I originally had mixed feelings about this game due to a relatively poor tutorial, but once I managed to understand how OBEY is truly played, it became a blast. The two-faced style of gameplay can lead to some hilariously memorable moments. A couple words of advice before purchasing this game. The player base is still relatively small, and that is something that can only be remedied with you and your friends’ help. The purchasing format heavily discounts a 4-pack purchase. If you decide to go in on OBEY, I would recommend getting some friends in to help with a 4-pack purchase.

[h1]First Impressions[/h1]
----11/25/2015----
There are two positions you may take part of when starting the game. You may play as a cute little bunny, scheming, plotting and looking for ways to overthrow the evil overseer controlling the robot of doom while maintaining a very obedient front in order to survive. Alternatively, you may play as the evil overseer controlling the robot of doom ensuring that those lying little devious monsters do your bidding. The main actions that the robot can take include killing the bunnies, deactivating hidden mines to help the bunnies stay alive, change pay scales in order to incentivize the bunnies to give you certain supplies (needed for ammo/security) etc. The main actions that the bunnies can perform include purchasing and feeding supplies to the robot, setting up security for the robot, warning the robot of bunnies making a break for the robot control room, or make a break for the robot control room.

Coordinating is much easier using a microphone. Although there are forms of communication without it, warning the robot of bunny locations can be difficult.

[h1]Current State of the Game[/h1]
There were no noticeable bugs found in my short play through, however there are couple important suggestions I feel if implemented will help improve the gameplay.

[b]Suggestions:[/b]
[list]
[*] Include basic strategies in the tutorial/provide a better understanding of the actions you can perform as a bunny/robot. It took a few gameplay videos to get the grasp of how to play
[*] Improve communication options for those without a microphone
[*] Make a cute little introduction cut scene/animation explaining the bunnies’ predicament

3 A single game is very long and boring if you play with the bot because all other players leave the room.

But the idea is pretty original so someone can like the style of the game,this is not my kind of game so i'm giving a negative reviews but maybe you can apprecciate more than me!

There is a learning curve to understanding every concept that it throws at you. You can either play in this huge bot that can ask the bunnies running around to OBEY and trust you, so you won't shoot them. But they can also lie to you and trick you into thinking they will help you and take over the robot. 

The whole goal is to get to 10,000 points, depending on how you pay out using the robot or by getting paid as a bunny on the battlefield; it can get really tricky. Using a microphone is part of getting the most out of this game, since you can talk to everyone on the server and potentionally give them tasks or they can tell you something, and bamn, they either will subvert you or go with what you ask. But only one player can win, and that is whoever achieves 10,000 points. 

I recommend this game with a small con against it, it's tutorial is simple and may need more polishing and a little more handholding to give you a better understanding of the game before you start playing on a live server. It tries to break down what each mechanic does, but it's not in depth. This is a social game and you can play with bots, but the most fun is when playing with real players. 

The game also has it's charm, since you can either play a bunny or a huge bot that kills the bunnies or helps them. Overall I think with some more polish on the tutorial and a bigger player-base this game has all the qualifications of a fun multi-player only game. 

Also Dez (the developer) really wants to help the community either learn his game and/or get feedback to better his game and get the most out of his project. I will definitely be coming back to this game as more patches and more content gets in place.

Unique gameplay. Grab a copy, grab some friends and have some fun. Word of advice, do not OBEY!

Use mumble, teamspeak and whatnot. It forced me to grab my headset and interact with friends again. It's always makes me smile to hear someone laugh on the other side of the headset.

It has one of the best concepts in a game that I have ever seen - it just needs polishing. As with most indie multiplayer-only games (there are bots but the experience is not the same), it is often difficult to find a match when it has just joined the market recently and is early in development. But I can say the games I have played were very fun. I've only had it for 2 days and have played 10+ hours already.

The main objective of the game is to earn the most money, and whoever gets to $10000 (default) first wins the match. Each person controls a bunny, and one player controls the robot (or ""robosaru""). The robot has a range of weapons and must force the bunnies to give him more ammo, more money or snitch on other players in return for cash. The robot however earns cash must more quickly and easily than the bunnies, so to prevent them form winning the bunnies must try to sneak into the robot's door and take it over without the robot noticing.

There are much more elements of this game that play large roles in deciding who wins, such as lying, deception and other psychological and game aspects.

The game has quite a steep learning curve, and the tutorial is not very clear, but the developer (who seems very nice ;) ) is often on the servers teaching people how to play and develop strategies. That's how I learnt anyway.

The game does recommend a microphone, but so far I've done quite well without using mine all the time - maybe only using it once or twice to give long commands.

One big issue I have been having is the game having a 19/20 chance of crashing when i connect to a server. This has been found to be a problem with unity and the dev says if they do not fix it soon then he will make a workaround.

Definately consider buying this game, or at least following it to see how it develops :)",1448298231,1448298231,True,4,1,0.547325074672698975,0,False,False,True,False,,,

This is a very unique multiplayer game. You are a bunny, that is trying to gain control over a huge dictating robot on the map. Once in control you try to convince other ""bunnies"" (players) to follow your orders. You win by collecting the most money.  But beware for some bunnies might disobey you and will try to take control over the robot themselves, so be on your guard. 

Any bunny can take control over the robot, by just entering the front door, but when you control the robot, you have a few weapons at hand to protect yourself, like a flamethrower, sentries and a minigun. The downside is that other bunnies supply you with ammunition for these weapons.

It doesn't mean that you can only win the game by entering the robot, you can even win by never setting foot in it, by cleverly picking what materials to deliver to the feed box. Not every player that controls the robot is vicious or cruel, some might rule with a benevolent spirit and choose to share the wealth with the hardworking bunnies. That's what makes every game completely different and utterly fun.

This game has so much depth, just writing a mere review doesn't do it justice, it should be experienced from first hand by playing.

This game is just a big mindfak. Who can you trust?

I'm not saying that it's bad, it's an innovation to have a game based on social communication between players, in other words, the ""team"" that communicates better, has a better chance to win.
The tutorial explains all in a very dynamic way, and it's a must for you to start playing, i tried online right away, was totally lost.
It's advisable to use a mic to communicate, and thats easy to understand, you're busy playing, not writing.
I liked the concept, but for you to have the full experience you need to interact with others. Like i said, not against that, but would prefer for example, a single player mode, or a 1v1 game mode, for those who do not enjoy to play with other, or just those who want to practice alone.

Still, fun game, not many bugs for early-access, hope to see, like i said, a single player mode, or 1v1 mode.

The graphics are cute (Those bunnies!) Sound effects aren't bad, it doesn't have much music but it is pretty catchy.

The gameplay itself can be great or bad, since you are often at the mercy of strangers, and sometimes they just like to kill bunnies (kinda wish there was something we could do to stop this)

По смыслу очень простая игра: есть мультиплеерная сессия, побеждает набравший самое большое количество очков (в данном случае - денег). Самый козырный способ это сделать - сидеть в большом роботе (у вас увеличенный прирост очков и несравнимая с прочими игрокам в данный момент огневая мощь). 

В роботе вы можете заставить (предложить) других игроков работать на вас, прочих можете убивать. И получать автоматическую прибыль от электростанции.

Вне робота вы можете сжигать предметы, разбросанные по игровому полю, в печке, получая очки. Или попытаться занять место того, кто в роботе.

    [*]У всех персонажей кроме того, кто в роботе - очень мало возможностей: вы можете медленно перемещаться по игровому полю и носить по 3 предмета - всё.
    [*]Я не люблю подчиняться. Если в мультиплеерной игре у удного из игроков заведомо есть чудовищное преимущество перед вами, то это просто начинает раздражать.

Садясь за игру в свободное время хочется одного - получить удовольствие от процесса. Мои друзья ценят в играх примерно то же самое, поэтому я не думаю, что игра понравится и им.

[b]Short Version:[/b] Unusual multiplayer game featuring diplomacy and negotiation alongside stealth and strategy.  Conversing with your opponents is practically required, so beware purchasing if your rig lacks a mic or you don't enjoy, you know... talking.  Otherwise, have fun playing as Little Bunny FooFoo hopping through the forest, jumping into the giant killer robot of doom and extorting money and guns from all your little bunny friends via bribery and threats of flamey death! 

OBEY is a remarkably strange, fascinating game with a steep learning curve.  The tutorial is an absolute must, and even that doesn't cover all the tactics involved - although hopefully this will be improved before the game's final release.  The game is also multiplayer only, so if you prefer sticking to single player games, you can skip this game (and the rest of this review).

Remember those ""friendly""(ha!) tabletop sessions of Risk where you tried to convince good ol' Bob spread across Asia that it was completely in his own interest to invade Canada in order to wipe out Evil Overlord Fred, all while you hunkered down in Austraila peacefully hoarding billions of troops to win you the game a few turns later?  Or that one game of Monopoly where you convinced your little sister that giving you a monopoly on Boardwalk and Parkplace in return for Reading Railroad would actually win HER the game in the end?

Well, OBEY is just that; a game of dirty diplomacy and friendly manipulation.  In OBEY, your goal as a tiny, cute little bunny rabbit is to take control of a giant deadly robot with laser-eyes and a flamethrower, then somehow convince all the other tiny, cute - and extremely treacherous - little bunny rabbits that feeding you the money you need to win and the weapons you need to kill them dead is definitely a good idea.

The gameplay smushes together stealth, observation, strategy, and game theory into a 3D world populated by you and all your bunny rabbit friends waddling slowly around and trying to make money, along with one giant killer robot with laser eyes of doom who can make money faster than anyone.  The robot can be taken over by anyone who sneaks inside, but it can also lay the smack down on any bunny who twitches their nose the wrong way -, or 'generously' pay an allowance to the bunnies who play nicely.   To win, you must pay close attention to your surroundings and what every other player is up to, negotiate with - and lie to - other players , and above all not aggravate the giant robot with laser eyes of doom before you can shuffle your cuddly little bunny butt inside to kick out the current occupant and take it over.

All in all, if you have a microphone and sometimes like thinking, strategizing, and negotiating in your games instead of the usual run-n-gun, I recommend you give this quirky game a shot.  However, this comes with a strong 'buyer beware': as with any multiplayer game, enjoyment depends on the people you play with, so you will need to bring friends or be OK relying on random strangers (who hopefully speak your language and have mics of their own).  

---

Note:   Due to the social nature of the game, you may want to split a 4-pack with friends.  If that doesn't work for you, at least the developer seems to be quite active and doing his best to help people learn the game, so it seems likely that even games with strangers will be fun.   Of course, keep in mind that OBEY is in Early Access, so it is difficult to tell how popular it will be down the line, and how easy it will be to find quality random matches.  Thus, your final mileage may vary.

Note 2:  The giant killer robot of doom may not actually have laser eyes.  But it should.

However, you can do stuff to lower the robots score if you dont get caught like dropping corpses in the delivery box. You can also take over the robot, if they dont notice you.

I don't think I can categorize this game into a genre, I haven't played many like it
I guess it may resemble arena games a little; the game requires a mix of social skills, strategy and decision making, although a bit of luck won't hurt.

In this game, you're mostly a small rodent - except when you aren't. Your purpose in the scary little world you're in is to follow orders - except when you'd rather not. Sounds a little confusing I suppose. But basically you could be an obedient little worker bee and keep big brother happy, or you could pretty much do anything you want as long as you don't get caught. Talking to the other players in this game is a big part of the experience, and the push to talk and push to mute options built into the game work very nicely. The atmosphere created by the dark environment, the flood lights, and the rodents fragility is Orwellian, I found myself thinking about old school Sci-Fi books. The Robot is a lot like big brother, something in the game also kept making me think of Asimov, though I'm not sure what. On the whole the game is very good at pulling you in, just alt tabbing from it feels like you're going to another world.

That said, it's not easy figuring out what you want to do in the game, and if you ignore the tutorial like I did (you really shouldn't), you'll just find yourself working like an obedient little sheep, and you'll miss out on all the hidden little things you can in the game. (Tip: try crashing the carrier, the little marshmallow in a campfire explosions are worth it)
Techinically the game has a goal and a win condition, but it's not enforced, and I like that.

but what is it all about? Well, it' a VERY asimmetrical game, with a lot of complex and original mechanics: 
you are a bunny, to win you have to make 10.000 cents, in each map in obey there's one robosaru, a HUGE robot/turret equipped with a machinegun, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower. when you enter the robot you earn 10 cents per second, when you're not in the robot, you earn 1 cent per second. any bunny can enter the robot at any time and take his place, by entering the door located exactly in front of him, so there will be a constant war between the bunnies trying to enter the robot, and the bunny inside the robot trying to defend himself.
As a robot you cant' just kill bunnies randomly, as you NEED them alive to drag and drop items into the ''feed box'', as it is the fastest way to earn money.
So, as a bunny inside the robot you have to create your ''dictatorship'' by controlling all the bunnies that they're doing their job, you can give them money, warnings, make them  wear the ''loyality collar'', wich will be always displayed in the HUD of the robot, to be sure of the positions of all the bunnies, and if they disobey, well, it's your choice >:D 
So the bunnies have to sneak very carefully from the working location to the robot's door without being caught if they want to became the ''bunnylord''.
There are another couple of mechanics that i didn't explained, like the generator, the corpses, laserwalls...

“The great video game OBEY is a social experiment: To what degree are players willing to act against their own will in order to prevent somebody else's victory?” 
Zeit Online 

“...this is a tense, fast-paced King of the Hill-type encounter where the balance of power is constantly shifting and is not always in the hands of the only person with actual weaponry.” 
Hardcoregamer 

“Simply put, OBEY is one of, if not the best, multiplayer games I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing” 
Indiegames 


""Obey is quite an original project in the Steam early access Developed by Dan Dez. Here we find ourselves in the skins of fluffy white rabbits.

So, what's the whole point of the game? Quite simply, for the victory you need to collect as much gold. In this hard deal, we got help of large cannon that is located in the center of the map. Naturally the one who gets to the gun can do all that he wants, and will receive 10 times more gold. At high firepower of weapon, we can made to work the entire island for us. Of course, you can overthrow the ruler rabbit and take his place, but it will be relatively difficult. This is the whole point of the game."" ~D1zo


""A fairly unique multiplayer game of being a Bunny and trying to take control of a giant gun and earn power and money using a combination of honesty, deception, obedience, mutiny, servitude, manipulation, lying, cheating, stealing and all the other C.V. ruining human traits. It's the first Steam release from an American developer with a brief history in game art and development, and comes with a unique mix of gameplay elements which sometimes make for really interesting player interactions and psychological situations.

After playing for just a couple of days I found myself beginning to analyse people mid-conversation in my day to day life, wondering if they were lying to me about trivial things for monetary gain, half-expecting them to hide in a piece of furniture and rush at me when I wasn't watching. It's a game which undoubtedly gets in your head when you play too much."" ~Dux0r

”Kneel down my fellow minions, thou shall obey to my rules and live a happy rabbit life. But those who oppose will be crushed, over and over again! Now offer me some uranium and I shall reward you with money and life. Or at least one of them. Wait! What was that? No..No! Krrchhzzz..
I am in charge now! And what I have to say is: Kneel down my fellow…”~Transcript from ingame curtisy of Faust


So in summery this is a great game for both casual and hardcore gamers as well as being quite the brain teaser with the only real weak point in the game being that it is dependent on have a reguler playerbase but seeing as it does and the fact that you are going to buuy this game that is no problem at all.

It's a game which undoubtedly gets in your head when you play too much.

Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with the developer, but did recieve a key.

Consisting of a medium sized map with up to 10 Bunny players, the sole objective in OBEY is to amass as much money as possible, but the methods for accomplishing this vary based on the current player:power scenario and can shift in an instant. One central gun/watchtower called the Robosaru exists per map, a Power Plant which generates money for the player inside the Robosaru, and a Feed Box where Bunnys can deposit items to generate money for the Overlord, and usually make money for themselves in the process.

Whoever commands the Robosaru has a distinct advantage in the form of 10x passive income, and of course deadly control, but it comes at the cost of everyone trying to steal that control either through direct attacks, or by lying, manipulating and sabotaging the Overlord or any combination of their fellow Bunnys in persuit of their own paycheck. Because it becomes increasingly difficult to watch more than a Bunny or two, the Overlord must work together to keep himself safe, similarly Bunnys want to stay alive and profit more, which means that the dynamics constantly change based on how many players are in the game, how much money they have, what they're assumed attitude towards each other is, and what they actually accomplish.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]

At a higher level OBEY about out thinking your fellow players. In the early stages I routinely found myself asking for more money for performing actions, and being a sort of salesman for myself. When I learned that I could cheat my fellow Bunnys by lying about their actions, a new avenue of options opened up. This lack of strict limitation and the utility of psychological warfare via spoken commands and text brings the gameplay to a higher level than simply running around trying to earn money and directly sabotage the current winner, and it's where the game shines.

The visual style is also very worth pointing out. Maps tend to be very simple, and I personally love the low polygon approach to the assets. The animations and movement are also well correlated with the visuals, and having a group of Bunnys all turn their heads to stare at me in the hull of a gloomy-lit ambient Dropship ended up being far more creepy than it rightfully should've been.

[h1]Mistakes and Annoyances[/h1]

Being in Early-Access, technical issues are less of an issue and though I had a few small technical problems every single one of them was mentioned on the development panel as currently being worked on. There are still technical issues worth bringing attention to though, like lag and server drops which are common. The server console is fairly flat and bland and utilizes an IRC channel which comes with pros and cons, and the server client for hosting your own games is completely unmentioned in game, and I only found it through a mention on the website.
There's also a real lack of options for play just now. There are a handful of dedicated servers with various configurations, and each round has a small pool of maps to select from, but there's currently only a couple of US server and maybe a handful in the EU, so if your ping isn't particularly good you're probably going to be limited to a server or two at best, and if you're inexperienced or looking for different gameplay types, you're going to be waiting for far too long to connect to a good server.

Which brings up the biggest problem with this title: the lack of players. It's great fun when there are enough people around, and genuinely addictive and intense gameplay takes place, especially with people you know, but currently the community is only really palpable during a very specific set of hours and if you know more than a handful of players then you're unlikely to play with people you haven't mostly already seen. This wouldn't be a problem in most games, but here if you know what to expect from a player or they remember what you did the last few games, there's probably a disadvantage for one of you and a bias towards the same gameplay unfolding.

I expect this game to grow over time, and it's a game more than any other I've found that will become better with a larger community in place, so it's a real problem when there's no effort to grow the player base other than perhaps a Steam group and the developer forums. While the current community is definitely great fun to play with, and well in tune with the spirit of the game, it's still both drastically dependent upon, and lacking in players.

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]

You can pick up OBEY just now for £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 or your regional equivalent, and the 4-Pack option saves you a chunky 40% if you have a couple of friends. As with all multiplayer games, your value for money is subjective based on how much you're likely to play, but when compared to other popular multiplayer titles on Steam, this is priced on the higher end, though it doesn't have in-game purchases or DLC to worry about.

While finding people to play with can be an issue, if you expect the player base to grow then this is a fair buy, and good value for money if you go for the 4-Pack option. If you need a good multiplayer scene then you might want to wait til after release, for a sale, or until the player levels reach a better level.

Здесь мы окажемся в шкурах пушистых и белых кроликов.

Итак, в чем же весь смысл игры? Все просто, за сражения нужно набрать как можно больше золота. В этом не легком деле нам поможет большая пушка которая располагается по центру карты. Естественно тот кто доберется до пушки сможет творить, все что ему вздумается, а также будет получать в 10 раз больше золота. При большой огневой мощи орудия можем заставить работать весь остров на нас. Конечно кроля правителя можно свергнуть, и занять его удобное место, но это будет относительно сложно. Но ведь в этом и есть весь смысл игры.

Obey в первую очередь многопользовательская игра. Для более комфортного времяпровождение необходимо наличие 4-8 человек. Так вот, например, нам удалось стать правителем, что же нам делать? Чтобы обезопасить себя от нашествия недоброжелателей большую часть прибыли придется тратить на покупку оружия и ресурсов. Можно стать беспощадным правителем, что приведет к революции, а можем стать добрым, но тогда нами будет легко манипулировать. Поэтому будет сложно найти некую грань которая поможет нам оставаться у руля робота.

Что касается графики то можно наблюдать, что некоторые фрагменты прорисованы лучше других. В целом же все карты очень даже хорошо проработаны. Саундтрек отлично дополняет атмосферу игры.

В итоге разработчику отдадим должное, он проделал огромную работу. Сама идея проекта уникальна, есть возможность посмотреть кто и как управляет, у каждого человека свой подход к игре. Карты отлично сбалансированы, что позволяет легко ориентироваться лидеру, и руководить.  Если вы хотите испытать что-то новое то пожалуй вам стоит обратить внимание на данный продукт.

Плюсы
- Игра в раннем доступе
- Возможность играть по локальной сети
- Низкие системные требования
- Креативная игра
- Хорошее сообщество
- Наличие русского языка

Минусы
- Мало людей
- Цена немного завышена

The mechanics are solid and keep the game fair and interesting. For any who enjoy community creations, the map editor is very simple to use as well as easy to add your creations to a server. On top of all of that the developer has been very active in the community welcoming any feedback.

The gameplay consists around each player starting as a meager rabbit vying for profit and the end goal of obtaining 10,000$ to win the game. Once the map has begun, the rush to robot occurs. The player who first makes it into the Robot will take control, thus begining his cycle of tyrany. From there, it is the other players goal to overthrow him by reaching the entrance of the robot and taking it for themselves. Both the rabbits and robot have have means to make or even steal money, so it may not be wise to emediatly bet all your eggs on making it to the robot.

In the means of presentation , the game consists of very fluent audio design with a pastel aesthetic to fit. In terms of performance, the game runs at a consistent 60fps (Likely currently capped, as i do not dip over or under). Currently there is not a large community that plays the game consistantly so finding a game may require so wait time and a bit of scheduling to get a larger game.

It is entirely multiplayer as interaction with other players is crucial. It's unlike any other games I've played before and its concept is very well made.
If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.

[h1]What is happening in the game:[/h1]
In OBEY, one player is a leader and controls all the other players from a giant robot. This robot has the ability to shoot bullets and rockets that kill the disobeying players, if the leader sees them and shoots them.
Other players, bunnies, have to listen to the leader. They have to wear tracking collars and carry weapons into the robot's feedbox. The leader pays them for that, but the point of the game is for the bunnies to sneak into the robot and take the leader's position. In other works, you have to obey until you have the chance to hide and sneak to the robot.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]An unique idea that is not just unique, but also well executed. It's very interesting to observe how different leaders have different approaches to controlling other and how players in control respond to their manipulation.
    [*]Maps are well-balanced as they allow the leader to control the players, but other players are still able to take over the leadership if they play well and have good tactics.
    [*]This game encourages interaction between players which includes giving orders, lying, deceiving and betraying other players for money.
    [*]The maps and objects look great. They are simple and modern-looking. Also, the soundtrack fits in very nicely.
    [*]The developer is active and is constantly making new updates to the game.
    [*]This game is also made for Linux and MacOS powered systems.
    [*]There is also a tutorial which explains step by step how things work by walking the player along different objects and stages of the game.
    [*]In case there is a lack of players online, you can also play via LAN.
    [*]Low system requirements.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]At certain hours, there might be a lack of online players. Mostly, however, you should be able to find a running game.
    [*][strike]Tags on Steam also include ""Includes level editor"", but can't seem to be able to find it anywhere.[/strike] Levels can be made using third-party software: [url=http://www.mapeditor.org/]link[/url]
    [*]Sometimes, it's hard to play when a leader is someone without a microphone. I don't know how the developer could fix it, though.
    [*]I feel like the price is a bit high, at least for the current amount of content. There should be more game modes, weapons and maybe some tools for the bunnies to handle, not only the leader. There is a 4-pack with much cheaper price per copy, however.
[/list]

[h1]Suggestions:[/h1]
More players would be much appreciated, but the game is never really discounted a lot. Bringing more players would bring some energy to the community and the developer would have a much easier time getting new ideas and improving the overall impression of the game.

[h1]The final verdict:[/h1]
The idea for this game is amazing and, in my opinion, it is worth supporting the developer, although the price is a bit high for the current amount of content. Interaction with other players adds a whole new level to player experience. This game is really great at making you think how to free yourself while not raising any suspicion and, when you manage to get in charge of the robot, you actually feel rewarded and accomplished.
The game is well made, still missing some options and players, but is overall in great shape. I certainly recommend it.

Cons: I feel like there are more german speaking people the english, but most of the speak english too

Overall, the pros vastly outnumber the cons. Plus it is 15 dollars, 12 dollars now.

Addition: My arm no longer hurts. Obey is now better than ever. Especially with the new updates. If you have 10 dollars, save 5 more. If you have 20 dollars, buy this. Just buy it now. You will never regret it!

Addition november 28th 2015: Several of the negative reviews for this game state that it is dead. But in fact, it is not dead. Sometimes of the day, there arent many players on. So, they leave immediately, when  in reality, people come and go every 10 minutes or so.

Incredibly interesting game, just playing it is fun, once you understand that it is more of a social game frankly, though depending on who is the Robosaru you can also end up with the whole thing being a stealth game in avoiding being gunned down while trying to sneak up. The fun in this game is not necessarily in winning, but in actually playing it too, I feel proud even when I'm just in second or third place, which is perfectly okay with me, there's a few mechanics not explained in the tutorial though.

""Corpsing"" is perhaps the most major mechanic, if you are killed by a laserwall or flames then you will leave a corpse, if you drop this corpse into the feederbox the robosaru will lose a fairly significant amount of money, so it gives incentive for the robosaru to be very careful, oh and it's also possible to destroy corpses by shooting them as the Robosaru, so you don't have to worry about a whole ton of rabbits running corpses constantly, though they probably will try to do so anyway if you give them reason to.

Collars increase your money gain per in-game tick from 2 to 6, and provided you have a kind but controlling overlord, also lets him/her keep easy track of where you are and, if particularly kind, the robosaru might even give you extra money for ratting out runners and such.

Playing the tutorial is heavily reccomended, and do also understand that other bunnies are also people, there will be assholes regardless of what you do.

What an awesome game. I'll get this said early and go into more detail after.
If you like online multiplayer games and want to try one with a twist like no other. 
Then OBEY is a game worth picking up immediately.
I've been playing OBEY for 6-7 months now before it arrived here on Early Access on steam.
I have 100+ hours pre-steam at least. Its been one of the most enjoyable Indie, Alpha experiences I've had.
OBEY has a one man development power house. Who is passionate about his game. He works on fixes and has been updating the game often with fixes and balances pre-steam and that trend continues here on early access. I have seen this game grow into something incredible and its great to finally see it in a place where more will have access to it. 

Lets get onto the game and its mechanics.
OBEY IS an asymetrical multiplayer game. Its not skill based in the way that most multiplayer games are. Twitch reflexes wont help you here. Its more about working out your enemies strategies, their game plans while also working to control your opponents to make them obey you to help you win the game. 
I'll break it down more simply.
It works best 4-8 players in my opinion.
Its in a sense free for all. (altho an alliance system is planned for the future)
So you all start out as cute little bunnies. The goal of the game is to reach $10000 
As a bunny it is difficult to earn money. Thats ok because there is a appartment block sized robot in the map armed with a minigun the size of a school bus.
Now as the robot, which you can enter by walking in a door at its base you will earn money more quickly.
You can call a drop ship. Which will allow you to buy supplies to help you earn more money and defend yourself with ammunition and other items to help you keep control of the robot. The robot is only able to drop these supplies on the map. He has to get the other players to feed him these items. Which will take good leadership and control. A happy bunny is a less likely to subvert you. Now as a bunny. You can choose to either OBEY you're leader or Subvert him.

I have done some videos which will give you a better idea oh how this works.

But yes if you wanna label an number score on it, It'd be 10/10 / 100% / 2 Thumbs Up.

This is even better with friends. 4 Packs are available and recommended in my opinion.
It works really well with strangers also. Its interesting working different people's strategies out.

Having a microphone is very important in this game, keyboard chat can be used but alot of people won't pay attention to it.

[b]Robosuru is life...[/b]

This was a tale about a cute little bunny.
Him and his friends were out in the field one day. Wondering what the purpose of life even was.
Here they were, nomming on grass. And one little bunny wondered off curiously.
He then found what appeared to be a giant robot with an enormous minigun attached to the front. Along with that, arms that when given the correct resources will shoot out missiles. Oh.. And a fuel tank that when given fuel, can shoot out giant bursts of fire towards the given target, or in this case, bunny.
Anyways, back to the story.

This wondering bunny saw a huge metal door that had a little crack in the middle. He stepped on forward as the giant robots light was beaming down at him, making a loud noise. And as he curiously went into the little slit, he then began riding an elevator to the top of the Robot. He realized he was at the robots control center. He stepped up off of the elevator and onto the control platform. He then took control of the giant robot and looked around for his friends, he found them and commanded them to group up together in the middle of the field.
He then saw a button that was marked ""Dropship = $$$$"" and then he pressed it.
Upon pressing it he noticed a countdown timer starting from 60 seconds, he looked out into the horizons and saw a another beam of light. It was the dropship! He knew he could take advantage of this. He saw other buttons marking items to purchase. He bought a few collars to manage his friends as he took full control of the situation. He then bought uranium to make him some money. The dropship finally arrived after counting down from 60 and dropped loads of uranium down onto the middle of the field. The 'drop zone'.
He then ordered the bunnies to proceed loading the uranium into a glowing green box that was marked ""Feed Box"".
At first his old 'friends' refused. They wanted to be paid too.
So the bunny at first raised the auto-pay to 25%. 3 bunnies began loading. A fourth bunny refused to load any uranium unless he was given full pay. 
The overlord robo bunny denied the request, and instead killed him with the minigun and sent him to the dropship.
The bunny was angry and was wanted revenge.. In those 60 seconds of the dropship on it's way back to the dropzone to drop off more supplies, he plotted.. He plotted to uproot the overlord (his old best friend) and take over from there.
You may ask why..
Well. Nobody knows why.
It's just..
In their nature.

The robosuru bought the dropship rebel bunny a pointer and a collar. He offered a deal with the rebel who wanted full pay.
The deal was simple.
If the bunny would watch over the gate in case any other bunnies tried to subvert him, he would pay. Handsomely, might I add. Not as much as full pay, but a lot more than what the other bunnies were making.
The cute little bunny accepted this duty. He grabbed the pointer and put on the collar then went on to being just in front of the robot.
The overlord knew he should be trusted.. As he knew that the bunny would want to be paid more than the rest.
Little did the overlord know that the other bunnies could see just exactly how much money the overlord was making. They got really upset and demanded 75% autopay for turning in uranium and other supplies, such as fuel or rockets.
The robot gave them 75%. The guard bunny was mad at the auto pay and also noticed how quickly the robots money went up every second. By the hundreds.. Meanwhile he'd get paid only a fraction of what the robot made.
So the guard quickly made his way to the gate, only a few feet away and got in. ""Yes! I subverted the bunny and now I can make a ton of money!"" He said, actually squeaking down to the others. He then assumed position and control over the entire robot, the old bunny who was in charge now in the dropship, awaiting arrival.
The new overlord then said ""You. In the drop ship. You will do EXACTLY what I say. No asking for better pay. You are mine now. I own you.""
The bunny knew he didn't have any other choice. He went along with the other bunnies to load up uranium to the feed boxes. 4 bunnies loaded up uranium. Three came back to the drop zone. 1 took off his collar and loaded it into the feed box without the overlord noticing. 
Quickly the bunny who took off the collar ran out into the field while the overlord was watching over the three other bunnies;
He made his way to the front gate of the robot and stepped in.
Only for the cycle to begin once more...

Words can't do justice for this game because you can't truly describe the simplistic complexity or bringing items from the drop off to the feed box. Regardless of where your standing is there is always an undercurrent of tension as you don't truly know who is winning until someone does. On top of the in general fear of the robo there is a fear of teamwork. You can make plans with someone just to have them stab you in the back for extra money. Likewise any comment made during the game could be truthful or a lie to try and get ahead. They could be warning you that someone is going to take control, or they could just be trying to distract you in order to make you lose. One game I decided I would respond to people pretending i was someone else. i ended up confusing the robo so much that on 9 different occasions he killed the player he thought was me and i ended up just getting farther ahead.

[u]Bear with me with this really long review cause this game is really worth it[/u]
(I am sorry for any mistakes I do, since English isn't my native language,Greek is)
OBEY is a really unique game. The goal of the game is to be the guy (or should I say bunny) with the most cash after the time ends, or be the first one to reach 10000$.  There plenty of ways in achieving this. You can get money for helping the Master (a bunny who managed to get into the giant robot), getting bribed by the master to give away your fellow bunnies and their positions, or you can subvert the Master and have all the power in your hands, getting the most money this way. As a bunny there are plenty of ways to subvert the Master (I am not gonna explain each way since you can go and discover them, but the most common technique is the art of deception. You see all bunnies have collars that give away their position, but you can get rid of them behind a rock for example and leave the area, this will make the Master believe that you are behind that rock). As the Master your job is far from easy. You have to keep track of 3 or more bunnies (depends on the players on a server), while trying to make money. Now keeping track of a bunny is really hard, cause the Master can only see bunnies that are on his spotlight, making it impossible to control 3 or more at a time. Last but not least, the developer of the game is only one man, but he is really friendly and is on almost 24/7 to teach new players.
Overall the game is really fun and unique. I believe it's worth every cent. The only bad thing that I found is that there are very few players. Now of course this will change as the game is only 8 days old, but if you are reading this, get the game be part of the fun community and subvert your Master.",1432916959,1432917045,True,8,0,0.565217375755310059,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The very start of a match involves a footrace where every player runs towards the giant robot at one side of the map.  The first person there takes over the robot and becomes the master.  Being the master can be a double-edged sword, because while you do make a ton of money, the bunnies under your heel have many ways to make you lose all of it very quickly.  The best part about this game is that it's very possible to NEVER be in the robot and still win.

One game I was playing, one player was in the robot for the majority of the game.  He had 8,000 points and climbing (you need 10,000 to win) while everybody else was at about 3,000 or less.  I spent some of my points to buy laser walls, an item that sets up a deadly trap that kills any bunny that touches it.  When my compatriots and I were delivered back to the game via dropship after being killed, two of my rivals foolishly decided to make a break for the robot.  While the robot was distracted with annihilating them, I ran into an area the robot couldn't see and set up my trap.

Now, the interesting part in this game is that a dead bunny's corpse significantly lower's the robot's score when delivered to the robot's delivery area.  The robot can get resources (missiles, flamethrower fuel) and points if bunnies deliver items there, but delivering a dead bunny lowers their score quite significantly.  I committed suicide on the trap I had set up outside of the robot's vision about half a dozen times, then delivered my bunny's charred remains over and over.  The guy that was moments away from winning and had been in the robot the entire game now had negative points and couldn't afford to bribe other players into doing his bidding.  Every single bunny in the game (except me) then spent their points to overload the dropship and crash it, which causes dead bunnies to spawn at random points on the map instead of being delivered to a fixed area (at least until the ship is replaced, which is expensive).  Now there was an uprising and the robot changed hands quite a few times.

Nobody found out about my trap and corpse-making machine.  Every single time someone new got in the robot, I destroyed their score and rose through the ranks until I was in the lead.  I never obeyed the robot but I never tried to take over either.  I ended up winning that particular match because I kept committing suicide over and over, then pulling off heists and stealthily avoiding the robot's gaze.

No other game I've ever played offers an experience like that.  This game is phenomenal, and the developer regularly logs in to teach new players about the game (he's also an evil dictator when he's in the robot, don't listen to him).

[h1]So, now to the actual review[/h1]


The game is currently in Early Access, but stable, constantly patched and fixed and perfectly playable.

The game concept is very innovative and interesting,[b] letting you do things that you wouldn't be able to do in real life but would like to do[/b] (threatening, bribing, manipulating, lying in general, denying, negotiating with the other players (""Bunnies"") and so on). 

[b]The goal of the game is to get a certain amount of money before the others do. [/b]There is always one player controlling the giant Robot, controlling weapons that could kill you instantly. But as Overlord (the guy in the robot), you only see what happens in a small area where your spotlight is directed to, and you have to zoom all the way in in order to spot such a small bunny. Just killing the bunnys is not an option in most cases because there would be a respawned bunny knocking on your front door soon. Thus, you will have to effifiencly opress and controll your Bunny slaves to prevent a munity and win the game. If a bunny manages to close to the robot, he will take it over and you will get a little Bunny slave of the mighty Overlord. 

[h1]2 things you should know: [/h1]

1) [b]This game is less about hiding from the Overlord than often assumed.[/b] Of course, you can, but most of the time it's more efficient to earn some money under the eyes of the Overlord.

2) [b]The Overlord is often considered to be ""Overpowered"" and unbeatable once he is in charge. [/b]However, the Overlord depends on the other bunnies' cooperation, an unmarked bunny roaming around on the map is the worst nightmare of an Overlord. [b]Looking for such a rebellious bunny is like searching drawers for money to spend on Steam games during a blackout in your neighbours house. [/b]

##Hey you, you know what that is like, right?
 
Also, the Overlord often only gets second or third, because the Overlord' property like his beloved Dropshit constantly gets wreckt and he has to rebuy it. And he can't even shoot those rebellious, hiding bunnys anymore because he ran out of rockets and has to convince a bunny to get some for him.

[h1]

[b]Some tactics I invented for little bunnies.[/b]


>As a little slave bunny, you could use the goodwill of the Overlord to win the game. 

>You could bribe other players for whatever reason...

>You could be a snitch and tell the Overlord the position of your fellow hiding slave bunnies to eventually get rewarded by him. 

>Yould hide corpses in the bushes near the feed box and drop them into the box when the overlord is not watching.

>Yould lie to the Overlord and confuse him by saying ""there is someone at your door"" or use him to get rid of your fellow bunnies (""he just tried to hide your Uranium behind the rock"" or ""he was stealing my money please do something about it I won't work anymore otherwise"") so on.

You could place some of the unremovable alarm boxes at heavily frequented spots, the continous alarms will annoy the Overlord pretty quickly.

>You could distract him while another one secretly sneaks up to the robot. And after this munity, claim the robot yours because you actually were hiding behind a rock close to the robot all the time and left your collar (detectable by the Robot) behind another rock far away and the overlord thought you were hiding there in the back. 

>You could incite a new player to (unintentionally) destroy the Overlords valuable Dropship and drop corpses into the feed box, essentially stealing the Overlords money while he is occupied with his beloved dropship destroyed by a rebellious bunny who claims it was an accident.

[i]Footage taken ingame:[/i]

[b]”Kneel down my fellow minions, thou shall obey to my rules and live a happy rabbit life. But those who oppose will be crushed, over and over again! Now offer me some uranium and I shall reward you with money and life. Or at least one of them. Wait! What was that? No..No! Krrchhzzz..
[i]I am in charge now! And what I have to say is: Kneel down my fellow…”[/i][/b]

What was that all about right now? It is about [b]Obey[/b], a multiplayer game, presented in plain but solid graphics, that could revolutionize the whole genre with a unique psychological approach. Do you know “Watership Down”? If not, try to imagine a bunch of small rabbits that start on the same map, trying to get control of a robot. You start as one of those small puppies, running for your life to be the first to enter it. If you succeed, you get rewarded with instant cash and the ability to operate the big guy. That means more cash and the power to control the other rabbits. Or not. If you are second, prepare to get fried by sentries...

[b]Talking about cash.[/b] The main goal of Obey is to be the first who gains 10k Dollars. This can be achieved in multiple ways. You get money every “tick”, meaning a certain period of time, after which your money gets a constant boost. Obtaining the robot triples the amount, rabbits with collars get a bit, “nacked” rabbits get even less. The next option is the “Payout”. That means: The player who is in charge of the robot can place money on the map to gather, manipulate or reward his minions. The last option is the Food or Drop Box. Again, the player controlling the robot can set this box to autopay, cashing your bunnies for delivering special items you need to ensure your reign. These Items get dropped by a Dropship, which also spawns killed rabbits. 

Instead of writing a huge text about them, I will just list the items with a small description:

[u][b]List of items:[/b][/u]
[list]
[*]Uranium - The main-resource and moneymaker. Robot buys it for 100, rabbit dumps it (and earns a small auto-pay), robot gets 300 (win-win)
[*]Rockets - Secondary weapon with much impact. Rabbits get hurt even if they are hiding behind obstacles. 
[*]Fuel - Robot needs it to charge its flamethrower. Very useful to kill nearby rabbits.
[*]Batteries - Sentries surrounding the robot only work if they are activated and that costs batteries. Powerful defense. 
[*]Corpse - Not really a traditional item, but If a bunny dies via Sentry or Flamethrower, it leaves a corpse. Taking and throwing it into the Dropbox, makes the “ruler” lose money. 
[*]Sensors - activates if a bunny is nearby.
[*]Collars - Robots “Main-Spy”. Collars are highlighted with yellow triangles on the map so whoever sits inside the Big Guy can easily see, where the minions are gathering. It can be used to trap the robot as well since it still works even if not worn around a neck, the robot can simply detonate every collar he wishes to. Useful for rabbits: Collars grant more money and protect from enemy sentries. If you made it that far..
[*]Lights - Well, lighting an area so bunnies can be seen although Big Brother isn`t watching with his blaze
[*]Mines - Bunnies can plant them, only robot sees them if they are activate and only robot can deactivate them. At least without dying.
[*]Fences - Or Laser fences - Cheap defense since every bunny gets fried upon touching.
[/list]

[b]Talking about Control.[/b]You might think that being a rabbit outside of the robot is a painful and boring destiny. It is not. Politics and weaving intrigues, manipulating your teammates or even the high ruler himself. How to obey for some minutes? Getting presents in exchange for dumping items and betraying your teammates. Or team up with 2 or 3 others, kill yourself with laser fences and let them dump your corpses into the Dropbox, thus blasting rulers gold away. Losing your collar may look the best opportunity to sneak into the robot but no risk without a price. Wearing no collar means getting less money. And what about the high emperor himself? Should he act violently, showing no mercy and run into the danger of getting attacked from multiple sides? Granting a wish might be a good chance to win a follower.

Who needs that robot anyway. My first match was won by a guy that never entered the robot. He always played nice, never taking off his collar. Instead of taking the risk he played after the rules. But not every match is the same and your tactics should be reconsidered every minute to ensure that you are earning the 10k Dollars at first.

[b]Update:[/b][i]Obey has been in Early Access for quite some time now - and I still highly recommend it. There are six maps and the map editor, allowing players to build their very own battlefields for free, ensuring nearly infinite possibilities, depending on the community. It should be said that a microphone is expected. There is a chat available but making announcements, threats or plans with teammates does not only work better through the integrated voice chat, it is also way more funny. That said everybody should be aware of the fact that Obey is multiplayer only. Dex managed to implement decent AI that fills the open gaps. Don`t underestimate CPU-Bunnies! They can enter the robot and feel - nothing!!!

I hope lobbies get filled with more people playing since this game may be good with friends but offers a nice new psychological touch when testing your powers of persuasion with strangers. It is not a game for everybody but not only a new approach in a worn-off genre but also a great example for what indie developers can do - so please show your support![/i]

OBEY is very fun and unique multiplayer PvP game about oppression, obedience, subversion, deception, bribery, and all the other fun things you can never have in real life! ;-) It's highly based on communication, and the social interaction makes every round a unique experience. I strongly (!) recommend using a headset/mic to get the full experience.

Each player in the game controls a cute llittle nameless bunny, and to win the round you must earn money faster than your competitors. 
Per default, the earning rate is the same for everyone, except the one bunny controlling the giant, armed-to-the-teeth robot gorilla in the middle of the map, who earns like 10 times!

So will you instantly go for the robot and try to rule them all? To secure your reign, you will have to spend the bigger part of your earnings to buy weapons and resources and then bribe your competitors into feeding those items into your feedbox, and set up defences.

Be a merciless and punishing ruler, killing everyone who disobeys the slightest, and you risk a revolution...
Be a mild and generous sovereign, and you will be used and manipulated into ultimately losing money faster than your clever subordinates earn, only to be pushed from the throne in a second of inattention by simply walking through the robot's front door.

And then there's of course always the subversive ones, constantly trying to manipulate, sneaking around, outright lying or stealing your money by hiding your purchases or dropping dead bunnies in your feedbox....

I had a lot of fun in the few matches I had so far, and I can highly recommend the game to everyone who wants to experience ""something different"", esp. if you have some close friends to play with. 
Plus the dev Dez is a great guy, constantly present in the chatroom, trying to set up matches and coaching noobs like me or just having a nice talk!",1432281791,1432285059,True,14,1,0.622893035411834717,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Obey brings to the table a fresh approach to the pvp multiplayer experience. The aim of the game is to be the first to achieve a certain monetary goal (usually 10,000 cents) and the means to achieve this goal varies considerably.

At the beginning of each match each player finds themselves in control of a cute little bunny rabbit (a hamster or guinea pig perhaps?). The first player to enter the Robot doorway is the player who gets to control it, thus a race is on. Upon entering the robot the electric sentries will all power up rewarding any late comers with electrocution, there is no second place.

Players earn money in several different ways.

1. Per Tick. Controlling the robot pays the most, wearing an obedience collar pays a little, wearing nothing pays something but not much.

2. Robot Payouts - The player in the robot can drop money wherever he wants in order to reward or manipulate bunnies to obey.

3. Drop Box - The robot can set the Drop Box to autopay on deposit (25,50,75 or 100) in order to encourage the bunnies to deposit items.

Items
'''''''''''""
Uranium - Costs 100 - Pays the Robot 300 when deposited (ie. Robot can buy it for 100, bunny can then deposit it for autopay of 100, robot and player therefore make 100 profit each). 

Batteries - Provides a single charge to the sentry defences whereby the robot, upon activating said charge, will cause all nearby bunnies without a collar to be electrocuted. Bunnies can protect themselves by hiding behind wreckage they drop between themselves and the defence pylon.

Fuel - Ammunition for the the robots flamethrower which is the only weapon which can directly shoot the robot doorway.

Rockets - Ammunition for the robots multiple rocket launcher. The robot can kill bunnies hiding behind obstacles with this.

Mines - Once deployed only the robot can see where they are.

Laser Fence - A deployable fence which will instantly fry any bunny walking into it.

Pointer - Allows bunnies to temporarily mark a location on the map. These are usually used by bunnies who take upon the role of an informant on behalf of the robot against their fellow bunnies.

Sensors - Indicates when a bunny is nearby.

Lights - Keeps an area lit as the robot can generally only see where the searchlight is aimed.

Collars - Obedience collars allow the player in the robot to easily see the location of the bunny wearing it. The robot can also destroy the collar thus killing the bunny whom is wearing it. Collars grant a bunny immunity to the robots sentry defences. They also generate an increased income for the wearer.

Corpses - These are left behind when a bunny is electrocuted or burned and when deposited in the Drop Box they cause the player controlling the robot to lose money.


Players have to decide, moment by moment, how they will play the game. Should they obey the robot and make some money doing so, yet by doing so they empower the player controlling the robot? Should they spend their time trying to subvert the robot whereby they could reap huge gains yet in the meantime not be making much money? Should they inform on the other bunnies or should they perhaps try and corpse the robot? Should they cast dispersion on the other players with subtle comments? Should they tactfully try and create a certain atmosphere amongst the other players? Should they band together with the other bunnies against the player in the lead? Should they lure other players via baiting them to do certain things? The choices are ongoing and dynamic and are only really limited to our cognitive ability.

The game has fully integrated voice chat and therefore a microphone is essential to get the most out of the experience. Players reliant on keyboard only to communicate will be at a significant disadvantage in regards to their ability to influence the other players.


After having played numerous games I emphatically give this title a thumbs up and highly recommend people pick themselves up a copy. This game will definitely bring out the worst in you and at the same time bring a smile to your face as you see the worst brought out in others.

Town of Salem was good, but this is much better. :)

The giant Robot isn't the only player in power: the bunnies can lie, haggle, and masquerade to get what they want. Anything is fair game in OBEY, taking what's not yours, pretending you're working for the Robot and then dumping all his supplies into a creek when he turns away, and even demanding payment for telling the Robot when other bunnies are misbehaving.

Every game is vastly different, as every player brings their own strategies to the table. This is a psychological war, and a struggle to maintain control in a world were everyone wants to stab you in the back.
