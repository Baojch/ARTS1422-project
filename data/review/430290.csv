Shmups Skill Test is definitely a bait title for a game.  

Shmups Skill Test consists of a number of mini games all involving shoot 'em up game play.  You play these mini games, get graded on your performance, and at the end, are given your 'shmup age'.  With younger meaning you're a better shmup player.  Though, I don't know if this is a simple ranking system or does something interesting when you start to get to children ages.  I couldn't get below 40 years.

Additionally, it also offers a breakdown of how well you did the mini games compared to other players.  Which I found a little more interesting, but I also don't know what sort of pool of players I'm being compared to, either.  I mean, I know I'm not very good a shmups... I've played them and my progress, or lack there of let's me know all too well.

Where I think this game could have been good, is if it aided in developing a player's shmup skills.  Something like Gunvein's tutorial.  But without something like that, Radiant Silversword's Cardinal Sins game mode does a much better job of testing a player's shmup skills with a better presentation.  And Radiant Silversword comes with an actual game (Radiant Silversword).  Even SophStar has cadet training section that offers a better set of mini game challenges than the entirety of this game., and it also comes with a really good game.

Ultimately, Shmups Skill Test had a chance of being an interesting name.  But not nearly enough content nor anything to help a player get better at shmups over just playing actual shmups.

And what better way to start with their legacy than Shmups Skill Test. Having clocked in at least seven hours of play, how well does it fare compared to the rest of Steam's shmups?

[h1] The Good: [/h1]

+ The replay value of this game is practically bottomless. No two runs are ever alike, as the minigames in a main run change. One minute you're blasting tanks, the next you're collecting medals. If you're lucky, you might have a 'classic' shmup homage level. And on top of that, the minigames you accomplish can be played individually. There's also leaderboards and a replay function, to archive your efforts and compare yourself to other players.

+ Shmups Skill Test is newbie friendly. No nightmarishly hard difficulty to be had here, as the only minimum challenge is memorizing the minigames and trying to get through the game with a good rating and score.

+ Shmups Skill Test also has multiplayer. Four player multiplayer, no less, like on DariusBurst Chronicle Saviors.

+ The music is good, too. It fits the many minigames present, given how some of them are frantic and borderline non-stop.

[h1] The Bad: [/h1]

- I'm getting this out of the way: Shmups Skill Test only has built-in autofire for limited minigames. Everything else is classic button mashing. This is problematic because some of the top scorers and players have controllers with autofire. Hope you have a controller with turbo, or an external program with turbo function.

- Some of the achievements are easy to understand, while others are archaic and complex. For one thing, there's an achievement where you leave the game, wait a week or so, then come back to the game. Another one has a rare 'quiz' minigame that has to pop up; I haven't gotten that in the many playthroughs of Shmups Skill Test.

- The game doesn't record your age result at the end of a replay. A minor gripe, but still.

Overall, do I recommend this game? Yes. Shmups Skill Test will provide a lot of playtime and longevity, and it doesn't require anyone to be extremely skilled at it to play. And if you have friends, you can play this with them, too. A good, solid purchase for anyone that plays games on Steam.",1635038313,1635038313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

这部游戏核心玩法主要在于测试，而非射击，游戏中将为玩家开启很多射击游戏测试的项目，比如像刚开始的射击坦克，躲避弹幕，将瓶子射进垃圾桶等各种测试项目，这些迷你的小测试着实给了我们另一种射击游戏的体验，当然在你不了解它的前提下，这些方式可能会显得比较突兀，但是却有一定的吸引力，当你很努力的完成每一个测试项目的时候，它会提供一个你的实力评分和你的游戏年龄，这一点还是比较有趣的。但是就我个人而言，这种游戏的设计方式只能提供一次性的新奇程度，到第二次乃至第三次的时候，就会显得不是很有可玩性，你若想玩爽快的那种，我还是建议去购买一个很正式的来玩。

这是一部射击测试类游戏，若是好奇的话，则可以来尝试一下，但你若是想玩那种射到爆那种，我个人则是不建议买这部。

You pick up a game that you should be able to beat, for whatever reason. Either the game is considered very easy, or you know that you've 1cc'd it before and are just rusty. You fail miserably. You fail miserably again. And again. And again. Do you just give up at that point and hang your hat up? No, of course not. You go to play something else to brush the rust off of your skills and to bring you back up to speed. If not for that particular thing happening to me, I would have never picked up this game.

The unique thing about this game, and definitely the draw, is the metrics. You play a randomized series of short games and do your best. The short games are randomized, easy, and usually well explained enough/self evident enough that you can accomplish your task reasonably. Most of the short games are set up so that you lose eventually, the goal is usually to not lose for as long as possible. At the end of the random sequence, you get an evaluation as well as a sort of aggregate ""Gamer Age"" - definitely not correlated with age, as I was able to rapidly get this score a decade below my real age.

The evaluation is generally useful, and it tells you what you need to work on. Moreover, the short games become unlocked for you to play in isolation, so you can perform isolated practice on your skills. This makes Shmups Skill Test into a sort of low-level gym, or in my case a rehabilitative clinic.

It mostly serves its purpose, but isn't without flaws. First, this isn't a game you can play for 30 minutes straight, within reason. The soundtrack contains a number of extremely annoying tracks, and the best tracks are ""acceptable at best."" Second, there are a number of valuable skillsets that aren't trained here - chain building and manipulating different shot types being the biggest two that come to mind.

The graphics look cheap, but proper color choices save this most of the time. Probably the only case where I would claim this might cause a problem are the ball dodge and building dodge games, but it may be on purpose that these games had poor color choices to challenge the player.

Most serious players should be able to get most of the achievements effortlessly, if they're in practice. Someone is going to immediately point out that I don't have even half of the achievements - I am out of practice, obviously. 

This is a game for new players, or old players who have let their skills decay for whatever reason. For those players, I would recommend this game easily, as it is a good way to improve some of the basic skills that a player needs.

Shmups Skill Test is a unique and very interesting shmup that brings together a collection of several mini-games that allow to test and also enhance the ability of shmups lovers in several important aspects for this kind of game, such as dodge bullets and obstacles, collect items, training aim, shoot bombs accurately and etc. Therefore, the game works as a great training tool for improving the ability of the players in shmups and of course also have fun in this process. There are four main modes in this game: [Solo Test] the main mode of the game, in which the system randomly assembles the sequence of mini-games that will appear in sequence on the screen to test the player's skill level and, in the end, provides beyond the score also the age that corresponds to the player's skill, so that the newer, better; [Practice Mode] where the player himself chooses the mini-games sequence that he wants to play, so to improve specific questions that he desired; [Versus] for 2 and 4 players and finally [Challenge / Score Attack] mode. Importantly, the player has at his disposal a great leaderboard online and also has the ability to save replays of games played, and the player can also view replays of other players inside the leaderboard, something always useful for those who want to know and learn the patterns and techniques used by the best players. The graphics of the mini-games are quite simple, but fulfill their role, with several customization options such as filters, screen rotation, image scale and etc. The soundtrack is interesting, fitting well in the various mini-games, including the presence of some well-produced vocal chords. The gameplay is solid, fun and as mentioned very useful for enhancing the skills of shmups players. The controls work well (I used the official wireless Xbox 360 controller and works well both in digital and analog mode). Therefore, due to its unique characteristics, Shmups Skill Test is a very interesting game especially for shmups lovers who want to increase their skills. Below two videos of this game played by me:

I remember seeing and hearing about this a LONG while ago, back before the 360 version came out, and wanting it... but then I just never got around to importing it.   Fast-foward to now, and the whole thing is out, consisting of Exzeal, Trizeal, Minus Zero, and this game, Shmups Skill Test.

Shmups Skill Test is an.... interesting thing.  When you first try it, you're likely to have alot of ""WTF"" moments.  The game hits you with a barrage of funky ""minigames"", each geared towards testing some specific trait/ability that somehow relates to shmups.   In the main game mode, you go through a series of these, randomly chosen from the available minigames in each category.  For example, the first category is always ""overall"", which essentially throws you a mini-shmup, where it's all about dodging, blowing stuff up, all the usual.   The enemies keep coming, and you get points for taking them down.  Simple, right?  Well, the rules change after each round.  The next round might be a ""here's 20 squillion powerups bouncing around the screen, only grab the red ones"" sort of thing, or it might pit you against Definitely Not Hibachi, who throws bullet patterns at you to dodge, getting more and more intense as time goes on, your only goal here being to survive; naturally, you cant kill a foe such as that.   Or the game might try to hit you with buildings.   You're even going to get to do some recycling, as you battle your hated arch-nemesis, Physics!   No, seriously, that seems to always be the one at the end....

There are no game-overs here; you move onto the next challenge when the current one is cleared (if it's a type that CAN be cleared) or when you get hit, or in a couple of specific cases, when you screw something up (like the one with the rocket).  At the end of the gauntlet of tests, you're given what is essentially a scorecard, and it calculates a ""gamer age"" for you; your overall goal is to have this number be as low as possible.   You also have a traditional score though, so dont worry, that's still there.

For the most part, the various minigames are well done.  Unexpectedly well, in some cases.  For example, my favorite is this one that tells you to ""DODGE!"" and then drops you in this horrible hellhole filled with giant red spheres.  Shooting doesnt help, here... it's all about dodging the spheres as the camera/playfield spins and zooms all over the place, but you cant just memorize THIS challenge, no sir.  You never know what the thing is going to do next in this mode.  It'll abruptly change the direction that everything is shifting in, and change the speed, and keep spinning, and it can do this pretty freaking fast.... and then come to a near halt, slowly spinning like 5 giant orbs around you, making you wait for what you know is probably coming, that moment when it just abruptly lurches off in some random direction.... overall, that challenge is not about MEMORIZING, it's about REACTING.  It's hard to explain, but it seems to react to you, too... if you were to play it enough, you'd probably see what I mean.  There's definitely some sort of AI in place there acting alongside the RNG.    The interesting thing is?  No matter how many times I try that minigame, it *never* does anything unfair despite the randomness and all the wild movments and spinning.  I have yet to have a ""what the hell was I supposed to do about that?"" moment.  Or any moments that feel like they're completely about luck.   And that kinda amazes me, considering how this specific minigame/mode works.

And honestly, the whole game is like that.  It just WORKS, and that includes all of the many bits that have RNG in them.  When there is RNG, it's all in the right places, and more importantly, not in the WRONG places, AKA, places where it can kill you regardless of skill.  And for the non-RNG challenges, they're equally well made; none of the patterns that Definitely Not Hibachi fires at you are at all cheap or broken or anything like that, for instance, though you might get a TAD irritated at the one where the bullets blink on and off yet dont actually stop existing during the ""off"" state... you'll see what I mean when you get there.  But even that is never unfair, never cheap.

And overall, the actual scoring system... I dont mean the age thing... seems well done too.  Each minigame is weighted properly, in terms of how much overall score potential it has for you.  Getting a truly high score in the main mode really will involve mastering ALL aspects of this.... which is pretty much the entire purpose of the whole idea.   So that's well done.

As a rule, the different minigames are all pretty fun, and definitely quirky.  The only ones I kinda dont like much are the ones called the ""shooting tests"".  The idea is to last as long as you can, and stop things from reaching the bottom of the screen by shooting them.  .....without rapid-fire.  Things will take more and more hits to destroy as time goes on.  That's right... this is a test of just how rapidly you can hit the damn fire button.  And you have to go really... freaking.... fast.... to master it.  I hit level 99 (the game measures current difficulty in ""levels"" that keep slowly going up over the course of each minigame) during the main game challenge the first time the ""shoot the boards"" one came up, and by the end of it, I'd stopped holding the controller normally, and was instead slashing my entire hand across the facebuttons, back and forth, REALLY fast, in order to keep up the utterly absurd fire rate needed to keep going.  My entire arm and shoulder still hurt after having done that.   The nasty part, there's an achievement for hitting level 99 in that.... but you have to do it in the challenge mode, not the main mode.  I'll have to do that AGAIN later... ugh.   BUt yeah, I'm not too fond of the fire-rate test thing.   But I can understand why it's there, even if it is a very outdated concept (it's mostly very old shmups that had fire-rate as an important thing; nearly all modern ones use auto-fire, so that your arm doesnt fall off).  


Overall though, I think the entire thing works well.  Most importantly, I just find it really FUN.  And that's the key to everything, eh?  And I think that's what's special about THIS one.... shmups can be fun but are often also frustrating; there's always that one boss you cant quite manage, or that one enemy formation that will impede your progress, or just that one THING that happens every freaking time, and you get irritated.  I know I do.  But in this game... I dunno, it never gave me that feeling.  When I'd screw up, I kept thinking ""I can make up for that mistake in the next couple of challenges"".  Or something like that.

Functionally, everything is good, by the way.  Controls are perfect, no issues there, there's leaderboards, and a replay-save system that works in all modes.

Overall, this is a pretty strange game, but it's one of those ones that I can recommend to any shmup fan... particularly if you like Triangle Service.

My skills when it comes to this genre are just as sharp as they ever were, maybe even sharper... right?

Enter [i]Shmups Skill Test[/i]. In as little as 10-12 minutes, gamers across the globe can get a scientifically* accurate assessment. They can also challenge friends and strangers alike in the online leaderboards. Over the course of a session, players will attempt four minigames, each having two (or three) variations, while engaging in a handful of interspersed microgames.  Each minigame focuses on specific skills, such as dodging, shooting, and showing good judgment. Upon completion of a session, the player's ""gamer age"" is determined, and their score is uploaded.

Now, onto the minigames.

[h1]8-bit! Tank A! Tank B![/h1]
These three minigames test the player's overall ability. If I'm playing [i]Shmups Skill Test[/i] for score, I go with 8-bit. This minigame sends wave after wave of flying ships at the player. It's very reminiscent of the old-school games where a line of enemies would attack at once. This minigame is my pick for scoring because it's the easiest to clear. Even though minigames are picked randomly, the session always starts with either of these three, so restarting is painless. 

Tank A is a relentless tank assault. In just a short amount of time, players will face a barrage of tanks, and their cannon-fire continually increases in speed. This is an exciting mode due to its raw intensity. It's worth pointing out that players will experience every kind of dodge. These can include (but are not limited to) the ""I expected that."", the ""That was close!"", and the always classic ""Wow. How did I even avoid that?"". After awhile the bullets move at obscene speeds. Surviving beyond this point requires pure grit. 

Tank B is less intense, but there are multiple tank-types, all with their own attacks. This minigame requires a good sense of judgment, since you have to focus on the most dangerous enemies, while also paying attention to what the nearby forces are doing. Unlike a number of shooters, enemies can fire bullets from off-screen. Overall I think this variation is the most complex and interesting of the three.

[h1]Dodge the Bullets![/h1]

The purpose of this minigame is to test dodging. You're put up against an invincible boss that fires off several bullet-patterns. Admittedly, this minigame prey on my weaknesses. The bullet-patterns aren't particularly complicated, but they are pretty fast. Sometimes, the best approach is not to rely on reflexes, and to instead use short focused maneuvers. I can reach level 50 (out of 99) in these minigames pretty consistently. However, once the speed doubles, I start panicking (and losing).

[h1]Dodge the buildings or the balls![/h1]

Yep, more dodging. The basis of any 2D shooter is in the dodging, so I can't say that I'm surprised. There is some randomness to this minigame, but there's also a sense of control to them. It's almost as if you can influence the general direction the screen shifts, by how you move your ship. It's hard to explain, but when playing this minigame, I try to move as often as possible. The objects are static, but the screen can sometimes shift in a way that sends the player into an instant collision with them. Overall, I'd say that this minigame is equal parts intriguing and frustrating. 

[h1]Button pressing![/h1]
The final minigame tests the player's ability to mash the fire buttons. This is the second to last minigame of the session and for good reason: It's positively exhausting. Both variations require that the player shoot exceptionally durable objects, before they pass the bottom of the screen. Since auto-fire is turned off, you have to press buttons as quickly as possible, in order to survive. 

While it would be all too easy to get a controller with turbo functionality, I prefer my Hori EX-SE arcade stick. In order to clear these minigames, I attempted various techniques. One method involved pressing buttons in a sequence, as if I'm drumming on a desk out of boredom. 

However...
In order to get the firepower necessary to destroy giant asteroids, I have to brush my hands across all of the fire buttons at once. It's sort of like dusting off an old book, except at a forearm-destroying rate. By the way, it's a bad idea to allow the finger-tips to do most of the work. In just a couple minutes, I got a blister. It's rather ironic that in my 33 years of gaming, this is the first time that I've ever gotten a blister. These are the things that happen I suppose.

[h1]Odds & Ends![/h1]

Before the session ends, the player enters the ""cooldown"" phase. The player shoots cans so that they fall into a floating garbage-can. This is an oddly well-developed minigame. The cans have physics, and will react accordingly when they are shot or make contact with other cans. This is also a nice way to score some extra bonus points, but I can't say that I'm a fan. The microgames are neat, though their quality can vary wildly, depending on the skills of the player. While I like finding the right moment to use a bomb, or shooting through a huge wave of tanks, I always fail within two seconds of the ""dodge everything!"" microgame. 

[h1]The Results![/h1]

After a few hours of practice, I've been able to consistently hit a gamer age of 20. It's been a very rewarding endeavor, although I could have done without the blister. [i]Shmups Skill Test[/i] works not just because of its variety of minigames, but that it also respects the foundation of the genre. The controls are perfectly suitable, the mechanics are rock-solid, and the visuals are clear and concise. 

It's also very nice that the sessions are short and to the point. This makes them good for practice, before players take on a more involved 2D shootemup. The minigames succeed on their own merits as well. It's very likely that I'll return to Tank! minigames over and over again. This is because despite their simplicity, they're consistently challenging and entertaining. Overall, this is a collection well worth looking into.

*I'm certain that if there was an accredited shmup scientist, they would recommend this game.

The Shump's skill test is a odd little duck of a game, essentially a mix between the Brain Training series for the DS and more classic arcade japanese shooters, this game pits you up against a variety of different challenges, testing aim, speed, dodging ability and several other factors to generate a final score and 'Shooting Age', the lower ages you geat meaning the better you have done.

Style-wise it is a little basic at times, this isnt a bad thing as it means that you can focus on what is going on easier but the lack of flair does hurt a little. Another complaint is the scoring mechanic, for those who want to focus on leaderboard chasing, the game is a little too random with some games giving out much more point-wise than others meaning you could be playing for quite a bit before you reach the ideal run.

These complains though are quite minor in the long run as the controls work brilliantly, setting up controllers is easy thanks to clear instructions on setting up buttons and the whole game runs smoothly at all times, optimized well for even the more lower end of computers. In addition to the normal test mode, you can also try out most of the different games in a variety of score-rush modes, as well as having a go at them with 2-4 players side by side.

Starting with test mode, you go through an array of mini-challenges each covering a specific/common shump theme such as dodging, bomb launching, enemy counts, etc all reminiscent of past shmups. Once you pass/fail a challenge, you're thrown straight into the next one with only quick instructions. At the end of the ""test"" you're giving a grade and ""gamer age"" to rank and compare to the communities average. You unlock the challenges you encounter for free play and I was happy to find in subsequent playthroughs more and more variety of challenges to be tested on.

I really enjoyed freeplay mode, only trying one challenge at a time, to compete for highscores on the leaderboard. You can even watch replays of the other players listed on the leaderboards to see how they achieved their high score.

I know this is a game my household will be competing for highscores on for a long time.

As ""William Shakesman"" mentioned, Shmups Skills Test is essentially a Brain Age Shmup.  

There are a collection of minigames that you can unlock that test a few core areas that are required for competitive Bullet Hell Shmup games.  The list of skills tested are as follows:

[list]
    [*]Bullet Dodging
    [*]Obstacle Dodging
    [*]Accuracy
    [*]Progression of Enemies
[/list]

They also have a few more areas, like *coolness* or *judging ability* but these can be distilled down to luck or endurance respectively.  You might have also seen the Trash Can with Cans screenshot above.  When I first saw that screenshot it reminded me of the 90's with those 100CD packs of games they use to sell at Electronics Boutique.  Kind of like ""My First Shmup"" kind of thing.

Let me tell you, that Trash Can/Soda Can level is legit.  It perfectly encapsulates precision and mindfulness of your shots, while having a degree of physics built into the level.  To the point if you just shoot like a madman, you'll make the level harder to dodge as well as scoring less altogether because you aren't putting the cans in the trash. 

It looks really damn bad in a screenshot, but it's quite effective.

Now for the only thing that is actually bad about the game.  The music.  

Dear lord.

The music.  It's so bad.

One track is a simple arcade techno beat mixed with the opera.  I.E. Bass Loop + Fat Lady Singing.

Another track sounds like an 8-bit synthesized whoopee cushion. 

There is *one* good track and that is when they are copying the Space Invaders music.

Anyway, the game seems to employ a direct translation, so be prepared to fail initially as the small amount of info they give you during a new mission that is sprung upon you, doesn't really instruct you with anything meaningful.

Ultimately, I think Shmups Skills Test succeeds at it's goal of testing individual areas that are required from a range of Shmups.",1465567638,1465567638,True,5,3,0.418495357036590576,1,False,True,False,False,,,

If you like zany action, fun Engrish, and shmup parody, this is the game for you.  There is plenty here for shmup veterans to enjoy, as new stages or even music tracks can contain references to timeless classics.  Plus, you get to feel good about keeping the earth clean by throwing empty cans in the trash.

As for the actual gameplay, the controls could not be any simpler.  I used a 360 arcade stick, and it was recognized flawlessly, and all gameplay that I have been seen can be done with just the directional input and only one button.  Some challenges have auto-fire implemented, but others require you to button mash and seem to be a test of how quickly you can do so.  In addition to shooting challenges, there are also various dodging challenges, bombing challenges, and power-up and medal collecting challenges.  Failure is often more hilarious than success.

Clearly this game will provide nostalgia for shmup veterans, especially since some bosses, challenges, etc, will remind them of specific other games.  But I also think this game is great for a shmup newbie who just wants to test their skills, or anyone who likes to try to decrease their age as much as possible, like in Brain Age.
