Zamarian is a shoot 'em up styled after a few retro arcade games. It has a semi-unique perspective in that you shoot forward rather than up. Unfortunately, this creates awkward depth perception issues. The game becomes challenging due to the visuals rather than the game itself being hard. This perspective could have been pulled off a lot better and made the game more enjoyable, but in its current state, it is more tedious than fun. The shooting mechanics also leave a lot to be desired. They are bland and uninteresting, combined with a confusing upgrade system that seems to reset the weapon you buy somewhat randomly. Maybe I missed the part of the UI where ammo is displayed, but to me it seemed like I would lose it regardless of how much I shot. Overall, a mediocre game made worse by its perspective.

Zamarian is a neat little tube shooter. It will probably remind older gamers of arcade classics like Tempest. In keeping with the theme, graphics are suitable for the genre, sitting neatly somewhere between a modern isometric style and indie pixel art.

When it comes to gameplay, it could be a little more fleshed out. The basic controls are simple enough. Players can move the mouse side-to-side to roll around the screen, and forward and back to move the ship up and down the ship's flight path.

Minor problems with gameplay only start popping up when trying to get any idea of what the strange buttons on the side of the screen are. To figure that out, you will have to start a new game and pay close attention to the pop-ups. After that initial introduction though, there seem to be any further explanation of the capabilities of the weapons or even the differences between the ships. Of course, you can figure out what they do by purchasing them. I'm still not sure what the non-cosmetic differences are between the ships. Likewise, I also couldn't figure out what the EMP does.

Opening up one of the menus to upgrade your ship will just slow the game down, not pause it. A separate pause button will do as advertised, and will provide you with options to turn both music and sound off or back on.
 
The enemies are easy enough at first, but quickly ramp up the challenge. There is a good variation of them, and more and more enemy types will be added as levels are progressed through. Bosses are intimidating and challenging, but not impossible to take down.

There is also an online leaderboard and a multiplayer component. Though I didn't get to check the latter out, it seems to allow up to 4 players to join either a random or private match. That's pretty cool, in my opinion.

For just over $5, Zamarian provides some solid arcade action. But community and openess is increasingly important in the gaming industry these days. Zamarian's devs are no exception when it comes to engaging with their community. It's difficult to see anything but a good future for a game whose developers are willing to listen to their players with a critical ear.",1454285380,1454712609,True,5,0,0.464371442794799805,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game is played with the mouse only, you control the ship in a kinda of circular movement, so it's perfect if you don't want something really complicated or complex.

Pros:
-It has sweet graphics that resembles 32 bits era, but in a good way, they look nice.
-The music is awesome, which is always welcome.
-Cool boss batles.
-Addictive.

Cons:
-The hud seems odd, since the game is played only with the mouse, you have to click on the buttons of the hud to activate somethings (new ships, change guns).",1453810190,1453810190,True,3,0,0.527559041976928711,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I like the aspect of using the mouse to control the spaceship in this game. I enjoy the single player mode for its replayability and superb enemy and boss design. It also reminds me of the 80s arcade shooters Gyruss, Tempest, and Sinistar. The multiplayer aspect is extremely fun as well. I had hours of fun playing this game along with friends and family. 
       
       Also, there is really cool guy on youtube named Saiga GeneCast who did a Let's Play of this game. You should check him out because he describes in detail how to play this game. Type in Zamarian Saiga GeneCast and you should find his video.
