A good example is boss fights - every boss fight takes place in a castle map. The first few times you do them, you'll probably go at them like I did room by room and get spanked. Then you start to figure out how to set up good team reaction cover so when you open the door, your team will get some shots off. Then you will figure out how to open up walls with explosives, jumps, or throws. And how to set up a fire trap. Finally towards the end you will simply ambush enemies from the outside by blowing open walls and blasting them with an entire round of salvos all while the ceiling comes raining down on their heads before they even get a turn.

Feels great.

Let's start with the gameplay click a character, move a character rinse and repeat until you fight an enemy clearing Enemies in areas is a really good way to play the game and probably the only way to play the game but that doesn't matter since you can leave anytime assuming that you don't have any enemies following you

The four biomes:
The four biomes in this game, go as follows the plains, the swamps, the desert, and savanna. The plains is a good starter biome to play on, the swamps... Ehhh not bad but the ghosts are a little annoying, the desert pretty dangerous especailly in late game, savanna: fuck that place, the explosteves do quite alot of damage the cannon guys do too much, there is so much going on in that Biome is too much... atleast the boss there is easy.

Weapons:
Weapons are good, the early and late game as far as weapons go is very balanced and you can have lazer weapons if you get far enough, that is all i have to say...

Problems with the game:
This isn't a review without some criticism, the first problem i see is the savanna the place has too many powerful enemies and they can potentally oneshot you especally if you get unlucky enough for the map to make you fight the boss second in the rotation but if you are prepared for it, you might be fine, but reaction is required for that place too. The graphics look fine i guess, but i play alot of minecraft so i am not going to base it off of that but everything looks... gloomy, the savanna looks happy enough but i have a burning hatred for that biome so it doesn't matter too much, but the game is overall good if you ignore the graphics

This game is really good, and is not just a underapreciated gem, its unapreciated sword created by a hero binded by the greatest gem of all time... that is quite an exaggeration I know but the game is amazing, i hope a sequel comes out soon, and maybe this game would get the recognition it deserves.",1602301654,1602301654,True,5,1,0.600654304027557373,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[*]It also suffers from major mounting lag when lots of particles are ""on-screen"" (even if you can't actually see them) through no action of your own (enemies knocking down trees and causing fires, etc.).

[*]I got really far but the panic mode completely messed up my team and got them all killed.

Other optimal strategy is [i]always[/i] exploring at a crawl (literally moving a few tiles at a time and then ending your turn with massive overwatch time left over), because enemies can fatally surprise you at any moment out of nowhere through the fog of war, such as throwing a Molotov cocktail your way when you had zero preparation from not being able to see them in the first place.[/list]
There is a cool ""overwatch""-like system but it's confusing as to how much time is actually remaining if you cut a little bit into the remaining time.

I love this game, I haven't really played any other turned-based games so I have nothing to compare it to.

Enemy is a rogue-like(ish) RPG game that just combines a bunch of different kinds of fiction together to make this weird but fun mutant thing of a fantasy world. This entire game is trial and error if you don't look at guides like I did, which I don't mind because every failure made me think about new ways to approach enemies and dungeons.

One of the things that makes this game a lot of fun is how much building destruction there is, it's very fun to use the environment to your advantage, ie: blowing a hole in the roof of a dungeon and pouring bullets and grenades down onto my foes. 

I believe they have made the game a bit easier since its release, one of the most useful features is hotels/inns. Whenever you reach a town, there is a hotel which you can spend your gold on to get a checkpoint. Back around this game's release, hotels would only provide you a one time use checkpoint, now you can return to the hotel after an infinite amount of deaths.

Another thing is, whenever a character dies, they are dead for forever unless you saved them at a checkpoint. The first time I finished the game, I probably lost over 20 different characters with somehow keeping the starter character. 

I never felt like the gameplay was mindless, every decision felt strategic. Figuring out how to wisely place and use my characters based off their health, mind, weapons, and skills was a lot of fun. Gold management is also another big thing, whenever you reach a town in this game, you need to choose what would be the best way to spend your gold, ""do I get a better weapon? medkits? hotel checkpoint? gun for hire?"".

Because everything is based off of chance in this game, there is always a balance between choosing cover or damage, do you want move in for damage? or do you want to stay behind and avoid enemy fire? 

I guess I could go on about this game, but I can't structure reviews very well and I'm pretty stupid.  Either way, if you like RPGs, physics, and strategy, buy this game.",1566167993,1621911424,True,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False,False,,,

O resultado podia ser babaca, mas não é. É bem divertido dar uma metralhadora para um anjinho e mandar ele atirar em um zumbi. 

Duas das coisas mais interessantes resultam do cenário: a habilidade 'throw', que permite arrancar pedaços do cenário para atirar nos inimigos, e um pulo do Mario que todos os personagens têm, que permite que personagens de longo alcance consigam se posicionar muito bem em cima de árvores, casas e... cogumelos. A única coisa que não casa com o cenário é a 'estabilidade mental' que também é importada dos XCom antigos; já imaginou você ter que parar de jogar Contra porque o seu carinha entrou em pânico depois de testemunhar os horrores da guerra? Além disso, é estranho quando você tem personagens que são guerreiros lendários e androides futuristas e acabam entrando em pânico porque um manezinho do outro lado do nível tá atirando uma pistolinha mais ou menos no mesmo CEP que eles. Não chega a destruir o jogo, mas é um elemento que deixa bem chato.

Outra coisa bem interessante são os cenários destrutíveis. Mas destrutíveis mesmo! Qualquer coisa é feita de blocos e pode ser destruída com ataques. Isso significa que todas as linhas de fogo são reais. Se você atira em um carinha atrás de cobertura, você não ganha -35% na sua rolagem de precisão, você atira mais ou menos na direção dele e pode ser que a bala acerte a cobertura ao invés dele. Você pode destruir telhados e estruturas e derrubar o inimigo de cima delas, ou derrubá-las em cima do inimigo. E com a habilidade 'throw' você pode jogar pedaços do mundo nos inimigos, e dependendo do que você acerta arrancar outros pedaços. É bastante divertido. O único problema é que essa destruição acontece em tempo real, apesar do jogo ser por turnos... às vezes, é possível mover um personagem para fora do caminho de um bólido cadente se for o turno dele. Mas vale a pena pelo que consegue.

O maior problema é que o jogo tem alguns bugs. Já tive um que travou um save - o criador do jogo gentilmente entrou em contato comigo e consertou para mim. Também há alguns menores, como personagens nem sempre conseguindo negociar caminhos que estejam com destroços e a contagem de unidades de tempo ficando completamente louca para personagems que estejam carregando um pedaço do mundo. Geralmente não incomoda, mas como o jogo é um roguelike (bom, tanto quanto XCom eram roguelikes) e também é bastante difícil, há sempre a chance de que uma partida muito boa acabe por causa de um peido digital. A IA também é bem ruizinha; existem ataques 'mágicos' que têm um custo de estabilidade mental, e inimigos vão alegremente usá-los sem parar e entrarem em pânico sozinhos. 

Mas esses são problemas menores para um jogo muito divertido, interessante e diferentão. Altamente recomendo, super divertido, especialmente se você curte os XCom antigos e fica de cara feia com os modernos.",1514741025,1514741025,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The only thing that stood out at the time was it was ""Xcom like"". So I went to hit next and saw something in the about ""Realistic physics simulation""...that peaked my interests. I would like to also point out, if this game did not have a demo I would have never purchased this game, leaving an empty hole in my life forever. Enemy has to be one of my all time indie favs and im still under 10hrs of gameplay. 

Speaking of gameplay, its fucking brutal at times and thats a good thing. A good example, I managed to get two of my boys killed after we already wiped the level. The both of them were standing next to the house one minute and the next... the house was a heap of burning wood and rubble and one boy was under it all while another was almost thrown out of the map. What happened was I had lit the house on fire in a previous fight and some kind of explosive was inside without my knowledge. Basically what im saying, never expect to survive even if its not a high end level.

With all of that said I do think the game should get some more love. Although I enjoy the random generation, the game could also use some more flavor for the price point like a few new biomes/mini bosses/enemies. Something like caves or dungeons along side of the castles would be great. Wishing it went under a more ""early access"" approach. 

Tl;dr Enemy is as brutal as it is mesmerizing and I highly recommend it. Coming from a guy who isnt a fan of turn-based combat. Enemy will without a doubt go down in my top games of all time.

I find them to be too rigid, too restrictive, and too... strategic? which is a weird criticism to give to a strategy game, I know, and Enemy definitely rewards careful strategy, but my problem with other strategy games is it feels like that's ALL it rewards. In Enemy, you can come up with some stupid, off the wall, hair brained strategies that shouldn't work at all, and it CAN work, and even if it doesn't, you'll have fun with it.

The key aspects to this, I think, are the physics-based environment which collapses into chunks when it takes damage, and the chaotic nature of it being randomly generated. I don't play this game well at all. I start off on the platformer world with stats put into throwing and endurance, every single time. I tend to lose really early on in the game, but I'm having fun the whole damn time.

One of my recent favorite moments in this game was when I was being attacked by anonymous gunmen who were setting the ground on fire around me. They set one of my party members, the princess, on fire. The princess specializes in throwing, so I ran over to the nearest enemy, picked them up, then ran back into the fire so he would die with me. The sacrifice wasn't worth it, as my last party member died shortly after. But the fact is that I had more fun with those few moments before losing than I ever have with any other strategy game. I want to see more strategy games that give you this much freedom to make bad decisions and have fun doing it.

Just be aware, however, that this game isn't free from bugs, but from my little experience so far, the developer is very open and receptive and is still working on polishing the game.

Default difficulty (which allows achievements) comes with ironman (lack of) saves, so beware!

The plot is short and to the point: the world has been taken over by four boss characters. It’s up to you to stop them.

You start with three characters: two random allies and you, a character who, aside from determining your starting world, and having a blank slate as far as skill points (you have 5 points to assign as you choose), is totally expendable – it’s entirely possible that by the time you get to the second (or even first!) boss that your party will not include any of the original three members.

You’re thrown into combat as soon as you leave your house, and depending on which world you started on (‘platformer’ world - which has giant mushrooms, green pipes, floating treasure boxes, and red brick walls - tends to be the hardest start, with the possibility of spawning living bombs who throw themselves at you, blowing huge chunks out of the area and killing pretty much anything unfortunate enough to be in the blast radius) you may well start losing characters just about immediately.

There are a number of different weapon classes which you can use: various melee weapons, pistols, rifles, bows, crossbows, spells and staffs (which throw out small bomb-like or inferno projectiles), and perhaps my favorite: brute strength, which allows you to rip out chunks of the game world and throw them at your enemies.

And here we come to one of the more fun aspects of ENEMY – the entire world is made up of little cubes, which can (and will) be destroyed in the course of your fighting. Walls will get holes in them, and will eventually buckle; trees will fall down in an explosion of leaf blocks. Trying to get into the boss castle, but the corridor outside the throne room is a deathtrap? Blow a hole in a back wall and go through that way, or if you can make your way up to the roof, toss a bomb and crush everything in a rain of bricks!

Both sounds and music are basic, but serve well enough.

Only two things come to mind as complaints: first that the interface doesn’t seem to have any way to automatically make sure that you hold enough APs in reserve to fire a shot during your interrupt; second is that the game can start to struggle if there are large amounts of bricks falling all at once, as can very well happen in town battles if you (and/or the enemy) use lots of bombs, fire, or staff weapons.

It has its initial premise of course, but it does really well to incorporate the many different weapon types across medieval, modern, and futuristic lines. It also does well to allow the player to employ different strategies to get the job done.

Something I like a lot as well is that you can interact with the terrain or jump on enemies to damage them. Get someone with the Throwing skill to pick up a rock, a metal door, or chunk of wall and just throw it at the enemy. Additionally when you fire off a ranged weapon, watch as you cause pieces of the floor and wall to break off and fall away.

About the only thing I sort of dislike is some of the game's balancing. Lower Level characters seem to be extremely weak compared to Higher Level ones - which is to be expected, but it makes leveling a little too important and that leads to having to farm your character levels. Some enemies also seem to be outright more dangerous then others - going into the Plains for example you can expect to receive a lot of damage.

Part X-Com, Part Rogue-like, and in a world that is fully destructible, Enemy is a fairly unique game all things considered. Perhaps it may inspire other developers to incorporate some of its features. I fully recommend this game.

Only thing I should note is the price of the game - you might want to wait for it to come on sale first before buying it.",1483451698,1486947811,True,6,0,0.512048482894897461,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game saves automatically and you can only save in an inn, but you first need to find the city and get enough money to heal and save.

Now on the secret sauce - destructible environment. It's not as satisfying as it was done in Silent Storm, but still refreshing. You can shoot through walls, sometimes you miss, but the block goes off and wounds the enemy. And there's a trait which let's you (or enemy) take a block or some bigger elements and through it for damage, which is useful as you won't have too many grenades along the way.

It's kind of like Jagged Alliance (Or Old School X-com if it were an adventure instead of full-on strategy), only with a copyright friendly 80's gaming theme running about it.

[b]Upsides[/b]

+[u]Combat System[/u]: It's sort of like Old-School X-Com where there's a little randomness given to physical shots  but otherwise they do have an effect on the environment (more on this later). However it is suprisingly easy to grasp and there are multiple viable tactics and means of attack (ranging from melee to environmental, to some simple psychological warfare to name a few) given the streamlined interface. There's also an RPG element, your characters level up and you can dump them into various stats, as well as picking up or looting various items, weapons and Armor.

+[u]Theme[/u]: It's basically a tribute to a bunch of old school 80's games mashed into an RPG-Strategy hybrid AND BOY DOES IT WORK! (And it is really funny to see a rifle pop out of a copyright friendly ""!"" block). Elements from Contra, Mario, Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, Final Fantasy and more are seamlessly integrated in this game and gives it a ton of personality.

+[u]THE PHYSICS ENGINE![/u]: Here's the real star of this game. You see, despite the grid based movement and the number crunching. What really drives everything is an honest to goodness Physics engine, and it makes the game a complete joy to play! I'll list several examples below
[list]
[*] You can pick up and throw LITERALLY ANYTHING and there's even a skill for it! It's actually suprisingly effective, though requires some setup.
[*] Enemies behind a tree? Chop it down by shooting it! In fact the first time I got squadwiped that's what happened! A merc machine gunned a tree down like a bad 80's action movie, killing 2 of my squadmembers (the last one panicked)
[*] Lots of shrubbery in the way of your target? Throw a Molotov or a fire bomb at the shrubs and burn them out! Fire spreads too!
[*]Enemy in a building? blow the wall open next to them with a time bomb or a boulder and cave the roof in on them!
[*] Enemy nearby and you think he's going to wreck your squad? Have a guy with some energy saved up jump on him mario style!
[*] Use Melee attacks to shove enemies into things (or off cliffs, in rivers, ect!)
[/list]
+[u]The Music[/u]: It's not particularly amazing and it's a little sparse but it set the mood of the game. I actually get a slight Mechwarrior 2 vibe from it personally, which in my book is a good thing.

+[u]Tom Johnson[/u]: He made the game by himself (and to my understanding, a very modest kickstarter budget) and is VERY active on his game's fourms. He takes critiscism seriously and seems to be an all around awesome human being.

+[u]Boss Battles[/u]: I thought the slime was going to be a walk in the park, boy was I WRONG! I only won because of the mass throwing caused everyone in the room to panic.

+[u]Ships with an Editor[/u]: Modders eat your heart out! (It is a little buggy however and seems to lack some updates from previous versions, for example Vision is now tied to ""Mind"" instead of being it's own stat)

[b] YMMV [/b]

=[u]Difficulty[/u]: Make no mistake, this is a tough game where a wrong move can squadwipe you, especially early in the game. Personally I think it falls in the ""Tough but fair"" category of games but some may be turned off by this.

=[u]Voxel Art[/u]: Yeah I understand why this is a turn off but personally I give Tom a pass for two reasons here 
[list]
[*] It makes perfect sense in the context of theme and mechanics
[*] IT WAS JUST ONE GUY WORKING ON IT! Speaking as a programmer who has (at absolute best, and it's almost certainly an overestimation) mediocre art skills I get it. Art isn't everyone's strong suit, and 3D modeling anything remotley presentable is HARD and requires as much dedication to be even a halfway decent programmer. That all said I firmly believe Tom did the best he could do with the tools given.
[/list]

=[u]Learing curve[/u]: [strike]Game doesn't explain itself too much at first but poking through the options menu helps (as well as expirimentation) It's not terribly complicated and you'll get a hang on how to play very quickly. Forming strategies will take you a little while longer.[/strike]. 

[b]EDIT: This was a drawback at first because I was a dunderhead and didn't even notice ""Tutorial"" in the main menu :P.  It explains most of the mechanics very well actually! It just blends in with the rest of the menu, kind of in the middle alongside a few other options. Take the time to play it first. That said it is still something to be mindful of because of the game's difficult nature, forming effective strategies will take some time, some may not have the patience for it. [/b] 


[b]Downsides[/b]
-[u]Mouse Scrolling[/u]: Nitpick but Tom, Can ya pleasepleaseplease give me an option to invert the mouse scrollwheel? Seriously why do I have to scroll up to move the cursor down? Nowhere near a dealbreaker just a minor annoyance.

-[u]Level RNG[/u]: Because the game is randomly generated you can die rather fast in a way that feels a little unfair (It's not but there have been instances where I was jumped at the start and got squadwiped), especially at the beginning sectors. Protip, when you enter the area, watch your flanks, especially beware LOS blocking shrubbery!

[b]EDIT: One more bad thing that should be noted, especially if you have a low-end PC [/b]
-[u] Physics Optimization[/u]: I personally didn't run into too many problems here (Unless a LOT of crazy things were happening at once, like a fire burning down a two story building), but the physics engine sometimes does make the normally silky smooth framerate chug. It does correct itself once it's finished but it is something to be mindful of. 

Thankfully tom has a mod that can clear debris with a button press, so if this is a problem poke around on the fourms for it.

I've added some notes (in parentheses) for how my opinions have changed, but I mostly still agree. In fact, the reason I am changing my review is because I WANT more people to play this game. Yes, it is brutal, but it is in a way that is fair that my idiot teenage mind couldn't appreciate. Thanks.

OG Review: If there was an in between option on steam, this would have it. This game is...interesting. Despite what the trailer implies, this is not a fun romp through a sugarcoated wonderland. This game is extremely brutal, and actually VERY dark tone-wise. Unlike XCOM2, there is no overarching grand strategy/research/construction metatgame here. Just a hero you create, two heroes picked from a small pool, and a world that wants you f%cking dead. (The lack of a metagame is a bit of an exaggeration. The metagame is about the brutal scarcity of everything. Shops do not restock, and items and gold in random chests and enemy corpses in the world are rare. This is not to the extent of going to far, though. It's about know what items to use when, and figuring out the best load-outs for your characters from what is available.)

In this game, you kill all the enemies in a region of the map, then move on to the next region, to again, kill everything to advance. Sometimes you will find towns, but everywhere there is a battle to be fought. This may sound repetitive, but isn't. The battlefields are all procedurally generated, and are actually quite well designed at that. (Still agree, even in the same biome the procedural generation is still varied enough to hold my attention after dozens of attempts.)

There is no minimum to how many heros are in your squad. But, every time you go to a new battlefield, it has a random chance of generating a new hero for your squad. The key word, though, is ""new."" (As in, has full health, but is still on level for were you are in the game, having more skill and having better starting weapons.) On one hand, it is nice that the baddies on the squares on the map that you already beat don't re-spawn, but that also means they won't generate new heroes, either. (Oh, boo hoo.) This becomes problematic, since the areas get harder and harder the further you move from you spawn. (To my past self, caution in this game is a virtue. Not to an unfun degree. Your an inserectionary military squad, not a graoup of suicidal maniacs.) You may simply not have enough manpower to continue. This is compounded by how not only is their permadeath, but it is also absolutely compulsory, due to how the save function was built. (Actually, the post-release update added difficulty levels. On ""Normal"", you can sleep in an Inn ONCE and create a point to return to if everyone dies, as well as recover some of the squad's health.) 

You may think to yourself, ""Oh, so this is kind of like FTL?"" No, not really. In FTL, with a bit of luck, you can make it halfway to two/thirds on your first try. But this game is so unforgiving, you will probably die in the first battle if you are not a veteran of tactics games. (Yeah, have experience with the genre will help. However, you will still probably lose in the first or second area. The game is about learning how to get the most out of what you have while learning what tactics are best against each enemies type. Also, you can't play this like XCOM where cover is the end-all be-all, due to the environment being fully destructible and most enemies not using ranged weapons.)

You may think this is a bad game, but is not! It was just made for a very niche audience. If you want a tactics game that takes ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" to the upmost extreme, this is the game for you. Learning the basic mechanics is very quick. If you want to beat this game, however, prepare to spend a lot of time with it. It is made for a crowd who will pour in hundreds of hours to learn and eventually beat the complexities of the game. If you love tactics games (and I mean really, REALLY love tactics games) and want something you 'can sink you teeth into for months or years, I highly recommend it. If you are just a begginer, or more casual, there are probably better way to spend your time and money. (Yeah, I guess I am not the guy who actually wants to put the time in the beat it. Maybe I'll create a guide when I do.)",1458357466,1702749259,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cliché stuff, and there is no problem with that. Let's get onto gameplay the game is a turn based strategy game, I've already mentioned your goal each level, but your overall goal is to kill the 4 main bosses. At the end of each fight you're sent to a map, you can select a square next to the one you're in, another fight will be initiated, you kill some skrubs, grab more loot, repeat. This game isn't very repetetive though, maps are randomly generated, and so are the levels, and to add to that, after making a character, you can select what genre they're in AND what they are within that genre, currently making 8 different paths for your character, why is this important? Depending on what you chose their will HEAVILY depend on what the map is generated to look like, the enemies you fight and the storyline... y'know... roleplay...
One of my favorite things about this game is the world around you, be careful, because the map itself is a weapon, break the stump of a tree? The whole thing is gonna fall and deal damage to anyone in its way!

It's like Jagged Alliance meets Minecraft, with a bunch of old NES references thrown in.  I do have to warn anybody playing the game, that this game is HARD. LOTS of enemies will hurt you and you have very little healing. This forces you to be a lot more tactical than most games, so you can't just rush into the enemy with guns a blazing and hope to live for too long. You must use cunning, strategy, and tactics if you want to have a chance in this game. 

You create one character at the beginning and are joined by 2 seemingly randomized characters. Some characters have guns or arrows, some are melee (having to get in close), some use bombs and explosives, and some attack by picking up things and throwing them. The game seems to favor the ones using guns, as melee characters are hard to get into the attack zone, throwing characters use too much time to find something then pick it up then throw it, and bombs are not plentiful to be very practical. This actually forces one to be a little more strategic than simply aim and fire so I think it works in the game's favor.

One thing the game doesn't mention, is that when you select your character, you can select what his environment and opponents will be (platformer based, horror based, fantasy based, etc). Also, each map is randomized, so you'll never get the same map twice (so you can't memorize maps and layouts).  Also, don't bother picking up items that you won't use, since nobody buys them from you. Though do take your fallen opponent's clothes if you don't like your own.

Despite this game being so difficult, it's still fun to play anyway and keeps me entertained, which is the purpose of a good video game, is it not? If you like challenge and tactical turn based strategy games, then you may want to give it a try.

Reminds me of Jagged Alliance 2 without taking umpteen hours to get anywhere or start doing cool stuff, and without all of the fiddly economic management.

The game gets tense as hell, as the intended play mode is essentially Iron Man mode in a world with dwindling resources. There's an easier mode with saves and less dwindling, but fie on that.

In a lot of ways, it's an ingeniously modernized X-Com 1/2 or JA2, in that it strips out all of the base-building and research and economic worrying, reinvests some of that into character leveling, simplifies the controls to what are actually necessary, adds genuinely destructible terrain and structures with good physics and fire modeling, and makes the time between booting the game for the first time and doing something fun about 2 minutes; and it does all this while still retaining the fundamental complexity of the squad tactics in X-Com/JA2. 

An unkind reviewer would say it's JA2-lite, which is true in a sense, but I don't have a problem with that. I'm not trying to spend 200+ hours fomenting a revolution again; I'm just trying to sledgehammer someone into and through a wall.

Anyone who gave the game a second shot after the introduction of an inn like feature for saving and for healing might be disappointed. I didn't have enough money at any point to use it.

Mobs are fairly unbalanced, and if you make the mistake of playing in the trope with Knights you'll find you have zero ways to take them out before they can kill everyone at early levels.

Furthermore, theres no indication of mob levels apart from a red warning box if the difference is extreme. Up to 5 levels different encountered so far. Having a knight NPC who took ~4-8 points of damage from behind only, took no morale damage from frontal hits, and had 80 health could kill 5 PC's in a turn when berserked (from morale ""damage"")
Grenadier mobs seemed somewhat strong offensively but could at least get shot down, bombed, or bum rushed if you're careful. The knight was hitting for 60ish points of damage on my level 3's on my second mission. Also this was on the easiest difficulty, which increases your medical drops.

The claim to ""roguelike"" only comes from a lack of saving apart from lower difficulty settings using the inn. The only way to save is to quit the game to continue later.

First of all, you create your own character, then gather additional party members as you play, until you reach the maximum party size of 6. The characters are all based on common gaming characters - the action hero (good with guns) the wizard (focuses on staff weapons) and so on.

You move your characters, then the computer moves theirs. The goal is to kill all the enemies in the area, then move on. There are zone bosses to kill, and once you have defeated them all (there are currently 4) you win.

There are elements of roguelikes here too - permadeath for characters, and while the game autosaves fairly often, you can't save-scum and reload. Decisions are final.

What makes this special, for me, is the physics. Everything is destructable, and it is endlessly entertaining watching a stray shot bring down a tree that flattens an enemy, or making a tactful decision to blow up a buildings weak points in order to make it collapse in on the occupants. Fire spreads and degrades the materials it touches, and weakens them.

The AI is fairly basic, the challenge lies in being prepared for surprise attacks and not letting yourself be pinned into a situation you can't get out of. The game is pretty hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, and gather some extra party members, it gets easier... until you find yourself trying to kill an undead vampire lord with 6 allies of his own in a close-quarters battle-royale in a crumbling and fragile stone castle ...... and you've only got an explosive throwing lunatic as your available character.

It has alot of things going for it.  It's a tactical squad strategy game, which reminds me alot of Silent Storm, actually.  And clearly takes some inspiration from the old Xcom games.

There's alot going on here; you've got randomly generated maps, a big worldmap to explore, towns to go to and buy stuff in, characters to recruit, and a wonderful destructible landscape.  It's very satisfying to watch things shatter when they are hit, and every individual brick or block or whatever is a seperate entity, and can collide with and injure characters.   There's tons of different weapons and items, an easy to use level-up-your-skills sort of thing, and of course permadeath.

But, there's one thing that, for me, absolutely grinds this all to a halt and keeps it from meeting, or even getting close, to it's potential, and that's the morale system, if that's the correct word.

Every character, friend or foe, has a stat representing their mind/morale/courage.  When enemy attacks are fired at your characters, they'll take a hit to this number... no matter if the attack misses or hits them.  When this drops to zero, they will flip the hell out, and either run around like utter morons (problem number 1) or go berserk.  The running around bit is a problem because it DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.  I understand the idea of representing a ""fight or flight"" response, and the urge to get the hell out of there to save yourself.   Too bad it's so poorly implemented though. Your characters wont run AWAY from the enemy; they'll simply run in totally random directions for awhile.  And I mean TOTALLY random.  They absolutely will end up standing 5 blocks away from 2 guys with shotguns and a ninja, or just stand in an open field with snipers everywhere, or.... you get the idea.  This makes no sense at all.  These guys, if they're going to panic, should run AWAY from the enemy.  You know, like people would actually do.  You run AWAY from the threat.  Not just zoom around in different directions followed by shoving your nose up the barrel of some guy's gun.  They can also go berserk instead, at which point they'll try a desperate attack against an enemy, and this one DOES actually work like it sounds, and so isnt much of a problem.

But then there's the way the whole thing is activated.  As I said, when attacked, your guys will get more and more scared.  But here's the thing:  they'll get freaked out EVEN IF IT MAKES NO SENSE.  If they're up against some guy who is so fantastically stupid that he's on the other side of the map, fires a gun DIRECTLY at a heavy object that's RIGHT in front of him, and thus hits it, your guys, who again are on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, will stand there and go ""HOLY EXPLODING COWS, BATMAN!!! That one almost hit me square in the forehead!  What a deadly sniper that guy is! I better get away!"".  They will do this every.  Single.  Time.  And believe me, it gets really old, really fast.  You end up having to come up with somewhat odd tactics JUST to deal with something that is basically broken from the start.  Not a good thing, and for me, even though I wasnt exactly dying much, it just got so damn stupid that my interest just shattered.  Even if I won the map, I was like ""That.... that was just so dumb.  I had to change my strategy because the bad guy pretty much shot himself in the foot a mile away, causing my idiot melee guy to run into the open and do a little dance for no reason!"" and.... yeah.  I was just done at that point.   I love strategy games, normally.  But when they hit a point where logic just goes completely out the window, I just lose interest.

And that's pretty much what happened with this one.   Being totally honest, I dont think that mechanic is even necessary.  Particularly considering the theme behind the game.  Your guy isnt just some random idiot; he's clearly an adventurer, having already been on assorted game-ish quests, like being a horror game protagonist, to hopping over spikes and into pipes like Mario.  The pathetic reactions to.... basically everything.... just dont make sense in this context.   I can understand a mechanic like that being added to up the difficulty.  But there's SO many other ways to add extra challenge without having to resort to something like that, as so very many other games have proven already.  

All in all, it's not a bad game, but just has some glaring flaws (as that's not the only odd issue it has) that for some players might ruin it entirely.  I strongly suggest watching some videos and lets' plays on the game before buying, to get a sense of how it works. 

For now though, I cant entirely recommend it myself.  But your tastes may definitely differ from mine.  Again, it's not bad. But particularly when compared to so many other strategy games out there, it just doesnt quite hit the point where I can genuinely give it a positive score here.

Honestly, I'd rather give it a more neutral score, but Steam's overly simplistic system here doesnt allow me to say ""Well, considering everything, I think this is a 6 out of 10, it's a decent game and you might like it but there's definitely some big issues"". And I do still play it.  But since I cant just outright recommend the game and am suggesting that people watch some of it for awhile before buying, I'm not giving a thumbs up here.",1434792703,1434793583,False,49,10,0.780632615089416504,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[list]
[*] You can pick up civvies and toss them into the water so that they can drown for 5 or something points and the others won't even bat an eyelid. In fact, you can even kill everyone and no one would ever run or put up a fight. Perhaps they think you're just playing with them?
[*] You can dress up as a Princess or use an actual one and take on mobsters, purple masked men, skellies, and more enemies while armed with a Hugh Jazz stone block many times your own weight.
[*] Despite the fact that you can stomp mechants who charge you outrageous prices, you cannot loot their steel chests for their wares. Of course, the huge box [i]can[/i] be used to completely demolish the side of the hotel when that greedy concierge works.
[*] P.R.I.N.C.E.S.S. stands for: ""Person Reprogrammed to Immediately Neutralize Castles by Excessively Slinging Stuff.""
[*] You can jump inside the tall green pipes and end up somewhere else on the map and jump onto the yellow floating boxes, just like in those games about an Italian plumber and that gorilla. Just don't expect to get a mushroom or an all-consuming dino mount for your troubles. 
[*] Is an archer shooting at you from the safe confines of a wooden house? Are you too lazy to break in and deal with him/her? Simply throw a molotov or a fire ball at the door and watch the helpless bastard get barbequed and/or crushed by the collapsing roof after a few turns. Kind of like the movie 'The Wickerman', only that he'll be burning like wicker, man.
[*] Melee fighter + Explod'steve = Dead teammate + stupidity
[*] Despite interrupting an Explod'steve in mid jump with a ranged character, you can still miss even with 60%-70% accuracy, often with humorous/frustrating results. This happened to me twice within the same playthrough. Needlessly to say, I didn't get lucky twice.
[*] You can lose your created character even in your first battle. This is never game-ending though as he/she is 'just another character'.
[*] For a game world where four powerful kings are ravaging the lands and invading towns, there is currently a complete lack of (friendly) soldiers and guards in the field or inside the towns. In fact, there's no government officials or rulers anywhere. Perhaps they all died in a huge combined counterattack on the Four Kings' bases when they first appeared. The only member of nobility in this world is the Princess and she's content with becoming the world's most mobile and dangerous siege engine.
[*] This is a thinking person's game. Doing the classic Zerg Rush will result in you being Zerg dead and it'll be Game Over for you, Zerg. Plan your moves carefully and you may even win the battle without losing anyone.
[*] This is like 'Long Live The Queen', except that your princess is a badass and it'll be her enemies who won't get to live long.
[*] Cranky Kong would've loved this game if it didn't have so much physics.
[*] The Princess could actually be Chuck Norris dressed in drag but if that was true, then the game would've already been completed in like a second. When the player looks at the places he'd travelled through afterwards, they would see that there is nothing left...
[*] There's a dinosaur man in this game who could very well become the Princess' apprentice.
[*] Due to the nature of combat in this game (stray projectiles, bombs, Explod'steves, falling trees, flying debris, etc.), you'll spend less time causing devastation to the surrounding environment in each battle than you will spend actually winning, even unintentionally. To win a fight without hurting a tile of grass or dislodging a chunk of tree bark is more likely to happen with luck than with strategy.

Merchants don't restock, there aren't that many of them and gold is precious. Since there's no rest-to-heal mechanic, temples or peace-loving hippies about, you have to hold on to those health packs. Occasionally you'll find one on an enemy. I think this is the tightest game for healing I've ever seen. I'm walking around with my team at 60% health because I can only heal one of them and I don't want to waste it. Tense.

I haven't even tried to take on one of the four bosses. I was creeping around the non-boss sectors trying to build up my team, but we got wiped. Noise counts. When you use grenades or shotguns, other enemies start showing up. If they have range weapons you could be in for a world of hurt.

Some great scenes:
Chucking a boulder at a skeleton and having him shatter over ten meters of space.

Guy's sniping at me from a house. Windows are too narrow to retaliate. Throw a grenade onto the roof, roof collapses and kills him.

Mobster in watchtower shooting at us, send my heavy in to take out one of the struts. Damn, it still stands on one strut! Still time to take out second strut. Tower falls over my guy, Buster Keaton style with him luckily standing in a gap. 

Exploring a castle, I finally come to the throne room in the middle. Three guys. My heavy clubs a guy into a stone support beam (this was intentional). Beam shatters, enemy killed instantly. Other two guys throw down their weapons. ""I surrender!""

pros
the game is straight up awesome
deeply satisfying turn-based combat
nice physics
much variety of enemies and environments

variety of enemy levels: sometimes they'll be stronger, sometimes they're much weaker

Pros:
Destructible enviroment
Tons of replayability
Diverse areas with thier own different machanics
Tons of enemy viriaty
4 different character classes that each play very differently
Tons of little references to different games
Unforgiving and difficult (this is a pro and con, depending on you)
""Customizable"" character (have fun with your one ""costomized"" character)
Tons of items and loot


Cons:
Small bugs (not that common).
Customization is so small I had to put "" "" on customistation.
You can only customise ONE of your starting 3 characters.
Your one customized character can die as easy as anyother character (not nessisarly a flaw).
Unforgiving and difficult (this is a pro and con, depending on you)
Random frame drops around boss areas and when you destroy buildings. So in other words the game isn't optimized that well.

Not 'lite' because it is easy or simple, but because it doesn't require as much commitment or long term strategic thinking as XCOM or Jagged Alliance, which I think is a major plus. 

I often find myself wanting to play a squad based tactics game with some form of campaign or persistence, but I don't always have the patience for the in-between battle strategizing or squad management. This game fits that niche perfectly, and while it's rather specific, I feel that if you want a relatively quick tactical experience akin to XCOM or JA, this game is for you. 

Not to mention that I adore the physics based combat. Destructible terrain is always a huge plus for me in any genre, and that's this games main attraction, mechanics-wise. I love the boss fortress levels especially, since you always have the option to collapse the doorways or the roof on your enemies. Most of the time it'll happen anyway, for better or worse.

Finally, the variety of weapons keeps the battles pretty fresh. Mostly it's fun to mess with explosives. I had an awesome, but ultimately game ending plan that began with setting an explosive on what I thought was the wall behind the boss. Turns out, it was the hallway adjacent to the throne room. The hail of plasma bolts that followed my breach sent my team into a panic almost instantly. It was definitely a cool and unique experience, if a bit annoying.  

Oh, that brings up a con. The morale system is a little wonky. I feel like I have to put a bunch of points into the morale stat just to stop my troops from fleeing at the first sign of combat. I understand the purpose of the AOE morale damage, but I much prefer the system from Xenonauts, where the actual impact point of the shots cause an AOE of terror based on the shot damage. In Enemy, it’s more of a beam of terror, where anyone remotely close to the projectile's path loses morale. Though honestly, this is the only significant gripe I have with the game. 

A final note; I love the different classes of troops in the game. There are a bunch of different roles your troops can play, much more than most other games of this sort. This diversity in the actual tactical engagements these roles afford does a lot to mitigate the relatively simple nature of the actual mechanics at play. Also, random tip: never forget about the jump function all troop have, it's extremely useful!

All in all, I love this game. It's mechanically simple, but what mechanical depth there is gives each battle a quirky feel. Fully destructible terrain, and a rogue-like approach to game length (and difficulty) fit this game in scarcely populated niche of the tactics market. 

If you ever had the urge to start a game of XCOM, but lack the patience for all that base building and research nonsense, I fully recommend Enemy.",1427181445,1427181445,True,2,0,0.498659491539001465,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm assuming if you're reading about Enemy you're already familiar with squad based tactics and roguelikes. (If you're not, I'd check out other reviews). The unique aspects of the game include the destructable environment, the 80's video game idiom, a surprisingly easy game to mod in your own content, and a good level of squad customization. And of course, the combining of the squad turn based tactics and elements of the roguelike genre such as permadeath, no ability to reload saves, and procedural generation so that each game is unique. 

The deliciousness of the voxel-based fully destructable world cannot be underestimated. Watching a a walking  bomb blow up a house, grenading a section of the castle ceiling on someone, or debris smack your players around are all deeply satisfying.  The unit customization is fun to mess with, and allows for a good variety of squaddies. You can have troops that react quickly to incoming enemies, ones that can see far and keep calm in difficult situations, ones that can move farther and jump higher when they need to, and ones that just don't die as quickly. 

On the weapons of choice, in addition to ranged and melee you have bombs (throwing grenades for the most part, though you have land mines, tear gas, time bombs and staves) and Throwing. Throwing is a bit of an odd duck in some aspects-it's definitely the skill I'm most likely to injure my squad mates with, but picking up chunks of castle and chucking them provides for deeply satisfying moments. It also requires a bit more set up as you're constantly scavenging for the best things to throw at people and/or relying on other units for damage as much as you can. 

The really neat thing is that, say, unlike X-COM, you have near complete customization when it comes to character growth. While the supporting troops you get are from a set of random archetypes, over time you will be able to mold them into the troops you want. 

In terms of unique game mechanics for squad based tactics, the two major additions are mental damage and reaction fire. Mental damage is taken when your troops are hit or nearly hit, set on fire, or other various phenonama occurs. When it hits zero, your character will either go beserk, attacking the nearest enemy, or panic. I haven't seen this occur much in my own troops (I make the Mind stat a priority) but deliberately initiating it in the enemy is good fun. Firing shots with little to no chance of success becomes a valid tactic, and I've panicked more than one enemy by throwing bridge sections at it. 

A high reaction stat allows you to interrupt movement and actions by enemies. And if you have low reaction they will at times interrupt your actions.  Multiple interrupts a turn can happen, especially if you're moving your chaacters cautiously. Doing so and leaving extra time units with them will add a great deal of longevity to them. It's not just reaction fire too-being able to step a few steps back or forward can be more than enough to turn a sudden enemy into a managable experience. I find it to be a quite enjoyable addition to the genre. 

 The game mechanics are not that readily apparent to the player (though Tom has added in assistance here and there) , especially one unfamiliar with squad based tactics norms, and I think, rightly or wrongly, that the developer is relying on player familiarity with the genre to a certain extent. Given that many people may be drawn to it for the nostalgia factor, I suspect that the relatively unforgiving mechanics are a bit of a rude awakening.  

With that in mind, the game has been quite well supported beyond its release. I originally had three more paragraphs detailing bugs, changes, and additions to the game that I thought would add to its longevity. The Creator is active on these forums and has been diligent in squashing bugs and working to ensure the longevity of the game. My original concerns and suggestions have been more than dealt with, especially with the addition of difficulty modes.

What sounds like a strange mix, amounted to a phantastic end result. While the game is rather challenging (mainly due to the rougelike element in it), it is equally satisfying to beat the enemies with the weapons at your disposal, which also includes the terrain. There are basically four classes of attack: melee, ranged, explosives and ""throwing"" (which refers to throwing any object you can find, which includes parts of walls and the enemies themselves). Additionally, you can jump on enemies to damage them, a throwback to the old Mario-esque plattformers.

Your band of brave men and women are set on a quest to beat the four bosses of the four biomes. While travelling, you can also hire new personnel that you meet in new sectors (up to six people in total), or gear up in villages with the money you have found on your way there. One biome plays different than the other, and mastering one biome does not make you an expert in another one.

The bosses all have unqiue abilities and part of the fun is, to find the best way to beat them (so I won't spoil anything here).

1. Time, everything takes time, each character you get has 75 time per turn (no upgrading your time), there is no problem with that thats how all turn based games work, no the problem comes in where all the enemies feel like they have 150-300 time, when its your turn you can move or shoot, you barely have enough time to do both, maybe move like 2 blocks and shoot once, while the enemies will move half way across the map and shoot at you 4 times. 

2.  Nothing seems to be tipped in your favor, the horror character is my favorite but he starts in the swamp, sure you move slow in the swamp but thats not even what bugs me, my problem is I will walk out of my house and half the time i get one shotted out the door, now there are only 4 characters to choose from so thats like 1/4 of the game that is dead to me

3.  Bugs, I really hope this game gets patched cause it is fun to play, but I have found my characters stuck in one spot where nothing works to get them out (jumping works ~50% of the time),  also I would have the area cleared and one character still wouldnt be able to leave and progress and even restarting the game doesnt let him move on, another few times the enemies have gotten two turns in a row completely skipping my turn, that whole player intercept idea is cool and all but it has messed me up and lost my turns more than enough times to say i like the feature, and when selecting your character use tab because clicking could easily make the wrong character move and mess your strategy up

These are my only real complaints with the game though, everything else about the game is amazing, the detail in structure and the combat is on point, watching the skeletons bones fly everywhere and bandits ragdoll to the ground is so much fun, you can use Pg up and Pg down to change how much structure you can see.

There are more things, that really, really impressed me:

+ The balance is extrodinary. Almost every game has either a tough start (with an easy endgame) or a tough endgame (with easy beginnings). Not Enemy! Enemy is challenging at the start and keeps that level till the very end! Everytime I thought I reached a ""cake run phase"" with a dominant tactic, Enemy threw a new kind of Enemy at me, forcing me to adapt. Digging a hole in the roof of a castle to kill those down below from high position seems like a clever idea... until you encounter a Grenadier, who blasts away the whole ceiling! Priceless!

+ The physics! I never get tired to see the chain reactions, when buildings collapse or trees come down. Other games feel so static, Enemy is pure dynamic.

+ The variety! At first I was very sceptic about the mixture of styles, genres, weapon types. Light sabers and wooden swords? Plasma rifles and Bows? Vampires and Robots? Does that fit together?? Yes, it does! It's funny, it's varied and it's more vivid than a ""Bow +5"" or something.

+ Character developement! There are no useless skills. Every additional point makes you stronger. Every class has its purpose. 

BASELINE:
This game had me hooked like nothing in a long time!

However, if I were asked by someone drawn to this game by the X-COM comparison in the description whether it was a good buy or not, I would tell them to pass. Why? 

Combat in Enemy feels like a conglomoration of stripped down mechanics from XCOM. There is no surpression mechanic, but there is 'Morale'. For some reason important, information such as telling the player exactly what they are improving when they level a character is also absent. For example: A player wants to increase the ranged skill of a character. Telling the player that every point they put into said skill increases their chance to hit by a ""moderate"" amount is totally worthless. What is ""moderate""? 10%? 50%? It's like this for every skill and every weapon. 

It is impossible to telll how skills and weapons synergize with one another and how much damage you're going to be putting out at your level. The same goes for armor. There is an entire shop dedicated to armor and there are is only two types of armor that seems to actually offer protection despite dozens of options to choose from. 

Combat itself is extremely bland. There doesn't seem to be any sort of critical hit chance, nor are there any abilities that are unique to any class or character. The Platformer class plays identically to the Action class if you put points into the correct skill. Not to mention that there really isn't a whole lot to do in combat itself. You either can attack or you move, like checkers. There is no flanking mechanic, no 'real' cover mechanic, no surpression, no interesting abilities that allow you to control enemies, no nothing. 

There is a poorly implemented version of 'overwatch', however it's pretty much worthless.

This is all really dissapointing because at it's core ENEMY has some really cool ideas. It's totally bizzarre to me why the devs didn't design some sort of cover mechanic in a game with voxel based destruction.  It's totally bizzare to me how they have something like fire propagation but don't have something equally cool for the other elements. 

I get that this is sort of supposed to be a Tactical Turn Based Roguelike and it's supposed to be touch. However, Roguelikes are also supposed to offer opportunity, choice and encourage experimentation. There should be at least 3 or 4 ways around every enemy in a roguelike, the cost and avaliability of those choices combined with limited resources make roguelikes fun to play. You may lose horribly, but at least you learned something. 

Not so with Enemy. It all boils down to playing the Line of Sight game from a FPS mentality rather than a TBS one and hoping something doesn't pop out of the fog of war and kill you instantly. 

So to wrap this review up: If playing roguelikes and games with a cut down version of the XCOM's combat than Enemy is sure to meet you about 1/3rd of the way there.",1426711480,1426711480,False,58,5,0.641780257225036621,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is turn based and feels like a weird, but tight mix of old X-Com, Final Fantasy Tactics and a little bit of Jagged Alliance (You hear footsteps to the east, during night ops) and just as unforgiving and deadly as your old x-com or early jagged alliance title. You'll lose squad mates (permadeath) and the surviving members might lose their cool when seeing their buddies stabbed, shot or burned to death, running amok or just panicking and run in circles. AoE weaponry and skills are as deadly and devestating as you know them from the early x-com titles, with incendiary weapons setting whole houses ablaze or collapsing trees in a forrest. 

Characters can level up, if they survive, and you get a set of skills that focus on combat related tasks. Like base-requisits to use certain weapon types, health, mental health or your ability to jump over obstacles (or on roofs if you feel ninja).

If you're into loot collecting, there are tons of houses with chests and of course dead bodies, to replenish ammo, health-packs, bombs, weaponry and armor or just give you some plain cash money

The game can be very punishing and it's certainly not for people who get frustrated when a well placed fire bomb murders half your squad and sends the rest into panic, but for those who love that kind of gameplay it's a must buy.

You'll have to put up with some weird, old-school-like graphics, but I think they fit the setting perfectly.

Pros:
_Very, very good environment: Everything in this game interact with each other in ways that will constantly surprise you. Explosions leaves actual craters on the ground that your characters can take cover in. Trees and foliage can be set on fire that will spread. Damaged houses and building will collapsed upon themselves. You can cut down a tree, and have it fall on a building to break through the wall, which your characters can go through. This game has a truly dynamic environment that some AAA games has trouble figuring out.
_Tight gameplay: Enemy's combat is as dynamic as its environment. Characters has a set amount of action points that they can use to move, attack, look through their inventory and so on. You can accidentally hit your allies if you have them within the line of fire. You can use the environment as cover, or turn it against your foes. Lots of different natural event that can happen with the combat here.
_Highly customizable characters: You get to choose their stats, gears and fighting style. Do you want a fast moving ninja wielding a chainsaw? Or a sneaky sniper with a bow? How about a guy with a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other? You can have all of the above.
_Randomized world: It's different every time!

Cons:
_Graphics can be a bit offputting: Not the most flattering looking game, but that can be overlooked since the gameplay is so deep.
_Bareboned music.
_Uneven sounds: Some sounds are a little too loud while some are barely heard.
_UI can take a minute to get used to: Although minimalistic and concise, you'll have to look around a bit before figuring out what means what.
_Doesn't tell you jack: The game tutorial is non-existent, although the joy of discovery is in full effect here.

I read the description of the game and it sounded like it’d be exactly the sort of game I’d enjoy.

Having played the game I’m pleased to report that it is exactly the sort of game I enjoy!  :)

So far I’ve played a few hours, in that time I’ve got to grips with the various mechanics of the game, had a few characters killed off and managed to defeat the first boss.  I’ll sum my experience up with a few pros and cons below:

Pros
+  The combat is great fun – it does remind me of the old Xcom games and while it can be quite brutal you only ever end up losing a character if you do something silly (running out of energy with your melee character!).  That said occasionally something mental will happen…like missing and knocking a tree on yourself but that’s all part of the fun (not to mention hilarious!).
+  So far there seems to be plenty of weapons and items to use as well as challenging enemies.
+  All of the terrain in destructible and is often usable tactically.  For example know there is an enemy in a building?  Chuck a grenade through the window and collapse it on him!
+  Procedurally generated…a different game each time you play!
+  The difficulty looks to be about right – I’ve not been massively outmatched so far but it’s also not a cake walk (I thought it was going to be when I had five characters but then I managed to get two of them killed!).
+  Game is pretty solid and I’ve only encountered one bug so far.  I’ve flagged it in the forum and within about 15 minutes Tom had responded requesting more info.  I’m impressed with his dedication and desire to make the game the best experience possible for those that have purchased it.

Cons
-  I can’t really think of any but if I had to pick anything I’d say that some of sound and the music can start to grate after a while.  However this is quite a minor grip.

Conclusion:
It’s a great game and fully deserving of the £10.99 price tag.  All the more amazing since it was created by one man!",1426630511,1479934551,True,10,3,0.569405794143676758,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It will freeze at random and freeze my system rendering me completely unable to do anything. Other than the obvious ones, the game is too hard and I keep losing right before I can get anything or level up to fight back. I know this is a game that is meant to be hard like old school games but I keep dying before I can even leave the house, seriously once I died because I accidentally pressed space before I did anything in the house, and my character was immediatly shot and killed. That basically it except for the really bad controlls, whenever I press Q or E it moves my camera to a fixed position so I can hardly see, like I really wish I could just decide where my camera is other than 4 fixed positions.

On top of that, the universe is based off all your favorite retro video game characters. From the Platforming repairman, to the green tunic wearing adventurer.

You move carefully from area to area battling enemies and getting all sorts of random loot. Your goal is to slay the four tyrants ruling the kingdoms. 
With a unique and interactive physics based art style. Enemy has some interesting ideas going for it. 
The game is well made and I didn't run into any bugs.  Enemy also has plenty of replay value as each playthrough will take quite a while to finish. Then restart, try a new build and new tactics. My only suggestion would be bring your own music. Its rather monotone and not exciting.

Hier mal ein Video aus meiner angespielt Session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqKTyVb-qpA&list=UUxvWexE5bbJIYKH8RFsnRXg

Enemy spielt sich wirklich wie ein altes Oldschoolrollenspiel.
Für die alten Veteranen, es spielt sich etwa wie die alten Xcom oder Jagged Alliance Teile.
Das ganze kommt dann noch in Minecraftklötzchenoptik daher.
Insgesamt für den modernen Spieler recht gewöhnungsbedürftig, vor allem auch weil es sich sehr langsam entfaltet. Die Lernkurve ist recht steil am Anfang. Man bekommt allerdings die wichtigsten Dinge durch ein kleines Tutorial mit Tooltips erklärt. 
Das Spiel an sich spielt sich dann aber recht intuitiv und ist fordernd in den Kämpfen. Das schöne: Permadeath. Ist einer eurer Charaktere (ihr steuert ein Squad aus 3 Figuren) tot, dann bleibt er es auch. Aber ihr könnt in ""Städten"" wieder neue rekrutieren.
Ein Herausstellungsmerkal des Spiels ist das Physiksystem. Regelmäßig fliegen uns die Blöcke der Spielwelt um die Ohren.
Mein bestes Erlebnis: Ein Gegner kommt mit einem Baseballschläger auf mich zu, drischt ordentlich auf mich ein und schickt mich in bester Dragonballmanier einmal durch ein paar Hauswände^^ Alles stürzt um mich herum ein^^

Die Eingewöhnung ins Spiel dauert etwas, aber wenn man sich mal an das Bewegungs- und Aktionssystem gewöhnt hat, spielt es sich sehr gut und fesselt einen lange vor den Bildschirm. Der angenehm hohe Schwierigkeitsgrad trägt einen Teil dazu bei!

Ich kanns jedem empfehlen der auf traditionelle rundenbasierte Rollenspiele steht!
