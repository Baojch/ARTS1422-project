My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706940737,1706940737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Fated Souls 3 (AKA Kara's Fate) is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

This time Andorlea/Warfare/SimProse/whatever other shell account this guy uses to try hide his identity has once more stamped out a painfully generic copy + paste RPG Maker asset flip.  In fact, they were so lazy about this, it's in-game title is ""Kara's Fate"" but I guess he changed his mind halfway through his weekend-long development cycle and dumped it on Steam with a different name.  You can see they don't even take their own shovelware games seriously, so why should gamers?

It's horribly basic, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, full of stock copy + pasted RPG Maker assets... no real game development has taken place here, this is just a cash grab, it's shovelware polluting Steam for profit.  This ""developer"" has dumped over 100 copy+pasted RPG Maker asset flips onto Steam, and keeps pumping out minimum viable product RPG Maker asset flips as rapidly as possible to try gouge gamers.

We must ask why this ongoing pollution has any serious value for gamers or the gaming industry.  This kind of cash grab construction kit shovelware from bad actors like Andorlea gives amateur developers a bad name.  This pollution takes marketing space away from genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing, and making real games instead of copying+pasting premade assets in a children's video game construction kit.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games.  This pollution is harmful to Steam, to gamers and the gaming industry.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Fated Souls 3 has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is so lazy, the ""developer"" copy + pasting this from the previous asset flip in the series, it's for looting 100 gold, this takes less than half an hour, trivial to achieve, but less than 2 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 2 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who didn't bother to played the game?  Trading cards.  People will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Fated Souls 3 has the ridiculous price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.",1693829840,1694007232,False,4,1,0.231807723641395569,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Fated Souls 3 ist ein 16-bit style RPG und der letzte Teil einer Trilogie.
Man muss aber nicht die ersten beiden gespielt haben um die Story des dritten Teils verstehen und nachvollziehen zu können.

Wir spielen eine Gruppe (anfangs erstmal nur bestehend aus Damen), die durch die Welt streifen, Abenteuer erleben und einer Menge Gefahren trotzen müssen.

Dabei haben wir viele Kisten zu looten, kämpfen rundenbasiert gegen eine Menge sowohl humanoider als auch tierischer Gegner und leveln uns so immer weiter nach oben.

Ich muss aber ehrlich gesagt sagen ohne nun die Story zu spoilern, dass diese mich nicht mal annähernd gepackt hat. Das Game ist schlicht weg langweilig und sehr eintönig.

Der Soundtrack ist immer der gleiche, das Game lässt sich nur in einer Auflösung von gefühlt 800x600 starten, sodass man immer nur in einem kleinen Fenster zocken kann, es sei denn man hat einen Monitor aus dem Mittelalter.

Nein, ganz einfach nein!

Das Einzige, was mich dazu getrieben hat, dieses Game wirklich weiterzuspielen waren die Erfolge, da es mit lediglich 8 Achievements, von denen kein einziges storybasiert ist, echt einfach auf 100% zu bringen ist.

Nachdem das letzte Achievement aufgeploppt ist, habe ich auch instant deinstalliert, ergo habe ich die Story auch nicht durchgespielt und habe es auch echt nicht vor!

Kann ich absolut nicht empfehlen.

Müsst ihr wissen.

首先剧情方面，故事围绕着主角Kara与其女儿寻找失踪的丈夫Galahar展开，原本这是一个充满情感张力和冒险元素的题材。然而游戏中的叙事方式较为平淡，人物塑造也略显单薄，对话和情节转折处往往欠缺深度和悬念，难以引发玩家的共鸣和情感投入。

其次游戏性方面，作为一款ARPG战斗系统的打磨明显不足。打击感欠佳，技能树设计过于简单，升级与装备系统缺乏多样性，导致长时间游玩后感到重复且乏味。此外跳跃、踢击等动作设计虽新颖，但在实际操作中并未有效融入到战斗机制中，感觉更像是为了创新而创新，而非为了提升游戏体验。

技术层面，画面表现并不能匹配当今玩家对于高质量游戏的标准。尽管官方宣传称画面精致，但在实际运行中，场景建模粗糙，贴图质量参差不齐，动画过渡生硬，帧数不稳定等问题时常出现，严重影响了沉浸式的游戏体验。

另外游戏的优化问题也不容忽视。在PC以及其他平台上，频繁遭遇性能下降和卡顿现象，特别是在某些复杂的场景或是大规模战斗中，这些问题尤为突出，这对于一个角色扮演游戏来说是非常致命的缺陷。

最后就整体完成度而言，《命运之魂3》给人的感觉更像是匆忙上线的产品，其中包含了许多未经充分测试和完善的功能，bug较多，部分任务逻辑混乱，指引不够清晰，使得玩家在探索世界的过程中不断遭受挫折。

总结起来，《命运之魂3》是一款未能充分利用其潜在故事魅力和角色扮演机制的游戏，技术上的短板以及设计上的瑕疵使得它难以在竞争激烈的市场中脱颖而出。尽管它的基础设定和主题颇具吸引力，但实际的游戏体验却让人失望。希望开发者能够在未来版本中积极采纳玩家反馈，努力改进并补足这些明显的不足之处。",1660208835,1711791780,False,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Une nouveauté dans cet épisode : les monstres n'appariassent plus de façon aléatoire lorsque vous marchez : désormais ils sont visibles sur la map sous forme de petits nuages bleus qui déclenchent un combats si vous les touchez, vous pouvez donc les éviter si vous le souhaitez.
C'est dommage que l'on ne puisse pas faire de capture d'écran car c'est le plus joli des trois épisode de la série.

Le scénario est toujours aussi bon, et surtout les dialogues sont beaucoup plus faciles à comprendre pour les non-anglophones.

A noter que ce jeu est beaucoup plus facile que les autres, il suffit de lancer le sort ""paralys"" de Dorothy et ça paralyse TOUS LES BOSS du jeu, sauf les deux dernier à la toute fin du jeu .. on peut donc les canarder à volonté en toute sécurité lol

The grammar was surprisingly much better than most rpg games but the story itself was much more generic and uninteresting. 

Parts of the game where goofy (unintended) like how you can't jump over a crack in the ground so you need to find jump in a chest. (seriously, you actually need to find ""jump"" 'as in when you go in the air by moving your legs' inside of a chest. 

The art and look of the game was actually very nice and left a nice atmosphere. 

The game is priced a bit high but still within reason.

The music was OK, a bit irritating at times but OK.

So when it came down to it, the gameplay itself is what set me to give this a negative review. 

In the first hour or so of the game, all fights accept minibosses are pretty much free, and if you win simply be spamming attack. Then by midgame you start using skills on all enemies, and you occasionally will need to use a potion to heal up or replenish mana. Late game you focus on paralyzing the enemy or putting them to sleep. 

In short this was a walking simulator........

Then you get to the end. You fight the ""final"" boss (but the of course its predictably not the final boss) and after a tedious fight of kinda repetitive healing you are tasked with slaying the Fallen Angel.

The difficulty curve for this fight was so extreme that it was annoying. It has an attack called ""reaper"" that deals about 600 dmg to all of your allies at once. It has so much evasion that paralysis and sleep don't land (unless i got unlucky a ton) and its health could be anywhere between 10k and 100k.

In short after thinking about it this is what you would likely need to beat her
- 100 50% team heal items
- your cleric team healing every single turn
- one character and one character only able to attack because the other 2 are so busy team healing.
^and that might not be enough but.

In short, this and all the other reason's listed collectively where enough for me to give this game a negative review.

This shows that there were really no testing on the steam achievements as most of the steam achievements for this game are GENERIC and the only game specific achievement is not achieveable at all.

Here are the details about why the hidden achievement (Defeat the Wicked Angel) cannot be triggered.

I finished the game and killed the Wicked Angel.
After the Wicked Angel is dead, the game goes into cut-scene, and then ending credits.
After the ending credit, the game go back to title screen where you have 
1. New Game 2. Continue (Load Game) 3. Exit.

So because of that there is no way to save the game AFTER the Wicked Angel is killed.
If we load the last safe file, we get into the scene before killing the Wicked Angel.

Because of the way the achievements are implemented in this game, the Wicked Angel Achievement is NOT triggered, as it really depends on the load file.

For example, when I have 5000 gold, the steam achievement is not triggered.
However, I saved the game, exit and then load the game again (with the 5000 gold).
During the load game, the achievement for 5000 gold is triggered.

So, because there is NO WAY to save the game after the Wicked Angel is killed, the achievement CANNOT be triggered.
