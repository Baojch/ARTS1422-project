My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705644105,1705644105,True,2,0,0.481054365634918213,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[b]My positives[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]The music that plays during attempts on getting a best score is fantastic to listen to;[/b], it just sucks that later on during playing the game, I had to mute it entirely mainly because I wanted to concentrate on getting the last Steam achievement of getting a best score of at least 300. With that out of the way, I can turn on the audio in future playthroughs.
[*] [b]The amount of skin customization unlockables to view and choose from is nice, along with the option to just randomize the customizations per attempt;[/b] admittedly, even though for the whole game, I used the default tail customization because it's more identifiable from a glance when staying on the same circle node and circling around it repeatedly, which can obscure the much smaller circle nodes.[/list]

[b]My negatives[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]The video tutorial on learning the game upon opening the game for the first time doesn't work;[/b] I'm assuming what the video the game is talking about is this YouTube video being https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhI2IyHf2lk - which is more of a tips and tricks video, but which would actually be helpful more so on reframing how I approached on how I approached the game, because I only got the tutorial where the only action I can do is hold the space bar to cling onto a circle node. I feel it would be much helpful if the contents of the YouTube video would be integrated into the game, incase the YouTube video disappears, or because of a lack of internet connection to see the video.
[*] [b]What determines when to grab onto a circle node seems to feel too random, which can result in unexpected attempt ends;[/b] this is the big thing that I have mixed feelings about this, and I'm overall negative as I play through the game and actually got all of the Steam achievements, is that it feels like I'm playing a harder version of One More Line first instead of an easier version of One More Line, before being able to gradually getting to the harder version. I imagined an easier version of One More Line would be having a cone or view highlight on show what circle nodes can be grabbed, and an arrow cursor to show that circle node to grab to when doing the action. As-is, saying both of those things of what I imagined an easier version, this game when playing asks the player to deal with the obstacles more on feeling and intuition, for yes, there is some luck and twitch-based skill involved, but sometimes it feels like it's my fault when I thought it was going to grab one circle node that I expected to but I grabbed another one unexpectedly, and I didn't have enough reaction time to avoid, ending my attempt. The tips and tricks video that I watched helped to demystify how to approach the game and how to maneuver through the circle nodes, but I'm not sure how much it addresses the more potentially difficult circle nodes to encounter through random placement.
[*] [b]The game over results screen where the numerical statistics are shown isn't personalized due to lack of showing where the attempt ended;[/b] yeah, the game shows when the attempt ended when encountering it, having the view moving backwards on the amount of progress before speeding up, but the game doesn't show that again, which makes the impact of the end result feel less meaningful. I had to screenshot twice, one I quickly had to screenshot on when the end attempt happened, and the other the statistics. 
[*] [b]There is no in-game option to tweak the volume of the audio, only on or off;[/b] this is a problem when playing the game with headset since I would have to turn the game down to 5% to 10% so my ears don't get harmed; as such, I had to turn it down through the computer system settings as a workaround.[/list]

[b]My eehs/neutral feelings[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]The customization options when unlocked doesn't show the requirement number on total distance anymore;[/b] on one side, yeah, it's already unlocked, don't need the numbers anymore, it's too much clutter, it might be confused with having to still unlock the customization option, but on the other side, it would be nice to just show the number itself, make you reflect your journey through unlocking it, like a timestamp on when you unlocked something.
[*] [b]I have no idea how good the multiplayer portion of this game functions, which may be a selling point for those that played One More Line on mobile, but wanted a multiplayer experience with other people;[/b] yeah, sorry, I don't think I have anyone else besides me that would like to play this game, it's neat that this is exclusive to the Steam version of the game, since the other versions are on mobile instead.[/list]

I don't think I would necessarily recommend this game to people that are expecting something that is difficult but fair, and I say this as someone who played through it and enjoyed it despite the issues, and got the hardest Steam achievement being to get at least a best score of 300. For me, it feels a bit too random, perhaps less so with the tips from the YouTube video that I now watched after completing the game, although it would help a lot more if the video worked properly, or find a way to have the tips and tricks of the game be integrated into the game itself that would help reframe my approach to the game in the first place; It's going to be barely a dislike overall.",1700093718,1700093758,False,3,0,0.56764298677444458,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Unser Schiff rast von unten nach oben durch eine Röhre, in der es viele Kreise gibt. Berühren wir einen der Kreise oder den Rand der Röhre sind wir sofort tot und das Spiel startet neu. Steuern können wir unser Schiff nicht direkt, es fliegt an sich immer geradeaus. Sind wir im Einzugsbereich eines Kreises, können wir auf eine Taste drücken und wir sind konstant in einer runden Umlaufbahn um den Kreis. Drücken wir erneut, verlassen wir die Umlaufbahn und rasen wieder stur geradeaus weiter. Eine Richtungsänderung geschieht also nur durch das Verlassen der Umlaufbahn. In einer Umlaufbahn ist die Regel, daß wir am Rand der Röhre sterben, ausgesetzt. Die Umlaufbahnen können also auch deutlich größer als die Röhre sein. 

Das Spielprinzip ist sehr simpel und auch wenn man es sofort intuitiv versteht, dauert es, bis man sich daran gewöhnt hat. Am Anfang stirbt man. Oft. Ständig. So oft, daß man leicht die Lust verlieren kann. Aber man sollte sich nicht frustrierend lassen, denn immer mehr hat man den Bogen raus und überlebt immer länger. Schwierig bleibt das Spiel dennoch, was unter anderem an dem ziemlich hohen Tempo liegt, das man leider nicht reduzieren kann. 

Es gibt auch keine anderen Modi, es gibt keine Veränderung des Spielprinzips. Es ist ein Mini-Game mit einer einzigen Idee und einer einzigen Spielmechanik. Erreichen kann man nur einen höheren Highscore. Immerhin gibt es einen lokalen Multiplayer für bis zu vier Personen. 

Ein typisches Tabletspielchen, das auch ansonsten extrem minimalistisch ist. Die Grafik bewegt sich nahe einem ""Pong""-Niveau und auch die Musik ist gelooptes Einerlei. Und doch kann das Spiel Spaß machen, wenn man denn auf solche Spielchen, die ""Flappy Bird"" als komplexes Tiefgründigkeit erscheinen lassen, steht.

O engraçado é que o desafio dele é simples. Esse é o ponto. Você pensa: ""não acredito que não consigo!"".
É aí que você tenta várias vezes.

Nas primeiras partidas é um jogo divertido. Porém, quando você começa a dar Restart várias vezes, se torna frustrante e você percebe que é difícil pelos motivos errados. Muitas vezes o seu personagem não gruda nos círculos, às vezes gruda, mas não roda, vai direto em direção ao círculo e a gente perde. Mas o erro mais irritante é quando o personagem se agarra em um círculo muito acima na fase, fazendo bater em um círculo que está na sua frente, mas o jogo simplesmente ""não quis"" que você agarrasse.
Mesmo com tantos erros, o jogo ainda pode ser divertido até certo ponto... Principalmente se você tiver amigos para jogar localmente, porque o modo Multiplayer Local é o recurso mais legal do jogo (e também é uma das únicas diferenças da versão Steam pra versão Android).

Gameplay-wise, there isn't a whole lot to say. You zoom through, between two parallel lines, avoiding colored circles, with the ability to hook-and-latch on to them, spinning you around for speed boosts. Collision with either parallel line means certain death, and sometimes it's tricky to navigate the circles, without crashing into another one on accident. The graphics are fairly decent. There's a customization menu for your little spaceship, so you can add custom trailers and tails and ""outfits"" to it. (I wore a tophat, and had an orange squiggly line following me).

It presents a great colorful main screen and even at a first glance it seems all quite well-made for being a indie game.
It also features a customization section and multiplayer, which is always nice if they're playable and well-realized.
The core of the game is a one-button, fast-paced action timing game: you'll play in a vertical scenario as a colorful line and you'll come across lots of different objects - you'll have to hold space in order to link to them, and they'll make you endlessly run into a circle orbit around them.
The game is endless - your goal will be to reach the longest distance without crashing into the walls!
Or without crashing into the objects themselves.. =P
The multiplayer section of the game is really entertaining if you've got someone to play with, and given the simplicity of the controls used you can play virtually everywhere!
Overall, of course, it gets boring if you play it for more than 10-15 minute sessions - the bulk of the game is always the same and you won't be happy to link your colored thing to static objects for hours..
But everything is really nice, it's a great time waster and it's so nicely made that you'll find no bugs or hitbox problems: you can stay safe that you'll never encounter any kind of in-game issue.
And this is nice - if you like the premises, if you're into these fast action games, this one is definitely easy to learn and gets quite hard when you'll have to deal with multiple orbits and lots of objects to avoid.

The graphics are negligible because the developer couldn't afford an artist.   Controls are ultra simple, one button.   While the game is priced cheaply, there's no compelling reason to play it because you can play these kinds of games for free on mobile.

The idea of this game is you are going down a long two walled corridor viewing your player piece from a top down view.  Your players speed is constant and you begin on a very straight trajectory, the game places obstacles in your path and the only way to turn to get around them is to use other obstacles as pivot points. I really like the idea but the reason I took the time to describe it is because the controls ruin this game for me.   What I experience is I can have a really nice idea in my head of which trajectory I would like to take but which obstacle the piece chooses to pivot around is controlled by some unseen and not entirely predictable interaction with the relative positioning of the player and obstacles.  The result is that the really beautiful enjoyable part of the game becomes a rare treat in the midst of a lot of frustration.  And don't get me wrong here. I like difficult games, it is part of why I chose to try this.

有趣的磨时间小游戏。
操作只需要一个鼠标/手柄的一个键，通关点击屏幕，一直保持直线走的小球就会自动连接就近的小圈圈做圆周运动，下次放开按键就会切线飞出，当然可以速点来轻微改变运动轨迹，失败的因素就是撞上墙壁或者小圈圈。

有多种可自定义装扮（小帽子）、小尾巴、地图背景，这些都会根据飞行总距离或绕圈数解锁。
支持单人或者本地多人游戏。
多人模式在同一个键盘就可以展开对决，有分屏或同屏，有比拼速度或距离或者纯粹苟活等等模式。

主菜单的“怎么玩”点了没反应，事实上每次开始游戏都有一个图例教程，一秒就能理解。
音乐方面，魔性，好听。
节奏比较快，需要耐心玩。

Do you like bright colors, circular drawings, and watching your life spiraling away, out of control, while a heavily beat-based synthetic soundtrack serves to add to the tension? If you do, then this game is just the right thing for you!

All kidding aside, this is actually a really fun and addictive game, just watch the Steam trailer, it tells you pretty much all you need to know about this game. It's played with one button, that's it. So it feels like a runner, but at the same time, forward progress is also as fast or as slow as you wish it to be. The game is difficult, that's for sure, but the playing mechanics that gives you some time to breathe from time to time as needed is a much appreciated gesture.

I got this game in a bundle, but based on how many runs I went back for again and again, I can tell that this is worth the store price. And if you have a few friends who can gather and play locally split screen, this may be even more fun. I understand that there are mobile versions of this game out there that are free with advertisements, but you definitely can't play split screen on that. 

I think anyone who likes single objective games of reaching a higher score or who likes to challenge friends with such a task should try this game. It's simple to pick up, again, just one button. But it sure is difficult to master. There are achievements on Steam as well to drive the single-player game as well. There are trading cards too.",1528561846,1528561988,True,8,1,0.548680663108825684,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I would really like to give this game a good review; it's a neat concept that, to begin with at least, seems quite well executed.  Unfortunately, the more I played, the more I began to suspect that it's actually riddled with bugs.  The gameplay is simple, you teather to the circles in your path by holding space, and then orbit around them, de-teathering by releasing space.  The problem is, the game dosen't seem to think that it's all that important which circle you teather to when you press space.  At first it seemed that the teather attached to which ever circle was closest, but the more I played, the more times I noticed that apparent rule being broken, and the more it started to annoy me when I died because of it.  One More Line bills itself as a ""skill timing game"" but the most important aspect in any game of skill is consistancy in its mechanics, and One More Line lacks that consistancy.  Perhaps there's some qualifier to the rule of ""attach to closest"" that would explain the apparently random cases where the teather attaches to the seemingly ""wrong"" circle, but the tutorial video is bugged out and won't play, so any explanation it might have contained is lost.",1494645504,1494645504,False,7,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Short lived, limited ambitions infinite runner in which you grapple around pegs to avoid collisions. Imprecise and nauseating. Gets finnicky and hard fast.

Nice visual Presentation. Nice audio work. Easy to understand mechanics. Xbox 360 support. 4-way local co-op. Addictive. Too hard. Especially when you are forced to grapple a closeby peg, you rotate too fast around the peg and the engine does a poor job of translating your release angle to you. Even on wider shots it can be tricky to release at the right time. This seems to also be display-size related and the relation of screen real estate to gamepad sensitivity. In summary the gimmick and controls dont really work out all that well outside of the mobile touch oriented interface it was designed for.

What I would wish for: Casual mode with less obstacles for everyday people to challenge themselves for longer without restarting to much

Mechanics: Propelled forward when you see an obstacle hit and hold button, you will lock on to it and spin circles, release button and try to keep going forward, if you hit a snag or have a bad angle, lock on an obstacle again. Whoever goes in straight lines longest wins

The audio and vague seventies aesthetic really help the title a lot. But there are few assets and few mechanics on display here and ultimately it is one just one of those easily outcompeted titles that clutter the library.

스팀에 이 게임이 모습을 드러낸 소식은 저도 처음에는 잘 모르고 있었지만, 심심풀이로 즐겨하기에 괜찮은 게임입니다.

심플한 배경과 캐릭터를 갖고 게임을 시작하게 되는데 처음에 시작할 때에는 간단한 튜토리얼 설명을 통해 게임을 접해보는 경험을 가지게 됩니다. 올곧게 위로 올라가고 있는 플레이어를 주변에 있는 다양한 크기와 종류의 장애물을 중심으로 돌면서 통과하는 것이 관건입니다. 타이밍이나 방향이 괜찮을수록 하이패스하게 과감한 진행을 할 수도 있습니다.

원심력을 이용하여 타이밍에 따라 원을 작게 또는 크게 그리기도 하는데, 그 상황 속에서 일어나는 다양한 변수들이 다른 장애물들에 의해 일어나기 때문에 약간 랜덤틱 하면서도 그런 점들이 지루함을 덜어주기도 합니다. 그만큼 오랫동안 플레이할 수 있는 게임이기에는 조금 무리가 될 수 있겠지만 친구들과 같이 하거나 심심풀이로 할 때에는 재미있습니다.

저도 한 때 이 게임에 푹 빠진 적이 있었습니다. 최고 기록에 욕심이 나기도 했고, 플레이를 할 수 있는 다양한 방법들(장애물을 빠르게 뚫고 지나가는 하이패스 전술, 장애물에 원심력을 이용하자마자 다른 장애물로 뛰어넘는 타잔 전술 등[?])은 게임에 재미를 더해주기도 했었고 나름 기묘한 재미를 연상케하기도 했었고 그걸로 재미를 만들어내기도 했었습니다.

스팀에 있는 One More Line 의 경우에는 아쉽게도 세이브파일이 스팀 클라우드에 동기화가 되지 않아 다른 PC 에서 게임을 즐길 때에는 기록이 초기화가 되는 단점이 있습니다. 물론 플레이를 새롭게 하여 플레이 기록을 세워두거나 게임을 삭제할 때 기록도 함께 삭제가 되는 것은 아니지만 저 같은 경우에는 그런 동기화 기능이 지원되지 않았던 점이 조금 아쉬웠던 것 같습니다.

결국 이 게임을 하면서 중요한 것은 침착함과 성실성 입니다. 한 번에 흔히 말하는 큰 그림을 생각하면서 점수를 뽑아내는 방법도 물론 스릴 있겠지만, 이 게임의 본래 규칙대로 차근차근 장애물들을 하나, 둘 씩 통과하면서 차근차근 점수를 쌓는 것이 더 안정적인 점도 그렇고 후반으로 갈 수록 등장하는 장애물의 크기 또한 어렵게 나오기 때문에 침착함을 항상 잃지 말아야 합니다.

그리고 여러 명이서 플레이를 할 수 있도록 최대 4인까지의 멀티플레이 지원이 가능해졌습니다. 직접적인 네트워크를 이용한 멀티플레이는 지원이 되지 않는 듯 하지만 친구들과 모여있을 때 함께 즐기기에는 안성맞춤이라고 생각합니다. 게임성에 비해 가격에 대해 고민이 되시는 분들이 계신다면 게임 세일을 할 때(₩ 1,100) 구매하시는 쪽으로 추천해드리고 싶습니다.",1488982946,1488982946,True,10,21,0.626699090003967285,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The following is my opinion.

One More Line is a great little arcade/party game where you swing around circles on a randomly generated course in an attempt to beat your high score or your friends, colouring the track with the constantly growing trail of your semicircle character.

You must hold the “space” key (“A” if you wish to play using an Xbox controller and “X” for PlayStation controllers) in a skillfully timed manner to navigate through the course, trying not to crash on the edges of the map or the circles that you swing around. Be careful though, because one mistake and you’re gone.

The game features 2-4 player local co-op so you can race against your mates in a bunch of different gamemodes such as Chaos, Destruction, Time Attack and Survival, or if you don’t have any friends you can play by yourself and try to beat your own high score.

As you play and accumulate mileage you automatically unlock new hats and trails to customise your icon, to show off to your friends how hardcore you are.

От игрока потребуется отличная реакция, маневрировать здесь получается только за счет случайно расположенных на пути точек. Проверьте свои навыки и постарайтесь установить мировой рекорд. Оформление графической составляющей радует. Минималистичный вид вместе с яркими цветами и хорошо проработанными элементами делают картинку насыщенной. Динамика достигается благодаря простой анимации и эффектам. Отдельного внимания заслуживает музыкальная составляющая, в которой интересный повторяющийся саундтрек совмещен со множеством звуков.
Суть геймплея максимально проста: необходимо пройти как максимальное расстояние. Но изюминка в том, что линия летит исключительно вперед и на приличной скорости. На пути у нее будут различные точки, которые можно как обогнуть, так и совершить вокруг них круговое движение. В зависимости от пиктограммы внутри сферы определяется несколько показателей: радиус и скорость вращения. Управление выполнено подстать игровой механике и осуществляется всего одним тапом. Кстати, продолжительность нажатия имеет разный эффект: уклонение и, собственно, вращение.
One More Line - идеальный вариант для тех, кто ищет качественный и оригинальный таймкиллер. Ничего сложного, но игра легко увлекает и не дает расслабиться на протяжении нескольких часов.

The concept is crazy simple; don't hit any objects or veer off the course.  The problem is you can't simply steer where you want to go.  Your only means of changing direction is to grapple hook onto the direct objects that clutter the track.  Once attached to these objects you'll start to spin around them and will continue doing so until you release.

The speed of your ship is what makes this such a challenging game.  You only have split seconds to decide if you should attach yourself to an object.  The farther away from the object the better as you'll have more time to think and examine any immediate threats.  This is a huge problem as one of the easiest ways to fail is to swing smack into a near by object while rotating.  Also, if you're too close when you hook on your ship rotates so quickly its basically impossible to tell which direction you'll be heading once you release.


As you continue playing though the game you'll unlock different options to customize your experience.  You can choose different outfits for your character and different tracks for the contrails of your ship.  These choices aren't very thrilling but they at least provide an excuse to continue playing.  Then if the challenge of beating your high-score isn't enough to keep you entertained there is an option for local multiplayer which can go up to four players.  A series of different game modes offer quite a bit of variety for multiplayer.  This is a very fast paced and unpredictable game the would be perfect for parties or a good laugh at a competitive get to together.

The sound design is where this game really shines.  The music is thrilling, it keeps you pumped up and ready to face the crazy trials this game will put you through.  Death is so quick and is written off almost instantly.  Simply click the retry button and you thrown straight back into the world.  Meanwhile the game cheers you on in its rhythmic robot voice singing out ""retry"" or ""one more line"".  This feels kind of reminiscent of Minecraft's ""just one more block"" mentality.

There is no doubt that this is a super light game.  That being said One More Line is quite fun and very addicting.  Most rounds won't even last half a minute.  I almost wish the ships speed would have started out slower and got faster as you progressed upwards.  My main complaint is there is little to no time to react and stop yourself from swinging right into another object.  Also there are times when I'm certain I press the grapple button a fair distance away to find myself slamming right into the object.

It's a simple one-button game, an endless runner. where you keep moving forwards, try to avoid obstacles and stay in the main path by clinging on to these obstacles, rotating around them until you release the button which will propel you towards the desired direction.
The graphics are simplistic and charming with a few choices for the main ""blob"", music is fitting if not a little repetitive after a while and the whole production/programming is spot on, but for the next couple of issues..
The two issues that make the game unplayable in the later levels (read [b]achievements[/b]) are:
a. Sometimes the hold on the obstacle isn't released the moment you let the button go so you cannot predict the exact direction. Similarly when you try to grab a node, sometimes it won't react instantly and in this game you need fast reflexes and very responsive control of your ""line"".
b. (This is the most important problem) Sometimes the algorithm will choose the target that is coming [b]straight at you[/b] to cling on to so it's bye-bye with a head on collision.

I expected to grapple the nearest grapple point. However, I have had it grapple something halfway across the screen and sling me into the grapple point nearest to me, MULTIPLE times. (that kills you by the way)

If you don't mind having literally no means of predicting your path, and praying that you grapple to the closest point, then the game is really good.

This inability to grapple how I wanted to aggravated me to no end and made this game impossible to enjoy. I loved everything else about it, but the inability to know what will be grappled made it unbearable for me.

C'est frustrant, mais c'est toujours pas fini, j'ai une configuration médiocre je l'avoue, mais je peux joué sans peine a des jeux tel que Rocket League, CSGO ou encore Minecraft, et pourtant, One More Line bug, il se passe défois presque une seconde entre le moment ou j'appuie sur espace et le moment ou l'action ce produit, je ne recommande donc malheureusement toujours pas, en attente d'un patch corrigeant cela et de plus de succès steam !

Оформление графической составляющей радует. Минималистичный вид вместе с яркими цветами и хорошо проработанными элементами делают картинку насыщенной. Динамика достигается благодаря простой анимации и эффектам. Отдельного внимания заслуживает музыкальная составляющая, в которой интересный повторяющийся саундтрек совмещен со множеством звуков.
Суть геймплея максимально проста: необходимо пройти как максимальное расстояние. Но изюминка в том, что линия летит исключительно вперед и на приличной скорости. На пути у нее будут различные точки, которые можно как обогнуть, так и совершить вокруг них круговое движение. В зависимости от пиктограммы внутри сферы определяется несколько показателей: радиус и скорость вращения. Управление выполнено подстать игровой механике и осуществляется всего одним тапом. Кстати, продолжительность нажатия имеет разный эффект: уклонение и, собственно, вращение.

The problem with that version, is that every 3 runs or so, you are bombarded with advertisements. In a game where you can make mistakes that will kill you in an instant, those 3 runs sometimes will go by so fast, you get interrupted by an ad quite often. Not a truly gamebreaking thing, but an extremely annoying thing none the less.

So why get the Steam version if mobile is free? Well, I for one prefer the feeling of pressing a key over tapping a screen. Sometimes touch screens are wonky, and will register your touch, even if you aren't actually touching the screen. This can lead to frustrating deaths in this game. By pressing a key (Which is the Q key by the way) that random element is eliminated. 
If you are bad at games like I am, you will also appreciate being able to play uninterupted by advertisements every time you make a misake. I've had great runs, and I have spurts of really really bad runs. It's nice not having to look at yet another Walmart Special when I'm goofing up.

And let's be honest, this game costs less than a Big-Mac burger. Well worth the $3 pricetag.",1440992876,1440992876,True,14,2,0.649704039096832275,1,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're curious, search the name and play it for free on-line (that version DOES NOT have ads, as far as I can tell). If after that, you want to pay $3 for it, do so to support the dev. If you're a card addict, wait for the game to go on sale.

And, if you want to read the dev telling me things I already know about this game (because I paid money for it and played it) and how to spend my money. . .and trying to tell me why certain features are worth my money (SPOILER ALERT: it's because they are fun), then check the comments for my review. This feature comes free of charge, but is technically an ad. Which is weird, because I paid for an ad free version.
-------------------------------------------------------------

I wish there was a neutral rating for games like this. It's fine. It does what it does and it's okay. It's nothing great, but it's not a bad game.

One More Line is a simple game. You're a little ""D""-looking thing and you being propelled upward. There are obstacles in your way. If you smash into them, you die. If you smash into the wall, you die. If you click with the mouse, you'll be pulled into the orbit of of the obstacles. If you click again, you'll be released. The score goes up as long as you're not orbiting an obstacles and the goal is to get as high a score as possible.

And it's fine. The name is true, you'll want to give it another go. The (I think) one music track is funky. It requires some skill, there's challenge. It's fine.

Here's the thing though: it's a mobile port. Not only is it a mobile port, but it's mobile port that is free on android phone. Don't have an Android phone? You can play it on-line for free. Now, this isn't necessarily bad. Enchanted Cave 2 is also free on-line and that game is great. However, it has a lot more depth. There's more to do. One More Line, is the perfect mobile game. It's simple, it's quick, it's best when played in short bursts. There is not a lot to it.

Also, it's a lazy mobile port. It tells you to ""touch"" and the little tutorial screen that pops up the first time you play does not seem to want to go away by clicking with the mouse.

Granted, there are features not in other versions. Apparently, the multi-player is exclusive to Steam. However, I, personally, am never going to make use of that. There's cards, there's achievements.

$3 isn't a lot, but it feels a bit too much for this. This is a perfectly fine game to get on sale for $0.99 if you like achievements and cards.",1440797345,1441329184,False,179,11,0.768199026584625244,13,True,False,False,False,,,
