Cat President is a political dating sim set in a world where politicians have been replaced by cats. You play as the campaign manager of one of six presidential campaigns, each headed by its own cat-nidate and with its own nuances and storyline. Each of the cats is his own distinct person, and each tells his own story of his journey through the political process. 

Classifying Cat President purely as a dating sim is a bit misleading. Unlike other dating sims, the player doesn’t get the option of shopping around or flirting with multiple potential partners. Once they’ve made their choice, they stick with that particular storyline until its conclusion. Within a particular storyline choice, the gameplay is fairly linear, consisting of a few binary choices that determine which of three endings the story will have, but do very little in terms of branching narratives. More than anything, it’s a visual novel about human-cat romance during a presidential campaign. 

The strength of Cat President lies in its writing and its ability to weave humour and political satire into a genuinely sweet story. Its writing and dialogue are keenly aware of the absurdity of its premise, both in the sense of cat politicians, and the ins and outs of politics as a whole. The game constantly pokes fun at the political process, but masks it criticisms and commentary behind pictures of cute cats. Commentary on xenophobia and racism in immigration policy, for example, become more palatable to discuss when the one doing the discussing is a dog wearing cat ears and insisting he’s legally a cat. The role of PACs and dark money become more entertaining to consider when their source is a sneering picture of one of the devs. Cat President, in reframing politics through an inherently absurd lens, is able to shed a new light on the accepted absurdity of democracy itself.

Cat President is clearly a product of the 2016 presidential elections. Some cats and political supporters strongly represent certain parties and politicians. It’s in the ideals Cat President holds and the perspective it offers on the inherent absurdity of democracy, though, that I find it more interesting. The world has changed since 2016. It’s become more cynical, more authoritarian, and less interested in good faith political discourse. In many ways, Cat President reflects this ethos, through satirical dialogue about fire hydrants and chew toys, but also in the very premise of its world. It’s a game that both faithfully believes in democracy, and sees its current incarnation for the farce that it is. It’s a surprisingly insightful and sincere game for a dating sim of cat politicians.

I am a streamer on Twitch and I streamed it live.  I will say that my chat enjoyed the game and we got a lot of laughs with it!  

It is nice that you can play it more than once and have a different outcome.

There was a problem where my VOD was muted in one place for just one song.  In Twitch, we are not allowed to play copyrighted music on stream.  I contacted the developer about the muted song.  They were not aware it had become copyrighted.  They said they were going to replace it with something else.  Still, it is better as a livestreamer not to have to worry about the music in a game.

In this story we streamed, I would say the first half of it was great.  We were laughing.  Some of the people in chat were participating in the choices and that made it fun.

In the second half of the game, I found I was offended by some of the non-family friendly references.  I am a family friendly streamer and this is important to me.  I found myself skipping part of the story because I didn't think it was appropriate for my viewers.  However, that is just me.  It is something that I am very strict about on my channel.

Overall, I enjoyed the game.  Not sure I would do another playthrough though.

It's honestly an entertaining game and has its funny moments and dialogues, if you can look past the dating part.

While the writers tried to somehow scramble how it's actually not into their lore, reading these cringe dialogues frankly made me feel SO WRONG AND UNCOMFORTABLE that I'm honestly surprised not more reviews, other than the polish one, pointed it out. It's sad, because if not for the dating stuff, which overshadows the good parts and actually made me feel physically sick, this game would've just been fun and nothing else.

It wasn't difficult to guess some of the plot twists, but that didn't make the execution any less fun! I still found myself taken by surprise enough that it balanced that out well, if that's something you would be concerned about.

I was NOT expecting this to kind of take a turn into a dating sim, but it's all very tongue-in-cheek and doesn't take itself too seriously, in that aspect or otherwise. It was amusing and cute. I did find myself saying several times, ""YOU CANNOT DATE A CAT."", but it was all very funny and had me in giggle fits. And not to worry, there was not anything inappropriate in regard to that part of the story.

I'm not particularly interested in politics in general, but when the actual political terms and ins and outs of actual campaigning were discussed, it wasn't dry and boring. I think it was navigated well.

My only real problem with this game is that there seems to be a little bit of trouble with the achievements unlocking; there were a few that I should have gotten but they weren't triggered somehow, so that was a bit frustrating. However this does not take away from the game itself.

I wish I could have pick an informational option for my review because it had its cute moments and its good points, but if you are looking for deep heart pulling wretch stories, this is not one of them. I got to be honest here. 

It has been awhile since I last played cat president and from what I can remember it was a bit silly. It is a story where the main character becomes the campaign manager for one of the cats running for president of the United States, and eventually falls in love. 

Although the words “girlfriend/boyfriend” are used towards their developing relationship the term, in reality, it is used loosely. This relationship tends to mimic the affection one normally has towards one of their pets, notwithstanding the unsettling words of “girlfriend/boyfriend.”

Therefore, the term is actually meant to be taken with light-hearted humor than a serious one and it does tend to do a good job delivery that perspective. I do not normally read these kind of stories as the age dynamic seems to be focused towards an age group much younger than I. However, I did find the story, at times, entertaining and dare I say it? Refreshing from the serious dark humor ones I am more used to reading. 

The age dynamics that is the focus for Cat President, I suspect, is for a younger audience under the age of 12. I only say this base on the level of my reading and subjects I was into at that age, so my perspective might be a bit bias, but I think it should not be too much different from anyone else. 

I don't think a younger audience are very much interested in politics, but in reality, the story does not broach the subject as much as one might think. The crazy dynamics existing in the current world are more complex and ruthless than the light-hearted humor of Cat President. However, it is a way to gently introduce that world to those beginning to learn. In particular, it shows how we can shape another one’s perception towards our candidate leaders and the way we can twist truth and falsehoods for our own agenda. 

In this way, Cat President was interesting for it did introduce complex problems in the gentlest way possible.

I give this review a thumbs-up with the understanding that it is meant for a younger audience. Otherwise, mature teenagers and young adults would probably feel frustrated and should look elsewhere.",1565096781,1565127593,True,2,0,0.547014415264129639,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Through a series of unfortunate events at said debate, Abigail surprisingly becomes the campaign manager for one of the six political candidates vying for the presidency of the United States. Did I mention that all of the candidates are cats? Yep you heard me correctly I said CATS! Perhaps I should explain? Years prior humans deemed themselves too corruptible and unfit for politics so they banned themselves from it and chose to hand governing over to duly elected talking felines...WHAT!?!?

[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]

This visual novels presentation is very unique in that most V.N.'s, at least most of the titles that I've read, have some form of hand drawn or C.G. artwork but there is no artwork whatsoever in Cat President-A More Purrfect Union. The entire novel uses real life photographs of people, places and the most adorable cats that you could ever hope to see...especially DJ Nibbles! That's saying something considering the fact that I'm a dog person. I found this to be a rather refreshing take on this art based genre and really enjoyed the direction in which the developer chose to present their very unique story. Also, there are some ambient sound effects included that really help with immersion as the story progresses. As the campaign manager you get to pick one of six different cat candidates to support during the political race. Add to that a number of choices that you'll have to make over the course of the narrative and this visual novel puts forth a very impressive presentation in my opinion. On a rather hilarious sidenote, one of the ""cat candidates"" is actually a dog pretending to be a cat but no one seems to notice which is quite funny. There's also a cat with a bad hairdo and a boisterous attitude that closely resembles a real life U.S. political candidate. Cute cat photographs, alot of side-splitting humor and a story that manages very well to keep your interest makes for a wonderful presentation for this very odd story.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]

This was definitely one of the more funny and light hearted visual novels that I've read so far on Steam and not because of the completely ludicrous storyline but more for the developers hilarious sense of humor and satire of the United States political scene as well as the cat candidate that I chose to support during the presidential campaign. The V.N. can be enjoyed by anyone whether you're into politics or not so if you're not a fan of politics PLEASE don't let that deter you from trying this highly entertaining title. As far as options go, there are a number of Steam Achievements to hunt down and Steam Trading Cards to collect. In conclusion, with it's over the top story, humorous situations and cute kitty cats, Cat President-A More Purrfect Union makes for a fascinating read and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel, political and cat fans one and all.",1554042077,1554042077,True,20,5,0.691014230251312256,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That’s right, those cute and adorable fuzzy animals are in charge for the last 20 years. To everyone’s surprise, the country is better than ever, but it’s 2016, and once again it’s election time. Can you choose the best cat president from all the possible candidates?!

Developed and published by [i]Oh, a Rock! Studios[/i] (creators of the recent [b]The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World[/b]) [b]Cat President ~A More Purrfect Union~[/b] it’s their very first title, and we can safely say they started with the right foot, or should I say, the right paw?

Players take on the life of a young woman whose life is somehow slowing drifting away… College is another long lost battle, and considering she’s not the smartest cookie, it’s no surprise, however, her dedication and perseverance make up for it. After a walk in a park with a friend, our protagonist is invited to watch a live presidential national debate. She reluctantly accepts, which will change her life forever!

Cats are running for the presidency, and the battle is fierce. Which one will you support? Listen to the selected candidates, their goals, and ideas for the continuous progression of America. Join their fight, or will you sabotage it? Either way, the election is on, and you play as the campaign manager!

As in every Visual Novel, the narrative is by far the most important detail, and just because the whole concept for [b]Cat President ~A More Purrfect Union~[/b] is as hilarious as it can, doesn’t mean there isn’t a value in its writing. Surely it’s a comedy intended game, and its own funny concept delivers the most amusing narrative you can probably find on Steam! The whole interaction between the main character with the events is just surprisingly hilarious, and the placement of circumstances is most of the times unexpected. One thing is guaranteed though, you’ll giggle all the way through this swift adventure, with quite the amount of surprises waiting for you.

There are quite the choices to be made in this journey, with interactive elements and decisions that reflect long and short term events. Interaction with each candidate displays a different set of developments, as each cat has a distinct personality, and their approach to win the election will take players through different routes.

With multiple endings, there’s also an extra romantic tie associated within the narrative, which is quite the surprise, considering the involvement of humans with cats, then again, they are running the White House, so why not go full on with this? Amusing as it may seem, the dialogue, direction is far away from being absurd, and delivers a stable line of concrete meaning within the storyline.

Would be a shame to have such an incredible concept fulfilled with nonsense, thankfully, it’s not the case. Part of what makes everything come together is how the world portrayed in the game seems already used to this, and throughout the campaign, players will face social media such as Catstergram, political polls, and other events that are well established in this new order.

Visually, the game uses real photographic imagery for both, renders and backgrounds. Most renders are cats, that is, for each of the 6 candidates. Every other character you may or may not encounter are also real actors. There aren’t many renders for candidates, even though the developer team used pictures, it’s not particularly easy to portray a cat with different facial expressions, but there’s still plenty of variations to go with. As for backgrounds, you’ll never feel bored, with dedicated scenes per each situation, which only adds to its well driven flow.

Presentation is somehow simple, with an interface that doesn’t try to be pretentious, and at the same time, does not stain the whole concept with weird text font, which we can always appreciate. It’s still simple and effective. Performance is a plus+ for this one, since it uses photographic images, the quality upscales considerably much better, meaning if you play at 1440p or 4K, the quality will be really good, and yes, I’m looking at all of you who play Visual Novels in the large Screen TV!

A fantastic well portrayed offside reality storyline, with an interesting concept filled with humour and fun characteristic moments. There are no references to the real 2016 election, and It’s entirely a fictional story. It’s also worth being mentioned, that it’s not a parody of any sorts, it’s a real, unique story of its own.

If you like Visual Novels, that have a certain level of interactivity, funny moments and unexpected narrative directions, but still some common sense in it, this is by far the best bet. With a pleasant soundtrack, plenty of cute cats and a sweet romantic outcome included.

Сюжет прост: в какой-то момент люди поняли, что все политики, дорвавшись до власти, рано или поздно становятся коррупционерами. Даже президент с самыми честными глазами, через несколько лет правления почему-то начинает строить не школы и больницы для населения, а шикарные домики для себя, и своих уточек. Также у людей-президентов плохая память, и поэтому очень быстро забываются обещания вывести экономику своей страны в пятёрку лидирующих. Вместо этого в пятёрку лидирующих отчего-то выводятся близкие друзья и соратники. Ну и так далее по списку.

В общем, люди-политики в этом плане слишком ненадёжны, и поэтому принимается решение, что политиками должны быть коты. Кот не будет брать откатов за строительство ненужного моста, да и сам мост строить не будет. Скорее всего, кот вообще ничего делать не будет, потому что у него лапки.

Собственно, мы помогаем вести президентскую компанию одному из таких котов (кота выбираем сами). Плюс в игре есть хитрoжoпая собака, которая, замаскировавшись под кота, также пытается прийти к власти. Хитрoжoпая собака, видимо, олицетворяет коммунистическую партию.

I was hoping for a little more interaction, for example a game where you choices dictate where the story goes, but sadly that is not the case. If you choose an option that the game does not like, it basically has your character say ""I can't do that"" and then selects the other option.

Your choices do, however make a difference on what ending you get. It basically boils down to if you choose enough of option 1 you get the first ending, choose enough of option 2, you will get the second ending, and if you choose a mixture of options 1 and 2, you will get the third ending.

But this game will be intersting even for those who are absolutely not into politics. I was so excited to play it being a great cat lover.

Unfortunately I can't say the same about barking sounds but even they helped to create a general nice atmosphere of the world ruled by cute animals because people became too corrupted.  I find it so adorable that the photos of real cats are used. DJ Nibbles looks especially cute for me!  Plus in every route there're amazing cat pictures on the walls. It was a real pleasure for my eyes to play through this novel!

The story is hilarious, it was so funny to read. There are so many cute cat puns. [i] I'm afraid I'm gonna use the word 'cute' a lot, but I can't think about cats without adding cute to them, sorry ;) [/i] My favorite word was catfriend. That moment when Thunderpaw was looking at cute pictures of people on the net was so amusing. 

 All candidates (love options as well) are adorable! Every route contains 10 chapters with three endings each - bad, normal and good. What I liked a lot, when you reach a good ending, the other two endings are unlocked automatically, so there's no need to replay a route again. It's the first time I come across anything like this and it's really nice! Speaking of different endings, it was astonishing for me but the most enjoyable thing in this game, although in a twisted way, was bad endings! In general, the game is light, relaxing and funny. But once you reach bad endings... They were unexpectedly painful, it really hurt, I was so impressed! 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1392579330 
Once you finish all routes, the bonus will be unlocked with more details. It was so interesting to read about devs, their original ideas of endings, titles. They used not only photos of real cats but photos of them as well. It's kinda cute! It makes you more involved when you see the people working on the game, learn some behind-the scenes information. 

Despite everything I loved in this game, I still don't know if I recommend it or not. Cats have always been a part of my life. I love them unconditionally. I remember when I first saw an otome game where pets turned into humans. I found that idea as the best possible for me. But here we romance actual cats and this is too [strike] disgusting [/strike] disturbing. Those cats were going to undergo the surgery to turn into humans but before it we still read about dates, kissing... In one ending MC even had two kittens and one baby O_o. That's too weird. 

Also, there are no options in this game. So, for example, you can't turn off music. I can't say it was bad, but sometimes I take a break without quitting a game if it's not going to be for long. I may drink a cup of tea while watching anime and then come back to playing but not in this case. :( 

And finally what I disliked most is the main character. I started playing the game with the most good-looking cat for me. That was Dr. Nom-Noms and everything was just purrfect! Then I noticed that in different routes the MC's personality varies. And I found it a great thing! But soon in some routes, practically in half of them, MC became so ditzy, so obnoxious. I was so irritated, annoyed and quite often even ashamed. For me the main character IS me, when I start reading, I dive into a story, merging with the main character. So why, WHY did you make her so dumb, devs? I was irritated so much that I actually stopped playing for a while to calm myself down. But then I thought that it's not just my personal perception. She IS stupid, it is stated by her best friend, parents and her teacher. So it means she was depicted that way intentionally. It was later proved in bonus. I sincerely don't get it! What was the appeal of creating her that silly?!:(( It influenced the whole story! 

So, cute cats and a funny story on the one hand and an irritatingly dumb MC on the other. I am not even sure which is more weighty. After some mulling I guess I'll make this review positive. Cats always win! I must miss something and there's a meaning in creating a really silly MC which I don't get, but the game could be so much better,  in my opinion!

A hilarious political farce visual novel portraying the interesting situation of America choosing to ban humans from politics due to the corruption. Do you love cats? Because that's the second best choice to humans to run the government in this world. You have six different characters to choose from which all have three different endings. 

There are several great things that you will enjoy with this visual novel. The paths are intelligently intertwined. You may find see character A drop out of the race for some reason during character B's path; but not figure out why until you play character A's path. The characters are diverse and there isn't much repeating dialogue. The start dialogue is about the only thing that will repeat and you can easily skip it. Another interesting feature I enjoyed is if you unlock the good ending, you automatically unlock the bad ending and normal ending. 

The best thing about this game is the cute characters and the hilarious dialogue. I thought it may be possible that the humor would not be as strong for someone who doesn't understand American government; but it does a pretty decent job. There are a few times where it may delve into it a bit heavier much like World End Economica does with economics; so be prepared for a little bit of political information. The politics fanfare music fits the tone of the game as well. 

About one of my only gripes with this game is that at times the choices were a bit to easy. This isn't bad, but it sets this visual novel up as really casual. At a decision you essentially have the obvious correct choice and the obvious incorrect choice; aside from choices that don't affect the route. If it does involve the path; you will hear a noise if you made the ""correct"" decision. If you didn't make the correct decision, than you can either continue on or just scroll back through the text and make the other decision.

Cat President - типичная визуальная новелла с весьма оригинальным сеттингом. Нам предстоит стать менеджером президентской компании одного из шести котиков-кандидатов. Каждый из них наделен собственным набором личностных качеств, прямо как настоящие люди. Среди качеств есть характер, цели, антураж в выступлениях перед широкой публикой и другие. По этой причине каждая из сюжетных компаний, имеющих по 3 концовки, обладает собственным колоритом и запоминается чем-то своим. 

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767034617
[b]Если другие новеллы разбавлены кисками, то в этой только кошки.[/b]

К сожалению, на интересном антураже и идейном исполнении плюсы «Котика-Президента» заканчиваются. Новелла перенасыщена англоязычным текстом, читать который спустя ~час становится просто утомительно и банально надоедает. Большого простора для выбора, кроме основной развилки, также не предоставляется, а визуальное наполнение игры выполнено исключительно статичными картинками. Нередко встречающиеся черные экраны так вовсе вгоняют в уныние. Ах да, без знания английского на хорошем уровне здесь делать вообще нечего.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=783163064
Сопровождается чтение текста тремя повторяющимися композициями. К счастью, они меняются в зависимости от ситуации, что создает небольшую динамику. Впрочем, изменить громкость звука, как и все остальные параметры игры, вам все равно не удастся. Меню настроек просто-напросто отсутствует. Привычного интерфейса из новелл вы здесь также не встретите, приходится сохраняться через меню паузы в правом углу экрана. 
Лайфхак: чтобы растянуть окно с игрой во весь экран, просто потяните за его край ;)

У игры очень много недостатков, исправлять которые никто уже не станет, а единственное её достоинство заключается в необычном сеттинге. Если бы была возможность поставить игре оценку точно между пальцами «вверх» и «вниз», я бы так и сделал.

A big part of why [i]Hatoful Boyfriend[/i] works so well is that it starts with a one-note joke, but gradually reveals a complex story structure and lore, ending with a (probably well-spoiled by now) plot twist and genre shift. [i]Cat President[/i] starts with a one-note joke and never strays far from it, so if you don't find the idea of talking cat politicians inherently funny, it'll get old really fast.

It's a visual novel with no gameplay, and the choice structure is very simple (pick a cat, make some choices along a linear plot and have a sound effect tell you if you chose correctly, then reach one of three endings based on how many correct choices you made). Your choices basically don't affect anything but the ending, so replaying involves skipping a lot of text, and the correct choice indicator should have been optional, because although it takes some of the frustration out of finding the good endings, it takes some of the fun out of it, too.

Characters and lore are inconsistent from one route to the next, which feels like an intentional decision by the writer to just go with whatever's funnier in context, so I don't think it's a bad thing. And while I understand the desire to not make the game feel too partisan or dated, the game's political satire feels vague and weak instead.

All that said, I still found [i]Cat President[/i] an amusing read with many hilarious one-liners and a fair amount of content for the price (6 routes at 1 hour each, as a fast reader). Not as good as it could have been, but if you're a visual novel fan and the premise makes you chuckle, it's certainly worth checking out on sale.

Cat President – A More Purrfect Union is a pure gem of a game; this enthralling Visual Novel puts you in the shoes of yourself, running alongside one of six complex Purresidential Candidates; Frisky, the perverted, woman-loving houn-…Uh…Feline; Thunderpaw, the Trump-inspired, racist candidate whom has a mass legion of catty, racist followers; DJ Nibbles, the innocent, pure candidate that has ambitions for Purresidency; Dr Nom Noms, a candidate that never intended to become a candidate; Kale, the beaten dark…Uh…Cat candidate (I can’t really use dark horse here can I?); and, finally, Rover, a purebreed cat that simply wants equality for all and is totally not hiding some sort of secret at all, no, not at all. Pinky promise. Swear on my life.

After witnessing a rather heated debate between the six candidates, you get hired by whichever one you choose, and follow them in their journey into Purresidency…On your way you’ll experience love…Betrayal…Racism…Sabotage…And much, much more.

Let me say this right off the bat, and address the elephant in the room; yes, yes you can romance each and every one of the candidates. Yes, it’s odd, and yes, it’s bizarre, but hey – It just enhances the feel of the game; the game throws you into a world of witty dialogue, well-crafted plot threads and interesting characters; and I’m not even being sarcastic there! The game legitimately has some amazing characters, and despite the ridiculous plot and dimwitted main character, I was on the edge of my seat at each revelation.

Each campaign will set you back around 90 minutes each to finish the 10 Chapters in each candidate’s campaign, meaning you’ll get around 540 minutes, or 9 hours of gameplay, if you get the best endings on your first attempt. The dialogue alone makes up for the time invested, especially if you’re voicing each of the characters with friends, just go in open minded and have fun!

For my playthrough, I followed Rover’s campaign, and, whilst I won’t disclose spoilers in this review, I was shocked at some twists and turns when the cat was let out the bag; the main reveal of the story left me barking mad, especially since I hadn’t even had a single bone thrown my way – The way that certain characters and candidates pussiefoot around certain situations truly left an impact on me.

For me, Cat President is just a whole lot of dumb fun; the game isn’t visually pleasing, nor is it technical in any leaps or bounds, but my god do I love it – This game is definitely one to keep out of the litter box, and should be set atop the scratching posts of fame for just how much fun you can have with it after a few drinks with some purrfect company.

I would rate Cat President a 7/10.

This game was pretty fun and I enjoyed it a lot. I only played one route so far, I got Kale's good route, but I do plan on going back and trying the other routes. Not sure if this was worth the current cost though ($8.09 on a sale, but full price is $8.99). The reason I feel this is because this was made using Ren'Py.

Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the engine or game dev in general, Ren'Py is a really nice Python engine for making visual novel games. Most visual novels you've probably tried or will try are written in this. The reason for this being it has all the features of regular visual novels already built in. It's free, you can download it yourself and play around with it, but the main thing with it is it makes visual novel making so much easier that all the programming is pretty much done. All you really need to focus on is the writing, art, and sound, because Ren'Py is set so that you just have to assign the assets to variables and then use them in a kind of movie script.

There's nothing wrong at all with using this engine, it's really ncie and convinient, but the problem is the assets using for the game. Most of them are free assets found online. So really when you pay for the game you're really paying for the script writing.

Again, this isn't me saying this game is bad at all, and I can more than understand why a game dev would feel their game deserves to be priced the way it is. I don't know how much money was actually spent behind the scenes on this game, so maybe I'm wrong about some things. But to me, it definitely feels the price is a bit too high.

Some have compared this game to Hatoful Boyfriend, and I can definitely agree on the resemblance since it's a funny concept visual novel and the birds in that seem like free or cheap assets as well, but that game has lots of assets that were made by the devs as well. In fact the birds even have human personas drawn by the devs. Meanwhile, this game doesn't seem to have any assets that are the actual dev's own creation. In the credits of this game, almost all images are attributed to Flickr.

But again, I have no problem paying for writing and a fun experience. I don't regret this purchase at all, in fact I'm going to be playing it more for all the routes. I just don't think the current price is fair is all. Despite this, I don't feel this game was a rip off like others think. I think any dev has the right to charge whatever they want for their game and that if any buyer doesn't like what they got, just refund it. It's the dev's job to make the player not want to refund it, but also too many people buy visual novels these days and are disappointed when they find out it's not exactly a ""game"" game. That's not the dev's fault.

ALSO one last thing, why isn't there an options menu? I want to adjust music volumes but there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. I know Ren'Py has a built in settings option, so why disable it?

In conclusion, this game was fun and I hope you give it a chance, but if you don't agree with the price I understand. VOTE FOR KALE!",1472240398,1472240502,True,12,0,0.622731983661651611,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm an avid fan of visual novels, dating sims, and cats, so I was imediately interested in Cat President. The concept of the game reminded me of hatoful boyfriend, another visual novel in which you date birds instead of people. So this was like that, but with cats instead of birds. 

I just completed Frisky's Route and got the Normal Ending. The route probably took close to 2 hours to complete, so given that there are 6 dateable guys, err cats... and a dog... lol, this game will take about 12-15 hours for most people to complete. I think there are ""better"" endings than the one I got, so I will have to replay Frisky's route again sometime, as well as spend time playing the other routes in the game.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing in this game. I wasn't really expecting much, to be honest, but the characters are strangely relateable in an odd way. They have human qualities, human flaws, that not only can one see in our political candidates right now, but also probably in their friends and romantic partners. 

The game is light hearted and silly, but it still has some deep or insightful moments as well as moments of drama and intrigue. While it didn't move me to cry, it did move me to laughter many times, and it held my attention long enough to complete the route in one sitting.

My only real critique or complaint was against the art. If this had hand drawn, more anime-ified artwork, I think it would appeal more to its target audience, which is women like me who love visual novels. Too bad they couldn't have funded some cute anime kitty artwork for the game, but the ""stock photos"" are not bad. Cats, especially real life ones, are cute! But they needed more poses/expressions for each of the characters, to help show their emotions more! Also one of the candidates is supposed to be a kitten, but they used a stock photo of a full grown cat? It would've been cute to have a kitten candidate lol.",1472171513,1472171513,True,6,0,0.580451309680938721,0,False,True,False,False,,,

-Rover has my vote.
-So much of this game is text-- I really wish it properly animated the dialogue. You know-- reveal the sentences character by character.
-With multiple characters on screen, it can be challenging to tell who’s talking. I wish they would highlight as they talk. When one cat says “That over there is thunderpaw”, I have no idea which of the other two cats he’s talking about,
-Some sound effects during speech would be nice. For example, have a “meow” occur with new lines. As it is, there is no audio indication that someone is talking. I like how the Shantae / Zelda series handle this-- you often get a tiny voice clip when a conversation starts, such that you know you’re talking with someone, and know what their voice sounds like.
-Starting the game, I assumed I was a cat, named myself “PussyPants”, then found out I was a human two scenes later. Gotta make that more clear from the get-go.
-Kale and the Dr (the two cats in the hallway) look similar. It’s practically a guarantee they will be confused with one another.
-Seeing as Lizzy’s a human actor, and is probably more receptive to pose suggestions than cats would be, it would have been nice to get different stills from her. As it is, she has this odd “stare-longingly-into-your-soul” still, which feels out of place in a few scenes.
-A shame you don’t get to actually listen to the candidate’s responses in the initial debate. As we’ve seen from this IRL presidential election cycle, it can be tremendously entertaining.
-Moving quickly through the dialogue, I would often get to a set of question responses, only to have forgotten what the question was. Please keep the question at the bottom of the screen.

I decided to go DJ Nibbles' route and got the good ending.
There were several times where I was caught off guard and spit out my drink laughing (not going to spoil them, but I'll say they involved a strange man with a flag tattoo and a podium)

I also recommend playing with friends so you can give each of the characters different voices- this would be really fun for a letsplay video.
The only thing I feel a little let down by is the lack of achievements- which would be perfect for this game :/
