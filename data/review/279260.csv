My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705244961,1705244961,True,1,1,0.464547693729400635,0,True,False,False,True,,,

La trama è piuttosto classica con quasi nulla di originale, molto alla ""The Road"". L'impressione che ho avuto è che il tutto fosse nato come racconto breve, e intendo proprio ""da leggere"", e che gli sviluppatori non siano stati in grado di tradurlo in modo convincente nel medium del videogioco. Gran parte della partita, infatti, riguarda dialoghi, dialoghi e ancora dialoghi. C'è solo un capitolo in cui il livello di interazione aumento un po' e o fa nel modo peggiore, con enigmi creati ad arte per far perdere tempo al giocatore, mettendo oggetti e enigmi da un capo all'altro della mappa, percorrendo lunghe distanze senza possibilità di correre o skippare o impedendo l'uso di oggetti finchè non diventa necessario.. Infine i dev hanno voluto inserire la possibilità di avere finali multipli ma anche qui in modo maldestro. Essenzialmente il tutto si basa su due o tre oggetti da raccogliere/utilizzare, quindi alcuni finali richiedono di ignorare deliberatamente certi oggetti; ma in ambiente di gioco così povero è praticamente impossibile che il giocatore non veda un oggetto e non lo raccolga, e ancora più strano sarebbe che non lo raccolga volontariamente. Tra l'altro anche i meccanismi che portano la protagonista Alice (Richard anche, se giocabile, di fatto è solo un comprimario) a scegliere alla fine un percorso piuttosto che un altro sono abbastanza oscuri e il collegamento con gli oggetti chiave di cui sopra non viene esplicitato in alcun modo. 
Quindi io non lo consiglio molto, anche se spesso lo si trova in saldo a 1 euro, quindi se magari decidete di offrire ai dev un caffè....",1703798716,1703798716,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[b]Richard & Alice[/b] is a story-focused point and click adventure set in the post-apocalyptic world.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Emotional story
+ Puzzles are simple and logical
+ Original post-apocalyptic setting

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Slow walking speed
- In-game notes are too hard to read
- Technical issues

[h1]Story[/h1] 
The plot takes place in a world destroyed by the sudden coming of a new Ice Age. As the world became colder, people have become colder towards each other as well and the society has spiraled down into chaos. The game follows two characters, [b]Richard[/b], an ex-military guy serving a sentence in an underground prison. And [b]Alice[/b] a new prisoner and a loving mother, who was sent in for murder. Who’s murder, you ask? This is one of the mysteries that the game tries to create for you. During the game, you will alternate between controlling [b]Richard[/b] in the present and [b]Alice[/b] in her flashbacks and eventually learn how story pieces relate to each other. Despite some predictable twists, it’s a solid story that could make your eyes wet at times. There are multiple endings that depend on very minor choices. Some of them feel more fitting than others, so your experience may vary depending on the ending you get. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It’s the usual point and click gameplay. You collect items and apply them to solve simple puzzles. They seem logical for the most part, and it doesn’t feel like you can get stuck on any of them. Your inventory is pretty small and there aren’t that many interactive spots. So even if you do get stuck, it’s easy to try out every possible combination. There’s one controversial thing about the gameplay though. The story has multiple endings that depend on some of the minor decisions you make while solving puzzles or talking to characters. It only changes the last bit of the story, but you have to replay almost the entire game to see it. It wouldn’t have been a big problem if the game had allowed you to skip cutscenes and make the character walk faster when double clicking on the ground, like many other games do. Yet, there’s nothing like that, so unlocking multiple endings is a chore.

[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]
Visually, the game’s pretty bleak and looks like something made in an RPG maker. Though at times it works well to enhance the atmosphere of a cold dying world covered in snow. Sound effects and ambient music also add up nicely to that feeling. Sadly, there’s no voice acting.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Specs: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB, 32GB RAM.

Couldn’t get Steam to measure the FPS, but it seems to be around 30 judging by the laggy mouse movement. There aren’t much graphical settings apart from the resolution. You need to edit game files to get the fullscreen mode working. As for the technical problems, I got stuck two times after a dialogue, when the character just stopped reacting to clicks. Reloading the autosave fixed the problem.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Richard & Alice[/b] is a short story-focused game that will certainly have an emotional impact on you. However, if you do try to unlock multiple endings and collect all achievements, you will definitely get bored with it.",1673777987,1673777987,True,3,0,0.582590043544769287,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Главный герой Ричард просыпается в каком-то запертом помещении, похожем на номер в гостинице, с компьютером, телевизором, кроватью и уборной. Почти сразу же он знакомится с девушкой по имени Алиса в комнате напротив. Отсюда начинается наша история.

История вполне хорошая, раз в своё время решился на перевод ) Почему-то раньше не порекомендовал.

Big plus that you can save at any time, apart from the game autosaving in regular intervals. Also the atmosphere and background music are good and effective.

You won't have any real problems solving the puzzles in order to progress, as they're quite simple and logical. Maybe apart from where [spoiler]you have to use the crowbar on the statue of Mary. Going from trying to open the trapdoor with the crowbar to smashing the statue with the crowbar didn't seem that obvious at the time, but this may just be me.[/spoiler]

There is definitely replay value in order to get all the endings and achievements, BUT there's a pretty big con about this: You can't skip the dialogue, plus you gotta know when to save for you not to have to go through whole sequences again.

Entre los pocos elementos y que los puzzles son sencillos la dificultad no es elevada.
El juego ofrece varios finales pero luego de haber obtenido el primero y ver en que consistían los otros no me motivó ni de cerca para intentar jugarlo otra vez solo para ver las otras alternativas. No hay formas de saltar escenas ni salir rápido de las pantallas lo cual sumado a que los personajes no se mueven muy rápida explica mi decisión.
Desde el punto de vista gráfico lo que más chocó fue la decisión de diseño de los personajes: se ven super raros y por momentos no parecen estar en proporción con los escenarios.

[code] [b] Richard & Alice [/b] - интерактивная история с элементами point and click от рарзаботчика Owl Cave, изданная им же. Игра вышла в Steam в июне 2014 года и на данный момент имеет чуть менее 400 отзывов, по совокупности дающих ""в основном положительный"" рейтинг. Какие неожиданности ожидают нас на этот раз - разбираемся ниже.[/code]

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СЮЖЕТ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

На секунду закроем глаза и представим себе идиллическую картину: Вы - еще ребенок, рядом с Вами - любящий Вас отец. Вместе вы смотрите из окна на падающий на улице снег. После жарких летних дней и слякотной осени - явление долгожданное, особенно если вы все еще верите в Деда Мороза и ждете елку с подарками. 

И все бы хорошо, да вот только снег продолжает падать, а температура - неуклонно лететь вниз. День за днем, неделя за неделей, месяц - за месяцем. И вот уже не успеваешь оглянуться - год прошел, за ним другой, а погода не становится лучше. Лютая стужа все глубже забирается в города и жилища, меняя не только климат, но и самих людей, которые вынуждены в нём выживать. Былая организация общества потихоньку сходит на нет, уступая место инстинкту самосохранения и вопросам выживания. 

Готовы ли Вы убить невинных, зная, что это спасет жизнь близкому Вам человеку? Сможете ли своими руками оборвать жизнь родной крови, если все иные варианты будут выглядеть еще хуже? Чем Вы готовы пожертвовать во имя благой для Вас цели? Именно эти вопросы будет непрерывно ставить перед Вами сюжет, и именно на них Вам предстоит искать ответ до конца прохождения. 

Повествование будет вестись от лица двух главных героев - Ричарда и Элис. От лица мужчины история будет происходить в настоящем для главных героев времени, где оба они окажутся в замкнутом пространстве. Со стороны Элис мы получим возможность узнать о прошлом, и раскрыть некоторые тайны будущего. Как двое незнакомых людей оказались по разные стороны тюремных камер, и какая судьба ждет незадачливых узников - об этом лучше без спойлеров узнать в ходе прохождения. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Richard & Alice представляет собой интерактивую историю с элементами point and click. Большая частью игры проходит в различных диалогах и кат-сценах, где персонажи ведут различные беседы, из которых мы будем складывать полноценную картину произошедших событий. Дабы игроки совсем уж не заскучали, периодически нас будут тормошить, поручая выполнить какую-нибудь задачу, подразумевающую нахождение определенного предмета или выполнение каких-либо действий с содержимым инвентаря. 

Игра попеременно будет кидать нас в два разных временных отрезка (условное прошлое и настоящее), где от (третьего) лица двух разных ГГ мы будем исследовать мир, решать несложные задачи и продвигаться дальше по сюжетной линии. Стоит отметить, что в Richard & Alice предусмотрено несколько концовок, поэтому свои действия, особенно в финале, стоит продумывать заранее. 

Графически игра выглядит достаточно простовато, однако вкупе с правильным звуковым сопровождением и драматично-глубоким сюжетом это не так сильно бросается в глаза. В наличии имеется набор достижений Steam, однако русский язык по-умолчанию не предусмотрен, и это один из тех случаев, когда без хорошего знания заморской мовы делать в игре нечего. Поэтому, если собираетесь ознакомиться, либо найдите русификатор, либо готовьтесь сидеть со словарем, ибо основной шарм Richard & Alice именно в понимании происходящего вокруг. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ПЛЮСЫ И МИНУСЫ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

+ Глубокий драматичный сюжет
+ Простенькая, но чем-то даже симпатичная графика
+ Хорошее звуковое сопровождение
+ Достижения Steam 
+ Головоломки для разнообразия геймплея 
+ Низкий ценник 
+ Частые скидки 

- Задания местами бывают весьма витиеватые 
- Нет русского языка (а без него будет тяжеловато) 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Время полного прохождения - чуть более 5 часов игрового времени. По итогу, могу сказать, что Richard & Alice в первую очередь подойдет скорее даже не любителям квестов, а именно тем, кто больше по части визуальных новелл. В игре очень много диалогов и побочного текста, с которым интересно знакомиться, если Вам нравится нечто подобное. В то же время, сюжет, за исключением пары диалогов между ГГ в тюрьме, довольно безрадостный и трагичный, поэтому, если ищете что-то веселое и доброе - смело проходите мимо. Если же вы готовы окунуться в омут безнадеги и чувствуете в себе силы пройти его до конца - игра Вам наверняка понравится. Но решать уже Вам самим.

The puzzles are okay, but I think the strength of the game is way more in the story than the gameplay. For a single playthrough, it's good, maybe really good.

However, I'm someone that prefers to get all achievements, which meant multiple playthroughs in this case. Even during the initial playthrough, there were times the game felt very slow. The characters even walked slow. There's pauses to let you take in the feeling of the scene that sometimes go on too long. When trying to get the rest of the achievements [spoiler]Which really was mostly just other endings.[/spoiler]
it became unbearably slow. I had to take a long break because I got too frustrated with the pacing. 

After finding everything, I wouldn't say it was really worth it either. If you wanna get everything, you start to just learn the same information over and over and over again. This is especially true since you don't really have to do anything special to learn the whole story, because in the end you're pretty much told the truth anyway.
[spoiler]When it comes to other endings, I think it's best to have each ending give you a bit more information. That's not really apparent here. Chances are you'll get the ""true"" or ""best"" ending fairly quickly if not first, and by then, you already know everything. Each other ending is essentially a different people dying or leaving, except of course for the one ending where Richard and Alice stay together, the Polar Bear Territory. Everything else, as far as I could tell, was essentially the exact same every time.[/spoiler]

„Richard & Alice“ ist ein minimalistisches Point & Click-Adventure, wobei es wenig zu Clicken und viel zu Lesen gibt.
Ein anderer Reviewer beschrieb es treffend als „Dialog-Spiel“.
Das Game fühlt sich eher an wie ein Buch mit Animations-Einlagen.

In der Beschreibung steht zwar, dass es um zwei Gefängnisinsassen geht, doch eigentlich handelt man  hauptsächlich als Alice vor ihrer Inhaftierung und ihrem 5-jährigen Sohn.

Denn vor dem Knast geht es in Rückblenden um den Überlebenskampf einer Mutter und ihrem Kind in einer post-apocalyptischen Welt.
Das Abenteuer ist stark, die Dialoge zwischen Mutter und Kind ergreifend. 

Im Gefängnis wiederum handelt man als Richard, der sich mit Alice unterhält.

Und jetzt kommt die Ernüchterung: 
Die Handlungsmöglichkeiten in dem Spiel sind stark eingeschränkt. 
Es gibt wenig Schauplätze, kaum Interaktion mit der Umgebung, so gut wie nichts zu tun.
Die Erzählung läuft über die Dialoge, Notizen die man findet – und der Vorstellungskraft des Spieler.

Die Grafik ist selbst für einen Pixel-Lock dürftig, die Umgebung statisch und detailarm, der Sound zwar gut, aber der ganze Spielablauf, gerade was die Gefängnis-Sequenzen angeht, zäh, kein bis fordernd und die Handlung uninspiriert und unglaubwürdig. 
Es gibt keine Möglichkeiten andere Dialogoptionen auszuwählen, um einen neuen Dialog-Baum zu eröffnen.
Man liest sich Textzeile für Zeile durch.
Das Spiel ist nicht linear, es ist starr.

Als besonderes Manko empfand ich nicht die oft kritisierten Laufwege – die sind winzig – das ganze Spiel ist winzig.
Es sind die Enden. Es gibt fünf, sehr unterschiedliche - zum Teil drastische Ende.
Verschiedene Enden suggerieren Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten. Doch man kann sich nicht für oder gegen etwas entscheiden, sondern das Spiel macht es davon abhängig, was man liest oder aufhebt. 

Jetzt ist es ja gerade bei einem Point & Click-Adventure-Game so, dass man interessiert ist die Umgebung zu erforschen und wirklich alles anzuklicken und zu untersuchen.
Hat man dies bei „Richard & Alice“ gemacht, gibt es dafür ein spezielles Ende.

Nur wenn man etwas bewusst nicht macht oder übersieht, wie zum Beispiel eine Notiz NICHT zu lesen gibt es andere Enden – aber wer spielt denn so (?!) 
Um es klarzustellen. Ich habe alle Enden (dank eines Guides) erwirkt, die Art und Weise wie man diese erlangt, widerspricht nicht nur der Gamer-Logik sondern ist auch der Genre-typischen Spielweise.

Ich finde die Geschichte von Alice und ihrem Kind spannend. 
Den Rest kann man sich schenken.

Richard & Alice is a very dialogue heavy game, at points feeling more like a Visual Novel than a Point & Click with how much reading you're doing. I don't particularly mind this, but I feel like it's something you should know going into the game and not something you find out while playing it.

For all of the reading there is, it was very well proof-read. I don't remember any spelling or grammar errors outside of the intentional dialogue from a five year old and maybe a few instances of strange wordage (""It will make do"", weird, but not unintelligible).

The sprites are rather ugly and the animations aren't very nice either, but the character portraits are well done and the environments are passable. This isn't a game to play for it's graphics by any means.

But I have to say that the story does make up for it. Telling the majority of the story through flashbacks is interesting and the story itself is compelling enough to make you want to finish it. Depending on which ending you get it does feel like it wraps up well.

I only had a couple of issues with the game:

1. I couldn't figure out how to take screenshots. No matter how I rebound the key all it did was advance dialogue or absolutely nothing.

2. The maps are pretty open and you walk very slowly, so unless you follow a guide you're going to spend a while wandering.

3. The requirements for the different endings are so insignificant. Like: pick up this box or don't, read this note or don't, give your son a toy car or don't. To me, it didn't really make sense that these tiny changes would change the ending the way that they did, let alone the fact that ONLY the very ending changes, so you're replaying the exact same stuff over and over again until the last five minutes. A guide is pretty much essential in getting them all, and it gets pretty boring pretty fast.

This low-budget point and click title manages to convey this desolate world well, whilst developing characters that players can connect with on an emotional level. 
To be completely clear, Richard & Alice is not a happy, feel-good game, it is quite the opposite. It exposes the harsh reality of simply surviving in a dying world and making decisions that can mean life or death. 

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Emotional story with interesting dialogue.
+ Multiple endings.
+ Achievements and trading cards.
+ Simple but enjoyable puzzles/item combinations.
+  Portrays the reality of life in a world struggling to survive.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Can't change screen resolution to enable fullscreen.
- No option for text over in-game notes, sometimes I found them a bit difficult to read.
- Replaying to achieve slightly different endings can become tiresome due to the inability to skip scenes.

[h1]Story (spoiler free)[/h1]
Players begin as a man named Richard in what seems like a luxury prison cell. He has access to a radio, TV (albeit with limited channels), own shower and more. The world outside is a disaster and snow is a constant occurrence, preventing people from going outside and this extreme weather is the reason for the collapse of society. The 'prison' is actually in a testing phase to be a safety bunker for the rich. A means of survival for those who can afford it, but in the meantime, criminals get to be the guineapigs.

With outdoors being so dangerous, the inside of the cell doesn't seem so bad to Richard, at least he is safe. The only thing really missing is human companionship, and along comes Alice. The two, although in opposite cells, strike up a friendship and Alice slowly shares her story about life before being incarcerated. Each day the two form a closer bond, unaware of the secrets each other are hiding.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Richard & Alice is primarily about sharing the characters stories and thus is quite dialogue heavy, however there are still plenty of sections where players must explore the pixel world and find/combine objects. Most of the gameplay takes place during Alice's stories about the past and players get to experience this first-hand, however we also get to take control of Richard and explore his cell. 
Players get to explore the snow-covered landscape and learn about Alice and her 5-year-old son, Barney and their plight for survival. Majority of this time is spent searching the area for useful items and combining them where appropriate. There are some different methods of proceeding past specific areas, and the methods chosen can influence the ending. The navigation and item combination is very simple and only utilises the mouse, simply clicking on one object and then another will combine it, or right clicking on an object to get a description of it from the character. 

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Being a low-budget Indie game that was chosen through Steam's greenlight program, it comes as no surprise that the graphics are simply just mediocre. Richard & Alice is set in a pixel world and the graphics are not noteworthy by any means. At times it can be a bit of a struggle to notice and select certain items as they blend into the pixilated background very easily. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]
There are no voice-overs or any soundtracks, so there is nothing to comment on here. 

[h1] Conclusion: Is it worth it?[/h1]
For avid story lovers, this game is well-worth it. The dialogue is nicely done and emotional when it needs to be, I found myself feeling empathetic towards the characters as the game neared its end. Despite the bleak reality that Richard & Alice portrays, I was drawn into the game and its mysterious characters. It all comes together nicely in the end and at 3 hours long, its grim story does not overstay its welcome. However,  replaying to achieve the different endings can be tiresome to start over from scratch as there is no option to skip scenes. All in all, this would be a great addition to anyone looking for a good story and at only $AU8.50, it is priced fairly and is sure to keep you entertained for a dreary afternoon.

I'd like to talk first about what the game does right. The low-budget production doesn't bother me in the slightest. I think the sprites are actually quite lovely, apart from the trees. The sound design and music are both good.

I love the setting. I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic stories and games, especially those with a particular focus around day-to-day survival. This story is [i]bleak[/i], which I enjoyed, and I definitely got the sense that the weather was a constant threat (although this is undermined through gameplay: characters often wander around outside quite a bit, seemingly with no consequences).

It is an unfortunate truth of low-budget narrative games that they live or die solely on the strength of their writing. Sadly, [i]Richard & Alice[/i] does not make it.

While the game does give me a sense of the world and these characters' place in it, I think the story becomes muddled by the addition of too many characters and subplots. I'm left with more questions than answers -- and these questions reveal some cracks in the narrative rather than provide food for thought. For example: [spoiler]who ""arrests"" Alice? I got the impression that there was no functional government left. Who breaks into the bunker and kills everyone?[/spoiler] It's all confusing, and that's distracting from what could otherwise have become a pretty good character study.

The dialogue is ... not great. Conversation between Richard and Alice seems all right, but Barney's dialogue in particular is pretty bad. He talks and acts more like a toddler than a kindergartner. It's hard for me to view him as a sympathetic character. [spoiler]I personally can't feel anything but relief when Barney finally dies. Despite that, I do feel truly moved by Alice's grief.[/spoiler]

Lastly, a few notes on gameplay:

I like the simple inventory management and the unambiguous way to interact with things using the mouse. I wish there was an option to change the resolution, though.

I disliked the way that multiple endings were achieved. I don't think forcing the player to sit through the same parts of the game over and over again to get moderately different endings is really a worthwhile use of the player's time. Perhaps a ""skip scene"" function would have helped that.

Overall, I think [i]Richard & Alice[/i] has a lot of potential. Like I said, I enjoyed the setting quite a bit, as well as the tone, but the story is too muddled and the dialogue just not up to snuff.",1566358219,1566358417,False,6,0,0.59906381368637085,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Richard & Alice
- Charnel house trilogy

As far as gameplay goes, they are pretty worthless. You get exactly what you expect to get.
They are point and click games with not much reason for the pointing and a whole lot of clicking.

However, both these titles were never made to be highly interactive games. They are stories, they have words.. so much words.
And they do very well at using those words propperly!

Richard & Alice is a story about an apocalyptic after-earth were two seemingly random strangers end up with each others companionship. The overall story is experienced by Richards perspective but told by Alice.

It must be said, R&A is their first attempt and it's clear to see. It's plotdevelopment and ""bombshell"" is something you already know on the second line of Alices storytelling. This however never degrades the flow of it all !

As the story unfolds we as the player have to perform some tasks and actions that support said story and can achieve 5 different endings ( these are split up by a few decissions along the way )

Are there bad points to this game... well ofcourse there are, perfection is non-existing after all.

- The game is set in a snowy landscape and often you will reside within snow ( which is white )
The story is written in ""white"" text with a ""black outline""..... White on White does not work very well.
( The interiors have a black background and are fine as a result, but the outdoors is just... a headache )

- Resolution! This game is a small windowed game ( it has a fullscreen option though ), as a result it's stock resolution is ""600x400"" ( now i'm not sure about anyone else, but my screen can't even go there with it's  native )
It feels a bit off but isn't exactly world ending either.

- Puzzles ( read "" find item to use with other item ) are set in specific way ( it's just how these things are done in gneeral ) which will a cuople of times have you end up with a "" what do you want from me game, this makes sense but you want something else ? What do you want ?! ""

There isn't to much in here, so there can't be that much wrong with it. White on White would be my main issue here.

And yet all that can be forgiven, because OWL CAVE knows ( knew, not sure if they are still active ) how to ""write a propper story"", which is all this little gem ever needed!

° As a sidenote : I played this one after playing ""Charnel House""
""Charnel"" has voice acting, this one doesn't.... it is a silent game that reads like a book. Voice acting would have added much more value to this ( because they CAN cast decent people for it, i'm looking at you ""Peter Willington"" <-- give this man a decent recording setup to work with ).


[h1]Overall :[/h1]

If you ever find yourself with a couple of hours of dead time OR you need a small break form yet another ""open world game"" or ""BR""...
THEN GIVE THIS GAME A SHOT !! ( hell, buy the bundle with charnell in it while you are at it ^^ )

I used a walkthrough only once - not because I wouldn't have been able to figure it out by myself eventually, but because I got annoyed with the slow walking speed and didn't feel like wasting any more time walking around this big map while being unsure which pixel to click on.

When it comes to the ending, I feel like I mostly understand what happened with all the people involved ([spoiler]Caleb and Jake and the whole gang situation[/spoiler]), but it all could've been written down more clearly. 
The dialogue could have used a better editor in general anyway.

The story is alright. I was curious to see what would happen with Alice and Barney in the past, but I never really connected with any of the characters. Richard especially, even though his name is in the title, felt a little flat to me.

I finished the story once, and I'm not sure if I care enough to want to see the other three endings - even though I'm usually a completionist when it comes to short/RPG Maker games like these.

简单来说，这是流程非常短的又一款小品。
我的游戏时间看起来比较长主要是因为...看到好友评测说没法存档，所以晚上睡觉没敢关游戏。
但其实可以存的！！！
全成就时间大约六七个小时以内，而且能达到这个时长，可以说做多结局的时候不便利的操作是罪魁祸首之一。
做第一个结局（也就是初通）的时候，隐隐觉得有操作比较生硬，对话无法跳过，没有奔跑（或者是我没发现），移动比较笨拙等等小缺陷。
一开始有剧情和氛围衬托着，入戏的玩家还不会觉得这是什么硬伤，但当你要做多结局时，这些操作就比较致命了...
最重要的是；
多周目；
好像；
除了结局不同；
其他的地方；
并没有什么变化。

某些优秀作品会在玩家进行多周目操作时给出一些小小的捏他，但在这款游戏中，我是几乎没有感受到这样的捏他（其实不是几乎，而是完全没有感受到，但以防其实有捏他但我粗心大意没注意的情况，我姑且说是几乎没有感受到）。
这就使得多周目；
非常；
非常；
非常；
乏味。
对玩家来说是乏味；
对作者来说，就是无法很好地表现出自己想展现给玩家的东西。

为什么我要提到作者？
因为这是我仍然给出好评的原因。
我能感受到作者的心意，也能感受到制作组想讲的故事。
只是表达方式上尚有很多可以改进之处罢了。
也许只在结局有改变，是制作组想表达 ‘有时我们做出的改变过于微小，不到最后你发现不了’；
也许行动笨拙是因为极端的风雪天气人物本来就不能快速前行；
也许冗长的对白与停顿是为了渲染末日里的绝望与沉重，是为了让玩家入戏；
但从游戏体验而言，制作组做得不够好。
固然有缺陷，但并不是出于敷衍。

所以我给推荐。
就算有这一大堆硬伤与不便，我也从中获取过短暂的共鸣与感动。

- The dialogues were mediocre and not as meaningful/atmospheric as they could be

- Some puzzles are very random and unsolvable (yeah looking at you [spoiler] ""Building a bomb""[/spoiler]!!) but a quick glimpse into a guide solves the problem

- The endings are not bad, but dissatisfying... a bit abrupt too. Which ending you get doesnt depend on your choices or dialogues, but on whether you got all the collectibles or not. :/
- Almost no choices

The game is relatively short, and I was quite impressed by the cinematic feel created by mere pixel art and 16-bit audio. I didn't mind the shortness of the game (about 4 hours), nor did I mind the fact that the story mostly focuses on Alice. It was important to focus on her story in order to orchestrate the plot twist towards the end. I could forgive the ""cheapness"" of said plot twist due to the fact that the game left some clues leading up to the ending.

I was also fine with the ""slow walking animation"" that other reviewers complained about. It seemed pretty normal speed to me by point-and-click game standards.

What I didn't like was the fact that a couple of puzzles seemed really random with the solution. There were two specific instances in which I had to cheat and consult gamefaqs. **WARNING: SPOILERS** I'm talking about the [spoiler] thawing ice in a trash can [/spoiler] and [spoiler] making a bomb [/spoiler] puzzles. In my opinion, both of them needed something to push the player in the right direction, whether it was written in a note, a newspaper article, or Alice's thoughts. The first solution seemed physically impossible, given the tool you had to use. And for the second one, do I look like an engineer or a handyman? I can barely hang a picture frame up on a wall. There is no way I would have known the solution on my own.

Lastly, I was surprised to find out that there were 5 different endings - the game seems to present puzzle and storyline progression linearly, so I think it is the conversation options that weigh heavily on the outcome of the ending cutscene. Still, it was very unclear that choosing which lines to say may lead to a drastically different ending.

Dialogue heavy games are always risky to me, as their is a 50/50 chance of them having a lot of boring/badly written dialogue, which would destroy the game or the dialogue is well written and makes the characters seem alive.

Richard and Alice is one of the latter kind. While sometimes I felt like the actual gameplay elements were a little on the short side, I never felt like the dialogue was too much, as it did a great job of conveying the mood and making the characters seem fairly true to life.

Sadly the dialogue does not influence the different endings much, making some of the choices feel useless, but other than that it was still worth playing through multiple times and seeing all possible outcomes and in the end, to me, that's what makes narrative driven games, like this one, good ones.

Диалоги, которые, на первый взгляд, важные, не оказывают никакого влияния, а чисто символические действия могут иметь решающее значение.
Текст в игре действительно очень хороший, очень качественный, история отлично прописана и вполне достойна быть опубликованной как отдельная повесть.

Она могла бы пристрелить старика, забрать лекарства и спасти сыну жизнь. Второй вариант - она могла бы попросить помощи белых медведей. Тоже риск, но тоже есть шанс спасти сыну жизнь.

Le hic est que le format du type jeux RPG-Maker blablateux et passif flingue complètement le rythme de l'histoire.

[i]Richard & Alice[/i] takes place in the possibly near future where an ice-age apocalypse has descended on the world, causing gangs and chaos to run rampant. The game progresses via dialogue from two people who meet in nearby cells in a futuristic prison. It's not a difficult game, by any means, but the story and themes are what makes this game worth a playthrough.

The game certainly has it's darker spots, as one would expect from any post-apocalyptic narrative, and that is where the game shines. Some of those moments are in your face, some are more subtly revealed through notes and gruesome in-game discoveries.

In A Nutshell: 

Pros: 

-Strong, interesting storyline from two perspectives.
-Great Apocalyptic Theme!
-Macabre undertones and adult language.
-Multiple Endings (Though some debate over how to trigger each!)
-Fairly Cut-&-Dry steps and puzzle solutions.
-Steam Achievements and Trading Cards! 

Cons: 

-A bit too much back-and-forth travel towards the end.
-Some puzzles have fairly obscure solutions.
-No way to Stop an action after clicking (such as going through a door by mistake).
-Basic sounds and effects, and dated graphics (though Retro-licious!)

Full Review: 
 
 As a fan of Point-&-Click style games, not to mention a post-apocalypse theme, I was really excited to get my hands on Richard & Alice. I found the story to be intriguing, with just enough darkness and sadness to be appropriate for the setting, and some “adult language” thrown in for good measure. While it felt like most of the plot revolved around Alice’s half of the backstory, and the fate of her child, the developers definitely tied in both Richard and Alice’s history nicely in the end. I love that there’s multiple endings, though there’s some pretty heated debates over how to trigger them -- fortunately, there’s a few Steam Guides available if you need some help. I had the “Parting Ways” for my play-through, which I found to be appropriate and fairly satisfying, though it did feel like more of a cliffhanger than most of the other ending possibilities. 

 All in all, Richard & Alice is a worthy addition to any Point-&-Click library, especially if you like the added bonuses of Steam Achievements and trading cards! The story is a little gloomy at times, and the puzzles – and tedious walking back and forth towards the end – slowed down the momentum at times, but in the end it definitely receives my recommendation.

So why didn't I like Richard & Alice? A few reasons. The gameplay isn't very fun, and as a point-and-clicker, there are far better examples.

There's simply far too little stuffing here for one to take the game seriously, so Richard & Alice ends up just being dark for darkness' sake, without the character development or back story required to really make anyone care about what's happening to the folks as the story unfolds.

It took me around ~4 hours to beat and the rest is used for achievements. The story speaks of of loneliness, desperation, and a world that has to fight against two inexorable enemies: nature and human kind. If you look at the gameplay, there's not such a great challenge, but, on the other hand, you may find dramatic and somewhat decent storytelling. There are 5 possible endings in the game, and with replays from several save points throughout the game, I was only able to arrive at 2 of them. Each offers a slightly different potential outcome for our two main characters.

My main complain with this game is the huge frame drops, and it always happens whenever Alice (2nd screenshot) goes outside. I tried several things with no avail, so I just sucked it up and finished the game. There's also the problem where I found it a a bit hard to become emotionally invested in the characters. After all, if everyone is a survivalist animal, why should you care which animal survives and which one doesn’t? The game tries a little too hard to tug on your heart strings with Alice’s cute and naive five year old son, Barney, and while Richard does at least invite a little bit of sympathy, the same can’t be said with Alice. In describing her childhood and her background, she strikes me as a perpetually depressed melancholic for whom the Snowpocalypse is just another average day. She is the kind of person who would be insufferable even in a utopia. Other than that, it also feels like the game didn't really live up to its own potential, and instead of leaving you with a rewarding experience, it constantly hammered you with a message that all humans eventually succumb to their evil nature, and that none of us are deserving of good fortune, nor will we find it, in the event of global tragedy—and that, frankly, perseverance will be a wholly useless endeavor should we ever reach such a level of desperation.

Maybe that's all true, and maybe Richard & Alice at least deserves credit for being able to stimulate this kind of discussion. It may also deserves some credit for being engaging enough for me to want to play it to its conclusion, even though that conclusion isn’t very satisfying. It isn’t a terrible game by a long stretch, and it is possible to like it if you don’t mind playing through what amounts to an interactive novel.

I can't really find anything online discussing my issue specifically either that has provided any major insight to getting this game to work.

I won't blame the developers specifically, because this seems a product of the engine they used to make this game called Adventure Game Studio.

Anywho, I was attracted to this game because of the story so I suppose I will just watch a let's play since I cannot for the life of me get this game to load.

I really like adventure games. I really like adventure game studio. I really like Owl Cave. I was even really intrigued by the premise of this story. I really wish I liked Richard and Alice.

But it's soooo sloooow. Not pacing-wise. But the movement speed of the characters is so slow, the dialogue progression is so slow, and the thought of replaying this game to see the different endings made me want to tear my eyeballs out.

The other problem is the kid in the story, Barney. Especially early on, in Alice's first story, he makes the story into The Room.  They're locked in a tiny room by an angry man who comes in and (possibly rapes alice and) have to work together to escape their long imprisonment. It is The Room but with different names, and I hated that story too. 

Maybe it's just my virulent hatred of children, but I found Barney to be generally irritating. I know kids in stories like these are usually there to make the unpleasantness of the surroundings all the starker, and it probably would have been a very dull game without someone for Alice to talk to, but in later chapters where you go out on your own ocassionally it wasn't so bad. I guess I should be grateful Barney doesn't have some kind of transliterated speech impediment. Sigh.

GAMEPLAY

You won't struggle with many puzzles - most of Richard's involve only what is at hand in his cell - but they do require enough lateral thinking to avoid boredom and don't succumb to that old point-and-click illogic (put the rubber duck on the stick because that's what you have and voilá!).

STORY

The post-apocalptic setting is understated and believable. It makes the already well-written interactions all the more heart-wrenching. This is not a long game - took me a 3-hour run with one instance of wandering around for the last big puzzle (I forgot to check a cabinet). But the journey is instantly engrossing and uses minimalist audio and visuals to its advantage, creating a melancholic and foreboding sense throughout. The beauty in this game is implicit - it tackles some seriously dark themes without being gratuitous and asks philosophical questions without being pretentious.",1463102516,1463102516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can see the love that's been poured into it, and it feels mean-spirited to give it a thumbs down when it is exactly the genre i most enjoy, but it just doesn't quite work.

Richard & Alice is an indie adventure game, primarily narrative driven and with minimal puzzles. It might have worked better without the puzzles, since they are all fairly contrived, but that's not a big deal. The dialog between the two title characters in cells opposite from one another is quite good and those emotional beats are the highlight of the game. Unfortunately the flashbacks ruin the whole setup. These focus on an extremely annoying child and his mother's cringe-inducing babytalk and insipid doting. About 5 minutes in you will want them both to die painfully, but instead of the story progressing past that stage you have to sit through a whole nother hour of it. Eventually the game rushes to tie everything up in a 2 minute finale that doesn't have any emotional weight because the motivations revealed in the flashbacks were so shallow. It's a real shame, because the basic concept has a lot of promise.

Intriguing story set in a post-apocalyptic world that centres around a man named Richard and his prisoner counterpart, Alice. You take turns playing as either Richard or Alice, though Alice's part is far greater, and her story is told entirely through flashbacks (i.e. events that have already transpired).

[h1]What I liked[/h1]
[olist]
    [*][u]Good story[/u] - Far too predictable for my liking, but still interesting. The use of flashbacks as a way of unfolding the tale was fascinating; I always felt like I wanted to find out more and that kept me playing.
    [*][u]Has a proper ending[/u] - I hate games where they leave you hanging and don't resolve things adequately if at all. Thankfully, [i]Richard & Alice[/i] is [b]not[/b] one of those games.
    [*][u]Interesting setup[/u] - You experience playing as someone in a jail cell, and another outside roaming in the open world. Nice contrast.
    [*][u]Exciting[/u] - Has its fair share of drama and even gore, though the gore part could've been amped up 1000 times more yet. (Pixel blood isn't all that shocking, especially in minute quantities.)
    [*][u]Graphics are ok[/u] - AGS-type scenery here, but it worked. (Except for the character artwork which I didn't like. See point #5 under [i]""What I didn't[/i]"" below.)
    [*][u]Has a bit of replay value[/u] - If you missed out on achievements. [i]See point below.[/i]
    [*][u]Many achievements[/u] - A handy way of seeing if you missed out on any story elements. Upon first completing the game I realised I'd missed out on several; will replay to get them.
[/olist]

[h1]What I didn't[/h1]
[olist]
    [*][u]Too short[/u] - Approximately 2+ hours max for me. Most of it was spent clicking through looooong conversations, or reading picked up notes and stuff.
    [*][u]No challenge at all[/u] - Partly because of the limited screens available to you (see point below), the answers as to what to do next were way too obvious, especially since there were so few inventory items too.
    [*][u]Limited exploration[/u] - At any point of time, only 1-3 screens are accessible. Most of the time it's just 1.
    [*][u]Some puzzles didn't make sense[/u] - In one instance, you [i]must[/i] find a tray and use it, even though you quite clearly have a notebook [i]and[/i] newspaper which could be used for the [i]exact same purpose[/i]. [b]Thumbs down for [i]non-creative[/i] puzzle-solving![/b]
    [*][u]Characters are cutesy-looking sprites[/u] - Didn't work for me. We have a really [i]serious story[/i] which tackles many [i]heavy issues[/i] here, so I'd have appreciated more ""adult-looking"" characters and not some manga-ish kawaii dwarf people. It really undermined the whole affair. There is the right game for anime-style peeps, and this ain't one of 'em.
    [*][u]No voice[/u] - Being nitpicky here, but if you consider the game was like 80% conversation, this would've greatly added to the atmosphere.
    [*][u]Barebones sound & music[/u] - No music in many scenes; just background sound. Many a time it was silence, or felt akin to it. Seemed kinda empty.

It's far, far from perfect, but it's well written enough to be worth a purchase.

The world has frozen over into an apocalyptic hellscape and it never stops snowing. The government struggles to maintain relevance, people starve to death on the daily, and there is very little to hope for. Richard and Alice, the titular characters, find themselves in a prison that is actually a test facility for people to shelter themselves away from the weather in. The two quickly hit it off, and with alternating stories, we learn about what happened to Alice that landed her in there and how the two plan on escaping. To say much more would be to ruin the surprises the game holds, but it;s a mostly well done story, even though there are som confusing elements by the end (that might be cleared up by seeing the other endings).

The issues lie in the puzzles and graphics. Puzzles are nothing more than key hunts, and trying everything you have on everything in the environment. They grow tedious when in the big areas later on, in aprt because of the deathly slow walking speed (with no option to speed up). The graphics, while technically not horrendous stylistically, are not fitting for the grim tone this game portrays. It references such bleak post apocalyptic fiction such as The Road, but the visuals in the game are not conducive to the similar atmosphere its going for.

Still, it goes on sale regularly, and like I said, is pretty well written and intriguing. As long as you can handle some tedium, it's worth the purchase.",1456293127,1456293127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In a genre awash with truly abominable games going back decades, many from large, reputable developers, Richard and Alice does not deserve to be lumped in with the awful majority.  It is not a bad game.  But neither is it particularly inspired.  I don't feel strongly enough about the game to give it a thumbs down, but be warned that you'll probably only /like/ this game if you are a big fan of adventure games and also bleak drama.

I can't even call the game post-apocalyptic, because while the game is clearly post-apocalyptic the apocalypse in this case is the most banal thing imaginable.  No zombies or battle cars here.  Not even a radioactive or biohazardous wasteland.  And that kind of sums up the story, here -- it's got the set-up to be something, but it's just not compelling.  The characters aren't unlikable, they're just bland.  The story isn't boring, it's just hollow.

The puzzles never really had me scratching my head, although I did have to cheat once because there is an item the game tells you is present but hidden from view in one chapter and you have to remember and go back for it in a later chapter.  I did not.  

Why they don't just give you the item immediately is unclear to me, but there is a running theme of a lack of consideration toward the player in the game.  At one point you need to reach something in the middle of a lake.  You can't reach it from this side of the lake, though -- the game makes you walk all the way around to the other side, where the gap is slightly narrower.

Incompetech.com did the music in the game.  I like Macleod's work.  I also like his graph paper.

The graphics are simple but they serve their purpose.  The weird thing about the graphics is how many graphical settings the game has.  Up to 8x anti-aliasing!  2560x1600 resolution!  One of the settings is labeled ""powerful CPUs only.""  I'm not sure what that means, because this game doesn't look like it should strain an abacus.  

I'm not criticizing -- I'm not a big believer in HD/4K/ultra-high nonsense, and you can see what the graphics look like in the screenshots above.  If it's going to turn you off, don't buy the game.  But honestly, they're not so bad that they're a point against.

In short, Richard and Alice is serviceable.  I won't be so cruel as to call it forgettable, but it is certainly not memorable.  If you like adventure games and stories about the worst parts of parenthood, the dark side of humanity, and snow, it might just be worth your six bucks.",1455573010,1455573010,True,3,1,0.558089673519134521,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The point and click setup is faithful, but the game is very slow, and you'll spend most of your time in this game reading and moving at a snail's pace. Despite this, I still wholeheatedly reccomend Richard & Alice. The storytelling is fantastic, and the puzzles are unique and creative. It feels very rewarding and personal to solve puzzles and figure things out. The game asks you to get crafty with minimal options, and provides nicer breakups from your standard ""fetchquest"" fare. It made me feel smart to play a point-and-click game. At its worst, the limited options it gives you makes for the ""click on everything until it works"" method alot easier. In most situations what I had to do made sense, except for one of the prison puzzles.

Besides that, the only other gameeplay criticism I have to make is that the game could've been more interactive. We've seen faster paced RPG-maker-esque games with action segments like The Witch's House, so I was really expecting to play through a chase scene or a stealth puzzle instead of having it happen off-screen. Regardless, the game does what it can, and it does it well. (Aside from the bad endings of course)

Every character serves a purpose. Alice faces a single parents' struggle alongside trying to stay hopeful and survive. The gang members put their own survival above all else and it tells you about what kind of people they were before the apocalypse. Richard and Alice talk alot about what in humanity is worth saving, and how much that takes precedent over their own survival. It's all so well-planned. I feel like the writing is nothing too revolutionary, but it's never been executed so well in a non-VN video game.

The ending segments to Richard & Alice are something different. Instead of the game falling flat on its face with a super tragic ending to the characters we personally relate to in order to shock us and showcase ""the concequences of poor moral behavior"", this game gives you some morals to think about and uphold. Quotable statements about humanity. Philosophical meaning behind character actions. It's just...a really good game with a story, okay?

Since it received worse ratings then the previously listed disappointments one might be tempted to think it worse. However, in my opinion, it’s far better.

everything else about the game is kind of terrible though. the worst part is the walking speed, which is ludicrously slow. the environments are very small, but it can still take a minute or two just to get from one end of a map to another; this becomes very tedious when backtracking gets involved, usually to fetch an item to solve one of the game's puzzles, if they could even be called that considering how mundane and obvious their solutions are. the only time i got stuck was when i couldn't figure out that a path to another area opened up, and that's only because it wasn't pointed out textually nor visually. multiple endings are usually a plus, but considering that their flags aren't always at the end of the game the busywork required to get them makes them far less appealing.

the game is not very pretty either, with minimal animation and bland maps (despite there being only like, 15 or so), and the music is either royalty-free or otherwise unmemorable. i've also experienced an issue where the audio stutters every time the scene changes; i realize that adventure game studio isn't the best engine, but i've played games made in it that are far more graphically intensive yet felt like they ran better. lastly, there's a cameo that's so hamfisted it honestly feels like advertising for a much better game.

overall, richard & alice kept me interested enough to see what would happen next, but that's it. the glacial pace of its gameplay was annoying, i don't feel like i've experienced anything new from its story, and while the characters and events were realistic, perhaps even sympathetic, i can't say i truly cared about any of them. i've gotten 3 out of 5 endings, including the one that involved the most effort, but none of them were particularly remarkable and i really don't feel like putting in another half-hour of walking back and forth just to get the last two.

This game is, in my opinion, below average in all regards. I'll start by the technical aspects, then go to gameplay/design choices, and finally I'll discuss the plot (I'll put it under spoilers, know that I will discuss all the twists, so don't read it if for some reason walking blind into a story is important for you).

Richard & Alice uses the Adventure Games Studio engine, a freeware development tool specific for point and click games, although it has been used for other genres from time to time. The game is functionally fine, the sounds are sparse but okay, and the music fits the theme, even if it's not memorable. The game is also very short, even if you wander around like I did, you should take about 2 hours to complete it. Not much else to say, the game doesn't stray away from the classic point and click formula, so everything works as expected, although I have seen more impressive uses of the engine.

The gameplay, despite its semplicity, manages to be disappointing thanks to the incredibly slow movement speed, paired with a couple of large, empty screens, making exploration (or back-tracking) a painful experience. Most puzzles are very easy, although I would argue one in particular is asinine in the round about way you have to go through in order to solve it. Also disappointing is just how little gameplay there is, even for a point and click. The way the ending you get is determined is probably the only clever-ish thing about it, although the results are obfuscated by how indirect some of the cause-effect links are. There is a certain amount of forced back-tracking, which is not only slow, as mentioned before, but takes you through supremely bland screens. The art is subpar, It's even less interesting than standard RPGmaker tiles, and calling it functional is probably the only praise you can bestow upon it.

The plot is not really great. If you can't tell the first plot twist in the first 5 minutes, you probably aren't very observant, or are completely unable to detect obvious storytelling devices. The second twist is slightly harder to predict, but still qualifies as a no brainer, and these are really the only surprises in the game, the rest is played out in a completely straight manner. The world building is incredibly stupid, there is no rhyme nor reason for how society seems to be organized (what little you can see or hear of it), several events are left without explanations, the dialogues are just painful (I can't tell if the kid is supposed to have some learning disabilities, or if they just poorly imitated a 5 year old, and at least a few of the rare ""existential"" dialogues are bland and trite, something you have likely heard before). Point and click games live and die by their story and characters, and this game doesn't provide witty, interesting, smart or likeable characters, and has to rely on the emotional crutch of family bonds for the most part just to be relatable.

Now, for the spoilers:

[spoiler]The kid is dead. It's painfully obvious, and the fact that is portrayed as a reveal it's a joke. The kid at least isn't as bad as children in other games, but only barely so. It's a cheap narrative tool that doubles as a way to manipulate you into feeling sorry for the characters. Whenever it's convenient, he'll do stupid stuff and be oblivious to his surroundings, so that you can have the story move forward, but he'll also be mature when required (and get sick to the point of no return, too). Thankfully, the game is short, so they can't drag this for too long, but it's still obvious and disappointing. You'll find several notes to read through the game, and not reading them all can affect the ending (very, VERY hard to miss them, unless you do so deliberately to get the other endings, which means you must have read a guide to know about it). The writing is a mixed bag in terms of quality here, some give you some interesting hints about what's going on, some are meant to paint the bleakness of this world, but it often isn't well put together, lacks depth or emotion, is generally unnecessary. Richard doesn't get much screen time, so you have to rely on the notes and the final parts of the game, to really flesh him out a bit. He is still a clichè, but at least he didn't mercy kill his own blood like Alice did, so at least he isn't THAT cliched. Alice is a joke, her lines are often baffling and awkward beyond the authors' intentions, (see the exchanges with Richard, or even the dialogue with the mysterious stranger in the church, supposedly the moral turning point that leads her to the decision to kill her son). The world building is disappointing, all is referred to in vague terms, but still that's what drives the characters to do what they do, something more substantial would be greatly appreciated. The game is short, so really there isn't anything worthwhile to mention beyond this.[/spoiler]

In conclusion, despite me being very negative in the review, the truth is that it's ""just"" a subpar game. Do not buy it, (there are much better games that tackle serious themes, while doing a much better job) unless you are really into point and click and you completely ran out of other games to play in the genre, and even then do not buy at full price, you can find better games for free, so spend your money wisely.",1444918590,1444918590,False,8,0,0.626184284687042236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's meant to provoke an emotional response. It does this well; perhaps not as well as some of the other titles mentioned above - particularly Dear Esther, which I assume was made so you could post really depressing things to Facebook without having to personally write them (I kid, I love that game).

It's a retro-style game; the best way to describe it would be similar to RPG-Maker games. I'm not sure what engine the game uses in that regard. I think Adventure Game Maker or something like that. But anyway - the review. I'm rambling.

So Richard & Alice takes place after a post-apocalyptic event that transforms the world into [strike]northern Canada[/strike] a desolate, snow-covered wasteland. The two protagonists - Richard and, uh, you know, Alice - are trapped in an underground automated prison facility and apparently left to their own devices. Like you do when you've been captured after the end of the world due to [strike]global warming[/strike] some unknown ecological disaster, Richard and Alice begin to tell each other stories about what they did prior to their incarceration.

The gameplay itself centers around Alice's story with her little boy. Richard & Alice stays true to the adventure game roots from which it draws, relying on the point-and-click mechanic and item collection system. Think King's Quest or the Monkey Island franchise. Players who are used to the compulsive adventure game method of I WILL USE EVERY ITEM WITH THIS THING OMGBBQLOL will find that many items in the game have other uses aside from their intended ones. Many being a prejorative term, considering there are about ten or fifteen total.

Where Richard & Alice (Or R+A, like what the kids on the street say) really shines is in its ability to tell a story. Perhaps to its credit, it does not have the heavy-handed (and rather bizarre) example of [strike]creepy obsession[/strike] love that Always Sometimes Monsters displays; to its detriment - maybe, it's hard to say - it doesn't have the same emotional punch that To The Moon has.

Altogether, Richard and Alice is a short story about pain, loss, the love of a mother and child, and attempting to reconcile what all of it means. Get it if you want to feel something. It takes a couple hours and it tells something that's rather original and you likely won't be disappointed. If you are, you can blame me I suppose. I'm not entirely sure what good it would do, but that's okay, I guess.

Speaking of which, the game could've   be called Alice & Barney better, because Barney is way more interesting, and has a much bigger part than Richard.

There is no voice-acting but the backstory of the characters is well written and it's not hard to sympathize with the main characters. The game even has it's morbid moments and it lets you truly feel the world is totally f'd up.

But there's a major BUT, because sometimes I wonder if the developers weren't better of making a movie instead of a game. Really, sometimes you're listening to conversations for at least ten minutes without any form of interactivity. Then , if you're lucky, you may snoop around for a couple of minutes followed by a new, long conversation. The real adventure-sequences are not that special in any way and that's a bit of a letdown. 

However, for a couple of bucks it's worth the try. When the credits show up, you'll realize you've played a pretty neat game with a touchy story.

Genre: Point & click adventure, RPG Maker style
Setting: USA in alternate present, half the world covered in snow
Difficulty: 2/10 --> easy
Length: 2-3 hours on first playthrough, approx. 1 hour per single rerun
Mode: singleplayer campaign only


The positive aspects:

- well-written storyline with a serious tone and five different endings. That also means high replayability
- decent graphics in the typical style of RPG Maker games
- strong and credible atmosphere in a disaster-struck United States


The negative aspects:

- rather short (2-3 hours to complete), only a few places to visit
- no challenging riddles
- lacking animations, sounds and voice acting. That is a pity, because as mentioned above, the game creates a tensioning atmosphere. Could have been even better if the developers put some extra work into that issues



Result:

Regarding the pros and cons, this should be a 50-50, right? 

But it isn't: If you like games with appealing story lines and elaborated topics, this one is for you. Also, it has that retro charme, plus it's point & click.

Point of this game is to convey a significant/provocative/deep/what-have-you story; basically seems a good story. 
Heh, yeah, yeah it does.

Fault of this game is that the gameplay interferes with the point; some of the slowest walking ever - lots of backtracking / painful trial-and-error to figure out ((""))puzzles(("")) step by step. 
The story, having to fit with that game(play) is drawn out and tries to make characterization and interactions amongst characters be the core of that story. Thus far, the majority is banter between a loving but stressed mother and an ignorant but lovable (if not a tad annoying) child. 
Heh, yeah... yeah it is.

I understand and am not cold-hearted to the point of being put-off by that sort of exchange - not at all, I can dig it actually; a human ""Shelter,"" (badger game) so to speak - but when I have to spend two minutes to get from one screen to the next *times* 3 (because backtracking), to be rewarded with more of the same (""No baby, blabla [I'm being pushed to the brink, not necessarily because of you, but you sure aren't helping. *trying to keep my patience and figure this out*]."")...


Yet again, another game that seems would've been better off as a written story (disregarding the fact that gamers must have been the target audience, since the devs are/were apparently professional game journalists); as a video game, it is (sub-)par. Thusly,  I have to vote against it (though I don't want to). Perhaps when (-IF-) I beat it (because it's trying MY patience, too), I might find it worth the grind, as it were. For now, I must say it's too much a chore. 
Heh, yeah, yeah it is.

...That might be twisted to be a triumph, as the bleakness of the in-game world is being thrust upon the player. So. Mindfack(?) I've no interest in such... deep/pervasive storytelling if I have to push myself as hard as those who are in the story do themselves, so that I might know the story, 'specially when it hasn't even got to the gripping part yet... dig? Me neither. 


TL;DR *Meh* to *Feh* - Gameplay gets in the way of the game - Wish I could twist this into a positive. Heh, yeah, yeah I do.


EDIT: Walkthrough from Steam Guides: 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=375308346
There's no shame in following this, since the game can be such a slog (a lot of the puzzle solutions actually make sense, but the steps to achieve them aren't as apparent). Again, the point of the game is the story anyway, so cheat to get to the actual game (that is, the story). 
Should I find the story worth it - after having found that guide - I might change the Negative to Positive. Will see. 
Heh, yeah... yeah we will.

EDIT 2: When I wrote this, I was on the next to last level. Gripping part just happened... 
heh, yeah... yeah it did. 
Keep having to quit the game to look at that Guide, [strike]since there's no Steam Overlay while in-game, presumably because of the engine (but that's a whole other (angry) ramble).[/strike]

EDIT 3: There are screenshots posted of the game, so the Steam Overlay apparently does work, for some. I have a laptop hooked to a TV with a HDMI cord; I had to edit the game's files 
http://steamcommunity.com/app/279260/discussions/0/540743757019254496/#p2
to get the screen stretched to fit the TV well enough (and some of the sides were still cut off) - couldn't even see Achievement notifications, but quitting the game proved they did unlock correct. 
Beat the game; five different endings. The one I got made me sad, but I feel like it's (one of the better/)the best ending.

A man, Richard, is in an underground prison cell when a new prisoner, Alice, is suddenly brought into the cell across from his.

I will update this review once I can make a better assessment. My initial impression is that it was a sloppy decision to make the user have to do a workaround just to get it working on full screen. The default mode is a windowed mode about 1/4 of my screen size.  In order to get it on full screen or a decent resolution, you need to locate the install files and open ""winsetup.exe"". This is the options. It will give you an error, telling you that it cannot find the required file. After this, you must make a copy of the game file ""richardandalice.exe"", then rename it to ""richardandalice_steam_final.exe"". Apparently, the game makers forgot to include this final steam exe in the installation files. Anyways... Once you do this, then you must reopen ""winsetup.exe"". This will allow you to disable windowed mode, which then gives you a full screen mode. However, full screen really just means the black border will then extend across the whole screen, and the game itself will remain the same windowed size. Apparently, if you want a decently visible full screen mode, you must need to do the advanced settings. For me, I was able to get a regular full screen mode by disabling the ""Enable Side Borders"" button. Hopefully, this will work for you. 

After this, I only played the game for a short bit. Pretty early one, the main characters discuss the idea of the morality/immorality of murder. It seems that the game will delve into this issue. According to the screenshots, it would not surprise me if this game questions not only moral issues, but also religious ones... though I cannot say for sure. If so, I'm not a fan.

So far, I've been disappointed by the sloppiness of the makers of this game in the options. Seriously, if you spent adequate time making a good game, I would hope you would do the same in the options needed to make it playable. I will update this review later. Hopefully, I am surprised.

PROS:
- A strong story, which is both beautiful and heartfelt.
- The tone is just right, in a desperate survialist world affected by snow.
- The relationship between Richard & Alice is authentic and realistic, you see how it grows through fear, laughter and their sharing of both hope and memories.
- Puzzles are imaginative and thought provoking with little guidence.
- There are two endings.
- Due to clever writing nothing is ever clear as you uncover the truth.

CONS:
- The graphics are not the best but are suitable for the games style,
- In more open areas gameplay is spoilt by some poor movement.
- A somewhat short story at 3 hours.
- Although this is no con for me due to its excellent writing, there is a lot of dialog so be aware.

immer wieder gerne andere Indie Produktionen.
Richard & Alice ist ein Indie Point & Click Adventure mit einem Grafikstil der so ein
bisschen in die 16bit Area (Amiga, Atari ST) geht , irgendwie so abstrakt wie der Southpark Stil nur ohne Satire. Mit dem atmosphärischen Sound hat das gut funktioniert und wenn man bedenkt wie zu früheren Zeiten Adventure Firmen wie dtp und deren Entwickler aufgrund der hohen Kosten teilweise pleite gegangen sind, dann kann man sich schon fragen, warum nicht eigentlich so? Es ist sehr preiswert, aber trotzdem sehr atmosphärisch.

Sehr Atmosphärisch sind auch die Dialoge der wenigen Charaktere. Der Plot ist sehr gut durchdacht mit einigen unterschiedlichen Enden. Man sollte sich auf Survival und einige Grausamkeiten einstellen, aber mehr in Thriller Form, es geht nicht um Splatter oder so. Da ich Thriller über alles liebe kann ich nur sagen, das Spiel wird dem Thriller Aspekt sehr gerecht.
Ich selbst bin jetzt kein Englisch profi, komme halbwegs zurecht. Das Englisch ist hier tasächlich
gut zu verstehen und hat mich dirkt mitgerissen. Mag am Schreibstil liegen und weil später auch Kinder dabei sind, die zwangsläufig einfacher reden. xD

Ich persönlich finde Adventure Spiele super, die großen Fokus auf die Storyline legen und weniger auf Puzzles.
Die beste Spielserie in dieser Richtung waren die Nintendo DS Adventures Hotel Dusk und Last Window. Zwar kann Richard & Alice da nicht ganz mithalten auch weil es ""nur"" seine 6-7 Stunden Spielzeit hat, aber es hat mich schon ein bisschen daran erinnert und funktioniert ähnlich spannend. 

Für alle Adventure Freunde, die weniger wert auf Puzzles als auf eine gute Geschichte legen und
für die leicht zu verstehendes Englisch keine Hürde ist, ist dieses Indie Adventure wärmstens zu empfehlen.
Der kleine Preis rechtfertigt auch die kürzere Spielzeit, da kann man nicht meckern.

The story telling is amazing, it is wonderfully paced, the ambiance and the music is great, the graphics are bland and lifeless, which is exactly what they are going for. The characters are really interesting, and overall, it was a lot of fun.

But there are some bad things to. 

The biggest bad thing is that the price to play ratio is a little off. The game is $6.00 (although I did not buy it for that, I think I got it in a humble bundle) and it only took two hours to play all the way through. Thats $3.00 an hour. I guess it is just weird because I have more than 250 hours in Just Cause 2, which only set me back $2.30. They are two completly different games, but there is still a weirds imbalance there. This would be ok if I had the desire to play the game again, but is has exactly 0 replayability, unless you want 100% of the achievments.


The only other major bad thing was that there are some story points I would love to see fleshed out, and I am very excited for a possable sequel, but I think they could have crammed more content into this game for the price.

But really, check this game out. It is sad, it made me, a 6'3"" burly man cry all over my keyboard, and that is not something many games can do.

It's nothing of the sort, so don't be mistaken due to the artstyle.

Owl Cave, the developing team, is clearly fond of old-school point n' click games, and this is exactly that! Honestly, there isn't much to it, [i]as a game[/i], to make it stand out. It doesn't have any interesting mechanic, or anything of the sort. It's visual and audio design is also very minimal.
Where it shines, however, is in its story! I've taken a few points to write about, but it's mostly about how they could have made it more of a game, and also overcome the downsides of old point n' clicks, with their very sluggish movement, and some frustrating puzzle design. 

This game avoids most of that, though, using the puzzles merely to get you more into the story. I will not, of course, review the story, and I'll avoid spoilers, but I'm very positive on it, overall.


[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]
This is, by far, the weakest aspect of the game!
I've seen some people disappointed, claiming it's ""MSPaint Graphics"". It's not [i]that[/i] bad, for sure. But you can definitely understand that reaction. It has a very low resolution, and also simple and outdated tile sets. The structures' perspective is also a bit off... 
All in all, this is not something you'll play for sight-seeing in the least. However, it has just enough to carry the story, and giving each scene the right atmosphere, in this [b]barren and anarchic[/b] world.

Unfortunately, it's very static, which is okay, but I would have liked it not to have been in one particular aspect: the [b]character portraits[/b]. They're always the same! I realize that it was perhaps more work than it warranted, but it was a chance to add a lot of personality into the game, as I see it. Just having the portraits be in sync with their tone. Heh, it's not very important, but could have been better.

The [b]music[/b] seems to be equally as low-fi, strangely enough. It's not 8 or 16 bit or anything like that, but it somehow feels... old? It's strange to describe it. But it's mostly ambience music and sound effects, complementing the visuals to set the stage for the dialog. I found it surprisingly fitting in the game.
Everything loops well and nothing felt out of place.

There is no voice-acting.

I appreciated the [b]writting[/b] quite a lot! You can understand the tone in each character's line, and the dialogue options that they give you are always legitimate. I'll talk about this further ahead, but there are a few choices that will affect the endings, although you may not initially realize it. 


[b][u]General Structure[/u][/b]
There are 2 main characters in Richard & Alice, unsurprisingly. You're both in a prison, and all you can do is talk to each other, in separated cells. Mostly,it's about you, Richard, listening to Alice's story, about how she got there.
The game alternates between the characters. The smallest chunk of the game is in the cells, where you play as Richard, speak to Alice, and solve some very minor puzzles. It also helps you understand the world around you a bit more.
The biggest chunk, is where you play as Alice and her son, Barney, following how she was ""arrested"".

The prison sections are mostly there to break up the pacing, which is surprisingly good! The game never felt tiresome or to drag on as a result.


[b][u]Puzzles and Gameplay[/u][/b]
The first thing you'll notice, is how sluggish the movement is. You shouldn't be unfamiliar with it, if you're used to point n' click games... it's always their sore spot! 
This game is just the same. It's a bit awkward to move, and even to pick things up. You left click to [b]use[/b] and right click to [b]inspect[/b]. And that's basically all you need to know.
You can also advanced dialogue by clicking, skipping to the next line. There's a way to skip a scene entirely (scenes which you do not control) by holding SpaceBar -- This is never explained in the game...

You can always Save/Load at any time, which is great! There are a couple of bugs, sometimes, which can easily be fixed by simply reloading, without losing any progress.

There isn't much to the [b]puzzles[/b], honestly. It's mostly about exploring the scenes, collecting items, and then using them in the right place, or combining them. It's very standard in the genre. There isn't any pixel-hunting, and you'll generally be able to solve them rather quickly. 
During [b]most[/b] of the game, the areas are also fairly small, so every solution to a give puzzle is nearby, avoiding the slow walking that usually comes with these puzzles. 
Unfortunately, there are 2 (maybe) scenes that have 3 areas you can visit and in those, you'll [i]have to[/i] walk back and forth, very slowly, until you find the right items. That was a bit frustrating to me, as are most of point n' click games, but it was nothing unbearable. Honestly, they've avoided most of it, so that's good! It will not get in the way of the story.


Well... I think that covers it. As I can't review the story, it's hard to tell you what this game does right. The game itself is serviceable, but the way it paces the story, and gives you [i]some[/i] freedom within it is where it shines. This is definitely not something you'll play for the puzzles or mechanics. If you enjoyed To the Moon, Primordia, Home, etc. I think you'll definitely appreciate this.

The story is quite mature, and the world has gone to hell, but the story it tells is credible, and there are certainly many aspects with which the player can identify with. Some people found it depressing, which is understandable, so know what you're getting into. I don't think it's anything shocking, but it's definitely not a light-hearted and happy story. It's a lot about [b]what people would do if faced with risk of survival[/b]. It's [b]not[/b] about zombies, or nuclear war. In fact, the setting is never explained, as it's there as a mere symbol/concept. And that's all I'll say about it. 


The issue I've had with the [b]puzzles[/b] was simply the fact that you can easily miss a very specific item, for an ambiguous purpose. What I mean by that is that several other items in your inventory could provide you with the exact same utility – but of course, the game doesn't aknowledge that, and will leave you walking in circles, re-inspecting everything. That's not something I like, of course, but changing that would probably require a whole re-design of how puzzles are done in the genre, which is far outside the scope of the review. One last thing.

[b][i]How choice is handled in the different endings[/i][/b]
From what I understand, the most important choices, are the ones you make when talking to Barney. These are usually question about the state of the world that you, as a player, may not know about. It's interesting, really. It's an uninformed decision, yet, it's a valid one, since you're basically telling your son how the world is, and sometimes how people interact. And how you choose to show him, is how the ending will be presented, in a way. 
The ending is based both on deduction done with the clues you've found (depending on the notes you find, your actions in the end may change, thus changing the ending), and also based on how you chose to [i]see[/i] the world.

All in all, it will be very fitting to you, personally, and how you've played the game, it's very good!
The downside to it, is that getting several endings may be a bit laborious (since you'll have to replay big portions of the game that doesn't change much, expect for the ending), and also that the forum discussion will not be as interesting. 
Take Home, for instance. That game's discussion were based on what actually happened in the game, not just the ending. And it was great! Since in this game they're mostly about its conclusion, discussion will not be as nice. 
To be honest, I think it's good news, if such an issue is what I throw at your game, haha!

Let's start out with the high points here.  The story of Richard and Alice is absolutely compelling with a particular high note being the well written dialog between characters.  The conversational segments in the game flow naturally and realistically.  At no point did the dialog seem stilted or poorly written.  This is a particularly notable feat when one considers the amount of dialog between Alice and her 5 (and a half!) year old son Barney.  It's [i]hard[/i] to write children's dialog between parent and child in such a way that it seems natural.  Most [i]novels[/i] can't get this sort of thing right, let alone the medium of video games.  I think you almost have to be a parent yourself in order to effectively write this sort of dialog, and IMO Richard and Alice excels at it.  Creating emotional connection between the player and the in game characters is critical to this games success, and thankfully it nails this part.

The game also presents itself as an interesting piece of sci-fi.  The near future dystopia has been done to death for ages untold at this point, but Richard and Alice neatly avoids most of the typical tropes and clichés of this setting in that it never waves its world around in your face.  The setting here merely serves as a backdrop for the unfolding human drama, but for the most part leaves the concrete dystopian details as part of that backdrop.  It's a largely successful approach as it (rightly, IMO) assumes most players are sophisticated enough to be well versed in the rules of such a world by virtue of previous exposure in the form of other games, film, and books.  It effectively tells you what you need to know of the world in order to move the plot along and leaves the rest to imagination.

The gameplay is largely successful but equally does falter in some areas.  The point and click adventure elements here are fairly straight forward and rote.  There are only three relatively confined areas to explore in the game (four if you're feeling exceedingly generous).  Further, the level of interactivity in these areas is limited in such a way as to effectively move you from point A to point B in the story without a lot of tarrying about.  If you're seeking a richly vibrant, highly interactive point & click title, Richard and Alice is not necessarily going to give you that.  The world here exists as a plot device, and the interactive elements within that world are strictly limited to those that serve the plot in some way.  So yes, this is a rather tightly wound narrative without the indulgence of unnecessary distractions.  Having said that, Richard and Alice incorporates some interesting game mechanics in service to that world and to the general tone of the game.  Much has been made of the fact that character movement feels extremely sluggish, and believe me it does, it really, [i]really[/i] does.  It's my opinion though, that this was a conscious decision on the part of the developers.  The slow movement combined with the relentless sound of the snow ratchets up the tension and anxiety in the game, particularly when there are other characters in peril.  It makes the world feel claustrophobic and as if it's actively working against you.   It doesn't make it any less frustrating mind, but it is ultimately an effective decision.

The one other aspect of the game play that troubles me a bit is that of the multiple endings offered here.  There are no less than five possible endings for Richard and Alice, which would seem to indicate the possibility of a branching story line.  To be clear on this point, there are [i]absolutely no[/i] branches along the way in this story.  The ending you get is strictly based on rather arbitrary in-game choices that do not affect the narrative in progress whatsoever.  So if you want to see the multiple endings, you'll play through the [i]exact[/i] same story multiple times with the only points of differentiation being the endings themselves.  It's as if you're reading a Choose Your Own Adventure book in which the only story deviation occurs in the final two pages of the book.  Now to be clear the story [i]is[/i] excellent, and IMO it does warrant [i]at least[/i] one additional play through to pick up on the clues and hints that you may have missed the first time around.  But to play through the game [i]five times[/i] introduces a sense of drudgery and tedium, particularly when coupled with the slow character movement mentioned above.  More damningly it also reduces some of the emotional wallop present in the game with each additional playthrough.  Accordingly, if you're going for multiple playthroughs I'd recommend taking a suitable cool down period in betwixt.

Gameplay is typical Find this object and add to this object to create another object that you need to further story.

This game is great, but it needs more polish.
1. Pace: This is my biggest problem with the game. It drags on like it has smashed legs. Not only is the story slow, the characters walk like they've just  learned how. It makes the game agonizingly boring. I love the game but jeez, speed it up. I feel like you went for a more drawn out story. The story has about five scenes, but the game is just so slow.
2. Plot: It never climaxes. Ever. Enough said.
3. Characters: Alice is a cool character and all, but what about Richard? His story takes place in a cell. Does he get a backstory? Is like a DLC I'm just missing out?
4. Art: It's not as good as RPG Maker. RPG Maker is only $60. You couldn't budget that?
5. Tutorial/Help: It has no help. It plops you in with no guidiance in the game. How do you know whats right?
Score: 4.5/10

Ничего не имею против пиксельной графики, но здесь она кошмарна (особенно персонажи на экране).

Главная проблема, на мой взгляд, это монотонность повествования (помноженная на отсутствие русского перевода).

The focus of this game is a moving, post-apocalyptic story. Two people are locked up together in a world covered with ice, and Alice tells how she got there, and so you are able to play as Alice during each part of her story. 
This is a mature and very sad story, with very strong and heart wrenching questions, so do not expect anything cheerful.

Gameplay:

Simple point and click interface, with only the left and right mouse buttons to interact or the ENTER button in the keyboard to skip conversations (hold to skip faster). Simple puzzles that make sense and are logical, but not very challenging. I only got stuck once, because I did not know what I was supposed to do.

Sound:

Amazing sound effects that make you feel the bleakness of the environment. Really good!

Voice: None, only subtitles for dialogs

Graphics:

Simple but functional, not a problem for a story-focused game like this. Just make sure you configure the game (setup) before launching to play it in fullscreen and use Directx 3D 9. You'll need to copy and paste the game's exe file (""richardandalice.exe"") and rename the copy as ""richardandalice_steam_final.exe"". Then just click on the game through steam and choose setup while starting it to uncheck ""Run in a window instead of Fullscreen"" and change the Graphics Driver to Directx 3D 9.

Story:

Very well written for an indie game, it makes you want to know what is going to happen next. There are many possible endings, and it was not hard to get them all with a guide, after I was finished with the game. By the way, I recommend saving in the beginning of each scene to help you come back later for the other endings.

Conclusion:

This is a great game if you like story rich games that make you think and get involved with the game world. If you want hard puzzles, fast action or shining graphics, look elsewhere.

Es bemüht sich nicht um gute Grafik oder genialen Sound, sondern um Story, Setting und Charaktere. Und das freilich mit Erfolg. Schon nach wenigen Minuten widmet man sich gebannt der winterlich apokalyptischen Welt zu, dessen Hoffnung nach Nahrung, gemütlichen Gefilden und Menschlichkeit verloren gegangen zu sein scheint.
Dabei wechselt das Geschehen zwischen einem Gefängnis, welches das sicherste Gebäude der Welt genannt wird, und die bitterkalte Aussenwelt, die sich seit mehreren Jahren in eine erbarmungslose Winterlandschaft verwandelt hat. Letzteres ist der Schauplatz zur Vorgeschichte von Alice wie sie, genauso wie Richard, ins Gefängnis gelandet ist und ihr Dasein nun dort fristen muss.
Der Schwerpunkt der Geschichte liegt dabei bei Alice, deren  Erlebnisse mit simplen, doch effektiven mitteln sehr intensiv erzählt werden. Es gibt keine vertonten Dialoge und keine Mimik, dennoch spürt man die Bedrücktheit und Sorgen der Charaktere, was an den sehr gut geschriebenen Dialogen zu verdanken ist. 

Und obwohl das Spiel seine unschönen Seiten hat (Bedienung der Charaktere auf grossen Gebieten ziemlich zäh, lange Laufwege, kein Musikwechsel während den Dialogen, Adventure-Part ähnelt eher einem Wimmelbild-Spiel) hat mich die grösste Stärke des Spiels zum Weiterspielen getrieben: [u]Die Story[/u]. 
Traurigerweise hat es für mich jedoch auch eine entscheidende Macke: [u]Das Ende[/u]
Naja, besser gesagt hat es eher mit [u]einem Ende[/u] zu tun. Denn das Spiel besitzt insgesamt 5 Enden, welches je nach den eigenen Entscheidungen im Spiel variieren. Die Idee klingt zwar schön, jedoch war ich mit meinem Ende nicht zufrieden.
Sie kommt abrupt und lässt einem das Gefühl aufkommen, als hätte man nur die erste Hälfte eines Spiels gespielt. Eines sehr guten Spiels wohlgemerkt, jedoch wird man wohl die andere Hälfte nie zu Gesicht bekommen (Soweit gibt es kein offizielles Statement seitens der Entwickler bezüglich eines Sequels).
Die anderen Enden sind da viel besser, da sie die Geschichte mit einem gut platzierten Twist abschliessen.

[b]Trotzdem[/b] kann ich das Spiel jedem empfehlen, der eine harte und packende Geschichte erleben möchte und einen grossen Wert auf gute, zwischenmenschliche Dialoge legt. Denn genau das beherrscht das Spiel mit Bravour!

punto di forza : la storia
punto debole : tutto il resto
difficoltà medio
giocato su computer

complessivamente un brutto gioco. iniziamo con i punti positivi:
1)la storia è bella, scontata all'inizio(per i primi dieci minuti sembra la solita solfa postapocalittica blablabla.) ma capace di riprendersi sul finale(per fortuna almeno questo)anche se mi è dispiaciuta la mancanza di doppiaggio dei dialoghi, avrebbero dato molto più spessore al gioco.
2)sono presenti cinque finali diversi,ognuno carico dei suoi messaggi e dei suoi significati.(tentativo mal riuscito di spingere a rigiocare un gioco noioso, ma almeno ci hanno provato bisogna ammetterlo) 
3)l'ho pagato relativamente poco (1 euro e noccioline).
passiamo adesso ai lati negativi:
1)la grafica è uguale a quella del vecchio ""Yoda stories"" della Lucasarts, pulita,semplice  e carina ma non adatta ad un punta e clicca.
inoltre la protagonista va molto lenta,quindi nelle parti di esplorazione si perderà molto tempo per spostarci da una location all'altra,tempo che ci permetterà di imparare 
a memoria le due/tre location all'aperto presenti.
2)la parte di gaming è appena sufficiente, gli enigmi sono pochi e sono o troppo semplici, oppure troppo illogici per essere superati. la stupidità di alcune cose da fare è
l'unica vera difficoltà del gioco.
3)nel gioco si troveranno moltissime note/appunti/pezzi di diario che raccontano gli avvenimenti post apocalittici, e che si riveleranno essenziali per godere appieno
della storia. però poichè sono scritti come se fossero degli appunti su carta, in una grafia degna davvero di un uomo che sta per morire, saranno difficilissimi da leggere rovinando così buona parte della storia.
4)infine ci sono moltissimi altri difetti, come per esempio il menù degli oggetti troppo piccolo per farti capire cosa porti, oppure la musica che molto spesso è costituita  solo dal rumore del vento (certo fa atmosfera, ma una leggera musica di sottofondo sarebbe stata piacevole).
Nel complesso non mi è piaciuto, non è valsa la pena di giocarlo perchè questa storia sarebbe stata sfruttata meglio in altri modi (film,libri), come avventura grafica  avrebbe avuto bisogno di una maggiore cura e più lavoro di programmazione dietro (soprattutto per il layout e le meccaniche del gioco)per meno d un euro forse potrebbe valere la pena di acquistarlo ma per di più non credo proprio.

Not what I was expecting.

Is it worth it? If you have the patience to beat the game (or at least to get the best ending ""Nothing's Changed""), then yes, it is.

[i] Richard and Alice [/i]is about morals in a dystopian world. Yes, there have been many movies or games about this topic, but the difference it in how they present it and how much time is left/ time has passed until/since humanity’s downfall. In this case its weather, particularly snow that is what destroys the majority of society and from what remains come survivors and how much they will lose as humans to survive.

In that sense it is very similar to the [i] Walking Dead, [/i] but [i] Richard and Alice [/i]cleverly tells it is story through flashbacks and current events reflecting on the tragedies that occurred during that time. This game knows how to be a quiet storyteller. There’s no voice acting and only the quiet text with subtle background music/sound effects to tell it. This lets the moral message and emotional moments hit hard without any worry of a bad vocal performance. You take in and understand the events and when you imagine how these scenarios would sound in a movie dialogue, the quality of the writing really stands out.

The main problem is the gameplay, specifically the game engine. Now [i] Adventure Game Studio [/i] has been used to make some outstanding games (ex. [i] The Blackwell Legacy [/i] series), but this game suffers from sluggish movement in the big open environments and it drags when you just want the next bit of quality story info (at least on my fastest computer with a high graphics card). Also, the items are too small for the mouse cursor to pick up unless you are dead on accurate. Not to mention that the item menu makes movement in a certain direction difficult. It needed a visual overhaul, but on the other hand the lack of quality visuals makes some of the more horrific scenes bearable and leaves more to the imagination. So while it served its purpose for [i] Owl Cave’s [/i] first major release.

Overall, this game is a beautifully emotional novelette with five endings (my favourite is listed above) wrapped in a slow-paced adventure game (by my standards after [i] Blackwell). [/i] So if you can spare about three to five hours with a walkthrough guide, you will have a story that would make a good comic comparable to the [i] Walking Dead. [/i] If nothing else they have the rare skill to use limited visuals tell a beautiful story. It might test your patience, but it is worth it.

And look forward to their upcoming title [i] Location Services. [/i]",1414287690,1414287873,True,1,0,0.465072989463806152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is great, delving into some dark subject material and handling it well while also giving us a small cast of interesting charactersl
The gameplay is about as bad as it gets adventure-game wise, though. The puzzles as a whole are okay but there's a lot of having to place your cursor precisely on rather small objects and no way to boost up the resolution. Generally these are items necessary to progress, too, and I ended up stuck more than once trying to pick something up, failing to do so and thinking it wasn't something I could pick up. Chapter 8 in particular is a huge offender in this regard. This chapter in particular also suffers from insanely slow walking speeds; it's not a big issue elsewhere in the game but this chapter is the only real free-roaming one and it's just soooo sloooow. Add the tedious pixel hunting and it just left me in a bad mood, for the wrong reasons.
I'd honestly recommend this, with a caveat; just use a walkthrough the instant you find yourself unsure of how to progress and you'll be perfectly fine.

The second problem of the aesthetic, is yes I understand its minimalist, so its depressing, slow moving,
but honestly you could done a lot with your limitations. The few objects like the trees looked as if they were cut out from old south park episode  its disgusting then copy and paste your freaking trees over and over having a invisible wall “I shouldn't walk in the woodlands”. 
Poor delivery of your media won't help your message. The message isn’t bad, its a message that should be brought to games more often about death, survival, human condition, suffering, and etc.

Everything was a story checklist nothing was off center.
1. linear story with missing context for interesting twist.
2. Leaving pieces of context through linear story  so its “all makes sense” 
3. The whole story is tragedy, tragic flaw discover in them self’s to answer to their sickness.  
  
The only good parts were when Alice went crazy and even then we are left no context of her past when  and why she is talking to a dude who mostly likely didn’t existed, some sort of ghost haunting her, reflecting her conscience to whatever then justify a mercy killing, she destroy part of herself/son tragical. Richard is underdeveloped its heavy on the fact of Alice since she takes of up the majority of the game but also we have five endings which don’t make a difference in their world its all the same gray message.

All aboard the feels train! This game really takes the post-apocalyptic setting and shows us how dark and gritty it is. Not by huge amounts of combat. It does it through it's characters, through the actions that the people who are trying to survive do. The story is great, the way we are served this story is even better. Piece by piece you uncover the truth. What brings down the enjoyment is the lack-luster gameplay (even for a point&click game) and the bad graphics. But despite these this is a fantastic piece of video game art I recommend.

I don't want to say much about the story because I feel that could ruin it. I actually wanted to know even more of the background! Just know that it's story is a little dark. The game is not a long game (maybe 3 hours), but this game is a high quality experience. R&A has multiple endings based on decisions making me want to eventually go back and play again once I ""kind of forgot"" some of the conversations. It would be a mistake to miss out on this game.

The graphics are good, but funny thing - personally I wanted more trees in the stage layouts! Weird nitpick I know, but at one point a character doesn't want to wander into the forest and I just felt it was a little too open. Made me chuckle. 

The music is good and sets the tone of each level. 

Richard & Alice is definitely worth the small asking price, especially if you're a fan of the genre. I recommended this game to a friend of mine who is also currently enjoying the experience. Submit your ticket and buy (in game joke)

특히 이야기를 풀어나감에 있어서 과거와 현재가 교차되는 방식이 인상깊었다. 그리고 말미로 갈 수록 현재와 과거가 만나게되고, 결국 두 스토리라인이 만날 때 이 이야기는 끝난다.
어쨌든 리처드&앨리스는 서양식 비주얼노블이라고 봐야할 것 같다. 그런 만큼 일러스트나 음성지원이 조금 아쉽긴 하지만 가능한 시스템 내에서 표현은 풍부하게 해주고 있다. 효과음이나 배경음악은 꽤 괜찮은 수준. 저렴한 가격에 책 한 권 사서 읽는다는 생각으로 플레이하면 꽤 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있을 것이다.

this is a very slow moving game for the pc the you tube video i found was for the ps4 (i think i cannot keep up with the versions lol) so was a bigger screen and movement was much more smoother and it seemed you could jump from place to place instead of trudging along...i personally like the story and it was on sale at humble bumble for 1.99 but do not pay more it is not worth more than a few bucks. it is relaxing but hard to see especially if your tired. which i am atm :p 
i am not sorry i got the game but man is it slow!!! this game is not for everyone...not artsy or has good ambiance it is click and play and figuring out what does what and pixilated to death reminds me of the early 90's....if this game had a much bigger picture i would recommend it...there is no way to make it full screen or even a bigger window i mean it is tiny about 2 in x 4 in....and that is tiny expecially for trying to read notes and dialogue. and alot of walking sloowly...sighs...if there is a demo try it 1st.

The premise for the story was unique, story driven adventure about two people trapped in a prison while endless winter raged quietly outside. It sounded fresh and interesting, I expected some well thought out dialogue, interesting puzzles and interesting stories. I was unfortunately let down. 

TLDR (the below paragraphs);

Cons: Boring, constantly diffuses it's own tension, questionable controls.
Pros: Art is nice, no game breaking glitches.

Unfortunately the game is just to compressed. Each chapter is only a handful of minutes long (however long it takes you to read through the dialogue) and are incredibly short winded. You would expect a game centered on character development to have large, meaty, dialogue chunks but it does not. Not only is the dialogue short, but it's so abrupt that the ideas and feelings the characters are expressing seem very alien. They dive right into delicate subject matter, without much more than an introduction. Pacing is key to story heavy games, and it's very out of whack in Richard&Alice.

Not only is the dialogue and story poorly paced, but it actively fights against it's own atmosphere. In a game that is set in the frozen collapse of humanity it's very boring. Nothing of much interest happens in Alice's narratives. IT's mostly a lot of walking around in the snow assuring your child things are alright. Anytime a potentially tense situation even threatens to rear it's head the game immediately diffuses it. As an example, the game blatantly points out people are fighting for food and shelter, killing each other for it. Yet you find a house with food abandoned, and are completely unbothered by outside forces for the duration of your stay. It's implied that people were there recently, and will likely return, but they never do (there's more to that, but that is a spoiler and still doesn't dismiss these issues). You are constantly on the edge of gang territory, but again you never see even a glimmer that they might even still be there. The constant diffusion of tension makes the game very boring, and lacking in content.

Lastly, this game would have benefited from some WASD controls. It's not a huge hassle to click places to walk, but clicking and then waiting idly for the character to walk is quite tedious. Even holding down a key would have helped to keep me from feeling so disconnected. I typically don't feel this way in point and click adventures, but in Richard&Alice it felt like the distances traveled were sometimes just a touch too long.

On the positive side, the art is pretty decent (but I like pixel art), and I never encountered any game breaking glitches.

TLDR;

Cons: Boring, constantly diffuses it's own tension, questionable controls.
Pros: Art is nice, no game breaking glitches.",1408058992,1408147550,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The world is facing a second ice age, one so severe it caused society to collapse. Our title characters have safety of sorts, living in a luxurious prison which was designed as a test shelter from the weather. Over the course of the game we learn how Richard and Alice came to be neighbors by experiencing the trials Alice went through before arriving in jail.

This story is well done, and the game has five endings. Based on spoilers none of them are happy, though some are happier than others. Seeing as how society has largely collapsed this shouldn't surprise you. The two endings I achieved were well done, but not different or strong enough to make me want to replay the game to obtain the others. It didn't help that you can only fast forward conversations, not movement or “dramatic pauses”. Lastly there were no strong decision points that stood out as changing how the story would end. 

Another contributing factor to why I don’t want to replay the game are the puzzles. They are straightforward tasks where you need to pick up one object to either combine with, or use on, another object. A couple were clever, but none really stood out as exciting. Add in the excessive amount of walking required for some tasks and they ended up testing my patience. 

As someone who doesn't normally play this type of game, but who enjoys a good story, I recommend buying this game on sale. The game was three hours well spent, the story is worth it even if the game play is lacking.

While a new ice age threatens most of the world, Richard is a prisoner in a relatively safe-seeming underground bunker.  Early on, a new prisoner arrives in the cell across the hall.  The player controls Richard through the parts that take place in the prison and Alice during the numerous flashbacks of her story.  These flashbacks are the meat of the game and serve to show both the world outside and, slowly, the reason for her incarceration.  There are a few choices here and there as well as a few puzzles, but these are slight and quickly solved.

A game like this lives and dies by its story, and that’s where Richard & Alice falls flat.  Without getting into spoilers, most of the plot twists are obvious from about ten minutes into the game when Alice enters her first flashback.  This deadens the impact of what should be highly emotional revelations late in the game.  There are also certain events that are never explained.  While this was done on purpose to heighten a sense of mystery, I found myself not caring or, at worst, thinking that those points would have made for a more interesting focus than the main story.
Richard & Alice has a handful of alternate endings based on choices made during the game.  This would seem to give it more replayability than, say, To the Moon.  However, the endings are mostly variants on the same theme.  For a player who was more into the story than I was, I could see where this might be interesting, but the slow pace of both the story and character movement made it more of a chore than it was worth.

Overall, I can’t say I regret having played Richard and Alice.  There was nothing particularly terrible about the writing and there were no noticeable bugs.  Its biggest sin is that I found it dull.  There is the core of an interesting story there and, oddly enough, I’d be interested in revisiting the world itself, I’d just rather leave both Richard and Alice in a snowdrift somewhere if I do.

I'm a sucker for short stories. They're usually clean, succinct, and leave you feeling satisfied at the very least. Richard & Alice did not disappoint. The developers took a topic that has come to be of slight concern as of recently -- environmental disasters -- and crafted a sometimes suspenseful, sometimes saddening tale about a mother, a son, and a prisoner. The story progresses nicely and its three or so hours of gameplay overall make for a nice way to spend your night if you enjoy these kinds of games.

Now, what I liked about it... As previously mentioned, it was a nice, quick game. The story drove itself relatively well and the small puzzles weren't particularly difficult, just occupying enough to keep you feeling involved. The point-and-click functions of the game are perfect in this aspect. I've found that some games stop themselves up with complicated puzzles and frustrating mechanics, but most of the puzzles in this game are easy to figure out and keep you thinking. The art style is perfect for the mood of the game and the pixelated graphics are just beautiful. The white noise of the snow properly maintained the cold, isolated mood most of the scenes in this game gives. The sections of suspense were played out relatively well. I feel like I don't have much to say, but once you play the game, you'll find that the upsides of the game are much more frequent and outweigh the downsides in relevance.

Downsides are few but not too far between. First, her walking speed. I didn't quite mind it, but I'm a very patient guy. In most sections of the game, her trudging pace felt perfect for the mood of the story, but there were several obstructively placed walls and a certain lake you couldn't walk around the top of which occasionally frustrated me. Next, the suspenseful bits weren't too built up and generally end up just being a ""What's over there?"" sort of thing. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these and the very last one in Alice's telling of her events is even anticipated by the character herself, allowing for that bit of association with the character the game tended to lack. Backstory on the characters is sparse; were a few scenes to be included concerning Richard or Alice's pasts or maybe a dollar DLC with an equally lengthy backstory session to be included, I'd love to indulge, but I was left hungry for more information on the characters. The price appeared rather harrowing at first, but I was graced with a 66% off coupon by a great friend and just used up some extra change I had from earlier transactions. While the game is still worth the price even without good friends with good coupons, I'd suggest you be sure you'd enjoy it before you purchase lest you end up with something you feel you've wasted time and money on. I for one will share with friends in some way or another. Oh, and the animal corpse. It mattered only once and ended up feeling way too pointless.

Firstly, it's set in a post apocalyptic world, but not the usual dry desert style we're used to, instead it is an icy snow covered world. Secondly, it has a female protagonist who, depending on your choices, will change and grow, while avoiding any dependence on a romance for her plot. And thirdly, it's multiple endings are based around not just a singular choice near the end, but a collection of choices through out the entire game.

The game will last about 3 hours for your first play though if you don't use a guide. More play throughs I can see as lasting 2 hours or less if you speed through dialogue to get to the choices. 

The audio is well done and suits the environments well.

The negatives? It can be frustrating looking for items or trying to figure out some of the puzzles on your first play through, especially if you want to simply continue the story. Some of the notes you find in the game can be hard to make out since they seem to be pictures of actual hand written notes.

All in all, I recommend it to anyone that wants a story driven point-and-click adventure with differing endings.

It's the world end. It keeps snowing and no one knows why or what to do about it. The game starts with Richard as a child talking to his father about the snowfall, then suddenly switches into years later with things having gone wrong for a longer time. Perspective changes between Richard & Alice who meet in a prison. She is guilty of murder, and he of treason/deserting. They comfort each other as best as they can, and Alice is telling Richard about what happened to her and her son Barney before she was imprisoned, while they have to deal with an increasingly uncomfortable situation inside their prison themselves.

The game is not bad per-se, but pretty small-scaled and short. There are only a few screens/places across your adventure. Most places are heavily snowed. Alice moves slowly through the snow. Logically according to the story background. You can either see this as an ambiance-strongening thing or as something to artificially increase the duration of the game. The puzzles are down-to-earth and not too challenging, but sometimes I had to walk across the different screens several times enduring Alice's slow movement, almost considering to just save at each place and load these savegames whenever I was wanting to investigate these places again (instead of walking all the way). One place vaguely hinted at with what is still recognizeable as a road/path I didn't realize I could visit until I looked up someone mention it on the internet. Perhaps it could have been made more clearly to go that direction. But I dare to consider myself just stupid and blind on one eye at that point.

You can sometimes choose between different dialogue options. Sometimes you can exhaust all dialogue options, sometimes one out of various or a certain one forces a situation to go on. This (and the slightly irritating conclusion of the story) may give some people incentive to do another playthrough, but you can very well just load previous savegames to read it all. 

There are a few strong emotional moments, though some aspects I was either irritated about or hardly understanding. Alice at one point says that her son was a strong, increasingly maturing kid. Yet I couldn't see much about that. It's the world end and he keeps singing and prancing around like it wouldn't mean much. I disliked Alice a bit for - in my opinion - shielding him too much from the harsh reality that was surrounding them. I am not sure if I would do the same if I had a child.

Another strong focus of the game aside from how people deal with bad situations is how the stories of Richard & Alice are connected. You don't get to hear much about Richard's previous doings until the very end. Some of it felt forced to me. I didn't understand some of the connections. In real-life it would be very unlikely for things to come together as they did in this game, to some point where one - or the characters - may almost start to believe in fate or god or whatever. I didn't understand the reason behind this prison to exist either. Richard gives some explanations but I didn't think I get the full picture. I didn't really unerstood how someone like Alice could get imprisoned in a world that has already gone to shit for a crime seemingly no one would prosecute. There are no visible authorities apart from some gangs, and as such this seemed somewhat constructed, artifical and hard to believe.

I think there could have been more to do with this game, in a less obscured way. I think it's not a bad experience, but considering it's shortness, seemingly somewhat flawed logic and not too taxing puzzling I guess I wouldn't recommend to buy it at it's full price. Neither those who love strong stories or to explore vast worlds (I think that's where I belong to) nor those who love hard and challenging puzzles will get too much from it.

Maybe I will understand a few things better when I'm reloading some certain savegames and check on some more info I missed, or by doing a second playthrough. I'm planning to. I don't want be harder on this game than what it deserves.

It is incredibly short for an adventure game, lasting only about three hours give or take. And that includes clicking on every object in the game and seeing the messages spewed forth. I would have loved to hear voice acting, but having played adventures since the ’80s I’m willing to overlook such an omission. Others, however, may see this as a major dealbreaker. If you can overlook this, though, you’ll find a gripping tale of loss, heartbreak, and emotions that run rampant. And the multiple endings (about four in all) show just what a person is willing to do to stay alive in a place that couldn’t care less what happens to you.

If I plunge forth with my typical double-fisted, pull-no-punches Steam Review vitriol, a developer will no doubt respond and be very civil and infect me with Sh­ithead's Remorse. However, if I soften the laser-focused, razor-sharp barbs of my serpent's cybertongue - making it ""constructive"" criticism, if you will - they may just mark the review as ""helpful"" and offer no further comment, hence leaving me open to accusations of being a ""sellout"" with no easy rebuttal. Hence, this hand-wringing introductory paragraph which hopefully is even more of a tedious chore to read than it was to type. Anyway, trigger warnings: Constructive Criticism, lack of excessively brutal cyberdunks and net.owns.

In an age of everlasting betas, this game stands out as an ironic example of a game that could really stand a final coat of paint before being shoved out the door. The story is mildly captivating (though both ""twists"" were readily predictable by the fifth game-day or so), but the script is pretty rough and could stand to be re-edited once more. Maybe English baby formula contains mercury or extra lead or something, but no American 5 year old would be quite this, er, saccharine. Even if artificial syrupy sweetness was the intent, there's still more effective ways to capture the hyperactivity of youth than ""la-la-la, tra-la-la"" repeated three or four times in a row. Characters in this game tend to speak in tangents, rather than as people - again, this may or may not be part of the post-apocalyptic intent, but if it's the intent, the dialogue should still be punched up a bit and made a bit less stiff and clinical. The script feels like the words someone would use in a script, rather than either natural dialogue or natural writing - one or the other would be the way to go.

Leaving the script aside, the ""game"" itself could also stand a brief ""final revision"". I typically don't mind a bit of backtracking here and there, but when the backtracking involves clicking multiple times on a huge scrolling screen, waiting for the droopy little character to trundle across before the screen scrolls enough to click again, it gets extremely tedious extremely quickly (to say nothing of the incessant CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH sound of the character in question walking through packed snow). A cardinal rule of adventure games is to try to keep each scene on a single screen if at all possible. I appreciate that the developers wanted to capture a bit of distance, but zooming the perspective out to an ""overworld map"" style would be so much better than depicting an entire ""neighborhood"" at the same scale as a single prison room. There's absolutely nothing ""interesting"" in between point A and point B that warrants such close zoom - no background fluff to click on and get a cute little scene-building dialogue reaction, and of course nothing particularly interesting to look at.

Finally, the story itself is ""told"" in a labyrinthine mix of tangent-dialogue, soliloquies [violating the Show Don't Tell Principle, but ehhh], and scraps of paper / journal entries which are presented rather non-linearly; confusing to form a narrative from and quite easily forgotten. This impacts the ending somewhat, as it makes it pretty hard to figure out exactly why the various characters in the ending emphasize the little details they do. I'm not someone who demands compact, simple, everything-explained scripts (for instance, I quite like how the game left a certain element - which those have played it can no doubt guess - pretty much a zen ""so, this happened"") - but, on the other hand, figuring out the various in-world factions, and the various characters within those factions, and what said factions did to other factions, and the little dramas and personal conflicts in between said factions, is pretty critical to understanding the ending beyond a surface-level ""oh, yeah, this guy was a _____, I knew that was coming since the midpoint"" -- but figuring that stuff out involves piecing together a handful of paper scraps and non-linear breadcrumbs. 

So basically what you're left with is a moderately interesting setting, some random Adventure Game Style Puzzles (USE [INVENTORY] ON [BACKGROUND ITEM], ad infinitum), and some decent atmospheric music all brought down by a heavy-handed ""rough draft"" script, tedious backtracking, and characters who - mostly as a result of the unpolished script - are pretty hard to give a sh­it about one way or the other. If one digs a bit, there's easily the makings of a game worth $5.99 here, but what's on display isn't that game.",1404234762,1404235530,False,46,0,0.588812708854675293,1,False,False,False,False,,,

There's both good and bad points and overall, I can't recommend it.

Alright, let's get the bad done with.
The walking is terribly slow for such a big map, I dreaded getting to a point where I had to walk. I understand why the map is big I guess, it needs it for the story, to show the wasteland off. But it was very hard to get through the walking without wanting to do something else.
The story isn't so great. It is a really good concept, a wasteland of snow, the world coming to an end, but I don't think we saw enough. We didn't know much about the gangs, we didn't get much story from Alice's early predicament (before the game advanced a bit). It just seemed to lack a little, as I feel did the characters personalities.
The gameplay. It was difficult to know what to do, this is one of the games where you click everything together and hope for the best, at one point I had to bring up a walkthrough. Of course there are many people that enjoy this kind of game, but I seemed a bit too lost for most of it. Also, during the game you pick up notes and stuff to make the overall story, but I couldn't piece it together. I was very confused by the end as all these names were thrown around but couldn't link them.

Good bits!
It's beautiful and emotional. The art style is pretty and a lot of it reminds me of To The Moon. You can tell a lot's been put into this game and I can see people really enjoying it.

In my case, the good bits are a lot smaller than the bad bits, but that's just what I picked out.

Richard & Alice will take around 3 hours to complete, so if you have money to spare and nothing else better to do, sure, why not, go play it, otherwise there is nothing new to see here.

And that was the main problem with it. It felt as dull and monotonous as the snowy landscapes featured in all of Alice's scenes.

The game itself is pretty simplistic. The puzzles aren't that complicated but they are logical which is unusual for a lot of point-and-click games. It is an exercise in patience to get anywhere in the game when you're controlling Alice however. The world is much more expansive for her and she walks so slowly that you spend a lot of time watching her shuffle over white background with some sticks sticking out of it. And when you have to go back and forth between two locations, it gets ridiculously frustrating.

The story itself...it's very eh. I've seen it before. It's cliche and you can call it from the very beginning. Even the multiple endings aren't that original. It's bleak, it's depressing but there's no shock to it. And there's no emotion in it. You don't get very invested in it.

Most other games that try to tackle the same ideas--death, murder, loss, religion, freedom, and others--do so as such: shooty-shooty bang-bang ""Am I on the right side?"" shooty-shooty ""idk lol"" bang ""oh well"". Over the course of R&A, death and murder are present but each and every one is treated with the weight that it deserves. The dead have personalities, families, and a lasting impression on the living; the murderers are not bloodthirsty maniacs, but realistic people with complex motives who've made both good and bad decisions--many of which could more accurately be described as ""grey area"" decisions.

Unfortunately, a lot of the dialogue doesn't break as much new ground, nor is it as polished or as engaging. Often, a note or diary you find in the game's world will be more interesting than the (great deal of) dialogue between Richard, Alice, and the rest of the supporting characters. Though their history and actions make both Richard and Alice complex individuals, their dialogue is on the whole a bit bland. Perhaps this is part of the point; perhaps they interact with one another in a fairly generic way in order to show that even people who do very good or very bad things are, at their core, just like everyone else. ""The banality of evil."" But even if this is the case, the relationship between the titular characters felt forced and very boy-girl, teen drama to me, with obvious and eye-rolling ""subtle"" romantic undertones.

Most tragically of all, many of the game's most interesting moments take place not during the first 95%, but across the game's five different endings. All of these endings require a full new playthrough to reach (and as such, so do five of the game's achievements), which on the second through fifth playthrough will take you less than the initial three hours or so--my playthroughs lasted roughly thirty to forty minutes, clicking rapidly through dialogue I'd already read--but still grate on the nerves as you solve the same puzzles over and over. This isn't necessary, of course, but it is if you want to see the most interesting dramatic moments the game has to offer.

As for the puzzles, they are on the whole fairly good. They're not impossible, nor are they too easy (with the exception of one fairly obtuse puzzle near the middle of the game, involving a [spoiler] home-made bomb[/spoiler]). They are somewhat small in number, because the story is the focus of the game.

On the whole, I enjoyed myself. I welcome more story-driven games like this one, and more games that lend complex issues the same weight they have received in the best books and films. But Richard and Alice is a step in this good direction; its dialogue, more than anything else, stops it from arriving there entirely.

The world has frozen over, obliterating civilization and government, leaving anyone but the highest up to fend for themselves in a world that has gone completely to hell. But deep underground, Richard lives out his life in a well outfitted prison, away from the horror that humanity has become, watching nature documentaries and contacting the guards through his personal computer when something breaks or he’s in need of assistance. If it wasn’t for the iron bars confining him, it would almost seem a rather pleasant place to wait out the cold. The only thing possibly missing, is someone, anyone to talk to, and as if summoned by a support ticket Alice appears in the cell opposite him. If only things were as simple as they appear.

Richard and Alice isn’t the story it first appears to me. Behind the easygoing life the inmates of this peculiar prison seem to live, incredible amounts of despair and heartbreak are pressing at the gate, eating away at the humanity of those who have to bare with the insanity that has brought the world to the brink of almost complete desertion. There are no heroes or villains in this tale; there are simply people, trying their hardest to survive in the midst of impossible odds, doing whatever it takes to live another day despite how meaningless it may seem.

Parallels can be drawn between Richard and Alice and literary masterpieces such as The Road, and certainly it isn’t a premise that we haven’t seen done before (to varying degrees of effect). What makes Owl Caves’s take on it unique, especially in a medium that rarely attempts (let alone succeed at), is the unprecedented level of humanity in its characters and the skill at which they so eloquently explore the darkest side of us in a way that’s neither heavy handed or moralizing. This isn’t a story that is trying to make you believe in something; to show what’s right and wrong, with infallible characters that ultimately make the right choice.

On the contrary, Richard and Alice is fascinating [i]because[/i] it never chooses a side or try to make you see some presumed moral truth. Its characters are flawed individuals, doing terrible things that from the outside seem almost inhuman. But can we truly say that when forced into a corner with no alternatives, we too wouldn’t shed our morality and do whatever it takes to survive, rationalizing it however we must to keep from tearing ourselves apart from the inside? Richard and Alice is a shameless look at the animals we all become when forced under pressure, and it’s shocking not because of incredible amounts of violence or grotesque situations, but because we know deep down that we are all capable of such atrocities.

It’s hard to say if I actually “enjoyed” Richard and Alice. It’s an incredibly bleak adventure that at times is hard to stomach from how emotionally taxing just being such a hopeless world is, let alone what occurs within it. It’s not a “fun” game (or really much of a game at all in many ways), but it is an immensely well crafted experience that does more with less than a handful of characters in just a few hours, than most games ever manage. It’s a captivating character study, that absorbed me from the second I set foot inside Richard’s extravagant cell up until its undecided ending, which leaves just enough unanswered to keep you wondering and filling in the gaps yourself. Some might say its lazy storytelling, but to me it was the only possible way to end a story that was never going to have a happy or finite conclusion. After all, the world is still turning, and humanity along with it, through the best and worst of times.
