My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

There's a welcome depth to the game mechanics as you scan planets, dispatch probes, trade and ally with various factions and so on.  But where it falls down is in a series of very poor game design decisions.  Most of the game interface is just clicking through various menus and things like an interactive web game.  There's golf-swing minigames and so on as well, which clash with the whole idea of piloting a spaceship and exploring the galaxy... thematically these elements just don't sit properly together.

One important note is that even though this is an amateur project, it does seem to be sincerely and genuinely made.  I couldn't find any flipped assets, plagiarism or any other kind of insincere actions from the developer, but unfortunately ethical behaviour and genuine intentions alone are not enough to produce a brilliant gaming experience.

The first thing that will strike anyone seriously trying to play this is just how clunky, confronting and obtuse the user interface is.  Standard UI conventions aren't followed, and because the majority of the ""gameplay"" here is conducted by clicking through menus, not getting those perfect is a death knell for this kind of game.

The game doesn't have any save game features, despite that being a basic standard for all games of this time.  The developer might defend this as an attempt to make the game seem more ""difficult"" without them having to balance the game or do their job properly with engaging and challenging level design, but it's just as likely they simply couldn't work out how to make a save game feature work.  Either way, that's a defect that adds another reason for gamers to avoid this game.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  The planet Earth almost looks like a D20.  I feel bad for anyone who has to fly around on that planet, avoiding all the hard edges.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Project Tarvotan is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

Wir bewegen also auf einer Sternenkarte unser Raumschiff von Planet zu Planet und geben Anweisungen. Spielmechanisch funktioniert das alles praktisch rundenbasiert. Bei jeder Aktion sollten wir auch unseren Treibstoff und unseren Sauerstoff beachten, die verbraucht werden. Zudem können wir auch Aufträge ausführen. 

Grundsätzlich scheint das Spiel interessant. Zumindest das Setting ist spannend. Und auf den ersten Blick scheint auch die Umsetzung passend. Die Sonnensysteme schauen einigermaßen passabel aus. 

Schnell allerdings bemerkt man, daß das Spiel in der technischen Umsetzung einige grundlegende Probleme hat. Es wirkt wie eine frühe Alpha-Version, wie ein unfertiges Produkt, bei dem es nicht nur an Optimierung fehlt, sondern auch einige Dinge schlichtweg fehlen. Die Mechaniken sind reichlich umständlich und auf den ersten Blick undurchsichtig. Das bemühte Text-Tutorial hilft da kaum weiter. Absolut absurd wird es dann, wenn man feststellt, daß man das Spiel praktisch nicht speichern kann.

首先让我们来谈谈游戏的画面。虽然画风独特，但是它的画面质量并不能让人满意。游戏中的角色和环境都显得十分粗糙，而且细节处理不到位。对于一款独立游戏来说，这样的画面表现实在是不敢恭维。

接下来我们来看看游戏的玩法。这是一款动作冒险游戏，玩家需要控制一个可爱的机器人角色在游戏中探索、解谜和战斗。然而游戏的操作手感却十分糟糕。按键布局不合理，导致我在游戏中经常出现操作失误。而且游戏的战斗系统也十分单调，让我很快就失去了兴趣。

此外游戏的剧情和人物设定也是一大败笔。我发现游戏中的对话不仅枯燥无味，而且逻辑不通。这让我很难对游戏中的角色产生共鸣，也无法投入到游戏的故事中去。

最后我想谈谈游戏的优化问题。我在游玩过程中遇到了许多卡顿和bug，严重影响了我的游戏体验。这些问题不仅出现在PC平台上，甚至在手机上也无法顺利运行。这让我对开发团队的诚意产生了怀疑。

综上所述，游戏并没有达到我对独立游戏的高期待。它的画面粗糙、操作糟糕、剧情乏味，优化问题也十分严重。我建议各位玩家在购买这款游戏之前，一定要三思而后行。对于喜欢独立游戏的朋友来说，这款游戏可能会让你失望。",1634497205,1711316438,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As a fan of strategy games, I thought I would give this game a try. Not all strategy games play alike and that is not a bad thing. In fact, its a distinguishing feature of the genre. For no other purpose but to create a catchy hook to this review, I want to compare strategy games to cakes. Yes, delicious, sugary, scrumptious cakes. Cakes, just like strategy games, are made up of some core ingredients. The basic ingredients of cake are flour, eggs, and sugar.  That's all you need to make cake. Strategy games also have core ingredients such as offering the player the ability to respond and adapt to situations while balancing certain requirements. No two cakes are alike in the same way that no two strategy games are alike. The whistles and the thrills we attach to our favorite cake are different just like the components a game developer can utilize to create a good strategy game are different. All this to say, Project Tarvotan is a game that succeeds on some ingredients whereas other ingredients could have used a bit more time cooking in the oven.

[b]Overview of Presentation[/b]
For those who just want the short and sweet of it, this game exceeds at visually creating a unique image for itself. No computer is going to have a hard time visually displaying this game at its highest setting, but the visuals create a unique atmosphere that gives the game identity. I would go as far as saying that Project Tarvotan has the most beautiful game over screen I have ever seen in any video game. The gameplay music compliments the visuals and helps immerse the player into the environment of space. The User Interface is rather simple which I think is a bit of detractor. It also might take the user a bit of time to figure out what exacty is what on the screen. The developers have added the option to play the tutorial which helps a bit. 

[b]Overview of Gameplay[/b]
This is a turn-based strategy game through and through. I found myself having a lot of freedom to pick and choose a play-through style. I think that is one of the better things Project Tarvotan is good at. Most of the gameplay involves choosing where to navigate and what to do once you get there to best help you balance your science, fuel, materials, and such. Beyond the Milky Way, I think most of the solar systems are fictitious, but the maps are interactive. In the Milky Way, the sun expands swallowing up planets forcing you to navigate only outward. Other planets have different environmental elements that force the user to adapt their strategy to fit the solar system.  As I mentioned before, there are a few things that I think could have been given a little more polishing up. For example, we are asked if we want to accept a quest but there is really no reason why we would ever not want to accept a quest. This is especially odd since we are never told what the quest is before we are given the option to accept it. Another complaint I have is that the combat system is relatively simple and not very engaging. However it is a game that deals more in strategy than it does in action, so that is where the true fun of this game lies. The technologies you unlock are a bit lackluster in character and diversity. None the less, this game is worth a try in spite of these flaws. Its a good game to go back to because you know that no one play-through is going to be the same. To me, its not a game that I am going to spend hours and hours playing in a row, but it is one that I can see myself coming back to time and time again just to see what new challenges I will have to face and adapt to.",1446779298,1446779298,True,22,6,0.600865721702575684,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Each time, I'd go back to the game, thinking I should give it another chance before I asked for a refund. Each time my experience was worse than the last. The more I learned, the more I disliked what I saw.

Then I realized that I've spent too much time both on this review and on the game. Time I'll never get back.

It's simply a bad game. Move along; nothing to see here.

Barely worthy of Early Access, let alone a full launch.

There are some interesting ideas at play (which is why I bought it in the first place), but after playing nearly an hour, all I can think of is ""that's an hour of my life I'll never get back"".

I wanted to like it, the concept is definitely interesting, but the execution is simply terrible. Tutorial barely worthy of the name, horrid combat, unresponsive UI. Just bad design overall.

From someone who loves strategy and simulation games: stay away.

I feel a game should grip you/capture your attention straight from the beginning, and Project Tarvotan does the exact opposite of that. Maybe it gets better? Perhaps this would be my GOTY of 2015 if I gave it more of a chance, but I guess I'll never find out.

Time to go ask for that refund.",1443326647,1443326647,False,52,2,0.393082529306411743,9,True,False,False,False,,1448767253.0,"I appreciate that you took the time to play our game, whether or not you enjoyed the experience, as I do with all Steam gamers that give our small team a chance out of the thousands of other titles available.

After reading the comments to this review I feel there is a lot of constructive feedback to be found.  I ask to the reviewer and any commenters to please contact me with any concerns you may have with Project Tarvotan.  I will address them and work with my partner to make the game as good as it can be.  Thank you all for your time and interest!"

I have to say that I really like how unique this game feels. I felt like I could explore so much in the several solar systems that you can travel through. There are so many things to interact with and to learn and do. The game felt really unique and looked really nice for an indie-game.

I recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in space, or for those who are looking for a cool space-themed adventure with strategy and exploration.",1443218069,1443218069,True,9,5,0.359191000461578369,0,False,False,False,False,,,
