而我上次在2018年那个时候则根本没有后面两种主题，而且方块经常不够搭，很难玩。
现在确实有很大的进步，但是
[h1]目前的版本仍然存在一些严重的 BUG 以及影响体验的问题，例如：[/h1]
1. 角色不能正确解锁。结算界面显示解锁的角色，实际可能仍然不能使用。比如 Ghost，我已经在结算界面看到解锁了两次，但是依然没有解锁。
2. 金币数量没有显示。虽然我可以看到获得了很多金币，但是我没有找到金币在哪里花，也无法看到已获得的金币数量。这让我无法确定前面提到的问题究竟是因为数据没有存上，还是因为显示有误。
3. 已解锁的角色仍然能出现在地图上、能反复解锁。初始的角色【Business Man】【Business Woman】我都不记得解锁过多少次了，真的刷烦了，我想解锁新角色。
4. 键位只能使用规定的几个预设，不能自由设定。但是这也有一个缓解手段，那就是使用 AutoHotKey 来自定义键位。比如我就喜欢用小键盘7键来捡起和放下方块，小键盘4键旋转方块。分享一下我的 AHK 代码：
Numpad7:: Send(""{K}"")	; 捡起 右手食指
Numpad4:: Send(""{L}"")	; 旋转 右手食指下一格",1686410863,1686410863,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,True,,,

I really hope this game gets some more work done to it as it looks like it could amount to a real cracker.
Only bug we found was once on a game against each other the ball dropped beyond the screen, but you know what, we just went ahead and started another game and we were back to laughing our heads of again.
Good, old fashioned madness with great graphics, quick and easy to learn gameplay. 

I really, really hope this is a big game as it holds a ton of potential. I can't wait for a couple more mates to come round and we can have some 4 player madness trying to score a basket whilst also trying to launch a rocket at each other all the while dodging zombies.

It was really fun, especially with multiple people.

Basically there are 2 modes as it were. Apocalypse and ""Sports"" mode.

""Sports"" mode basically involves either basket ball or some kind of collection/ capture the flag type game. It's actually quite fun for what it is, but it requires people to really make it something special.

Apocalypse mode is one that see's you and your friends trying to survive 1 of 2 world ending scenarios. A meteor and a zombie pandemic. Each features a barrier that will OHKO any players that are too slow to complete the level. Both level types requre players to use tetrominos to build bridges or platforms to advance. The goal is to reach the Helicopter and fly to safety. 

 In the Meteor level the barrier comes in the form of laval. This level is verticle so you'll be doing a lot of climbing. Occasionally small meteors will drop from the sky and strike the stage. 1 hit will kill you. 

The Zombie level features a wave of destructive energy advancing from the right side to the left. The main obsticles are the Zombies. every time you brush against one they take a bite out of you until you're dead. Use tetrominos to block them off and advance towards the helicopter. 


For a party game it's great, but on the same token that is it's weakness. You really want to play with friends to get the most out of it. It's also pretty liniear, once you've played the levels it's all pretty much the same. I do hope they come out with more vairence in the future. Having different Apocalypse scenarios would be a great start as I feel that is where the game shines most. It would also be really cool if characters had special attributes of some kind. As of now they're only skins and they all behave the same way, even if they are refferential in nature. An element like that could elivate the way the game is played, especially for the basketball game mode (sort of like a super mario strikers lite). 

Anyway, the game is good as of writing and I look forward to seing more people pick up the game.",1502584525,1502584525,True,3,0,0.526315808296203613,0,False,False,True,False,,,

这个游戏没有手柄真不推荐

键盘操作,游戏不能改键,键盘操作非常别扭,一只手按不过来,两只手太别扭.

联机模式里:动不动会出现看不到联机的其他玩家或者是整个建筑,导致bug

还有一点,游戏默认是全音量声音,真的是耳朵都要炸了.

游戏内容整体来说就是板砖的如何不被岩浆淹死的游戏,总体就是无脑往高处跑啊跑.

撕比是可以,但是游戏内部的元素太少了,不推荐.

而且就这么点内容的游戏还处于阿尔法测试版本,不值得掏钱!

Blockpocalypse is a platform-based game deliberately trying to look like something designed for the NES littered with pop culture references and unique characters.

Blockpocalypse is the story of a post apocalyptic lava world after a grimacing asteroid collides with the planet. There are four game modes where you and other payers either work together to build ever higher in order to evade rising lava, work in teams to score baskets, fight as individuals to maintain control of cake or simply throw each other off platforms into pools of lava. 

One thing that comes across is while all the game modes are simplistic and the graphics unassuming there is great enjoyments to have, as the skills are easy to learn but difficult to master. 

On the whole it is an engaging game in which a rudimentary core game play is used with a surprising degree of variety without compromising its simplicity.
