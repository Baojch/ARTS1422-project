[b]Outline:[/b] I was gifted this game by my best friend not long before he died. A few years on and I've finally brought myself to play it, and needless to say I wanted to love it, just for that fact...
 
But sadly, Orion Trail is a bare bones, fairly unimaginative Oregon Trail clone, with a deceptively slick graphical skin. Yes, the art is great and there's some solid writing and gags, but that's about it. The game is thin on gameplay. It's essentially all RNG based. There is no strategy to puzzle over. A drinking bird could play the game perfectly effectively. Which, I might add, will come in handy for those of you who'd like to 100% the game, as there are some ludicrously nonsense achievements of the 'artificial life extension' variety. Of both the luck based and grind based varieties. You can see, more or less, everything the game has to offer in under a dozen games. Which is roughly a few hours. But the 100% will take many, many more. Technically, depending on your luck, infinite.

[b]Verdict:[/b] Despite my issues, I give this game a soft recommendation due to what it does well. The writing and presentation. If you're not a 100% freak and you just fancy spending the odd 15 minutes on a funny 'trail' game with a sci-fi twist. It's decent enough. Though maybe on sale.

Managing resources largely falls on conserving food and fuel to make it to the end of a level whereas the emphasis on crew and ship hull don't nearly play as big a part.

Slightly modifying this is that the various choices have different rewards for success and penalties for failure. If you’re very low on food, it might make sense to make a die roll with a food reward, even if the odds are lower than the die roll giving you fuel. In practice, though, that’s unusual, and 95% of the time you just pick the choice with the highest die-roll bonus.

The net result is that most games consist of just picking the highest number over and over until you win or you lose.

Your crew gives your ship different advantages that may or may not be valuable in your adventure where you will be faced with a number of obstacles including revolting replicators, space traffic jams, and nutri-paste disasters.

Orion Trail offers a lot of replayability. Some of the later missions are tricky, and if the dice rolls are not in your favor a few times, you may find yourself failing the mission more than once.

As it's obvious from the name and the graphics, this game is an homage to both the original Star Trek series and the ancient, legendary computer game called Oregon Trail.

You are to assemble the crew of your starship (you get to recruit the captain and the officers, then distribute some points among the 4 attributes of the ship: number of ""red shirt"" crew, food, fuel, hull), then complete a mission by travelling through the star map to reach a star base at the other end. The route is quite linear with an occasional branching that are always joined, but as you don't really have any means to plan ahead and there's hardly any difference between the route branches except from some flavor text and graphics, it's basically just a corridor of random encounters.

At the beginning of a game session you get to choose a mission, but as it turns out, the only difference between these is the number of ""stops"", that is, how many guaranteed random event you'll encounter. I have been able to complete all missions except for the last one, which is so long and tedious, that after the tenth attempt or so I've simply given up and accepted that I'll probably never see the ""well done, you have completed this game"" farewell message.

As for the encounters, most of them is a brief ""choose your own adventure"" style chain of events, and the rest just modify a random skill or attribute to some degree. In an ""adventure"" you are usually offered 2--4 choices which are based on the various skills of the crew (e.g. combat, bravado, science, etc.), and sometimes it's indicated which ship attribute or crew skill is going to be affected as the outcome both as a gain and a loss. Now, here comes the most frustrating mechanics of the game, the random number generator, which decides if the result of your choice is (1) a critical failure, (2) a normal failure, (3) a normal success, or (4) a critical success. In theory the tested skill affects your chance, but in practice this is still just way too random with very little room for any kind of tactical decision.

If you're a fan of Star Trek, and this game is on a significant sale, it might be worth getting it, just to have a giggle or two, but be prepared that when I said ""way too much is left to random chance"", I meant exactly that.",1531656786,1531656786,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The core gameplay is basic, jump between nodes and handle the event that takes place.

I do wish there where some more mechanics to mitigate some of the RNG. But there are some strategys to help you out that you realize after playing a few rounds. The other gameplay elements are away missions where you send one of your officers on a planet and they have to pass a few skillchecks by themselves (and by using redshirts as a resource, i think you can guess how if you know your star trek...).

After my last review from another oregon trail-like game, i jumped over this game and thought i also should give it a fair try...and yea, i actually really ""tried"" to give this game a chance but no....a very very sad no.

[h1]Not really a ""game""[/h1]
TBH, there is actually not much you can do in this game. Its also more ""unfair luck"" based then anything else. I mean you choose your level you wanna play, crew+captain, beginning mats (food, fuel, etc) aaaaand thats it. there is no ""hunt for food"" minigame or like. The only thing you do is actually stare on the starmap, see your ship fling (if it has the fuel...) from one planet to another aaaaaaaaaaaaaannnd maybe go on those ""away missions""....which make no fun, really, no fun at all.

[h1]The ""main hub""[/h1]
As i already said, the most time you look at the starmap, looking your ship fling from one planet to the next one. At each planet, something will happen, mostly negative for you. How does this event look like? [b]Luck based ""Spin the wheel"" actions.[/b] Really, you cant do anything and its pur luck, mostly bad luck tbh. To explain this action: ""the wheel"" has 4 kind of fields it can land on. Critical miss, miss, ok, critical ok. The whole wheel begins mostly with all fields as [b]MISS[/b]+ 1 of each critical ok and miss. As more of the status the chraracter has of the action you ""spin"" the wheel for, as sample its a attacking action and you have 3 in it, 3 of the miss fields turn into a ""ok"" feld. Still, those events feel like [b]WAY[/b] to much luck based and [b]youre always in the disadvantage[/b]. I mean you might need to play it for yourself what i mean but there is nothing else. You choose a action, the wheel spins, you ""mostly"" lose, thats it.

[h1]The ""away"" missions...[/h1]
Let me begin straight here that i can say: [b]I HATE THEM.[/b]
Why you might ask? Let me explain them in short:

- Insteed of all 4 crew members stats for the wheel spin, you only have 1 crew member with [b]very very VERY limited[/b] stats (mostly maybe 3 stat  points...) which makes the wheel looks like [b]a total ""hate"" against your player. totally.[/b]

-As i said, the spinning wheel for the actions starts just with 1 field critical ok here and for the away missions [b]the most for the time is the full wheel negative, just 1-2 felds (from 10-12!) are a prositive outcome in total.[/b]

- You [b]WILL[/b] lose some peoples from your crew. really, there is no way around it it will [b]NOT[/b] happen then avoiding those ""away missions"" at the very beginning.

I know that should be a fun part from the game but its way to much luck based and if the Wheel looks like this (kinda)

Critical Miss**, Miss*, One Guy dies, One Guy dies, One Guy dies, One Guy dies, Critical Win
Miss*, Miss*, One Guy dies, One Guy Dies, One Guy dies, One Guy dies, Critical Win

Do you think those are ""fun""~?
*IF you hit a miss on away missions you mostly lose more than 1 guy

[b]I dont recomment this game, not in the slightest at least in this state.[/b] Its way to much luckbased, you always feel in the disadvantage, way to much negative stuff happens over the prositve stuff, NO ""hunting"" Minigame or like just plain ""choose a action and spin the wheel in hope something good (coughs...) happens"" and in total, [b]it feels like the game hates you for playing it.[/b] I played now a lot oregon trail-like games on steam but this one is, so far, the worst made. It makes not really fun to play, even if the events and dialoge maybe should make you smile but again, you sit only there, spin the wheel of hell in hope you win with a low winning chance. Sure if you have a character with one high stat you might be able to win this spin if you have the choise for the right action but if not, well, ""then NOT"". Really, i want something to do and not only sitting there, feeling all the time in the disadvantage in hope god gives me some hamburgers so that my crew survives the next ride to the next planet. I really cant recomment this game, not in this state which actually is sad since it looked like a good game for me...

However in all the wrong places. 
Now I love these types of games, I loved the original ""Oregon Trail"" back in the day and I also love the outstanding ""Organ Trail"" and the pretty good Interstellaria... This game is, however, is a mere shadow of those.  

The writing is fantastic, I mean the sci-fi banter and references are right on the mark,  the jokes come quick and some far out of the left field.
The writing is very reference driven but if you like sci-fi and read and watch a lot of genre-related media you will enjoy this very much. 
10 out of 10 for writing 

The graphics are awesome too, the pixel art is beautiful and a lot of time has been spent on this and it is also fantastic. 
10 out of 10 for artwork 

The music is even great and rocking, the music gets you right in the mood to explore space and reach your goal. 
Even though there are only 4 tracks that just loop repeatedly, it is still good. 
5 out of 10 for music

Gameplay... 
Oh dear, this is where everything comes crashing down.
The game has no gameplay, you just click on options then watch a dice roll and then you either win or fail, this is not fun, this is just repetitive and dull, a meer time waster. 
The game if one can call it that has no gameplay, everything you do is random, it does not matter how high your stats are it's just random.  
Also, the game takes too much away from you with no pit stops to regain anything.
This game is an annoying mess, and I never felt like I accomplished anything through skill, it was all luck.
-100 out of 10 for gameplay. 

I will quickly explain this luck problem... You see you will come to a planet or star or whatever then be given a scenario which you get three outcomes to choose from.
You choose an outcome, then the game visualises a dice roll for you, called 'The Probability Drive', that should, in theory, give you an outcome based on your skill level of the stat scenario you chose.
such as if I had level 7 Science that should give me a higher percentage of winning that scenario.    
However, no matter your stats or skill level the dice roll is just random.

At one point in the game I had Level 9 Bravado skill, however, I lost five scenarios even though logically I should have beaten all if not four of them.
I genuinely believe this mechanic in the game is broken, and the developers don't know how broken it is, or they just cannot be bothered to fix it.         

Furthermore, there is a lack of gameplay elements to stay engaged and invested in the game. 
If the game included some mini-games when you reach a space station like in ""Organ Trail"" I could forgive it. 
Like I said at the beginning a lot of work was put into this game, however, in all the wrong places, graphics and artwork gooooood, Writing and jokes gooooood, gameplay and mechanics baaaaaad.   

This could have been an amazing game, one of the best games of its kind, but it feels half-arsed slap-dashed together and spruced up to make it look pretty... A turd painted gold. 
I would much rather a bad looking game that was fun and engaging than a game that looked fabulous and played like garbage, unfortunately, this game falls into the latter. 

So, unfortunately, I have to give it thumbs down.

There's not a great deal of complex gameplay and it mostly just boils down to basic management and decision making along with some dice rolls.  Orion Trail isn't necessarily a re-skin, but as the name implies, the game is quite similar.  You will still be making choices and you'll definitely be at the whim of dice rolls, but it ties it all together in an entertaining package that separates itself from other games with the same idea.

[h1]So, dysentery right?[/h1]

You may not have your fourth child dying of dysentery on this trip, but Orion Trail does deliver plenty of hazards for you to encounter and potentially (most likely) fail miserably in trying to overcome.  The game starts you out by selecting four crew members with various stats that, for most of the game, are added to a pool.  After you stock up on supplies including fuel, food, crew, and ship armor, you set out on your trip across one of the maps that unlock linearly – but each can be revisited for later runs.  Each map is longer than the last and has more stops you'll need to make to reach the goal.  At these stops, one of a number of events will trigger that requires you to pick one reaction.  Each reaction is associated with a particular stat and will give you a certain reward (usually resources) at the risk of another resource.  You have to decide whether to pick a reaction that gives you a resource you need, or doesn't risk a resource you're low on, as well as one that you have a high corresponding stat in.  When you reach the 'dice roll,' here presented as a “Probability Drive,” each stat point counts toward the chances of victory.  If the Probability Drive lands on one of those, you are successful.  This sort of gameplay makes up the bulk of the game.  At times you may reach a location that allows you to send an away crew comprise of one of your chosen four officers (usually the one with the best stats) and a portion of your crew.  These situations allow you to risk the officer and crew members to potentially get more resources and crew in the process doing the same choice/roll loop.  You can return to the ship and move on with enough resources to breeze through the rest of the map or lose practically everything and limp along until your inevitable failure.  Sometimes it's best just to skip them altogether... but where's the fun in that?

[h1]Calibrate the shields for Disappointment Rays...[/h1]

While the game is simple and enjoyable, it is reliant on a couple of core components that can be a bit annoying after a while.   The first is the RNG of it all.  I think in the past, gamers in general were more acceptant of RNG.  The original Oregon Trail was filled with it.  The difference being of course that you couldn't see it in front of your face like a roulette wheel.  However, no matter how you look at it, when you shift probability in your favor, it's hard to accept losing and suffering for it.  It makes it seem like the player has really limited control in a game centered around choices.  The other part that eventually let me down is that the number of events that I came across is limited.  On maybe the second or third trail I did, I even hit the same exact event twice in that run.  I've seen several things across the maps repeatedly.  If the gameplay was more compelling on its own and the writing of the game wasn't such a significant part of what made it interesting to play, I'd be able to look past something like this, but it does present a real drawback to the game.

[h1]Do you want me to buy this or not?[/h1]

Orion Trail isn't worth it's retail price of $8.  It is, however, worth the $2.50 I paid for it on sale.  It kept me entertained and got some laughs which is more than I can say for a lot of games that try to be funny.  Really though, if you were even a little interested in Oregon Trail, you'll find this just familiar enough to be worth a couple bucks or so.  It's not going to win any Game of the Year awards, but you can sit down and in 10-20 minutes knock out a run, and whether you win or lose, feel good about playing it.

The idea is to reach the goal at the end of the system by picking the next location you will go to. You can't go backwards so picking certain paths will close off others. When you reach your destination a random event will occur based on what location you have visited. These often involved a skill check and both your captain and your 3 officers have their own stats that include such things as tactics, diplomacy and science. The different options you have are all themed around a specific skill and the more points your crew has culmitavely in that skill, the greater your chance of success so it's best to pick the choices that play to your strengths. You will sometimes have the option to send out an away team as well, which are basically a themed set of encounters. In this instance though, your skill checks are not  your crews culmitive skills, but just the skills of the officer you send to lead the expidition. The amount of situations you can encounter in this random encounters and away missions is quite varied and they will play out differently depending on what skills you choose to favour. The are often bizzare and humorous and the writing is quite good.

There is also some resource management and you will need to make sure you don't run out of your vital resources or you will face consequences. You will need to keep an eye on your food, fuel, number of crew and the condition of your hull. While running out of fuel can be a bit of a pain, running out of hull will destroy your ship and end your journey.

The game has a nice retro pixel art style to convey the events happening  in what is mostly text based encounters but the art has a lot of humour and really adds to the zany atmosphere of the whacky adventures your crew will have. The music is quite good too with catchy retro chiptunes.

All up a fun little story based game. There is a lot of luck involved in the skill tests the game makes during your encounters but if you play to your crews strengths you can normally offset that. Plus the adventures are short enough that failure is not a big deal and sometimes it's fun to fail, just to see what disaster is going to befall you when you do.

Parody of existing science fiction tropes and series is constant, making the game a more light-hearted tale of survival - or horrible death - in space. Orion Trail plays as a series of decisions, the outcome of which is determined by what amounts to the roll of electric dice the odds of which are affected by the stats of crew, ship, and circumstance. 

The decisions the player makes affect the stats that the random component works upon, and results in turn affect not only those same stats, but the resources that define the mission as a whole: crew, food, fuel, bravado, and science. The goal of any game is to survive a trip through a region of the universe. Each path has many alternate routes within it, each possessed of differing levels of danger and problems to solve. The game is different every time, making each adventure unique.

Orion Trail could best be described as a digital board game, though it does draw on early edutainment software for inspiration as well. The entire process of gameplay is decision based - there is no 'action' as such beyond player choice. Although humorous, the choices can have serious consequences. Survival is not guaranteed. The first galaxy is relatively tame, later missions become quite challenging indeed.

Ways it could balance those gameplay elements it had them would probably be more or less fuel useage for speed setting; morale and random chance to heal for food settings; and have the trading system be called a trading beacon for in-universe explanation and have it not always certain that a trading party comes or that they are friendly to balance it out with the trading post and away team missions.

As for the scoring system, it could grade you on decisions you've made, the result of said decisions, you and your officer's health, your party's final stats, ship health, fuel, food, away team missions taken, and finally redshirts alive to dead ratio, with the score multiplier being the map taken.

Ce jeu est mon coup de coeur.

Je l'avais découvert dans une précédente version sur Newgrounds et j'avais tout de suite été emballé. Il est possible de ressentir une frustration primaire face aux évènements aléatoires, parce que votre instinct de joueur refuse de perdre une partie. Mais il faut se sortir ça de la tête pour apprécier vraiment Orion Trail. Car perdre une partie y est une expérience tout aussi amusante que la gagner, souvent même davantage.


J'écris ici pour contrebalancer le nombre de plaintes sur l'aspect aléatoire du jeu. C'est un jeu qui vaut pour son écriture. Et le gameplay aléatoire et punitif est la meilleure façon de soutenir cette écriture ! Chaque évènement est ramifié en 20 issues possibles pour renouveler l'aventure et continuer de nous faire rire. Faut pas oublier que c'est une comédie dans un univers loufoque : on est un gros nulos de l'espace chargé d'une mission bien trop importante et risquée pour nous. Tel un Roger Wilco, de la série des Space Quest. Chercher à y jouer sérieusement et efficacement va à l'encontre du principe. Alors, détendez-vous !
Si, au contraire, vous ne trouvez pas votre aventure suffisamment corsée, évitez les réflexes d'optimisation : choisissez vos officiers simplement sur la tête qu'ils ont !
J'espère que vous verrez vos échecs comme une façon de vous immerger au mieux dans l'univers de ce jeu et prendrez le temps de vous construire une image mentale de votre équipe de bras-cassés... avant de les perdre tragiquement lors d'une invasion de belettes ou d'une crise existentielle de l'ordinateur de bord.


Orion Trail réserve aux univers de science-fiction le même traitement que Terry Pratchett réserve aux univers fantastiques. C'est donc particulièrement recommandé pour les gros lecteurs ou simplement ceux qui connaissent leurs classiques et ne manqueront pas de reconnaître les références littéraires et les concepts parodiés. (Par exemple, la planète usine de Nana Nutra, c'est clairement Charlie et la chocolaterie dans l'espace !) 

ATTENTION ! C'est uniquement en anglais pour le moment.


J'y joue par petites doses mais avec 40 heures depuis plus d'un an, je suis très heureux d'avoir trouvé cette perle. L'intérêt n'est pas de chercher à optimiser mes chances de succès. Il est de passer une demi-heure à me prendre pour un personnage de Futurama.


On sent l'équipe de développement vraiment présente et proche de la communauté. Il y a souvent du contenu nouveau. (Des évènements, des illustrations, etc...) Petit détail qui tue : les redshirts qu'on peut voir et martyriser lors des missions à l'extérieur du vaisseau sont nommés d'après les gens qui ont participé à financé le projet sur Kickstarter.

Excerpt of today's session log :

- Been the first intelligent being to cook by himself for centuries because of a reluctant snobbish robo-chef AI.
- Was recalled why you shouldn't EVER cross the streams.
- Harnessed power from a cosmic storm and got knowed as the space Benjamin Franklin.
- Was a gentleman. Had space-cravats, pocket quadrangles and cups of the finest Starjeeling tea. Still was butt-kicked out of planet for suspicions of being a spy.
- Had my First Officer inspire the second Space-French Revolution.
- Promoted the ship's dog as my new science Officer.
- Bought cookies from Occuloid squidlings for them to earn a trip to space camp.
- Rebelled against a congregation of 20th century enthusiasts for the sake of touchscreen equipment.
- Got disarmed by a floating gravestone. Could not replace the missing weapon.
- Befriended a Moonman and had a redshirt killed by a blob's belch.
- Been targeted by one of my own torpedoes.
- Had the ship stripped of most of its plating in exchange for more fuel. Am now in command of a space dustbin.
- Negociated peace between Occuloids and Tacoshans. Convinced them to put an end to their ancient war with a little presentation and slide transition.
- Got what's left of the hull dented by bumping into a herd of vacuum-dwelling Beefalos. Had to fill an accident report with the Tacoshan cowboys.


If that's what you expect from this game, go get it ! Don't if you are the kind who complains about RNG in games !

The RAND generator is stacked against the player making it not truly random.

I don't mind when a game is tough, but the Dev's intentionally made the game work against the player, probably because they were trying to stretch a short game into a longer one by making you constantly die and replay the same stuff. There is no real strategy in this game. You could just click any option and have just as good odds at finishing.

You play a galactic explorer in the Kirk/Picard tradition. Your goal is to cross unknown space and live to tell the tale! Along the way, you will lose fuel, hull plating, food and redshirts - er, I mean valued crewmembers! Whose loss will be keenly felt. *cough*

One day you're dodging the Analog Collective, the next you're negotiating to use the wormhole bypass to escape a nasty space anomaly. Along the way, you'll use diplomacy, science, raw firepower, sensible tactics, and sheer bravado, all of which your bridge crew will have varying numbers of skill points in. They can go up and down, depending on how lucky/unlucky you are and the choices you make. Usually it's best to specialize in three, to maximize your choices, but you can start the game being a science wizard and a terrible shot, and end it the best shot on the frontier and a science dunce, depending on how your choices unfold.

The references are clear and obvious, not just to Trek and sci-fi in general, but to the Oregon Trail and the old school of gaming. If you haven't played the old school games, experience is not required to get the jokes (Space Dysentery is self-explanatory).

Fun elements but overall just frustrating and incomplete. You'll see every encounter in the first or second playthrough (and playthroughs are very short). I received a free copy of this game after playing it at PAX East.

Pros:
-Fun shoutouts to other sci-fi games/movies/shows, not just Star Trek and Oregon Trail.
-Some of the stories and encounters are entertaining.
-Seriously, these guys are on to something, and someone else is going to actually pull this off.

Cons:
-The stories and encounters repeat every game. You visit the same outposts and have the same ""random"" encounters. You'll see everything there is to see in your first or second time through.
-Winning is probably an accident. I gave the game a break after initially trying it and being frustrated, and my first two encounters I had critical fails despite having 10 success, 1 critical success, and only ONE critical fail spot both times.
-Success usually means staving off disaster for a few more turns, whereas fails can make sure you never have a chance. You don't start off with enough resources to even make it to the end, so every fail hits hard, and the successes don't make up for it.
-You start with some currency but never see it again unless you trade in crew/fuel/food/hull and exchange it for another. They need to add the ability to pick up currency and it would make space stations much more worthwhile, instead of making you choose which area to harm yourself in. Too often I run out of fuel and engage the SOS, but don't have any resources to trade--once I only had the option to trade my remaining hull and I did it because I guess it was better than starving, so my ship exploded.",1473486977,1473486977,False,3,0,0.460452646017074585,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Ok and now the bad. This game relies on stats and RNG, unless you are challenging yourself to some weird build, the best bet is to pick 2-4 stats and raise them as high as you can.  This is the biggest weakness of the game. If there was a mini game or 2 thrown I think this game would be a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

If the Dev does read this why not ...

[*]add some silly mini games like Asteroids, Space Invaders, Dating Sim, may be some shooting away missions?
[*]maybe have different ships that give you bonuses (different max stats, or usage, more or less officers)
[*]endless mode (space station ships/missions come to you and you pick the ones to do and/or order do them in)

Every approach has four possible outcomes: Success, Fail, Critical Success, Critical Fail.

So there are 20 outcomes to each encounter, and there are hundreds of encounters. So far, almost every single line has had me in stitches. So this is what the game is.

The only real decision-making in the game is choosing between a list of a few options at each node. Usually, it is advantageous to choose the option for which you have the highest corresponding stat bonus. Sometimes, it might make more sense to choose a lesser bonus if it gives a resource that you need badly. But after you hit the probabilitty drive button, you can't control the outcome. Rolling a critical failure when you have a +8 bonus, meaning that all other outcomes would be sucessful, is a horrible feeling. There's nothign you can do as a player to mitigate the outcome. It's possible to lose horribly in a given playthough and then make all the same decisions next time and be sucessful.

...But so random. After a series of wierd successes where I still lost more than I gained, I eventually lost all my crew and am left with the 4 'main characters' of my run. So with one guy I go on an away mission, the one guy gets a critical success...which kills him. So I have 3 crew. I then get a random encounter that some of my crew became cyborgs and need fuel, I'm locked out of the option to try to not give them fuel because I don't have any crew to lose, so I lose all my fuel. So I activate SOS and wait to be rescued, my rescuer demands some of my hull for fuel, I only have 1 hull so my only option is get fuel so I can immediately blow up and lose the game.

I know that's random chance stacking up to make a wierd story, which should be fun, except that I rarely had a choice in any of those situations and when I did have a choice it randomly decided to make things worse wether I won or lost.

Is the game interesting to watch, a bit. Is it fun to play, only if you think clicking through menus with a veneer of choice/tactics/interactiveness is fun. I really wanted a fun choose your own space adventure, Orion Trail is so not what I was hoping for. I'd probably have fun if they just made a story mode, where I could just role play the story my crew is having and be able to enjoy the game at my own pace, without the random chance ruining the experience for no logical reason.

Other updates include changing up the difficulty a bit. Now when you're on the trail, you can see the difficulty of each point, ranging from one to three skulls. Plus the trail gets progressively more difficult as you reach the end. So there's some added variation in the gameplay now.

Another thing they've added since the early access days is that when you start your mission, you can now spend credits to stock up on fuel, food, crew, or hull points.

I was unsure about it at first due to the early negative reviews, but some of the more recent positive ones indicate that the developers are taking public criticism and suggestions to heart and improving the game.  So, I decided to buy it and I'm sure glad I did.

The game is very Oregon Trail meets Star Trek, minus the educational aspects OT and with lots of humor that (at times) pokes fun at ST.  Basically, you fly through space as the captain of a ship, exploring the galaxy and encountering lots of interesting challenges.  Unlike some space games that are mostly combat, Orion Trail is more of an adventure game and the challenges you face can be anything from problems with your ship and crew to encounters with other ships and space born life to planets that need exploring.  The randomness and variety of encounters and ways you can try to deal with them add to the fun and replay value.  The writing is very clever and funny and is full of hilarious Sci Fi inspired things.  There are a few typos, but nothing too bad.

The game play itself is pretty simple, though it can be at times frustrating and requires a bit of strategy (and luck.)  Encounters offer a set of solutions that use your crew skills, the success of which relies on a ""roll of the dice,"" so to speak.  Though, if you use skills that your crew has in abundance, your chance of success is greater, though still not guaranteed.  Apart from crew skills, you rely greatly on resources.  Hull plating to make your ship less susceptible to damage, food for your crew to eat, fuel for your ship's engines and red shirts to sacrifice themselves in various ways, ensuring the survival of your officers.  Successful encounters can reward you with resources or boost your officers' skills, though unsuccessful ones can have the opposite effect.

The graphics, sound and music are all well done and very retro.  Basically, the game looks and feels like an old DOS space game.  Much of the game's style is derived from Star Trek, though it's not an exact copy.  It would be more fair to call it a homage to Star Trek.  It's very resource light and will run on even slow computers.  I was able to run it on my 1 GHz dual core laptop with a so-so GPU and only 3 GB RAM with no issues whatsoever.

So, bottom line, this is a great indie game that doesn't take itself too seriously, nor should you take it too seriously.  It's fun, though at times it seems a bit unfair.  But, hey, that's how life is.",1450937514,1450972504,True,4,0,0.545165419578552246,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I had to install Steam specifically for this game. I am, however, a big Star Trek fan. 

I played the demo of this game several times and watched a short (incomplete) playthrough and then decided to buy the game myself. To be honest, I don't feel like I gained much from doing so. 

Here are my main issues:

- As others have said, the game is too random. You can make it less random by picking a crew that all excel in one area (e.g. diplomacy) but then you end up picking diplomacy options only as you know you will succeed, leaving you more like a trained monkey than a person making choices. I would have preferred the game to have a in-game ""guidebook"" (e.g. Fabulons like compliments on their outfits) which would also weigh on the choices. Protocol might say to do X, but you are more skilled in Y and you need to decide which will give better odds. Like the game ""Papers, Please"", the guidebook could also change during the game.

- No over arcing plot. The demo gave you the choice of trying to finish with either the most food or fuel which could easier have been converted into plotlines (e.g. take as much food to the X planet as possible, you need to pass through 3 systems to get there). Your crew also changes from system to system which could have remained the same, leading to more growth, and also have been integrated into the plot.

- The same issues occur over and over. While I don't mind each system throwing up the same set of issues each time you play through that particular system, some of the same issues occur in multiple systems (and perhaps more than once within the same system, though I am not completely sure as it all blurs together). I would have preferred that each system had different unique problems.

- Part of the store needs coins but there does not seem to be anyway to get coins. Perhaps I have missed something in the game, but this is not mentioned in the manual.

If you've not played the demo or seen it on YouTube, this game is worth a play. If you have done either of those before, there is no need to download to play but only to support the game designers.",1449046884,1639145120,False,4,0,0.527238547801971436,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each option has a different risk/reward, but since each choice is directly affected by one of your stats, you're really just choosing your odds of success.  Why yes game, I WOULD like some more crew, but my science stat is ONE.  Since I KNOW that you'll just kill my crew instead should I fail, I think I'll use my 6 deplomacy for this food I don't need.

Then I fail the roll anyways.  It just really, REALLY feels like the choices are arbitrary.  Maybe they aren't, but that didn't stop it from not being fun for me.  Hell, I quit reading the little stories and just clicked the number when it popped up.  They have no long-term effects, and there’s no over-arching plot to pay attention to.  There’s no reason to care about what’s doing what; the description of the actions have nothing to do with the outcome, just the stat.

Example: I was having a pretty terrible run, but it LOOKED like I could limp to the finish of level 2, but when I was ONE dot away from the end, the game informed me that someone had left the gas cap off, and the last of my fuel fell out.  I proceeded to sit there, inches from the finish line, as my crew literally starved to death waiting for rescue.

To my knowledge, there is nothing I could have done to reduce the odds of my crew being a bunch of morons.

The bottom line is that there is not one, SINGLE action I can take in this game that makes me feel like I have direct control over ANYTHING.  I don’t even feel like there’s a strategy to improve my odds.  They even added the ability to boost your resources at the start of the level, but I have no idea which ones are going to be most drained by the random encounters, so I can’t make any kind of meaningful decision!

Maybe some people find that... exciting, or something.  It just makes me want to pull my hair out.",1447024447,1447024447,False,13,1,0.631770610809326172,1,False,False,False,False,,,

You select your crew at the start of the missions and this sets your strengths and weaknesses. During the game you'll encounter various obstacles and you can overcome them by choosing from three options out of five attributes. The higher the attribute the better the chance that you'll pass the encounter successfully. You have to manage resources and during the missions there are ways to exchange one of the four for another. I think those aspects make the game feel less RNG based and more like you actually have (some) influence on the outcome.

The presentation is simple, but fits the game very well. The pixel graphics have their own style and the UI does have a Star Trek feel to it. The music is decent and sounds a bit like a 60s sci-fi soundtrack on an 8 bit machine.

There is some humour in the game, but it's not a comedy/parody game. It does have a lot of references to old sci-fi, but it doesn't rely on them. The story fragments are well written and there seem to be a lot of them.

Think of it as a choose your own adventure novel filled with nods to the sci fi genre.  Each point in space offers multiple ways of handling the situation.  Each way can result in 4 different narrative paths.  The situations repeat often.  Choosing different options and having the RNG spit out different results will keep repeating stories fresh.  I often found myself speeding through dialog I'd seen before until I branched into a new result. 

You choose your crew who each have a few points toward 5 different attributes.  These attributes give you a better chance at getting a positive result in the RNG.  Focusing on 2 of the 5 attributes seems to work well.

There is some resource management.  It boils down to ""Hey, we're low on fuel.  Let's choose the get fuel option.""  

The humor is stupendous.  The music and sound effects are charming.

If that is just too much bias for you, you might want to find something else to read! 

Orion Trail is Star Trek meets the Oregon Trail game with a slight detour provided by Monty Python.  The premise is simple enough; select a crew from the choices given (each crew member has different skill sets) then set out across space to encounter a rather ecelctic mix and use your skills to adapt, improvise and overcome. Or die trying. The puns are non stop, the encounters are full of BEMs (I might be showing my age here)  and you roll the digital dice (called the improbability drive which might have been stolen from some English writeer) and take your result in true RNG fashion. If things work out well, you gain some fuel or food or crew, if not, well, you might lose out! Your odds of a favorable solution are based on the skills you have and how many points you have in the skill you choose to bet on.  Its fun, silly and at times, a little repetitious but for a small game done on a tight budget, it came out very well.

Is Orion Trail perfect? No. I find it to be too heavy on food and fuel optimization. I can usually keep my shields and crew up to snuff. Some of the fun might be too inside for many; many of the characters are based on Kickstarter backers. However, is Orion Trail good clean entertainment? I think so. I like how I can play a mission in a few minutes and either be lauded as a great captain or be shown the door and a view of my tombstone (space dysentry anyone?)  There are nods to several pop culture genres here. Have some fun, try the game and see if you have what it takes to be a Galaxy Force captain or just another tomb in space!

Including a dance-off with Michael Jackson zombies and a trip to a Willie Wonka inspired planet. Did I mention Space Dysentery?

It had a rocky start, but I think it's actually turning out pretty rad. The initial release on Steam had its balance too out of whack, and I can see how that would've frustrated a lot of people.

They've done much to fix this, though, and it's now a genuinely enjoyable coffee break game. I wish we had more of those as inventive, clever, and funny as this.

This is about the best you're going to get when it comes to a retooling of the Oregon Trail game. I was a fan of that game way back when, and I love this even more. Honestly, it's the best of the crop of the games trying to ape it. And the balance, fun, and replayability is far better than Organ Trail.

Plus! It's a great parody for Sci-Fi fans. Especially Star Trek fans. There's a lot of in-jokes there that only they might get. Something to keep in mind. Definitely a bonus for Trek fans, but perhaps a detriment to those who aren't.

Also. You can be a bear. Your captain can be a chubby bear, and they're usually pretty great captains, too. Honestly, what more could you ask for?

If you're an older gamer (like me), you like sci-fi, and you're looking for a short game to pass the time or something like the Oregon Trail, this'll do you.

If you consider the game to be about getting from point A to point B for each stage (which is true), then it's INSANELY difficult.  A sensible player would choose never to interact with ANYTHING, because doing anything except choosing the shortest path and refusing to do anything optional saps resources you can't afford to lose.  Trouble is, you don't have enough of those resources in the first place.  Not even close.  So you HAVE to gamble to win.  But this works out about as well as it would in real life: buying lottery tickets to make rent rarely ends well.  So the game is HARD.

On the other hand, a perfectly sensible take on what makes this a game is that you're watching the comic misadventures of a Star Trek homage/parody.  Viewed that way, watching endless abusive-but-funny terrible things happen to your crew is the whole point.  You want the shit to hit the fan just to see exactly how it'll splatter.  Casually sailing through all the levels would be silly and boring.

This makes for an odd mix.  You die constantly, which is... not ideal.  But if you get into the spirit of that, it's fun again.

It's hard to say if this is intentional or not, but the sweet spot is easily hit by rampant cheating using a memory editor.  You can usually find two of the resources in just two scans, and the other two aren't much harder, should they ever pose a real threat of running out.  Once you have the power to simply undo the game's savage punishments for exploring, you're free to relax and goof off.  Which, honestly, feels like exactly what the game was designed to be about in the first place.

It's also important to note that I'm reviewing an early version of this game.  There's already talk of updating it to be easier coming from the developers.  One way I'd personally like to see them do this is by opening up your character stats to casual mods in config files, like how the ""Political Machine"" games do it.  That way, players could have fun by tailoring difficulty to their own taste.  Want to make it easy to heroically breeze through all the scenarios?  Ramp up those stats!  Want to laugh at pathetic foibles?  Use, uh, well, just use the original settings.

In short, the game is fun!  And the references are solid!  But you should be prepared to cheat like you have never cheated before if the idea of constant, near-inevitable failure stresses you out.",1444876818,1444878012,True,7,1,0.463696926832199097,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
- The art design is delightfully nostalgic and colorful, evocative in the whimsical, retro ways I hoped it would be.
- The writing is ribald tongue-in-cheek, with geek references a-plenty. It manages to be corny fun without being overwrought.

The Bad:
- I sporadically get stuck in Options and the UI becomes unresponsive to clicks, forcing me to quit the game entirely and start over.
- There is no obvious option to select a different batch of captains or officers without restarting the whole process.
- The post-luck is PUNISHING and pre-luck does not seem well-leveraged unless the player leans heavily in one attribute over another. I realize it's all RNG, but I feel remarkably unlucky. 
- Furthermore, even I do rely heavily on one or two stats (getting 'lucky' with the random batch of captains and officers offered), the random occurrences seem to target them mercilessly. Twice I've had a captain end up all zeroes at one during their 'trek' to the goal. That shouldn't be possible. I realize that part of the fun is the risk and reward, but my preparations often seem to amount to a hill o' beans and that certainly was not fun.

I felt while playing this game that I wasn't so much actually PLAYING the game as just sharing the Orion Trail experience, because from beginning to end, the game is basically pure luck.  You choose from random sets of crewmen presented to you, to give you certain stats, and that's about all you do to influence how the session goes.  I mean, you can pick your path in which systems to move towards, and whether or not to stop at certain things, I suppose, but it's not much of a choice, because in any given thing, you have no real control over your consequences.  

There are no upgrades to purchase to make you more likely to succeed.  Your crew's stats can go up or down at a whim, as random events between nodes tick these abilities up or down with no input from you.  The time honored tradition of visiting tombstones from previous playthroughs on games like Oregon Trail is doable here, but even doing THIS can cause an utterly random stat raise or decrease.  Even what skills you use during a particular incident is entirely random most of the time;  You can push up and specialize in a particular stat only to be presented with an event that doesn't allow you to use that stat.  Even the -rewards or penalties- can be randomized in many events.

Perhaps in some games, all of this randomness wouldn't be a problem.  Orion Trail tries to allieviate things a bit with its quirky and outlandish dialogue, and it works for a time.  However, said dialogue runs out too quickly, frequently recycled every playthrough.  Given you need to play through the game multiple times to unlock the content... this is a rather serious thing.  Also not present is any sense of fairness.  On any given random event, no matter how good you are in the stat, you have the chance to critically fail, and the critical failure events are so harsh that just one of them can completely break your run, often completely exhausting a vital resource.  Critical successes, on the other hand, while certainly nice, do not give you things on quite the same scale.  Furthermore, it's almost impossible to recover from a critical failure because your rewards are often given randomly as well, and you can't just complete events that'll raise the thing the Critical Failure took from you, because the opportunities are just not given.

All and all, I'd go as far to say that the game is 100% Pure Luck in whether you succeed or not, and there's not enough dialogue in the game to make playing such a ludicrously random game worth your while.

Feedback like this has been instrumental for us to see which areas frustrate players, and gives us a clear path for how we can improve the game.

We’re keenly aware that there’s an amount of chaos that people will tolerate, and that we clearly went over that limit. So, we’ve been focused on giving players more control (and actual decisions) while traveling. We hope this will act as a counterbalance to the randomness of the Probability Drive, which we feel is important to the spirit of the game.

Today’s patch adds a for-real trade screen, as well gives you the ability to adjust your starting resources at the beginning of a mission. We’ve also added many between-planet events that give you micro-decisions that aren’t based on the probability drive.

And, in general, we’ve rebalanced the constant drain of resources and the severity of punishments. We want critical failures to be bad, but we don’t want them to completely prevent you from winning.

I’d love to hear your thoughts after trying the game again after today’s changes. Your feedback will continue to help inform us where to go next with the game."

(Edited again as balancing patch fixed some of my issues with the game. I now recommend this game though only if you enjoy the humour and slot machines)

A lot of love went into creating this game, with it's nice artwork, and humour spread throughout which is why I originally backed this game on Kickstarter. However dispite the funny dialog and nice artwork I did not find the game enjoyable. The game plays out as a series events where you make decisions that all end with what is basically a slot machine, this results in a game where finishing a playthrough is based mostly on random chance.

Right from the outset the game inadvertently teaches players not to make decisions on what would you do, but rather pick the decision that will give the best odds at the next slot machine meaning the decision isn't really a decision at all, the choice is taken away from you. This also means some players stop caring about reading the dialog as they no longer have any real choice as to how the event will play out and the dialog is one of the strongest elements of the game.

With the latest patches winning a playthrough no longer feels like the grind through a random generator and now I can enjoy the humour and style of the game much more. It is and always will remain a simplified slot machine game in fancy clothing, so if the funny scripts and the winning and losing at slot machines are not something you enjoy then you'll probably want to give this game a miss.",1444685981,1446260836,True,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,False,,,

I quite enjoy the whimsical humour and the writing/sci-fi theme of Orion Trail. So do I much appreciate the art direction.

However, I am immediately put off by how much ""chance"" dominates your outcomes on the trail, disregarding your decisions.

In fact, my frustration with the RNG factor is so intense, I de-installed the game after several attempts.

It seems that the decisions I made in investing in specfic areas of expertise DID NOT MATTER AT ALL, because of the random number generater. 

I'd much perfer a system similar to described;

Each mission for the moment have three possible solutions. Solutions involving expertise like ""Science."" or ""Diplomacy"". 

To successfully complete the actions required of that solution, player must meet the skill ""threshold"".

Example.

My crew has the combined expertise in Science of 4 after initial crew member assembly.

Second mission of the trail, I am asked to gain access to an alien fuel source, blocked by an alien bio-matching vault panel lock.

Choosing my ""science"" expertise solution, which is to surgically transplant an alien tentacle to a crew's body to operate alien technology, requires a total roll of 6.

Before the roll, my expertise in Science GUARANTEE 4 points in the roll. So I only need a minimum roll of ""2"" to succeed.

This way, if I heavily invest in some expertise, I actually get rewarded by it. And can feel safer to make those choices.

Sorry, folks, that was a stretch goal that wasn't met.  Some people have complained that there's no skill involved, that it all comes down to a roll of the die.  This is broadly true, but aside from that sadly missing hunting game, Oregon Trail and the more recent ""OMG anything is better with zombies"" Organ Trail are pretty much the same way.  

Will you ford the river or try to float across?  Sneak through the horde of zombies or go through guns blazing?  Rely upon your attack rating and set phasers to ""shave"" or go with tactics and put on encounter suits to avoid the allergy problems from these furry trading aliens?  In each situation you know something about which will be more likely to succeed, but can ultimately fail based on luck... it's just that Oregon Trail is more open about that fact.

Despite the lack of hunting, I still think this is a good game.  You can't just min/max as another reviewer said because you won't always get the crew you want (you get a random assortment of three candidates for each slot), you may not have your impressive attack rating as an option each encounter, and going full-on diplomacy will leave you hurting when a bravado or science crisis hits.  You instead need to try to balance your various skills, knowing that going high on a couple of things will make those challenges more likely to succeed but that it will leave other stats weak.  And while a roll of the dice may not be an extremely exciting way to play a game, what you do have here is excellent writing.

I would fail more often than not, even with the odds ridiculously stacked in my favor. I'm not sure if RNGesus has just forsaken me or if their random numbers aren't really that random. 

This game has an amusing concept, but as a game it's boring and frustrating.",1443255310,1443255310,False,33,1,0.679604828357696533,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I really enjoyed that game and was looking for something similar. This game was not it.

The problem with this game is it feels like soul-less RNG. There are no interesting decisions. Even picking your crew, you need to specialize to get the highest number possible in one category or another, meaning choosing a captain with a skill of 3, and a crew member with a skill of 2, with as much overlap in the same skill as possible, is a no-brainer. Combat basically amounts to rolling a die. Nothing you do can manipulate those odds. Planet exploration is the only interesting part of the game, but just barely. It amounts to a simple ""press your luck"" decision game. You can choose the path your spaceship takes, like sometimes... but the only decision there is to go to which resource you need most. And if the resource on both ends of the branch is the same, is that really much of a decision? You have no idea what sort of RNG event is going to happen or affect it in any way, so yeah... boring. By contrast, Organ Trail had lots of action-RPG events where you get rewarded for skillful gameplay and are constantly making decisions that affect your success.

In the end, this game plays itself. You're just there to watch and click buttons when necessary. No strategy. No tactics. Nothing. Really wanted to like this game. Didn't.",1442769352,1442769352,False,83,3,0.712944567203521729,3,True,False,True,False,,,

I recommended it before, but now that it seems it is out of Early Access, I just can't recommend it anymore. It feels way too random. There just doesn't seem to be enough game here. You pick you captain and your officers, and you even get to rename them if you want. But the rest of the game is choosing which path to take and which stat (Attack, Science, Diplomacy, Bravado, etc.) that you are going to use to tackle the random events that crop up. After that it's all dice-rolling where the RNG feels like it, more often that not, works against you. And even now that Achievements have been activated, it doesn't really feel like any sort of actual achievement to get them. It seems like, if you just have enough playthroughs of the game, you'll get all of the achievements and nothing about your choices and skill will change that.

As for what I like about the game, there is the concept, which is basically ""Oregon Trail In Space."" I also like the visual style of the game; I am generally tired of all the indie games these days with their retro-pixelated graphics, but in this game I think it adds real charm. 

People have referred to FTL when talking about this game, but the graphics and the sense of humor bring to my mind the old Space Quest series by the Two Guys from Andromeda. Also, there is so much depth of gameplay in FTL that it makes this game seem like a computerized Choose Your Own Adventure book.

Knowing that the game is based strongly on elements the designers enjoyed from games like FTL and Oregan Trail helped me know what to expect (Kickstarter backer), but I admit that I was still pleasently surprised. While I have not found the game difficult to ""beat"" as far as individual missions go, I do admit that I find it difficult to actually keep more than just the captain alive! So if you are looking for something ridiculously hard, this isnt it. If you are looking for a choice based, text descriptive, tongue and cheek, slap stick sense of humor riddled game that sets you up to fail rather than win, this is the way to go.

The animations give a good sense of the characters (usually silly), the randomness of events helps keeps things fresh every time, and the completely random little additions and deductions on stats based on your gameplay help even more.

I would also like to add, that as a board gamer and ex-D&D splunker, I find the ability to see your ability modifiers affect your chances, and how the rolls go, to be a wonderful mechanic.

As the game has now been released, this is what I now think of it:

It's really good!

All the extra content added since I last played it (life has been busy, so over a month ago!) really shows. The game is far better balanced, more polished, and it feels complete. The devs are still on top of things, making changes based on feedback, which is an extra point in my book. I am especially loving the added random encounters, which really add flavour to the game.

If you're looking for a funny, entertaining, space homage to Oregon Trail, this is your game. It is punishing at times, with a heavy RNG component, but your strategy will make a difference, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to play.


------------------------
At the moment this game is in early access, and it doesn't have as much content as it eventually will, but I still really like it, and I think it has great potential.

I was a Kickstarter backer, as I loved the concept, and so far it has stayed true to it. I really like the art style and the writing. The random encounters are witty and full of sci-fi references, which I love. I normally hold back from early access games, but I am glad to be part of the growth and evolution of this one.

I will update this review as the game progresses. At this point, I'd say: if you want to be active part of the development, and like the style and the concept, this is a perfect time to join in. If having little play content and some balance issues bothers you, perhaps sit back, keep an eye on the forums, and see how things evolve.

Update 1: after the first game update, I can already tell that the game feels far more solid. There is more content, everything feels far more balanced, and some of the ideas discussed in the forums have been implemented. Things are looking really good!

Update 2: after the last two updates, the game has noticeably more content. It feels much deeper and more replayable, and the addition of longer missions and extra encounters also up the challenge and the need to play more strategically, rather than relying on luck.

I backed it on kickstarter and I was very excited about it. When early access came out for 9.99 I was a little surprised because that's half of what I paid on kickstarter but that okay, kickstarter isn't about getting a good deal it's about helping game devs get their games out. Then I played the first mission and at first thought it was kind of quirky but fun and completed the mission. The stat system seemed to balance the options and give me a sense of picking a team that is good a few things to increase my chances of success. Then I played the second mission and decided to try the opposite and stack one stat. I never choose that stat in my dialog options. I killed all of the crew and all but one of the officers but still won the level. At this point I feel like I could pick any four officers and random click my way through and I still would win. I wonder if it is even possible not to win? One reason I bought this game was because I am a fan of the Organ Trail. It is not even close to that game in it's current state. This game needs to be increased in difficulty and at the same time needs a way buy/sell/trade resources to increase the fun and make me want to replay it. There should be some kind of hunt for food mechanic and there needs to be a town mechanic. The music could use some work too. I feel like it just keeps recycling the same song maybe because I beat the game so quickly I was unable to listen to all of the music.

[Hinweis: Ich habe das Spiel bei Kickstarter gebacked und dadurch einen Key erhalten]


Das Spiel hat auf jeden Fall einige positive Seiten.

Der Grafikstil ist recht ansprechend.
Es hat einige witzige Anspielungen aus dem Sci-Fi und der Space Opera.
Jede Begegnung lässt sich auf unterschiedliche Weise lösen, und man darf nicht nur den Weg wählen, in dem man den höchsten Skill hat, sondern sollte sich auch über die Konsequenzen des jeweiligen Ansatzes Gedanken machen.

Mich stören aber auch einige Dinge.

Das Spiel ist stark abhängig von einem Zufallsgenerator. In einem Spiel habe ich keinen einzigen Erfolg gewürfelt.
Dabei stimmt auch das Balancing noch nicht ganz, da ich den Run trotzdem geschafft habe.... O.o
Bis jetzt sind noch zu wneig verschiedene Ereignisse im SPiel. In drei SPielen haben sich bereits einige Ereignisse mehrmals wiederholt, was dem Glücks-basierten Gameplay nicht sonderlich hilft.
Man kann abgesehen von der beschränkten Crew-Auswahl und den Entscheidungen während den Ereignissen nicht viel tun, um sein Schiff oder seine Crew aufzurüsten. Man ist somit immer vom Glück abhängig.

Außerdem sind bis jetzt nur 2 kleine Level verfügbar. 
Das Spiel ist gerade erst in den Early Access gegangen, also ist es zu erwarten, dass noch nicht viel vorhanden ist, aber vielleicht sollte man noch ein wenig warten, bevor man 10€ hierfür ausgibt.
Sollten noh mehr Ereignisse und Customization-Möglichkeiten eingebracht werden, könnte dies ein großartiges, FTL-artiges Spiel werden.",1439950653,1439950653,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,
