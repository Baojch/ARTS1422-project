No, I'm just saying as emphatically as possible that Burnstar is STILL my favorite game of all time.  Not my favorite remembered game - my favorite game to play right now.

It's better couch than Overcooked OR Lovers in a Dangerous Space-Time, let me put it that way.  No exaggeration.

This game is tight.  And to think when I first saw this game I thought it was a game for five year olds.

Oh no, my friends.

This is the quintessential isomorphic puzzle game.  For solo OR seamless, perfect co-op play, Burnstar is the biggest must-have of all-time.

To my way of thinking, this is Lego games on steroids, and so much more to the point than Lego games.  Do yourself a favor and don't quit until you've reached at least level five or six.  Things start to get good about then, and the puzzles just keep getting more challenging after that.

Also, know that even after you've played through the 70 or so levels of this thing, there are then still surprises and challenges to make at least two more complete run thoughs fun as hell.

It does a much better job of emulating that slick, vibrant, colorful, cartoony look & feel of classic arcade puzzle games than more modern stuff like Pipe Push Paradise or Stephen's Sausage Roll. 

The core game mechanics are also nicely varied. Again, this hearkens back to Arcade game mentality rather than the hyper minimalism of most modern puzzlers. So instead of focusing on one core mechanic and presenting it every way possible, Burnstar opts to build around featuring several playable characters with unique special abilities, giving you power-ups to manage, and regularly introducing new stage hazards. The way these are combined are what lead to more creative/difficult/intricate/rewarding puzzles as you journey through each world. And while a lot of it comes down to trial-and-error, it's all mostly fun. Even when you're screwing up in your first attempts through a stage, it's always satisfying to watch what will happen as you chain explosions together and figure out how a level is meant to be blown up. It's all incredibly polished and loaded with content for just $5 too.

一个非常硬派的动作解谜游戏，动作与解谜成分平衡得刚刚好。虽然一个人也能玩，但是找到一个和你一样愿意动脑的基友就更棒了。基本每关都遵循这样的流程：观察——定计——调试——改良——完美达成。BONUS关卡有一定的难度，不求全收集的话，过关还是没问题的。

You'll definitely enjoy this if you enjoy puzzle games, especially if you like top-down ones like chuck's/chip's challenge. There's even a competetitive aspect if you're into that - every stage has a speedrun leaderboard for any% and 100%. It took me about 14 hours to get gold on every original stage (but I didn't do any of the bonus worlds).

The premise of this game is, for each level, to burn up and explode everything that can be burnt/exploded, collect all the stars, and to do so in as short of a time as possible. However, this isn't like Bomberman where you have an unlimited supply of bombs - every bomb is something that has to be picked up in the stage and is consumed when used. The time, stars, and burn percentage are flexible, too - you don't need to collect everything or come in under the par time for the level in order to advance. However, if you want to ""gold"" a level, you'll need to get 100% stars and burn rate and finish under the par time (but you don't have to do that all in a single run, so you can go for 100% one time and go for any% but under par in a subsequent run and you'll still earn a gold for that level). 

While you CAN simply play to just beat each stage, I think this game is the most fun if you shoot for getting gold on every stage. You could probably blow through this game in a few hours if you didn't try to get gold. Adding speed and finding ways to optimize your run for a given level is one of the key aspects of the fun of this game, IMO.

So, the first time you play through a stage you'll probably take it slow and figure out what you need to do to get 100%, then later try to build speed and optimize in future replays. Towards the later stages, I found most of my time being spent optimizing and attempting to achieve the par time (after I had already figured out how to beat it with 100%).

The gameplay of burning stuff is unique and satisfying. Since things take time to burn and explode, a key aspect of going fast is to figure out what to burn first so you can maximize the amount of things you have burning at once. But when you start to burn more things, you can open yourself up to getting killed and having to restart.

Each character has different abilities, meaning there's multiple ways to complete stages, some faster than others. If you're creative you might even discover routes the designers never thought of.

The level/puzzle design is excellent. It increases in difficulty and complexity as you get further into the game. New mechanics are introduced at a satisfying rate.

My one suggestion would be to provide some sort of global leaderboard that takes into account your position on every stage, so you can see who is the overall top player or something like that.

Overall, if you're a fan of puzzle games, I'd say this is a must-have. It can get very heavily discounted and there's plenty of hours of playtime as well as an aspect of competition and replayability if you're interested in climbing leaderboards. There's plenty of content, too. Even after getting gold on the main game you can still play the bonus worlds and collect the hidden saplings. I highly recommended this unless you're not a big fan of puzzle games. This game deserves a lot more attention than it's received, IMO, but I think that puzzle games in general tend to be less popular these days.",1468118249,1468118256,True,7,0,0.58942258358001709,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Check out the video review at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0UohF4fjLU

One of my favorite things to do in a video game is blowing stuff up, and I’m sure there are a lot of you who feel the same way. Bomberman used to be a good option to scratch that particular itch, but after more than 40 entries in the franchise, they became rather stale. Enter Burnstar, an attempt to fuse the classic Bomberman gameplay with the elements of a puzzle game. And luckily for all of us pyromaniacs, this mix works surprisingly well.

As I mentioned before, Burnstar is heavily inspired by the Bomberman franchise. So much in fact, that you immediately become familiar with the controls: You run around while placing bombs that create new routes through the level. There is one main difference: the goal of each level is not to blow up your enemy, but to blow up the level itself. Each mission has two progress bars. You fill the first with blowing up crates, and the second with collecting stars that are dropped by the objects you blow up. 

The most important aspect of Burnstar is strategically placing those bombs. You see, there is a certain hierarchy behind the crates. Three different sizes of crates, red, orange and yellow respectively, are scattered around the level. If a crate is set on fire, it blows up and burns smaller crates around them. This doesn’t work in reverse: a red crate can burn the orange and yellow ones, but yellow crates can’t set the red and orange ones on fire. This is an essential part of Burnstar, and mastering this mechanic is the key to completing the game. 

The percentage of burned crates isn’t the only victory requirement. You also have to collect a certain number of stars, that are hidden behind purple goo or underneath the level. Blow these up via the bombs or crates and the stars will appear. If you’ve played Bomberman before, you’re probably thinking that this all sounds pretty easy. Well, it isn’t. In Burnstar, you only get a certain amount of bombs. Make one mistake and you  have to restart the level. Add that to the many times you’ll die because of an exploded crate or an enemy that appears out of nowhere, and you have the recipe for a challenging puzzler.

Most of the difficulty won’t come from merely completing the levels. Completing Burnstar is no cakewalk, but finishing the 60 levels is definitely doable and will only take you a couple of hours. The meat of the game is perfecting every stage by blowing everything up and doing so in time. This  requires  a certain amount of trial & error, a mechanic that will appeal to some people but one that I’m not particularly fond of. What I like more are the various secrets you can collect. Based on the location you have to choose the right character, each with its own unique ability like dashing and teleporting, and then figure out how you have to reach the collectable in the first place. It’s basically a puzzle within a puzzle.

As you can probably tell from this review, I like Burnstar a lot. It takes the best parts of Bomberman and puzzle games and combines them into one great whole. Even though perfecting the game isn’t for me, I had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles and of course blowing stuff up. Whether you’re looking for a new puzzle game or a solid Bomberman alternative, you can’t go wrong with Burnstar.",1428511399,1428511399,True,10,1,0.510013401508331299,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 Release Date: 03/18/2015 
Developer: Nerve Software Available on Steam for PC for a limited time for 10% off! Sale price of 8.99 (9.99 regularly) (And worth every cent!)

Author's statement:
 Don't worry it won't be super long, but it will be detailed enough to give whomever decides to read this to the fullest a basic to good grasp of the game in general. (Otherwise feel free to get popcorn and a drink this review isn't going anywhere for some time. It'll be here when you come back, I promise, unless you close it or something happens to cause this close.)

Prologue: 
 The game is fantastically fun, addictive and challenging (sometimes even outright merciless), but in such a way you don't want to throw your controller or keyboard (the controller is recommended by the fine developers at Nerve Software) through the window or monitor, but instead take a breather and go ""I know I can figure this out, it's got to have some sort of pattern to it. I'm just over thinking it.""
Some (myself included) just thought of this as a Bomberman clone, but after playing it. I will gladly take that back and say if it is a clone it is a definite thinking man's Bomberman. But really it's so much more than a clone, it has it's own flavor of a puzzle-action game that just so happens to have 4 way explosion bombs in it. Because once you get past that, the similarities stop to a degree. 
Because the premise of the game is blow all the stuff up, burn all the things, and collect all the shinies!

The storyline: 
 An evil corporation (literally named Evil. Inc) has came to Burnstar's home, Fairway Island, and has laid waste to it with goo and boxes of goo everywhere! (Cue dramatic music here.) Enter Burnstar (and company) to save their island!  

The Characters: 
 Burnstar: The main protagonist and namesake of the game who can run short bursts at an accelerated rate.
 Ember:  His adoptive sister who has a shield that both blocks her from damage and drags stars toward her in a short radius, however leaves her stationary.
 Coldsnap: A scientist who worked for Evil. Inc trying to develop a way to freeze the goo away and somehow stabbed herself with the syringe thus giving her Ice Man abilities! Okay that is a bit of a stretch, but does give her the ability to throw Sub-Zero freeze balls at obstacles and freeze them and as long as you're in a safe area (because you'll be stationary) control them! So take THAT Sub-Zero! (Please don't kill me, I'm only a writer.)
And
 Toxo: A clone of someone who wants to kill Burnstar (that's gotta be a bit of an awkward situation). Who has the ability to reproduce more clones, albeit a clone of a clone is bound to have some issues somewhere down the line so you get a purple blob clone who can attract baddies and be a very temporary shield or a button pusher for you on top of being an instant teleport back across a large map, but is stuck swaying back and forth in a single spot waiting for something to happen.
Each have their advantages and disadvantages in each map, but the maps are designed in such a fashion that sure it may be easier for let's say, Coldsnap, to do a map. Burnstar would be able to do the same map as well with really not much more effort. And it gives the game an extra little boost so you're not just stuck with one option through out the game. To me, it makes the game a bit more replayable as well, because the way you solve the map for each character can change slightly or down right all together.

Gameplay: 
 As I stated before the premise of the game is to; blow all the stuff up (make sure none of the boxes are left standing because they contain the goo and the goo is bad, mmm'kay?), burn all the things (burn all the boxes of goo and the goo on the ground because, remember the goo is bad, mmm'kay?), and collect all the shinies (as you blow up all the stuff, and burn all the things, stars will appear and you're to collect all the stars). As you start out it is like you are learning to ride the bike and Nerve is holding the bike steady for you as you learn how to play (ride). But by level 4 they've now put training wheels on your Burnstar bike, they're just standing by watching you and all is right in the world of Burnstar, as you gleefully pedal faster and faster. By the time the midway point of the first tier, Nerve has slipped away while you ride your cute little tasseled Burnstar bike with the training wheels off, but they've never stop watching you. Because as they introduce new mechanics into the game you truly feel as if they're trying to help you understand it better and get used to it first before really pushing you to hard. 
(Now this analogy flies out the window if you can find the hidden levels. Because, the hidden levels they've not only ripped your training wheels off they've now put you in a skate park and told you to master riding your Burnstar bike, oh and just for giggles in the hidden level skate park they've thrown lava in random areas, spikes, you know the ""fun"" stuff for them to laugh manically about, while you try and maintain your balance.)
As I briefly touched on, Blow up all the stuff means blow up all the boxes. Boxes range in color from Yellow (they catch fire but do not explode), Orange (they catch fire and after a short duration explode in a four way explosion much like your bombs), and Red (they act just like the orange boxes but instead of exploding in a small 4 way explosion, they explode in a large 4 way explosion.) I won't tell you all the details of how to make stuff explode, as it is better to play around and figure the puzzles out for yourself. I will say this however, you only get a certain amount of bombs per level and there are more than one way to catch things on fire and blow stuff up. Next would be burn all the things, the goo and boxes. Goo is scattered throughout the levels and catches fire  by being touched be something on fire or explosions, and (hint) causes chain-reactions sometimes. And finally, collect all the shinies, collect all the stars that appear after stuff burns and explodes. And that's pretty much it.

Overall: 
I highly recommend this game and it is a definitely worth the 10 dollar price tag.

Burnstars similar concepts is what drew me in. Plus, I'm a fan of a well made puzzle game which this is.

You play as one of 4 characters as you try to out smart the map and strategically place bombs to try and collect all the stars. 

Thats Burnstar in a nutshell.

The music is great, it plays well and the actual puzzle mechanics are fun and challenging.

It does have a slight Bomber man thing going, but aside from placing bombs and being more or less gridlike it's very different than the classic game.

Your goal is to spread fire throughout a level as thoroughly as possible while using the least amount of the explosives that each level gives for your disposal. But fire spreads in a very distinct way. Big objects spread fire further and light smaller objects on fire. Smaller boxes have a harder time lighting bigger boxes but there are exceptions that you have to learn and be aware of. This isn't the exact best explanation but that's part of the ""puzzle"" so I'll let you figure the rest out. 
But while you walk around the level you're trying to assess the best way to spread fires throughout because the number of tools you have to start fires are limited. As you get further into the game you're going to have to do the above without dying from various level hazards, and that's when I really think it pulled me in. Light all this stuff on fire in the most controllled and fast way possible, but also don't die. (There's a really quick level restart button so failure feels like failure, but you're back in it before you've really gotten down on yourself.)

Other stuff....There are four characters to choose from and each one has a unique ability, but honestly I just end up playing Burnstar because well...he's really fast and I like to go fast even if it means I die a lot.

Oh, there's actually a surprising amount of content here. The whole game has the like...I just bought an old N64 game feel where there's actually a ton of content shipped with the game..I guess what I'm trying to say is it feels complete. I've put quite a few hours in and I haven't even beat it yet.

Controls are solid and the gameplay makes you really think about using your arsenal to the best of your abilities, in attempting to maximize the damage/coverage of the area and stars for you to get. The co-op is just a rehash of the single player however, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a different experience out of it. The problem will be the number of levels, while you have 60 levels and they all feel relatively compact and unique, and some replayability to 100% sections, that may not be enough for people at a 9-10 price tag.
