There's no players, of course, no maps, it's not playable out of the box, but that never stopped the ""developer"" for trying to scam people into paying for this.  The developer embarked on a series of unethical behaviours around the game, which I'll get into, which may have contributed to the complete and utter failure of this software. 

The game was abandoned roughly 9 months after launch and hasn't been updated in 7 years.  It blew past the developers commitment to complete the game without any notification or admission of failure from the developer.  The game will never be completed.

From a technical perspective, the game didn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy minimalist/untextured low-polygon ""retro"" assets and visuals, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the early 1990s.  The lack of textures is a method that lazy devs often use to disguise their lack of talent/interest in doing the graphics properly and trying to disguise it under the name of ""art"", or ""We made it look bad on purpose"", which really isn't something gamers should have to put up with.  It's unclear why the developers weren't willing to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets and high resolution textures for the game.  It looks bad as a result of their decisions, and that's just another reason to avoid it.

The developers appear to be involved in suspicious data harvesting as they eschew SteamWorks (because SteamWorks does not facilitate privacy invasion in the ways the developers prefer) in favour of demanding users hand over their email address and other private, personal details.  Presumably this is so they can profile you, collect data on you, combine that data with other sources and sell your private information off to the highest bidder (and, in fact, anyone else who is willing to pay for it).  That's reprehensible and must not be tolerated.  I'm sure they'll swear black and blue they don't, so ""just trust them"", but I wouldn't trust these shady developers as far as I could throw them.  An ethical developer would use SteamWorks.  Stay safe out there.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 8 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Unethically, the developer sold keys to this abandoned Early Access game into cheap, nasty game bundles, where they knew it would be advertised and sold as a complete PC game.  This seems to have been done in an attempt to mislead gamers into buying a knowingly faulty, defective and incomplete product.  When a developer does this for a game they have zero practical intention of completing, this is essentially a scam, an intention to get paid for a broken/unfinished product.  Often this is done as an exit strategy, as the developer takes the money and runs.  No refunds have been given, the developer kept all the money they took from gamers.

The developer has not removed this from Steam and continues to try to scam gamers into paying for an abandoned, incomplete product. 

Megatect is carries the whopping scam price of $8 USD (ouch), but it's not worth it. Given that it's completely abandoned, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.",1682755905,1682755905,False,3,1,0.245456427335739136,0,False,False,True,True,,,

First of all, I want to remind people this game is still in Early Access, and yes, it is still a bit ""quiet"" so to speak. 

But, this game is pretty friggin' awesome! 
You play a robot that can jump, run and shoot. That's it :)
See this game as a Quake vs. Minecraft
You get the Quake (team) deathmatches and the building blocks from Minecraft, neatly packed into a futuristic look.

There are some small islands available to choose from before starting to build, or you can build completely from scratch out at sea. Place and rotate blocks, give them different colours (like a red base for the red team and blue for the blue team) and several other colours in between. 
Hopefully added is a simple ""colour pad"" where you can choose your desired colour as for now it is a bit limited.
There's foliage that you can plant, also on the metal-looking blocks, you can adjust the lighting for different themes and change the day/night cycle. 

You can make traps with fire, hidden doors, teleports, jump-pads, lava basins, dripping acid, you can add timers to normally invisible ""light paths"", or have them constantly on, or with pauses, and it all works pretty straight-forward!
You can do the tutorial, but you don't have to be a genious to figure out basic building, not even with (timed) traps/constructions!

I'm impressed with how well things work so far, the looks (Unity) a pretty good and the lighting effects are nice. 
The textures are really quite well (not so pixely as Minecraft) and the movements, also in build-mode very well working.
For those who love that everything connects, this game, too, is awesome as round objects such as arches merge prefectly with square blocks placed on top and on the sides! 

Here's hoping that more options will be added to the game during the course of development (I'm not sure but I think it's just 1 guy doing this! That's impressive!!) and that the game will catch on so we can all look forward to old-school Quake-like Death Matches!

Before I forget: It says ""Create your own sports"", but as there are no really movable objects most ideas don't work out. 
You can, for example, make a sort of ""dodgeball"" with guns instead of balls, but I think it'd be cool if there are movable objects, such as a ball, so (obviously with guns) you have to try and shoot the ball (literally) into a goal. 

Conclusion: If you still have a soft-spot for old-school shooters such as Quake, and you love designing your own levels that you can share (either editable or non-editable) with the community, it's worth buying the game! It's really not that expensive and you will have a lot of fun designing, running through your levels, expand, change, adjust, run around again, place guns, shoot at your placed targets to open secret doors to rooms with better guns, and when you're satisfied that it all works: share :)",1463843263,1463843263,True,3,1,0.485781669616699219,0,True,False,True,False,,,

First Impressions:
So I first launched the game and found myself a launcher for it. I was a bit confused as I thought that the game would throw me right in. I hit the play button and nothing happened. ""What?"" I thought to myself as I quickly googled the problem and found no solution. I continued to attempt to ""repair"" and ""redownload"" the game from the launcher to no success. I then decided to check to see if the game was downloaded correctly from steam though the ""Verify Game Cache"" function in the games properties. I did this and found out that 7 files had not been downloaded. Withing 2-3 seconds I had those files and went back into the launcher of the game. It worked! I could download the game with no issues and finally got in. 

Once the menu loaded I was blown away. The game, although in an early access stage, still had a very nice and sleek looking menu. The game looked and navigated quite professionally and is substantually better than some other early access games I have tried. After a bit of fiddling I managed to get the graphics to what my computer could run them at (max basically) and then decided to load up a world! 

I was feeling a tab bit lazy so I decided to load up somebody else's creation. Very easy and simple to use navigation allowed me to load up somebody else's map that they had created. I could edit it, play on it, and even interact with it. From what I can see, nothing was missing from the user created map and everything was working just fine. From here on I got very excited. I wanted to make my own map. A map I could call home.

I loaded up a new map and got to work. After about an hour of learning the controls I had finally gotten a hang of it! I flew around adding blocks, destroying blocks, placing enemies, placing guns, and of course, placing jump pads. I finished a bit of my map with many jumping parkour areas and some more difficult jump pad areas to reach. Overall I got a fun map that I played on by myself for some time. I then decided that this wasn't enough. I needed a bit more of something ""cool"". I went into the menu to see what I could grab for myself and found hidden doors. Well, I used them as floors. 

Once my map was finished I decided to see what else I could do with the game. The maps options were quite in depth with details such as: Gravity, Time of Day, Theme, and also Day/Night rotation being possible within the options. With my map done I decided to hop off the game and write a review, because overall the game amazed me. The graphics (although not spoken about much in this review, or even at all) are quite amazing and look very sleek. The character customization is fun and all of the weapons (although only a few so far) are perfect for an arena style shooter. 

Now for the pros and cons:

[b]Pros:[/b]
Great graphics
Fun gameplay
Good progress in the games development
Easy sharing of your games
Has mutliplayer functionality (although I haven't explored it yet)
Has good plans for the future of it's development
Developer shows good knowledge of creating games
Can be played alone/Co-Op/Multiplayer/ in PvE or PvP
Many fun user created maps for the game
Relatively cheap to buy and well worth it!

[b]Cons:[/b]
It is only a 1 man developer team which worries me if he loses interest in developing the game.
The use of an independant launcher is cool, however steam updates would be a lot easier to keep track of from the users perspective.
No publically hosted games on official servers.

At first glance, this game seems very polished already. The theme of a futuristic, ""build your dream"" platform works very well with the mechanics that have been established. Do you want to make a puzzle grid and challenge other players? Megatect can do that. Do you like sports or racing and want to invite your friends to play in your custom-built stadium? Megatect endorses that. Do you want to make an unforgiving deathmatch arena to stomp other players? MEGATECT ENCOURAGES IT!

The pros and cons of this game are really in favor of pros.

+ Graphics
+ Aesthetics
+ Environment
+ Music
+ Creativity
+ Infinite possibilities

- Underdeveloped (but it's Alpha)
- No mode selection preset for grids yet (i.e. ""Deathmatch"", ""Race"", etc.)

Other than that, I highly recommend dropping the money for this game as its potential is as limitless as your own creativity. Workshop grids will also be available in the near future, and the fact that the Dev plans on allowing you to host your own server with your friends and build your worlds together is amazing in of itself.

Question 1.
... do you like building games where you can build whatever your heart decided? .... or do you prefer shooters like Quake? .. Or maybe you prefer the more technical way and like building technical highlights through wiring, traps and complicated logical mechanics to stun your friends as well as your opponents with your wit? ok.. remember what you answered here.

Question 2.
Do you have the patience to put up with an Early Acces game, regardless of how polished it already is and how much updating goes on?

If at question 1 you either picked 1 of the choice, 2 of the choices or all of them at the same time and at question 2 you said you would have the patience. The go to the tagged game because fuck its amazing :D
Atm its even 50% off for the coming days (at time of review) to making it the cheapest non-thinker purchase ever!

Imagine Minecraft, except it was polished 3D whereby you had the choice to either make beautifull projects with realistic looks..... 
You could make a large quake-like map, set deathmatch settings and place weapon and armor spawners to turn your map into an amazing third/firstperson shooter .. or make an adventuremap using complicated technical logic that trows the Minecraft version of Tekkit out of the window for being to easy. OOORRRR.. you can do all of that at the same time! Your choice!

So far the blocks and features added can keep you busy for quite a while but regardless of the development only having 1 developer, updates are very solid and steady while the developer is very active in listening to feedback and bugreports. The roadmap also looks sweet as hell.

As can be seen in the community hub of the game, so far there have been amazing creations. Be sure to walk past the GRID forumsection as some people prefer to upload screenshots etc. there (even though today the developer added an amazing map upload system whereby you can see and play all public maps from a big maplist)",1448652734,1448652734,True,2,2,0.320565104484558105,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I had made a previous review without realising that I had forgotten to set my NVidia Graphics Card as my preferred graphics processor. The old review applies to those using Intel. Overall this game is actually pretty beautiful, when I changed my preferred graphics processor I got around 50 fps, which is a lot better than before, it isn't amazing but a lot better than originally. It is easy and fun to build and there are multiple maps to build on.  I still would recommend ""open servers"" so that people can just join a multiplayer server and have fun without having to have an ip or friends to play with, plus people can meet more people who play this game which would build the community! Saying this, I was not able to test multiplayer as I have no one who owns/plays this game. 7/10 in current state of when review was made. Needs better multiplayer system.

[h1]Note to Developers[/h1]
[code]Thanks again for the opportunity by giving me the free key. I really appreciate it![/code]

[h1]Old Review[/h1]
First off I would like to say thank you to the devs for sending me a key for this game to review.  I am sad to say I am not recommending this game just due to the poor optimization... Most games I would usually get atleast 150 fps, but at the minimum value for each graphics option (1 above off) with my base resolution of 1920x1080 I got a steady 10 fps...  The graphics seemed to look great, and the game also seemed to have a great concept, but in reality it is just unplayable without an extremely good computer and other people to play with as you need to input an ip to play multiplayer.  From the bit that I have played with building and shooting the tools/guns, with and at no one lol, seemed pretty good. This game needs to be more optimized for the lesser PC folk, and I wouldn't even consider my PC to be apart of those folk, and this game needs to be open servers so that people can just join and play rather along side needing the ip so people can either play with their friends or just play with anyone.  According to other reviews, people seem to like the game, and I feel I would to if I could actually play it steadily... Again it may be my fault but these are my specs, which ARE above the recommended specs.",1447808258,1499466070,True,13,3,0.567346751689910889,0,False,True,True,False,,,

+ A few weapons to test out and possibly have your friend join to have a little frag fest in a custom made map
+ The different themes for each map allows the creator to have a decent range of customizability (for now, very early in its current state, great potential)
+ Art style is unique especially the 'grid' system
+ Graphics are pretty solid
+ You can use buttons & wires to make trap doors in a custom arena map that you can also make (I smell a Deathrun game type/map)

I'm very happy to help support this game and its developer. I see a lot of potential for a game like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLDhB3x8y0g
i have spent over 10 hours making stuff in this game, the actual building part of the game is spot on and very solid, however some aspects of building stuff is lacking. at the moment, no moving block and no super complex stuff you can make with the Wires (think of floating redstone from Java Minecraft), so you are unable to make overly demanding buildings. at the moment, i have three buildings finished, the first you can scroll down to see a video of, the other two are on my channel if you want to check them out.

some bad stuff is in the game however, at the moment the hitboxes of the laser block (or fire block, whatever you wanna call it), the foldable floor and jumping is pretty broken. with jumping, if you are moving and jumping at the same time it is delayed, making climbing maps VERY hard to pull off.

if jumping and some hitboxes are fixed, it would be FREAKING AMAZING. would i say you should get it? FUCK YES, but it is still in early access, and so much more should be added. well worth it for what it is right now. Also, field of view maxes out at 120, for a third person shooter / first person builder.



(this is what was here before)
so far, been working on one map, loving it so far, will add more in later when i try out multiplayer and actually finish the map i have been working on :D!

Edit 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4xcu9hP-kY first shitty map, from what i can tell with the building tools this game has SO MUCH it can become, for an early alpha it is very VERY polished.
