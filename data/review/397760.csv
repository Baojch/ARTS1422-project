When you first  boot up the game; once the main menu appears, the first  button is obscured by  a message saying coming soon.  The game was released  over six years ago, so I'm assuming the  developer has abandoned the game.  

With a little patience,  I did  get the game to work,  and once I'd figured out that  the  oncoming  enemy could destroy the tower defences relatively easily   and that there was a button to the far left that  enables you to repair turrets on the fly I managed to survive until I got fed up of the constant waves with no end to them.  Once you've got a few resource production units built  your credit builds up into the thousands.  I was never able to spend it all on defences as there was no more room on each of the maps to fit any more defences.  

There appears to be only  four defences,  a machine gun,  a cannon,  a missile launcher and a resource producer.   However, looking at the images  the developer has provided,  there does look to be  other  defences available later in the game; however, I cannot confirm despite having played the game for over four hours.  

I'd like to have given this a thumbs up as I do enjoy tower defence games and I did think the graphic for this game was  reasonable.  However, in its present state, with only an endless mode that has little to excite  me once  the defences have been set up, I have to give it a thumbs down.  

If the developer does finish the game and hopefully adds more interesting towers and  a mode that  includes more maps and an ending, I  will reassess the game and maybe change it to a thumbs up, however, this seems unlikely considering the time that has elapsed since the game was released on Steam.",1701290436,1701290564,False,6,0,0.596697747707366943,0,False,False,True,True,,,

You have no idea what’s going on, it’s not clear where the enemies are coming from.
The music sounds like my sound server is broken.
This game is hard to play. Not as in demanding, but as in hard to control.
There is no way to see the whole map at once, I don’t understand why the camera isn’t limited to top view.
The camera moves so slow that it’s frustrating.
There were three towers, those can only placed on specific slots.
Those slots are only visible when you have enough money to buy a tower, so take a good look at all available slots before you start to build.
Upgrade buttons appear on the bottom of the tower info box when you have enough money.
When you lose you just you just get back to the map, I first thought the game crashed or something.
I never got past level 1.

I love Tower Defense games, especially when they got a Linux version.

I only paid a few cents for this, but it’s not worth the frustration.
Bought this in Build a Greenlight Bundle 7 in 2014. Activated the steam key last year, don’t know when the key was added, I don’t check groupees often. Got the key revoked a month ago and now activated a replacement key.

For that price you can get far better TDs for Linux:

It has been in Early Access since July 2017 and only had a couple of small updates well over a year ago despite the developer’s planned 6 month release.  Rather than update the game, the developer decided to revoke keys from bundles in an attempt to make additional revenue on previously sold licenses.

There is no strategy to the game.  Each map is a small, single path road where the enemies shuffle in from the same entry point and make their way to the end.  You can place 3 types of turrets in pre-defined slots to stop them.  However, the enemies never attack back.  All I did was place a couple of missile towers at the beginning of each map and fully upgrade them to annihilate the enemy.  Most of the time I didn't even get to see the enemies as they just instantly turned into balls of fire upon spawning in.  Each map was exactly the same strategy and despite being labeled “Urban” the maps consisted of a Mountain Road, Gas Station, Farmer's Market, and Parking Lot.  There was no story or reasoning behind it.

Y es que algo que deberia estar tan establecido como tener un juego en Steam de forma indefinida en tu cuenta siempre que se haya conseguido legitimamente, se ha visto vulnerado. Eliminar miles de claves de un juego que en la gran mayoria de los casos, llevara mas de un año en las cuentas de los afectados, y eso no es suficiente ni para el desarrollador, ni para steam de pararse a pensar el porque se hace esto. Por una parte el desarrollador, su desconocimiento de las herramientas de Steam y su egoismo de conseguir dinero, ha actuado de forma ciega sin pensar que podria estar haciendo algo mal y en como podria afectar todo esto. Luego Steam, por otra parte, que facilita que esto ocurre y no proporciona una solucción para los usuarios que al fin y al cabo somos los clientes finales de esta plataforma y de donde obtiene ingresos. Creo que deberiamos Boikotear a Steam hasta que solucciones este problema, y si eso significa no comprar nada en su tienda estas navidades, que así sea, pero lo que no se puede permitir es que se permita estos actos, y ya adelanto que si esto ha ocurrido unas pocas veces ya, si Steam no propone medidas, al final sera el pan de cada dia de la plataforma.
El desarrollador ahora mismo poco puede soluccionar sin ayuda de Steam (que se niega a dar claves de nuevo), la ha liado parda y no sabe como soluccionarlo, la comunidad esta enfadada con él y con razón, le han sacado el desde el nombre hasta alguna foto, su juego tiene una nota de votos negativos que llega al 98%, y eso es algo que Steam va a tener en cuenta, y que seguramente, cuando todo se haya calmado, culmine con eliminar este juego de la venta de Steam, no ayuda tener juegos con nota tan negativa. Será el fin de este egoista desarrollador, pero lo mas importante es si Steam aprende lección o no, y si cambia la politica de revocación de claves, que creo que es algo muy importante, bastante mas que un juego sin terminar y mal hecho.",1543781878,1543782056,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The dev agreed to allow this game to be bundled but claims he was never paid.

Furthermore, he admits to not only waiting a year in the case of Indiegala but never reaching out to them to try and resolve this issue before using the nuclear option.* Given this information and the fact that this sort of mass revocation has happen far too many times recently, always involving small indie games, I feel confidant in saying this is a new trend of shady steam dev behavior though to what end I do not know. These games have all been the type that will not sell well outside of bundles and mass revocation is nothing short of PR suicide. 

This developer needs to realize that their dispute with a bundle site is not the game owners problem. The developer signed a contract with these sites to distribute these games and any issue of nonpayment needs to be taken up with that site through legal means. Removing the product which the end user obtained legally under said distribution contract is fraud, plain and simple, and achieves nothing but ill will. Steam needs to view developers who revoke keys en-mass the same way it did those threatening to sue steam users as they are actively harming Steams user base and diminishing trust in the platform, not to mention potentially breaking the law in many countries. If these mass revocations of bundled keys continues to happen it will no doubt cause more PR and potentially legal headaches for Steam.

The revocation system on Steam needs to be looked at and handled with far more care and oversight from Steam itself in order to prevent these situations.

Watch my video first impressions review right HERE:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q4-__nlFWs

This game right now lacks any depth as it only offers 4 maps right now a month after it has launched in early access...  4 Maps might be fine if each map offered more than 3 waves of enemies, but nope you got about 10 to 15 minutes of gameplay on each map or maybe an hours worth of total content with near NO replay value.  There is also NO difficuluty options to increase the challenge offered.

This game suffers from extremely poor camera controls which can get stuck inside of the terrain and be nearly impossible to escape..

This game seems to be made of maps using free Unity assets which are quickly and carelessly created by the developer.

This game mostly just suffers from zero replay value, only about an hours worth of content right now and an asking price for the clunky and awkward mess that is here of $10 USD.  The value is awful.

My score is a 2 out of 10 (20%) with a strong ""Not Recommend"" even if you tend to like tower defense games, please go check out one of the many much better tower defense games available here on Steam such as:

Grid Defense: The Awakening
Grid Defense 2
Anomoly
Defender's Quest
Sanctum 2
Sol Survivor
Kingdom Rush Frontiers
