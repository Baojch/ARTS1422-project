I remember putting on my own music and beating this whole game in a single sitting in 2016. 

If you have a very casual enjoyment of shoot 'em up games and you got 3 dollars burning a hole in your pocket, go for it.

Really, It's been nearly 8 years and I still think ""That game was kind of fun,"" whenever I scroll past it on Steam.

It's not flashy.  Theres no story.  It's full of dumb jokes and laughable ""Characters"".

But after an hour of play; it's got tight controls (Didn't find a way to remap, but honestly, I was too busy playing the game to really look), an easy to navigate UI, easy to understand but difficult to master AI, and the upgrade/ship system adds something I've never really experianced before in the genre.  The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too, and I wish I could get it as a DLC (In Lossless format, please).

In short; it's a diamond in the rough.  Even at full price ($1.99 at the time of this review), it's worth the coin and I got it on sale.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  Fans of the genre; get this. It's not perfect, but it IS enjoyable.",1461270542,1461270542,True,22,1,0.689182698726654053,0,True,False,False,False,,,
