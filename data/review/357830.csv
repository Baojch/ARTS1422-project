In a refreshing change of pace from most retro pixel crapware polluting Steam, you can change the controls here. That's not enough to save this dumpster fire.  Resolution can be changed too... not.

单人游戏非常无聊，也许多人同屏会比较有乐趣吧
一共四种角色，攻击方式不同，没有全试，建议攻速高的那个，丢火球速度快距离远，可以隔着一个屏幕射击敌人，不建议选攻击力高的，攻击距离太近，多的那点伤害还不够被怪砍的。
游戏最多可以四人同屏游戏，应该没有根据人数变化怪物强度的设置，感觉3人以上会比较有乐趣，因为除了玩家互动配合外，想不出来还有什么乐趣可言。

游戏缺点
一、小怪太厉害，各种远程攻击，子弹速度贼快，还多。离远了还能来得及躲，离得近根本躲不开，而且发射子弹和怪物的朝向完全无关，属于和你90度站位，子弹都能飞向你的那种，根本没法预估走位，只能不停移动。
二、怪物刷新频率太高，你只能勇往直前，因为刚到下一屏，上一屏的怪又刷新了，往前走和往后退都是怪，如果你想放风筝，会发现腹背受敌，非常难受。结合第一条的小怪各种远程攻击，简直吐血
三、攻击方式太单一了，没有任何技能，平A到底。结合第二条，这个平A基本不用停，得一直点着鼠标。无脑平A，打到睡着
四、毫无剧情。上来就让你跟着指引走，下去就开砍，一路上没个剧情对话，就一层一层往下砍，杀了怪就掉金币，金币也就买血和命，太无聊了

As a fan of twin stick shooters, and old-school arcade games, this was right up my alley.  After spending far too much time trying to reach the ending, the time has come to give up and write my 2 cents:

Like Gauntlet?  This is similar in some ways, though it does make for a better single-player experience.  You start out weak, and there are 2 levels of power up to help you along, along with scrolls that offer 1-use boost (destroy everything on-screen, make you invincible for a short period, etc).  Things start out promising for the first few levels, but around level 6 or so it becomes quite unbalanced and very grindy.  By the end, although I wanted to finish it, I had to eventually give up having reached the end-boss once only.  Maybe I'm playing it wrong.

The good:
- nice graphics
- good controls
- fun to figure out the map and hunt for your upgrades to help you along
- Not very long (at least to get to the late levels), so well suited to short game-play sessions
- Having end bosses is nice and adds to the sense of progression
- There are secrets to discover

The not-so-good:
- feels like your weapon could use a couple more levels of power up. Enemies become overwhelming in both speed and numbers in later levels, to the point where you basically have to keep restarting if you don't luck out and get a couple power-ups early. 
- The randomly placed scrolls need to be ""discovered"" before they start to appear. Took me awhile to figure out ""discover"" means actually used. So if you are hanging onto a scroll (you can only carry one), and discover a new one but don't want to waste what you have, it basically is considered ""not discovered"".  To compound this, it can be sometimes hard to tell the colours apart so you end up wasting one only to discover your new scroll is something you've seen before.
- Hard to be certain, but it seems like the enemies become more difficult and faster as you acquire power ups like increased shot speed.  Basically you can never really even the odds.
- Some of the bosses are pretty cheap.
- Objects are random, and some things you destroy actually spawn enemies. Since you lose your powerups when you die, it makes restarting a bit of a crap-shoot.

A key thing in Gauntlet was the generators. If you could destroy one, you basically stopped enemies from spawning. There is no such machanic here, so basically there is nothing you can do to stop things from getting hard...nothing to really even the odds at all. Things just keep coming and coming until you are over-run.

In short, it is fun while it lasts, but unless your OCD kicks in like mine did it really runs its course pretty quickly.  The game is free now, so one can't complain too much but there are definitely more balanced games out there to spend your time on.

My Thoughts: Attack of the Labyrinth is not a bad game but it is also not a perfect game. There are many flaws that even the maker has ammited to and says it would take an entire rewrite of the game to create the game he imagined. That said this game is fun. With a multi player and many classes it can bring hours of entertainment either alone or with friends. I tried out all of the classes, with the melee class being nearly impossible to play, and they are all uniquely fun.
Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)
Graphics: 3 The NES style graphics leave much to the imagination, and with lighting effects somtimes you can't tell what color some of the monsters are. (White bat looks red next to torches)
Playability: 3 The controls are pretty simple, either mouse and keyboard or handheld controler, but it lacks a few options I would like to see such as the ability to put down a scroll instead of using it.
Fun: 3.5 Random generation is always great but some classes have hard times with corners or ranged enemies.
Sound: 3 The music isn't horrifing, and neither the sound affects but I wouldn't seek out a soundtrack.
Replay: 4 Random generation, multiple classes, and progressive achivements will keep you coming back for more abuse.
Final Score: 3.5 
Final Thought: This game is worth getting, and at $1.99 you wouldn't break the bank if you didn't want to wait for a sale.

The other classes seem to pale in comparison, but it is still a fun time.

The upgrades feel like a proper shmup, they are significant, but you lose them when you die. But the permanent upgrades give the game a slight RPG feel that is cool.

The game could use a couple of things that I think would have made it more fun:

1. A more gradual ramp-up of enemy difficulty and frequency. Basically you are getting random encounters with tons of monsters right out of the gate, and there doesn't seem to be anything stopping you from bumping into rather ""nasty"" monsters in the very first parts of the very first level.

This isn't a flaw, by itself, but it seems like a missed opportunity to feel like you are gradually ramping up, which is common in shmups.

2. The game could use some ""sanctuaries"". The shops seems like the obvious choice, but it would be nice to have somewhere to go to think, count, and just look at your map for a few seconds.

From what I've collected, this game seems to have had a rocky history/start, but I can't really find anything major to gripe about it. I'd imagine major issues have since been patched by the time I played this game.

Attack of the Labyrinth is pretty basic and it can be beaten in about 80 minutes if you're experienced with the genre, slightly longer if not. It's hard to get a game over in this game because if you're decent at it and like to explore you'll either find a ton of 1UP's or be able to buy lots of them from the store. There are two endings that I'm aware of and the requirements to get the ""good"" ending aren't that hard.

My only real gripe is that there's something weird going on with the achievements, namely that some people think one of them is outright broken, and that there are a couple whose unlock requirements are unclear. As I write this review there's no guide and no insight on the forum as to what's what. If you're looking for completion, I'd stay away from this one.

Only problem that i have is the fact that there is almost no replay value, unless you're curious about the story. Every time you die, you're good to start over from scratch, and i really don't like that in a rogue like game.

So all in all, this game is cool, and will be probably even cooler with friends to play with.

Attack of the Labyrinth is fun little arcade game. Sadly, it doesn't offer much depth, but it isn't an expensive title. This is first impressions of the game.

A peaceful kingdom is treathen by dark presence. A labyrinth of pure evil, with an army unlike any seen before. So, now it's up to four Champions to save the kingdom. Simple story.

This is 2D game, so the lacking of video options is understandable. So is the rebindable keys to ceratin degree. It would be nice to change them. The graphics are retro pixel art with a lot of colours

There is four classes to choose from. Those are the Champions. I only play with the Wizard. With him the gameplay is a twin-stick shooter. You have only one attack – a projectile and that's it. Well, there is more, but not much. In the levels you can find or buy upgrades. They change your projectile and your appearance. The wizard can be upgraded two times, I don't know about the others. The only other thing that can help you are scrolls. They are one time use magic spell. Health, Mace, Summon, Shield and Radiant. The last is extremely powerful clearing spell. You can carry one at a time. There is nothing more to the gameplay.

With the gold you collect from dead enemies, chests and everything that explodes, you can buy from a shop inside the level lives (yes, there are lives here), scrolls, health and upgrades and nothing more.

Dungeons or labyrinths are pretty diverce as layout. I saw ice cave, mines with tracks, grass, dirt or gold and so on. All levels are randomly generated, which add to the replayability. When you enter a labyrinth you have to find a key, then the exit. Also there is place with a map, that shows where those things are and the shop. There is no mini map and sometimes it's a little bit confusing. Before every boss you have to make it through series of levels. The first is small, but they get progressively larger. The labyrinth with the boss encounter are pretty big and without a mini map it can take you a while to find the key and the exit.

Enemies are okay. Different types of spiders, ghosts, archers, knights and so on. When they surround they are dangerous. The game is pretty intense and I like that. The bosses are creative and fun to fight.

Effects resemble 8-bit games from the past and they are nice. Music is okay, but not very memorable. I can't think of a single track.

The games is okay. It's very colorful with responsive controls and it's fun for a while. There is local co-op, but didn't try it. Probably it will be more fun with a friend, but I think it's a mistake not to have online multiplayer. Sadly, my biggest disappointment is the lack of gameplay depth. One projectile and scrolls. I played almost two hours and i'm already getting bored. It's just functional, fun little game. But when you consider the prise, I think the game is alright.

But the first section is where you become powerful and build up like 10 lives. The second part is where you get bored. :p But theoretically, if you keep the momentum going, you have enough lives to bully your way through the game.

Wow, that's pretty much the one word to describe Attack of the Labyrinth, this is of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of playing in a while. The gameplay is so simple, yet so addictive. This is a hard as nails arcade action dungeon crawling game. I'd also say it has a hint of rogue-like too. 

There are plenty of classes to choose from as with most fantasy type games, my favorite here has to be the mage, his spells get so overpowered once you rank them up. I did also spend some time playing as an archer but I struggled to find my stride there. 

As you roam around the dungeon killing the endless supply of enemies, you collect their coin and can upgrade your spells and weapons, along with buying additional lives and hearts. You have hearts per life, run out of lives and you have to start all over again. Thankfully there is some sort of gated progression here, each portal has three levels to it. As long as you beat the end boss in each portal, you'll only have to repeat one level, and not the whole game again. 

I cannot wait to try out the local co-op here and can support up to four players! The controls are so responsive to your movements, it is almost perfect.  This is an absolute gem of a bargain at its current price as there is tons of gameplay and replay ability here.

Pro: 

-Il prezzo è piuttosto basso e conveniente ma, come sempre, consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto in offerta.
-Veloce e graficamente ""retrò""
-Achievements facili

Contro:

-Il sistema delle monetine appare decisamente inutile, in quanto avrebbero potuto renderlo più ampiò e variegato.

-Manca di vere sfide

Acquistatelo (in offerta) come un prodotto senza pretese, ma capace di regalarvi, sicuramente, un pò di immediato divertimento.

It's a game that I'm finding is fun both if you only have a few minutes to kill or if you have time to really try to go through to the end.  I like the visual style of the game, it's very colorful with nicely animated characters.  The controls for character movement are really precise.

I think that if you like older arcade games like the original Gauntlet then you'll have fun with this game.  As far as the price goes, for me I think it's worth the price.  It has the feel of an old school arcade game that I would have dropped more than six dollars in quarters in.

The only con for me is that I wish the controls could be remapped.  When using an xbox controller, I wish the attacks could be mapped to the second stick instead of the buttons.  Also I have an arcade controller that I think would be great for this game if I could set the controls to use it.

- Pontos altos:
Como ser bem arcade. Lembrou muito jogos de snes e fliperama que viva colocando fichas pra ver o quão longe se conseguia chegar, acredito que seja a proposta do game e faz isso com perfeição;

Os gráficos são muito agradáveis e os sprites bem desenhados;

As conquistas são bem razoáveis, nada muito impossível...só aquela das fadas, essa pelo amor....;

Local COOP
- O que pode melhorar:

Upgrades: 
Ao invés de perdemos todo os upgrades quando morremos, poderíamos apenas baixar um level de upgrade, quando estamos em uma fase bem pra frente no jogo, com muitos mobs fica muito dificil se morrermos e perdemos os upgrades. Outro ponto a quantidade de upgrades, acredito que 3 é bem pouco, ficamos overpowered muito rápido, já que podemos comprar na lojinha;

Multiplayer: Não tenho conhecimento técnico para isso mas acredito que fazer um multiplayer online deve ser complicado, mas seria muito bom se tivesse em alguma atualização.

Classes e ataques: Poderiamos ter alguma opção de ataque, por exeplo segurando ctrl ou algo assim. Um ataque secundário deixaria o jogo mais dinâmico. A classe dragon eu não entendi muito bem, não muda muito da knight, poderia ter um diferencial (no ataque secundário por exemplo).

-Resumindo

Um jogo bem divertido de ver até onde se consegue chegar, infelizmente não joguei o coop local, mas deve ser ótimo (até 4 jogadores) e não fechei ainda (com quase 2 hrs). Quem gosta do gênero e de lembrar os arcades que te faziam ficar na locadora até sua mãe ir te buscar com uma havaiana na mão vai curtir. 

-Off
 Em relação aos comentários negativos, acho que hoje em dia, não se importam muito com desenrolar todo da história, o trabalho e dedicação que é necessário para se fazer um jogo indie de qualidade e se importam apenas em ganhar ""likes e favs"" no youtube ou redes sociais. Sinceramente, imagino o trabalho que deu de fazer esse jogo, enviar para o greenlight, disponibilizar uma demo para browser, e ainda responder comentários e escutar opiniões, e ainda manter um preço baixo... Parabéns ao desenvolvedor! 
Claro que todos tem um opinião, e essa é a minha.
Recomendo.

[u][url=http://youtu.be/x3g8-X_9zSc]Watch me lose faith in the game by the minute with my Build-a-Review[/url][/u]

Pro:
_Looks good: The game looks simple, but vibrant. The character and attack animation all looks nice too. Wide variety of enemies sprites as well.
_Plays well: Controls exactly as you'd expect it. Feels precise.
_Co-op: The game has co-op, and co-op play should make almost any game better.

Cons:
_Bare-boned: This whole game feels like one level. The enemies, while varied in looks, mostly behave the same way. The levels are all the same too, with no set-pieces or events or anything interesting. The 4 chracters are basically only 2 characters: The melee type, and the ranged type. Chracters upgrade in a linear fashion twice, but there's no variety in term of how they're upgraded. There's no items that change the way you play. Shops only sell the same thing over and over. The list goes on.
_Short, really really short: I mean, it's really short. Might be a blessing, I suppose, if you're not having a good time. But it's hard to excuse a game that is THIS short, even on a $6 price tag.
_Co-op is only local: Minor point, really, but worth mentioning.
_WAY too easy, too.

Is it worth $6? I'm afraid not, and that's coming from the guy that gives every game the benefit of the doubt. It's simply too short, too shallow, too dumb, too easy, too simple. There's nothing here for you, the gamer. Game dev, if you're reading this, this is not a game, it's a level. It's a good start, but not enough is here.",1427709198,1427709610,False,34,3,0.49496692419052124,3,True,False,False,False,,,
