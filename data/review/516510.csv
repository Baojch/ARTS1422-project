Now I understand learning a new game. I googled, binged, yahoo'd, used steam boards for any information on this game, looked on youtube for help, read other reviews on the game and common bugs- nothing. Literally crumbs of information.

Nobody cares about this game, and if it's 7 years old and STILL nobody cares, screw it. 

Oh, and it says I've played 5 hours, when I've literally opened it up and spent almost 40 minutes trying to figure something out that might be my own impatience, might be a bug, but honestly if you look at the game for 2 seconds after logging on for the first time, you get it.

But it's fine for what it is.
Since i got more into podcasts and audiobooks, this looks to be my next grind game.
I would not recommend this for a lot of people (especialy if you never played early mmos or you dont have much free time), but for those who want this kinda thing, it's perfect.

There was one guy who was constantly crashing the server because the game is build from a stolen engine called [url=https://imgur.com/e0mVmTS] Resbak[/url], the same engine is also used in another game called Life Forge anyway. 

When Adam sold the game the new owners of the game decided to change the name from ""Orake 2D MMORPG"" to ""Orake Classic"" then all the account was gone deleted including all the purchase and time that people have invested. 
I still have all my stats+bank screenshots from my old account because I somehow knew this was gonna happen.

Adam has not been the developer for nearly 2 years. You can tell because that was the one of the original GUI chat bars. As the new team of developers, we do not perform nor condone this type of exchange.

Edit (in response to OP changing their review):

Hello again, Mechant. As we've already explained to you in our Discord when you brought this concern to us, the engine that Orake Classic is based on is open-source and has been since 2016, and updated version can be obtained from here: 
https://github.com/abhijeetviswa/Eclipse-Worlds
You may also see various custom versions of the engine on this website: 
https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/forum/46-other-game-engines/

We understand your frustration with purchases and game progress you've made in the game while it was in the hands of the previous developers (we are also veteran players of Orake when it was owned by the last two owners, Adam and Smoot). Unfortunately, the last owner had wiped all the accounts in an attempt to make a free-to-play version of Orake (known as Orake Reborn) while developing a sequel, before selling the game to us. So, we have no power in re-obtaining your accounts. 

Pertaining to the lifetime membership issue, we (and even the last owner) do not offer it because it is not a good economic model, especially for us as independent developers. Frankly. it is not up to us to honor the deals you've made with the last owners. However, we do offer some membership to those who did buy this in the past as a sign of good faith, as we have already offered you given proof of purchase. 

The last part of your updated review is incorrect. All content is accessible to everyone, free-to-play players and members alike. Membership provides a means to travel around the world quicker and support us in further developing the game with content the players want."

Orake is the text-book example of an indie MMORPG. Originally created by a developer wanting to create his own MMORPG.
The original owner of this game is no longer around and the game has now been bought by some of what used to be the core players of Orake.
I've played on and off since 2017, and I have to say that this games current state is better than it has ever been in terms of content.
The new developers really care for the game, in a way that the past owner never did. Lot's of energy and passion has gone in to this game during the past 6 months. 

It's not perfect, not even remotely close to perfect. It's a very flawed game.
It's pretty buggy and the balancing is a mess, but none the less it's a great game!
The way you progress through Orake is satisfying as hell, It's very grindy but not as grindy as other MMORPGs out there.

Its history of multiple ownership changes has left it languishing in a state of neglect and disappointment.

Fading Glory:
In its earlier iterations, ""Orake"" radiated potential and passion. Today, however, the game's allure has diminished, leaving players disheartened by the evident lack of care.

Monetization Mishaps:
The game's monetization strategy has taken a perplexing turn for the worse. The formerly accessible in-game cash shop now stands as a broken relic, and players are forced to navigate a bewildering maze of manual payments through external platforms like Discord.

Technical Turmoil:
Beneath the surface, ""Orake"" is riddled with technical problems that cripple the overall experience. Glitches and bugs run rampant, disrupting any hope of smooth gameplay. Moreover, the decision to incorporate copyrighted music from unrelated franchises is a jarring reminder of the game's lack of attention to detail.

Visual Chaos and Design Lapses:
A once-cohesive visual design has fallen into disarray, with newer mobs clashing against the established aesthetic. The baffling inclusion of non-animated images as in-game entities, like the incongruous ""Goku,"" shatters any semblance of immersion. And music stolen from the Final Fantasy franchise and others.

Creative Stagnation:
""Orake"" struggles under the weight of its own creative stagnation. The absence of fresh ideas and innovative concepts hampers player engagement, resulting in a game devoid of a clear identity.

Frequent Downtime and Server Woes:
The game's foundation is alarmingly unstable. Frequent server crashes disrupt player experiences and undermine the game's potential. The continuous downtime not only erodes immersion but also reflects a lack of commitment to stability.

Conclusion:
""Orake"" serves as a cautionary tale of potential squandered. Mismanagement, technical inadequacies, creative stagnation, and the perplexing use of unrelated copyrighted music have collectively led to the game's current dismal state. This review stands as a plea for the revival of ""Orake"" from the depths of mediocrity, with the hope that it can recapture the essence of its promising beginnings and deliver an engaging experience worthy of players' time and dedication.",1544770076,1692029141,False,3,3,0.451082557439804077,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you have ever played a game like RuneScape, or any similar MMO, be prepared to play what seems to be a junior developer's attempt to recreate it in less than a few weeks.

Graphics, while I understand aren't prioritized, are bad. Not in the sense that they are 8-bit style, but the textured used make finding things difficult. There is too much going on in certain towns, and the colors don't mix well. In some places, it takes a moment to see where your character is s tanding, because the colors are vomit on the screen -- NOTHING POPS OUT, very bland.

If this game was created as a project, to see if the developer could create something technically considered an MMO, then I applaud them. Good job, I hope you improve.

    -This game, like most mmorpgs, has its pros and cons. You need to come into the game with the mind set that there are quests that require you to gather things and turn them in, some grinding of mobs for loot/quests, non-forgiving PvP (only in designated pvp zones that you won't just wonder into), and a skilling system that requires you to level up a gathering skill to increase a crafting skill. Those are the key elements of this game, that I have taken in over my 35 hours within the game.
 
    -The combat leveling system reminds me of Runescape Classic, by that I mean you have a total combat level that is increased by leveling Archery, Sorcery, and Attack. Currently, my character has 22 Archery, 5 Attack, and 2 Sorcery. My total combat is 13. My goal is to get Archery as high as I can, and keep Sorcery/Attack as low as I can in order to keep my total combat level low. It really reminds me of a ""pure build"" in Runescape Classic. I don't know if this is effective or not, but it is how I am choosing to leveling, which is a point I want to make.. the game lets you level how you like. 

   -The quests are not reinventing the wheel, but they do tend to be a little more indepth than just collect this by killing this 100 times. Another aspect of the game I find refreshing is that there are always game mods in the game, or at least I have always been able to find one in the major cities. They will ask for suggestions and comments on features of the game, and I have seen the changes they have made in the game based off of what players have suggested. The game is still in development, afterall. 




    -Tldr; It's free to play with a membership feature that unlocks some cute/convenient features, only requires a small download/older computers can run the game effectively, nice/supportive community/mods/programmers (unless you get on the global chat network to make a fool of yourself or try to ruin the experience for others [ you will be attacked and sent the depths of hell if so, ><"" ]), interesting PvP system, and customizable leveling.

I've had plenty of crashes, bugs and issues, one thing is that on my laptop the game won't allow me to walk into member area, it just crashes, it also auto crashes if you have an unstable internet connection (wifi) instead of just having you lag out for a couple of seconds it auto closes the client...

If one of the two servers ever go down, you don't get auto kicked so your character is just stuck there, not letting you login on the other server.
Sometimes, the server crashed and it would be down for several hours and the admins were terrible at communcation so they wouldn't say anything at all their players were asking what was going on in Discord.

They introduced a marketplace where you could sell your items, you were limited to 2 items per character and server.
I lost  8 out of 10 items I tried selling on market, which was more than 10mil gold, and every single message about it was ignored, I was already bored of the game at that point since it seriously lacks content, the map is definitly not big enough to support a bigger playerbase so it's pretty reasonable that at most there were 20 ""players"" online - a lot of bots. 

When you create an account the Account name and passwords are stored inside readable textfiles that Admin has access to.

There is no Lost password option, Admin has to search for your acc/pw through the files so you have to get in contact with someone through discord or skype (usually Adam), who is never there.

When you buy membership (which is essentially -- access to a second bank and a teleport room for quick access), this also has to be given out by Adam, it's not an automatic transaction. 

Same goes with any other donation purchases. 

There is something called a Bless, that increases the servers experience gain rate for a set amount of time, (1 hour per bless). 

This was given out during US time always since the admins are from the US, it was usually given out as compensation because the server crashed maybe 1-4 times per day, most every day.

I recently found this game in my suggestions on steam this week. I tend to ignore suggestions.. but its a free game might as well give it a shot, right? Now I personally try to ignore reviews before playing a game. I like to experience a game for myself and form my own opinion. [spoiler] Now regret my decision to not heed the warnings after seeing this game is mixed for all reviews, and very negative for recent posts.[/spoiler] So I instantly went ahead and downloaded the game. I was maybe a minute or two into the tutorial and someone named red something appeared and stood there maybe 30 seconds before I got booted from the game...  I instantly tried to login again only to find out I was banned.

After reading alot of the reviews it seems they have a huge issue with moderation, and falsely banning people without warning. It really saddens me to see how all the reviews seem to paint the same picture and the developer's response to a majority of them all is to blames the players... 

I will check back in the near future to see if any changes are made to their choice in staff.

New Review
So this project has changed hands to someone that at least appears competent. I'll be changing this review as to give him a fair shake, and will update it when I've played a bit more. Unfortunately bans do not work as intended, and only check for returning users, so I can easily create a new account and test the game out again.

Über das Endgame und die langzeit Spielerfahrung kann ich leider nichts sagen, das schon mal vorweg. Ich habe das Spiel angespielt und werde es wohl nicht weiter spielen. Zunächst ist das Spiel sehr übersichtlich, die meisten Mechaniken sind sehr Logisch und schlicht gehalten, eigentlich ist das ganze Spiel schlicht gehalten. Die Texte sind auch für Englischschwache Spieler gut verständlich und die Atmosphäre ist eigentlich recht stimmig. Das Spiel wirkt teilweise etwas der Zeit hinterher, was nicht zwingend schlecht sein muss manche suchen ja genau sowas ein richtiges Retro Spiel was man mit Freunden spielen kann. Wirklich gestört hat mich nur das man weder die Auflösung noch die Tastenbelegung verändern konnte oder ich war nur zu blöd dazu es zu finden, es gab sehr wenige Spieler soweit ich das gesehen habe, aber das Spiel läuft konstant und gut. Wie gesagt die Mechaniken sind einfach zu versteh und umzusetzten auch wenn man sich an das Gameplay und die Bewegungen erstmal gewöhnen muss. 
Mein Fazit ist man kann Orake 2D spielen und für Interessenten sicher einen Blick wert vorallen da es ja auch Kostenlos ist.

I have lost count on how many times the server has rerolled my stats.

If you happen to jump from server 1 to server 2 in order to farm maps 
or resources. There will be times where you can spend 3-4 hours raising
your stats, log out and come back in to find yourself in the same place 
you started. For example I did a 3 hour session on gathering / alchemy 
and raised it about 5 points each. When I logged back the server restarted
my stats and all my progress had been lost. I put up with this the first time
but this has happened now 3 times. Its annoying as hell and someone in 
game mentioned that there is a certain bug when jumping from server 1
to 2 that causes this. Most decent spots for gathering in server 1 are taken
so if you want to jump to server 2 do it at your own risk. 

Personally I can't play knowing that couple hours can potentially be wasted
on bad coding. I met a couple people that this has happened to already
by the way. 

Play it if you want but your reward at the end of the day could be a reroll 
leaving you back at square 1.",1510258488,1510269827,True,2,0,0.455198168754577637,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I like the game, however I dislike the team developing it. After trying to reach out to them on how to make their game look a little bit more professional in terms of their dialogue, naming of items or even monsters, they gave me absolutely no response and just simply deleted comments I posted & removed the news page with the suggestions on it.

- Example - 

Why not find a better name for new items, instead of taking a staff and just naming it ""Strong Healing Staff""? 

Or 

For your new NPC's you bring into the game don't just generic name it ""Blue Goblin and Blue Slime"" even the town sounded very generic and lame ""Blue Goblin Town"". To me this just screams laziness and lack of creativity / imagination on the developers part.

Also I'm not sure why the update list on your game is always such an eye-sore to read through, when you post updates you post them in a mixed category instead of bunching them up.

Are you searching endless hours for a new MMORPG? Are you a fan of the old-school, nostalgic feeling of a 2D graphic?
If the answer to those are positive , then you my friend have just arrived at the perfect place!
May the endless searching stop! Now have a moment to read this review!

So after spending quite a bunch of hours in this game I figured I'd like to throw in a review.
At first glance , you gotta like the 2D.. It somewhat feels strange at first , but you gotta give it a shot.
You're not a true RPG player if you quit at first 2 hours - that's def not what RPG is about.
I wud say that you atleast try the game untill level 30 untill you realy felt and seen everything and then you know,
If this game is for you or not.

So after a couple of hours you'll notice that there's a bunch of friendly people that'll help you out.
Almost everytime you got a question there's someone to help or answer it for you.

There's tons of stuff to explore in this game and here comes a list.

Pros --
Quite a big world - takes quite a while to get to end game.
Tons of stuff to do if you ain't into combat at that specific moment. As in crafting proffessions!
Realy, realy friendly community that helps out in almost every case. In case you just want to chat and learn more.
Realy active dev's - there's updates constantly - more like each and every week.

Cons --
I guess con's would be when you die in Boneyard which is a place you can choose not to go to if you dont want to.
It's the place where people PVP.
Restriction to PVP - must be +- 10 Levels of your level in order to attack or be attacked.
When you die over there - you lose almost everything and it sucks a bunch..
But fear not , there's always someone that will get you back on track if you just ask nicely.
Atleast untill you get atleast level 40+ people will almost always be able to set you back on track.
So it's a place you I recommend you visit either way , due to some good leveling.

Other than that I can't realy find another con - yeah it might get slow to level at some point,
Buuuut... It's a RPG - what did you expect.

With some closing words - I do strongly recommend this game - if you into 2D RPG.
Best wishes!
Hope to see you in-game!

EDIT: This part of the review is the experience since I've come back to the game. The developers have clearly been putting time into updates and the meta-game is still wonderful. The recent updates have been a great addition to the game. The music is tasteful, suiting, and professional.

It's got the good elements of games like Runescape and Tibia without the countless botters and hackers. And with plenty of room to grow.

A ton of quests and new stuff being added/tweaked on a weekly basis, new content constantly in the works which in turns makes you excited to log on every day because you never know what might have been added.

Pay2win is pretty much nonexistant with a really juicy teleport room and lots more storage space for those who want the perks of membership, and i'm sure there's alot of additions in store for members aswell.

Varied and interesting enough that the grinding doesn't get old right away, lack of a class system gives you alot of freedom to play the style YOU want to play.

The wiki is very out of date and incomplete.

When I first started I had to make maps on paper of each zone, write down drops from mobs that weren't on wiki and many other things.  I also don't know what the quest line is so I have no clue which NPC I need to advance to the next zone.  The sense of exploration really isn't there.  The quests are ""Go kill X-monsters.""  ""Go collect X-things.""  It isn't like we're ""finding"" something interesting.  The game is just overly tedious in terms of lack of documentation.

The developers are too focused on churning out content rather than refining what already exists.  They focus on that as a priority over properly documenting content so people know how to interact with it.  I'm not sure that is wise since the community is so small.  New players won't have any clue what is available in game... there is little-to-no info on it.  As a result you have to spend extra time gathering information about the game.

This game looks really nice!  It has that old school vibe to it with skills and combat and the maps, plus there's a player maintained wikia that's always up to date.  The devs interact with the players all the time and the community is pretty solid and always active, even when the servers crash people still find ways to have fun.

Cons:

It's a grind...all of it...a grind for skills, a grind for materials for crafting, a grind to level up crafting, a grind to level combat skills, and the prices of items sold by NPCs is just insane....you will literally have to grind for days or weeks just to afford high level spells and/or gear and that's not counting the time it takes to grind up the required skills to wear said gear and/or use said spells.  It's a game about grinding.  It's a game about doing the same thing over and over and over again non-stop so you can get a few rewards that help you to do it faster on a different set of mobs and for a different set of items.

This game is a grind, so if you love grinding, you will love this game.  Otherwise, I can't see any normal player lasting more than a few hours in this as a nice diversion.  The servers crash every so often and there have been rollbacks but that's because of the small dev group size and the limited funds.  The game has spirit but because it's been around for about a year, the players that learned how to farm stuff....where to farm stuff....have completely destroyed the value of all in game items.  They found ways to make lots of gold quickly and the devs over adjusted the prices of items to compensate for that....probably not realizing that they were leaving the lower level folks who don't know how to get that much gold that quickly in the dust and facing a rather large mountain to climb to even get anywhere.

I wouldn't reccomend this game because after years spent playing MMOs, I am sick to death of grinding....period.",1501878354,1501878354,False,8,1,0.472754687070846558,1,False,False,False,False,,,

''How much?'' I asked.

''Fifty two billion trillion gold coins'' He replied... 

I decided to stick with just my bronze sword for the moment. At least until I happened upon the wreck of a Spanish galleon washed up on the shore on a return journey from the new world.

The town seemed to be well guarded. I stopped to ask directions from one of the heavily armed knights patrolling the streets. Unfortunatly, I have a disability that means I begin conversations in the exact same way as I violently attack someone. Understandably, the knight was not best pleased. I decided to make myself scarce...

Sometime later, and I came upon a farmer by the roadside. Calling me over, he explained that he had way too many cows, and could I thin them out a bit for him? I told him he needed the services of a butcher. Not a dashing young adventurer out to seek his fame and fortune!

Passing by the various other riff-raff who were all busy slaughtering cows and sheep and chickens and whatnot, I took the road that led out of town. And it wasnt long before I spied a large hole in the ground with a ladder that led down into the darkness below.

My first dungeon! 

Gripping the hilt of my sword, I headed towards it. Only to find my way blocked by a bee. It was a level eighteen bee, but seeing as the local cows and sheep and chickens and suchlike we all level eight or thereabouts, I reckoned I should be able to take on a bee.

I was wrong. I died from multiple stings.

Now to the biz my bois,
This game has value, It will gain even more as more money flows as like all games.
Things I like (I LIKE NOT U ITS MY OPINON!)

-has lots of things relevate to other online games like it (RS, and other that faded) but... drumroll its free and has lots to offer like:inventory space (gen ammount), crafting (anything), Spells!!! free to cast and they level how nice!, KK I wont digress more you will just need to dig in.

-Has teleport spells at a resonable price from vendor

-Has a big pvp area that has nessary quests and crafting to be done, thus forcing people to visit for gain, which causes massive guild wars later iam sure hahahahHAHAHAHAHAAHAH!!!

-Bosses with different forms and different requirements to defeat!

-You can kite bosses and enemies due to LOS (line of sight) spells or distance hahah! you can sprint away.

-Has lots of potential and a great time burner that will always pay out with happy friends and guildies if u help them lol

OKAY... nuff of that boosting the game reviews etc, time to tear this baby down!!!!!
Things I dont like (ONCE AGAIN NUB MY OPINION)

-Devs reset the server wayyyy too quick like 30s and gtfo which is understandable if they say on such and such day we will conduct a reset etc (at there defense they probably have a small team working on the game so they cant do this I think...)

-Lots of rules to get you banned easily if some can persaude you to fall for it. (I havent been banned but I hear QQ about it all the time from nubs on forums)

-Gliches that are not game breaking yet but they can be if you are farming a hard boss or something rare and it drops and .. BAM! server kick you have to relogg (Good thing there UI is light and game is light any powerful PC like mine bic bois it can spark this BB up in about 20s or less, so hopefully item stays there and I dont die for some odd reason)

-Toxic players: people who report you for being silly, people who cry about the game, people who want more and more form the devs yet they dont want to help spend or give word of the game they SO MUCH love... (every MMORPG has this though so its not bad but... this game is new so it hurts the community imo)

-introduction to the game... LISTEN UP NUBS quick break down
*graveyard is death will drop everything you have (grave yard is the area above starting town)
*spells do not depelete they level up that is what the numbers mean on the spell (example 21/100 cast it 79 more times and it levels)
*token island is a PVP area you dont lose ur items u lose ur tokens u farm so hard for! IM SO HARD BRO SOOOOOOOOOO HARDDD!!
*dont waste your time leveling everything max only work on what u need and progress your characters main attributes ATT, ARCH, SORC, END your welcome nub!
*dont talk trash to people you dont know because at some point you will need help trust me!
*dont ask for money you can easily farm what you need in a matter of minutes and GUESS WAT NUBS? the game is about the grind so get used to it and enjoy and make friends

THATS IT BOIS thanks oh and BTW dont forget to level up ur sailing or you will never ride the BLACK PEARL SHIP hidden in   the deep waters of Davey Jones LOCKERRRR!",1500672403,1500672403,True,9,0,0.492361903190612793,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Although it can get very confusing most of the times, all you have to do is ask for help in chat and someone will answer your questions, all the time. The map and the design is very nostalgic  and reminds me of runescape. What I also like is how you are not restricted on one class, but you can train your skills and switch through different classes. There is Attacker, Archer, and Sorcerer. 

Pros:
MMO like runescape
Great community
Lots of things to do
Addicting
Nice map and layout
Creative
Doesn't need a nuclear computer
No classes 
Lots of different Skills

Cons: 
Disconnects sometimes
Controls and combat is not the smoothest
Confusing at the start 
Early development, so not as much features but still enough to keep you playing for 30+ hours and enjoy it.
Can be grindy, but arent all mmos?

I highly suggest this game, as it is free, addicting, entertaining, and does not require quantam computers to run it. Community is also great, everyone is helping eachother. If you are skeptical, atleast try it, you wont regret it.

- Great variety of items and monsters. 

- Soundtrack is great! My favorite is the Land of Ice soundtrack.

- You can ask for help at the global chat anytime and someone will always help you. I simply love the community!

At the start it just seems like grinding very similar to RS classic and not much else. However once you get past the starting levels and you figure out the quest lines that send you exploring; you start to see how the game, and world just keeps building on itself. From entire towns found deep in frozen caves, tons of interesting monsters, engaging quest, boss battles, magical items only earned from secret locations, and puzzles to explore the world. All this and more is what makes this game great. Making friends in this game makes the tougher quest possible and the community is very welcome. There aare hidden bosses in secret passages, magical crafting, and an incredible areas to explore. What really sets this game apart is spells and skills you can assign to your hotbar for every class. These skills can be upgraded and make the combat a lot more engaing. The PvP games are a ton of fun, with rewarding magical equipment from doing well. The developer is always in game or on discord and he is constantly taking suggestions and adding to the game which I think guarantees this game will be something even more amazing than it already is. Going on monster hunts in the boneyard (which is similar to RS wilderness) is a lot of fun and gives the game purpose. When your skills, and your friends are your best weapons, there's nothing you can't do. Give this game a chance, talk to the community, and get a player to show you the quest around the world before you deicide if this game is for you.

Wana be a mage? go for it, Wana be a Rogue? Go for it, wana be a strength pure? Go for it, Wana be a healer? go for it. Wana chill out and FISH?!! go for it. Want to woodcut and create materials threw crafting? Want to be an Alchemist? This game has so many different things to do. WILDERNESS PvP?! HELL YEAH

Anyway, i'll get right down to it. BAM Created a character, walked threw the town a bit, and the Atmosphere was actually pretty nice. Other people were playing , doing their own thing, so I said FuQ it, and adventured off on my own. THAT FEELING of starting 2d Runescape again, was there, and it felt great, still feels great. 

All in all i'm giving this game currently a 7.5/10, and it has the potential to be much higher. 



Cons: Little lag, here and there, but that's normal for new games, while they work out the server Kinks. (Remember, WoW on launch, or Runescape on 2001-2002 launch) 

Pros: Can meet brand new people, adventure, party and get LOOT.

I couldn't find places to buy higher level gear and crafting wasn't interesting since you can only craft things to help you fight to help you level up. I NEED options!! Like different types of attacks or different skills. Otherwise, why should I grind or why should I save up money if there is nothing to buy but better gear?

I happen to find this game again on the store and started thinking about my experience well playing the game. The content in the old review was from about 1-3 hours of gameplay and it was already very grindy, but I was okay with that. I remember this one time in chat when I was comparaing this game to osrs. Because lets be honest its an attempted at grabbing success from an amazing game like osrs. If you don't believe me play the game for 15 minutes and try to tell me otherwise. Anyways I was making some constructive critizism as to how the leveling system worked and the one of the devs started moaning and crying about how this game isn't osrs and don't you ever compare the two. Long story short this game really did have potential, however the devs are petty and only want people to play their game if they agree to everything they're saying.



*-------------------------OLD REVIEW----------------------------*

Very awesome and nostalgic if you like really old school runescape as the game is heavily influnced by runescape. The only real big downsides to this game is that theres no real direction to be pointed towards and quests don't give much information, however I personally like this. The other thing is the servers. I don't think the develpers expected so many players to download the game so it makes the servers decently laggy as well as an un responsive login button that doesn't tell you when the servers are you down, you just have to guess. Other than that the game is amazing and really brings in a runescape like experience.",1497817835,1518367200,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,8,False,False,False,False,,,

Written a few weeks ago prior to the full release of Orake, the game had it's bugs; which I understand were being worked on, but the game should have never been launched until it was stable. 

At it's current state:
[list]
[*]Server's are up and down, or being manaully taken down by the Development team for ""patch"" jobs. 
[*] Quest log is a chore to utilize, and is all but useless.
[*] There is not nearly enough content to keep a player ""wanting"" more initially other than to see their skills increase in level. (I understand the open-world concept, but there is nearly no story behind the world, no reason to play other than to kill a few monsters and increase your non-combat skill levels so you can wear ""X"" gear or cook/craft/alchemize ""X"" item.
[*] The game itself does not have a concrete road map, and the main developer is constantly fighitng issues w/ the server's and other core features of the game that are not functioning properly.
[*] The online store (no steam store integrated as of yet) has to be manually given to each individual who makes a purchase and this will only get more and more confusing as new players come to Orake and the lead developer is having to manually add memberships/premium coins to those accounts.
[*] Evidently they are rewriting the game's base programming language from VB6 to C++. Which I can understand the change, but that should have been completed in an Alpha version of the game, not the final 'release'; which this game is currently slated as. It is my opinion that it hasn't even reached a level to warrant it the badge of beta testing as of yet.[/list]

I still believe Orake has the ability to become a great game, but there needs to be some general changes made:

[list]
[*]A concrete Road Map / Goals system needs to be implemented by the development team.
[*] A proper bug tracking / development life cycle from the programming team.
[*] TEAM - the lead developer needs to deligate and properly manage a team of programmers / community managers / game PR managers.
   [list][*] The lead developer should allow anyone else from those that are available to handle Orake's public relations, as his abrasive and nonchalant attitude tend to run quite a few people away from the game.[/list][/list]

I will continue to play Orake, but I am not as completely optimistic in it's future as I once was.

Solid retro style mmorpg that everyone wanted ROTMG to be, aside from the permadeath

Although the game has charm and will give anyone who has played Runescape nostalgia, you will quickly run out of things to do and realize the game's problems. This mostly the fault of the main developer and his incompetence. Being a newly created game, there are a plethora of bugs and glitches, even problems that sometimes cause the whole server to crash. While very frustrating, this is expected and should, I hope, go away with time as long as people continue to work on the game.

Some of the major issues:

If a mob spawns on the same square a player is on, that player and the mob is trapped there until another player comes by and kills the mob. This can even happen in the wilderness (which functions exactly like the Runescape version), and could easily let other players set up to kill them.

The combat styles are totally imbalanced in pvp. Archery is by far the strongest combat style due to being able to infinitely kite players while firing arrows. Magic spells have too long cast times and too short cast distances so that players can simply run away if they see someone start to channel a spell. Melee is by far the worst because both the person attacking and person being attacked have to remain TOTALLY STILL for attacks to land. This means you can just run around if someone is trying to melee you and avoid everything.

There simply is not enough content at this point for the game to be interesting for an extended period of time. If you party with other players to get group xp you will be able to kill the strongest monsters in the game in the matter of a few days. At this point, it's not even worth trying to kill other players because the only reliable way is to exploit bad mechanics.

Duplication glitch. I know of one duplication glitch in this game. There are probably more...

If any of these mechanics get fixed I'll remove them from this review.

Finally, lets talk about ResBak Online. If you've played Orake, you've probably had your game crash at some point and might have seen the message ""ResBak Online has stopped responding."" A quick Google search will reveal another 2D MMO project that failed. The server and client for ResBak is available Online and after playing it, is IDENTICAL to Orake.

http://imgur.com/e0mVmTS

Literally the only difference are the sprites used. The source code for ResBak is available online for $30 is very obviously how the developer was able to produce Orake without knowing anything about or understanding his ""own"" game. The best part is that the main developer I referred to earlier explicitly stated ""I created 99% of the content in this game."".....",1494845859,1495603944,False,1,0,0.413041919469833374,5,False,False,True,False,,1495070503.0,"*Fake*
This person try's very hard to ruin the game, and try's very hard to crash the game for attention. Ignore this child.

Just to give you an idea about how much he hates Orake ...

Where to start?! OH i know! 
This game is very fu8cking  good...  while it may be still in development stage it has active players to test the new content and to help you out. At first i did not understand this game but once i got it down it was a peice of cake! The dev team is not only active but extremley helpful. They do have a few bugs but they get them fixed ASAP. 

While it may not look appealing to the young people of Steam To the people who were around during the Early MMORPG era this game will be a dream for you. It just added A pvp realm/server Last night i have not tried this realm yet i am content in my Pve. But if you are into pvp i would say give the pvp realm a go you may enjoy the pvp server. hours of training and questing and a few bosses to fight!

Do not be confused by the level of mobs this really doesn't matter. i am level 17 fighting level 30 mobs. The community itself is pretty friendly. but there is always that one person who is a total a$s Wipe. thankfully though i have not came across them yet. So if you do want a 2D MMORPG that is good and fun Plus free. This is probably the game you will want to try!

Let me start off by saying this game has alot of potential. It's a 2D MMORPG with good features and surprisingly addictive progression. 

If you like variety, no-class specific accounts, oldschool graphics and OSRS type combat then this is the game for you. With a selection of skills to train such as fishing, cooking, woodcutting etc, the game isn't purely combat orientated. This isn't a game for a quick hit, it will require many hours to progress but that's the beauty of it. 

A small community of dedicated and active players makes for a solid experience every time you log in. Staff are active, experienced and keen to grow the server. 

Now don't get me wrong, this game does have its flaws (as all games do) but the dev team is quick to assure us these are all being taken care of and they listen to the community.

Orake in my eyes still needs a lot of work, its not a perfect gae by any means, but it has a lot of potential. The owner of this game is very commited (even though some times i do question how commited) to making this game and has put a lot of work into. 

Skills - (Pro) The skills are very self explanatory, the main combat ones are Melee - Range - Mage.
            Every life skill is unique in its own way and is useful, no life skill is useless.

            (Con) Although every life skill is used for something of some importance the exp rate and the ways of getting
            need some work.

PvP - (Pro) Honestly i really have nothing bad to say about pvp, its full loot and multi (10 people can attack one person) how the pvp is setup it really flows well with the game, you can only attack players that are 10 levels higher then you or 10 levels lower then you, so its balanced to some extent.

Staff - (Pro) Theirs really only one ""staff"" member and thats the GM, it can be a bad thing at times because he cant be on 24/7 but becasue its closed beta and the community is small it works. For the most part adam (The GM) listens to the community and takes suggestions from them.

(Con) - Adam is not a coder, meaning he needs to rely on someone else to add big changes and fix some bugs, as of right now this is fine but later on i could see it being a big problem.

To sum all this up, i have ~300hours in this game and still feel no need to stop. The grind for gear is always available because no one, not even the best of the best have anywhere close to the best gear in the game. The community can be a little toxic at times but is fine 90% of the time, they always help out people who are new and give tips.",1492403957,1492403957,True,12,3,0.616036295890808105,1,False,False,True,False,,,

At first, it was a great game to kill time whenever you had it and a chance to build your charatcer in more ways than just mindless combat. From being a melee tank to a greedy merchant, you pretty much can do what you like in this open world type game and develop the skills you like on a day to day purpose. In other words, you make the story of your adventure.

Now the controls aren't the best in the world, being that the same button to melee is the same button to also interact (causing many issues when you need to access a door or a chest). Also, the npcs move quite a bit to the point where you need to play cat and mouse to interact with them. There's also no targeting monsters in this game, but you can target players for the purposes of pvp (which I think this is where the game is heading towards.). That's not all to the controls of course, but I believe those two points make it quite clear that there needs to be some thought put in if this game hopes to make it past early access and towards open beta.

Graphics wise I like the simplicity this game has because it feels like a game, and not a grueling chore or obligation. Unique animations with spells and unique monsters which leaves room to think back into the past when you played your first mmo. Also the soundtrack of this game are borrowed melodies from other games, but again adds to the nostalgia factor.

As for the community, there couldn't be a better one. Quite a dynamic and helpful community that welcomes all kinds of players, and makes you feel right at home. Admins are quite vigilant and will assist you in more ways than one. Surely there are some sore spots, but usually comes to a halt when it comes to helping a new player or someone asking a question.

Finally, the gameplay of his game is again (and sorry for repeating this word constantly) nostalgic. You fight enemies, level your combat accordingly, and proceed to the next step. Skills like mining or gathering as of a similar fashion, requiring lots of patience in order to make the gold necessary for purchasing spells or armor.

Now you maybe asking, why I feel a new low with this game after all the praise? Well, it comes to the instability of where the game stand. Gold wipes have been happening quite often, and lots of disconnecting issues and running the game. There seems to be a lot more bugs than what the devs and admin are overseeing, and with the current higher leveled players demanding for content they neglect to see the bigger picture. Sure everyone wants new content and want access to new maps and features, but those players make up the minority of what is to come with the influx of new players coming in. The principle of the matter is making the server stable enough to where the servers are running at a constant pace, and the need for maintenance is limited to at least once a week. Constant changing, wiping and having the server down can bring lack of trust to players, and the competency of the admins who run this game. Also, the controls need tweaking big time and mods need to moderate come of the potential issues that the community can fester up through frustration and inpatience, and the assistance of new players to catch up. Only then will the game grow and improve with a wider range of support and ideas. 

Other than that, this game on my end receives a 7/10. Not quite there yet, but I am hoping and I do recommend this game despite the negatives I have pointed out.

I could see this game going places. But, I'm afraid I can't say I'm going to continue with the game. There's a small community that plays, and I feel that the reason for that, is that it's all multi combat. So, if you're a new beginner like me, you could be working your butt off to PVE, and some higher level could just come by and last hit the monster and take your kill/loot; or they will just sit by you and wait til you almost kill the monster, and they will just last hit it with their high magic level (that I doubt they got legitly). One thing i've noticed, is that the higher levels in this game, will intentionally grief you. They are a bunch of man children playing the game, and will get salty literally over anything, even if you give suggestions on how they could help the game grow. Another thing that I've noticed, is that the MODs don't seem to care about the community as a whole; they only care about what the higher levels think, and ONLY cater to the higher levels. Good luck to anyone who decides to try this game. You might as well just go play Runescape, their Devs and MODs actually care about the communities opinions and suggestions.

even though you'd see alot of people in the boneyard only a few people would attack eachother as most were trying to let the new players build up.

Anyways if you're looking for a game with an oldschool style like rsc odds are this is where you'll end up because it's pretty much the best one there is.

IK theres alot of bad reviews recently but keep an eye on it and give it a chance when its rereleased.

There are three combat skills: attack, sorcery & ranged. each one with what seems to use different XP modifiers (leveling at a faster rate than others) and endurance, these constitute your overall level, which is determined by by the aformentioned skills. Atk/sorc/ranged are 8 for each overall level determined and endurance is 2 for each overall lv gained. crafting skills have no affect on your overall level, they are barely worth mentioning aside from from being time sinks and requirements for accessing certain areas with little to no relevance, as it stands with current playerbase and structure they're negligable for trade.

So I got to lvl 69 in about 30 mins, it's really simple and i'll tell you how in this detailed easy to follow guide.

・Start by naming yourself Blackguy and create your character.
 
・Once you have your character created begin counting down from 100
   (make sure you do this in Global chat for everyone to see).
The Creator of the game will then promptly begin to beg you not to crash the server and accuse you of being someone named either Sky or Benjo.

・At this point just ignore it and demand alterations to all of your stats, ask for all of your parameters to be raised to LV. 69.
The Creator will lack sufficient intellect to understand the proper course of action to take in this situation and give into your demands. 
You will be transported to a small room absent of players and witnesses that exist outside of the playable area. 
The Creator will promptly beg you (with salty tears streaming down his face) to cease all actions pertaining to crashing the server.

・This is when you agree to the terms set by him. After that he will ask you to walk forward and you will be awarded by having all of your parameters altered to 69.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         -2/10 game 2 EZ

I got to see the commands for a couple seconds, then couldn't find them again. There's no obvious button to see the commands again,
You click on things to or people to target them, but have to use the CTRL key to attack or interact with them, trying to pick up an item, it's no longer the CTRL it's the space bar. Fishing and forging weren't intuitive or smooth either.

I don't mind limited graphics, but the animations are painfully slow, it's like I've got to unfurl a wand every time I attack. 
I set it to full screen and my graphics card fan had to kick in, that doesn't make sense with an R7-260X.

I tried to get out of the first area in the tutorial by going to the door, it said to use CTRL to open the door with a key, I tried again and again, to find out later that I had to get and finish a quest to kill some rats to get the key I didn't have. 
Why didn't they tell me to go see that person to get the key? And this is your very first quest. It's a small area, but still it needs to be done better.

In the second area I killed some beetles and picked up multiple keys, they didn't stack in the inventory, so I tried to drag and drop them out of the inventory, right click, left click to get rid of the extras, nope, can't get rid of things that way. Once again if there's a way it's not intutive.

The quest window leaves a lot to be desired, click on the icon for it and you get the name of your quests. You would think you would simply click the quest name and it would tell you all about it, no, you click the name and then one of 6 + signs to get bits of information about the quest, who knows what each + sign will give you.

I've played better games than this on a Commodore 64!

Really has that classic old school RPG feeling to it. Reminds me of the old days of Runescape. The developers are always working hard to interact with the players and involve them in the future of the game, listening to ideas and taking note of issues. 

I have recently purchase a membership in the game after player 30 hrs in. for £16.00 I think its great value. 

Orake is in the early days so of course it will have issues, that is the point of a early access release to iron them out before the game comes out fully. However, although frustrating due to having small free time due to work and other comitments. The developers always seem to fix them and get the game running in no time. and usually give players something back for the downtime, which I think most developers wouldn't even think twice about. 

Adam the creator of the game will personally answer any questions you have and will always do his best to help with any issues. 

So I ask you before you write about this game or leave a review on this steam page. Play the game, speak to the community and I ensure you will find it impossible to leave a bad review. 

For all those who have. I can truthly say you have done it in haste without even playing the game, or giving it the chance it so well deserves. Plus its free so shove it up your arse if you dont like it you bloody cheap skates. Go back to mind numbly paying £90.00 for COD doing the same thing over and over again and investing in games which just bring out the same content with a different look. 

Hats of to these guys, they are brining old school back to the masses.

Here is a list of characteristics I found attractive in the game:

-Game has oldschool 2d graphics that any oldschool gamer will appreciate, you can see your armor change when you equip something, same for your weapon.

-Variety of skills which are leveled through grinding but you are not hard locked into HAVING to level  them, you progress as you feel like.

-No restrictions to classes, you can choose to level any of these three and kind of ""specialize"" in a mage, ranger, warrior or a mix of two/three.

- Leveling feels impactful, you get significant upgrades when hitting thresholds of levels.

-Community is small but amazing.

-Developer is active in game and with the community.

-PvP is fun and has rewards/risks, there is a specific zone that has good loot but is open pvp with a level range in which if you die you lose your items (which I like VERY much).



Things I did not like about the game were:

-Couple of interface and functionality things like not being able to withdraw stacks of items or lock into nearby enemies.

-Clunky combat controls but the game being in such early phase gives me hope it will be worked out before full release.

All in all I believe if the game gets polished and frequent updates are a thing it will garner a big niche community.

What I found was the kind of MMO that you'd see 10 or so years ago, and I mean that in a good way. This started as one man's labour of love. He's no expert at game development, but he laid the framework for all the non-coding stuff in the game.

Orake looks and feels like RS Classic but with a more experimental interface. Bugs often occur (in Early Access) but they're fixed within the day. Content is shoved out like planks from a lumber mill, but it's good content.

This game is not going to be one of your top 10 favorite games. It's not going to try to beat the competition. It's not going to bleed you dry of your money and laugh in your face.

Orake is what it is - a Work In Progress of a game that's going to end up being what Stardew Valley would have been if it was based on RuneScape instead of Harvest Moon.

Also what i like is that crafting items (like cooking) is instant and crafts X amount instantly as well, unlike runescape where u have to wait forever per item.

Edit:
After playing it a bit more and doing research, turns out game is another game with engine used as a cookie cutter for people to buy.  A lot of things are stupid ideas or need to be polished. The combat is really stupid. You need to press CTRL (the only button aside WASD) you cannot use your mouse for combat. In addition, to hit someone via melee attack u need to be facing the target and standing in front of them, then press ctrl. This means pvp is not worth it. Because CTRL is the universal button for everything, when you have a Bow and try to talk to a NPC u always fire an arrow.
PVP is terrible, Spellcasting is not worth it, if the target moves out of range the spell stops casting. Melee is not worth it because you both have to be standing in front of eachother and stay perfectly still. Bows seem to be the only way to go for PVP.
I cant find a way to remove quests from my log using the interface. Also I could not find a integer counter sort of thing in the quest details, i noticed one pop up in top left corner when i got a required kill.
I've also heard the Devs dont know what theyre doing. This seems to be true since not much has changed from the original game. The thing is, I am COMPLETELY OKAY with this if the Devs are willing to learn how to script in w/e language i used by this game, and are willing to learn what makes a game playable and enjoyable. In this sense I am ok with the game not being as great as id hoped, because its a learning game.",1476801163,1476913660,False,6,1,0.508636832237243652,4,False,False,True,False,,,

THIS GAME IS GREAT.
This reminds me of alot of retro RPG's and it has a lot going for it. The servers may be hit and miss sometimes, but the helpful and welcoming community make up for it. The dev is active alot and is always there to help.

There is one bad thing that as of the 14/10/2016 I believe need to be adressed.

-Key remaping : alot of game use the F1 - F12 system and alot of them allowing key remaps to suit your style. This game doesn't, as chat such as guild and global use chat command keys like ' and ; this is ok, but other players tell me there are trade chats and this doesn't have a key, which is annoying. I own a laptop and use it ALOT, even for gaming... but the F keys bring me out of games I am playing and that can be frustrating. So I remap them. The limited options in this game is a minor, yet definite thing that needs updating.

Other than that the game is great, and could do great things, it just needs a little something more.
I highly recommend this game to any fan of RPG games and as this game is FREE you really should just download the damn little thing and give it a test run.

I've got about 14 hours on my account for this game. And i'd like to give my review towards this.

Below, i'll be giving you my Pros/Cons about this game.

A little info on what type of games I like: I grew up around games like Ultima Online, Runescape Classic, EverQuest, and even played some MUD's. I like to give games a chance, even if they don't appeal to everyones needs. Usually, what you'll find me playing is old dated games, even new games (Don't get me wrong on this) But I like games with old time graphics. 



Pros -
-The Community  is very great. They'll help you out no problem. You're stuck on something? ask. They'll help you the best they can. And i'm speaking about players within the game. 

-The developer (Only one i've seen so far) Does play the game quite often. And will answer to your requests. He's the 
type of Dev that you'd like to have in most games. 

-Skilling. This game has a wide range of skills from you to choose from. You can train Mining/Smithing(Which is called Crafting for some odd reason?)Woodcutting/Fishing/Alchemy (And some others.) This right here alone is something I give a + for. Seeing as I played runescape for a while. So if you got that itch to go skill. Try this game out.  

-Player created Wiki, This is probably one of the best things I like about this game as well. Part of the community got together (or some) and helped each other create a wiki for the game to help out the new players who really want to get into this. (This is also a Con which i'll explain under 'Cons'

====================================================================================
-Cons The game server disconnects every hour or so. Now, i'm not here to complain about this one bit. This game is still in testing and it's expected to be like that. Due to their VPN.

-An Actual Forum. They have about 3 forums sites which out of honesty, I don't know which one to go to. (In terms of which is most active/recent)

-Player created Wiki. Even though they're creating it and it's in work. This game has been out for some time (from what i heard) Possibly a few months? anyways. It's not completed much and could use a lot more information from players who are experienced and still play the game.

-Death Text 'You got fucked up' is a message you recive once you've died. I mean c'mon now. Can we get this changed? I know it's something small, and out of honesty I should not really be complaining about this. But hey you never know if kids are going have an interest in this game. That kind of pushed me away from this. What a joke.

-The developer. Although, he does speak to the community. He's not quite Mature on what he does. For an example.
Someone was apparently 'ddosing' the server, which honestly you could not even tell the difference seeing as the game is always going down every hour or even 30 minutes. As he was saying these 'Threats' The  dev was not taking this seriously. He'd literally joke with him, asking the community if he should 'ban him, or not' This is another thing that drove me away as well. Something like this isn't right. If it's a game you created, and you're a Dev. You should handle these type of situations more Accurately. Instead of joking around. 

Let's get more into this situation.

The suppose 'Hacker' requested to speak to a player, and spammed the game. The 'Dev' created an account with the player name, that the 'Hacker' wanted to speak to. And they literally Roleplayed. Like seriously? Who does that. Roleplay with a hacker who's over here threatning to take down their server. This was cringe. What should of been done is actions far more sooner. Then to mess with him.

-Server up time/downtime   This game goes down far to often. Due to their 'VPS? or VPN' Apparently their VPS? or VPN goes down every 30 minutes/1 hour. And it randomly happens. You don't know when it's going to happen till it actually does.

-Devs don't really inform players when the game is going to be down for a certain amount of time. Upon checking the forums here seeing as they have 3 forums and literally they're dead. This game has been down for about a day + and no information has been even added towards in on their 'Community Sub' How did I find out about it? a player had said it on that sub that the game was down due to VPS  problems.

-Game Client, When you've downloaded it, it has a site that'll apparently take you to their forums, but that link is dead. They should get that fixed. 
====================================================================================

Final Statement: after reviewing most of this, I'd have to say to possibly stay away from this game until some things are done/changed/acknowledged/taken seriously. This is a great game, and it has Potential for us players who are seeking old games. For us players, who are looking for that MMO Itch that we can't seem to scratch.

The community is friendly and so are the devs, and i appreciate that they listen to the players feedback on the game. The map is small, but the game is updating every couple days and new items and areas are added so it is always exciting to see the new content.
The only part of the game I am not a fan of is the controls. I don't mind the moving controls, but holding the CTRL button to attack and gather is extrmely tedious, and would be nice if they changed it to a less dull way to attack/gather.

PROS
-Simple to understand
-Fun to explore the small world
-Friendly developers and players
-Graphics are nice
-Tons of stuff to do, crafting and gathering, fishing and cooking, pvp and tons more
CONS
-Tedious gathering/attacking controls
-Quite a bit of bugs
-UI is a bit weird (Like having your items equipped in your stats menu)
-Unstable servers

So far this game is an 8/10, but I'd definitely reccomend this game to anyone looking for a new and fun MMORPG game to play!

As an avid MMORPG player of over 12 years, I have spent many months and many games trying to recreate the feeling of awe and excitement I experienced during my first steps in the MMORPG world. This game is the first time that those feelings were recreated for me. 

To start, this isn't a AAA game. Don't come in to the game expecting amazing graphics, flawless game design, lack of bugs, amazing AI, and interesting in depth lore. If that is what you are looking for, you should turn away now. However, if you're looking for a charming little game, with a vibrant and friendly community, helpful and cooperative developers, and exciting game play that reminiscence of the past, please check this game out. 

Some pros:
-Decent graphics, if you're in to old-school 2d games.
-Extremely active and helpful developers, who are very open to feed back.
-A fun non-toxic community. Honestly this game has the nicest community of any MMORPG I have ever played.
-Very frequent updates (you can expect an exciting medium to large scale update every week)
-Very frequent bug fixes/balance updates (every day the devs work hard fixing issues reported to them)
-A classless skill system (think Runescape stat system)
-Tons of things to do! Explore, train fishing, wood cutting, craft gear, enchant items, kill bosses, fight other players in PVP, kill regular mobs, become a merchant, do quests, chill and chat with other players etc.
-Loot based pvp system. Kill another player and you can collect their gear as reward.
-Guild/party systems.
-The game is ENTIRELY FREE! No need to spend ANY money to enjoy this game.
-As a result of the above point... There is NO Pay To Win aspects. Finally a game where your real life wealth doesn't affect how good you are in the game. No pay to win, pay to progress, pay to advance... Not any form of advantage at all can be bought. 
-Probably more that I am forgetting.

Some cons:
-The control system is... tedious to say the least. The game could use a major re-design in terms of the way controls are handled. Unfortunately the devs are currently very much against re-designing the control system so it looks like we may be stuck with it for a while.
-There are a lot of bugs, however devs are working hard on fixing them as they pop up.
-The servers are unreliable. Expect to be disconnected at least once a day until this is fixed.
-Dev team is small and indie. Due to this, certain updates/changes to the game may be put on the back burner for long periods of time, and take a long time to fully develop.
-UI is hard to grasp at first (and honestly it IS a little confusing... hopefully they re-design this to be more intuitive).
-The community is really small at the moment. 

Over all this game is a 8/10. If they fixed the controls then I would easily change my rating to a 9/10, but the controls do hold the game back from its full potential quite a bit. Hopefully this is changed soon and I can update my rating!

Hope to see more players join this game! If you need some food feel free to hit me up in global chat - I play as a fisher/cooker merchant.

there is suppose to be some big updates for pvp to even the playing field for people,

The staff have done nothing but add updates daily and fix bugs sometimes in real time based on player feedback, I have witnessed over 10+ updates and usually multiple updates every day.

Also the art style is very relaxing for bit art and the artist updates the UI, FX daily.
I feel I should add that this is not pay to win and the dev team have made it clear that they will allow member items to be tradable to non members

-Bank chest bug out on you when you have ranged gear equipped and make it so you lose arrows and are unable to open the chest
-Crashes constantly
-Control scheme of the game opens up as soon as you launch character into the game but disperses if you press any buttons leaving to confusing if you didn't read all of it

People have an issue with the fact that this game used to go by another game. That's not entirely true. It's the same engine, which was bought by Orake, and turned into something else. This isn't the first time a game has done this and it won't be the last. If that turns you off from the game, maybe you need to evaluate something in yourself. The first game failed, and this game simply took the engine and made a better one.

I would appreciate it if the developer [adambrosio1] stopped telling all his players to come harrass me over Steam friends or this review. I am going to report you for harrassment.

If you cared so much about what people thought of your game maybe you should actually spend some real time and effort working on it.

It's not my fault your game is a rip off. I'm not the one lying to everyone saying its amazing and so much more will come when we know it won't because you didn't create any of it in the first place. I wouldn't have even written this review if you didn't constantly lie to your playerbase. The only reason why you care so much to downvote this review and tell players to harrass me, is that you can't actually fix your game.


REVIEW START:

I played this game before it came out on steam and had the opportunity to speak directly with the lead developer. Although the game has charm and will give anyone who has played Runescape nostalgia, you will quickly run out of things to do and realize the game's problems. This mostly the fault of the main developer and his incompetence. Being a newly created game, there are a plethora of bugs and glitches, even problems that sometimes cause the whole server to crash. While very frustrating, this is expected and should, I hope, go away with time as long as people continue to work on the game.
 
Some of the major issues:
 
If a mob spawns on the same square a player is on, that player and the mob is trapped there until another player comes by and kills the mob. This can even happen in the wilderness (which functions exactly like the Runescape version), and could easily let other players set up to kill them.
 
The combat styles are totally imbalanced in pvp. Archery is by far the strongest combat style due to being able to infinitely kite players while firing arrows. Magic spells have too long cast times and too short cast distances so that players can simply run away if they see someone start to channel a spell. Melee is by far the worst because both the person attacking and person being attacked have to remain TOTALLY STILL for attacks to land. This means you can just run around if someone is trying to melee you and avoid everything.
 
There simply is not enough content at this point for the game to be interesting for an extended period of time. If you party with other players to get group xp you will be able to kill the strongest monsters in the game in the matter of a few days. At this point, it's not even worth trying to kill other players because the only reliable way is to exploit bad mechanics.
 
Duplication glitch. I know of one duplication glitch in this game. There are probably more...
 
If any of these mechanics get fixed I'll remove them from this review.
 
Finally, lets talk about ResBak Online. If you've played Orake, you've probably had your game crash at some point and might have seen the message ""ResBak Online has stopped responding."" A quick Google search will reveal another 2D MMO project that failed. The server and client for ResBak is available Online and after playing it, is IDENTICAL to Orake.

Literally the only difference are the sprites used. The source code for ResBak is available online for $30 is very obviously how the developer was able to produce Orake without knowing anything about or understanding his ""own"" game. The best part is that the main developer I referred to earlier explicitly stated ""I created 99% of the content in this game."".....",1471995490,1503167330,False,193,20,0.82421422004699707,25,False,False,False,False,,1483596899.0,We are making a new engine from scratch :) + when the game was up all of these where fixed.

The GM talks like a child, and has multiple staff members with multiple accounts. Of which multiple people also know their login details for said accounts. Take for instance the past week or 2, 30+ banned players by an unknown/inactive GM account. During all of which the people who could unban decided to do nothing. 
Let's also not forget the items lost on their market system. 

Owner still owes his old coders money and still insists on sending his minions to my Discord/game to troll and cause a scene for the 3 seconds they survive with our active moderators/admins.
