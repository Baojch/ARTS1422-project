You can see my earlier review below, but now that the game is out of EA I can change my recommendation to ""Yes"". The game is still a stand-your-ground wave shooter, which many people do not care for and are fatigued over, but it also isn't as expensive as most. For only $10, it's a very polished shooter with a very nice steampunk theme to it which I really like. One of the best parts of it is the local leaderboard that asks for the player's initials after every round, which makes this a great party game. My only suggestion (other than add some new weapons) would be to add in a Daily Local Leaderboard or something. Many of us will get all of the top 10 highest scores as we own this game and our VR stuff, but for the people that come over to parties and such, they are going to be new to VR and this game, so it's going to be very tought for them to even beat our lowest score on the leaderboard. Let us start with a clean slate so that friends and family have a chance.

*Early Access Review* The visuals and steampunk theme are great, the shooting feels fine, the audio is cool, the enemy types are enteresting, but I still can't recommend this game as it seems that the devs have moved on. I made a post on the Steam discussions about this and they even responded talking about how they are still working on it, but that was months and months and months ago. Back when I first got this, standing, wave based shooters were par for the course in VR and this one was one of the more interesting ones, but now half way through 2017 that's just not the environment.

And here we are 4 months later and once again silence from the devs. At this rate it'll be a LONG time before this game really reaches a recommendable state, especially now with more and more quality VR games coming out to spend your hard earned cash on instead.

OLD REVIEW:
This game is really fun. The art style is great, unique and it feels really polished. Even with just the 3 different enemies it already feels like a decent amount of variety. I love how it really keeps you moving. The difficulty quickly increases from round to round which is a HUGE plus for me. I love Space Pirate Trainer but I do hate having to sit through 15 minutes of ""easy mode"" before it finally starts to get challenging and fun. Also I'm really digging the main type of enemy's weapon. They give you a short warning and then shoot out a constant beam. It ends up almost being like security lasers a la unseen diplomacy or old spy films but now you're having to duck and weave through them whilst shooting robots. Loads of fun. It also has a cool reload mechanism that plays off of a risk and reward type model, the time it takes to reload exponentially grows the longer you wait to do so. All this really helps set it apart in a sea of wave shooters for VR and given its extremely fair price tag of $10 I'd definitely recommend this bad boy even in its current state but also can't wait for future content.",1469994278,1492312653,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True,False,,,

The problem is with the stupid gun and levels. Why the heck do we need to ""decompress"" before shooting? The action is slow in the first level but becomes far too intense in the second level -- the ""decompression"" of the gun makes it virtually impossible to dodge, fire at bots, and ""decompress"" the gun. You really need to remove the stupid ""decompression"" of the gun and make the stages a little more progressive. Each stage should be just a little harder than the last, not 200% harder. I'd be fine with the difficult levels if the gun would shoot without decompressing.

So it finally happened!  The game has been completed!  While it's just two more levels that are similar to the original one, they are well designed, the difficulty is increased and they each have surprises.  The graphics have also been improved.  Either way, this game was worth the asking price when it was released last year, so now it's just that much of a better deal.

*Edit: June 11th 2017
While most bad reviews state that this game has been abandoned, that's not been proven yet.  It's just taking the devs a VERY long time to update.  The 1st major update is due this month (which will probably actually be a few months from now :P) and I am very excited to play it.  Either way, even if the game wasn't updated, it's STILL worth the asking price in its current state.  I know there are many games in this genre for VR, but when the presentation and game mechanics are as good as this game's, it needs to be aknowledged.  Sadly, this remains one of the most underrated VR games.
