[h1]Minha Opinião[/h1]

Foi nostalgia pura para mim. A Apogee tem jogos que me fazem reviver a infância em um simples e humilde windows 95. Quase sem espaço, meu pai fazia questão de trazer alguns jogos para mim a cada final de semestre. Em um deles ganhei uma mini coleção com os jogos da Apogee e Hocus Pocus foi o que mais joguei (infelizmente só possuía o primeiro episódio) mas me recordo com carinho que meu pai e eu competíamos de quem terminava mais rápido e completava todos os itens.
Muito bom reviver estes momentos.

[b]Positivo[/b]

- Divertido
- Vários níveis e modos de jogo
- Alguns chefes acabam sendo complexos
- Músicas divertidas
- Nostalgia para quem jogou no inicio dos anos 2000 (lembro de tê-lo em um disquete amarelo!)

This game doesn't take itself too seriously and has some hilarious writing. It's a fun action-platformer with nice balanced difficulty anda great soundtrack. It runs a bit smoother compared to Duke Nukem I & II and the game is constantly keeping you moving. There are a lot of secrets to find if you're into that and there's never a dull moment.

As you can see from my play time it takes about 6 hours to finish if you're just going for a casual playthrough.

I must note however the Steam version seems to have a couple of issues with it if you try to play it straight off the bat. Fortunately these are easily fixed with a bit of tweaking.

I recommend: 
1. Rolling back to a previous version of DOSBOX to stop the stretched image issue (they should honestly update the program to simply use it to permanently resolve the issue)

2 Going into the install program to change the music to use MIDI for better sound quality. (better yet, use VirtualMIDISynth and get the Roland SC-55 soundfont for the best experience).

3. Using a program such as JoyToKey to bind all the buttons to a controller.
My layout on a SNES controller for example:
A confirm
B jump
X Main Menu
Y fire
Start Save Menu
Select Restore Menu
R Raise Screen
L Lower Screen

And that's about it.

The game is broken down into four 9-level episodes. The first, which was shareware back in the day, is worth playing. The other three basically repeat the first episode and then repeat it some more. The enemy sprites vary, as do the backgrounds and music but gameplay is very repetitious and gets stagnant quickly. Levels are long and poorly laid out. You'll end up lost frequently. You might end up needing a silver key to unlock a door in one section but you have to go up and down three elevators to get to it and then you have to remember the correct path to get back. You can spend 5 minutes or more on a level without remembering where you need to go or what you need to do. And when you figure it out, you have to find your way back.

Unfortunately, the whole DOSBox thing is really complex - especially for those of us who don't want to dig into Linux stuff.

In some cases, it's no problem.  I'm perfectly willing to spend ~$5 to re-buy a game I like.  And some of the ones that Steam has re-done seem to work fine on the Deck.  I originally tried to port them in from GOG, but that was a never ending nightmare, with lots of effort for limited success.  But the ones in Steam just work... kinda.

The first one I tried, ""Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure"" works fine, looks good (for DOS) and plays well.  So I was encouraged.

Hocus Pocus however, doesn't display correctly on the Steam Deck.  It's too ""tall"" for the screen, and about half of it is cut off.  I've tried about a dozen different resolutions, and they all look exactly the same.

Near as I can figure it, it's not so much the resolution as the aspect ratio that's the problem.  It appears that Apogee did some voodoo with the graphics that was very non-standard (not uncommon, as ""standards"" were very fluid at the time).

Now in fairness, when I installed it on the Deck, it DID warn me that they hadn't got the kinks out of this one, but I was hoping it was minor glitches I could live with.  But with half the screen missing, that's not an option.

So I'll be uninstalling and hoping for a future fix.  In the meantime, it still works fine on the PC.  And it's POSSIBLE it might be do-able on the Deck with an external monitor.  I haven't tried it because if I'm going to use a big monitor, I'm going to be on the PC anyway.

Hopefully most of the other ones I've got my eye on will work.  For this one, I'll probably just check from time to time to see if they've developed a fix for it.  But with these old games, it's unlikely to be worth the time and effort.

Who knew it would take another 28 years to finally cross off the object of my childhood virtual desire. Yeah those were much different times: nobody I knew had a PC nor had any idea what it was, consoles were rare and expensive, arcades were main source of high-end gaming, and next door burger joint down the hallway sold them for todays 1.4 cents (at 3x the size of Big Mac and probably 10x the nutrition). For comparison Hocus Pocus costed $25! As ZX Speccy child, seeing images of this game in a PC magazine completely gobsmacked me for another year before we could afford our first PC. Of course by then HP was but a distant memory, covered by layers of demon corpses from Hell and pushed aside by who knows how many new games that appear over that short time period. But when it comes to games I'm like an elephant and rarely forget.

I'll start by saying no one except nostalgic diehards or gaming journalists will enjoy this game today. It is simply not compatible with modern gamer expectations. To me however it easily beats the likes of Hollow Knight by a mile.

It plays like those charming early '90s platformers with all their ups and downs. Story is written by non other than Tom Hall and exceeds expectations set by contemporary platformers of the day. In short, an aspiring young apprentice is set with a task of passing 4 trials before he would be allowed to join the Wizard Council and claim the heart of his crush in marriage.

Each trial is basically an episode consisting of 9 levels each, with a boss at the end as usual. Levels take 10 minutes to complete on average and are rather large and labyrinthine but not so much to require a map. They are filled with non-respawning enemies (thank fakkk), treasures (for high-score and 100% checkmark), healing and upgrade potions, switch puzzles, a hidden treasure room, and 4 to 9 orbs you must collect to complete every level. Your only available tool is infinite supply of a single magic spell that shoots lightning bolts, either directly in front or up, plus temporary upgrades for it lasting until the end of the level or for a few seconds.

What I like about it is it's simple to play and fun with just right amounts of challenge and duration before getting overbearing. Progress is bread crumbed with story bits delivered by NPC Council Member appearing in most levels and, in a more elaborate form, at end of each episode. With a dash of innocent past-time humor, just like the good ol' days.

Couple of things that make it stand out even today is percentage based health (no 3 hits and you're dead), high audio/visual level variety (every set of 3 levels is thematically different, with rare repeats), manual saving (although it only stores level and high-score). There's also lots of goodies to check out via in-game menus as well as a scan of original manual in install folder.

Now for some cautionary head ups to illuminate what you're getting yourself into:
[list][*]Steam downloads 3D Realms music pack in ""\SteamApps\common\Alien Carnage  Halloween Harry\"" sized over 800MB. You can listen to them but they are not in relation to the game and can be freely deleted manually.
[*]Game comes with dev build of DOSBox which isn't set up optimally: wrong aspect ratio and potentially game breaking window size if your vertical resolution is lower than 800p. See ""aspect=false"" and ""windowresolution=1280x800"" lines in ""Hocus.conf"" respectively.
[*]Your only weapon has no autofire (or rapidfire) and DOSBox mapper doesn't support it either, meaning you have to press fire for every single bullet. Exception is rare upgrade that only becomes more common later. It was so incredibly annoying it prompted me to create a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793485055]standalone autohotkey script[/url]. Although I ended up using it only in W4-L7. To make matters worse game limits how many of your bullets may exist on screen at one time.
[*]Gameplay is capped at 18 FPS no matter what. You can somewhat make it less janky by increasing speed in options but that also makes enemies move and shoot faster. I suspect most who lasted this long will momentarily give up on this game lol.
[*]Puzzles predominately rely of trial/error switch combination locks, without being given any clues whatsoever. There are about a dozen of 4-binary position locks and many 2&3 ones. At least combination is always same but expect to hate this mechanism.
[*]Later levels place doors and keys to unlock them in opposite sides so it comes down to luck if you took the correct initial path or you'll have to backtrack through now empty platforming sections.
[*]Despite boasting with over 30 monsters, game only actually uses glorified reskins of 6  enemy types (slow/fast melee, ranged, 3 flying types) although they are rather nice looking reskins. Animation however is pretty bare bones in all cases, as is reaction to damage and foreshadowing attacks for modern standards.[/list]

Surprising even myself I managed to overcome it all, including autofire, and I'm a stickler for details so maybe it's not that bad.

Charming relic of the past that still holds some value to equally charming living relics of the same era I guess. At best I dare recommend is grabbing it in a bundle to reduce risk and/or regret.

First, the positives: the visuals are solid enough, and the music is quite good (once you figure out how to enable SoundBlaster music in the game since it's not on by default for some stupid reason). The visual design of levels also varies quite a bit and is colorful and mostly pleasant to look at.
As far as actual level [i]design[/i] goes, however, it is utterly uninspired. The game is a basic collectathon platformer, you have to find a certain amount of ""crystals"" to finish a level. You also have to find keys to unlock doors, which likely means a ton of backtracking unless you know the level layouts by heart. The actual challenging parts of the levels, however, mostly consist of jumping over pits and shooting enemies over and over. And I [i]do[/i] mean over and [i]over and over and over[/i]. Quite often you'll find the [i]exact same[/i] platform jump + enemy fight combination repeated ten times in a row or so. And sometimes there's not even a challenge at all, just jumping up a gigantic flight of stairs for a few minutes for no reason whatsoever. Combined with the backtracking and the fact that enemies [i]don't respawn[/i] (which may perhaps be a strange complaint, but in this game it would actually make some sense), the levels become incredibly boring after you've seen a few of them.
The enemy designs are fairly basic as well, they can either walk or fly, and some of them can shoot. The enemies have a lot of different sprites associated with them, but outside of hitbox size and movement patterns, they all fall into the above basic categories. This is in stark contrast to [i]good[/i] platformers like Mario, Mega Man or Sonic, where each unique enemy sprite has unique behaviours associated with it as well, and unique strategies to approach and fight them. Here you either spam the fire button, or the jump and fire buttons together.
The only unique enemies in the game are the boss enemies. However, their design isn't particularly great either. Unlike every other enemy in the game, they kill you in [i]one hit[/i], making boss fights into these weird timing puzzles where you have to position yourself in a way that lets you shoot the boss without it making its way towards you, quite often having to run back (but only a small bit, or else you won't be able to hit the boss offscreen!) to prevent damage, only to find that you ran too far anyway and now you can't deal enough damage to the boss to kill it before it reaches you.
Overall, a very generic experience, so I'd say don't buy it unless it's for the nostalgia factor or you're really craving an old platformer for some reason. That said, the game is very cheap, so if it still sounds like your type of thing despite everything you read here, you might as well go and grab it to see for yourself.",1632567694,1632568805,False,8,0,0.579363167285919189,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The nostalgia wafts off of this classic like the smell of weed at Ozzfest. Of all of the Apologee games I played in the mid to late 1990's, this was one.

It's not that there's anything special about this game. The graphics are expectably dated, the plot is ten pages of text and mostly nonsensical humor, and the music drones after about the second level. Apogee released a bunch of platformers at the time, and this was a solid game for its day. It's not a bad game even twen... nearly thirty years later.

The controls are a bit stiff, but you gotta play it with your keyboard because that's how we did it in those days. Play the first level the way it downloads for the pseudo authentic midi chorus; then add ""setup.exe"" into your Hocus.conf file at the end right before the Hocus.exe, and switch the music to ""Sound Blaster"" for a more tolerable musical experience. Burn an entire afternoon on this gem and delight in the sheer waste of time that was my teenage years.

Verdikt: Hra Hocus Pocus je plošinovka, v ktorej sa hráč zhostí role začínajúceho čarodejníka, respektíve učňa. Jeho cieľom je zložiť skúšky, stať sa členom Rady čarodejníkov, zosobášiť sa so ženou menom Popopa a pomôcť čarovnej krajina Lattice. Jednoducho nič originálne, až na to divné meno nevesty. Hra je rozdelená do štyroch kapitol. Každá z nich obsahuje deväť úrovní, kde je potrebné vyzbierať magické kryštály a na konci poraziť bossa. Týmto procesom je hráč sprevádzaný čarodejníkom Terexinom, ktorý sa pasuje do role mentora. Úrovne pôsobia pekne, no niektoré z nich môžu spôsobiť nevoľnosť. Behom ich zdolávania hrá hudobný doprovod, ktorý je kladom a taktiež záporom hry. Niektoré skladby sú nepočúvateľné. Obtiažnosťou je hra určená skôr nenáročnému publiku, respektíve tomu mladšiemu. Herná doba sa pohybuje okolo štyroch hodín, no aj za tak krátku dobu hra doslova nudí pre jej stereotypnú náplň. Hra Hocus Pocus je nevydarené kúzlo alebo doslova nepodarený herný pokus.

I loved playing this game back in the 90's when it first came out!  It has a fun little story, decent soundtrack, and I think pretty nice graphics (for it's time anyways but still looks pretty good IMO).  It's pretty simple you jump, move left, or move right as you explore each level.  There's a certain number of orbs you need to collect to complete each level and usually a gold and silver key to unlock certain areas.  There is a timer and if you beat it you get a bonus.  You also get a bonus for finding all the treasure in each level and most if not all levels do have a secret bonus treasure room that you can find.  I think that's my favorite part is exploring every part of the level and finding everything... and if I really like a challenge doing it all within the bonus time limit and full health.  Like any platformer like this it can get a little monotonous or boring if you try to finish through a bunch of levels at once.  I usually play and replay 1-2 levels at a time trying to beat the time and get all the treasure.  If you play a couple levels  at a time it's pretty fun.

En su época, era una maravilla visual y sonora, con unos vistosos y colorídos gráficos y una musica muy pegadiza. Desde que probé su versión shareware el juego me encandiló, y pasé mis buenas horas recorriendo laberinticos mapeados en busca de las bolas de cristal mágicas.

La historia del juego nos lleva a encarnar a un aprendiz de mago llamado Hocus, el cual deberá superar varias pruebas para ser admitido en el gremio de magos. Las pruebas consisten en atravesar peligrosos mundos laberínticos poblados por numerosos enemigos de variadas especies, los cuales trarán de impedir que recojamos todos los orbes mágicos que los magos de la academia han diseminado por ellos. Una vez los consigamos, pasaremos a la siguiente prueba. Y si podemos, nos haremos ricos por el camino recogiendo cuantos tesoros encontremos.

Para ayudarnos en nuestro viaje tendremos un amplio surtido de pociones mágicas, que nos otorgarán poderes temporales tales como supervelocidad de disparo, salto alto, disparos potentes y la capacidad de teletransportarnos a lugares secretos. Porque los niveles estan llenos de ellos, los cuales deberemos encontrar para conseguir la maxima puntuación.
Tambien contaremos con pociones curativas que regeneran la salud, conjuros de disparo extras para poder disparar mas proyectiles mágicos a la vez y unas llaves que abriran cerraduras de su mismo color.

Hocus Pocus es un plataformas de la vieja escuela, con grandes niveles llenos de recovecos, peligros en forma de pozos de lava, fuego o pinchos, y muchos enemigos con diferentes tipos de ataques y disparos. Muchas secciones estan cerradas con puertas que necesitan llaves o con palancas, las cuales habrá que colocar en una posición determinada para poder avanzar. Hocus cuenta con una barra de vida y si esta se acaba, habrá que empezar el nivel de nuevo.

Teniendo en cuenta la longevidad del juego, su gameplay es muy básico, y acaba por hacerse rapidamente repetitivo. Su diseño de niveles no es nada del otro mundo, y muchas veces peca de repetir durante largos tramos del nivel un mismo patrón de plataformas, por lo que a veces pueden hacerse algo cansinos. Por otro lado, los enemigos tienen pocos tipos de comportamientos y ataques, lo cual se camufla con cambios de apariencia, pero en esencia hay 4 tipos de enemigos y ya está.
El control de Hocus es algo tosco, y hasta que aprendemos a controlar su inercia y su velocidad al caminar, nos costará algunas muertes y perder mucha vida en el proceso.

Hocus Pocus es un juego simpático, que en su momento fue una maravilla. Es entretenido, y una vez aprendamos a controlar al personaje, iremos pasando los niveles tranquilamente, con algun que otro pequeño desafío puntual, como los niveles finales de cada capítulo. A pesar de su repititividad, lo sabe camuflar con una buena variedad de entornos gráficos y apariencias de enemigos, que sin ser nuevos, le dan un poco de aire fresco durante las partidas.

Lo recomiendo a los nostálgicos sobre todo, que lo jugaron y les gustaría volver a hacerlo, aunque si has jugado tantos juegos de plataformas hasta el dia de hoy, Hocus Pocus quizá te parezca un poco simple y hasta sosete.",1532295959,1532295959,True,7,0,0.582191765308380127,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm just gonna leave it at this for now. Likely, if you're even looking at this page, you know what you're looking for. This is just an old classic PC game.

It's fun, it runs through DOSbox so it'll probably always run perfectly for you as long as you can run DOSbox, and it's pretty fun. It's not amazing or anything, especially considering the mild jankiness of the controls, but it's not a bad game.

An example is, you ever play Super Mario on NES? You remember how he like gains momentum as you hold down left or right or whatever? Hocus Pocus (because that's the name of our hero here because of course it is) does not have any kind of momentum at all. You start moving at full speed and stop instantly.

Обзор входит в серию большого исследования 3D Realms Anthology включающего в себя 32 ретро игры от прославленного создателя Duke Nukem и Shadow Warrior. В этой серии обзоров я не буду что-то оценивать и писать плюсы или минусы, будет лишь общее описание вперемешку с моим мнением. Палец вверх или вниз будет показывать лишь, то понравилась мне игра или нет и не более того.

[h1]Описание игры:[/h1]
Платформер 1994 года выпуска. Игра состоит из четырех эпизодов в каждом из которых 9 уровней. Мы играем за молодого волшебника который может стрелять магическими разрядами. Перемещаясь по уровню попутно уничтожая врагов и собирая монеты мы должны отыскать определенное количество магических сфер, чтобы перейти на следующий уровень. На последнем этапе каждого эпизода нас ожидает битва с боссами. Отдельно хочется отметить великолепную музыку, удобное управление и вообще игра получилась превосходной. Прошел все четыре эпизода с огромным удовольствием и ставлю игре два больших пальца вверх.

So, after many years, what's it like coming back to it, and finally being able to play it through the end? Well, let me say, it brought my childhood back! Hocus Pocus still holds up as a solid platformer even after all these years, with some very good level design (as well as great backgrounds for the different areas), a great retro soundtrack, and a lot of variety in enemies.

As many games back in the day, most (if not all) levels include secret areas, and after each level you get a bonus if you collect all the treasure, which encourages you to explore; not to mention there's also wizards spread around some levels with interesting (and sometimes funny) comments regarding your situation.

As far as the story goes, it's quite simple; you're a wizard trying to prove yourself to your superiors, and to the love of your life. Even then, it's a good story, although it exists mostly in the form of text after you beat each chapter.

So, to conclude, I'd say this is a worthy platformer. Even though it's quite retro already, it's nice art-style might make it easier for new people to get into it, so go ahead and give it a try.",1455738236,1455738236,True,15,1,0.668640077114105225,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Just like Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, Hocus Pocus is also not exactly one of Apogee's best works. The game's biggest flaw is its level design, which is quite bad and relies a lot on repeatability (jump on a platform above some lava, kill enemies on another platform, jump to that other platform, kill enemies on the next platform, repeat a lot more times - as an example). Also, enemies are mostly the same in comparison to each other, there's very little variation, many of them have the same behavior while only looking different.

Even then, it's still good, classic platforming fun with some challenges to beat. Apogee has made some much better games but this is still worth playing.",1450493802,1450493802,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
-Brilliant writing from Tom Hall, the man behind Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of the Triad, and Anachronox
-Simple gameplay that is easy to grasp
-Fantastic pixel art graphics with interesting environements and monsters
-Four episodes with distinct end goals
-Some great retro PC music
-Interesting boss fights
-Lots of in-level secrets

Cons:
-Movement in general is somewhat jerky and jumping takes a while to get used to
-There are only really 5 types of enemies: projectile enemy, charging enemy, flying enemy, flying downward projectile enemy, flying sideways projectile enemy.  The rest are all reskins of one of the above
-Occasionally reused level tilesets are letdowns
-While simple, the gameplay becomes tiresome if taken in large doses- can become repetative!
-Switch puzzles are lazily designed and are only defeated by trial and error busy work

After revisiting the old classic, do I still find it to be up to par with how I originally felt about it?

Half and half.

A great port. The game is still just as fun as it was back then, though I'm willing to admit I may have the nostalgia goggles on. The levels are well designed, with a desirable and challenging but fair difficulty curb. I recommend.

It's a fairly standard 2D platformer, which is full of childish fun and ramping up the difficulty provides traditionally difficult gameplay from that time. You run around killing monsters to collect the globes on each level to progress, and there's nothing more to it.

A timeless classic, choc-full of nostalgia for somebody like me. I really am glad I got to experience this on Steam and revisit my childhood.
