Also, the price is a bit steep for what's really being offered. So what is being offered? 

Four rides (lasted me a total of 14 minutes to experience all of them) of varying fun factors and lengths, each with low resolution/low textures, each with no interactions, and each have the same ride feeling. I guess that's what's missing most from the game, you don't ever really feel like you are in a rollercoaster. In fact, I never felt the butterflies in my stomach or the euphoria you would feel if you actually rode in a rollercoaster. The rails as you are whizzing by also don't look very good (they blur or they look very slow .. depending on where you look).

The scenery and rides from best to worst (IMO) were 1) Mega Kinda Ka - nice outside park with rocks that bring a nice surprise 2) LIberty - the statue of liberty needs to look better though 3) City 4) Euthanasia - starts out looking very good, then a big disappointment, poor graphics really bring immersion down here.  

However, every single VR scene and ride were better in Russian VR coasters.  This dev obviously hates America.  I'm joking ... or maybe not.

Rating 4/10 should be a .99 cent game then I could tepidly recommend and overlook its flaws",1505871857,1505873021,False,8,2,0.657359302043914795,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Straight off the bat i have to say this is only just recommended (damn you steam for having such a binary review system). The Price is the deciding factor here, for this price a lot can be overlooked, just understand this is not a title you will be coming back to frequently, if you are short on cash or tight of budget then but the money towards a better title.

[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]
There are 4 coasters, though one is very very bare. The others are a little bland but there is still the cool factor of whizzing through skyscrapers(and freefalling from one track to another).
You are not alone on your coaster, there are two other passengers who scream in a way that suggests they may not be having as much fun as they should be and when you look behind you they seem to be showing no emotion at all which is a little un-nerving lol.
The rest of the sound effects did add to the experience however, from the thumping of the track to the sound your cart makes when it lands on the track in the skyscraper level.
There is a few areas where the trees cross into the track but nothing too major.

[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
No issues here 

[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
It is a roller coaster, i mean you sit there and ride it, intuitiveness is not really an issue lol.


[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] It is fairly priced.
[*] The skyscraper coaster is done well.
[*] A cool little vr experience to show non vr and non active friends.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] Some of the coasters are very bland.
[*] The terrified screams of the people behind you is a little off putting (they really are not having fun lol)
[*] The lack of animation and emotion on the people behind you is strange (but then you do not look behind you often)
[*] It is not something you will load up again and again to experience.
[/list]


[b]VERDICT[/b] 
Not a glowing review i know, this is an experience that i recommend only if you go into it with your eyes wide open and know what you are getting is not amazing but just three ok roller coasters (and one acceptable one) and a fun way to show vr off to non vr and non active friends (before wowing them with more active games) If it was not so cheap this really would be a not recommended title.I do feel that with more work it could be a lot better.

My Thoughts:
I have seen worse VR Coasters and I have seen better! - This may be extreme for 1st timers and as an oculus owner for 7 months only 1 section had me on edge. ALSO I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it offers.
