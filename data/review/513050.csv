-Movement is clunky at best and impossible to use in combat (There is touchpad locomotion but its so slow that it feels like the game is punishing you for using it)

-In game floor is too low to grab anything off of it
-Enemies just rub up against you until you die 
-Get stuck inside walls in close quarters
-Straight up having parts of the tutorial REMOVED if you go the ""wrong"" way
-Game teaches you to reload on a gun that never needs to reload

This game does do things well though. I really like how climbing works and having a visible player model is really nice, and not only that, it feels like it moves accuratley to your real body (could do with having some sort of adjustment for really tall people though).

I was almost going to give it away at the start thinking it was another one of the crap games these bundles provide with the loco etc.

Lucky I didn't this game is great, once used to the arm swinging loco it's quite good and works with the climbing that this game has, there are bugs but as part of the bundle I got it in it's expected.

I actually got a half life 2 feel as I worked my way through the sewers. Why this game is not talked about more, I'm not sure but it's certainly better than a large number of the 167 VR games I own so far.

So if you've tried it at the start and given it away, go back and stick with it for a while it's well worth it.

Giving this 4 indie bundles out of 5.


Edit: thinking about it, the name of the game sucks and would put me off buying it probably why I  didn't know about it until I got it in a bundle, The whole ""maze"" thing I avoid after a couple of shit VR maze games.

The deep atmosphere and level of immersion  really made me feel part of its world. While still being a bit rough here and there (which is to be expected in early access) it's focus on exploration and puzzle solving rather than combat only is a very refreshing take on the whole ""VR Shooter"" theme.
Regarding the controls I can say that I wasn't a big fan of the ""swing arms"" movement option at first, but after a bit of getting used to it, I felt that it offered a much more precise and more immersive way of moving around. I would definitely suggest everyone to give it a try.

Have only played the first level so far but it does give you a sense of scale, and has good variation. I like the overall atmosphere and would recommend this to those who are a bit fed up with wave shooters by now.

I do not expect this title will ever offer up a very smooth and polished experience, but do hope the developers keep adding levels and focus on offering up new envrionments.

Played it several times over with 5 other friends.
Just loved the arm-swing locomotion(though there are some bugs).
Here's some things I'd like to see in future updates:
-- Less picking up objects from the floor(Such as ammo, health and whatnot)
-- Check points(It sucks to die so many times and hv to start all over again)
-- Multiplayer(Really looking foward to play PvP with this locomotion system) 
-- Greater variety of enemies(Not enough enemies imo)
-- Greater variety of gameplay mechanics(puzzles, secrets, easter eggs, collectables and etc.)
-- More pockets(only 4 pockets doesn't give me enough inventory to work with)
-- More Guns(A whole lot more only found a couple, and with bad feed back))
-- Enemy dismemberment!

Locomotion does need work as my body keeps on moving after I stop.  To be fair though, I am using Oculus and devs havent implemented native Oculus support yet so im sure that plays into this aspect.
