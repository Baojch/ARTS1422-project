Pourquoi? Parce que le jeu est assez classique sur la forme : sauter, glisser, gauche, droite. Parfois, il y a quelques variantes, genre scènes de combats. Le jeu est amusant.

As a narrative, forget about it.  For some reason, you're a werewolf escaping a ship and something else is chasing you, though it's not quite Temple Run.  As an auto-runner, it's capable, but not really demanding.  At most, you'll be guessing at a few sequences, but once you know it, it won't surprise you again.  Most of the enjoyable aspects of the game, being running fast and avoiding obstacles, are what you'd expect - you juke left to right collecting datapackets or avoiding obstacles and you jump or duck at the right time to grab ziplines, dodge lasers or leap across gaps.

The downsides that can turn people off are first and foremost the quicktime events which constantly interrupt the flow of the game, the werewolf sections where aforementioned QTEs are ignored, but you still have to watch them play out, and the absolutely atrocious music.  Also, there's just an understatement of thrill in this game.  It [i]should[/i] be exciting and has some wonderful set pieces, but to be quite honest, it's a little flat.

It relies on quicktime events for combat. 
The werewolf aspect is just a silly gimmick. (It does nothing to enhance the game. and makes combat just silly cutscenes you're forced to watch.)
I think this game was meant for kids, because everybody bleeds green blood. 
The music sucks.
The story is really bad. (The whole story is you trying to escape a spaceship while a telepathic woman, who is helping you escape keeps telling you she will explain everything - eventually. She never does. You escape the ship, she tells you she will eplain everything... to be continued! Yep you get that kind of ending.  But it is obvious that this game is never going to be continued.)
Finally, the game just makes no sense. It really is a type of game where the gameplay is hurt by having the story and world that it does.

I will say that in this one case, I actually found controller to be easier than mouse and keyboard but normally it's the other way around for me. Despite that, the game is still just as much fun as I remember. 

Things happen so quickly in this game and you really don't have much time to decide what to do so it's basically testing your reflexes to see how you'll react. You might make a mistake the first time (or even the first few times) but eventually you'll get to the point where you can get through most obstacles with no trouble at all. The storyline in my opinion was really interesting even though there's not a TON of story to it and overall - I just really enjoy playing this title.

That said this game is not bad at all if you're into runner games. It has the same feel as Temple Run on Android (three lanes and 90° turns), but plays in first person. The story mode offers 12 levels with good chalenge. The levels are quite short (2-3mn long), but they are quite challenging and fun, there are also some QTE when fighting guards. There is also an arcade mode with infinite randomly generated levels.
This game is now quite old and the textures look a bit dull, but in counterpart it will run at perfect 60fps on recent hardwares.

Because in this game, your character will be automatically running and this game is all about reflexes. Involving dodging obstacles in your path and fighting enemies with button reactions. Its simple, get through them and dont get killed until you reach the ending.

Theres also an ability that turns you into a wolf, which can automatically kill your enemies without button reaction but you still have to dodge obstacles. You also have lives and theres checkpoints along the way. If you waste all your lives, you have to restart the level. Pretty fair honestly, and if you want a challenge you can do hard mode.

Furthermore, your character is unarmed. He's a pretty good fighter but its not like you will do anything other than button reaction. No guns, and literally you have nothing (not even clothes!). You are just a naked person running through to the end.

The game is pretty fun, though I do have some bit of criticism on it. Such as the area being too dark at some levels (as in the lights being very dimmed, not the darkness part (which has in game but funny thing is its more clear than the lights being on).

TLDR: Poor execution of first person running with jarring camera, QTE oriented gameplay, ugly looking engine. The werewolf inspired movements do not mesh with the the sci fi parkour universe. The resolution support and Xboxpad support was a nice touch but not enough to save the value of the title.

Audiovisually poor. Recycles assets. Has this strange filter on top of everything which makes things look like a CRT. No reason for it. Narrow corridors where you have to QTE your way through obstacles and foes. Control scheme takes a bit to get used to. You can run out of lives and have to start from scratch. Cutscenes unskippable.

Well, normally I do not enjoy platformers nor running games, because most of the time I fail in these genres. But this game has [b]werewolves in space[/b], so I thought I give it a try. And I never regretted it. 

Pro:[list]
[*] WEREWOLVES IN SPACE - they are so cuddly
[*] Nice graphics, nice cutscenes
[*] fluid gameplay, no frame rate drops
[*] parcour themed, 1st person, not too hard
[*] QTE combat system fits the game perfectly
[*] varied level graphics fit a humongous spaceship
[*] Arcade modes, Collectibles, Challanges, nice Trading Card Graphics
[/list]

Con:[list]
[*] Could have more werewolves in it.
[*] Werewolf mode is mostly a bonus level - a bit of wasted potential
[*] Turning mouse gestures sometimes a bit sluggish -> running into walls
[*] Story could be a bit more fleshed out
[*] Ends in ""to be continued"" - a bit of a downer
[*] Game was completed on easy within two hours

There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles). 

There is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.

Running feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.

The arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.

Infinity Runner seems unusual upon first hearing the pitch. It’s a game about a prisoner trapped inside a massive spaceship who is suddenly freed one day and seeks to make a run for it. However, this isn’t your everyday criminal — he’s also a werewolf. Yes, it’s patently ridiculous but also kind of cool. How does this runner stand up in comparison with the rest of the genre? In Infinity Runner, players are given a first-person perspective. Everything is seen from the eyes of the prisoner/werewolf sometimes including his naked arms and legs. Still, the basic mechanics of a platformer come into play. Timing is paramount to staying alive, as one wrong move will see you toasted by lasers, falling into the dark void of space, or worse.According to the plot, spaceship Infinity is the largest ever built. Yet there’s not a ton of variety amongst the seven different sections. Each section contains two levels within it and they regularly boil down to incredibly dark, tight hallways. They’re all interspersed with traps that will either sap bits of health or offer a one-hit kill. Every trap has a trick or two for successfully avoiding it. This might include jumping, sliding, running left or right, or combining actions to stay safe. Infinity Runner starts off by explaining how to handle new obstacles, but a couple are never explained which leads to a little trial and error.Mainly it is facing actual enemies that tweaks the formula. Stopping them revolves around Quick Time Events which seem semi-randomized. Thankfully, you’re given some breathing room in regards to how long you have to enter a combination. Get one thing wrong and you’ll be sent back to the checkpoint. A slight change to this formula comes when in werewolf mode as it is nearly indestructible. As a werewolf, enemies no longer pose a threat and are automatically taken care of. A handful of modes are included, although none particularly change up the formula. Story mode provides players with a narrative while running through levels while arcade mode challenges them to get the best score. Multiplayer mode is much the same, except that multiple people can play at once. None of them are actually seen, though, so it’s mostly asynchronous fights for leaderboard supremacy.Beyond the werewolf and first-person perspective concepts, there’s not too much that makes it stand out. Visuals are serviceable, but never get a chance to shine thanks to copious hallway scenes. One special feature is that Infinity Runner can be played with an Oculus Rift. I can’t speak of how the game runs from that perspective without owning the device.Infinity Runner has a fun, unique concept that isn’t utilized to the fullest. Dodging obstacles would be more rewarding if the difficulty ramped up alongside story mode. Instead, it reaches a certain level and stays there depending on the initial difficulty selected. There’s simply no urge to keep playing if skill isn’t being tested. The droll sci-fi storyline only goes so far and its runner mechanics have been done better before. Owning an Oculus Rift is the main reason to buy it, as the device is currently lacking in platformers. Still, there are likely better-than-average titles right around the corner.Overall 5/10.",1437405036,1437405036,True,0,0,0.472560971975326538,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Bad premise, gameplay, structure. The entire game you have no control, it's just somehow believable that you are on some ship and spend the entire time running around endless corridors and attack guards in the same way. I know if I was trying to do something I wouldn't be running as fast as possible endlessly through corridors.....how believable is that? The endless running doesn't even work. Every corridor and level looks and feels the same. Combat is boring, you hit WASD and click the mouse, although the buttons aren't even on the right corresponding spot on the screen, W which corrisponds to the top of the three buttons will be on the buttom right of the screen and A which is on the left will be after W on the top of the screen, not well done. Every fight you do the same thing, either attack 1 guy witht he same button cues or attack a group of three guys the same way with the same button cues. I guess the only way the game couldn't suck as much as it does is if it serves as an oculus rift demo game. 

The jumping and sliding are stupidly programmed to right and left mouse click, which don't make sense and aren't intuitive, compared to space and C/ctrl, meaning when you have to decide to jump or slide last second, you have to think and remember every time, which is which, which leads to death due to poor game design. The jumping and sliding don't even work well. When you jump you are in the air for super long. I would jump something and by the time I finally landed I would be at the next spot to do something or it would already be too late to do something because the jump was unnecessarily long. Since jumping and sliding last forever, this means you have to actually do them way before it makes sense to, or you would do it any fps or platform game. Turning corners is done stupidly as well, as you move your mouse to the apparent side, instead of right and left buttons like A/D. This leads to you moving the mouse and it not counting because you didn't move it enough, or any other problems that makes it finnickier than it needs to be. You onyl get 3 lives per long running level, and if you die you have to restart everything all over again, which encourages repetition and pads game length, a dump idea. There are these cards but they basically do nothing, it makes it almost impossible to get an extra life from them, they should have made it easier or make more sense, so you have a point to collecting them. The game also doesn't use obstacles right. At certain points something like an explosion would happen after another one, but it wouldn't happen until I was already at it, and it would hit me from the side before I could react. The only way to beat this is to repeat it and know its coming to dodge it. How terrible for an endless runner to just auto kill you until you remember to make a movement before the cue is on the screen and give you enough time to do it.....that's their only job. At other parts, you don't know what movement to make. Certain times fire or smoke or some random thing you haven't seen will pop up and they for some reason don't make it apparent what you should do, meaning you have to take a random guess or die. This happened 2 times back to make, meaning I died and lost all my 5 min of running at that level. This means I had to restart the game from the start of the entire level because the game decided to spring instant death gambles on me. How could they screw up the basic ideas of a runner game. Not really much positive to speak of unfortunately. Multiplayer is 100% dead and arcade is just replaying the same levels. The game is boring, they mechanics aren't done well, and gameplay is flawed.

It has huge potential but fails in almost every basic aspect of the gameplay. The core mechanics is simply a fast reaction game. You see an obstacle - you need to press a specific button. If you fails, you run from the checkpoint. 4 fails and you need to restart the whole level. Simple as that. The problem is, the obstacles are pretty much never recognizable. Eventually every time I saw a new obstacle I needed to die few times just to learn how to dodge it. After I knew it, it never was a challange anymore. This is another problem: when you go out of lives on a new hurdle, you need to replay the whole section which is a sea of boredom now, when you know handle it.
But, with all the things above, it would be a moderatly fine game, the controls are well responsive, the visuals create a really tense atmosphere, I had moments of enjoyment. 
The real killers are QTE scenes. I tell you, it's the worst implemented QTE I ever saw in a game. And I saw quite a lot of bad QTEs. Let's give an example: in the middle of the run you see something on the left. If you think that it's obstacle and press right - well your bad, the key was right mouse button - restart! Eventually on the second try you wait with clicking anything, and, eventually, you see the right mouse button sprite. Awesome, you click it. Now you have a second to press next button - ""A"" is displayed. Wait, ""A""? It will be backward, no!... Too late, restart! Not to mention, the whole UI for it is terribly unreadable, you have a second to press a button, yet you need some time to find the new button on the screen and then to process, if ""D"" means left, or maybe right... (I know it may sounds silly but believe me, in a span of the second, it's really hard to process those things, and it's super annoying since it's the mere core of the gameplay)
To write anything about other aspects of the game: The story is not engaging, not at all, it lacks any strong characters or plot, sounds are very annoying, however I really like the music and the mood overall.

There aren't many games like this on the PC and it's not 'with good reason' really, either. I could understand disdain for this if it were endless, or if there were exploitative microtransactions. This game has neither. It has a level structure, and it even has difficulty settings which affect the game in very interesting ways. Also: It's a bloody werewolf on a spaceship, you miserable old sadsack. What more could you ask for?

To throw some more details into this ball of words than that -- it's similar to endless runners on the tablets, except not at all. The level structure and controls (which feel rad) make it feel very different, it's more 'inspired by.' So the end result is a game that has more in common with SkyRoads and '90s PC shareware games than it does Temple Runner. That's not a bad thing, since Temple Runner and its ilk are 'pay to keep going' games. This is a 'be good enough to keep going' game. And if you're simply awful at it, well there's an easy mode for you, too (as I mentioned!).

Minor complaints:
Plot doesn't amount to anything. Twice the female character is about to reveal some major plot twist and twice she gets cut off, the game slapping a ""TO BE CONTINUED"" in your face at the last moment. Pointless.
Music is kind of awful, especially in the Docks area. Aural assault. Awful.
Occasional lag issues.
Multiplayer is non-existent basically, yet required for a few achievements.

Major complaints:
The entire game is trial-and-error based. Lots of stuff that you have basically no reaction time to see coming, lots of rooms with non-obvious solutions that you have to throw corpses at until you pass. Also, you have limited lives. And the levels are all several minutes long.

Basically, no. That is inherently bad game design. There was no salvaging it at that point. The limited lives and abundance of ""gotcha"" moments are the only challenge this game provides though; except when the controls don't work (I've had slides and jumps fail numerous times). There's no difficulty here that feels like real difficulty, just fake difficulty that makes it unpleasant to play. 

A lot of things aren't graphically distinguishable either; in some areas it's near-impossible to tell which direction to turn until a fraction of a second before you need to turn. The falling sections of the game have mines in them which are practically impossible to see on the black backdrop of the section, too.

And did I mention the game is repetitive as all hell? There are 4 times in the game where you run through a bonus area that is ALWAYS exactly the same. There are 3 times where you skydive through a section that is ALWAYS exactly the same. Every wolf section is basically a minute-long cutscene as there's only one way to die and once you figure out how to wall-run (which is, naturally, presented wrong; it shows mouse click and then holding A/D but you're supposed to press them the other way around, nice job there...) there's no challenge to it. There's almost no new obstacles presented past the third world aside from some badly-designed ""figure out the sequence"" rooms that tend to be non-obvious more often than not. There's a QTE boss at the very end of the game (which is... not very good). And that's basically it. 

There's a smaaall bit of fun to be had with this initially but it wears off quickly and the problems with the game show through pretty quick, too. Stay away, I'd say.",1425614723,1425614723,False,3,0,0.486589282751083374,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+ [i] Infinity Runner’s[/i] gameplay manages to capture the same gameplay as games like [i]Temple Run[/i], and adds a couple other elements such as quick time events to make the game fairly challenging at times, by making you rely solely on your reflexes to complete the game. 


[h1] Negative [/h1]

- The voice acting here is very amateur (I’m assuming it’s the same voice actress as [i] Master Reboot[/i], combined with that annoying echoing at the beginning of sentences still present here), as well as the dialogue. The music also is probably some of the worst music I’ve listened to in a video game in a long time; bland and forgettable techno music
- Unfortunately the graphics also are subpar at best. The textures on the environments are low quality and muddy, and the 3D models are also pretty poor; topped off with the repeated sections of the corridors you run through simply being uninteresting as well leaves much to be desired in the graphical department
- Even at its short length (1 ½ hours on Normal difficulty), the game still does manage to be pretty repetitive. You will see the same gameplay sections (with the exact same QTEs as well) many times throughout the game; having a bigger variety in the sections or more levels would’ve been welcome.


[h1] Verdict [/h1]

“While the game is very short and has little to no story, the focus on gameplay makes the game--at the very least--fun. I bought this game for about £2 and I feel I got my money’s worth, but I don’t really think it’s worth much more than that. Considering how few infinite runner-style games there are on the market at the moment, this one is at least acceptable in terms of quality and enjoyment.”

Not to mention the out of the ordinary concept of werewolves in space. I also enjoyed that there was plenty of obstacles to overcome by various methods such as sliding, quick time fighting sequences, jumping, and ziplining in human form and climbing on walls, crushing enemies with ease, and even breaking through walls in werewolf form. However, I noticed some things that I just could not brush off. For instance, after you have completed the first two sectors, your female friend in the game no longer follows along with the words that are being spoken by the voice actress. Its like she has mind of her own and it is telling her not to open her mouth. Also, there's not alot of ways to take down an oppenent. I don't expect the werewolf form to have many ways to take down an enemy (due to the fact a werewolf is a raging beast) but, I do wish the human form had more fighting styles since your main character was trained to be a deadly living weapon. The story is okay. Not the best story ever told but it does fill in the gaps (most of them anyway). The final issue I have with this game, and is also the biggest issue, is the controller support. I see most games give you more options in order to change the button layout to your own comfort level and they don't mix and match buttons in order to keep throwing you off, but that is all you ever see when you play Infinity Runner. For instance, you are given three configuration choices depending on your controller and what you feel most comfortable with: one for ps3, one for xbox, and one that is custom. The issue starts when you are in a fighting sequence against the guard when it tells you to press the press the A button, it actually means that you have to press the RB button. What!? The layout for the buttons is scattered all over thet place! When you press X, it actually means Y. When you press LT, it actually mean the start button. This was so unbearable that I had to stick with the playstation configuration becuase most of the buttons were in the right order. The only two buttons that switched places was R2 and R1, as well as L2 and L1. This was the most frustrating part of the entire game. Overall, my final verdict for this game is a 7/10. Infinity Runner is a over the top, sci-fi based, parkour simulator that has fast paced gameplay that will leave gamers wanting more of the adrenaline rush.

I don't own an occulus rift, so I can't rate it on that experience. I can however rate it on its gameplay.

I find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator. 
That said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds. 
Yes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival.
I rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.

I wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you? This is a game meant to be played for about 20 minutes at a time, and is very satisfying as that. RUN!",1420850482,1420850482,True,12,1,0.582491755485534668,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Normally for a game this short I'd say the price is a bit high, but it's a game based around being fast, so. It also has to be commended for having a silly premise but making it work by playing it straight; way too many games start with a wacky idea and then constantly push it with zany humour until you're sick of the entire thing.

The flaws obviously weren't enough to stop me playing, but they're worth noting: I don't think a game like this really needs a lives system, it would probably be enough just to dock your score when you die. There were a few rare instances where I failed to dodge an obstacle and kind of just clipped through it instead, which was helpful but probably something that might need fixing. The biggest flaw for me was that the voice actor (there's really only one with a speaking role) runs through her lines faster than a werewolf through a spaceship.

The game concept is pretty easy to get a grasp of. Automatically run down a corridor dodging obstacles by hitting buttons at the right time. Left and Right to dodge left and right, click to jump, right click to slide, look left or right to turn down a corridor. Sounds simple enough in theory, right?

You'll quickly begin to notice problems when the environment starts falling apart on you. While the asthetics are cool to look at, the different chatoic elements often leave you with no way to reasonably discern what button to hit until it's too late. It turns the game from a fun, adrenaline fueled thrill ride into a frusturating chore of trial and error. 

The particular bit that sticks out in my mind was where you ripline past two droids that are firing at you. The second droid gets in your way, and you have to drop off the ripline and slide under it. However, you can't slide until you've hit the ground, and it's really hard to tell when you've hit the ground in this game because of your extreme forward momentum and the first person perspective. It took several tries to figure out what percise moment to hit the button, again through trial and error.

This combines with controls that just aren't responsive enough. I have a pretty good gaming PC, and I turned my quality way down, and it still felt like their was a slight delay on every button press. It wouldn't be so bad if you wern't going so fast.

Another person might be able to look past these flaws and get immersed in the experience. For me, the above issues consistently ruined my immersion.

Infinity Runner is a frenetic action game where you get to be a runner in a tunnel. That's the best way I found to describe it. In the menu you have that typical console message ""press start"" which concerns me. To be truly honest throughout the gameplay I always felt I was playing on a console or a mobile device. Infinity Runner has a simple concept, do the right thing at the right time and that's not enough for me. The ""Stunning Graphics"" are not stunning at all to say the least.

I tried to look out for the best in this game but it's truly difficult, the script is poor, the voice over bad and gameplay just... non-existent. It doesn't do any justice for the PC Gaming.

Pros
- if you like it straightforward, Infinity Runner is just that
- it's intense, it gets to a point where you have to focus a lot, it's challenging

Cons
- the graphics, maybe I wouldn't point this out but as it's listed ""Stunning Graphics"" I have to say, no, they're not
- pressing the right key at the right time while collecting what seems to be useless files, not enough for me
- it feels like a poorly done title, cheap, rushed for consoles, basically a port",1405355118,1405362359,False,48,0,0.528824508190155029,7,False,False,False,False,,,

Infinity Runner could be passed off as a ""Temple Run"" clone on first impression, but once you get into the game you'll discover that Infinity Runner offers much more than just that. The game keeps throwing you into interesting set piece moments and new obstacles to keep you on your toes. The game is set in the first person perspective and that helps the player get a good sense of the game's speed. 

The graphics aren't bad, but they do look dated, comparible to the end of the PS2 era. Though it may lack in high poly models, or high resolution textures, it does feature some nice particle effects, and though the graphics are dated, they do look good for what it is.

Overall Infinity Runner suprised me by how much I've actually enjoyed this game. It's streangely addictive, and the set peice moments of the game are quite exhilarating.

Pros:
- Addictive game play
- Set peice moments are exhilarating
- Story is suprisingly well fleshed out
- Lots of features to explore

Cons:
- Dated graphics
- QTE combat
- Might be too simple for some",1405353643,1405390655,True,72,2,0.645354270935058594,5,False,False,False,False,,,
