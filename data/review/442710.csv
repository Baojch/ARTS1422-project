Fantasy Tales Online ist ein schönes Beispiel dafür, dass selbst kleine Indie-Entwickler (das Team besteht aus 3 Personen) ein MMORPG kreieren können, wenn sie nur entschlossen genug sind. Und das scheinen die Jungs vom ""Cold Tea Studio"" definitiv zu sein, denn davon auszugehend, dass ""lediglich"" eine hauptsächlich ""Library""-Engine wie die Slick2D Engine für Java-Codierung verwendet wurde, haben sie es weit gebracht!

Ihre Musik, als auch ihre Grafik beziehen sie extern und das nicht zu knapp. Aber genau das macht den Flair von FTO aus. Man spürt förmlich die harmonische Zusammenarbeit verschiedener Komponente, welche eine hervorragende Atmosphäre für ein RPG schaffen.


Nachdem die Server nun unfreiwillig seit einer ganzen Weile offline waren, sieht man, auch in den Streams der Entwickler, ein wenig Hoffnung aufglimmen, dass das Abenteuer bald wieder weiter gehen kann.

Музфка - ну славная, хотя я порой включаю что-то своё на задний план, убирая игровую.

1. BANKS - once you place stuff in them you will never see that stuff again!

2. PING - for such a small game the ping is random from red or green to yellow to green to red to orange, constantly!

3. LOOT - Does not feel rewarding and does not feel worth the fighting effort you put into it.

4. Skills/Abilities are buggy and delay all the time

4. DEAD - never seen more then 4 players online (#6, #7, #8, and #9 are why)

6. I don't think there is PvP in the game.  If so, one of the handful that don't with Online multiplayer, but if there ever was, that +5% Health +5% XP +25% Magic Find for subs are a bit grey lined P2W...I know its small in bonus, but well these days...

7. Abandoned - nothing has been done and nothing is getting fixed

8. $19.99 For a starter pack?   ROFL are you kidding me?

9. Monthly subscription?  What does this DEV think he/she has the next WOW?  You don't even need the next WOW, but you do need to work to earn money for subs.  uh duh?  The DEV does not even maintain the game to deserve any kind of subscription base.  Hard work could deserve something, but what you offer and what you do for what you charge ...No!  won't work...

10. So many more bad things, but why bother continuing.  The list would be more than anyone is willing to read!


Even for a JRPG and even for Early Access this should've never been released yet and with a subscription this is not even worth a $5 starter pack..I mean come on!

+1.0 if bank and various other bugs for baseline things get fixed

1.) You must have a fondness for pixel graphics that will let you forgive obvious lack of animation or sprite quality.
2.) You have no problem playing solo or have compatriots from other places willing to join you.
3.) You don't mind repetitively clicking a button and not investing any mental effort in the combat mechanics.
4.) You are not expecting any sort of real story or lore.
5.) You are not expecting an endgame or any kind of real ending.
6.) You are willing to fiddle around with unhelpful maps and keybindings.

You'll probably enjoy the game then.  It is free.  There is not a lot of variety but the devs make the most of what they put into the game already.  The puzzles are somewhat creative, there is plenty of quests, leveling is easy if you get the epic loot from the abandoned player islands (money to buy loot is extremely easy to accumulate as well).

Não estou dizendo absurdos, eu joguei mais de 380 Horas e parei de jogar normalmente em janeiro de 2017, desde então continuo sendo o Líder da 2° TOP Guild do game (Os 3 servers contam como 1 só, mas são distribuidos por causa do lag) e a unica BR que tem terreno lá. Dez meses depois o jogo está igual, mas agora tem mais lag para os brasileiros.

COISA ÓTIMAS SOBRE ELE: Ele em sí, é um MMORPG como qualquer outro de mundo aberto, mas basicamente semelhante a DOFUS e WAKFU mas com graficos mais simples. O jogo conta com 3 classes (Guerreiro,Assassino e Medico) com habilidades próprias para cada um e que dão benefícios para cada uma delas.
GUERREIRO - TANKER - Tem o benefício de usar 2 armaduras ( Assassino/Medico apenas 1) e são bem eficientes com armas de duas mãos ou espada e escudo.
ASSASSINO - DAMAGE - Tem o benefício de usar DUAS espadas de uma mão ( Guerreiro/Medico apenas 1) e infligem quase 100%/Crítico depois do LvL.20.
MEDICO - MAGO - Tem o beneficio de usar assistentes nas batalhas (Qualquer monstros vencidos revividos de acordo com LvL do Player e do Monstro) e curam seus companheiros e a sí mesmo, porém são os mais fragéis.

O game conta com uma variedade grande de ITENS tanto para ARMAS,ESCUDOS,ARMADURAS,CAPACETES E BOTAS, quanto para itens de DECORAÇÃO. Siim, você pode comprar uma casa em uma das cidades residuais e a sua Guild pode ter uma Mansão, literalmente. As RAID ou Calabouços são para Guild pois são apenas 4 de diferentes niveís e a ultima jogadores que começam agora nao conseguem fazer sozinhos. O mundo é bem grande com umas 100 missões que chegam a dar itens exclusivos, mas eles pararam de desenvolver a segunda ilha que iria almentar ainda mais o game. Prometeram uma classe nova de arqueiro e também não saiu até hoje. Resumindo o Jogo é OTIMO MAS OS DESENVOLVEDORES PODERIAM VOLTAR A DAR UMA ATENÇÃO!

1º - Trava muito. Eu geralmente em quests saio correndo ignorando os inimigos e as vezes quando eu passo para a outra tela o meu boneco dá um tipo de rollback. E aparece em uma tela que já havia passado. Acredito que seja por conta de não poder passar dentro do inimigo. Mas o jogo demora a entender que eu fui trapado pelo inimigo. Isso irrita demais.

2º - Demora muito para carregar as telas do jogo. Toda vez que vou passar de uma tela à outra demora uns 30 segundos carregando a outra tela. Mesmo as que já passei.

3º - A mecânica de ataque é muito ruim. Muito difícil atacar o inimigo, pois há um delay bizzarro onde o personagem segue a presa por 1 minuto para então decidir que quer atacar.

- Steam achievements

Cons:

- Enemy sprites are small and I would like to see them in better detail
- Lack of information on enemies and items that can be gathered
- Lack of players
- No achievements in-game (from what I can tell).
- some autopathing issues
- Just going up 1 screen from the starting area takes you to aggressive monsters that hit for a lot more than necessary.
- Targeting an enemy and pressing space to attack doesn't work most of the time.

Started playing last week and I'm hooked.  It's a classic sandbox style MMORPG complete with 3 base class types, essentially, wixard,  rogue and warrior.  Some character customization is available, and there is a small, but incredibly useful skill tree for each class.  There are guilds,  player designed houses,simple puzzle dungeons, and multiple cities from which to aquire goods or quests. Your quests will be primarilly killing mob types, locating npcs or turning in dropped loot items.  
If you want a more social experience, the Diamond shard is constantly populated by other players, but there are shards with kess traffic, for those of us who prefer our game world quiter.  

There's no tutorial, but it's pretty easy to figure out.  Grinding is possible, but doesn't appear necessary.

There is a shop to spend real world currency, and a subsription option that unlocks a few items such as additional hair styles, etc.  I've not needed to spend a penny on this game, but I enjoy it enough to consider doing so.

The graphics aren't taxing for most PCs, but a solid internet connetion is essential to prevent FPS loss.

My only gripe, the game window is pretty small.

Update:  I am still fond of this game, but the level cap of 40, which is obtainable rather quickly bothers me.  Also, it is not P2P or P2W, but many home furnishings must be purchased with real money before being crafted.  There are sneaky little microtransactions that you won't NEED, but will seem justified by your efforts and the desire for said items.  It's still good, I enjoy it, but until updates come, I log in every 2 weeks to pay rent on my empty house, then I log out.  I would LOVE for this game to make a few adjustments.

There are many pros and cons to this game and hopefully if you are looking to try this game, you might find answers to any questions you might have.


Pros:
Great gameplay
Awesome game to play with friends
Incredible amount of depth 
Many different variables of weapons and armor
Old rustic feel
Relaxing music

Cons:
Unresponsive/ Uninterested Developers
Minor glitches
A few problems with quests like houses not being available (devs have to do this manually)
VERY Small Community

Now that I've told you about the pros and cons I want to dive into the cons to let you understand how many of these can be temporary and will most likely be fixed, or can be ignored. First of all, the developers took a big hit when an event that I call The Blackout occured. This is the weekend in June of 2016 that the servers just told everyone to screw off and lagged a bunch. (of course this is figuratively, there was just a whole lot of lag) After that weekend the plentiful community that would have a constant amount of 50+ members on a server at one time plummeted to around 5-10 at a time. I just want to say that for the year that I have had this game, this has NEVER happened other than this one weekend. Now after this everyone lost hope and the Developers stopped releaseing patches due to the bashing and lack of support that they were getting. I am willing to bet if the servers healed like they are starting to that the Devs will come back and continue doing an amazing job. As for the minor glitches, there will occasionally be some minor glitches with your movement in the game, but after a few minutes you get used to it. All in all this is a great game that you should definetly give a shot before rejecting completely. I have happily played 222 hours so far and I will continue telling my friends about this amazing game. If you do decide to give it a go come find me and say hello!

[b]PROS[/b]

- There is three servers US1, US2 (offline i think), and Europe

- Gameplay is really nice for an indie MMO

- There is a decent amount of quests, but I perferred to grind.. which didnt take long at all either

- It's got three towns for player owned housing and town vendors, as well as three guild castles

- It's got crafting though I only tried out the alchemy to create strength infusions

- You are able to trade items with other players as well as party with them to assist with killing monsters or doing quests

- Tons of in game items, armors and weapons have random stats, graded in white / green / blue / heroic

- There is different realms or channels you can play on, but the majority of players play on Diamond

- A raid dungeon and progressive dungeon for end game.. (only tried out the prograssive dungeon and reached half way through floor 6 before i started running out of pots lol..)

- You gain skillpoints as you level up and can be put onto Passive and Active skills of your choice, if you read the skill descriptions correctly, you could make a pretty decent DPS build like I did


[b]CONS[/b]

- Dead Game I guess.. Most players i've ever seen online was 9.. (three of them were level 1 characters thats been afk standing at the beginning zone for two days since i started playing)

- Not sure if there will be any more content in this game, took a look at the forums and noticed some of the developers of the game left the team or abandoned the game completely

- It's got an item mall.. though I was not required to purchase anything from it

- Some of the higher leveled quests are bugged or incomplete.. side quests I guess


While I liked playing the game myself, I would recommend you try it out, but wouldn't recommend you spend too much time playing it.. not really sure of the current state of the game but there really isnt alot of players left",1477526224,1477526224,True,1,0,0.420487493276596069,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Fantasy Tales pode parecer bem simples, e na realidade é, mas o verdadeiro charme está nos detalhes.
Eu acho que o estilo retro (não só da era dos 16bits, mas até de jogos como Tibia) me dá uma sensação de nostalgia fantástica e um charme incrivel no jogo.
Sobre o jogo mesmo, os graficos são ""simples"" mas muito bem trabalhados, é possivel ver os equipamentos no personagem e as pequenas animações de combate. Também é muito interessante como o cenário é bem variado e desenhado; apesar de ter jogado pouco já vi uma quantidade relativamente grande de cenários e explorei o mínimo!
Há também um sistema de crafting e housing que parecem muito legais, mas não tive a oportunidade de explorar... ainda!
Vou parar de rasgação de seda e apenas dizer que este jogo realmente merece uma chance, eu estava procurando há muito tempo um jogo (grátis) que eu pudesse jogar tranquilo, curtir uma nostalgia, mas que ainda sim tivesse quests e dungeons que me mantivessem interessado.

Overall I see no reason to play this game over any of the hundreds of other MMO's out there with superior graphics, gameplay and customization. 

You'd think a 2d MMO would be overflowing with depth since it doesn't have to focus all its resources on graphics. This game isn't any more deep than any other MMO I've played, in fact, it's more shallow than most every other MMO I've ever played.

Pros: One great thing about this game is the fact that you can play it on both pc and mac which is a big deal for me considering my girlfriend is on mac and i'm on pc. we both quest to our heart's content because thankfully the devolper was smart unlike many games that we can not enjoy together :/ 

Also it's free but like i said it's very much like wow in my opinion a different look but that same feel 
It's still being worked on at the moment and some ideas that are in progress haven't been implemented but even now this is an amazing game that I throughly enjoy and I know later on it will continue to get even better 

Another fact I play on satelite internet with like 885ms ping and i can still play this game perfectly fine online 

Also it's funny if you pay attention there are some hidden little things for gamers if you keep your eyes open ;) 

Cons: none really 

A note is inventory is slightly limited but you can buy an upgrade with real money if you so wish to increase it 
I don't see this as bad honestly I see it as a great way to support the devolper so they can continue to work on the game 
I plan on doing so soon

game bergenre MMORPG ini awal - awal memang sedikit membosankan tetapi lama - lama menjadi seru 
seperti kena nolstagia game harvestmoon , hampir mirip sekali dengan game harvestmoon 
perkuat senajata , upgrade armor , dan menyelesaikan quest - quest yang di berikan 
dalam penyelesaian quest tidak terlalu sulit , jika senjata kalian di upgrade terus akan mudal menyelesaikan quest dan melawan monster - monster .

untuk lokasi ada banyak sekali lokasi yang dapat kita jumpai di game ini dan setiap lokasi tidak terlalu luas juga jadi setiap tempat gampang untuk di jumpai . 

jika kalian senang dengan game MMORPG saya sangant merekomendasi game ini 

tetapi ada 1 kekurangan dari game ini yaitu soal server , kalian di awal akan di hadapkan untuk memilih server tempat kalian bermain , ada 3 pilihan server yaitu ""US 1 , US 2 , dan EUROPE"" , tidak ada server region asia 
jadi jika kalian berada di region asia , PING kalian pasti jelek , tetapi itu tidak menggagu kalian dalam bermain .
dan juga yang terakhir peoinat game ini sangat sedikit , pas saya main game ini saya hanya mendapatkan ada 4-6 orang yang sedang bermain dari seluruh dunia

I really like pixelart, and I also like MMORPGs, so I really like this game a lot.

The combat system ist fine, the skills are good, only the items are kinda unbalance. In most of the cases, dropped items are stronger than in the shop, so you roughly have to spend money on buying things.
The music is just the average MMORPG music, and there is no real story, but I've had fun, raiding those dungeons.

Fantasy Tales Online
Free to Play w/Cashshop
No pay to win elements, Cashshop only adds items with no advantage to combat.

FIrstly I will add that this of course as you know Early Access. Now we have all grown tired of these games because we tend to expect more than we should. I will tell you that this game is very smooth and polished for an early access. The only issue is amount of content at this point. The dev team is small and is trying hard to add content constantly, however after about 2 weeks you will done with it all. That being said that doesnt mean you wont have anything to do! Now for my review

Graphics 7/10- If you like 2d Games(zelda style) this is the game for you and shoul be a 10/10, however because this is an older style of graphics I have to round it down a bit to be fair :). Overall pleasing to the eye and simple. The devs have done a great job adding detail to the maps.

Sound- 7/10- Game has charming music and very simple sound effects. Not advanced and not so dull you want to mute it. The usual 2d mmo music style.

Controls- 8/10- Typical MMO controls WASD and Number skill hotkeys etc. The controls are awesome and when refined will be a solid 10/10 for a 2d MMO.

Gameplay- 6/10- The gameplay is smooth as butter and the physics between you and the world are great. Not alot of bugs and the game runs at a solid 60 FPS on even the simplest of computers. Whip out those old Laptops because this game can play on it! The combat is fun and simple but can become VERY grindy as the higher lvl need EXTREME amounts of XP. However this is done on purpose by devs to make the (end Game) Lvls be much harder to obtain while any player can hit the soft lvl cap with ease. This game is a PURE Grindfest as it stands right now which I do not think is the direction the devs want to go, however because the 4 or 5 best pieces of equipment are EXTREMELY rare random drops in 1 or 2 raids (Instanced mazes of rooms with repeated mobs and a final boss) that means the ONLY way to compete for dps etc is to grind for those weapons which I cannot lie gets very stamina draining and boring... IF you can deal with the grinding for a few pieces of equipment than this will not bother you that much. Also currently there is NO PVP in this game.. it is on the to do list of the devs but doesnt seem to be a priority which is causing some frustration with alot of players because this is a great way to add unlimited gameplay to the servers.

Community- 5/10- This game has great potential to have a great community however the player count is very low ATM. The devs are very busy but they do try and monitor the forum and in game chat often. The devs listen to the members and try to move the game in the direction off of player input. There are a few bad apples in the game as far as players go but you tend to ignore them. Once people start playing this score has alot of potential to climb higher.

Summary: Overall this is a great little game that just needs its moment to shine. Once it gets some spotlight the servers will fill up fast! Right now they sit at anywhere between 25 to 100 players at any given time. As far as 2d Free to play MMORPGs go I consider this one of the best! I play alot on US Server 1 Diamond Shard so hope on in and gives this great game a try! Its FREE!!!

cons

there is gaps in the quests that will hopefully be filled in the future but for now around lvl 23 your stuck grinding to 30ish then you get to do a few more quests then its back to grinding raids for exp and a miniscule chance at some gear, 

all the good gear you can get from raids requires insanely good luck or a retarded amount of grinding there is people grinding for 6+ hours a day in the same raid and not getting the good gear (chaos) for over a week the games own forum page has a rough estimate based on magic find that says 1 in 12000 kills will drop a chaos item a lvl 31 armor or 35 weapon and the max lvl is currently 50 and will go higher there is already vendor items up to lvl 100 so why so rare for a low to mid 30's item thats bound when you pick it up,

and the newest raid lvl 42 drops the same chaos as the previous raid lvl 35 and was also supposed to have a ""significantly improved drop rate"" for shards used to craft a new weapon ... yeah only the mini boss and end boss can drop the shards and its far from 100% youl be lucky to pull 1 shard an hour and you need 100 shards to make the weapon,

all the gear in the game is totally random you can get heavy armor with healer stats or light with tank stats etc you can re-roll the stats on the gear for a moderate cost but it has a 25% chance to fail and wipe everything from the gear converting it into the lowest quality and there is no way to restore it so your second highest rarity can be turned into vendor trash your first try at re-rolling quite easily,

the player community is pretty so-so at best there is a few that actively try to help out and answer questions for new players etc but there is just as many who are trying to scam new players or charge them money for basic information or over charge people for basic items / crafting materials,

player housing is leaning heavily towards the cash shop right now with functional items being cash shop only like the stoves that provide a buff and will eventually be used for cooking and storage items as well as some cosmetics and odds and ends things

the inventory limits are a little harsh you get a set amount of items slots for your bank and carry ons and account bank (you get more if your a subscriber) with 4 slots for bag expansions for your bank and carry ons not for the account bank though but if you do all the quests you only get 2 small bags for your carry ons anymore than that or anything bigger is cash shop only 

pros

about the only good qualities to the game are the devs trying to add new content even if its just a minor dungeon or puzzle to solve and they try to fix bugs they have managed to get alot of the lag issues fixed lately thankfully it was almost unplayable for a while 

the quests and puzzles are pretty well done they will keep you entertained for a little while

overveiw

all in all it can be entertaining to play while lvling, but it quickly turns into a monster of a grindfest game after the mid 20's for lvling and trying to get gear, and a headache and a half to try to optimize your gear, all while dealing with a community that isnt interested in sharing or helping (not that i blame them when the drop rates are so horrible), maybe in like 6 months when the devs have filled in the quests gaps and finally learned how bad there drop rate and gear stat systems are and get them fixed, and it gets a bigger playerbase with decent people it will be worth trying again but for now avoid as anything but a time killer when your bored.",1465769846,1465769846,False,10,1,0.627363383769989014,0,False,False,True,False,,,

""Печально и жалко что так произошло, действительно была хорошая игра!"" думал было написать я, но ♥♥♥♥♥♥ там плавал.

Играл я с ребятами, сделали ги, занимались переводом игры на русский язык. Реально поняли что докачаться до 30 лвла просто играя и выполняя квесты не реально долго, там было нереальное кол-во опыта до 30 лвла. Поняли, что можно оставлять персов на ночь в локе с агрессивными мобами и тем самым качаться. Кто то из гейропов увидел, что стоят персы, не двигаются, начал что то писать в чат, не получил ответа и понял то люди просто ушли от компа и фармятся. Пошел на форум и развел демагогию, вот они читеры, вот они не играют а просто уходят спать и качаются, это все не честно, надо лвл набивать только игровым способом и бла бла бла. Крч, после разговоров с разрабами и объяснением того, что, мы не нарушили ни 1 пункта соглашения и использовали только механику игры. Нам дали понять, что так делать не зя, и пригрозили нам банами. на вопрос за что, толком не получили объяснений, кроме того, что, другим людям не нравится, в частности топ ги ""на тот момент"" которые донатили в игру. (хотя мы сами вдонатили, немного, но для старта и развития хватило). Так что, ни капли сожалений что игра загнулась. Хотя потенциал был большой. Все засрали сами же разрабы, когда пошли на поводу ребят из той самой ги, и начали лепить в обновах всякую ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥у, лишь бы угодить им. Как потом выяснилось, ребята донатили бешенные суммы.

Quick review:
+Amazing 2D graphics.
+Combat is unique and fun.
+Some dialogues and quests are really funny lol.
+Community so far is very helpful and answers really quick if you have a question.
+Quests which make exploration really valuable.
+The game is helpful and really straight forward, got a radar and a map so you know where to head for quests if you don't know where to go.

-Can be a bit laggy sometimes, I live in Europe and I'm on the EU server, I don't know what the issue could be. But it's not ruining the game experience for me.
-Sometimes the monsters HUD (health bar) is not visible because of tree's or because your character is blocking it.

The world is HUGE. Quests can be found everywhere. 9.1 / 10.

SUGGESTIONS:-
Maybe make crafting alot more relevant. It's practically useless, or maybe only till where I've reached. The only time I ever craft something is when I'm out of gold to buy potions.

Make the item description a little more detailed, for xample, I to this date don't know the difference between a Medium Armor and a Heavy armor, they have the same stats and price.

Add some more puzzles, but not too many as to make the game boring.

While FTO is in early access and under heavy development it is already far more fleshed out than many games under live release. The random conversations cropping up from NPCs are usually worthy of a chuckle, and your own characters snarky comments are an alluring touch. Discovering some well disguised easter eggs nodding in various cult classic directions is also a lovely touch (not going to spoil it!).

The open world freedom to wander and explore much like that of early mmo's such as UO.... minus the ganking -- which I am very grateful for. There is talk of open world pvp coming up, but the dev team also acknowledged many of us would like to keep a care bear or toggled pvp shard too. Combined with a very active dev team, who apparently have decided to get rid of any and all angst built up via your characters random quips (I love my snarky little assassin :D ).

The crafting system is still under heavy development (as is the whole game, yet it is currently very playable regardless), but it is definitely going in the right direction. I haven't had much time to play with the housing system but it is shaping up nicely as well, where you and your neighbors want to work together to better your entire island with buffs and raids.

Fantasy Tales is a game with huge potentional to become a great 2d Indie mmorpg.
If you coming from games such as Ragnarok/Knight online/Ultima Online/Tibia e.g. you will def like this game.

However this game is in early access which mean in a early stage of the game, Therefore you have to have patience.
The devs are releasing patches/bugfixes atleast every second week since I've started.

They listen to feedback and interract with the community on the forum and in-game when they are online.
Their support is superb I've sent them a mail regarding my backpacks being soulbound on wrong character and the issue got sorted within 5 minutes of the mail being sent which is better then any type of support I got in any other game.

It's nothing in this game which is pay2win you can't buy any type of gear or items which affects gameplay apart from decoration/costumes (Cosmetic Stuffs).

Only thing I might be worried about is their small dev team which I've got told consist of 4 people but they are doing an amazing job so far for being such a small crew.


Again this game got huge potentional if they play their cards right which seem to be the case for now.
Just keep in mind before you start or consider playing that it's early access and not a full released game with limitless of content.  I started playing this game like 4 or 5 days ago and it has been a good experience.

+ Good in-game community.

- Way too many bugs. But the devs update it weekly, so it they'll probably get rid of them in the next months. Remember it is still on Early Access.

Score: A 7/10 (in the future) as a casual rpg for you to play when you get tired of cs:go, dota 2 or rocket league.

Score atm: 6/10 because of the bugs that disconnect me from the game (visual, textures, rendering, server connection, etc.)

However this game is in early access which mean in a early stage of the game, Therefore you have to have patience.
The devs are releasing patches/bugfixes atleast every second week since I've started.

They listen to feedback and interract with the community on the forum and in-game when they are online.
Their support is superb I've sent them a mail regarding my backpacks being soulbound on wrong character and the issue got sorted within 5 minutes of the mail being sent which is better then any type of support I got in any other game.

It's nothing in this game which is pay2win you can't buy any type of gear or items which affects gameplay apart from decoration/costumes (Cosmetic Stuffs).

Von all den negativen Seiten des Spieles kann man jedoch noch drüber Weg sehen, da dieses Spiel gerade mal zwei Wochen alt ist und noch in den ersten Testphasen und Ausbauten steckt. Ausserdem macht das Raiden mit Kollegen spass.

Zu meiner Erfahrung:

Pros:
- Spannende Hausbauoptionen in einem MMORP
- Umfassende Anzahl an verschiedenen Items, Ressourcen zum Farmen etc
- Europa Server verbindet Leute in den Gilden aus allen Sprachregionen. (Offizier bei LogHorizon, der grössten EU-Gilde)
- Kein Pay-2-Win sondern Kaufmöglichkeiten für optische Feautures und Support

Cons:
- Momentan noch magere Story und Questreihen
- Einige Bugs behindern den Spielverlauf zum Teil (Jedoch ist das Spiel trotzdem spielbar)
- Verhältnissmässig eine kleine Map (Wird ausgebaut)
- Momentan nur 3 Klassen mit 3 Funktionen, welche noch nicht ganz ausgebaut sind.

Ich empfehle jedem, sich selber ein Bild von dem Spiel zu machen und nach ca. 5h Spielzeit zu urteilen.

First of all, it's a beta that literally came out a few weeks ago and there are people giving it thumbs down because of bugs. You know what I did when I found bugs? I went and reported them straight to an admin, who not only was incredibly kind but also took the liberty of actually taking his time to listen to me and report the bugs to developers. Now I could understand if you'd dislike a game where the devs ignore you and things dont get fixed but this is NOT one of those games. It's not even pay to win. It's not even much of a grind fest either, at level 1 you need 1,000xp to level up. Do you know how much xp you need to reach lvl 40? 2,550xp. Thats not a very big jump now is it. I've enjoyed every second of this game playing with my friends and running a 30+ member guild on the EU diamond shard. Yes at times it seems a little tedius, like gathering resources and quests not really linking to any 'main' story line, hell even the introduction to the game could have been beta (get it, I made a joke). But that doesn't matter, because some people seem to forget it's an incredibly early beta with updates literally every other day. Instead of judging a game when it's not finished, how about you wait... Untill then, if there's something you don't like then I suggest you talk to a dev about how to make it better. They will listen. Like good game developers do.

FYI -  there are many bugs, but they will be fixed in due time, I promise!

I would do a proper review but i'm useless at revies. But I have read a lot of the negative review and I agree with some of their point, but this game has been in early access for 14 days. Nobody have given it a proper chance, the admins are very friendly and are always listening to new ideas and fixing lots of bugs. 

My review stands positive because of this and the developers release regular updates to make the game better. For example they will be creating PvP, they will be creating more classes and brand new systems for them. They are making many differnt items to craft as well as making houses more customisable. 

This game is not pay to win since I have gotton to level 41 without paying anything, as well as having very good gear. Not to mention me and nonon are running the largest guild in the game at the moment.

Hope you had fun reading this review xD will update regularly. Peace <3",1463675548,1463675785,True,9,6,0.508085250854492188,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I love the graphics the old style 2d pixel is amazing there is more content on the way LOTS of content, there are so many areas that don't have anything implemented into them yet so be ready for that and if you like raiding for the best gear you're in luck with that as well.

 As currently the best items in the game the ""Chaos sword & Chaos armor"" are fun to chase after. If you do full clear of the raid, killing all the bandits you have a 1-2% chance in total of getting one of them to drop. Overall I enjoy the game quite a lot i would say 7/10

The best part of this game is the housing system. I'll tell you why.
You pick where you want to live, There's the woods, the snowy place(Where I live) and the desert.
Once you picked your place, you go there and you actually look for a house you want to live in,
you can see every player's house in the map, once you find an unoccupied house, you can proceed to rent
and decorate it. But there's a weekly rent.

+ A very casual MMO that simplifies the formula and makes everything feel so much more rewarding
+ More RPG and Less ""Grind"" meaning you won't spend ages grinding the same monsters over and over for ages
+ Some interesting quests, one had me find tools and supplies to build up barricades to defend against an onslaught of bats and rats.
+ Great boss battles that are very different from most MMOs, you actually have to find their weaknesses and do a variety of tasks while trying to evade and stay alive. (see video above)
+ Simple puzzles consisting of levers, switches, and so on that you need to solve to advance through dungeons.
+ Play with friends and talk to anyone you encounter! (most people seem very friendly at this point)
+ Great music epic fantasy soundtrack
+ Alongside every quest there's a link that sends you to a wiki/guide which are very well detailed and super helpful if you get lost or stuck

Pros
 - Party system is simple.
 - You can peek into others' inventories.
 - Trade system is simple.
 - The free roaming is just the right amount.
 - The game is casual.
 - The Guild system is great.
Cons
 - The INN system (respawning at an INN when you log out) is annoying.
 - Player housing doesn't evict players who don't pay rent.
 - NPCs are repetetive.
 - Partying isn't ever actually necessary, and being in a party of just 2 creates a sense of being over powered.

Overall, this game is for people who enjoy classic RPGs and casual team play.

Full Review
As of this review, I have played twenty minutes shy of two hours. It is important to understand I will not touch up on the game's community. Anyone reading this also needs to keep in mind that this is 'in early access'.

I do recommend trying the game at the very least. It will cost you nothing and will take you all of 20 minutes to figure out if you like the game or not.

The biggest handicap in the game, for me, was the combat. There is no indication when combat begins/ends. No on-screen error prompts (for skills) if you have your chat window closed. Animations for attacks are next to non-existent. This can make it difficult to know if you are actually attacking back. On the other hand, however, you can interact with objects (quest objectives or crafting nodes) and defend yourself if you are attacked. Without stopping the progress/action you are currently involved in.

Characters... while there are some feminine hairstyles. Your character will maintain a male body and voice in the game. Not sure if this is due to lazy development/artists or some jab at a certain group. This will only be a problem for people who cannot get past what their character's look like without their clothes on. While wearing armor, it is pretty neutral looking. (Baggy/loose clothing.)

Logging out throws you to the last bed you saved at. Has it's perks and it's pains.

Now, I have not gotten far enough to find out if the developers CashShop block your progress in the game. A lot of it seems to be quality of life but not pay to progress. (larger bags and so forth.) I have no idea how much of character appearance customization is tied into the cash shop.

Interface is interesting (unique) but a little clumsy. Quest windows will snap back to it's default position anytime it is refreshed. Tutorial window was in an unexpected place (upper right) and easy to miss. Especially since the quest info is on the other side of the window.",1462642946,1462642946,True,4,0,0.472886413335800171,0,False,False,True,False,,,

   For my actual review I would like to start off with this game is not PAY TO PLAY. There are in fact micro transactions in the game but do not alter the gameplay in any way and do not put players ahead of the surve over others.
   This game is a old school based 2.5D game where your whole objective is to make friends and complete quests as much as possible. This may sound boring and for some it is but for others this is their style of game. For a game like this the community is great and there is no way to sell items for others to buy unless you're at one of three islands shops. This is great because when in Runescape as most have played at some point there was a thing called the Grand Exchange that ruined the whole game trading system. People became distant and didnt reallly have to make friends with others. In this game you are forced to meet up with others to do hard dungeons and raids as well as to trade items that you need or will need in the future.
   This game is honestly one of the best I've played in awhile and as of now I believe is a great game to play when you just want to catch up with random people. Servers are fairly low on people with as many as 80 people at one point which means chat logs arent being filled with spam. I myself am yet to see and actual toxic player on the game yelling in chat about how much they hate the game or how unfair it is.
   The developers are also updating the game on a regular basis right now and hopefully it will continue so you can expect new quests every one to two weeks and they are constantly changing dungeons and adding new ones in to explore and fight. Also one MAJOR point of the dungeon system is they are COMPLETELY random everytime. This is a great function because if you know the exact route to use everytime people could do them in minutes but the random feature makes it so you have to spend your time actually exploring and fighting the monsters within them to get to then end.
   Hopefully you read all of that and I know that some of it got repeated if not a lot of it, but the negative reviews on this game comes from people who log in an instantly dislike it because its not what they expected, it doesn't have a feature that they want but not implemented yet, or they see the shop and instantly assume its full of game changing micro transactions.

To add to this after giving the game a little more play.

Level 35 Update - still killing zombies, skeletons, and rats.

Luckily, more reviews are coming out that prove I'm not alone. Due to this, I'll go ahead and say my two cents. 

While I only have almost two hours in the game, I don't know if it's really...fun. The quests already felt like a chore after the initial one or two. Besides being a chore to find, at times it was difficult to actually find the quest giver, due to the poor minimap (although I may be missing on an option to zoom in, and that would be my fault instead). 

As well, the grind is really boring for this game. Don't get me wrong, I love games that are literally grinding. Hell, I put in over a hundred hours in Warframe, and countless hours in ye' ol F2P MMORPGS where the only selling point was the 'grind'. The thing is, in this game the grind just feels (in simple terms) like something you'd rather set a bot up to do, than do yourself. I found myself more often than not trying to avoid having to kill enemies.

The clothing is also a little weird. The chest-piece and leggings show up your character, but the hat doesn't. For some reason, the devs decided that it would be better for you to be stuck with these weird stock heads (that range from some weird Naruto-looking head, a viking, some weird Avatar heads, and some generic recolors of other hairs), which show up no matter what helemt you're wearing, so it looks pretty silly when you run across the same guy with the same head as you, five times in just as many minutes.

The game doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem like anything more than a flash game ripped off of Newground's frontpage, and put on Steam.",1462571592,1462571592,False,40,0,0.582555234432220459,1,False,False,True,False,,,

My issues reside with the core of the game which can't be changed without it being a whole new game. On the steam page this game promises complete customization and choices but you can't do that if you are locked in classes let alone having only 3 currently. Next I absolutely hate the animation system because of its super simplistic repetitive style and it's even missing basic animations such as diagonal movement. Now you might nag me saying but it's an early access but creating the diagonal movement is as easy as putting a dot on a graph in a blendspace which if it isn't in the game already it probably never will be. Another issue just because the game is free is the amount of trolls I met in gameplay. They range from spamming messages to inviting you to their party about 3 times every 10 seconds.

The graphics are obviously simple. I don't count that as a con since you know that going in. However there is very little direction starting off. The combat is simplified to the point of absolute boredom, the enemies are as generic and repetitive as you could imagine, the world is not interesting there is no story, no lore to make you want to continue. 

Combat: click to start autoattacking. There are active skills you can level to put on your hot bar but only very limited ones that take a while before you can learn and from what I saw with the medic, very boring (hit for more damage, heal, shield etc). And that is literally it. That is all you will be doing

The enemies: first you kill beetles and spiders. And then you kill so many rats and bats and an occasional wolf that you will hate yourself. Of course by kill I mean click to autoattack and wait 10 seconds. They all are virtually identical just swapped sprites and names. 

The dungeons: randomly generated sequences of exactly identical generic rooms with a few of the above mentioned enemies in each one. If every room feels exactly the same I'm not sure what the point of randomly generating them is, sometimes you turn left, sometimes you go straight, both ways you will wonder why you are wasting your time on this garbage. 

The cash shop: wtf seriously. This game is lacking in so many areas, is ""Early Access"" and the part of it with the best functionality is the microtransactions. And oh boy do they love their microtransactions. Want that player housing they are advertising? Get your wallet. Want inventory space? Wallet. Want to do stuff at higher levels? .. Wallet. A game as simple as this and lacking in content and they want to charge you with so much cash shop items.. ridiculous. 

There are so many better choices out there. Usually even trash games have at least one interesting mechanic they managed to add. I found none here.",1462525548,1462526010,False,66,1,0.626909613609313965,0,False,False,True,False,,,

A surprisingly fun little MMO. It's obviously very early on, but this game actually plays GREAT. Controls are easy and work well. Combat is extremely simple but I think that's to be expected. You've got gathering, crafting, grouping, guilds, quests... this is very much all the ""normal"" stuff you'd expect from an MMO these days, but it's in a very nice retro package. The developers are active, responsive, and friendly.

The main problem right now is that the game is SUPER crowded, so the starting areas (especially the caves) have stacks of people competing for limited objectives. 

Still, this game has a lot of potential and is already a good few hours of fun (at least) in it's current state.",1462517739,1478578333,False,1,0,0.500954806804656982,0,False,True,True,False,,,

I just want to make it clear that there are already a few negative posts for this game from players filled with jelousy that others suggestions were just as good or better. These players were actually looking for favoritism and did not receive such since the game is not managed in such a way. I just want to make that clear because these posts just do not belong here and are full of misinformation.

So I have about 60 hrs total in this game and I must say I love it. Im currently a paying member and even though there's not tons of content at the moment it's coming. Fantasy tales offers a great passionate community and devs that listen and are passionate about creating a game that offers a  community driven nostalgic feeling missing from mmos today. The features currently implemented are as follows.

In game currently:
-Diverse character building (any class can wear any armor so your build is your own)
-creative hair and head changes
-housing (yes you can custom build inside with tiles) outside to, and with trophies from bosses.
-guild housing 
-crafting (so far just potions and limited furniture items)
-raids 
-devs that listen to concerns and openly embrace community feedback.
-unique and interesting quests that are well written and enjoyable.

Currently in the works
-pvp (there's been talks about having open sea pvp in the future with boats).
-more quests( slows down around level 30)
-community involved housing events.
-message board buy/sell system instead of an auction house. (Boards are already in)
-endless progressive dungeon and this should be coming sooner then later.

All in all I highly suggest taking your time to try and support these guys theirs only 3 devs at the moment working their tales off and still making time for constant in game feedback. This is a game that deserves the support and there truly is nothing like it on the market today.",1462513658,1462513736,True,3,1,0.46099284291267395,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Pros
Plenty to explore as well as hidden chests, puzzles, npc diagloe which will make u smile the enviroment certainly does its job well to pull you in and get you thinking I wonder whats in that cave next thing you know 4 hrs have pasted.
Runs very smooth with very few problems
The boss fights are challenging and engaging and make you wish you pushed that lever a bit sooner or ran away a bit faster.
The music and art are brilliant in this and i love it every time they put a new mob into that game.
The player housing and guild housing do there job well and hook you into to go raiding for another set of kitchen tiles and a stove to match.
Vast amount of costumes, weapon types, and stats to keep you grinding for the perfect weapon shield or armour.
The devs allways are very friendly and very fast about fixing problems if any arise.


Cons there arnt really any although i do have to say A little bit more class skill development is needed to really maximize the potential of each and so there a few different builds that people can use and succeed in ( i know the guys have this in the plans in the very near future.) And a few more classes to add more diversity.

All in all a geat game thats not pay to win that u can easily get hooked into and wanting another patch to roll around just too see what the dev team thow at us next.

Fantasy Tales Online ( plus facile à retenir avec l'abréviation FTO ) est un jeu MMORPG orienté dans un style rétro séduisant. Il sera disponible sur le marché Steam à partir du 5 mai 2016, en F2P.

Le jeu risque de demeurer en accès anticipé quelques années, cependant déjà beaucoup de fonctions sont disponibles. Même si les explorations de donjons, d'endroit semble être le moteur du jeu, vous pouvez faire beaucoup d'activités autour du jeu, qui ne tournent pas forcément uniquement sur le combat.

Actuellement, il est possible d'utiliser des banques sans taux d'épargne ( ce qu'est assez réaliste en fait ), faire des échanges et du commerce avec les autres joueurs, remplir des quêtes, fabriquer des armes et des recettes de potions, sorts. Un système de messagerie interne est disponible, ainsi que la possibilité de rejoindre et gérer une guilde. Pour résumer, le jeu est optimisé pour le travail d'équipe.

Le chat de jeu est anticipé, vous avez la possibilité de parler si vous le voulez aux joueurs de votre map ou du serveur en général. Je crains malheureusement que ça soit le bazard dans les mois à venir.

Si le jeu semble très intéressant pour un jeu d'équipe, il est au contraire bien ennuyeux lorsque vous vous retrouver seul. Les animations de combats sont absentes, les transitions entre les maps sont mal assurées ou lentes et les monstres de la première île sont un peu répétitifs ( cafards, araignées et rebelote ) ...

Sinon, le tout reste plutôt agréable à jouer, surtout pour son prix. Après, c'est un F2P, un genre que je n'aime pas vraiment car les changements peuvent êtres radicales et frustrants ( incitation à l'achat virtuelle, frustration ) ... Donc je n'ai pas confiance.

So far it has provided me with more entertainment then 95% of the free to play games i've played in recent months. Early game is super important as it will encourage people to stay around past the first 5-20 minutes.

i will say though medic dot (chemical waste) needs to be buffed substantialy or they should just take it away since it does almost nothing right now. The direct damage is fine on it.

with only 3 people working on this game i can't recomend anyone spending money on it yet as we've been burned too many times by steam greenlight games.

Best feature in game: loot system. getting those rare items kinda like diablo 2 style. (i got a heroic purple item out of a crate at level 6 and its carrying the crap out of my medic right now.

Worst feature: only a 3 class system with Assassin/Brute/Medic as the classes and no class advancement. No archer no mage yet. But they could put this in at a later date as its only early access.

Overall so far i'd say about 7.5/10 on this game. it has a strong start and could be something really cool if they put in the time and make the correct choices in development.

Since its free theres no reason not to try it. Recomended.",1462480358,1462480358,True,4,0,0.518342792987823486,0,False,True,True,False,,,

You can see the game little more in this video. This video is from a few days before the launch on steam so wasn't to many people. I have logged in since the launch and there is people everywhere :)

It does have the retro top down feel as advertised. There is a good mix of grinding/quest/group related content with more on the horizon. Is it cutting edge? No. But it is a heck of a lot of fun and good to sit down with for a few hours at a time.

The team making the game is incredibly small. But they are by far putting their heart and soul into their product. They are often seen in game and always making tweaks and fixes where needed. Even for very early on, the game and servers have very little, almost non-existant down time.

If you're looking for a change of pace from the modern MMO, this game is for you. So far the small community is quite helpful and talkative, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when the game grows.

I found this game by completely random chance, I was looking for a random Free to Play/Early Access MMO. When I saw this on the list, I thought to myself: ""Hell, I'll give it a shot.""

I downloaded the game from their  website, knowing it was Early Access an was likely to have bugs and problems.

Now, I'm currently 40+ hours into the game and I've had an overwhelmingly positive experience thus far. The game runs well, with very few problems in regards to the client itself. The servers are quite stable, minus some slight problems they had early on after I started playing.

The community is very friendly and helpful, despite there being such a small playerbase pre-steam launch. There's almost always someone online that's willing to answer questions and help other players, which is wonderful.

Even the development team is outstanding, keeping an active and open channel of communication between themselves and their playerbase. They monitor chat in game, answering questions and listening to suggestions, as well as on the forums. They reply to most, if not all threads that are posted.

Not only that, but they're very transparent about what they're working on and extremely open to suggestions. During their streams on Twitch, they show the players what they're working on, what still needs to be fixed, and talk about what goes into fixes and updates.

Without further ado, here are a few Pros/Cons I feel should be mentioned.

Pros:
[list][*]Addictive
[*]Cute Sprites
[*]Friendly Community
[*]Excellent Staff Communication
[*]Player/Guild Housing Interior Extremely Customizable
[*]Traps & Puzzles Add to Dungeon Gameplay
[/list]

Cons:
[list][*]Game is FAR from finished, still being developed - If this is something you don't like, I don't think this game is for you.
[*]Classes Still Need Work
[*]No Real End Game Yet
[*]Questlines Aren't Finished
[*]Can Get Grindy (See Above)
[*]Little Monster Variation
[/list]

The devs are super active.

Unfortunately the game has an absurd amount of lag for a 2D game making it almost unplayable at times.

Really easy to reach level cap and No endgame content yet which forces most players to quit after 1 week of play.
