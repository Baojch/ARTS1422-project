~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Imagine a gameshow where you have between four to five contestants in the arena; well, a maze really! Four of them would be formally known as Zombies, and one as a healthy human. The interesting point is that all zombies used to be human contestants before becoming undead. However, if they touch you they take your place and you become a zombie! So don’t touch the zombies!

Don’t Touch The Zombies is a casual action game where you swap between humans and zombies in several modes of play.

As you land on the menu page, you will have the option to play single player or multiplayer. By selecting the single player, you will have access to seven different modes of play. The adventure mode combines all modes in fourteen stages. The modes include Time Score, Time Killer, Score, Killer, Collector and Horde, across four maps: the warehouse, graveyard, rooftop and forest.

The gameplay is simple but fun. Depending on what mode you are playing, you will start playing either as a human or a zombie. Within the maze, several icons will pop up. Some will be in favour of the humans and others in favour of the zombies. Essentially, if you’re a human, you will be armed with a shotgun and a limited amount of ammunition. If you’re a Zombie, you’ll be able to fart or burp some sort of cloud which will slow down anybody who gets directly in its path. You’ll also be able to activate a speed-up boost which makes your zombie character run towards your opponent in a heartbeat every 10 seconds. Another interesting aspect is that you can play the game in the day or night. At this stage, it is very difficult to find a multiplayer game.

Graphically the game looks ok but I must admit that the audio is very funky especially at the end of a stage. In terms of controls, I strongly recommend playing with a gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard. I think the game needs more content; not in terms of the modes, but I think in terms of maps - additional maps would make this game much better, in my opinion. 

Positives:
~~~~~~~
 
-	Nice graphics
-	Several modes of play
-	Swap between humans and zombies
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	No trading cards
-	Needs more maps
-	Hard to find a multiplayer game (beta)

This is a fun casual game swapping between humans and zombies. Definitely don’t touch the zombies.

I’d been reviewing such good titles. Recently released titles such as Brute, Rocking Pilot and No Stick Shooter. These are all games that I spent several hours enjoying immensely. At some point, I knew that my luck would run out. You eventually must try and polish a turd. Unfortunately, Don’t Touch the Zombies was, for me, that turd.
Look, in all honesty, there’s nothing wrong with the product. It works as intended. It’s not a broken mess. It’s not a bug riddled mess and I’m certain that somewhere there is an audience for this game. Unfortunately, I am not that audience. 
My Issues with the Game

There are never any players available for online multiplayer. My partner is not interested in playing video games and as such local multiplayer is out of the question. Therefore, the component of the game that I suspect would potentially bring some entertainment is a no-go for me. 

None of the mini-games offer an enthralling experience for a single player. The one that I had the most fun playing felt like a poorly made up version of Pac-Man. The worst one had me running around aimlessly for thirty seconds trying to find the hunter so I could try and get my thirty seconds to win. I didn’t see a single opponent in that time and there was none on the map for me to try and hunt down. The next time I played I was awarded the role of the hunter and the opposing zombies were on opposite sides of the maps so avoiding them for 30 seconds was far too easy.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

This is not the production values of an indie game that is priced fairly at $10. There are much better indie games on the market with a price a fraction of that. There is nothing within the game that would make me recommend it for anything more than a few dollars. This is 0indie bundle type quality where you add it to your Steam account and consider it a plus one. Either that or you gift it to a friend’s kid who's happy just having a game in their library but aren’t old enough to care about quality or lack thereof.

The game’s graphics are below average by today’s standards and the game isn’t attempting to be retro. 

The highlight of the presentation, and arguably the entire game, is the limited soundtrack. However, it comes with one giant caveat. The soundtrack would be perfect for a party game or if I were leaving a club in Ibiza but it doesn't fit the zombie Vs hunters theme at all.

[h1]Should Be Early Access[/h1]

 “This is the beginning; our game mode platform is very flexible so share with us the game modes you’d like to play” This quote from the game’s Steam store page makes me believe that the game should be in the Steam Early Access program and not fully released yet. It also makes me believe that the team are relatively young developers – age wise – that are making a game as their high school project. It’s hard to believe that this is their second published game following Debatazos, a Mexican politics mobile game.

[h1]Steamified[/h1]

Don’t Touch the Zombies feature Steam achievements and Steam stats. With regards to multiplayer it has online, local and apparently cross-platform multiplayer. It has partial controller support. 

[h1]Don’t Touch the Zombies – An Undead Verdict[/h1]

Unfortunately, there is no way that I can possibly recommend Don’t Touch the Zombies. I’m certain that the developers 
mean well and have put undeniable effort into their game but it’s just not very good. I urge them to keep plying their trade and keep learning. Perhaps someday they’ll develop a good game for us to play.
