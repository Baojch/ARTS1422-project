Я только запустил игру, и чуть не сдох от удовольствия, встретив стартовый экран и шикарный саундтрек. Такой же кайф был, рассматривая главное меню.
Сама картинка геймплея тоже выше всяких похвал...

Вот только core-механика меня расстроила вдребезги. Ровно то же самое, 1 в 1, я испытал, играя в Hyperdrive Massacre - ты просто запускаешь матч, пытаешься сделать хоть что-то против AI - и сосёшь. Как я не извивался, как не прицеливался и какие кнопки не нажимал - ни бомбы, ни мины, ни ракеты не смогли мне подсобить в победе над ботом хотя бы единожды. Поражение за поражением, каждый раз. Даже зайдя в How to Play, легче не стало. Враг тупо постоянно находится в моём ненавистном в играх режиме турели - прицел всегда на игроке, какие бы чудеса ловкости ты не проявлял.

Дизайнеру, художникам, музыканту (Ben Lam), и всем прочим, что отвечали за картинку и звук - нижайший поклон.

Тому, кто отвечал за саму стартовую идею и реализацию - ""Ты сам засрал весь проект, изначально придумывая такие дурацкие условия. Поздравляю"".

Возможно, я бы остался в полном восторге вообще, если бы с самого начала разделил удовольствие геймплея с друзьями, но запускать пока что мне приходилось только соло - а значит, меня встречал только мерзкий, ублюдский ""Совершенный искусственный интеллект"".

Since there is no story we are jumping straight to graphics.

Graphics:

The art style of ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a bright neon look that enjoy. I absolutely adore the neon look and love pretty much everything that is of the same art style, it's bright and vibrant and just pleasant to look at and people who know me can attest that I absolutely love it, so that is something that I have to give huge props to.

Audio:

The soundtrack is also really good. It has some nice techno-ish music and it's does go along with the game well and provides for some good background noise.

Gameplay: 

You and a couple of your friends fly around with rockets and try to blow each other up. It's fun enough, but sadly there's many flaws in this game that make me give this a negative review. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is fun and with a couple of friends it's a blast, but sadly since the game is local co-op only, there's not much play value here.

You need to have a full party for this game to be truly fun, but even then it won't last long, maybe an hour of fun before you and your friends want to jump into something else. There's no doubt that with Online co-op this game would be much more fun. 

Verdict:

ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a fun game, but sadly since there's no online co-op, I don't recommend buying this game, not to mention there's many other party games that allow full local co op and also online co op that are much better. 

Final Rating:
5/10

Pros:
+ Vibrant graphics
+ Cool soundtrack 
+ Fun gameplay
 
Cons:
- Gameplay does get stale after a while
- No online

TLDR: Couchplay combat using clumsy Lunar Lander design elements and a ton of neon and some dubstep. Camera issues. 

Short lived and ill conceived. You can fight the controls to try to manage momentum and face your foe. You attack using a spread of rocket, which itself seems to only be triggered after an invisible timer finishes.

So you are constantly holding fire, and spurting out attack rockets more or less randomly, while the camera zooms in and out aggressively with the dubstep and the lights blaring.

The controls and camera behavior was marginally better for the solo singleplayer mode, and I even thought for a second that they might have had a shot at making an actual lunar lander remake viable, but unfortunately that mode is also rather empty and unengaging and serves as little more than a practice mode.

Conclusion: This is arguably worse than Starwhal even due to the unadressed design issues. The brute forced art direction and mood will immediately grate some, while wearing off quickly for others as it becomes increasingly clear that the play experience is just uncomfortable for everyone.

Tak więc cały koncept / schemat gry jest wypisany powyżej, to typowa gra rywalizacji, wygrywa osoba która pozostanie najdłużej przy życiu – prosta ale i zarazem wciągająca gra dla małego grona znajomych.

So, TLDR - Don't buy if you want to play local multiplayer with a friend using 2 steam controllers. Or, better yet, don't buy Steam's hardware.

Update - Followed 'Hugesavings' advice

go to configure steam controller in steam, manually assign game to default ""gamepad"" setting. then it works with a steam controller.""

Sounds simple, but the way the game presents itself, and how it makes use of what it has it what makes it such a blast to pIay!

The game's enviroments (Maps) consist of simple neon colored shapes that can be used as cover from incoming attacks from enemy rockets. There aren't many maps in the game at the moment but the maps that are currently availible still manage to offer a grand time with friends

The game's graphics consist of the use of simple neon colors that can be seen in the enviroment as mentioned, but dispite being simple the game still manages to look amazing even though there are no use of any background images. The game allows you to use your rockets exaust trails in order to paint the enviroment, even though you may be left with scribbles because of the fact that you'll be dogfighting with other players, but the game offers a Zen mode that lets fly around, drawing in the enviroment, while listening to the game's music.

Speaking of the music. It consists of Dubstep that DEMANDS your attention, even though there isn't much of it (The Soundtrack only consists of nine songs, but they're all good)

lastly, the game's weapons (Missles, Mines, and Bombs) work like you may expect them to in other dogfighting games (Missles can be shot directly towards an enemy rocket and is the primary weapon you will be using, Mines are bombs that can be dropped behind you to stop any Rockets tailing you, and Bombs can be dropped and blow up any enemy rockets from below.) But a quick thing to note on the weapons is that all of them have the secondary ability to be fired in a barrage attack (which is what I call them at least) which fires mutilple rounds from the gun you're using, this can be done by pressing and holding the fire button for that weapon.

In the end, the game is really simple in design but it offers a fun and challenging experience for those who decide to get this game.

Heed the suggestion upon launch—play this game with a controller. You will not have a good time playing this with a keyboard.

The gameplay is really repetitive—even playing with friends gets tedious. This isn't helped by the fact that the maps don't offer any variety. However, the thing that's keeping me from giving the game a thumbs down is the stunning neon art and effects, sound production, and best of all—the soundtrack. Kudos to Ben Lam for making great music! I wish you could just grab the soundtrack but I'd say the $10 deluxe edition is worth it just for the music alone.

It isn't the deepest, most graphically impressive, or most content-rich game. But the fundamental gameplay the devs have hit upon is just 'so good' it outshines any shortcomings. The flight and shooting/blocking mechanics just feel excellent and tense as hell. They have added maps/modes since release, which is welcome and appreciated, but even back when this was just one map and 4 players it was still well worth the price. It's probably best with 2 players, because that's how the (absolutely amazing) dynamic camera functions best, but I've found it totally enjoyable with 4 and that's how I usually end up playing it.

I can actively see the rockets flying directly through the center of my enemies but not hitting them. Then they shoot one fucking rocket near me but obviously not hitting and your armor gets blown to fucksville. Hit detection is attrocious in this game.

Ruins everything, makes everything invisible, gamebreaking, trust me. dont even try.

サ！

ギ！

まず、公式のニュースがオカシイのです。
公式によると2015/05/02に正式リリースなのですが、
メインプレイのメニューに堂々と「soon!」と書いてあり、
遊べないモードが有ります。
こう書くと　いつかは出るんでしょ？　と思いたくなります。
残念です。
公式ニュースでは最新バージョンが6なのですが、実際にはバージョン8です。
これはもうニュースをわざと更新していないと見るしかありません。
公式ブログも正式リリース以降全く更新なし。
こんな態度で本当に全機能を実装するんですかねぇ...

さらには過去のバージョンではワークショップがあり、ゲームで遊べるマップが
1種類しかないという弱点も克服していたのですが、何を考えたのか
最新バージョンにはModを読み込んで遊ぶモードが丁寧に削除されています。

これでも欲しい方は買ってから1時間ほど遊び、
マップの乏しさにがっかりして返金してください。
返品できない3、4時間遊んだあたりで100人中60人は飽きてくるでしょう。

あるいは友達と大いに盛り上がり、あのレビューが詐欺じゃねーか！！と

The game has an interesting sort of light humour about it and runs very smoothly on my system, even in 4K, its graphics are simple but clean and stylised and its sound is great. but all of this would be worthless were the gameplay not there to support it.

I can gladly report that the gameplay on this titles is superb. firing rockets is tricky but getting a hit is satisfying, simply flying around requires and easy-to-learn-hard-to-master kind of skill and just how this game handles means that potential groups of up to four could have endless fun with this game. though that said, one person alone can easily find great enjoyment with this title, simply flying around in zen mode and relaxing or playing against some challenging AI.

put bluntly, the amount of skill required in this game is refreshing and its gameplay and difficulty curve will suit casual and dedicated players alike.

As for the game, I adore the minimalistic gameplay and aesthetics - it's oddly charming! Something which I really found added to the game's challenge is the ship movement controls - it's fluid yet rather hard to aim your ship.

If you've ever seen or played Mario Carts battle mode with the 3 Balloons, the Bubbles mode is like that.

It has beautiful aesthetics and is quite enjoyable to play with a friend, against the AI, or even in the more pacifist Zen mode flying around and making art with rocket trails. The combat is simple, intuitive, and amazing, with three projectiles and a dash maneuver which allow for diverse gameplay. You can shoot missles, leave nasty mines, and drop bombs to cause beautiful, beautiful havoc. I'm not kidding. It's quite beautiful watching the brightly colored projectiles and stages blossom with bright, cheerful explosions as your enemies spin, hit by your barrage of missles and bombs or blasted by a mine. There is a lot of potential for skill, but even beginners can play without too much barrier.

Pros:
Fun gameplay
Beautiful (minimalist) graphics
Great game modes
Couch versus, co-op vs bots, and Zen mode

Cons:
High risk of intense button mashing, play at your own risk.
No online multiplayer (and, given the intense speed of matches, it makes sense, though it would be amazing if it existed)
Basically requires a controller- playable on keyboard and mouse, but much less fun.

[*]Killer Soundtrack.
[*]Simplistic and beautiful.
[*]Easy to grasp controls.
[*]Amazing game for couch co-op or multiplayer.
[*]Intense Dogfights. Like Intense!
[*]Incredibly Fun!

 [u]Cons:[/u]
[*]There isnt a whole lot of variety, theres one level and one mode(with the addition of a ""Zen"" aka drawing mode and a tournament mode, that facillitates that play style but isnt a unique gmae mode)
[*]Nothing to spice up the level, yeah the slow down and speed up drops are cool, but they dont change the game in anyway, just make it slower or faster. I'd like to see some special one use weapons or shields drop occasionally.
[*]In my opinion, the camera comes in close to quickly, its a bit jarring durin the fight and distracting.

 ---Плюсы---
-Саундтрек. Это самое великое что есть здесь и самое главное и состовляет примерно 50% игры
-Геймплей. Здесь тоже замечательный и состоит на 25% от всей игры 
-Ну и самое интерестное это стиль игры он весь красочный
 ---Минусы---
-Это ее сложность. В самой игре очень сложно играть на клавиатуре а на геймпаде намного проще после пары часов можно смело говорить что вы профи. 
-Краски. Цвета этой игры достаточно сильно влиют на глаза и поэтому больше 3 раундов(в день) играть не хочется 
-Геймлей(да да он в обоих сторонах). В этой игре особого смысла нет и поэтому как я уже говорил больше 3 раундов(в день) не поиграешь дальше немного скучно.
 ---------ВЫВОД---------
Игра достойна своей цены. Большинство в этой игре занимает саундтрек от которого зависит геймплей. И если вы не умеете играть с геймпада то это идеальная игра чтобы научится играть с него.
Также эта игра спасает от пригараний в области 5 точки так что очень советую всем не уравновешаным.

RECCOMENDATION :  YES : 

I would wholeheartedly reccommend this game a few months ago, but not anymore.   I am writing this review with the hopes of getting the devs attentions, youve made an amazing game and I want to point out some things so that i can play it again.  I completely reccommend this game at 5$, but only after below said issues are fixed.   Review will be updated as changes happen.

GAMEPLAY :  


Rocketsx3 is a great PvP multiplayer game. Can be played against bots as well.  You can play upto 4 player but the experience is best with 2. You could play 4 on a TV pretty well.   

You control a ship and you have 3 weapons.  Mines, missiles, and  bombs.  Each of these attacks can be fired one at a time, or charged and released to dish out a devastating barrage of your weapon of choice.    

Mines launch behind you and detonate in an area after a while.  Missiles launch directly in front of you and shoot forward.     Bombs are like tiny missiles but have no thrust, so they fall off from the side of your rocket.
You get a sheild that also functions as a speed boost, allowing you to block attacks or get out of a tight situation.  

First to 3 hits in a row wins! You can hit yourself and that deducts from your score.   
Controlling your ship may be hard at first but youll get the hang of it.  


Gameplay is fast, solid, and fluid.  Matches are usually short but may last longer. And boy are those longer matches tense.   Dodging missiles, falling for mine traps, using bombs to block your escape, a well timed charge attack to get two hits in a row or that moment when you engage eachother in a tense spiral of death.     

Graphics are great, a very beautiful and neon art style, and the announcer ingame is great. A female, robotic assistant type voice.  The AI is amazing and WILL beat you many times.

COMPLAINTS : 
 
I used to love this game. I played it  everyday with a good friend of mine. Both of us have stopped playing this game now due to changes made to it over successive updates that has left the game unplayable for us.  These reasons are :  

1) WAY too bright. The brightness of the ship burner and particles, as well as environment objects and trails was multiplied by 20.   There should be a slider for this.  I miss the darkened out trails that the game had in the beginning, the bright trails before the christmas update were fine too, but it became WAY too sparkly after that. no reason that this cant be optional.   

2) Difficult to fight in tight spaces now.  Due to the changes to particles and brightness, when you clash with eachother in tight corners or against walls, you cant tell what is going on.   

3) Unncessary clutter added.  Your health is depicted by 3 balls around your ship. I feel that this adds unncessary clutter to the game and takes away from your focus.  I prefer the healthbar at the top. No reason why this cant be an option.  

4) Screen size  : I play this game on my 21 inch 1980x1080 desktop, where the game is just about playable in its current state.   On my  1366x768 laptop though, i cant see anything anymore.    

5) The background was darkened out to try and fix the visibility issue i reckon,  and it looks plain terrible.  

6) The pulsating rocket trail. Please no.    

7) The last life slowdown. Let this be an option. It takes away from the fast paced fun of the game for me.. Totally kills the mood, although it is cool sometimes.  Could be an optional powerup or 5th button.  


..............................................................................................................................................................


CONCLUSION : 

Options are your best friend. Please dont just remove something and replace it with something else entirely.   Some poeple prefer one thing over another.  

Online play will be coming to this game later on im sure.  On a positive note the UI work is great. Always improving. The music score is also nice.

There is no problem in the gameplay , but how the game is visually presented has totally gimped it for me and made it unplayable. If you could provide me with an older build of this game, I'd much rather play that than what is on the steam store right now.   

I dont have any reviews on my account, but i care enough about this game to write this out.  Your feedback on this review would be much appreciated.  Heres hoping a dev replies or these issues are addressed.       

................................................................................................................................................................


EDIT :     CHANGES IN THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME :   


The beta build of the game includes a lot of improvements, which are :  

1)   A bloom and rocket trail slider.  The lowest setting in bloom is still too high for me, its the same as the regular game.  The bloom slider is overkill. http://i.imgur.com/IyQAukE.gifv

2) Tug of war is back!  But if you prefer the health bubbles, you now have bubble size, rotation speed, and distance from ship.  

3) An option to enable/disable speedup/slowdown  pickups.  Though there is a bug that the pickups still appear in game, they just dont do anything. 

Other misc things  and comments :   I still find the game more difficult to play than pre christmas update. Colors are brighter? The particles? I cant pin it down for sure without playing an old build again but here are my comments :  

The pulsating rocket trail and environment objects distracts me.  Also, i still prefer the discolored rocket trails.   The speed boost sparks are something id want to turn off too.   In the tug of war end game timer, white on white is too difficult to see.  Its hard to tell how much time you have left, please change that.    



No 1980x1080 resolution in the beta build, but thats a minor gripe. 

A new gameplay feature i noticed that i DID like, is that you can now visibly see when a rocket is charging an attack. Awesome.  But instead of the white lines that indicate this, a colored outerglow or border so that its easier to see?    

Progress is going well, i look forward to it.",1424702138,1425278182,True,9,3,0.6185341477394104,3,True,False,True,False,,,

You can play alone with the AI or with friends in local multiplayer.
The AI is also pretty good and merciless. You may lose a lot in your first tries.

It's recommended to play with a controller. Your hands may hurt after playing a few rounds with the keyboard.
The game is still under development:  Full 4 player support and online mode are coming soon. (Keep in mind that online mode is not 100% comfirmed yet and may not be in the final game. But it will, most likely.)
The development is slow, but it's understandable since it's a small team.

But apart from my personal struggles, it is a fun game to play with friends (jk I have no friends) or by yourself against AI. It has good music and just the right amount of neon that won't make you gouge your eyeballs out.

2.完善了成就系统，测试版的时候只有一个成就，现在就丧心病狂了；

早期评测：
游戏不错，就是很多部分有待开发。目前游戏操作设置里默认的是手柄，没有写键盘。官网上有：WASD+J火箭/K雷/L炸弹，或者方向键+C火箭/X雷/Z炸弹。其中雷是可以对自身造成伤害的。（有问题欢迎指正）
游戏整体很赞，音乐很动感，飞行及射击感觉不错。可惜没有手柄，键盘实在是太累手指了。

呃，至于成就嘛，就一个，登录玩儿一下就圆满了。",1406475917,1432717034,True,2,1,0.54666668176651001,0,True,False,True,False,,,

On manie chacun une fusée avec 3 armes : des tirs qui partent droit (selon l'orientation de la fusée), des mines qui ressemblent plus à des grenades/missiles avec une trajectoire courbe, et des bombes uqi explosent après quelques secondes derrière nous. Et avec ça, il faut se déplacer dans le niveau, éviter les tirs adverses tout en arrivant à en placer une. Le premier qui marque 3 points d'affilée gagne.

Le jeu est diablement fun, avec ses graphismes colorés, ses effets particulièrement réussis grâce aux trainées que laissent les différents tirs et les fusées. Au final on a droit à un ballet magnifique à l'écran, et il y a une grande technicité dans les duels.

AI jest zbytnio dojebany, ciężko się nauczyć grać przeciwko takiej postaci, która Cię może rozjechać jak chce, dlatego twórcy powinni to naprawić, bo nie da się tak grać.
Czekam z niecierpliwością na możliwość rozgrywki on-line. :)

Plusy?
Muzyka,
Rozgrywka (typowo arcade'owa),
Sam motyw (Rockets shooting rockets to other rockets xD)
Sterowanie rakietą

Minusy?
Strzelanie rakietą jest dziwne jak dla mnie,
Przeciwnik AI jest zbyt trudny, i ciężko jest przeciwko niemu wygrać.

The mechanics are simple but solid. The only officially supported game mode in this early Early Access build is one-on-one against the AI, but there's plenty more planned along the way. There's also [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/289760/discussions/0/540741769648418370/]the ability to fundamentally alter the physics and mechanics via a config file[/url] to tweak how the game is played, which is pretty neat. The graphics are basic, but are beautifully stylized and suit the game well. Flying your rocket just feels [i]right[/i] which is a pretty crucial thing to nail.

I was initially drawn by the similarities to Gimbal, another top-down space shooter. That's about where the similarities end though. Gimbal has a variety of different parts and lets you build your own ships, all with a unique way of handling. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS puts everyone on an equal playing field with only a few tools, focusing on individual skill. Gimbal is a very serious take on the genre, whereas ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is as crazy and flamboyant as its art style. Both have their appeal, but ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is infinitely easier to pick up and play, especially on the couch for local multiplayer.

It should also be noted that you should have a controller to play this game. Keyboard controls are included, but the game is designed around the analog capabilities of the thumbstick. It's also far easier to hammer on the buttons of a gamepad to fire rapidly than on your keyboard, though you can make use of the aforementioned config file to up the fire rate of your weapons when you hold down the button.

Lastly, it's important for any Early Access game to have devs that respond to user feedback and actually work on building the game rather than using the Early Access tag as an excuse to sell something that normally would be decried for being incomplete. From my observation of the devs thus far they seem trustworthy, so nothing to worry about on that front. If the concept interests you at all, I'd definitely recommend picking this game up sooner rather than later to get in on it while it's still cheap ($5 at time of writing, $1.25 if you can snag a 75% off coupon).",1400261596,1400297452,True,3,0,0.484126299619674683,3,True,False,True,False,,,

Sadly, I don't own a gamepad. The keyboard controls are not reccomended, but that's ok! The keyboard still works and this game is still fun. 

The game's idea is simple, but currently it is a bit off. I still don't know what the heck is going on when I start up a match; this can be easily solved, and I'll let it slide to the alpha-state of the game.

I recommend this game if you, the person reading this review, is interested in fun, fast paced, arcade-style games.

I totally recommend this and I can't wait for future updated with promised features, game is great even unfinished and worth the few bucks! 

Textual review, if for some reason you don't like videos:
Pros: Beautiful visuals, great electronic music, colours, challenging, simple yet addictive
Cons: Someone might find the AI too hard (but I enjoyed it since I like challenge), early access (but worth it anyway)

This game is about rockets shooting rockets at rockets. Do not expect tanks or helicopters, all you get is in the title it self and the developers have more nice plans for this game in the future. For example coop, a function I personally cannot wait for and I'm so excited for the moment I will be able to play it with my friends! Otherwise you get presented with a stunning visual execution, great fitting music and vibrant challenging gameplay. I certainly hope that this game will not get forgotten, because it's the first early access game that did not disappoint me at the start.

This review will get updated as the game will.

My main critism is that the AI are really good, and it would be nice to have the option to tone them down,  but only slightly.

When I first started playing the game felt hectic and utterly skillless. But after giving it a bit more time I can actually see this being a bloody marvelous competition game if two competent players were competing completely.
The scoring system is a tug of war affair, where every hit brings you closer to winning, however being hit pulls the score back from your end and closer to the enemy's victory which can result theoretically in unlimitely long battles presuming both players are decent.",1399740137,1414008948,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The input could use a little more fine tuning to increase the response time and precision, but it's mostly reliable, certainly better than a lot of games.

The big problems at the moment are that the control scheme isn't explained, and while the keyboard controls are functional, they are a bit awkward (which they acknowledge).  Also, it crashes with two players and two bots (as of 5/9/14).

However, even if you don't want to get this game now (which, for 5 bucks isn't much of a risk) keep it on your radar.  The gameplay is much more nuanced than expected.  The three different weapons don't fire in a set arc for damage, they react with physics in a fashion that adds both a layer of unpredictablility and extra utility.  

For example, while you can shield a straight rocket, you can also fire more rockets at it to deflect it.  Those could then fire off in some unpredicted direction and hit another player.  Is your opponent dropping mines?  Fire a missle at the mine and bounce it in to him.  Things like that.  Straight forward, but nuanced.

A dogfight match can last anywhere between 10 seconds and 10 minutes depending on how well matched the players are, or how poorly they make decisions.  It is also quite good as a compettitive game.  Though chaotic looking, it's chaotic in the way Super Smash Bros is chaotic.  A lot is going on, but everything is based on a cause and effect system.

So if you're looking for a good local co-op game, this is one.  Online multiplayer is planned, but currently (5/9/14) unavailable.  If you prefer to play it in a more complete form, put it on your wishlist.  It is very promising, and for me, already worth a buy.",1399662682,1399662682,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros:

Its some of the most fun ive had with a controller in a while. Its very hard, its very fast, yet I am not getting frustrated. It seems to have a steep learning curve to get to a point where you win more times than lose, and to be honest I still feel like when i win its mainly by pure luck that the AI hit one of my mines.

I can see this being incredibly satisfying when your skill level increases to a point where you can actually land the shots you want to to kill the enemy and not just kill them by spamming buttons :)

The color pallete is nice, very nice.

The graphics style is VERY simple, yet it works and feels like it has to be that way otherwise you really wouldnt be able to see whats happening as things happen so fast.

The music is good, but needs more tracks.

the price is good for the type of game, I think £4 is what i feel happy paying.

Cons:

Very limited gameplay atm. The only gamemode available is ""Dogfight"", which is just you against AI. (I am unsure if local MP is working)

maybe to difficult at times, maybe a difficulty slider would be good.


So final thought is it is a great concept, well executed for a good price. But that is only if the whole game getts fleshed out with multiplayer online, moree game modes, more music, more maps etc. As it stands now I would say buy it if you want to support the devs, but if you want a fully fleshed out game then wait a couple of months and keep checking back to see what people say, as its very light on content at this point and that will not please some people.

[b]Read the tl;dr section if you want at the bottom[/b](too long; didn't read)[b][url=http://steamcommunity.com//id/thegrimofcrazy/recommended/289760/]Better View[/url][/b]

Review will be updated periodically. [b][Last Update: 21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014][/b]
I discuss: What is R3, the gameplay, music, and even the developer for those of you who are worried about Early Access. 

ROCKETS[b]ROCKETS[/b]ROCKETS. I haven't had more fun with a game in awhile, and I have a lot of games. However, I will not make this review solely based on praising the game, but to get a better idea of what the gameplay is like I will explain all the core mechanics and aspects of the game. Pictures will not help you, you must try this out for yourself.

[b]What is ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS?[/b]

[b]R3[/b] is a rocket flying arcade shooter, where you shoot rockets at other rockets. 
Currently there is one single gamemode with local only, but don't let this dissapoint you. All my hours are with its smart 1v1 AI that faces a huge challenge at first. Games can go either way everytime. R3 relies on quick twitch mechanics with its easier to learn gameplay and controls. The learning curve flows very nicely where you will be able to play decently after a couple of hours, but you will always get better. 

You have three weapons.
[b]Standard Rockets[/b](You will use this most of the time.)

[b]Drop Rockets[/b](These are advanced and even I have trouble using them. Many people accidentally hit themselves with it. It takes practice.)
- They drop using physics, so based off your momentum and gravity,
the rockets will drop different ways. Usually you want to use this when the enemy is far below you.

[b]Mine[/b](Static mine that pops out behind you.)

The neat part about R3 is its controls. They aren't relative. Up goes upward, right goes right, etc. This means you have true freedom in how you move. You can pull of neat turns and dodge obstacles at fast speeds. Hitting someone can be sometimes very difficult. 
You have a shield that you activate with a button, it only comes on for about a second and will promptly dissapear. Rockets can't get through your shield but mines can. This helps prevent your uninvitable doom when faced with a barrage of rockets that you realize you can not dodge. It also gives you a little boost, and has a cooldown, so you better be careful when using it.

The standard gamemode is an advantage system. Whoever has a +3 advantage in hits wins. 
Your opponent has 2 points and you hit them. They now have 1 point and you still have 0. When they are back at 0 you can now score. This gamemode influences long high octane battles, however if this sounds off to you still consider getting it as the developer plans to add more gamemodes.

[b]Now what about the Developer!?[/b]
The lead Developer Andy Moore is probably one of the best Early Access indie devs I've seen that not only is commited to adding lots of content, but making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. Don't be afraid that this game will not work for you, he always puts out experimental builds that you can opt into to try and listens to every complaint you have.
He's not the type of developer that goes, ""I like feedback, but I'm not going to actually use said feedback"". He updates in a regular and timely manner and is always in the discussions on the forum.

So don't be afraid to put your money into this project. Infact I encourage you because the price will get higher upon release. Yes, this does seem off putting to a lot of you. However, the game is fairly polished and always recieving updates. They have plans for after release also. No, this won't end up being $60(DayZ... really?). My guess is $10 - $15.

[b]Hot Jams[/b]
The music in this game is absolutely wonderful. It's composed by Power Up Audio, who did the music for Towerfall: Ascension and many others. Check them out! It features upbeat electro space jams. You can listen to it all day. I swear. It currently only includes 4 tracks. Menu theme and two in-game themes and a 2 part win theme. All are good and mastered well. They are adding in more music, but you can tell by the quality that they put effort into it.

[b]What's not good about R3[/b]
- Currently it has a limited options menu(which will be improved soon.)
- It needs a bit more polish on the UI, it's very clean and neat however it's missing a good amount of stuff.
- The game is in Early Access so AI is only complete for 1v1, but they are now testing multi AI currently so I wouldn't worry about it. Honestly, the game is best for 1v1. You will probably most likely play 1v1. Any higher is for more advanced players. 

Alright, I can't think of anymore problems.

[b]Will this game support my controller and keyboard!?[/b]
Most likely: Yes. Literally every recent update he has added support for a bunch of random controllers I've never even heard off. Keyboard controls are good at the moment, but are always getting better. 

[b]What should I be warned about before buying?[/b]
It's Alpha mate. Things change.

[b]What I'm worried about in the Future[/b]

Multiplayer Netccode
This game features a lot of collision and player interaction which is why it must have a good netcode. Netcode is the reason I haven't purchased Brawlhalla. I do expect on Multiplayer release the netcode to be very shoddy, however I hope the developers will work very hard on it, and based on my comment on the dev,  I'm sure he will.

I hope this doesn't require any of our own servers like many indie games have been doing lately. A Peer-to-peer lobby or universal servers will be better.

[b]What I need you to do.[/b]
Buy this game. It won't be good without players. Don't hold off and get it. $5, and you're getting it at a cheaper price than release also. Hate the idea of paying developers for alpha testing? Remember when games didn't tell you they were incomplete till you bought them? You're supporting development and helping this game get out there and faster. By buying in you allow them to afford a multitude of things that will go back into the game. Servers, advertisement, features, music. Just do it.

In current development I give R3 a: [b]7/10[/b] Unique!

Gameplay and Controls: 10 Best!
Settings and UI: 5/10 Average

And I don't do that BS where 7 is average. 5 is average on my scale. 

[b]Have fun Rocketeers![/b]

[b]tl;dr[/b]
+ Well polished.
+ Frequent Updates
+ Dedicated Devloper who releases Expiremental builds to ensure all users are having fun. Have a problem? Just post in the forum, a build will be out in seconds!
+ Hot Jams
+ Great Controls and pacing
+ Support for everything
+ Learning Curve
+ Button Mashing is actually fun?

- Limited Setting(at the moment!)
- Missing a couple of in-game UI elements
- Only two modes avaliable

Andy is allowing the community to edit the level generation, controls, physics, and more with a new file. We're all testing different outcomes of how we believe R3 should play like.

-------21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014-------

Can someone give me a hand here.. the resolution of the game doesnt seem to support my HDtv.. whenever i open the game its literally just the two rockets with the credits and some music.. i cant find a menu, nor can i see a mouse or do anything when i press the entire keyboard of keys.

Here, i have attached a screenshot of the full window of the game. http://prntscr.com/3gpuge

It doesnt do anything from there, no matter what keys or mouse buttons i press it just stays on that screen :I
the only keys that do something are M which turns off the music and ESC which closes the game.

Okay, so basically it doesnt support keyboard control YET.. Though the changelogs state that the game does, however using a controller it works fine.

Here's a Quick Look video if you want to see how this game plays. There's also my review below if you simply want a more in-depth and concise look at the game. 

http://youtu.be/daoI-IMkVk0

Let me start my review by saying this game is extremely bare at this point. It only has local dogfighting between 2 rockets, 2 v 1 underdog mode, or team deathmatch. But damn is the dogfighting good. You get three different ways to attack: by shooting lasers that go straight ahead, dropping bombs that fling out your side and are effected by gravity, and finally mines that shoot out your backside and blow up behind you. Simple right? But try throwing that in with high-speed rocket action. Suddenly you have to plan your shots to cut off the path your enemy is flying. Did the enemy drop a mine? Knock it right back at him with a laser and laugh in his face. Wanna rain death on a pursuer? Fling bombs into the sky and try to weave away from the hail of death. It's simply fun experimenting and trying to become the best pilot. 

And trust me, you'll always know who is the better pilot. You simply can't win the game based solely on luck. You have to dominate your opponent with the tag system they implemented. Basically put, both sides start from scratch, and if you hit the enemy 3 times in a row, it's your win. But if he hits you once, he'll knock a tag off your streak that you'll have to make up for until you fill the gauge in the top of the screen. This means games can end quickly, or be an intense test of endurance between two evenly-matched pilots.

Another great point of this game is the visuals. I love painting the cosmos with my vapor trails. Not only does it enhance the sense of speed you're getting, but it also tells the tale of the dance of death the rockets have been through. And when I say dance, I mean it. The music in this game is super catchy, too.

But let's discuss some negatives now. Just keep in mind that his is Early Access, and most of this will probably get changed in future patches.

*The game is super short in its current state (you do everything there is to do once you play your first match). It's just dogfighting. And while it's good, it might not be enough to sell it at this point for some people.
*There is no progression or anything to unlock. Something that'll keep the player coming back for more is always knowing they'll get rewarded if they play more.
*All the rockets are the same, just colored differently. I'd like to have different looking rockets just for cosmetic purposes at least. Just something to make me feel unique.
*No upgrades to weapons. I'm not talking flat out upgrades that are better than another, but more of something that makes them act differently. Like a laser that fires faster but has limited range. Or a mine that explodes in a larger radius but you can't shoot out as many. Just something to make this game more strategic and diverse would be good.
*No online. This will be fixed later, but it'll remain a negative until it's implemented.
*No tutorial. Sure it's fun flying around and getting absolutely owned by the AI for the first few times, but some sort of menu to list the controls would be nice.
*No options menu. You can't change the sound effects, resolution, or anything else ingame currently.

Now while that may be a lot of negatives, most--if not all--of those while be ironed out in the future. So wait until then if they bother you.

So to wrap this up, this game is going to bud into something very good. And for the low cost of $5 they're handing it out for currently, it certainly worth picking it up even now.

*As a side note, I will (hopefully) update this review as major patches are released or just do it again once it's finally released. Just yell at me and I'll come running to take another look if I forget.*",1399093439,1400738969,True,42,1,0.64995872974395752,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The further your mouse got from the rocket, the more acceleration would be used. 

Controls:
I am not all together disappointed with the controls of RRR, and I'm willing to take a learning curve. The game is quite bare at the moment, though I can't really complain, because It's Early Access, and I'm sure the Devs will make various revisions to the current game's state, to boot I did only pay about $2.50 a copy realistically. I'm excited to see where the game goes, and possible revisions to the mouse and keyboard controls as I do not own a controller, which is the currently recommended by RRR.
Weapons/Bombs/Physics/Etc:
Not disappointed at all, Physics/reactions to being hit are appropriate, music/sound affects are good.

It's Early Access so take it with a grain of salt, I don't know how often the Devs intend on pushing out updates, but for the current price and the hope of future revisions and addons to it's current state, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is well worth $5.",1399078172,1399078172,True,11,0,0.555638670921325684,0,False,False,True,False,,,

At first I was very confused with how I controlled my rocket, thinking it was relative, but then I realized the up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down, left goes left, and right goes right.

I then started pressing WASD to see what it would do. A shoots smaller rockets, and S drops bombs. 

Also, my resolution is stuck at 800x600, for some reason. This game needs an options menu, or even just a seperate executable to change the resolution. 

For positive, well, the music is amazing!! This game is also very beautiful, and fast paced. It has a feel to it... It's great. And the light trails, wow. The AI is very smart, also. Still haven't won a battle.

Anyway, this is a great game, and has a lot of potential for future multiplayer, but I feel it needs a tutorial and some options.
Pick it up, though, it's worth it!

EDIT: It seems the developer added some settings! That's great, he even added a controls page. I'm loving the game and it fixed most of its problems!

 I know that this game will be also very good for the keyboard in the future, because right now it seems the developer still seems uncertain about the current controls. Hoping for the best!

I am a member of TEAM ROCKETS so my review would be biased and terrible for you. But we would like to hear your feedback; we check the steam forums many times a day!

But if you want to know what I really think about ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS, let's get *serious* for a moment.

I've been a game developer for many years. A lot of times you work on an exciting idea that seems like it might work, and a lot of times you work on things just out of momentum, and sometimes you wake up and discover you're working on something you should have cancelled months ago. It's sorta the way life goes, as a developer; it's hard to objectively see what you are working on as anything but ""good."" A lot of the time it's hard to even find playtesters to help you out.

Sometimes, though - rarely - an idea comes along that hits you like falling in love does. You jump out of bed every day to work on it. You can't stop thinking about it. The whole world gets more vibrant, and you see your idea everywhere. Everyone you show the early prototypes to instantly get it and also fall in love. You start gaining fans and all you have is a title screen or a doodle on a napkin... And they aren't friends or family. This kind of experience is incredibly rare, and I am stupendously honoured to be feeling it for ROCKETS right now.

I know I'm in the thick of it right now, and I still have those rose-colored glasses on, but I think I will fondly look back on ROCKETS for the rest of my life. It may not be my best technical work, it may be unfinished right now, and it may not become a commercial success (I'm writing this before the Early Access launch!), but by golly does this game feel right in every way.

It feels incredible to build, it feels incredible to play, and it feels incredible to be a part of this talented team.

I hope you'll fall in love with the game like I did.",1398791232,1398791232,True,202,3,0.680348992347717285,11,False,False,True,False,,,
