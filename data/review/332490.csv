1，没有中文，对于游戏游玩问题不大，多摸索摸索查一查关键单词就可以了，但是我更想知道舰船的名称这样会更有感觉。
2，船体模型单一，无论是英军，美军，德军等等都是用的一套船的模型，建议可以增加以及不同国家的船模型，例如美国的就可以以北卡或者衣阿华为模型，英国可以用乔治五世级，德国可以用格奈森瑙，俾斯麦等等。
3，难度跨度稍微有点大，打中等难度乱打，玩最高难度被乱打。
4，可以优化一下舰长系统。
5，开局不能布置船的位置有点伤，全是随机的，有些地图地形有点难受，他恰好又给你分兵，又把航母布置在极为阴间的位置。
6，船太少了，准确的说是船的模板太少了，作为一个战舰世界玩家，战舰不止有CV，BB，CA，DD，等等，航母可以分成护航航母（如博格）和那种大的航母（如埃塞克斯，翔鹤等等），战列舰也有条约型，高速战列舰，战列巡洋舰和一些老式的无畏舰等等，巡洋也有轻重之分。建议可以多加几个不同的模板。
7，武器太少了，就以战列舰为例即使不分口径他也只有三联装主炮，双联装和四联装没有体现，巡洋舰也是一样的，只有双联装，没有三联装和单门火炮，副炮和鱼雷就更不用说了，没有体现阵营特色（比如可以增加日系鱼雷射程和威力，增加德系副炮射程，增强美系两用炮的效率等）。
8，地图可以稍微做大一点点，无论是总的大地图和作战小地图，大地图方面一个格子感觉跨度稍大，可以多划分几格，小地图也可以做大，不然还没有排兵布阵就打起来了，此外，这对航母也不公平，开局2回合就处于对方战列舰射程之内了。
9，最后，可以增加天气系统，优化海平面与岛屿，增加一些特别舰种和一些战术卡片。",1691550398,1691550398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There is a bug that could be worked out, sometimes the game won't register that a ship has hit 0% health so you have to waste one more ammunition to sink it and it can cost you, your ships life. For example in one ships turn I used up all my ammunition on a cruiser to get the enemy battleship to 0% health and somehow the mf was still floating, dude clearly had no health left, that same mf sunk my cruiser immediately after I ended my turn, it pissed me off. I have also come to find that this game shows just how important the key turning points were during the second world war. In the Atlantic campaign I feel like whoever knocks out the main force first, and captures the entire English, & Mediterranean, channels the quickest. pretty much achieves victory, for the entire war/campaign. In the pacific the key points kinda vary, but I have found the key points to commonly be the islands that line up towards Japan and that area. That and the sea zones around the Alaska/Canada, and the Australia/New Zealand, areas.

- The AI isn't very smart.  It has a tendency to keep attacking the same position over and over again, losing badly each time before retreating.  (Retreating costs you half your ships).  After 4 or 5 repetitions of this, you can steamroll the map without much issue.
- When you enter battle mode, your ships are apparently randomly placed.  This makes zero tactical sense and can actually cost you the battle if your key ships end up too close to the enemy fortifications (Seriously, what the hell was the dev thinking here??)
- The primary effect of increasing the difficulty level is to reduce the number of targeting reticles you have to help figure out ranges.  This is not adding actual difficulty in the least.  Frankly, I was hoping this game would include radar as it was available in primitive form in the Pacific theater, so rangefinding manually to begin with is a bit archaic.  (And tedious)
- Battleships are weaker than you might expect and can be disabled by even a small enemy fleet if they get lucky.  The only actual way to defeat a battleship is to overwhelm it with a large fleet or from a safe distance using airstrikes.
- I have seen a single ship turn away an airstrike due to having enough AA capability - it takes an entire fleet to do this, a single ship cannot in any circumstance.
- The game needs a keyboard shortcut to skip a given ship's turn.  While we're at it, there needs to be a toggle to autoskip all transports; they're almost worthless in battle and I never found a situation where I actually needed to move one unless it was in the way.
- There is no differentiation between ship classes.  A destroyer is a destroyer, a battleship is a battleship.  Cruisers are cruisers, forget about CLs vs CAs.  This oversimplification kills a lot of nuance, as any WW2 buff knows that an Iowa class battleship and an Arkansas class battleship are quite different in terms of their capabilities.

The interface is pretty clean and easy to use. Finding the range for the guns takes practise and doesn't always seem consistent - I have learned that the range you select is were shells would drop into the water, but since ships have height, aim further out to get a nice solid hit on them. A sub, however, being lower, needs more accuracy and you want the shells to drop right onto it, so aim for its exact location.

Frigates seem pretty useless due to being very lightweight. So do submarines, because they travel so slowly that often the engagement is over before they can reach a target. They are very hampered around islands because of their small turning circle, so best used in open sea or for defence. Once on target, those two torpedos inflict serious damage - but actually getting your sub into range is tricky.

Carriers are good in the early campaign, but as soon as the AI gets a decent air defence, their use is limited because flights get taken down easily. Their only use then is recon - and cruisers do that just as well. Having said that, a carrier with decent XP can take out land-based artillery in one or two raids. And THAT is VERY useful when taking an island. It's that or battleships - and the land artillery has the same range as a battleship. So a couple of good carriers will make a huge difference in the final stages.

Cruisers are awesome for their firepower, but battleships are even better. That is the strongest unit in the game, with guns which have the longest range. And range is important, here. Being able to shoot without being in range oneself is a huge advantage.

Drawbacks: it's a bit easy. I completed the entire first campaign on my first try, and had overwhelming firepower by the final battle. I needed only one of the two massive fleets I had created (one out of Hawaii, one out of Australia) and I don't think I took a single loss to my fleet in the final battle. Carriers took care of the land-base artillery in the first 3 turns, and my battleships made short work of the cruisers and then the airbase.

The AI is very poor at aiming, so all else being equal, two ships of equal capabilities facing off should see the human player win with very little difficulty. The AI also has no discernible strategy other than ""move towards the opponent and fire when in range"" - unless vastly outnumbered, when it hides in a corner.

Having groups of ships sail together is an obvious advantage with the combined firepower - but the AI just ignores that. It is also a problem when you first enter an area. The AI deploys your ships for you, however it sees fit. I cannot spot a pattern, but I want destroyers with my ships because they can spot submarines. But it's quite possible that your two destroyers will be deployed half way over the map to the rest of your fleet, making the others very vulnerable. Luckily, the AI only used a few subs against me. Not being able to set up your own line of battle is a huge strategic disappointment in the game. In real life, the Admiral in charge would have had maps of the target area, and would have sailed there in good order, to line up as per his battle plan. There really is no need to randomly scatter the player's forces over the map.

It shouldn't be too hard to allow the player to drag and drop their ships, or to provide a few standard formations. Or, even, to group all the player's ships together in good order by default, instead of spreading them out. As it stands, and because of the way turns work (ships with higher XP moving first) it is quite possible to ram one of your own ships by mistake on the initial moves, simply by ordering them to go straight ahead and at full speed.

Ships do not move realistically, either. You give the rudder a direction and an amount of power, and they move accordingly - then halt. One turn might be full speed ahead, and the other turn full reverse. There is no wave movement, or wind to take into account. Aim your guns, give a distance and your shells will always drop exactly where expected. This is really OP, because on (say) a battleship, one can use one smaller gun to range-find the enemy and then use the other 2 side-guns to batter it with 2 shells per gun, before moving onto the two big guns and battering it with them, too. The only adjustments needed will be slight angle changes as you switch between guns and maybe a little distance.

There's also a weird ""levelling up"" system. For some reason, one cannot buy all the ship types at the start of the game. They become unlocked gradually. That's very odd. ""Sorry, Admiral, we cannot let you order a new Carrier before you have engaged the Japanese a few times"" really makes no sense. 

(Edit: reading another review, I learned that the locks can be disabled in the options - that would have been handy to know up-front. I remain at a loss at to what a ""level"" means, though)


There are also some rather odd sparkley things in the sea. If you sail over them, you get a special ""card"", like in a board game. I got a ""free reconnasance flight anywhere on the map"". But there was no discernable way to use it, and I had enough carriers and cruisers anyway.

Plus, by that time in the battle, I could see pretty much the entire map due to line of sight of my ships, and I knew where all my targets were. It's a strange addition which adds nothing of value.

It is by no means a challenging game. It is not a detailed simulation. It is not realistic. But it is a fun way to while away a few hours. I grabbed it on sale and I am quite happy with the VFM that I got. In a couple of days I will try the Atlantic campaign, too. I will take to this game once in a while when I have a couple of hours to kill and don't feel like being hugely challenged.

Damage to systems is relatively random for you but on the hardest AI difficulty you can count on always being on the receiving end of major damage with every salvo.

Pros:
+ easy to see what the game will be like before buying.  (a) strategic map giving context to individual battles (b) Worms-style individual battles
+ battle system good - a lot of sensible things happen e.g a shot lands in the water just next to the ship, it damages the ship a little, an extra 3 metres away it doesn't.  Or the fact that when a ship is hit, weapons can be damaged or the hull damaged - both will weaken the ship but sometimes a very weak enemy will still have all weapons firing and therefore be very dangerous (a near dead battleship destroyed a fullhealth destroyer of mine and nearly took out a 2nd before I learnt this lesson...).
+ some depth in choosing ship combos and favourite weapons aside from manoeuvring ships.  Torpedos have a short range but boy do they hurt.
+ responsive and active dev

Cons:
- battles can be a little slow for some and enjoyment seems to depend on whether you like angles/numbers.  I do.  If you don't, give this game a miss.
- strategic map could have extra layers to make it more like a Total War game e.g. building various buildings that unlock more powerful ships etc

- Satisfying combat
- A good assortment of historical ship types
- Challenges both historical and tactical

Not perfect though:
- A lot of simplifications were made for game balance purposes, so don't expect a high level of authenticity.  Naval historians may cringe from time to time.
- The ""Unlock"" system is how the game forces you to ""learn"" by proceeding through increasingly complex battles until you ""earn"" the right to build certain ship types.  However, it's not hard to go through the battles on medium difficulty level, and to unlock the most valuable stuff takes only a few hours of gameplay.  I honestly did not mind going through it.

Started with VR 1st and almost had to learn how to gauge distances / aim all over again trying 2D]

TD:LR: Fun / engaging God mode / top down WW2 Battleship mainly artillery fire strategy game that has decent VR graphics (using HTC Vive). 

To be honest as a long time strategy / war game lover but short time VR'er....originally the thought of doing strategy game in VR seemed like something that would be fairly lame in comparison to high detail & resolution monitor viewing? To my surprise this BF2 is engaging and fun TBS strategy game in VR. FIrst right off the bat...If you suck at judging distances for artillery fire then this might be frustrating to you. Majority of the fire power is floating or fixed artillery and you have to basically dial in distance estimates (vs. cannon elevation to reach those distances). Think Worms games...but only in setting of god mode above battleships of WW2. It's not overly complex but must be able to judge distances. If you're WW2 war game fan, this game has enough detail that is engaging but not mired in history report. If you target parts of ships correctly, you can damage specific areas and zoom in far enough and see matching visual damage. There's a bit of grand strategy in the campaign mode as you have to shift around fleets to create / combine them, attack enemy and still defend territories. But mostly it's TBS battle map strategy.

Game does have some room for improvement:
- It was designed for you to stand and play in VR. Which is lame because if you could set the viewing height yourself, you could easily play it sitting down too. But because of limited clarity of VR text + game has stuff on drawing boards at upward angle can make  hard to read some of text....unless you stand and center your goggles. This is bad design flaw for VR'ing. 
- Campaign starting battle  layout is predetermined by Ai. This can be lame as you're best / slowest ships can be placed completely exposed to enemy fire w/o any means to you to initially protect them. They can also be placed far out of range and put rest of fleet at stand still to wait for them to catch up. Even if it would be too difficult to program basic Battleships board game layout choice, should be able to make some type of rudimentary fleet layout choice but there's nothing?
- Worst game flaw can be show stopper. Ship tracks are not shown at all, except wakes after-choice-has-been-made visuals. Sometimes in start of that Ai pre-determined fleet layout it stacks them VERY CLOSE. Different ships have different speed and turning radiuses. You will eventually have at least 2 ships collide because you can't eyeball guess correct speed + turning radius for every ship you can possibly have. Yes..that cute little frigate can cripple your mighty warship by just running into back of it. There really should be some type of track line that lays down so you can make sure your ships won't strike each other. Understand they did this for ""realism"" but real ships have quartermasters that plot out ship's course on paper so that doesnt happen. 
- Combine that plus campaign mode is perma-death / ironman. So ya just accidentally rammed your bestest ship. Well, ya did a save so you can just quit and start over right? Nope. You quit and auto lose 1/2 your fleet in that battle. And it doesnt matter if you Steam VR exit out of the game. Basically, you cripple on or start your campain over again...

I would say it's a good blend of accessability and reasonable depth. There is the obvious fire control, where you must find the correct bearing and range for your guns, but also a whole lot of other aspects to take into consideration. Easy to get into, but still deep enough to keep it interesting.

On a tactical level, you need to also move your ships in a tactically sound fashion to bring them into range, and even more importantly maneuver them to optimize the amount of gun turrets and torpedo launchers of your ships to be able participate in the exchange of volleys. The tactical map also contains some special areas which when taken produce special cards granting you different abilities to use in the battle, like extra recon flights, air strikes, field repairs, range finders etc. 

You can also perform ship refitting between battles, where you can change the weapons of your choosing for each individual ship (with restraints of the weapon slot provided by the ship class) to suit your taste and style of play. Similar kind of refitting is also possible when building new ships either in custom battles or campaign dock regions. 

This brings in the strategic layer, which is a bit thin but still there. In campaign mode you must decide which regions to defend, which to possibly forfeit and which to aim your invasions into. The regions with dock facilities enable you to spend your industrial points on building new ships, and the regions may also contain airfields and shore batteries to help you defend them. Every region also produces a certain amount of industrial points per turn.

The only real grievance I have so far with this game is the locking system, with puts part of the content behind an xp barrier, requiring you to fight a certain amount of battles for XP to unlock maps, game modes, ships, weaponry etc. It feels kind of silly to first do a quick battle to be able to start the first campaign, and then realize your ability to produce ships different classes is restricted to only a few of the smallest classes until your XP warrants more. All this while the AI seems to be happily churning out ships of every class. It's still an obstacle that can be overcome by grinding, but certainly feels unnecessary.",1531919690,1531919736,True,9,0,0.624383211135864258,0,True,False,False,False,,1547785431.0,Thanks for the review and feedback.

1. [i]Battle Fleet 2[/i] очень похож на [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i], но здесь есть многопользовательская игра.
2. Разведка. В [i]Battle Fleet 2[/i] играет значительную роль, как на стратегической карте, так и непосредственно в бою. В [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] разведки нет, хотя это и реалистично на предлагаемых дистанциях. 
3. Как и [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] игра чертовски проста в освоении, но тем не менее имеет глубокие и разносторонние игровые механики. 

[b]... et contra[/b]

Соответственно все минусы происходят от сравнения с [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i].

1. Не такой-то графон, и это при том, что обе игры, это порт с ведра, но [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] на ПК выглядит просто отлично и её не стыдно показать даже другу Коле, который котирует исключительно AAA YOBA games.
2. Модель повреждений. Да, она есть, можно выводить из строя разные узлы и элементы корабля, но с другой стороны имеем натуральную полоску хэпэ, которую увлекательно пилим, самым классическим образом. В [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] все хэпэ так ловко спрятаны в модель повреждений, что о них и не догадываешься. В целом модель повреждений в [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] намного сложнее, например корабли с течью дают определённый крен и т.п.
3. В [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] более интересно реализована работа авиации с авианесущих кораблей.
4. В [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] более интересно реализованы подводные лодки.

Тем не менее, пока в [i]Atlantic Fleet[/i] нет (и не предвидется) многопользовательской игры, для тех, кому, как и мне этот пункт более чем важен я бы рекомендовал обратить внимание на [i]Battle Fleet 2[/i].",1525297878,1525297878,True,8,0,0.633026480674743652,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm playing it in VR. 
Though the graphics are pretty simple, this is a super hard turn based strategy game and there's not enough of that in VR.

If you're craving something turn based, this will provide you hours and hours of fun.

The game seems to be extremely long compared to most VR games with multiple campaigns and lots of stuff to unlock.

Don't listen to the negative reviews.
People seem to be complaining about things being locked at first, but if it were all unlocked right at the beginning, the game would be too easy.

This is hard enough that I had to start over multiple times in order to get a feel for how careful you have to be in planning things, but once I got going, it's a lot more satifiying to play a game of this caliber. The unlocks also reward you for winning battles and leveling up just like any game of this type needs so I don't get that complaint.

I couldn't recommend this more.

I hope the developer continues to make turn based games in VR.

Reason: Developer responded to main critisism and added in the option to remove the gating system to the game.  Original review unchanged so you can decide for yourself. 

Other: They have also removed turn cool down on larger guns that I am not sure yet if I like or not.  

Summary: 
Good turn based naval game ruined by a pointless (new) gate/unlock system. If you can live with the unlock system, then it could be worth a shot. 

In Depth
Used to play this game, it was a fun turn based naval game with a good amount of tactical flexibility in the ship upgrade system.  

Alas imagine my surprise when I came back and everything is now ""locked"" behind some form of arbitrary progression system.  Want to play campaign?  Nope, have to unlock via playing a single battle first.  Want to play Japan in that single battle?  Nope!  Locked!  Want to choose your force for that battle?  hahah no...

I stopped at that point.  I also read that ship classes, maps, campaigns and upgrades are all now locked behind the progression system.  

So basically content I could access (Campaign, full ship & upgrade roster, multiple nations etc) is now unavailable until I grind it open.  

Sorry but that is a terrible decesion in my opinion and pretty much removed my desire to get back into the game and I cannot recommend it at this point.  I do not see the benefit of gating content behind a grind, some of it even only unlocks via MP (of which I have no interest in).  

That being said, prior to the unfortunate update, this was a really good game and I will give some points below for people who do not mind the gating system.  

The game operates on a turn based system with move and fire actions seperate.  Each ship class could be customized with various weaponry giving you a lot of tactical flexibility.  For example a Frigate might have 3 small weapon slots that each have their own aiming cones (area they can fire in) depending on their location on the ship).  Example of weapon systems are light guns, AA guns, Torpedoes etc.  

They balanced the power of weapons quite well.  For example Light Guns could fire every turn, medium guns (on cruisers) could fire every 2 turns, Big Guns (Battleships) every 3, this made the larger ships very powerful but also vulnerable to massed frigate/destroyer torpedo runs which made it necessary to have adequate escorts.  This gave every ship class a proper purpose. 

To fire you have to calculate/estimate distance and direction for guns which while challenging to start you kind of learn distances quite quickly but still meant there was some player skill involved in the actual shooting process.  

In summary, good turn based naval game ruined by a pointless gate/unlock system. If you can live with the unlock system, then it could be worth a shot.",1517066995,1549651049,True,2,0,0,17,True,False,False,False,,1547785995.0,"Thanks for the review and feedback.

It is also great that achievements are not dependent on multiplayer, as I really dislike multiplayer. You can get all the achievements with singleplayer missions and campaign, which is FANTASTIC. 

Multiplayer unlocks a handful of extra maps for quick missions, which are non-essential but add a bit of variety, so I might try it just for fun. But it is so nice to have multiplayer as an option, rather than a necessity - my thanks to the developers!

Needless to say, I am glad I did not buy this at anywhere close to full price. It's about as fun as watching paint dry and about as tactical. Worse yet, most of the content is locked even though you pay for the game. 

The elephant in the room is that the game has content locked. Why, in a single player game, is content locked behind skirmishes and winning campaigns (both sides) is one of the dumbest design decisions I've ever run across. For instance, if you want to play the Atlantic campaign then you get to perform the following:

Play at leat one skirmish to unlock the Pacific campaign.
Win the entire campaign as the US.
Win the entire campaign as the Japanese.

There's probably some other MP unlocks in there as well. What is the purpose? Some unlocks are via multiplayer, which is absoutely dead. This fact alone makes the game a massive avoid. Why, for God's sake, would you do that to your customers? If you've worked hard on your game, let your customers actually play it!!!

As for the ""gameplay"", it's unimaginative and boring. I know that sounds harsh but it is the only way to describe it. The game is a top down version of Worms. You have your ships, sail them around in a turn based map (slowly) and fire away by a combination of picking the direction (this isn't a challenge) and guessing the power (which is like a low-rent version of Worms). You move a small amount, aim, pick your power and fire 2 or 3 times. You then go to your next ship and  do the same thing. You then wait for the AI to do the same with their ships. Repeat ad naseum. That's the game, folks. That's all there is. 

It has none of the charm of Worms and I kid you not that I've played more fun Flash versions of this kind of gameplay. Theres no reward or payoff. Hits are met by dull sound effects and an even duller ""explosion"" graphic. There's no payoff here for a job well done. It's slow and the only challenge is that it seems the AI ships will always get some sort of advantage. Play the first scenario and your ships have popguns while the enemy ships can fire torpedos that take half your health away. I truly cannot believe how limited this game seems to be.

The scoring system is also more than a bit off. I finished one scenario where I was about to sink the last enemy ship when the timer (why is there a turn limit?) ran out. I lost. For some reason. I have no idea. But worse yet, I don't care. This game isn't worth the time because there's no compelling gameplay.  Guessing at power meters isn't the type of thing that I find entertaining or rewarding. I guess on the positive side is that if you do want a low-rent, charmless, WWII version of Worms then the game works. But unless you have a hankering that specific, then steer clear of this one.",1510192193,1510192504,False,10,0,0.590840697288513184,0,False,False,False,False,,1547786275.0,"[UPDATE] We have just released the 1.6 update that changes the unlock system and also allows players to bypass it if they wish.

You move a unit using a compass and a power meter that forces you to blindly guess at where you're going, then shoot at enemies where direciton is known, but you have to again eyeball the distance.  

Everything is hidden behind a completely ridiculous ""Unlock"" system, (after already being released and balanced and playtested without it) apparently because Call of Duty made those things popular.  However, instead of unlocking things like battleships after using heavy cruisers or unlocking more modern cruisers after using out-of-date starting ones, you instead unlock the single player campaign by playing multiplayer maps.  Also, multiplayer maps are locked behind single player campaign goals.  So screw your own preferred play style, play the way that the devs mandated!

Multiplayer is basically dead, there's only a half-dozen players online when I look, and they're all in games, so I hope you're prepared to wait around for hours to play a multiplayer game you probably don't want to play, anyway, to unlock the single player maps you presumably do want to play.  

So, starting out, you're stuck with a quick play battle, which might be an OK idea as a no-risk tutorial before a campaign... but then, every option is locked out, so I don't get to select any of my ships. Then, besides one destroyer, I'm stuck with nothing but slow frigates that can't even fire forwards and pea shooter cannons that deal 6 damage to a 300-HP ship. Meanwhile, the enemy gets a cruiser that insta-gibs a ship of mine per turn, has longer range, and gets nothing but criticals, getting a bridge shot killing my destroyer's captain (which is basically the same as sinking the ship) plus a frigate in the first exchange of gunfire.  My completely worthless frigates are completely ineffectual at dealing any damage, which is generally why NOBODY WOULD EVER WANT TO TAKE AN ANTI-SUB ESCORT SHIP INTO A DIRECT SURFACE ENGAGEMENT AND NOBODY WOULD PICK THAT CLASS OF SHIP WILLINGLY, even having their torpedoes (which only fire in a TINY arc basically DIRECTLY behind them while how much you turn when you spin the wheel is PARTLY RANDOMIZED) deal negligible damage to the apparently relatively-god-tier light cruiser.  

The game is also absurdly slow.  You have to stop on your turns constantly because you're completely eyeballing and guessing at everything you do, but the enemy turns take forever as well, as each individual cannon has to get its own individual shot, and each cannon can fire multiple times per turn.  When a torpedo is launched, the game zooms in so close on it that you can't see anything but the featureless water and the torpedo so there isn't even any sense of where the torpedo is or where it's going, plays some pinging active sonar sound (which is absurdly anachronistic on an iron-sights straight-running torpedo), and then either does 2 damage or gets a critical hit and instantly destroys the ship, all on the whims of the RNG. Torpedoes also finish their whole run before anything else gets to move again, and you don't need to worry so much about range since it just travels until it hits something or runs out of range, so aiming torpedoes is LUDICROUSLY easy so long as they're in range and the proper fire arc.  This is ""balanced"" by making them worthless whenever you use them, but the AI apparently gets crits all day.

Basically, nothing about this game is tactical, it's all about guesstimating distances (which can be an OK gameplay mechanic, if not an exciting one when you have so little variation in weapons), and everything else is just RNG bullshit.  Sure, range guesstimation is partly skill, but I basically figured out how to hit with my second shot, and was hitting with each shot by my third ship, while the AI was routinely missing with its first 1/3rd of its shots, but it still didn't matter, I had the smaller boat.  You win if you get lucky and the game decides to give you the bigger ships that take no damage from littler ships and insta-gib one or two ships a round, and if you get the littler ships, just reset until you do.  I couldn't stomach the single-player enough to even try multiplayer, but so long as you don't get to select your own ships, and ship types have such ludicrous advantages over one another, it still just amounts to whoever the RNG gave the battleship curb-stomping any but the most blind and incompetent range-guesstimators.

Even coming back and re-randomizing things until I get the bigger ship and easily stomp the enemy has no meaning or value, because there's no sense of value or reward, it wasn't my skill that won, it's just the RNG.

I was looking forward to playing historical Atlantic campaign. Unfortunately in order to unlock such mode I have to win Pacific historical campaign twice (both as US and Japan).

It's the first game I've played in years where I didn't mind playing for hours on end.
It may be a little repetitive, but I really felt like I HAD to win. I can play for 20 minutes or lose hours of sleep over it. I can save a game at any time (although I really wish these saved games were saved to Steam instead of locally - my laptop doesn't have the same saved games my desktop does).
Like other reviewers have said, there's no real resource managment, no ""politics"" involved - just fighting between ships and aircraft. It's more like Risk than about any other game I can think of; you have to have certain types of ships to hold areas you've won; there a ""zones"" you're trying to take over. You can only move a ship once in a turn so you have to plan carefully. Turns can take as long as you'd like, so there's no rush. If ships are damaged during a battle, they retain that damage even in future battles unless you repair them. To repair them, they have to be in ""zones"" where a shipyard is without moving for an entire turn. You do earn money based on which properties you control at the end of the turn. You use this money to build more ships which can only originate at specific points. These ships can be customized to some extent when you ""build"" them.
I love the graphics. The water looks cool, the ships look cool. There are no microtransactions: you buy the game and you're done. Still, I wish there was some DLC.
I really only have a very complaints: damage is determined randomly no matter where you hit another ship. If you hit the rear end, it might still show ""bridge damaged"" instead of a rudder. It would be neat to be able to zoom completely into your ships during a battle. AI will waste some time barely moving some ships at all, yet taking the time to move them anyway. AI doesn't seem to realize exactly how to correct for its miss. You have NO control over which ships you can move or in what order - sometimes a ship is in the way of another, but you have no choice over which you can move first. It would be neat to have cut scenes of ships being repaired when that happens instead of a bland ""3 ships were repaired"" text at the top of the screen.

However, the down side is that because it is ""turn based"" and there are so many units, and the AI goes through turns invidividually (which can really suck when AI has like 15 ships) it is a VERY slow game. 

on the strategic map you can see where to move your fleets, guess enemy positions or send planes to scout them it is cool. but the battle phase..literally one match where the enemy attacks you may take almost an hour (and this doesn't even count when game progresses and you are entering into a battle one after another (30-45 min matches x 5 in succession is just sooooo  slow. 

other than the very very slow paced combat, it is fun. I just wish there was an auto option for when your forces are crazy superior to the enemy or vice versa, so you could quick battle that combat and not waste 30 min's on a battle you know you can't lose or alternatively can't win. it just turns into a time sink. 

if they fix this issue, yes get the game. if not, well then do you long tedious drawn out battles where you know the outcome once a match starts? well then look no further as half your battles will involve this.

I definitely feel you on the speed thing. (I'm a big HoMM / Might and Magic Heroes player and I blast that auto combat all day.) 

When I play Battle Fleet 2, the first thing I do is crank that game speed up to maximum. It speeds things along SIGNIFICANTLY, and if you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend it. 

Once you're in a match, you'll see a gear icon towards the top right of the screen. In there, there's the ""Game Speed"" option.

For winning battles, there's no fast solution, but for losing battles, if you hit that gear icon and select ""End Mission"", you'll lose half of your ships and the territory. In many cases, that might even be better tactically to keep your forces up.

Hope that helps! We're happy you liked the core of the game, and with some speed improvements, that you'll continue to enjoy Battle Fleet 2.

Die Steuerung klappt prima, mit einem Grip-Button verschiebt man die Karte mit beiden Grips gleichzeitig zoomt man. Der Rest ist selbsterklärend.

A great game for the casual player - with online options for those who like that (not me)

The game is very easy to learn, although I still need to learn how to prevent my submarines to crash onto Islands ;)

Every ship has it's own characteristics, giving the game a historical flavor, without making it complicated for the player. Aiming is partly done by being accurate and partly by your skill of guessing the distance. This makes that when you hit it feels like YOU achieved something, making the sinking of an enemy ship feel like a victory.

The game starts with just a few options to play, but soon enough new options will become available. I was worried about the online games I needed to play to open specific options, but just one message to the developer made him opening these parts of the game for me (during Xmas none the less!!!).

Not just the Japanese and German campaigns, but to even use them in a quick battle (one off skirmish vs the AI).

En vrac ce que j'aime bien :

L'assistance au tir est limitée, (quelques cercles de distance) donc à moins d'avoir vraiment le compas dans l'oeil à chaque tour se pose la question du compromis entre tirs de réglages et tirs pour faire mal.

Les navires ont des emplacements tourelles aux arcs de tir bien différenciés, lors de gros engagements chaque mouvement est un casse-tête d'orientation pour optimiser les tirs.

Lors de l'achat d'un navire les tourelles sont dans une certaine mesure paramétrables : un petit croiseur tout canon, un peu d'AA ou de lance-torpille ? Chaque type de tourelle ayant des caractéristique dégâts, fréquence de tir, portée, les choix ne sont pas si anodins qu'il y parait.

La navigation aussi est laissé entièrement à la charge du joueur et le risque de collision est réel. La aussi compromis à trouver entre position idéale et risque de taper le voisin ou les hauts fonds.

Collision aussi lors de tirs dont les trajectoires tiennent compte de l'élévation. Vous tirez tendu par dessus un allié, il en prend plein la tête. Vous vous collez à une ile, c'est la colline qui déguste, pas la cible de l'autre côté. Ca marche aussi pour l'IA, ce qui veut dire que l'on peut utiliser le terrain comme écran. Bon, il y a des effets pervers du décor destructible rigolos mais pas très réalistes comme dégommer une batterie cotiêre trop près de la plage à la torpille ou creuser un lac salé au milieu d'une ile^^

Sympa aussi les effets de zone. Les gros obus peuvent faire mal même en tombant à côté. Dans certains cas on peut toucher plusieurs navires avec la même salve. Pareil pour les attaques aériennes, une bonne orientation peut impacter plusieurs cibles très proches. A noter que plus les navires sont proches, plus la DCA est forte. Le placement défensif est aussi important que l'offensif.

La visibilité de la fumée des dégats à travers le brouillard de guerre. D'un point de vue principe de brouillard de guerre ça parait crétin et je ne suis pas sur que ce soit voulu mais sur l'océan une fumée ça se voit, alors ça m'a bien plu.

Ce que j'ai fini par apprécier :

Le non positionnement initial.  Au départ ça m'a vraiment saoûlé, se retrouver avec un croiseur AA à l'opposé de la flotte de l'autre côté d'une ile qu'il mettra 10 tours à contourner... pfff. Mais à l'usage j'ai fini par trouver que ça rajoute à l'ambiance et à la reflexion. On se retrouve dans une situation pas si irréaliste où les flotilles arrivent un peu en vrac au rappel sur un contact et les premiers tours consistent à organiser tout ça sans se retrouver dans une position déplorable. Tactiquement ça a du sens.

Ce qui pose problème :

La difficulté n'est pas au rendez-vous. L'IA est faiblarde et à tendance à s'éparpiller dans des flottes légères. Le niveau le plus élevé lui donne une capacité à faire mouche quasi à tout coup mais ne la rend pas plus intelligente. Ca ne m'a pas gêné, jouer avec comme objectif personnel de prendre le moins de dégâts possibles me suffit. Ca doit bien donner en multi, mais je joue en solo et je n'ai aucune idée de sa fréquentation.

Le réalisme est minimal. A part  les noms des navires et des lieux, comment dire...  c'est un jeu quoi. Personnellement ça m'a satisfait car j'y ai trouvé une vrai ambiance de combat naval dans les questions tactiques à se poser mais c'est vrai qu'il y a pas mal de choses qui pourraient être mieux.
Les vaisseaux d'un type sont tous les mêmes (7 catégories du cargo au porte-avions).
Je n'ai pas trouver comment les renommer donc au bout d'un moment on a des transports machin, machin 1....,
Les flottes initiales des campagnes sont à peu près cohérentes mais après quelques tours ça devient vite n'importe quoi.
Vous pouvez finir un cuirassé avec la pétoire de pont d'un cargo (bah oui c'est le lot de tous les jeux qui modélisent des points de vie, lequel d'entre nous n'a jamais fini un dragon émeraude à coup de fourche de paysan ?).
Le brouillard de guerre est un peu pipeau dans la mesure où le jeu nous montre le tour adverse.
La détection des sous-marin en plongée profonde par les avions de reco est un peu ""too much"" pour la période mais justifiée par l'équilibre du jeu (j'ai l'impression que les sous-marins posent toujours un problème en tour par tour, la furtivité associée à la puissance de tir conduisant direct à l'écueil du one-shot sorti de nulle part tout aussi irréaliste).

Un dernier mot sur l'aspect contextuel subjectif. J'ai repris ce jeu que son look peu engageant m'avait fait laisser de côté en sortant de Victory At Sea avec lequel je me suis ennuyé à mourir tellement il est répétitif, irréaliste et d'un néant tactique abyssal dès que l'on a un porte-avion. Tactiquement le contraste était tellement flagrant que je me suis plongé à fond dans Battle Fleet 2 en passant sur tous ses défauts (j'aurais tendance à penser qu'inversement si on aime Victory At Sea, on va vraiment avoir du mal avec Battle Fleet 2). J'aurais bien tenté Fleet Command mais je n'ai pas réussi à le faire tourner correctement sur ma config et, en  tour par tour qui se veut plus réaliste, Atalantic Fleet m'a donné une bonne première impression mais j'ai coincé sur l'équilibrage destroyer/sous-marin assez surprenant.

Edit: j'ai repris ce jeu après une longue pause et un patch à corrigé les effets pervers du décor destructible, on ne peut plus terraformer les îles à grands coups de torpille ou de 356 de marine. Logique et, en même temps, je suis un peu déçu : le froid réalisme a une fois de plus terrassé l'absurdité poétique ;)",1476265903,1576655364,True,4,2,0.584474921226501465,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you remember the old Panzer General series games or if you loved Naval tactical games. Then Battle Fleet 2 may be for you. Let's take one last look at what Battlefleet 2 did well and what they can do to improve if they continue the series.
PROS
Game play: Let's face it. You don't need much for great naval fun. It has a lot to offer for the price. Great Carriers, subs, destroyers, planes, all on an overhead risk type map. Solid sounds, effects, colors, layouts, all you need to get started.
Gimmick: At the time of creative applications. BF2 introduced fun Strategic Cards as bonuses that could turn the battle in your favor. In today's trade card collector game market, not a bad little gimmick that works.
Controls: Damage is handled great in this game and the compass targeting and some fun features make the confrontations fun instead of 2 vs 2 affairs you could wind up with massive battles.
Updates: This game was constantly updated and added to with VR and other mechanical changes that showed the passion behind the maker. Always a plus. 
Price: It is not a grand strategy naval game, but feels like one. Battleship in a store is more and gives you much less. 
CONS
Spacing: Maneuvering is an issue, so careful of collisions. The map always felt crowded and restrictive. 
Depth: The lack of scope can make it too simple for those who like massive campaigns. 
Coding: The AI gets obvious in the two campaign modes. It becomes more about out numbering the front line than actual strategy in the tactical map.
Firing: Figuring out Targeting from long distances can be tricky and falling behind the AI with hit/ misses can be a killer, but you will adjust. 

My Final Word: It's great seas battles at a low cost. The mechanics are simple to easy to pick up. This has become a very cult favorite among turn base lovers. It is what I call advanced battleship. A missed opportunity to be Pacific Storm or KoeI's PTO, having more additional Strategic abilities and more scope to it, however for the price. This is a fun game to have.  Please see the VIDEO above discussion to see if the game play if for you before buying. It will be interesting to see the next version of BF2, up against the likes of World of Warships, Cold Waters, and other more advanced presentations, but Mythical City proves that game play still rules no matter the graphical prowess of a developer. SIx years after still holds up, and good clean fun still works.

1. Could have many big fleets. Each map allows 24 ships in max.
2. Customized shipboard weapons.
3. Easy to learn, easy to play.
4. Control firing by ourself.
5. Real ship moves, included turning speed, turning curve, slowly backward and.....collide! (beware your ships collide would hurt your ships a lot)
6. Ship names are random, but historical.
7. Quick game play, move-fire in the battlefield; move fleets and save money for ships in strategy map.
8. AI cheats depend on diffculty, harder AI could peform ""call shot"" or ""100% hit"" and move first at battlefields. AI could put stronger ships against player's weak side.


Bad: 
1. Few ships models, all ships at same class have same looks.(Yamato and Nelson shared similar shapes)
2. Standardized weapons, all battleship guns are called ""heavy turret"" in game. For IJN, no Longlance(Type 93) torpedos.
3. Few types of ship, only 7 of them.  Bigger ships have their weapon slots fewer than historical.
4. No armor protection, fragile battleships. Light guns(for FF, DD, CV and Trans) does normal damage against bigger ships. Battleships heavy turrets could easily been destoryed. 
5. Small map for warfields and fewer maps for world, the game would finished quickly at lower diffculty. Each battlefield had contained so huge area that larger than a medium country, biggest map is Australia, that's counted as 1.
6. VERY WEAK carrier airstrike. VERY easliy defeat by ship AAs. That've made Pacific War looks so ridiculous. Kamikazes would never had a chance to got Allies ships in this game.
7. NO DEPLOYMENT at entering battlefield. That's HELPFUL for AI's cheat.


優點: 
1. 可以有很多艦隊,而且每張地圖最高可以編組24艘船的艦隊.(不過玩家很難存那麼多錢)
2. 自己安排新船艦上配備的武器.
3. 易學易玩,很適合戰略遊戲的新手.
4. 自己管理火控和機動
5. 真實化的船艦機動,包括轉彎速度,迴轉半徑,慢速後退.....還有小心碰撞,自己的船開場就撞到很傷的.
6. 艦名是隨機的,但史實上確有其船.
7. 節奏在回合制遊戲算明快,戰場上就是移動船艦和攻擊指示; 戰略地圖上是移動艦隊和存錢買船.
8. 電腦作弊看難度決定,高難度電腦作弊可以指定摧毀玩家的船上部件,100%砲擊命中率,加上絕對的先動權. 另外電腦可以決定開場船艦的部署,以便於直接抓掉玩家的弱邊.

缺點:
1. 船艦模型相當少,所有同等船艦都只有相同外觀.(大和級和尼爾森級看起來會相同嗎?)
2. 武裝極度標準化, 砲就只有輕中重三種. 魚雷也全部一致化(對,日本的93式魚雷被拔掉了)
3. 船艦類型不多,只有七種. 大船上的武器欄位比史實上要少很多.
4. 沒有裝甲.導致戰艦和巡洋艦變的脆弱不堪,(加上大船的HP被低估許多); 戰艦主砲塔很容易被擊毀,驅逐艦隊也可以用其主砲擊毀戰艦.
5. 戰場地圖太小,而世界地圖畫分的區域太少也太大; 最大的區域如澳洲加上其海域,幾乎跟整個美國一樣大. 在低難度時玩家可以很快結束一場戰役.
6. 航空母艦的機隊虛弱不堪,就算是落單的驅逐艦防空砲高射砲也可以以擊退. 如果防空砲真的那麼強,那麼太平洋戰爭怎麼不是砲戰比較多???
7. 玩家不能決定進入戰場時的船艦位置,而電腦可以.
8.高難度狀況下你可以看到各種鬼扯蛋的牛大便等級作弊.

Combat is turn-based, requiring manual control of ship movement and aiming/firing weapons. You need to estimate the firing range of enemy targets (except when firing torpedoes or launching Airstrikes).

There are 7 ship weapon types in the game (Depth Charges, Torpedo, Anti-Aircraft gun, Deck Gun, Standard Turret, Medium Turret, Heavy Turret).

Each weapon type has a certain firing arc, does a certain number of damage points (varies slightly in actual use during combat), has a certain maximum firing range, has a certain number of guns (if any), and has a certain number of times that it can fire each combat turn.

Some territories are defended with a certain number of Coastal Artillery and/or an Airfield that need to be destroyed before the territory can be conquered.

Each territory requires the attacking fleet to have a certain minimum number of transport ships (if any) in order to be able to conquer that territory.

Each turn, you earn Prestige Points equal to the value of all of the territories under your control.

You spend Prestige Points to build ships in any territory with a shipyard that is under your control.

There are 7 ship types in the game (Transport, Submarine, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier).

Each ship type has a certain number of certain weapon types that are mounted in certain fixed directions (either Fore, Port, Starboard, Mid (i.e. can fire to either port or starboard), or Aft).

Each ship type has a certain number of Hit Points, a certain maximum movement range per combat turn, a certain turning radius, and certain abilities (depth charges, sub detection, recon aircraft, squadron aircraft, territory capture).

Each ship type has a Bridge, an Engine, a Rudder, and Ammunition (the Carrier also has a Flight Deck) that each have their own individual Hit Points.

Squadron Aircraft from Carriers can perform 1 of 3 possible action types (either Defend, Recon, or Airstrike).


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

If you like very slow-paced, turn-based tactical movement and combat, and having to estimate firing ranges of targets, then you will enjoy this computer game.

Personally, I think that this computer game is okay but I can't recommend this computer game because it is too slow-paced for my liking, I don't like the way that aircraft function from aircraft carriers, and I really don't like having to manually estimate the firing range of targets.

I recommend that you buy, install, and play the naval combat computer game Victory At Sea instead which has a lot more ship types and, in my opinion, is a superior and more realistic naval combat computer game.",1463287170,1565270780,False,2,0,0.544143974781036377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What I really like is the ability to damage specific systems. For example, I've only played a few battles but one I was murderously outgunned by the Americans. However, my little ships fired specifically, and accurately, at the cruisers main guns taking them out and defanging it. It was very satisfying.

The campaigns are reminiscent of Axis and Allies and well, not sure what else to say. It's turn based, it has many ships and a rudementary economy.

Distance is calculated not with rulers or yard sticks, but with the imagination and a slight advantage of range circles. Battles are fought by turn and the actions played out in real time, and there is nothing more agonising than watching your painfully 'calculated' shots fall short or long. Thankfully, you can speed up gameplay so these moments are short-lived.
It took me a while to get around to playing this tremendous title for the simple omission of an in-battle save feature, as believe me the battles can and do go on. Ironically, since this has been addressed and there is indeed an in-battle save feature now, I tend to complete the battle...it's that ""Just one more turn"" phenomenon known so well to turn-based gamers.
So, you have the Campaign Map, where you plan your advances, reinforcements, build cues and assaults. Then when battle is joined, you go to the top-down tactical map. One immersion-breaker is the use of ""Strategic Command Cards to surprise your enemies with special actions like deploying mines, sabotage, enhanced aiming, airstrikes and more!"", as while these are fun to use, the enemy AI always without fail makes a beeline for them instead of their objective. In fact it becomes a race to pick up cards. That aside, you attack, defend and send airstrikes against the enemy, and there is nothing more satisfying than pulling a hopeless situation from the jaws of defeat into a tactical withdrawal by the enemy with only a shore gun and a lone destroyer sinking an enemy battleship, starting a panic in the AI. Transports I still don't understand. They are obviously important for holding acquired territory, but just clutter the battle map and waste time getting them the Hell out of Dodge. Perhaps they could have been left from the battle, and their loss rate simulated instead based on victory/defeat conditions (as done in ""Victory At Sea"").
While not as attractive nor immediate as ""Atlantic Fleet"", this is a far more engrossing and long lasting game for naval enthusiasts. If you re even mildly interested in W II naval conflict, and would like to test your skills from Admiral down to gunner...pick this up.

It runs perfectly on a ""office"" toaster - meaning the absolute non-gaming rig. It is turn based so one can leave it running and do turns whenever there's a hole in the schedule, during lunch break, coffee timeouts etc.

It is a mirrored setup wargame with no asymmetry, meaning all nations have access to the same ships with the same capabilities. This leads to a very ""alternative"" version of nations but it is by no means a deterrent. Quite funny to see Nazi Germany with a fleet of carriers...

I like the ""scorched earth"" mechanics although it has ample space for further development - IMO the torpedoes should not be fire and forget but rather arm them for a distance.

Fun 
Decent Enough Graphics and Sound
Some Good History 
Engaging, but not demanding

Minor things that I didn't liked:

1. The movement of the ship is controled by a heading+distance, but the trajectory is not shown before advancing. Conclusion: I ended up sinking my own ship by sending it to the shore.

This one was a pair of 6's.

This is a fun, top-down tactical wargame. While there is no tutorial, one really isn't needed since the controls are intuitive. Movement is done in turns, with one ""move"" and one ""attack"" command available per turn. Fog of war is present, so some ""attack"" moves have to be used for the purposes of recon.

Attacking is done by way of aiming various weapons (guns of several different sizes, torpedos, depth charges, etc) and then setting their range. Near-misses do small amounts of damage, just as they would in reality. It can be nerve-wracking to watch your opponent shoot at you multiple times during a turn, each round coming closer and closer and closer...

There are standalone battles, custom battles that you can create on your own, campaigns, and a multiplayer system. I have not tried the latter yet, but the single-player portion has been quite addictive, and is definitely recommendable.

Its not bad, but there is still a fair bit left to be desired so I could only recomend this as a on the cheap game.

The parts that I like most is the gameplay mechanics. Having to use your brain and calculate distances by dead-reckoning brings a good level of strategy into the game. I also like how all new ships are customizeable, at least to a point. Plus having various parts of a ship destructable adds a good touch.

The main point that I did not care for as much was the point system to fund new construction. I found it to be too limited and too difficult to save up points for high-teir ships. Additionally, I felt that the speed of the ships were lacking, and it made it tedious to get fleets into a good matchup. To follow up with this complaint I did not like how the game auto-deploys the fleet, usually spreading your ships all over the map without much rhyme or reason (at least to my mind).

This is not by any means a high-paced action game, this is a sit-down thinker and for some people this game should be a good match. For everyone else, it is probably something to walk away from.

Получатся, что в начале каждого хода необходимо пристреливаться - а на точный огонь стреляющих башен может уже и не хватить.

Battle Fleet 2 es la secuela de un titulo que nunca salió de las plataformas de Apple, Battle Fleet nos permitía comandar intensas batallas marítimas por turnos. Debido al éxito que cosechó la primera entrega en la App Store el equipo responsable de Battle Fleet decidió lanzar una segunda entrega, esta vez a través de diferentes plataformas, por lo que podemos conseguirlo a través de la App Store, Google Play o Steam.

El sistema jugable en Battle Fleet 2 es simple, tu flota constará de diferentes clases de naves y submarinos, cada uno con armamento y alcance diferentes y habilidades que te ayudarán en combate.

Para mover a tu flota y atacar consta de una interfaz simple, que permite apuntar con precisión en base a distancia y potencia. Al igual que hemos visto en juegos como Worms, el sistema de combate se basa en su mayoría en una serie continua de “intento y error” por lo que generalmente no atinarás al primer intento.

Cada tiro que aciertas correctamente sobre un enemigo tendrá la posibilidad de dañar o inhabilitar permanentemente alguna de sus funciones, ya sea terminar con su armamento principal o dañar sus motores y controles para restarles maniobrabilidad y evitar que huya.

En Battle Fleet 2 ten encontrarás con gran variedad de naves bajo tu control, todas con diferentes características y tamaños, que van desde una pequeña y veloz fragata a un potente crucero de combate e incluso portaaviones que facilitan la batalla, cada una tiene su propio alcance y potencia por lo que seguramente terminarás utilizando las que más se ajusten a tu forma de jugar.

[h1]Pros:[/h1] [list]
[*]Una excelente toma en el género de estrategia.
[*]A pesar de la carencia de contenido, el juego otorga una inmensa re-jugabilidad debido a lo intensas que llegan a ser algunas batallas..
[*]Un Inteligencia Artificial dura y bien trabajada.
[*]Casi tan adictivo como la cocaína pero mucho más barato. (Las drogas son malas.) [/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1] [list]
[*]Carece de contenido y campañas que lo hagan aún más re-jugable.
[*]El sistema de movimiento necesita trabajo para evitar colisiones. [/list]

[h1]Conclusión:[/h1]
Battle Fleet 2 es un juego impresionante, es en extremo divertido y adictivo, llega a hacerte pensar en muchas ocasiones y es perfecto para ocupar una tarde entera. Si eres fan de la estrategia y buscas entretenimiento para una tarde (o varias) no dudes en comprar Battle Fleet 2, es perfecto desde donde lo mires, ya sea que lo juegues en móvil o PC.

Battle Fleet 2 is a rather serious recreation of naval fleet battle set in a turn based settings where you have manually control every ships as distance and shot power data had to be taken from the test firing itself. Enjoyable for the armchair armada commander.

[b] Game Detail [/b]
Name: Battle Fleet 2
Genre: Literally Chess, Naval Command, Turn Base Strategy
Personal: Rather unpromising in the beginning but catches your attention relatively easily.
Has multiplayer.

[h1] What is Battle Fleet 2? [/h1]
I went into the game without any prior knowledge as to what its predecessor is and so without any expectation set. With that said i hated the game in during my early times with it marred by weird UI, incredibly cheating AI and various other factors that could have been avoided by taking the tutorial. Which i ignored. Then again after hurdling through without any idea the base game is good fun if rather lacking in content at the moment.

To simplify manner Battlefleet 2 is a either a fleet turn base simulator or an armada turn based simulator depending on which mode you happened to click at the menu. Lets go in depth shall we?

[b] 1:Gameplay [/b]
Like any good pair of old comfortable sock Battle Fleet 2 proceed to destroy you in its brutal, harsh and unrelenting gameplay during the early hours you struggle to find your wet feets in the game. The 2 main mode are the skirmish mode and the campaign mode with the skirmish mode further divided into custom matches and quick battle which is my favourite of the lot. Custom matches allows you to choose what type of ships you and your nameless fleet commander bring into the foray. While it is fun to simulate certain historical battle witht the abundance maps shipped within the game the real highlights are of course the battle itself. 

Gameplay starts you and your foes ships are dump into the oceon in a random formation with in the case of quick battle you wont know what kind of ship you ended up with until the battle starts. Everything is played in top down view seeing as you have to make all the range estimates yourself. Incidentally you can somewhat influence it by choosing the ship budget during the map selection menu but thats not very fun. Just choose the full budget and let it rip.

Every ships turn to act are determined by their onboard commander with battleships of course going first but resulting in them acting last in every other turn. There is fog of war so recon the area searching for the enemy till you obtain visual is a must in which case you move on to the firing phase. Setting the gun on every part of your ship manually you have to guess based on the range indicator given what angle and power you need to set them to and if a hit occur the enemy status will be displayed with either only a damage occur or a module is taken out with it that could range from being deadly exploding munitions bringing you whole ship down to a mere incovenience with damaged munition that prevent that gun from being use next turn. There's are also engine damage and so on and specific part of the ship can be targeted albeit a bit unreliable at times with shots going all over the place the farther they are. Past their maximum range the shells and torpedo simply stop working.

Not contend with only a battleship the game also comes with several other type with each suited to a different role. Battleships are the behemoth or 'tanks' of the ocean dealing death with their broadside bombardment, the historically accurate destroyer with their torpedo launchers and sub killing depth charges and the aircraft carrier with their deadly plane delivering bombs which are the only thing battleships fear. A few other unmentions are the submarine, cruiser and frigate. Admittedly the heart of the fleet will always be the aircraft carrier and battleships and during the story mode where it is possible for both to be present in a single battle it is often a struggle to eliminate them.

Speaking of campaign mode this game has one! Even though  the skirmish mode would have easily suffice but the addition doesnt hurt it in the slightthest. Essentially you play the pacific campaign with it being US vs IJN in a grand battle risk style to take out the whole board and claim victory in a historically innacurate way. You can either choose to play the premade 'inspired by the historical fleet formation of that time or you can say darn it all and build howerver many battleships your funds or prestige point will allow you and finally kick those dirty yanks with 20 yamato on the tile based map. Campaign mode introduces extra elements such airfield that will bombard your fleet and coastal artillery which surprise surprise will bombard your ships. The reverse is true if your enemy decides to attack the tile containing these modifier and these fortification can be destroyed to stop their harassment during the battle.

Did i mention you could also customize your ships armament? While historically destroyer are the sub hunter of the fleet you can always remove everything to add more cannons to blast those yanks off the water or you can install more AA gun to help your poor pitiful 12 gun battleship from the harassment of the aircraft carriers. At the end of the day nothing beats a broadside to a crippled ship while listening a particularly melodramatic violin composition.

Of note is the difficulty and what it affects. While the AI do regain part of their lobotomized brain the higher you go the interesting thing is the distance marker starts to be less useful and at the highest difficulity simply dissapear requiring all the calculation to be made with the gut instinct. Or you know, fire a shot and go from there, like a true armada general.

[b] 2:Sound [/b]
Nothing to really praise here, the sound department did a good job of making the ambient sound easily tuned out as you do all those calculation in your head and second guessing every mouse click confirmation. Seriously i'll give it a 8/20 for ambiency.

[b] 3:Graphics [/b]
As with most turn based strategy games the graphics are not that high on the checklist [with exception such as xcom come to mind as you basically staring at your soldier throughout the game so they better be good] but Battle Fleet 2 surprise this reviewer with rather well made water physics and ships models [the landmass is ugly but this is a ship game not land battle].

Choosing the highest setting showcase high level of details on the ships and the water being more believable although performance does take a hit with mid being the best of both world. With even the barrel of the ship being distinguisable instead of lump of clays slapped together in some shady backroom it fulfilled its requirement well enough.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
You have well detailed ships set in WWII for heaven sake blasting each other with volleys of shells and sinking magnificently so what did you think the score would be? 

8.5/10

Could use a bit more content although there are online skirmishes if you got bored bombarding the AI with shells. Just dont get too cocky.

Verdict? : Buy it if you ever felt like being a narcissist armchair fleet commander who wants to control what their ships does. And losing that expensive Yamato, priceless.

I've only had this two days now and have played as many games, one on Easy mode and another on normal.  Both levels were just the right agressive level for the AI, though the AI doesn't make very good decisions; I hope that there are fewer stupid choices made by the AI in hard mode (such as moving all 6 of it's fleet vessels out of it's home port worth 25 points to capture a space worth only 5 points when I have a fleet of ships sitting just outside his home port).

From a new player's point of view, the initial game was a bit confusing.  Commands weren't quite clear and I didn't know how to work the interface.  It took me a few turns to figure out how to attack with a carrier, the listed commands while limited, don't give the right vibe as to the correct couse of action, at least not initially for me.  First bit of advice, make your first game on easy mode just to get used to the controls.

That said, LOVE the graphics & details, sound effects and music are awesome.  I even had the graphics up on max spanning three screens and it looked amazing.  Once you figure out the controls, the game is quite simple and easy to play, it boils down to strategy and good range guessing.

There were a few features of the game I didn't care for and would like to see a future update for.
1)  The aiming line from your ship is lost over land targets, it would be very helpful if it didn't stay limited to water level.
2)  Each map has a few strategy cards hidden on it, and for the most part they are placed in the travel lanes of the AI ships (so they can pickup while en-route to me), any of these cards near my ships require that I turn completely around or go quite out of the way to obtain.  This game features heavily favors the AI, and just gives me a negative feeling about that particular game feature being fair to both parties.
3) It would be nice if the game allowed a joint attack option, if I have a fleet on opposite sides of a section I want to take over, it would be great if both could attack the sector together and meet up in the middle as opposed to only being able to move/attack with one fleet at a time.  Still, not a deal breaker but I have a feeling I'm going to wish I had this ability in hard mode.
4) I'm concerned about the replayability of the game, my early impression is that I'll get bored with this over time due to a lack of variations of play, but the multi-player aspect will help with some of that.

Overall, it's a very good game, appropriately priced, and so far pretty garsh darn fun to play.

*Addendum*
Finished hard mode, sadly the game is still spitting out only frigates.  Once you knock out the the initial nasty fleet, it's easy peasy so hopefully we'll see an updated with an improved AI purchaser.  AI continues to be horrible, higher skill levels just translates to fewer misses by the computer, not smarter game play.

I also tried out the multi-player and nobody is ever showing up.  I hope this is a bug and not a sign that nobody else is playing or interested in this.  I also hope they come out with an email turn  based PVP campaign mode, taking it back old school but this game could really benefit from that and add some longevity to game interest.

I've found that my old ratio's class I had waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 5th grade has really helped with range estimation.  If you're pretty good with math or geometry, you'll be hard pressed to miss a shot in this game.",1423893104,1424034717,True,0,0,0,5,True,False,False,False,,,

A game that doesn't look like much, but sure knows how to create a fun gaming experience.
Within the game you've got several game modes: campaign, skirmish, multiplayer hotseat and multiplayer online (Devided in regions: EU, US, Asia, Japan)

The core principal of the game is to battle it out with your custom selected fleet while hoping to survive another day. First, you think like: Ah, I gonno do this. Piece of cake. Then, a couple of minutes later you think: ""Woow, wait! What happened to my cool looking destroyer?""

Battle Fleet 2 is like a cat & mouse game with the different types of naval vessel as cat or mouse. They all come with distinctive features. (torpedo, depth charge, deck cannon, etc.) You're even allowed to have planes in your arsenal.

During the fighting you've got to plan ahead. Not that much, but a little. And using your weapons needs you to set the angle and power/Elevation of your charge/torpedo/shell.
The fun part is when you're actually able to kick the nuts and bolts out of an enemy vessel with a perfect shot.

Also, while you're playing with your cool toys you get a chance to pick up/collect so called command cards (They float as little boxes in the water) Those cards are a lot like the cards in the game ""Ruse"". They give you a nice bonus effect upon use. (Deploy mines, sabotage enemy ship, etc.)

With all of that and for such a bargain price there's got to be a bad side, right?
Well, yea, I guess.. The A.I. isn't of the best, but good enough to keep you playing. Just don't expect any Rommel or Eisenhower actions.",1421802697,1478547849,True,3,1,0.538461565971374512,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For those unfamiliar with this type of game, players take in turns shooting at each other by setting the angle and power for each shot, seeing where that shot lands and then adjusting their next shots until they hit and destroy their opponent's ship. Battle Fleet 2 has detailed shot and damage modeling, including the altitude of the shells are modeled during their firing arc.  The graphic are crisp and clean, interface is simple to learn and pick up, the sound effects and the damage modelling bring the fights to life.

There’s not much to fault this game on, except no save during tactical battles and the campaign mode lacks depth, also one can argue it is entirely too easy to use smaller caliber gun to get bearing and distance, then obliterate the opponent with bigger guns.

Why?

Campaign is excellent, battles are fun, if slow, and its a great concept for a game - news of an atlantic campaign is very exciting, would love to see some Royal Navy and German ships in there. But it has a critical problem in campaign mode - once you destroy the enemys capital ships they dont produce any more. They spread their ships around instead of concentrating them, so you build up a couple of strong fleets and then wipe out all their ships. They replace them with only frigates, the odd destroyer, very occasionally a cruiser, and sometimes a submarine. I havent seen them build a single battleship or carrier. So i switched to ""hard"" mode. Nothing changed except accuracy of enemy ships and gauges for my own fire.

This game would be brilliant with the following simple changes: 

- in campaign mode, ensure the enemy builds all types of ships(!!!) - people want to fight battleships and strong fleets, not lowly bands of frigates. 
- concentrate the enemys fleets, dont have them spread out with one or two ships to a region to be picked off.
- have a speed button enabling enemy fire to be sped up. It can be very dull watching 10 individual shells at normal speed.
- have an atlantic campaign with RN and German ships!

Both are turn-based.

The naval battles are fun if you enjoy turn-based fights based largely upon positioning your ships and estimating distances. Though unfortunately, you don't choose the starting formation of your fleet. It is definitely satisfying to see the shell hit from over a mile away, you can really feel the distance between the ships, and then see it crash into the ship and possibly disable some critical component such as one of their guns, or engine. The armament of your ships will also play a role in how things go. For example, the submarine can be shielded from most damage by being submerged, but can only hit the enemy from 1500 yards while the largest guns have a range of 4000 yards. It pays to have a versatile fleet. The enemy may have a tightly formed fleet with many AA guns, making your carriers less effective, or battleships with big guns but few/no torpedos, making your subs more effective. The battleship can otherwise outshoot anything, but can fall prey to repeated airstrikes from an aircraft carrier that is too far away to shoot. Ramming is possible and could be fun, but I've only accidently rammed my own ships. Try not to do that. When your ships can destroy the enemy from miles away, you tend not to end up getting so close.  The AI on hard provides enough of a challenge to be interesting.

The overall battle map is fun, but the AI doesn't play it well. Oddly, America is the more challenging side to play. New ships can be built, but only about one per turn (or every other turn, if you want a battleship/carrier) while each side starts with over 20 ships. New ships can be customized in terms of their armament to some degree, to make the ship better against regular ships, aircraft, or subs. You can make the right side of your battleship able to fire torpedos at subs, with the left side specialized for regular ships, with all standard turrets to complement the heavier turrets on the front and back. Or replace regular guns with a few AA guns to help fend off airstrikes. There's always tradeoffs, and you want to consider what your enemy has and what supporting ships you already possess.

You earn points to build new ships by controlling sea zones, and some are worth 2-6 times more than others. These valuable zones tends to have coastal defenses and ports where ships are repaired. You do control the defenses and they can make a significant difference in battle to favor the defender.  You can send a lone sub or frigate to capture undefended sea zones while your main force blocks the progress of the enemy fleet until they bring the fight to you. You win by occupying all sea zones in the pacific.",1418302696,1418303135,True,32,2,0.745642721652984619,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a promising idea for a game but it'd be great to see a bit more depth.  There's a limited amount of armament so each ship feels generic.  A few things like giving the Japanese Long Lance torpedoes with extended range, or maybe a Radar upgrade for the Americans (which would add more range circles) would make the ships feel more unique.

Je mettrai à jour cet avis lorsque j'aurai bien avancé dans la campagne.

L'avantage d'un jeu comme Battle Fleet 2, c'est qu'on comprend immédiatement les mécanismes. Donc pas besoin d'y jouer longtemps pour savoir si on aime ou non. Pour le coup le game design est très efficace. A peine besoin d'un tutoriel pour comprendre ce qu'il est possible de faire. L'interface - prévue pour iPad - y est pour beaucoup puisqu'il y a peu de boutons et qu'ils nous sautent aux yeux.

Bref un seul théâtre d'opérations, le Pacifique. Mais une campagne dynamique qui peut être très différente d'une partie à l'autre. L'IA est aggressive dans le bon sens du terme et vous fait payer vos erreurs les plus grossières. Le jeu se présente sous la forme d'une grande partie d'échecs sur le plus grand océan du monde. On bouge des flottes, on en construit, on essaie de combiner les différents types de navires et de conquérir les ""cases"" qui rapportent le plus de prestige. Simple à comprendre mais pas si facile à mettre en oeuvre :)

Dès que les deux nations se rencontrent sur une case, un combat tactique démarre. La bonne nouvelle c'est qu'il n'y a pas que des navires mais également de temps en temps des aérodromes et de l'artillerie côtière. Cette partie est un peu plus bancale. Le système au tour par tour fonctionne bien, et c'est agréable d'utiliser chaque arme manuellement. En revanche l'absence de zone de déploiement, la présence de cartes bonus dans des caisses et la gestion plus ou moins mystérieuse du brouillard de guerre, tend à montrer qu'il y a des possibilités d'amélioration.

Reste que le jeu est très immersif, globalement maîtrisé et proposé à petit prix. Difficile de résister !

[h1]NOTE:[/h1] I clocked around 5-6 hours in this game but mostly while Steam was OFFLINE. Steam does not count game-time in Offline Mode.

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Battle Fleet 2 is a top-down turn based strategy game by Capital j Media. It was made for both the mobile platform and the PC which was released simultaneously. The game features multiple ship classes, each having their own unique weapon systems and abilities with a tactical and strategic map you can play on.

The player can either be an Admiral for the United States Pacific Fleet or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. The game has an open world map including most major areas during the war like: Japan, Philippines, Australia, Wake Islands, Hawaii and many more. Lead your fleet into victory through careful planning, precision attacks, Navy composition and proper positioning.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Acceptable graphics with very detailed ship designs. (although the water graphics is nice, the land texture could use a little more work.)
+ Good core gameplay
+ Ship variety with different abilities
+ Historically accurate names and details of the ships
+ Simple game with an adequately complex game mechanic (range finders, bearings etc.)
+ AI (Also a Con): Tactical Map AI is competent on Hard mode
+ Hotseat Multiplayer (two or more players taking turn using one computer)
+ No Microtransactions (specially since it has a mobile counterpart)
+ Customizable hard points when building new ships

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- Short Campaign (could have used more maps to extend gameplay)
- No tutorial
- Land texture is horrible
- No ship upgrades during campaign (I've been told Captains level up though)
- AI (Also a Pro): Strategic Map AI is brain dead and leaves important territory poorly defended 

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
Its a NICE GAME, good for passing the time and a good way to satisfy an urge for a 'not-so-deep but also not dumb strategic game. For a mobile-pc multiplatform game, Battle Fleet 2 is COMPETENT. It plays nicely, has decent visuals, easy to understand game mechanic and it can run with almost all modern computers.

I would RECOMMEND this at full price ($10 USD or your regional equivalent) if you're really into this kind of game, but if not, WAIT for a SALE.

Pull off all the standard turrets and build one!

The tactical gameplay is somewhat ""arcade-y,"" but still quite fun.

Set during the pacific war you can play either the Americans or Japanese. Has a single player campaign, multiplayer and quick player modes. The game is set around a group of pacific islands. There are two stages to the game. The first is set on a large campagin map where you can move / engage fleets or build / repair ships. The second takes place after you engage an enemy fleet. These battles are not over quickly as the larger ships move slowly and the range of guns / torpedos varies. At your disposal are submarines, frigates, cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.

The graphics are not bad and has detailed ships. Controls are very simple and the use of a range guide helps give you an idea of how far you should fire the guns. One nice touch is that if you miss, the detonation points are recorded so you can see how far you missed before planning the next attack.

The damage model is realistic with different ship parts capable of being destroyed or disabled. Your individual ships will earn prestige as they survive each battle so it pays to keep them alive. In my first battle I was heavily outnumbered by both land, sea and air. Although I won pretty much all my ships were damaged. Back on the campaign map you have to move damaged ships back to the nearest friendly port in order to repair them. Thats where the game can become tense, especially if your fleet is a few moves away from the port and the enemy starts pursuing you. Just like it was in the real pacific war things become a game of cat and mouse.

This game will give any naval strategist hours of gameplay. I only really have a couple of moans and one is that despite seeing a nice close up of the ships in the stats mode you can't actually zoom right in during a battle. The other is that I would have liked to have seen some historical scenarios as the pacific had many well known battles.

I've been looking for a naval strategy game, so I took a flyer on this.

As I understand it, this is a game designed for mobile phones and has now been ported to PC. It's turn-based and pretty basic, easy to learn, and fun to play. My first time playing, I spent five hours without even realizing; that's about the price of a movie ticket, so it's already worth it to me.

My biggest complaint is getting saddled with random ships at the start of the campaign with no way to modify or mothball them. The only way to delete them is to get them destroyed, and that gives your enemy build points (and experience?). There's no way to 'refit' the ships with different hardpoint options (some destroyers and cruisers don't take advantage of being able to mount medium guns - 1 and 3 respectively, and sometimes even battleships don't have heavy guns mounted - one of the biggest reasons to have a battleship at sea as they outrange everything, sans aircraft, and are invaluable in taking heavily defended ports). When you play a one-shot skirmish you can build your whole fleet out of points (higher point battles, please!) and designing your fleet is easily half the fun.

As I understand it, this is a growing and still developing game, so I hope these things improve. One way to help that happen is give the game your money. Less than $10? Totally worth it.",1416604795,1416604795,True,28,0,0.716534018516540527,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Incredibly fun and addicting game.  I am a huge fan of the ""Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures"" and ""Star Trek: Attack Wing"" games and I'm pleased to report that ""Battle Fleet 2"" has a similar vibe in terms of play style...that is, each ship has a turn order based on captain skill and prestige points can be spent to add ships to your fleet.  I would have liked to have been able to specify the prestige point value for the custom skirmish mode, but there are a number of preset point values to choose from.  All in all, an easy recommend.

Like Scorched Earth, its not a deep game. But that is okay. There is still something satisfying about landing a salvo from your battleship on the the enemy carrier by just eyeballing it.  

I had a problem playing this game, likely due to poor support for AMD graphics cards.  
The dev contacted me immediately after I posted my problem and worked to help solve it.  Currently I am using a work around,  but I am confident that it will be fixed.",1416542796,1416894799,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,
