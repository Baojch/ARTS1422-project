They make it look like this game is a frantic power fantasy with non-stop explosions. Like 2D DOOM or Just Cause with tanks. It is not.

It is actually one of the most tense and deep real-time stealthy tactical games I've ever played. Around the middle of the campaign I was strapped in a tiny mech hiding between buildings, trying to distract and lure out an overwhelming force to pick them off one by one. Each shot was a careful tradeoff, revealing my position but pulling more enemies away from the real target of the mission.

Brigador does destruction in a totally unique way. 100% of the map can be leveled at any time if you try hard enough, but every structure is a tactical decision. You can tear down the wall standing between you and your target to skip a whole line of defenses, but when it's time to get out that crucial piece of cover will be gone. Low barriers let hovercrafts pass while blocking ground units. A carefully punched hole can be an escape route under cover of smoke to get behind your enemies. It can also be the mistake that gets you surrounded. Tearing things down is noisy and attracts attention. The complexity of the gameplay-impacting interactions between weapons, structures, terrain, sound, light and enemy AI must have taken ages to get right. 

it's amazing that a game with this many weapons manages to make them all feel unique. The only thing they have in common is that they're all completely overpowered - when used in a very specific situation. The chaingun is the closest I've seen a game get to what footage of an A-10 warthog feels like: It vaporizes anything on the receiving in an overwhelming blaze of light and sound, and within half a second you're out of ammunition and every enemy on the map knows where you are. The irradiator silently kills enemies through walls without making a sound - at short range, and only if they haven't been alerted enough to put their shields up first. Ammunition is scarce no matter what weapon you choose.

Brigador's creator described it as a ""Kool-Aid man simulator"", and at the very best that's what the game is. The Kool-Aid man bursts through walls like they're paper, but he's still made of glass. And he's also been accused of war crimes.",1712210389,1712210389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Starting with the gameplay, there is a large variety of different mechs, weapons, and pilots that can be used each feels slightly different from the other and not unique enough to be its own thing. The controls are also bad, I played around with the various control schemes they have and none of them felt good the main issue is that despite being top-down of sorts it’s also 3d meaning it is very easy to miss shots seems lined up because you’re shooting too high or low, it doesn’t feel good trying to line it up and even when it is it doesn’t feel satisfying. The main loop of the gameplay is quite boring, there is a lot of walking around and stomping on barriers which is both slow and unsatisfying, each level is very similar to the others mainly being just a large square. There isn’t too much combat and when it’s there it isn’t enjoyable.

There is a campaign and a freelance mode, the campaign leaves much to be desired as it is a more limited version of the freelance. In the campaign you get a set loadout or a few and are in a square room, there are some interesting stories about the militarized nature of the society and the lack of care for civilians but generally speaking, it is very barebones, you can unlock lore for in-game currency which adds to it a bit but it isn’t enough to keep me engaged or more interested. The freelance mode allows you to make your loadouts which is much better, these missions are very repetitive though all have the same goals with extremely little variety.  

Visually it looks good, the style is distinct, and stands out well creating some life into the world. The areas are done to be believable and feel lived in. The mech designs are well done and distinct, you won’t confuse them or their capabilities. The soundtrack is similarly well done with a fast pace to it to match what should be fast-paced gameplay. 

Much of this game doesn’t work on any level and I struggled to play through much of it before deciding to give up.

While it looks like a twin stick shooter, it really doesn't play like one. Especially on some missions where you are limited to certain mech types, you really need to play tactically, use all your abilities, use the environment for cover, etc. Missions are usually quite short.

In each campaign mission you have a choice of 3-4 vehicles, each with different weapons, health and armor values, and play-styles. Some of these are hilariously, joyously overpowered, and some are not. Exploring all these vehicles and weapons is part of the game, and it's always fun to come across a mission that lets you use the gigantic pile of junked cars, for example, which lobs corrosive goo at enemies from far away and knocks out any survivors with a CIWS gun.

As far as the context for what's happening, that is all doled out in mission descriptions. When in a mission, you have your objectives and that's that. The overall lore explaining what you're doing in each mission is amusing in a mean-spirited kind of way. Solo Nobre is described as having undergone a socialist revolution to cast out the rule of corporate exploiters and mobsters (so, Cuba), and the player is employed by the ""Solo Nobre Concern,"" which represents that aggrieved capital interest (so, a CIA cutout) and is tasked with ""liberating"" Solo Nobre by destroying military and civilian infrastructure across the whole city/country/planet. You gain money per each civilian killed, because these civilians are ""Loyalists"" - as in, loyal to the regime that replaced the corporate interest that now employs you. This does color the level of challenge posed by each mission. The mission is not to accomplish your objectives and NOT kill the civilian population; you won't be penalized if you need to blow up an apartment block in order to create a flanking route.

Плюсы:
- Красивая, сочная и красочная графика. Всё красиво взрывается и разлетается на куски.
- Хорошая отрисовка уровней в изометрии.
- Хорошее музыкальное сопровождение и звуки в игре.

Минусы:
- Разработчики сделали прицел так, что его еле видно. Это вообще ужас, в сильной заворушке его будет вообще не видно и ты мало будешь попадать по врагам. А там надо чаще целиться именно во врагов, иначе всё будет пролетать над ними.
Не могли что ли сделать прицел более заметнее и больше?

I've been playing Brigador since 2020 when a certain Youtuber made a video on this absolute gem & have been playing it ever since. Originally got it in GOG before recently buying it again on steam to help support the devs.

Brigador is a very special game to me. Everything from the gameplay, music, art style & setting just click. A deceivingly simple game with a ton of strategy & tactics where one bad decision can easily snowball & end your run. The game looks like it would be a simple arcadey twin stick shooter but its not, with the game requiring you to take very careful consideration of your environment, how to traverse it, and even the way your vehicle is positioned (the game features a directional damage system). Flanking is king and unless your driving a project mega death type vehicle, you should never engage most enemies head on. Especially large groups or swarms of enemies without some sort of cover or way to retreat from the situation.

The soundtrack is also simply a masterpiece. ""Makeup and Vanity Set"" created an incredible Synthwave soundtrack that can range from being either ""Badass & Bombastic"" to ""Haunting & Atmospheric"". Every track fits the games mood flawlessly whether your taking on a NEP garrison with a Touro, sneaking about in a MOG suit, or mopping up the remnants of your latest space genocide.

Art style lore wise Brigador also strikes a massive cord with me as I'm an absolute goober who's obsessed with retro future settings, the late Cold War era, and anything Military related. The vehicle designs are all fricking peak, the lore is way better than it has any right to be, and the city of Solo Nobre is crammed with so much love, attention to detail, and character that its almost a shame that its our job to destroy the damn place.

I won't say Brigador is the ""best game ever made"", but its personally one of my all time favorite video games. If you haven't played it yet & like vehicle combat games then do yourself a favor & pick this one up. 
Also the sequel ""Brigador Killers"", is still in active development so give the devs your money so we can finally play it!!!",1706008815,1706008815,True,9,0,0.599508464336395264,0,True,False,False,True,,,

However, this game's lore broke me as a writer. I dipped my toes in the water with the excellent audio-book, read a lot of the in game lore, really intriguing stuff, excellent concept for a cyberpunk setting which really uplifts the game itself.
One of my favorite bits of lore is just the yellow raincoats. Really effective world building.
I ended up trying to dig deeper, which is when I found fucking MT Foxtrot from Cruelty Squad (an excellent game), very funny stuff. Then the blue skeleton, then fucking Johnny Five Aces, then the in universe TV series, and I found I couldn't make myself care more about the characters than the authors do, which turned out to be fairly little. Any character that seems interesting is just a difficulty tweak.

There is some strategy to taking out objectives or larger tanks and enemy mechs, but it is mostly a game of ""shoot everything until it blows up."" You can try to kill the alarm-sounding enemies, or destroy the power grid to make things more stealthy, if that's your play style. But I can't emphasize enough that this isn't a ""precision shooter"" so much as it is a ""destroy the entire world"" shooter.

The weapon and vehicle variety is vast. There are some hilarious weapon and vehicle combos to unlock and play around with. One of my favorites is a corrosive gas canister launcher paired with a high ROF ballistic gun.

Stellar Jockeys did an awesome job building the world for such a simple concept. It feels right at home for someone who enjoyed the satirical, dystopian sci-fi films of Paul Verhoeven. Easily worth the asking price for the atmosphere and music, alone. It can be played with mouse and keyboard or with a controller, but I find that the aiming mechanics pretty much require a mouse and keyboard to be precise and effective, as you aim in an ""arc"" or sorts and have to mind your elevation when attacking the various enemy types (flying, ground, and medium/tall enemies).

My only real compliant about the software is that the game can't run native 4K and makes it annoying when I have to tab out to check something in Windows.

I think that this game would definitely be a bit more fun with co-op, some fast Japanese-style mech designs with melee capabilities, and some more in-depth mission mechanics. Either way, I'm looking forward to the sequel. Pick it up if you liked the older 16-bit generation isometric destruction shooters and are an enjoyer of synthesizer-based musics from a more civilized age.",1703307268,1703307268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Most people will probably bounce off of this game at first(I did, probably cause of the tank controls.) It's a true jack of all trades and master of none.

Mission restarts are common and unpredictable - a single alarm from an off-screen flanking patrol often ends a 30 minute run.

Aggression still works through waiting for special ability cooldowns, and causing some missions to devolve into a mess of action-wait-action-wait. One misjudged use of the cooldown and it's another dozen enemies swarming your vehicle and another restart. So you're back to pulling and kiting - it's gruelling and unpredictable.

    总的来说是一个非常好玩的战犯（字面意思）游戏，战火肆虐的星际赛博朋克世界观在幽默的文笔加持下跃然屏上，挺有叙事潜力的。游玩方面它有自成体系的完善系统和高度开放（甚至像broforce一样允许地道战）的关卡设计，各种机体配装差异性极大，总之就是...极其舒适，玩家觉得能用的战术大概真能用，总能找到好玩的打法，有一种沉浸模拟系的感觉

    至于缺点...最大的应该就是瞄准，这俯视角游戏其实是有Z轴的，会影响瞄准、隐蔽、移动等重要要素，俯视角就是对Z轴不敏感，所以玩时经常会因此出一些岔子，再加上游戏里的枪大多都不是hitscan而且弹道还会被机甲的动量明显影响，高个子或高机动性的机体的瞄准体验真的很尴尬。
    作为俯视角游戏本作是有弹道线的，这是避免了很多*对自己的掩体输出*的大好事，但着弹点却没那么明显，如果开发者能看到我的话希望能改进这点

还有就是任务的形式很单一，虽然有着优秀系统和地图的加持也不至于打完第一关后“散了吧后面都是这个”。主要是自由契约模式根本不是什么肉鸽，因为没有必须的构筑角色玩法，机体装备都是在开局时选的，其实就是个地图随机生成而已，加上也没有故事可看，这个模式很容易腻

Beyond that, you unlock the dozens of variables (vehicles, pilots, weapons, missions) for additional freelance runs. That's the game.

Most complaints I've seen have to do with repetition (see above) and controls. You can customize controls somewhat, using different modes for different vehicle types. And, y'know, maybe people think the mechs should just be faster and more nimble. They can be sort of cumbersome, but not in a way that's incomprehensible. These are not Gundam. They don't move like people. Even the fast mechs have to be maneuvered with care. Some vehicles can plow through obstacles more quickly than others, though they are slower going down the street. Some weapons have long, slow arcs, and some shoot straight. Some weapons don't penetrate walls as well as others do. If you don't want to pay attention to (and experiment with) mechanical details such as these, this might not be the game for you. If forgetting that you can't survive blowing up a fuel depot while you're standing right in the middle of it makes you overly mad, this might not be the game for you.

Brigador is a game where you play a Brigador: an amoral lunatic who kills for money, hired by a corporation to go do various war crimes in an attempt to commit reverse Sim City.

HOW IT PLAYS.

Base gameplay of Brigador is you drive around a vehicle, like a tank, a car with jury rigged guns and anti-gravity pads, a mech, a mech made out of truck parts, a tractor with guns on it, a giant floating metal head that can scream at people ect, and you have a list of objectives to do. Blow up these buildings, kill these specific guys, decimate the garrison of the area you're in, stuff like that, and then you have to get out alive. 

The game controls from a top down perspective, and although its no longer the default with the Up-Armored edition, it's really meant to have tank controls. It really matters in gameplay, as there's directional damage stuff going on, and the new default controls make it really hard to back up while shooting, which is something you need to do when you've kicked the hornets nest by accident and thirty tanks and mechs are rushing you down.

There's an alert system, where some enemies, typically smaller faster machines, but sometimes super-heavies, upon seeing you for long enough, or getting shot at, will start to radio in your location. If they live long enough to scream for help, the entire map goes on full alert. Vehicles that were idling with their engines off will kick on, every single thing with shields will turn them on, and everything within a set radius will charge in your direction, not a death sentence, but certainly a problem to be avoided. This also causes emergency gates to pop up, blocking roads and neighborhoods off from you, depending on what weapons you're using this ranges from a nonissue to annoying, given that in most cases you can blow up the regular walls right next to them and just walk around through the rubble.

Besides the typical objectives, there's even more stuff to blow up on the map. There's your typical explosive barrels, in the form of gas storage silos, oil drills, and gas pipelines. You got radio towers that make radio calls take longer to go out if blown up, and transformer substations that cut the power to the entire map when smashed. Not just the emergency gates that pop up for alarms, ALL the power, from street lights to neon signs, which is a lot of extra lighting work needed, and I appreciate the effort.

HOW IT LOOKS.

COOL. Brigador has a lot of work put into it to make it look good, and this really shows in the vehicles. It makes sense these would look good given that these are what you're going to be looking at closely most of the time, either being what you drive or what you shoot at. From how I understand it, they made 3D models of everything, then took a lot of pictures of it from different angles, and then used those pictures to make sprites instead of rendering everything in full blown 3D, which still retains the small details of the model and also probably makes the game run better. Bullet tracers, lasers, missiles, and cannon fire all look great as well. Things that hurt look like they should.

There's also a bunch of effort that shows in the environment, all of the buildings both look good, and are very clear in what they're meant to be. That's a house, that's a casino, that's a tomb, that's a bar, that's a gas station, that's a gazebo, that's a strip club, that's a shanty shack, that's a warehouse, that's a combination casino/bar/strip club. Everything is very readable and that helps each map feel unique as you move though Solo Nobre blowing everything that moves to hell and back.

HOW IS SOUNDS

SICK. Brigador has a sick synthwave soundtrack by ""Makeup and Vanity Set"", would recommend a listen, absolutely fits with the tone of the game. Environmental stuff like the sound of tank engine, stomping mech footsteps and gunfire also have the level of punch you'd expect. Cannon fire has the omph behind it that you'd want, and there's a minigun that sounds like it came off an A-10.

BRIGADOR IS A GOOD GAME, GO PLAY IT, GO LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK, GO CHECK OUT THE AUDIOBOOK.

I give it a ""GREAT LEADER IS DEAD"" out of ""SOLO NOBRE MUST FALL"" would gladly recommend.

当初买这个游戏的理由很简单，看到推荐“解压游戏”“全地图破坏”等，存粹当作一个爽游来买的。
然而点开游戏之后没想到世界观设定竟然如此细致和周密，阵营之间的错综复杂的关系，玩家并非英雄，而错综复杂的政治局势让这个游戏根本没有“正义”的一方。
“独裁者”死了，然后呢？自由？解放？美好生活？事实告诉你这些都是放屁，政权瓦解带来的只有无尽的混乱，以及混乱中试图将自己的利益最大化的各个势力在互相斗争，无论是你是保皇派，无政府主义者还是大企业的雇员，这一切都已经毫无意义了，意识形态只告诉你该站在哪一边，把枪交到你的手上然后告诉你用子弹捍卫自己的理念，但是他们不会告诉你什么是“道德”和“正义”，在剧情任务中我一直避免去击杀那些穿黄色雨衣的平民，但是事实上在混乱的战局以及逐渐解锁的大规模杀伤性武器面前，这是毫无意义的。今天在我用305MM高爆攻城榴弹花费不到百分之一秒的时间就摧毁一个街区和其中的叛军时，跳出了一个成就“习惯化”，解锁条件是杀死1000个平民。我震惊了并且打算写下评论，是的，即使小心翼翼的去避免平民伤亡，在战争中杀死1000个平民也不过是一个很容易达到的“附带损失”，而且，玩家很容易就会把杀死那些黄色小人当作稀松平常的事情，一如那个成就“习惯化”的字面意思，何等的讽刺。
“在现代战争中，你会像条狗一样毫无意义的死去。——欧内斯特·海明威”，玩过这个游戏这句话就不难理解，而且不知为何我个人觉得这个世界观在某些部分可以和极乐迪斯科的世界观接轨。希望制作者能够继续带来这个世界观内的其他故事。",1696224314,1696224314,True,31,0,0.73926854133605957,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I can tell you that there is no simple answer to that question. It depends heavily on your own personal tastes. But if you read the rest of this review, I will tell you what you need to like in order for this game to be worth buying.

Brigador is a cult-classic for a reason, the actual meat of the core gameplay loop is surprisingly small. The main campaign is a series of series of challenge maps with pre-determined loadouts, essentially difficulty settings (though I find the hardest are often more about being methodical and patient, not necessarily harder), which are tied together by a loose plot thread only really given in the mission description.

The actual feeling of playing the game is awesome, you can really feel the power of the vehicles you pilot, with entire city blocks coming down when you pull the trigger, and the yellow raincoat clad civilians giving the sense of scale of the violence, all to the tune of Makeup And Vanity Set's killer synthwave soundtrack. Undercutting it only slightly is the sound effects, which, in my opinion, don't quite match the devastation caused by the weapons. Take care with the controls; this game is not a twin-stick shooter, it defaults to those controls because everyone thought it would be from the trailer, and so the devs added it in. Tanks and Mechs play better with tank controls, and though it is somewhat more complex, it better sells the notion that you're piloting a 7-ton war machine. I'm no artist, but I find the visual style very pleasing, the colour composition appeals to me (lots of neon-signs in every hue) and the low-resolution sprites are both wonderfully made and tie into the established technology level of the setting (computers in Brigador are far less advanced than our own). It can get a little stale to look at after playing for too long.

The freelance mode, to me, is the actual intended way of playing the game. There, you get to pick your loadout; pilot, vehicle, weapons, special ability and the mission you want to run. And this is where the game hooked me, not because the gameplay was any more engaging, but because every one of those loadout options has a text entry describing it, written from the perspective of one of three characters in the game itself, often including details about the history of the world itself. And that world is fascinating to me. If you have the time to read, you'll find the world is positively dripping with character.

And therein lies the crux of my recommendation; would you buy a fun, well crafted, if repetitive game, just because the writing of the world-building is beyond amazing?
If yes, check out the audiobook too (there is a free excerpt available on youtube), it's astonishingly well written, providing even more insight into the world and the trials of the people who inhabit it, and it's narrated by Ryan Cooper, a man with a voice I can only describe as northern English butter.
If no, you probably won't get enough enjoyment out of it to get your money's worth.",1695481581,1698166679,True,4,0,0.577525317668914795,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Main issue is the crosshair. It's too small and even gets hidden by destructables(buildings, trees) because it's in game space. You easily lose track of it when there is a lot of enemies. A simple cross in screenspace with a configurable size and color would make a big difference. It's not rocket science, it's simple math. You just convert that aiming point to screenspace. Unless there was some kind of engine limitation ?
Apparently you can configure it through the debug menu, which I found a post about in the forums. Well, that debug menu made my game crash.
Anyway it should be in the options in the first place.

Even with the campaign, the game feels more like a sandbox. Just different missions to complete with different mechs. There are tons of unlockables, yet I don't feel compelled to unlock things.

The AI could be better. Early missions teach you about smoke bombs and also flanking, because armor strength is directional, so I thought that a certain level of stealth was possible. But in most missions, I quickly get spotted, enemies home in on you very fast, and then it's just chaos.

If you play with mouse and keyboard, you're better off using tank controls (called 'relative' in the options). 
'absolute' (the default) is better suited for a gamepad with an analog stick.

В нашем распоряжении техника 3х фракций Лоялистов/Корвидов/Спейсеров.
Техника подразделяется на основные виды Мехи/Танки/Антигравы, которые в свою очередь на лёгкие/тяжёлые/ультра.
Каждая единица техники имеет различные характеристики, влияющие на стиль боя.

2 режима игры:
""кампания"" проходим задания с повышением сложности которых нам позволяют выбрать из 1-4 бригадоров, техника которых заранее предопределена и оружие с оборудованием предустановлены.
 
""фриланс""тут всё за деньги, около 50и пилотов и вся доступная техника в игре, задания те же что и в компании но доступ к ним ограничивается размером Вашего кошелька, тут мы уже можем разгуляться на полную, единственное ограничение связанно с вооружением которое подходит не на все виды креплений. Выбор пилота и техники кардинально изменяет стиль боя, вид врагов, количество денежных единиц. Например берем:
1.	пилот ""Аудитор"", машина ""Материнская любовь"" на задании нас встретят командиры передвигающиеся пешком и турели, даже если мы уничтожим все что можно уничтожить на карте мы по итогу получим 200000.
2.	пилот ""Креститель Яков"", машина ""жулик"" на задании нас встретят командиры передвигающиеся на тяжёлой и ультра техники, если поднимите тревогу через несколько секунд в зависимости от вероисповедания Вас поприветствуют в загробном мире, награда в случае выживания и успешного выполнения хотя бы одного задания 10000000.

Отдельное спасибо за аудио исполнение, чудные треки в сочетании с атмосферой игры убеждают мой мозг думать что где то в этом мире мрачного будущего солдат Тодд спасает мирное население Аркадии, офицер Кей киснет на лестнице, а слёзы лучшего из людей навсегда затеряются в дожде…

After rectifying that mistake, I've learned that the world is lush, and the excellent audiobook, albums, visual design, and other trappings all serve to flesh it out well - with some caveats.

The story telling in-game is not voiced, and can lend itself to being dense at an average glance. Additionally, that engrossing lore is the thing keeping it all together, but it can seem daunting to break into from afar. Think less ""Telltale games"", and more original ""Armored Core"" in regards to narrative delivery.

One other complaint is that after the great 1st few missions things do ""initially"" slow down due to the types of weapons you're tasked with piloting. They do pick back up as the world begins to open up, but average players could be deterred by the slower mech piloting differences. It is certainly not a narrative choice I would have made, but overall ""Brigador"" keeps up with the best of 90's isometric gaming and easily surpasses them in other detail oriented ways.

The graphics are nothing to write home about but the design and look is interesting enough make you forget that. 
The campaign is great at introducing the mechanics and teaching you how to master them without saying much. 
The acqusitions tab provides a place to get lost in the story of the world, the pilots you play as, and even the background of how the vehicles and weapons came to be. The lore feels inspired by dune, battletech, cyberpunk, maschinsen krieger, and even the real life history of CIA intervention in south america.

略有亮点的俯视角射击游戏。

你是跨星际企业的佣兵，力所能及地在索罗洛布列大开杀戒，所以你在游戏里的目标就只有一个：摧毁——要么任务是摧毁敌人首领，要么任务就是摧毁特定建筑物，任务大同小异，玩久了立马疲惫，此外，越到后面任务越阴间，经常是给个破烂机甲让你去面对七八十个敌人，最后一关敌人多到头皮发麻，没活了就硬堆怪。

剧情除了在档案选项里出现的文档、开头的两句话以及任务装备下的介绍，就没有了，除非自己闲的没事打开档案看个几十分钟，否则估计对于整体世界框架一无所知，剧情存在感太薄弱，任务后续同质化严重，除非很喜欢炸炸炸的感觉，这个游戏我觉没有什么可以吸引玩家继续玩下去。

除去以上的缺点之外，我觉得其他的都是优点，几十种载具可供选择，多种武器多种类别，不同的武器带来的穿透力与弹道是不一样的，武器的表现力与力量感非常好，88mm炮穿透贫民窟的铁皮房一炮击毁敌方载具的感觉与众不同，弹链炮如雨泼出，305mm迫击炮从空中给予毁灭，机甲的厚重、悬浮平台的灵巧、动力骨骼的敏捷、坦克的力量，竟被一个一G左右的游戏完美的体现了出来，坦克操控模式更是提升了一个档次的沉浸感，除去战役任务固定载具使用，你可以开随机合约，自由选择驾驶员，按照喜好挑选载具、配置武装，在随机地图上用弹坑肆意涂抹。

画面玩法宣传图所见即所得，这个游戏虽然后期无力，但是依然不错，值得一玩。",1692089917,1692090282,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

...hé bien c'est aussi le cas :-P
Ceci étant dit, même si ce n'est pas mon type de jeu préféré, il faut reconnaître qu'il est tout de même bien réalisé.
Sans casser 3 pattes à un canard, il remplit sa fonction première, à savoir; un petit défouloir vaguement technique.

Pour résumer rapidement, voici ce qu'il propose:
On part en mission, qui deviennent plus ou moins difficile à mesure qu'on les débloque, et qui se décline en plusieurs étapes 3, 5, ...etc... 12, ou plus...
On gagne de l'argent, ce qui nous permet d'acheter les services des pilotes disponibles, lesquels sont plus ou moins bons selon les 5 ou 6 bonus que la fiche ""pilote"" propose.
Avec ce même argent, nous déloquerons aussi les véhicules, leur armes, ainsi que d'acheter/débloquer des missions plus avancées.

3 Type de véhicules: Mecha, tank, hovercraft. Tous aussi moches les uns que les autres.
Vous pouvez équiper les véhicules avec 2 armes, parmi un choix assez varié qui se décline comme arme:
Lourde, intermédiaire, légère, missile ou motier

Sur les cartes, les objectifs sont systématiquement les mêmes:
Entrer sur la carte

Péter des tours
Péter tours, mais d'un autre type
Péter des tours de ravitaillement
Péter un certain nombre de véhicules ennemis
Péter les ""capitaines"" qui sont des véhicules plus costaud
Sortir et passer soit à l'étape suivante, soit à la caisse, merci $$$

Puis on choisira une autre mission, et on recommence la même chose.

Difficile? Non!
Punitif? Oui! 

La difficulté principale réside en une seule situation. Se trouver à côté d'un élément explosif lorsqu'il pète à cause d'un tir perdu de l'AI. Sans cela, je n'ai jamais été inquiété.
Une citerne cachée? BOOM
Et là, si vous étiez sur une mission à 12 étapes, et que vous en étiez à la onzième - retour case départ...
Alors on se fera chi*r à refaire les 11 étapes soporifiques, soit répéter 11 fois les actions citées ci-dessus, pour pouvoir effectuer ces mêmes actions à la 12ème étape pour encaisser l'argent. Puis recommencer sur une nouvelle mission.

Voilà voilà...

Ah si, il faut aussi gérer vos munitions. Je n'en ai jamais manqué, et il y a des tours pour ravitailler au max une seule fois. Alors ça devrait passer sans problème si vous savez viser. Sinon tampis pour vous, il faudra finir au corps-à-corps.

Sinon bon, en utilisant le hovercraft, j'ai eu un vague souvenir plaisant de l'époque d'un certain jeu qui se jouait à bord d'un hélico,en vue de dessus il y a 25 ans+-...J'me rapelle plus le titre...dommage j'y rejouerais bien :-P

Les 2 musiques qui accompagnent le jeu sont sympa.
La traduction est correcte pour ceux qui ne parlent pas anglais, et combien même, même un anglais basique suffira, cela d'autant plus que les bonus et informations lisibles sont visuellement explicites.

Enfin pour conclure je dois voter en négatif et la raison en ai la suivante:
En aucune façon, le jeu ne peut justifier le prix de 22€
Toutes les cartes se ressemblent, la seule différence réside dans les unités que vous rencontrerez, et la dispositions des ""tours à péter"" sur les cartes.

Par conséquent, du contenu, il n'y en a PAS. Le développement se résume à pondre une boucle de jeu sur une carte, puis d'ajouter des étapes, sur ces mêmes cartes, pour justifier d'un niveau supérieur??? Ah non mes amis, ça ce n'est pas du contenu.
J'ai acheté le jeu à 8€, et j'ai tout de même hésiter à me faire rembourser, même comme j'ai apprécié de faire péter des bâtiments pendant un peu plus de 2 heures, ce n'était plus possible :-P

Edit: Desert Strike (1992) puis Jungle Strike 1993. Puis les suivants étaient moins bien.

It's a good game, but is extremely monotonous with some frustrating controls. Every mission is some variation on kill x number of loyalists or destroy x number of structures. Rinse and repeat for every single of this game's 37 missions. This is too many IMO for what's offered. There is little to no story in game. The audiobook is external media that must be purchased separately and therefore does not count. Instead of allowing you to pick whichever vehicle you want to take into the mission, you must select 1 of 4 options presented. This really sucks since you may not enjoy playing as any of the four you're provided. The final missions were especially frustrating due to me personally not liking any of the vehicles. Freelance mode remedies this by allowing you to pick whatever you want. Movement is awkward regardless of control scheme. Vehicles control somewhat realistically, so moving backwards is much slower than moving forward and in the heat of the moment, trying to avoid getting shot can be a hassle. Aiming is especially awkward since you only vaguely get an idea on where you're aiming. Weapons with an arc pattern are awful to aim with since the angle makes it hard to determine where your shot will land. The isometric perspective is more troublesome than helpful. 90% of my deaths came from me not realizing I was too close to some object and firing an explosive weapon killing myself or at least removing the majority of my health. The game doesn't try to show when your shot is being blocked. Dying due to some explosive structure going off next to you cause of an aggressive enemy spraying away is annoying especially with late game missions taking much longer and being more difficult. I enjoyed the tactical/stealth approach to the design. It's not just a straight up twin stick shooter. There's great enemy variety and the levels are dense with fully destructible buildings everywhere. The visuals are gorgeous. The lighting and color scheme give it a cyberpunk aesthetic I really dig. The spritework is incredibly detailed and well animated. Couple that with an excellent soundtrack from synthwave artist Vanity & Makeup Set and it's a feast for the ears and eyes. Weapons feel powerful and sound punchy. There's a huge number of playable characters each with their own vehicle that looks and handles differently. From quick glass cannon stealth mechs to slow towering tanks decimating everything in its path, there's something for everyone. Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Steam, most people haven't actually completed the campaign. My super rare trophy for completing some late game missions make that very apparent. That's understandable given the game's overall high difficulty. I do enjoy Brigador and recommend it, but it could've benefited with more mission variety, some boss fights and more in-game story for better context on what's happening. A better aiming scheme would've helped alleviate some frustration too. None of the playable characters have any actual ""character"" to them. It's a game that started strong, but lost its luster with me over time. Regardless, it's clearly a labor of love and brought back memories of playing Future Cop LAPD and MechCommander as a kid, and that's never a bad thing.

I came into this looking for an action packed top-down shooter and this game absolutely delivers on that itch... and way more. 

There are so many different vehicles and weapons that handle and play so differently. Some options are absolutely more powerful than others and that's honestly part of the fun. There were stealthy sniper builds, hit and run builds, run and gun builds, moving fortress builds, and every flavor in between. It scratched my itch for chaotic shooter action and for something far more tactical, and I think that the variety of different gameplay styles has kept my interest alive far longer than I was planning for. Some vehicles can feel clunky to control in exchange for speed or defense, but I really appreciated how each vehicle felt like it had a place it was best suited for. The controls will take some effort (and maybe an extra mouse button or two) to master, so just be aware not every vehicle can be operated without effort (but some definitely can).

Oh, and if you love the presentation and dystopian sci fi, this game nails it with some fascinating and meticulously written lore--but you can skip practically all of this if you don't want to do tons of reading.

Beautiful neon and cyberpunk aesthetics, with a dash of industrial and even classical sculptural art styles on some of the monuments and statues (and vehicles even; like Mother's Love and Zed Prime.

The music is killer too!
These guys also spent alot of time and care crafting their game universe's lore, which is much appreciated!
There is something in here for everyone, whether you love giant walkers, tanks, hover vehicles, or giant floating heads with eye lasers! They even have little power armors if you want to play cat-and-mouse with the enemies.

I had fun for the first 10-15 hours as I learned the mechanics and weapon setups, but after that my enjoyment fell off a cliff when I realized how completely wack the balance is, and how much of a grind the final achievements were. I had enough of a good time to give a soft recommendation, but I don't think this quite hits the ""hidden masterpiece"" criteria it was advertised as... and I can definitely see how initial sales could be poor, especially if earlier versions were even more unbalanced. 

The story in Brigador is top tier. After the death of an influential and (arguably) stabilizing leader, a megacorp mass-contracts the planet's local mercenary population to cause as much havoc as possible within a 24 hour window, and extract off-planet before local security forces can stabilize and mount a proper defense. Collateral damage and civilian casualties are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged. You're straight up being paid to be a war criminal and nobody cares; the megacorp doesn't care, the pilots don't care, the player doesn't care. The entire planet is your sandbox to smash around and get paid millions for, and I love it. 

The art style is a bit weird and uncanny, which is both good and bad. Environments look really good and virtually everything is destructible, but the maps can get cluttered fast, especially in dense urban environments where you're tripping over every single pebble just to move around. 

Getting into Brigador can seem daunting; there are 5 tiers of weapons classes (with 8 different weapon choices per tier), 4 active systems, 3 different factions each with 3 different mech types, and an enormous selection of mechs in between. The game throws a lot at you all at once, and while the tutorial helps a bit, it's very slow and has a bad habit of sticking you on mechs with terrible weapon loadouts... less so in the earlier missions, but definitely more so on the later ones I'm assuming were added in the Up-Armoured addition. So let me try to break it down:


Mechs - There are three types: walkers, tanks, and hovercraft. Walkers have the ability to crouch and lower their profile (I think this is also supposed to reduce damage, but I found that dodging hits is better than trying to tank them), and are most affected by terrain. Tanks tend to have lower profiles, and are still affected by terrain but usually have speed boosts to help them out. Hovercraft can ignore passive terrain but are still blocked by buildings & hard obstacles, which greatly diminishes their utility, as they tend to be squishier and have generally worse weapon options.

Mechs can range from giant death machines to tiny powersuits.  There's an enormous range of classes per mech & faction subtype, with the smaller ones generally being harder & with worse weapon loadouts, but give better post-mission payouts. Note that being in smaller mechs doesn't necessarily equate to them being faster than bigger ones.

As a point of personal preference, I find medium-heavy tanks to perform the best out of all available mech types. Walkers are fine but tend to be slow, more affected by terrain, and with a dubious active ability. Hovercraft tend to be too squishy and ignoring terrain isn't as handy an ability as one might hope. I found that the Brokenheart tank was the most efficient platform in the game; sports a heavy & main weapon slot, lower size profile, good speed, and very nice staying power for aggressive players, to the point where I could clear entire maps in hyper-aggressive brawls and come out victorious... albeit sometimes barely. Anything larger tends to be too slow, and anything smaller tends to be too squishy & with lesser weaponry. 


Weapons - Ranging from Heavy, Main, Auxiliary, Turret, and Small. Basically the smaller you go, the worse the weapons are, with very few exceptions. Smaller mechs tend to wield smaller weapons but again there are exceptions, for example the Sledge is a powersuit walker that's basically a heavy weapon on legs. These are further sub-divided into 4 weapon categories: cannons, ballistics, explosives, and lasers, with two options each per weapon type. These all vary greatly in what they do, but they tend to vary between a rapid-fire options and a slower use but more powerful option. 

I would say that weapon usability is the single greatest point of contention for this game. A bad mech can be made good with a proper weapon, but a good mech can be virtually worthless with bad ones. And there are a LOT of bad ones, personally I find anything below Main-class weapons to be not worth their time, especially when it comes to ballistic options. A lot of them tend to be too hyper-specific, like dealing purely with shields or armour. Anything regarding mortars is basically too slow to be used with reasonable consistently, and Auxiliary ballistics and below tend to not be worth their weight in salt. These problems tend to be compounded on storyline missions where you have no choice on what you can equip.

In my experience, it's usually best to have a powerful rapid-fire weapon, and a secondary that either helps deal with crowds or single-target damage. Thus, enter the Konig and the Zeus. The Konig is Brigador's perfect weapon; incredible damage against everything, huge range, handles both light & heavy targets, lots of dakka... frankly able to solo the entire game just by itself. It struggles to penetrate cover and quickly take down super-heavies, which is where the Zeus comes in: instant-hit railgun, penetrates every type of cover imaginable, excellent single-target damage with a bit of AOE. These two weapons form basically the perfect combination, and the Brokenheart can field both... you can see why it's my favourite mech of the game. Barring the Kraken, which has a bit less damage and anti-swarm damage than the Konig but WAY better cover penetration, the Konig sets the president for what a good weapon SHOULD be, and everything else tends to fall way flat. 


Special Abilities are unlimited-use special abilities with timed cooldowns:
-Smoke is the most useless s*** in existence, creating too small an AOE that dissipates too fast vs enemies that move far too quickly. No offensive utility. This really needed to be changed/improved, like allowing the player to hide in the smoke rather than only having it affect enemies.
-Active Camouflage doesn't really help unless you're in a very small mech, enemies tend to swarm you and know your exact location anyway.
-EMP has great crowd control but a punishingly long cooldown. The devs value this WAY too highly and virtually any story mech that has this on it is guaranteed to have inferior weaponry. 
-Audio-Kinetic Pulse does everything. It stuns, deals massive area damage instantly, levels buildings & terrain to dust (a lot of harder difficulty deaths come from getting stuck on terrain when facing swarming enemies), and has a reasonably short cooldown. There's really no reason to use anything else.


To conclude, Brigador is good, but gets worse over time when you realize how bad most of the weapons are, and how few ACTUAL choices you have for usable mech loadouts. For a game that's supposedly received so many updates since launch, I'm astonished that the weapon & ability balancing is still so off. It's by no means a masterpiece, and there's a MASSIVE jump in difficulty between the initial story missions and what was added in the Up-Armoured updates. But I did get pretty close to a 1-to-1, hours-to-dollars rate, and had a good time for the first 10 - 15 hours, so I'm happy enough to give it a soft recommendation.",1682898772,1682898772,True,21,0,0.730722367763519287,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The campaign and the freelance mode both present a sort of destructible sandbox, one where you get leeway to experiment with your playstyle. A good run or mission will see you blasting your way through scores of enemies, smashing buildings as you go and using the inherent chaos of battle to your advantage--if you can play smart enough, that is. Mastering the quirks of your mech, tank, or a-grav craft is key to inflicting maximum destruction before you run out of ammo or get ground down to death.

The plot and lore are unobtrusive, but they're still there for those who are intrigued. The setting itself definitely makes me want to dive in deeper. I want to know more about this sci-fi pseudo-cyberpunk planetary war story the developer has crafted.

If you're a fan of BattleTech, Command & Conquer, Warhammer 40K, or any other strategic sci-fi thing, Brigador should be exactly your jam.

Brigador is an excellently-made isometric sprite-graphic vehicular combat simulation. It oozes style and backs it up with substance. The controls are highly-responsive and, I think, quite good, considering the deliberate inclusion of tank controls for tank and legs units.

The lore poses questions about community prosperity versus individual escape from the grind, about whether it is better to live in an isolationist dictatorship or under the crushing weight of capitalism. It asks: would you ruin the lives of your community to escape? Would you make everything worse for everyone for freedom?

Two years ago from the time of writing, give or take, one of the authors of this work was discovered posting essentially every flavor of bigoted remark it was possible to make by posters on SomethingAwful, a dead comedy web forum, on a different, lesser-known forum.

The Monahan brother responsible apologized, and gave the usual boilerplate do-better nothing-apology and suspended his involvement with Stellar Jockeys.

Today, he is once again listed on staff and is regularly posting development updates for their next game, Brigador Killers.

I can't refund this game. I owned it long before that extremely unfortunate news came to light. Moreover, I LIKE Brigador, which is incredibly frustrating, as you might guess from the giant red thumbs-down at the top of this review.

Brigador is great! I can't recommend anyone purchase it. I love the characters! Every single one is now shadowed by the racist, sexist, anti-semitic, transphobic remarks of one of the pivotal members responsible for their creation.

Has Mr. Monahan grown in the two years since? I don't know. It's impossible for me to know. If he learned anything, I'm sure he learned to stop using the same username everywhere.

With that in mind, if you must try Brigador, I advise you to do so through methods that do not require you to pay for it, like library-sharing.As for me, maybe now that I've put all these thoughts down and added my drop to the bucket, I can finally run into exploding pipes with some measure of peace.",1679628409,1681180300,False,17,5,0.503308713436126709,0,True,False,False,True,,,

If you're into mechs and destructible environments, you're gonna love this game.

Once you've played a dozen missions and start caring about the lore, you're going to find out about the hidden depths of what is going on on Solo Novo.

The gameplay may seem at first like a generic twin-stick shooter, but that's far from how you play it, too.

The music and lighting are superb, each mech handles differently, the effects of gunfire and explosions are awesome, and you really have to play tactically, or you are going to get bumrushed by the enemy.
The Freelance mode is awesome, but finish the campaign first, so you can get a handle of each category of vehicle and weapons.

And if you're into the lore, get the accompanying audiobook, it's superb.

He had almost bitten the cigar planted firmly in his creased mouth a couple streets back, after a Corvid Rat King had slung two 140mm “Bishop” rounds as he rounded a corner.

The multi-storey apartment next to him had taken most of the brunt of the shot, the shields of 8 Balls Touro mech taking the remaining shrapnel with little trouble. The gaping hole left in the apartment next to him, had fared worse, the remains of the few families left living this side of town, decorating the demolished fragments of their home with blood and viscera. 

It wasn't the gore. Spending enough time pulverizing the local bandit populous through the scope of a 80 tonnes of hissing, pounding steel tended to dull the nauseating reaction of watching a human being turned inside out by a gamma ray.  8 Ball had plenty of that experience. No, this was seething hatred. Gritted teeth, white knuckle, hatred. 

8 Ball continued around the block, counting on the Corvids to set their guns south, from where was originally engaged, or west, the direction of the road he had headed when he was first engaged by the Corvid ultra mech. 

He weaved his controls around the rows of apartment flats and neon dive bars, his knee bouncing on his mechs trigger in anticipation. As he rounded the final corner, only a 4 storey office, no doubt filled with squatters, stood between him and the stench of Corvid mech. 

To the Corvids, the air had ignited as the building their Rat King was posted next to vaporized in a cloud of concrete dust and previous inhabitants. The sonic blast was followed by the visual of a Loyalist mech breaching the dust cloud, heavy gamma blasts making quick work of their cobbled together shields. The mech bore a large round black spot on its hull, a distinctive “8”, legible for a split second, before the heavy cannon fire breached the cockpit.

As the massive mech's legs gave out, the wave of Corvid crewmen scattered like roaches from its hull. 8 Ball powered through the tangled mess of car chassis and cannibalized mech systems, a firm foot of the Touro landing on the gunners section, sending a distinctive red splash up the side of its left leg. He quickly re-orientated the mech, finally biting the cigar in half as his foot planted on the trigger, the gamma ray vaporizing the fleeing crew. 

After hunting down and watching the final remnants of the crew invert their torsos, 8 Ball turned back south, and went hunting once again.

Attention aux impressions trompeuses, Brigador n'est pas un twin stick shooter. Les contrôles sont plus complexes que ça, notamment parce qu'il y a la distance à prendre en compte. 
N'essayez pas de jouer à la manette et mettez les contrôles en relatif (comme si pour une voiture téléguidée).

Pour simplifier, le but de Brigador est de tout faire péter, mais en finesse.
On a accès à trois familles de véhicules : mecha (idéal pour les embuscades), tank (lent, bourrin et robuste) et aéroglisseur (rapide mais fragile) et deux armes disponibles (utilisées par le clic gauche et le clic droit) parmi beaucoup : mitrailleuses, cannons, lasers, railguns, gaz corrosifs, shotguns, mortiers etc.
Notre véhicule a une armure (irréparable) et un bouclier (rechargeable et même surchargeable pour une durée limitée). Les ennemis abattus laissent tomber des recharges de munition et de bouclier qui disparaissent au bout de quelques secondes. Il faut donc prioriser selon la situation. Se dépêcher d'aller les récupérer au risque de s'exposer au feu ennemi ? Ou éliminer toute menace d'abord ?

L'action est incroyablement jouissive et la grande variété d'armes et de véhicules fait qu'on ne s'ennuie pas et nous force à changer de stratégie selon les situations. La plupart du temps l'action se déroule dans des environnements urbains et on peut se servir des bâtiments pour se cacher, se protéger ou carrément passer à travers pour surprendre l'ennemi.
Les graphismes sont plaisants, la musique (de la synthwave) est sublime et l'univers bien travaillé.
Le jeu comporte une grosse campagne avec une bonne variété de niveaux, avec des missions bonus (certaines sont assez frustrantes en étant trop longues et difficiles) et un mode freelance où on peut paramétrer son véhicule dans des missions customs.

Brigador est un jeu unique en son genre. En tout cas je n'ai jamais joué à un jeu similaire.",1674877162,1674877162,True,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Brigador is fun, full stop. From lumbering around in a walker and enacting war crimes that would see me hung if video game crimes were real, to accidentally blowing myself and my poor little tank into the next city block after incorrectly gauging the fire arc of my howitzer, this game is insanely fun. I would finish my daily run and let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding, relieved to be finshing one run and eager to go for another. 

The art direction is fantastic, portraying a sometimes gritty, sometimes glitzy, always eye-catching idea of an off-planet science fiction future hellscape. The music complements the action and gameplay in an excellent way; I am a player who usually listens to my own music while playing other video games, but I never felt the need to do that playing Brigador. 

If you are playing on Windows, I highly, highly recommend the game. If you find yourself in the unenviable position of playing it on MacOS, like I find myself, I would hold off. Currently there is a problem getting the game to launch, where reinstalling the game or rolling back to a previous version of the game does not solve this issue. I suspect it more has to do with a recent MacOS update, but I digress; if you are playing on a Mac, I would check to see if this issue is resolved before buying.

You've most likely fought many hectic battles against hordes of enemies, coming close to death at least a few times more than you'd have liked to. And life punishes you for your arrogance by giving you brain lag for a few seconds so you die after running into two otomo lasers.

So yeah. This game gets very difficult towards the end (campaign and achievements). There will be a lot of high action moments where your reaction speed and situational awareness will be put to the test.

All the time you're playing this you will be listening to the great dark synthwave soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set (M.A.V.S.). That madlad has produced three EPs just for this game and overall makes great music. (I highly recommended that you check him out on Bandcamp)

I enjoyed my time with this game and struggling towards completing all achievements.
Theoretically it has a decent amount of replayability after you're done if you try out difficult and weird loadouts or install the community hardcore mod (sadly haven't tried the latter yet).

The only negatives I can list are unfulfilled dreams that would have pushed the game even further. Specifically I would've wished for more than the standard gamemode, an easier to use map editor and perhaps even multiplayer.

As an American who likes a comeback king story as much as I like high calorie count and cholesterol choked food, Brigador's tale warms my heart. It came out, it hit the floor like a fetus in the backseat of a Buick and no one cared. Every one gave it crap, didn't give it what it deserved and Stellar Jockeys didn't give up. They tightened their bootstraps, cracked their knuckles and took a mediocrely reviewed games into one of the most entertaining mech top down shooters in recent memory and made me actually stop and read the lore of it. I rarely do that for games. 

You are a Brigador, a hired mercenary brought in by interstellar corporation SNC to reclaim their former colony of Novo Solo which fell under the rule of ""Great Leader"", a totalitarian general who seized control in a coup and made Nobre independent from the SNC. Great Leader's greatness enforced by legions of combat mechs, populism and interstellar cannons keeping people out of his orbit. However, Great Leader gets shot, and like a good dictator his entire empire crumbles to squabbling factions and you exist to be the Goldman Sachs backed sledgehammer to return corpo control to Solo Nobre and wrestle it from the hands of the Leader Loyalists, the schizophrenic syndicalist Corvids or the juiced up yuppies of the Spacers. And you intend to do this with one thing.

As many mechs, agrav ships and literal Killdozer tanks as you can find alongside whatever chaotic firearms, lasers, cannons and forcefields can fit and be wired to your engine like some cyberpunk LS swap. The tagline isn't kidding, this game hands you as manymachines to fit your destruction as you can handle, with weapons that range from simple to hilarious. It's a game where a laser weapon is as effective as strapping an M2HB to a flying car and drifting around combat droids. All the while you're getting hit with the full magazine tube of Makeup And Vanity Set's utterly DIVINE soundtrack, done in the correct level of bass heavy synthwave to befit this 1980's cyberpunk cityscape. Which is good, you need that bass to be heard over the chaos you can cause.

Beyond basic mission objectives, how you approach any engagement with the enemy comes down to you and what you want to do and the environment allows you to pull off anything. Everything on a map can be destroyed with enough time and ordinance, allowing you total freedom to play this anyway you want. Go for direct engagements with overwhelming firepower, use your ship like a drift missile blowing up larger machines from behind, saturation bombardment from afar with a literal tower of power mech that's about four stories high and armed with building destroying gas grenades, the world is your oyster and you need to shuck it as fast as you can.",1669589008,1669589286,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

In the tradition of old top-down shooters like Crusader: No Remorse, Brigador has very few competitors for just the sheer amount of glee I have tearing up levels and watching every one and thing exploding into a million pieces. It might be a bit awkward to get into and it can certainly have moments of frustration, but overall, this game is top of the line.

As soon as the game booted up, I was immediately drawn to it's presentation. The digitized 3D look of everything reminds me of that late 90s Command and Conquer era of graphics, heightened by a good amount of lighting effects that nailing the dystopic cyberpunkey look they're going for. The key piece to make the aesthetic really click though is that soundtrack. A perfect mix of electronic that compliments the game really well and gives the game so much of it's mood. The only gripe I have with the game on this front is that it seems like during particularly long missions, the music has a tendency of cutting off entirely, leaving me many times with dozens of minutes of nothing but the in-game sound effects. Fortunately, they are of equally high quality, as crunchy and satisfying as they need to be, so there is that.

As far as the gameplay goes, it's what you can expect. You are plonked onto the map, have to fight through the enemy hordes and take down key objectives like destroying certain buildings, kill a certain elite enemy or just clear out a majority of enemies off the map, after which you high-tail it out of there before the enemy can blow you up. It's here, where you'll come to one of the big deciding factors for the game, the controls. The game primarily uses tank-style movement, where you pivot the direction you are facing with A and D, while using W and S to move forward and backwards respectively. There is a more conventional movement control with the ""Screen Absolute"" option that it set as default after the Up-Armored update, but there are some tradeoffs you take with it. Your vehicles take damage depending on the direction you're facing and with Screen Absolute, it's easy to literally show your ass to the opponent and take increased damage completely by accident. Not to mention vehicles without 360 degree turrets, which can start swiveling out of control as the turret tries to orient itself. The game was clearly made with the tank-control scheme (called ""Relative"") in mind and how much you'll get out of the game will come down to how you can adapt to either control scheme.

The two major game modes are Campaign and Freelancer. In Campaign, you follow a set of missions with a selection of preset loadouts for each level, conveying the story through pre-mission text dumps. I know the lore is pretty expansive with audiobooks and whatnot, but the writing in the game itself is mostly just there to set the scene and give a bit of context to what you're doing. The campaign is a good place to get used to the game's controls, whether you opt for the psuedo-twinstick style or the more traditional tank controls and is overall a pretty good experience throughout. It gets a little ridiculous in difficulty by the very end, but you should be able to at least get to the end of the story just fine, with alot of the really wacky stuff coming from the post-game stuff, which just feels like a challenge set for experienced players.

Freelancer is a half-randomized mode, where you take on anywhere from singlular missions to multiple mission spanning marathons with some randomized elements from spawn points to the enemy you face. More importantly though, you get the freedom of fully customizing your loadouts, swapping between the many vehicles at your disposal and each have multiple options for weapons to equip from different weight-classes of weaponry. Vehicles with smaller gun platforms aren't to be dismissed though, as they will offer modifiers to end-mission rewards, encouraging players to challenge themselves with harder vehicles.

The customization aspect of Freelancer is where the real fun of the game shines brightest. It offers a variety in approaches that many current games try to implement, but never quite succeed. Specifically, the choice of stealth vs direct assault. Like in alot of newer games, you have a decision to either pack yourself with the heaviest calibers and mow down the opposition or you can take a more methodical approach as you destroy entire enemy formations before they've gotten to even fire. In alot of games, this ends up feeling quite shallow, as your player character is designed to be good at both at the same time, meaning either the choice to be stealthy feels arbitrary or the enemies are so over-tuned, that going for direct assault doesn't feel satisfying. Brigador splits it up well, where enemies that are unalerted can be more easily dealt with and the weapons that specialize in that tend to be inaccessible but to the smallest, most vulnerable vehicles. Meanwhile, you can take hulking big mechs with tanky health and big guns, but the game will adjust enemies accordingly, throwing in more and stronger enemies to compensate.

Not only that, but choosing between the direct or stealthy approach can also completely change how you approach levels and the unique challenges of both can feel like your playing a whole different game. When stealthing, a single scout that can alert enemies to your presence can be more scary than even the biggest, baddest elite enemy. You might not be as afraid of them if going in with heavy weaponry, but you might find yourself more on-alert for any suicide-bombers that could get mixed in with the carnage and completely ruin an otherwise flawless run. For me, there is nothing more satisfying than maximum stealth in the hardest conditions. Just take Precursor James, jump into the smallest mech you can find, slap on a Blackhand and spend up to 40 minutes on the most intense game of cat and mouse you'll ever play.

Due to it's unconventional control scheme, I am aware that this game might not appeal to everyone. However, to those that enjoy that type of game, those that are willing to give that style a shot or those who just don't care one way or the other, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is one of the best of it's kind that I've played in quite some time.",1668904658,1668905182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Although Brigador has a more modern game engine, it cannot replicate the most important atmospheric aspects that draw you into the whole dystopian setting and its lore. It also does not walk that fine line between action and strategy. It's all guns blazing with a constant struggle for ammunition, or overly strategic due to not being equipped for the job. Both playing methods quickly turn the gameplay loop into a drag. Completing missions feels like dragging yourself through the mud, instead of wanting to complete one more round and losing track of time in the process.

It feels like they replaced the top tier cast in a triple A science fiction movie, with B quality substitutes. Then slapping some alternative soundtrack on it and pretending to be edgy and cool.

The main issues in gameplay are the noise level and swarming enemies.

Weapons make noise, causing enemies to come over and inspect the place where that noise came from. The 3 issues with that are
1) that you get no indicator for the noise distance, so you can only guess, and 
2) that you can lure enemies 1 by 1, which you may have to do if you pilot any small vehicle, but which is also extremely boring and stupid (enemies will just turn around and try to get back to their previous spot if they find nothing, close by allies never join in for a search of the area, neither when the 1 enemy you got the attention from was alerted nor when it arrives at the location that it wants to check).
3) You can't spot & scan enemies, so you don't really know which weapons they've installed and what they're effective against or what their shield- and armor values look like - you'll learn that in the split second they're shooting at you and you're shooting at them.

Enemies can swarm the player for a variety of reasons:
-being spotted by multiple enemies
-noise alerting a lot of enemies (you using your loud weapons, enemies using their loud weapons, blowing something up that makes a lot of noise)
-an enemy finished its alarm, which alerted all other enemies to your presence
The issue with swarming is that it's very bad for any vehicle that's not durable and lethal.
For any durable and lethal vehicle it goes like this: Enemies swarm in, you destroy them, they drop ammo and shield pickups to regain what was lost in combat, you continue your rampage.
For any vehicle that's either not durable or not lethal it goes like this: You're getting swarmed. You're most likely getting overwhelmed and killed.
Normally there should be something available to your advantage for the disadvantage of not piloting a killing machine - but often there's nothing. While some vehicle are at least fast and small, which makes it hard to hit it with weapons that require some precision at least, that's not the case for all of them. Some vehicles are just death traps: Slow, weak in shields and armor, with only weak weapon systems as choice to install on them. The campaign, if you want the achievement, forces you to pilote some of these and sometimes sends you into a mission with weapons extremely unfitting for the level design and enemy types you encounter.

While there's some strategy you can play, like...
attacking enemies from the sides and back, where you can deal bonus damage to their armor, using the weapons you have right (some are more effective against armor, some against shields, some deal area damage, some damage in a line, some damage over time, some can shoot through or over objects, some have secondary effects), using cover (both against shots coming in and line of sight), luring enemies, using choke points, using explosive level objects to your advantage, paying attention to the noise levels, using your special system right, ramming / stomping enemies, making them blow up another with friendly fire
...there's still a large gap between what works and what doesn't work once you get into a very slow or very vulnerable vehicle, where you just hit a wall of try-until-the-odds-worked-for-you. And that's a design problem. Example: They give you a weak vehicle with low noise but also low range weapons and place enemies on the map that stand around in large groups of vehicles that can oneshot yours. Now it doesn't matter what special system you've installed on your vehicle: smoke launcher, EMP grenade, audio-kinetic pulse (blase wave in frontal cone that can level structures and destroy enemies) or invisibility. You're just not getting a kill, surviving that and have no chance of getting away once they're alerted to your presence.
It would really help if enemies had to lock on to you to keep firing at you and ""know"" where you are, allowing smaller and more vulnerable vehicles to more easily break this lock on by using obstacles or their special kit (as just mentioned), but there's no such mechanic. Additionally there's an issue with the weapon design: They're different degrees effective against shields and armor. Some enemies have lots of shields, some lots of armor, some lots of both. So IF you use any specialized weapon that's good only vs either shields or armor you immediately lose like 50% of your firepower, because first you've got to get through the shields, then through the armor, meaning that on each phase 1 of 2 weapons is almost useless. To solve this issue they could make the smaller weapons more lethal the closer they're to an enemy, but that's not a thing in the game.

They also don't take mobility into account for balancing, so that some vehicles that are weak and slow get the same equipment choices as such that are weak and fast, making the slow ones just worse without any upside that they get for having their disadvantage.

Now the only thing they're balancing in the game is: The worse the vehicle the more payment you get for completing the mission with one. But that's not enough, because in the campaign the money serves no value: You're not equipping your own vehicle, unlocking upgrades and features, but instead you get one handed with a specific setup that you can't change. Only the freelance mode (randomized missions) allows you to pick your own everything, and that's where you need the money to unlock that.

I kinda wish the game had more and better strategy but it's either mostly brawling with the vehicles that can handle that or lame careful gameplay with vehicles that can't because they're just worse and that's it. Imo skip the campaign and stick to freelance, you can make your money there too to unlock the other thins in freelance mode. The campaign was a mistake. There's some text story but nothing that sticks together as a whole. You can redefine the control mode for the different movement types (mech walker, hovercraft, tank), which is recommended.

The game is basically a gloryfied flash game and the good thing about it are the randomized maps with a good core pool of vehicles it's fun to play with. They could improve the gameplay by making sure it's not just taking weapon slots into account but how the unit performs as a whole to design some special mechanics for the units that'd otherwise be too bad to play with.",1667285065,1667285065,True,12,0,0.618451356887817383,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Если мех большой, толстый и имеет эффективные смертоносные пушки, то миссии проходятся довольно легко без каких либо замудренных стратегий. А ежели он маленький и хиленький то в такой ситуации приходится брать умением и стратегией, нанося внезапные удары и давая деру.
И говоря о [b]мехах[/b] - их тут много, также как и различного вооружения, снаряжения и пилотов. Всего представлено 3 вида мехов: [b]шагоходы[/b], [b]танки[/b] и [b]гравилеты[/b]. Как я говорил ранее, они могут быть любого размера и прочности. Их вооружение делится на 4 вида: [b]артиллерийское[/b], [b]лазерное[/b], [b]пулеметное[/b] и [b]снарядное[/b]. Каждый экземпляр оружия оружия варьируется внутри своего вида. На каждом мехе может стоять основное и дополнительное оружия любого доступного вида. На особенных мехах даже стоят автоматические турели! Также на каждом мехе может стоять одно из 4-рех видов снаряжение: [b]дымовые гранаты[/b], [b]эми-гранаты[/b], [b]стелс-поле[/b] и [b]разрушительная волновая установка[/b]. Открывается все это дело за [b]внутриигровые деньги[/b], зарабатываемые при успешном прохождении миссий [b]Кампании[/b] и [b]Фриланса[/b]. В каждой миссии нужно выполнить определенную цель, для открытия точек выхода, и по желанию выполнять однообразные для каждой миссии побочные цели. Множитель выплачиваемого гонорара зависит от того насколько сложно было проходить миссию. В [b]кампании[/b] это возможно понять только тогда, когда уже удалось пощупать один из доступных предварительных билдов (которых как правило представлено по 4 на большинство миссий). Во [b]фрилансе[/b] же можно настроить свой собственный билд, подобрав пилота, который напрямую влияет на сложность игры, а также меха, устанавливая на него любое доступное оружие и снаряжение.
[b]Багов[/b] и [b]вылетов[/b] за все время игры я не встретил. 
[b]Музыка[/b] в игре хорошая. Такой приятный синтвейв, задающий атмосферу мрачноватого гиперактивного будущего.

[b]Хорошая[/b] игра с в меру сложной кампанией (кроме уровней c F1 по F3, созданных какими-то лютыми трайхардами из сообщества), порой принуждающая к пересмотру стиля игры при игре за разные билды. А также позволяющая экспериментировать с различными билдами, значительно упрощая или усложняя прохождение миссий.

軽装高機動の機体の弱さもきつい。報酬にボーナスがあるとはいえ、弾速が全体的に速いので回避はできない。立ち回りとEMPか光学迷彩の活用をしても、そもそもの火力が低いので時間がかかる。ミスれば即死なので、連続したミッションでは使い物にならない。
結局重装甲重武装の機体でゴリ押しばかりで単調になる。

メカデザインや作品の雰囲気が好きそうだと思ったら買い。ゲームとしての面白さを求めているなら、10時間くらい遊べればいいなら買い、もっと長く遊ぶつもりならおすすめはしないです。",1661663049,1661663049,False,12,0,0.6698036789894104,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'm a big fan of twin-stick vehicle shooters and this one absolutely satisfies. The premise is really simple: It's the cyberpunk future (specifically Cassette Futurism flavor, go look it up) and humanity has spread across the stars. The authoritarian leader of Solo Nobre, an isolationist city on a backwater planet, has finally kicked the bucket. Your character is contacted by a mega-corp, SNC, to destroy as much as possible of the city's infrastructure (both military or otherwise), kill the high-ranking members of the 3 groups in the city that might pose a threat to their control, and then escape with a boatload of cash. In principle, this means being dropped into large levels with a general objective like ""shoot the important guy in a tank"" or ""knock out the generators near this base so our ships can blast it from orbit"". The magic of the game is the openness of each level. Do you pick a giant, armored mech and fight directly through legions of enemies to get to your objective? How about a small hover-tank to scoot around behind enemy defenses and blast them with poison gas launchers while their shields are down? No? How about a battle-suit with a cannon meant for artillery, active camo, and armor like paper plates with mad faces drawn on them? All are viable, if more or less difficult, tactics in this game.

In any vehicle shooter, the vehicles themselves are clearly the star. Brigador has 3 factions to pull from, all with varying types of colorful vehicles. The NEP are defectors from Solo Nobre's military, so they have lots of very minimalistic tanks or mechs with heavy armor and weapons. The Corvids are revolutionaries who have to make their vehicles from existing machines, bolting on engines and weapons and armor until they maaaaaybe will stand up in a fight; their vehicles tend to be of the glass cannon variety. Finally there's the Spacers, amoral raiders who usually live their entire lives in space (duh) and only come planet-side to steal resources or kill for fun. Their vehicles look like 60's moon buggies, almost-organic walkers, and weirder stuff. If you want to pilot a giant, floating face that shoots lasers from its eyes and projects weaponized sound waves from its mouth, these guys are for you.

In general, gameplay is a fun romp through a series of completely destrutable levels and huge armies. Challenging yourself to make more dangerous runs in less and less powerful vehicles is really the draw here. This, by the by, is encouraged by the game, as weaker vehicles and harder runs earn bigger payouts. In fact, if I could say anything bad about the game it's that once you complete the campaign, it feels kind of sandbox-y. You have to choose what runs to complete and with which vehicles, so if you get decision paralysis, this one is gonna get you. That said, get this little gem and enjoy the corporate-sanctioned war crimes.",1661540987,1661540987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Controls take a bit of getting used to and the UI isn't the best but give it an hour and you're running around the map stomping all over mech suits and blowing up tanks. 

Story/World/Atmosphere: If you want story/lore in your twin stick games this game has PLENTY, there's tons of pilots to unlock that are just a .jpg with text biographys for example on top of all the missions that have long descriptions. It's a dark bleak oppressive future and you're tasked with blowing shit up in it. The maps, lighting and sprites are all very gritty and paint a very good looking cyberpunk dystopia. The music is moody and that artist even went made songs for Stranger Things. The game is sprite based but this looks like the most crisp sharpest Starcraft-era game ever, you'll forget it's sprite based consistently. 

Gameplay: You get 3 types of vehicles. Mech, Tank, Anti-Grav vehicle(flying car basically). Each can be customized with different types of rockets, morters, chain guns, etc. They have different abilities, mobility, it's not super granular but its very accessible. You pick a map of which there are plenty, complete the objectives, get money, buy more weapons and vehicles and .jpgs to switch up your pilot. It's very arcade like where you just blow things up while trying to survive and your goal is *gasp* more to have fun than anything else.

When you're done with the campaign or you want to do something on your own, there's a free play mode where you can pick whatever mission you want with money(missions arent expensive and you get plenty of money) that have different objectives. Your pilot jpg gives you different payout amounts, as well as the type of vehicle you have. Squishier vehicles get more money compared to your beefcakes. 

Cons: Firing your weapons, unlike most twin sticks on pc or console where you either have a laser or a marker/cursor, this game is a hybrid. Theres a small triangle thats your cursor and there are 2 long arcs headlights that act as your laser sight. Losing sight of your cursor is constant as aiming far away your headlights will arc up to show how far they go, wether its enough to go over barricades or low enough to hit enemies mid range, the readability is not that good. You begin to learn everything by feel because the visual aid just isn't there, the arc lands at 5 meters, you know by feel the mortar will land at 7 meters and the rail gun will land at 4-5. It's not a huge problem but it leads to a learning curve that feels out of place because the game otherwise has an amazing tutorial and customizable UI to really ease you in. You can even slow the game down as much as you want with a setting. 

The objectives are these tiny TINY little icons that you cant make bigger(but i think you can change the colour) that are the edges of your screen and with how the artstyle is, it just gets lost or outright invisible and you have to move your camera around to find it. The maps aren't super big but I found myself constantly scanning the edge of my screen looking for this 1x1 pixel to tell me where the last cannon to blow up is. 

Final Thoughts: The artstyle, music and robot hotline miami gameplay gets a recommend from me. Whatever issues there are are pretty minor and theres mods you can screw around with to extend playtime. The sequel is in full development and looks to 'fix' everything about the 1st game while managing to look even better.

The game is gorgeous - it reminds me of old, isometric games such as Alien Shooter but in a much more crisp, modern feel, and the music used further strengthens the overall cyberpunk feel of the game.

The game has its own faults though - campaign feels sluggish at best until late game, and even then it still feels very restrictive since you can only select from 4 predetermined loadouts given for the stage. Night time maps make it hard to navigate your shots on enemies, and when surrounded its difficult to identify any alarming enemies due to its use of the same color as your weapon reticule.

Once you get through all the faults however, the game with no restrictions become a true joy to play, with no bars held back to cause mayhem with your weapon and vehicles, crushing enemies after enemies with crumbled building and structures lying behind the chaos you created - Bliss.

Questa è un po’ la sensazione che si ha globalmente giocando a Brigador: apparentemente c’è tutto (o quasi, a prescindere dall’assenza del multiplayer, ma quella è una scelta), eppure il risultato, seppure decisamente positivo, è inferiore alla somma delle componenti individuali. E tutto questo, nonostante la passione degli sviluppatori; gli aggiornamenti e le realizzazioni di nuovi contenuti sono state costanti nel corso degli anni, ma il risultato ottenuto è stato parziale.
...
Nonostante questo, Brigador è sicuramente un bel gioco che vale sicuramente il prezzo a cui è venduto. Magari non mi sento di raccomandarlo come gioco di riferimento, ma come alternativa è sicuramente un gioco validissimo.

     The graphics and music are pretty. My only nitpick is I think some terrain has inconsistent scaling. The lore is deep and riddled with war crimes and hyperviolence.

And finally, the biggest personal turn-off for me:
Jack Monahan, one of the primary devs of the game, was outed as a massive piece of shit a few years ago (racist, anti-semitic, homophobic/transphobic, etc.). Following the announcement, he issued the most basic ""oopsie-daisy"" 'apology' and left the dev team. 
Now, if this had been the end of it, I wouldn't be writing this review. Games are ultimately more than a one-man operation, and I would be content to let this lie had Stellar Jockeys not quietly brought him back aboard for the sequel. To this day, there has not been any formal acknowledgement on whether or not he has changed (quite frankly I doubt it), and it seems as if there never will be.

To conclude, I find the game fun, however that fun is somewhat hampered with this knowledge, and I can't in good faith recommend anyone purchase the game.

Нормальная — неплохая игра своего жанра. Сами судите по описанию, скриншотам и продолжительности. Игра, примерно, соответствует своему наполнению.

Хорошая — весьма неплохой представитель своего жанра. Многие могут найти тут «свой шедевр». Зачастую, игра приятно соответствует своему описанию и скриншотам.

It's important that you know that, because that's partially why the game flopped [at first]. It's a fantastic isometric mech-shooter, with possibly the most customisation I've seen in a game.

I'll start with.. the graphics, for once. As far as I can tell, the vehicles are 3D models that've been expertly converted into sprites, creating incredibly detailed models that don't look out-of-place in the art design of the surroundings. The lighting is really impressive too, considering how the game renders everything.

The gameplay is more strategic than it would appear. Every vehicle handles differently, and can be specced into different builds which ALSO affect how they handle. You'll generally find that your armour is thickest on the front, so being flanked is a real problem. Depending on whether your vehicle has legs, tracks or thrusters will affect how quickly you can rectify this, or whether you should have been more careful to begin with.

There is a frankly-ludicrous amount of weapons, vehicles and even pilots to play around with. Pilots have their own strengths and weaknesses to bear in mind, also.

The music in this game isn't necessarily my cup of tea, but I can acknowledge that it is VERY high quality. It's a strange mix of the electronic, synth-y music you might expect, and some more orchestral [though still very digital] influences, which will be more prominent in the quiet moments between shootouts.

Everything is destructible, and there are no ""collateral damage"" punishments to worry about, so the game is very liberating in that sense. It makes sense in the story, don't worry about it.

I can't recommend the game enough, it's very, very, very good.

I only have a few gripes, but they aren't necessarily the developer's fault. 
The default control scheme is 'screen-absolute' to satisfy those that bought the game, didn't look in the options, and refunded it, because they thought it was a twin-stick shooter. The intended control scheme is ""Relative"", which is more awkward at first, but more rewarding when you get good with it. As I mentioned before, the game has a directional damage system, so it's a very good idea to know where your rear is at all times, and tank controls gives you a higher degree of control over that.

I also find a lot of the ""lore"" for the pilots to be quite cringey. A bit ""lol randum"" and kinda preachy.

Brigador is a cyberpunk mech shooter with tank controls, set in a grim dark future and remote world. Your choice of customisation is seemingly simple but actually really nuanced. You have a choice of hull (mech, tank, or agrav - a hovertank), and each controls in their own way. Each mech has two weapon mounts plus a special ability; however, and obviously, not every mech can mount every gun. The worldbuilding is also splendid. There are only three factions which all provide their own mechs, tanks, and agravs, but that is plenty enough - each of them ooze personality from not only the external looks, but also from the way these vehicles play. This means that one moment you could be playing as a tank towering over even the apartments - which, upon closer inspection is actually several vans stacked on top of each other firing several heavy cannons, only to in your next run switch to a pint-sized walker which on one hand is using that same heavy cannon, except moving at the pace of a snail.  


The sandbox is similarly amazing - although the maps admittedly blur together after a while, it never feels like you are doing the same mission twice. This is also not a simple power-fantasy where you get in your invincible metal box with huge cannons and steamroll everything - some level of strategy is needed. This is where the destruction of in-game terrain is seamlessly blended into the game. So often in sandbox games destruction is treated as a gimmick - not here.

The music and sound of the cannons, gatlings, lasers and blasters are perfect and get you in the mood for some colletoral damage. 

Having said all that there are two things I do find frustrating. Firstly, when you die in a run of missions, you have to redo them all. I get that is the difficulty but what if this was an option, I really don't feel like trying a 25 mission run when i know one slip up will mean all the time wasted.  Secondly; the campaign is great for teaching you the game which you then are supposed to take to the freelance game where you can mish and mash vehicles, two weapons and a special action with a pilot to take on a huge array of missions and maps. The problem is, it is so easy to make something that is barely winnable. Yes yes in theory you should be able to do anything with every combo but still to me I would have preffered that unlocking a pilot means unlocking a build, a vehicle  weapon combo. 

I am never really good at too many choices in games, especially from the go nuts variety like this. While I do now many people would find my critique weird, how can total freedom to mish and mash be bad, for me it is a bit too much and would have preferred a system where pilots come with a premade build. Regardless of that, i do find that the concept os pilots as difficulty tracker is good, but with the huge amount of pilots I don't see the incriments, what are the tiers of difficulty? I get that precusor james is the most difficult but what are the levels we go through here?

Initially, this game is a lot of fun. Instructions on how to play are provided in a hand-on manner, making it easy to jump right in and learn as you play. On the surface, the game is pretty simple: wander around the map, blow things up, leave. Underneath that, there's a bit more complexity, such as different arcs for different weapons, some of which are even affected by the momentum of your vehicle, so you can fire over walls and other low obstacles. You got lasers, machine guns, cannons, even chemical based weapons, and a sub-woofer that just DELETES anything immediately in front of you.

Sounds fun, right? Cos it is.

Until you get further into the game and realise the devs were sadistic @#!$s.

As you progress through the campaign, the difficulty of the missions increases. Dramatically. You'll soon find yourself piloting weak, paper thin vehicles with pop guns taped to the side while a literal ARMY of stronger, more powerful machines descend upon your position like a swarm of angry, killer bees that just got told you stood on their queen. One mission even has you start with NO ammunition in your weapons and forces you to run through a gauntlet of kamikaze trucks to get to the other side of the map, where you can restock you ammo, only to find your weapons are average strength at best.

Or, if story (or what passes for story, in this game) isn't what you're after, you can play single missions with random objectives, on random maps, with random enemies, and a loadout of your choice. Everything from weapons to lore can be bought with money, which can quite easily enough be obtained by doing missions, either Campaign or Freelance, and the difficulty of the missions can be set by what pilot you choose.

So, why am I down voting this, you might ask? Because, unless all you want from this game is a sandbox time killer, with mindless blowing up of random enemies (and outright mass murder of innocent civilians), you're probably going to go from ""having a blast"" to ""beating your head against a brick wall"" very quickly. As the Campaign progresses, fun turns to frustration. Not a challenge, not a chore, but cold, hard, unadulterated frustration at the absolute FY of the mission designs. This is a MECH game, not a game of chess, or ninja assassins. You don't ""think your way through the problem"" when you're in an armoured tank with cannons. You blow #!@$ up and move on. Occasionally you hide behind cover that's actually bigger than you, or go around the back of your enemy for more damage to their backside. You don't flee at the first sign of being sighted and play ""cat and mouse"" with the whole enemy armada.

If all you want is a 20-40 minute time killer, of mindless explosions and machinery, this game excels.

To summarize the setting and plot, Brigador takes place on the planet of Novo Solo, in the city of Solo Nobre. Great leader is dead, Solo Nobre must fall. You take the role of a mercenary known as a Brigador, who has either accepted a lucrative contract, been blackmailed, or given an offer you can't refuse from the SNC. They want their colony back no matter what. so you're free to do whatever you have to in order to complete your objectives, and the best part? You can't be tried for war crimes in SNC controlled colonies, so feel free to commit as many as needed to succeed. 

For example; need to level a city block with fuel-air cluster munitions to take out a Commander? Go for it! Need to get to that orbital gun a couple of seconds faster? Go ahead, level that hospital with an audio kinetic pulse, that'll make a nice pathway for you. Whoops! I accidentally missed my mark and launched chemical weapons into a neighborhood! Oh wait, I got paid for everything that got eaten away by this highly corrosive gas? cool beans.

You have three factions as well with their own visually distinct pilots, mechs and tanks too that add a ton of personality and flavor to the game. 

Loyalists tend to have well balanced vehicles that focus more on armor coverage. Be sure to give the leviathan a spin too, nothing like driving a tank the size of a building. 

Pretty sure the corvids spend most of their time high on gas fumes and their equipment reflects that. It all looks like a junkyard on legs/wheels/whatever those crazy fucks think up of. It's all built without pilot or crew safety in mind. 

Spacers are pretty weird hedonistic space pirates and all their stuff is extremely high tech. Not to mention a lovely shade of red. 

Visual appearances aside the vehicles associated each faction have a very unique feel compared to one another and are entirely modular in terms of armaments and special munitions/ordnance, so once you get to free play experiment and find a mix that works well for you. Since we're on the subject, despite weapons being broken down into hardpoint sizes and a few separate clases (cannons, machine guns, artillery and lasers,) they all feel really diverse and have their own niche and use.

Only thing I really wish is that pilots had unique modifiers and traits to really diversify each game play experience. 

Lastly, the soundtrack is fantastic, and fits incredibly well.

All in all, it's a fantastically fun game. Give it a shot.

[b] The Premise: [/b] pilot mechs, tanks, grav-vehicles, motorbikes, delivery trucks, and even a small touring van around a myriad of grungy sci-fi environments,  gunning for objectives in single or multi-mission runs. Earn cash from causing mayhem in a completely destructible world, while fighting hordes of foes.

[b] The Game Play: [/b] as difficult or relaxed as you adjust the settings and your loadout to be. For a casual day of fun: Ultra-class tanks that can crush city blocks with ease. For a challenge: a plucky suit of power armor against towering mechs will test your mettle and tactical creativity. 

The loop of playing through missions to unlock more missions and means to finish them is steadily rewarding, with a minimal amount of grind. Guides abound online about how to raise tons of money fast in-game -no guilt necessary; more options means more fun to be had. I knew the game had me when I was thinking of thematic pilot-vehicle-weapon combos, especially when they proved to be particularly challenging. Spend as little as five minutes or at most an hour or so on the shortest and longest mission runs respectively -its all fun.

[b] What I Liked Most [/b] the lore of the world embedded throughout the game. Only a few text scrawls provide a  minimum of background before and after a few of the campaign missions. The bulk of the world building is in the descriptions of the pilots, vehicles, and weapons. These are masterfully done, making excellent use of different, distinct voices. Notice the  coarse and self-deprecating humor of Marvin Beck, compared to the sneering judgments of Cephei Chattfield. I took to the company website after listening to the audio book included, still hungry for more of the setting and characters that had been developed.

Cons/My gripes with the game:

-In order to get the best experience, you need to either have a good bright monitor or play this in a pitch black room. Most of the maps are dark and/or at night, so it can be difficult to see enemies or environmental hazards if your playing conditions aren't great. A simple fix would be a general brightness setting or a way to make maps permanently day, but until that happens, get used to turning your monitor brightness up, shutting some shades, or running into fuel refineries.

-Their is no way to change the color of your firing arcs. Primary is blue, secondary is red, and your cursor is purple: that's the way it is. There are options to change the color of the primary and secondary ammo bars, but not the arcs. I had trouble seeing the blue primary firing arc due to how dark/blue some of the maps are (especially when you destroy the substations). However, I could have missed the option due to the next issue:

-In settings, you can change the color of the UI, but there is no option (at least at time of writing) to revert the colors back to default. I goofed up some of my UI colors when I was trying to figure out if I could change the color of the firing arcs, so just a heads up if you start tweaking some of the UI colors: write down what the original value is or only change what you need to. It's odd though because in the other settings tabs the option to restore to defaults is there, but not in the UI color tab. I know the UI settings were just added in the last update, so maybe it will get added in the next update.


The root cause of most my issues stem from how dark the game is, which can be easily remedied by turning up the monitor brightness or playing at night/in the dark. Not ideal, but the game makes up for it.

I know it looks like I have a lot of complaints, but it really is a fun game and I highly recommend it. Brigador has a great soundtrack, a surprisingly good story for a relatively straightforward game, and it doesn't get grindy. I was going to do more of a description of the game play here, but instead, if you are thinking of getting the game, get it and experience the game firsthand. 

One last thing: change the controls to one of the relative control schemes. It might take a while to get used to, but it will make the game easier in the long run due to directional damage.",1646328293,1646328293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Brigador é um jogo de ação e tatico isometrico 2d, lembrando bastante os graficos de classicos como Fallout 1 e Command and Conquer Tiberium Sun,com cenarios totalmente destrutiveis e belos sprites. O jogo é simples de jogar mas dificil de pegar as manhas,pois apresenta uma variedade de veiculos e armas grandes. É lindo de ver,até mesmo a destruição e os destroços são maneiros de observar junto ao detalhe dos veiculos e o mundo ao redor.

O jogo tem um enredo,apesar de ser usado mais como pano de fundo,a Lore do jogo fica disponivel para leitura, alias até mesmo os pilotos, veiculos e até as armas tem algo para ler e contar mais sobre esse rico e vasto universo que Brigador tem a oferecer. É bem parecido com DOOM: ETERNAL,onde voce pode jogar e ligar o f**da-se pra historia e descer bala em tudo que se move,mas ela esta para aqueles que gostam de uma boa leitura. (Comentarei mais sobre o enredo no final da analise) 

A trilha sonora é otima e pega bastante as musicas eletronicas ou aquele clima de ação dos filmes dos anos 80/90, em um futuro sombrio onde voce não é o  mocinho  ou o  bandido da parada. 

O Gameplay é boa mas cada veiculo tem uma maneira certa de jogar,então é necessario ficar atento ou vai passar um tempo brigando com os controles....alguns Power-suits só podem virar até 180 graus,outros podem girar pelo eixo inteiro e assim por diante.  Os objetivos são variados mas o jogo te recompensa a fazer mais,como alem de cumprir os objetivos,causar o maximo de caos e destruição e dando a chance de ganhar uma grana a mais. 

O jogo pode se tornar dificil a medida que voce progride, sendo necessario um cuidado maior na hora de engajar os oponentes,inclusive tendo 3 tipos : Loyalist , Corvids e Spacers. 

- Os Loyalists são os militares fieis aos regime do Grande Lider, são profissionais e usam equipamentos tipicos de uma força militar bem equipada e organizada,indo desde infantaria a tanques, artilharias, Mechs e powersuits. Usam armamento tradicional com algumas armas a laser fruto de engenharia reversa da tecnologia dos Spacers. Eles tem como objetivo reagrupar e manter a ordem no planeta.

- Os Corvids são os rebeldes que lutam contra o regime,usam armas e veiculos improvisados/roubadas que em alguns casos até lembra veiculos de guerra improvisadas vistos em campos de batalha na Siria ou Ucrania, acoplando armamento em chassis de caminhões,tratores e criando mechs com partes soldadas,remendadas ou roubadas dos oponentes. 

- Os Spacers são humanos cuja a sociedade vive no espaço,seja em naves de guerra a estações espaciais e ODEIAM humanos que vivem em planetas,os chamando de ""comedores de sujeira"", são vistos como mercenarios ou psicoticos hedonistas com alta e avançada tecnologia aterrorizando o planeta e testando armas e equipamentos nos civis. Seus equipamentos lembram bastante veiculos de exploração espaciais a doideiras tiradas de alguma loucura scifi como o Zed Prime (KNEEL BEFORE ZED !!! ),fazem bastante uso de armas a Laser com raras excessões usando armamento balistico.

O jogo possui uma variedade de veiculos, desde os pequenos e ageis power-suits, motocicletas, blindados, Tanques, Veiculos flutuantes aos poderosos Mechs,cada um com suas vantagens e desvantagens,com cada facção tendo um estilo proprio para cada tipo de veiculo.

O jogo tambem apresenta o modo mercenario,onde podera escolher os pilotos,veiculos,armas e as missões que deseja executar. Cada piloto tem seu modificador e nivel de dificuldade,quanto mais dificil maior a recompensa, alem de fatores unicos....alguns pilotos apenas encaras Corvids,outros apenas inimigos surpresa e assim por diante. 

Antes de comentar sobre o enredo,o jogo de fato usa termos e girias da lingua portuguesa,seja a origem de portugal ou brasileira,então não estranhe se ver alguma coisa em PTBR ou PT-PT em meio ao texto em ingles. 

**ALERTA DE SPOILER ABAIXO** 

A muitos anos, no planeta chamado Novo Solo, era controlada por uma megacorporação de nome desconhecido,uma coloca de exploração onde os colonos eram tratados como escravos e explorados ao maximo,um certo dia,uma revolução explode e é liderada pelo NEP (Novo Exercito do Povo), expulsando a megacorporação e tomando o poder. 

O novo governo instaura um regime militar e controla com mãos de ferro as estações espaciais e o comercio/navegação para dentro ou fora do planeta,criando uma robusta rede de defesas orbitais e tambem reconstruindo o planeta apos a guerra civil para expulsar a megacorporação. O planeta apesar de ser controlado pelo seu libertador conhecido apenas como GRANDE LIDER (sem nome), é autoritario mas cuida de seu povo,fazendo que o planeta prospere e aos poucos constroi uma vida digna aos seus cidadãos, no entanto nem todos gostam do modo que a NEP controla tuda e assim surge um grupo anarco-sindicalista,conhecidos como Corvids (Ou corvinios,se for jogar em PTBR), um grupo rebelde que usa taticas de guerrilha para libertar o planeta em um futuro proximo...

20 apos o planeta ser libertado, em uma noite sombria na capital Solo Nobre, o Grande Lider morreu, ninguem sabe como ou quem matou, mas é nessa noite que a Megacorporação retorna usando uma empresa-fantoche conhecida como SNC (Solo Nobre Concern), contratando proxies e pilotos dentro do planeta para sabotar a infraestrutura e as defesas planetarias....é ai que voce entra. 

Voce é um traidor da causa (caso seja um Loyalist ou Corvid) ou um Spacer mercenario a serviço da SNC, alguns dos pilotos foram recrutados por serem a escoria,outros por terem sido traidos dentro de suas organizações e outros por pura ganancia ou foram chantageados a agir em nome da SNC...não importa o motivo, o jogador devera trair seu planeta natal e sabotar as facções locais para facilitar a invasão planetaria que a Mega Corporação em breve lançara, resgatando voce no processo e de quebra receber um pagamento o suficiente para viver confortavel na sede da mega corporação.

O jogo tera uma continuação chamada BRIGADOR KILLERS onde vamos nos vingar dos pilotos que trairam Solo Nobre mas no momento sem data de lançamento. 

Resumo : Vale super a pena comprar essa obra de arte, a OST,os graficos...tudo nesse jogo é agradavel. Se voce gosta da lore pode ate comprar o AudioBook vendido por aqui na Steam, acompanhando a saga de um dos pilotos jogaveis na campanha.

So what does this game entail, it is a action packed vehicle versus ai enemies on a map with total destruction of the environment possibilities, but it is not mindless, one needs tactics and carefully poking and luring the enemies to clear the objectives.

When stuff goes wrong it quickly turns into a mad scramble to try and get into the most optimal spot still available and move around the enemies so one can focus fire them down while not letting most of the enemies return fire on you. If all goes according to plan one lures the enemies on ones own terms into ambushes and clears them out peacemeal. 

So far love the setting, the controls are nice and responsive, the game runs like a charm and is fun. The isometric perspective kinda gives me the vibe of the old syndicate game but now using a vehicle.

The campaign showcases both the mechanics of the game and the lore behind it, the freelance mode allows infinite generation of maps and adversaries to take down. The game also has a massive amount of things one can unlock from pilots to vehicles to weapon systems to levels and so one can tool each freelance run to ones own preference and challenge level.

The modkit is also available for the game and via the discord of the game one can find quite some mods one can patch in to extend the amount of options and levels.

The art style, the music, the design of the mechs, the frantic mania of combat, all of these are really solid and on-point for this game. 

I think Brigador drops the ball hard in two spots that make its more frustrating than it should be though. Number 1 are the movement and aiming mechanics. The game looks a lot like a twin stick shooter, but it's most definitely not. Bullets and projectiles arc slightly in a height dimension that isn't obvious at the start and only gets more important as the game goes on. Once you master the concept of lobbing block-destroying energy orbs over huge security fences it starts to make sense and you can see why the designers made it that way, but it gets in the way of fun more often than its generated. The movement mechanics are somewhat easy to deal with via options settings, but still somewhat confusing and not really what you would expect from some vehicles.

Number 2 is the story mode. I think the over-arching story in the game is super interesting and the factions and personalities behind them are very well written, I just wish it was tied together better. Every mission feels disconnected to the previous one and there doesn't feel like any continuity or progression. The freelance mission mode is much better, but you still have to unlock them one at a time, which can be a frustrating bar to overcome, but I think suits the design of what they were going for better. It's certainly more fun to just hit the random button, load up a mission and smash stuff for 10 minutes.

It sounds like this is a negative review, but I do really think this is a fun experience, provided you know those two points going in. I'd love to see a Brigador 2, but troubled development at the studio doesn't leave me optimistic any time soon. If a sequel could bend more towards a twin-stick approach, make the missions be a little more story-driven, and keep everything else as-is, then it would be an instant classic.",1640284070,1640284070,True,7,0,0.528414666652679443,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game offers a campaign mode where you should play if you're starting this game, and it provides both a good experience when starting out and gives fair challenge throughout.

It is worth the full price because in freelance mode there are 126 vehicles, 40 unique weapons, 4 special vehicle abilities, 53 pilots, and 18 freelance missions.

3. Gameplay is solid, very arcade-action without too much time required per-sitting
4. The universe and storyline is actually pretty great. I am a sucker for scifi, though.

In short, I don't know how this game got made (how does an action-arcade game have such solid writing? How does a game where you only ever have 2 guns feel so deep? How can casual genocide for bonus cash feel so relaxing?), but good lord I am glad it did.",1639419849,1639419849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game didn't start out perfect, but now it is as close to perfection as anything in this genre can ever get.

Played it a good while, got impressed with the music and lore, but then life took me through other paths. Never thought of it as a great game, but I distinctly recall having enjoyed myself with it.

Of course, the Mandalore review came in, and so I installed it again. To my surprise, the game was now the Up-Armored edition. To my even bigger, very pleasant surprise, the game had been updated constantly ever since release, adding several new missions, a level editor, better graphics, and so on. So, I installed it and fired it up.

I became obsessed with it. I devoured the book, the soundtrack is now one of my most listened albums on Spotify, and didn't stop playing it until I 100% it. 

The game is not for everyone, that's for sure. While the game can certainly be frantic at times, this isn't an arcade game. Think of it as the isometric Mechwarrior game we all deserved. Mech and tank combat is reasonably realistic, with turning speeds, limited turret angles and locational armor. There is trajectory, penetration and projectile speed to consider for each shot, and ammo is limited, as well as your hitpoints. So, it's a really tactical game. Taking it slow is worth it, fleeing is valid, and hiding perfectly possible. All this, of course, while being drenched on an incredibly well-built world, which, regrettably, is pretty much another book inside the game. I say regrettably because I know most people won't have the patience to read through it, or perhaps won't savor it as much. Me, I'm a lore-head, so everything I read immersed me even more in the nocturnal, chaotic, and solitary world of Solo Nobre. 

An impressive game for a niche audience, with an incredible world behind it, and a really lasting impression. Very recommended, if only to support the devs :)",1637797752,1637797752,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And the game does not help that at all.

Brigador looks and sounds a lot like Hotline Miami. It's all neon pixels and thumping synthwave music.
With the opening statement of ""Great Leader is dead. Solo Nobre must fall"" as you stomp a few hundred civilians into thin red paste you'd think you're set for a face paced action shooter experience.

Lol no.
Brigador could more accurately be described as a Maneuver/Urban Warfare simulator.  

I won't waste time talking about the campaign. Frankly I got bored of it pretty fast and since your pigeonholed into certain loadouts it kinda sucks. Sure the loadouts change with each mission but I rarely liked any of them. They just don't fit my style. 

Freelance is where its at, hundreds of unlockable pilots who all have their own modifiers. Changing your starting difficulty, your reward bonuses, which enemy factions and what units you will face. Loads of vehicles too Mechs, tanks and ""agravs"" all with their own quirks and hardpoints. All set loose on very open ended semi-random missions to cause chaos.

What you'll notice right away is the loadouts with the highest rewards have the least armour and the smallest guns. Which is why I call Brigador a maneuver warfare sim. 
Once you realise the game doesn't want you to destroy every single building in sight and do all the possible objectives the game becomes a lot faster and a lot easier. Even in an Ultra class mech with the biggest guns available fully clearing a mission is hard and very time consuming. 
The game wants you to play fast and aggressive but not stupid, you're supposed to move through a level with deliberate targets in mind. Strike from the flanks, engage quick and disengage faster. Always be moving. Never let the enemy see your backside. 

Instead of conveying this rather essential core concept of manuvere warfare the game will instead spend the first 10 missions beating you over the head with insultingly simple tutorials. Avoid scouts, things that explode will hurt you, break walls, blah blah blah. 
The game has such a focus on letting you destroy everything in sight that its very understandable how an average player would assume that mass destruction is the goal of the game.
Rather than a bonus or something to be done tactically. 
Something that I really could have used a tutorial on is that firing a mortar is loud, but the impact of your shells are a helluva lot louder. 

Also Brigador devs we need to talk.
Why are your default controls so lame? 
For whatever reason the default control scheme does not allow you to rotate your turret & legs/treads separate from each other. Instead you move ""screen absolute"" with a fixed facing like a twin stick shooter. 

Also also. Brigador devs, again.
Why in the Sam Hill are your weapon stats so useless?
Don't tell me a gun is ""loud"" tell me from E X A C T L Y how far away my shots can be heard.
Don't tell me its got 5 stars of damage. Tell me E X A C T L Y how much damage I'll do per shot. If it fires more than one shot per salvo tell me how much damage each pellet will do and how many pellets there will be.
ESPECIALLY if you're going to give me EXACT stats for how much armor and shield my enemies have. 

The first issue I admit is minor, you can just change the controls after all.
But the stats are exceedingly frustrating. If I want to make a build I want to be absolutely sure of what my ranges, rate of fire, and expected damage out put will be. I don't know why video games keep withholding information about weapon stats or using nonsense arbitrary systems to describe their stats.
Games have been assigning exact numerical values to items since fucking CHESS. It should not be some cosmic mystery that giving players detailed information leads to a better experience. 

Ultimately, I really like whats here. Anyone whose seen me play Mechwarrior knows how much I love games that focus on movement and positioning. 
I just feel Brigador's design is very misguided and will probably lead to a lot of players assuming the game is something its not. I know a lot of people haven't finished most of the campaign, probably because the game is very different than what they expect.
When someone like Mandalore says ""the game hard, and has lots of action"" they probably expect another Hotline Miami. Not something as geniunely unique and thoughtful as Brigador.",1635710446,1635710988,True,105,3,0.862833201885223389,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The view distance was also something I struggled with. I would have gladly taken a suboptimal mech if it allowed me to see further. For a loud approach this isn't an issue, but for stealth I was always wishing to see just a little bit further into the distance.

The thing that bothered me most though was the progression. You just earn money too fast, especially if you can sneak around in a tuk tuk. That's not to say that I ran out of things to buy, just that I got all the stuff I wanted really fast, and was left buying the other stuff because I could. I never felt the need to play higher difficulties or longer missions, which was a little disappointing.

Pilot some sort of mech through a level while destroying $hit.

Brigador is divided into 3 main sections: Campaign, Freelance, and Acquisitions. The campaign features 51 levels. The early part of the campaign is a tutorial with your mech selected for you. Later, you get a choice of 4 different vehicles for each mission. You get money for each mission you finish based on the vehicle you selected. Choose lemony vehicles for larger monetary rewards. Acquisitions allows you to spend money buying mech types, weapons, freelance maps, lore, etc. The mechs, weapons, etc are for freelance play. Freelance lets you load into a map with a personally customizable mech from mechs/weapons that you've unlocked. Levels typically require you to destroy a certain percentage of enemies or destroy specific enemies/buildings and then you're free to go to the level exit. If you die, you get very little money and are then free to retry or resign and try out a different vehicle.

Brigador starts off well enough but has too many issues.

This is extremely repetitive. Despite the huge variety of mechs and slight change in mission types/locations/etc, every mission feels pretty much the same and plays out pretty much the same. There are a few enemy types that stand out and you'll learn, but despite there being 3 factions and multiple types of each vehicle for each faction, they all pretty much blend together. Blow up the same looking/acting vehicles and buildings on every level. The campaign is 51 levels long. The story descriptions for each level are mostly pointless. I was already tired of the campaign by halfway through it but finished it for the sake of finishing it. It felt like a chore.

Some of the mechs are incredibly cumbersome and annoying to use as they don't automatically turn their bodies to line up with where you're aiming. You have to manually do this.

Then there's the aiming. Each mech has a blue line and a pink line extending out from it showing your primary/secondary aiming points. These don't line up so you can be hitting something with your primary but missing with your secondary and vice versa. Sometimes you'll be aimed perfectly on enemies and still be missing them somehow. Especially annoying are hover vehicles which you don't aim directly at to hit them, but aim at the shadows well below them to hit.

Killing enemies sometimes results in shields/ammo popping out. These vanish after a little bit if you don't pick them up. Sometimes they stick around for 5-10 seconds max, other times they'll be there 30-60 seconds after you killed whatever it was. I have absolutely no idea what causes the huge disparity between whether shield/ammo pickups stick around for a large amount of time or seemingly disappear seconds after they showed up. That said, it's extremely annoying when they disappear right in front of you as you're going to get them.

The majority of deaths, if not the vast majority of them will come from insta or near insta deaths. Some buildings explode when shot or walked into causing a huge amount of damage or outright killing you if you're next to them. There are plenty of nondescript buildings that explode. Even after the 51 campaign levels, there were still things I weren't sure if they were going to explode or not. So you have to spend  time avoiding this nonsense, shooting them to test it out, or just going by them and hoping something doesn't cause one to explode. I'm not a game designer, but objects that explode, especially if they're essentially a game over, should stand out and be obvious to your player.

Aside from exploding buildings, the other main way you'll die is from the occasional level with large mortar enemies who can shoot them from a mile off and they come down in a small area in clusters of 10-15. If you happen to be in that area, you're pretty much fucked.

The last 10-15 levels of the campaign are mostly about zerg swarms coming at you. Occasionally these will kill you, especially since it's incredibly easy to lose sight of your aiming points as they blend in with the swarm/background. Also notable is that I don't believe weapons have a maximum range. If you're shooting at zerg swarms, your rounds can go to the whole other side of the level and aggro enemies on the other side of the map, further adding to the swarm.

Ooooo, I almost forget my favorite part of this. Do you love getting stuck on random $hit while playing games? Then you're going to love this game. Every enemy you kill leaves behind an incredibly hard to see husk that takes your mech forever to get through and fully destroy. So when swarms of enemies come at you and you're blowing them up around you and trying to dodge, you will repeatedly get stuck on $hit. Then add in the plethora of buildings/walls that all blend together and if the smallest pixel of them is touching the smallest pixel of your mech causes you to get stuck on them as well. It's incredibly aggravating.

It's obvious that a lot of love went into Brigador going through the massive amount of intel, lore, etc in the game. Unfortunately love doesn't equal quality. Brigador is mostly a mindless mediocre mech shooter.",1634398243,1634480039,False,7,0,0.494631588459014893,0,True,False,False,False,,,

조종할 수 있는 장비 숫자가 많다. 매크나 자동차, 탱크, 심지어 소형로봇과 민간인까지 가능하다.
조종사도 바꿀 수 있다. 조종사에 따라 게임의 난이도와 보너스 기타 추가적인 특징들이 바뀐다.
반면에 커스터마이징 할 수 있는게 무기랑 보조옵션뿐으로 이거때문에 호불호가 갈릴 수 있다.

나는 이 게임을 메크워리어로 보고 구입했기때문에 썩 마음에 들지는 않더라.
매크들이 멋있지 않고 건물이나 지형지물은 그게 그거고 탑다운 슈터형식에 커스터마이징 할 수 있는게 별로 없었기때문에 초반에는 재미없다고 생각하고 플레이 했다. 내가 좋아할 이유가 별로 없거든...

하지만! 그럼에도 불구하고 내가 거의 5시간 넘게 플레이했다. 다른 게임 하다가 잠깐잠깐씩 이걸 플레이 한걸 생각하면 아주 많이 플레이한거다. 재미있었다. 내가 좋아할 이유가 별로 없는데 이정도로 플레이 할 정도로 재미 있었다.

그러기에 추천한다. 물론 이걸 메크워리어나 아머드코어로 보고 사겠다면 말려야겠지만.

However for the warcriminal inside you there stuff like cancer ray, toxic waste barrel launcher, ultra sound pulse and many more. 

Ingenious approach to difficulty. You pilot and vehicle combo act as a  difficulty meter. Some pilots spawn entire armadas because they are a known war criminal while others fight against infantry and few dirt bikes.
The more powerful your vehicle the less payout you have in the end. So playing with dinky tuk-tuk truck while facing entire map swarm of enemies is quite a ride.

I do say this lightly. Brigador itself is such a well crafted and thought out experience of a game, every aspect I enjoyed. 

The lore of this game is what kept me hooked. The setting, which has also earned a spot in my top favorite sci fi settings, is very very unique yet digestible in it's own right. It's visible instantly with the stunning mech design and aesthetics of this world. I became obsessed with it, each pilot and intel section a reason to push forward. As I began to reach the endgame, I picked up the audiobook, which is also A VERY good companion to the game itself.

Even without the setting (which to my personal taste is what draws me into games first) the gameplay is absolutely solid. It's real time strategy, and action wrapped into one. The vehicles and pilots you choose determine your style of play, and all are fun. Some are more harder than others, but you never have to be locked into one way of handling a situation outside of the tutorial. Though you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you never try to take a weak vehicle into combat, something that's nimble but dies faster so you have to learn enemy patrols and strategize hitting your targets and picking fights.

Most of the games end goal revolves around unlocking a variety of weapons, mechs, and pilots for freelance mode, on top of lore tidbits and operations. I thought that wouldn't be for me, in most games with similar concepts I just think ""is there a money glitch"" or ""Why can't I just have it now?"" - not with brigador. For some reason, maybe just in me, something clicked. I reveled in the challenge of using faster, weaker mechs and insane pilots for higher payouts. It activated a completionist instinct which has yet to cull on the harder achievements.

This game in particular absolutely deserves your patronage. It is excellent, and even now criminally underrated. I look forward to Brigador Killers, and it's companion book with GREAT anticipation. Aquire Brigador.",1631258294,1631258294,True,10,0,0.624266445636749268,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I should note that in the locked thread I said in a non accusatory manner that a poster put into the game should be removed as it looked extremely stupid and ugly due to using the infamous thin line style, which is heavily associated with the regressive left due to popularity with said extremists. At worse I said they should remove it as it makes them look bad.

The devs have so far ignored my unban requests.

Beyond the line break is what I wrote in the now deleted post that got purged along with everything else when they unfairly banned me for asking a mere question in the unrelated thread I created:

[b]Brigador[/b] is an old-school isometric [b]Jungle Strike[/b]-style mech-combat-simulation arcade with decent 2D artwork and appealing retrowave OST.

But at its core, it is still an early-access game that strives to achieve excellency but fails miserably at every possible step.

There is no variety to the missions whatsoever - every single operation goes like this: get in the mech, explore the map (randomly generated in the freelance mode, uninspiringly slapped together in the campaign mode), destroy [i]N[/i] something (enemy officers, buildings, etc.). 
The shooting gets stale pretty quick, especially considering the horrible control scheme with the body rotation being nigh impossible when operating wheels-based vehicles (also, there is no gamepad support), unreliable aiming (e.g. long-range laser weapons), and an ultimately flawed difficulty curve - at later stages of the campaign ([i]D[/i]-levels onward, to be meticulous) the combat intensity increases: not thanks to the introduction of new advanced enemies but rather via taking away all the good mechs at your disposal - the ones you are getting after that stage are absolute jalopies (save for the [spoiler]Zed Prime[/spoiler] model). 
The increased difficulty curve leaves the player only one option to beat the longer maps - the tedious hit-and-run approach.

The story fluff is presented via graphomaniac mission briefings that became a chore to read after around an hour.

The final mission is bizarrely anticlimactic.

The freelance mode brings nothing to the table - all same weapons, all same mechs, the same repetitive 9-to-5-grind-style gameplay.

 There are lots of pilots to choose from but they only really affect rewards and difficulty.

Well written, well thought out, consistently bouncing between dark humour and the tragedy of war. After the weapons I unlocked this just for the pleasure of reading it.

 I have to mention the sound too. The music is fantastic, great for setting the pace. The sound effects of your mech stomping about a city, the gunfire sounds, the way that the AI reacts to the noise you make make this a very immersive experience.

I had some fun with it, didn't think it was all that special. But then I listened to the book, read some lore, and watched a great youtube video reviewing it.

Геймплей игры прост и даже отупляющ. Несмотря на большой арсенал мехов и вооружения, миссии кампании и свободной игры сводятся к дави-стреляй. И как это? Очень даже хорошо. Процесс и оформление выполнены просто прекрасно – все работает на то, чтобы тебе не захотелось останавливаться, от бытия машиной уничтожения. Звуки музыка, антураж и сеттинг – садись в мех и воюй. Однако, для меня у игры есть слабости. Малая – мусорный дизайн техники. Это не плохо, это просто своеобразно, когда несмотря на разные фракции, вся техника выглядит собранной на помойке. Да, это обусловлено, но глазу от этого не легче. Более серьезным минусом я считаю жуткое однообразие миссий – геймдизайн в кампанию просто не завезли. И самая главное – просто преступление в таком сеттинге и с такой проработкой лора, вообще забить на какой-либо связный сюжет.
Не шедевр, но окунуться и насладиться однозначно стоит.

The only con I can think of is that controller could be a little bit better in some cases:
- vehicles front/back shouldn't affect turbo,
- stomp either lacks more 'boom effect' or should stop the movement for shorter time.

Chilled me to the bone man, felt like some sort of holy reckoning was happening. Lord knows how many horns those scrapper Corvids hooked up to one button, but all hell broke loose as soon as it was sounded. I started to rush on inside as it opened fire, steel rain slicing through whoever was there. A couple to my right got shredded, but I kept runnin'. A squad of Mogs, those wimpy lil' things always keepin' the peace came stompin' through a wall to fight whatever that Corvid junkyard was. A couple laser blasts blew threw their shields and a whole lotta bullets made the pilots connoisseurs of swiss cheese. I got inside, slid under a desk, and watched with my heart poundin' in my chest. Across the street, a couple big walkers, Touros or whatever the regime calls 'em, crashed through a building. They could've given the Corvids a run for their money with their cannons, or at least cause it to run away; but the mobile heap of trash had other ideas. A couple shells battered against the shields, it's shrapnel hitting the nearby building and whatever civilians lookin' on in awe. Didn't matter though, as the top turret, forged out a couple cars and a big ol' generator swiveled towards those two mechs. In a blink of an eye, those walkers and whatever buildings were behind them were flattened. An overwhelmin' sounds echoed throughout the street, blowing me away mentally and giving me tinnitus for weeks. I survived that helluva fight, but I've always kept an eye above the rooftops ever since."" - John Poltop, on his night out at Lannois.

     Brigador is a top down tactical mech game, which basically means that you pilot a mech (or a tank, or an anti-gravity speeder) and blow up certain objectives. It takes place in Solo Nobre, a colony that was founded by the SNC to be a space banana republic. As all banana republics do, it got overthrown by a mysterious Great Leader and his regime. However, now that Great Leader just died, the SNC is enacting its great plan: to hire mercs, called Brigadors, to strike at ammo depots, orbital guns preventing shuttle landings, comms stations, power generators, and the garrison of whatever faction controlling the district, all over the course of a night.
     Gameplay wise, you spawn, destroy, and leave. Make sure to enable tank controls, since that's the original way the game is meant to be played, and directional damage bonuses can screw you over when you're fighting the controls. Brigador's missions, while almost always the same, are always fun, due to the nature of it. Sneaking up behind an enemy to blast them from the rear, dodging between buildings being shredded by enemy fire (everything in this game is destructible, it's a wonderful canvas of carnage), trying to eliminate your foes as efficiently as possible and picking up the ammo dropped to do it again. My only criticism is that the downtime between one fight and the next can be a bit long, but there's usually a couple goons that you can tango with while walking (or driving, or floating).
     An average freelance mission goes as follows. First, select a pilot, who have different difficulties, and sometimes extra quirks attached to them. Next your ride. There's a wide variety of mechs, tanks, and speeders, all with their own stats, designs, and difficulties. Notable favorites are the van on treads, the massive looming citadel of doom, the giant floating head, and the lovable Touro (it's the one on the cover of the game). Then select your weapons, of which there are a couple different types, but are all glorious. Whether it be artillery, ballistic, lasers, or whatever else, there's a combination for any idea. Finally your special weapon, like smoke grenades or an audio-kinetic pulse that is canonically a warcrime. After that quick process is over you select your mission, which can range from one simple district (level) to the entirety of the game. Do the objectives, blow up buildings (and civilians) to get extra money, and cash out. The best part is that depending on what you choose, you get higher and higher payouts to spend to unlock lore, vehicles, pilots, weapons, special weapons, intel, and missions to play. Controlling a dinky van that dies in a stiff breeze during the longest mission of the game piloted by a max difficulty pilot is hard, sure. But when you do complete it, that payout you receive is divine.
     The graphics are fantastic, with the terrain as all pixel art and the vehicles given the DKC treatment. The landscapes are varied, from cyberpunk cities, to backwoods slums, to gated communities, to necropolises filled with graves, to a mix or something else entirely. The music is also very good. Composed by Makeup and Vanity Set, it makes Brigador feel as if you're playing an electronic-synthwave-retro-whatever album; not unlike how Doom feels.
     The lore is also great. You piece together the wonderfully-detailed world of Solo Nobre through descriptions of everything you unlock, and it's all written from the perspective of characters in the world. There are three main factions you face. The NEP/loyalists are the remnants of Great Leader's regime, practical, efficient, and militaristic. Then you have the rebel anarcho-syndicalist Corvids, whose vehicles can best be described as ""transformer Detroit."" Finally the Spacers, rich raiders whose vehicles are aerodynamic, fast, and weird looking.
     To sum it all up, Brigador is wonderfully fun to play, and near-perfect in its execution. If I were to have any complaints, it would be to ask for more pilots to have weird quirks (i.e. a pilot who reverses faster because they're cowardly or something), and for there to be a bit less downtime between fights.",1627823099,1649644805,True,9,0,0.594710350036621094,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Game-play, graphics, sounds, its all just fantastic. Lets start with the game-play.

You pilot a mech around, although there are also plenty of tanks and anti-gravity vehicles as well, usually with two weapons + an equipment, such as camouflage or smoke screens. In campaign this is preset, usually giving you 4 pilots with their preset vehicles to choose from, and this lets you get a good feel for vehicles and weapons you enjoy, and let you be more direct for choosing what to unlock in free-play. The campaign is interesting and while you don't need to read every single line of text or dialogue, the lore behind the world is interesting. Lore entries are also written by characters in game, pilots you can unlock in free-play, and gives you insights from certain points of view on the story if that's your thing. The scapes of Solo Nobre all look great, from the city centers to the more rural areas, and the art style is consistent through everywhere. Nothing looks out of place, and it really helps to build a cohesive world. The vehicles all look great as well, with 3 factions to choose from, Loyalists, Corvids, and Spacers. Spacers are personally my favorite, but they all look great, and the weapons sound great too. My favorite combo so far is the Broodmare Spacer Mech equipped with the Thunderclap and Zeus laser weapons. Even though they are lasers, they still sound really satisfying to use, as do many weapons.

Speaking of sound, the music in this game is just amazing, so much so it's one of the few games I bought the soundtrack for. While there are some songs I prefer more than others, I definitely wouldn't say any of them are bad. My only real complaint audio wise is sometimes the game will transition from a really upbeat track during your rampage to a more low key, foreboding track, which while the track isn't bad, it does feel slightly out of place given the track that played before it. As I mentioned earlier as well, the weapons sound just excellent and crisp, even the lasers sound like they have some punch to them. The heavier railguns that just demolish everything you point at are a joy to use, and it's only some of the smaller caliber weapons that sound dinky, which does make sense given the magnitude of physical size difference some of these weapons share.

This game is a real joy and I hope Brigador Killers does come out. I only have about 12 hours at time of writing but I do plan to play and stream this game a lot more. It's just so good, and for $19.99 it's honestly worth the price. Check it out, and leave a review if you do. :)",1626642033,1626642033,True,9,0,0.605330169200897217,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 * The dev's specifically made weapons difficult to aim, in a 3d way, in a 2d viewing plane, which makes shooting often ambiguous. I say this having completed the campaign as every offered mech except on 3 of the final missions.

* Compounding that is that a weapon may impact a building unexpectedly, or your mech may tangle its footing up on concrete or debris that looks similar to the rest of the ground. 

 * The game is designed around using your understanding of line-of-sight, weapon noise, and destructible terrain to bend battles towards your favor; but the harder missions make this nigh impossible; in part because the setups they allow you to use are loud, clunky, and often slow.

 * The pacing of the game, where secondary objectives often require you to backtrack back and forth over a map with a slow vehicle is obnoxious.

Most missions feel pretty similar, so its usually not something to play more than a few hours of in one sitting, but that's fine honestly. Not every game needs to be something you spend all day doing, and after a little break, I always get the itch to come back.

Also, the devs have continued to update and support this game despite the low initial sales, which is commendable, and they just released an update that mixes up enemy spawns and increases gameplay variety, which helps a great deal to alleviate the issue of missions feeling repetitive.

I later found out after running a DDU and reinstalling fresh drivers for my GPU that this was entirely on AMD's fault and had nothing to do with Brigador.

I got a lot of help on the discord by passionate fans and modders, and any game dev that fosters such a helpful and passionate fanbase means they are clearly doing things right.

Not to mention Boss Tweed comment on this review trying to help me fix an issue when i barely provided any info shows how much the devs clearly care about their community and players.

So yea, i will update this review once i am able to find some time to play it now that i can, for now i recommend the developers (and probably game too as for what i've seen its great).


Original post
Crash the moment you try to start a mission, Tried updating drivers and doing a bunch of things recommended by other users on the community forums.

It worked once and i've tried about 60 times to get it to work with different combinations of compatibility and launch parameters.

Emp grenades give you a nice panic button or a way to set ambushes. stealth field lets you turn invisible for a brief period of time allowing you to sneak past someone, sneak behind someone (more damage from behind), or make a quick escape.

Definitely a game first, not an 'experience'. Narrative is minimal and character interactions are nonexistant. Lore is captivating, but inherently supplementary. Play the campaign to learn the mechanics, try various loadouts, and challenge your completionism. Play freelance mode to tackle semi-random missions and unlock the game's full loadout options.

Playstyle (and difficulty) dramatically varies by vehicle and loadout. Play a heavily-shielded two-story junkyard to turn entire neighborhoods into parking lots. Play an armed forklift to strike from the shadows and run from anything resembling a fair fight. Play an invisible UFO that destroys all vital infrastructure and runs. Play a bulldozer whose strongest weapon is ramming things. Play the smallest possible thing that can level a neighborhood in one shot. The worse your vehicle is, the more you get paid for using it.

Recommend using relative controls (""tank controls"") for mechs/tanks and screen absolute controls (""hold left to go left"") for agravs. Neither mechs nor tanks are designed for screen absolute, and you don't want to accidentally expose a tank's rear armor under fire.

Now that the general, referred to as Great Leader, has died, they want you to cause as much chaos as possible so that they can step back in and reassert control.

You go through several smaller independent missions, so it is well playable even if you have only 30 min at a time to play. In later levels it does require some skill to succeed, so it is not a casual game in the classical sense.

There is a lot of variety in the gameplay, because the different vehicles and vehicle classes (mechs, tanks, anti-gravs) you control play very differently, especially given the many different weapon types (machine guns, cannons, lasers, artillery, chemical launchers, ..). 

This allows for many different approaches to a level, from the Rambo approach (gatling guns blazing), the Bond approach (go in with stealth), the race car approach (speed by enemies to take out strategic targets) or the sniper approach (artillery, long range lasers). 

Needless to say, you should go for the Rambo approach whenever possible.

Even different machine guns feel differently, e.g., due to higher calibre or higher rate of fire. It is just awesome to rip apart hordes of smaller enemies with two large gatling guns. The physics look cool when the bullets pepper the environment behind the ashes of your former enemies.

The soundtrack and look is great. Love 80s synth stuff.

I think the only downside in the campaign was that in the later levels, the available vehicles are somewhat limited. They all have some long range AOE weapon, which does not really allow for the Rambo approach.",1623789222,1623789222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Из того чего к сожалению нет, нет озвучки. Ну и недостатков явных не нашел, кроме того что игра глаза утомляет(устал за два часа, что довольно странно) Музыка весьма так себе, скорее бы подошла игре вроде Neon Drive.

For gameplay, it's responsive, tactical vehicular combat, rewarding you for smart placement of shots while at the lower difficulties - which are, unusually for this sort of thing, decided by which character you play as - being forgiving enough that a few minor mistakes won't completely mess up your run, and if you do screw up badly enough to die, the game's coded well enough that you don't even need to wait 2 seconds for it to load and you can just get back in there instead of ruminating. And I mean it when I say this game is well coded - it has started chugging on me, but only once or twice for about a second a time, and runs as smooth as a baby's bottom otherwise, which is phenomenally good for the mediocre laptop I own.

Buy this game. You will not regret it. (And buy the soundtrack too, it's phenomenal.)

mettez un ""utile"" ou ""rigolo"" svp ou une petite récompense?[/code] 

Brigador est un vieux jeu mais comme il m'éclate et que les développeurs continuent à le mettre à jour, je me suis dis que j'allais écrire un petit avis vite fait.

Jeu de...heu, ha, oui, jeu de destruction d'environnements dans lequel vous conduisez une machine (mecha, tank ou hover-car) qui, sous contrat, doit remplir  certains objectifs, principalement de la destruction d'assets stratégiques: tour de communications, dépôts,générateurs,...

Le plus du jeu étant que vous avez à votre disposition tout un arsenal violent, allant de la mitrailleuse, aux missiles téléguidés, combinés à des skills, telles que : mur de fumée, EMP, lance-flames, …  y a vraiment de quoi s'amuser pendant des heures, d'autant que le jeu n'est pas facile, il faut souvent jouer de discretion (oui oui), pour se mettre dans une position favorable avant de balancer la sauce. Un jeu plus tactique qu'il n'y parait.

Si pour la plupart, la campagne ne présente pas grand intérêt, je ne suis pas d'accord, les missions sont progressives en terme de difficulté et expliquent relativement correctement les différents concepts du jeu (et il y en a une tonne) : les contrôles, les skills, le blindage, les alertes, la destruction, les différents types de munitions,… le jeu n'est pas une simulation pour autant mais est riche de plein de choses qui donnent envie de les découvrir. 40 missions sont disponibles. Avec une histoire brièvement expliquée mais relativement intéressante.

L'argent gagné en fin de mission sert à débloquer de nouveaux pilotes, de nouvelles missions, des nouveaux jouets, du lore, tout est déblocable et vous en avez pour un petit moment si vous voulez tout débloquer.

Le coeur du jeu étant les contrats en freelance: des cartes aléatoires, énormes, avec une bonne quantité d'ennemis pour bien vous mettre la pression. Jeu difficile mais qui pousse à tester différentes combinaisons pour découvrir laquelle correspond le mieux à la mission que vous souhaitez accomplir, c'est vraiment fun. Ajoutez à cela une bande-son du tonnerre, quoiqu'un poil répétitive (electro-synthwave), un style graphique relativement simple mais coloré et vous avez un jeu dans lequel j'apprécie de rester.

Puis, je l'ai pas dis mais la grande force du jeu reste sa destruction : tout est destructible, tuable et rayable. C'est simple, satisfaisant et dangereux ( piétiner une station essence et vous le regretterez) . Une couverture? l'ennemi la détruit en 10 secondes. Vous voulez faire le tour? Foncez simplement dans le tas, ça fonctionne aussi. C'est moins rapide et plutôt dangereux mais quelle satisfaction.

L'interface, et certains détails montrent un manque de moyens, les contrôles font débat mais on s'y fait, passez bien par le tuto et ça devrait rouler tout seul.

Puis je salue la dévotion des développeurs envers leur produit, mis à jour il y a quelques jours à peine, nous seulement le jeu est rempli de contenu mais en plus, vous pouvez faire vos propres cartes ou télécharger celles des autres.

A campanha dura bastante, tem uma boa quantidade de missões e há bastante variedade nos pilotos, veículos e armas que irá usar ao decorrer delas.
Além disso, existe um modo Freelance, no qual você utiliza o seu dinheiro para contratar pilotos, comprar veículos e armas e completar séries de missões levemente randomizadas. Há muita coisa para desbloquear, o conteúdo desse jogo é gigante. Também há um mod kit e editor de missões.

Use relative controls, for everything. The soundtrack is also *chef's kiss* perfect.

Your main objective as a brigador is to cause as much mayhem and destruction (to strategic and civilian targets alike) so your employers can invade and retake their former colony on the planet of Solo Novo. You operate as an inhabitant of Solo Nobre, its capital city.

In the campaign, each mission gives you a small selection of pilots and their vehicles to play with to help you get used to the controls and weapons of each vehicle. There are mechs, tanks and anti-gravity vehicles, each class ranging from small powersuits to hulking battlemechs, tuk-tuks to gargantuan tanks and hoverbikes to hovertanks. You have hull/armour and shields for defence (shields can be replenished on killing enemies - armour cannot). Furthermore, each vehicle has a 'special' ability and a defensive ability- mechs stomp, tanks boost, a-gravs ground pound. Depending on the vehicle and pilot, you can also use smoke grenades, emp grenades or a sonic boom to defend yourself if you start feeling vulnerable. The tutorial is great too, drip feeding you mechanics to get you used to it, no information overload like other games sometimes do.

Each comes with equally diverse armament, including lasers, cannons, railguns, high caliber machine guns, grenade launchers... the list goes on. Each weapon will be effective against armour or shields, some weapons penetrate through buildings, etc... You can refill your ammo from a limited supply at depots in each district. Also, every building is destructible.

The campaign is an appetiser though - freelance operations are your main course. They are like campaign missions with multiple stages, and you must complete your objectives and make it to the end without dying. Can get quite challenging.

With the money you earn in the campaign, you can unlock various vehicles, weapons and pilots (as well as snippets of lore and information about vehicles and locations, and the culture of Solo Nobre if you're into that sort of thing).

Don't be fooled, however. This game is definitely a power fantasy, but it's not easy - some missions are very straightforward, others will test you, and you'll have to adapt your stragegy depending on the enemies present, your vehicle and its loadout.

Playing as a little mech in a daunting map feeling like a sneaky peaky death dealer.  Playing as a juggernaught and laying waste to city blocks.  It's a really neat little game to visit.

Movement from one area to another is clunky and slow with obstacles that impede you constantly. The first time you think cool, I get to blow stuff up and crush this obstacle. Now multiply that by 15 more times in the same mission and you swear if you run into one more barricade you are gonna go out to the garage and drink anti-freeze. Their is garbage everywhere that slows the whole pace of the game down and makes you feel like your are trudging through 3 feet of snow in every mission. Next it was the controls. This was special. They actually vary the movement controls from tank to tank so that some tanks move like you would expect and other tanks you will spend a long time driving into walls zigzagging all over the map like a drunken fool while people shoot missiles at you the entire mission. Not having standardized movement controls is a deal breaker. Another problem is that you actually have to hold down a button from time to time to orient the legs of your mech to the direction you are pointing and walking so that you can walk faster... or I guess you can call it normally. Why would they design it so your mech doesnt orient to the direction you are walking and pointing your mouse automatically? You are gonna be fiddling with player orientation, barricades and trash, and random screwed up controls all day on this one. Uninstalled and refund requested.

[i]Brigador[/i] is an isometric mech shooter with an emphasis on picking your fights and environmental destruction. Following the collapse of Solo Nombre's dictatorship, three factions emerge and you assume the role of a pilot contracted to overwhelm garrisons of troops to hit each of them where it hurts.

Not in the scope of a review, but multiplayer coop or versus would be KILLER.

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
+ The [b]gameplay[/b] is pretty simple and addictive as something that you can quickly pick up and play.
+ [b]Destruction[/b] of enemies and the environment can only be described as delicious. With level design as varied and beautiful as this, war crimes never felt so good.
+ [b]Sound effects[/b] are good, they give the weapons a lot of weight.  Combine that with some great asthetics, and there's plenty of immersive carnage to be had.
+ The [b]tutorial[/b] is solid and introduces pretty much everything you need while seemlessly transitioning into the campaign.
+ [b]Freelancing[/b] is loads of fun because though there's not an insane variety, there's an abundance of combinations to try out. The campaign does a good job of introducing these, and freelance missions are a great way to make cash and unlock new toys.
+ The [b]weapons and vehicles[/b] are oozing with quality. A Zöllig bipedal mech rocking twin Banshee machine guns and an audio-kinetic pulse piloted by the Man From Volta is something to behold.
+ It runs well and it's less than a gig on my hard drive. I can afford to keep this one installed.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
- Ok, I'm gonna go against the grain here. To me, the [b]score[/b] was forgettable and it only felt at home in the menus. If you read the lore, this world seems rather cutthroat and hopeless. Some of the pilots have nothing to live for and are hired because they'd take a cheap insurance package. The gameplay breathes fumes of intensity and the excellent sound effects can't accomplish it alone. However, the soundtrack is pretty par for synthwave and only portrays mild sentiments of intrigue and maybe some melancholy. Games like [i]Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Party Hard[/i] all have more meaningful synth soundtracks and as such are much more memorable. The score is fine by itself, but it doesn't have the tempo to keep up with the gameplay. It doesn't compliment it.
- I frequently found myself wrestling with the [b]vehicle controls[/b] (particularly for tanks), regardless of my scheme. Apparently this was a big deal back when on release and is partially responsible for why [i]Brigador[/i] didn't sell super well at launch, but it's a minor inconvenience that I was able to tolerate for the entire campaign. Targeting hovercrafts and operating mortars can also be tricky when you factor rotation speeds on your vehicles and the isometric layering of yourself in the environment. To that end, there's only a handful of the warehouse of mechs, tanks, and anti-gravs that I liked enough to use consistently.
- The [b]campaign[/b] itself isn't very special from a narrative perspective. It's laid out like [i]The Phantom Menace[/i] - it exists to justify a ""plot"" or build a world and doesn't really have any characters or interactivity.
- Though fun to destroy, the levels are often extremely [b]congested[/b], and the vehicles which cope best with maneuvering the clutter are unfortunately the worst at destroying things. When you first start, it won't be clear what explodes and what doesn't until you've killed yourself a few times.
- This is just a nitpick, but I wish [b]map markers[/b] would stay on the borders until I could actually see the thing I was tasked with blowing up. It's easy to lose track of objectives when they are neither sprites nor markers on your screen.

[h1]The Indecisive[/h1]
• [b]Combat[/b] in and of itself is pretty smart, but I found that it divided up into 3 general categories. Guns blazing, hit and run, and retreating. Each is viable if you position yourself well and know your weapons - especially at lower difficulties - but later in the campaign you'll find that some are like a peanut butter and lime sandwich for that scenario. In a way, defeat feels worse here than in other rogue-lites.
• The [b]lore[/b] is pretty cool and I enjoyed reading about it. However, you have to go out of your way to purchase and read it since it's super easy to skip over the text in the campaign. It's completely optional but if you put some time in to buy all the lore, you'll get what you paid for.
• [b]Difficulty[/b] is established by how long a mission is, the type of vehicle you use, and the pilot. However, some pilots are game-changing and if you randomize a freelance mission, you might need to manually switch off of them because they can be detrimental. Otherwise, the difficulty in freelance is very balanced and I tended to know when I'd be in over my head (even if that meant restarting with a slightly different loadout).
• [b]Level objectives[/b] almost exclusively involve blowing up something that can't move. Captains are an exception, but there's very little variety in level navigation and the core gameplay loop is essentially just blast your way from one corner of the map to the other unless you can pull off stealth. Fortunately, blowing stuff up is satisfying and stealth is simple enough to find a groove.
• This game brings out the worst of me and I love it.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
[i]Brigador[/i] is competent in what it does. The world doesn't care about brigadors - it doesn't care about you. For that reason, you shouldn't care about it. So brand, squelch, and maim everything that gets in the way of you and getting paid. Great Leader is dead. Solo Nombre must fall.

First off, you should play this game for the pure A E S T H E T I C alone. The visuals, music, ambience & just everything about the presentation oozes a brilliant aesthetic you just don't find in modern games.  Even if you just dabble in the game for a few hours it’s worth the experience just to support bringing this style back. Watch any trailer & you will immediately know what I mean.

Another thing that impressed me is how tight the Mech controls are. I genuinely forgot over the years what a Mech should feel like. & despite being an indie top down shooter the Mechs in this game have the best Mech gamefeel I have felt probably since the 90s.

The only issue I can take with the game is frustration. This really only affects the Campaign because if you play the expansive Freelance mode (which I think most consider the heart of the game) beating a level isn't as big of a deal. The issue with the campaign difficulty is you are forced into a selection of 4 pre set Mechs & if you don't like any of their loadouts you are out of luck. This became especially frustrating for me on the last 3 missions of the game...not only were they by far the hardest missions, but they were that much more maddening for me because I simply didn’t mesh with any of the Mechs I was allowed to use. 

Another big point of frustration you may find for yourself in the campaign is the slowness in beating a level. This game plays like Hotline Miami as I mentioned earlier. You get a map, an objective & you have to navigate through the difficult mission without dying despite your enemies being often overwhelming. Many enemies can kill in one hit & there is a tenseness when you begin to get surrounded. You made it near the end of a mission & got one shotted? Too bad you start all the way at the beginning of the level. While I enjoyed this in Hotline, in Brigador the frustration comes from how slow you are forced to play to get through a tough mission. You need to pick your shots carefully & move very slowly through the mission to avoid getting overwhelmed. On the last missions I found myself repeatedly getting frustrated over getting so close to the end & having to restart due to a bullshit death. When I hit the restart button, because of the frustration I would move fast & almost assuredly lose on the next attempt. You simply cannot power your way through the missions no matter how good of a shot you are or how much adrenaline you have. You have to take a breath & give yourself a moment before trying, the final missions each take about 20 minutes each & that is with the user carefully crawling through, sometimes painfully slowly. Playing with incredible patience will guarantee a better time with Brigador.

TL;DR Brigador is a return to the old in a wonderful way. Music, aesthetics, visuals & Mechfeel are all top notch. It’s something you won’t realize how much it was missed until you experience it for yourself again. If you get yourself addicted to its feeling the Freelance mode can provide you countless hours of fun allowing the user to combine unique pilots, Mechs, objectives, maps, everything. Just be ready to face some frustration when plowing through that campaign.

Update: Holy shit. As of writing this the Beat The Campaign achievement has a rarity of 2.6%. In my opinion that is insanely low for such a standard achievement, guess I am not alone in thinking those levels get brutally difficult.",1620113850,1620710278,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, I do have a problem with the end campaign levels. The normal campaign and levels are fine, and ramp up the difficulty at a reasonable pace. That is, until the end levels. These levels were added later on in the games lifecycle, and ""Are deliberately intended to be a test of everything you have learned up to that point.""

Run around learning the game and experiencing a variety of pre-crafted loadouts in the ""campaign"" mode, or make your own horrendous war crime machines as a Freelancer! The game has a large variety of player-drivable vehicles and numerous weapons to kit out your death machines, and despite the isometric artstyle the weapons work in 3D, so a towering mech that can shoot over many buildings and a tuk-tuk from hell that can hide behind even the lowest barriers will play differently even with the exact same weapons.

Not everything is perfect though. Most immediately, the game defaults to ""screen absolute"" controls so you can play it like a twin stick shooter: IMMEDIATELY change the settings so that mechs/tanks use relative controls for a much more engaging experience (no one will blame you for using absolute controls on Agravs though). The fact that weapons shoot in 3D can sometimes make figuring out where exactly your bullets are going to hit is difficult, sometimes the difference between ""behind"" and ""actually hits"" is difficult, and good luck having any idea where an artillery weapon is going to hit if you're firing it signifigantly towards the top or bottom of the screen. Finally, the F levels of the campaigns and the ""no stone"" and ""statistik"" achievements are downright aggravating compared to everything else in the game.

Overall, the cons, though annoying, are heavily outweighed by the pros.

As your shells reduce everything, everywhere, to smoke and ash. People lived here once, worked here once. They made memories here. Perhaps it means something to them.

But then the lights turn back on. You're in another district with new objectives. The wanton devastation you left behind you is no longer at the forefront of your mind.

The game would really benefit from a progression system or an ""Open Contracts"" type system to keep the replayability up.

Brigador is excellent for those short spans of time that you don't know what to do with. Everything in the game can be bite sized, the campaign missions often capable of being completed in under 15 minutes, while the freelance missions can be tailored for length and difficulty. Every time you pick Brigador up there are a great variety of options to try out and each session feels both familiar and fresh. That the game can be short is but one positive feature, though. Run a gauntlet of increasingly difficult missions, each completed section growing your bank account, the promise of a jackpot at the end for completing the entirety holding a command over you to think ""just one more run."" At these times you feel invincible and want to keep pushing further, only to get steam rolled by your hubris losing all that hard earned cash. First you're angry, but then you want to try again because you know you can pull it off. It's awesome, I love the feeling of pushing your abilities and luck at every moment and want to keep going long after that hour I had is over. Others have noted how beautiful this game is, the delightful design of each vehicle, weapon, and loadout, the remarkable score by Makeup and Vanity, and I feel I cannot add to what they have said without reiterating their points.

Amazing gameplay, beautiful art, perfectly suitable effects and music. Worth every dollar I spent on it. My only regret that I started playing game this late. So, just buy it and enjoy. 

Developers, please create Brigador 2, but with kind of open world strategic map (not just mission list) and ability to shop (and upgrade) for mechs, armors, shield generators, reactors and weapons like it was in good old classic game such as Tyrian. Also, please allow to have more than 2 weapon hardpoints on the mech and allow free hotkey assignment for every hardpoint. Stat-wise upgrades are enough (as it was done in Tyrian), no need to give unique texture for every upgrade - even though it is cool, it is extremely time consuming.

Actually, proper mech equipment screen with multiple weapons, shields, armors, reactors, engines and special modules (with assignable hotkeys as well) will be even better. You also can even add some kind of base building, where player can establish the base, develop over time and raid enemy for resources via strategic map. Enemy should respond in kind forcing player to defend base personally or with help of autonomous defenses, turrets and units.

Not in terms of gameplay, mind, the gameplay is fantastic once you get used to the quirks of steering the individual vehicles. 
The spritework is gorgeous, it runs smoothly, the sound design is wonderful, the vehicles handle nicely and the basic gameplay premise, while simple, is extremely fun - get plonked down in an area with the objective to destroy certain objectives, including the means of communication, enormous anti-air cannons and power supplies, and how you achieve these goals is up to you. Achieving them by whatever means necessary awards you credits, which you can spend to customize your chosen approach.

Sure, you could roll out in a functional tank, with a howitzer to take care of your objectives - the buildings - and a machine gun to take care of small fry that try in vain to scratch your shields, let alone dent your armor, with a stealth field generator to ensure smooth progression of hit and run guerilla tactics to avoid collateral damage as well as a safety net for when things go south.

Alternatively, though, you could also come floating up in a modified limousine, blasting sick guitar riffs to draw as many eyes on you as possible before firing cannisters of corrosive gas into a nearby strip club before levelling an entire apartment complex with an audio-kinetic shockwave. Or you take a stroll in a weaponized tuk tuk that will explode if looked at funny, but it's still an entirely viable means of playing. 

It's a game that lets you have fun. There is a broad selection of vehicles - between the three archtypes of mechs, tanks and anti-grav (basically aircraft) pertaining to the three enemy factions (the militaristic loyalists, the advanced spacers, and the corvid, who continuously baffle their competition by fielding vehicles that seem held together by the faith of the crew and the superglue they huffed while 'designing' their vehicular abomination), there's already lot to choose from. Each vehicle feels unique in the way they play, the way they maneuver, the way they turn and behave; and of course, what weapons they let you fit to them. Two mechs may look identical in terms of design on first glance, but upon playing you may find far preferable to the other - be it for faster acceleration, because you find a given weapon class one mech has hardpoints for boring, or because one of the two may not be able to rotate it's upper body 360 degrees around itself, meaning you can't shoot behind yourself as you leg it away from the enemy. 
There's a lot of experimentation to do and a lot of weapons to purchase; with machine guns ranging from those specialized in shredding shields to gatling guns so powerful dual-mounting them on a heavy-class tank can see it propelled backwards through recoil alone, howitzers with flat or high arcs, shotguns, laser weaponry and weaponized warcrimes in the form of super-corrosive gasses and mining beams that vaporize someone's entire skeletal structure, there are plenty of combinations to work with. It's all rounded out with extra equipment in the form of recharging smoke bombs to impair enemy vision, a cloaking device, an EMP grenade that neutralizes enemies within a radius, and an audio-kinetic pulse that flattens everything in a large radius.

They also come with juicy, juicy lore; each vehicle, each pilot, each weapon has its own little story and flavor text, all of which are very well-written and genuinely fun to read. 

However it also proves I am capable of great evil if given the tools to experiment and a lack of consequences for collateral damage, as I once again find myself slamming my hovercar down onto a group of civilians for no reason other than that they exist, only to then vaporize a group of soldiers with a gamma ray emitter.

So [i]morally[/i] speaking, yes. The game is horrible.

But Great Leader is dead.

I have not found a game I find myself enjoying as much as it in a very long time, and for good reason.

Brigador was met with little fanfare upon its release; as an Indy game, this is unsurprising I suppose. It received lukewarm reviews, a combination of unintelligent and unscrupulous gaming journalists and players without time or desire to learn the nuances of a game with slightly more complex anatomy than their baseline. I would be untruthful if I said that I was a fan of this game that whole time; like most people I presume, I learned of this game through a certain schizoaffective YouTuber and his Doctor Jeckle African warlord alter ego. However, that doesn't change my actual, genuine love for this game.

Brigador is not a wordy commentary on war. It is not a master work of world building through intricate gameplay and hidden lore. It does not tell a cohesive overworld narrative though in-depth dialogue and personal stories. Brigador instead tells it's lore through dialogue boxes, acquired after purchasing implements of destruction. These tools are to be used in it's top-down romp through the ruins-in-being of Solo Nobre, the capital of Novo Solo, a corporate war colony liberated from its chains by the enigmatic Great Leader. On the twilight of his passing, the corporate liaison, who I can only assume glows in the dark, offers war contractors to ""Brigadors"", guns and vehicles for hire. The war economy is booming, and anything that can mount anything more powerful than an 8mm Machine Gun is invited to the party; Have Gun, Will Travel.

Stardust on your boots and your Blood Group on your mechanist fatigues, you, your machine, and your weapons are free to romp through the world, destroying orbital guns, communications arrays, electrical infrastructure, and the defenders of the city at your whim. This game has that buzzword that seemed to be all the rage at the time of it's release, ""fully destructible environments''; except they mean it. You can destroy everything you see except only the map border walls. Every. Single. Thing. Every building, rail track, and road sign. Every gas station, civilian dwelling, or shop. Every square meter of crop and every tree. Everything. It's amazing. It reminds me of my first time playing Battlefield Bad Company in its own way, the absolute elation of taking your 200 tonne mech and walking through a retaining wall like it's paper, the joy of collapsing an apartment dwelling on top of your super-heavy tank and rolling through like it's rain. It's a joy im not legally allowed to obtain in the real world, and makes for a pleasant surrogate.

Brigador allows you to become an Avatar of death almost immediately. It costs less than $12 million in game (a typical mission will give you no less than $1.5m in the early game) to unlock the games most powerful weapons spread. That is not the end game, however. Oh yes, it's fun to roll around in the games most preposterous wonder weapon, mounting a GAU-8 and a 140mm smoothbore gun or becoming a wandering war crime by mounting an audiokenetic pulse device, a gas lauchner and a LASER that deep fries anything it touches, allowing you to turn anything into slag, a puddle, or a pink mist at your leisure. But the REAL fun comes in the form of getting their lesser comrades. That 200 tonne mech is well and good, but try destroying 4 orbital guns and 70% of the local garrison with a pickup truck mounting an MG-42 and a Carl Gustav m/48E5 with only AP rounds. NOW were talking. 

All of this is set to the background of a driving combination of synths and 808s. What DOOM is to metal music, Brigadors sound track is to Synth. Hotline Miamis sound track remains one of the best of all time, but Brigadors music firmly sits in the category of ""Music To Commit Genocide To"", and you will. Mick Gordon may have let his players know that The Only Thing They Fear is You, but Makeup and Vanity Set provide you with an assurance that there is No Way Out, except to go through the denizens of Solo Nobre. The sound design in game, besides the music, is lovingly crafted with so many mechanical sounds and thunderous impacts, that even if the music isn't your taste, the soundscape certainly can be enjoyed on its own.

This is the best off-brand Mechwarrior game you didn't know you needed. Stomp, explode, and laser everything in your way in a variety of vehicles through the middle of a revolutionary colony in order to bring it back into the fold of Evil Inc. Your character is one of 50~ potential mercenaries that are trying to profit or die trying. 

This game's hard in a fun way. There are very clear rules to how the game world operates, your relationship to the game world is very nuanced. For one, you can ram through almost anything without taking damage. In one of the earlier levels, the tutorial actively smack talks you into bravely kool-aid manning through the game world. If you don't look before you ram, you might hit something explosive and die almost instantly. Explosive hazards are predictable and always spawn in the same spots. Secondly, every weapon has innate strengths and weaknesses. The chaingun melts everything, but is an ammunition hog. Explosives are powerful, but have long reloading periods. etc. Oh, and many bullets are tracked and WILL zoom past the small hitboxes of the various go-karts the revolutionaries drive.

There's a lot of depth in the vehicle selection and customisation which is a plus.  The game concept is brilliant.  Unfortunately the technical implementation is lacking.  Graphics appear very retro/pixelly despite the game being released in 2016.  Overscan/DPI issues cause the game to render only 1/4 of the screen, so you need to jump through compatibility hoops to make this 2016 game run on any high end PC from 2016 or later (so they didn't do enough testing, either).   Once you do get it to work, there's no display scaling so text can be difficult to read, another technical gaffe. 

Despite the technical faults, there's a massive $20 USD price tag plus a slew of $5 DLCs, which is much too pricey considering the drawbacks here.   It's a good concept that deserves better treatment, so I'm hoping this 4 year old game gets a remaster or a sequel with updated graphics, bugfixes and so on.

The weapon and vehicle variety is incredible and so long as you keep switching up your loadout every run feels unique. Even if you avoid the sandboxy Freelance Mode entirely there's enough meat in the Campaign Mode to keep you playing for a very long time. 

I have a hard time explaining the gameplay of Brigador as it's unlike anything else I've played. Much more strategically nuanced than a twin stick shooter, much more intensely visceral than a strategy game. It's sort of a stealth game but one in which you're mean to cause as much destruction as possible. Worms meets Thief. Like I say it's unique. 

The devs are very active in the forums and will go to great lengths to help you out. They personally respond to most threads, even for minor stuff like offering tips to help you beat a particularly hard mission. 

If you do take the plunge I strongly recommend setting the controls to Relative instead of Screen Absolute as this was how the game was originally designed and IMO it feels much more natural. I also recommend using a mouse and keyboard as, again, this is the intended way to play and the default Gamepad controls feel a little janky. Having said that, I ended up playing most of the game using custom gyro controls on a Switch Pro Controller (there's a post in the forum about it for those interested).",1611956054,1623846068,True,0,0,0.467289716005325317,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 It helps that cover actually works in this game and the AI is pretty competent. You won't find yourself struggling to outsmart it, and once you're in a firefight it does just come right after you, but the search patterns and  patrols will keep you on your toes until then.

I wanted to love this game.

The music is some of the best I've heard in a game in a long time, it regularly ends up in my spotify mix because of that.

Despite that, though, the game just isn't good and didn't hook me. I don't know if it's how some missions are far too short and others tediously long, how combat often feels like it either has no stakes at all because of how trivial it is or just that the controls in almost any configuration are just unpleasant to use when combined w/ the specific point of view the game has. I wish I knew, because it's something I could suggest to the devs to fix, but I think that it's something inherent to the game which is disappointing because it does everything else so well.

Pros:
+Plenty of drivable vehicles from mechs to agravs, tanks or even a weaponized rickshaw.
+Great art design. Everything fits together and no asset feels out-of-place.
+Fantastic soundtrack.
+Good amount of content (Took myself 59 hours to 100% the game).
+Rich lore.
+Mod support.
+Both vehicles & weapons feel beefy and good to use.

Cons:
-Controls can feel a bit janky at first.

Brigador is a fantastic game where the only wrong way to play is to die. Every shot fired has worth as your paid almost as much for breaking the buildings as you are the machines you're fighting. A top down view gives a wide and extensive view of a finely detailed, fully destructible, battlefield of your making, and allows for quick reconnaissance to make a plan for your next attack. Just be sure to swap the controls because this isn't a twin stick shooter, and where you're facing will affect how you receive damage. Learn the controls and you'll be easily soaking rounds to pump out death in return.

You can play this entire game without reading a word if you so desired as the gameplay stands just fine on its own, and would almost relish the fact that the ""why"" doesn't matter, if you were to ascribe sentience upon it. That said there's a full on audio book and droves of lore if your willing to read. Brigador is now one of my favorite science fiction stories.

The music in this game is all synthwave and damnit if every single piece isn't perfectly placed. Rock out with your mech out, as you kick ass and chew bubble gum.

I wish I could port this game to Super Nintendo and send it back in time to myself when I was 12 and I had all day to sit around and play video games, lol. Seriously though, what a fantastic product; and an exceptional value for it's price. I just noticed I haven't reviewed it and I want to fix that, this game deserves every bit of praise it gets. The graphics, the sound, the lore, the music, the design, the game itself..where do I even start, or end for that matter? I could write a book on everything this game does right. At 35 years old, I've been playing video games since I was 4, from Atari on a black and white TV, through all the consoles, all the way to a high end gaming PC today. I'm an avid gamer, usually averaging at least 4-6 hours a day and I've played literally thousands of games in the last 30 years. Brigador is a highlight of that experience, it stands out, head and shoulders above the crowd and that's saying something; especially for a small indie game.

I'm going to be mostly, completely honest here. I had access to this game through a copy I didn't personally own, I won't go into more details, but I'm sure you can fill in the blanks. I've played this game to death, prolly hundreds of hours. Beaten it multiple times, unlocked all the lore, and all that jazz during a time in my life when I did not have the means to buy a copy for myself. I did play it though, and I did love it. This one vacation with my gf's family years ago, I brought my old laptop and had Brigador loaded on to it, and spent most of the week just playing it and unlocking all the extras for like the 3rd time. However, like all good things; it did eventually come to an end, and I felt that I was satisfied and ""done"" with the game. Time quietly moved on.

Then one day, later on in life.. I saw it on sale, and I thought to myself ""Even though I've played it to death, it'd be nice to have in my library"" but I hesitated over the purchase button. I thought of all the time I had spent playing it, how I had gotten so much enjoyment out of the game, and fell in love with it so hard; it felt wrong to buy it for anything less than full price. So, I waited until the sale was over and bought it then. It feels good to be in a place in my life where I can afford to finally give the dev's the money they so rightfully deserve.

Now, I just need to work on unlocking all my extras again!",1607347061,1607347180,True,7,0,0.495595961809158325,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't have time for a detailed review, but it also comes with a phenomenal audio book, I would highly recommend that you purchase that as well.

Set in Solo Nombre, the largest settlement on the outer colony planet of Solo Novo, Brigador is set in a dystopian future setting where the local dictator, Great Leader, has just died, and the powder-keg planet explodes in war.

You play as a ""Brigador"", an on-world soldier (can be from one of various factions, loyalists, rebels, spacers) that accept bribes from an off-world corporation (trying to take control of the planet in the power vacuum) to betray your own forces, and take your mech against both them and the surrounding civilians. You are NOT the good guy here... You get paid for destroying military targets, you get paid for collateral damage, you get paid for killing civilians. It is a bit... dark, and I love it. The more you destroy, the more money you get when you leave the planet in your escape craft.

If one phrase could describe this game, it is ""attention to detail"". It runs on a home-grown engine, and renders the vehicles, buildings, and explosions in stunning detail. You can shoot anybody and blow anything up, every wall, street light, home, business, person, and oil pipeline is fair game (definitely target the pipelines, watch the entire block explode!). Seriously, the artwork alone is extremely impressive. Even outside of the audio book, there is a plethora of in-game lore (that you purchase with in-game credits) that I found to be well worth my time.

The only ""con"" I can give this game is that the audio book is not available in a printed form, that said, the voice acting is top-notch (simply have a personal preference for physically printed books).",1607187291,1607187427,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I wondered if it was because I already had a weak spot for the kind of setting and military fetishism in full effect here.  I mean, it's true: Brigador scratches a million itches for me.  But, while thinking about this, I realized that the they're all things found in every aspect of the game, not just the setting, awesome and fleshed-out though it is.  The gameplay is exciting and nothing if not varied: it has the kind of mix of lethality and creativity I love about games like Hotline Miami.  I'm sure other people have made the HM connection because of the synth soundtrack and neon skyline, but despite this having a pace more befitting of its scale, it retains the thrill of a lot of HM gameplay.  That's pretty amazing.

I could have written a lot more, but if you want needlessly detailed reviews, I've seen them out there.  Watch Mandalore's video, for that matter.  It's vastly more informed than a professional reviewer's would have been, because it's a fan's perspective and therefore, he knows more about the game than he needs to - in a good way.

I was hoping for something like Bedlam (the 1996 video game) but found myself a little disappointed with it. 

There is little to no gore which sounds silly but when I'm crushing people or blowing them to bits with lasers I want blood! 
The campaign feels kinda limited and dull. You're given 3 people / vehicles to play on the missions; a tanky one, a light/offensive one which is nippy but weak and a sorta 'middle' between the two (although you can use all of them on the same mission). 
The weapons you cannot change (or, if you can I haven't unlocked that yet and I'm easily 10 missions in).

The missions all feel so 'samey'. Spawn, blow up a building or something and leave. That is literally -every- mission I've played on this game. It's repetitive and dull. The building blow up and demolish in a very scripted way, once you've blown a building up once or twice you know exactly what it's going to look like the third time you attack a similar building. 
As mentioned there is little / no gore (and I mention this because in the 1996 Bedlam game when you shot or crushed a human there were blood streaks for days!) on this people just puff into a red mist and then any and all trace of their existence vanishes (zzzz).

There is a ""freelance"" mode (might be named different, I forget) but the idea behind that is you pick your own character, vehicle, weapons etc etc from money you've earned either with missions from the main game or money you've earned in the freelance section. Everything seems pretty fairly priced (although some of the characters / vehicles are very expensive and feels to me only to make you grind for it, which I wouldn't mind at all if the game wasn't so dull). 

Maybe I'm just fussy. I did enjoy this game and enjoyed playing it for the 5 or 6 hours that I have but it's just become another game I'm unlikely to play much more of because it's just not keeping me excited or entertained.

It has a mechanic density that you simply won't see in videos, as vehicle's locomotion and weaponry require concentration as opposed to your typical twin-stick shooter.

The campaign has fixed loadouts with no customization, worthy of a single playthrough and to try stuff you might not have yet, but the freelance missions are where the meat of the game is. Multi-mission marathons that start at 2 days and get longer and longer as you buy more contracts, your ammo and health carry over between days (don't wreck the entire town until the last day), and you can choose between stealth and loud. Stealth is neat but leveling entire swaths of town with massive cluster mortars is just so satisfying. And you get paid for everything you break, so feel free to make your very own war crime zone.

Word of advice: immediately go into the game options and change Mech & Tank Controls to ""relative"" so they have actual tank controls. The default controls are twinstick shooter controls but this game is not that.

[h1] Story & Gameplay [/h1]
 The story is rather straightforward you are a Brigador and have signed a contract with the SNC complete their missions and extract to claim your payment. This is told both in the campaign and in the rogue lite Freelance operations. In the Campaign you pick from a select few loadouts for every map, so by the end you will have tried out a lot of the weapon and vehicle varieties that exist. You will unlock more maps as you complete missions and mostly they are a lot of fun with every mech. Some standout ones are [i]Intense Gravity,[/i] [i]the Void Repeats,[/i] [i]Wait for the Blackout,[/i] and [i]I’ll be what I am[/i]. Then there are the few frustrating maps but oh how satisfying it was when I finally beat [i]Come Finest Surgeon[/i] with the most vulnerable mech, I would do it all again. 

 Freelance operations on the other hand are unlocked by spending the in-game currency you receive from completing maps, you will also have to unlock the vehicles, weapons and pilots through the same means. Anyways during an operation there are a set number of maps you can play on either randomly selected from the map-pool or decided by the operation. You receive generic objectives that are always the same. Kill all commanders, kill a set number of the garrison or destroy the orbital guns. When one of those is accomplished you can move on to the next map from any exit, however, you get more money from completing all of them and completing the side objectives. You also get a victory bonus depending on your pilot, and a multiplier based on difficulty. Difficulty is also dependent on your pilot and has a set minimum, maximum and increase per map value. It is also worth noting that your armour does not reset while in an operation so make sure it’s your shield that is taking damage, especially since you cannot always withdraw whenever you want and dying means losing the vast majority of what you would have made. 

 When you have started a map, you get to enjoy the great combat. I especially enjoy prowling the city blocks with the tank controls, and my medium mech. Sniping enemies from behind before I get spotted or using the burst mortar to kill an entire squadron that never knew I was there. If they do sound the alarm then the hectic combat gets satisfying as you try and manoeuvre aggressively enough to have ammo and to keep your shields, but not so aggressive that you end up dying. Sometimes it can end up being frustrating like when you enter the map in the worst possible location but dying is fun and next time you play this map you will get your revenge.  

[h1] Presentation [/h1]
 The game looks phenomenal and it also looks great when it is destroyed from your recent battle, with the half-ruined buildings and the surviving civilians in their yellow raincoats running away. I also enjoy the contrast between the idyllic neighbourhoods with their mansions and then the dystopian slums. You can also find out more about everything from these districts to the pilots, weapons, enemies and even the Brigador contract you signed. It’s a good read being both interesting and funny. 
 The music is as stated above great as well and while it is that good on its own its even better in the context of the game. It fits the cyberpunk look and feel of the game immensely and both are better off for it. The songs are catchy, memorable, I listen to them even when I am not playing the game and they have stuck with me since I first played the game. If you want examples listen to [i]Solo Nobre Must Fall[/i] or [i]There Is No Law Here.[/i]

Что может быть круче, чем огромный боевой робот, способный разносить всё вокруг? К сожалению, далеко не все игры дают нам полную свободу разрушений. Но, Brigador в лихвой окупает недостаток этого.

На первый взгляд игра представляет собой ничем не примечательный Top-Down Shooter про роботов. Но, стоит начать проходить кампанию и начать заниматься ""фрилансем"", как перед тобой откроется огромное количество лора и кастомизации.

Графика и Дизайн

Как и многое в этой игре, по-началу ты не обращаешь ни на что особого внимания. Мехи как мехи, домики как домики. Однако, погружаясь в процесс, ты начинаешь втягиваться. Локации - разнообразны, начиная от Ж/Д станций и трущоб, заканчивая лабиринтами городов, где тяжелый мех с трудом пролезет. А спустя пару часов игры ты уже начинаешь различать мехи разных фракций.
Спецэффекты тут не сказать, что на сверх-высоком уровне, но при этом они не выбиваются из общего стиля игры (привет взрыву лодки из Crysis). Да и в целом неоново-панковая стилистика мне приходится очень по-вкусу.

Отдельным пунктом я бы хотел отметить пилотов. Каждый их портрет уникален. И среди них встречаются как совершенно нормальные люди, так и нечто...странное. А ведь я не открыл и половину из всех.
Единственная проблема всего этого - локации со временем начинают приедаться. Да, они по-факту разные, но через часов этак 10 ты начинаешь замечать знакомые ассеты. Кроме того, по-факту многое оружие не слишком отличается внешним видом.

Звук

Озвучки как таковой в игре нет. А вот звуков в игре много. Шум разрушаемого здания, взрывы, лазерные выстрелы и много другого. Саундтрек так же оказывается к месту и совершенно не мешает игре (хотя, не скажу, что он очень запоминающийся). А ещё многое оружие обладает пусть и одинаковыми звуками, но разной громкостью, что довольно важно для геймплея.

Геймплей

А теперь приступим к самому интересному. Первая вещь, которая привлекла моё внимание - это тотальная и практически абсолютная разрушаемость всего и вся. Неуязвимы только дороги и стены, ограничивающие локацию. Всё остальное без проблем поддаётся уничтожению, будь то маленькая машинка или шикарный особняк. Тут единственная проблема в том, что все конструкции разрушаются без остатков.
Но, это не единственная особенность игры. Кроме этого, тут есть неплохая кастомизация. Мы можем выбрать пилота, мех и оружие из широкого списка вещей. Только пилотов здесь 50 штук, что для инди-игры много.

Вариантов оружия тут тоже прилично. Есть и пулемёты, мортиры, дробовики, ракеты и ещё куча самых разных вещей. И, идентичного оружия тут нет. Они все различаются кучей параметров, будь то громкость или эффективность против щитов. За всё время игры я не встретил ни одной бесполезной пушки (в отличие от их комбинаций).
Всё это открывает широкий спектр для тактики. Можно взять тяжеленного меха, что своей массой сможет без проблем пробить дом и навесить на него тяжелое оружие. А можно взять бронескафандр и бегать с двумя пулемётами. При том, оба варианта окажутся схожи по эффективности при грамотном подборе оружия.
Помимо мехов, в игре есть и бронетехника, и антигравы самых разных видов, но лично я больше отдал предпочтение мехам. При этом, все три вида техники достаточно сильно различаются между собой.

Ещё должен отметить, что у врагов очень много вариантов техники и они могут кататься на всём тем же, на чём и грок. А ещё должен отметить, что враги обладают достаточно неплохим ИИ. Кроме того, в игре много что может взрываться (и очень круто!). Но, с этим надо быть очень аккуратным - разрушив половину района можно оказаться в проигрышной ситуации.
Но, стоит поговорить немного о грустном. А касается это миссий. Если с компанией всё более-менее не плохо, то в режиме фриланс (они же свободные миссии) нам предлагают стабильно 3 пути прохождения карты. Уничтожить ПВО, уничтожить 70% врагов и уничтожить всех командиров. И, хотя это разбавляется всякими дополнительными особенностями (разрушение башен связи, трансформаторов, наблюдателей - всё это упрощает миссии), это вскоре надоедает.

Сюжет

А вот тут всё максимально не однозначно. Из всей компании я смог понять, что мы играем за Бригадоров - этаких наёмников, что работают на загадочную организацию. Каждая миссия является почти независимой от предыдущих, но при этом нам ясно дают понять что и зачем нам надо делать.
А вот что касается лора - с этим всё великолепно. Каждый персонаж, техника, локация или оружие (и многое другое) имеет какое-никакое описание. Порой отлично обоснованное или юморное. В любом случае, их интересно читать для погружения в мир игры. Было бы классно, если разработчики принялись развивать эту вселенную.

Баги, фичи, оптимизация

Тут всё превосходно. Никаких багов или ""фич"" обнаружено не было, а оптимизация превосходна. Даже в самые напряженные и взрывные моменты игра не провисает и выдаёт стабильную картинку.

Итог

Великолепная инди-игра, если вы любите разрушения, взрывы, роботов и глубокий, проработанный лор. Да, может быть и сам сюжет не так хорош и разнообразия мало, но пройти парочку контрактов вечером - очень даже приятно.

Brigador is a War-Crime simulator where you play as a mercenary who has betrayed their home planet to a faceless Mega Corp who wants to take control of it for its mineral wealth. In the campaign you will pick between 1 to 4 different pilots and vehicles in form of a Mechs, Tanks, and Anti Granvity. These are armed with a wide verity of weapons ranging from simple machine guns and rail guns, to radiation guns that in-canon either give you super cancer when they hit you, or melt you into a puddle of goo. All of these war machines control great; but require a bit of training to really master. 

What really sells Brigador however is a game. With an amazing sound track of synthwave to groove to while you stroll through the city of Solo Nobre and kill anything that gets in your way.

But the best thing, in my option anyway, is the LORE and STORY. 
There is a lot of it, and it's GOOD. I can't explain it all within this short review but it's well worth the read to give more context as to the events of what you are doing, who you are doing it to, and why. All written from the perspective of in universe characters. 

If you like sci fi, Mech games, synth wave, war crime simulators, or any combination of those things then you are doing your self a disservice by not buying it.

Not because it's a bad game, but rather because it's weirdly uncomfortable the more you think about the game.

TL:DR - Game is absolutely excellent from a gameplay, visual and audio standpoint but the premise and activity of the game is more horrifying the more you think about it and some negative events with one of the lead developers may be a deal breaker for some (Which is a-okay, I only learned of it recently and have had the game for ages.) Purchase and play as long as you don't mind playing an absolute monster doing monstrous things, and are okay with the outside events.

From a gameplay perspective, Brigador is simply excellent. The controls are good, the weapons are punchy, the graphics and sound design make the entire game a delight. Frankly I love playing the game. The music especially is just gloriously enjoyable. Based solo on gameplay, visuals and sound design this game is simply excellent.

The story is...limited. Theirs a lot of lore, and the lore is interesting, but the story at least in the game is that you are being paid to clear out priority targets on a space colony that's essentially controlled by a recently deadified dictators military remnant.  You are being paid by the prior colony owners, a conglomeration of extremely exploitative corporate interests. Essentially you are a mercenary, paid by corporate monsters, to kill the various local extremists and not worry about collateral damage. The game is essentially one giant war crime. It's frankly ever more disturbing and the setting ever more grim the more you think about it.

It's a shocking thing, realizing that you are essentially playing an abject monster...killing monsters and anything in the area, and being paid by other monsters.

Frankly it's incredibly grim. And the disparity between the fun of the game and what you are actually engaging in is jarring.

Their are some other things, things that soured my opinion of one of the developers. One of the lead developers in point of fact. They said some real vile and hateful stuff and it's real unfortunate to hear as it does sour my opinion. But I don't feel it's fair to let their bad actions condemn the whole team.

This game was a great entertainer for me when I was working in remote areas (so don't let my recorded playtime fool you).

In a way this game scratches a nostalgia itch I had for things like Future Cop LAPD, or even the Jungle Strike series, though the game holds up on its own and has a unique identity to be sure. With the wealth of vehicles and weapons available there are a lot of different mechanics and approaches, and although most of the missions have an identical set of objectives, the individual runs are different enough that there's lots of room for replayability, and more than once I've fallen into the trap of ""ooh that was so close, just one more run and I can pull it off"".

The Dev/Publisher is not [spoiler]sh!tty[/spoiler], no MXT, not a live service, no subscription, no bullshite. In fact they go above and beyond to be awesome, its rare now days. You get a mod kit, the devs incorporated community mods, they even helped modders with incorporating them and offering guidance, they don't nickle and dime you for everything.

If they are as great as I hope then they'll develop a devoted following and nurture long term success.

You get, what is it, 5 albums with the $30 version...that alone is worth 60 dollars, they're lossless and mp3. Oh and an audiobook! Which is top notch, the narrator was a good pick, I really enjoyed throwing it on and playing the game. I hope more books get made. The music is great and I'm happy to have been introduced to Makeup and Vanity Set.
This game is full of content, I just finished the campaign at 100% 109hrs, there is tons of lore to read, and a ""skirmish"" mode where you can customize your vehicles weapons/specials then run through sets of levels or just go full random after you've beaten the campaign.

The character art for some reason really captivates me, there is so much detail put into these character portraits its awesome, combined with the bios and you get a feel for what type of person they are. I only had issue with one bio, it was pretty cringe to me, ""Johnny Five Aces"" lol [spoiler] He talks about going to bang some ""prostitute"" and her mellifluous ass, which isn't a great adjective for a bum and fantasizing about her pussycat quivering..Maybe erotic literature just isn't my thing. Unexpected for sure. [/spoiler] Overall the writing is very good, I especially enjoyed looking up the Portuguese, German, and some of the scientific names they sprinkle in there. I actually learned some stuff and appreciated other cultures that the lore establishes.

The campaign wasn't too hard and the difficulty scaled well, until the last 4 levels, those were quite a bit more difficult if you wanted to 100% the level. The controls were fine, seriously tank controls are the only way baby. For weapons the very front and end of the firing line is hard to see, about an inch, which makes artillery slightly more of a pain to use. 
I would like to see a zoom feature for smaller vehicles so you can really get a sense of how huge the mech you just stage dived is, there are a few other additions I think could work and lore I want to see expanded on but that is for later.

Wonderful game, tons of fun, great dev/publisher, good tunes, mechs, detailed sprite art, gorgeous destructible environments.

Be aware this is not a fast paced twin stick shooter type game, it tends to be slower and more tactical. Outmaneuvering, misdirecting and picking off enemies tends to work better than brute forcing your way through. There's the campaign, which is a good introduction for learning how the game works, but the real fun is in the freelance missions. Freelance allows you to select your vehicle, weapons and difficulty and run through missions yourself. If you die you don't get paid anything and the harder you make things for yourself the more money you get. Money is used to buy more weapons, vehicles and pilots, but doing a chunk of the campaign missions get you a decent amount of money to pretty much buy what you want and experiment. The game doesn't get really grindy so don't worry about that.

All of the graphics are 2D sprites in an isometric view and most areas have a distinct heavy industrial style to them. The game also applies lighting effects to the sprites to really make these gritty urban areas look really cool. The vehicles are 3D models projected onto 2D sprites to remain consistent with the scenery, similar to how Roller Coaster Tycoon does it. The music is full of heavy synthwavy songs but there's also some really chill sounding songs to break up the monotony. I highly recommend looking up and listening to the soundtrack.

Also make sure to set your controls to relative. It will hurt for a while but in the long run you will appreaciate being able to back up without turning your weakpoint towards the enemies and your guns away from them.",1604600193,1604600193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You have a mission like destroy 4 statues, you pick a loadout which involves a pilot, mech, gun 1, gun 2 and special ability.
You then proceed to blow up the map as you decide the most convenient path for you to take is not the streets leading to your objective but instead destroying buildings, graves and gas stations just to make the enemy investigate and get blown up as they go around the corner into your firing line.

The vehicles come in 3 types:
-Hover vechicles that have a spacebar ability to groundpound (doing the most damage when you reach your higest point, so spamming it is bad)

-Mechs that can either stand up or crouch (depending on the mech) which alters their elevation, either letting them use more of a cover or letting them shoot over cover that normally would be too tall for them. They also get the spacebar ability to smash the ground with their feet, ofcourse

-Ground vehicles that can turbo and basically let them smash anything in their way effectively

The 3 types are also interesting in the sense that the direction you get hit from is important for your health, so if you get hit from the sides or the rear, expect more damage. So if you pick a mech, you'll be more ""rigid"" in your orientation due to having to turn your body unlike a hovercraft which has a lot more freedom in movement. However a mech can just rotate his top half to quickly handle a flanker while keeping his body frontal for the bigger group of enemies.
This rule however also counts for the enemy, so if you have a small, agile hovercraft then you'll be most likely be quickly moving around your targets just to hit them in the sides where it hurts.

The game also has something of a stealth aspect to it, there are certain enemies that act as spotters, if they spot you they'll start to communicate to HQ. If you let them finish then the base goes to alert, everyone will be ready to fight you (shields on and all that), they'll raise these roadblocks to annoy you with (it lowers for the enemy though to rub it in your face) and reinforcements will arrive to deal with you.
However depending on your loadout, stealth is not always going to be an option when you're using weapons of mass destruction, towering above walls with your sheer size and loud (sound is a thing) guns.

The game has 2 modes:
1. A campaign where you do the tutorial missions and then proceed with more proper missions although it feels like it starts you off quite slowly (atleast if you try to do the mission with all the premade loadouts before proceeding) which left me wondering if I was missing something since it felt like I was doing the same thing for the most part despite all the gameplay mechanics telling me I could play smarter.
Luckily I finally started to get missions where some of the loadouts felt challenging to play with for the mission and meant I was dying a few times before I could pull it off.

2. Freelance is where you use all the money you earn from either gamemode to buy new pilots, new vehicle, new guns for said vehicle, new ability (smoke grenade, emp, etc.) and missions. (You can also use money to buy lore about the game)
You basically make your own loadout, depending on your choices you'll either gain a lot of money or not so much at all but the choice is all yours and there is A LOT  to choose.
The ""Operations"" contain multiple missions unlike the campaign which come as you might imagine, mission per mission.
However you have to do those X amount of missions in a row in order to complete the ""Operation"" and some of them won't let you leave without completing your task.
All the info on them are available in the screen so you're not just buying  ""Operations"" blindly, so if you really don't want to play the operation that has 39 missions, then you can just ignore that one and not buy it and use the ingame money on something else.

The soundtrack is also amazing, I really enjoy listening to it even outside the game so I strongly recommend giving it a listen even if you decided that the game is not your cup of tea.

I strongly recommend the game, I played it for 5 hours at the writing of this review and I'll be expecting to play the game for many more hours to come.

Also, if you plan on playing the game I strongly recommend changing in ""general"" settings, the tank and mech movement to relative so it doesn't turn unless you press the A or D keys because directions are important for  taking less damage.",1604561755,1604565893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Notnheless this game oozes with style and offers very sandboxy missions where your chosen vehicle really affects the playstyle.

The general story premise is that action takes place on Solo Nobre, a sort-of Juche Space Brazil planet whose Great Leader, who previously overthrew the colonial Solo Nobre Concern, finally croaked, so now Solo Nobre Concern are using hired mercenaries who get paid for every civilian they kill and every structure wrecked to mazimize chaos and destroy the orbital gun arrays protecting the city. You play as these guys. Most missions are freelance are just entering locales and wrecking things, though, the story is mostly conveyed trough unlocked purchase descriptions and mission briefings - but the limited picture you get still offers a vision of very developed sci-fi universe. It feels pretty hard sci-fi for a game full of mechs shooting energy weapons at force field hovertanks. There's all sorts of tidbits about Sole Nobre's culture, history, engineering doctrines and details about involved factions like Spacers, the decadent elites of this universe who engage in banditry for amusement and to fund their opulent lifestyles, or Corvids, the Solo Nobre's anarcho-syndicalist rebels who are a wild mix of bitter partisans willing to engage in questionable acts of terror and somewhat unhinged artists and youths interested in being loud, rowdy and defeat the NEP regime in style.

Talking about defeating things in style, all the factions offer really varied vehicles, and I mean it, there's stuff like tanks and generic mechs, sure, but there's also absolutely oversized abominations, massive towers on wheels, tuk-tuk three-wheeler taxis, weird spacer designs that look like three story high moon rovers, luxury cars with hoverdrives slapped on.. and they all handle very differently! Like, beyond obvious things like weapon hardpoints or speed and armor, the height influences the projectile trajectory so tall lanky mechs can shoot over obstacles with ease, but also need to aim directly at where enemy is for shot to hit them, unless the enemy it also a towering war machine. Also all vehicles take double damage from the rear, this combined with height nuances and some situational nuances, plus the fact game's original controls were by default the cumbersome-ish tank controls made it a more tactical and less twin stick shooty. Of course you can toggle the more twin stick-like controls nowadays, but things like importance of height and even stealth elements (oh yeah, destroy alarm raising scouts and officers ASAP unless you want to get swarmed or loose surprise advantage!) still demand some thought and skill, so you can't just pray and spray the problems away. Also the game encourages taking risks, so you'll get bigger payouts for beating the level or freelance operation with a tiny scout or third rate outdated junk instead of picking a top of the line war machine. Realest Chads use Tuk-Tuks as technicals.

One more remarkable feature of this game is the art direction. The synthwavey soundtrack is an obvious bullet point, but also it's got some fascinating technical features where in spite of being 2D it has fantastically implemented dynamic lighting that makes cities look real and alive even as they're getting wrecked by giant stompy mech. The weapons and car lights also illuminate the locales which looks neat. The way how the level looks after all the wrecking is also amazing, ruins everywhere.

You should really try it if you enjo games that blend arcadey ideas with more slow-paced, tactical gameplay.",1604327606,1604327606,True,21,0,0.668773889541625977,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are three primary types of vehicle: Mechs, agrav units, and tanks. Mechs have modest armor and good maneuverability.

The three vehicle designers - being Loyalist, Spacer and Corvid, have their own overall archetype. 
Loyalist vehicles have average shields, but durable hulls and thick armor, making them slower but allowing for extended engagements typical of a practical military design.
Spacer vehicles have modest armor but powerful shields. They tend to be faster, but are also a bit over-designed, in my opinion - a perfect match for a hedonistic raider society. 
Corvid vehicles lack shields and armor but have incredible amounts of overshield, and are quite fast, rewarding aggressive play.
The unique control setup allows you to be in precise control of exactly where your vehicle is facing at any time - and given the game's directional damage system, facing towards your enemy is always important, since that's where your armor is thickest.",1603468337,1707227028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play a mercenary hired to destroy infrastructure and hostile targets on a cyberpunk style world. With a massive amount of different vehicles to choose from, divided into three categories (mech, hovercraft and tank) each controlling and playing differently. Your objectives are fairly standard. Blow up some buildings. Kill a certain number of defenders. But the variety of vehicles and weapons you can use, combined with the decently intelligent AI from the enemies is what makes the game grand. Everything on the map being destructible doesn't hurt either.

The game has a campaign mode, where you will usually be given a choice between three different loadouts for each pre-designed mission, adding in a fair amount of replayability. Also included is a freelance mode with randomly generated missions and fully customisable loadouts and vehicles. Pretty much everything in Freelance must be unlocked with in-game credits, but by the time you finish campaign you will have more than enough to buy a fair selection of toys to play with.

The game really does feel like more than the sum of it's parts. Allowing you to bait enemies into traps, or just blast through every building on the map. Try and hunt down every fleeing civilian and crush them under the mighty steel feet of your mech, or zip around in a cloaked hoverbike praying no stray bullets hit you and shred your paper-thin shields.

Highly recommended.

In short, it's excellent. The game's freelance missions can be as easy or hard as you want them to be. It all depends on your choice of pilot, vehicle and gear. The campaign has a nice baked in tutorial, with a good spike in difficulty near the end to give some challenge to players before they sink their teeth into freelance. 

It's mechanically deep enough to reward smart play while also allowing you to just jump into a huge durable machine and let loose as if it was a twin-stick shooter. The large selection of pilots, vehicles, weapons and freelance operations gives the game a good margin of replayability too. 

My only minor complaint is that pilots don't feel very unique.

Если вас они смущать не буду, то милости просим, покупайте. 

У игры напрочь отсутствует экономика. Здесь она присутствует в качестве заглушки, которая обуславливает твое возвращение в игру и выглядит это как деньги, которые ты получаешь за счет выполнения заданий и нанесения разрушения. К сожалению, ты очень быстро можешь обнаружить что их буквально не на что тратить. Что самое интересное есть в игре? Пушки? Да. Меха? Да. И ты разумеется тратишь местную валюту на пушки и мехи, но их можно купить практически все буквально с самого начала. Все остальное - это покупка новых уровней во фрилансе, инфу о врагах и новых пилотов (которые к слову мало чем влияют на геймплей). В итоге игра заставляет тебя фармить на второстепенные по интересности вещи. И ты замечаешь за собой, что игра...как не странно... предлагает в себя именно что ""играть"" а не пытаться достичь каких-то вершин, предлагая лишь условные цели а.к.а. пройти компанию а.к.а выфармить все локации и пилотов.

Меня так-же смущает что все пушки в игре одинаковые с точки зрения визуального дизайна. Разумеется это дело совсем уж второстепенное, но чтобы вы понимали, о них надо рассказать чутка по подробнее. В игре присутствует 5 типов вооружения (вроде как, я если честно не запоминал и прикинул на вскидку) и сколько-то типов его классификаций аля ""Штатное, дополнительное, тяжелое и т.д"". В этом диапазоне в каждом разделе есть буквально по две пушки с разными статами и эффектами стрельбы (Опять же, к чему у меня притензий нет). Моя претензия заключается в том, что между собой они все нарисованы одинаково.

Imagine a large tank. Now imagine another tank stack on top. Now imagine an armor plated Buick to top of the two tanks. Now imagine a massive 30MM minigun and a corrosive gas launcher attached to the Buick. 

Finally, imagine opening up with said minigun at 5000RPM into a patrol of mechs you just ambushed in a upscale suburban neighborhood while committing 17 war crimes just with one launch of the corrosive gas barrels. 

Brigador is a fantastic evolution of the standard twin stick shooter. Easy to jump in and out of, lots to see and unlock, beautiful ""retro"" visuals and a soundtrack that keeps the energy flowing. 

(Make you you adjust the controls ASAP to a format that best fits your style or else, you're gonna break your fingers.)

Praise be to Mandalore.

There's great variety in weapons and vehicles; with dozens of weapon styles each within multiple classes (walker mech, tank, hover vehicle) help you decide how you want to approach a mission. If you'd rather a more guided approach, then the campaign is the place for you.
The weapons are just so satisfying and visceral, even from such a zoomed out isometric view.  So many times you'll try a weapon for the first time and get that 'whoa' feeling...

As mentioned above, there's more than meets the eye at first. Firing arcs, movement, abilities and detection all take a bit of getting used to in order to beat the mid to higher difficulties. Definitely do the tutorial campaign maps before you Freelance. It's worth the (small) effort to do so though, and quickly becomes a pick up and play game once you know what you're doing.

Only downsides for me? The UI is not great. The menus look like a 3 minute hatchet job and are unintuitive. Quite honestly they are the biggest turn-off of the game.
Also, The firing arc cursor can sometimes get lost in the devastation going on around you. A cursor scaling option in the menus would really help there.

A tactical mech/tank/hover thingy almost-twinstick shooter set in a cyberpunky world. Let's go through it then, shall we?

Gameplay: Brigador has great variety. Three different factions with three different vehicle types, on which you can mount guns from several weapon pools. Cannons, machine guns, railguns, lasers. It's all here. You can take these war machines out for a walk/ a drive in either the campaign, or the rouge-lite freelance mode. The former features a good learning curve for new players and nice replayability through the different loadouts you can equip. Just make sure you don't bore yourself with choosing every available loudout for a mission back to back. The freelance mode gives you more freedom and thus the option to do all sorts of fun stuff. The variety helps putting together your own fun and the money reward system encourages you to try more difficult missions and less reliable vehicles to keep the difficulty up.

Art: In Brigador you can instantly tell which vehicle is from which faction. May it be the clunky militaristic Loyalists, the ""junkyard came to life"" aesthetic of the Corvid rebels, or the arrogant futuristic Spacers. Each one has their own charm to it. This is combined with stuffed cyberpunk neighborhoods with neat neon colors or beautifully dreary industrial zones. Very nice.

Music: It's synthwave/outrun/electronic. That music, which is always combined with some 80s visuals and that really works well with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic going on. There are a few ""meh""-songs inbetween but most of them are great for stomping through buildings.

Story/Lore: While there isn't really much of a story on the surface there are entire pages worth of lore tucked away. Each vehicle and weapon has a text written for it by some in-universe character. A lore section explains some interesting concepts in the world of Brigador and I love that sort of stuff. Reminds me of flipping through the user manual of some older games.

Brigador is great as long as you know how to entertain yourself, enjoy futuristic dystopias and violence. I'm excited to see what they plan on doing with the sequel Brigador Killers, and I will definetly keep an eye on that one.",1600297840,1623455543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can quickly figure out simple tactics to deal with all the different enemies and situations you might encounter, and it doesn't feel like there's much pushing me to go for better scores in the levels vs just slogging through to complete each mission. I often feel I'm wasting time going for the bonus objectives. 

Also, the campaign structure is awkward, you have to decide basically whether you want to replay each campaign mission with each of the three different loadouts as you go, or just complete each mission with one of the loadouts, and I wasn't really sure what the point of doing either was. If you replay each campaign mission 3 times with each loadout, you will get burnt out with the repetition, but if you only do one loadout per mission, you will wonder what you are missing by not trying the other loadouts.

Honestly I just didn't feel a strong desire to continue in the game, there just wasn't anything really motivating me to play it. Didn't really feel a sense of progression once I felt like I solved combat.

It's not quite a twin stick shooter, but as far as unsatisfying gameplay, it's kind of like they took a well designed twin stick shooter but reduced the amount of enemies to 5% and massively slowed down the pace. And unlike a well-designed twin stick, the action in the game is kind of lacking ""squishiness"" - impacts, explosions, etc... all feel like they could have some more punch. Destroying something is surprisingly unsatisfying, it just goes poof and you see its destroyed sprite.

I held off on getting this game for quite awhile after I saw the appealing trailers / reviews because i wasn't sure the gameplay would hold up. Eventually I caved and got it, but I discovered I was basically right about the gameplay. There's plenty of other fun action games out there that do give you an urge to keep playing. I would suggest giving Synthetik a look as I had a lot more fun with that and it has kind of a similar gameplay.",1600027780,1600027944,False,3,0,0.474923610687255859,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
+Absolutely amazing soundtrack.
+Extremely detailed graphics despite the pixelated 3D models.
+A solid campaign backed up by a highly customizable free play scenario mode.
+Deep gameplay with tons of choices in vehicles, weapons, and pilots.

The Bad:
-Unlocking everything can be rather grindy.
-Pilots all feel very samey, despite the fact that they are your 'difficulty' modifier.
-AI will often jam in clutter or get stuck on walls.

It plays more like a tactical shooter than a ""Mech"" game.
I HIGHLY, *HIGHLY* ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE TANK CONTROLS. This isn't quite a twinstick shooter. 
Except AGRAV vehicles. They're weird to use tank. Just use screen absolute and then pay close attention to where enemies are.

Okay so set up is: You take control of ""Brigadors"", basically mercenaries. A person called ""BIG LEADER"" is dead, the planet is in upheaval with 3 factions, and now a Corporation is paying mercs to move in, wipe out ANYTHING they can so they Corps can move in and take the planet back that they got kicked off from by, an assumedly, unhappy people.
Moral of the story: Corporations and Capitalism Suck. They pay you to commit warcrimes and slaughter civilians.

I haven't gotten through loads of this game, maybe only just about half way (almost) through campaign with all the loadouts that are pre-set. This game has a lot of different ways to play with different vehicles, which can all be specialised for specific things or some built for hybrid purposes. There are Mechs, Tanks, AGRAVS and.. Cars. 
The smaller the vehicle, the worse the equipment you can put on, the less health it has. However; worse equipment = better payout. Smaller Vehicles also, generally, make less noise. They are harder to spot. Harder to hit. usually move fast, too. It's all about trade offs.
The larger tanks and mechs can lack subtly, trading off most stealth for overwhelming firepower and shields, but can easily get spotted and, more often than not, easily overwhelmed and shot down.

You always wanna flank, if you can. But it's way more important to flank and engage small groups with smaller vehicles. Special Equipment also has a cooldown rather than ammo (Yes. Ammo is limited. Pick your fights wisely. Spend your ammo carefully.) and they are made to be used whenever you can.

Smoke can obscure sightlines, making enemies reluctant to shoot through, making you basically invisible. It acts like a ""Wall""
Active Camo allows you to instantly disengage and reposition. Or move around ambushes or enemy footholds. In and out, basically.
The Audio Kinetic Pulse is, to put it bluntly, a cone shaped shotgun. It obliterates buildings, foliage, and most enemies, in front of you. It lacks subtly. It lacks the ability to mitigate damage. But it creates openings, and lets you clear enemies in front of you in a pinch. Remember, different guns do different amounts of building damage and shield damage. Weak piddly weapons might only be good against armour. Or shields. Or buildings exclusively. A lot of them wont be allround. It's all a viable option.
Another option is the EMP Grenade. Long cool down, but it's got a HUGE area of effect and shuts down everything except you. Shuts of shields, vehicles, shuts down turrets, etc.

Yeah. THere's stealth mechanics in this, to a point. Enemies can lose sight of you, and will go to the last point they saw you and look around. You can use this to get around them, avoid, etc. They investigate sounds, and prioritise LOUD sounds like big booms. And ammo depots explode. So do gas pipelines. So do gasoline stations. And Orbital Cannons do, too. Those are real loud. 
Spotters exist, too. If they get hit, or see you for too long, they call for reinforcements. If you let them; EVERYONE will come running at you. All enemies will raise shields, and you're in for some shit. You could take out the communications hub, which lengthens the time it takes for spotters to hit the alarm. And also reduces the amount of people that come running.
OH yeah. That raises panic walls, too. Panic Walls are walls that obstruct you, and lower for enemies. You can get flanked easily.

Soundtrack is fantastic, too. it's great. 
That's it, anymore characters will make this review too long. It's a good game; if you're interested in a somewhat thoughtful top-down shooter or a stressball, check this out. It's worth it. Just play with tank controls. AGRAV is fine with Screen Absolute.

EDIT: If I can fit these with the scant characters I have left, there's 3 factions. loyalists, highly militaristic, built to kill. CORVID, scavenger aesthetic. Junkers. All their stuff is made out of scrap or repurposed junk. And the Spacers. I think. They're all high tech. THey like floaty stuff, And lasers. All enemies have different weapons, different styles to play against, etc.

Example: Loyalists have repurposed Starship Torpedos as their suicide unit. Its slow, but it will not stop. if it hits you; you're dead. Goodbye. 
Corvid have tiny trucks that blend in with other enemies well. They're fast. don't have much HP, and they come in packs. Hard to spot. 
Spacers use these orb suicide mines, basically. I haven't met them yet, but I imagine they have good shields and are a mix between the swarmer suiciders and the beefy torpedoes.

In the latest update (it's still getting updates 5 years later) they added a bunch of BEEG mechs, some new pilots, and a few levels.

It also has some fun achievements, like mercing 10k civilians and the one with the TukTuk.

Two complaints. The last 3 levels were bad (terrible mechs/loadouts and a million suiciders). 3 of the new maps also have issues, like ""hey kid, here's some spicy grenades and a water pistol, go fight leviathans on a map the size of a postage stamp). They don't show off the BEEG mechs at all which is sad.

It also doesn't handle UI scaling properly (so if windows is configured for +125% ui on 1080p you'll get some weird lower resolution). Temporarily disabling UI scaling in windows fixes this.

Thankfully, if you don't care to keep banging on maps with bad loadouts, you can just turn on cheats to get past them (which also don't invalidate achievements, nice touch).

Maybe a Mechwarrior? Isometric 2D game, roam around in a vehicle, blow buildings up and trade missiles with roaming enemy tanks, that sort of thing? Brigador is here to scratch that long-lost itch with modern sensibilities, a spiritual backscratcher. The premise is simple: Great Leader is Dead, everybody is fighting for the city-state, you're a gun for hire. Clear the map of enemies or target buildings and survive, Brigador.

After a lengthy but fair set of tutorial missions Brigador tosses you in and expects you to perform. Learning to recognize enemy threats and how to recon the map are vital. Enemies come in three varieties and among them all are very dangerous threats, whether the short-ranged laser death-heads of the Spacers, the suicide bomber and heavy missiles of the Corvids or the irregular squads of Loyalists backed by heavy artillery. These aren't the only dangers but you get the idea, each faction has a not-all-encompassing preference and some specific entities, a sort of style and flavor. The more time you spend with Brigador the more you'll recognize the charmingly designed silhouettes and frames of the enemy vehicles instantly, ready to respond with appropriate target priorities.

Where Brigador excels is that each mission has a variety of pre-set crafts or you can free-style to earn money and blow off steam in the robots of your choice. Only occasionally will the single-player mode offer you a super-heavy to destroy all before you, yet the game will let you unlock and hop into a towering Rat King at your leisure, suited with duel Königs and a shockwave pulse, challenging the planet to throw everything it has at you. With the neatly done 2D pixel-style graphics and the ability to level everything you can see Brigador delivers on satisfaction in spades. Everything has an appropriate weight or lack of, if you like fast vehicles and anti-grav loadouts, hit and run tactics, even stealth. Yes, Brigador has a competent stealth system that neatly rewards you for minding your gun noise and enemy facing. A reliable short range weapon in the back at point blank will make you think you're playing a FPS stealth assassination game with the kills you achieve. Not only does Brigador satisfy but it satisfies in ways you wouldn't expect. Although every mission uses the same basic ideas and systems, the layouts are intricately crafted and ever-present dangers like the alarm systems make very few missions play out the same way, at least until you start trying to maximize your efficiency.

Things look good, the soundtrack is full of cyberpunk bangers, the gameplay is excellent and you can spend hours just trying out each individual gun. The vehicle roster is huge, ranging from easy-mode super heavies to hard-fighting ""brawlers"" to hit and run speedsters to balanced and sensible rigs and even all the way down to the reckless and suicidal. There's the killdozer, the party van, the literally a pick up truck with infinite turbo and x10 score multipler but dies in 1-2 hits. A long and varied campaign, dozens of freelance stages to pick with multiple modifiers and so many toys to play with makes Brigador last and last. Story is minimal, told almost exclusively through before-mission briefings. There is an extensive lore library to read including flavorful entries for every single weapon and vehicle in the game, including the enemies. Ignore or dive into as much of the setting as you like. 

Maybe the only thorns in the game are a bit of a rough learning curve in the mid-game, as the transition from the simple tutorial missions to understanding where and when to start fights can be tricky and lead to you being swarmed constantly. This doesn't pair well with the length of several stages and no mid-stage checkpoints. As well some of the campaign loadouts offered in the second half of the game are preposterous, being close to useless even if you fully embrace their gimmicks. Getting the full 100% in Brigador can be teeth-gnashingly hard, saddling you with a slow, weak mech with maybe 1-2 minor benefits on the longest, hardest missions in the game! Brigador can be on the much harder side of things, although virtually every mission will have at least 1-2 well put together options that can handle anything, even if they do involve outside the box(or your habits) play.

Brigador is arguably the best $10 game I've ever played. I was actually disappointed to be done with it. I wish I could press the Thumbs Up button twice as hard here.",1596385302,1596417274,True,1,0,0.502493798732757568,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After watching MandaloreGaming's review, however, I was sold.

In short, it's a game about heavy vehicles (mechs, tanks and antigravity hovercraft) blowing stuff up. We're talking about mechs stomping through urban centers, plowing through buildings and chewing through enemy vehicles with a hugely satisfying armory full of fun toys. What else do you need?

The game has a campaign in which most missions can be completed using different predetermined loadouts (vehicle, weapons and special abilities) allowing for a surprisingly large variety of playstyles and challenge levels. After that are the Freelance missions in which you can freely design your experience by creating a loadout from scratch by choosing your pilot (which determines the difficulty level), vehicle, your two weapons and your vehicle's special ability. The harder you make things for yourself the bigger the cash payout you will get.

And what do you use the cash for? Unlocking more pilots, vehicles, weapons and special abilities for the Freelance mode. And you also use the money to unlock lore.

And for a game about big machines blowing stuff up the lore is both surprisingly interesting and well-written. The world-building in Brigador is excellent and the lore is well worth purchasing.

What else is there to say? You've got big mechs, explosions, surprisingly interesting lore and explosions. Did I mention the explosions? Right, there's the soundtrack as well, which is a collection of absolute synthwave bangers that perfectly fit the game's action and aesthetic.

If anything above interests you at all then I highly recommend picking up Brigador.

Do be aware, though, that the game uses directional damage: vehicle's have less armour in the rear. The default control scheme moves your vehicle relative to the screen, which could result in you moving with your rear towards the enemy. As highly as I recommend the game I also recommend switching the controls to being relative to your vehicle (tank controls).",1595540883,1595540883,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The three different factions, Loyalist, Spacer, and Corvid, each have a unique style to their vehicles. Spacers are made from construction equipment, Loyalists have a more standard, modern military look, and the Corvid rebels have vehicles made from scrap metal and old cars. Past the factions, there are three types of vehicles: walkers, tanks, and aggravs. Walkers have the benefit of being able to stomp, tanks can rush through enemies and terrain, while aggravs have a stomp like walkers but also have much higher mobility (they can strafe).

The different combos of Faction, vehicle type, and weapons make for a ton of interesting playstyles. Whether you want a ton of armor or mobility or range, it's all there somewhere. Enemies can be ruthless on higher difficulties so it's very important to play smart and use all game systems.

Jokes aside this is a game I've genuinely enjoyed from start to finish although I haven't even gotten close to finishing. Plenty of stuff to unlock, an campaign which explains the controls, and introduces you to a variety of vehicle loadouts in order to ease you into the ""real"" game. Sparse on the lore when it needs to be, but if you're interested there's a lovingly crafted and interesting world behind it. Despite everything being 2d the game is absolutely gorgeous. I'm kind of a nitpicky asshole but holy shit I literally can't find anything to complain about here. I wanted to say at one point ""there's not enough stuff to unlock"" but... there honestly is, and freelance mode can potentially offer you many hours of entertainment.

I suppose the one bad thing about this game, is the control scheme shenanigans. The game comes preset with ""Screen Absolute"" which you can change to ""Relative"" which I absolutely suggest. Screen Absolute plays more like a twin stick shooter, but this is definitely not a twin stick shooter, as you can take more damage from the sides and back. Relative will feel wonky at first since wasd movement becomes relative to your vehicles direction, but I feel like it's absolutely better in every way. If you find Screen Absolute preferable on agravs, and Relative preferable on mechs and tanks you can set it to where agravs use Screen Absolute, and the later use Relative.
Genuinely good game however, would actually recommend.",1595221896,1595221896,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-Controls are a little weird, but you'll get the hang of them with an hour or two of play.

-Game sort of takes a Metroid Prime style approach with it's lore, surface level you just shoot shit but if you enjoy reading the little bits and blurbs about the people, technology, and setting there's a lot here to unlock, read and enjoy

-Visuals look great for what they are, audio is great, soundtrack is top notch. Go for the deluxe edition for the OST's and the audiobook that fleshes out the world of Brigador even more

Brigador is a LOT of fun, and initially plays as a dystopian/cyberpunk-y vehicle rampage simulator. There's a lot more depth to it than you first expect, and a wealth of well-written lore if you take the time to read it. Overall your job as a mercenary pilot (or Brigador) is to tear down the current dictatorship by any means necessary, and that generally includes a ton of property damage; everything can be destroyed except for the district walls. You won't be penalised if a railgun slug completely misses the target and flattens several houses instead, or if you sit back and carpet-bomb a whole base with howitzer rounds. Far from it! The more you blow up, the more you get paid.

You can choose from a sizeable roster of pilots (who function as difficulty modifiers) and pick from around +60 unique vehicles, like the aforementioned tuk-tuk (the most fragile vehicle possible) to towering military battle mechs or a ""tank"" that is literally a pile of scrapped cars that features the best horn in the game. You can then load up with a variety of weapons that go from the Bonesaw 8mm MG to the Harvester 300mm fuel-air siege howitzer. The arsenal is extensive and includes everything from simple machine guns to laser cannons, chemical gas munitions and railguns to the ""Audio-Kinetic Pulse"" projector that literally disintegrates everything in a 90 degree firing arc.   

Combat is challenging, fun, and allows a lot of freedom for different tactics; a stealthy approach with a suit of power armour and a silent radiation blaster may make things easier, but if you want to take a super-heavy tank armed with city-levelling, war-crime enabling weapons it's all fair game. It's worth noting that Brigador also uses a directional damage system, with vehicles having thicker armour at the front and weaker to the sides and rear, so you always need to be aware of where your enemies are! It really helps to change the control scheme immediately to Resolute too, as it makes handling of most vehicles much easier.

I'm really excited to see what the upcoming sequel Brigador Killers holds, as Brigador Up-Armoured Edition utterly blew me away.

The core gameplay loop never fails to get old: Brigador is one of those games that you create your own fun from the combinations of vehicles and weapons, going anywhere from 'just f*ck my sh*t up fam' in ultra-heavies with city killer cannons to playing Metal Gear Solid/Armour Hunter Mellowlink in fragile but effective power armour suits. The music I actually initially felt rather lukewarm towards but have grown into it: I think the game can work with a more.. intense soundtrack, and funnily enough the preview tracks for Brigador Killers totally satisfy that requirement for me. 
But the thing that really sealed the deal for me was the lore. Everything has its own entry and written in-universe in a very grounded way that can immerse you wholly into the world, if you let it work its magic. Even the drier, more technical (and not entirely technobabble!) entries you'd expect elsewhere (Efi) even has its own little quirks that makes them a joy to read. So much so that I have gotten into writing fan-lore myself, though whether if it's any good.. I'll let fellow community members to decide. You can read all of them in the fanmade brigador(dot)wikia(dot)com if you want to check them out yourself.

On top of all this, the game has mod support, though no Workshop support: you can find user made vehicles (all enemy vehicles previously unplayable are playable now thanks to our own modders! And then some OCs too), user made maps, an outrageously difficult difficulty upgrade mod named Hard Times, and so much more. Most of it are in the Modkit DLC but if you want them more up-to-date, the Discord server is the place to be.   
And of course Stellar Jockeys is one of the best communities I have been to. It's.. hard to describe but you can just join us and see for yourself.

It has a lot of depth, a cool artstyle and cyberpunk setting, and awesome music from Makeup And Vanity Set. It can also be brutal at times, both in its difficulty and in the ethical dilemmas it puts you in, as you'll find yourself leveling apartment complexes to get a better shot or gunning down crowds of people because there may be suicide bombers hiding out.

It might just look like a twin stick shooter, but this game is mechanically complex. Where your vehicle is facing affects how much damage you take, the speed and direction you're moving at affects accuracy and range, the loudness of your guns affects how far you can be before being noticed, your vehicles profile affects how easily noticed it is from a distance, and your movement type affects what speed and terrain you can traverse.

All of these variables, plus thoughtful map design make the game play like a real time tactical action game. Whether you're a huge mech or a tiny powersuit, if you charge in guns blazing, it's going to end badly. You have to have a plan of attack and think ahead in order to be successful. If you get caught out of position by destroying too many buildings or carelessly run out of ammo, or overextend, it can make for some desperate and intense firefights and some ridiculous moments like luring out and stomping a tank from behind with a powersuit because you ran out of ammo.

There's a lot of freedom in the maps and loadouts. A powersuit plays completely differently than a giant mech, but the weapons themselves can also drastically affect gameplay. You can play it stealthy with a powersuit and sneak up on enemies, or you can play it safe from a distance with smoke bombs + sniper rifles, or say fuck it and go with a multi chamber seige howitzer.

The campaign is very challenging and forces you to try out new loadouts with totally different playstyles. Freelance mode is a blast too since it gives you more replayability, a place to test out new loadouts, and its just fun to chill out and play a few freelance missions.

If you're looking for a hardcore stealth/strategy/action game, and are willing to learn the tank controls, Brigador is worth picking up.",1594697157,1666052103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Так вот, это правда. Хунта в панике, все понимают – диктатуре кирдык. Вопрос теперь только в том, кто урвет себе кусочек послаще. Тут-то в дело и вступаем мы. 
Я стакнулся с одной корпорацией, очень серьезные ребята. Они планируют взять город. Но сначала кто-то должен расчистить путь для вторжения. Главные цели – орбитальные зенитки, офицеры, подстанции, склады боеприпасов.
Им нужны хорошие пилоты, спецы по городскому бою. Драться придется в меньшинстве, так что диверсии и засады – наше все. Впрочем, что я тебе объясняю? Ты в этом деле дока.
Конечно, дельце рисковое, но хорошо оплачиваемое. Гонорары будут миллионные. Такой шанс выпадает раз в жизни, без шуток. Ты подумай, что лучше – тянуть лямку за гроши до пенсии или пошабашить одну ночь, и потом до конца жизни не работать?
Погоди, это еще не все. Я читал твое дело, и понял, что у тебя к работе… творческий подход. Как там написано? «Моральный релятивизм, граничащий с социопатией». Искусство требует жертв, так? А теперь представь Соло-Нобре. Никакой отчетности за пределами основного задания. Корпорации нужна земля, а не домишки и людишки. Если случайно развалишь пару кварталов или там прибьешь десяток пешеходов, никто не заплачет. Даже, наверное, выплатят бонус: с чувством юмора у этих ребят все в порядке.
Как и со снабжением. Я мельком пробежался по списку доступных машин. У них есть плюс-минус все – меки любых моделей, танки, башни на колесах, антигравы, экзоскелеты, даже пара доисторических мопедов завалялась для искушенных мсье.
Да погоди ты, я как раз собирался про арсенал рассказать! Какой художник без кистей? У них на складах горы классики типа мортир и гаубиц, но по случаю подвезли немало добра, запрещенного во внешних колониях. Какое именно? Да всякое – газометы, бомбы объемного взрыва, гамма-излучатели…  
Ага, сразу глазенки загорелись! Чувствую, сработаемся. Значит, буду на тебя рассчитывать, бригадор. Корпорация даст отмашку со дня на день, так что приготовься. Вечером вышлю тебе твой контракт.

Минусы не так значительны, их почти не имеется.
Лучше напишу о других минусах, а точнее, пожеланиях. Всё то, что могло бы сделать игру ещё лучше.

#Мультиплеер. В такой шикарной игре он просто обязан быть, но его нет.
(Вместо этого пилят точно такую же игру, особых отличий я пока в ней не вижу.)

#Генератор Карт. Набор карт от создателей есть, бесплатный редактор есть (которым наверное пользуются единицы), но что если в такой простенькой игре появится генератор местности? Бесконечные вариации это круто.

#Контент. С ним проблем нет. Кроме одного но. Маловато разных объектов на карте. Со временем они быстро приедаются. Для такой простенькой в плане геймплея игры это простительно, но немного жаль...

#Режимы Игры. Я бы не прочь увидеть в такой игре всякие арены-дезматчи, захваты точек и захват флага,  удержание территорий и прочее-прочее-прочее.

#Открытый Мир. Такие крутые мегаполисы, и нет открытого мира, одни малюсенькие локации, айайай. Столько потенциала шикарной игры пропадает впустую. Хотелось бы не просто районы, с трэшаковым убей всех и забрось, это можно было бы превратить в полноценный MMORPG, на подобие Fallout в мире мехов. (Да, я знаю, такого не будет).

#Масштабирование. В такой крутой игре такая крутая фишка просто обязана быть. Не брать же с собою лупу, что бы рассмотреть всё великолепие игры, разработчики оплошали.

#Карта. В такой цветастой игре определять направление по меткам, которые ещё и вечно мельтешат на экране, по моему не очень удобно. Да и знать что где по карте намного удобнее.

#ИЗ ЭТОЙ ИГРЫ УЖЕ МОЖНО СТРАТЕГИЮ ДЕЛАТЬ! Куча разных юнитов и вооружения, разрушаемость зданий, ах и ох, как тут не хватает стратегии.

Its a twin stick shooter alright, with a lot of tactical/strategic fluff around it. It looks *gorgeous*! Soundtrack is awesome.

However, after 5 hours in, about half the campaign and few freelance missions, some equipment unlocks & all - I am still not quite sure whether I like this game or not.

I miss a sense of progression, I think. Pilots, vehicles and weapons, they all cost about the same, and with one mission you'll be able to unlock few... so I figure, once you find a working combo, you'll likely stick with it and just wreak havoc. But - at least in my playtime - I haven't really gotten the feeling of having to work the contracts to get the money, to unlock real showstoppers. I can pretty much unlock everything I want, which makes me wonder why should I even bother unlocking it. There's no increasing sums of money you need to pay for better weapons - there aren't ""better"" weapons to begin with, its all about how you want to configure it. There's no gating mechanism except money, but as I said - you earn a lot and you can easily unlock enough gear after a single mission.

This is the most confusing part of the game, for me.

The action itself is really awesome, and its not just mindless pounding. Directions matter, armour matters, visibility matters, your specials matter. Heck, your outfit will determine whether you die in seconds or just blast through with your mind half on autopilot.

Its a weird title. I bought it, refunded it, bought it again. I really wish I love it more, and I wonder if I will if I play it longer.",1594412502,1594412502,True,1,0,0.508908867835998535,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's definitely the sort of game you'll know if you'll like just by looking at it - you control various big war machines and you stomp around destructible environments, shredding through hordes of enemies with an entertaining array of sci-fi weaponry. The destruction is suitably chunky, all the vehicles feel exactly like they should, and the map, enemy and weapon variety keeps it fresh for quite a while. 

The biggest flaw with the game is the lack of specialized objectives.  You'll essentially always be destroying one of three or four structures, killing a certain number of enemies or killing special marked targets. I would have loved to see some levels that more directly encourage stealth, overzealous aggression or the unusual use of certain vehicles/weapons. 

This isn't that big of a deal though, because the main dish is still the combat - and it's always great. Brigador has two key components that keep the combat engaging for longer than expected. First - aiming has a height element, so you can overshoot shorter units if your guns are too tall, which forces you to pay a lot more attention to where your cursor is rather than just fire-and-forget. Second, enemy units drop shield and ammunition on death, but the former decays after a short time and the latter can be destroyed. Combine this with the enormous range of specialized units, height-based cover & environmental hazards and you get a fairly elaborate dance of balancing target priority, extreme aggression and careful decision-making. Brigador rewards the player that goes in deeper than they should, but only if they know what they're getting into. Knowing who to kill first and how long that takes is key to surviving, and if you play your cards right you will survive, even in the most absurdly lopsided encounters. 

There's also always the stealth option, even if the game never directly forces you to do it. Enemies seem to have both a sightline and hearing - so picking the shortest mech with the quietest weapon gives you the best shot at avoiding them. There's an active equipment that can make you invisible for a short time to further encourage this style of play. Each faction also has several spotter units, some of which are tall enough to see over cover. If the alarm is raised, huge walls will appear all over the map, and a large group of enemy units will converge on your last known position. Unfortunately, not all maps are suited to this playstyle, but there are enough that allow it. 

The only other thing I want to complain about is the new-ish F-series campaign missions, because holy SHIT do they ramp up the difficulty. There's one for each enemy faction, and the unit options in conjunction with the fact that each of them has about five trillion enemy units makes them an actual headache to beat. They aren't bad per-se, but they're way, way harder than anything else up until that point. 

In terms of variety, the game has 46 missions in the main campaign of varying difficulty - each will give you a selection of between 1 and 4 vehicles with set loadouts. Usually, the first vehicle is the most powerful, with the alternate options encouraging increasingly careful or stealthy approaches to objectives. This is already enough, but Brigador also has freelance mode, which is a pseudo-roguelike with insane customization. There's 35 pilots, 68 vehicles and 44 weapons. Everything needs to be unlocked with money, but it's really easy to make it fast - pilots & vehicles have income modifiers, which can allow you to make >100mil in a single mission pretty easily. Freelance missions are grouped into ""operations"" with several new maps not seen in the campaign. Their difficulty is based on the pilot you choose at the start. 

As for the misc stuff - sound and visual design are top notch. The vehicles are loud and threatening (and they all have horns, too!), the guns rattle, the lasers pulse, etc... Everything sounds great. The music is a fantastic cyberpunk-synthwave mishmash that's a lot more upbeat than I expected it to be. It generally seems to react to your play as well, which endears me to it even more. The visuals are honestly incredible - there's so much minute detail in every tile that I couldn't tell if they were repeating assets, even by the end of the campaign. 

The story is kind-of pushed to the wayside, but if you read the logs it really is quite interesting. Regime changes in the face of a large power vacuum & a curious exploration of the ""lesser of two evils"" wherein every single option is probably a bad choice. Basically - moral ambiguity: the game. Considering you'll spend most of your time with Brigador stomping civilians into paste, this isn't much of a surprise. 

tl;dr - Brigador is a good mech game with a shit-ton of variety. Get it if you like big robots, big guns, loud noises and war crimes.",1594404090,1594404090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is a total blast - while there's not too much variety in what you do in this game, there's plenty of variety in the way you go about it, with a bunch of vehicles and devastating weapons to unlock. You can opt for a brutal all-out assault with a heavy mech loaded up with destructive artillery to lay waste to everything in your way, or you can opt for a smaller, faster vehicle and use hit-and-run tactics to accomplish the mission objectives while evading enemy patrols, or anything in between those two extremes. If you opt to take the challenge of taking on missions with smaller, weaker vehicles the game will award you extra for it if you succeed, meaning that challenge runs that test your abilities are encouraged. The environment is a big part of your strategy no matter what - everything is destructible but not to the same extent, and part of the challenge is finding the spots in the landscape and enemy fortifications that your vehicle can easily barge through or blast through with its weapons without getting bogged down long enough for you to get swarmed by enemies.

The visuals in this are really impressive, with some of the most detailed 2D spritework that you're ever likely to see, complete with really detailed lighting. I'm not sure how they managed to get it to work the way they did but the effect is stunning. It only makes the total destructibility of the map even more impressive - even the rubble that gets left in the wake of your rampage is absurdly detailed. The various vehicles you can use mostly have some really unique designs, divided between three factions that each have their own design philosophies, and the weapons can get seriously visually impressive when you're blasting away with full firepower. Overall it's an insanely good looking game, whose cyberpunk-esque visuals enhanced by a fitting musical score that's equally as impressive.

The game's not heavy on story - you take up the role of various mercenaries being paid by a corporation to assist their regime change efforts on a colony planet called Solo Nobre in some place in the distant future, and there really isn't any more plot to it than that. The game is however quite heavy on lore that you can unlock as you play, and it's really well-written and fun to read, with entries dripping with dark humour. That's the tone of the whole game really, there are no good guys in the world, especially not you, the player. You actually get paid extra for collateral damage, even if that's running over a civilian in a tank or flattening an apartment block. I guess this game might not be for you if that sounds like it'd trouble you, but it's fine so long as you don't take the game too seriously, it clearly wasn't meant to be read that way.

Overall this a great game to just pick up and blow off some steam, you can finish most maps within a few minutes. There are campaign missions with set choices of vehicles to use that are good for learning how to play, but the main mode is the Freelance mode which lets you freely choose a combination of sequences of maps to play on and the vehicle loadout you'll challenge them with, with an additional choice of picking a pilot which adds some additional modifiers to your run. Apart from buying lore entries, you spend the money that you earn while playing to unlock more stuff for this mode, and there's quite a lot to get, although the game's generous enough with cash that it doesn't feel like a chore. At the end of the day this is an easy sell, it's easy to pick up and get into and accomplishes pretty much everything it set out to do without any major flaws to point out.",1594369659,1594369659,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

今の今になってようやく慣れてきました。
それでも低難易度キャラ（大体５まで）ぐらいでしかまともにクリアできませんが…

外周の壁以外の建物すべて破壊し尽せるゲーム。かと言って最強ロボットに乗り込んで破壊の限りを尽くす事ができるかと言えば別にそういう訳ではない。調子乗ってるとボコられるので注意。
二脚型・戦車型・ホバークラフト型の三つの種類から豊富なユニットを選び、二つの装備と一つのアビリティを組み合わせれるのだが、一部の武器の癖が強過ぎて慣れるのに一苦労。しかし使いこなせれればかなり便利な兵器になるのは間違いない。自分にとってこれが一番使いやすい！という武器を探し当てよう。

キャンペーンは機体も武器も固定で割とさっくり遊べる。
本番はフリーランス。フリーランスの出撃で稼いだ金で様々なキャラ、ユニット、武器、情報、ステージをアンロックしてまた出撃しての繰り返し。
キャラ（パイロット）は難易度と報酬に影響する。最初は難易度低いが徐々に高くなり、最初の難易度・上がる難易度が高い程高報酬が基本形だが、
最初から一定の難易度で固定するキャラも居れば、逆に最大難易度から始まって徐々に下がるキャラ、難易度最低どころか敵対ユニットが全くでないデストロイモードだけど報酬は１０％しかもらえないキャラ等、顔面含め個性溢れるキャラばかり。
お気に入りを見つけておけばモチベーションも上がるというもの。

外周以外すべて破壊できるものの、アビリティで破壊音波を選ばない限り、全部破壊は難しい。爆発する建物は近接攻撃で破壊すると自機に致命傷レベルのダメージを喰らう。目標建物だけでなく、ガソリンスタンド等の小物も爆発する事もある。戦車型だと移動＝近接攻撃になってるので迂闊に移動すると大惨事になる。
またＭＡＰが広く、チマチマ破壊してると単純に時間がかかる。
近接攻撃が強く重武装が出来るユニットは足が遅く、足が速いユニットは重武装を持てず近接攻撃も弱い。
どこを妥協するかによってプレイスタイルもある程度変えれる。建物破壊特化にしても良いしユニット撃破特化にしても良い。
低難易度はそこまで強いユニットがでないので建物破壊にある程度特化するとストレス発散になるよ！

爆発するとそこに敵が集まったり、レーダーユニットに捕捉されてサイレン鳴らされるとＭＡＰ中の敵が全員群がったりと、ステルスゲーム要素の側面も持つ。ご丁寧に武器の発射音の大きさも設定されてるので、難しいがステルスプレイも可能と言えば可能。

フリーランスで気軽に出撃できる為、結構長く遊べるタイプのゲーム。
設定もかなり凝っており、そういうのを調べるのだけでも結構楽しい。
興味がない人でもストレス発散用に如何でしょうか。",1594145949,1606472909,True,5,0,0.597303032875061035,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It was well worth the price of admission, the graphics are amazing and there's something very cathartic about destroying the entire map leaving nothing but rubble behind you and the carcasses of the enemy just to storm into the next township to do it all again.

This, the United States Cum Vault (USCV), is one the United State’s greatest contributions to the modern day and is deeply rooted in the average American psyche. The Cum Vault, while enormous (approximately 127 feet (39 meters) tall, and 120 feet (37 meters) long on each side, for a combined total of 228,600 cubic feet with a translatable volume of 26 million gallons (3.3 billion ounces)), is only currently about half full and its value, both monetarily and culturally, is priceless. The United States Cum Vault is a jungle juice of all the presidents of the United State’s cum (living and dead, except President Chaunchy, the cursed-president who was regrettably cursed with brittleness). Of the 26 million gallons housed in the cum vault, most presidents have only contributed on average 1 gallon (3.8 liters) over their typical 4 year terms, there are some notable outliers in their ejaculate donation: 

(10th) President John Tyler: 15 million gallons of cum (57.7% of the cum vault)
(19th) President Rutherford B. Hayes: 12.9 million gallons of spermatozoa (48.6%)
(12th) Jordan Ross Belfort: .5 million gallons of spunk 
(9th) President William Henry Harrison: .3 million gallons of presidential payload 

While John Tyler was only in office for 30 days he produced 5,000,000 gallons of cum each day until his death, he accounts for over 57.7% of the cum vault reserve. His death is assumed to be completely unrelated to his cum production. Equally strange is that I included one fake President, Rutherford B. Hayes, and if you did not immediately realize that you are not a true American and the deathsquads are on their way. Also, the real fake one was Jordan Ross Belfort and now the deathsquads are going to kill your pets first. 

Obviously, the Cum Vault has only ever been breached in one attack. This attack in 1890, sanctioned by the Free Cum Society, is an attack that has forever left a figurative scar on the American people and a literal scar in the form of a non-water cum flood that killed and impregnated every living thing from Fort Knox to Louisville, Kentucky. This cum was so viscous that many Americans were trapped in pseudo-stassis under the cum, until starvation, as none could reach them in what became known as “cum-man’s land”. The 40 cubic miles of untraversable ground has only recently been once again accessible by the American citizenry. Cum-man’s land is now the home of scavengers, private military companies, and the ever so rumored creature born from the president’s cum (like the cryptid presidential spunk-spawned hog-men, rumored to feed on the flesh of man and consume their memories). Those humans that survived and bore children from the impregnation of the cum tidal wave have had their children classified as lower citizens in America’s caste system, or their children were summarily executed for their powerful familial claim to the United States.

Anyway, the cum vault reminds me a lot of Brigador. Both have an epic tale that includes mechs, civilian deaths in untold numbers, horrifying implications of the state of mankind, and cum. 9/10

 The visuals and lighting are amazing. They paint a wonderful scene when there's rounds flying through the air, citizens disintegrating into giblets, lasers crackling across the street, treadbikes whirring by under a hail of cannon fire, buildings being shattered into a million little pieces, and a horde of war machines closing in on you. 

In the quieter moments, it's easier to appreciate just how detailed everything is, and how the ""theme"" of each area is carried across. In the denser urban areas, you have tons of buildings crammed together with gas stations and convenience stores around every corner. The ""upper crust"" areas by contrast are dominated by wide-open spaces, strangely pervasive golf courses, and single mansions that are as big as, if not bigger than, the apartment blocks you blow apart in other areas. There's also a bunch of more industrial areas, and even some maps that have you running around out in the boonies stomping through shanty towns. The difference in architecture, layout, and terrain in these areas is complimented by different colors and intensities of lighting in each area as well, dependent upon what kind of lighting you'd normally expect to see in such a place. The densely crowded urban areas, for example, have street lamps everywhere.

The visual effects of firing the weapons also have an impressive amount of detail put into them as well. Weapons of similar class and size will still have different ""projectiles"" on screen. The best demonstration of this would be the laser weapons. Just look at the Black Hand compared to any of the other laser weapons. 

The vehicle designs deserve their own review entirely. I'll keep it short and just say that the three different factions each have a unique and well-realized style. And the detail with which they're represented makes all of them feel very real.  This takes on a whole other dimension if you read the novel tied into this game, which I would recommend if you're into any kind of military sci-fi.

The music in this game is good enough to justify the vinyl release of the soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set. It fits the atmosphere of the cityscapes and in an odd way, the cold brutality of the gameplay perfectly.

I'd be silly not to mention that the weapons by and large have a good, satisfying report when fired. Again, there's been enough attention paid to keep them detailed and distinct from each other. And the sounds do a wonderful job of suggesting the relevant level of carnage caused by each weapon all on their own. Just fire the Banshee with your eyes closed and try to imagine anything else but the complete obliteration that follows it.

Finally, most importantly, the gameplay. It's good. It can be repetitive, if you let it, but Brigador's biggest strength is probably in experimentation. I've spent much more time in freelance than in the campaign (which I have yet to finish). With the freelance mode, you control the difficulty, your loadout, and the locales. There's such a wide variety in the first two options that you can end up playing a very different game from one run to the next. Play a low or medium difficulty with an ultra class vehicle outfitted with some heavy ordinance, and you'll have an autopilot power-trip of sheer destruction. Play on a higher difficulty in a mog (powersuit), and it's suddenly a stealth game. A stealth game that benefits heavily from the destructible terrain, allowing you to ambush one group of enemies from behind, before they've had a chance to raise their shields, then carve a path through a block of office buildings to get away before their friends arrive to investigate the noise. 

In the right circumstances, all of these elements can synchronize to achieve something in Brigador that generally is only achieved by sim games. It can give you some of that ""weightiness"" of actually trying to pilot one of these vehicles. It makes it feel about as real as what an honestly, fairly arcadey game can.",1593958716,1593958716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's great fun.

It's all highly customizable. Of course, the more difficult you make it out, the more cash you earn in the end.

Basically, the campaign is an introduction to the game and gives you some predetermined loadouts, as well as a big wad of money, to play with in preparation for the Freelancer mode. I'm still going through it right now, I'll be honest.

There's a lot to like here. The lore is very extensive, with even an audiobook on separated purchase. The music, by Make-up and Vanity Set, is phenomenal. The visuals are really nice too. While the controls - in Relative mode at least - are taking some time to get used to, once you DO get used to it, it's very fun.

And there is also this nice, cozy satisfaction to urge every once in a while in wanton destruction of everyone and everything in sight. It IS a Cyberpunk universe after all. You're not playing as the good guys here, just another mercenary contracted to wreck stuff up. Embrace it, and go ham.

My first review on Brigador was a part of the Mandalore review boom and didn't have a loot to say on the actual game, except for the sheer amazement I have felt when playing this game ffor the first time. 
Hower, not that the novelty has worn off, I would still recommend it to both anyone interested in a stress-relief piece of entartainment and someone who enjoys a game with a lot of depth besides the surprisingly decent combat system. 

--------- The Combat ----------
I think that this is the first and most impportant subject to touch when speaking about Brigador. The thing is that, despite playing a lot like a top-down shooter, the game feels a lot like a CRPG in real time with a single powerful unit as a fine substitute for a whole team. This is first and foremost a mech game and even though some targets will definitely test your aiming skills (Smaller enemy Agravs require precise aiming to bring down, while moving the fastest and most of your weaponry being projectiles), the most powerful threats are actually really hard to miss. 
Therefore most of fights, while being quick and unforgiving, are mostly decided by your usage of the many different options your warmachine possesses. Moving or hunkering down as a mech, manipulating your surroundings through the sheer destructive power of a stomp or a ram of tanks, the versatile movement options of agravs, and those are just the basics they teach you first in the tutorial mission. In Brigador the battlefield is up for you to change, carefully managing time in a fight or sound outside of it. 
Everything besices the map bondaries is there for either cover or destruction and combat changes drastically between open areas and city streets. 

--------- The Variety ----------
There are a lot of enemy types and a lot of ways to make them go away. In Brigador you have two weapon mounts on a big roaster of different machines and certain weapon classes, ranging from SML as the smallest to HVY as the biggest. There are a lot of quirky ones in all the classes and even some of the most standard have enough flavor for you to unerstand the enemy arsenal in a chaotic fight. Your layout of weapons, the powerful additional equipment,  the class of the machine, the surroundings and the specific enemies you face all force you into building strategies and making quick tactical choices. 
The enemies cannot be described solely based on their faction as all of them have their own flawor of weaponry and machines, however in broad strokes the Loyalists are sporting the best long range weaponry, the Corvids are the quickest and the Spacers will force you to move out of your cover with devastating close raange capabilities and artillery. Specifically the Harvester cluster shells, which are absolutely terrifying (you can equip one, btw). Yet, all of them have units that can do other things but the faction-specific stuff. Like the Ratking of Corvids is slow and fires twin autocannons with a cyclic rate of GAU-8 (basically, clouds of big fucking shells) or railgun tanks of Spacers that have one of the rare long range hitscan weapons. 
To finish up this point, I'm sure that there is more than enough content to keep you going. 

---------- The Lore ------------
I was amazed at the amount of lore this game has and I still am. A half of the game's Aquisitions section is just lore, a lot of flavor and some pretty meaningful stuff. And most of it is just 100k ingame dollars, which is seriously not even a price in Brigador.
More than that, in Steam you can get yourself both the soundtrack (it's seriously good, RUINER tier good) and a Brigador Audiobook. Surprisingly, the book is fucking amazing and really makes you a fan of this brutal universe if you were not already. It's a deep story about struggling to follow ideologies in the face of overwhelming violence, the primal lust for power and even sporting some serious fear of the unknown (not fear per se, but an uncanny feeling of someone else, someone powerful and incomprehensable coming to your home to burn it to the ground). 
It kinda elevates Brigador above most of the other mech games for me. 

----------- The Conclusion ------------
The game had a bad launch but its a hidden gem. A polished, shining but hidden among countless other games that might appear simular but could never compare to Brigador. And at least here in Russia it has a really modest price for hours and hours of content you'll be getting.

Hey hey people, Eugenius here.

Today we're gonna be reviewing Brigador — a cult classic released [strike]by Westwood studios in 1996. I once enjoyed it as a child, and now i return to it as a machild[/strike] wrong script, it was released by Stellar Jockeys four years ago actually. Anyway,

[b]STORY:[/b]
The game takes place on Solo Nobre — a mining colony on a remote planet of Novo Solo. Many years ago local [i]ancien regime[/i] of trans-planetary corporations was overthrown in violent [i]coup d'etat[/i] by the Great Leader. Following these events, a global state planned economy was established in a Great Leader's effort to build well-defended socialism on single planet. His iron fisted rule, however, was not exactly well received by large swaths of population, leading society to split in two factions immediately after his death. These are:
— Loyalists – devouted stalinists belonging to NEP party and striving to maintain political legacy of Great Leader, and
— Corvids – followers of Mikhail Bakunin, who despise state, vanguardism, proletarian dictatorship and central banks

Their internal struggle is quickly joined by SNC — [i]independent[/i] think-tank promoting neoclassic economic thought and return of rightful corporate overlords on Novo Solo. And SNC wants you to perform dirty work for them, offering you brigador contract. This is not a joke by the way, they wrote an actual corporate document that can be accessed in-game. Take a look at this excerpt:

[i]...
ARTICLE 5: OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY
5.01. Company agrees to assume no liability for any Contractor actions, damages inflicted by Contractor, or damages inflicted upon Contractor (both physical and emotional) in pursuing the Agreement.
5.02. Company will comply with all reasonable requests of Contractor necessary to the performance of Contractor's duties under this Agreement levied prior to Contractor deployment.
5.03. Company agrees to sever all contact with and deny all knowledge of Contractor pursuant Contractor engaging in actions identifiable in any way as being in connection with the Company.
...[/i]

Under its terms SNC promises to deliver vehicles, weapons and other equipment, as well as shield you from any legal liability, while asking you to return ""Asset"" (with ""Asset"" being ""entire Novo Solo planet"") back to their hands by launching several military operations against local groups. With that you begin.

[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]
It is very good. The game drops you to the battlefield, giving objective to destroy certain targets. It will take you a minute or less, however, to realise that every single thing you see is destructible. And in corporate world destruction of hostile means of production somehow means profit coming your way. A lot of profit. And you will spend every dollar to unlock new equipment. Which is great by the way — every single vehicle comes with three slots allowing you to install various weapons ranging from machineguns... that can't even hit a target at close range... to absolutely disgusting cluster bombs. Vehicle roster gives you a wide selection of:
— Walkers – slow, easy to hit, tanky, and
— Anything else... I... haven't actually played game for this long, i think you would have to check it yourself.

These can be used not only by you, but also by numerous opponents, who will try to find and swarm you from several directions using some sick squad AI. While easy to [i]debate[/i] with at first glance, they will get bigger [i]arguments[/i] on later levels, allowing them to DESTROY your position and thus undermine civil discourse on Novo Solo even further. That is unless you are prepared to stay out of their line of sight, launch surprise attacks and use smoke grenades to hide your presence.

And if vehicles are [b]somehow[/b] not enough for your taste, you get pilots. Just take a good look at them... Yes, they look exactly like they just came out from serving prison sentence for aggravated crimes against humanity.

Flexible controls (which you should immediately change to ""Relative"") allow you to easily maneuver through the battlefield. With some easy-to-do micro you can even dodge hostile shots. Shooting, however, requires high precision — while it's not obvious upon first sight, the space you are playing in is 3D, and projectiles are launched [b]exactly[/b] from the point of the gun, giving you [i]fun[/i] ability to miss the target you were specifically aiming at due to your weapon being offset from central axis of your turret, and then to die to utter nonsense. 

[b]GRAPHICS:[/b]
To put it simply, it's great. That's it. What else do you expect, it's not a script of an actual merchant video review. You have trailer above, you saw it right? If you want more, go to Youtube. I believe one popular channel had a good review on it. Its name was something related to star wars. Maybe GunganGaming, if i recall correctly.

[b]SCORE:[/b]
Despite barely playing it, I give this game a final objective score of
[b]Precursor James' acquisition cost out of Bonesaw's chance to hit infantry[/b]

Thoroughly recommended. Go play it. I certainly will.

This review [b]was not[/b] bankrolled by Brigador Promotion Guild. While most unfortunate, it means, however, that its objectivity and total lack of bias are guaranteed.

The vehicles just feel amazing. The mobility is responsive & agile.  I'd strongly recommend switching the default Absolute settings to Relative as it grants far more fidelity in control.

Environmental destructiblity is super-impressive. Last time I remember having this much fun just leveling everything was years and years ago in Red Faction: Guerilla. It's super satisfying and also nets you bonus cash on Mission Debrief.

Music is pretty glorious if you have an appreciation for thick, heavy synth. Varies in tone from background to pumping and I'm really glad I got the soundtrack edition. Catchy stuff. Lore is pretty dense too. Mostly comes in the form of a Codex that you pay to unlock piecemeal. Strange but the prices are fair and I'd venture that it obliges the player to invest in reading the material as you're paying for it with the money you earn. Very well written.

But that seems like how the game's economy works on a broader scale. You pay to unlock pilots, vehicles, Freelance missions, etc. Seems intelligently integrated as a system overall in that it always keeps bread-crumbing you along with fresh new unlocks.

So all in all it feels like a really comprehensive package that's put together with care. Gameplay feels great with an awesome audio/visual suite and all the trimmings feel smartly integrated. Big ups.",1593895117,1593895117,True,7,0,0.606875240802764893,0,True,False,False,False,,,

you stumble out of the flash from the pilot requisition
which brings you to a tron-like loading area with other
pilots waiting. Three classes of vehicles to select are
in front of you, the gigantic bipedal machine has its pilot 
hatch open, beckoning you to a revolutionary war of
mechs, ladies, and 1980s.

[b] BRIGADOR - UP-ARMORED EDITION.[/b]

Synth background music pulses quietly at first, tracking
with your every move as you navigate the loadouts
and equip your war machine- be it towering mech, a
no-nonsense battletank or a hastily-converted civilian
hovercar which prioritizes speed over armor- with the
top-off-the-shelf weaponry of this near-future city. 

Where it may be taking place is irrelevant- know that
[b]Great Leader[/b] is dead, and [b]Solo Nobre[/b] must fall. You are
welcomed as a [b]Brigador[/b], a tireless warrior who will help
ignite the spark of revolution in this merciless city of the
future, gripped in tyranny by the would-be heirs of the
Great Leader.

So you tighten the controls after you've come from the
travels that have brought you here to Solo Nobre. As
the machine marches to life and engages enemy forces
in battle, you are encouraged to level anything and
everything in your path- buildings, scaffolding, trees
and replenishing ammo depots are not safe from your
rampage in the name of revolution. 

The retro-inspired pixel tapestry of the city blurs
as you escalate after switching out pilots and weapon
loadouts to better suit your mission of righteous civil 
disobedience. You hope that all this will come to an end, 
but you know the soundtrack only stops when either the 
opposing force or you are dead, where until then, Miami 
and instrumental power ballads will carry you to the very
gates of bullet-riddled Valhalla to see her. 

The woman you loved solar systems away, whom you 
failed to protect. You've been a spacer and gone to 
worlds beyond imagining, beyond death, and now you 
fight a war you cannot hope to win as odds stack higher,
the credits payout too impossible to ignore. The risk of
death grows with each mission, and the thrill of falling,
of forgetting your failure that led you to Solo Nobre is
too good of a kick the war machine cannot even buck.

The levels grind and churn you through a gauntlet of
ruthless metal and blood. It is a hermit-kingdom city,
this Solo Nobre; where a man's life is worth 50 credits
but a flower bed's destruction is worth twice as much.
With every instance of mayhem, you are a step closer
to fulfilling your respective contracts for benefactors
which reward you with varying payouts, perpetuating
the seemingly endless cycle of money, weapons, the
need to upgrade and the endless head-bopping action
of the retro synth music of the 1980s.

Your hands shudder as they struggle to let go of the
pilot controls, but the [b]Precursor James[/b] - a mythical 
figure who is rumored to be an undead pilot, beckons
you to battle again. The revolution requires a rallying
point, the tip of the spear, the spark of sacrifice.

[i]""On this day, we need you, Brigador.""[/i]

You grit your teeth and fight the pain of emptiness
away, trying to block out futile memories of her
love never meant to be. [i]""Summer. Samara-""[/i] You
begin, but the pilots call out over comms chatter
before static cuts in, and Precursor James removes
his mask and says the words that signal your return
to the fight. As you hear these familiar words that
has become the unspoken mantra, you know the
spaceport and that ticket offworld can wait.

[i]""Great Leader is dead. 

Solo Nobre must fall.

Welcome, Brigador.""[/i]

PROS:
- Tons of meaningful customization. Pick vehicle, weapons, tac gear, difficulty, operation length.
- Exceptional creativity with loadouts. Mix of conventional and unique weapon systems.
- Tons of gameplay options. Loud/Quiet. Fast/Heavy. Long/Short, Low/High Risk, etc.
- Gorgeous level design and layouts.
- Deep, well written lore.
- Thumping, yet somber electronic soundtrack sets tone beautifully.
- Little touches breathe life into setting (Unique vehicle horns. Vehicle facing affects shield efficiency. High RoF weapons can slow your vehicle down while firing, etc).

ONLY CON:
- Can't save operation progress. For long ops, if you don't have the time, can't commit war crimes.

NITPICKs:
- AI fairly basic. Missed opportunity to have them approach situations tactically.
- Campaign little more than tutorial. Could have drip fed more lore.
- Default control scheme works against you, but can easily be switched (facing matters).

Recommend To:
- Fans of mech games.
- Fans of isometric action games.
- Fans of gritty war fiction.
- Anyone looking for an immersive, tactical experience that requires planning, adaptation, and the willingness to leave a Steam game running in the background when life calls.",1593803954,1593804096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In contrast, smaller, faster vehicles like the Rope Kid are less destructive, meaning the maps start to become more hazardous - walls matter a lot more when you can't drive through them.

While the game always has slight stealth mechanics (lookout enemies that trigger alarms, increased damage to the back of enemies), these can be made much more vital with some loadouts, like slow, fragile powersuits.

If the flow seems a bit weird, I recommend you apply his voice to this review in parts, especially towards the end.

Don't Buy If:[list]You're looking for an uninspired rehash twin stick shooter, it is not. Nor was it officially advertised as such IIRC.[*]You are looking for a MechWarrior clone.[*]If you're looking for a Binding of Isaac clone *gag*.[*]If originality is a hobgoblin to your mind.[*]If you don't want an excellent game that's got complex, but natural controls that have a learning curve.[/list]

Do Buy If: [list][*]You want a destroy everything but don't be reckless or you're dead simulator.[*]You understand that this isn't a twin stick shooter despite the devs having to tweak the settings to allow it to play a bit like one to appease those who automatically assumed it'd be another twin stick shooter skin.[*]You want to play a game that's very unforgiving, but is an excellent challenge and feels very rewarding.[*]You want an original game that's difficult to draw comparisons to as it's just that... ORIGINAL.[*]If you like real time tactics and can appreciate the achieved technical ingenuity behind the game's many excellent mechanics. Want to go into a mission shooting everything in sight? Be prepared to alert every enemy in a wide area to your location and expect to have according difficulties with a relentless AI that can hear your shots, can competently track you once spotted, and invariably cause your demise as, in this game, even tanks can be lethal (as they should be). [/list]

TBH, there's a bit of sarcasm & :steamsalty: above, not because of the game itself, but because of how it bombed on launch due to no actual issue of its own. A lot of people bought it thinking ""Oh! Another twinstick shooter in a market over-saturated with twinstick shooters!"" and bought the game. Tried playing it and then realized it wasn't only to refund the game due to ""horrible controls"". If by horrible controls one says so because the original defaults were meant to play like the original game it is and NOT a twinstick shooter, well, that's not the games fault. This isn't to say that the controls don't need getting used to, they do, however, that's a part of the game itself, anyone who has play a MechWarrior game might understand how much precision can be gained by incorporating controls that allow torso swivel on mech and, though as stated previously, this isn't a MechWarrior clone, someone who comes from that franchise might find it easier to adapt to this game a bit easier. That said. I feel bad for the devs whose labor of passion bombed due to misconstrued assumptions that were opposite to the concept they crafted. It's a damn good game and you can tell that once you boot it up.

There are, I think, about 60 different vessels of destruction you can play with in the game. Though the game is isometric 2D, the models are beautiful and have extremely fluid animations no matter which way you turn. Everything yells from the mountains in a thunderous voice ""This was hand crafted and not an asset flip!"". The use of lighting is phenomenal, and I think it's the most beautiful in darker missions where you can really respect the detail of neon signs making an area glow, the dark corners where it's difficult to see lest you've a light of some sort on the rig you're running. I don't believe that level of detail I've seen elsewhere except maybe ShadowRun? Yet, that's separate game completely. Aesthetically everything just Todd Howards (read: Just works). I've encountered no glitches and even though it's 2D iso, I've quickly found myself immersed in this universe. I've heard comparisons to Hotlline Miami. I personally fail to see the comparisons, in fact, having play both, I see the only commonality between the two is in terms of you're rewarded to kill everything on your screen. Run over a civilian? Here's $50, level a housing district? Here's $2k. Unlike Hotline Miami, you're rewarded most, by finishing objectives and, if you're dead set on destroying everything, it's best to wait until you snipe everything on the map that could harm you because, trust you, YOU DON'T WANT all the units on the board swarming you. Okay, maybe there is another parallel to Hotline Miami, in the way that everyone has that 3rd cousin who hits the bottle, parties, soils their pants and drools there way through the first year of college only to drop out and work at burger king because the other cook is their dealer and it's more convenient to buy your drugs there since you can blow your paycheck on the spot conveniently so you can go get your fix right away. I'd warrant everyone also has that one cousin that saw the drooler and realized that's something they DIDN'T want to be, so they buckled down, got 3 Associates 1 Bachelors degrees. Realized those degrees are now worth toilet paper, so they took a job they didn't like whilst working on their passion project and released it only to see the friends of the drooler buy copies of their passion only to use it for toilet paper, so, like they're degree, that educated cousin realized, they'd have to clean the turds the droolers left on their project and work harder to further refine their formula despite it being perfect regardless the human excrement removed.

I understand that such a review as above is very terse :steamsalt:, however, I feel it necessary to sort of indicate the difference between the drooler (Hotline) & the educated cousin (Brigador). Don't like my comparison? Me neither, however, if you're so inclined to directly compare both the games, there's your analogy. If you like Hotline Miami. Buy Hotline Miami. If you want a hotline Miami-esque game, consider one of the true gems that ara 10tons ltd twin stick shooters that are, imo, superior in every way. Want a game that's good, has excellent gameplay, graphics and an amazing cyberpunk aesthetic & soundtrack? Give Brigador a go. I fail to see how you'd be disappointed. Me? I love the game and am glad I took the time to get used to the controls, which, after doing so, I realized how the game NEEDED the tank controls and how SEAMLESS it is once you get used to them.

[h1] Solo Nobre must fall [/h1]

[b] Brigador [/b] is an isometric tactical mech game - many people assumed from the trailer that it was a twin stick shooter, and the standard controls reflects this, but that's simply not how it's designed and balanced. I would recommend you go into the settings and switch the control scheme to Relative, for the proper tank controls the game was made for. Movement [i] will [/i] take time to get used to, but once you've tuned your brain to the right frequency it controls like an absolute dream.

In [b] Brigador [/b], you are a pilot of a mech, tank, or anti-gravity vehicle. In each mission you are deployed to a district of the city of Solo Nobre with the goal of destroying anti-orbital cannons, killing enemies, and wreaking general havoc. It's a great stress relief game, since the variety of vehicles, pilots, weapons, and missions allow you to fine tune the difficulty to your liking, anywhere from ""Uncontested destruction of a gated community"" to ""All out assault on a fully manned military base"".

With every mission you gain money, which you can use to unlock more of the aforementioned vehicles, pilots, weapons, and missions, as well as lore and intel on enemies. I know it may sound like a horrible grind, but I promise it's not - the balance is very well done to keep you feeling like you're constantly making progress.

[b] Brigador [/b] flopped [i] hard [/i] on release, but it's a genuinely fantastic game that's had years of post-release love and support poured into it, and a sequel is in production.

The gameplay is simple at its foundation but solid and with lots of content layered on top of it. The campaign is fully fledged, but you'll find yourself hopping over to the freelance mode with your earnings to experience the crazy freedom it allows you. A campaign mission generally gives you a set choice of a few mechs, which offer different strategies for passing that particular mission. A freelance mission lets you mix and match whatever combination of pilot, mech, guns and systems you want. You can be a towering colossus of mechanoid death dealing or a pickup truck with a gun bolted on the back and face the same mission in totally different ways.  You're rewarded for making the mission more difficult with higher payouts, which can be used to unlock even more options for future missions.

Context: A YouTuber had this upvote bombed while describing it as a near perfect game. My assessment is more 'meh'; regardless there are criticisms that should be brought up.

This game goes HARD on the simulation. Powered down units blend into the background. Enemy soldiers are hard to make out on a glance. Determining weapon range is difficult on the fly. There is also terrain height which can result in a grenade blowing up in your face. Not to mention the controls; these vehicles have handling relative to their type.

The takeaway; this is not the flashy twin stick it appears to be. This is a tactics simulation. Almost a Mech Commander game without the controls or UI. I want to tell you it's good, but the truth is it's niche.",1593390438,1593478040,False,8,2,0.410693734884262085,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is good at what it is, a tactical real-time mech shooter. If you've played a Mechwarrior game you'll probably like this as the way you control your mech (at least using the real control option) is similar: forward moves you in the direction your legs are facing, your upper body rotates freely for shooting and flanking has big advantages.

There is a good choice of weapons to use and try out. Every mech/tank/hover tank has 2 weapon and the different combinations do change things up. Making a walking war-crime machine is super fun :D

After playing a couple of hours you will see pretty much all the main elements to the game, but that's ok, cause those elements work really well. Variety comes in the freelance missions with trying out all the different possible combinations of mechs/tanks/hover tanks and weapons and you can honestly spend a long time playing it over and over with different setups.

There's a story here you can ignore, but if you want to get into it there is a huge amount of lore and intel you can unlock in the game. Pretty good job at world build for a small team.

I very rarely do such things, but I don't regret my decision.

As Mandalore said, this game resembles Red Alert 2 (in terms of graphics and SFX). I always liked the missions where you must control a small number of units, and Brigador kind of reminds me of those missions.

[b]Main pros:[/b]

- Excellent sprites. A lot of variation and details on the maps. 
- Everything is destructible.
- A lot of weird mechas, antigravs, tanks, you name it. A lot of stuff to drive and to destroy.
- In campaign you can choose between various types of vehicles. This can alter your playstyle. E.g. if you pick a sturdy tank, you can just go on a destruction derby without ever holding back. And if you pick a small mech with camouflage, but very little HP and shields, you can basically play a stealth mission, trying to avoid the spotters and baiting the enemies in small quantities.
- Pretty neat soundtrack.
- Replayability. You can complete campaign missions with every type of transport + there is a freelance mode with tons of maps and customisation. It's somewhat like skirmishes in RA2.

The only ""con"" for me is that it takes some time to get used to the controls (there are alternative modes for them in the options menu, so be sure to check them out).

Other than that, it's a pretty solid game. Mindless fun or somewhat tactical approach - you decide. Really nice piece of nostalgia, but at the same time it doesn't feel ancient.

Honestly I'm not sure what I can add that wasn't already covered in Mandalore Gaming's review (so definitely go watch that instead). Regardless, this game is great. I'm not a huge fan of twin stick shooters, they're OK but I could really take them or leave them. Brigador is a solid twin stick shooter but it brings a lot more to the table. It has a great deal of variety in vehicles and weapons loadouts that allow for some downright insane weapon and vehicle combinations. The story and lore that's in this game is unexpectedly excellent and fun to read; normally I just skim over flavor text but what's in this game adds so much grit and atmosphere to the game. It's written in a more conversational, casual tone that gives the game so much more personality than most other games that divulge lore and backstory in a dry style that tend to read like wikipedia articles. Possibly one of the best aspects of this game though is the sound design and especially the music. Even if you just get the base game I'd still recommend buying the soundtrack if you're a fan of electronica/synth-core. To top it all off the game has some gorgeous sprite work and environments. 

Definitely pick this game up if you enjoy committing war-crimes, wanton destruction of property or just general virtual debauchery.",1593365123,1593734555,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is fun and the different vehicles and weapon types really make the game shine, once you get used to the controls. The soundtrack is great and the the towns look amazing - in tact as well as destroyed. To me half the fun of the game isn't just the combat itself, but also just admiring the sheer destruction the poor saps are experiencing. Yes it is fun to fight of a horde of enemies, navigate around a neighbourhood, make way through a golf course only to appear behind them and blowing them up, giving them super cancer or using bass boosted weapons (literally crushing entire neighbourhoods with sound), but the detailed city scapes and the relentless, merciless destruction thereof are a big part of the enjoyment to me. 

Now, all the praise isn't worth much if I don't also point out the flaws or weak points. You play the game for the great, diversive combat, listening to great tracks and reveling in the destruction of property (and lives). There is a story, but it is dismissable and not too memorable. So if you go into this expecting a story driven campaign, facing big boss fights and drama or anything like that, you would be disappointed. The world building is neat and the story itself is an interesting read through, but not much more than that. Another thing to be wary about are the controls. It takes some time to get used to it - tbh when the speed picks up I'm still not entirely used to it either - but tank controls make sense in the long run, as well as help immerse yourself in the positon of a walking warcrime machine. 

TL;DR:
Great game, lots of variety and fun with great combat, music and it looks amazing too. Don't expect a story driven campaign à la Doom and expect to fight with the controls at first, though it is well worth it all. Highly recommandable, expecially considering the price.",1593349940,1593349940,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The campaign offers fun for a few hours, but it's really rather a glorified tutorial, whereas the Freelance mode is the real meat of the game and offers the most variety.

Brigador can get a bit repetitive, especially as objectives aren't changed up a lot, so the real fun comes from experimenting with the (vastly) different loadout possibilities on different levels and campaigns. Also, the story is only presented through in-game text.

Behold, as way of a review, my humble Universal Problem-Solver configuration for any and all your needs while tearing across Solo Nobre:

Step One: Acquire the Loyalist Heavy Mech known as the ""Swede"".

Step Two: Equip its Heavy Hardpoint with the 305mm Fuel-Air Siege Howitzer, or ""Harvester"".

Step Three: Equip its Main Hardpoint with the 88mm Airburst Cannon, or ""Archie"", and make sure to bring along smoke rounds for covering your advance. 

Step Four: Align the Harvester with the city block containing your objective. Fire.

Step Five: If anything challenges you following the utter ruin of what used to be a fully functional Orbital Gun, Comm Tower, Substation, or Ammo Depot, respond to their complaints via further Harvesting. Should any foe decide to get in close to protest your actions, introduce them to Archie.

Step Six: Enjoy.

On the surface, Brigador appears to be an arcadey twin-stick shooter with cool mechs and really good art direction. It is so, so much more than that.

While you can play Brigador as a mindless twinstick shmup, loading some ultra-heavy mech with twin autocannons and sending more tracers than you can count down range at every enemy you see, the game encourages you to play a lot more thoughtfully, and that's FAR more engaging to me. For example- in my last time booting up the game, I ran a mongoose (a powersuit, think battlearmor from battletech/mechwarrior) with a bonesaw (which is just a fuckin MG42 as far as I can tell) and a mortar, with smoke grenade launchers as my special equipment. This loadout is really good at chewing through light armor, and the mortar gives it a good anti-structure punch (which is important- you're not just here to kill stuff, you have a job to do, and that job is usually to destroy specific infrastructure targets), but against tanks and mechs I had to fight a lot smarter. And so, of course, I start getting rushed by tanks and mechs when I fail to kill a sentry enemy fast enough for it not to alert the whole area to my presence. I retreat to a natural chokepoint in the map, pop smoke and fire a few bursts into the crowd, then bug out and run down a side alley while the enemy pushes up on my old location. Once they get there and start to disperse to search for me, I lob a mortar shell or three in the area to kill or severely damage all the clustered up vehicles, then mop up with my bonesaw.

Is it a milsim? No. There are shield pickups on the ground, big bright ammo resupply points, and your vehicle is always significantly tankier than an enemy piloting the same thing. But it's also not just some mindless arcade game- there's nothing wrong with those of course, and it can sort of be played like that, but there's a lot here to sink your teeth into.

This game is an absolute masterpiece. A brilliant combination of striking presentation, engaging lore and blood pumping gameplay. Every element shines with quality, competence and passion. You will learn to love your vehicles, the city you fight in, your pilots you play as and the enemies that you fight. This is the joy of the classic Desert Strike pumped up to not just 11 but 110. Top down, tactical, 2D heavy armour combat in a cyberpunk, dystopian future setting.

The systems, environment and enemy behaviour interact in layers of complexity to produce a highly satisfying playing experience. You sneak up to the rear armour of a powerful enemy and deliver a killing blow through a residential building block using the absurd penetrative power of your Zeus railgun. You attract a hoard of enemies by blowing up a gas station, then obliterate them with waves of Scimitar artillery strikes. you crush an enemy scout bike underfoot while simultaneously engaging in a laser duel with the powerful tank rolling down the street. The real joy in the game lies in trying and mastering the dizzying array of vehicle combinations and playstyles.

Brigador's charm comes from it's vehicle customisation - you're given a selection of over 50+ vehicles and 40 weapons spread across 5 hardpoint types. Brigador's ""risk = reward"" gameplay means that making life harder for yourself will net you more profits, so picking a dinky little tuk-tuk and the most difficult pilot will get you hundreds of millions in cash, while a massive mountain-on-treads will only get you a tenth of that. In addition, destructible terrain allows for dynamic battles where the battlefield can be shaped to your liking, should you be equipped to do so. Brigador's presentation is stunning, pairing detailed spritework with a banging synth soundtrack. You even get paid to stomp on civvies - what's not to love?

However, the game's simplistic nature means that the game may get repetitive, especially after the campaign is completed - this can be remedied with mods (of which there are many, uploaded by the community to the developers' discord), however. The only issue I really had with gameplay outside of repetitiveness however is the aiming system, which can make placing precise shots difficult. The game has lore, told through weapon, vehicle and pilot descriptions. Though the game's lore is very intriguing, it isn't really integrated into a story-driven campaign, which is disappointing given the fascinating universe of Brigador.

On another note, Stellar Jockeys (the developers) are incredible. They are still dedicated to Brigador, updating their game 5 years later even after a failed launch. They've fostered a small, but active community that I am proud to call myself a part of. 

I would happily call Brigador my favourite game, and would absolutely recommend it. Watch MandaloreGaming's review of it if you need more convincing.",1593277381,1625565680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The controls are absolute dogshit in any mode, whether relative or absolute. They both come with their ups and downs. A lot of times you find yourself stuck or unaware of your hulls position to where you're aiming. If you press E, the hull aligns where you're aiming... so why can't that be a control scheme?

This is why Gravlev/Hover vehicles handle like absolute trash too. Either control scheme is absolutely terrible for them.

The straw that broke the camels back for me is that the game doesn't tell you the exact stats, ammo, rof, firing mode etc when you want to unlock them. For vehicles and pilots, you get at least what guns they can carry (heavy, aux, etc) and for pilots you get some vague stats too. From the few vehicles I unlocked and played, they all share the specialty: tanks have a slight speed boost, mechs slam and hover cars go... uhhh... I dunno, like they just slam onto the ground.

Mandalore also praised the music a lot and I agree. It's definitely nice and all... but more often than not in the actual gameplay, it often times cuts out or gets overwhelmed by some of the sound effects. So you never really get to hear it in its glory.

The only redeeming quality I can say is that graphically it looks amazing. But if you've been kneecapped by the controls and shot in the head by the lack of information, the visuals should at least be appealing.",1593273924,1593273924,False,8,3,0.37033843994140625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Something to add outside of his review, this feels alot like my childhood favorite game Future Cop: LYPD could have been if made with modern technology. And then they added tanks. And then they added hovercraft. And then multiplied the weapon selection by like 30.

If you have relative controls turned on, it really feels like piloting a mech rather than playing with video game controls. I cant even get myself to turn off relative controls for hovercraft because it ruins the feel and starts to feel like a video game rather than the feel the game is going for.

It's alot of fun. I find myself amazed at some of the beauty of the levels slowing down to take it all in.

The issue I have with this game is its gameplay.
First, lets get the campaign mode out of the way - it's dull or at the very least nothing to write home about. It's basically a tutorial/challenge mode that forces you to play exclusive or freemode shared stages with custom presets (enemy/key object placement and player vehicle loadouts). I guess the core of the campaign lies in the contextual lore setup that frames the entire experience, but at facevalue it feels like an arcade gamemode that is supposed to be packaged in addition to the main game. In a bit I will elaborate on why it's not even a good standalone arcade mode, but first I need to describe what many people regard as the main mode of the game.
Second, the freemode. In freemode you assemble a custom vehicle to take on contracts that lead you through a set of districts with a requirement of completing one of the key objectives to advance through a stage. Mainframe of the vehicle and a pilot will define the difficulty and reward modifiers (where money is used to unlock said mainframes, pilots, equipment and ""contracts""). I'll use a bulletpoint list (within a bulletpoint list review) to describe each particular aspect is inherently flawed and fails to contribute towards making the game enjoyable. So in no particular order:
-Contracts. Different sets usually feature the exact same stages that you will end up playing over and over, with no way of circumventing or avoiding that issue.
-Objectives. There are 3 main objectives shared between all stages (even campaign ones with a little caveat of you usually not being able to pick which one to complete): destroying all key structures, assassinating the captains and defeating a percentage of enemy forces. The latter one is entirely redundant due to how the ability to pursue it, implies your capability of dealing with the other two and the other two can essentially be summarized as ""Destroy all of the key entities"". Thus, due to how the game doesn't feature any additional scripting for events and conditions (outside of a few minor environmental ones) the immidiate goals the game sets for you to pursue are at their core extremely basic and dull.
-Currency and reward system. The problem is, its not elaborate enough to support a middleground. One either plays at their leasure and earns barely any money or is stealth rush farming the first contract. There is no point on taking on longer and thus harder contracts, since at max/static modifiers the change in payout is linear. There is no point messing only with either pilot or vehicle mainframe alone, due to how said change would again would only be linear. And when one is combining reasonably difficult pilot with moderately challenging mainframe they will most likely find themselves either extremely stressed (and not in a fun way of that) or bored due to how said mainframes either have no durability to the point where making singular mistakes becomes deadly or them having only peashooter slots, making progression through stages twice if not thrice as slow.

So lets say, that this game is supposed to be that basic, since it is in a sense an arcade twin stick shooter. And here comes my final point, the games scoring system is garbage. There is no combo system, no time scaling there isn't even a leaderboard, it's just destruction score x total ""difficulty"" modifier, making it entirely pointless. It's just a signifier of how much time one is willing to spend on a stage which tells nothing about the quality of the performance.

Thus in conclusion, the campaign mode is too minimalist to be good enough, and due to how freedom mode and mutual core gameplay systems are even less sophisticated, the overall game feels extremely dull and majorly lacking in essential aspects that are inherent to the genre.",1593260409,1593260888,False,8,0,0.447928011417388916,1,False,False,False,False,,,

BRIGADOR is not on that list. That is a mistake.

The gameplay is very satisfying - especially when in the campaign you're forced to try a totally different vehicle/load that you end up enjoying; going from one mission sending penetrating sabot rounds in a hover tank through a inflammable tank farm, to the following mission, lobbing out canisters of chemical weapons into a playground from a minivan on top of a mechanical tower tank.

Everything from the artstyle to the sound design is amazing.

Brigador is just about the most complete, solid, and fun game you can get for 20 bucks.
If you like mechs, and/or destruction you have to try this game.

Honestly I don't even know what to say. The gameplay is really fun. It feels kinda like playing an old Rampage game but with better gameplay mechanics and actual enemy threats.
The audio is stunning. The weapons and clanks of the machines sound... ""heavy"", is the word I'd use.
Also the soundtrack is awesome. Just buy the deluxe edition, it's worth it. God is it worth it.
The developers are a great group of people. They've continued to update this game for years for free, despite low amounts of sales.

If I tried this review would probably be a long winded text filled with ramblings about minute details and my own (poorly) reasoned analysis.
So, let's try to be succinct:
In short, Brigador is a very fun tactical top-down mech/tank/agrav game. It's got good controls, a fantastic aesthetic and great game feel (???). If you like mech-games and/or cyberpunk: Buy it, play it. As an added bonus, the lore and audiobook are top shelf.
In slightly longer ""short"": 
Brigador is a strange thing. A game that is slightly less than the sum of its part, but still is a great game. The above statement is less of a damnation of the entirety of the game, rather a celebration of the games wonderfully realized individual pieces. But what does that mean anyways?
Well, as mentioned previously, the aesthetic (audio-visual) is great, the lore is fantastic, the game feel is good. What's the problem then? Well... as great as the individual pieces are, the game lacks some connecting tissue. For example: There is a campaign, but the missions rarely ""flow"" into each other. Each mission is an isolated instance of the conflict of Novo Solo. Each mission has you controlling different Brigadors, each with their own load-out. While this idea is commendable, seeing as it gives the player different challenges to overcome and adapt to, it fails to tell a story with a clear ""red thread"". While not a deal breaker, it is kind of a shame, seeing as the lore and intel you can read between missions, and the accompanying audio-book, are great. Seems like a missed opportunity. Furthermore, the interesting story and lore is somewhat buried in menus that while being aesthetically in unity with the overall design, could either do with being a bit easier to access and digest.
So, ""what am I trying to say here?"" I am thinking to myself. Well, let's put it like this: Brigador is great, no doubt about that. But don't expect to come in an be welcomed with open arms. It's up to you to find the interesting lore buried within the game, it’s up to you to master the games fun but challenging game-play, it’s up to you to create your own favourite combination of pilot, vehicle, weapons and support equipment and it’s up to you to read, digest and sometimes interpret the story and lore.

The gameplay is great. mechs, tanks, or agravs, all of them are fun. The maps are all completely destructable and there is enough variation of the weapons and vehicles to always mix things up. The three factions are completely unique and you always know what to expect when fighting one over the other. The soundtrack is kickass and I'll listen to it on my drive to work occasionally. The tutorial is usefull and the campaign really helps ease you into the game while at times also being difficult. I encourage you to read mission flavor text but you don't have to.
The Lore is probably one of the strongest aspects of the game. They got a PMC mercenary as a reference to help write a lot of the lore and make the game world feel crazy alive for what appears to be a small indie retro style twinstick. (which of course, it's not.) The lore is so great I've actually been planning on using the setting for a pen and paper RPG with some friends, the audio book certainly adds in much more content when the game already has loads.

Speaking of the audiobook, I would be remiss if I didn't mention it since it's also like the game in the sense it's surprisingly fantastic. If you are interested at all in sci-fi or maybe if you had read warhammer40k novels before than this is up your alley. when it was over I found myself wanting more and the narration was very on point. It didn't have any pacing problems and kept the action and drama going without overdoing anything and it was actually really refreshing. The words ""Kinny screamed"" is burned into my memory as are so many other lines. It's a really great read and if you're picking up the game I actually strongly encourage you to check out the audiobook as well. I admit I put it off for about a year before actually coming around to it.

The only downside I have for this game is the lack of co-op, which i know is asking for a lot, so I can't completely count it against the game, but still, the amount of times me and my friends have wished to play this game together is countless. It would be nice to experience the destruction and mayhem with a partner.

One of the best mech games there is. Lots of replayability and content for the buck, buy this game, much better than other franchises.

pros:
-great mechanics
-great replayability due to a free play version with unlocks
-great art and soundtrack

cons:
-needs more features and content

what i wish it had:
-corruption cards that added some more variety into freeplay.
-profile for freeplay were better, like a more personalized take, where instead the pilot system where more deep. In which you could create your own, from choosing your pic, a point based bonus in which you had to choose positive and negative traits to help you customize your playstyle.
-better armored vehicle customization with more parts. in which you could trully understand the ammount of vehicles there are(its a lot).
-a more detailed damage system for mech combat with penetration,wear and deflection

However, I really ended up liking Brigador. It reminds me a ton of the old strike series of games mixed with a modern polish. It has a ton of fun weapons, Intresting missions, a large freelance map/mission pool, and quite a bit of backround lore. 

The game has a unique art style. I like the shading of the colors along with all the small details that go into the city its self. It even looks good when its destroyed. 

Gameplay is for the most part, very tight. That is if your using tank controls. Brigador was not meant to be controled like a twin stick shooter. Despite that being the default option, you get a ton of things to play around with. The highlights are a chemical projector, a heavy rail gun that goes through most targets, a semi auto rocket launcher, and the 88mm shotgun. Most weapons fit some sort of build with a extra feature. For example, the 15mm lockdown is completely silent and is really good against armor, or the chemical projector that does damage to enemy's over time and acts mostly like a cluster launcher. Each character and vehicle can change things like the payout or the difficulty of a contract. Some of the higher difficultys/ rising difficultys can spawn alarm treehouses which are terrifying. Mostly due to the fact if you dont have heavy weapons, they tend to get their alarms off due to being damage resistant. Stuff like that makes chosing a character and vehicle more exciting.

It's a mech game. Think MechWarrior 2/3/4/, but in 2D, or MechCommander but you are a pilot controlling a single mech (or a tank, or a anti-gravity vehicle) instead of a commander commanding a lance.

With that said, this is a great mech game, with frantic action, beautiful 2D graphic where everything is destructible and a funky electro soundtrack. 

In addition, the game has tons of mechs and vehicles to choose from, along with tons of weapons and support equipment. All of these, combined, offer a surprising amount of depth.

You will find yourself pausing and surveying the enemy's position, planning your attack, where to place that EMP blast to disable enemies, or plotting alternative routes to flank their position and attack them from behind, where their armor is weaker, creating a constant tempo of frantic actions and brief lull where you plan your next move.

All in all, a one of a kind game, where I'd love to see more of. Also, the dev has (had?) been supporting this game after it launched for 4 years, so even though they are now moving on the their next game (which hopefully is the sequel to this game) there is plenty of contents to play around with.

Leaving apart the game-play aside, the soundtrack is incredible and provides an awesome cyberpunk feel.


First a Pros and Cons list:-


[u]Pros:-[/u]

-Incredible Atmosphere (soundtrack especially)
-Simple but rewarding game-play depending on the vehicles you choose and mission parameters you set.
-Surprisingly large amount of lore.
-Very easy to pick & play (each level is just a few minutes long)
-Apart from the campaign, you also have a random-map generator with variable parameters for replay-ability.

[u]Cons:-[/u]

-Short (Campaign takes about 12 hours)


[u]Overall rating: 9/10[/u]

As mentioned, you pilot various destructive vehicles and each vehicle/weapon has a noise component that determines how far across the map you are heard ie the stronger weapons/vehicles attract more enemies. You have a horizontal and vertical axis to traverse through for aiming making a simple action game, surprisingly deep and fun.

The game has a campaign that teaches you the ropes and lets you play around with a variety of pre-equipped vehicles. The overall campaign is short but the game has replay-ability through the Freelance mode where you can customize your vehicle/pilot/weaponry to suit your tastes. There is also quite a lot of lore to be unlocked. 

The soundtrack and artwork laydown a perfect cyberpunk universe where brutality is awarded above all. There is a sequel in the works.

(There are several free post campaign DLC packs put into newer versions )
- Lots to still unlock/do

An AMAZING isometric vehicle based game that is basically a twin stick (ish) blade runner meets mad max.

1. Take a mission
2. Choose a pilot (each have stats)
3. Choose a vehicle
4. Choose weapons
5. Pick a mission 
6. Kill everything and hope you dont die
7. Make it to the exit

Pros:
- Some of the best art / art direction I have seen in a video game. Seriously. The level of detail is incredible
- An amazing soundtrack
- Endless replayabilty
- A TON of unlocks. Just an absurd amount. Can keep you busy for a very long time
- Freelance mode (just non campaign missions)

Cons:
- Getting used to the controls will take some time. It is sort of a twin stick shooter, but with some major differences. WASD to control direction of vehicle. Mouse to control where you are looking (think Mechwarrior).  On top of the, each weapon has a line of attack coming from the vehicle. The thing is, you dont just shoot in the direction. You also have to aim the DISTANCE.  This takes a LOT of getting used to. Each weapon has different archs to the fire, so it is complicated.
- Can be incredibly difficult, especially at first.

Like a single miniature human being encased in a hulking piece of war machinery, humming into the staccato of heavy turret fire, Brigador makes you feel big and small, mighty and fragile just seconds apart. One moment you’re frenetically dancing in the fray, trying to steer your sleek hovercraft clear of enemy barrage, the next you’re ramming into their flank with a bulldozer, or bombard them from afar with long-range lasers and howitzers. The only constant is that you are alone, pitched against overwhelming odds.

スペースコロニー時代…現体制派の指導者の死亡とともに泥沼の紛争地帯と化した入植惑星ノヴォ・ソロの首都ソロ・ノブリにて、SNCに雇われた傭兵""ブリゲイダー""となって数々の作戦を遂行するアイソメトリック・アクション・シューティング。
おそらくは3Dモデルをスプライトに落とし込んだのであろうグラフィックの描き込みが尋常ではなく、膨大な量のオブジェクト、破壊された建物の断面、8方向どころか33方向対応のメックのアニメーションパターン、搭載火器によるグラフィックの変更など、2Dゲームの一つの極北とも言える仕上がりとなっている（信じられないかもしれないが、本作では3Dモデルは一切使っていないのだ！）。
またリフレクションマップやグロウマップといった3Dのテクスチャマッピングと同等の処理を施しているため、リアルなライティング表現を可能としている。ぶっちゃけ3Dモデルを使っても労力的には大差ないというか、むしろメックに至っては3Dモデルを使ったほうが簡単だったはずだが、あえてオール2Dでの表現に拘った開発者の心意義に敬意を表したい。
物理判定はZ軸を含む3D処理を行い、精緻な弾道計算をしている反面、照準ガイドが最終的な着弾地点の予測をしない簡易的なものでしかないため、狙った場所に弾を当てるにはいささかの操作の習熟を必要とする。
選択可能なパイロットは難易度の補正と報酬の倍率にかかり、ユニットの性能に影響を及ぼすことはない。また操作ユニットも性能強化といったRPG的なカスタマイズ要素は存在しないため、金を稼いで自機を強化してヌルゲー化、というバランスのゲームではない。それぞれ背中合わせの利点と欠点を持つユニークな機体の特徴を把握して使いこなす必要がある。
ステージ中に存在するオブジェクトはすべて破壊可能で、逃げ惑う一般市民も殺害可能。GTAなら""犯罪者の凶行""、Postalなら""キチガイの所業""となるが、Brigadorの場合は""軍事作戦中の二次被害""でしかない。そのことに、かえって居心地の悪さを覚えるのは自分だけだろうか…？
正義なき戦争に凝った背景をスパイスに加え、設定厨も楽しめる本作は「ゲーム好きなら買って損はない」と言い切れるくらいオススメの作品です。

- Getting it to run was a little offputting

The world is rich and vibrant and interesting. You can basically set your own difficulty depending on the pilot you choose.

To highlight some of the nostalgic feelings this game brought back for me:
- Battletech (tabletop game) for how unique and quirky and well described each vehicle design is. They really have their own character and feel
- Mech Commander but if you played that on real time mode
- Cyberstorm for the custom pilots and some of the weapons, plus a bit of Earthsiege
- Syndicate for the goddamn BEAUTIFUL graphics (the screenshots don't even remotely do it justice - the level of detail and care that went into each model is insane)
- Raptor for reveling in destruction and getting more money the more you blow up
- Ring Runner (more modern but still) for the complete customization and how the devs love of their game spills through in every way

The controls take some getting used to, but they have half a dozen different settings so you're bound to find one you like (from absolute controls, to offset absolute, to relative, to inverted relative). Plenty of nice quality of life features. Banging soundtrack. Bit sad this game didn't take off like it should have, but it seems like a dedicated core group of fans understood how lucky they were to find it.

Only complaint is that it takes a while to traverse the map from one end to the other if you missed an objective, and there are a finite amount of enemies in each area, so you'll likely end up walking for a while if you're not strategic in the order you complete your objectives.

Este juego trata sobre un planeta colonizado por humanos en el cual ocurre un levantamiento y eligen a un lider revolusionario supremo como gobernante. Pero como es un gobierno de mano dura. Debido a los intereses de cierta cormporacion aeroespacial, deciden enviar a mercenarios entrenados con sus letales veiculos para enfrentar a las fuerzas enemigas y ""derrorcar"" el regimen. (algo muy parecido a lo que masa con estados unidos y medio oriente por cierto)

La jugabilidad es elegir un veiculo con armas y habilidades que te interesen mas, pero la pega es que todos tienen desventajas. Ya sea en maniobravilidad y armamento. Ademas en necesario aclarar para que no les pase como a mi, que no es un simple juego de accion isometrica como lo es el postal 1 (que por desgracias hubiese sido la hostia) sino que es un juego que se necesita muchisima estrategia minuciosa para ganar los niveles. Ya que tenes que matar unidades que llaman a otras, tenes que usar gadges para que no te descubran, y matar con discrecion. Tenes que ir de a poco avanzando y tener 800 ojos para ver que no te disparen por todos lados, porque solo podes regenerar el escudo. La barra de vida no. Y si se te acaba, sonaste.  

Asi que si juegan a este juego, presten atencion a la etiqueta ""pequeño picaro"", que tiene que ver con el genero rouge-like que si la hubiese visto antes me humiese ahorrado el actual disgusto de haberlo comprado y llegado muy lejos. Porque en lo personal los niveles mas avanzados son terriblemente engorrosos y frustrantes, hasta no ser divertido.

Aun asi le pongo calificacion buena porque esta espectacular lo bien hecho que esta la destruccion y el diseño de veiculos.

I really, really wish there was more to this game. I flew threw the campaign so fast that when the final screen opened announcing I had escaped the planet, or whatever it was, it came so suddenly and unexpectedly that I almost didn't believe it. 
Freelance mode is interesting, but I don't know how many times I can destroy four structures and the garrison. 

I would pay another $20 or $30 for an engrossing, rich campaign with evolving, interesting objectives and challenges, and a rich story line. The brief, vague bits of lore available on the side with each mission didn't cut it.

Overall, Brigador feels like 90% style and 10% substance. This world is very cool, very well crafted, and a pure delight to stomp around in. Every weapon system and vehicle feels unique and engaging enough that I instantly started dreaming up combinations and play-styles. But that's about it.

I also appreciate the throwback to the old Syndicate games with how the maps are laid out.

The campaign structure is a (long) series of missions and I would have liked a more linear and cohesive experience. In fact you don't really ever have to read the briefings or debriefings between missions. 

Controls could do with a bit of tweaking as well, the game picked up my x-box one controller just fine and will roll with it, but having to control both distance and direction with the right stick makes for an unpleasant experience. I would have liked for the game to turn on autoaim for distance, and had the crosshairs locked at a specific distance when using a controller instead.

Using the mouse for aiming works perfectly, but movement with the keyboard can get tedious, as you often have to walk diagonally.

Thankfully, almost all of these issues can to a certain extent be fixed in the settings. If aiming with a controller is hard, you can either alter the sensitivity, or lower the game's speed to give you more time. 

If having to press W and D at the same time to move diagonally gets tedious for you, change the settings so that W moves you diagonally (either left OR right).

So the solutions are all there if you have the time and inclination to experiment until you find what fits you like a glove.

In short: I really recommend it!

-The game has been painstakingly polished over the course of multiple years, many indie games leave something to be desired, here the devs did not stop until their vision was realized in all its glory
-Lore wise, the world feels original, interesting and believable. Better than 90% of sci-fi oriented game worlds
-If you're obsessed with all sorts of military equipment like I am, then the weapon/pilot/vehicle descriptions are a treasure trove, every entry is entertaining
-The game is full of weapons you will not see anywhere else, inspiration for most of these exists in the real world, but other games simply do not bother
-Enemies are the correct mix of capable and believable, any sandbox where I can break line of sight and not have them know my position gets a huge plus from me
-The game rewards mastery, unlike many AAA titles where your hand is held no matter what

The game is not without flaws, but you can read up on those elsewhere, I only have one suggestion:
-When you have so many vehicles and weapons, more than 4 special weapon types seems like an easy way to boost replay value",1578792793,1578792793,True,8,0,0.636351048946380615,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On the surface, Brigador may look like a simple twin stick shooter, but this is far from the truth. Brigador is a detailed isometric shooter that has a surprising amount of depth to it. Vehicles have their own weight and height values, affecting movement and their ability to shoot over cover, respectively. Height is an interesting aspect of the game that isn’t seen in many other shooters – piloting a hulking Citadel ultra-class tank will let you shoot over cover (even entire buildings) without a problem, but this comes at the downside of allowing enemies to see you from much further away. Alternatively, using a tiny Mongoose powersuit will let you stealthily sneak around without alerting anyone. Sound also plays a major role in stealth. Firing a Harvester MIRV can usually flatten just about everything on screen, at the cost of every enemy within district walls being instantly alerted to your presence. Alternatively, the Black Hand irradiator is nearly silent, allowing you to quickly and quietly melt enemy vehicles.

Brigador’s main gameplay involves completing objectives which consist of destroying marked enemies, buildings, or X% of enemies in the map. While this might seem like it could get stale over time, there are simply so many ways to accomplish these objectives that it never does. If you get tired of instantly alerting enemies by using a large vehicle with heavy weapons, you can always try out using small vehicles with lighter weapons and try to be stealthy, etc. Of course, there’s nothing stopping you from trying to be stealthy in a heavy vehicle (you can’t get spotted if all the spotters are dead :^] ), or going guns blazing in a small vehicle, etc. 

Brigador’s gameplay mostly consists of destroying things, and this is done extremely well. Every weapon feels fairly unique, has distinct audio, and some weapons have unique graphical effects. Laser weapons leave behind afterimages that slowly fade away, while machine guns spew out shell casings that remain in the level until you leave. Damaging buildings will leave behind fragments of the building, depending on where you hit it, and whether or not it is completed destroyed. Basically, every action you make will change how the area looks until you’ve exited the level.

Overall, Brigador is an absolutely fantastic game. Although I’ve only mentioned the basic gameplay, there is much more to Brigador than that. The soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set is great and fits the mood of the game perfectly. If you think you’ve done it all and have unlocked all of the vehicles, you can use the developer console to create your own vehicle using existing vehicles as a base – ie: putting a tank turret on a pair of mech legs, etc. Editing existing vehicles (both player and enemy variants) is possible as well, and is pretty easy to do. If you’ve completed the campaign and finished all of the freelance runs there is an active modding community if you want to find new levels, or even learn to create your own level. Both the developers and the community are extremely active; the Brigador/Stellar Jockeys Discord server is 100% worth joining, and it’s easily worth getting a Discord account for if you don’t already have an account. All in all, Brigador is much more than just another isometric shooter and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.

Tl;dr: Brigador is arguably the best cyberpunk-based warcrime simulator on the PC and Mac, at least until Brigador Killers comes out.

Game developer replied my review. The followings are updated after their reply.
[b]I experience with The Brigador is, it is annoying and unpleasant to play.
It is hard to recommend it to everyone.
My advice is to play it on someone's PC (for like 2-4 hours), then decide whether it is suitable for you.
I gave up on 5th hour. 6th hour is to test game developer's feedback.[/b]
👍🏻 Appreciate game developers' effort.
[table] [tr] [td]
👎 Game level design which promotes stealthy approach, or else all the nearby (including outside of screen) enemies will storm your location.
But, you pilot a combat vehicle with big+loud cannons+missiles & machine gun turrets.
And, your target are (Michael Bay's) high-explosive buildings and enemies' explosive-packed vehicles.
[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]
👎 The weapon [b][u]DOES[/u][/b] shoot at exactly where the laser sight points to. 
[b][u]BUT[/u][/b], some enemies are so small / short or hover in mid-air, the projectiles does not hit them, and need to be re-adjusted.
[spoiler]Annoyingly wasting machine gun turrets bullets on foot soldiers who are storming slowly towards you, but you still can't hit most of them, while you point your laser sight on top of those foot soldiers.[/spoiler]
However, at the heat of the battle (where enemies swamp at you from all directions), to align the shot at 1 specific enemy is a luxury one cannot afford. 
[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]
👍🏽 Developer's recommended guide: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535841178][u]Brigador - The Solo Nobre Murder Spree Handbook[/u][/url]
Most of the tips are similar to those from in-game tutorial missions. No too useful.
Also, strategic planning is hardly a thing in this game, because player can't see where most enemies are. There is no map.
[i][u]Example[/u]:
I saw 1 lonely enemy from the far edge of the screen, and thinking I should take it out before it alerts others.
After 1 shot, the horde of enemies just behind that lone enemy (outside of screen) swamp my location.
Other hordes from other directions are also alerted, and ambushing me.[/i]
[b]Without more useful information (e.g. map / overview of the field, no. of enemies, enemy type, etc.), planning an attack is equally suicidal as running in guns blazing Rambo style.[/b]
[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]
😞 (Not game developer's fault, but......) 😞
[u]NVidia Graphic Card[/u] player might need to manually tweaked settings to get smooth game-play experience (i.e. stable FPS).
(See: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/274500/discussions/1/1640917625019290891/][u]Attention Nvidia Laptop owners! increase FPS![/u][/url])
I got stable 50FPS (after changing settings).[spoiler]
Intel i7-7700HQ + 8GB RAM + GTX1050Ti computer
[strike]Game runs mostly at 30FPS on high graphic quality.
Only when shadow and aliasing graphic settings are tuned down to bare minimum or OFF, then the game can run mainly 60FPS.
It still dips down to 40FPS from time to time.[/strike][/spoiler]
[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]
👎 FPS affects game response.
At lower FPS, both player's and enemies' movement becomes slower.
The changes between 30FPS and 60FPS is very noticeable when playing.
[spoiler][strike]Most enemies still move at normal speed.
Making the enemies storming your location much more deadly.[/strike][/spoiler]
[/td] [/tr] [/table]
You, the 1-man army, going against the whole fleet (or, most) of enemies from all directions, and a single shot is enough to alert all of them to your location.
[spoiler][strike]Why waste time fighting a lost war? Go play other games.[/strike][/spoiler]
I can see the potential of this game, but the combat mechanics and game level design are contradicting themselves. 
[h1]Feedback to Game Developer :[/h1]
If someone's guide is better than your tutorial / tooltips, you might want to include/update your game with those information. 
(e.g. picture of the laser pointer and projectile path)
(e.g. explosive pipeline is not explained in tutorial)
✨ Best wishes to the game developers. ✨
✨ Hope you guys would continue the effort developing good games in future ✨
But I still can't recommend Brigador.",1577111753,1578222767,False,4,5,0.371861875057220459,0,True,False,False,False,,1577563858.0,"While a more strategic style of gameplay is favored, it's certainly possible to successfully play Brigador with a full Rambo style. Regarding your other points however, there's some things to be cleared up.

Regarding performance, those specs should run the game fine so make sure your drivers are up to date and that your computer is using the graphic card not the integrated chip -- see this post: https://steamcommunity.com/app/274500/discussions/1/1640917625019290891/

Regarding FPS dips, when the framerate drops below 60 fps the entire game will slow down because otherwise physics and projectile errors will be produced. *Everything* in the game slows down though, so you're incorrect in saying it's only the player unit. You can manually test this yourself by adjusting the default game speed in the settings menu.

Regarding aiming, the issue you're having is due to the 3D nature of the game. One of our community members has put together a comprehensive guide that includes diagrams that show how aiming works and why you're missing shots you think should hit: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535841178

I hope this clears some things up for you and enables you to better enjoy the game. If not, we understand and hope you enjoy our future titles better."

　一方のフリーランスは選択したステージを自由な構成のユニットで攻略でき、ユニット構成には搭乗者の選択も含まれ、選択した搭乗者でゲームの難易度、クリアした際の報酬(ポイント)が微調整される。選択できるステージにはキャンペーンモードのステージも含まれ、より自由にゲームを楽しみつくすことができるゲームモードである。
　フリーランスで使用可能なユニットはステージクリア時に獲得できるポイントでアンロックしていく形式なので、まずは武装やユニット特性を把握し操作に習熟するためにもキャンペーンモードを面倒臭がらずに攻略していくことをお勧めする。

～以下蛇足～
　地球を遠く離れた植民地惑星""ノヴォ=ソロ""、その首都""ソロ・ノブリ""。かつて宇宙開発企業SNC(ソロ・ノブリ・コンサーン: ""ソロ・ノブリ開発事業""といった意味か)により搾取されていた人民は""偉大なる指導者""に導かれて""新人民軍""を組織・決起しソロ・ノブリの自由を勝ち取った。しかし時を経て今""偉大なる指導者""は斃れ、ソロ・ノブリはかつてない混乱を迎えようとしている。
　プレイヤーはSNCと契約し""ブリゲイダー""と呼ばれる傭兵となってソロ・ノブリの覇権を握らんとす三勢力を排除し、当初の開発事業を再開せんとすSNCのソロ・ノブリ再占領のために戦場へと赴くことになる。
　SNCおよびその契約下にあるブリゲイダーたちが排除すべき敵対勢力は、""偉大なる指導者""亡き後の混乱を抑え支配の安定を取り戻そうとする""新人民軍""、""偉大なる指導者""の圧政に異を唱え黄緑に塗られたジャンク兵器で命をものともしないゲリラ攻撃を得意とする""コーヴィッド""、地上(惑星上)に居住する人類全てを下等な生物と断じその抹殺を最終目標とする超科学の宇宙居住者""スペーサー""。
　""偉大なる指導者""の圧政はSNC統治時代に勝るとも劣らない過酷さであったようで、プレイヤーの分身たるブリゲイダーたちは誰もが様々な所属と出自を持つ一癖ある人物たちばかりである。どのキャラクターにも魅力的なバックグラウンドが設定されており、あるものは生きるために戦い、あるものは夢の実現のために、そしてあるものは快楽を追い求めて果てしない破壊と殺戮に身を投じる。
　ブリゲイダーたちが搭乗する戦闘機械もユニークで、ガラクタの寄せ集めから地上居住者の技術では解析不能なオーバーテクノロジーめいた先端科学の結晶まで、反重力バイクに始まりパワードスーツ、二足歩行メック(戦闘ロボット)、果てには超重量級タワービルの如し怪物戦車に至るまで多種多様、様々な戦闘機械を操縦できるのは爽快の極みである。無論、これらの戦闘機械、その搭載兵器に至るまで詳細な設定が存在し、SF好きであればこれら資料に目を通すだけでも楽しめることは請け合いである。
　全てのゲーム内のテキストは丁寧に日本語化されており、日本語話者のプレイヤーであれば言語面での心配は一切無い。ここまで至れり尽くせりの環境で日本語圏における知名度が低いことに疑問を感じずにはいられない。情緒あふれるサウンドトラックも相まって、是非ともおすすめしたい一作。",1573734680,1598943030,True,4,0,0.548615515232086182,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And get paid. Then buy more mechs or guns. Repeat.

Theres also a story mode which gives some reasons (not badly written actually and theres alot of lore) why you destroy stuff with a mech but thats basically it.

Theres mechs, tanks and hovercraft in big, average, small and joke/challenge variations which each play differently and can fit (two) different type guns and (one) special weapons.

Theres alot of guns like cannons, howitzers, lasers, machineguns etc which also handle differently.

Beyond pure reflexes theres also an amount of tactics involved altho that mainly boils down to how much attention you want by noisily blowing up big targets.

Difficulty/Rewards are handled in a somewhat unique way. Each vehicle has a reward modifier - for example playing with a big killer mech will net fewer rewards as driving around in a trashcan with a nerf gun. Difficulty is customizable via Pilots and scenarios. Scenarios define what type of maps and how many in sequence youll play and if you can cash out before playing all of em. Pilots define the starting difficulty and difficulty jumps between maps. So for the big bucks you might wanna play a 10 map scenario with said trashcan and a high risk pilot - if you can survive.

Unfortunately theres no parts customization beyond vehicle and weapon choices, altho there are quite a few of em. The gameplay might get repetitive after a while.

The gameplay is borderline casual, and eventually you will be doing it simply to unlock stuff (4 hours, and I am kinda in that place, just to be real), be it more mech suits or pilots, or more lore/intel/information about the world, but....its captivating enough, I can see myself buying the audiobook dlc on a sale (ten bucks is a lot, I have addictions to fund)",1569126182,1569128548,True,3,2,0.503225803375244141,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you stick with it, though, you'll find something much more interesting than either of those, and it won't release its hooks until you've experienced everything it has to offer. The gameplay is deep enough to provide a broad variety of viable tactical approaches, while being intuitive enough to ensure you can explore any of them without feeling like you're doing it wrong. It's one of those games that makes you crave higher and higher difficulty as you play and your understanding deepens.
Make sure to change the default scheme to tank controls, though, as the game is designed with that in mind. It's strange that it's not the default.

The lore is also noteworthy, as it's surprisingly great. For a game from a small, lesser-known studio with a story mode that could only loosely be referred to as such, the worldbuilding is shockingly excellent.

If you've ever played MechWarrior 3050 for the SNES or BattleTech for the Sega Genesis (they're the same game), it plays fairly closely to that game. I rather liked that game growing up so this was a pretty easy game for me to get into. And it's 1,000x better.
Weapon selections only look limited on paper until you see what the amount of combinations you can make just on one unit; a Touro mech fitted with the free gear (an HE cannon and a light machine gun with smoke canisters) will make for a great, tough line fighter, while simply changing the weapons to an ""Archer"" cannon and ... a class of laser I've forgotten... can turn the Touro into a shock trooper.
And there's roughly 100 units to pick from, from mechs to anti-gravity hulls (""agravs"") and actual light and heavy tanks, with varying speeds, armor and shield levels, and two different sized hardpoints on each unit. Lighter units likely have smaller hardpoints... but not always.
Once you're on the field, it's about completing objectives however you need to. Sneak in and dart in and out of trouble to complete your objectives like a scalpel? Roll in and stand up to whatever garrison is thrown at you, overcoming all who stand before you? Or lure your enemies into ambushes and cause maximum shock and awe before they know what hit them?

It also helps that everything -- and I mean *everything* -- is destructible within the district bounds. Causing maximum property damage has never been so much fun.

The neon aesthetic and accompanying music by Makeup and Vanity Set just seals the deal for me.",1566791565,1566791753,True,4,0,0.585492253303527832,0,False,True,False,False,,,

You have a hundred of repetitive missions, generic briefing (don't expect any storyline or characters to connect to). You don't have a chance to customize, upgrade or select mechs/weapons. There is zero lore.  Fullscreen mode is bugged and stays either under big screen mode or over all other windows without  possibility to switch to any other apps.
Objects are being destroyed by tiles (which makes no sense with buildings and looks weird).

What brings this game down is the lack of a proper campaign, story and good progression. There is something called a campaign in the game, but it is just a series of disconnected missions and some fluff text that doesn't really tell you anything interesting or important. The missions always have the same goal: kill X amount of enemies or kill X specific buildings. It just feels like a normal skirmish except that the map is premade/fixed.

There is also no progression in the campaign. Instead you get to select from 3-4 characters with preset loadout. There's no difference on who you pick, the only thing that changes is what you're driving and what weapons you have. The character himself is basically just a picture, because there are no character interactions or dialog. Besides, the characters you can select from changes from time to time so it really feels like you are picking from random characters that has no impact on the nonexistant story.

A more accurate name for the ""campaign"" would be ""Tutorial & Challenges"". Because that's ultimately what it is.

There's also a freelance mode where you can select whatever you want as long as you have unlocked it. The problem here is they the progression. You can easily buy the biggest and baddest vehicles & weapons very early. So you have to deliberately select crap things and make it harder on yourself unless you want to play the same thing over and over. I really dislike games that does this rather than make you start weak and then you get gradually stronger and stronger while the challenge increases.

Finally, there's a lore section where you can unlock lore in the game. I must say I'm very impressed by this, because there is so much text while at the same time it barely tell you anything important/interesting. Just like the text for the ""campaign missions"".

Don't use a controller, it's too frustrating when adjusting firing arcs of the turret. You can change the Absolute/Relative control scheme (I refer to it as TPV/FPV) but it doesn't help with firing arcs. [u]The game itself is really great.[/u] [/b]

In regards for controllers, it essentially makes the control of the mech very un-intuitive depending on the perspective you are working on. 

Say you are playing the game from a FPV perspective in relation to the pilot in the mech, you move your right stick towards the left and you would expect the turret to rotate counter-clockwise. To the right, clockwise. To the upward or downward orientation, an adjustment of how close or far you want to aim your weapons (firing arcs). 

The game however takes on the TPV (Third-Person View) in that if you push your right stick to the left it will point to the left of the screen and if you continue holding it in that direction, you will essentially be telling your mech you want to aim your weapons further and further away. 

This has the effect of making it incredibly difficult to maintain your crosshairs at a fixed distance. Say if you wanted to run a circle around a static turret, you would have to constantly make sure you aren't accidentally changing the angle of your firing arcs as you run the circle. 

This becomes unbearable when you are using high-arc indirect fire like mortars since almost any change in the firing arc greatly affects the location and time it takes for it to come down on a moving target. 

The left stick also operates on this TPV, but since it's controlling the legs of the mech it isn't that bad and is appropriate as a twin-stick shooter game. 

My (separate) complaint for keyboard is that you can only really move in the eight directions of your WASD keys can take you. So if you wanted to really control the angle of your approach, it isn't appropriate. 

---

You could say, ""just get used to it nub"" and you would be right. It just saps the fun out of an otherwise extremely fun game when you have to wrestle with the controls to make it do what you want. [b] So I am going to be refunding this game, as I just can't enjoy it.[/b]

Obviously, many people like the game, even I really like it. I just hope that they put in an option eventually that lets you change how you would like to control the mech. 

So really, this is a peeve of my own when it comes to games. If you can get over it, buy the game, it's pretty great.


EDIT/REPLY: In response to comments on the control schemes in the game. (max 1000 characters for comments)

Repurchased but the relative controls don't actually fix my primary concern. 

To clarify, keyboard and mouse movement wasn't really a bother to me in the first place, merely the lack of granular adjustment that is inherent when using absolute. (Which for the most part is a near non-issue for me.)

The main concern stems from when I want to use a gamepad to play. 

The left stick is equivalent to WASD and the right stick does what the mouse would do in aiming. Even under relative controls, the right stick is still pushing the firing arc far out into the distance. 

It is difficult to describe; but say you are trying to rotate your turret from North (12 o'clock) to South (6 o'clock)  while maintaining a constant firing arc of 50 meters (arbitrary). To accomplish this in [b]both the relative and absolute control schemes[/b] you have to move the right stick from North to South. What ends up happening is as the turret rotates (at around the East 3 o'clock position), the firing arc changes at an increasing (near exponential) rate the closer it gets to the South (6 o'clock position).  

When you finally reach the South (6 o'clock position) your firing arc is no longer at the 50 meter mark but much [b]MUCH[/b] further than where you intended it to be. I am not even sure you will be able to maintain it at the 50 meter mark while in the rotation using a controller (I haven't been able to pull it off), and it often times necessitates a separate step where I have to essentially pull the right stick [b]BACK[/b] into the North (12 o'clock) position to correct the firing arc while [i]simultaneously[/i] preventing the entire turret from turning again back to the North (12 o'clock) position. 

That is really a major issue with high arc weapons and a slight/non-issue with flat arc weapons. 

I suppose I can still enjoy the game with KB/Mouse but I was really looking to getting the nostalgia from when I played these types of mech games on the venerable Sega Genesis.",1564799318,1564932222,False,5,0,0.487366855144500732,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Probably biased as I'm still starved for mech games, getting my hands on a game that not only feels good to play,  challenging, and is well polished, but this is easily one of, if not the best indie title I've bought in a long, loooong time. This game feels like its got a lot of heart. From its design, to the controls, to the soundtrack, to all the lore entries.

The concept is simple, Great leader of a place died, and there is a company with a lot of money wants control of said place. So they're paying out to to do their dirty work. And to do so, available to you is a variety of tanks, mechs, and weaponry to get it done, and there is just so many different combinations to screw around with. And its rather straightforward, destroy objectives by any means and get out.

I feel actual guilt from buying just once.

If you like those top down isometric shooter games from SNES this is by far the best love letter.... better yet... above just a love letter, a proper iteration of the isometric shooter.

Pros:

+Mechs.

+Infinite gameplay value.

+Campaign mode in parallel with a freelance mode.

+Aesthetic are blasting 80s in the most groovy way possible

++The soundtrack is a masterpiece. I've put it in my daily work playlist at spotify as well as a purchase from the steam store. They deserve every penny.

+proper... I mean PROPER sprite graphics and gorgeous interaction with the environment including lighting. These are the best sprites I have ever seen.

+Tough if you want, easy if you want. VERY VERY tough if you want too.

+Interesting lore

+++Graphics

+Fun

++++Environmental destruction. You can just flatten out a suburb if you want. Every.Object...

Cons:

- Can be confusing at times if the action get too hectic.(very minor)

自機は二脚メックや小型のパワードスーツ、普通の戦車や高速ホバー、装甲皆無の武装3輪バイクからスクラップを組み合わせたトーテムポールみたいな重武装のタワー型タンクと何タイプかあり、武装もマシンガンや滑腔砲、曲射砲や腐食性ガス弾、レーザーやレールガン、建物や機体を貫通して敵パイロットに直接ダメージを与えるガンマ線放射機、振動波で建物を砂糖菓子のように粉砕してついでに人体の骨も粉末状にするらしく市民を打ったら赤い塵になっちゃう武器まであって豊富
ステージ内の建造物はほぼ全てか破壊可能でガソリンスタンドを誘爆させて敵を一網打尽にしたりできる。ちょこまか逃げ回ってる黄色いレインコートの市民も撃ったり踏んだりヤりたい放題

高火力高HPの鈍足機で蹂躙すると爽快な反面単調になってしまうが、それでも敵に囲まれると容赦なくゴリゴリ削られるのでそこそこスリリング。また敵にも視界があるためビルや森林の影に隠れたり煙幕でやり過ごすなど、防御力の低い小型ユニットだとステルス戦の立ち回りを要求される場面があってシンプルながら奥深い
とくにパワードスーツは集中砲火を食らうと瞬殺されるものの小さいので遮蔽物を盾にしやすく、正面対決だと撃ち勝てないタワー型タンクに対しては建物越しに曲射砲やガンマ線放射機で攻撃するなど戦術性が高くて楽しい

トランス系のBGMがクールで日本語ローカライズの質も高く、資金でアンロックできる設定や解説もエクセントリックで初代アーマードコアっぽいダークな世界観が垣間見えるのも○。とくに兵器や武器の設定は諧謔み旺盛なので読んでから遊ぶと愛着がわく

First of all, it's very stylishly presented. The pumping, synth-heavy soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set absolutely slaps and fits the purple and red, neon-soaked art style. The different factions and their vehicles all have very distinct looks, and the environments look surprisingly good for sprite work (I'm pretty sure this game uses sprites). The lore of Solo Nobre is rather well written and deep, considering it's almost entirely delivered through written data entries purchased from Acquisitions. The locations, factions, vehicles, weapons, and pilots all have their own entries which allow you to piece together the history of this city that you're fighting to liberate.

Some people seem to have gripes with the tank-style controls (i.e. A and D rotate your hull while W and S simply move you forward and backwards), but I enjoy them. It does feel weird at first given the isometric perspective (and the fact that the 'Agrav' vehicles move rather differently) but eventually you'll come to appreciate the added control it gives you over movement, not to mention it seems to add more tangible weight to your mech's ponderous footsteps. If it turns out these controls aren't for you, there is an option to switch them for more traditional controls.

Of course, it is the mechs, tanks and Agrav speeders that make this game so good. They all have their particular play style and personality, ranging from the humble Touro mech to the towering Treehouse (basically a stack of scrapped cars on tank treads) and everything in between. Complementing this formidable garage is an equally impressive arsenal. There are large howitzers and 30mm rotating auto-cannons for those who dismiss subtlety, short-range energy weapons for sneaky take-downs, or a railgun that can penetrate almost any cover for the snipers amongst you. I mentioned sneaking because there is something approaching stealth in this mech game, funnily enough. One piece of equipment allows you to cloak for a short period of time, allowing you to avoid raising the alarm to assassinate important targets or bypass large patrols.

Now, the drawbacks (at least for me) are few. One used to be that the levels got a bit repetitive after doing enough freelance contracts as they aren't randomly generated, although this is probably for the best. However, the developers just added a free level editor add-on, which I'm sure will alleviate this issue. 

My other main niggle is that all the weapon models of each class are the same. Although you can't see them that clearly on your mech because of the distance from the camera, it would have been nice if the more outlandish weapons had appropriately ridiculous designs, but this is only a small personal nit-pick. 

All in all, well worth the £14.99 price tag, pretty much that of your average niche indie title. Even more so on sale. Your contract is waiting, Brigador.",1564442786,1564442786,True,2,0,0.537917912006378174,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have adored isometric games since Crusader: No Remorse, Syndicate, Diablo, etc. Brigador combines that throwback isometric feel with a grittier MechWarrior where the battlefield is denser, more frantic, and filled with soft, squishy, civilian bodies. There is a huge variety of mechs, powersuits, tanks, anti-grav units, etc., each with diverse loadouts that can be further customized in Freelance. The loadouts can range from massive deathdealers that make you feel like a lumbering, nearly invulnerable god of war to tiny and fragile but agile and punchy bikes and powersuits that require careful strategy, judicious use of defense skills, well-planned ambushes, and white-knuckled, high-mobility strikes. Gameplay, on the surface, is relatively simple, but there is a deceptive amount of nuance. It's not too hard to drop in, but it can take several hours to really master. Fortunately, there are virtually no load times (although I'm on a 9th generation Intel with an NVMe drive), so you don't feel punished for failing a mission and jumping back in to nail it. Definitely try the campaign missions on all the different loadouts, as each presents unique challenges and gameplay styles for the same scenario.

The graphics are tiny, detailed, well-animated sprites that are punched up by surprisingly excellent lighting effects. Maps are varied and detailed as well, ranging from sprawling estates to residential strongholds and densely populated urban environments. However, the palette is dark and ruddy which looks great IMO but some friends have found it a little tiring and occasionally makes it hard to pick details out. The soundtrack is incredible. If you like synthwave or 80s/early 90s horror/action-inspired soundtracks (think: John Carpenter), I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself popping on the soundtrack when chilling out.

The lore is dense, blood soaked, and morally ambiguous, but presented in a way that you can largely ignore it and just jump into the game if you don't care. I think of the violent socio-eco-political churning from MechWarrior, Syndicate, Eve Online, etc. It's very satisfying. Be sure to pick up the associated novel if you are a space opera or military sci-fi fan.

Now for the cons:

- Controls can have a surprisingly high learning curve, even if you're relatively experienced with isometric games. The reality is you'll deal with vehicles where the movement is separate from the turret/torso, and you can find yourself tangled up in the environment quickly when the fight gets heated particularly when dealing with multiple close-in threats. Definitely experiment with the plethora of orientation schemes, using a gamepad, or even slowing down the gameplay (there's a slider for that) before you give up, and also try to remember that after a little time you'll likely get a feel for it.
- Aiming arc. Weapons have different ranges, arcs, and you're dealing with targets of different heights (some aren't even attached to the ground ala anti-grav units). Even after playing it for a while, experimenting, reading the manual, the aiming system can still be frustrating. Again, this can be exacerbated by close-in swarms and anti-grav units. Perhaps a mild autoaim/targeting feature that you can toggle on might help for some players.
- Isometric perspective has some drawbacks for fast-paced gameplay. Sometimes you're trying to do a fast strike on a target and get away behind buildings, only to be caught on something on the backside of a building that you can't really ""see"". 
- Sound effects aren't bad, but they don't seem textured or particularly deep. Some individual effects can be a little underwhelming.
- Mouse-holing, stomping, ramming environmental structures to gain a tactical advantage can get a little tedious, especially if you're in a small and fragile unit.

My only real complaints is that it feels like its missing some simple options that would make the game even better.

There's a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, enemies, maps, pilots, and sequences of maps (for Freelance mode). These all help keep the game fresh and ensure there's always something new to try out.

The story of the game is quite in-depth and well-written. Yes, it's only in text boxes in the Intel and Briefing screens. I still recommend you read them.

The gameplay itself can be a bit hard to grasp - tank controls are in full effect and agravs follow the mouse - but once you get the hang of it, you'll be blowing up yellow-raincoated civvies in no time at all!

EDIT: One thing I want to bring up is how the gameplay really makes you behave in-character for someone who may have betrayed their own people for cash and a ticket off this soon-to-be-obliterated rock.

There are lots of enemies and only one of you, so managing how many enemies are attacking you at once is vital to survival.

Use special abilities to even the odds, whether that's by blocking the vision of foes, stunning them, becoming invisible, or even immediately hitting them for a large chunk of damage.

Rain down death upon the heads of your foes, or obliterate them by punching through walls before they know you're even there.

Have you ever played Future Cop L.A.P.D. on your PS1? This is basically its spiritual successor.

BRIGADOR is an isometric vehicular combat simulator where you take control of one of Brigadors - mercenary contractors hired by ""The Company"" to sabotage the infrastructure and military cohesion of Solo Nobre independant colony, to make it easier for The Company to move in and secure the planet for whatever it is they want to do with it.

You get to play one of ~90 (!) unique vehicles ranging from small exosuits and treadbikes to large heavy tanks and mechs, armed with variety of weapons - conventional or otherwise - and you have only one objective: destroy marked targets and get out.

""Or just flatten the whole sector if you feel like it, we don't care LMAO"" - The Company, probably.

You'll be deployed in a closed off sector with hostile forces present and given some key targets to destroy. You can go about it any way you want - you can either go surgical and only destroy what needs to be destroyed... Or you can take on the entire hostile regiment in the sector and kill absolutely everyone, civilians included. Company doesn't care, so you don't have to either.



The game is made mostly as a sandbox to have some casual carnage fun.

[b]CAMPAIGN[/b] mode is called so very loosely. There's no dialogue, no story, no anything. It's more like sets of challenges where you pick one of predetermined loadouts and must finish the map with what you've been given.

The money you earn are then spent in [b]ACQUISITONS[/b] menu where you unlock vehicles, weapons and pilots to play in sandbox FREELANCE mode where the real game lies.

In [b]FREELANCE[/b] mode you get to completely customise your experience:
Pilots determine enemy strength and composition (as well as paycheck), while your Loadout acts as extra difficulty modifier and determines your plastyle.
Larger heavy vehicles act as easy mode and rely on raw strength, while to smaller vehicles a single mistake can cost them their life and so they rely on stealthy hit'n'run tactics instead.

Then you pick which sets of maps you want to beat and out you go.
You can go for a casual single map run, or you can go for all 39 sectors in a row, where any damage taken to the hull is permanent so any scratch you suffered in sector 1 will still be with you in sector 39.



The gameplay of combat itself is simultanously simple and deep.
While your vehicle is slightly stronger than NPC counterparts - you are still not exactly invincible, so you need to pick your fights carefully.
Shots from behind deal extra damage.
Different weapons deal different amounts of damage to Shields, Hull or Environment.
You are always outnumbered and enemy patrols will check out any noise made.

Oh, did you just accidentally hit an oil pipeline, resulting in a chain reaction that blew up local oil refinery? Congratulations, half the sector heard that and now every hostile within a couple kilometers is converging on your position. Have fun!

It's important to note that this isn't a twin stick shooter, it can be controlled like one, but it's not recommendable. Tank controls are superior for more advanced play because vehicles tend to be vulnerable from the back and mounted weapons usually can't rotate 360°. This probably contributed to the game's lukewarm initial reception, but it adds much needed depth to the combat.
The bulk of the game's content are freelance missions which consist on procedural generated mercenary contracts of different length that usually involve the destruction of something as the main objective. The environments in Brigador are completely destructible and collateral damage is rewarded, it also facilitates certain tactics such as blowing up an apartment building to create a nice choke point. There's also a risk-reward system with harder difficulty pilots and crappier vehicles awarding more money at the end of a mission.

The central conceit is that you play as a collection of mercenaries piloting a wide variety of mechs, tanks, or hovercraft (with an even greater variety of weapons) in a civil war raging on the planet-colony of Novo Solo.  The story is not terribly important (or really explained during gameplay at all), but the important thing to know is that the dictator who has been governing the planet for the last several decades has died, leaving turmoil and strife in his wake.  The lack of importance of the story, however, is fitting for your role: you do not care for the ideals or reasons of any side in the conflict.  You are there to earn a living in the destruction.  This is not Star Wars, where idealistic heroes fight nobly for the future of the galaxy.  This is the Spanish Civil War in space.

None of that really matters, though, because what really matters is the central gameplay loop of taking your chosen vehicle/weapons into an inhabited area and absolutely devastating it in whatever way the mission requires.  The main campaign provides a good series of introductions to game mechanics, different possible playstyles, weapon loadouts, etc, but really serves as an introduction to the main attraction of the game: the Freelance mode.

Freelance mode allows you to choose any vehicle and weapon loadout you want and take it for a spin in a level (or series of levels).  The variety of vehicles and weapons is very large, ranging from heavy, towering mechs to low-profile tanks, to zooming hoverbikes, and each one has its own mass profile, armor, shielding, speed, turning rate, and weapon mounts.  There is an even more impressive variety of weapons that you can mount on your vehicles: various mortars, lasers, machine guns, and heavy ordinance are complemented by quiet gamma ray emitters, EMP disabling devices, stealth camouflage, and more.  Naturally, each weapon functions differently and has different synergies with vehicle chassis and other weapons for you to unlock/discover.  I can't stress enough how satisfying the central gameplay loop is and how I keep coming back to experiment with different weapon/vehicle combinations.  The levels are also fully destructible, so you will get to see the scars that your brawls with enemies will leave on the streets, fields, and neighborhoods of Solo Nobre in your wake.   

What elevates Brigador above even its central gameplay, though, is the atmosphere.  The art direction, sound/music, and level design are gritty and thematic.  Every part of the design makes the setting and conflict feel authentic, and if you take the time to read the lore and written snippets surrounding the vehicles and weapons you are in for some of the best writing I've seen in a game.  The writing takes what could have been a generic (though very entertaining) isometric shooter and elevates it beyond the sum of its gameplay parts.  When you read the text describing the bureaucratic trevails of the military's engineers, the cultural significance of different areas in the city, or the smattering of the planet/city's history that is provided, all sprinkled with snippets of the futuristic evolution of Portuguese that the locals speak in the colony, it almost makes you feel bad when you level another apartment building with your cluster-bomb howitzer.

Scroll down to see the list of Mechgames I  enjoyed/hated on different 
platforms:C64,Amiga,Pc,Snes,Genesis,Ps2


I think this is the best Mechgame I played for quite some time, not only
gives you a good oldschool mech game but it has tons of different mechs
to choose from and also tanks. Baked into this there are lots of weapons
and euipment to choose from coupled with new pilots.
But the things I love the most is the awesomeness of the ton of detail
they put into all the levels to make them feel alive. Atmospheric wise
it gives a very cool feel of being in a huge mech since there are soldiers 
running around and small cars + civilians. 

Sound and music is not something to brag about and in noway to 
complain about either. Also it has full gamepad/controller 
support. You can also choose lots of different variants
of how to control your mech.

I also it gives you the feel I got when I first played a tank
game on the  Amiga where you could run over infantry and feelt
quite powerful in your machine.

+ Lots of mechs to unlock and choose from
+ Tons of details
+ Good retro feel
+ Atmospheric

- Not possible to adjust brightness or gamma in game.

If you want to relive the nostalgia of old school 90s shooters with the same era art style and great music or want to play as a mech and blow up buildings and tanks this would be for you....though not at the £23 price tag.

Comparing it to this era though its offers nothing new, interesting or engaging at all:

-""Campaign"" is a huge tutorial that repeats itself constantly on what all the controls are and uses immersion breaking scenarios to drill them home (units put in places outside the map just for you to fire at and being told ""let the enemy spot  you just this once to see what happens""). It doesn't offer anything interesting and your reward for completing a mission is another mission. 

-Very weak yet wordy ""story"" that you have to buy units to read up more of the lore. No interesting characters or personalities that keeps it entertaining just blocks of long texts that tell you to shoot things.

-Boring repetitive gameplay with no interesting mechanics just shoot at units from behind or over walls. Stealth builds are useless thanks to spotters that quickly alert everyone to you so its always shoot then hide then shoot etc. Easy to play easy to master. No variety in the missions just blow stuff up. How about a stealth mission? or escort a convoy? Or how cool would defending a base with ally soldiers from a massive enemy force be? But no just shoot and run away. How about some environmental factors? Like sandstorms, earthquakes or lava, or maybe wildlife to watch out for?

-Artwork is great but every bland. All units look the same on all factions and the world looks very dark, grey and boring for a cyberpunk colony. I missed several buildings to blow up because They looked just like the regular ones.

-no bosses, loadouts are very similar, weapons are boring and very few ""specials"" so making your own mech gets dull quickly with no real purpose.

summery: a simple WASD shooter with old style 90s graphics and good music. In today's era there are loads more better indie games for a fraction of the price, don't get this if you want a 'armored core' style game.

Do you like used future settings with lots of different vehicles and weapons? Do you like blowing things up? Do you you like synthwave music? ... Do you like relentlessly bleak settings with no good guys, war crimes and nigh-unavoidable civilian casualties? If you answered yes to some of these things, you might like Brigador. If you answered yes to the last thing, you should probably get some help. Who hurt you anyway?

Brigador is set on the distant colony world of Nova Solo, specifically a single, violent night in its capital city of Solo Nobre. Until recently ruled by the dictator ""Great Leader"", its former corporate overlords, known to us only as the ""Solo Nobre Concern"", are offering a high-paying contract to anyone on the planet who can destroy the city's orbital defense cannons and open the way for their invasion. As the titular mercenaries, you will wreak unholy havoc across the city with an array of vehicles, weapons and special abilities against the numerically superior forces of the city's Loyalist military, rag-tag Corvid rebels, and mysterious Spacers.

Though I had heard of the game before, I was introduced to Brigador properly by some of its developers in person at PAX East, and they were quite nice to speak with. I came away with the game and some goodies and was glad to help them out after I'd learned about the game's troubled history. Purely on the basis of it's gameplay, Brigador is unique and engaging. I can recommend it to fans of isometric shooters, with some stipulations: It's a good deal more challenging the most games of it's type, as well as more tactically complex. You have available to you mechs, tanks and hover-tanks, and each can be configured to move arcade-fashion, where directional controls move you relative to the screen, or a more simulator-style setup where up and down move you forward or backward relative to the direction of your vehicle's base, while left and right steer. Directional damage is a factor: Mechs take less damage when their upper body is facing the enemy, while the other vehicles take less when their body is oriented thus. Mechs can stomp enemies or crouch to reduce incoming damage, tanks can use a boost function, and hover tanks can perform a Unreal Tournament 2004-esque ground slam maneuver. Weapons have limited ammunition and firing arcs, and projectile weapon arcs take into account the movement of the vehicle, and have different degrees of effectiveness versus armor, shields or structures, and even different penetration values. Enemies occasionally drop ammo and shield pickups, however these ammo pickups can be destroyed so watch your fire. 

Aside from the campaign mode with its fixed selection of characters and setups, there is also a Freelance mode where you may use any unlocked stuff you wish, including a lot that isn't usable in the campaign. Based on your performance in a level, you earn money that can be used in the ""Acquisitions"" menu to get new pilots, vehicles, weapons, freelance missions and bits of lore. This lore is extensive, especially for the genre: every pilot, vehicle and weapon has some story behind it, and with the additional lore entries concerning the planet, its government, history and individual districts of the city, it all paints a surprisingly detailed picture. There's even a novel and audiobook.

Unfortunately, the more one learns of Brigador's setting, the worse it gets. A culmination of the bleak military fiction of years past seen in settings like Battletech or Warhammer, Brigador somehow manages to be even darker, and lacks the latter's overt parody. It appears to be a setting with no moral justice, no humanity and no hope. The player characters are at best ruthless mercenaries who have turned on their brothers and countrymen for the promise of a corporate paycheck and possible ""future opportunities"" with said corporation. Some are fighting for their families or fleeing past mistakes, but others are vicious sociopathic monsters. The money doesn't even go to their next of kin if they get killed on the job. There are achievements for killing civilians. And what information comes through about the bizarre Spacer faction is more gruesome still. 

Some might ask the question of why any of that matters in a game like Brigador. I had a friend who refused to read the codex in Mass Effect, seeing it as a waste of time. I say that if a developer adds lore entries to a game, they intended for them to be read as part of the complete experience. A game with a story often has some kind of message, even if unintentionally. A lot of games I've played and enjoyed had a positive message, or at least one worth hearing. Take CrossCode or Wolfenstein for example. What then is Brigador's message?

A solid action title with great music but an alienating premise, Brigador stands, I think, as an example of why we need the ""hopepunk"" genre to gain more prominence in the future.",1555129322,1558679790,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What would be involved is getting the pack file from the desired version, dumping it (adding a shortcut in your brigador dir, and then appending \brigador.exe"" -dumppack to the execution line). once you've dumped the pack, you'll need to overwrite the ""weather"" files that contain the lighting, then delete the existing pack, and then rebuild it from the loose files.

Pretty good deal for single game. The only problem is certain chassis just too small that i barely able to differ one with the other enemies and if the enemies start to swarm your unit then  visual noise is simply brutal. Just nitpicking but when you destroy building somehow it is not very satisfying but its my personal opinion.,1553839525,1553839525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I watched some gameplay videos before purchasing, and my experiences matched what I saw pretty well. It can feel a bit repetitive after a while, though.

Also has a lot of interesting artwork and lore buried within the game: some is in the mission briefings and much more is unlocked with in-game credits.

This game uses some sort of java engine, with a 900 MB install size. I enjoyed this game on an ubuntu linux quad-core desktop with 8GB of memory. The levels loaded extremely fast, and I generally had no technical issues.

I am disappointed. The trailers showed so much action, so I expected that, but it turns out this is rather about stealthy tactics taking it slow and sneaky. You can play it fast-paced, but even with the fastest vehicles (5 diamonds), 8 enemies chasing me, pilot difficulty 10 and alarm ringing the combat doesn't get intense enough to bring me into trouble (provided I use my preferred loadout). I can always pick up enough shield items, dropped by the enemies, so they never deplete my green health bar. It's not challenging enough for me. I feel bad for giving this a thumbs down. It's a really good game! But I want to warn and say that it's not for everyone. Whoever is with me here should try PION for an intense twin stick challenge.

[u]What I like[/u]
+ unlike most twin stick shooters your weapons here need time to turn to the position of your mouse cursor. Hey realism!
+ your two weapons have different turning speeds. Therefore you have two indicating projectile lines which you need to distinguish. There's a red and a bl...ah no, sorry, we have 80's style and this is Neon Magenta and Dark Sapphire. 
+ more unlike most twin stick shooters your projectile suffers gravity! Hey realism again! The height of each projectile is simulated. Your shooting angle in height is determined by how far your mouse is away of your vehicle. Therefore the right direction is not enough to hit your target, also the height angle must fit. But guess what, all targets have a height too! Most targets are big and easy to hit, except these tiny humans scurrying about the place.
+ projectile path is also dependant on your vehicle speed. They get a bit of your vehicle momentum of the moment when you shoot. Hell, this realism, omg!
+ the camera follows your mouse cursor / crosshair, but keeps your vehicle in the screen at all times. This way you can look ahead, but only where your mouse cursor is. Just like spying glasses. God damn realism again!
+ the direction of your weapons mounted to the cockpit and the direction of your drive below are independant of each other (for the default Mech vehicle and others too, but not all). Your movement depends on which direction your drive faces at the moment. Woah, so much realism! A yellow arrow indicates your drive direction. Also your vehicle has a turning angle. Often drive and cockpit have opposite directions. That makes the movement sometimes a bit off but you get used to it quickly.
+ everything is destroyable. From every building over each tree and bush to even the tiniest blade of grass can be erased with your firepower.
+ Instant loading! Progressing to a new map or loading new parts of the map does not take any time. At least it did for me. Instantly there, no waiting, wow.
+ Instant window change! Even when playing in fullscreen (not full windowed) it takes no time to switch between game and desktop. For me this is the first game which does that so wonderful. *applause*
+ tons of loadout possibilities (pilot, vehicle, primary weapon, secondary weapon, special gadget) lets you adapt the game to your playstyle. Go fast-paced with a small vehicle, tank-like with a big vehicle, stealth-like with camouflage featured vehicles or go random and play different each run.
+ pumping 80's Synthwave beats. Not as pumping as Carpenter Brut, more relaxed, but still very nice!
+ pixel-y and Sim City-ish / Command and Conquer 2-ish art style
+ This game is intended to be played with mouse and keyboard (The game says so). Controller is possible but not recommended. Controls are fine for me!

[u]What I dislike[/u]
- the game is called Brigador and the tutorial explains, that you don't go on the intended way, because you're a Brigador and push your way through. The game invites and even tells you to smash buildings to get through, but often punishes you for doing that really hard. Often you smash a wall or building and nearby buildings explode and do massive damage, often killing you and killing your whole long played run! Game Over only because of that one mistake. Doesn't seem so inviting for me to act like a Brigador!
- fast AGRAV vehicle ""Buckler"" with double Auxiliary ""Broilers"" is overpowered. Everything is too easy with this. These double equipped hit scan weapon makes ballistic projectile movement redundant and has also still a long reach.
- It seems this game wants you to play it safe and sneaky. I hate stealth games, sneaking around avoiding the fights. I want the fights! I want action! I thought this to be more intense, but it's rather tedious :-(
- Boring walking through already cleared areas. On most maps you won't find the best way to clear all targets within one straight path, but you need to go back or search for your target. Then you have to walk through some places again. This is enough to get me out of action and a bit impatient.
- There are many loadout options to be unlocked which set you in a really weak situation being vulnerable, but gives you extra reward for it e.g. ""Varlet"" the most expensive vehicle in the game costing 20 millions, but doing almost no damage and being very low on health/shield, slow and offering only weak weapons. There are more options like that. I like a risk/reward system to adapt the difficulty to your skill, but I want to make the enemies stronger, the environment more hazardous, not myself slower with only few options. This leads to stealth gameplay.
- If I was in charge of a corporation to buy military equipment intended to kill, I would not spend 2,000,000$ without any description of what I get. The description of your unlockables are only displayed after you purchased them and there is no refunding! I bought the mortar weapons and hate them, because they are in the air for AGES before coming down and doing damage. I guess this is only for siege or something like that. However, I wish I would get to know what I was buying before actually buying it!
- music is often not beating in action enough. Often chill, often even only ambiant sounds, that's too slack for my taste. 

[u]What I suggest[/u]
The campaign is basically a very long tutorial. Complete the first 5 campaign levels until you feel you know enough to begin and then hop into Freelance mode. This is the real game. DON'T make the same mistake as I by picking the cool looking pilot ""The Auditor"", this will remove all enemies off every level and make it a boring walking simulator. This pilot is only for map knowledge purposes and is NOT fun. Take the ugly looking one ""Norman Osberger"" instead, this will get you into the real gameplay. Also, don't take the default mech, it is slow as hell. Take one of fast anti-gravity ""AGRAV"" vehicles e.g. ""Buckler"" with higher speed rating, so that you can finish a level MUCH faster. With the Auxiliary weapon ""Broiler"" double-equipped things get easy. Buy the special gadget ""Audio-Kinetic Pulse"" as soon as you can. This destroys whole buildings and several enemies with only one shot! (Also OP) This will spare you much time and ammo (this has infinite ammo) which you need to destroy the target buildings. You could smash them with your slam attack (Space) but you risk blowing up with the whole building explosion ending your run. Don't do that.

[strike]I don't understand. Weren't there supposed to be enemies in this game?
I spent 50 minutes in Freelance mode without spotting any enemy!
I was NOT attacked by anyone! That was like a walking simulator, walking from target to target...reaaallly slooooooww...with oooobstacleeeees to smash before i can walk oooooon... *urgh* that was really boring. 

I thought this game was supposed to be fast-paced with intense fire fights!?!? I'm really surprised within almost 1 hour it didn't deliver ANYTHING (☉_☉)
You know, I don't have so much spare time to wait hours before a game begins. If I have time I want action, and this here is the very opposite. Or did I miss something?

I really dig the Sim City pixel-y art style and game mechanics, though.[/strike]",1551553467,1551803456,False,3,1,0.486863106489181519,5,False,False,False,False,,1551687942.0,"The 1st available pilot in Freelance mode is 'The Auditor' which removes all hostile spawns—the idea being to give players a stress free way to explore maps and test weapons/vehicles.

Start with the pilot 'Norman Osberger' and as you get tougher pilots I promise you the action will ramp up. If you want really fast paced action stick to smaller vehicles with higher move speeds or if you want everyone to come to you go with big vehicles and get the loudest weaponry possible; you'll aggro half the map when shooting but can wipe the whole screen in a few seconds.

If you haven't played through the campaign yet it will work you through the basics until the higher tier missions which can get really challenging especially in smaller vehicles."

Details
-------
There is just so much to say about Brigador that I can't sum it up in bullet points so i'm going back to my old style just for little bit with an in-depth review.

Brigador is an isometric twin stick shooter. It's not exactly top down like most others but rather a top and side view. In Brigador, you spend 95% of your time blowing things up, fighting multiple armies, destroying cities and ultimately liberating the game world. I honestly don't even know where to start reviewing this but I guess i'll review it in the order I experienced it.

The first option you get is a Campaign mode. The Campaign mode contains around 10~ish tutorial missions, 18 standard missions and around 10 more extra, more difficult missions. Upon completing the tutorial missions where you're assigned one specific machine, the later campaign missions allow you to choose from 3 then eventually 4 different machines each with their own strengths and weakness and i'll be talking about this a bit later. The campaign missions are almost all the same, generally having you destroying some building(s) or killing certain units. It's pretty repetitive but the setting and the soundtrack as well as the sheer addictiveness of the gameplay is easily enough to keep you going.

Speak of the soundtrack, it's full of amazing retro/synthwave/cyberpunk beats and the soundtrack alone is worth buying if you're into that sort of music. It's high octane and pumps you up, is super catchy and is always a blast to listen too.

Upon completing (or even failing) any mission you'll be given a bunch of money, which can be spent in the ""Acquisitions"" menu on all different kinds of things including different vehicles, primary and secondary weapons, different pilots, freelance missions and even game lore.

So now, what makes the game so interesting? Using your hard earned money allows you to open up more options in the Freelance mode where you can buy different missions (including the 18 standard campaign missions) and use your own custom machine in order to tackle it and this is where the game TRULY shines. No matter what machine you make with what weapons, it will always be REALLY good at something but also, REALLY bad. Some machines are far more difficult to pilot than others but the reward for using them is super high.

Do you want to pilot a literal siege tower of death that obliterates anything even resembling an enemy? Sure, but you're be moving no faster than a parked car. What about an assassin style of invisibility using deadly, one shot one kill hit and run tactics with a high speed machine? Of course, just don't expect to survive multiple hits from even the weakest machine. Do you want to drive a tank with nigh impenetrable armour that can literally roll over even the toughest enemies? You go for it but don't expect to be able to move in any other direction than straight towards the enemy. What about a small, 3 wheeled jalopy with no redeeming qualities other than the fact that if you manage to kill someone with it, you've shamed their family for generations to come? You go girl. The vehicle customization is ENORMOUS and the campaign gives you a taste of the different playstyles but the freelance mode is where the game truly shines. The list of weapons is endless, from straight up machine guns to bombs that rain death from above, to sweeping lasers, penetrating ballistic missiles and even poison over time that can travel through buildings.

Apart from the actual playable vehicles, you can also purchase ""lore"", which tell you more about the game world and story. EVERYTHING you buy including all weapons and machines has a piece of story information attached to it. Nothing is just ""there"", everything is a part of this large, expansive world. You can also purchase Pilots which act as the difficulty for your freelance missions. Since all freelance missions have the same objective, if you want a harder challenge you'll need to buy a new pilot. The default pilot makes it so not a single enemy even spawns in a freelance mission, but the more expensive pilots you buy, the harder the missions become but the better the payout is. The payout can then be used to buy more pilots, or vehicles, or missions in an almost endless cycle.

It's not so much the game play itself that is addicting but rather your own creation that makes the missions interesting. Sure, blowing up hordes of civilians and decimating entire cityblocks never stops being fun, but doing it in your own creation is pure joy.

Achievement wise, the game has such a diverse achievement list ranging from super easy to very difficult (including a 39 missions mission freelance run where death means you start again), with achievements for playing with certain machines with certain loadouts so you can examine different playstyles, to purchasing everything, beating the campaign with ALL machines (which is really quite difficult). It's an amazing list and I haven't seen one this good since I played RUINER (which is actually a very similar game to this).

On TOP of all this, Brigador gives you FULL access to it's developer console and game editor with the tap of a button allowing you to create new weapons and edit stats on the fly (although it does require some practice). With this, the customization literally becomes limitless.

So what about the problems? The controls aren't the best. There are 4 control options with none of them ever feeling ""good"" to use. The default controls means pressing W moves you to the top of the screen whereas using the old ""tank"" controls means pressing W moves you in the direction your vehicle is facing. Because the loadouts can be radically different (from tanks to hovercrafts to walking bipeds where the top and bottom control separately) you just have to end up accepting the control scheme you pick will have some serious flaws. The game can also be quite frustrating especially if you plan on going for all the achievements, with some of the campaign missions feelings almost impossible with some of the vehicles you need, but it does feel good when you finish. There's a missable achievement, missable as in you have to do it during a freelance mission but it's almost impossible to get and may be bugged so I suggest using the console to grant it.

All in all Brigador is one of those games where you'll play for a bit, get frustrated, then turn it on again 15 mins later just do get one more mission done and the next thing you know you've 100%ed the game and haven't even realised how much fun you had until it's over.

Neon lights, an authority violently overthrown, and buildings that crumble like they’re made out of ash under your mech’s stomping feet, all to a synth soundtrack. Brigador knows exactly what it wants to be. The good news is that it mostly achieves its vision, with a couple hiccups.

You play as a mercenary collecting a paycheck by completing missions in support of the Solo Nobre Concern. They’re offering a ticket offworld if you can help them overthrow the factions controlling the city of Solo Nobre. You’ll do this in an isometric action game from a variety of mechs, tanks, and anti-grav vehicles with dozens of weapons.

At first look, Brigador might remind you of the classic Strike series (Jungle Strike, Desert Strike, Nuclear Strike, etc) of helicopter action games, due to the vehicle selection and third-person isometric perspective. That’s not a terrible comparison, but Brigador offers a lot more. Not only is there more vehicles, weapons, and pilots, but more depth to the combat.

You’re armed with two weapons, and an auxiliary ability. Each weapon has its own fire rates, and their own behaviors. There are the standard machine guns and cannons, but also mortars, lasers, and shotgun-type weapons. Your mouse controls not only set the direction of fire, but also the range of fire, so you can launch mortars over walls, spray smoke canisters in semi-circles or lines, and shoot over or past enemies. This is cool in a lot of ways for the level of control it gives you over the destruction you’re going to rain down, but it complicates what is otherwise a fairly simple action game. Instead of just pointing in the direction of the bad guys and firing away, you’ve got to actually consider their distance and aim so that you’re not shooting in front of or over them. If you can’t get this and just treat it like any twin-stick shooter, you’re going to have limited, frustrating success.

The campaign mode offers a couple dozen missions with premade pilot/vehicle/weapon combinations that are fun, but it’s kind of training wheels for the operations mode, which is much more freeform. Operations mode lets you select any pilot, vehicle, weapon you desire, and go on a multi-map romp with an open set of objectives and building difficulty. Early options and low level pilots offer easy difficulty and a couple maps to stomp through, but unlocking high level pilots will greatly increase the resistance and later operations become endurance runs to see if you can manage to keep up your health and ammo count across several sprawling maps.

The music of Brigador is also notable for perfectly pairing this dystopian mech action with Vanity and Makeup Sets synth sounds. It’s a beautifully drawn game with a moody soundtrack that comes together very well. However, some of the weapon sounds could use some work. In particular, big cannons don’t really sound like the size they are. They nail the whirring sound of very large machine guns though, which is great.

Brigador is a great action game after you’ve figured out its quirks. It’ll frequently overwhelm and stomp on you, but rarely to the point of frustration. Your implements of carnage come in a large variety, so there’s a ton of action to be had. It’s only slightly marred by disadvantaged by doing more than action games of this nature normally do when it comes to weapon control, but that’s a gift once you’ve got the hang of it.",1550119751,1550119751,True,1,0,0.523195862770080566,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Am I drunk or just a bad driver? These controls are pretty difficult to get used to on a keyboard. I'm guessing it is probably more logical on a controller with a twin stick. That said, this game is a lot of fun to play! 

You have to destroy everything. The sounds and overall atmosphere make it a lot of fun to do. Very satisfying explosions and overall mayhem! 

You can drive various Mechs and each has a big arsenal of guns. Get destructo happy and just wreck the whole neighborhood, the buildings, the trees and the little guys that are frantically running around... oh and let’s not forget the actual enemies. You'd almost forget about them, since destroying everything else is already so much fun. I'd sometimes forget the main missions and just run around crushing everything. 

There are multiple possible strategies per scenario. Mine was simply to destroy everything you encounter. Perhaps you are more of the sneaky, stealthy type. 

The graphics style is really enjoyable, crispy clear sprite design with a splash of neon, along with a great 80's Stranger Things type soundtrack. All these elements give Brigador the final finishing touch. 

I am oversimplifying the game with this review, since there is a lot more to discover. Campaigns, the story, freelance mode, customization, multiple strategies and more.

If you enjoy loads of missions, strategy and destroying stuff Godzilla style, this one is definitely for you!

The Good:
+ Destroy everything 
+ 56 Mechs and customization
+ Many scenarios 
+ Graphics, sounds and just amazing detail
+ Good backstory and lore
+ Many hours of game time

The Bad:
- Difficult controls you need to get the hang of

How long to beat Brigador: Up-Armored Edition?
The main game story can be completed in about 8 hours, the main game + the extra's a total of 30+ hours of gaming fun. For completionists a whopping total of 230 hours. That is a lot of game time for your money.

Because sometimes, you just need to take a giant mech into a city center and blow everything up. And I mean everything.

In all seriousness, Brigador is a rather enjoyable isometric vehicle shooter game. There's plenty of bang for your buck.

GAMEPLAY
As stated above, it's an isometric vehicle shooter. You have 3 broad classes of vehicles to work with: tanks, mechs and anti-grav units. Each has their quirks in how they handle, but they all draw from the same pool of weapons and special abilities.
+ Basic gameplay is just...fun
+ Large number of weapons to play around with
+ Vehicle types offer just enough variation in gameplay
+ Freelance mode allows for near endless numbers of challenging scenarios
- Not much depth or variety to the missions/gameplay (spoilers: blow _everything_ up)
- Default controls are rather iffy
- Can be a pain in the ass finding stragglers
Look, the gist of Brigador is to blow everything up. If it moves, blow it up. If it doesn't move but stands higher than a few centimeters off the ground, blow it up. If you're in doubt, the answer in Brigador is yes, to blow it up.

How you go about this varies. In the campaign, you'll be choosing from a few preset loadouts for each set of missions. In Freelance mode, you can choose your own loadout, appropriate to the chassis you're using. Each weapon has something going for it- rate of fire, raw damage, AOE, DOT, efficiency vs shields, range, ammo supply are among the factors taken into consideration.

There's a lot of fun to be had here, and it can be pretty challenging, too. Choosing when to go loud on a mission, the effective use of terrain, understanding how to best use your loadout all factor into success.

But if you're sort that wants to clear all objectives on a mission, be prepared for some frustration, though. Not all enemies get drawn into the initial fracas you create- each faction has units that are especially irritating to find. Tiny infantry units with one; stealth drones with another; another with vehicles that resemble some props on the maps.

You may also find yourself asking....""but is there more?"" And the answer is no. It's not a meme. The only mission types are to blow stuff up. If you can't find ways to challenge yourself, this game will probably have rather limited replayability for you.

GRAPHICS
Clean and crisp visuals. A distinct retro feeling that makes me think back to the glory days of Red Alert 2 and TS. I'm sure there are better lookng 2.5D games, but this one is no slouch.
+ Vibrant and detailed environments
+ Excellent lighting effects
- Many tanks, mechs share common chassis'
- Maps have no height variations
I'll be honest, when I first started playing, it didn't even realize the vehicles weren't sprites or voxels until I noticed the way they interacted with the various light sources on the maps. And I love it. Maps are surprisingly detailed: city maps in particular caught me by surprise, with how densely packed they are. And the level of destruction possible makes playing around in them all the more enjoyable.

AUDIO
+ THE MUSIC
- the music eventually ends if you stick around too long on one map
Welcome to synthwave heaven. Brigador has an absolutely amazing soundtrack. It's perfect for the havoc you'll be causing. Sound effects are pretty much average, though.

It didn't take long for me to establish that I wanted this game, especially when I started watching the vids and reading the reviews.

I absolutely love the gameplay of Brigador, and the music that goes along with it just makes it that much better--plus I get to listen to the latter whenever, wherever, which is totally radical. Perhaps my favorite thing about this game is that it brings me back to my childhood, playing good ol' MechWarrior 3050 on my SNES, a game I still enjoy to this day. Of course, it's not the same game--not in the slightest--and it's not the same universe, either.
Indeed, Brigador is set in its own world, and it's absolutely full of lore and little details that just make you wonder how much thought went into creating it. My hat--if I had one--would be tipped far too much to remain on my head, this game's just that awe-inspiring to me.
Brigador also fixes a problem that other game had for me, which was the length of the campaign and the level of customization afforded to the player. Brigador's vehicles all have different capabilities, some to make things easier for you, others to make things harder, but they all have their place if used correctly (yes, even the Varlet). It's glorious how much freedom you have in flattening the environments (and the civilians) of Solo Nobre.
-As a side note, the Auditor pilot available in Freelance mode allows you to experience the game without enemy spawns, which is very useful for learning how to work these things if you need some time to adjust to a new loadout without worry of getting shot up.

Overall, I'd play this game a whole heck of a lot more if I had more hours (and energy) in a day. I love it too much for my own good, but I just don't have the time lol

What Brigador does well is pay homage to and emulate old isometric shooters. I love the aesthetics of this game, the soundtrack and gameplay feel is OK. It's fun to rampage around and destroy things. There is an attention to detail which can be admired. Brigador is a good effort, but falls flat in the packaging as well as the tactical aspects of it. 

Broken in many aspects of it's design and all of it reeks of post-completion crunch to pad the game time up:
-Campaign default difficulty seems to be set to as low as possible, which is a bit off-putting considering it's the first thing people would try and as it stays pretty much the same through out , it makes the campaign seem less exciting in it's length
-Then there's the AI which does fight back but many a times forgets that the reason we have such a selection of mech is that they are supposed to play differently, and running the lightest units at my heavy mech barrel line will get them dead.
 
- BUT THATS NOT THE GAME, no no no! The idea is that you get to see different loadouts and vehicles in campaign before you buy them to be available for Freelance missions, along the pilots which act as difficulty and payout level modifiers, that's the actual intended game, despite the campaign being on top of the list. I'll presume this might do something for the AI as well but I haven't unlocked highest difficulty pilots and missions yet to tell.

- All this is poorly conveyed, as well as everything else being bit of a padding with you having to unlock well written but quite pointless info about the items and story to know it. Which is all pretty much optional, granted, but then you have your actual factions backstories locked down and that's really counter-intuitive, like, why do I have to fight you to get that story? Isn't knowing that sort of prequisite of wanting to know more of this setting?

It starts off feeling maybe a little shallow. Not too terribly daunting once you get past the long list of vehicles you can pilot, or the almost excessive amount of pilots you can choose from. You might play it for an hour or two, have a bit of fun, and maybe put it down after a while in favor of other things. But, slowly, it'll start to sneak back into your thoughts. It could be the bumping soundtrack, it could be the long list of loadout options, it could even be the unique world that they've created. Because, at its core, Brigador has many quirks of its own.

Let's start with my personal favorite: The equipment. Brigador features a whole slew of vehicles, divided into catagories based on locomotion, then on faction. While not explicitly seperated in the list, these vehicles are all roughly sorted from high durability to low. In the case of Mechs, which are my personal favorite, you first are presented with giant, plodding, walking apocalypses, with progressively smaller and more mundane options opening up as you move down the list. Starting with the super heavy stuff may seem really backwards at first, since they certianly can trivialize some things. But, as you play, maybe trying out some of the ""weaker"" vehicles, you'll notice that what they lack in outright heft, they make up for with more options, both in armaments as well as engagement opportunities. For example, where a heavy mech would look down over all but the highest cover, certain small mechs have the ability to either stay hidden behind most cover or extend its legs for a quite shot at an enemy on the other side. It's differences in engagement that present a huge amount of choices. Do you pick a large, easy to see mech and hope you can wipe enemies out before you're swarmed, or will you opt for a more subtle, hit and run playstyle with the faster options the game provides?

On the topic of the vehicles, they aren't just a list of stats and a model. Each vehicle has a short bit of lore atteched to it that gives a look into either the history of the vehicle itself, or a glimpse of the world of Solo Novo. Furthermore, a considerable amount of attention was put into the design of the vehicles. Loyalist vehicles, being the most ""normal"" of all, sport simple, clean designs that prefer function over form. Corvid vehicles, which are used to fuel their revolution, are almost all either thrown together messes of car bodies and tank treads, or repurposed parts of other vehicles that were captured. Finally, Spacer vehicles, being an odd sort of ""wealthy elite private army"" group, all tend to feature unique, kind of strange designs. These all come together to create both an interesting combination of vehicles to pilot, as well as a long long list of enemies to take on. 

As for the presentation, that's one thing I just adore. Every single unlock has a piece of lore of varying complexity, ranging from a brutal look at the warfare employed on Solo Novo, to a look at the design processes of each faction, to ""It's a laser shotgun."" There's even a very interesting entry about the civilians, detailing the reason behind their strange look as well as the cultural value of their outfit.

All in all, Brigador was a sleeper hit for me. I went in expecting a plain twin stick shooter, and ended up with a deceptively deep game that has me hooked to the point that I'm eyeing the achievement list, a feat that only the dark souls series has accomplished before now. The game is worth it at full price, so if you think it might be your cup of tea, do yourself a favor and give it a shot.",1545810646,1545974939,True,29,0,0.765720665454864502,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But what makes it so much more than just that is the flavortext.  No, that's not a joke.  Every single map, Pilot, weapon, lore concept, and vehicle, including the non playable ones have a full paragraph or more written about its special quirks, how it came into service, crew oppinion, and other such things.

The setting is a genuinely interesting one.  Yes the 80s synthwave meme is a bit overplayed these days, but it works out in a way that doesn't feel forced in brigador.  Cassette tapes and CRT moniters work along side crainial jacks in this dystopian North Korea meets Rio Brazil in an An-Cap universe and it just kinda works.

I tried to explain the background of the game but I found that I ran out of space to write about actual game play.  So you should just read the in game lore and listen to the audio book.  Its excellently written and narrated.

So the game puts you in control of one of these brigadors who will risk everything to get rich and escape Solo Nobre alive.  In order to do that you have 68 playable vehicles that fall into five, technically six types, each with unique abilities and traits.

Powersuits: These are the smallest and weakest engines of destruction in Solo Nobre.  Their biggest attribute is their small size.  They excell at stealth.  Sneaking around large enemy formations and destroying objectives without getting caught.  They take a lot of skill to master at higher difficulties, but a job carried out in a power suit nets a hefty score multiplyer. Their melee attack is a stomp.  Useful for dealing with infantry and light vehicles like tread bikes.  Their special move is to extend their legs.  This allows them to shoot over lower objects and duck back down before the return fire comes in.  A useful tool for ambushes.

Mechs: Exactly what it sounds like.  A towering bi-pedal war machine.  These come in three subclasses of light, heavy, and ultra.  Ultra class vehicles get a damage reduction bonus due to their thick armor whereas some particualry light vehicles are open topped and get more recieved damage.  Mechs come in all shapes and sizes with some varients playing differently than others.  So I will leave it simple.  They have a stomp attack which can range from a slight upgrade of what a power suit can do, to one that will level city blocks and punch right through the top of a tank.  The mech's special move is crouch.  They tuck their legs in and get low to the ground, netting them a defense buff and allowing them to take cover behind lower obstacles.

Tread bikes: Because you gotta have a panzercycle in your cyberpunk game.  These are the powersuits of the tank tab.  Lightly armored, lightly armed, and only good if you absolutely know what it is you are doing.  These things are fast, but they can't crush obstacles all that well and are in general difficult to control.  Use them for stealth, hit and run tactics on objectives and try not to get tied up or cornered by a large battlegroup.  Their special ability and melee attack is the bull rush.  They zoom across the screen at breakneck speeds and gain a buff to ramming damage.  This might be enough to plow under other bikes and powersuits that try to stop you, but don't count on driving through a tank.  If you try ramming a mech, it will just step on you, killing you instantly.

Tanks: It seems self explanitory, but this also includes ramshankle technicals and gun trucks.  Some are fast, some are slow, some are well armored and some arent.  Their special ability varies between bull rush and downshift.  Bull rush is a charging attack that grants you a burst of speed and ramming damage, whearas downshift is the austin powers steamroller.gif attack which allows you to crush basically everything in your path at a leasurely rate.

Agravs: This is the most confusing class to play.  Agravs themselves are self explanitory.  Hover bikes/tanks.  They are usually agile and lightly armored, although some are rather sturdy and slow.  Their control sceme has them follow the mouse with W while A and D strafe around it.  Their special ability is to lock their orientation in one direction.  Useful for ones with turrets to facilitate drive by attacks and quick side strafing dodges.  Their melee attack is a belly slam which drops the vehicle ontop of anything it was hovering over.  Bikes will only be able to stomp out infantry and other bikes, whereas the larger ones can hit almost as hard as a mech.

TukTuk: A joke vehicle.  A simple three wheel delivery rickshaw with some light weapon hardpoints welded to it.  Good luck.

So how does the game play?  Its simple enough to learn, so simple that the tutorial is a bit insulting and drags on for far too long in fact.  But once you finish it, you are open to go way in over your head and get yourself killed.  There are a lot of things you will need to learn.  Wall penetration with different weapons, what explodes when shot, how difficult it is to crush a type of building to pass over it, But the most basic of aiming skills is the most important one of them.  You see, while the game is isometric, there is still height.  You need to aim directly at enemies in order to hit them.  If you try playing it as a normal twin stick shooter you will shoot over the target.  This can get very frustraiting at first, but I would advise you to git gud.

Your health is made up of hard shield and armor bars.  Hard shields can be regenerated and overcharged for a short period of time by picking up energy dropped by destroyed enemies.  Armor is your last line of defense and will not regenerate.  Enemies also have shields and armor, though they cannot recharge their shields.  Some weapons do devistating damage to shields, while barely chipping armor and vise versa.  So its a good idea to get a weapon that will fill in the gaps of the other.

If an enemy sees you, they will begin to power on their shield (if they have one) and try to kill you.  Unless its a spotter.  Spotters will report your location to all the enemies in the map which will have them all power on their shields and zero in on you.  This also raises walls that will box you in and severly hamper your movement.  Allowing them to sound the alarm is a good way to get killed quickly, so be mindful of that.

Unless you are playing the campaign, you have a choice on how to complete a level.  Destroy the orbital guns, kill all enemy commanders, or wipe out 70% of all enemies on the map.  Some vehicles are better suited to some tasks than others.  But its all up to you.  Do bear in mind that if you are a completionist and want to do all tasks, you can.  But expect runs to go into the hours.  It can be a quick game if you make it one.  But it can also be a very long one.  If you mess up and get yourself killed far into a full campaign run or similar, you will probably turn off the game in frustration and not come back to it.  For a few hours.  Then you will be right back into it trying again.  Its alluring that way.  The sound track isn't half bad if you like synthwave too.

The world building and vehicles are straight up inspired.  Many of the weapons are real world hardware that you can pick up on if you look at their discription and calliber close enough.  If you really like military hardware and reading, this game is practically worth it on that alone.  If you want a challanging twin stick experience like gungeon but more built on tactical planning than raw skill, this is a perfect choice.",1543270166,1543270166,True,18,1,0.713973581790924072,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game allows you to customize a huge variety of tanks, mechs, hovercraft and some other more unusual combat vehicles - including but not limited to a tank-treaded motorcycle, a bulldozer and a tuktuk - with an equally lavish armory that ranges from high-caliber machine guns and mortars all the way up to fully automatic laser beams and battleship cannons.

Brigador also features a remarkable wealth of background lore with regards to the weapons and vehicles you can acquire, with each and every item of the hundreds of pieces of equipment coming with a dossier that provides interesting tidbits regarding how that particular item fits into the world, as well as an extensive collection of general Lore entries that relate to the setting as a whole and the events that have lead up to this point.
The strong lore, in conjunction with the moody aesthetics and soundtrack, give Brigador a wonderfully dark atmosphere and an immersive quality that is perhaps unexpected in an isometric game.

Brigador is a game that offers enormous amounts of tactical depth in terms of the vehicle you choose, which weapons you decide to put on it and the pilot you select, with the pilot essentially acting as a Difficulty setting. This fine-tuning allows for a highly granular level of challenge; if the player desires a gentler experience they may select a tough vehicle that can mount powerful weapons, alongside a pilot that prevents enemies from scaling up between consecutive missions, while a player seeking a greater challenge might select a more delicate vehicle, or weapons with more specialized uses, or a pilot that causes enemies to scale more drastically.

Brigador offers a highly-configurable experience that can be a relaxing and cathartic explosion fest or a tense and challenging gauntlet requiring stealth and patience, and so I can comfortably recommend it to anyone.",1543257278,1543257278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If it was just that, it wouldn't stand out from others that well. 

Where Brigador makes things interesting is the story. It's pretty straightforward: you're a mercenary taking work on a world whose ultra-oppressive, centralized government is crumbling and the various factions present are each eager to strike out now that the chance to do so is present. The more missions you do, the more money you earn, and the more information you unlock about the world. It's a journey of discovery, told through blood and explosions.

The levels and art design is where this game really shines. Everything can be destroyed or blown up, meaning you can play missions as fast or slow as you want, and different vehicles and weapon systems change up how difficult a mission can be. The game also challenges you to beat missions with specific loadouts or vehicles, with some loadouts offering high payouts because just coming back alive from using them is tough. 

However, this also means the game is a bit grindy. While the variety of levels, vehicles and weapons will let you play the game a variety of ways, after a while it becomes a title you'll play every once in a while when you feel the urge. Thankfully, it's a game that delivers well in that respect.

If this game has one big problem, its a lack of multiplayer options. The game is easily too overwhelming for local co-op, but an option for online co-op would have been great.",1543212494,1543212494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Most goals are a simple ""kill them"" or ""demolish these"", but the variety of loadouts, enemies, and maps keeps everything feeling very fresh. The Loyalists, Spacers, and Corvids each have their own roster of vehicles, weapons, and pilots that are unlockable through gameplay, and the pilot/vehicle/weapon descriptions are displayed as information collected by the Solo Nobre Concern (the people paying you to shoot your friends in the back). There's plenty of fluff/lore to read through, and none of it gets in the way of simply playing the game. There's also an audio book for anyone who wants to take a further dive into the setting of Brigador. All-in-all, I'd absolutely recommend this game for anyone who's into run and gun arcade action.

It's a isometric sci-fi vehicular combat game that gives you a single well-armed vehicle and a set of missions to complete (similar to the Strike games), and has you navigating a futuristic cyberpunk city rife with corruption and chaos (similar to Future Cop: LAPD).

You can choose from a large variety of vehicles from the game's three factions, and select two weapons based upon the available hardpoints and one special ability.   While the campaign missions restrict you into using specific loadouts, the real fun comes when you begin to experiment with various vehicle and weapon setups in the Freelance mode, and see just how far your design can make it before succumbing to the enemy hordes.

Choosing which pilot to play with is arguably the most confusing part: they don't impact your vehicle performance in any way, but instead govern the difficulty and payouts given at the end of each operation.  For example, the starter pilots will start off at the lowest difficulty levels, nor will the diffculty rise when progressing through the districts.  But in exchange, their payouts and bonus multipliers are far less rewarding.  In contrast, the most expensive pilots will likely start at or near the highest difficulty, but in exchange receive generous bonuses upon completion of an operation.  Oh, and a few of the vehicles themselves serve as difficulty gauges in obvious ways.  For example, piloting a heavily armored mech with dual 30mm gauss cannons is going to be a cakewalk, where in contrast driving around in a small, paper-thin Tuk-Tuk with only small hardpoints is going to SUCK if you selected one of the higher difficulty pilots.

And when they say you can destroy everything in the environment, they do mean EVERYTHING.  The only indestructible objects in the game are the large concrete wall barriers at the edge of the level, and the occasional alarm barrier that is raised under certain circumstances.  And at no point are you ever penalized for being destructive as possible: you're given payment for every single bit of property destruction you cause, ranging from knocking down trees to demolishing city blocks.

The only flaw (if you can even call it that) is that there is no co-op multiplayer.  I suppose it would've been only a whimsical addition and would've made many of the levels far too easy, but the idea of playing through one of the longer Freelance Ops with a friend would've been a blast.  Again, I don't really hold this against the game - its just an addition I wish could've been made.

In conclusion, if you like retro vehicular combat games and causing wanton destruction, go ahead and buy Brigador, you'll absolutely love it.",1542956807,1542956807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Brigador is an isometric game with masterfully crafted bitmapped tiles for the map. Think something akin to the original Syndicate with very high-quality graphics. The vehicles seem to be fully 3D animated, and the looks and lighting work very well together. 

It's quite rare to find a game that is retro but doesn't need to be low-resolution pixel art. The games of old were not low-res for aesthetic reasons, but because of hardware limitations. Brigador goes the extra mile and satisfying the craving for retro sensibilities while not sacrificing graphical quality. 

It's quite clear this game had a long, healthy development cycle as the gameplay is balanced and the controls are quite responsive. 

There are a campaign mode and freelance missions, but they play relatively the same. There are no RPG elements, you play as a series of different pilots, and not as a single individual. The main difference is that the campaign is linear and has a series of preset Brigadors with loadouts and pilots. 

It's not quite accurate to call it a mech game, as you can fly a plethora of vehicles, varying from towering mechs to tanks, a-gravs hovercrafts and other types of vehicles, from power armors to even motorcycles.

The three main factions are a bit stereotypical in a good way: the Loyalists are the standard military-militia type, which favors bulky military gear, the Corvids are bandits out of Mad Max or Fallout, using improvised, irresponsible equipment made from leftover cars and random parts, and the Spacers are high tech offworlders who favor energy weapons. Each faction has a very distinct personality, look and feel to their vehicles and weapons.

While in the campaigns each Brigador usually has a faction-appropriate pilot and loadout, you can really mix it up on the freelance mode with varied, wild setups that can be quite rewarding.

The difficulty is fair and, for the most part, adjustable through a clever risk/reward mechanic: the pilots and vehicles have multipliers, so the bulky mechs with easy pilots offer a light challenge for a modest financial reward, while nimbler, lighter vehicles with hard pilots provide the best reward.

There's a lot of story and worldbuilding, provided by optional, non-intrusive texts, which you may dive into our skip at your leisure. 

The music is quite good and adds a lot to the overall atmosphere, being a superb complement to the visuals.

The best description I can give for the gameplay is Hotline Miami or Syndicate with mechs, tanks and hovercraft. Where HLM is a bit more frantic and twitchy, rewarding mayhem more than anything else, Brigador is far more tactical.

The isometric view and destructible environments of varying durability and height create meaningful choices in how to approach a fight. Do you blast the enemy through a thin fence, lure them into a narrow passage where their numbers don't count or blast them sky high with a conveniently placed ammunition depot or fuel station? The approach to difficulty is also unique. Instead of placing more enemies in a level or boosting their health, you instead pick from vehicles that are more or less difficult to use. Using hover tank with a cannon that can level a city block doesn't earn you as much money as a small mech that relies on a cloaking device and subterfuge to complete the mission.

Brigador: Up-Armored Edition is a game developed by Stellar Jockeys and Gausswerks and published by Stellar Jockeys

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same, the game's graphics reminds me of the classic SimCity games with it's 2.5D perspective, the game does suffer with some really confusing and awkward gameplay mechanics

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game and the controls both on keyboard and on a controller is absolutely annoying and a chore to do but a fun game nontheless

Brigador: Up-Armored Edition overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts!

Este é Brigador: Up-Armored Edition[/h1]

Brigador trata-se de um shooter twin-stick com bons controles de mouse e teclado, embora tenha a complicação extra do movimento alternando entre girar e bombardear, que dependerá da máquina que você estiver pilotando, sendo um mech ou um tanque. 

No game há uma forte necessidade de tática, particularmente em termos de munição e gerenciamento de saúde, física de armas, controle de multidões e particularmente visando inimigos específicos antes que soem o alarme. Brigador é glorioso de se contemplar - paisagens urbanas abrangentes e detalhadas, cobertas pela noite salpicadas de neon, tranquilas e pacíficas ao iniciar o nível, mas ficará destruída por completo no final do nível.

Por um lado, o jogo parece com um Lo-fi, mas em contrapartida a maré de destruição e as unidades intrincadas, me fazem sentir como se eu estivesse jogando um jogo de tabuleiro em uma vida explosiva e bem iluminada.

Um explosivo cuidadosamente implantado pode criar uma grande reação em edifícios, porém só basta um piscar de olhos bem cronometrados e poderá ser despachado uma horda de inimigos simultaneamente. Tudo em Brigador é uma experiencia única, recriado com escalas e efeitos impecáveis, sobrepondo muitos do seu mesmo gênero. Espero que o fã teimoso do Mechwarrior entenda, pois, a categoria de mech lovers ficará satisfeito com o Brigador.

Particularmente, eu gostei de tudo o que Brigador faz, porém ainda não achei suficiente, apesar de seus maravilhosos brinquedos robóticos, carnificina em escala industrial e estética impecável, às vezes ele pode ser frustrante. O game não é difícil, mas a apresentação da interface torna a vida do jogador mais difícil do que se imagina.

Eu tive um problema com a distância dos medidores de saúde, escudos, munição, que ficam posicionados no canto superior esquerdo e os são da ação, que se espalha amplamente na área central da tela.

O jogo faz parte do gênero do roguelike, ou seja, a morte neste jogo custa todo o progresso em mapas que geralmente são grandes e desafiadores. Alguns dos níveis da campanha também são desavergonhadamente brutais – conceder um mech extremamente forte, como uma fortaleza móvel do tamanho de uma torre e com apenas uma mão aniquilar uma onda incansável de unidades velozes que lutará para te destruir.

A boa notícia é que ficar preso ou desanimado em algum nível não será um obstáculo, pois pode ser usado o pular missões freelance, que apresentam mapas menores, diferentes desafios e o mais importante, a opção de configurar as compras de mechas, pilotos, armas e habilidades. Ao invés de ficar apenas com as opções pré-fabricadas oferecidas na campanha. 

No entanto, este não é um game que você está jogando somente pela história, mas sim para fazer grandes destruições nas cidades e esmagar soldados. Por isso, é importante ter opções de lugares diferentes para ir e experimentar, em vez de ficar preso somente em algum modo. Brigador possui também uma impressionante variedade de veículos no jogo, como por exemplo: o abrigo rápido que pode ficar invisível.

O dinheiro poderá ser ganhado em qualquer modo, seja ele o da campanha ou do freelance, e podem ser gastos em atualizações e desbloqueios incluído de novos mapas. Então, caso você esteja repetindo várias vezes a mesma missão, só basta comprar uma nova.

A escolha do armamento está bem diversificada, desde metralhadoras simples até o lento recarregamento de railguns, bombas tipo daisy cutter, variados canhões e foguetes. Existe muitas armas que tem os nomes parecidos, para descobrir e muito menos lembrar o que exatamente faz leva um certo tempo. A metade da diversão de Brigador está em apenas descobrir o que seu novo investimento é realmente capaz de realizar no meio da cidade, ou melhor, a zona industrial que em breve se tornará um campo flamejante, fumegante e cheio de cascalho.

Contudo, Brigador: Up-Armored Edition é um título interessante – monte o seu mech ou death tank dos seus sonhos, faça um giro em Blade Runner Ville, acabe com tudo em sua volta e tenha uma ótima luta.

“Brigador” is an old school retro-style top down tactical shooter, where you play as one of severalhigh-skilled mercenary pilots, driving various types of vehicles and taking part in fights for a colony located on a distant planet. As you can see from the videos and screenshots, the game’s main feature is ability to destroy literally anything within map limits. It’s rather clear that Brigador uses BattleTech (later known as Mech Warrior) as a source of inspiration. But let’s take a deeper look at the game:

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
The story is supposed to be unlocked and guessed by players on their own, as it comes with short pieces, part of which can be unlocked for cash. Main flow goes this way: There used to be a cruel leader on one distant colony planet. Duo to his poor leadership, the colony had fallen from prosperity to the dark ages. However the Great Leader had died and soon after his death, multiple factions started fighting to gain power and control over the planet. One of such factions decided to bribe most skilled pilots on the planet and hire them for the dirty work. Obviously, you represent these pilots and deliver devastating strikes on the targeted areas. 

With all that being said, though, it’s worth mentioning that storyline isn’t quite most important thing in the game.

[h1]The atmosphere:[/h1]
Everything Brigador is saturated with nostalgia: Dark red colors, main menu looks, vehicle and buildings style, the music, all of that reminds you of some dark sci-fi, or apocalypse movies from back ‘80s.

Maps are quite variative aswell: Industrial areas, with all those dumps of broken and abandoned vehicles; green parks and cementries, filled with many tiny details; cyberpunk themed downtowns, or living quarters with huge amount of parked cars and traffic jams – each region has own looks and story behind it.

As it was mentioned above, the sound also contributes for the nostalgia feeling and remotely reminds of most famous melodies of sci-fi movies of said era. It sounds both stylish and old. The only real issue with music is that there’s short amount of tracks available in game , so you’ll have to listen to the same melody over and over again during battles.

 [h1]Gameplay analysis:[/h1]
Game menu meets you with multiple points. Let’s cover three most important of them: Freelance, Campaign and Acquisitions: 
“Freelance” is a game mode which lets you choose your favorite vehicle, equip it with weaponry and special ability on your choice and proceed to an operation selected by yourself. Basically, it’s sort of skirmish with a  set of rules you make for yourself. It’s necessary to mention, though, that the variety of vehicles and equipment is pretty high, so even one mission can be played in a multiple ways, depending on the vehicle and equipment you choose.

“Campaign” tells you the story of the planet and gives missions with pre-set pilots and equipment. You can consider it as some sort of challenge mode. You earn cash for each completed mission. The more destruction you delivered and more goals you completed, the more cash you have earned. 

“Acquisition” is not quite a gamemode, but rather is a place where you spend your money on purchasing equipment for “Freelance” mode and unlocking more info about game world, in case you’re actually interested in storyline.

As for actual gameplay, it feels quite old school and reminds 16-bit BattleTech game from 1994, yet with refreshed graphics and a bit more abilities. It’s not an insult though, as game feels similarly good and intense when you need to maneuver between several large groups of enemies confronting you from multiple sides, trying to avoid massive damage and charge up shields by walking over dead enemies. 

Usually during each shootout some random shot accidentally hits fuel station or highly explosive pipeline and whole region turns into a huge messed up pile of burning wrecks, sometimes capable of destroying most of your enemies, or even your vehicle as well. Now repeat that situation about ten times and you’ll have your average Brigador match. So yeah, if you like huge explosions and collapsing buildings, you’ll sure love the gameplay. High destructibility, however, actually plays an important role from the perspective of tactics, but I’ll leave that for you, the player, to discover…

[h1]Making up conclusions:[/h1] 
So as we’ve covered most important parts of the game, it’s time to sum everything up and have some final words…

[b]What’s good:[/b][list]
[*][i]Retro futuristic atmosphere style[/i]
That has already been covered, but game really gives you that cool nostalgia feeling.
[*][i]Total destructibility[/i]
Anything can be destroyed. The only thing which prevents you from destroying all the objects on the map is amount of ammunition your vehicle carries, but apart from that, there are no limits really.
[*][i]Large variety of equipment and pilots to choose from[/i]
That, combined with previous point, gives game quite deep tactical aspect. It’s only up to a player if it’s worth using artillery fire, or hiding between tall buildings, or blow up something highly explosive… You are the one to choose own playstyle.[/list]

[b]Not-so-good:[/b][list]
[*][i]Repetitive mission tasks[/i]
Unfortunately most missions feel the same way, despite maps being diverse: You always have to destroy some units, some orbital guns and supply stations. There’s no advanced and more dynamic missions, like defensive objectives , or some evacuation missions whatsoever. Perhaps devs could have a look at some RTS games as a source of inspiration?
[*][i]Lack of Coop or at least some allied units[/i]
A game like Brigador, which is filled with nostalgia for old games not having at least some 2-player mode makes me personally really sad. Truth to be said, netcode is hard to write, but devs could’ve done at least some missions where pilots are supposed to cooperate with friendly AI in solo mode. PvP in such game would be even better addition but I’m going way too far now.
[*][i]Limited amount of equipment you can use on vehicle[/i]
Despite large variety of weapons, player is able to only choose two of them and one special ability, which significally cuts down the tactical aspect.[/list]

[h1]The conclusion:[/h1]
Brigador is a nice game which can surely bring you some fun and help you with spending some boring evenings. It does, however, have some issues, biggest of which is repeatability, but other than that game is alright. After all, there aren’t many games where you can stomp down whole city and leave it in ruins after mission is completed.

For a short review, this game is its dystopic cyberpunk grandson that pulled off everything perfectly.

For the long review; here it comes.

Brigador gives you three types of vehicles, the most dystopic setting and lore possible with the best synthwave soundtrack to go along with it. So, you may say, what does it warrant for me to buy it? What happens after finishing the campaign with only a single choice of 4 given vehicles in any scenario? Why should I even ""freelance""?

Same thoughts went along my mind. Although i loved it, for years i only played it 30-min mark most, with one or two campaign maps cleared at most. It's like the sublimest of drugs, for it hits you when you are determined to finish it once and for all. Gotta get all these campaign maps cleared with each one at least in such an enjoyable game, right?

That's when it hit me specifically, trying to finish Wait For The Blackout with the mech Fence.

It was more or less of a breeze up to that point. Try a feew different tactics and that was it. But at that level, at my 7th try I finally understood the mindset of people that created this game and it was truly a piece of art. 

That explosive next to that building? That unit spawn next to the ammo building? That vehicle not having an Aux Secondary but a Turret? All of that is PLANNED. All of it is INTENDED. 

Level names are strange, right? No, they are much, much more than that, they are song names. Just youtube them.

Most mechs have nearly same parts, right? Yes, of course because that would actually be instead of BattleTech's ingenius and hopelessly flawed designs. Why create huge chests and arms for a f--kn mech??? 

And with all these details, the game has a placeholder as a piece of art. Because every detail is handcrafted, everything has a reason and the lore is a masterpiece of real world where sh-t would hit the fan just as it would. And it grows on you. You suddenly begin to talk about the mechs and vehicles in ""turret turn speed"" and ""forward acceleration"" terms.

And in variation? Here we have the open topped light support mechs, treadbikes, treadbikes with side wheels, hovering construction vehicles turned artillery platforms, flying limos with guns on both sides, an aeroplane that lost its wings because it no longer needs it because it just got upgraded with an anti grav engine, the only Tank Police style ball-wheeled tanks in any game, more mech variations that satisft even the pickiest Gundam fan, guns, futuristic guns, guns that spew silent radiation, railguns, a damn Mk12, a mining laser, an EMP rocket, a shortbarreled anti-tank rifle, even the old Carl Gustav himself.

Just go ahead and buy it even if you are slightly interested. Sooner than you know, you will crash apartments with your futuristic tank just to flank some idiots who have no idea, you will emerge from the low wall you have been hiding your powersuit to snipe some huge mech that would have no problem stomping you, you will strafe among the blackened future city streets running and gunning after blowing up the power infastructure.",1537013343,1537013343,True,5,0,0.578100979328155518,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Then you begin with a stream of tutorials, plodding around and learning the game's controls and features one by one. Then you get several missions which are complete pushovers in slow vehicles with boring loadouts. Then things finally start to get interesting, as each mission presents a tactical challenge that can be solved a different way by the four equipment sets on offer.

The game's free play mode is where the real magic happens, where you can mix and match combinations of vehicles, weapons and maps to your heart's desire. Unfortunately, all of the above has to be unlocked, meaning that the most fun part of the game is gated at the start. It's also poorly explained - if I hadn't hit up the wiki beforehand, I would have had no idea how the freelance meta works: that the pilots act as your difficulty selector, determining how much opposition you face and how much money you earn. It so happens that this also determines how much fun you have - once you master the controls, you'll find that the lower tier pilots are total walkovers. You'll push yourself to the bottom of the list, running the weakest vehicles at the highest difficulty for the biggest rewards.

If you enjoyed playing the old BattleTech/MechWarrior game on SEGA Genesis or SNES, or if you were a fan of Jungle Strike and Desert Strike, you'll feel right at home in the cockpit of one of BRIGADOR's huge roster of vehicles, including stompy battlemechs, tanks that can roll through anything, and nimble hovercraft that fit right in with the retro-cyberpunk atmosphere. The game also gave me strong flashbacks to the isometric tactical simulation MechCommander--though a different genre, BRIGADOR is a lot like what MechCommander would be if you only commanded one mech.

You'll be fighting a somewhat clandestine war to destabilize the despotic government of a planet called Solo Nobre. The locale will make you think of a Portuguese version of Blade Runner's future Los Angeles. It's dark, moody, and suffuse with neon lights. You can also immerse yourself in the character biographies and lore notes about all of the game's vehicles and weapon systems--this intel goes a long way to making you feel like you're actually in the setting.

Controlling your mech or fighting vehicle of choice feels smooth and polished. Lots of different enemies and approaches keep missions from becoming repetitive. Best of all, while some obstacles can stop bullets temporarily, everything in BRIGADOR is destructible. Your mech can bust down walls to get the jump on enemies who realistically have weaker armor on the rear than they do on the front. Hostile AI is also surprisingly effective. They can be alerted by sound alone, and some enemies will actually bother to alert their allies. Many of the missions can offer a real challenge as a result.

BRIGADOR is not likely to be a game that you will sink hundreds of hours into, or replay half a dozen times. It's not going to offer you a compelling story or meaningful decisions. It's more of a fun, fast action experience you can jump into at a moment's notice to sink an hour or two, and will wow you with its atmosphere as much as its gameplay.

I really had an initial attraction to the game for purely aesthetic reasons - the soundtrack was by favorite artist; Makeup and Vanity Set. The gritty, retro-but-sophisticated, ultra-greebled cyberpunk art and setting appealed as I was riding a heady wave of William Gibson, Synthwave, and anticipation of Blade Runner's sequel and Cyberpunk 2077. It has customizable mechs, which pretty much grabs my inner child by the lapels and drags them in front of the part of my brain that controls the paypal account. The witty and cynical flavor texts which abounded throughout the game, telling the story of Solo Nobre and Novo Solo via blurbs under each gun, mech, pilot, and mission, gave me something for my mind to chew on, creating the world in which I could imagine my actions and their consequences as part of a larger story; the brutal, often short lives of my pilots merely corporate subscripts of a savage struggle for power in the wake of Great Leader's death.

But at first, especially before they revamped the control options menu in a later update, I was really not sure whether all of this artistic achievement was attached to gameplay that was actually GOOD. I was frustrated:

- the levels are flat
- the levels are sometimes brutally hard, sometimes stupidly easy
- the game often doesn't give you enough information to make good purchasing decisions
- levels get rehashed across different freelance campaigns
- weapon balance is nonexistent; some are absolutely terrifying, others are nigh useless - some can defeat all opponents, others are good specifically only at defeating some
- the game is way too damn dark
- no multiplayer/coop
- a game which cried out for cutscenes, voiceovers, and randomized levels/freelance campaigns had none
- the game conflates points with money and then makes it super-easy to earn a ton of both by destroying the level (you get money for destroying pretty much anything), but the levels are huge and fundamentally this means the game is asking you to trade your time for achievement (a lame grind to do better than other players/advance through the game).

Gradually, though, as I came back to this game over and over again (thanks in large part to the fact it could be played on any of my computers since it supported Linux), I came to realize most of the above criticisms had valid answers, or were the result of looking at the game wrong:

- flat levels are intricately populated with a 2D urban jungle of structures, flora, and vehicles which provide a diverse array of tactical options
- the hard levels you have to prepare and conserve for; the easy levels exist for that purpose; they vary the gameplay so that it's not always so tense, but always important.
- while it's not necessarily a great dev decision, omitting info prior to purchase forces players to make do with what they end up buying, pushing players to innovate tactics and loadouts. Almost every level (with notable exceptions) is so open-ended that it is impossible to find yourself without a means of accomplishing through subterfuge what brute force could not - and that is immensely satisfying.
- level rehash becomes more understandable once your realize how ridiculously intricate and large these levels are, and how they were constructed to push players to use all the tools available to them - who would have guessed that if you know you'll be fighting in a cemetery, it makes more sense to use a grav than a tank or mech, for instance?
- weapon balance actually ends up being a problem - not that it's not fun to use immensely powerful weapons when feeling lazy, or super crappy ones when feeling up to a challenge - but more because the devs unknowingly removed one of the more interesting dynamics present in some other mech games - the need to balance guns which damage shields and those which focus on armor/hull damage. It's still here, but it's just not as important as in other games if you don't want it to be, and the game loses some sophistication because it leaves that wrinkle behind.
- the game actually looks fine if you brighten your monitor up or get one that can display blacks nicely.
- the AI in the game ends up being sufficient, but future multiplayer in a sequel game is undeniably desirable
- cutscenes, voiceovers, and randomization would also all be great; no denying it.
- I'm still kind of interested in the problem presented by giving payers almost unlimited points opportunities in each level, but only if they grind... but honestly it doesn't bother me as much as it used to. The game is just fun to play through without worrying about the points, and if you do, you'll always have plenty of cash to play with as you expand your arsenal. This will only matter for people trying to achieve top scores.

So at the end, you get a game that's a good game in the tradition of something like Dynasty Warriors, but with a truly excellent presentation. It may not bring anything ""new"" to the table, but that which it does bring, it brings with truly unbeatable style and quality. Definitely buy and hope Stellar Jockeys makes more of this franchise in the future.",1533067370,1533067370,True,5,0,0.524215400218963623,2,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]LONG RAMBLING BELOW, NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME IN ANY WAY[/h1]

This game reminds me a bit of an isometric shooter from the '90s, Crusader: No Remorse. I'm not sure if this comparison will be completely fair, but I'm going to give it a try.

Brigador has by far easier controls. Crusader was very flexible but too ambitious to the point of being daunting. I would love to re-play it using Brigador's ""isometric tank"" controls, I can see it working very well.

Playstyle wise, they're also very similar. Both of these games pit you in maps with a relatively destructible environment (Brigador more so, being a mech/tank game) which you can use to distract and destroy your enemies. Both of these games have a focus on traps and stealth (going head-on without some plan to control crowds, manage aggro and flank can result in your death real fast).

Style-wise, they also feel rather similar: retro-industrial tech aesthetics, isometric view, focus on destruction. Let me elaborate on this.

While both games feature lots of destruction, I think they handle it differently because of their scale. In Crusader, you control a single super-soldier infiltrating and attacking the outposts of an evil mega-corporation. You use a varied arsenal of both realistic and sci-fi weapons, plus a very destructible and hazardous environment to get rid of enemies (or yourself). Death in this game is gruesome and horribly detailed: shoot someone with an RPG, they will go up in flames and run while screaming in pain. Microwave guns melt the flesh off their skeletons. A broken teleporter will disintegrate its unlucky user into a pile of red goop. You can use all these against enemy guards, as well as unlucky workers or scientists. It's up to you to decide if that's OK. The game grosses you out by sparing no detail.

Let's contrast that to Brigador: while this game also has a huge arsenal, the effects of the weapons don't seem to be so varied. Shoot a building and it will crumble. Shoot an enemy and it will explode. Shoot a fleeing civilian and it will splat. So there's not much variety there. The difference is just how easy it is to even accidentally destroy the environment while you walk through it, and it's pretty much inevitable you will kill civilians. The other difference is morality: while Crusader used the ""evil mega-corp"" to mitigate the guilt a bit, Brigador doesn't hold those pretenses. You're leveling whole cities, from favelas to mansions in the suburbs, while the residents flee. All sides of the conflict do this, without penalties. Some missions happen in cemeteries, so even the dead don't get to rest.

Once I realized this, I felt a little sick and it made me re-evaluate how I was playing. This game grossed me out not because of the detailed description of death, but because of the scale of the destruction and its implications. I've heard the (audio?)book is great too, I need to read (hear?) it.",1533020455,1533020455,True,1,0,0.501940488815307617,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Visuals/Sound[/h1]

If you've heard of [i]Brigador[/i], there's a pretty good chance you've already heard about its stellar soundtrack. Heavy and entrancing synthwave by way of synthwave electronic pioneers [url=https://makeupandvanityset.bandcamp.com/]Makeup and Vanity Set[/url] clocking in at 2 hours of head-pulsing and nostalgic synth tones and retrofuture beats set the neon 80's vibe here.

There's a whole heap of isometric eye candy to go along with it from its atmospheric retrofuture urban landscapes with the oppressive overtones of authoritarian cyberpunk dystopia. A vision best seen in arthouse masterpieces of the late 80's and early 90's like Gilliam's [i]Brazil[/i] or Otomo's [i]Akira[/i]. The beautiful chaos of destruction on full display as buildings crumble to your firepower and insignificant little humans crush beneath your metal feet like bugs.

[h1]Final Thought[/h1]

If you're one of the poor, unfortunate souls who hasn't been bestowed with exposure to [i]Brigador[/i]'s cyberpunk greatness just as I was until recently, this is the perfect chance to remedy that mistake. Two years down the road and I'm still not sure if [i]Brigador[/i] ever got the exposure it deserved, but what I do know is that it has a very dedicated and deserved fanbase of diehard enthusiasts who delve into every facet of its lore and world.

One thing's for sure; the brothers at Stellar Jockey know what the hell they're doing, and I certainly hope they continue on with their heavy and gritty take on cyberpunk authoritarian dystopias.

虽然官译名字很奇怪，但这是一款画面华丽，手感奇佳的45度俯视角双摇杆机甲射击游戏。
—————————————————————————
虽然不知道作者用的什么引擎，看起来是仿古2D点阵画面,但是渲染出的光影效果别有一番华丽的韵味。优点不少：
1.机甲动作流畅，射击时子弹夹杂着烟尘，在抖动的枪口中喷薄而出，伴随着激荡的音乐，敌方机甲一个个倒下爆炸时的感觉简直不能再赞。
2.各种爆炸效果的使用。游戏物理模拟比较真实，不同威力的武器打在同样物体上，效果绝无雷同。
3.各种场景描绘的细致生动，而且百分百可破坏。看着各种建筑碎片横飞，烟雾弥漫的倒下成为废墟蛮爽快，喜欢拆迁的可以大展身手了（笑）
4.游戏中的不同机甲效果多样，配合副武器系统（EMP，烟雾弹，隐形迷彩），后期横扫一切可以体会到唯我独尊的感觉
—————————————————————————
至于缺点也有一些：
1.中文机翻，虽然大概能看出啥意思来。（标题捣乱者什么鬼23333）再有就是地图如果再多些就好了。
2.系统还是比较单薄，机甲不能定制有点伤，作为一辆机甲，武器没有导弹类和激光类有点不合格（笑）
—————————————————————————
特别提示：要特别注意地图上的爆炸物！！！！这玩意威力大不管炸到谁都有奇效（笑）

       虽有古文云“乃知兵者是凶器，圣人不得已而用之。”，但其实，很多男生心中都或多或少埋藏着一颗叛逆的种子，当这颗种子接触到一种名为新鲜感的养分后，便会花开遍野。犹记得，在《GTA》横空出世时，这些充满诱惑力的叛逆可能给世人展现出其妖艳到极致的游戏性，更是让很多玩家感受到了不为规则所束缚的快感。这种快感是一种天性使然。几乎每一个男孩子，都有过一段喜欢打打杀杀搞破坏的日子，进入了规则引领的秩序世界后，我们把这种爱好埋藏进内心深处，直到第九艺术给我们机会以极低的代价体验一个个鲜活而又一定程度上可被破坏的世界之时，很多人终于能填上心中缺失的那一个窟窿。

       《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》也是这样的一个填窟作品。在这款游戏中，我们将扮演一个个个性诡异的机甲战士，踏上故土极尽破坏之能事。最初，《Brigador》场景破坏的核心设计意图是为了弥补一款著名战争游戏的破坏活动的不足。《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》的主创人员Hugh Monahan曾经说过，他虽然很喜欢《战地：叛逆连队2》，但是其关键道具被固定地放置了，加之很多场景无法充分破坏，因此玩家的自由度受到了限制，因此他希望在《Brigador》中做出他希望的更丰满的那种破坏层次。

       尝试更丰满的破坏层次，也许就意味着做一些别的开发者没做过的事。正如《黑道圣徒》的开发团队Volitions曾赋予《红色派系：游击战》的那种极具真实感的物理引擎那样，《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》的开发者Stellar Jockeys也将面临这样的挑战。区别是，Volitions是一个技术实力强劲的成熟开发团队，其在THQ破产之后，仍以22.3亿美元的价值卖身成功，而Stellar Jockeys则只是一个一开始仅由三人组成的制作团队，资金来源存疑。在这种情况下，Stellar Jockeys仍然毅然决然地决定开发一套游戏引擎来制作《Brigador》，这不得不令人心起尊敬。

       21世纪的游戏市场，虽然涌入了诸多独立游戏，但更多决定其销量的仍是市场推广与游戏本身的硬实力。看过《独立游戏大电影》的人都知道，哪怕如《FEZ》那样素质如此过硬的独立游戏，其开发团队仍然面临着生理和心理的双重巨大压力。而更多的独立游戏开发者，包括Stellar Jockeys，将长期面临着投入与产出的严重不均衡。事实上，投入了5年研发时间的《Brigador》正是那一颗投入这一片红海市场中的一颗常见的小石子，虽以90%以上的好评率掀起了一些涟漪，但也终究沉入了大海。直到Humble的2017年月包将其捆绑给订阅玩家之前，《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》一直都在叫好不叫座的尴尬境地之中徘徊。

       忽略掉这些外部因素和Stellar Jockeys在市场营销上的失败决策，让我们平心气和地探究一下《Brigador》的游戏本身到底出了什么差错。初次体验过《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》之后，我深深感受到这款游戏的用心之处，多样化的机甲和武器搭配，几乎完全可破坏的场景，出色的战斗光影效果等种种深度要素似乎阐述了其为何能获得94%好评的原因。但尽管《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》在游戏的机甲武器等内容上做了非常多的内容填充，却在玩法上设计的非常单薄——任务几乎只有破坏和杀敌，没有解谜，剧情薄弱而不连贯，rpg元素的缺失，联机要素的缺乏……这就使得很多玩家在给这款游戏打上好评之后，还是依然向他们的好友推荐诸如《Rim world》、《看火人》、《星露谷物语》、《盐和避难所》、《缺氧》等等更具话题性或互动性的游戏作品。毕竟2016年的优秀独立游戏如此之多，这一片名为独立游戏的战场，早就已经成为了一片名副其实的尸横遍野的红海市场。

       仅就其展现出的游戏内容来看，虽然《Brigador: Up-Armored Edition》衍生出的变化不多，但其表现却也对得起其好评如潮的评价。也许是限于现实生活的压力和研发决策失误，这款作品并没有在那些易于产生话题性的元素上做进一步拓展，也是令人可惜之处了。",1531748403,1531748403,True,9,1,0.227486968040466309,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Brigador's isometric mech combat is satisfying and more than adequately varied. Similarly, the environments are exquisitely detailed and varied. Neither the combat mechanics nor the environments ever feel stale throughout the campaign. 

What holds this game back is the low difficulty level of the campaign. The game has a great engine, but the campaign missions can be thoughtlessly steamrolled by any reasonably competent player. It rarely feels like it is necessary to use tactical subtlety and problem solving over brute force. This means the game's mechanics are not fully expressed, leaving the game feeling flatter than it could have been. While the game does have a longer form 'freelance' mode that bears some similarity to roguelikes, if you are like myself, you enjoy a more curated experience. Thus, I am forced to file Brigador away into the ""could have been a lot better"" category.

Some people have also commented on the highly interesting world building that seems inadequately explored due to the way the story is told. I agree, but I think this is more a matter of writing quality than of delivery method. I noticed numerous spelling errors, grammatical artifacts, and tangled wording that left me having to re-read passages numerous times. Additionally, the sequence of lore that is titrated to you over the campaign often feels disordered. However, some of the writing is decent, which leads me to believe that they didn't have a competent editor on hand to help achieve consistency.

This problem of great engine building with sloppy design seems to be endemic among smaller developers. I hope the devs will not make these mistakes in their next game. 

Criticisms aside, I would like to close by complimenting the game on its theme. 

The world of Brigador is cold and brutal, being driven by the self interest of the four factions. Although Solo Nobre is a place of high technology, it feels like wilderness of metal. All of the factions are reprehensible by our standards. Their conflict is akin to predators fighting over territory and resources with the total amorality that follows one animal sustaining its life at the cost of another. 

We live in a time of relative stability. Arguably, this stability is enabled not by the exceptional goodness of modern man, but by novel power dynamics which render predatorial conflicts too costly. We often forget the animalistic forces which drove the conflcts of the past, and which pulse throughout the undercurrents of our world in the form of geopolitical standoffs and corporate machinations. Brigador has explored what a world of intelligent animals looks like when armed conflict is highly profitable. I have not seen this theme expressed in such a distilled manner, and for that reason, I feel that Brigador has accomplished something truly interesting.",1531618263,1533005774,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can completely tailor to your playstyle. Every mech and vehicle plays differently, and when you begin freelance mode and customize them all with weapons and pilots, you can tailor difficulty, create your own unique challenges. I've never played anything quite like this.

You can take a casual approach to the game and play the stronger mechs with more firepower or you can go with the tiny guys with pea shooters and get extra rewards for taking on the extra challenge.

The trouble with addressing those concerns means that we've generally gotten fewer refunds, we have the opposite problem: any players that don't need that long of a ramp-up get bored.

If you still own the game, we recommend a few key enhancements: make sure the game is played at 100% speed (not the default 80%, which is tweaked for controllers and also easier difficulty overall) and use relative (tank) controls with m+kb, and go straight into Freelance mode, rather than work your way through the campaign first, which has a long introductory portion, only becoming challenging much later (if ever, for some).

They tagged it as an 'isometric intense tactical combat game' and it is very much that.

Your goal: kick the ass of various military factions & escape from Solo Nobre. Ha! That should ring a bell for the likes of 'Escape from New York' or 'Escape from Los Angeles' by John Carpenter. Call me 'Snake in a Tank'!

Some tips that will help you early on:

[h1]Campaign vs Freelance[/h1]
Brigador has two main game modes. Campaign and Freelance. Campaign teaches you the game, starts with tutorial missions that will help you through the basics, but then towards the middle and especially at the end missions you will be tested. I recommend that newcomers do the Campaign first. Freelance is a bit more complex... it's a sort of sandbox mode that is likely aimed towards advanced pilots. In the Campaign you can choose only from a few vehicles that will come with predefined weapons and abilities usually fitting the sort of mission that you need to accomplish. In Freelance you can bring whatever vehicle and weapons you want as long as you have it unlocked. Doing the Campaign will earn you tons of money, so then you can go Freelance with kickass weapons. Neat!

[h1]Tactics & Resources[/h1]
This game as mentioned above is a tactical game! If you try to just walk in and engage the enemy forces head on... you will almost certainly lose every time. For a single vehicle to defeat hundreds... you will need to choose your battles, refill your shields, manage your ammo and prioritize targets the correct way. Each vehicle will come with a special ability like Cloaking, Smoke Screen, EMP or a devastating Shockwave. These specials have unlimited charges except for their cooldown and their correct utilization is key to success. Lure in enemies, flank, use melee to conserve ammo, pick up all ammo and shield drops. You will get the hang of this, no worries!

[h1]Friendly Fire / Self Fire?[/h1]
Your weapons (and your vehicles themselves) are super deadly, so you will need to learn not to kill yourself. This is one of the main challenges, and actually surprisingly tricky at first. When your massive gun blows up like a 100 meter radius crater per round, it is not smart to fire at point blank. Easier said, then done when you are in intense combat, firing and navigating the environment at high velocity. Give it time, and experiment with the various weapons.

[h1]Explosive Buildings[/h1]
Fuel stations, orbital guns and fuel lines explode when rammed (sometimes a simple contact will trigger) or if fired into. These can change the tide of combat favorably or end your life in an instant. Always scan your surrounding for such explosives and take it into account before you engage. Do NOT go near them or you will learn the hard way. The tutorial missions will showcase this to you, but you truly need to pay attention.

[h1]Suicide Enemies - Red Beam[/h1]
Another deadly threat are the suicide enemies. They will ram you and explode for massive damage, unless you identify them by their glowing red beam and take them out first. Once they are somewhat close, they should be your number one priority target.

[h1]Facing and Rear Damage[/h1]
Never turn your back to the enemy! Sounds simple, but cannot be emphasised enough. The body of your vehicle can face a different dirrection then your turret. You control the turret with the mouse, and the vehicle's body with the keyboard. Your vehicle facing is indicated via a small yellow arrow and it should always look towards the enemy when you expect to be hit. Your rear armor is weak and will result in major damage if not instant death if a strong weapon hits you there.

[h1]Spotter Enemies - Blue Eye[/h1]
These enemies will raise the alarm, and bring tons of reinforcements and all kinds of nastiness on you. Take them out before the time runs out!

[h1]Strong Starter Mech for Freelance[/h1]
You can buy 50+ vehicles and they are all quite cool and powerful, but which one to get first?
I advise you to get the [b]Aetós[/b] which is a Spacer Mech that can carry the heaviest weapons in the game, has extremely powerful melee and full 360° turret movement. I use mine with [b]'König'[/b] Primary (massive gatling gun) and [b]'Ploughman'[/b] Secondary (large area bio-weapon). Another combo that works well is [b]'König'[/b] and [b]'Chieftain'[/b]. From specials, I recommend the [b]Cloaking[/b] technology, as it's very versatile and easy to use.

[h1]Pilots in Freelance[/h1]
This is a tricky thing as well. Pilots in Freelance mode have to be unlocked and will determine critical factors such as difficulty and money earned. Choose your pilot with care and review the values, so you know what you are singing up for.

The gameplay is chaotic and intense. The flow of Brigador’s gameplay feels similar to the Desert and Nuclear Strike games, Crusader: No Remorse and even some ARPGs.

The isometric graphics & lighting are colorful and interesting. The soundtrack is gripping synthwave.

The developers are active and friendly on social media and the Steam forums.

My favorite parts of Brigador are the art direction and the lore. The mechs, tanks, and hovercraft are strange, beautiful war machines on the grungy sci-fi planet. I have probably spent just as much time reading the colorful in-game lore about the vehicles, weapons, and pilots as I have blasting through missions.

The universe and writing are great (the fiction e-book is a fun read too) and the developers have mentioned they are at work on a new game in the same universe. My hope is that they use the same beautiful engine and create a turn-based, squad-level strategy game with a story-driven campaign.

The campaign has over 25 missions which are generally fairly short but feature 3-4 different loadouts for each one and the playstyle is very different depending on which one you choose. Beating the campaign with all 4 loadouts on every mission has taken me around 20 hours. 

In tandem is the freelance mode which allows you to select which mission or sequence of maps to play. This is where you get to customize basically every aspect of the game, ranging from your vehicle, your 2 weapons, special ability and your pilot. The amount of enemies and their difficulty is based on which pilot you choose. There is also a randomize button and the possibility to change just 1 of the variables if you are satisfied with your loadout before starting your run. This is where the rogue-lite side of the game takes place. 

The controls are very customizable, you can also use a slider to determine the speed of the game. I recommend setting it to 100% unless you use a controller. 

The gameplay is deeper than it might seem at first glance with a few different systems going on, I recommend reading a few guides on steam. 

The story is presented more in a ""world-building"" way and the game is filled with great writing. The story and background to this interesting universe is mostly through the vehicle, weapon and mission descriptions.  I think it's worth taking the time to read it all as it really fleshes out the game world and the story isn't really presented upfront. 

Most of the big reviewers reviewed this game when it first launched in 2015 and were giving it favorable scores. The game has since then improved a lot from what I'm seeing, withmajor patches still happening as of june 2018. 

I personally picked up the deluxe edition which includes over 40 tracks in total and an audiobook (haven't listened to the book yet though) and I think the soundtrack alone is easily worth the extra $5.

Overall I really recommend this game, I can see myself playing for many more hours.

I, like all of the other people I've talked to about it, had no idea how I hadn't heard of it before. Even after putting it on my wishlist, it skipped my mind repeatedly until it came up in this year's Summer Sale. And now that I have it, I am honestly regretful that I didn't pay full price for it, as it is unquestionably worth it. It's as deep as you want it to be — you can decide so much of your experience, from mission length in freelance mode, to the type and weaponry of your playable mech. 'Mech' being a catchall term here: There are several visibly and mechanically distinct forms of playable war machine, each individual unit carrying its own unique combination of the game's weapon systems. You can choose to breeze through a two-zone mission with a badass god-machine that crushes through structures and enemies alike, or put yourself in a light mech to run-and-gun your way through an entire mini-campaign.

And of course you'll be rewarded accordingly. Something this game does extremely well (at least in my experience) is keep you teetering on the edge of your comfort zone. Sure, you can do that mission you've gotten down pat with the pilot you like and a mech you know can handle it, but the payout would be so much [i]better[/i] if you brought that little fast powersuit that can only mount two small weapons... Stuff like that. It's very rewarding to lean toward the outer edge of your ability. Sure, there's a risk of you dying and losing the reward entirely, but if you manage to pull through, it is more than worth that chance. Money buys everything from new mechs and weapons, to pilots themselves, and even bits of lore and intelligence on in-game factions and elements.

Speaking of the lore, the setting is beautifully hazy and believable. Residing somewhere on the quasi-cyberpunk spectrum, with a grim devaluation of individual lives, and set after the normalization of space travel. It's well thought out, with elements that made me laugh and others that made me grimace from the too-real aspect of it. The backdrop and scenery as you stomp around and blow shit up slowly comes to make more and more sense as you play, even if you don't go out of your way to read the lore entries or do the campaign missions. Despite the characters being little more than portraits and stat sheets for your mech, they have their own summary articles that give them depth, and I would almost guarantee you'll quickly find one that you like for reasons other than just their completion bonuses.

I've run a bit longer than I intended here, but I really do want to drive home that this game deserves much more attention and praise than it's gotten. I've only started scratching the surface of it, but I can tell it's going to be a mainstay in my library for quite a while.",1529985373,1529985373,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False,False,,,

前略，致天国的钢铁咆哮：
虽然这游戏是开机甲，但总体来说，游戏的整体套路明显更接近钢铁咆哮而不是mechwarrior，防2D的斜45度手绘画面，机甲武器自由拼装，驾驶员自由更换（虽然只影响难度），打起来画面乒乒乓乓非常热闹，这些都会让人有玩钢铁咆哮的错觉……

能做到这种程度就足以说明这游戏是个还不错的小游戏了，熟悉套路之后打起来会很顺畅，而且套路武器有很多种，可以刚可以苟，不想手抽筋可以整个肥宅机甲，想拿高分可以上小麻雀，成就感还是挺好。

但是说到底这也就是个4399，没有僚机，武器只能带两把，武器和机体虽然有很多选择但总体来说数量仍显不足，而且……别看他介绍是ROGUELIKE啊，地图都是固定的！只是出生点和敌人配置会有变化，而且后期为了打高分需要连肝很多场，万一中途一下手残直接几个小时白干，当然如果觉得自由模式太累专心研究剧情固定配置过关倒是也可以，但是这样内容就显得更不足了……

Brigador: Up-Armored Edition è un grido di gloria nefasto e distruttivo in onore di tutti quei giochi di stampo retrò che tentano, ricalcando vecchie glorie, di farsi valere ancora oggi nel mercato dei videogamers.

Nei panni di un mercenario alla guida di uno dei 56 robottoni, carri armati, furgoni, astronavi ed assudità varie disponibili, non importa quale sia il vostro obiettivo.. l'importante è raggiungerlo e percorrere la strada fino ad esso nel modo più distruttivo possibile! Questo è lo scopo.. questo è il fine.. questo è il senso! 
Uno sparatutto isometrico, che vi regalerà qualche ora di spensierato svago.. a me sinceramente rilassa molto distruggere le cose e bhe, Brigador: Up-Armored Edition, ha mappe dettagliatissime e totalmente distruttibili in ogni singolo pixel! 
Insomma, che male c'è ad avere ogni tanto qualche delirio di onnipotenza e seminare distruzione e panico??

State attenti però.. Brigador: Up-Armored Edition, secondo me, come detto precedentemente, [b]NON E' UN GIOCO[/b] ma un semplice [b]PASSATEMPO[/b]. Una spensierata postilla quando magari sono le 20:00, avete un appuntamento alle 20:30 e siete già pronti  ma, la vostra consorte vi dice che ancora deve truccarsi e quindi vi posticipa minimo di mezz'ora.. Oppure, quando siete totalmente scazzati che vi fa schifo alzarvi anche per andare a pisciare! Che si fa in questi casi??

 [h1]>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> BRIGATOR: UP-ARMORED EDITION!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<[/h1]

SI, ha una trama (banale e del tutto secondaria) ma, fondamentalmente non la cagherete di striscio. Quello che conta è la distruzione totale.. distruzione che dopo un paio di ore vi avrà già annoiato perchè, parliamoci chiaramente.. è uno sparatutto isometrico vecchio stampo. Siamo nel 2018 e c'è sicuramente di mooooolto meglio praticamente allo stesso prezzo. Cazz 19,99 euro, è come se vi proponessero se foste favorevoli a subire una rapina a mano armata seguita da stupro! 
Cioè dai.. vi scrivo questa recensione mentre su Steam, in questo preciso momento, offrono a 14 euro The Witcher 3. Dunque, a buon intenditore.....

Concludendo,  Brigador: Up-Armored Edition è un titolo carino, spensierato, divertente che consiglio perchè ,nel suo genere, è realizzato molto bene ma da comprare solo quando non superà le 3 euro SE SIETE PROPRIO FAN degli sparatutto isometrici vecchio stampo o cercate semplicemente un modo carino di coprire qualche vostro ""buco"" nella routine giornaliera.

[b]PRO:[/b]
- adrenalinico sparatutto isometrico SBOOOMMM!!!! RATATATATATAT!!! PFIUUUUUUUU!!! ZAAAAAAAAAEEEON! (onomatopee assortite di missili, esplosioni, laser ecc ecc)
- mappe dettagliatissime e totalmente distruttibili
- gira anche su una caffettiera
- validissimo e spensierato passatempo che svolge egregiamente il suo scopo di intrattenervi..

- ...quando non c'avete un c...o da fare!
- alla lunga annoia..
- destinato principalmente ad una specifica fetta di videogiocatori.
- controllare certi mezzi è così macchinoso che vi potrebbe far venire l'ulcera perforante.
- non c'è l'ITALIANO tra le lingue disponibili ma non so se, in questa tipologia di giochi, sia un vero e proprio difetto.

Brigador is a bizarre beast. If you watch some gameplay footage, you'll see it's a game about someone in some sort of armored vehicle, speeding around, and leaving in a trail of destruction.

You can't really miss that much. But the game is a damn iceberg and that stuff is the tip.

I didn't expect depth from a game like this. Or a surprising amount of nostalgia too. This game plays as much like the Desert Strike series on the Megadrive/Genesis and SNES (mercifully without any fuel demands) as it does any twitchy twin stick shooter - and that isn't so obvious from the gameplay footage.

For one level, the game Brigador most felt like to me was Hitman: Codename 47 (the very first game, before the series truly found its feet). I'd clear targets, little chance of surviving a straight up fight, not even speed to just hit-and-run them all, and needed to think of the level as a puzzle and a search for a path of least resistance. When I finished that level (with the ridiculous amount of flowers) I felt a kind of satisfaction I hadn't since the day I texted 'LEE HONG IS DEAD' to a friend with no other context. We both knew exactly what that meant. We'd both been there.

The setting for this game has executed lore in a way that puts RPGs to shame. There's a monopoly on that information. Held by people of ill repute. You pay significant costs for it, up front. No refunds. That money you're paying feels HARD earned. There are no freebies or audiologs falling out of the pockets of your foes here. Not one voice acted pilot will verbally barf exposition or their life story at you. These people are the same ones that throw on contrived fees for every failed mission so on death you get a pittance. 

You grow to hate them. You should.
Oh. And these are your business partners and your only way out of escaping a planet ran by a dictator. These are as close as you'll get to people who aren't your fellow idiomatic crabs in the barrel.

You're in this position because you're in no position to bargain. EVERYTHING you earn feels you got gipped (massive transaction fees hinting at corruption, or a budget for Brigador payments that reflected you beat the odds and survived when they calculated you were as good as dead the minute you accepted the contract). It feels like a one player version of shady EVE intrigue. There's an angle being worked by big players. You're just a detail here. A replaceable part. And both everything you learn and everything you do to learn more about it reinforces you're not a big deal here. There's some astronomical gap in power here between a player and the powers that be in this game. The kind of gap that normally only appears in horror like Lovecraft's or a setting like Shadowrun where no matter how big you are, you're no match for the smallest of dragons.

You get told what you need to (if even that much...) and then lead on your way to blow it up. Don't expect pluck, or tones of anime shonen heroism in mechas. There are no genki girls and any 'I believe in you' best friends are filling the collosal numbers of graves that appear in some levels. The level design in what is shown in abundance and what is shown barely both hint of a planet that is closer to warhammer 40,000. Not all the way grimdark, but even the vice and black market seem like they were being rationed out by Great Leader.

Until mission 1 began the's signs there was barely law here. Before mission 1 ends you feel what a Brigador must feel. You started pumped up, over-equipped and under informed.  Then confusion over the importance of what to do and what to absolutely not to do. Then frustration. Then a decision. Then you realise you're not going to be proud of what you're doing today. Then you do it. Then you get paid far too little and feel a mix of self loathing and ripped off. And that feeling of being ripped off makes it clear - now there is no law here.

This all happens with no cut scenes and less than 12 words of dialog. You're also given a choice that isn't immediately obvious. Looking at the statistics a lot of people either don't ever realise it is there or act in a way that makes the planet wide space dystopia that much more believable (look at rate of globally unlocked achievements closely). It's the best kind of morality system - mechanically none at all, and only the painful hindsight that many people could have been a better person. But they didn't. And here we all are now.

So yeah, it's clear I like the feel and the setting. Now, is there enough GAME to be worth the money?

Oh yeah. A ridiculous looking Scrapheap Challenge weldjob on meth (called a Treehouse) firing gas canisters like artillery, that melt anyone or thing like they're xenomorph blood has to be seen to be believed.

A nippy little high speed atrocity platform that feels like it was used by the Cylons with about as much regard for human life, that (on middle click) can make whatever is in front of it die in a war crime every is something that takes LOTS of practice to get the hang of. Especially when you're firing it every 7 seconds.

A Mantis with a twin pair of Belters feels like a scaled up ED209 with less subtly (somehow). And you're in it a planet with no stairs you can't flatten, no Robocop you can't stomp, no executives alive to react to Mr. Kinney's glitch induced high caliber acupuncture.

Killdozer? Killdozer.

Whatever you pick, it's not just about thoroughly doing the job. It's about getting to the shuttle alive to collect payment in full. And everything on the way feeling like it is trying to kill you. Even if some of those people are fleeing for their lives. And your mind is not on where you step anymore.

Soundtrack: One of my all time favs. One more reason I love this game. Check out Makeup & Vanity Set on Bandcamp to listen to it.

TL;DR: Good Game, lots to do.

+Gameplay allows for taking the objective from any angle you see fit: Tanky power trip, Hit and Run Weasle, Sneaky Snake in the grass, and Troublemaking Tactician. Run it your way.
+Fantastic Sythwave Soundtrack!
+Loads of vehicles, weapons, abilities, and pilots; each plays different with each mixup of any.
+Damn good Isometric graphics, if Factorio or Original Starcraft was your jam, you're in for a treat.
+Very in-depth customizeable controls, allows for lots of rebinding, and mechanical switchups.
+Controls pretty well with keyboard and mouse, feels nice and tight for the most part, a little floaty in tanks and mechs, but it honestly just adds to the experience.
+Freelance mode!: Allows you to aquire and customize your own build and pit it agianst the AI in the various (purchaseable with in-game currency)scenarios, vehicles, weapons, pilots, and abilities; Good way to find the playstyle that suits you best.
+The Lore.: It's extremely deep, you can get a real feel for the really dark and gritty sci-fi industiralized setting through a lot of just the item/character descriptions alone. each character has their own ambitions, problems, in couple of cases some serious ambiguity, and some of them are just outright obscure references.
+Horns.

~Tactical and slow combat in regards to campaign, sometimes they'll give you a behemoth pile of armor to work with but for the most part, if you're not careful and tactful with how you run the mission, you'll be up shit creek without a paddle, and the time you spent getting that progress will be for nothing. Not everyone's thing but I surely enjoyed planning out what to do and executing it.

-Not much in the ways of display options, but it's really not that much of a qualm.
-Poor Controller Binds, very slow response and is definitely going to be a pain in the ass if you decide to roll with it; that being said, the devs do recommend that you slow the game speed down if you do, which makes the pacing rather drab quickly.

I was gifted this game from a friend and I have to stay that I haven't had fun from a game like this for a long while now. The intense fast paced combat is very challenging, but not challenging just to pi*ss you off. If you end up getting killed on a level, high chances are it is because you made a mistake and got cocky/arrogant and ended up getting squashed. You really have to plan/strategize in order to suceed. When you succeed you really do have that feeling you have accomplished something.

Brigador kind of has a story/campaign but not in the traditional sense. The campaign portion of the game consists of a series of levels that you complete with different pilots and earn cash and you unlock more stiff as you go along. What Brigador does have is a ton of highly detailed and well thought out background lore. I mean a lot of it. If you take the time to unlock all the lore goodies you can see they put a lot of creativity and time into it and it is very enjoyable to read.

The real bread and butter of the game is the freelance portion. As you play operations and earn that cash, you can unlock more pilots that have increased difficulty but also offer higher rewards if you complete the operation.  All the pilots have unique stories and you can get some enjoyment out of reading them. You can also unlock more operations that increase in difficulty, as well as unlocking different weapons, mechs, tanks, agravs, etc. It is really fun to play around with various weapon types, special abilities, and pilots you want to try out on a level and see how you fair.

I am really having a lot of fun with this game and even the achievements are a fun challenge to try. My only real critique is that I wish that they would have had a more fleshed out story mode since they have so much lore that you can create a very fun and unique campaign mode. The combat is obviously the game's strong point and it kicks a*ss, but I do hope in the future whether in a patch or in the next game (Brigador 2?) they also offer some other types of game modes and maybe even a two person coop would be fantastic.

I highly recommend picking this game up if you are into games such as this and want to support these developers. Especially if it goes on sale, pick the game up and have at it!

EDIT#1: Oh man how could I have forgotten. The game also has a KILLER  soundtrack!

EDIT#2: They dropped another nice update to the game and made it even better, great developers.

It took a little getting used to the game's dry, formless presentation, but my opinion hasn't changed - and I love both of those games.

Brigador tosses the player into the controls of a walker, tank, or hovertank and gives them a very simple goal; kill [i]everything[/i]. There is no failure state in the game short of death. There is nothing in the game that is indestructible short of level boundaries. There is no penalty for leaving every building on the map as a smoking pile of steamrolled rubble - Hell, that's what you're being paid to do.

Brigador's selling point is its dedication to giving the player freedom to fight however they please. Take a heavy tank for a spin, load it out with a 90mm shotgun, and run over everyone stupid enough to stand in front of you. Grab a hovertank with double chainguns and hose down the whole map in a fight that never ends. Get freaky, pick up a walker with a radiation gun, EMP rockets, and active camo - win or lose, the game'll pat you on the back for trying.

It's hard to put it into perspective just how good a job Brigador does at setting up its gameplay. Even after you've settled on a loadout, the freedom doesn't end. The game oozes with simple strategy and straightforward stealth. Want to get things done quick and easy? Knock out the orbital defense guns and run for the exit. Want to go for the full measure? The game'll pay you more for it. Want to keep things quiet? Bring quiet guns, knock out the comms tower, and check your sightlines before you move.

Pile all this on top of the game's dynamic, destructible environments and you've got one of the most open-ended shooters out there. Add in Brigador's fast, frantic gameplay and hard tactical edge, you've got one of the most exciting challenges in the genre. Tamp it all down with Brigador's focus on keeping things simple and intuitive and you've got a game that's easy to get into.

Brigador's visuals are a bit of an odd topic. On the one hand, there's no denying it's got the look of a very old game shored up with modern trimmings. On the other hand, its visuals are dripping with style, quality, and consistency. Sounds and audio are limited mostly to gunfire and engine noise, but they're all pleasing to the ear. The music in the game is absolutely incredible - that the game doesn't have a proper dynamic music system just kills me inside. The soundtrack was worth every penny.

The story in Brigador suffers a bit from its sandbox disposition. The campaign isn't much of a plot; you're thrown into random missions with a bit of story text and not much more. There's no voice acting, no cinematics, little much plot involvement in mission objectives, and zero scripted encounters. Whether this is all for better or worse is down to the end user. That said, the writing in the game is masterful. It's flooded with lore and flavor text that all complement Brigador's atmosphere perfectly.

I've not once had a bug in Brigador. At times, the flawless stability has almost been a bit disappointing - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1112125453]take a look at my screenshot library and you'll see why.[/url] The game runs well, loads quick, shuts down on a dime, and has never once crashed on me. Modding, on the other hand, is close to non-existent. At most, you can fiddle with a debug menu to do basic tweaks, but advanced modding and mapping are out of the picture.

[quote][b]Edit[/b] [i](6/21/2018)[/i][b]:[/b]
It's not often that I have to update a review for something good. The previous paragraph is now half incorrect; modding and mapping were introduced in a recent update. With them came a lighting overhaul, new pilots, new vehicles, and a string of campaign maps ported to the game's freelance mode. All things considered, it's now very hard for me to find a single flaw with this game that's even worth mentioning.[/quote]


In all, I'm very happy with Brigador. It came out of the blue as a gift from a friend and wound up as my favorite of the following months. It's given me a lot of personal inspiration and a lot of fun. It's tickled my nostalgia bone with its classic isometric perspective. It's simple, open, and does what it does very well.

A história que me fez descobrir este jogo é curiosa... quem me conhece sabe que desde sempre fui fascinado por este subgênero de ficção científica repleto de seres marginalizados e bizarrices cibernéticas, o Cyberpunk. Frequentando os fóruns de um RPG de mesa dos anos 80 chamado Cyberpunk 2020 foi onde tive a ideia de criar uma playlist de músicas dos gêneros Synthwave, Retrowave e qualquer outra porcaria que se remetia a este subgênero, foi em uma recomendação vazia de cowboy encontrei uma música chamada [url=https://open.spotify.com/track/1XKkdhQ4vIp22c4ScOHZW9]Solo Nobre Must Fall[/url], música tema deste maravilhoso jogo. Enfim, escutei tanto a música que tive curiosidade pesquisar sobre sua origem, ainda bem que fiz isso, ainda bem...

Logo após completar o primeiro cenário o jogo lhe apresenta ao enredo... 

''Há muitos anos, o grupo paramilitar NEP (Novo Exército do Povo) tomou o poder de Solo Nobre, a capital de Novo Solo. As negociações de paz com o líder do NEP, o tirano conhecido como Grande Líder, falharam. Depois que o Grande Líder fechou os espaçoportos, os cidadãos de Solo Nobre foram forçados a aguentar anos de políticas econômicas regressivas e isolacionismo.''

O enredo que é mostrado ao longo dos cenários é, digamos, ''modesto'' e provavelmente não vai te cativar, bom, pelo menos comigo foi assim. Em jogos com temática cyberpunk eu sempre busco enredos profundos, mais complexos e ricos em detalhes, mas nem sempre é o caso.

Existem vários cenários para se jogar, cenários que equivalem a uma campanha, entretanto, a maioria desses cenários são muito simples de se completar e não exigem habilidade do jogador, eles funcionam como um grande tutorial que servem para introduzir o jogador as mecânicas dos mechs e do jogo em geral. O jogo brilha mesmo é no modo ''mercenário'', lá nós podemos comprar missões, mechs e pilotos com a grana que juntamos ao jogar a campanha, os cenários e as missões.

A jogabilidade é padrão [url=https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Twin+Stick+Shooter]Twin Stick Shooter[/url] / [url=https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Top-Down%20Shooter/]Top-Down Shooter[/url] e lembra bastante alguns jogos como SYNTHETIK e Nex Machina, mas um pouco menos  Rogue-lite. Geralmente esses jogos funcionam melhor com um controle ou joystick, mas neste game eu diria que minha experiência com o teclado e mouse foi mais do que satisfatória, então não se preocupe caso não tenha um controle à disposição.

Ultimamente ando me interessando bastante por estes gêneros de jogos, principalmente pelo algo nível de dificuldade que eles geralmente apresentam... Aqui a dificuldade é um fator relativo, pois ela é determinada de acordo com suas escolhas para cada missão, o piloto, o mech, as armas, etc. 

Os visuais e gráficos não são nada que além do convencional, mas a maioria das artes do jogo são muito bem feitas e acabam se destacando... imagine as [url=https://www.artstation.com/artwork/brxvo]ilustrações de Josan Gonzalez[/url], mas sem aquele estilo pitoresco da paleta de cores que ele costuma usar.

Como eu disse no início da análise, conheci o game a partir de sua maravilhosa trilha sonora, então não poderia deixar de mencioná-la. Pra mim é o ponto mais positivo do jogo e foi o que realmente me fez continuar a jogar, ela combina muito com os visuais e com o tema geral do jogo, com o tempo esses jogos mostraram que destruir quase tudo no seu caminho ao som de uma boa música pode ser extremamente divertido.

O preço original de Brigador era uma piada, R$55,99 se não me engano, e os R$36,99 cobrados hoje em dia ainda são um valor um pouco alto para o que é oferecido, mas tudo depende do jogador. Na minha opinião um valor justo seria algo em torno de 20-25 reais.

Durante as horas que passei em Novo Solo não presenciei nenhum problema técnico no game, houve apenas uma situação em que o jogo ''crashou'' (fechou sozinho), mas foi só isso, um único crash. Brigador também possui suporte completo para monitores ultrawide (21:9) e conta com tradução completa para Português do Brasil, a tradução é boa, só encontrei alguns errinhos e infelizmente algumas coisas que não foram traduzidas, como por exemplo o nome das missões.

[b]Conclusão:[/b] Brigador: Up-Armored Edition infelizmente é um jogo para poucos e pode até mesmo não agradar fãs mais ''hardcore'' (assíduos) de Top-Down Shooters, mas pra mim foi uma experiência bastante satisfatória e sinceramente não vejo motivos para não recomendá-lo. Entretanto, é importante levar em consideração o preço a se pagar pelo que ele é capaz de te entregar.

The atmosphere has a juxtaposition of steam-punk, sci-fi neon lights and it felt like classic red alert 2 in live action. 

However, very bad design mechanics forbid from enjoying such a nice graphic design. 

Text based narratives do not work anymore in 21st century. This is just my personal preference, so you can ignore it, but because the presentation of its narrative is not so appealing that I don't even bother to understand any context of the story if there is one at all. Look at what happened to JRPGs.

Limitation of choosing character / vehicles. 
Just Why? 
Why don't I get a freedom of choosing my own vehicle for any mission at all?
Having a specific vehicle should have been for a challenge or some extra mission not for a normal cmapaign progress. 

Sure you get to try new vehicles, but you don't get to know their functions and stats because they are all written in a very bad manner style in the description box. Only the health, shield and number / type of rounds the vehicle have. We would not know what kind of weapon each vehicle has at all until you try and figure out certain vehicle is not suitable. 
There was even one description of a vehicle saying it has a bad formula of weapons or something like that. Again. 
Why? Why would any one use a badly designed vehicle in the first place? I am no English teacher, but I gotta say the writings are pretty bad.

It should have its own customization. There seems to be some kind of market system with the money you earn from each mission, but most are restricted for whatever reason and I couldn't figure out how it works. There seemed to be unnecessarily amount of tutorial on how to use few different types of vehicle, but why not how the market works?
It has such a great potential of having a warehouse to build your own unit / vehicle, buying new weapons / kits to try them in a new combinations and / or upgrade your gears etc. 
Instead, you get a series of different vehicles with very uninspiring characters with another limitation of 2~4 choices from every single missions. 

UI design. 
The obstacles are too dark that sometimes when you think you have enough space to move around while in combat, you end up stuck in a corner, because you haven't 'completely' destroyed the obstacles. 
The color variation of objective markers are too similar to the whole map that you often have to look closely to see where the markers are at. They should have some glowing marker or should have used some opposite color to these whole dark-neon themed environment. 

Aim system.
I tend to use flying vehicles often, but it will get very frustrating when it comes to fast moving enemies who tend to shove their face against yours. Once enemies are literally in front of you, good luck aiming at them. 
The aim system here is just terrible. you have to have a mouse cursor over ground or small units or else you may shoot over them. It tends not to work well when they are very close to you. You better have some AOE weapons to clear out close quarter combat situations. 

It has a potential, but expecting to choose my own character - anticipated to have their own set of skills or different stats - and to create my own vehicle seemed to be too much of expectation.",1524614263,1524614743,False,6,0,0.353712528944015503,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Art is beautiful, with the flashing of lasers and explosions at night
Lots of vehicles
Lots of weapons

Shooting gameplay is fun

The Bad:
All vehicles handle somewhat strangely, with how holding down a key does not mean your 'front' is always facing  the way you're walking. This can be used tactically to have your 'front' face enemies as you move backwards, but it's still awkward.
Tanks have terrible controls
Missions are repetitive, and are either: shoot everything that movies, OR shoot everything that doesn't move
Obstacles feel like they take forever to destroy when you move into them. In actuality it doesn't take very long to blow them up, but it feels painful when having to go through several walls as certain vehicles who can't ground pound
The plot is incomprehensible. It appears there's a world with back story, but the campaign missions do nothing to explore it. For some reason I'm fighting loyalists, spacers and corvids? Who are these corvids and spacers? All I'm told is that the great leader is dead. I guess that means it's time to shoot up and place and massacre everyone?

The world built by Stellar Jockeys is unique, complex, evocative, strange and familiar. Despite being set far in the future, it holds some palpable realness that so many other games set in that time period fail to muster. 

The first game that comes to mind when I play this, is, oddly enough, F.E.A.R. I liked F.E.A.R. enough to play it and its expansion packs ( but not the sequels) several times over, and I firmly believe that if you liked F.E.A.R., you'll like Brigador as well. This is both an endorsement and a subtle warning: while I love both games to pieces, they are both unquestionably rather repetitive,  

You pick a loadout, arrive in the district, and utterly lay waste to it. Then you do it again, and then more times. The reason why this is fun is that there is a staggeringly large variety of loadouts, and each one presents its own challenges: with three very different types of vehicle (tank, mecha, and agrav, which are essentially Floating Gun Platforms) control in a different fashion, and each have their own quirks: tanks are typically slow and strong, but can ram things with explosive resuts, mecha are easy targets but quite straightforward to use, and agravs can float over certain obstacles. Add to this the four different weapon types, bullets, artillery, cannon and laser;  four different ""special weapons""-- EMPs, smoke grenades, camo, and the audio-kinetic pulse (this is essentially a cone of noise that can level a building-- or foe), and you have a lot of choices. 

Fortunately, in Brigador, the act of murder feels sublime.  Stellar Jockeys have perfectly calibrated the interface between sound design, animation and damage level, so that landing damage typically feels amazing. If you are a fan of gargantuan tanks being worn down in a series of ambushes, before near-erotically exploding, this will be something you are going to devote a couple dozen hours to. 

Speaking of sound design, while the 80s soundtrack is no Hotline Miami, it is certainly contains an earworm or two, and feels grimly suitable for what you're actually doing.

The ""problem"" with the narrative is a Marmite one: there's a lot of lore, and all the weapons, vehicles, and pilots have bios, but it's all sequestered away. If you demand your narrative and your gameplay synthesized, then you're probably going to be pissed off by this game, or at least disappointed. Which is a huge shame, because it's all really good, and I read all of it. In addition, none of the factions are shallow: each of the three are visually and thematically distinct, in refreshing ways. You'd think that a faction called ""Loyalsits"" would be boring but they aren't! 

In short, for a first game by an indie dev, who clearly have put a lot of effort into making a memorable experience, it's pretty great, and at least worth a spin if you need to scratch that ""stylish murder"" itch.  If you're looking for AAA fidelity, shiny graphics (in an isometric game lmao) or anything fancy, look elsewhere or be disappointed.",1523938637,1523938637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I usually do not like top down action games like shoot 'em ups. Though Brigador is definitely a more 'tactical' breed, it still features shooting in the forefront. However you have to use a more indirect approach most of the time. Vehicles, weapons and specials make every setup different enough to warrant a slightly different approach. Top that with varying missions with different goals, enemy placement and variation.

Visually the game is quite unique and overall looks really good. This is the high resolution 90s Syndicate/cyberpunk aesthetic that you were looking for. While being tile-based it is really stunning how nicely the various pre-rendered assets come together. One of the main tropes is the destructibility of basically everything, be it buildings, trees, walls, towers, etc., you can destroy anything that is inside the map boundaries resulting in huge eye-pleasing explosions. My only concern here is while these unique well-done visuals are one the strongest lures for the game it obstructs the gameplay a wee-bit every now and then. Specifically when a map starts at dawn and everything is darker and there are more shadows that is an objectively worse situation to play in because of worse visibility. And as far as I know it is randomized, so it is not mission related.

The lore included in the game is rather vast. While I would not say that it has too many totally unique ideas, the dystopian cyberpunk futurescape is engaging enough as a backdrop. There are tons of pilots to unlock with different backgrounds and portraits. Even vehicles and various gears have their own little description which gives them a unique stamp. Campaign missions also have a briefing that adds up to a decent story over time. You will eventually get to know your own employers and the strict nature they operate in. This is definitely not a future anyone is hoping for. As for mission design they are well-made and usually distinct enough. The layout being tile-based it eventually becomes rather samey, but it takes some time before you start to see the same building too often. On the other hand that is one of the points of the game, you have to be able to identify hazardous structures, so it becomes second nature to avoid or destroy them from a distance.

Brigador's main gameflow is a slower paced search and destroy oriented top down shooter. You choose your equipment then head on to complete your objectives which start with simple tasks like destroy every opposition in the area then pretty much goes into various combinations where structures and troops are targeted as well. Hazardous objects and less generic enemy units start to appear which will lead you into more difficult situations. Knowing the map is an important thing and proceeding in a way to avoid choke points, flanking enemies and destroying useful building as soon as possible is an important thing in later missions. The equipment you get is also quite varied. There are simple machine turrets, long range mortars, plasma cannons plus the ever-needed special equipment. In campaign mode you have a predetermined set of setups but in freelance mode you can choose any combination that you have already unlocked. Unlocks can be earned via money that are constantly gained through completing campaign missions and freelance assignments. Overall, Brigador offers a surprising amount of tactical options. You can drive three main types of vehicles: mechs, tanks and hovertanks/cars. They all have distinct features like the first two has an orientation that has to be controlled in order to move optimally during fights. There are objectively weaker sets which yield bonus money for completing missions. Overall, this is a diverse system with many options. Unfortunately, things can become extremely chaotic and you can find yourself in a bullet hell game with a slow moving, clunky vehicle. As I mentioned earlier visuals do not help the situation either. If you played games from the 80s this might not frustrate you and you will likely find quite a lot of fun hours with Brigador. I would add though that there are settings to customize the controls' behaviour and also a game speed changer which starts at 80% when you first launch the game and maxes out at 100% which kinda says something about the difficulty. Despite the cons Brigador still plays nicely and if anything the occasional problems might even add to the throwback charm.

Sound-wise the game does a decent job. Weapons and explosions sound great while feeling filtered which adds to the style. There are no voiced lines unfortunately, it would have added to the atmosphere for sure. Musically however Brigador stands above the rest. I might not being totally objective here as I am a big fan of the new outrun/synthwave scene, but Makeup and Vanity Set's tracks specially written to accompany the game are just amazing. Even though you hear the main menu theme a thousand times, it always gives a great feel right at the first moment, that you are in a different period, at the time of conflict. During missions the variation is better, though mixing is a rather simple, it is still hard to not appreciate the great musical score. Moreover, you can get the multiple albums via the deluxe edition. They are great to listen to outside of the game, what more you want from a soundtrack?

As for content I already wrote about the many options available for the player. The campaign is quite lengthy and was already extended by updates but for anyone who fells in love with the gameplay and finds joy for hundreds of hours there is depth to be found here.

In the end, Brigador remains a surprise hit for me that I come back every now and then. Originally wanted to take a look after having it for some time to check out the visuals and more importantly the music, the gameplay and the world created pulled me in. Despite the shortcomings mostly related to gameplay Brigador still is a genuinely great game.

So, when I bought this, it was early into it's early access period and I didn't care for it. Playing it again over the last few days I found it has come a long way. 

In case you don't know what Brigador is, it's like the old Mechwarrior game on Genesis... although I honestly feel it's closer to the Strike games (Desert/Jungle/Urban/Soviet/Nuclear), which I love. You have multiple vehicle options/types to go on a mission that includes a fully destructable environment. That type of sandbox presented in this game is perfect.

Buuuut... the main thing I hate about this game are the controls. I'm constantly pausing to switch control options, and often times none really feel ""right"" and usable to me. That was one of the main reasons I quit playing it while it was in EA, and that hasn't gotten much better. Maybe it's just me, but yeah...

The other thing I don't like is the campaign has you first doing the mech, then the tank, then the grav car thing. So you're stuck four missons at a time using not just one vehicle, but one type of that vehicle. Later in the campaign you can switch between three or four vehicle options, but the limited vehicle selection makes the campaign kind of repetitive.

Freelance mode is much more fun, as there you can use any combination of everything you've purchased. But as the game has a campaign mode, I obviously want to finish it, although it's tough to stay interested enough when you've got the much superior Freelance mode.

Its a mech game right? But maybe your more into tanks than mechs or something? You can play as a Tank, hell there are a ton of them, want to play a hover tank maybe? Think treads are too old school?

Yes, You can. Maybe you want to hang back and pick off groups of enemies with artillary and precise firepower before they can possibly get to you. You totally can. Literally just approach your work as you see fit. 

Its such a great game dude. And the more you play the more the possibilities open up before you like a fucking wide horizon filled with shit blowing up. Any kind of mission or difficulty you want to play is covered. Like maybe you want your levels to be full of nothing but civvies that you run over and gun down? Yeah you can totally do that. Do you want the difficulty to gradually increase over time or even gradually decrease over time? Its all doable.

Brigador challenges you to select one of a massive array of vehicles (tanks, hoverbikes, anti-gravity platforms, small powersuits, massive mechs, and everything in between) a loadout of two weapons (selected from the likes of laser shotguns, corrosive gas grenades, flamethrowers, machine guns, mortars, rockets, short rnage sledges) and a defensive mechanism (smoke bombs, EMPs, active camo, and more), and then go mano-a-armyo against a massive array of procedurally generated foes, taking out strategic objectives in setpiece afte setpiece, where every single thing is destructible, and you absolutely get paid to blow it all up.

Brigador is set up in a sci-fi setting TEEMING with extra goodies to learn and read about in an extensive encyclopedia of entries to unlock about literally everything in the game, from the civilians you step on, the pilots you unlock, the weapons you fire, the vehicles you drive, the nature of the civil war than rages, and everything else (The way the game's lore and history handles FTL travel is decidedly horrific.) Attention to detail comes to this game in spades, and it oozes neon colored theme from every pore.

The game sports a campaign mode to ease you through learning the games mechanics, and then runs you through some challenging missions all about restricting those mechanics once it teaches you about them. This all culminates in you learning everything you need to take on the meat of the game's procedurally generated Freelance Modes, which are the bulk of the game. You can buy campaigns of varying length and difficulty, from short 2 map campaigns for quick plays, to massive, 39 mission long grindhouses that require you to go through 15 odd random maps as well as about 20 of the campaigns most difficult missions - all without ever taking a single loss and all using the same vehicle the entire time. Not for the faint of heart by any means. Freelance allows you to completely customize every vehicle you make, from pilots, which determine difficulty and money modifiers, to the weapons and defense systems. Campaign mode, in contrast provides three to four set specific pilot and vehicle combos, each one providing a different way of tackling the same mission, from a massive tank designed to be able to brawl its way through, to a small powersuit designed to sneak around, strategically grab objectives, mousehole through walls, and then deftly escape.

You quickly discover that every ounce of power you can throw at your foes cna be tossed right back at you in kind, meaning waltzing into an army can be a dangerous prospect. You learn to use sound distractions, blowing up buildings t lure enemies around corners, or using smoke to confuse, and creating holes in terrain to make artifical chokepoints that last barely as long as the battles that you made them for. Each map generally challenges you to take out some assortment of building, or to defeat specific enemies, or a general number of nonspecific enemies. Maps will generally reward you for completing multiple objectives as well as side objectives as well, so you need to rate your risk/reward - can you finish clearing the entire map, or are you getting low on ammo and health and need to move on, hoping to replenish?

The game's visual presentation is cohesive and pulls everything together, combining laser shotguns, explosions, mortars, headlights showing which way enemies are focused (stay out of sight!), even down to tiny things like crowds with swaying flashlights around their neck. Neon metropolises are your playground, set to a pulsing background of heavy beats and electronic music.

STRONG recommendation for anyone who likes mecha games, top down shooters, and is looking for a game that they can play in small bite or large chunks, with tons and tons of unlockable content to keep things new and fresh. The game is fun, and although you can get yourself into some incredibly sticky situations, the game never feels unfun - just difficult at times, hectic, chaotic, and hoping you can dash away from the missiles and rockets to kill a shiled generator for some extra life.

Good graphics, nice dystopian/cyberpunk environments that are fully destructible, a thunderstorm of effects and on top of that a disgustingly good Retrowave Soundtrack!

As dificuldades são definidas pelo piloto que você escolher, o mecha, as armas e por ultimo, o levels. O jogo tem uma campanha grande que funciona mais como um extenso tutorial, lá você também junta dinheiro. O foco do jogo é o modo freelance, lá você tem que pagar pelas missões, equipamentos e pilotos, é ai que o jogo fica repetitivo. Pra mim foi um bom jogo pra passar o tempo jogando seções curtas, pra outras pessoas (que já entram no nicho do jogo) é muito divertido jogar as fases e liberar tudo que o jogo tem bloqueado. 
Dito isso tudo, não encontrei bugs e acho o preço justo, então vou recomendar positivamente esse game, mesmo assim recomendo qualquer possível comprador procurar por vídeos e ver o que está realmente comprando.

Being frank, Brigador has not made more success because it is a niche game, although it has its defects (repetitive and difficult to understand and control in the beginning) has many more qualities: good soundtrack and quality sound effects, large variety of pilots, mechs and weapons, totally destructive scenario and several different difficulties.
The difficulties are defined by the pilot you choose, the mech, the weapons and lastly, the levels. The game has a great campaign that works more like an extensive tutorial, there you also put some money together.

-Lots of Replayability
-Graphics are detailed
-Soundtrack suits the tone of the game nicely

More in depth review! Does this game appeal to me as a “Dad who Dads?” Yes. While it must be played with two hands, and while there is no in-mission save function, the missions are short and don’t require too much of a time investment. If you have to leave the computer, it won’t take you forever to get back to where you were. There’s also quite a lot of replayability to the campaign and a whole section for Skirmishes!

I also like that this game does not try to spread itself too thin in terms of things to do. You are there to lay waste to a map full of pixelated enemies and you have a broad selection of machinery to use. I am really glad that this game does not have any “Escort Missions.” There’s also a hefty section of lore for you to unlock and read through. I skipped through this on my let’s play, but it is pretty interesting stuff; a lot of thought and depth went into it.

I had a little bit of a struggle using a controller, but there are mechanics to adjust that experience. I confess I am not the tinkering type, but I found keyboard and mouse to be just as fun to play with. Some missions can be quite difficult, but they aren’t prohibitively so. If you practice a few times you’ll get the hang of it.

I would have liked to see adding in allies or a bit of a strategy element to this. An old-old-old game I used to play (LAPD Future Cop) had a RTS versus mode that was pretty fun. I completely understand why something like this wasn’t put in, but it is on my wishlist from the devs! The campaign is a bit short, but it has much more flexibility and diversity of engagements in the Skirmish mode.

Anyway to sum up from my perspective: Great game, solid investment. Very easy to pick up and play.",1515352432,1515352518,True,4,0,0.544134616851806641,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Allows a range of playstyle, from grinding slow behemoth that can quickly level blocks to small powersuits that can hide and go stealth.  Noteworthy that I feel like I could beat nearly any mission with nearly any loadout if I am willing to figure out how.  Some loadouts are more challenging, but would be hard to make a real fail loadout. 

Vehicle options - The difference in control/gameplay of the different chassis provides a lot of variability and the vehicle multiplers make it rewarding to challenge yourself or try random rigs. 
 Overall they look fantastic and provide plenty of variety.  I do wish there were mech chassis with more than two legs, but not a big deal. 9/10

Weapons/Specials - The weapons overall are fun and have sufficient variety.  The powerful weapons actually feel powerful, which is a big compliment. My only complaint in the weapon department are the lack of missiles, but it's certainly no deal breaker with the options provided and considering the extra ui/control that would be needed for missiles.  The Specials available are great, but I wish there were more.  Spicing the specials up some alone would improve thinges greatly.  It would have been nice if there were some Specials for mobility too. 8/10

Graphics - Overall visual aesthetics are fantastic.  From the UI and pilot portraits to the in-game palette, great!  The lighting in particular, and the debris, are excellent.  I wish all missions were at night just because the lighting is so gorgeous.  The game doesn't support 4k, which is a big bummer though, and some of the laser weapons have no visible beam which I find disappointing. 8/10

Sound - Good, but more mixed bag here.  Music is great, no complaints here!  Some of the weapon's volumes are way low or just not impressive.  The Audio Kinetic special should sound impressive instead of being barely noticeable and some of the rail guns are virtually silent.  I also wish the narrator voice on the first campaign mission stuck around for other missions, sounded cool! GREAT LEADER IS DEAD 7/10

Missions - This is the weak spot in the game.  While the mechanics of the AI and how the various targets (Comms, Substations) interact with them are good, the fact that the only mission objectives are to destroy the buildings and perhaps some captains is lacking.  Would have been nice to see some other objectives in at least the freelance missions like assassination, extraction, protection for a convoy, etc.  There is really only one mission in this game, only the scenery changes. Easy implementations that would really stretch the game's value. 6/10

Lore/Fluff/Story - I dig the fluff but don't agree with having to use in-game $ to purchase it bit by bit.  Fluff should be there to immerse me, not act as a carrot on a stick for grinding.  IMO it should be unlocked with campaign progression or purchase of the equipment in question.  All the current design effectively does is incentivize people to not look into the lore until after they've filled out their garage. 5/10",1515193512,1516127872,True,5,0,0.542554855346679688,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Is a game that isn't hard to learn, not too hard to master, but keeps you interested for a pretty long time.
The game is basically a mix between Syndicate & Mechwarrior 3050.

The graphics and atmosphere are very Syndicate like when it comes down to this Blade Runner like feeling and the music does a good job to support this setting also.

The Mechwarrior part is where it comes down to what combat vehicle and weaponry to choose for the next mission.

Although the missions are basically all the same, (Kill and or destroy X units of type Y) it doesn't get boring and it does fit the lore. Which is a very important part of this game.
As a matter of fact, it's just a lot of fun to test your configurations, tactics, doing combat and exploring the various maps, reading the lore, etc.
It's a game that packs a lot of universe behind the scene and it shows in the small details; which is a great thing.

Is there something I would like to see in the game?
Hmm, maybe a sort of endless battlefield mode. (Random map, endless waves of enemies and see how long you can last. Just for the fun of it.)
But, something tells me that this wouldn't really fit in this particular game universe/setting. Although it could be lots of fun, I think.

The DLC is also worth every penny. If not just for the cool audiobook that comes with it. (If you like such things)

Fun games don't have to be triple A studio productions.

Story is lacking, but this game makes up for it in style and gameplay. 

While the campaign at first shoehorns you into only one loadout per mission, it branches out about 40% of the way through to allow you 3-4 different loadouts per level, each one changing the way you play drastically, from taking and dishing out massive ordnances, to hit-and-run tactics.

The game is best in the former as you're likely to get swarmed by large numbers of enemies. It never gets tiring firing a 140mm cannon into a large group of enemies. The visual feedback in this game is phenomenal. 

As to what I didn't enjoy, the isometric angle also makes it difficult to tell exactly where your shot will land, leading to plenty of missed shots. 

The limited ammo system can be hit-or-miss. It adds a lot of tension as you often have to pick your shots instead of simply spraying everywhere, which is a plus. However, if there are no enemy ammo drops to be had, your only recourse is to reload at ammo dumps. 

This is no fun at all given that it has to be the RIGHT type of ammo dump, often ALL the way on the other side of the map AND it is easily blown up AND it has limited ammo. Even less fun if you have a slow, lumbering vehicle and there are a million obstacles in the way. Running out of ammo happened more often that I would have liked, and I feel I was already playing conservatively when possible. 

Thankfully, there is a built-in infinite ammo cheat easily accessible through the developer console via F1. So these negatives are moot depending on how you want to play this game (namely if you just want to blow stuff up). Even then, these negatives largely don't get in the way of the mountain of fun to be had.",1513381841,1513381841,True,6,0,0.555986404418945313,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're interested in driving stompy robots buy Bragador.  If you like isometric shooters buy Bragador. If you like challenging yourself buy Bragador.   If none of those things are true or you want something casual to spend your time on there are better choices.  

Now for the long version.  Brigador is an isometric vehicle shooter with both a campaign and freelance mode.  Either pays out money on successful mission completion which you use to unlock vehicles, weapons, special abilities, freelance missions, and lore.  The learning curve is relatively steep but managable, the tutorial missions at the start of the campaign are decent enough to learn the ropes.  The game can be quite difficult but that difficulty is always fair.  

Campaign mode have fixed enemy spawns and a selection of 4 loadouts to bring to that mission.  Difficulty of campaign missions mostly ramps up with earlier missions being much easier and later missions being harder.  There is one curveball mission in the middle which probably rage inducing for some. The loadouts for each campaign mission tend to have a mix of reasonable and challenge loadouts.  

Freelance mode is the meat of the game.  In it you choose a pilot which replaces the difficulty slider found in most games.  From there you select a vehicle, 2 weapons, special ability, and mission.  Freelance missions range from 2 maps to 30+ maps.  Individual maps have fixed layouts and psuedorandom enemy spawns.  Depending on the pilot, vehicle, and mission choices difficulty can range from cakewalk to 'I'm a skeleton in a golf cart, today the enemies will probably be exploding me for a change.' 

Weapons range from a lowly peashooter machine gun to city block leveling artillery with a huge range of weapons in between.  Almost every weapon has a niche that needs to be considered when choosing your loadout.  

Vehicles range from heavily armed nigh invincible supertanks to fast and agile but fragile agravs.   And a golf cart.  

All of the choices available for for freelance give a ton of replayability.  Different vehicles give a ton of variety, a Lowmill plays nothing like a Hoker.  Even within a vehicle different loadouts can play very differently, a Raider with Kraken, Pinch, and smoke, plays very differently from a Raider with Harvester, Donkey, and camo. 

Lorewise the game is set on a dystopian colony world far distant from earth.  The lore entries, pilot descriptions, and weapon descriptions are all written from the perspective of characters in the universe.  Each has their biases and knowledge gaps.  Personally I've found the writing to be uniformly excellent.  It's one of the better crafted worlds I've come across in a game, to the extent that when a new patch comes out the first thing I check is to see if there are new lore entries to unlock.  

If the above sounds interesting buy Brigador it will be worth every penny once you have an idea what you're doing.",1511868187,1511868187,True,23,0,0.705945849418640137,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A game where deaths feel like a collection of mistakes I can remember, not a game mechanic working against me. The music is great. The aestetic and graphics are great. The gameplay is great.


Brigador is a game that has been lovingly crafted, and I do mean that. Looking at the game while it's running (in a high resolution anyway) may not key you in on how it's doing what it does, but the game is entirely 2D. Even with the massive amount of rendering space on screen at once on my 1920x1200 monitor, the game still runs over 200FPS, and never drops. It's not an unoptimized mess, and it still manages to have a lot of pretty features for those who want the most to look at out of their game (The aiming path is rendered to make the 2D look 3D, and there is a lot of dynamic lighting to do the same).

With Brigador's Campaign mode you'll have most of the game's learning curve explained to get you on to a plain where you may start to use any of the vehicles, weapons and defences you purchase effectively. The first 12 missions aid you in controlling a Mech, a Tank and an Agrav (Anti-Gravity, or [i]hovertank[/i], if you will). Controls are currently available to split between Agravs between Mechs and Tanks, and while some people want a unique control preset between Mechs and Tanks, if you aren't bothered by the same control scheme on both, you won't need to change it every time you want to use one or the other. Controls are available between forward being [b]Tile Absolute:[/b] north on the map (North being selectable as top left or top right), [b]Screen Absolute:[/b] north on the screen (always up, you control 45 degrees against the map's grid), and [b]Relative:[/b] forward is forward to the vehicle's heading (allowing you to hold W and D to walk in circles). Agrav controls are mostly the same except for [b]Relative[/b], where W will move the vehicle towards the cursor. Pressing A and D will still strafe relative to the vehicle's heading. This occurs mainly because a mech has heading of the legs, and the turret. The legs move, the turret does not. A tank has the heading of the treads and the turret. The treads move, the turret does not. An Agrav has the heading of a turret. The turret moves. If you've played Hotline Miami or are used to the way it handles movement, an Agrav might not feel too far off when played in [b]Screen Absolute[/b] mode. There are a few options for control toggles: mech crouching, orientation lock, and Agrav low-fly height. Players may also change gamespeed (the default is 80, and the slider goes up to 100, or down to 50); the ingame loadingscreen hints recommend changing it down ""if you use a controller or like seeing stuff explode in slow motion."" I personally have left it at 80, but allowing people to change it is definitely a plus. Too bad you can't set it to 150% and play [i][b]Super Brigador Up-Armoured Turbo: Hyper Armored Combat[/b][/i].

The music is quite enjoyable, and I'd recommend the Deluxe edition from the start to save you a dollar (or two, depending on your currency) to get it's soundtrack (The Deluxe edition comes with an audio book and the soundtrack in MP3.) So far, my only complaint with the entire game is that the soundtrack isn't administered in FLAC. That's pretty impressive when you consider that I have no other problems.

[b]Edit:[/b] Makeup and Vanity Set has a bandicamp, which contains all four albums currently included in Brigador's Soundtrack on Steam; Bandicamp supports FLAC downloads, however: [i]Up-Armored[/i] will cost you at least [b]$7 USD[/b], [i]Uplink[/i] is [b]Free[/b], [i]Volume I[/i] costs [b]$10 USD[/b], and [i]Volume II[/i] costs [b]$15 USD[/b], which is a little upsetting to say the least, if you want FLAC quality [i]and[/i] the audiobook. [b]End Edit[/b]

Do I think Brigador is worth your time? Absolutely. Brigador's gameplay allows you to jump in at just about any time after you've made some bank to choose what pilot, vehicle, weapons and defences you want and then a set of zones to just play whenever. Pilots dictate the game's difficulty and additional victory cash rewards, with some pilots ranging from easier difficulties, to a pilot who's difficulty is at max on the first map you will load on (each pilot has a Bio, and visible stats for difficulty and payout bonuses, regardless of wether you've bought them using ingame currency. There are no loot boxes, and no way to use real world money to get anything in this game).

-Pasted from a comment I made somewhere-

Awesome graphics, if you're a fan of the sprite style.  Everything is so detailed, all the buildings, mechs, enemies, piles of rubble you leave behind and even the little civvies running around.  The lighting is great too.  The flash from the various guns and lasers, all the neon lighting around, and the frantic little flashlights that kick in when you scare the civilians.  It also interacts with the environment really well, the shadows from your vehicles lights look awesome on the rubble and grass and stuff.

Sound and music are great.  Guns, vehicles and explosions sound very powerful and punchy, the audio helps everything feel like it has weight to it.

Everything is destructible.  For me this is more about seeing shit blow up in a battle than necessarily pathing through structures, which is slow and loud (but still fun)



The vehicles have 3 types, mechs, tanks, and anti-grav vehicles.  Within those three categories, there are a variety of sizes, with differing stats, weapon mount types and difficulty multipliers (more on that in a bit)

There are 3 factions that each have vehicles in those three styles.
Each faction has visual differences and, if I remember right, faction specific stat tweaks.  Nothing game-changing, but one faction may favor shields over hull strength for instance.

Each vehicle has a certain amount of hull strength, shields, and overcharge shield capacity.  Hull strength is just your hitpoints, can't remember if there's any way to replenish it (I don't think so).  Shields can be replenished, though they won't do it passively over time, but from pickups from destroyed enemies.  And overcharge is bonus shield capacity that deteriorates over time.

Each vehicle has two weapon mounts, from types like auxiliary, main, heavy, small (and a few others I think), that determines what guns you get to pick from for your loadout.



For weapons there are ballistic weapons, lasers and mortars/artillery.  Ballistic and lasers have a few variations like cannon, chaingun, machine gun, shotgun etc., and artillery has varying sizes/ranges.

Individual weapons have different stats for things like shield damage, hull damage, fire rate, reload speed, structure damage, penetration, magazine size and total ammo pool.  Penetration is pretty neat, some of the big cannons can fire right through multiple structures.  Nothing like rear-shotting an enemy tank through a city block.

You also get to pick one of four or five special abilites, like smoke screen, cloaking, emp charge.  They have a cooldown, but unlimited use.



I Haven't really played campaign at all, below mission info is about freelance/sandbox mode.

You start by picking an operation from the list.  Any op will always have the same maps and the same number of them.  So ""Operation Whatever"" will always take place on the drainage map, the slums and the canal for example, but the placement of objectives and enemies will be randomized.

Aside from taking place on different maps, each mission plays out the same.  You unlock the exit by doing at least one of the main objectives - kill a % of all enemies, kill all the commanders, or blow up all of the big artillery structures.  There are also a few side missions that are the same each time.  The more you do, the more money you earn for unlocking stuff.",1511854388,1511854388,True,3,0,0.52449113130569458,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anyway, if you like gritty old-school cyberpunk with great worldbuilding and moral ambiguity, if you like the idea of an isometric shooter with a hefty graft of simulation and highly tactical gameplay, give Brigador a go.

It does have a fairly steep learning curve (probably not so bad since the Up-Armoured Edition added new tutorials and lower default speed, I started on the original release) but it's really worth it, and there's lots of replayability with the variety of loadouts and difficulty levels. Everything from huge mechs and tanks with heavy artillery which can level a whole block with one shot to tiny powersuits with gamma lasers which can cook the enemy through walls and nippy agravs which can flit through enemy fire and circle around to attack their weaker rear armour, you can find a build for pretty much any playstyle you want. At higher difficulties with the smaller, more vulnerable units you really need to think ahead and take full advantage of your environment and equipment to survive.

The devs have done a fantastic job of supporting and extending the game despite it sadly not being a huge financial success for them, adding new levels and units and improving the graphics, with more to come in future updates.

Many of the options feel very different from one another adding so much to the depth of the game. You'll definitely keep coming back to try new things for a long time.

Finally I can't leave a review without mentioning the story. While many games in the past similar to this would have a barebones story that a lot of times were either down right boring or in some cases never even finished Brigador sets itself FAR apart. While it's not always forthright this game is filled to the brim with lore and quite an interesting story. I won't spoil anything but I definitely hope we see more of Brigador. I'm aware there is an e-book and audiobook though I have not checked them out but I certainly will soon!

If the game wasn't great enough as it was the developers released an updated version free of charge a while back and are still updating with new content! Definitely show these guys some love.",1511672568,1511672568,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Underneath there is a lot of customisation and a wide array of tactics you'll use to avoid an untimely demise.

The campaign mode has loads of missions, most with a choice of four loadouts.  These allow you to try to have a go at each scenario in very different ways.  Freelance mode allows you to set up your own vehilce and choose a set of missions.  There are three vehilce classes (tank, walker, agrav) which all handle in different ways and have significant pros and cons.  In each class there is a spectrum of sizes and the three factions each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

The difficulty in Freelance mode is entirely up to you, there are no easy/medium/hard settings.  Each pilot has a difficulty rating and many get harder as you progress through missions.  Certain vehicles and classes lend themselves to particular weaponry and each weapon has pros and cons.  Some maps are wide and open with lots of room to move but nowhere to hide, others are perfect for sneaking and setting up bottle-neck ambushes but with no room to turn and run.

Its easy to learn in a big heavy tank, able to take a beating and dish out huge damage but you cant run or hide.  In some more difficult missions run and hide is the only thing which can keep you alive.  Projectiles take your vehilces momentum, making fast agravs exceptionally good artillery platorms.

The central theme of Brigador experimentation.  It's easy to find a loadout you like and use it to learn the basics, then start swapping parts and branch out.  Soon you'll find something completely different which works just as well but in a totally different way.",1511604965,1511604965,True,2,0,0.541216909885406494,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Tons of variety and choices in your loadouts. Whether you like being fast and nimble, a brawler, a sniper, the ol' bait-and-switch, or even stealth (yes, that's possible in a two story walking tank) there's a way to get what you want out of this game. Tons of chassis, tons of weapons, and 4 different special abilities that you can mix and match to make what you want.

Campaign does a good job of teaching the basics and how the different vehicle types work, and then starts to ramp up the difficulty over time until by the end you feel like you got gud. There are also some interesting wrenches in the works here and there (Joy Bus/Hell Ride anyone?). It's nice that you can select from 4 premade loadouts; doesn't break the balance of the missions while giving you choices to suit your playstyle and also introducing a new player to the concept of building a loadout. (NOTE: I haven't played the new E-series so I can't vouch for that.)

Very well done freelance mode lets you take things as slow and gentle as you want...or if you'd rather bend over and take it like a man, that's an option too. Build a loadout freely by picking a vehicle along with two weapons and a special ability and a pilot to go along with it. Then pick how many levels you want to run. The game determines how the difficulty scales based on which pilot you choose, as well as the payout, with the vehicle you choosing also providing bonus cash if you make it out. Precursor James Double Donkey runs are rumored to be the hot new thing but I haven't saved up the 100 million yet so don't ask me.

More subjective portion: I love this game's style and worldbuilding. Shots of all kind are distinct, the whole place has a sort of downtrodden industrial look to it and the color palette and art reflects that without compromising the gameplay (too much at least, see cons.) The backstory is great as well and the Lore section allowing you to read up on the game's world as told by its inhabitants is awesome.

When you actually get into the game, the environment doesn't feel limiting or like a playing field, more so a tool you can use if you're clever enough. Pretty much all 4 special abilities tie into it at least indirectly and all vehicle classes have one way or another of smashing through groves of trees or apartment blocks. No need to walk down the street into a tank platoon, bust out from behind them two blocks down and hit them where it hurts most. Kool-Aid Man Simulator 2016.

Cons:

Sometimes I find it hard to tell whether a particular piece of scenery is explosive or not. Dunno if that's just me or what.

Can be a little hard to see the red glow emitted by an enemy behind a wall sometimes.

Freelance mode is slow to start since you have to unlock the different equipment and pilots which can take a bit of doing. (Thankfully you can pick what to spend your blood money on rather than there being a linear unlock system.)

Some enemies have rather unexpected loadouts and can catch you way off guard, other enemies are quite hard to deal with based on what you brought to the fight. Some loadouts just don't have a good way of dealing with those red-headlight suicide bomber enemies.

The aiming system is a little weird at first, especially when fighting agravs.

Overall:

Not a perfect game but definitely a very competent example of a roguelite that will definitely scratch that big stompy robot itch. Solid gameplay mechanics but unless you find fun within said mechanics themselves it may get old fast.",1511598792,1511598792,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That identity is neon-soaked, synth-scored, vehicular mayhem. There's a ton of unlockables along with a good amount of lore if you care to read it, much of tinged with a dark sense of humor. But the real meat of the game is the all-single-player rampages you get sent on with your tank/mech/hovercraft across the cyberpunk planet of Solo Nobre.

Although there are some light stealth elements and discretion is important at times, overall this is a game that wants you to fully enjoy making damn near everything in sight asplode with the incredible firepower at your disposal. Even just fighting off enemies will often result in extensive collateral damage to the environment. Which is fine, because this game basically tracks ""collateral damage"" as ""bonus points"".

Beyond that, the ""Freelance"" mode offers quite a lot of customization, allowing you to combine whatever weapons with your chassis of choice before setting off for a string of missions. If you want a tiny, tracked motorcycle or battlesuit equipped with grenade launchers? No problem. A massive superheavy tank or hovercraft with a cloaking device? Done! It's all in there, waiting to be unlocked.

One last note: while some objections could still be made about the HUD, I think, (the icons are often rather small and hard to make out) the controls offer a satisfying amount of customization. If you're worried that you'll be stuck with a scheme you hate...don't sweat it too much. As long as twin-stick shooters in general are fun for you, you can likely find a setup that works for you in the options screen here.

If you're looking for something quiet, introspective, or with multiplayer then this isn't the game you want.

WELCOME, BRIGADOR. Back in the days we had these shooters Jungle Strike and Desert Strike with (nearly) completely destructible terrain. Then came Syndicate and Syndicate 2, both upping the ante with even more full blown orgy of destruction and endorsing the player to do massive collateral damage on one's wake. Then, on the whole different perspective we had wonderful Mech games in the forms of Mech Warrior series (well, about half of 'em were wonderful, at least) and Mech Commander. From this background comes Brigador, cherry-picks the best parts from its role models and brings us the terrible, beautiful wanton of destruction.

Only after few hours under my belt I already love it. It is both a tactical shooter and nearly limitless sandbox of destruction - like playing with a huge Lego set without assembly instructions and a ton of explosives. Brigador's slightly pixelish, neon light drenched and shadow blotted landscapes get constantly pulverized  under heavy mortar strikes, rip-roaring chainguns, rampaging tanks, stomping mechs, even hover-like flying platforms - and they all are designed in a delightfully wonky way that is completely implausible and yet very delightful, like something out of any 2000AD comic strip pages. 

The game has a quite lengthy campaign dealing with procedurally 'liberating' the colony planet as a group of mercenaries doing it all for money (handsomely paid by a shady megacorporation). You use the cash to buy more drivers, vehicles, weapons, missions and (also very delightful) intel and lore for the mission mode, which I think is the real beef of the game. (Although I have enjoyed the campaign so far, too.) 

You set up your death machine by selecting a hull from towering huge mechs or 'tanks' (more like an apartment block with guns on treads) or flying behemoths to relatively tiny ACPA suits, IFVs or flying platforms, and bolting on them your favored methods of destruction, and off you go. This gives lots of variety into how you plan to pull your job through - level everything with massive firepower, screw dodging and try to just soak the incoming damage with you shields and armour, or be the nimble little bastard that nobody can hit into and surgically strike your targets and dance away from the blasts before the enemy gets their cumbersome big hiney on the spot. Your imagination is the limit. 

Brigador hits my nerve perfectly with its payload of insane scale destruction, frantic shooty-action, tactical aspects and lovely old-skool visuals, not to mention the groovy retro-drenched Synthwave soundtrack pounding on the background. Cherry on the top, the lore is fun to read and gives names and faces on the odd looking things you're either driving yourself or blasting away with glee. Easy to get a grip on, simple enough to learn and time consuming to master with every aspect, Brigador reminds me of good old times - and that we have way too few good Mech games around.

The frantic combat is tough-but-fair. High replayability with things kept interesting by a huge number of choices in vehicle type, each with pros / cons, and a large array of different kinds of weapons. Stealth mechanics are not particularly deep, but their simplicity lends itself well to the game's general sense of urgency. Fast-paced action and precision is balanced well with tactical maneuvering and thinking on your feet. Find your niche in personal style and thrive.

Like any proper retro-inspired action game, the story does not get in the way of the game. There are no cutscenes, or even screens that force you to read about what's going on. If you so choose, however, the game's grimdark setting shines through narrative in the form of technical and personal descriptions displayed as notes written by characters in game, complete with a touch of dark humor that never feels out of place.

I did not expect a game primarily about piloting mechs and blowing things up to have an incredibly rich, dark aesthetic. While not cyberpunk, it grips tightly to the same tone of a cold, cynical dystopia lit frequently by neon. The gritty style of the game's graphics is used to grand effect with cool-looking weapon effects and explosions. While it carries a certain oldschool feel, being set on an isometric plane, Brigador does not look or feel dated, partially due to its clever use of shaders.

The music, composed by Makeup and Vanity Set (MAVS), could singlehandedly give any best-of playlist put together by New Retrowave a run for its money. This reason alone should justify a purchase if you enjoy music like Perturbator, Carpenter Brut, Mega Drive, or Power Glove.

I expected a more visceral, lots of action and shooting all the time gameplay. Instead it's actually a very tactical and sometimes stealth driven which can actually be frustrating if you went in expecting otherwise. There's also a rather annoying gimmick level that raises a sudden roadblock while you're playing the campaign. Controls can feel a bit clunky too, tank controls just don't work well in a 2d isometric when you're trying to concentrate on so many little things on the screen. And they really don't give much ammo in some parts which ties into that tactical aspect they push. Often I found myself holding back and playing slow, which just became tedious rather than fun. Also you'll find the levels mostly boil down to the same thing, blow the things up and exit. Very 90s I guess, but repetitive. Repetition can be fun when it's mindless, but becomes a chore when having to be very careful about movement and ammo consumption, etc.

I see a mech game, I investigate.

I was not disappointed.

Brigador is a fantastic little game that has a surprisingly large amount of world building for the universe that it has you playing around in. At its core, it’s a simple sandbox game that has you ploughing through sectors and wasting enemies while completing objectives. The main campaign serves to get you comfortable to the various vehicular control schemes (mechs, tanks, and hovercrafts) and weapon types while sprinkling some lore in short text briefings before each mission. Once you finish that though (roughly 20+ levels), the real fun begins. The meat and potatoes of this game are in its FREELANCE mode, where you can totally customize your player before you go play a series of “see how far you can go” type missions. Choose your pilot, vehicle, weapon loadout, and mission environment. Every run earns you cash to spend on other variations of the elements I just mentioned. Experimentation is greatly encouraged, as you can try different loadouts/vehicle combinations to suit your (any) playstyle.

The music is fantastic as well (80s synthpop/wave), thumping away as you blast away at baddies.

There is also an audiobook that’s included with the deluxe package (game+music+audiobook), as of this review I have not read it yet.

Overall: Fantastic game that gets even more entertaining once you finish the main campaign. Once you warm up to the control schemes (of which there are many options) and shooting mechanics, the game truly becomes a real fun experience.

In a nutshell the game takes place in a late 1980’s early 90s esc cyber punk dystopian future where humanity has spread colonies amongst the stars. The game takes place in the city of Solo Nobre, a former corporate mega city turned Cuban esc regime by the efforts of Great Leader and his army the NEP. You as the player take the role of a “Brigador” essentially a mercenary hired by the corporations to accomplish various goals and wreaking as much havoc as possible within Solo Nobre during the chaos brought by great leader’s assassination in exchange for cold hard cash.

	In terms of gameplay brigador plays very much like the old SNES BattleTech top down mech shooter, albeit with a greater degree of polish. The player takes control of one of the various war machines in the game to accomplish their assigned goals and has a wide assortment of weaponry to do so. By completing missions and successfully extracting you earn cash which can be used to unlock various items in the game such as new pilots, vehicles, weapons, and lore documents. Brigador’s gameplay is divided into two major parts the first being the campaign/story mode, in this mode the player must accomplish a series of missions using premade vehicle loadouts. Campaign missions can have a wide assortment of objectives but most boil down to eliminate the target then get out of the district. The second mode is free lance where players can select a pilot (difficulty level and payout multipliers), vehicle and its weapons, as well as what operation (series of levels) they wish to play. Every level will pit you against one of three factions, the NEP, the Corvids, and the Spacers. Each faction has their own vehicle sets (many of which you the player can actually use your self) and have different strengths and weaknesses though these are hardly noticeable when you start deploying with weapons that destroy entire city blocks in a single shot.

	In terms of sound design and eye candy brigador achieves what its going for. The sprawling neon lit city scapes are fully realized in an isometric style reminiscent of command and conquer tiberian sun and dripping with just as much atmosphere. The game’s soundtrack by Makeup and vanity set is simply fantastic and matches the visuals to the letter; I must point out however that the sound design for individual weapons and vehicles tends to rely on reusing sound assets though this is hardly noticeable in the grand scheme of things.

Brigador’s story and world building is perhaps the aspect I love the most about this game, every piece of equipment, vehicle, and pilot has back story detailed in various logs that take on different perspectives some of which going so far as to bring a bit of humor to what would otherwise be a bland lore document. The writing behind some of these logs is pretty clever and though not award winning materiel it certainly does add a bit of depth to what is otherwise just a top down shooter. 

I do thoroughly enjoy this game and would highly recommend it, but I can’t help to see a few problems with it. The most glaring issue I see with the game is how repetitive it can get after a while, once you've completed every campaign mission you turn to freelance, but then it doesn't take long before you're running through the same city districts over and over again; the only real diversity coming from the vehicle and weapon set up your using as well as the possibility that you might be fighting a different faction this time around. A lack of any kind of multiplayer also kinda limits the game’s replayability and effectively makes this a game I play when I have no one else to play with. One last gripe I have is that though all three opposing factions are well fleshed out in terms of design, back story, and visible arsenals they tend to function all the same and lack any kind of behavioral differences.

If I could make suggestions for updates, or changes to be made in any prospective sequel it would be the following.

The inclusion of some kind of coop option for Freelance mode, or any kind of multiplayer really as this gives me incentive to actually recommend the game to friends and increases replayability. 

Diversifying AI behavior between the various factions, everyone in sight rushing at you makes sense for the rag tag corvids or glory seeking spacers, but not so much for the supposedly disciplined NEP.

Perhaps more districts or variations of the various districts so players are not stomping down the same streets over and over in free lance.

The inclusion of further customisation options for the player vehicle, perhaps color tweaks of some kind or vehicles with more than just two weapons slots.

Combat became monotonous after tutorial missions, hunting down objectives in a slow moving mech is about as engaging as watching paint dry. Every combat encounter I had so far was resolved by holding down left and right mouse while pointing vaguely in the direction of the enemy.

TLDR: MechMercenary Tycoon. Destructible urban instances in a well presented real time tactical topdown shooter with permanent unlockables. Audiovisually decent.

Campaign that doubles as a tutorial. In-game currency rewards towards an hybrid sim-mercenary menu minigame where you loadout your freelancers. Check out the acquisitions menu and get lore, contracts, items for squads and hire members. Destruction oriented rewards with kaiju style protagonist that towers over urban landscapes. Topdown shooter instances. 

Note: I hat to rebind mouse middle button to mouse scroll down for the powerup to activate otherwise no complaints.

Game requires use of crouching, the use of extended vision aiming to pan screen, as well as some use of positionning and ammo conservation.

Good PC resolutions support. Xbox360 pad working out of box. Game is being inserted at the outskirt of urban areas and being given objectives that must be accomplished. Ammo is a concern. You get paid for everything you destroy which is a nice touch. Difficulty seemed fairly easy. Low ammo means you often have to rely on brute force to make some money without expending ressources. 

Thankfully many tanks seem to feature ways to leverage the physics as a weapon. Additionally this enforces a more tactical oriented approach rather than holding fire and kiting which is a welcome change of pace.

The audiovisuals seem like they might disappoint at first but the fluid animation work and the physics gives everything a weight and an importance. The sound of the barrels of gatling spinning by in the headphones was subtle and psychologically satisfying. The gameplay loop is definitely there with a decent hook and the progression through the menus seem to have a lot to offer and be thematic.

Seems like the game would play better on wider resolutions as otherwise screen panning is introduced which adds additional keys and renders the action flow clunkier. I am not sure if this is a feature to accomodate for lower resolutions or if this scales with higher monitors and I would have to edit this after I tested.

Brigador is an isometric action game set in a 80's science fiction universe full of neon lights, hovertanks, and mechs.

The campaign lets you play through missions with set loadouts. It lasts about 9 hours and is pretty fun.

The ""arcade"" mode, Freelance, lets you choose one of several dozen vehicles including hardsuits, mechs of varying sizes, hovercraft, and tanks. You can then equip it with any two weapons that can fit in the vehicles mountings, as well as taking a unique power such as laucnhing smoke grenades or firing a massively powerful audio pulse.

Freelance will be the reason you come back to Brigador again and again. The different combinations you can create with each vehicle, pilot, weapon, and equipment make the game filled with potential. The small dev team also promises updates in the near future, but unfortunately, it's in Valve time.

Resumo:

Um título de muitas qualidades. Excelente arte, apresentação viva, cheia de cores e cercada de qualificada sonorização. Interessante mecânica de combate, talvez lenta demais para o gosto de alguns, mas bem implementada. Alguns problemas parecem ter restringido um tanto o público. Brigador é um jogo que não se compromete com narrativa, mas com a satisfação de um combate difícil em uma apresentação retrô. Mas não é um jogo para público diversificado e possui alguns problemas, além de um preço um tanto acima do que deveria ser.

Recomendo com desconto a partir de 50%.

-----------

Brigador é um ótimo jogo em diversos aspectos. Música é excelente, sonorização é muito boa. As cores vivas e o detalhamento do cenário em perspectiva isométrica dão ao jogo um visual retrô e tornam a ação bastante peculiar.

Há um modo história com uma grande quantidade de missões para as quais você tem entre 1 e 3 veículos disponíveis para fechar o cenário. Cada cenário demanda, basicamente, que o jogador destrua uma determinada quantidade de alvos específicos e depois saia do cenário.

Há uma boa variedade de Mechs, veículos e também pilotos (que possuem seus próprios atributos), ao lado de uma variedade de armas. Tudo pode ser destravado com pontos obtidos em modos arcade e campanha (uma espécie de tutorial). Cada veículo e arma funcionam bastante diferente uns dos outros, dando incrível relevância mecânica às escolhas do jogador.

O jogo possui uma tradução razoavelmente bem revisada para Português Brasileiro, mas não há muito para ser lido na parte da narrativa. Não que não haja texto, mas o texto é (também em versão original) desinteressante e pouco brilhante em relação ao visual.

Praticamente TUDO no cenário é destrutível, há boa quantidade de tipos diferentes de inimigos, mas nada que funcione como um BOSS ou chefão. Dificuldade está relacionada aos tipos de táticas que o jogador deve adotar para cada tipo de inimigo e de acordo com a quantidade e inimigos acumulados ao redor.

Você vai lembrar de todo e qualquer jogo do passado envolvendo mechs, veículos armados e filmes de ação dos anos 90. E isso é bastante para me deixar interessado, mas não é o suficiente para fazer uma recomendação a preço total.

Brigador não é bem um jogo para diversos públicos. Não é rápido nem simples o suficiente para quem gosta de twin stick shooters. O visual é cheio demais de detalhes que prejudicam a percepção visual necessária para um jogo de ação tática (especialmente quando você acumula inimigos e precisa ajustar distância de disparo). 

Você pode imaginar que sistema ideal para controle é um gamepad, mas o jogo parece ter sido feito principalmente com teclado e mouse em mente. O controle de distância da mira com uso dos sticks é ineficiente. É possível jogar com gamepad, mas melhor desempenho é obtido com teclado e mouse.

Uma excelente apresentação, mas com uma execução muito restritiva. O jogo pode não prender você depois da terceira hora. Você sentirá vontade de voltar a ele de vez em quando, mas não apenas a mecânica cansativa, como também o visual cheio parecem não ser apropriados para longas sessões.

Um bonito e interessante jogo. Mas que eu não posso recomendar a preço total... recomendo com desconto de 50% ou mais.",1508076323,1508076323,True,18,0,0.696447908878326416,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- Beautiful graphics with a completely destructable map.

- You can customize your mech/vehicle/hovercraft, and the options are good in freelance missions (I wish you could do 
   the same for campaign).

- The atmosphere is really good, the feeling of strength of the weapons is conveyed really well, all in all you feel like you 
   are operating  a huge mech or a vehicle. There is no loss of that feeling by it being an isometric shooter.

- Good controller support.

Cons:
- The campaign is not long but it was fun. There is lore but the story is practically non existent. Still fun.

- Weird cheap looking menus.

The campaign is not a campaign, is a huge tutorial. Skipt it and head to the core of the game:

FREELANCE MISSIONS:
The game felt too slow at maximum game speed, but even with the lighter vehicles it failed to deliver any kind of thrill, even in the middle of a battle. Why?
Because all you have to do is destroy 1 target by 1, therefore leeching on their shields, and you can keep soaking damage even with a light vehicle.
Therefore the game is too easy and you can steamroll the enemy.

Therefore all the mechanics about using flanking, EMP granades, smoke screens, cover mechanics and such are mostly garbage.

It's supposed to be as a stealth game because the objectives spread across a huge map (that is also boring to cross to gather them all).
Why would have that in a battle game? You could just steamroll the enemy and then gather the objectives in the (now) ghost city. There would be no reason to spread them! But you're supposed to sneak past their formations or at least try to flank them. But you won't. You'll just steamroll them and then spend 10 minutes to cross the entire city and gather them.

It is a stealth game because of the above: the campaign clearly hints on how you're supposed to ""Swat the enemy"": you're supposed to flank their formation, toss in a EMP granade, dinamic entry by diving trough a building with your fullspeed tank, and wipe out the enemy squad.
Problem is, nothing of that is necessary (and the tanks are either too slow or too light to pierce themselves trough buildings...)

Brigador only had very mild negatives, along with some very strong positives that makes it difficult for me to say anything bad about it

From an excellent soundtrack to the incredible gameplay, to the lore and graphics design, everything about Brigador appears to have been well made and shows great attention to detail. A gentle learning curve and a campaign that will teach you and then present you with ever increasing challenges followed with free play contracts that will let you go at the speed and difficulty you prefer means that you will always be able to customize your experience to tailor it to what you like and what you can handle. 
The maps are designed well and pretty to look at, with everything inside except for the map boundaries being fully destructible. You are even encouraged to do so, and destroying things gives you a bonus. 

A large selection of vehicles, weaponry and enemies ensures that there is a lot for you to choose from, with every piece of gear you pick having its use and using your gear well is usually the key to success. But with all that gear, you can pick and choose how you want to play. Stealth, guns blazing, or a mix is all possible with none of the weapons seeming overpowered or underpowered. And everything you see ingame is a thing you can take and use.

The only negative I've found was the control scheme, which doesn't always work well with every vehicle. But it is barely a negative as you can change your control scheme as needed. Out of all the things in game, everything works together amazingly well and handles great, both in the missions and with the overarching theme.

Brigador is one of those rare games where you do not regret any moment of your time playing it. Everything can be made to be the way you enjoy it the best while at the same time offering you challenges exactly the way you want them. It seems to do everything right and has no real negatives to it that I could find. Brigador tells you to enjoy yourself, and it gives you all the tools you need to do so.",1503306205,1503306254,True,10,0,0.63259810209274292,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Those games and their gameplay were some of my favorite on my Sega Genesis as a kid.  While Brigador isn’t exactly like those games, it gave me just enough of a nostalgia trip to really get in to it and enjoy it's hearty gameplay.

[h1]Who is your Brigador and what does he do?[/h1]

Brigador: Up-Armored Edition is an updated version of the original game released in June of 2016 after eight months in Early Access.  The re-released update dropped in June of 2017 and added some missions to the campaign, updated the graphics, and did some rebalancing.  I had the pleasure of playing both since I got the game just before this update.  I can say that it is more appealing now than it was before, though even with the balance changes there can be some rough difficulty spikes that you will come across.  The core of the gameplay in the campaign is relatively simple.  You’ll grab one of the next missions in the group you’ve unlocked (usually three or four at a time), perhaps read the gist of what you’ll be doing and why, select one of the four pre-established vehicles, and head in to blow up nearly everything in sight.  The vehicles come in a large variety.  There are tanks and wheeled vehicles, hovertanks, and bipedal mechs, all of which range in size from tiny you lose them on screen to fairly larger and slow to maneuver.  These are each outfitted with a unique loadout of weapons and abilities that can be better or worse suited for the type of missions you encounter.  However, the campaign is designed to have you replay missions as many times as you want and receive marks for beating it in each provided vehicle.  Going through it the first time I gravitated toward the larger and more heavily armed and armored vehicles in most situations because that’s the playstyle I like, however I could see how the faster and more stealthy vehicles could work very well too if you practiced with them.

Once in the mission, you’ll have a list of your objectives in the top corner and little else guiding you through except some icons along the edges of you screen indicating the direction of the objectives.  You can move through at your own pace on your own path, or just carve it out of the destructible level.  Vehicles and buildings will crumble and explode at the whim of your mouse clicks.  Enemies vary just as much as your choice in vehicles from small and super-fast to much larger than anything you can pilot and equally slow.  Their firepower can be just as diverse.  Dispatching them may take a sweep of your machine gun or have you running around dodging their shots as you pick them apart.  Objectives are simple at best, usually requiring you to either blow up certain buildings or special vehicles, or just wiping out 70% of the enemies on the map (and sometimes both).  However, the unique design of each map makes it much less repetitive than such a limited set of objectives would indicate.  Plus, the real challenge comes to the surface when you have to manage both the health of your vehicle along with its  ammo that runs out several times a mission, requiring you to salvage ammo pickups from not-completely-destroyed enemies or finding the handful of ammo depots with limited supply.  The raw carnage and combination of action and tactical efforts from the player really define the beginning and end of what makes Brigador so fun.

[h1]What else is going on?[/h1]

Well, there’s a metric ton of story lore in the game.  There’s a tiny bit presented in the campaign, but the majority is unlocked via the money that you earn for each mission.  This money has no effect on the campaign itself as far as I can tell, but you earn a great deal going through the missions.  You can spend it on unlocking tons of in-game content including vehicle and enemy descriptions, story elements of all sorts including information about the factions involved, freelance mission items that include vehicles, vehicle pilots with varying mission modifiers, and equipment for those vehicles.  This leaves a pretty robust amount of gameplay even after you finish the campaign that, if you wanted to complete fully with all vehicles would take many hours beyond the four-plus I used to run through it once each.  The lore and descriptions you can unlock weave a giant web of story content that is entirely optional to the player, but it seems to be something the developers put a lot of effort in to.  There’s even an audio book included with the Deluxe edition, which I think I received just for having the game before it re-released.  Also included in that Deluxe edition is a great soundtrack of perfectly crafted synthwave music that meshes with the explosive gameplay surprisingly well.  It’s very prominent, so if it’s not a type of music you’re in to, you’re going to have to turn it off entirely.  However, for me it was great and I left its pumping beats and 80s aesthetic going strong the whole way through.

[h1]So did anything suck?[/h1]

There were a few smaller issues and some larger ones that really had me drinking the rageahol.  The health system in Brigador has you maintaining both your standard health and a shield that can be recharged by enemy drops.  However, your normal health can’t be fixed by anything in a mission.  This isn’t a problem in most missions that are relatively short an simple, but some missions are a bit longer and any encounter with a lot of enemies can wear your non-reparable health down, making a small mistake force you to restart.  On top of that, shield drops disappear after a period.  This means that if you’re working with long range weapons or slow moving vehicles, a large firefight may have you missing out on the lifeblood you need to keep going.  Another small issue is that you have to learn about the environments in a bit of a trial by fire.  Some buildings will explode killing you instantly if you run into them or destroy them from too close.  It can be difficult to distinguish these and result in an unexpected and frustrating death.  They could easily be marked in an more obvious way, but they often blend in too well.  The most annoying thing I encountered was the difficulty spikes.  Some missions would be many times harder than missions before or after.  I played through one probably 15 or 20 times as it had you starting with no ammo and dodging insta-kill suicide enemies to get to the ammo depots.  In addition, the final optional campaign mission is significantly longer than previous ones and trying to maintain health during it is nearly impossible with what vehicles are supplied.  If this is the rebalanced version, I’d hate to have seen what some of these later missions were like before that.

[h1]Recommendation?[/h1]

This really is a good game and I would suggest getting it for $10 or less as it has been (and currently is on GOG) under that price.  While it may lack some of the things that I really enjoyed about those old Strike games, it does have some solid mechanics that the player can improve and master throughout the tons of replayability provided.  Fans of the whole ‘you against the world’ concept in games, where you’re mowing down enemies like a badass, will definitely find this appealing.

This is an isometric, tiled game which only has the destruction part of Blast Corps(n64).

So it has an old style to it, which seems to be appreciated by most.

The campaign has a nice, not annoying tutorial, which not only teaches you the dirty way but you get to keep all your earnings and spend it in freelance mode. I believe if you play the entire campaign, you can get enough dough to buy some of the best available. 

In freelance, you can buy a pilot, a vehicle, weapons and missions (and lore; intel but w/e)
Here's one of the brilliant part of the game.. The biggest, baddest vehicles are worth the least and the smallest, weakest vehicles are worth the most. Why? Because each vehicle has a payout modifier, wanna make it hard on yourself but earn three times more than anyone else? Use the tiniest vehicle. Wanna wreck havoc or get through a long and hard series of missions? Use a big bad vehicle and tear the place apart.

Pilots also get to have such modifiers but I first need to explain missions (Operations as they are called in-game).
Operations are basically a series of missions, smallest being a series of 2 but can get up to a whopping 39!
You have to be careful though, as your vehicle does not repair itself nor rearm itself between missions.
During each missions, you have a set of main objectives and a set of optional objectives (They're all about killing and destruction). You can end the current mission after completing at least one main objective, or you can stay and complete the level to gain more money. As you finish the entire operation, the money you've earned will be multiplied by some factors, such as the type of vehicle and pilot you've used.

And that brings us to the pilots. 
Here's what the pilot named ""Phil Bromlin"" has for stats:

Let's say you're playing an operation that has 5 districts(missions).
The difficulty and the payout multiplier will grow by 0.50 per district.
Meaning by the fifth mission, you'll be at 3 difficulty level and 2.6 of payout (since it's the max).

So you really want to buy better pilots and better operations, so you can make more money and eventually try to beat the hardest missions the game can throw at you.
There's 38 pilots to hire, 63 vehicles and 44 weapons to purchase.

Die Kampagne erscheint mir nur Beiwerk. In einiger Hinsicht zeigt das Spiel in meinen Augen gewisse Story/Atmosphäre-Schwächen: Es fehlt mir an Story, an Zwischensequenzen, an ""lebendiger"" Hintergrundwelt. Es spielt sich meiner Ansicht nach daher etwas ""blutleer"" bzw. ""trocken"". Auf der anderen Seite haben wir im Freelance-Modus schöne große Level in denen wir alles zu Klump und Asche ballern und stampfen können. Das macht Laune. Die Effekte sehen anständig aus, die Level mit den Gebäuden, Fahrzeugen und Zivilisten erinnern vage an den Klassiker Syndicate. Einige Punkte in dem Spiel finde ich übertrieben bzw. sinnlos wie die Auswertung mit der Zerstörung und den Opferzahlen. Die Standard-Steuerung mit Maus und Tastatur ist etwas krampfig, gerade bei Kettenfahrzeugen. Alles in allem ist Brigador ein ganz anständiges Geballer für Zwischendurch, das mir aber zu oberflächlich und zu schwach überzeugend in der Atmosphäre wirkt um über längeren Zeitraum viel Spass am Spiel zu haben.

Objectives are pretty straight forward, and how much stuff you blow up to accomplish them are totally up to you. There's loads of side objectives, always involving blowing more stuff up.

Honestly the only weakness I could find was that the games UI for purchasing new items, tanks, etc. is very rigid and a bit confusing when you first start out.

There's no denying the sound, art, writing come together as a cohesive whole. But as a piece of design, as a game meant to be played, it leaves a lot to be desired.

I played long enough to beat the campaign and to give the more open-ended Freelance mode a couple whirls, and I kept waiting for the game to hook me. I tried playing with the biggest mechs with the best weapons and destroying everything in sight. I tried playing with the smaller vehicles, ones that required more strategy and were more difficult. I tried completing every side objective on a map. I tried speed-running through them instead. Didn't matter. The game never felt compelling. It never felt more than a superficial, mildly entertaining romp through rectangular districts that mostly look the same.

There's a lot of design approaches a game can take to hook the player and while Brigador dabbles in some of them, none of them were implemented well enough to draw me in:

-A game can hook by providing interesting characters with character arcs (like the Telltale Games). There are no characters in Brigador and certainly no character arcs.

-A game can hook by providing an interesting plot / environment with mysteries to uncover (like Bioshock). The plot here is paper-thin. You get summaries before each mission, but they're only providing an explanation of the objectives. Basically you're a mercenary who blows stuff up because some text told you to. There's no sense of progress, no meaningful advancement of story.

-A game can hook by providing a meaningful challenge (like Dark Souls). Difficulty in Brigador is problematic, as it primarily comes from willfully choosing poor tools for the job. For example, in a given campaign map, you can choose a massive mech with double lasers that can take a lot of punishment or you can choose a tiny sniper mech that is easily destroyed. Some people enjoy this - and I think these people may appreciate the options Brigador provides. I do not. I love difficulty - but I love difficulty that the game provides, not that I must generate by willfully making poor choices or placing arbitrary restrictions on myself.

-A game can hook by providing stat / gear / unlock progression (like Diablo 3). Brigador's open-ended Freelance method provides an extensive list of things to unlock, including new weapons, mechs, & pilots. While the pilots represent difficulty options and don't otherwise affect gameplay, the weapons all felt unique and interesting, an excellent feat given how many there are. Unfortunately, the campaign has NO progression. For each map, you're provided a couple pre-made loadouts and that's that.

-A game can hook by providing exploratory elements, such as new environments, hidden collectibles, bigger and scarier opponents, etc. There is some variety in the level design - rural vs. junk city vs. regular city - but none of it ever really *pops.* Same with unit design. You do eventually encounter some larger mechs but it's genuinely kind of hard to tell the difference because the game is so dark and zoomed out. It desperately needed paint jobs, decals, etc on the mechs, to distinguish them from each other. Even the three factions are remarkably similar. Furthermore, there are no hidden collectibles, no secret bosses, none of that. In fact, there are no bosses at all, which seems a wasted opportunity.

Ultimately, the game isn't compelling. This is unfortunate as it clearly has some excellent elements. I personally would love to play a Brigador 2 that bothered to create a compelling story with interesting characters; with levels that had unique & clear design (rather than the randomly generated feel they all have now); with an intelligent progression from small mechs and weak weapons to large mechs and powerful weapons. Maybe even some multiplayer elements, like horde defense co-op, CTF, etc. That game would be frikkin awesome. Unfortunately, Brigador is not that game.",1500833640,1500833640,False,129,1,0.67302316427230835,12,False,False,False,False,,,

There's a fair bit of reading you can do if you're interested in the fluff, but that's entirely optional and the gameplay itself is very simply blowing someone/something up and then leaving the area.

The gameplay itself is excellent, the music and sound is great, and the artstyle is very well done.

The vehicles and weapons also have a significant amount of weight and oomph to them, which makes them feel very satisfying to use.

Repetition can happen after playing a while, however, there are significant amounts of missions, vehicles and weapons to keep this in check. Again, it's an isometric shooter, so I'm not sure if I should even bother bringing this up or not, but now you're aware of it if you weren't before.

The music does not seem to have any sort of playlist or loop, so what this means is that if you're taking your time in a mission you will hear one track play to the end from the start of the game and then play the rest of the level in silence, which is actually a bummer since the game has very nice music that adds to the experience.

Three massive points about it:

1.) You can completely customise the difficulty. Want to destroy everything with a giant mech with overpowered weapons? You can do that. Or you can take a medium mech and have to be more tactical. Or you can take a tiny antigrav tank and zip around. Or you can fight in a paper armoured battle suit. It's incredibly customisable.

2.)  The combat is simple, but incredibly fun. You only have 2 weapons and a special ability, but the massive amount of different weapon types means that every single round can play differently.

3.) Incredible value for money. For a single player game, you can sink hours and hours into it. Reminds me of the game FTL in that way, where you can just keep playing for ages. The difference is that this isn't a randomly generated campaign, you actually have a whole scripted campaign and another mode called Freelance that you can work through. With all the options, you could get a hundred hours out of this game easy.

Everything is destructable except for the outer walls, with weapons or by just crushing it underfoot. There's a variety of vehicles and weapons from different kinds of machine guns to heavy cannons to gauss rifles and lasers - even artillery, rockets and acid canisters. You can pilot (almost) every vehicle in the game including mechs, ground vehicles and antigravity vehicles.

At first I wasn't too impressed by Brigador - sure, the campaign missions were a bit fun if a little too challenging, but after getting through them all I just didn't feel like the game was worth it... Then I tried freelance and it was horribly boring because it was too easy -  I didn't understand how to buy things, pilot difficulty or how map progression worked. After buying a difficult pilot, some good gear/vehicles and a decently long (5) mapset I now totally get it and it's fun!

The customization is simple but kind of neat. All the weapons in the game have a class like ""heavy"" ""main"" ""turret"" or ""small"". Ammo used is independent of type. Every vehicle gets exactly two mounts of these kinds in addition to varying movement and durablility. So customization is a matter of: pick pilot - pick vehicle - pick 1st weapon - pick 2nd weapon - pick defensive system - go. It's very simple but with tons of different combinations, which I appreciate.

I can't resist comparing freelance mode to a roguelike even though it totally isn't one. You have to complete at least one objective on every map before you can exit to the next one. Your health and ammo carry over. Eventually you can extract at the spaceport, and you only get a good payout if you survive. So there's a (short) permadeath aspect as well as a resource management and risk/reward to consider.

Well I suppose I should actually say something about the game.

Apparently there is a story mode, i think i played that for a bit but when i found freelance mode i had a good laugh about the campaign and decided to stop being daft and just kill shit, but I did enjoy it.

The Premise of freelance is, how much shit do you want to break, and how mad do you want these guys to be about it.

From here the rogue elements are presented as scaling dificultys, loadout based combat, and the ever so important factor no matter how superficial, it has charm by the barrel.

You walk around in your mech, tank, or antigrav vehicle and destroy the marked objectives in the map, and you have two weapons and an active ability. In Campign mode, these are chosen for you, but you can choose your own loadout in Freelance mode. Different weapons behave differently against buildings, enemy shields and hull, and different vehicles behave differently to enemy fire and terrain types. This gives the player some things to consider both when choosing their loadout or making tactical decissions in battle. The game is more tactical than anything, since choosing in what order you deal with enemies, how you position yourself, and when you use your active ability is more important to survival than how you use your weapons. Weapons, however, do behave differently mechanically, some weapons have travel speed and others are more of ""hitscan"" weapons, most shoot in a straight line down to the ground, but others fire like a shotgun spread, or even high-arch projectiles.
6/10 - Good

== AESTHETICS (The audiovisual presentation of the game) ==
If you've heard about this game before, you must have heard about the soundtrack. Have the studio chosen some usual orchestral or rock music, the game could've felt cheap and uninteresting. The original synthwave soundtrack by one of the best artists in the genere, Makeup and Vanity Set (and some others since the Up-Armored update) ultimately gives the game a unique ambient and soul. The graphics are a love letter to 90s to early 2000s isometric sci-fi games. The player and enemy vehicles are 2D sprites with 64 different angles pre-rendered from 3D models with normal maps cooked in for interaction with the game's lighting effects, which give the finishing touch to the cyberpunk setting of the game. The game easily runs at 60FPS, but the pre-made animations for mechs and enemies have a very low ammount of frames. This deliberate choice, along with the semi-uncanny valley illustrations for pilot portraits, give off a very classic and somewhat unsettling feeling to the game, similar to some of Scott Cawthon's (creator of FNAF) earlier works (see: The Desolate Hope).
10/10 - Masterpiece

== CHALLENGE (The thought put into the challenges the game gives to the player) ==
The game gives a lot of opportunity for the player to tweak the difficulty of the game. First, the game speed setting: the player is allowed to change the speed of both themselves and the enemies (from 50% to 100% speed, set to 80% by default). Then there's the pilots: as the player progresses, they can unlock new pilots, and each of them is essentially a different combination of payout and difficulty modifiers, form one that makes it so that no enemies will ever spawn to get only a tenth of the pay, to pilots locked into the highest difficulties at all times in exchange for some big buck, even ones that will start at a low difficulty and gradually increase for each sector cleared, a sector being one of the different levels in each mission. Loadout choice also goes into play: some weapons have a low ammo capacity but deal very high damage (like lasers and explosives), others have a high ammo capacity and high fire rate in exchange for low damage per bullet (like gatling guns and turret guns), which can make ammo management (a very important part of the game) easier. Finally there's vehicle choice: bigger vehicles are louder, but more resilient, while smaller ones are more silent, but fragile. Each vehicle has a different combination of factors to consider: movement speed, movement acceleration, aiming speed, turning speed, hull, shields, temporary shields (an extra shield that fades out over time), etc. Some vehicles are even at a direct disadvantage to others or pose a higher risk to the player, but compensate it by giving an extra payout when the mission is done. It's a big mish-mash of ways to tweak the game to your liking.

-Combat is satisfying
-There is customization

Cons:
-combat starts to get stale/tedious after a few hours.
-customization is only available in freelance mode, less than half the length of the main storyline.
-maybe i need to practice, but small, light mechs just kind of generally suck. Going up against large clusters of enemies is nigh impossible
-visuals and soundtrack are really not that impressive. Feels like a sega genesis game.
-repetitive missions. Destroy this structure. Kill this target. Rinse, repeat.
-lore must be purchased with in game currency. It is not really a part of the campaign. This forces me to buy weapons/mechs or lore that consists of text files. The choice is clear for me.
-the mission briefings literally do not make sense. I guess they expect us to read the lore that must be purchased beforehand.

优点：
* 操作容易上手，典型的双摇杆射击游戏。不过与普通双摇杆射击游戏的区别是加了射击线与弹着点。感觉还是挺配机甲的。
* 拆城实在太爽了啊，各种碎片满天飞。

缺点：
* 目前看到的机甲都太丑了。。。
* 武器类型还是有点单一，都是扫射。
* 机甲不可定制。。。作为机甲控，定制机甲才是实际游戏内容啊！
* 机甲还是轻飘飘的，没有厚重的感觉，不过作为射击游戏，为了服务于爽快感也能够理解。

I came to the game with the expectation of giant stompy robots, but it ended up being a general vehicular mayhem simulator of the highest degree. A large campaign acts as a delivery mechanism for training and challenge missions, but the Freelance mode offers you large, open-ended ""runs"" to test your mettle with whatever configurations you can cook up, and is arguably the more compelling game mode once you have the basics down.

It's a skill-based game - weapons have distinct firing arcs based on their properties and where they're mounted on your vehicle as well as different colour-coded ammo types, and vehicle facing is important to mitigate how much damage you take. The controls are nonetheless simple enough to get the hang of with a bit of training, but learning to operate vehicles with finesse will take time and practice (which is exactly what I'm looking for in this sort of game).

Special note of the fact that once you're on a map, the game lets go of your hand and you're on your own. Brigador presents your objectives, and its up to you *how* you complete them, or whether you can complete them at all. Several side-objectives let you influence the map in interesting ways too (as well as earning more filthy lucre). Coming up with priorities for what objectives you can actually afford to complete (or end up HAVING to complete due to your actions) lends a nice layer of strategy to what would otherwise be frivolous stompenshoot. The fact that you can destroy literally anything on the map to carve your own path through is not only fun, but useful given the open-ended nature of the maps.

Two minor complaints would be that it's not always terribly clear when you're taking damage or where from, and your firing arcs don't indicate when they're obstructed by terrain, meaning that you may inadvertently waste a lot of ammo demolishing walls instead of your foes. It's also not always clear which Freelance runs you've previously completed. These are minor issues, though, and don't overwhelmingly detract from the game.

If any of this sounds appealing, buy this game.",1498984779,1498984929,True,6,0,0.614490151405334473,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a really good game that needs more attention because it's just ass-rippingly awesome. It has great atmoshpere, thanks to the amazing soundtrack (which comes included in the Up-Armored Edition, highly recommended if you're into John Carpenter's music), the cyberpunkish theme, story and the presentation in general (the naming of things like vehicles and weapons and the story together are just fucking cool). 
The controls are tight, there's tons and tons of variability of the difficulty and the gameplay, thanks to different pilots, vehicles and weapons that you can unlock. It's worth mentioning that the game also has all the options to need to customize the way you want it to play, going as far as different settings for different kind of types of vehicles, setting the game's speed and support for controllers. There's plenty of content to support the customizability, there's different types of weapons, vehicles and many-many levels to try out. You can also randomize your loadout. For example, you can get a giant heavy mech with a big ass artillery gun that levels whole city blocks with a single shot or get a tiny hoverbike that you can use to zip around the enemy if you're crazy enough.
Speaking of trying stuff out, the campaign is a must play and not just because the first couple of levels are the tutorials about the game's mechanics. It ramps up nicely and introduces new stuff step-by-step and most importantly after the tutorial levels end, you have the ability to choose from 3 or 4 types of predefined vehicles to play the levels through, which helped me to discover fun combinations to play with in freelance mode.
And the freelance mode is where it gets a bit weak for me, but only because I dislike rougelikes. In both the campaign and freelance mode you play to earn more money to unlock more weapons, vehicles, pilots, levels and some lore about units and other stuff. So you do the same objectives over and over again on the levels to earn money to do it all over again, now with the stuff you unlocked. As I mention before there are tons and tons of stuff to unlock and the customizability of those unlocked stuff is more than you would ever want, the core gameplay is still the same. Enter the level, accomplish the same objectives by blowing them up and then exit the level. As much as I dislike rougelites (rougelikes even more), for me the presentation of the game made up for the repetitive natur of the game. For me it's really fun to play the game for a couple of levels and to just blow shit up.",1498917332,1498917332,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, it is so much more beautiful than any of those games ever were. Just looking at the environments and mechs is a treat for me. There's some nice lighting that doesn't really affect gameplay, but it sure sets the right mood and has some nice light/dark contrasts. In addition, the game doesn't stutter for no reason like I've found some other smaller titles tend to do. 

Everything is destructible! Well, except for the level bounds. But everything can be reduced to a pile of rubble, and some vehicles can even use it as cover. (This surprised me.) This allows for some pretty interesting tactics, such as giant mechs crouching down to gain more protection and tiny mechs extending upwards to fire over things. You can have some ace pilot moments if you're getting swamped by enemies in urban areas, as every object has verticality and can block enemy line of sight on you, allowing you to flank a blob of enemies. (Or you can just shoot them through a high-rise with a railgun.)

Controls can feel slightly unresponsive, depending on which vehicles you're using, but it's a system to be mastered. Some vehicles move faster, have better turn radii, but when you get used to the slower ones, it's an absolute joy to perfectly swing your Abbot cannon around and peg an AGRAV zipping around you.

The soundtrack is about 50% of what's great about this game. The quality of the music can really make or break movies and games. Brigador's soundtrack makes the game. 

The only true complaint I have is that most of the pilot portraits are fugly. I never realized so many mercenaries were related to potatoes. Some of the potraits look a little off, can't quite put my finger on why.

Overall, I think this game is going to go down as a classic and I hope that Stellar Jockeys goes on to create more games matching this one's caliber.

Specifically, Brigador rewards thought and care in how you tackle combat situations, and is harsh in how it treats just walking in the front door--guns blazing. You'll however find that you never fail due to some inherint unfairness. When you lose, it's directly attributable to a mistake you made.

Of course, if you do find the game too hard or easy, it's endlessly tailorable in Freelance mode. Not only does Freelance add an enormous amount of content past the main campaign, it gives you a wide berth in choosing your preferred play-style.

Adquirí Brigador en un Humble Bundle mensual. Unos días después de añadirlo a mi librería, empecé a notar más titulares que hablaban del juego, de sus desarrolladores y el cambio de su suerte. Según la historia, Brigador es un proyecto que se negó a la tentación del kickstarter y después de varios años de desarrollo, logró la mayoría de sus propósitos; creo que el equipo de Stellar Jockeys hizo bien y que fueron sensatos, cautelosos, porque si no luego pasan cosas extrañas como con Chroma Squad.

Sin embargo, no lo niego, la apuesta fue demasiado arriesgada. Supongo que todavía lo es. Pocos juegos tienen desarrollos tan aventurados y felices como este.

Brigador es un juego de sprites isométrico donde rentas a tu piloto a una organización anarquista y manejas mechas, vehículos y tanques para destruir las ciudades de un gobierno autoritario. Hay una historia ahí, pero se construye a base de pocas certezas, bastantes rumores, sin dejar descansar al humor negro y la ironía, lo cual, personalmente, me parece un deleite. La mayoría de los pilotos son mercenarios y tiene un trasfondo entre trágico y cínico.

Estos pequeños fragmentos de historia van acorde con el entorno cyberpunk del juego y engalanan, dan una profundidad sabrosísima, a las ilustraciones de los pilotos (quienes asombran y hacen reír, o sonreír, porque mis preferidos son los que parecen luchadores de bar, aquellos que beben una chelita de más y malacopean para pronto entrarle a los madrazos). Al juego lo acompaña música de sintetizadores muy ochentera; ¿estamos cansados de este renacimiento de los ochenta el cual parece no tiene llenadera? Para nada, Brigador lo hace muy bien.

En cuanto al juego, puedes usar mouse y teclado o gamepad. Sospecho que el mouse y teclado son mejores, o más prácticos, para Brigador pero eventualmente logré configurar mi dual shock 4 para jugarlo cómodamente (importante: tienes que moverle a la configuración hasta que quede, si no, te frustrarás mucho).

Hay tres tipos de vehículos y cada uno tiene diversas opciones a configurar (armas y especiales): los mechas, automóviles y tanques, dependiendo de su tamaño y su movilidad, son más robustos o más ágiles, o quizás son tan débiles que son especiales para situaciones de sigilo y demandan juegos mejor planeados y estratégicos. Los desarrolladores no escatimaron recursos para probar diferentes tipos de vehículos y complacer a jugadores de distintos estilos de juego. Hay un modo campaña el cuál es de pilotos fijos y tiene entre tres o cuatro dificultades (o modos de juego, dependiendo), o bien, puedes jugar al freelancer y armar una serie de mapas continuos para probar una configuración personal y ver hasta dónde puedes llegar antes de morir o de llevarte el botín gordo.

El modo Freelancer es donde brilla el juego y donde pasarás más tiempo. En ambos modos, tanto la campaña como en el freelancing, los pilotos ganan y acumulan dinero que utilizarás para comprar más opciones: mapas, vehículos, pilotos, fragmentos de la historia o estrategias (un bestiario con los vehículos y las cosas que destruyes). Cada cosa, según la configuras, modifica este modo de juego. Los mapas, por ejemplo, entre más dinero inviertes en ellos, abren más zonas y secuencias a visitar. Los pilotos y los vehículos modifican la dificultad del mapa por cada zona vencida además de alterar el multiplicador de dinero. Por supuesto, puedes configurar este modo para escoger todos los atributos del azar y que esto sea una sorpresa o bien, puedes buscar y perfeccionar a tu Brigador con una configuración que te permita pasar las zonas más altas. Hay tantas combinaciones posibles que hay Brigador para rato.

Ojo: algunos vehículos, claro, están diseñados para ser verdaderas máquinas de la muerte, no sólo para los habitantes de Solo Nobre (el planeta que estás liberando) pero también para los propios pilotos. Entre más difícil de manejar sean los vehículos, más altos son los multiplicadores de dinero.

El diseño del juego me recuerda, brevemente, a un juego isométrico que jugué alguna vez: Syndicate. O quizás el primerísimo de los príncipes de Persia. Sí, bueno, pero actualizado a una calidad de 1080p. Las animaciones son fluidas, demasiado bien cuidadas, se nota un trabajo obsesivo, artístico. Reconocerás un placer extraño en apreciar los movimientos de los pequeños hombrecillo de gabardina amarilla a los que aplastas. Es palpable el esfuerzo por dar profundidad y diseño a los vehículos y sus texturas. Los escenarios y edificios recuerdan a los settings de otras obras cyberpunk o distópicas como Blade Runner, Akira o Max Headroom. Pero no sólo hay parques industriales, sucios, pero también hay suburbios y zonas de cultivo que contrastan perfectamente con lo anteriormente mencionado. De los retratos de los pilotos ya hablé antes, pero el realismo con el que están diseñados además de sus historias breves logran conectar con el jugador de la mejor manera: permiten que uno  complete los puntos e intuya las historias.

Lamentablemente el juego no tiene multijugador. Pero es perfecto en un sólo jugador para destruir ciudades en breves ráfagas casuales (de 20 a 30 minutos) o en largas sesiones de juego.

¿Lo recomiendo? Sí. Brigador es destrucción masiva con un diseño neón y retro. Sus modos de juego mantendrán despiertos a los luchadores y a los apostadores por igual.

Don't expect a story line other than basic stuff to tell you what to do. You do missions, you get paid. You buy equipment. You do longer missions.

PROs:

Awesome 80's retro wave soundtrack
Awesome strategic mech/tank warfare gameplay with lots of combinations and approaches
Awesome isometric 3D/Pixel style art & graphics
Awesome action
Fast to play
Replayable
Challenging

CONs:

No story really; the campaign just teaches you how to play basically and earn money
Slightly slow load times between missions
No multiplayer

Worth it? Sure, if you like challenging strategy war games and tank battles. There is no perfect build or combination, it's all about how you like to do things, your strategy and how you approach the missions.

This is not for someone looking for a deep story line, meaningful missions, characters and dialog. This game is full of text and fluff but its in the Lore section and you play to unlock it and read about the background of the game. There is a minor story, it can be interesting, but it's not deep and not much to it. So understand this from the front. There are not movie sequences and endings. This is a non-stop mech/tank action strategy war game.

But that's not a bad thing.

Brigador brings back a style of isometric action games that we've not really seen in some time. If you've ever played the ""strike"" series (Desert Strike, Nuclear Strike and so on), or the slightly more obscure ""Mass Destruction"", you know roughly what type of game it is. You're unleashed on the world in a heavily armed vehicle, and your goal is to destroy things. Brigador is not a clone of those mentioned games though, and in most ways, it's a better game. If nothing else, it's a lot faster, and has more going on at all time.  
  
[B]Graphics & Sound[/B] 
The graphics in Brigador is clean, sharp & detailed. While not as technically advanced as many other modern games, Brigador does still look darn good, owing to a strong consistent art style. The screenshots are representative, that is what the game looks like. And while they might look a bit cluttered, it's usually not too hard to figure out what's going on on screen at any given moment. And yes, those are coloured lights that would make a late 90's 3D action game, like Forsaken, green with envy. Unlike those late 90's games, the use of coloured light does not end up feeling tacky though, it works.

Brigador is no slouch in the audio department either. The soundtrack fits well in with the 80's/early 90's style cyberpunk feel that the game has, and helps set the mood. All weapons have suitable sound effects that make them feel like they have some weight behind them, without feeling overbearing and obnoxious. Audio feedback is very important in a game like Brigador, and it nails it. 

[B]Gameplay[/B]
You're playing as an armoured vehicle, be it a tank, mech or some other vehicle outfitted with heavy weapons. And your goal is to cause as much destruction as you possibly can. Each level has its own set of objectives, that usually boil down to ""kill X, Destroy Y, then escape"", with secondary objectives that are similar in nature. It's all very straight forward, and the game does not really stray from this formula. Depending on if you're playing the campaign, or just randomly generated maps, you either have a set of 3-4 different vehicles to chose from, or you get to design your own from parts that you've unlocked. 
Exactly how you play will depend on your vehicle. Some are light and nippy, and need to always be on the move to avoid incoming projectiles, others are lumbering behemoths that can take a beating. And there's also a good variety in the weapons, with things like mortars, machine guns, heavy cannons, shotguns and so on making up the arsenal. So despite the games rather straight forward gameplay, the variety in playstyles between vehicles still make the game feel like it has a lot of variety. 
The game encourages you to play aggressively in most cases. Collateral damage is not just not punished, but even encouraged, as you'll get greater rewards the more things you end up destroying along the way. And destroying things in Brigador feels far more satisfying than it has any right to do. 

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
Brigador is a great game. It's easy to pick up and play, and it's just darn fun. It might not be the deepest game on the market, but few games I've played match the sheer amount of fun I've had with Brigador. It's going to be one of those games that will stay on my HDD for a long time, and whenever I just feel like blowing stuff up, I'll start Brigador. So for anyone who's looking for a straight forward action game, I can't recommend Brigador enough.

These are all very positive things. From the get go it has an immediate personality in it's presentation that will suck you in, and the carnal combat within will get you hooked. 

So let's break it down.

PROS:
-----------------------------------------------
- Great visuals, unique presentation
- A loving amount of detail has gone into desiging the weird and wild technological machines at your disposal, from the actual visual designs to the variety of weapons and their functions, stats and even flavortext herein. If you like customizing a mech not unlike armored core or such, you're gonna have fun with this.
- Gleeful amount of destructibility in all maps. The world is your sandbox to topple over and stomp.
- Great soundtrack. I'll admit I'm not as into the overt 80's synth stuff as some people, but if you like that kind of music, this is grade A material for you up with the likes of Hotline Miami. 
-Surprisingly fleshed out world building in the descriptions of pilots, locations, weapons, mechs, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking in it's own right, but it provides quite a bit of grim flavoring to what is, at first glance, a seemingly simple game. 


CONS:
-----------------------------------------
-Loadtimes are juuust long enough and the actual missions juuust short enough to give some noticable speedbumps to what is otherwise a fast and addictive game. 

- The weapon trajectory beams and targeting reticule UI. They manage to do a lot with it that helps feed you immediate information on potential targets. However, the trajectory beams are so bright and colorful they wind up distracting you from the actual targeting reticule, making aiming a slapdash process in the middle of a raging firefight. It's something that I think ought to be tweaked, and a minor inconvience overall- nothing game breaking. 


TL;DR :
-------------------------------------------
Can't reccomend it to everyone, but if you love mechs, mayhem, or just enjoy some of that garish neon 80s dystopia, this is a fun distraction that deserves a bit more recognition.",1498363889,1514309993,True,1,1,0.483870983123779297,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay is smooth and diverse.  Want to be an unstoppable killing machine? Go ahead, play a giant stack of cars with tracks under it that can be equiped with two anti-everything cannons.  Want to outsmart your opponents and be sneaky? Play a Tuktuk and go on a stealth operation where a single hit means the end of it all.  Want to joust large tanks with a short-ranged high damage weapon? I found the Tuktuk works for that too.  If you want to be more classy, go for the flying oldtimer instead.  Want to bulldoze through your enemies? Well... you can do that.  Want to stomp out enemies with a mech? You can do it.  My greatest issue would be that the description of the Treehouse promised me loud horns and the Keybind screen even offers a key to sound the horn but I can't hear it at all. I want to honk at them, damnit.

I also really like that the story is seperated from the actual gameplay, so it doesn't interject and slow down what I am doing.

Just isn't that engaging of a game the story stinks, the controls can be clunky it's a bit of a grind unless you already tested everything out, you dont even know what you are purchasing you just have to hope it's a vehicle you end up liking or weapons that do what you hope it will do, why you have this stuff blocked until after you buy it seems pretty stupid, it's like buying a car before testing it out.",1498282928,1498282928,False,3,3,0.257632315158843994,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A very unique game! Isometric but not really 2D as you can shoot over scenery and even enemies. Each of your guns has a firing arc that fades out just short of where it will hit leaving the last bit to you. Each gun also has its own projectile speed so if you are moving and turning your arcs will cross and shift often landing far from each other. Imagine a two gun FPS with separate reticules that shift and change predictably based on your movement. I've never played anything like it.

It is a kind of stealth action hybrid. For instance you could be in direct combat with one enemy while maneuvering around scenery to keep another from seeing you. Each weapon has a distinct report and impact sound volume that will alert enemies which you should always use to your advantage. EVERYTHING is destructible so you can make a noise at the end of the block and then double around crashing through the buildings to get behind the distracted enemies.

Customization is huge. With a healthy amount of Mech, Tank, and Grav chasis to unlock. There are also a ton of weapons and equipment pieces  that you can buy to make a vehicle that matches the playstyle you prefer.

Pure intense mayhem. Brigador is an excellent isometric vehicular shooting game that brings the genre back, it is very similar to Bedlam and Bedlam 2: Absolute Bedlam from the '90s, and if those aren't familiar then let's say it's like the original Syndicate, but with mechs, tanks and hovercars.

A wide variety of freelance missions, that you can take on with a wide variety of destructive weaponry custom picked onto your vehicle of choice. Campaign missions are where you can try out a lot of pre-made vehicles with drivers that have their own styles of approaching the battlefield.

Gameplay is straight to the point, move through the destructible environments, the more you destroy the better, engage enemies either directly at the range of your weaponry, or use special abilities and equipment to flank them via stealth, there's a nice amount of playstyle variance. You and the enemies have more armor in the front, so flanking is good and so is keeping the enemy from flanking you. A bunch of different control schemes for you to find the most suitable, be it with keyboard+mouse or with a controller. You can also freely change the game speed to anywhere between 50% to 100%, so that acts as a difficulty slider, or simply putting the tempo of the action to what you find most comfortable. A neat feature.

There's a lot to love in this game, the only thing missing is a multiplayer mode, this would be an absolute blast with at least a 2-player co-op mode. Maybe if there's a sequel we'll get that.

There is no upgrade path ( like more ammo or damage for the weapons you like, no upgrades to character or mech ) and the money you earn you can spend on stuff that there is no way of using.

This is the type of game I would have loved as a kid, and I found myself engaged and intrigued by it playing it now. I have always loved mech games, and this game manages to brilliantly avoid the ""same-iness"" of some mech games by creating three distinct classes of mechs, mech, tank, hovercraft. The game does a great job in creating a sense of weight to your mechs, allowing you to crush a hilarious number of cars and civilians in early stages before introducing you to the mech vs mech combat that is the core of the gameplay. 
 
Unlike many indie games that have some novelty but no real depth in gameplay, or too much depth and no sense of novelty, this game brings you in softly and makes it feel like you are getting a better sense of the combat in the game without getting overwhelmed. 
 
NOTE: I found the game MUCH more enjoyable after remapping a few keys. While the game does support controller, I could not find settings that would let the right analog aim in the right position quickly enough.

I'd like to call it a tactical isometric roguelike shoot'em up. While you control a single vehicle it kind of reminds me of Syndicate. Everything is destructible and this also plays into how you tackle opponents.

There are basically two modes; campaign and freelance. I haven't finished the whole campaign yet but missions so far have been varied and sometimes challenging. After the tutorial you can choose between three differents characters/vehicles which makes a large difference in many missions. The mission briefings also add background and builds up the dystopically satiric world of Solo Nombre through decent writing.

Freelance is the other mode which pretty much offers infinite replayability. There are a tons of unlockable weapons, missions, pilots and vehicles. These are unlocked by clearing either freelance or campaign missions for cash.

What makes the game actually great though is the actual gameplay and I find it hard to come up with anything to complain about. Controls are crisp, and vehicles actually handles very differently. Most weapons are immensely satisfying to use with great SFX and animations, and different loadouts excel at different tactics. Tying in to this is the destructible environments. Instead of rushing the enemy straight on you could for example make your own path, come in from behind and make a killshot to their vulnerable rear. You can also use smoke or cloaking to avoid enemies or combine it all with luring enemies with sound to set a trap.

When it comes to the art style I like it a lot. I would say it reminds me of old Amiga sci-fi/cyberpunk games. Pilot portraits are great with a zany quality and vehicle design is overall very good. The environments look like dystopian cyberpunk environments and serve their purpose of being levelled to the ground.

In closing I'd say that this game is a real little gem. It's perfect for picking up and playing for a short while if you feel that shooting itch most of us feel from time to time, but it also works for longer sessions, some of the freelance campaigns can take a couple of hours and you can't save in the middle of them which is a small negative.

Zwar sehe ich das Potential, welches das Spiel haben könnte. Aber durch die extrem einfache Präsentation habe ich keine Motivation mich bis dahin vorzukämpfen. Ein Koopmodus hätte hier für Ablenkung sorgen können.

Every bit of story and equipment is lovingly crafted with an eye for detail. I never thought I'd see gun porn in a giant robot game, but Brigador really surprised me.

The game allows you to commit war crimes with a wide variety of weapons, from radiation beams to poison gas, as well as conventional machineguns, autocannons, laser guns, cannons, mortars, howitzers, and much more. There's even a cluster bomb launcher for when you really need to level everything for five or six city blocks.

Also, the freelance mode lets you choose your own difficulty; you can choose one of around 40 vehicles and dozens of pilots to customize your play experience, then do one of many different runs of varying lengths. You can even adjust the game speed if you're having trouble with the fast pace.

Additionally, the controls have been made more user-friendly, though the original control scheme is still available for those who prefer it.

Destroying things have never been so satistfying (and oh so rewarding). Everything inside the playable area is destructible in some way. Laying waste to properties, committing war crimes with various vehicles is totally awesome.

I want to disagree on complaints made about the maneuvrability and/or controls of the mecha suit and the tank being a little quirky or a bitch to handle (AGRAV being the easiest one to control). Flanking has it's purpose or in some cases shielding or going stealthy to outflank your enemies has it's purpose. The game has its charm and makes you switch up your play style in different campaign scenarios or freelance missions - or play any way you see fit with whatever suits you. All the rigs available have different stats and there is plenty of fun to be had. 

What I enjoyed is the setting. The whole retro/cyberpunk theme in a dystopian planet somewhere in the future plus the general lore is awesome. The overall replayability of this game is high, so there's always a chance to return to the game if you get tired of playing it for a while. 
 
The music will get tiresome after a while, and is lacking a bit in that department for my taste. If it had something like Hotline Miami had music wise with the hard-hitting beats on each level, that would have spiced up the game a little extra.
Also theres a lack of higher difficulty settings and sometimes it can get a bit tedious if you have a standard setup that you enjoy.

It builds a surprisingly rich fleshed out world with a lot of depth, in that early 90's cyberpunk outrun style we all know and love. It feels like there could be a series of movies and books exploring this intriguing place called Solo Nombre.  It's all very believable and morally ambiguous, centering the story around a power vacuum caused by the recently killed dictator of a space colony. It looks and feels very nice and the minature buildings and tiny neon signs are beautifully detailed. 

The missions are short, simple, and focused, usually the game gives you one or two objectives and drops you into an area in which you can carve a trail of horrific destruction as you blow the bejeezus out of enemy vehicles and massacre the tiny ground troops unlucky enough to get in your way. You'll get a lot of bang for your buck as there are quite a lot of missions and environments to progress through and at least 3 game modes to choose from. 

Everything can be destroyed and nothing is safe from your wrath. There's a big variety of vehicles to choose from, all with different strengths and weaknesses. Some are slick high tech walking mechs, some are tanks made of scrap metal, some are just motorbikes or buses with guns welded to them. All are brutally destructive.

-First the UI is by far the worst user friendly I have ever seen, which means it simply needs to be redesigned, in order  the user can understand what to do.Especially there is a thing with the buttons.Instead having plain straightforward captions like 'buy' they use confusing words like 'requisition'.Also they are placed in areas onscreen that few will pay attention to.All in all, the player does not understand what they do, nor what order does he have to use the options in the menu in order to do what he wants, like buy guns, pilots, customize the mech/vehicle and so on.  

-Second thing is info management.While the game goes extensively on and on about the mission, or the pilot bio, or the lore, and all unecessary blabbing, it has no map of the level at all.This is critical, since the game is MISSION based...Moreover, it has scarce info on the weapons (that matter, 'which gun should I buy next?'), only graphs that make little sense.The enemy info has to be purchased with money won during missions.Why should anyone ingame have to pay for such a thing is beyond my comprehension.

The game encourages you to constantly gage how much challenge you're willing or able to take on and then always raise the stakes a little higher for greater reward. For instances, your choice of operator determines the starting difficulty and how it ramps up, while your vehicle determines the amount of firepower you can level at said challenge: more expensive operators face greater challenges for more rewards, while more expensive vehicles are substantially weaker and less durable but also grant better reward multipliers. This contrasts with other games that make you work to get the most powerful equipment; in this game, you get some of the most powerful things for free by default, and the rest are quite cheap. If you want to drive what is basically the Tuk Tuk from Just Cause 2, however, that'll run you a price so steep that it's 4x more than next most expensive vehicle, but it'll give you a 10x payout multiplier!

The number of completable objectives on each map is much greater than what you need to move on (and they can have good or dangerous consequences if you complete them), and you can often jump to the final payout mission well before completing all of the maps leading up to it. Every single object that breaks or person that dies adds to your paycheck, but you have to manage your ammo stores and your time may be worth more if spent on the objectives.

This creates a subtle ingraining of Brigador morality: Whatever it takes to get paid and get off world is paramount. You will be financially compensated for stomping on innocents, ramming through slums, and collateral damage, but you will probably find that it's not worth your time to go out of your way to do so. Civilians are worth so little to kill that shooting them on purpose may feel like a waste of resources. So, when you DO go out of your way to destroy the lives of the little people, there can be no room for doubt that you act as perversely as the Auditer or greedily beyond all reason.

Speaking of, the lore in this game is so good. Spacers in particular are genuinely unsettling in creative ways: their mechs are clearly backwards and all of their vehicles sport full-yellow paint jobs (the lore says that yellow on Solo Nobre is associated with peaceful surrender and that wearing it while fighting is utmost sacrilege; I wonder if the Spacers are even aware of that) but with bullseyes on the cockpits (which, again, appear to be on the wrong side of the mech). The aforementioned Auditer is merely the operator you can use to tour each map without worrying about hostile forces, but the lore makes an impressive effort turning him into an unusual and almost horrifying character.

If you do try to use a controller, definitely slow the game speed down. The aiming controls are much better suited to a mouse than a joypad, so a lower speed will give you some extra time to adjust the angle of elevation of your shots. For keyboard and mouse, I use Relative Controls for mechs/tanks but Screen Absolute for agravs (I may switch to Top Right Absolute but I have yet to try it).",1497240319,1497240319,True,7,0,0.60639190673828125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't tend to see games in my library and immediately go ""Yea, let's play that!""

Brigador has managed to not just be a game I play. Within two hours, it's managed to be a game I'll sometimes click on while paging through my list, and immediately boot up.

Graphically, this feels like looking at a 90s game, but you know how when you don't watch or play or read something for a long time, you come back and it really shows it's age? Brigador feels like a very old game that has somehow managed to dodge that effect. In a world of low-poly 3d and ""8-Bit"" in name only, this striks a very odd balance that I absolutely adore.

Lore-wise I'm very fond of what they do. Every vehicle, weapon, enemy profile, and article has a small chunk of lore, usually under a paragraph. I feel it fits the game's atmosphere, a mercenary isn't going to know much beyond their objectives unless the actively dig for data.

While I do love this game, it's not perfect, and the gameplay is where I actually have a few complaints. Mechs and tanks control fine, but inexplicably Agravs- armed hovercraft available to pilots- drive incredibly poorly on my machine. There's indication that moving forward in a mech moves you towards the mouse in an agrav, yet they seem to control like tanks no matter what I do. Effectively, this makes them much weaker tanks with the relatively nice ability of flying over low cover and not getting bogged down in debris.

Speaking of debris: in massive fields of it, and those do tend to pop up wherever you go, it's hard to tell what's a flat plane you can walk through, and what's still standing. 

For a game with emphasis on destruction, explosive weapons and elements tend to be a bit lackluster visually. They're still very effective, but the actual blast seems significantly smaller than it should be.

Yet I feel like the best praise I can give here is that even though I have complaints, this is without a doubt my favorite game released this year. I've enjoyed my time with it so far, and the game seems to indicate that I have a very long way to go before I'm scraping the barrel. I hope this is a sign of the rebirth of content-rich singleplayer, because I would love to write more recommendations in the future and be able to say that this was the start of the trend.",1497223449,1497223449,True,2,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I haven't played the original release of Brigador but I think the complaints about it being hard to control are overstated. I started playing on the new control scheme but settled for tank controls for all vehicles. The absolute control scheme seems more responsive on a keyboard/mouse, especially for the agravs - it allows you to strafe and circle around your opponents with ease. I imagine the new control scheme would be great for a gamepad, though I'm still skeptical about the agravs. Anyway, my point is, the people who write this off because of the control scheme are giant babies. There's nothing wrong with it, and you have plenty of choices in how you choose to control your vehicle.

Music is another highlight for me. It's really well done retro electronica, cca late 70s/early 80s. Obvious comparisons would be John Carpenter movies, Tangerine Dream soundtracks, maybe Blade Runner in parts. 

Overall probably one of the funnest action games I've played in the past while. It manages to recreate that satisfying MechCommander feeling of playing with giant robots, but replaces its clunky combat with sleek, streamlined, and surprisingly kinetic action - moves have heft and explosions feel punchy and dangerous.

Do you want to play a tank with a cloaking field and invisibly drive over your opponents? Do you want to be a multi-story mech bristling with lasers that wins through sheer firepower? Or maybe an agile anti-grav making hit and run attacks with corrossive chemical weapons? The huge amount of vehicles and weapons means you can play however you want. Huge levels with 100% destructible terrain mean you can carve your own path through the game, either through brute force or stealth.

There's also a ton of difficulty settings in Freelance mode in the form of pilots, each of which has a difficulty rating that is either stable or goes up steadily over multiple levels. In addition you can adjust the game speed in the menus to make things less hectic.

There's been multiple times I've broken out laughing during this game as I suddenly realize the absolute massive damage that's been done to the city during a fight. Though it might not seem like this game has much of a story, the info logs set up a surpisingly deep and darkly satiric setting. For example, you get extra pay for collateral damage. A civilian casualty is worth $50. A decorative shrub is $100.

Also worth mentioning is that the dev support has been incredible post release. There have been multiple updates including weapon rebalances to make sure everything in the game feels fun to use. 

The controls may take a bit of getting used to if you aren't familiar with tank controls (however there are multiple control settings available).

and when I finally purchased it, whoo~ boy was it worth my money. 

Drive and maneuver many different vehicles, ranging from, 
heavy mechs, tanks and anti-gravity vehicles. 
Each with their unique gameplay mechanics, harpoints and maneuverability. 
Equip them with dozens of various weapons, like, mortars, cannons, gatling guns, 
missile launchers, rail guns, etc... 

The sheer amount of unlockables is amazing, and I really enjoy playing the freelance mode, 
where you choose everything, from pilot, vehicle, weaponry, sub-equipment and then a mission you want to tackle. 
Upon successfully completing a mission, you'll get money, which you use to unlock items. 

Brigador reminds me a lot of old games like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike,
but instead of having ""destroy these first"", ""then rescue this"", ""before time runs out destroy these"", 
you are given a vehicle, and told ""hey this is your mission, do it the way you like, also, don't worry of destroying buildings"". 

The soundscape is fantastic, and together with absolutely beautiful 80's soundtrack, it all greatly falls into an one big great experience.

In the end, Brigador is a satisfying, game of wreacking havoc and destruction everywhere you go, no matter which vehicle you drive, in the neon light streets while blasting your cannons in unison with the great beats of the soundtrack.

I had never seen a single image of this game or of its indev version Matador. I had not seen this on my Steam reccomended list, curators list, or on RPS. I wasn't scouring, but still. I regret getting this in a bundle, because I know I'd have purchased this the moment I saw it at $20, and I would've bought it sooner then that at the current $14. 

Brigador is almost a simple concept; you are a mercenary pilot, and your contract is to topple a South American style dictatorship on a far off colony world. You pilot a mech walker, tanks, tiny power-suits, and even anti-gravity tanks [all in three distinct enough factions]. The weapons feel very real, the controls are incredibly solid, and the combat is incredibly refreshing and difficult. For anyone who fell in love with C&C games like Red Alert or especially Tiberian Sun, they will be visibly aroused by the graphics. The description by devs that this is a 'Kool-Aid man simulator' is remarkably applicable, as the best tactic is often to rush through an apartment block flanking your foe.

I am not even finished with the campaign, of which there are literally a dozen tutorial levels that actually have meat, and two dozen actually missions with 4 different starting configuartions each to complete. You earn money, and funnel that back into puchasing pilots and gear to use in Operations, something almost akin to Diablos dungeons. You can purchase packs of anywhere from 2 to 20+ levels to run through any pilot configuration you choose, earning money based on how difficult you've made it for yourself. That makes for a very nice feedback loop, much nicer then, say, Diablos. You earn only pride for beating a Hell level run with a shitty motorcycle, but you crave that pride. Like starting a Dwarf Fortress map on a glacier, just because.

Another aspect I find absolutely incredible is the dev team. For a small team to place this much effort, polish, and obvious enthusiasm into a $20 package, rather then a watered down $40-$60 game with in-game purchases and DLC level packs gallore. This is an incredible amount of game for the money. Not to mention how responsive to community I have seen them be. Two separate devs came to answer an angry thread about a particularily tricky level, and both took a lot of time to explain as best they could to the player, but also preserving the experience. They didn't say ""Yeah theres a command we use to skip levels..."". To take the time out of their day like that as a developer is unique. Assasins Creed devs don't do tech support. 

All in all I highly reccomend this game to several people; Mech enthusiasts, C&C junkies, lovers of strategy, lovers of finely crafted menus and UI's, and fans of Just Cause. Just cause they're pretty similar with the dictator thing.

「二足歩行型、ホバー型、戦車型」のメカに搭乗できる。
サイバーパンクでお馴染みの「空飛ぶ車」にも乗れて雰囲気が素晴らしい。
キャンペーンモードは38のミッションを淡々とこなしていくもので、バックストーリーもあるが繋がりはあまりない。
別でフリーランスミッションもあるが、物語などなく言われた通りに目標の破壊をしていくのみ。

基本的にミッションで課せられる目的は、「建造物の破壊、目標の破壊、敵兵の破壊、弾薬庫の破壊等」
守備的なミッションは無く破壊することがほとんど、というよりそれしかない。

キャンペーンモードでは機体の兵装が決まっており、特殊兵器であるグレネード・スモーク・光学迷彩等も決まっている。
それが少々残念で、フリーランスミッションでは稼いだ金銭でアンロックしていくことで好きなようにカスタマイズができる為面白みに欠ける。またフリーランスミッションで搭乗者の生き様というか立場というか細かい設定が確認できるので、搭乗者それぞれの生き様をメインストーリーで演じてほしかった(正直これが足りない)。

戦闘自体は難しくなく、戦略的に攻めることを強要されない。メリハリのある作りではなく良く言えば「融通が利く」。
死角から電磁グレネードで動きを止めて一掃とか、壁をぶち破って背後からロケット弾をお見舞いするなど好きなようにできる。あり得ないぐらい切羽詰まる状況に追いやられたり、強すぎる機体が現れることもないので悪く言えば単調。軽くプレイされる方には良いかもしれない。

・他に気になった点などをまとめると、
搭乗者の物語がない。
二足よりホバーの方が有利すぎると感じた。
回避能力に長けているし、特殊兵器を使いこなせば立ち回りもスムーズ。
二足の良さを感じにくい。
爆発物との判別がしづらく、一部の目標となる対象物が見つけづらい(守備兵等)。
ミッションの種類が少ない。
協力プレイができない。
マップが少々広い。

・結果的に言えば、「サイバーパンクの世界観に浸れるかどうか」による。
BGMが素晴らしく世界観をより色濃く染め上げているので、好きな方は良い感じになれると思います。
逆にトップダウン型メックウォリアやアーマードコアのようなイメージをお持ちだと、「普通にトップダウン型のアクションシューティングではないか」と苛立つかもしれません。最終的に「メカに乗る必要あるのか」まで考えてしまうかもしれません。
メカ同士が熱いバトルを繰り広げる事もなく、ただ淡々と進むので人によってはつまらないと感じるかも。

I don't mean to imply it's anything like any of those gameplay-wise (it's not completely unlike FutureCop, but it's nowhere near a clone of it), but it's just so well-produced, charming and engrossing like those examples and definitely has a special feel to it. It's also pretty difficult at times, which would've also been appropriate in that era.

The gameplay itself is properly great and much deeper than you might expect; there's all sorts of different tactics to use including hit and run stealth (which I find the most fun but also very difficult to pull off properly), tons of weapons and vehicles, great attention to detail in both the design and writing of the entire game and an awesome soundtrack. There's a [i]lot[/i] of game here, I've played a fair bit and I haven't even finished the campaign yet.

What I love about it is it's maybe one third straightforward isometric twin stick-ish shooter, one third tactical combat and one third puzzle; each campaign mission gives you four pilots to choose from and each presents a wildly different strategy, working out how to complete the mission you just aced using the aptly-named Treehouse, this time using a tracked motorbike with a tenth of the durability and damage output (but ten times more speed) will have you scratching your head for sure. It never gets old! Then there's the Freelancer mode, which is actually the meat of the game, where you get to choose your own pilot, vehicle and weapons and therefore set your own challenge.

The only downsides I can think of are the weapon sight lines can be hard to use at times, especially against Agravs (floating enemies), I've died more than once by accidentally launching a huge artillery shell at a building I'm practically inside because of this. It's difficult to tell which weapon will fire on which mouse button, I feel this could've been handled better, but I get around this by giving most targets both barrels until I learn which is which so that's a minor one. Explosive scenery has also killed me a number of times because it's hard to focus on shooting a large group of enemies and moving at the same time, but you work out how to stop doing that after a few times. I think that's it, I haven't encountered any bugs, cheap deaths or poor balance in my time with it.

In summary, I'd recommend this so strongly that I've bought two copies of it besides my own (technically one was in the Humble monthly but still counts, damn it) to distribute and will buy more when it's full price again to support the devs. 

Although I feel like I haven't said enough about the quality of the writing. Fortunately the Brigador wiki has a lot (if not all) of the lore and intel transcribed so you can see that for yourself even before you buy. I'm fairly sure this gave me goosebumps the first time I read it, being so vivid and evocative as it is (spoilered, but doesn't give away any of the story, in fact there's not actually a story to spoil):

[spoiler]""When Spacers really want you dead they just quietly drop in one of their kill squads, powersuits decked in camo fields, Lockdowns, and Black Hands. Those guns are quiet, those suits are quiet, and pretty soon their targets are quiet too.

If there's anything that keeps me up at night, that's it.""[/spoiler]

That's it. It's awesome. Everything about it is fantastic with the exception that vehicle customization is somewhat limited. Two weapons plus a special. But that is compensated for by the sheer number of vehicles and weapons so it's a rather moot point and you will surely find a vehicle that caters to exactly how you want to play - and there is a huge variety - hover cars, tanks, walking mechs, and others.

Ok, on to the details:

The graphics are great. Dated in the same way something like Super Meat Boy is dated but perfectly fits the game. Obviously intentional. It's dark and usually night-ish time for some reason. Everything can be destroyed. The only problem with this is that you'll enjoy destroying things so much you'll run out of ammo :) If there's a story, I can't find it. I feel like I am playing the bad guys because I am often romping through residentail areas destroying houses and stepping on fleeing people. Awesome. It's kind of refreshing. The music fits the environments and graphics perfect. Its dark and snythetic 80's dystopian...something. I don't know much about music.

The missions themselves are all ""destroy the thing"". This is good because shooting guns is awesome and exploding things is great. The only issue with this that I have run into is that some of your objectives blow up real good. I say this is an issue because I've been in situations where I have run out of ammo, the ammo depot was destroyed, and I only have stomp left. My own fault. Again, see my comment about shooting everything.

The learning curve in this game is sort of high. Think of it as a twin stick shooter but the direction of your guns is often independent of the direction your legs/treads are facing. This means you can move around in one direction and shoot in another. This might take some getting used to if you've not played other games that work like this. But there are excellent tool-tips throughout the missions. You walk up to these objects and some text is on the screen. At first I wanted this gone so I could just play but the implementation is perfect and few games do this right. There are even reminders about past tips that are situated perfectly. It's like the game read my mind and was never annoying or patronizing. The text is only on the screen so long as you are close to these objects and the tips/instructions are always helpful. Perfectly designed so if you want to skip it you can and if you need the help, they actually provide good help. And you can go back to these objects at any time if you get lost or need help.

The mechanics in this game also exceed what I was expecting. Mechs can crouch!!!! This helps you avoid fire. Your weapons have an extreme range limit (usually). Far too often you play top-view games like this and your cannon fires all of 60' and disappears. In this your guns may as well have unlimited range - which is how it should be. It means you can properly snipe and use stealth to kill things from far away. Most vehicles have some kind of grenade. Some are smoke or EMP. The arc is helpful. And if you are smart about it, things like smoke deploy multiple projectiles over time so you can move your reticle to spread out the smoke grenades. Very smart and allows for a higher skill ceiling. Going back to movement of your vehicle, it all feels really good. With weapons/turrets separate from treads/feet, they have differing turn rates. Machine guns might turn faster than a cannon (or a mount turns at different speed - not sure yet) so you have to factor that in when maneuvering. You need to keep an eye where your feet are facing relative to your guns. Also, where you point your cursor is where the gun fires on the ground so you can hit small things on the ground quite easily but if the cursor is beyond the target, you could easily shoot over it to hit something behind.

If there was one thing I would add to this game is co-op multiplayer (either local or online or both). Also, if the maps are any bigger than I've experienced (about 2/3 the way through the campaign), a minimap would be helpful but I've never really gotten lost at all. There are indicators at the edge of your screen where stuff is. Sometimes finding/getting to the exit after completing the goals takes a minute but that's it.

9.5/10.

Anyway Brigador is NOT a twinstick shooter, it’s a strategic vehicle shooter, and with this last update revamping the tutorial and new playable vehicles you might be confused as to where to start, and that’s the point of this review:
So go to the options menu and set the controller mode to Relative, also set the gamespeed to 100 if you’re using M&K or 80 if you’re using a controller. 
Relative controls are the way the game is meant to be played; like you would expect a mech or tank to control except the perspective is isometric, but you’ll get used to that in no time.
Then start the campaign, the new tutorial is a bit “slow” mostly because there’s a lot of stuff to learn, after that the campaign ramps up in difficulty quite fast (I’m looking at you level 12).
Aside of that there’s a Freelance mode which is the rouge-like mode: You unlock pilots, vehicles, weapons and some sort of mini campaigns, the easiest pilots are a good way to practice, so pay attention to their difficulty multipliers before you buy a very hard one and get melted at the beginning of the mission.
SOME TIPS: Remember you can hold ‘E’ to turn in the direction your mouse is aiming, it makes navigation much faster when you’re not in combat. It’s also useful if you want to be sure you’re not exposing your rear as a tank since your front is always more armored (as a mech; hold shift to crouch instead). And I mean this: crouching as a mech and always showing your front to the enemy as a tank makes a huge difference in the harder difficulties. Also don’t forget to use your abilities, and ramming/stomping.

What else is there to say? The graphics are amazing, the lightning is like nothing you’ve seen on a 2D game, the vehicle designs are top notch, the soundtrack is genuinely memorable and the lore is cryptic and reminds me of Syndicate. It’s not just “look at me I have neon and synthesizers!!” Actual love and craftsmanship has been put into this game.",1496612200,1496612525,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Really neat neo-80s visual style, extreme attention to detail in every aspect to preserve overall theme and keep the glance value of dozens of playable vehicles and hundreds of destructable objects; speaking of which, everything in this game is VERY satisfying to blow up having a punch to it.

The OST fits the theme perfectly, keeps the rhytm of the game and doesn't get old after playing for nearly 20 hours. Looking to upgrade to the DDE just for the OST - it really is that good on its own.

Gameplay wise it's fantastic and keeps you wanting to go back and just blow up more things. You get a full-blown campaign, each mission is offered to finish with 4 different vehicles, giving you the choice between full-front assault on the enemy and sneaky hit'n'run tactics, where you can't take your chances to get overwhelemed by the enemy, have to use stealth, strategy and be careful about your surroundings. Or you could just steamroll through the enemy on a 3-story war machine. This is a really great way to offer variety to the gameplay, please different playstyles and easily quadruple the time spent in said campaign.
There's ton of different vehicles and weapons, and each has it's distinct feel an playstyle. Big vehicles and guns are slow and unmaneuverable but hit hard, and smaller guns are fast and precise. You can feel the clunkiness of a rotating tower and the heavyness of a 105 mm shell going through a house.

You're also offered a Freelance mode, for which you unlock vehiles, weapons, abilities and pilots and are free to combine them in different manner. Basically, its own sandbox. Pilots offer a variety of difficulty levels and pacing to the game, either you want things easy, go from easy to hard or crank up the difficulty to 11. 

EVERYTHING in this game has own lore which is damn fun to read and immerse yourself in the world of Brigador.

This game is a gem and a love child of a 5-people team, easily one of the best ones I've played in years. There aren't any games of this genre on my memory and Brigador is King.
Get it for yourself and your friends, it's really worth it. And there's a Linux version!",1496603658,1498323493,True,5,0,0.585531473159790039,0,False,False,False,False,,,

When you first jump in you might think ""Okay, so it's an isometric shooter with a ton of destruction."" and depending on your preferences that alone might be enough to satiate you. Indeed, that core aspect does play very well. But there’s more than meets the eye here. While that is definitely the case and it definitely does deliver on that front, Brigador is also a game with a hidden depth. 

With a large variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, Brigador offers many ways to realise that massive destruction. Do you want to run a hoverbike with shield shredding lasers and optic camo for a hit-and-run / stealthy glass cannon? Do you want to run a chemical spewing, lead wall blasting tank? How about a mech with cannons designed to snipe through cover? Choosing and tinkering with the method of obliteration is half the fun here.
 
The campaign gives you an environment to learn the ins and outs of vehicle types, weapon types and general mechanics. Freelance mode on the other hand gives you the opportunity to tailor gameplay to your liking, choosing overall difficulty, exact vehicle loadouts (or just randomize it for funsies) and the mission you want to play. 

However, I will say that from what I have seen mission types are a bit lacking across both modes and can generally be put into one of two categories; blow up specified buildings, or blow up specified enemy units. There are side-objectives but again, they’re mostly just variations of those two types. Additionally, I found myself getting caught on terrain occasionally but whether that's down to the game or just my situational awareness in combat not being what it should be, I don't know. 

Stylistically Brigador feels very much like a mid to late 90’s sci-fi game got lost somewhere in time and ended up getting developed in the modern era by mistake. From the general aesthetic to the animations to the music, everything captures those styles perfectly and gives them a nice new coat of paint. In particular the visual style reminds me a LOT of Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun. 

Much like the mechanical depth of the game the amount of lore might not immediately be apparent, but there’s a lot of world building that went into the universe. Tidbits of information are given to you in the mission briefings, which give you an idea of the interactions between factions and what life is like on the planet and individual cities. Beyond that almost everything is given a backstory available to unlock and read from a screen in the main menu. And I mean almost everything. But if you’re not the kind of person that’s into reading the history of a world, you’re not obligated to. There’s no intrusive cutscenes or anything like that so if you just want to jump in and blow stuff up with no regard for plot or setting, you’re not held back from doing so. 

So all in all, Brigador is a fun, explosion filled game that’s pretty easy to pick up but with enough depth to keep it engaging, despite perhaps being slightly repetitive when it comes to objectives. It’s a game that is mechanically and stylistically on point and gives the player a lot of options. Brigador feels like something that was made with a vision in mind, and a game that used its inspirations to make something new instead of something derivative.",1496602601,1496626621,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its controls are tight, easy to uses, easy to understand, and with enough depth that trying certain vehicles become extremely rewarding with their high skill ceiling required for operation.

The soundtrack is top notch and even a good listen outside of the game, themes similar to Hotline Miami are hard not to draw when it comes with the music but it has its own flavor of the dystopian future Brigador is set in.

The artistic style of the game shows the great care the developers put into the game, retro color grading with high quality models and world assets flow together seamlessly as the chimes of the music ring as you blast your way through the map all the while avoiding detection.

Its a blast, worth $20 bucks or at the least $10 and its hard not to wish for a future for Brigador.

Crazy good soundtrack that I would've bought even if the game never existed.

What I do wanna stress though is how fuckin awesome the developers are. This game is very clearly a labor of love. All the detail they've put into it, the amazing support, consistently adding new content (like this new relaunch that added a bunch of stuff and just improved the game overall for FREE), and the fact that they are always engaging with the players.

The tweaks and additions may not seem that huge on paper, but in practise they make the game so much better.

Immediately the soundtrack caught my attention even before I'd played the game, it's a crackin' synthwave eargasm from start to finish by Makeup and Vanity Set and if nothing else deserves a listen.  Everything sounds good overall; clunking metal footsteps of mecha, chainguns ripping through concrete and the ever delightful sound of a heavy cannon connecting with steel.

With a surprisingly indepth lore, solid controls, good vehicle and equipment variety I'd say take a look.  It's not often you find an immersive mecha title these days afterall.

The game offers a sense of progression as you unlock stuff. There's a campaign mode with a tutorial and some missions with set parameters. There is also a freelance mode, which is more like a sandbox which can last a number of maps depending on how you set your run.

The vehicle types feel different and control differently (the game is based on tank controls) but there are a lot of control options to tweak them to your liking. I play with a controller, and I do just fine. The vehicles themselves offer a lot of variety, have cool visual designs, and awesome lore associated with them.

Shoot loyalists! Blow up tanks/walkers/buildings! DESTROY EVERYTHING!

The endless destructomatic fun also hides some fairly involved tactical play, use of flanking, defence abilities and special abilties really level the battlefield. Add in some stealth features and directional damage and you have a winning formula for fun, engaging combat.

Smart, stealthy players will have a serious challenge ahead, but the payouts will be massive. Not up to the crazy hard, grueling endurance runs? No problem. Grab a big mech with a big gun and wreak havoc and guess what? You'll still get paid, and you can do it in three missions.

This isn't really a twin-stick shooter; WASD are your chassis movement controls and your turret/torso are controlled with a mouse. I definitely do not recommend using a controller at all as you'll lose some serious precision which you'll need. There are options to significantly reduce the game speed if needed, so if you're jonesing for a controller game Brigador will do in a pinch.

The Freelance mode, with static maps but random enemy placements, will be the meat of your time with the game. Pick any vehicle, weapons, and level setups you've unlocked and GO!

The campaign is decent fun, with unique and static scenarios. You'll be rewarded very well for each level and vehicle pair you complete, so if you're enjoying youself, go back and clear the level again with a completely different vehicle.

The Deluxe Edition is well-worth it for the music alone, and the Audiobook is great military sci-fi fun.

Something that manages to impress me. Something that isn't just a generic clone of something else.
And then i found this. Looked interesting, so i thought i'd give it a whirl. And very quickly, i found myself thinking ""Good heavens, why have i never heard of this game, before?"".
Truly, i had found the very definition of a hidden gem.

It has the vibe of the original Syndicate. It has the music (And the somewhat cryptic lore/plot) of Hotline Miami. And rather gracefully, it brings these elements together in a mech/tank/hovertank action game where you level entire city blocks.

A quick run-down of the setting: The game takes place in the city of Solo Nombre, on the planet Novo Solo, an off-world colony far from earth.

A while ago, this colony was taken over by a dictator simply known as ""Great leader"", who turned the colony into a North-Korea style, hyper-isolationist city-state.

Tonight, he has died.

Pretty much immediately, you have a rebel uprising happening, loyalists trying to cling to the old ways, a highly advanced outside faction called the ""spacers"" using the opportunity to essentially invade, and your employer, a shady corporation, hiring mercs to ""represent their interests"" as well. And it's all happening in one night. A battle royale to be sure!
Oh, don't worry though, despite the game being set all in the same night, the devs were kind enough not to give us time limits. (Thank you devs!)

As for the gameplay, it's quite a good mix. On easier difficulty settings, with stronger vehicles, you will pretty much steamroll everything, but get fairly small rewards. The higher the difficulty gets and the more challenging the vehicle you pick, the more you will have to play it smart and carefully, but the richer you will become. It's quite charming that way.


Anyways, i'm truly hoping that this game gets a bit of a late updraft in popularity. Maybe it's just me, but i had never even heard of it before i randomly stumbled upon it in the store, the other day. And for a game this fun, that's just not right.

Brigador is an excellent isometric shooter about ~ D E S T R U C T I O N ~

You can drive a tank, hovercraft, a big ol' mech or a tiny sneaky one, but at the end of the day, the goal (and gameplay) is to shoot your enemies, rolling and stomping through the buildings (and ruins!) of the bases and towns you'll encounter in missions.

=> Vehicle urban warfare, gone dystopian sci-fi. <==


There's several original elements regarding Brigador:

1) The music: well-fitting neon 80s tunes!

2) The isometric view: allows you to properly see the combat unfolding.

3) The collateral destruction: every cannon shot that misses or pierce through will strike the buildings, vehicles and barriers around. When everyone is shooting high-caliber machineguns, mortars are flying, the scene is definitely gonna be apocalyptic once the firefight is over.

4) The lore. It's not the first thing you'll notice, and it will take a while to get into it, but it's crafted with such care it's well worth it.

The game will be re-launched early next month, completely replacing the existing training missions with simpler, shorter missions with only as much text as is necessary, so people can get a sense of the controls without having to read (or ignore) so much of a text dump.

If you haven't requested a refund, I hope you'll take another look at the game then, and decide if it's more to your liking. People seem to think the combat loop has a lot of depth and nuance, especially once you get into Freelance, but we can't begrudge you if the game doesn't seem welcoming--we are fixing that right now. 

And glad you like the music. The relaunched game features more music, too!

Mechanically the gameplay is initailly awkward but fun once you adjust for the movement controls (or change setting in the options menu), and the aesthetic is right up my alley (doubly so the music) but the core gameplay feedback feels like its fighting itself.

Brigador is an isometric vehicle action game in which you are a pilot from one of three factions given a unique opportunity to make a large sum of money.

Solo Nobre is a city on the colony world of Solo Novo. Years ago, control of it was seized from the sponsoring corporations that founded it in a militant uprising led by a man known only as Great Leader. Great Leader ensured his control over the city by erecting a series of orbital cannons meant to ward off any invasion from above while his armies secured Solo Nobre through military force and the division of the city into walled districts. All contact with the outside world and the galaxy at large was cut off, with Great Leader's watchful cannons ensuring the security of Solo Nobre.

This seizure of power was not without opposition. At the end of the Nobrean Civil War, a surviving band of revolutionaries, the Corvids, began to slowly rebuild and make plans of a new revolt, for they believe that the only way for Solo Nobre to prosper is under a free and democratic government. This goal, to them, must be reached no matter the cost.

The Solo Nobre Concern, a shadowy organization created by the founding interests of Novo Solo, wish to retake their rightful property. That's where you come in.

Tonight, Great Leader has died. The Loyalist Military under his command is in disarray, and the Corvids have taken this opportunity to launch their own uprising and have already seized several districts. In addition to this, the Spacers, a transhuman mercenary element from Deep Space have arrived upon Novo Solo in search of profit and glory. You are a Brigador- a paid mercenary hired by the Solo Nobre Concern to carry out certain military objectives within the confines of Solo Nobre, with the end goal of liberating the city in one night and allowing it to shelter once more under the umbrella of economic prosperity provided by the SNC.

Whether you're a defecting Loyalist in search of passage offworld, an opportunistic Corvid looking for personal gain, or a ravenous Spacer thirsting for glory and wealth, only one thing matters tonight.

Great Leader is dead.

Solo Nobre must fall.

Here is your Contract.

Do you accept?

=================================================================

The game itself is fantastic. Smooth controls (they may take some getting used to, but alternate control schemes are available in options), beautiful visuals that look like a proper evolution from a 90's action game (unlike so many ""retro"" games these days, who simply awkwardly pantomime the style), and a fantastic soundtrack (by Makeup and Vanity Set) that immerses you starting from the main menu. 

You have a vast selection of vehicles, weapons, and special abilities that will aid you in your mission to bring destruction to Solo Nobre, and the three factions each have their own selection of platforms across three types (Mechs, Tanks, and Antigravity Vehicles). Each faction also has a wide selection of pilots who serve as difficulity and income multipliers, as well as revealing intimate background information about themselves and the factions they serve.

The writing is superb, with the background slowly coming into full view as you unlock equipment, pilots, intelligence entries on enemy vehicles, and a good spread of dediated lore entries as well that elaborate upon the world of Novo Solo and the galaxy at large. If you enjoy the sort of storytelling where everything isn't immediately apparent and you must work to unlock the world's secrets, then Brigador will satisfy you.

One final thing that I personally appreciate is that the Devs are very active in the game's discussion forums, and won't hesitate at all to listen to your comments, or answer any and all questions about anything related to the game and its development.

On top of being a fantastic game, it's going to be growing even further. The Devs have announced that on June 2nd they'll be rolling out a re-release that adds more vehicles, pilots, and a redone tutorial campaign as well as an entirely new campaign. Whether anything else will be hiding among these goodies, I can't say, but I know that I'm looking forward to June 2nd. It will also be going on sale then, which will no doubt encourage many more to try it.

Pros:

+ Retro kinda game with modern intake. This game is straight up fun. You can play in different ways.

+ Customization. You can build your own mech. You can design one suited for stealth, or just build one that will create chaos.

+ Control settings. I liked the default controls, but people may not like the tank controls. Luckly, this game does provide a good amount of different control settings. Also playable with a controller, although I recommend you play that in a lower game speed.

+ Unlockables. There's loads to unlock, mechs, weapons, story, lore etc.

+ Campaign and Contracts. Campaign is pretty good length and once you finish you can start doing contracts, which adds a new challenging element to the game. Lots of variety and giving you loads of gameplay time after finishing campaign.

+ Music. One of the best music soundtrack I ever heard.

+ Everything is destructible!



Cons:

- Campaign can be a little unbalanced. Some earlier levels are much harder than the later ones. ( again, this was before the update, I believe they did change the campaign a little bit to balance this ).

- Some levels can be extremely short.",1492504587,1497732207,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Aesthetically, it's unimpeachable; this is the apocalypse come to town, in garish, soulless neon, filtered through a UI that oscillates between studied loathing of your puny meat eyes and slick, smooth beauty that promises delight, to those who can pay. The soundtrack is perfect; retro without being a greasy close-up in some sad sack's lurid nostalgia porn.
Gameplay: Brigador is hard. Brigador doesn't like you, but then, it just needs some time to warm up to you. And my god, when you do kick the hell out of a level, you feel like you earned it. Paying attention to facing, line of sight, and prioritizing targets are immediately rewarded as you gun your way through the suspiciously well-lit (at least, until you damage the power systems badly enough to shut down the lights) streets of Solo Nobre.
Especially notable - there's almost no ludonarrative dissonance here at all. Freelance difficulty is set by choosing your pilot and the scope of your violent, amoral rampage; you progress from disgruntled conscripts and single moms just trying to fill their little girl's college fund with ill-gotten gains into the company of the real sick puppies, the kind of psycho carnival geeks who paint their masterpieces (and often their nails) with human blood. Brigador isn't a 'gotcha' game, or preachy, but it has a definite moral perspective on violence that's surprisingly adult, nuanced, and humane.

A very detailed lore and backstory for all the factions.

The freelance mode gives you the ability to run wild on the city with hundreds of different mech/pilot/gear combinations.

Then there is Brigador. In every aspect, Brigador is king. When another TSS gets crowned, Brigador will be god.
It is that good.

Graphically, it looks like someone took Syndicate and made a table-top miniatures game out of it, played it on Grampa's model railroad table, then re-digitized it. Maps ooze detail, sometimes literally. When you blow up a building, for example, you'll often see red gibs fly out...
...because there were civilians in there.
But that's okay, because civilians are worthless and need to die, too. We'll get to that in a bit.
Every pixel counts, and it's not all just brown bleh indicitive of a Grimdark game. Neon lights, green farms, golf courses; Brigador has a pretty mixed biome for the genre. Explosions and lasers and mortars and whatever other ways you choose to rip the maps apart look great as well.

Another point I need to bring up, though, is consistancy. Character portraits all look as though they are from the same artist (no weird one-off or random anime characters mixed in), and all of the other 2D art assets look like they fit into the universe. Even the goofy cameo by a Something Awful goon somehow fits.
3D art assets...there are none. Which is good. Because then it would look awkward. All of the little dudes and mechs and tanks and giant moving towers with turrets made from the carcasses of Toyota Previa minivans look amazing and are meticulously animated. They look like wargaming miniatures!

The music never gets tiring. It weirdly fits into the retro-futuristic, neon and cyborg-vomit aesthetic. I'd buy the soundtrack, but I've been listening to it for over 20 hours, so I don't think I need to bring it into the car. Lasers don't sound like 'pew pew!'; they sound like popping capacitors (which is more like they should sound). Only thing I can ask are of the explosions. Could be a little more impactful. But, this might be due to a more technical issue I have with the audio. Sounds (other than music) seem to either be coming from one speaker or another. This often has me panning the camera just to see if my other speaker is having issues.

The universe is interesting enough to get me to buy the book just to learn more about it. There is plenty of lore to buy with earned in-game money (because knowledge costs, even if it is about your job). Think William Gibson with suicidal depression had a discussion with Trent Reznor back in the early 90's. All you need to know from here is that everyone is valuable in such a way as you get paid for civilian casualties. SPL really wants you to clean this place up. Personally, I'm cool with that.

To kill off those combatants and non-combatants, you have a lot of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. From normal stuff like stompy mechs to welded together cars, things that hover and tanks that roll on trackballs, you get it all. You even get the Killdozer, which is a real thing--look it up.
Plenty of weapons too, to fit anyone. Personally, I like chemical weapons that corrode things and melt people. This allows me to live out the fantasy of using them on groups of civilians without getting executed for warcrimes.
And I really like launching them from a Toyota Previa.
Or using dual machineguns from a Tuk-Tuk.
Or stomping around in a little (reletive to map-size) powersuit and sneaking up behind massive mechs and tearing them down.

I don't have any issues with the controls. Mouse and keyboard, works fine. AGRAVs take a little getting used to, and you have to get used to the difference between jumping between a tank with a turret and a mech that needs to turn to fire at a target behind it, but that comes quick. Because you die if it doesn't.

So yea, play it. Difficulty is extreme, but so is the fun. $20 is pretty modest for the amount of content you get with the game. I'm 22 hours in and struggling, but enjoying the hell out of it. If you like twin-stick-shooters, cyberpunk-cool, stompy robots, tanks, floaty things, guns, and/or killing without remorese or penalty, the game is for you.

Brigador brings the old school graphics from the late 90s--such as Diablo and Starcraft--while launching it forward and melding it with new game design techniques.
The aesthetic is wonderful with the mixture of retro wave music akin to musicians such as Perturbator, along with the visual theming.
Overall the game just creates a wonderful atmosphere that I absolutely fell in love with. Being a fan of stuff like it, it was almost a buy based on that alone.
The gameplay helped with causing me to purchase the game. It seems like a basic twin stick shooter (which you can change it to control like one in the settings) but its far more. The default controls have each vehicle controlling differently depending on the type and its stats, allowing for a great variety and ability to customize.
One thing I'd love to see, is a short gif when looking at the arsenal, to show how each weapon works without having to enter into a mission with a potentially not great weapon in your opinion.
On top of the controls, the combat can either be methodical and ""realistic"" within the games lore, or fast paced and twitchy, depending on your loadout and skill.

This game is a complete package, hitting high marks on every area.
I personally enjoy that this game is singleplayer only, but a form of multiplayer in the future wouldn't hurt sales (or perhaps in a successor game).
Thanks for making a great game and jumping in the dystopian synthwave cyber theme.",1491462406,1491462406,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

FIRST OF ALL... ALL GAMERS SHOULD BUY THIS AWESOME GAME!!!

So far this game is completely awesome! Just the attention to detail and amount of options in the menus will tell you that this game is of AAA quality!  Everything from the UI's to the level designs look to be designed with much love!  Everything is described in full detail.  There may only be 21 missions, but there are free-play and endless modes that will keep you busy for many, many enjoyable hours of total mech destruction!

You can grind levels if you want more cash to purchase the many pilots, mechs, etc.  There are a LOT to choose from and money comes quick, so gameplay is not boring at all!  The dev's have done a superb job making this feel a bit retro, with a grand futuristic feel as well!  A game done right for gamers that love mech games.  A MUST buy for mech lovers! It's easily one of the best mech games I have played and harkens back to the Mech Warrior days! Many KUDOS to the dev's!!!

Graphics are very nice and sounds that match gameplay to the tee!  The game runs silky smooth and is optimized very well.  Explosions and sounds never once paused the game or had any weird glitches.  So far this is a solid and polished game!

Keyboard and mouse controls work best for me, as a gamepad was a little frustrating to use.  You could get used to it I guess.  Being a mech game, you walk & turn your lower body with one set of controls, and turn your upper body and aim up & down, left & right with another set of controls.  This works great with the keyboard and mouse, but it's hard using a gamepad to do all of this with the analog sticks and buttons.  It supports my PS4 wireless gamepad, but keyboard and mouse work so well, that it best to use them.

It runs silky smooth on my MacBook Pro!

While that description alone was enough to get me intensely interested, I ended up vastly more impressed than I expected. 
The game has a bit of a learning curve and doesn't hold your hand very much, but if you're smart, you'll switch the controls to absolute instead of relative and have a much more pick-up-and-go style of play. The soundtrack is very 1980's retro-futuristic, as are the vivid neon colors and chunky,  occasionally ridiculous vehicle designs. Each mission is generally short enough for this game to fall well into ""casual"" territory and a little slim variety of mission type, which is a little disppointing until you realize just how stupidly content-packed the game is. 

Pros - 
-HUGE variety of vehicles and weapons
-Vast amount of content
-Awesome sound design and music
-Fun and distinctive visuals
-Game is so well optimized that it will likely run on a toaster oven if you tune down the resolution a bit
-Surprisingly rich lore, though you really have to know where to look for it
-Good price point if you enjoy this style of game and this aesthetic
-You can destroy absolutely everything, which is *highly* amusing

Cons-
-Content fatigue. A lot of the missions are a little repetitious. 
-The game does have a bit of a learning curve in the form of unintuitive default controls.
-Gameplay doesn't showcase its own *extremely* rich lore as well as it really could, instead forcing you to buy backstory tidbits with in-game currency that would almost always be spent on things like optional missions, personnel, equipment and intel instead. 

If you've played games like Desert Strike/Urban Strike/Jungle Strike or similar, or the old isometric BattleTech games, or if you enjoy arcade-y 'mech shoot-em-up games and like a vivid cyberpunk aesthetic, go right ahead and grab this.

Isometric Mechwarrior, tank sim, speedy bullet hell, Solid Snake in Big Daddy armor...the game changes depending on how you equip yourself. It's tight.

There's been an upswelling in nostalgia-based games and 1980s aesthetics over the past few years, and this one takes both into places that I don't usually see. You're given control of any one of a number of different mechs, tanks, and hovertanks (I think the total is up around 50 now, with something like 50 weapons to mix-and-match into your loadout), thrown into a sprawling isometric landscape (might be urban, might be rural, might be industrial) and told ""Go.""

Before getting to the ""standard"" elements of a review, I want to point out that Brigador knows how to present itself as a unified entity. The visuals, sound effects, soundtrack, and text all mesh together into a coherent whole expertly. This is an element of design that's hard to precisely identify (and even harder to learn), but it's the difference between having a bunch of different elements - gameplay, visuals, sounds - running at the same time, and having a single *thing*, the game. It's worth more than the sum of its parts, as they say. Even outside of the main gameplay loop it maintains this, through the extensive lore and intel entries for every vehicle, weapon, and location in the game. Read them - really. They're good.

Also, before getting farther into things, essential note: you can stomp things with your mech. Sometimes video games don't let you do this, or don't handle it in a satisfying way. Here, the stomping is good, very good. There's a palpable delay after you hit the ""stomp"" button as your mech winds up, and then - a shock wave, and a cacaphony, and everything in your immediate vicinity crashes down. The bigger the mech, the slower and more powerful the stomp. It feels great.

The basic loop is start level, shoot everything, end level. It's satisfying, for the most part, although this isn't the kind of game I sit down and play for hours on end. More of a ""run through a couple missions when I have some free time"" kind of thing. Money from completed missions can be put towards unlocking new vehicles, weapons, and levels, or it can be used to unlock intel and lore entries. While sometimes this kind of locking-off of content can be bothersome, here it's not so bad. You can make enough running the easier missions that the difficulty curve doesn't make it impossible to make progress here. And I've found that the fact that lore and intel are initially locked off means I'm more likely to read through them once I do unlock them. Maybe this is just apologia for something I like, I dunno. But they're worth reading through! They point things out about the various places you visit and the vehicles you use to utterly destroy them that would be missed during normal gameplay, and help to bring together the overall narrative, reinforcing the bits you get from mission briefings and loadout text.

The controls . . . well, as someone who only played Desert Strike at a friend's house, and that only for a few minutes at a time before the system's owner demanded I give up the controller, it took some getting used to. Actually, that's a lie - I'm still terrible with the default controls. Tank controls! They're tough when said tank is a small object on a busy screen (a beautiful screen, but a busy beautiful). Had they been the only option, I might not be writing this review, because I might not haven ended up playing enough to feel up to it. But an update did come, and screen-relative movement (as opposed to vehicle-relative) is an option for us folks who don't have the muscle memory ingrained from years of isometric shooters. Open up the options, scroll down, set a couple options, and now up really is up (or up-right, or up-left, depending on your preference). Seriously - the fact that the devs added this option speaks to their attentiveness to the fact that what works for one person might not work for another. That's a difficult sense to cultivate in any situation, but especially so in a nostalgia-fest like Brigador, where ""it's always been like this"" is often seen as the law of the land, rather than a potential area for improvement or iteration.

The audio and visual quality here is superb. The mechs and tanks of you and your enemies are gorgeous, and the lighting - the lighting! It's fantastic! Each actor on the screen - be it your player vehicle, an opponent, or one of the innumerable civilians wandering around Syndicate-style - casts a glow from their headlights or flashlights, and the landscape is lit up by neon signs, streetlamps, and warning lights. And explosions, of course. And lasers. Those kinds of things. Projectiles light up the ground as they pass, making each battle into a lightshow. And your footsteps and engines thump and rumble, and your weapons - and this is a surprisingly rare thing, even in big-budget releases - actually sound like they have impact. The different factions involved - there are three whose equipment you can choose from - each have a distinct look and feel. The Loyalists are standard government military: olive drab, blocky, heavy armor. The Corvids are the raiders, the junkyard dogs, and their vehicles look the point, cobbled together from old cars and salvaged wreckage. Their ""Treehouse"" tank in particular comes to mind, a towering pile of scrap with a station wagon - a station wagon! - perched on top to serve as the housing for the main gun. And there's the Spacers, who are all, uh, weird-lookin'. Industrial, would be the word, I guess. Each class of vehicle (mech, tank, a-grav) has a number of weight classes, with the smallest being motorcycles or battlesuits and the largest standing multiple stories tall.

A completely polished action game, with a glossy cyberpunk aesthetic and gorgeous soundtrack. 

The action is both very fast and very deliberate. You command a mech (or a tank, or a pickup truck with a machine gun, or a jetbike, or a stack of cars with an artillery gun on top). In real-time action, you roll through suburbs, railyards, and necropolises, taking on scores of machines as powerful as yours. The opposition is always heavy, so tactics are key. You're gonna want to lure enemies to move near ammo dumps and gas lines. Sometimes you'll hide behind a thick wall and lob artillery. Sometimes you will just engage the cloaking device and run away. 

The Campaign mode is an introduction to the game and its mechanics, serving up one map at a time, and a small number of pre-cooked loadouts for you to take it on with. The Freelance mode is more like the main course. Here, you take on missions that span multiple maps (the game has dozens of gorgeous and detailed maps). At the end of each mission, you'll have to exfiltrate through a spaceport map to get your pay. 

What to say about the theme and story? I think a lot of people didn't appreciate this, but it was extremely persuasive to me. The planet of Solo Nobre is clearly inspired by the history of US imperialism in South and Central America. The term that best captures what your characters do in the story of the game is ""paramilitary death squad."" Solo Nobre's left-wing strongman ruler has died, and the forces of interplanetary capitalism are extremely eager to gain access to the planet's markets. To do this, they hire mercenaries (you) to conduct a campaign of violence and destruction, so that they can step into the void of a ruined civil society. If Great Leader's death doesn't lead to civil war by itself, they will buy one.

The kind of explanatory narration I've used doesn't appear anywhere in the game, though. And why should it? Corporate communications do not speak of ""death squads"" and a nefarious lust for chaos. Instead, the game's story is conveyed by anodyne corporate-speak and unfair contract terms; the larger context appears when you read between the lines. Your employer is called, ""the Solo Nobre Concern (hereafter SNC)."" ""The SNC's development goals for Solo Nobre depend on keeping the local government forces in disarray as long as possible."" ""We have strong intelligence suggesting that several persons of interest can be found in the refugee camps. ... Remove the command vehicles so that our HR department may conduct interviews.""

Have something short & sweet to give you the important details and save on the time you're going to probably want to devote to this game:

+ Beautifully rendered sprites and lighting that are more akin to a well-aged CRPG rather than done-to-death indie X-bit sprite graphics.
+ Sick electronic beats that haven't complemented a game so well since the debut of the Hotline Miami series.
+ A chilling cyberpunk-esque atmosphere that'll suck you in and make you feel right at home in Solo Nobre.
+ LOTS AND LOTS OF CONTENT. Seriously, the sheer number of vehicles and mechs between the three factions makes for a delicious amount of variety in the combat, which is [i]much[/i] deeper than what on the surface appears to be your average twin-stick shooter. Also, a metric ton of lore oozing with style and character that'll keep you hooked long after the shooting stops.

Complaints of difficult controls from other reviewers can generally be mitigated in some fashion by playing different vehicles. Many vehicles have completely different control schemes, and so in some sense it's down to the player to find a vehicle type that they prefer where weapons and controls are concerned. Customizing your vehicle for each mission is critical to your success, and there is no absolute 'right' answer. It's up to you, learn what fits your play style and use it. Experiment with different weapon and vehicle combinations, and if you're pressed for creativity the stand-alone missions will throw you into a mission preset vehicles, weapons, and pilots. The stand-alone missions can be a great way to find your next favourite loadout as you're forced to do as much as you can with often unfamiliar vehicles and weapon combinations. Take your new knowledge into the campaigns and visit entirely new levels of devastation upon your enemies. 

 The game is a throwback to 90's isometric vehicle destruction games, though it sets itself apart in many ways. Return Fire, Desert Strike, and those sorts of games are obvious inspirations for this game, but they are not the blueprint for the game. Brigador is more like a love letter to those sorts of games, a reminder of what was fun about them, while not being a rehash of those games. If you were the sort that loved destroying everything you could in each level of Jungle Strike, or MechCommander, then this game might just be up your alley.

 The campaigns and missions are fairly basic with only the rudiments of objectives, the game concentrates not necessarily on strategic goals, but on the tactical style of combat. Slipping in and out of cover to exchange fire with tough foes, conducting feints to draw enemies away from an objective, flanking an entrenched defence, or using mobility and stealth to devastate the enemy . . . there are a great many play styles that are really up to the player and what they choose for vehicle and weapons. 

 The game has a lot of lore and story, but I've frankly ignored it all in favour of dropping into campaigns or missions for a half an hour to an hour and blasting everything in a level to rubble. I keep this game installed because the game play is fun and satisfying, even in shorter bursts, and because the level of destruction can be absolutely awe inspiring when you take the time to look at what you've wrought. Everything in a level can be . . . well, leveled. Driving through an apartment block, firing a huge howitzer into a parking lot, machine gunning everything else. The collateral damage in the game is amazing and satisfying. 

 I use to play King of the Monsters specifically to stomp all over the cities and destroy the buildings, all else was ignored. Rampage also comes to mind. Building stuff can be fun, wrecking stuff can also be great. Revel in destruction!

 Playing a mission in a residential area will likely see you devastate the surroundings. Ruins will be left in your wake. Lovingly crafted and detailed ruins. The missions are usually search and destroy with no real caveats where anything else in the environment is concerned. The destruction is fantastic. Wrecking everything is seldom so satisfying (Red Faction Guerilla being another great destruction based game) and it's frankly one of the reasons I keep coming back to this game. The environment isn't just a setting, it's an actor in your self-contained stories of wanton destruction. See an enemy tank a couple blocks away, nestled in a neon lit back alley, with tenement blocks all around you, in the way, hemming you in: drive through the buildings and flush the enemy out, use a penetration weapon like a rail-gun to fire through every obstacle and kill the enemy where he waits, use a mortar to lob death-from-above, zip around the streets and take pot-shots and draw him out, stealth your way up to him and park your gun into his rear, create a nearby distraction to lure him out and slip on by. You have options, and you don't need to exercise them all, find a play style that suits you and go wreck everything.

 Much of everything in this game is about earning cash which you use to unlock vehicles, pilots, weapons, and maps. I am not one for high scores or even achievement hunting, but the ease with which the game throws money at you negates any grind for more content, and more about enjoying the game play and discovering new fun tools of destruction. Easy to pop in for a bit and sow the seeds of destruction, laugh gleefully at how terrible of a person you are for destroying an entire city, and then set off on some other adventure.

Brigador is fucking fantastic.

The game takes place in the city of Solo Nobre, caught in a multi-faction civil war after the death of great leader. You play a Brigador, a mercenary mech/tank/hoverthing pilot promised a huge paycheck in return for ensuring your mysterious paymasters take control of the city.

General gameplay consists of piloting some form of vehicle through a city with totally destructible terrain. Both you and enemies have directional armour, rewarding flanking, stealth and use of noise. Buildings block line of sight, weapons cause noise both when fired and on impact and enemies will hunt you based on where they last saw or heard you. There's a joy to be had blowing up a fuel station, diving down a side street and waiting for hostiles to investigate then sneaking around and ambushing them from behind.

The game is split into two parts: Campaign and Freelance. Campaign gives you a linear series of missions, and a choice of four vehicles in each missions, roughly corresponding to easy-very hard difficulties. You're let loose in some sector of the city and leave most of it a smoking wreck.

Freelance, however, is where the game truly comes alive- choose a pilot, choose from an extensive list of vehicles, choose a weapon loadout, then choose a mission. Your pilot sets how difficult your mission will be- from The Auditor, who encounters no enemies whatsoever, to later characters who start at MAX difficulty and stay there. In between, there are several dozen characters with varying difficulty curves, where their difficulties (and payouts) increase for each sector of the city you move through. Vehicles range from monster mechs, to tiny anti-grav hover vehicles. Highlights include a tower of scrap cars on tracks and a motorbike with room for a gun almost its own size. Weapons are lovingly varied and include railguns, chainguns, rockets, artillery and machine guns.
Missions start you in one district of Solo Nobre, and end when you reach the starport. They range from short jaunts through four outskirts sectors to the 36-sector, no-early-exit behemoth of a mission at the high end. Each district, you are expected to destroy anti-orbital guns, remove officers and cause general havoc.
I eventually favoured a pair of rapid-fire railguns, on the fastest mech that could support them, sprinting through districts, shooting through buildings and flanking tough enemies. Other times I'd attempt to use a heavy mech wielding cluster artillery- never got the hang of it, but the joy of a single shot clearing most of the screen, buildings and all, never got old.

Brigador is a joy to play, heartily recommended.",1491176771,1510004870,True,14,0,0.633849859237670898,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The range of motion available to you is incredibly in-depth. The guns feel great, managing trajectory is a major component. The AI won't outsmart you, but that's not the point - the game forces you to manage enemies by use of smoke screen, distraction and deception. You can destroy everything, and it can destroy you as well.

Thirdly, the soundtrack. If you like SynthWave then you will enjoy the game just for the OST. If you don't know what SynthWave is...it will make sense to you as soon as you hear it. Makes you want to put some god damn mousse in your mullet, do a fat line of cocaine and jump in your Ferrari 512 TR and just speed off into the mother fucking sunset - or in this case - get in your tank made out of a shortbus fitted with a guass cannon and wreak havoc on your piece of shit nation.

Yeah yeah it's 20 bucks. Seems expensive. Until you think about the poor fuckers that pay 60 dollars for unfinished games these days. 

This game would benefit in a great way from multiplayer. It's screaming for it.",1490468758,1490468758,True,10,0,0.622456848621368408,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Brigador is like that, except now you can decimate the entire map leaving nothing but piles of rubble, kill all the civilians, and destroy enemies using structures as cover, and explodable buildings, like gas stations or power plants to ambush enemies looking for the sound of an explosion. Don't like a wall? Smash it with your mech's feet, or ram it with your hoverbike's bumper. Can't get a guy hidden behind a wall? Blow up the powerstation and cause a chain reaction that blows the wall and your enemy hidden behind it. It's not easy, though, it's not just circle strafing and aiming in the center. Sometimes you have to use distraction and stealth, to out think the enemies looking to outnumber and destroy you. 

A large variety of different vehicles, from battle vans, and exoskeletons, to hover jets, and giant mechs, and anything inbetween, The mainstory missions have a set selections of vehicals, with set weapons, that varys the level strategies, but with all the money you earn blowing anything up, and even for killing civilians, you can pay for different pilots, vehicals, and weapons to use in contract missions.

The visuals are perfect, retaining that oldschool sprite 2d style graphics, while adding in modern touches, like 360 degree veriable  rotation, instead of that lame 8 direction forcing you to go back and forth to hit the right angle.

Now, when you think about being a mech pilot you'd usually think Mechwarrior (or Steel Batallion) and naturally, a cockpit view. That's always seems like the way to go with games about giant walking battle machines, but have you ever thought about how much you are missing, with a camera fixed like that? In those 3d games, you are limited either to pilot's cockpit or to your mech's neares vicinity (in 3rd-person mode), with all interesting stuff left out as blips on the radar. Even if you're involved in some close combat, you don't really see more than a handful of enemy machines at once.

In Brigador, thanks to its isometric perspective, you can see everything around you. You also can take a peek a screen further. You see what you're doing, you see what your enemies are doing, nearly at all times - this allows you to take on lots, lots of enemy mechs at once. [spoiler]And you can also see your enemy unalerted and unsuspecting, which allows you to plan your surprise attack[/spoiler]

Realistic? No [spoiler]Well, nowadays one could imagine using a flying drone for the ""camera""[/spoiler] Fun? HELL YEAH! It really gives you feeling that a lot is going on.

Of course, you have a single digit chance of winning a battle against 20 or more machines in an open field. There are two things which can help you with that. First, your mech's special abilities: smoke grenades, EMP grenades, thermo-optical camo, audio-kinetic pulse - they differ from machine to machine (and can be swapped). Second, your environment: buildings, industrial facilities, plain old walls, lush forests - these will readilly take a hit for you. At which we come to another cool feature of Brigador - fully destructible environment. You can make a hole in almost any wall, make a nice pathway in any forest, or cork-open some apartment building with a side of your mech. The cool part about this is that destructions are very detailed, as all structures have multiple destructible sections with several damage levels, which surprisingly adds to the feeling of weight of your mech and the destructive power of its weapons. And it's always fun to dissect a factory in a half and see what's inside. But it's not a visual feature only - this allows you to try whatever tactics you want, whether it's luring your enemies out, sneaking up to them, bottlenecking them, retreating from them ASAP, gathering them up near a gas station and blowing it up, you name it.

The cool part about it is there are almost no encounters dragging on for too long. They are all short and violent, in a matter of a minute you either win, retreat or blow up.

Of course, the amount of possible tactics is limited to two main factors: your machine type and its equipment. Speaking of machines, Brigador goes above and beyond - you have bipedal mechs, hover tanks, normal tanks, armored cars, killdozers, and even a threaded motorcycle! Speaking of equipment, you have three slots: primary, secondary and special ability. Special abilities are limited to 4 types. The guns, however, are plentiful, as you have cannons, laser guns, railguns, howitzers, rocket launchers, mortars, machineguns of different caliber and effect.

So how to familiarize yourself with all this equipment and figure out best configurations? That's where we approach game modes. Brigador has two of them - campaign mode and freelance mode.

Campaign mode is where you play through the story missions, with 4 pre-defined vehicle configurations available for each. This is a good place to get familiar with all weapons and chassis, as well as the maps (and also earn some money for freelance mode). This is also where we come around the fact that Birgador has very oldschool composition - you select Campaign mode, then select a mission from a list, then select a mech. That's it. The story, if any, is in a text box to the right of the mission. Which is bad. On the other hand, if you're tired and all TL;DR, you can jump straight into action without any obstacles. Which is good. [spoiler]You can always read the story afterwards, after all. You also can unlock more lore and intel from Acquisitions menu[/spoiler]

Freelance mode is where you go all nuts with customization. You hire pilots, buy chassis, buy equipment, unlock missions and engage - pretty much everything you would like to do in a game about mechs. The only complaint here is that missions are procedurally generated and start on the easy side. If you come to freelance fresh from the end of campaign mode, and go with the first suggested pilot, you'll be wondering why all you have to do is fight human targets [spoiler]which of course are no challenge[/spoiler]. That's because the freelance mission difficulty is tied directly to the pilot's stats. So, pay attention to Start Difficulty, Max Difficulty and Increase Per Level stats of the pilots and pick the one that suits your skills.

Both modes reward you with multiple types of missions - stealth, heavy close quarters combar, hit and run missions, etc. The missions are not all about engaging the enemy, but also about managing your mech. This is especially true for the freelance mode, where you have to clear several goals on several maps in a single mech. Your hull, your shields and your ammo are limited. There are two main ways to restore ammo - from reloading stations on the map (which are guarded), and by scavenging your destroyed enemies (which needs some precision damage control). If you don't blow them up to the bits you can get their ammo and their shields for yourself. This is important to know, as you can easilly be left without any ammo in the middle of your operation. So lots of times you'll have to plan your shootouts and keep some balance during combat, all so you can disable enemy vehicles and get to them to replenish your shileds and guns. Try doing this during a combat with multiple machines for the most hardcore action.

To make your experience smoother, the game offers rebindable keys for keyboard, and rebindable buttons for your controller (which is a rare find these days)

Speaking of sound, firing your guns is very, very satisfying. Explosions and destuction sounds are also good. The music in game is your synthwave/retrowave mix - it's very upbeat, compells the gameplay well, and gets you in the mood very quick. Which is all it needs to be.

There are not to many games in the mech combat genre, and even less games which offer a level of fun, action and attention to detail Brigador offers. It makes even sadder the fact that this game could really use more sales, as at the time of review SteamSpy estimates it to be around 18k. If you ever thought that giant battle machines are cool, you should definetly give Brigador a try.

Devs have implemented alternative control schemes but recommend the original, so I've stuck with it.

A fantastically challenging isometric game of total annihilation.   Depth of game play including many different mechs, weapons, and levels of challenge.   Varied maps to play and overcome.  

To me, this harkens back to Bullfrog's Syndicate from 1993 - a cyberpunk-style thrill-a-thon, merciless and brutal, but instead of having a squad of mercs you'll tackle the levels with an assortment of vehicles.  An assortment of weapons (primary and secondary) plus defensive mechanisms, mixed and matched across several different chassis and control schemes.  The neon overtones and slick screen movement, combined with total devastation makes for a graphically enjoyable experience.

Top-notch soundtrack.  Great music, very much in the 'Outrun' or 80s synth style.  Never gets old.

Brigador is a quality product from an indie development team.  It's a game that plays wonderfully on my archaic beast of a computer, built some 8 years ago, and that's worth mentioning as not a lot of gamers have newer rigs.  A game that deserves more recognition and gameplay - but don't give up if you are frustrated with the controls at first - Brigador's control scheme is worth mastering.

The districts of Solo Nobre are hostile places, their inhabitants moreso. Be smart in the application of your firepower, lest you be buried under bodies and a storm of retaliatory fire.

This game has tank controls. Learn them. Love them. For goodness' sake, use a mouse and keyboard if you can; you'll have a much more pleasant time of things. Typically, it will take about an hour to get properly accustomed to them.

For those willing to invest the time and effort, you will be rewarded with a warcrimes simulator put together with care and attention and a tactical arcade shooter with a surprising amount of depth.

The only issues I, personally, have with the game are that the sound could be punchier in places and that the heavier vehicles are slow to traverse the larger maps, which can lead to a lot of dead time wandering about when you've cleared a sector of enemies. That second one is less of a complaint than an observation, though; that's just how it's going to be in those cases.


In conclusion: If you're willing to get over the initial learning curve, this game will handily provide you with hours of fun.

I'm on a laptop from 2010 and there's only a little bit of slowdown in real crowded situations.  that's neat.

The music pairs well with the experience, but would be fine on its own as well.  Its got a good electronic vibe to it.

The story and setting are neat and presented through dossier style snippets that beat the dogshit out of some weirdo beepity-boopin' into your speakers to tell it all to you in-mission.  

There are two ways to play, Campaign and Freelance.  Campaign has a little under thirty missions and you gotta do em in roughly the order theyre presented in to keep getting new ones.  In campaign you pick one of four prebuilt loadouts and go mess stuff up in whatever way is proscribed.  at the end of a mission you get some money.  Freelance is gated by the money.  you buy access to tanks and guns and piolits and missions and do them that way.  the freelance missions seem better and more fun.

It's fun as hell and offers incredible amounts of replay value and gameplay depth. There is an absolutely enormous amount of content, and everything is packed with detail.

The basic idea of the game is to pick a vehicle, a primary and secondary weapon, and then a special defensive weapon/feature, and go to town. You're getting paid based on how much destruction you dish out by a cold, calculating megacorp, the SNC, that has only one goal: conquest of Solo Nobre, a massive walled city where the game takes place. You must secure the city district-by-district via whatever means necessary, even if that means completely leveling the entire map (which is totally doable, and even encouraged!).

You are a Brigador -- basically a mercenary -- offered a contract by the SNC to use your firepower to help bring about the city's fall so that the corporation can swoop in and secure it. The backstory is really interesting, and it is pretty clear you are NOT playing the typical Good Guy™ role here, but it's not black-and-white either. You have to really read between the lines and come up with your own decision on whether you're playing as an opportunistic sociopath, a freedom-fighting liberator, or something in between. The level of detail put into both the story and the game is incredible.

▶ Gameplay

It's rare these days to find something that feels like it was totally designed around a ""wouldn't it be fun if..."" philosophy. Gameplay is what Brigador is all about, and where it truly shines. While I feel like I've mastered the mechanics, there is still a lot of exploring to do with loadouts. I really like the Randomize button for just that reason, and I often discover variants I wouldn't have picked out on my own. They can be pretty fun, too!

The feel of each vehicle is unique for the most part, with some overlap in designs between factions, but otherwise they all have a charm of their own and can serve different purposes. Though with the flexibility of the weapon hardpoints and similar weapon types per mount size, it's rare you can't make a vehicle do whatever you really want. Some just excel at certain things more than others.

The navigation / aiming system is simple and effective, easy to learn yet challenging to master. Sometimes it's tough to land shots on hovering vehicles (agravs) that get right up in your face, but that's one of the agrav's chief advantages: being a tough target to hit. So I think it works in the game's favor. Besides, your weapons are so over-the-top in terms of destructive power it's pretty rare you can't make short work of any single enemy that gets into your personal space. If you can't shoot it, blast the unholy hell out of it with the AK pulse, stomp it, smash it, or run it the hell over. Awesome.

Destruction is plentiful and encouraged as much as possible, which is the best. It sucks to have an environment that is leveled so beautifully and then be penalized for collateral damage. Instead, the opposite happens, and you actually get a payout bonus from your shadowy benefactors based on how much devastation you dish out. Dystopian as all hell, and got a good laugh out of me. Similarly, when I was seeing mention of ""purchase the terms and conditions for more information"" lines, I got a kick out of that too. But then I noticed that you can literally buy access to the terms and conditions of your contract and just about died. It's perfect. And even better, the contract reads believably, too. It's obviously worded in a way that benefits the megacorp over you, but not so much that you wouldn't take the job anyway. After all, for a Brigador, what's a reward without a little risk, right? Superb writing across the board. Though an aside from gameplay, it's a core part of what makes Brigador go from a fun game to a truly fantastic overall experience for me.

Managing difficulty level via the pilot system is clever. When freelancing (i.e. not playing in the structured campaign mode), you pick your loadout, but also your pilot. The pilot determines the difficulty level, and in turn, the payout bonuses (higher difficulty = make better money). It took me a little bit to figure out what was going on, but by the time I'd finished the campaign, it made perfect sense. I only wish you could specify a default pilot, or select a roster for randomizing so that you -- for example -- always stick to the max-diff pilot if you want balls-out challenge every single time. And while it isn't a big deal, lower-tier pilots aren't worthwhile once you have mastered the game. It also doesn't feel like there's a huge amount of difference between pilots, unlike the vehicles and weapons, save for the extremes. I enjoyed unlocking pilots more for the lore than for their function. But for a new player, the difficulty curve is generously gentle. You have a lot of time to get used to things before going all-in, if you ever choose to do so.


▶ Visuals

Love them. The amount of detail crammed into each map is astounding considering how BIG they are and how MANY there are. It must have taken ages to finish a single one, let alone all... what, 20+ of them? And while lots of assets are reused frequently, they are done in clever ways so you hardly even notice it. Even though the levels look very similar via the art style, none look like they're the same. Leaving the place littered with persistent debris is a fun, satisfying way to finish a mission.

The UI is superb as well. I appreciated even the little unnecessary details, like seeing a white dash in the scroll bar if you went past your selection on the page. And I am glad the UI is quick, snappy, and responsive. I hate it when UIs get all fancy but slow down functionality. Not here!


▶ Sound

Excellent. Soundtrack is fantastic, SFX are great. All the gun sounds feel about right. Vehicle movement sounds are good, though the large mech footfalls seem a bit weak. Sounds like they're stepping on crunchy grass rather than dropping tons of force onto the ground.

The music is wonderful, but it doesn't play forever! It seems to fade out completely once you complete all objectives. Sometimes I like to fly around and just destroy stuff (because it's so satisfying to level everything), and it isn't as fun when there's only silence. Fortunately, you can buy the soundtrack which includes everything ingame and some extras, and just play that in the background with Winamp or what have you. Problem solved!


▶ Modding

[UPDATE] An official modkit has released, which makes it possible to create new vehicles, weapons, environment props, etc. -- basically, pretty much anything except custom SFX is supported now! It's wonderful. Infinite replay value achieved. You can also modify the stats for existing enemies, weapons, vehicles, and more with the developer console right in the game. Testing changes is extremely easy with the provided dev tools.

As if that's not enough, there's also a level editor (an instance of Tiled, which is really easy to use) you can use to make campaign or freelance missions. So, so happy with this game, even nearly 2 years later.


Overall? Absolutely get it if you are interested. Chances are, you'll find a way to enjoy the game, and if it gets too easy for you (which seems to be rare for most players), you can crank it up to absurd degrees with mods. The soundtrack and audiobook are also worth a grab, so I say get the full package.

Now, don't get me wrong. It's a relatively charming game, it looks nice and the OST is great, what writing there is, has a bit of humour to it, and is generally quite well-done, but the fact of the matter is that there are really only two missions or so to play.

Sure, they vary the levels, the loadouts and the enemies but... it's basically all the same. I think there's essentially all of one mission that flips things a bit(by having you start with no ammo), but that's as imaginative as the creators get. Every mission is about blowing up X items that are either mobile or stationary, and fighting back or not fighting back. You pick a mech and its loadout, you're off to the races, and then ten minutes later you're back at the menu.

And there's about 25 missions of this, so ultimately not much actual game unless you count the pretty boring ""freelance"" mode that has even less context to make things interesting, or the fact that you have four different potential loadouts for a given mission as varied options.

Additionally, the controls feel a bit rough at times(the facing seems weirdly unwilling to automatically face the way you're going, so you often have to manually wrangle it into place), and it's sometimes hard to tell what you're actually going to hit. Not a problem because there are any friendlies or neutrals you mustn't blow up, but just sort a bit annoying in terms of actually hitting badguys before they hit you.

So, really, if the game and OST were ten bucks combined, I'd call it a good deal. At any higher price, unless they're planning to expand with a LOT more free content(and not just more of the same, but stuff that actually VARIES the missions and setups in interesting ways), it's not very well-priced for what you're getting.

I WOULD like to see more content from the creators, though, and if they make any more games, I'd likely give them a shot, because the writing suggests that they've got good ideas.",1487699605,1487699605,False,14,0,0.540691256523132324,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The campaign is a collection of missions with vehicles/loadouts locked in. Try to beat it with this loadout x4 for each mission. You then spend money to unlock weapons, vehicles, pilots, maps, for the freelance missions. In these you can loadout however you want with what you have unlocked.

My only complaint is that the game is a little too freeform for my personal taste. I'd really like a proper campaign with customizable loadouts, perhaps a hub/base, and some sort of risk on failed missions. Build up a fleet of mechs and risk them on missions, that sort of thing.

- A freelance mode that lets you play with your own combination of pilot, vehicle, and weapons on the operation of your choosing.
- Your choice of pilot affects the difficulty level minimum and maximum, and how it scales across the maps, as well as your final payout.
- A ton of great looking and interesting vehicles. My favorite style are the Corvid vehicles which are repurposed junk war machines like the Killdozer and a giant stack of rolling cars named the Treehouse.
- A wide variety of weaponry and a handful of special equipment to equip your vehicles with.
- The writing is so impressive. It's a well-realized world and the write-ups of the pilots, the technology, the locations, and everything is so well-done.

Between the three vehicle types, mechs and tanks make slight sense and the hover vehicles make NO sense (the control direction is ENTIRELY relative to where the mouse is pointing, which is simply hoirrible).  Aiming is terribly inconsistent; you can have the cursor directly over a target and shots won't do anything; conversely, some shots will hit anything in their path, but there's no indication of why.  So it's a shooter where movement sucks and aiming is uncertain, but the enemies have no trouble hitting you.

In short, it's a recipe for consistent annoyance and frequent misery, given that every map is an enormous mass of obstacles that bring you to a screeching halt if you don't avoid them and the devs decided to give you some of the most tremendously bad controls imaginable.  The challenge of the game is not beating the enemies, it's simply trying to make any sense whatsoever of these wretched controls.

There is utterly, utterly no reason whatsoever that WASD shouldn't move the player in the logical directions and the mouse aims, other than the devs decided not to bother with thinking up any sort of creative ways to put difficulty in the game.  It's a standard control scheme for a top-down shooter at this point for the simple reason THAT IT WORKS and it doesn't drive players insane.

I would enjoy this game quite a bit if the controls were anything resembling modern, workable controls, but it ends up being a huge fatal flaw that saps all the enjoyment out of the game.  It's in no way a matter of ""learn to play"" difficulty, and 100% an issue of bad design.

UPDATE: Devs responded to my criticisms of the game and politely pointed out the (somewhat buried) option to change the orientation of the controls (there are multiple control types for the different vehicles, you gotta know that ""screen absolute"" is the antigrav option that actually makes some sense and isn't miserable).

Improved my experience enormously, and I would readily recommend the game at this point without any reservation.

Brigador is a fascinatingly complex game. Once you wrap your head around the controls, it feels great.  An isoMECHtric camera angle blends the fun of an old school shooter with strategic maneuvers. There's two primary game modes in Brigador, campaign and freelance.  The campaign introduces you to the concepts of the game. Pick a mech/vehicle, slap guns on, and go destroy. Going more in depth there are several different vehicles all with pros and cons. Tank like vehicles and some bipedal mechs use tank controls, it might feel strange at first. There's also free controlling vehicles that give it more of a twin stick vibe. 

In the campaign you choose a mission and one of five pre-selected mechs. The missions themselves don't vary too much. It's more the loudout you pick that has an effect on completing the same objective in a different way. The selected mechs make it less of an undertaking. It's easy to jump in and see what works for you. Completing four missions unlocks four more and so on. It also nets you money that can be spent in the games more customizable mode, freelance.

Every loadout has a primary, secondary, and special weapon with a cooldown. Your primary and secondary take ammo that can be gathered at support stations or off dead enemies. There are several different types including gaiting guns, lasers, and cannons. Each one with an ammo cap and specific stats rate of fire, power, etc.  The special weapons are reserved for a more tactical approach. Smoke can obscure a group of enemies view allowing you to light them up, or active camo to sneak up on your targets before they raise an alarm. Depending on what kind of vehicle your using you have either a bull rush or stomp to get through any pesy buildings in your way.

Freelance mode is where you'll spend currency from your campaign. Every aspect is customizable in freelance mode. Your pilot determines the min/max amount of difficulty on missions. The base of your vehicle for how you want it to control. And of course primary, secondary, and special weapons. Even the missions cost currency to unlock. Thankfully the campaign is very generous with money, as well as being replayable.  Freelance modes missions work much like the campaigns, but it has a heavy focus on how to approach them that keeps things interesting.

Brigador is not an easy game by any means.  Most of my time was spent with a mouse and keyboard.  It does have game pad support, but I found the precision of a mouse kept me alive a little longer. Another thing that did make things a little easy to understand was game speed. The game speed option in the menu is incredible for just understanding movement patterns. I found a comfort zone around 75 and slowly bumped it up. Just to clarify, everything in the game slows down including you.

The soundtrack has a heart throbbing 80's synth vibe. It's probably one of my favorite OST's. It's great and making you feel relaxed, but then intense if things start to go bad.

The main reason I wanted to post this was the main complaint featured in the negative comments about this game: the controls. Many of the mechs in this game feature TANK CONTROLS which is very different than the standard WASD, left moves left, etc. control scheme. With tank controls, forward moves you straight where your vehicle is aiming while A and D turn the mech left and right instead of strafing. These controls are hard to figure out at first but are quick to get used to.

[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]

[b]Brigador[/b] is ostensibly a twin stick shooter, at least in terms of quickly describing it. It starts out with some rather overwhelming tutorials regarding the various types of mechs, tanks and hovercrafts. Each controlled very differently however in the options there are various control schemes. And unless you're adept at quickly acquiring targets whilst using tank controls, meaning forward is relative to the orientation of the mech I highly suggest switching the controls to Screen absolute. Essentially making it behave like a twin stick shooter except for the really small turret ones that can't turn all the way around. 

There is a number of other tweaks such as being able to toggle the forward facing function to follow the mouse or crosshair automatically rather than needing to hold it as you move about. 

There are buildings aside from the objectives such as comm towers and other resource type things that as an example, when destroyed, will have less enemies spawn if the city is alerted. As well as have the guard barriers not erect as soon. But in my experience I never really had a real reason to do so. I basically looked for the tower holding the type of ammo I had and where it was on the map and just kept that in mind. In fact, due to it keeping track of each vehicle for each level, you get to know each map pretty well. You have to be pretty fast and loose especially with smaller mechs whilst being conservative and trying not to dive directly into enemy territory. 

In my honest gut feeling. I think this game may have been better served as a rogue-like. Using the money to upgrade your own customized mech from the get go as you trounce through Sola Nobre rather than save that aspect for the freelance mode which feels a lot like an afterthought. 

However, in freelance mode. There is still a definite progression. The difficulty and rewards being affected by the pilot and mission choice and each chassis being able to equip a variety of weaponry to your liking. All must be requisitioned by purchasing with money earned from completing other missions or indeed through failure by which far less money is earned. 

Something I really like however is the fact that each weapon has a unique arc. The weapons as well as vehicles both traverse and react with the environment in very interesting ways. For instance, if you're using a weapon like a mortar, not only is your aim affected by the direction of the mech or vehicle but by the inertia of it as well; Reflected in the targeting beam. 

[b]THE GIST
This game is extremely pleasing and very interesting to look at. It can be very fun especially when used as a what I'd call a “podcast” game (though it does have a very nice OST) I just feel like something is missing from keeping it from being the glorious game it could be.[/b]

Fully destructible environment, which actually matters. 
Lots of different mechs, tanks and weapons to choose from, some causing massive erections and leveling cities - at once. 
Tailoring difficulty to your liking, with higher difficulties offering higher payout. 
Once you get around the basics, like which buildings blow up (very important) and which robots fuck you up the hardest or are able to outright one-shot you (expect many ragequits over this and ninja suicide bombers), the game becomes highly addictive and replayable with custom kinda-randomized missions. 
Aiming especially feels so damn good once you master it, just landing those artillery shots, oh boy, or equipping double BRRRT Gatling guns - the gun sounds and sounds in general are also really great. 
Game being tactical focused doesn't mean there aren't situations where you just hold both triggers and pray for your life or desperately try to hide with the cloak ability. But usually you should stray away from alerting huge groups of enemies, of which there are plenty on a map, a big plus.
 
One thing that grinds my gears is the music, I expected more of an industrial or maybe even some metal soundtrack, I mean, what's more metal than creating cover out of your enemies' husks and stomping over innocent civilians? Maybe I just got tired of the synthwave schtick in every indie game, but it really didn't strike me as fitting here. Though you can just play your own, so it's not that big of a deal.

You have a light machine gun mounted to one arm, a light-caliber cannon in the other, a stolen Spacer camo system, and an Opportunity. Nobody knows you're there. Your targets are waiting in a country chalet. Overwhelming firepower guards them. You have made entrance to the district undetected, and you have an overview of the situation, courtesy of your employers. You sneak through the forest, knock down a hedge with your legs, forge your own path. You are still undetected. An enormous tank idles in front of the villa; its hardshields are lowered. They weren't expecting you. You aim between the trees, put an 84mm Carlos round in it, and it comes out the other side. The tank stops idling. Two scout vehicles approach from the other direction, attracted by the noise. You pepper them with 8mm Bonesaw rounds and they stop investigating. Your Carlos's autoloader slams a new shell into the breech and locks. You put your second cannon round of the day through the palatial house, blasting it to smithereens. Heavy tanks approach from the east. You flip the switch on your optic camo system; it buzzes to life, and you disappear into the underbrush. Three more targets to go.

You are Arturo Nemi, to make it simple; your body came with that name. You are a Brigador piloting an Arlo. Your Auxilliary hardpoint is fitted with a Broiler multi-discharge laser. Your Small hardpoint is fitted with a Black Hand. Something resembling a megaphone on steroids is fitted to the side mount. You like it that way. It's flexible. Your contract is freeform: it requires you to do as much damage as possible to forward the SNC's interests, which happen to align with your own. You cruise *through* the slums of Solo Nobre, using your agrav's hull to smash a tunnel towards your objective.  A running tally of casualties and your payout for same updates in the corner of your vision. You're going for the big money, though. An orbital gun towers in front of you; mechs and agravs surround it. You close in behind a wall, and activate your audiokinetic pulse; you hear a tremendous echoing roar, bouncing off everything around you, and the orbital gun and everything around it start to crumble, followed immediately by an echoing explosion. You hear loud footsteps, approaching rapidly from around a corner, and aim your Black Hand at the wall; you see nothing, but a crackling hiss emits from it as you command it to fire. You watch with detached interest as the civilians running from your machine slump over, twitching and screaming, and the mechanical footsteps become erratic and stop. You pull around the corner and blast the stragglers' hulls to pieces with your Broiler. Three more guns to go.

You are Johnny Five Aces, legend of the timestream, renowned pilot of every sort of vehicle, legendary shot with a revolver, and renowned dapper gentleman. You are driving a Treehouse, a terrifying agglomeration of cars and tanks, thirty feet tall. You have a Ploughman 132mm chemical munitions launcher, aimed by a pair of steering wheels on your left, and a König 30mm rotary autocannon (known by another name, long ago), aimed by another pair on your right; you also have a smoke grenade launcher, but hiding is for dishonorable cowards. You grind your way into a necropolis, turning tombstones to powder underneath your treads. A scout spots you, and radios for backup. Dozens of huge walkers and heavy tanks come into view, bringing their guns to bear. You hold down the trigger of your König and furiously crank the traverse across them, filling them with depleted uranium. You hear a series of deafening cracks, and another, closer one from your hardshields as your generator shorts out; pivoting your vehicle, you see Mantis mechs, Loyalists with Galinha railguns, already far too close, followed by Touros and a few Mongoose pilots in suits. You aim the Ploughman at the Mantises, fire, and advance into the ominous white cloud toward the mechs behind them. A horrible creak emits from below you, as your Treehouse starts to melt; you've made a terrible mistake. The windshield of the station wagon-turned-cockpit pits and flows away, dissolved by the Tubarão; you are next, as the vapor drifts into your cockpit. Like a ball pushed off the edge of a cliff, you scream as the Treehouse is transformed back into the raw materials it was built from (scrap metal). You will never see Nina again, nor engage in cosmos-shattering intercourse with her, because you have died.

Welcome, Brigador.

Brigador's controls take a little while to get used to, especially if you haven't played an isometric game in a long time. I recommend binding a mouse button to ""align to mouse""; it'll become second-nature quickly. The gameplay is both tactically and strategically deep, and extremely fun. The lore is both fascinating and well-written; the pilots have bios, the weapons and vehicles have intel summaries written like a technical manual, and there's plenty of other information to unlock as you earn the money to do so. I hear there's a novel and I'm looking forward to checking it out.

Con: This game has a problem visibility considering that it has destructable structures and some structures can cause damaging explosions.

Brigador involves fast paced, but still tactical, combat. There are many different enemy types, with separate armaments and styles, and you have to engage in a rapid fire series of decisions of deciding who to hit, what angle to approach from, how to maneuver or position yourself to minimize the fire you take, when and how to pull back. You'll be fighting diverse clumps of a dozen (or often, even more) enemies, having to work out how you're going to beat them all. The game gives you these tools and is hard enough to require you to use them. It's very viscerally awarding, when you fight a clump of enemies and cut them all down.

There's a lot of different little factors that go into how the fights play that it feels [i]wonderful[/i], and the game has a very high skill ceiling and easily scaled difficulty. There's the obvious choices you make when loading out for a Freelance run - Will you go light and fragile or heavy and slow? Which pilot do you want, as they set the spawn lists? - and there's also the option to turn down the game speed to up to 50% its normal pace, making the breakneck speed of the fights a little slower and giving you more room to think and breathe.

The game's play modes are wide - lots of options available to you that don't take a long time to complete individually - but there's a ton of depth to the actual raw play experience. As such, whether you want a deep experience you can really dive into, or something to play for twenty minutes before work, the game can do that.

Overall, I can't recommend the game enough. It's fantastic, one of my single most played games ever.

That said, the game is extremely light on story content, in that, there's basically none of it. No voice acting, no storyline, just text and descriptive info. ""You are a mercenary. There are some guys we want dead in this place for some reason. Go and make them dead."" Then you're dropped into the stage.

Gameplay is quick-paced and challenging but very fun, with almost everything in the game being a destructible object.

Brigador is the spiritual successor of MechWarrior (for the SNES) and LAPD Future Cop.

It's been a while since I've played an isometric shooter similar to (and at the same time being as good as) Brigador.  When I first saw this game on my ""games to keep an eye on"" radar, I instantly thought of GT Interactive's [i][b]Bedlam[/b][/i] from waaaaaay back in '96. So, I finally got around to buying it, and it took me a little time to ""settle in"", as it were, but since then I've become addicted! After having played Brigador for a few hours, I must say... YES! FINALLY!

I've always thought isometric shooters/brawlers that are set to this scale are really cool if they stick to and expand upon the genre-defining gameplay mechanics that can make these games so much fun to play. 

First of which (in my mind) is [b]fully destructable environments(!)[/b]. Acknowledging that every on-screen asset can be smashed, crushed, vaporised or blown into even smaller pixels gives one a great deal of satisfaction! [i]King of the Monsters[/i], the aforementioned [i]Bedlam[/i], a little sprinkling of [i]Mech Commander 2[/i] and the somewhat recent [i]Kaiju-A-GoGo[/i] have all given me a similar feeling gameplay wise. Visually, these games are nowhere near the same level of detail as Brigador (obviously), since most of these titles are quite dated in this day and age. It's just more proof that the current number of games in this somewhat niche genre is sorely lacking, unfortunately. 

Second most important (IMHO); a fully fleshed-out world with unique locales/scenery/whatnot (that you will, again, inevitably destroy along the way... muahahahaha!).

Brigador has all of this, en masse! The campaign is reasonably long and with a decent storyline. There's also endless mayhem to be had playing in freelance mode, earning money from missions that you can then spend on customising your mech, a-grav or tracked vehicle. Choose pilots (each with their own interesting bio), primary and secondary weapons, defensive loadout, mission area(s) and you're good to go! Then there's the soundtrack... I'm a sound designer/engineer by trade, so... someone restrain me before I write another paragraph of text.

Critique? Personally, I have none with Brigador (I may be biased). It has lived up to and gone beyond my expectations for something I purchased during this years winter sale. I cannot deny that I read other reviews and comments about the control scheme being ""unintuitive"" before I bought it. As I mentioned earlier, I freely admit that it took me a few minutes to get used to movement and firing in Brigador, even after having tried every configuration available in the setup menu coupled together with my brains vast mech gaming experience that has been accumulating in my cranium since the early 80's. I ended up going back to using the default control scheme, as I believe one should really try playing a game the way the developer intends it to be played. It shouldn't take long before you are effectively stomping around Solo Nobre in your deathmachine and blasting OpFor into bite-size chunks.",1483557662,1483558973,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I mean, 70 on metacritic, come on !

Brigador remind me a good deal of some games who were pretty good : Future cop LAPD, Crusader no remorse/regret and, of course, Mechwarrior.
And that's a very good thing, because I loved those games !

I heard of Brigador completly by accident by first seeing a .webm on a certain chinese basket weaving imageboard. That little video clip lasted less than 10 secondes but I was blown away by how cool and good looking that game seemed to be, I had to try it and I wasn't disappointed. Oh no !

First of all, Brigador is incredibly gorgeous. The designers really made an excellent job on all the vehicules and the maps.
I can only regret the absence of an in game zoom to bath myself in those gorgeous pixels (I know you can zoom in via the dev console, but it's far less intituitive than just mouse scroll to control the zoom level whenever you want).

Second of all, The music is really nice. I mean really, REALLY nice. Makeup and Vanity Set not only made an excellent soundtrack but it also fit the game ambiance incredibly well.

And finally, the difficulty : the game pretty much let you decide how hard you want it to be. You're not too good ? Choose the biggest vehicle in the campaign or in Freelance, jump into the Lowmill equiped with a Köning and a Chieftain + AK pulse and watch everything melt before your eyes in a very satisfying manner.
Want some unreasonable challenge ? Jump into the Varlet (once unlocked, that can honestly take some time) equipped with a Blackhand and Lockdown to sneak your way between enemy vehicle that will blast you to oblivion with pathetic ease.

Granted, the game takes a little time to adapt to it's peculiar movement and aiming but it's all worth it. Hell, even the tidbits of lore you unlock are great, the universe is interesting and the lore behind the vehicle and weapons is written well enough to make it engaging. On a sidenote, I was quite amused by how ANCAP this universe is, you seriously have to BUY the terms and agreements of YOUR contract. Nevertheless, breaking the NAP has never been more fun.

If I had a little critic to do it's about the aiming, when it's blasting and exploding everywhere it's not always very easy to clearly see where you're aiming and it's quite a problem with slow shooting weapons. The same problem applies to shooting AGRAV, depending on their orientation it's either very easy to shoot them or very painful.
Oh, well this little trouble is easily forgotten in the face of such an amazing game.",1483492987,1511647087,True,6,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can't really say much that hasn't already been said, however I will say that Brigador is simply incredible. The setting is a unique take on a sort of cyberpunk-corporate-dystopia, which reminds me of films such as Bladerunner, or Alien, among others. The soundtrack has a synth-heavy pulse that matches the mood and visuals of the game perfectly, quite similar to soundtrack work by John Carpenter, or Tangerine Dream, which seems fitting given the dark futuristic world of Brigador. The aesthetics of the game are damned-near perfect to me.

Gameplay has a bit of a learning curve, I will admit. I was lumbering around in my starting mech, fairly lost as to how to wrangle in the big bastard... But after a few tweaks of the controller layout in the options I was good to go, and never looked back. Aside from that, combat feels great, annihilating everything in my path with an Otomo laser is just rewarding as hell. Blasting thru affluent neighborhoods with a Zeus railgun never felt more RIGHT, ever. Just the staggering amount of variety in vehicles, weapons, and auxiliary equipment make the game very re-playable. Combine that with the freelance mode, and I'm sure I'll be putting in at least another 28 hours into Brigador, if not countless more.

Lastly, I'll touch on 2 things: The graphics, and the lore of the game. The graphics are insanely detailed, and the isometric world incredibly realized. The game devs really nailed the look in this one, it's got character for days. I really can't do it justice in words how beautifully crafted this gritty world truly is. Secondly, the lore is fascinating, I find myself reading every bit of info on each new mech, agrav, weapon, pilot, you name it, simply to immerse myself in, and understand this world even more. It really is well done, to me anyway. The little touches, bits of Intel, and back-story, really give you the sense of care that went into this game. The game is very cohesive, with each element complimenting the others very well.

I expect lots of buildings and tanks and people to tower over, and I expect to stomp them with reckless abandon. Brigador understands this, appreciates this, and serves it up with exactly one caveat: It will not be reckless. You will annihilate columns of tanks, regiments of infantry, and entire city blocks, but only if you are careful and smart about it. In other words, they took the concept of mechs and made what could be the best possible game with them.

Brigador opens with harsh neon, heavy synth, and the words GREAT LEADER IS DEAD - SOLO NOBRE MUST FALL. Indeed, the brutal dictator of a remote colony world is no more, and a certain megacorp is paying big bucks to make sure no one fills the vacuum he left. That's where you come in, taking on lucrative contracts to destroy the city's defenses and infrastructure, wipe out the factions vying for control, and crush every last vestige of Great Leader's reign. It's a big job, and luckily you have a mind-boggling assortment of mechs, tanks, hoverships, and giant-ass guns to get it done.

If this setup sounds dystopian as fuck to you, you're in the right place. Solo Nobre is the quintessential cyberpunk hellhole and it makes all the difference in the world to the feel of the game. The maps you'll be stomping across are cluttered industrial parks, blocks of neon bars and dives, posh walled communities, muddy slums of lean-tos and row houses, necropolises of towering stone mausoleums and unmarked graves, and bustling, shining spaceports. Every road and building and tree is rendered in incredible, pixel-perfect detail just like they used to do in those halcyon days of SVGA 2D games.

All of this is here for you to level the absolute shit out of. Every mission is a contract between you and the Solo Nobre Concern (complete with delicious legalese flavor text) to take out important targets such as orbital guns, enemy captains, or statues of Great Dead Leader. You'll start in one corner of the map in your chosen vehicle, and you'll have to make your way through the dense cityscape and dozens of enemy units to take it out. Literally everything is destructable, from the tallest buildings to the tiniest bench.

It's the perfect setup for mayhem but like I mentioned, you have to be smart about it. Brigador is not the arcadey playground it may appear, because stomping around and blasting mindlessly will get you killed very, very fast. Depending on your chosen mech you may or may not be the toughest thing on the field, but you'll always be outnumbered. Fortunately, Brigador has some of the most well-designed enemy behavior ever seen in a game like this. While you enjoy an isometric birds-eye view, your enemies all rely on lines of sight, audio cues, and a little bit of patrolling logic. Charging into battle head-on will get you blown away but you can actually sneak behind high walls, crouch behind trees and containers, distract enemies with remote explosions, lose them in twisting streets, and even trick them into blowing each other up.

You have plenty of tools to accomplish all this, but they are limited in use. Your vehicle carries two weapons with limited ammo, a defensive option like smoke shells or optical cloak on a cooldown, and a melee attack like stomping or bull rushing. Every resource must be used to get through missions, to keep enemy groups manageable or to escape a trap or just to not run out of ammo. There are depots around the map to refill the four possible kinds of ammo, and enemies drop pickups as well, but your base pool is usually limited so you need to make every shot count. That can be tricky with the surprisingly technical aiming system that takes into account firing arcs and momentum, but once you get the hang of it every dead-on howitzer shell is going to feel like Christmas.

Even trickier is going to be the movement system, and this is likely where the steepest learning curve is. All of your movement with WASD is relative to your vehicle's facing, not the screen. It's tank controls not seen since the heady days of Crusader: No Remorse and to be fair, it gives you just as fine control here as it does there. But honestly this control scheme died out for a reason, because it's just harder to process than screen-relative or absolute controls. The developers wisely understand this and have added options not only for absolute controls but ALSO for slowing down the game itself to give time to process the moves you want to make. Personally I've been sticking with the original settings and while I'm still warming up to them, I've gotten through a lot of missions with them.

On the subject of gameplay, you'll be hard-pressed to run out if you dig the mech-mayhem on offer here. There's a lengthy campaign that starts with some decent tutorials that cover JUST the basics and then spirals off into contracts to wipe out commanders and whole districts of enemies. Each mission offers four pre-set loadouts to use of varying challenge levels, but overall the game gets HARD by the halfway point. Brigador does not hold back in any way; I've dealt with a mission where you start with no ammo in a cramped space with one-shot suicide rockets, and a mission where you have to get past an army of huge sentry bots in little more than a motorcycle. They're viciously difficult and took like 20 tries to beat, but honestly I can't say I didn't enjoy every attempt, blowing up and dying in exciting new ways every time.

The campaign earns you money to unlock new assets in freelance mode, which is honestly where you should be spending most of your time. Freelance mode puts every single mech, tank, a-grav, gun, defense option, and pilot at your disposal to remix into whatever chaotic monstrosity you want to challenge yourself with. With enough money you can build acid-launching chicken walkers, mortar-slinging party vans, microwave-shooting motorbikes, and towering amalgamations of cars topped with train cannons. These can be sent into multi-map contracts where your ammo and damage carry over between maps, and sometimes you can cash out early if things go south. It's a thrilling and almost overwhelming mode because of all the choices you have and new combinations to learn, but it will last you literally forever.

All of this is wrapped in one of the slickest, most cohesive packages I have ever seen. Brigador deserves accolades for a lot of things but nothing as much as their absolutely spot-on cyberpunk dystopia. Solo Nobre is fully realized as a functional, logical hell of corporate interests and guerilla intrigue, fleshed out with well-written snippets of lore and dialogue for every contract, map, vehicle, and faction in the game. The graphics evoke the best parts of dark, powerful technology crashing against human concerns, and the throbbing synth soundtrack is the ultimate icing on the neon cake. Wherever you're coming from, whether it be Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell or Shadowrun, you're going to feel at home, and you aren't going to want to leave. Brigador is the perfect intersection of mech combat, dystopian themes, and technical gameplay, forming a title that really should be seen as a landmark in the genre.

They made Brigador even better and I didn't think that was possible. I don't think I'll ever be uninstalling this game.

Brigador is the isometric mech game I never knew I wanted and it delivered on nearly all fronts. I have very few complaints about this game. It knows how to make a person feel like they’re piloting a big, intimidating mech, capable of destroying everything around it, but the other vehicles know how to deliver a great experience too. This game is a well-rounded package that should please many people.

First off, the killer soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set is amazing. It alone might be worth the price of the OST + Audiobook edition for some people. The tunes immerse you in the 80’s and make the entire experience of tactically or recklessly destroy specific buildings and groups of enemies really pleasant. Prepare to hear synth and electronic instruments that fit the game like a glove. You can expect to own 24 songs across two volumes and another 8 in the EP folder.

Brigador has a 21 mission campaign that has had more missions added to it since the developer loves updating its game. The whole thing should take around 4 hours if you play to beat it without trying to use all the vehicles for each map. Each mission allows you to choose from a pool of four vehicles that offer different playstyles and difficulty. The mechs can brace themselves for punishment and take a beating while the Party Van needs to have a nimble pilot to stay alive. I definitely preferred the heavier vehicles that could take a beating since I couldn’t grasp “maneuver warfare.”

Some of the vehicles were beyond my skill level on the default settings, but that didn’t bother me. I wanted to keep playing the game at 100% speed and became used to the controls quickly enough since it felt like an isometric Mechwarrior game. Those tank controls are what I found easiest to use to make sure I kept my front towards my enemy since facing plays an important role in staying alive. Letting the faster enemies flank you usually means death or sustaining a huge amount of damage. Feel free to tinker with the options if you have trouble though since the developer made accommodations for other players with different control schemes and the ability to adjust the speed of the game from 60-100%. You can also use a controller with the game.

The gameplay itself is satisfying and challenging. Stray bullets damage the environment, leaving parts of the map completely demolished depending on the kind of player you are. You have to account for facing, weapon arcs + momentum, positioning, enemy type since the fast ones love to flank, and when to use your defensive ability which can be active camo or a destructive pulse wave. You can even use explosions to lure the enemy to that area while you make your escape or prepare a devastating ambush. The huge weapon variety keeps the game from becoming stale as different vehicles have different loadouts. Vehicles come equipped with two regular weapons, a defensive/special ability, and one or two utility skills depending on the type. For example, Mechs can stomp on the ground or crouch to significantly reduce damage.

As you can imagine, buildings and enemies don’t stand a chance against all the firepower and the game makes it all look good. I love using artillery that splits into more projectiles that completely wipe out city blocks. It’s quite the sight. Everything can be destroyed except the ground and district walls which usually mark the borders of the huge maps. It’s extremely satisfying and slightly irresponsible to let loose on enemies behind cover with high environmental damage weapons like artillery, chain guns, or other heavy weapons. Just make sure you leave some buildings standing for yourself in case of a tactical retreat. There are plenty of environments to demolish too that go beyond the campaign mode.

Freelance and Acquisitions mode go hand in hand. Every dollar you earn in the campaign or Freelance goes to unlocking things in Acquisitions which means more stuff for experimentation in Freelance unless you’re buying Lore. For your convenience, you can also unlock new items while in the Freelance menu. It’s the mode where you can really modify your experience all the way down to the pilot. Pilots determine the difficulty and reward multiplier that the operation will have which consists of multiple districts (maps). You can then choose your vehicle, primary weapon, secondary weapon, a special ability (smoke grenades, pulse wave, active camo, EMP), and the operation. It’s generally a great time and maybe I’ll be brave enough to use the smaller vehicles, but I’ve been content with trying out the various heavy weapons in the Rat King which is the biggest mech I could find. The only limit in Freelance is your wallet which shouldn’t be a problem. The maps aren’t just recycled from the campaign, but you can run through the whole thing in one go if you buy the operation for it.

The game doesn’t have a traditional narrative. Instead, each mission will have some text details when selecting one. The game’s creator also states that the game itself focuses more on world building versus telling a story. Every single thing unlocked in the game through Acquisitions has a description which is how you find out more about the world of Brigador and its people. I especially liked the pilot stories and vehicle descriptions. Alternatively, if you dish out the extra money, then the audiobook can fill you in on the events prior and after the Great Leader’s fall from a different perspective. The dozens upon dozens of unlocks should provide more than enough information by themselves though, so don’t feel as if you’re missing out. You’re here to blow things up anyway.

The audiobook is there though so I’ll talk a little about it. I’m not used to critiquing books or audiobooks, but I have enjoyed what I listened to so far which was about seven chapters. I found the flowery language for warfare fairly pleasing. “Tortured metal” “glittering cloud of jagged shrapnel” and “burst bags of blood” are some examples of the combat writing. What I liked most about the audiobook was how it fleshed out the world even more since it covers the events that happen right before the revolution and after. You also gain a much better understanding of the chaos that the Brigador contracts created since those lucrative contracts proved too alluring for even some of the Great Leader’s army. The story mostly follows the carnage-filled tale of a patrol squad as they deal with the unexpected rebellion which takes place at the same time as the game’s campaign. It’s definitely a giant war story.

Brigador is an excellent mech experience and one I plan to revisit every now and then when I have a craving, either for battle or synths. Players that have trouble with the default controls have other options available to them, so give those a go before requesting a refund. It’s an extremely high quality game with an astonishingly low number of owners when I took a peek at SteamSpy numbers, so if you’re interested in gritty vehicular warfare… Welcome, Brigador.",1483007977,1497000317,True,35,0,0.756451249122619629,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game supports a variety of playstyles - scoot and shoot, stealth mofo, big strong independent robot that don't need no cover and MAXIMUM CIVILIAN WARCRIMES MODE, among others.
While there's a campaign mode, where every mission (basically one big puzzle) can be tackled with four different loadouts, the real meat of the game is Freelance mode, in which you'll spend your hard-earned cash to buy new pilots, mechs and warcrime devic- I mean, weapons, to tackle a succession of up to 29 maps in a row. 

The beautifully-crafted environment is fully destructible which means you will literally and figuratively make your own path through every scenario. Brigador's graphical and gameplay deparment aren't the only standouts - the writing is excellent and the music is really effin' good.

Did I mention the devs are still putting out free content and helping the community mod their game EVEN THOUGH the game did poorly at launch and had next to no media coverage? Yeah, these dudes rock.

Brigador never stops being fast and frantic, but it is also tactical. The massive selection of vehicles and equipment allow for many play styles, but you will find yourself variously waiting, sneaking, ambushing, retreating, fleeing, hiding. Whether you are a lightly armoured fast 'mech or a gigantic floating gun platform, you will find yourself having to use Solo Nobre's layout to your advantage. You're always playing an action game, but you will need to know the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and weapons, and those of your opponents, to win.

Brigador's environments are captivating, varied, and superbly detailed. Dark farmland at night, neon lit urban areas, spaceports full of containers and low industrial buildings, corrugated iron slums. Everything looks amazing, everything crumbles and explodes perfectly in front of the game's bullets, rockets, lasers, artillery, shells. The finely crafted city makes a perfect playground to reduce to ruins.

Brigador's thumping soundtrack and grim cyberpunk aesthetic make it as cool as ice throughout. The world-building, always achieved through little paragraphs in mission briefings and item descriptions, is superb. The dysfunctional factions scrapping over the city, Solo Nobre's sad history, its depressed and downtrodden inhabitants, all come to life beautifully.

Brigador has awesome action with an awesome tactical side. Awesome 'mechs, awesome tanks, awesome anti-grav vehicles, armed with awesome machine guns, awesome artillery pieces, awesome rocket launchers, awesome lasers, awesome cannons.

[i]Brigador.[/i]

You're a Shadowrunner (or near enough) in a mech/tank/antigravity gunship (we don't judge here) with a very vague Contract with some [i]very[/i] suspect clauses and a set of orders to facilitate a regime change on a distant colony world.

Those little guys with the yellow raincoats and the flashlights bobbing around on a necklace? Those are civilians.

They aren't tracked, beyond the usual pittance of salary you get for assorted collateral damage.

Dodge them.

Or don't.

Blast your way through their homes and workplaces on your way to a better firing position.

Or don't.

Brought a siege howitzer with cluster shells, because you cannot into artillery marksmanship and the Map Square Removal Device is the only piece of indirect-fire kit you know how to use?

You better bet that's going to take out half the neighborhood along with the mech platoon you were shooting at.

Of course, it's not just a binary 'A: commit blatant war crimes' OR 'B: don't be a [b]complete[/b] monster' - there's a third option, 'C: give new meaning to 'depraved indifference' and cause trillions in deaths, injuries, and property damage as you bumble around the landscape like a fifty-foot drunken sailor'.

Did I mention it's the middle of the night and several other factions have all gone hot, trying for the same prize? There's nowhere for these people to go.

When a Loyalist infantry platoon is shoving through the crowd and firing on you with heavy lasers, do you hose the street down with gunfire?

There's a tank squadron coming up the highway behind you, and they've got some seriously heavy backup right behind them.

Stomp through and past the crowd, burst through apartments no doubt full of even more people you can't see, or stand and die?

One of your objectives is an ammo dump. It's in the middle of a shantytown. Call it, what, five thousand people? It's the middle of the night. On the one hand, these impoverished souls are barely scraping by and probably don't deserve to be randomly blown up by a mercenary gunship pilot. On the other, that's a pretty hefty bonus you'll get if you take out all of the ammo depots in the area.

Picking a pilot with a higher or lower max difficulty, choosing a stronger or weaker vehicle and then a longer or shorter operation (how manyand what levels you want to play) all make the game easier or harder and affect your payout. Even if you choose an easier pilot and powerful vehicle this game demands a LOT of situational awareness and a fair amount of thought before you act. Learning what vehicle and weapon set ups  complement each other is important. Part of it is also the controls. The default controls are relative to your vehicles hull and not to the screen as most top-down isometric games are but If you can get used to this movement I feel it adds to the games depth. If not there is a ""tank"" style control option.

  The sheer number of vehicles and weapons means nearly anyone can find a combination that they will find fun, suits their play style, or fits the challenge they've set for themselves. The vehicles vary wildly from tiny tread bikes to fortress-like tanks. Hovering fighter planes to floating school buses with a battleship gun, and last but not least mechs from basicaly a suit of armor to four story tall doom machines. The guns are just as crazy, machine guns, tank caliber shotguns, and gas cannister launchers to name a few. At the time of this review there are 52 vehicles, 40 weapons and 4 specials and the devs have added more than a few of those after exiting early access including new pilots.

  The style of everything and the music work so well together to set the tone of a retro, somewhat dystopian future and as an added bonus, despite a rather simple premise of ""pick killing machine, destroy all enemies"" there is an unusualy deep lore to Brigador. If you read the descriptions to the numerous pilots, vehicles, weapons and the info and lore available for purchase ingame the world really begins to come to life.

-> It is very hard for me to find any faults with Brigador. The feel, the difficulty, and the variety of it all makes for a very satisfying game. The attention to every detail from difficulty to balance the atmoshphere and lore is amazing. The ONLY thing I feel is missing is multiplayer content or even just co-op but, honestly, it doesn't need it and that would just add a lot of unnecessary work. If you're thinking the price is too much for a simple 2d game, all I can say is its not as simple as it looks and the amount of work that went into and continues to go into this game makes it worth every penny of the $20 price tag. You wont be disappointed.

You can't simply rush in like an idiot stomping and shooting everything. Past the very first babby missions, you must develop situational awareness, tread carefully (e.g., don't back into a gas station while aiming across the map), take facing into account (flanks and rear = more damage), take terrain and map layout into account (and use it against enemies where possible), manage sound because it attracts the attention of enemies (an exploding space cannon makes a great deal of noise; firing a quiet weapon, very little), prioritize targets, conserve your ammo, aim carefully, and use your special equipment wisely.

There's quite a learning curve at first. Learning to steer and aim simultaneously takes some getting used to, as does figuring out the flow of the game and what does what. One mistake can get you blown up or swarmed and botch an entire mission.

The maps and terrain are quite varied, from landscaped suburban housing enclaves to open fields to neon-bedecked cities to pipe- and factory-filled industrial zones. The faction and unit composition of the enemy force also differs and makes for markedly differently play, especially during the campaign.

There are currently 52 vehicles to choose from, more-or-less evenly split between mechs, tanks, and agravs (hover vehicles), and further split between three factions. Their attributes and handling vary widely, and many have special traits; even their profile can have an effect (needle-like vehicles are harder to hit head-on, for example). The smaller, frailer vehicles cost more to unlock and are harder to play but grant reward multipliers at mission end. There are 40 weapons split between five hardpoint categories and 4 pieces of special equipment (smokescreen, EMP grenade, optic camo, and demolition blast). These can be mixed and matched however you see fit, although the type of hardpoints (each vehicle has two) are fixed. These options allow for a great deal of flexibility and variety.

Most of the unlocks after vehicles and equipment are for progressively longer and harder Freelance campaigns, and for pilots. Higher-level pilots increase mission difficulty and payout, and cost progressively more to unlock. There are also a bunch of Intel/Lore items to unlock that offer a lot of backstory for the game.

The game's almost purely skill-based. Taking a frail vehicle piloted by a high-difficulty pilot through a long, high-difficulty Freelance campaign is possible, but requires a great deal of practice and familiarity with the game.

In Freelance mode (aka best mode), you're able to pick a vehicle and slap on whatever it's hardpoints can handle. Tons of fun. Ontop of that, the game has a surprising amount of lore to dig into if you so desire (it's totally optional). Many of the weapons have a fair bit of reality behind them. Lorentz force weapons, caseless ammunition, superposed load weapons, all kinds of goodies. There are lore entries on the vehicles and how they fit into the world. It's surprisingly well fleshed out.

A WORD OF WARNING: the controls will likely take you some time to get comfortable with. I've died multiple times to accidentally running into fuel refineries or other ""energetic"" terrain early on. And believe me when I say it's frustrating. It's like an insta-kill landmine for many vehicles. The crux of the problem is basically... pushing up will not make you go up. W is accelerate and S is reverse. A and D turn you. Tank controls, basically. The mechs handle the same way. A-gravs are witchcraft and I cannot pilot them. A-gravs float and will always point to the cursor, with W and S moving towards and away from the cursor respectively. A and D strafe relative to the cursor. So if the cursor is below your agrav, the controls are basically reversed. D would move you left on the screen. It makes my brain hemorrage and my a-grav crash into gas stations. As far as I know there isn't a way to alter this stuff either. So if tank controls aren't your thing, you might wanna reconsider. 'Cause you're gonna have to get pretty good with them. ie: reversing your tank backwards through the wavy maze you carved out of the inner city while you kite some lumbering death machine. Your vehicle's armor is strongest in front, so you'll be doing quite a bit of fancy reverse work.

Firing arcs are always displayed as a red or blue line for your primary and secondary weapons, and the completely destructible environments are a ton of fun.  Each run earns you money to spend on unlocking things, and there is a ton to unlock.

The story is non existent, but you're there to blow up a bunch of stuff in some banana republic, right?  That's really about as much narrative as you'll get in game.  There's unlockable lore, but since it costs cash, who would buy that instead of a new mech?

I've had heard about and seen gameplay of this game prior to its release, but then lost track of it. Now that it had been released for a while, I rediscovered it and bought the game +OST and audiobook during a sale... Yeah, shame on me (I only buy games during sales these days).

At the time of writing this, I have played Brigador for over 26 hours; this should, in my opinion, be enough to give a good estimate of its qualities.

Brigador is, without doubt, a gem. And I'm not talking diamond-in-the-rough here, but a real, polished gem.

The lore, while not the main selling point, is fantastic. Through well-written pilot and equipment descriptions as well as dedicated lore and intel entries you get a glimpse into a fleshed-out universe that has obviously been crafted with love and care. Add to that the fantastic 80's-synth-inspired soundtrack and beautiful, cyberpunk-esque graphical presentation and you've already got a winner. But the real star here is the gameplay; Brigador is not just an isometric mech shooter, but a surprisingly deep and engaging experience.


[u][b]Finally an honest game description[/b][/u]

The game's description in the store is surprisingly accurate. Here's what it says:

[i]Choose your vehicle, weapons, pilot, and defense.
Assault the districts of Solo Nobre, then escape or die trying.
Your choice.[/i]

This describes the Freelance mode, which is the core of the game, pretty well.

First you choose from a wide selection of pilots, most of which you have to unlock with hard-earned in-game currency. These pilots, however, do not differ in skills or stats, but in terms of difficulty. Each pilot has a minimum and maximum difficulty level, a set increase in difficulty per finished district, a mission complete bonus and a minimum and maximum payout multiplier.

This can mean, for example, that some pilots are better for short missions (i.e. finished only three districts), as they have a fixed difficulty and payout multiplier. Other pilots are better at longer runs, with difficulty and payout multiplier increasing with each finished district.

Once you have decided on a pilot, you need to select a vehicle, and there are a lot to choose from (with additional vehicles possibly being added with future patches).
Vehicles come in three flavors: Mechs, tanks and so-called agravs (think hovertanks). Each of these classes handles very differently, and they are further divided by weight class and faction.

Generally speaking, the more powerful, heavier vehicles are cheap to unlock but offer little or no additional payout multiplier, whereas the lighter, often less-heavily armed vehicles are more expensive to unlock (and often harder to play) but offer a higher payout multiplier (usually between 1.5 and 3.0, with one 10.0 vehicle being the exception).

Each vehicle has two weapon hardpoints, which can fall into these categories: Main, heavy, auxiliary, small and turret. Every category has 8 unique and powerful weapons to choose from, a whopping 40 weapons all in all.

Additionally, you can equip your vehicle with one of four different special weapons, that can have either defensive or offensive purposes - or a mix of both.

Finally you choose a mission - which is a sort of mini-campaign consisting of several maps or 'districts' - and that's it. In order to finish and leave a district you need to complete at least one of these goals:
1. Destroy all four planetary defense cannons
2. Eliminate all enemy captains (usually between 4 and 6)
3. Destroy at least 75% of your opposition

There are also optional goals which you can (and should) complete for a better payout.


[u][b]Make no mistake... or it'll be your last.[/b][/u]

Once the mission begins, you start at one of several possible entry locations for each map; which one you spawn in is random.

Your goal is to fulfill your mission and, most importantly, stay alive and finally extract via spaceport. If you fail, there is no continue, and around 99% of your accumulated points - your payout - will be withheld in order to cover your 'funeral expenses'. Basically, the game just says ""screw you!"" and gives you the finger when you die. And there are many, many ways to die; most of which start with the player doing something stupid.

If you don't pay attention to your surroundings and blow up something explosive while standing right next to it, you will die. (Sounds like a noob mistake, but believe me, it happens more often than you think.)

If you get cocky and rush into a large group of enemies, or trigger an alarm to have basically a whole districts worth of enemies converging on your last known location, you will die (at least if you don't GTFO immediately).

If you select a combination of vehicle and weaponry you are not (yet) comfortable with and decide to do a high-difficulty run, you will absolutely, positively die in the most horrific way possible.

This game can be hard, and sometimes unforgiving, but [i]how[/i] hard (or easy) is actually up to you, the player.

If you like to take it easy or simply get acquainted with the game and its controls, choose a powerful vehicle/weapon combo, an 'easy' pilot and whatever length of mission you feel like doing. As long as you finish it and get paid in the end, you're a winner.

Or, if you want to feel miserable, ride a tuk-tuk equipped with shrapnel-blasting cannons into the depths of hell (which seems to be anything higher than difficulty level ~7).

Speaking of difficulty, there are levels ranging from 1 to 13 (there's even a certain pilot with a difficulty of 0, actually), and the first few of these are rather mild. Personally speaking I've been able to beat up to level 7 reliably with a reasonably powerful vehicle and weapons, but anything above is pure madness (to me, at least).


[u][b]We need guns. Lots of guns.[/b][/u]

One of the great things about Brigador is its large variety of vehicles and weapons. Pretty much every playstyle is possible.

If you want to blast your enemies to smithereens from afar with naval cannons mounted to an ultra heavy tank, you can do just that.

If you love to zoom around in a tiny agrav and murder your enemies in the face with shrapnel cannons that's totally possible.

And if you like a heavy mech that stomps things that get too close and shoots lasers and gatling guns at everyone else - be my guest.

That being said, none of the above works without some sort of tactical modus operandi; simply rushing in, guns blazing will quickly get you killed on anything but the lowest difficulties.

Finding out what works for you (and what doesn't) is important (and fun).


[u][b]But wait! There's more.[/b][/u]

This review focuses mostly on the freelance mode, which is the bread and butter of Brigador. However, there is also a campaign mode that should at least be played for the tutorials as well as the first few levels in order to learn the ropes of the game.

After that, it quickly becomes tough as nails (and very, very frustrating, IMHO).

(Not saying that it's bad - I just suck at it.)


[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]

So, is Brigador good? Without a doubt. In fact, it's great. The controls are precise (though learning to aim some weapons correctly takes practice), the overall presentation leaves an impression of a game crafted with love and care, and the gameplay is surprisingly deep - much more than you would expect judging solely from screenshots or videos of this game.

The soundtrack is fantastic as well and definitely worth getting, IMHO. (I have only started the 7-and-a-half hour long audiobook, but it's good!)

Still wondering if you'll enjoy this game?

Initially it felt pretty average. There was walls of text accompanying the missions that I didn't care about, and weird 3d modeled pilot portraits reminiscent of something out of a 90's game. Who are these pilots? And who is Great Leader and Solo Nobre? The gameplay told me nothing. I was blowing stuff up, and I was dying a lot from getting stuck on things.

Normally I would probably have moved on, but I stuck with it, because the whole game had a strange vibe that had me coming back. The lack of any voices, the menus, the faces, the soundtrack, the unique visuals. And I knew there was a lot I would like already, with its' mostly pragmatic approach to mech and tank designs.


About 6 hours in, when I discovered the freelance mode, it started to click. Cash was earned from completing contracts, then spent on pilots that act as difficulty modifiers, and vehicles/gear, for you to take your own combination on a contract. As I unlocked them, I started reading the descriptions. It soon became clear this was the type of game I would consider a classic.
 They've nerded out on the lore. Every weird vehicle design is explained, and their history told from the perspective of the crewmen. There's mechs hated by their mechanics for wearing parts out quickly. Weapons feared for their cruelness rather than destructive potential.
I started using my cash to unlock stuff in the pure lore section of the menus. The world they've built started to come together. Everything made sense, the gameplay, the reason why all the pilots go on destructive rampages before flying off planet.
This spices the experience. There was hints of tactics to employ with the different weapons. I started recognizing the vehicles and weapons I encountered in the field, and my skill with movement and leading targets with momentum affected trajectories steadily improving. Favorite pilot and loadout combinations appeared. Yep, now I was hooked.


Overall, this is a game that doesn't present it's best qualities in the first hours of play. They slowly and steadily reveal themselves as the finer details emerge.

Brigador is a fun game and it's also really cool. The scenario is crafted in a way that feels familiar and fresh at the same time. It would be cool if they created DLC or another game that was related to Brigador's universe. As for the gameplay, It tends to be varied probably because of all the options available to the player once he or she has some mastery of the controls.

This time, it clicked.

Brigador is one of the best games on Steam, period.

It's like if Hotline Miami and (your favorite mech game) had a baby. It's pure flow-zone gaming. It's constant shots of adrenaline and serotonin straight to your brain. 

This is all aided by the KILLER soundtrack and meaty sounds of guns and explosions.

Also the freelance mode is basically mech-roguelike gaming. It's fucking amazing and makes the game infinitely replayable with so many different options of pilots, mechs, tanks, weapons......I am truly a converted believer in Brigador.

It's by far one of the most well thought through indie games I've ever played. A relativly simple core gameplay system is surrounded by very well realized framework. the maps are richly detailed, featuring farms, monorail systems, neon-lit entertainment districts, train yards, highways choked with abandoned cars, and more. Every vehicle, weapon, and pilot comes with it's own little lore entry, and the nature of the setting gets more and more clear the further you progress through the game. Even if you're not much one for lore, the thought they put into the setting still fills out the gameplay like mortar around bricks, and it all comes together in a simple (but not as simple as it looks) but engaging and well crafted mech shooter.

Rating: 8.75/10

The game is a pixel 'mech/tank/hovercraft shooter where you can play a 'story' mode or a replayable mission mode where you can make money to acquire new stuff(lore, enemy briefings, vehicles, weapons). The thought put into this game is impressive, the pixel graphics are very well-done, and are easily one of this games many strong points.

This game's difficulty, at least, in the non-mission mode, scales based on the pilot the player chooses and vehicle they drive. Lighter, less offensively-geared vehicles means more cash, and higher level pilots means more cash, more enemies, and higher quality enemies. Difficulty in mission mode seems to be that smaller vehicles are harder, but that's somewhat a personal preference issue.

Loadouts in this game cannot be customized as highly as MechWarrior. There are two weapon slots per vehicle, and four(I believe) weapon categories. Weapons are furher divided into ballistic, energy, repeating, and something else which is purple(don't know what those are, explosive?). Weapons deal different damage levels to different targets(shields, health, structures). Energy weapons have low penetration(railguns are considered energy weapons in this game, but, realisticially, they're ballistic). Ballistics have high(er) penetration. Machine guns and explosives tend to simply damage cover(though explosives are much more effective).

You can also affix a special to your vehicle. The options available are EMP, smoke grenades, active camoflage, and Audio-Kinetic pulse(directional sonic death-cone).

This game is one of the four best purchases I've made on Steam.

I had this on my wishlist for a while, after reading a RPS article on its development.  Since my purchase, Brigador remains a very enjoyable and cathartic game.  The graphics are very detailed, with entrancing lighting effects, satisfying destructability and complex, but rewarding vehicles with which to to wreak havoc.   The ones I have encountered thus far include tanks, various sized mechs and hover vehicles, with each class having unique movement, stats, weapons, etc.  Admittedly, it takes a while to acquaint yourself with the controls, as most vehicles have separate movement and turret controls, which can be slightly disorienting at first, but these are quickly learned through addictive gameplay that doesn't punish failure.  If you die, just start the level again, maybe with one of the different vehicles permitted for the mission and try a different approach (smoke to hide your movement, or camo to sneak into position).  

Another point of potential contention is that the game doesn't feature savegames.  The missions aren't typically that long, but are sometimes difficult and losing progress right near the end can be a little frustrating.  This frustration has not stopped me from diving right back in however, and there is a clear sense of satisfaction when completing the level, despite having died multiple times in the session.

I must make specific mention of the excellent soundtrack done by Makeup and Vanity Set.  It gives the action a great feel and I find myself nodding along, as I stomp, crush and smash my way through the levels.  I have since bought the soundtrack, as well as two other albums by MAVS and it is definitely worthwhile checking out.

Don't get fooled by the deceptively simple gameplay, which is about shooting things, because behind the layer of simplicity lies a set of layers that adds to the complexity of the battle system: damage type, weapon type, vehicle type, noise generated, terrain, positioning, even the factions you're up against only serve to create a cohesive, intuitive and intelligent battle design, so you'll find yourself dying constantly if you think it's about just going turret mode and shooting whatever comes across your weaponry.

The art style is absolutely gorgeous to look at, nailing that 80s cyberpunk look with a spritework that is just downright beautiful. The levels arent just some mindless details thrown into a box, many sprites dedicated to the different environments serve the purpose of giving life to the setting, and the effort is such that there's even sprites for small road traffic barriers and street lamps. The buildings, the debris, the vehicle models, the farms/countryside, even the small pedestrians running around, everything looks so good, it almost feels like watching a tabletop of very high quality models, and I'm particularly fond of spritework, especially the ones with this level of quality.

The soundtrack only compounds that 80s feeling with the neo 80s style it has, it's really cool and provides much of the feeling of being a kickass inside a vehicle blowing stuff up with the tension of being swarmed by enemy units and pulling off maneuvers to keep yourself alive and kicking. The main theme that plays when you boot up the game is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the quality of the music here.

Not only do the devs put in the effort of an excelent, buttery smooth gameplay and great audiovisual design, there's also a universe built around the game, a huge amount of lore and story details is put on Solo Nobre, it's factions, the pilots, even the weapons and vehicles are described in terms of the game's fiction, giving even more life to the setting. You can even read the contract's terms that the brigadors sign!

The game features a campaign (a series of missions played using specific vehicle builds) and freelance mode (missions set in districts in which you can use a vehicle build of your choosing), and while the gameplay is rock solid and responsive that definitely help freelance mode, the campaign is more of a challenge mode rather than a story since there are only small explanations an nothing more aside from the intro given at the end of the first story mission. It's not a bad thing per se, but there is just so much lore giving life to the setting that the lack of a proper story detailing the fall of Solo Nobre doesn't do justice to the existing potential. On the gameplay side, a little balancing could help the utility of the defensive abilities, as the active camo is way above the usefulness of the AK pulse and the EMP grenade.

However, those are small concerns I have that don't really detract from the excellent quality at display here, and with the devs showing even further support with the recent inclusion of different control schemes and a level editor down the line, only good things appear to be certain for the future of this game, which is a shame since this game deserves way more love considering the level of effort and execution.

TL;DR - It's a great game that deserves a lot of love, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone. Well, at least if you're into isometric shooters anyway. So please buy the game to accept the contract.

Shoot everything that moves.

...Also shoot everything that doesn't move, for good measure!

Bridgador is a very satisfying, visceral mech combat game. It's the top-down tactical explosion bonanza you've been waiting for!

In Bridgador, you take command of one of several mercenaries of questionable mental health, tasked with what is essentially the terrorising of the planet Solo Nobre for monetary and political gain. The objectives don't change too much from level to level, and essentially boil down to destory everything while avoiding being destroyed - which can be a rather difficult task depending on the vehicle, loadout and tactics you choose to emply.

There are two modes of play, a campaign and 'freelance' mode. The campaign is more story heavy, as you might expect (although it's not obnoxiously in-your-face either), but my favourite mode is Freelance, where completing missions provides funds to buy new vehicles, pilots, weapons etc. Bonus money is awarded for taking weaker mechs (or more unstable pilots!). Experimenting with the weapons is a joy. A lot of it is imbalanced in a beautiful way - some weapons are terrible, some punch above their weight class, and it rewards experimentation.

The gameplay its-self is from an isometric perspective (reminiscent of Mechwarrior 3050 on the SNES for me), and the default controls are like that of a tank (AWSD to rotate and stomp forwards/backwards, mouse to aim). The aiming in particular is quite nuanced, as the mechs are often taller than the things they're shooting at, so you need to aim where you intend the projectile to hit, rather than in the general direction of the enemy. There are many interesting touches and lots of attention to detail.

All in all, the worst aspect of Brigador is that the missions tend to be a tad samey (especially in Freelance mode, the objectives are the same each time), but the terrain you stomp though and specifics of the fights you'll have to take keep things interesting. It's by no means a perfect game, but if you enjoy mech or future war themes, explosions or tactical shooty gameplay, definitely check out...

I'm sure there are plenty of reviews already that explain the ins and outs of the game, so I'll just list what I like.

Brigador has very good art. You can see the care that went into every single sprite. The thought put into the engineering of these vehicles. There are three different factions in the game, each with their own sort of theme. The Loyalists are pretty standard Battletech/Starcraft Terran style that you'd expect from a game like this, with some creative twists. The Spacers have vehicles that look very high-tech and elegant, but still believable in design. Orange checkerboard patterns, thin lightweight legs, spherical wheels instead of tank treads, lots of moving parts. The Corvids (my favorite) have vehicles that are cobbled together from old truck frames, salvaged legs, and the occasional stripped out muscle car. Each vehicle has character and creativity in its design.

Brigador has a lot of variety. You choose a vehicle, bolt your choice of two weapons onto it, and roll out. There are many different vehicles in the game, each with its own list of statistics such as hull strength, turn speed, forward movement speed, chassis turn speed, etc. Each weapon does something different. The Abbot is a giant cannon that punches through armor through sheer concussive force. The Otomo is a giant, short-ranged sustained laser that can melt through metal like marshmallows over a fire, but takes a few seconds to focus in. The Gutterball is a giant ball of heavy metal launched like a catapult that arcs over obstacles and crashes through buildings like they're made of paper. The Harvester is a massive artillery strike that flies high into the air before splitting into a cluster of explosives and then destroying a city block as it lands. These guns are all unique and satisfying to use.

Brigador has unique and interesting lore.  It's mostly presented through vehicle descriptions and the backstory of the selectable pilot characters. It all paints a bleak picture of an interesting and cohesive world. Also, the developers have approached a professional author to write a book set in the game's universe. It's definitely worth a read. I think it's really cool that the game got this kind of dual release and wish more developers would do this sort of thing.",1475274555,1475274555,True,5,0,0.532602429389953613,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Between the soundtrack, the tactical gameplay, and the overall feel of the controls, there is a lot to love. However the game also suffers from certain issues that may disuade people.
Pros: 
Music:Great soundtrack from Makeup and Vanity set that has been added to through recent updates.

Difficulty: The difficulty of the game can fluctuate wildly, although most of the time it feels like smart play and knowing the strengths of your loadout will help you prevail. Overall the best way to improve is through practice, you can't just jump in and expect to win missions or contracts on your first try.

Story: The lore has been expanded upon and is interesting to read, however I feel like locking it behind a credit wall was a bit unnessary, as it would be better served to unlock it by defeating enemies or by completing a certain number of missions in an area. 

Cons: 
Loadouts: While mentioned as a pro, certain campaign missions feature loadouts that are near impossible to use (at least for me), and as a result it can be very difficult to complete missions.

Visuals: While the visuals give you a great feeling of destruction and power in a mech, it can be difficult at times to find smaller enemies who have the ability to detonate and remove a huge chunk of your shield in all the chaos. This can be especially frustrating when you already have low health and you die from it. 

Lore acquisition: To give yourself a better understanding of enemies and what you'll be facing, you need to purchase lore with credits. These aren't necessarily expensive, but they can add up quickly for what is essentially flavor text and minor tips. Really this should be changed based on encounters or enemies defeated.

Overall: It's a great game that invokes the feeling of Hotline Miami and similar games at times, although this has to be taken with a grain of salt, as missions are longer than Hotline Miami, and the game is much more punishing for death. Smart play and tactics are necessary to succeed, and the controls do take some getting used to.

Using your weapons platform, which may fly, crawl, or walk, you must defeat your unreasonable opposition by taking advantage of your superior knowledge of the battlefield and reshaping that battlefield through strategic demolition of cover. This is a game of rocket tag - concentrated weapons fire can eradicate all but the sturdiest of vehicles in a handful of seconds, so you must ensure you get the first and last shot by attacking from surprise. It does this excellently.

The game is not flawless - the control scheme is not intuitive. It is not particularly difficult, but it takes getting used to. Your viewpoint is isometric, but your vehicle is facing in a specific direction and it's up to you to ensure it's pointing the right direction. The game will require you to split your attention between where you're aiming, and where you are, often while both of those are changing very rapidly. If you can master multitasking between your own movement and your own aiming, you'll be a much stronger player.

Edit: Since this review was first published, an additional difficulty customization was added. The speed of time in the game can be slowed as low as 50% of normal speed. This allows you to develop a sense of the game at a more managable pace. It can be adjusted up and down in-mission in the menu.

The game's writing is excellent. The story of Solo Nobre is communicated through mission briefings, and through optional lore you can purchase from the in-game store you use to buy new pilots, vehicles, and weapons. This lore includes the contract that your Brigador signs with the Solo Nobre Concern which employs you, information on the culture of Solo Nobre, and briefings on the technology of the setting written by other characters who appear in the narrative. It's a small slice of the setting, not an expansive narrative, but it's presented potently.

Edit: Since this review was first published, some additional material was added to the game. Some of it is satirical or jokey, and does not fit with the rest of the narrative, but this material is not subtle about it and it's clear that it's a joke, so it doesn't really undermine the setting so much as sit next to it wearing a funny hat.

The control system allows (and requires) a lot more precision than an arcade-style shooter, both in movement and firing - the more you play, the more you appreciate why this is a good thing. The game is also brutally unforgiving for anyone taking a gung-ho approach (unless you know what you're doing) - there is no repair during missions and even the heaviest vehicles can be swiftly wrecked if surrounded in the open - also triggering an alert can make things significantly harder. This can be frustrating to begin with, but is very rewarding once you get a feel for the controls and the tactical aspects of the gameplay.

Though there is a campaign of 20 or so missions, the real attraction and longevity of the game lies in freelance mode, where you can choose your vehicle, weapon loadout and mission locations. You can unlock these assets from a large list using money earned from completing missions. It's a good idea to do the first few campaign missions before embarking on freelance mode, as these serve both as a tutorial and a also a quick way to get a decent cash balance to start unlocking assets for freelance mode (though the starting vehicles and weapons are pretty good, they may not suit your playstyle - personally I unlocked active camo as soon as I could).

The range of vehicles and weapons available offers a huge variety to suit different playstyles; it's like having a large toybox of futuristic fighting vehicles and weapons. For vehicles you have a variety of mechs, tanks and anti-grav vehicles all with different handling, armour and loadout options. For weapons you have a variety of cannons, mortars, rocket launchers, chain guns and lasers. You can even unlock different pilots who effectively raise the difficulty (and reward) level of missions.

Despite the lo-fi graphics, the game is nicely atmospheric with its neon nightscapes and synth music that evokes 80s sci fi films such as Escape from New York. This has a very similar look and atmosphere to Neon Chrome.

This game won't be for everyone, but if you can get past the learning curve and appreciate its strengths, then you'll find this offers much more gameplay than a lot of full price games. It's a shame that original gems like this get overlooked in favour of flashier, larger-budget games with less gameplay.

Definitely worth the asking price for the gameplay it offers. If you think this is for you, I'd suggest supporting the devs and not waiting for a sale.",1473545448,1481500069,True,7,0,0.573518991470336914,0,True,False,False,False,,,

　知っての通りですが、[b]辺境植民惑星ノヴォ=ソロ[/b]は極度の混乱状態にあります。
先日の、偉大なる指導者の死去を端に発した混乱は現時点で最高潮にあり、
特に[b]首都ソロ=ノブレ[/b]は現在『[b]体制支持者[/b]』『[b]反乱軍[/b]』、そして『[b]宇宙居住者[/b]』の派遣軍により三つ巴の様相を呈しており、各市街ブロックには軌道高射砲や防護壁が設置され要塞化され戦闘の激化しつつあります。
　かかる状況におきましてこの度SNCは当該地域に於いて傭兵業務を執り行う業務委託者([b]以下Brigador[/b])の追加募集を行うことに致しました。


　各Brigadorは現地へと派遣され各陣営の制圧地域において指定された目標の破壊、そしてミッション達成後の脱出までの全ての作戦行動を単独で行うことになります。
　作戦目標『[b]軌道高射砲の破壊[/b]』『[b]敵将校ユニットの全撃破[/b]』『[b]敵ユニット7割の撃破[/b]』、
いずれかの目標を達成した後に市街ブロックの脱出が許可されます。ですが最低限の業務では最低限の報酬しか支払われません、[b]可能な限り全ての目標・軍施設・建造物の破壊が推奨[/b]されます。尚、現地に散見される[b]一般市民の殺傷も全て報酬に上乗せし計上されます[/b]。
　


　戦闘において使用される各機体には２つの武器と１つのオプションを装備が可能な、『[b]メック[/b]』『[b]戦車[/b]』『[b]反重力ホバー[/b]』３つのタイプがあります。各機体の特徴を活かした戦い方を心がけるべきでしょう。
　『[b]メック[/b]』は二足歩行の戦闘ロボットであり、泥濘等の悪路や柵などの障害物に機動力を制限されるデメリットが有りますが、車高の高さを活かした遮蔽物越しの射撃や、強力な格闘攻撃を行えます。
　『[b]戦車[/b]』はメックとは逆に車高の低さを活かした遮蔽、少々の障害物を強引に突破できるパワーが有ります。
(尚、パワードスーツ程度の小型メックや、タワー型の大型戦車など例外も存在します)
　『[b]反重力ホバー[/b]』は地面から数ｍ浮いているため悪路や低い障害物を飛び越えての移動が可能ですが、武器が正面に完全固定されているため多方向の敵との交戦には不向きです。
　
　業務に必要な最低限の機材はSNCから支給されますが。各Brigadorの戦闘スタイルにあった組み合わせを試行錯誤する為にも報酬を貯めてより多くの機材を購入するのが望ましいです。
　各機体ごとに装備できる武器カテゴリが異なることに注意しましょう。


　先述の通りBrigadorは各地において単独で作戦行動を行いますが、[b]基本的に敵ユニットはこちらが保有する機材と同等の性能を持っています[/b]。
　(※ゲームの内部データ的には少しだけ弱くなっているけれどね)
　偵察ユニットに通報され圧倒多数の敵ユニットに包囲された場合にはほぼ死を覚悟する必要があります。故に基本は夜の闇に乗じてのステルスを心がけ銃声などで敵をおびき出して各個撃破する事が望ましいですが、大型兵器に搭乗し正面からのラウドな立ち回りですべてを破壊し尽くすのも良いでしょう。


　最終的には[b]宇宙港を制圧し奪取したドロップシップで脱出[/b]してもらいますが、宇宙港は敵の精鋭部隊が待ち構えている為、余力を残せる段階での早期撤退も視野に入れた柔軟な判断力が求められます。可能な限りギリギリまで区画を制圧していってもそれは構いませんが。
　無事生還した後に、搭乗者の技能と搭乗機体の戦闘力による報酬倍率を計算して貴方の口座に報酬が振り込まれます。[b]より多くの報酬を獲得したいのならば、高難易度の搭乗者を使い小型で弱武装の機体での作戦行動が求められます[/b]ので、その点にゲーム的なスコアアタックのやりがいが充実しています。

I bought this game after hearing good things about it from a friend of mine, I was not disappointed when I started playing it.

First of all, this game is very challenging, there is an element of stealth where certain enemies will sound the alarm if you're in their line of sight for a certain period of time, if they do sound the alarm then you will have to contend with every single tank, mech and hovertank knowing where you are.

But you're thankfully not helpless as you've got a lot of interesting weapons and abilities at your disposal, provided you unlock them for the Freelance mode of course, the campaign mode just gives you preset vehicles that each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

As for the controls, it very much handles like older action games with a tank-style of moving about, as in that when you press the left or right movement button, you turn that direction and you only walk that direction which can be a little confusing for first time players.

But the devs did add very recently, at the time of this writing, an alternate movement scheme where your vehicle automatically turns to the direction you press, much like the one in the Resident Evil Remake remaster and in The Witcher 3.

Oh and I almost forgot to mention the kickass music in this game by Makeup and Vanity Set, it really fits the neon-style in the game with its synths and whatnot, highly recommend that people check out the OST & Audiobook that you can get.

Update:
As most have seen now, the game has received a major update that's added a brand new tutorial campaign with three new pilots for you to use along with an overhaul of the game's difficulty so that its not as punishing on new players.

If you had been holding off on getting Brigador prior to this update, then now is the perfect time to buy it and enjoy some mayhem while piloting a mech, tank or anti-gravity vehicle.",1472654545,1561628958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKFtPdCysR4 

In this scene  it is terrifying to watch machine gun fire shred the protagonists' cover as they move from place to place. They are forced into difficult situations, burdened on one hand with Labors unable to find sufficient cover, and on the other hand humans unable to take on the drones on their own. Tactics change as the battle progresses, contingent not only on the abilities of the participants themselves, but their surroundings and positioning. Piloting a large craft becomes both a blessing and a curse in tight quarters.

I'm not much of a strategy or tactics gamer, but Brigador offers a keen reproduction of this sensation in a way that I have not felt in other games. A tank with the power to decimate my armor is stalking a city district block by block on the lookout for my mech. I switch on my cloaking device and sneak past an advancing column of small infantry units, careful not to cause any destruction on my way. As my cloak dissipates, I dodge into an alleyway and let the tank have it from behind with both barrels; it explodes before it can even swivel around and set me in its crosshairs. I stomp its remains out of my way and veer around another corner to put some distance between the now-alerted infantry and me. I gauge my situation and decide I have more than enough ammo: I hunker down, swivel towards the advancing units and aim my fire at the tower block between me and them. As my cannon brings the building down I use my secondary mount to vaporize my targets through the newly-created hole in the scenery.

The difficult, player-relative controls are a successful part of what makes this game's atmosphere both tense and deliberate; I'm piloting a [i]mobile weapons platform[/i], not playing a game of robotron. Being able to deftly turn a corner is a valuable skill that comes with practice, like lobbing artillery or targeting flying units. That said, the controls are still difficult for me; if I let go of Brigador in the near future it will probably be due to this fact combined with the overall difficulty of mid- and late-game missions, since I certainly didn't breeze through the first few. I know I won't ever unlock everything.

Brigador is a real-time and fast paced isometric shooter/smasher/destroyer of worlds. 
There are three main families of vehicles to choose from, Tanks, Agravs (hovercraft) and of course Mechs. 
All three have their own control quirks and in particular the Agravs can be a bit tricky. 

In combat, the goals are to destroy a set number of the opposition or specific building targets, or both. At the end of a mission you're given money based on the objectives achieved, collateral damage inflicted, and then multiplied based on the vehicle (worse vehicle = higher multiplier) and the pilot (higher level pilot = harder difficulty = higher multiplier) 
How this plays out is that the level 0 starting pilot plus a badass Mech or Heavy tank will let you just wade in and destroy everything without concern in most cases, especially in the early levels, while using a high level pilot (especially level 6 or more) and a weaker vehicle (like the Party Van) will require very well-executed stick-and-move tactics that focus on attracting just a few enemies at a time and ambushing them around a corner while leaving you a clear escape route. 

I've found the best strategy is to bait in just a few at a time in such a corner, and as you destroy them, haul ass to that corner to collect ammo and shield energy as you need it. Especially in later levels it's unlikely that you'll have killed them all when you need more ammo or shield energy, so you have to get good at running right up to them and getting the shield energy and ammo you need while still effectively fighting and not exposing your much more vulnerable rear to a powerful enemy unit. 
Don't be greedy about this, and try to have a second fallback position cleared out so you can lure them back around a second corner instead of charging in if need be. 
Ultimately this strategy can get you through most of the game but the crux of it gets down to very accurate fire and learning how to switch from one target to another very quickly. 


Overall tl;dr style:
Pros
-Flexible styles of play based on vehicles and weapons loadout
-Lots of destroyable envirionment, and stuff that explodes
-Super 1980's technophile steampunky feel both with art and music
-Very NES levels of simplistic AI and en masse attacks if you get too aggressive. 
-Very challenging at higher levels, very NES-style levels of victory feel when finally beating a tough mission with a tough combination. 

Cons
-Very, very easy to die. 
-NES levels of frustration and urge to yell and curse when you do. 
-Envirionments are pretty consistent and similar, but given that it's an isometric game that means that all of those elements need to be made one at a time, so I'd rather have the nicely detailed urban and grassland options vs a half ass version of those and snowy areas, moonscape, etc. The story takes place on one planet so there's that going for consistency as well. 

-No way to save your progress on longer freelance campaigns. 
Later Freelance missions will have you taking on 39 different map areas in a row without the ability to skip a map or save your progress in between them. This means if you're going to seriously attempt one of these longer campaigns you better be ready to quit and forfeit all of your progress, or buckle up for hours and hours of play. When using the ambush strategies I described above, and taking it slow to try to bait in just a few enemies at a time, this can take a LONG time. 

-If you're in a level too long, the music gets through the track and quits playing. This is lonely and sad when I'm taking my sweet ass time trying to ambush big enemies in a Party Van. 

-Loadout customization is very over-simplified, but still vague. Different weapons are given nicknames and come in four basic types (cannon, machine guns, mortars, and lasers) and five different size classes (heavy, main, turret, auxillary, and small) but I end up remembering which weapons do what based on nothing more than their ammo capacity and nothing else. Give me designations, or at least display the actual weapon name in the HUD, please! In a perfect world, having an animation displaying the weapon firing in the weapon description would be really nice. 

-Everything you buy (weapons, vehicles, pilots) just has 'redacted' in its description before you buy it. Meaning you have absolutely no idea if the weapon that some enemy just used to mess you up is actually the one you're buying. Nor do you really know anything about it beyond the weapon type. This is frustrating and I ended up just getting a decent combo together with an OK pilot/vehicle multiplier total and grinded an easier freelance mission over and over again until I could buy all the weapons to get it over with. Vehicles are similarly frustrating but you're not QUITE as blind in picking those.

-The main Campaign and the Freelance work always has a mix of who you're fighting and who you're fighting for, but the descriptions of all the equipment and pilots etc are all written from the perspective of one dude in one faction (who you can buy as a pilot) 
It would be nice if there were a Spacer campaign, a Loyalist campaign, and a Corvid campaign for a nice storyline. 


Overall I think it's a very fun, challenging isometric shooter that requires forethought and strategy to get through it, and it has a lot of very oldschool steampunk bladerunner-esque feeling world elements as well. Be prepared for a challenge in later levels. 
I really hope they develop more missions and an expanded storyline in the future, and perhaps open up more vehicles to use! I'd buy that as DLC!",1472341816,1472341816,True,3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

At that time, just for the sake of nostalgia I knew I was going to play Brigador eventually, that time finally arrived.

[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]

Brigador takes place in Solo Nobre, one of the several colonies in the Outer Colonies region. The Great Leader of Solo Nobre had implemented a totalitarian regime and adopted an isolationist stance by building orbital guns that would shoot down any spacecraft that would approach Solo Nobre atmosphere, thus preventing supplies and help from Earth and other colonies to arrive in the planet surface. Now, the Great Leader has been killed and it’s up to the Solo Nobre Concern (SNC) and its hired Brigadors to liberate Solo Nobre from tyranny and its 3 major factions who’re trying to seize control, the loyalists, the corvids and the spacers.

One thing I really like about Brigador, which I feel like some people won’t, is the fact that all of its lore is delivered via text and most of it you have to purchase with credits that you get by completing contracts. These pieces of intel can be about the design process of certain mechs, locations which you’ll visit, factions, the background of the Solo Nobre colony, among others. These are really engaging and I’ve spent a fair amount of time reading through several entries, I just wish there were more of them. That said, I would’ve liked to have seen a more streamlined campaign mode, perhaps even with dialogue and voice acting.

[b][u]Game Modes:[/u][/b]

There are 2 different modes in the game, Campaign and Freelance. The Campaign mode isn’t really you standard “campaign mode”, it’s more a series of challenges that let you get your hands on various types of weaponry and units. There are a total of 21 levels in the campaign and these can take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete depending on how you play and if you want to go after secondary targets. You can play each campaign level with 1 of 4 brigadors, some more easy to play with than the others. Besides that, every single level also has some sort of briefing that tells you what you’re going to do on that mission, what you should expect and why you’re doing it.

On the other hand ,the Freelance mode is where the real meat of the game is at. You can use your credits, either from the Campaign or this mode, to unlock pilots with different stats, vehicles, primary and secondary weapons as well as different special abilities. After that, you’re able to pick one of several operations. Each operation has various districts you can go through and some allow you to leave the operation earlier in order to save the credits you’ve earned that far, because if you die once you won’t receive any credits.

[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]

If you boil down Brigador to its bare core what you’ll find is something rather simple, select your Brigador, your pilot, your weapons, go into a specific zone, kill/destroy a certain target and extract. Simple. This is where Brigador excels, it takes a very simple concept and makes it extremely varied and challenging. Weapons range from railguns to cannons, lasers to machine guns, each with their own unique weight and feel that depending on your vehicle size and weight can make it so that it recoils back when firing. The variety of vehicles is what really amazes me, 45 different vehicles each with their own design and little description on how they were created and feeling that probably isn’t similar to any other.

There is a rather noticeable difficulty curve that might drive some people off but the devs seem to be working on making different control schemes available to players. Learning how to control and get a proper feel of different vehicles takes its time and is part of the experience. Don’t expect to master playing as a Mech and then switch to a agrav (anti-gravity) tank and still retain the same amount of precision and control that you had with the previous type of unit. Learning the controls and how/how long each Brigador takes to respond to your inputs is vital in order to succeed in the completion of your contract. 

The game doesn’t impose any sorts of rules for how you should approach your objective, be it eliminate an enemy unit or destroy a series of buildings. You chose the way you want to play. Follow the roads and sneak around or open a path across a housing block, everything is destructible and this is perfect for setting up ambushes. Fire a loud shot to attract nearby enemy units and lead them to a gas station, then just sit back and enjoy the fireworks or cause a mess and activate your cloak or hide inside smoke grenades and catch the enemy off guard from behind. There is something extremely satisfying about controlling a giant mech obliterating everything and everyone around you just for the sake of a higher paycheck.

[h1][b][u]Final Thoughts:[/u][/b][/h1]

What Brigador does it does exceptionally well. It’s an extremely engaging, challenging and rewarding isometric shooter that gives you the freedom of tactical approach. Cloak, flank your enemies and get out of there before they know what hit them, or pick up a giant metal machine of destruction and raze everything to the ground. You are a Brigador and you must fulfill your contract by any means necessary.

Presentation wise, I really like the way the neon lights and the spotlights on the vehicles light up the way ahead of you. The explosions and debris flying everytime something blows up, the lasers, the projectiles, everything looks so vivid and hectic, just what you’d expect from a post-totalitarian scenario! I’ve also been hooked on the soundtrack and I’ve been listening to it even when I’m not playing the game, it is just a plain joy to listen to. You can listen to some of it here: https://soundcloud.com/makeupandvanityset/sets/brigador-ost

A bit remeniscent of the old Sega Genesis Strike series (Desert Strike and its successors), Brigador puts you as a lone vehicle in a big, hostile world with your choice of main objectives to complete as well as resupply locations and optional side missions that can help limit the enemy's ability to respond to you.

  Simple controls- move, aim, shoot, and a defensive power- belie the underlying complexity brought to the table by noise, line-of-sight, variable armor facings (side + rear == more damage taken), a shield overcharge mechanic, and terrain offers varying degrees of toughness, resistance to being shot through, and hinderance to mobility.

  When you start the game, you'll feel like you're undergunned and under-armored, with no way to do better.  Give it an hour or two, however, and you may find yourself sweeping the entire map and leaving fully shielded and loaded with every optional objective completed, and ready for a harder difficulty.

  Negatives?  One complaint, and one warning.

  The only real complaint I have is that there is exploding terrain that will do massive damage to you, and is relatively hard to see.  Nothing like spending 30 minutes carefully clearing a series of maps only to fail because you didn't see a muted green pipe or muted yellow gas canister against the overwhelmingly dark gray-brown-green background.  Realistic or not, these things need to be more visible.

  It's also worth noting while that you could spend a loooooooong time unlocking all of the vehicles, weapons, pilots (difficulty levels), and maps that the game has to offer, Brigador is fundamentally a fairly compact experience.  The vehicles and weapons do handle significantly differently, but after a few hours of feverently playing the game I find myself feeling like I've gotten most of what I can get out of the game.  I would like to revisit it some more, but I'm a bit burned out.

  Brigador is, however, a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and executes on it very well.

THE GOOD:
Visuals and Audio - I group these together because they work together very well. Despite being taking up a small portion of the screen, you feel like a powerhouse firing your cannons, howiters, rockets, and machine guns at the enemy forces, watching them and anything near them melt, crumble, and explode. It's all backed up by a 80's synth soundtrack that just works amazingly well for this hard to label aesthetic. Also, the levels are bladerunner-style gorgeous and you will enjoy purposefully or accidently blowing them up.

Gameplay - It's fast and frenetic, but the best part is how varied it is. Each mission lets you pick from 4 different pilots/vehicles, and the vehicles vary by tank, hover (agrav), or mech... and each with it's own set of main, secondary, and defense weapon. Stopping there would be fine, but then there is freelance mode where you use your merc money to buy vehicles, weapons, and pilots to build your own fighting machine and take on some generic missions. Don't let the word ""generic"" fool you, it's still a lot of fun!

Story - It has one, and it is written well. It left me wondering if I was really helping the good guys, which I enjoyed. It is all presented in text format, but I'm not putting tat down at a negative considering the price of the game again.

THE BAD:
Certain levels can be a bit frustrating as you immediately get swarmed by enemies after aggro'ing the first group. It can feel like the 4 choices of pilots/vehicles are not equal, and that there is a right choice for the mission.

Also, the AI is a bit simplistic, which is a bit disappointing.",1471793861,1471793861,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're looking for really good ones, the field gets even smaller. I hoped Ironcast might scratch that itch, but it was far too random and skinner boxy in design. Then I played Galak-Z, and found the controls too finicky and your character too under-powered to enjoy it for long.Then I saw this game, which looked interesting enough to wishlist. I considered whether to get it this week or not, and eventually decided to take a chance on it. I'm quite glad I did, since it's a game easily worth fifteen dollars and its full price.

Brigador takes place on the colony planet of Solo Nobre, whose Great Leader (who seems to have led exactly the same kind of regime you'd expect from a name like that) has recently died. As you might expect, quite a few factions descend on the planet in order to gain it for themselves. You play as a mercenary, or Brigador, working for one who want to liberate the planet from what's left of his regime and anyone else trying to take over - by any means necessary.

You accomplish this through a campaign of twenty-one missions, each of which require you to either destroy certain buildings, take out machines piloted by officers, or just kill hostiles until the game's satisfied. Each one gives you a choice of four different vehicles, each with a different pilot, pair of weapons, and a defensive measure such as a smoke launcher or EMP wave. How you control your mech or tank is probably a pain at first, since they all operate on tank controls except for the anti-grav weapons, which automatically point towards your cursor. This is the same way Galak-Z controlled, but here it feels like the game is designed around it more. The setting too, as unlike Gundam or Macross where a genius pilot can take down overwhelming odds, here it's more like the Votoms series, where pilots fight for money, self-preservation, or the thrill of it instead of heroics. Since you're playing as a bastard, you'll have to fight like one too.

The game gives you plenty of ways to do it. Sneak up behind enemies and blow them apart before they can turn on their shields. Lure them past an exploding bit of the scenery and use it to take out a whole squad in one go. Some mechs have a camouflage system, letting you just walk up and stomp enemies to death if you're so inclined. Every bit of scenery is destructible, allowing you to take whatever shortcuts you want or just blow off steam. Encouraging this are enemies that can raise the alarm, aggroing all the enemies and making them throw up their shields, so anything with that label becomes a priority target.

Completing missions in the campaign gives you money you can spend on the game's other draw, freelance mode. There you can challenge a series of campaigns you need to complete all in one go, using whatever combination of vehicle, pilot and weapons you like. There's also a randomizer option for a pseudo-roguelike experience.

Overall Brigador's a quality experience, and there's no game on Steam quite like it, which is a rare thing to say. The controls take a little getting used to, but the difficulty curve is pretty smooth, and you feel pretty slick once you get the hang of them. There's an option to slow the game down a bit in the options now, and the developers have mentioned they're going to look into absolute controls (ie, like your average twinstick game), although I don't know how much that would improve the game. They seem like quite a nice, active team, so it's unfortunate they still haven't made back their investment producing the game. I hope this review convinces at least a couple people to give it a try.

EDIT: I'm appending this review, which I probably should have done earlier, to note that recently it came about that one of the main developers for the game was discovered to have expressed racist and transphobic opinions elsewhere. He has apologized, but some people have also expressed dissatisfaction with the apology, and despite saying he would be leaving development of the sequel he had recently returned.

While not perfect, the game is [i]easily[/i] worth $15, perhaps even $25, and I do not regret my purchase. (In fact, I am going to give the devs more money and buy the OST.)

There is nothing like it in the market. 

The game is best described as a real time crossover of Jagged Alliance and Mechwarrior. You get to pilot Tanks, Mechs, Hovertanks, of differing sizes and strengths, in various missions encompassing a variety of locations, from agrarian outskirts, to stereotypical surburbs, to dense (and very retro) metropoli.

Did I mention most of the map is fully destructible? Hide behind a skyscraper as an enemy tank column rolls by. At the right moment, trigger your Audio-kinetic pulse, instantly demolishing the entire block. As the hapless crews scramble to battle stations, you take advantage of their thin rear armor and open up with your chaingun. [u]Take no prisoners.[/u]

Outside of the campaign, you can choose your own mix n match set of equipment, weapons, and chassis.

The custom soundtrack, while only 2 hours long, fits the game incredibly well.

Pros:
-Wide variety of different (and viable) builds catering to different playstyles for each player.
-Incredible detail. Your hovertank bobs up and down, and it's shadow changes based on the bobbing. Acceleration, speed, and turning are all handled wonderfully. Some terrain has effects on travel over it, just like in real life.
-Huge variety of weapons; varying from direct fire plasma cannon, machine guns to burning-gas dispensing artillery & laser shotguns.
-Huge variety of chassis; including tiny 1 tread psuedo-motorcycles, giant mecha the size of an apartment building, the ubiquitous (and awesome) hovertank, to a mobile siege tower (mounting decorations made of junked cars, to boot) the size of a miniature skyscraper.
-Interesting and detailed lore, obviously the product of feverishly dedicated worldbuilding.
-Environment works exactly as you'd expect. A tall mech can shoot over a small building, then when the enemy returns fire, crouch to evade (and let the house/apartment act as cover) while your weapon cools down. Baiting an enemy vehicle column through a gas station or ammunition dump is intensely satisfying.
-Amazing (if short) soundtrack.

Cons:
-Pink Menu UI gives headache. Sorry, I'm not hugely into retro.
-In Game UI/HUD feels unpolished, crude and insufficiently informative *and* overbearing at the same time.
-Visibility is awful in many parts of the game. First campaign mission, for example, you don't really see what's going on until the end of the bridge.
-Game somewhat favors the ""charge in and kill stuff"" style against long range sniper/artillery or even hit and run styles; the reammunitioning system and lack of innate shield regeneration basically require you to get close and personal to make the most of battlefield resupply.
-Lack of Campaign flexibility. I'd love to go through the campaign with gear and equipment I've purchased for myself, mix and match depending on the mission requirements. Luckily, you can buy ""the Campaign"" in Freelance mode.
-Pilot System. When I first read the game, I assumed pilots would give bonuses based on specialization. For example, one of the Spacer pilots is clearly noted to ""prefer long range engagements"" and I'd assume she'd give something like +Acc bonus to long range weapons. Instead, pilots are simply a difficulty multiplier.

Also, while I am aware that this would be near-inpossible due to custom-built engine, the concept behind the game (isometric customizable war machines with a variety of styles/builds) would have been perfect for multiplayer.

It's perfect for those who love mechs and blowing up everything. The pros significantly outweigh the cons (in fact there's only one con, in my opinion), but I'll list them anyway:

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
[*]Gameplay is challenging yet fast paced, so if you fall you can immediately get back up and try again. You are rewarded for victory, and even slightly rewarded for failure, so even the most pathetic attempt at a map will net you some monies to buy the next awesome mech.
[*]There is a significantly larger variety of vehicles and customization options than I thought there would be. There are three types of vehicles (mechs, tanks and anti-gravs), but each type has several faction variants with unique loadout options. The variety of weapons is nothing to scoff at, either.
[*]Controls, once mastered, add a layer of complexity to gameplay. Shooting, for example, requires more than just aiming in a given direction - weapons shoot in an arc, so not only must you shoot in the right direction, but you must also aim the end of the arc as close to the enemy as possible to actually hit them. An interesting mechanic for sure.
[*]The art style is very unique, colorful and smooth. I particularly enjoy the pilots' portraits for some reason.
[*]The soundtrack is incredible. The 80's gritty synth tracks are very entertaining to listen to, so much so that you might be tempted to up and buy the OST, as I am.
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b]
[list]
[*]I enjoy reading up on the lore of a new game, and this game is chock full of it. However, the lore entries and even in-game text seem a bit scatterbrained. It's hard to explain - it's as if the game's copy were written by someone who is very proficient in English but does not speak it natively. There is some very intersting word choice and sentence structure that makes some codex entries difficult to read. But this is just me being nit-picky, so don't worry about it.

I just spent all night blowing up city blocks and mechs while playing with a new loadout, which was a ton of fun.

So, Brigador: the best description I've read about this game is that you're playing as Solid Snake while driving a giant metal death machine. It's a tactical game about carefully destroying squads of enemy tanks and mechs before they overwhelm you, and then spending the rest of your time destroying the beautifully hand-crafted maps.

There's a huge amount of content, from the large campaign to the unlimited Freelance mode. The campaign offers a set of maps that you tackle in order with preset mechs. There are four per map to choose from, which often translates to figuring out four different ways to solve the map - some mechs can turn invisible and stealth their way through missions, others explode everything around them. Not to mention the different guns/movement-styles/amount of armor they'll have. Not that you're forced to play through each map four times! Clearing it once is enough to unlock more maps.

Freelance mode, on the other hand, strips away any limitations: choose your pilot, mech, their weaponry, special defensive skill, which maps you're fighting through, and go to town. In this mode you focus on clearing one of three objectives in several maps in a row, and if you finish it successfully you get a large payout.

Ah, money: that's the plot and your motivation to keep playing. Plot-wise you're a mercenary on a world embroiled in a civil war, working for a corporation that wants the place leveled by any means necessary. There's no quibbling over motives or means: just destroy things and get off-planet with your millions in hard-earned cash. As for the money in-game, you use it to unlock more weapons/mechs for Freelance mode, as well as a neat smattering of lore and intel - descriptive pages about the mechs you're piloting and the locations you're destroying.

So that's the gameplay. What's left? The graphics are gorgeous, highly detailed little environs that are satisfying to level. The mechs are varied and interesting to look at, and the UI is slick from the color scheme to the menu design.

The sound is absolutely top-notch with professional musicians providing a synthwave soundtrack that feels perfectly at home in this futuristic war-torn world. I listen to the soundtrack often away from the game just because it's so darned good!

And, ah, the controls: in a game with tanks, the tanks control like tanks. This can be awkward at first, and probably off-putting. Please stick with it! I promise you the game will click for you, and soon you'll be driving around like you were born in a mech. The anti-grav tanks control slightly differently as well, as they orient wherever the mouse is pointing, but again - after you master the learning curve they'll work. (Also, the devs have mentioned that they're looking into adding ""absolute"" controls, for those who just can't make the leap.)

Which leaves...difficulty. The game is hard. It expects you to think and learn on the fly. Fortunately there are two major aids for those of us who aren't good at action games: first, there is no penalty for failing a mission. You'll have to do it over, but you don't lose money or ever make negative progress.

Second, there's a game speed option. This is the crutch I needed: it slows the entire game down to 50%, is fully customizable, and you can change it on the fly. It's meant for playing the game with a controller, but also acts as a difficulty setting without reducing complexity. It made the game far more tactical in my opinion, and gave me time to process what was happening on screen. (60% is my ideal speed - fast enough that things happen, slow enough that I can think about what I'm doing next, and thus lure enemy mechs into traps.)

So, that's a whole lot of words about Brigador! It's really, insanely good. There's nothing quite as satisfying as luring a whole pack of mechs into a dark alleyway as you open up on them with dual machineguns.

The dictator known as 'Great Leader' has died and the evil corporation SNC has put out a 'Brigador' contract for anyone interested in making some money to take out the orbital cannons in the city of Solo Nobre so they can start their invasion from space. 

The game has a very 'morally grey' feel to it and it's all presented though a cold, business like menus where you accept contracts from the SNC and buy new vehicles, weapons and powerups to do your bloody work with. You can also unlock (or rather buy) new pilots that function as a difficulty setting in the game. A more difficult pilot means more and tougher opposition but also a greater paycheck IF you manage to reach the spaceport and make it off-world in one piece. 

All this corporate killing is represented in stylish retro '90ies graphics and goes along with a great Synthwave soundtrack. The soundtrack is available as DLC to listen to in your own living room and there is even an audiobook with great immersion and lore (which i HIGHLY recommend you listen to - it's awesome!). The audiobook is also available as an e-book. Even though bigger games came out this year, 

Brigador is definately my personal GOTY (Game of The Year) title of 2016. I have more then 70 hours put into it and i still find myself coming back to it for just one more run.

- mech game for mech enthusiasts
- lovingly crafted game engine
- great replay value

Cons:
- horrible control design
- story told through expository passages
- lack of character interaction

I have spent a long time deciding how to approach this review. As a huge fan of the MechCommander series, and isometric games in general, there is a lot to love about this game: intricate pixel art, newly built mech engine, deep storyline, great soundtrack, lots of replay value, approachable despite its depth. But for all its triumphs, there are some notable setbacks.

I can only imagine the courage it takes for a newly formed indie developer to create a new game engine from the ground up. A five year endeavor by Stellar Jockeys, Brigador has been a long time in the works and that work shows. I can’t recall the number of times I stopped to appreciate the level of detail. From mission structure to game mechanics to the surprisingly great AUDIO BOOK?! (more on this later), so much thought went into this game.

At its core, Brigador is a mission-based, real time, tactical mech game split into two game modes, Campaign and Freelance. In campaign mode, you begin as a soldier piloting a mech at the exact moment that the “great leader” of a planet wide totalitarian dictatorship has perished (not so subtly based on North Korea). The story then plays out in a string of missions depicting your desertion from the regime as you fight your way to becoming a brigador, a mech-piloting mercenary.

In reality, the campaign exists to get you acquainted with the game world. It’s where you discover whether your preference is sneaking your way through missions as you strike targets with surgical precision, or stomping across the battlefield, dismantling all that would oppose you.

And Brigador gives you that freedom. Impressively, the game engine is built as a mech sandbox: enemies perform patrols and exhibit behavioral patterns, mech and weapon choice affect how detectable you are by the enemy, and environments are fully destructible allowing you to forge your own path towards objectives. Once you are comfortable with the game’s foundation, your career continues as a mech-for-hire in freelance mode, arguably the heart of Brigador.

Surprisingly, the campaign acts as a prologue to Freelance mode. Freelance mode is all about the minutiae of mech-piloting. No longer restricted to the predefined load-outs offered during the campaign, the player is free to customize every facet of their mech: pilots based on skill, mech bodies of varying strengths and weaknesses, bi-pedal motion or hovering, weapons based on ammo efficiency and damage type. In short, parting out your ideal mech is where you'll spend the majority of your time.

As much as there is to say about the game, even more can be said about its atmosphere. The entire game plays out at nighttime, with lighting effects to match: enemy spotlights cause debris to cast shadows, industrial locations are bathed in an orange glow. Sound wise, hauntingly synthesized electronica elevates Brigador’s entire soundscape. Seriously, the soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set stupidly good.

What’s more, an audio book can be purchased alongside the game, allowing you to delve deeper into the game world’s origins. In a way, Brigador follows a three act structure, with the audio book serving as Act 1, the campaign as Act 2, and freelance mode as Act 3. It’s all kind of meta in a way.

But the game’s atmosphere doesn’t remain unbroken. It’s clear that certain sacrifices had to be made, limiting Brigador’s engine. For instance, every level is a completely flat surface suspended in a black void. The game (sans audiobook) is almost entirely devoid of personality. There’s a complete lack of character interaction and the only story to speak of is a page of text that immediately precedes each level. But most egregious are the controls; they’re tank controls.

I get the rationale; it’s a make a mech game with a control scheme to match. But tank controls died for a reason and should stay dead. Simply put, they’re fucking horrible. Movement in relation to the character, not the camera, was a necessity at the time, but a mistake today. To make matters worse, it doesn’t have just one set of tank controls, but two. Depending on the type of mech you’re using, you either turn left/right or strafe left/right. Even after playing through the entire campaign, I still felt like I had no control over my mech.

Despite all it has going for it, Brigador ultimately feels like a game out of time. What would’ve been a great game ten years ago, feels like a good game today. Oddly enough, while the controls stop me from playing the game, they don’t stop me from enjoying the soundtrack and audio book. It’s strange to say, but I think they both turned out better than the game.

I remember Syndicate Wars, which apart from being badly reviewed, was an extremely well-made continuation of the premise. You go into environment, do your stuff and there is collateral. The interesting collateral in Syndicate Wars were the buildings.

Now Brigador. This game is the game, which I have always wanted to make myself. Buildings coming down, lights going out when the sonic wave from my towering behemoth machine levels a few neighbouring blocks, bombarding a far-away train-yard, waiting for a second, then sending a next volley to devastate the investigating troops.

This is an old school clever shoot-em-up game with the feeling that Syndicate evoked at the time. With more lights and more destruction and way less story. I'd like to have more story, but as a culmination of my ever-lingering hope for a game in which I can go around and level a city-block in neon lights and in which the map tells a story of a location which turns into a war-zone.

Each unit comes in three classes (mechs, tanks, and air) with a large variety of weapons; several special abilities are also available. Brigador is played from an isometric perspective; controls are handled using the WASD keys to move and turn, with the mouse reserved for aiming the weapons. Handy firing arcs are shown for both the primary and secondary weapons. The AI isn’t smart as much as it is numerous. Adept use of the controls, along with intelligent use of special abilities and weapons, is key to success. Brigador is a challenging mech game with lots of action that desperately needs adjustable difficulty.

- Stompy mech combat that is a perfect balance between arcadey and tactical. The game pace is snappy and combat is fluid, but so far hasn't been relentless or overwhelming.

- Battles are intense with lots of variety catering to different play styles. Scrappy engagements punctuate maneuvering and objective-hunting.

-Not really sure what to think about the “plot” (backstory may be a better term?). There's a lot there, but it seems a little fractured- not sure if that's on purpose or not. I am having trouble following along- it's confusing and a little dry for my taste, but that's okay because the actual game is fun enough that I don't need a justification for blowing everything up.

- The tank controls are awkward at first, but I think it translates nicely into how you would expect a giant mech to move. They definitely add to the unpredictability of the combat (in a good way). Surprisingly, I feel I have been my most graceful when I stop thinking about movement and just let my fingers do their thing. Trust me, if you do it too, you'll suddenly stop stomping around in circles after about 15 minutes. Just get through the tutorials- the real learning happens in the first few missions! 

- Is Brigador worth $20? IMO Brigador offers enough content, variety, balance, and polish to justify the asking price.

- Great effort by the dev team! There's no reason why this game shouldn't be a Steam indie favorite.

Gameplay is challenging, but fair. The tank controls are actually pretty easy to pick up, contrary to what other reviewers seem to be saying, and the main challenge lies within the actual gameplay, not mastering the controls, or fighting the UI. 

One of the finest things about this game is the sheer size of the maps, and the number of enemies that can swarm you. Being able to react correctly and deal with your surroundings is key, as well as 

Lore, I have heard a few people bash this games lore; they are wrong. The universe crafted here is intricate and interesting. Each corner of the massive maps reveals some odd detai, wether it is the way in which the hedges are shaped to keep the aristocrats away from the industrial camps, or the miles of graves marking half of a few maps, their is allways something interesting to find. The different flavor texts around the game both describe the culture and history of this amazing universe. 

And then there is the audiobook.  


I know it might seem weird, but truly, this might have been the bullseye that made the cake for my experience with Brigador.

Desert Strike and Syndicate have a neon-tinged HD baby in this visually arresting tank shooter, featuring a wonderful soundtrack and enormous customizability.

Novo Solo has been under the reign of a tyrant known only as ""Great Leader"" for as long as anyone still alive remembers. His sudden passing has left the capital, Solo Nobre in turmoil. As one of many ""Brigadors"" hired on by the definitely-not-evil SNC, you are tasked with staging sucicidal assaults throughout the capital in one of nearly fifty tanks, aircraft, and walkers customizable with over eighty weapons, ranging from explosive autocannons to repeating lasers.

Although the game certainly is among the pricier indie titles on Steam, let me assure you it's been worth every penny so far.

You have one life, and the only limit is how far you're willing to push your luck for more cash. BRIGADOR rewards proper planning as well as deadeye precision, boasting a full visibility and stealth system. You don't always have to outshoot your opponents if you can outwit them.

There are a few quibbles prospective players should consider, however.

            BRIGADOR  >  CURE FOR CANCER

Well this is a damn good game and a smart purchase for sure but the gameplay alone did not quantify my theory.  So I again I scratch my head and lose myself in meditation and slowly I piece 2 and 2 together and had an epiphany. Armed with this knowledge I smiled to myself, stood up from my desk, walked into my bedroom, and told the bitch I married I was filing for divorce. No cure for cancer could ever compare to the feeling of joy and hope spreading through my body right now.

-You can choose your weapons and mech type,
-You can blow up everything
-You can run out of ammo after having blown up everything

-The controls do take a sec to get used to but you shouldn't let that stop you
-The maps seem to repeat way more then I would like. After having played as much as I have there just isn't anything more for me to do beside play the same levels over and over. I wish more time would have been put into having more variety in the maps and less into the mechs themselves. I found the combination I like and now have nothing to do with it.
-Long and boring or instant death...(this is also a pro) Even with my heavy mech you have to be safe as if you set off an alarm you can easily become overwhelmed and die in about 30 seconds after 45 minutes of play. This forced me to play kill 3-5 guys at a time which can become a slog and after I killed everything I then have to walk the whole length of the map back to the exit taking 5 min....so so so boring.

Today marks the release of the Up-Armored edition. As flamed as I was by the community for suggesting improvements, it seems the devs took note (of mine or others criticisms), and added much value to this game. As a result it no longer feels ""rushed out of EA"", and is well worth your time. I will leave the old review as it still has some relevence.
---------------
Rushed out of EA and not sure why. A few more months, a little more feedback and I think this could have been a real gem.

The game has a cool story trapped behind a cold game menu through which it is told. This is made more frustrating after they went to the trouble of having someone write and voice an audio-book but didn't include a single sound bite in the game.

There are a couple dozen unique drivers each with their own stories and ""traits"" that effect your final score. But those stories are so coldly told through the games menu that the driver becomes nothing more than a score multiplier.

A few cut scenes similar to what you might find in cryptark or invisible inc. Simple text and pixel portraits could have really gone a long way in connecting the player with the avatar.

The unlock system feels a little blind at times, you'll often spend a mill on some lore and a few mill on a driver only to feel like you just stuck your hand in a lucky dip or played pin the tale on the donkey, with the only consolation being that all the prizes were pretty crap so what difference does it make what you get.

Now if the lore had been audio logs, or part of the audio book along side the menu text, it would have been worth a mill.. and that driver, if it came with 3 or 4 personalised text boxes expressing their motives for risking their lives, placed next to their portraits at the start of the first 3 or 4 Freelance missions I took 'em on, maybe I'd care about them and be inclined to learn about another.

Some of the stories told through the menus are emotive but feel like a chore to connect with. It's a real shame.

The game looks great imo, music is perfect, it's that new retro wave.
Controls are perfect imo also, some people complain about them, but if you give them a chance and think about the logistics they work well and make sense.

It's in the variety of vehicles and weapons that this game really shines, while missions can feel similar (due to having little to no investment in any of the characters or the story), it's the loadout that makes a run unique. Vehicles have their own feel and can't all support the same mounts, so with weapons ranging from explosives with arch like firing arcs to machine gun lazers, there is absolutely an incentive and desire to experiment. 

+ Beautiful game, lovely lighting
+ Lots of unlockables
+ Great ost and sfx
+ Lots of lore (though poorly implemented)
+ Fun guns
+ Strong level design
+ Interesting vehicles
+ Fair amount of content
+ Multiple ways to finish your mission

- Feels rushed
- Some bugs (known about since EA)
- No ability to zoom in on the lovely pixelated mechs and weps, not even through the Acquisitions menu
- Poor use of wonderfully crafted lore
- Missions can feel the same, with little to no investment in any of the characters or the story
- No Auto forward key (trust me it needs one)
- No level editor

Freelance mode gives you a chance to customize your loadout and play with exactly what you want, but also to experiment and try new combinations.

And it shines with the combinations.  There are 4 vehicle types, many vehicles per type, and multiple weapon classes to load up with.  All weapons, not to mentuion the vehicles, have their pros and cons, although I'm fond of the war-crime-in-a-can that is the Ploughman.

The atmosphere is the big standout for me.  It's set on an isolationist totalitarian planet where the leader has just died, and a mercenary group has decided to take advantage and destroy not only loyalist targets, but competitors as well.  The visuals, details, and especially the music stress the amorality of your mission and your actions, and the game is richer for it.  

Just so this doesn't seem overly fawning, the controls do take a little getting used to.  It does use tank controls, yes, but you are driving futuristic tanks, so I can't really fault them there.  The enemies do have a tendency to swarm after the first few shots, but the devs seem to be working on that, and honestly, it makes sense that firing heavy artillery draws attention.  Really, it's difficult to call them faults so much as an acquired taste.

I think one of my favorite things about this game (and it's a tough choice with so many cool things in the game) is the mechanical designs for the vehicles. I think Gauss has put more quality original mechs, tanks and agravs than any dozen sci-fi AAA games put together.

Of course, the cool art would have gone to waste without each vehicle having it's own feel and personality in the gameplay.

When I saw people complaining online about the tank controls for the tanks, my suggestion was to make the controls even more challenging -- so you can thank them for not listening to me and keeping what I consider the ""easy"" controls :P

MAVS soundtrack is DOPE, obvs. 

I think another thing worth mentioning is how much stuff there is in this game. I can't think of another indie game that has as much quality content as this game. There is an awesome book with it too. Yeah, a book.

// - Update from 2017

I've owned this game for about a year, and it remains my favorite games of 2016. Everything's so well done that I can't help but recommend it to people, give it as gifts, and sing its praises at every opportunity.

The Up-Armored Edition adds a brand new tutorial campaign (though it's long enough and engaging enough that it barely feels like a tutorial, especially toward the end), updated graphics, new pilots and vehicles, and some new options to help new players feel more in-control. At $20, this game is an utter steal, and I can't wait to see what the aptly named Stellar Jockeys do next.

// - Original review from 2016

This game owns, grab it

The tank controls are a bit weird, yes, but you get used to them soon enough (I felt competent at controlling the game about 30 minutes in). IMO it really adds to the feel of the game, you're piloting gigantic steel mechs and tanks and it should feel like it. Not enough media these days treat giant robots with the weight they deserve.

The graphics are amazing. Brigador shot for a retro feel in many ways, and while they certainly nailed it on all fronts, both the art direction and the technical bits are something to behold. Loading up the game and playing it, I don't feel like I'm playing a game from 2016. I feel like I'm playing a source port or a patched version of a late-90s game. The isometric view calls to mind games like Syndicate and X-Com (and strangely enough for me, Roller Coaster Tycoon), while the per-pixel lighting effects remind me of the mid-to-late 90s brief flirtation with voxels as seen in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Outcast.

The atmosphere is all-consuming, the lore and writing is compelling, and I can't help but get lost in the world of Solo Nobre and its struggle.

This game has made leaps and bounds since releasing in early access on Steam and becoming a fully-fledged title this month. It demands a steady hand, cool nerves, and balls of steel and is uncompromising in its pursuit of delivering a tough but unique and stylish action game. There are still some rough edges, but I know that the creators are still hard at work adding the finishing touches to an already impressive title.

Some words of wisdom for fans of games like Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon: at a first glance this game might seem to have strange controls and a deceptive aim assist. Keep in mind that there are tangible benefits to having direct control on the direction your vehicle faces: you are vulnerable in your rear and sides but protected at the front, and the same goes for the enemy. Additionally, manual control of where your shots go is key to ambush and stealth tactics but also means you must ""think in 3d"" and adjust your shots to hit flying or small targets.

It's certainly possible to play it that way, but you probably won't achieve great success. It's a little slower than that, a bit of a light sim. To truely shine you need scheme and ambush. Pop through trees onto unsuspecting baddies, dash around corners to stomp sentries to death before they can call for help, toss long bomb artillary from several city blocks away on top of a tank group, drop smoke and turn main street into a killing field, that sort of stuff. It becomes increasingly satisfying as these little thing become second nature, and you find yourself rending armies into heaps of burning wreckage without a scratch.

There's a lot to do and unlock in this game. There's the standard campaign mode where on most missions you'll choose from one of four vehicles as a sort of difficulty selector, and then the freelance mode with a seemingly endless combination of vehicles and weapons and dozens of maps. Enough to keep you busy for awhile. They did a good job on the varity of vehicles and weaponry as well. While some certainly feel similar to others they never feel copy pasted.

I really like this game. It's great to hop into for 30 minutes and have a quick bit of fun, and it's also got that ""well just one more time"" hook that has you looking up and realizing you've been playing for 6 hours. It may seem a bit fiddly at first, but give it some time, get the feel for it, and remember that you're piloting a vehicle not hoofing it around. Be sure to try out all the different vehicle classes since they all control differently, and you maybe all thumbs with a mech, but a natural in a-grav. I'd personally recommend starting off with the tank type since I think it will feel more familiar to most people. Also the distance you aim controls the altitude of the shot, so if you want to nail that a-grav in your face you need to aim far past them.",1467164503,1467164503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Brigador è il loro primo videogioco “commerciale”, rilasciato lo scorso 2 giugno; una versione alfa del gioco era disponibile già dal 16 ottobre 2015.


[h1]CONTRACTOR[/h1]
Brigador ci mette nei panni di un Pilota detto “Contractor”; firmato un contratto chiamato “Brigador Action Agreement” offriremo i nostri servigi alla Solo Nobre Concern (S.N.C.).
La S.N.C. paga profumatamente i suoi Contractor, i quali dovranno distruggere gli obbiettivi designati. La storia è una mera scusa per far saltare in aria qualsiasi cosa ci capiti a tiro e il titolo di Stellar Jockeys fa ben poco per nascondere questa verità.

Il gioco si divide in una campagna principale ed una modalità Freelance.
La Campagna è composta da 21 Missioni, dove si avranno a disposizione vari veicoli tra cui Mech, Carri Corazzati e Agrav (ibridi tra un carro corazzato e un velivolo). Ognuna di queste macro-categorie contiene veicoli diversi tra loro, ma simili nelle proprietà principali, per esempio i Carri hanno maggiore resistenza e potenza di fuoco, gli Agrav sono più agili e veloci, i Mech sono una via di mezzo con una notevole potenza di fuoco in alcuni casi, o maggiore mobilità in altri.

In entrambe le modalità di cui sopra, per ogni missione (o contratto per essere precisi) compiuta guadagneremo crediti (completare obbiettivi secondari, o semplicemente distruggere strutture, nemici, etc., aumenterà notevolmente il numero di crediti guadagnati) che potranno essere spesi per sbloccare nuovi piloti, veicoli, equipaggiamenti, missioni per la modalità freelance, informazioni addizionali e lore.

La modalità Freelance, a differenza della campagna, offre la possibilità di modificare a piacimento i veicoli a disposizione, oltre alla possibilità di scegliere il pilota che più ci aggrada, ognuno dei quali ha delle sue caratteristiche uniche. Di fatti è proprio in questa modalità che il gioco dà il meglio di sé, poiché avremo la possibilità di creare la nostra macchina da guerra definitiva.


[h1]NON È TUTTO METALLO CIÒ CHE SI ACCARTOCCIA[/h1]
Purtroppo però manovrare i veicoli di questo gioco basato sul twin stick control risulta spesso macchinoso e/o ostico, quindi sopratutto con veicoli più lenti si rischia di essere spesso intrappolati dai nemici senza via di scampo.
Sicuramente con la pratica, e anche grazie alla personalizzazione dei veicoli, questo problema può essere risolto, ma considerando che morendo si perderanno tutti i progressi svolti in una certa mappa, alcune missioni possono risultare  alquanto frustranti, soprattutto per quei giocatori che non intendono affrontare un alto e impegnativo grado di sfida cimentandosi in un gioco simile.


[h1]LA GRAFICA NON È TUTTO, ANZI…[/h1]
Dal punto di vista grafico Brigador non riesce a (o forse semplicemente non vuole) competere con altri titoli isometrici anche più datati. Stellar Jockeys ha puntato più sul comparto audio con tracce originali stile neo-anni 80 (per rendere l’idea: lo stile di Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon) davvero avvincenti ed appropriate oltre ad ambientazioni fantastiche, le quali possono essere completamente rase al suolo. Ricordiamo che in passato altri titoli hanno trovato fortuna proprio grazie a questi due elementi (e non per la grafica) come ad esempio Hot Line Miami.

Insieme al gioco è possibile acquistare il DLC che comprende tutti i brani del gioco e un audiolibro che spiega parte della storia del gioco ampliando ulteriormente la lore dello stesso.
Inoltre le tracce del gioco sono anche disponibili in formato Vinile, a quanto pare solo per un periodo limitato di tempo.


[h1]CONCLUSIONI[/h1]
Brigador è un buon scrolling shooter, divertente e teso. Il costo potrebbe sembrare effettivamente un po’ elevato, considerando che non vi è una modalità multiplayer, ma la varietà di veicoli, e la possibilità di modificarli a proprio piacimento aumentano notevolmente la rigiocabilità del titolo (i completisti avranno un bel po’ da fare per sbloccare tutto quello che il gioco offre).",1467134614,1467135042,True,6,0,0.523946106433868408,0,False,True,False,False,,,

With a dizzying array of weapons and base mechs the game is a playground for anyone with destructive tendancies. Some loadouts are all about mobility, hitting and running and whittling your enemy down. Some are about stealth, moving quietly from point to point while you gun down lone patrols. And of course, some times you have to heap on heavy weapons that wake up the whole neighborhood as your blowing it up.

What makes it great is that what sounds like simple mayhem becomes a ballet of drawing enemy attention, destroying and perserving cover to funnel enemies into spots where you can pick them off, and figuring out how to survive when the alarm goes off and the entire map wakes up on you.

The base missions offer some well built challenges that act as sort of a test run for certain configurations of weapons, but  the bragging rights come from stacking on challenge modifiers on top of taking long multi-map contracts in freelance mode (the challenge of each mission set in freelance is further modified via pilot choice, an inspired game design idea)

To be completely honest, the game's interfacing confused me at first. There's a lot of information. However, it takes nothing more than one calm breath, and an agreement to focus on what the game has to offer.

Normally with games like this there will be at least one weapon or vehicle type that you can basically ignore for one reason or another, but every weapon really manages to feel unique and useful while the vehicles on offer cater to pretty much any playstyle. I've got five hours into the game as of the time of writing this, and I've barely been able to scratch the surface of the content available. 

I have two very minor points of constructive criticism, but neither one is likely to affect your enjoyment of the game. The first is that currently missions pay a pretty small percentage of their total value if you're unable to complete it or die. Normally not a problem, but due to the way missions unlock in Freelance mode it wouldn't be a terrible thing if even just the first few missions had a higher rate on your return for failed missions. 

The second minor quibble and the one I do care more about is that while the mechs sound fine, there wasn't much impression of weight. This is probably a really difficult balance to reach, as I can honestly only think of one game where characters/vehicles that were supposed to be incredibly heavy actually sounded it (Warhammer 40k: Space Marine). Given that, I wouldn't be heartbroken if that change went unimplemented, but adding some weight to the mech sounds would really put the sound design over the top.

As a person who reviews games for a living, I don't ever review them seriously on Steam. I'm changing that because this game is great, and deserves more hype behind it.

Here's the deal. Brigador is a wonderful, plucky game. It mixes and matches genres, grabs you by the face, and slams you back into the 1980s view of what 2100 should be. I love the aesthetic here.

It's a gritty, neon-lit, free-for-all shootout. Duck. Cover. Shoot. Cloak. Run up and stomp a bunch of baddies. Shoot. Cover. Shoot. Reload. Blow a bunch of sh*t up. It's good, clean, tactical fun.

Build yourself a vehicle that tailors to your play style, a-la roguelike. Wanna zoom around in a flying car and shoot tanks while they struggle to hit you? Want to take a walkermech and level a city block? Want to build a killdozer and just run over a bunch of sh*t? DO YOU? GOOD. BUILD ONE.

Music in the game? Fantastic. Makeup and Vanity Set released music that I think is on-par with the soundtrack of Hotline Miami 2, which is one of my favorite albums ever. Not just ""video game music"" album, but music in general. That's what this soundtrack is like. 
 
Do I have some critiques? Yeah, sometimes I find that the game is a little heavy on keyboard controls, feels like a roguelike minus the turn-by-turn playing. Gets a little rough sometimes, but it's not insurmountable. I feel like controller support would be fantastic, because it'd really drive home that twin-stick vibe you get from playing this game. But you now what? It's not needed, and if I spent more time playing the game (though life often gets in the way) I think it would become second nature. 

Brigador is fun. Brigador was designed by people who obviously wanted a game that is just tons of fun to play. And this game deserves the good press it gets here on Steam.  The price tag is not that steep. You get tons of action packed into a neat little package. Is it replayable? Hell yeah, it is.

If you haven't snagged it yet because you were uneasy about the price, as a person who has played the game, even if it was only for a little while, I can tell you: It's every bit as good as we're all saying. Honestly, I'm probably going to gift it to my tactical-shooter friends once the holiday season rolls around, because it has that much mass appeal.

This game is sweet and deserves more love.  If the tank controls are scaring you off, the hovercraft handle by tracking your cursor and can strafe (Relative to your position).

Letting your freelance runs range across whatever side of power fantasy to max difficulty at all times you want.  With assorted scaling difficulty options as well.  Do you want 0-6? 0-9?

And that's pretty much it.  Mechs have a crouch button that lets you reduce incoming damage, but I forget about it half the time and have no trouble.
Where the sophistication comes in, is in destruction and in game sound.  Weapons make noise, which can alert enemies.    This is in part a hazard, shoot your guns too recklessly and everyone on the map will charge you in seconds, but it can be used to your benefit as well.  You can use the sound your weapon generates to draw enemies into killzones or away from objectives, and holding fire is a valid tactic to avoid detection.  It's not quite possible to actually complete a level using just stealth, but with a little patience and observation you can completely control the pace of combat.  Terrain is also almost completely destructible.  As well as adding some fun visuals to the combat, as the districts will inevitably lose buildings and parts thereof as the battle moves around, this allows new angles of approach, such as shooting through terrain to attack from cover if your weapon has the penetration, or making a new entry way into a fortified area or a corridor to hide in or lure enemies down.  Add to this varying weapon trajectories, ammunition amounts and flight speeds, the end result is, simply put, a lot of options.

The game is not perfect.  While I like the world building they've done, the campaign is really just a series of challenges and there is no story to speak of.  It works well as an excuse for the destruction, and the writing in the descriptions is ranges from mediocre to good, but people looking for an epic tale will need to go elsewhere.
Gameplay can get a bit cluttered as well.  It can be easy to lose track of which way your legs or treads are facing in the middle of combat, causing you to run toward rather than away from the city sized tank bearing down on you; and many times I've tried to shoot around a corner only to have my cannon clip the side of a building I'm using as cover, which at best wastes some ammo and at worse catches me in the blast of the shot.  Some of the premade vehicle builds in the campaign can be pretty frustrating to use, especially for some of the levels in which they're available, but that's just a nitpick, as there's no stage that needs you to play all vehicles, and at least one in each level is straightforward to play.

Overall this is a game I heartily recommend if you're looking for some no-context destructive fun.  Simple to get into but with a lot of nuance and aspects to learn, I would say it's well worth the price.",1465682932,1700541817,True,16,0,0.622079789638519287,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're not the target audience then you won't get much out of the game, but if you are then you're in for a treat. If I had to describe Brigador's game dynamic in one sentence it would be this: It's a game that allows you to revel in mindless destruction but rewards you for deeper tactical thinking.

On the surface the game is pretty straight forward: a twin stick shooter where you pilot a warmachine in a city full of hostiles with the goal of fucking shit up. However the core mechanics go deeper than the label ""twin stick shooter""implies. For one thing there are three controllable vehicle types: mechs, tanks and hover-tanks (agravs) each with different control schemes and inherent abilities. Tanks work the way you'd expect, mechs can crouch down to lower their profile as well as perform a melee stomp action while agravs can fly over low obstacles and side strafe but have no independently tracking turret. Height is an important factor as well; if you're using a big mech or a tower tank your weapons fire from on high and can draw line of sight over shorter pieces of cover, on the flip side it becomes harder to target small units as they get closer to you.

The use of terrain is important too. Almost all the maps are a variation on a congested future cityscape. The terrain is dense but also destructible. All vehicles have the ability to destroy terrain just by driving into it so navigating the various walled off sections of the map is not a problem. Wrecking the terrain is also a satisfying activity, however certain terrain pieces will explode when destroyed, killing you in one hit if you're next to them, or wiping out your shield and reducing you to a sliver of health if you're lucky. Learning which terrain pieces are explosive has to be done by trial and error.

But the terrain is more than just something there for you to destroy. Smart use of terrain can provide cover against powerful enemies or be used to funnel swarms of enemies into a choke point. On harder difficulties taking advantage of terrain is essential to survivial.

The game comes with two modes: Campaign and Freelance. The campaign can be seen as an assortment of tutorial and challenge missions that familiarise you with the gameplay and sometimes offers an interesting challenge. With the exception of the first few tutorial missions each campign mission lets you choose from a preset group of four pilots and their vehicles. This can be roughly interpretted as a difficulty level. You see not all the pilots or vehicles are equal. You want an easier time then choose the one with the heaviest vehicle and the biggest guns. If you want something harder then try the same mission using the guy with the dinky little treadbike. Completionists will want to finish each level using all four characters but for the rest of us completing the mission with only one is sufficient to advance the campaign. 

Freelance mode is where you'll sink countless hours in. Here you can pick a pilot and vehicle with a customisable loadout to undertake an operation. An operation is series of missions across different sectors in the game's fictional city of Solo Nobre. Each mission follows the same format: There are three primary objectives: Destroy all the anti-orbital cannons, kill all the leader units or wipe out the majority of the local enemy forces. You need only complete one to advance to the next mission but if you complete them all the rewards will be higher. Complete every mission in the operation without dying and you will be rewarded with money that you can use to purchase more vehicles, weapons, pilots and more challenging operations. However if you die at any point (even right at the end) you will only get a tiny reward.

Freelance mode really lets you tailor the experience to your liking. I was surprised to find that all the lighter units in the game cost more to unlock than the heavier ones. Then I realised it was not because they were better, it was because they were more challenging to play.  Pilots determine how difficult the enemies get. Some pilots fix the enemies at a ceratain level while others start the difficulty low and cause it to ramp up as the operation progresses. This really goes a long way to tailoring the play experience. If you want an easy game choose a low level pilot, a big heavy vehicle and a short operation, but if you want a serious challenge, take on a long operation with a tiny powersuit. The hardest operation is something called the ""Closed Casket Special""; It's 39 missions long and with no possibility for an early exit. I have no idea how the devs expect anyone to do that thing in a mongoose or troubadour.

My favourite part of the setting is the world setting and lore. Now the game tells you very little up front. You are a corporate mercenary on the backwater colony of Solo Novo tasked with carrying out missions the completion of which will aid the corporation in securing control of the colony. If you just want to play the game it will not trouble you with anything more than that, but if you look into the lore documents and pilot bios you will uncover the story of desperate people trapped on a shit hole of a planet between an evil mega corporation and a tyranical dictatorship. The three factions have a lot of personality and it shows in their vehicle designs. The Loyalists are the remnents of the local military and their units are tough and functional, the Corvids are a bunch of scrappy freedom fighters that ride into battle on improvised vehicles with oversized weapon mounts, The Spacers are arrogant offworlders that have the best technology and as a result their units have more powerful shields. The art style does a good job of conveying all of this while still looking ""öld school"". On a side note if you enjoy the backstory and want more I recommend getting the audio book. The writing is decent and it makes for an entertaining (if somewhat formulaic) war story. The book ends on a cliff hanger and is apparently only part one. I hope the rest comes out soon and not as paid DLC.

Now for the thing everybody critisises the game about: the controls and interface. The game goes to admirable lengths to make sure all the information you need is displayed in as elegant a way as possible however it's still hard to gauge exactly where a shot will land from the isometric perspective. This is esspecially annoyng since the game asks you to take height into account.  You learn to compensate for the perspective but sometimes I still have trobule using precision weapons in dense terrain.

The controls are hard to get your head around, or rather your muscle memory around since they are ""tank""controls rather than ""cardinal"" controls. Pressing forward makes your vehicle move in the direction it's facing instead of up. This means you need to think about steering your vehicle and I just can't focus on tracking targets AND manoevering at the same time. Many times I've been shooting at an enemy and evading only to find that I crashed into a wall and got focussed down by mooks while I was focussed on shooting the big guys. This gets even more wonky when you're strafing with an agrav since pressing left will make it strafe to it's left not your left, effectively inverting the controls if you're facing down. As it stands I don't bother with agravs on higher difficulty levels. I mainly have to rely more on tactical positioning rather than raw twitch skill to win a fight. This is not game breaking per say, Brigador doesn't quite have bullet hell levels of incoming fire but if you get caught in a swarm of enemies the controls make weaving between them awkaward. One could argue that Brigador is meant to be a more tactical and methodical experience rather than a twich based one but I'd say your mileage may vary.

Pros:
-It plays a little bit like a twinstick shooter, but with more complex aiming (the aiming is 3D).
-There is a ton of customisation - you can choose your vehicle, weapons and a pilot in freelance mode. In campaign, you can choose between preset loadouts (different for each mission).
-Your loadout can heavily influence your playstyle. You can be a stealthy hit and run bastard. You can speed around in a flying tank and avoid hits like crazy. Or you can pick some superheavy monstrosity and methodicaly annihilate any oposition with hard hitting doomsday weapons. The choice is yours.
-Even though there is no difficulty setting, you can influence the difficulty by your loadout. In freelance mode, your pilot choice functions as a difficulty modifier.
-The campaign is decently long and if you plan to finish every mission with every preset loadout, it will keep you entertained for some time.
-Mission descriptions and encyclopedia entries are hillarious.
-The music is great.
-The audibook (DLC) reminds me of those old Battletech inspired books. Unrelenting torrent of action, mayhem, and cheese. Its a delicious junkfood for your brain.
-It's visual style is great and it manages to strike perfect ballance between retro feel and responsive gameplay. Vehicles are sprites with very retro ""choppy"" animations, but the game itself runs at high framerate with all that responsiveness we want from our modern games.
-Devs are active on the forum and they are eager to help with technical problems and bugs. And they are still working on the game.

Cons:
-The game can be really punishing, before you get used to the aiming mechanics.

Now it’s inhabited by a detachment of angry Corvid fighters sporting homemade mechs and tanks and a myriad of things in-between. Beyond that, a commercial district which also services the spaceport behind. Therein lies the goal.

I cycle the Rounder’s cloaking field and shimmy forward a few hundred yards. Before the field disengages I’ve got the Zeus Railgun and the Crambo machine gun aimed at a squad of Corvids oblivious to my position.  The rail slug pierces through machinery and flesh alike, half the hostiles gone in a blink. I send the Rounder back and reengage the cloak as the remainder of the squad races towards my last known position. Instead of launching another precious slug I aim the Crambo at the fuel station that runs adjacent to the street. Second half of the Corvid squad evaporates in the explosion, except for some little mech that manages to get a signal out before I shred it.

Sirens.

Engines.

Big mechanical footsteps.

Sounds that are fine in moderation but as the saying goes, you can have too much of a good thing. I shunt everything into the engine and pull a hard right, plough straight through a concrete wall and burn towards the spaceport. Every street I pass by is chock full of armour, far more than the contract suggested. The outside of the tank flares blue as tracer fire is deflected away from the hull of the tank. Rockets streak overhead cratering the path I’d taken. Buildings collapse and explode and then sixty seconds later I find myself in sight of the tug that’s going to take me to orbit, along with mech nearly as tall as an orbital cannon. A mech that has two Zeus railguns like mine.  Aimed at me. They flash.

Instinct kicks in. The barrier between my flesh and my Rounder tank disappears. The first slug blows the shields out while the second blows at hole somewhere in the hull that lets light from outside leak into the cockpit. Sparks shower my bare shoulders, the smell of burning metal fills my nose. Somehow the cloak still works and I disappear. The mech’s torso swivels, trying to recapture a lock. Instead of turning tail I tear straight for it. My face slams into the control panel as the tanks hull impacts the mech’s leg, it stumbles. I fire my final rail slug point blank into its ankle.

And that’s what a couple minutes in Brigador is like.

The Developers listened, if not to me, but to people generally, I want to thank them, marry them, do many romantic things to them. THANK YOU[/i]

[H1]Cyberpunk mech drama in a town that wants you out of the way.[/H1]

First and foremost, this isn't the mech game that Mechwarrior purists are looking for. It has [i]elements[/i] of the things that a Mechwarrior type gamer would be looking for, and it may appeal to those kinds of players, but it's not an actual Mechwarrior game. This is still very much a twinstick shooter of sorts, but with a more deliberate, thoughtful take, where the choice of mech, pilot, and loadout does factor into the difficulty of the run through the city. You'll be managing your ammo and making sure your shots count, you'll be prioritising your targets, and the mechs, tanks and antigravs all look and -feel- very different from one another, but this is [i]not an actual Mechwarrior[/i] game.

For that, you'll want the game that Harebrained Schemes are brewing. That, is going to be the game that the Mechwarrior mech-heads are all looking for, I've backed it to the Valhalla tier and it's looking mighty fine. But enough of that, Brigador is a different and very unique beast. It's definitely interesting, but is it good?

The answer? -mostly-

[H1]It's got all the fundamentals of a twinstick, but...[/H1]

Firstly you'll have to make some fundamental adjustments, you do not have ""cardinal"" controls, you can't just use WSAD to direct the mech in the eight directions as you wish, instead the game uses ""tank"" controls, with A and D rotating your vehicle, and W and S making it travel forward and backward along the plane it now faces, there's a spotlight which helps keep you orientated but make no mistake, this does take time to get used to. For people used to traditional twinsticks where your controls are a 1:1 analog of what's going on, this is a shift you'll have to adapt to. 

Until the most recent patch, this was your sole option, and it was a bit of a mixed bag but now? CARDINAL DIRECTIONS ARE IN BABY, and what's more you can have ""True upward"" for WSAD or ""Isometric upward left/right"" for if you're more used to that line of thinking, which is perfect. More options for various players is JUST what the doctor ordered. Suddenly this game has gone from niche to being accessible to everyone. If you like and feel tank controls are atmospheric, go nuts, they're still there, but for people like me who just can't handle them that well, I have an option that removes that issue, and being able to know that W means ""up"" on the screen makes life so, so much easier. Gone is the hitching on the interface, now I can really cut loose!

Alongside this there's an angle to compensate for when aiming weapons, as denoted by the red and blue ""aiming"" angle markers, which help you adjust for aiming at things which are shorter than your vehicle or antigravs which might be at a horizontal level and thus need you to adjust accordingly. It's a learning curve, for controller inputs, I'd almost certainly want a ""Vertical auto-helper"" of some kind (and it does seem that there is now with the controller patch, but it's not a HUGE one, you'll have to do a lot of the work). It'd work on a steam controller, but not on an Xbox 360 controller. On the mouse? It's easy and intuitive, and you get used to it fast.

Once you've set your controls up you'll be piloting the mech in good order, and working through a neon saturated Blade Runner take on a city that frankly would rather you were not in the area. Your initial options are designed to ease you into the whole ""murder everything that's not you"" process, with good loadouts, plenty of armour and shield, and a healthy dollop of firepower available. As you generate funds and unlock more options, you'll be able to load your vehicles with laser weapons, gauss rifles, mortars, chainguns, and all kinds of good stuff, and you'll be able to go for lighter, more maneuverable frames, at the cost of armour.

In effect, you get to dictate how tough your run is, by choosing the mix of pilot, vehicle and weapons. This part is inspired, and I commend the developers for giving the players a really diverse and flexible toolset for deciding just how much stress they want to be under in a given run. Want to relax? Pick a heavy mech and a low difficulty pilot, get some big guns and blow the whole city up. Want to test your mad skillz? Pick a powered suit and see just how far you get.

[H1]Stellar sound and visual presentation combine to make for a gritty atmosphere[/H1]

The graphics are, for what is basically iso-pixel art, stunning. This is genuinely high presentation all the way through, and is reminiscent of titles like Crusader : No Remorse, and Syndicate, when 2D graphics enjoyed a rennaisance and people were creative with the resources they had available to them. The music is also a synth drenched call back to films like Blade Runner and genuinely adds to the atmosphere to the game, meaning the whole package is cohesive and the entire game from end to end has a real depth to it that really works.

[H1]The Developers *listened to their customers*[/H1]

Cardinal controls MAKE the game accessible to everyone regardless of skill level, suddenly this game has gone from being a game I could like but couldn't love due to the fact I was fighting on two fronts, because the controls would fail me due to my brain telling my hands to do something and not getting the right result, and fighting the enemies in the game itself. Now? Now there's nothing in my way except the enemies and it is *glorious*. I am immersed in this world and it feels -alive-, I don't think about what I have to press to get my mech into a certain place, I just do it. With the controls update, this game just went up in my esteem from a game I might play once a week to a game I'll play nightly. Now it's much easier to get your teeth into, I REALLY suggest you do as well.

The campaign is a series of challenge maps that can be easy if you pick the strongest loadout provided (out of 4), but the real test is clearing a map with all four. Freelance mode let's you try longer and longer runs with higher difficulty multipliers for bigger cash rewards and bragging rights.

There's difficulty, and a learning curve. Bright red text on the screen during the tutorials teach you the basics, the rest you have to discover (don't ram ammo depots, esp. in the Killdozer). Nine times out of ten when you die, you can work out why and what you did wrong. The one out of ten ""C'mon, that was bullsh*t!"" moment just makes you want to try harder.

There's lots of attention to detail and personal touches: the setting is surprisingly well realized, the flavour text is fun and one unit has fully modelled empty beer cans on the dashboard. It's true, you just have to squint to see them: http://i.imgur.com/oHmtl5C.png

While flawed, it's a highly enjoyable ""garbage day"" game when you can't be bothered thinking too much. Really a twin-stick shooter rather than a mech game, but the mechs feel authentically ""mechy"" enough that I still enjoyed the game a lot!

The gameplay is VERY satisfying, but I only discovered this only after I switched the graphics into a more performance-focussed setting. I'm not really sure why my modest-but-modern laptop was behaving this way with an isometric game, but hey-ho. The fantastic weapon sound effects and feedback feeds into this; it's hard to describe the gameplay in anything other than vague floaty terms like ""crisp"".

On the other hand, the 'campaign' (Which felt a bit like an extended tutorial to be honest) gives you a small selection of fixed loadouts and a mission to accomplish. I found it to be a bit short, although any longer and it'd probably overstay it's welcome. Only a couple of missions felt really distinct, like the one which starts you with no ammo, and you have to race to the end to pick some up. The rest of the missions sadly felt a bit samey, Futhermore, the challenge in these missions zig-zags drastically; I never really got stuck, but some of the earlier missions were rather tough, but the very last one was a cake walk. The factions you face in these missions clearly have subtle differences, but I never felt like the gameplay was telling me ""This is Faction X, this is Their Hat."" On the other hand, you could argue that this means the various enemy factions aren't gimmicky.

Freelancer mode is the real meat of the game. The only issue is that you have to accrue and spend limited winnings on equipment which has no description before you purchase it, so you either have to randomly buy bits and pieces and hope for something interesting, or hope you've used it the in campaign and know what it does. Most annoyingly, this post-release game (as of time of writing) still hasn't got all the weapon and vehicle descriptions in it yet.

So in summary, the gameplay is really good. The campaign is decent, but leaves you wanting more. That more can probably be found in Freelancer mode, but it doesn't tell you all you need to know in some cases, and is a bit grindy. It's good enough for me to comfortably recommend it, but I can't say ""BUY THIS NOW!"" until the weapon descriptions are finished, and maybe they add some DLC content, built to the high standard of the base game.",1465174715,1465174715,True,11,0,0.655202627182006836,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game somehow manages to be visceral while also making you play in a methodical, tactical manner. It's understated and yet bombastic at the same time.

Simply put: play pre-made campaign maps to acquire money, use that money to purchase pilots, vehicles (mech/tanks), weapons and semi-procedural missions then mix and match for huge replay value in the freelance mode. It's a super simple career-esque formula that feels like an arcade version of MechWarrior Mercenaries and I love it!
(NOTE: I say ""career mode"", but it really isn't that deep, don't expect a management game here).

Combat is satisfying and varied due to the wild loadout combinations you can create; fast, light mechs with heavy weapons, giant, slow walkers with enough ""dakka"" to put the greenskins to shame and any variation in between. I personally recommend the 'Fork' mech with dual 'disco' turrets (example [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycpGvL_hRQY] here[/url]).

The game is not easy, but at no point does it feel unfair. It can be difficult to get the hang of aiming at first, but all the projectile arc information really is right there in front of you, so it doesn't take long to figure out. As long as you don't rush in and try to take on swarms of enemies all at once you should be good. Just like MechWarrior Online, this is a form of cover shooter; sneak behind buildings and only engage when you've got the advantage. And speaking of buildings, everything is destructible... and I mean everything.

In conclusion, it's a simple isometric mech/tank action game with some light customisation, fully destructible environments and a great synthwave soundtrack. Recommended!",1465103933,1465104094,True,9,0,0.583439052104949951,0,False,True,False,False,,,

On retrouve tous les ingrédients qui faisaient fureur dans les années 90 avec l'essor de ce genre de jeu sur Amiga et Atari ST. Brigador est un jeu développé par Stellar Jockeys, une équipe de 4 qui a passé plus de 5 ans sur le jeu. Il est désormais temps de découvrir le jeu en version finale qui doit parvenir à faire le grand écart entre un gameplay façon années 90 à savoir intraitable mais juste et une réalisation plus moderne et une ambiance au poil.

Le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que Brigador est le résultat d'un groupe de passionnés qui sont parvenus à aller au bout de leurs idées et à nous proposer un jeu réussi, impitoyable au niveau de sa difficulté mais qui permet également au joueur de s'amuser le temps de parties courtes mais jamais répétitives. Brigador nous propose un mode histoire plutôt complet avec 21 missions qui peuvent être faites avec plusieurs mechas différents. La durée de vie est phénoménale pour peu que l'on souhaite tout faire. On hérite également d'un mode Freelance qui nous permet de choisir tous les éléments que l'on souhaite sans être limité par l'histoire.

On choisit donc son véhicule, son armement et sa compétence afin de réaliser les objectifs demandés par le scénario. On se retrouve souvent à devoir trouver plusieurs objectifs et à devoir les détruire pour rejoindre le checkpoint et ainsi avancer un peu plus loin. Il faudra alors se diriger dans un niveau cloisonné et faire preuve de réflexion quand on chemin à emprunter pour arriver aux objectifs. Certains méchas disposent de pouvoirs spéciaux qu'il faudra apprendre à exploiter afin de mieux gérer la difficulté du jeu. En effet, il y a mille et une façon d'exploser bêtement dans Brigador! On peut se faire tuer par les ennemis mais les explosions de tourelles et autres stations essence peuvent également nous être fatales.

Après 3 niveaux servant de tutoriel, on débarque sur la première véritable mission et tout s'éclaire! On commence à mieux comprendre ce que le jeu attend de nous et on commence également à mieux exploiter les avantages de notre mécha. On utilise au mieux la furtivité pour attaquer un gros tank par derrière et on se sert du terrain afin d'éviter les tirs adverses. Il ne faut surtout pas oublier que l'on peut réduire les dégâts on se couchant ce qui nous permet de passer certains passages chauds. En effet, si on se fait trop repérer, on déclenche une alarme générale qui va nous envoyer tous les ennemis du niveau d'un coup!

La réalisation de Brigador est excellente avec un côté rétro assumé et une ambiance au top grâce à la bande son parfaite pour ce genre de jeu. La maniabilité est très bonne même si il faudra pas mal de temps pour s'habituer aux déplacements. En effet, on contrôle son véhicule au clavier et à la souris avec des touches configurables. La souris nous permet de contrôler la partie haute du véhicule, les tirs et la compétence alors que le clavier nous permet de déplacer la partie basse de notre robot. Si tout ceci peut paraitre facile, il faut comprendre que l'on ne peut avancer le véhicule qu'en pressant la touche Z, les touches Q et D font pivoter l'axe du véhicule. Il faudra donc toujours avoir l'œil sur la partie basse de son véhicule pour voir dans quel sens on se dirige. La barre Espace permet de détruire le décor ce qui est pratique pour se frayer un chemin. Certains véhicules sont d'ailleurs plus difficiles à contrôler mais on s'y habitue assez rapidement mine de rien.

Plus on réussi de missions et plus on gagne de crédits, cet argent nous permettra de débloquer des missions, des pilotes, de l'équipement mais aussi des méchas. Ils pourront ainsi être utilisé dans le mode Freelance. Rien qu'avec ce mode de jeu, il y a des heures de fun et d'amusement à prévoir. Un gros mécha équipé de 2 tourelles laser? Pas de problème! Brigador est un excellent divertissement mais il nous oblige aussi à bien réfléchir sur son armement et sur la bonne façon d'appréhender les combats. Les munitions ne sont pas illimitées et on ne peut recharger qu'à certains moments et endroits. Certains ennemis sont plus difficiles que d'autres à détruire et il faudra bien utiliser les munitions optimales. Le camouflage sera votre meilleur ami afin d'éviter certains secteurs trop difficiles, il s'active avec le bouton du milieu de la souris et ne dure que quelques instants. La difficulté est très élevée mais elle reste raisonnable une fois que l'on arrive à bien comprendre les déplacements et à ne pas rentrer dans le tas.

Brigador est vraiment un très beau jeu doté d'un moteur custom et d'une possibilité de destruction infinie! Autre gros point fort du jeu, la musique! Que dire de cette bande son si ce n'est qu'elle mérite à elle seule l'achat et qu'elle apporte vraiment un énorme plus à l'ambiance et à la cohésion de l'univers. Dans peu de temps, on devrait voir débarquer un outil de création de carte qui promet là aussi des grands moments de solitude et de difficulté. Il n'y a pas grand chose à jeter dans Brigador!

Brigador est une excellente surprise pour moi! J'avais beaucoup aimé la version Early Access mais la version finale est d'un tout autre acabit. Le jeu est à la fois impitoyable mais aussi juste ce qui évite au maximum la frustration et qui nous pousse à toujours jouer plus et à essayer de nouvelles combinaisons de Méchas et d'équipement.

Let me know if you have questions before buying and I'll answer them here!

UPDATED FOLLOWING FULL RELEASE (updates marked w/ ""UPDATE""):

Brigador is one of about 3 games I've purchased in Early Access and the only one I felt strongly enough about to recommend.  I'm assuming you've watched the trailers and are familiar w/ the basics of the arcade-style shooter genre.

Gamplay: 

UPDATE: With the release of the full game, the quantity of vehicles and weapons available to the player in campaign and freeplay mode have increased greatly.  Whereas the EA was working w/ about a dozen vehicles and weapons, there are now 4 or 5 times as many.  This obviously makes for a much more replayable game; figuring out optimal builds for each vehicle and which vehicles suit your playstyle has become a much richer experience b/c of the increased variety. You can choose to play either through the game's 20-mission campaign which follows the story of liberating Solo Nobre as a mercenary, or play one-off missions in the game's freeplay mode.  Any currency gained from either mode carries over to the other and allows the player to purchase intel, vehicles, weapons, lore, and different pilots for use in freeplay. I think this mechanic works well as it doesn't lock the player in to playing strictly the campaign, everything in the game is accessible at all times, provided you've racked up enough currency from completing missions.    
EARLY ACCESS:I've been having a ton of fun w/ Brigador; it's relatively simple in gameplay, but w/ depth of difficulty and strategy that emerges the longer you play.  I was up and running w/in a few minutes of booting this game up for the first time, but even after 20 hours or so, I'm still learning about the nuances of each vehicle and weapon available in the game, as well as enemy behavior and countering tactics.  

Audio: 

UPDATE: Following the full release of the game, music and sound effects have been more fully integrated into the game. Updates include a greater quanitity of vehicle and weapons sounds, as well as the integration of the full OST into campaign maps.  I can't overstress how much the original music adds to the experience of this game; if you're into synthpop, this game is just a joy to run around in.  
EARLY ACCESS:The in-game audio pushes Brigador from something that I'd probably otherwise enjoy to a great gaming experience.  The music is a stand-out as contributing a great deal to the atmosphere and enjoyability of playing, but it's not alone.  The weapon and vehicle sound effects, automatic weapons in particular, are rich and obviously got a lot of love from the devs.  

Graphics/Misc:


UPDATE: Nothing much to add here over EA; I'll note that I haven't experienced any bugs or crashes.
EARLY ACCESS: I've seen a few pre-release builds since purchasing and all of them show a great deal of attention to detail from level design to animation to UX: I've gotten a great deal of satisfaction out of how smooth the game's animations are.  I get the feeling that the devs took a great deal of time in getting vehicle movement and weapon usage right; I've seen other games that use mechs and tanks end up w/ much clunkier vehicle movement, which can kill the fun quickly. Every vehicle in this game has a realistic sense of movement and presence in the game world, as do environmental destruction and weapon effects.  Graphics options are limited to resolution, V-Sync, and a few other options, but I found that these options are sufficient.
 
Devs:

Lastly, I always consider it a good sign when the developers of a game have a presence in the Steam forums and these guys are on top of that.  I've asked several questions and have always received quick answers from devs or knowledgable community members.  I always enjoy knowing that I can run to the forums w/ questions or comments and receive something other than a ""get gud"" response from the community.",1464670799,1465921709,True,3,0,0.444679528474807739,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After playing it for the 24 minutes I have on record, I definitly have to say that it is not worth the 20 bucks I paid so far, there just isnt enough to the game right now to warrent that much. However this IS still in early access, so it can change drastically yet, which I am exited for and is why I didn't mind paying full price for it right now.

The reason why this game isn't worth 20 bucks as it stands right now, is that there just isn't enough. I know I only played a little bit, but there really wasn't much to draw me in and make me want to play more. There is currently no story, it's not the funnest to drive around extremly slowly in an enviroment that really doesn't look that appealing, and the enemies are both not frequent enough to make such a slow speed enjoyable, and they are kind of annoying to try and shoot down. I can see what you are trying to do with the heigh of the shots you shoot, but it's really more of an annoying mechanic to work with than anything else with the way the game is right now.

The gameplay is just not satisfying right now, I'm not upgrading into anything to feel progression, noir do I really feel any kind of story going on, it's just play through the level and move to the next. A game needs to have more than what this one currently has to really draw people into it.

For now I am saying I would not recommend it, but I will keep checking this game out every update to see how things have changed and what was added to see if that changes at all.

But even with all of that, I doubt I'd have spent as much time in this game as I have - it is in Early Access after all and still lacks quite a bit of content. But thankfully this game is extremely easy to mod. I don't know anything about code, and I never modded any game before, yet in Brigador I was able to make an instagib mod, change all the weapons' attributes and make my own weapons, make enemies tougher, completely revamp the lighting, modify the movement behavior of all player vehicles and change the enemy spawnlists (and thus even get access to unimplemented content that was present in the gamefiles) - and most of those things can be done on-the-fly while in the game. On top of that there's a map editor as well. You could even make your own units, though for that you need experience in either 3D modelling or at least basic spritework - unless you're fine with recombining the existing leg and chassis parts which you can do pretty easily.

In short, pretty much every aspect of the game can be modified either in-game via a really handy and easy to use dev-console, or by basic text file editing in the gamefolder.

Captures the essence of mech-fighting nicely; but from the negative reviews I had concerns about janky controls.  The controls are fine.  WASD is like tank driving and not like a cursor control- i.e. there is a pointer on the ground that indicates relative 'forwards' direction.  Turret is very rapid look and slightly delayed aim based on turret speed.  Since this is early release here are my comments:

~ would like options on how ground/direction indicator is displayed; maybe bigger/color/brightness
~ light enemy AI should have a higher priority on individual survival; seem eager to sacrifice self to do damage to player
~ variable speed option; i think it would be fun to be able to play at 70% normal speed to accomodate how frantic you want the experience to be
~ maybe auto-reload at depot and only require active when scavenging

I'll start by saying I have very little negative things to say about Brigador. The visual aesthetic; a  beautiful mash-up between classic 90's PC mech/strategy games, and the 80's neon retro-wave which has been coming back in a big way. Playing this has made me wonder why this pairing hasn't been before, as when combined with the amazing retro-wave soundtrack it makes an incredible overall look, sound, and feel. The HUD also feels pulled straight out of those old games, presented in a minimalistic fashion that fits perfectly. 

Now the gameplay is what makes Brigador truly stand out. The isometric view coupled with WASD + mouse will likely be slightly disorienting at first to those first picking it up. An hour or two into the game, there are moments where was still tripping up. Keeping evasive while also keeping on target is very challenging-- at first. Always keeping yourself properly oriented is a challenge-- at first. 

Oh, and let's not forget about aiming and shooting. THAT was very hard to get the hang of. I'm still getting better at it, too, which is satisfying in the way that good, challenging games are. However, I DO believe that the ""aiming system"" can be improved. After the number of hours spent playing-- essentially the amount of time it took me to beat 'The Tears of the Ancestors' mission-- I'm still only 90% sure I'm going to hit a guy AFTER I take my time getting oriented and ranged in. The isomentric view makes some angles very awkward for aiming. 

The only suggestion I can think of is to make the path of the projectile more clear by showing the point of impact. I will often overshoot or undershoot distant targets (with things like a basic tank-style cannon) because while I know my direction is correct, the ""height"" is harder to guage. 

Also, that mission was damn hard. DAMN hard. My vast majority of my 4-5 hours played were trying to beat that mission. However, after finally beating it, I felt two things: a disappointment that I didn't get another story mission to beat myself over the head with, and an overwhelming sense of satisfaction that I managed to beat the stage by incorporating all aspects of the game's depth. 

I used stealth and evasion, shooting through objects such as trees and buildings to hit enemies that couldn't see me, to take on the overwhelming amount of enemies. It was incredibly satisfying to overcome the mission by playing smart. 

That being said, I was still a little bummed out to have not gotten another story mission, but this game is in Early Access for a reason, so I'm not knocking the game or devs for it. Of course more missions/content and balancing will be coming.


Here's a TL;DR to wrap it up. 

-The visuals and music are fucking incredible. 
-Gameplay is complicated and must be learned through practice. Lots of practice. 
-Guaging distance (not direction) when aiming your shots is the hardest part about the controls. I believe this can be remedied. 
-The game is HARD in a way serious players will really dig into. Not sure about casual players.
-Surprising amount of depth; makes for satisfying gameplay.",1453164830,1453164830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

A solid little title.

Probably best described as a good blend of SCHMUP and Strategy isometric shooter, Brigador is currently sitting in my 'Gem' folder - and it's only in Early Access.

Pumping, pulsing electronic soundtrack; neon lights from environment and gunfire; beautifully rendered sprite environment (which is fully destructable and with multiple stages of damage being detailled just as finely through their beautiful art style).  People have compared it to Syndicate although I never played.  It feels more like a Crusader mixed with Mech Commander to me.

Pilot one of several mechs/tanks/hovercraft with a selection of primary/secondary weapons and a special skill (stealth/assault modifier item) and murder your way through a city for the good of the people!

There are -currently- 4 'zones', of which the first three contain 4 levels.  The final zone being the 'Solo Nobre' of the trailers which has 12 levels within.  There is currently no save feature, so running an assault on Solo Nobre is quite the marathon (if you can make it in and out alive).  Enemies initially are light and sparse but quickly ramp up to heavy and thick in numbers as you progress, creating a tense and exhilerating environment to literally shake to the ground.

At this point in time, it still feels 'bare' in that there is no story, the pre-mission screens are sparse and look like under construction, certain assets appear to be missing, and it's really just 'the game' without bells or whistles at the moment.  

The game however plays and feels excellent and is still having things added to it.  

If you're a fan of shmups, isometric action/tactics (real time) or cut your teeth on Mechwarrior or Heavy Gear (or the like) as i did as a child, this is definitely something to either get, or watch the price on.",1451522453,1451618268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

 If you didn't Brigador is a great isometric tank/mech/antigrav piloting game where, at the moment,  you can only do runs on a smaller number of maps(more will be added) with two objectives: Kill enemy captains or destroy orbital cannons, both are available which to complete is up to you. There will be pilots and pilot centric missions added later with a shop system to buy weapons and such ingame. Devs plan to have a large number of vehicles and weapons added with a decent number ingame already.

Most common complaints ive seen deal with the tank controls, which take a bit of getting used to but once you do I think they are the best choice for this type of game. 

Now, as for what you can do with the game and some of the most fun things I see in it.
-Ambushes with smoke grenades
-Lobbing artillery barrages over walls to decimate an unwary group of enemies
-Dropping an EMP grenade in the middle of a group of antigrav tanks and going to town on them
-Squishing infantry with a tank
-Squishing tanks with a mech
-Plowing through walls in the tanks and mechs
-Piercing walls and subsequently my enemies with a powerful rail gun
-Bombing an orbital cannon with two shotgun cannons 
-Using active camo to hightail it before enemies arrive
-Driving an old chevy turned into a antigrav racer, turned into a hit-n-run vehicle armed with ridiculously large guns
-Finding out what parts of the destroyable terrain explode much more violently than others
-Learning those little guys with lasers do actually hurt 
-Frying those little guys with my laser
-Learning armor facing does in fact make a difference for tanks
-Running over innocents that look like they are all wearing yellow raincoats
-Running out of ammo and ramming an enemy tank to death from behind
-HATE motorcycles
-Stray projectile blows up an ammo depot I desperately needed
-Blows up an ammo depot I was about to use by driving into it
-Chain reaction of exploding buildings caused by myself or anyone else
-Realize antigrav tanks can strafe
-Strafe into explosives by accident while dodging enemy fire

It's important to note that the game is in early access, the way the term was likely intended to be used. The developers are actively following a development roadmap that sees them churning out maps and vehicles as they continue to build the game around the existing skeleton you can play here. Yes, the current experience is rough if you are expecting a paid beta experience: the menus are barebones, most of the sound effects are missing, there's a lot of functionality on the cards such as an unlock system and selectable pilots that we won't see for a while. That's okay, because it means the majority of work has gone into fine-tuning the game's systems to create an enjoyable and frentic experience best likened to a curious mix of [i]Syndicate Wars[/i], [i]Desert Strike[/i], [i]Future Cop: LAPD[/i] and the [i]Mechwarrior[/i] titles on the Super Famicom which featured similarly isometric views and wanton destruction.

Brigador's difficulty is, once you're familiar with the simple controls and the flow of the game, somewhat self-imposed. You can identify pretty quickly which of the game's vehicles (tanks, mechs and antigravs) gels with your playstyle the most and then which weapons you find the most useful on top of that. Whether you go with the same pair of big, kick-ass cannons in every run or try to mix it up a little is up to you, and the vehicle mounts available. The longer you stick around, and the more maps you complete, the more difficult the enemies you'll find coming at you. If you're low on shields and ammo and aren't feeling like you can weather another big fight, the option is always there to hit up the spaceport as your next map and fight your way to an escape.

The soundtrack, by New Retro Wave artist Makeup and Vanity Set, is pretty damn good. It's not just playing at the 80's throwback fad half-heartedly, it's lurid and drenched in neon with big, dramatic synth. The only downside is the song selection is another aspect under development: the game just picks from a playlist right now and runs through it. What's there is great, though, and helps make up for the lack of sound effects currently implemented.

The game is by no means perfect, but it's short and sweet and to the point. For something so heavily under development, what's playable is incredibly crisp and very enjoyable. Whenever you die, it usually feels like it was something you did wrong rather than getting caught out by imbalanced mechanics or shitty bugs. The onus is on Stellar Jockeys to keep the pace of development up, because the quicker this game's skeleton is built on, the quicker the attention is going to snap to it. If you're scared off by the very minimal trappings of a game under construction then you probably don't want to buy Brigador just yet. On the other hand, if you like the idea of tossing some change to a handful of guys making a very earnest and solid shooter with a bumping soundtrack, go for it.

This game, 'Brigador', brings you to series of vehicular combat in futuristic urban environment.
You are a mercenary pilot of mechs, tanks or anti-grav crafts, and you just engage in subversive activities on the city of a colonized planet.
Being more specific, Objective is eliminating a certain number of garrison, terminating all captain units, or destroying all orbital guns in the sector.
After that, you will escape with your life and reward by getting to a sector gate or a evac-spaceship.

[b]The combat mechanics are simple but deep, and they are quite skill-based. [/b]
[h1][Movement and Shooting][/h1]
Turret rotation and legs operation are separated (like 'Mechwarrior' or 'WoT'). 
Operating turret by mouse, steering by [W][A][S][D] keys.

When you drive anti-grav assault guns, chassis rotation is operated by lateral mouse movement, and [A][D] keys are used for strafe exceptionally.

Maneuverability varies by vehicle spec.. 
The heavier or the more robust the machine is, the lower maneuverability it has.

The player vehicles carry 2 guns and 1 special equipment (smoke/EMP/optical camouflage) . 
Mouse Button 1 for firing gun 1, Mouse Button 2 for firing gun 2, and Mouse middle button (wheel click) for activating equipment. 
Guns and equipment have various ballistic specification.

aiming might be felt hard cause inertia works slightly, but I like this realism.

[h1][Resource management][/h1]
You have to manage health, shield, ammo, and cooling/reloading time.
Health is not regenerative during a contract(series of missions), but shield energy can be refilled by enemy drops. 
Ammo also can be recharged by enemy drops and ammo stations located in the sector. 
Guns and equipment have reload/cooling time. take care of it.

[h1][Damage variety][/h1]
Damage dealt varies by the status of caution (detected by foe or undetected). 
Also it varies by hit direction. 100% for front, 140% for side, and 200% for rear.
If you sneak up behind the enemy, you can knock it down easily.

[h1][Destroyable environment][/h1]
You can make your path and line of fire by smashing shacks, houses, walls, barricades, plants, and etc.

[h1][Explosive objects][/h1]
You will see some explosive objects in the sector, e.g. gaspipes and ammo stations. You can utilize them as powerful weapons. In some cases, you may  suddenly kill yourself by ramming into those explosives  as well.


This game is simple but still offers a many choice of tactics.
It may rely on chassis spec, weapons, equipment, resources and situation(enemy position/environment).

Brigador is an isometric vehicular shooter with fantastic production values and excellent look and feel.  The devs have focused early resources on the core gameplay, which is really quite good.

That gameplay features a modest number of player vehicles which fall into three categories: Mechs, Tanks and Anti-gravs.  Mechs have high acceleration and modest speed, but have a powerful stomp attack that is devastating to grounded enemies and the environment.  Tanks can boost for short periods to plow through the same at high speed (although the 'Dragon' actually slows down, it pretty much obliterates anything it touches).  Anti-gravs are unique in that they turn their entire chassis to aim, but they can move in any direction and can float over short obstacles.  They also slam the ground, but typically deal substantially less damage than the mech or tank equivelant.

The weapons available have varying statistics of shield damage, hull damage, environment damage, penetration and rate of fire.  At this point, ammo doesn't appear to be used to balance weapons, but is simply commensurate with the rate of fire.  Each vehicle can mount two weapons.  Usually these are weapons of different size categories, but some vehicles have two of the same mount.  The weapon balance is currently spotty, due to the fact that the unlock system has not yet been implemented and we're likely several balance passes away from 1.0 as it is.  Some weapons are fantastically effective, like the tank cannon (can't remember its actual name), while others are less than spectacular (the 8mm burst-fire, for example).

Brigador features a host of mechanics that really bring the visceral combat to life.  The AI is excellent in that it relies on line of sight, as well as the sound of weapon fire to locate the player.  The enemies start off basically flat-footed, many with their shields unpowered.  If you get the drop on them, you can take down quite a few hit-and-run style.  The moment you join battle though, nearby enemies will start closing in to investigate.  If you hide at this point, it's quite doable to avoid contact or better yet, lead your enemies into a killzone of your choosing.  Attacking enemies from behind is literally twice as effective as shooting their fronts, so it's often better to hit them on your terms than to simply charge into the middle of them.  You can use the environment to your advantage by setting off devastating chain reactions from explosive structures or by attacking the enemy through the very obstacles blocking them from returning fire.  Even the height of individual units is important, with the 'tower-like' enemies being able to spot and return fire over low-obstacles, whilst the tanks and infantry are stuck moving to get a shot.

As other reviewers have said, the price point is high for the content the game currently has, but let's be frank; This is Steam.  The dev needs to set their price point high if the game is going to display value to potential backers, and so that it can still be an equitable return when the inevitable Steam sales roll through.  It also means that they can get additional resources early on and not live in squalor hoping their game will make it big when it leaves early access, which we all know is /far/ from a guarantee; It's a fool's gamble.  For what it's worth, the game in its current state easily convinces me that the dev can fulfill their remaining content goals within the six months they've given themselves.

Brigador is a isometric tank shooter with a few different play styles. You can play brigador sneaky deaky like and cloak or if your the Arnold type rush in guns blazing.

Currently there are 9 vehicles to pilot ranging from hover tanks, to mechs, to something that looks straight out of a red necks fantasy... yep an el camino with a giant monster cannon.

Your goal in one of these vehicles is to either sneak or shoot your way into various locations and destroy the glorious leaders cannons, generals, or just massacre a percentage of his army.

The controls are a bit difficult at first to get used to as you must handle your turret, your legs/tank (which rotate separately) while maintaining aim with your guns and their ranges. Meaning 3 things at once which I am rather poor at.

If this hectic gameplay isnt your style there are hover tanks you can use that have locked turrets. Keep in mind the developers have promised 40+ new vehicles coming before Brigador leaves steam early access.

That being said after a few hours with the game the controls get simpler. I found the sniping / sneaking gameplay to be my forte as it let me move slowly and set things up as opposed to the large hectic fights where I ended up slamming into the walls screaming at my keyboard.

Overall I think Brigador is a solid game for being at the early stages of development. I do think the price point is a bit high but once the game is finished it will definitely be worth that cost.

My only real complaint with the game was the controls and thats more my fault at being an old man than the fault of the game.

If you liked classic westwood C&C games environments, attention to detail and music, Brigador will likely give you nostalgia. If you simply like quick and easy to play action games like nuclear throne or spelunky, Brigador is going to appeal to the same style of fun.

In a way the game is incredibly simple, you can just run in and shoot things until you get to the end, but it's so well made that the simplicity only really helps the game. You pick a vehicle, two guns and a special weapon (I recommend smoke grenades with the tauro mech) and need to complete one of three objectives per area, all of which involve blowing things up. Enemy AI allows for you to either stealth your way in or out, maneuver your way around at high speeds dodging shots, or simply bust your way through walls crushing anything in your way. 

Despite all this, the game is tough: you cannot regain health at all except by killing enemies to regain your shields, so avoiding damage by killing fast or playing smart is essential if you want to get to the end and off of the planet. Ammo management is also an issue, as you need to either harvest it from your enemies without blowing it up first or regain it from depots that correspond to your ammo type, which are often surrounded by enemies. Keep in mind that if you don't need the ammo type, you can just use the depot as an explosive to still save you some shots. An added layer of difficulty comes from optionally playing as lighter, more agile mechs that definitely require finesse to control compared to other options such a pillar of scrap on treads. You can expect any vehicle to reward you if you use it right however.

As a game Brigador is definitely fun, as a mech game Brigador plain rules. The perspective, graphics, explosions, destructible environment and hordes of enemies you take down really make it feel like you're a piece of heavy weaponry and not just a reskinned human. If you like mechs, buy this game.",1445724407,1445724446,True,15,2,0.622668623924255371,0,False,False,True,False,,,

At the time of this review, the game is still incomplete but shows a lot of promise in it's well designed gameplay.

Brigador is a challenging game to say the least. A player's first inclination is to shoot everything in sight, but you'll quickly learn that strategy will get you killed pretty fast. Your ammo is limited, your HP don't regenerate, and the game features a perma-death system. With out careful planning and strategic thinking, you'll become scrap metal in an instant. The game has a high learning curve, and an equally high skill ceiling. The game makes no concession to casual players.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hf5arkwBc8&ab_channel=aldershot8008
The goal of the game is to enter an enemy territory, shoot out 3 of their cannons, and then get the hell out of there. It sounds simpler than it actually is. In any given map, there will be tons of enemies swarming to blow you up if you're not careful, as well as environmental hazards. Gas pipes, oil stations, and other things can easily blow up in your face ending your run. Then there are mud, tracks, and sand that will slow you down. Though there are hazards, the environment is completely destructible, allowing you to make your own path to the goals, avoiding the dangerous main roads. 

Before even starting your mission, you'll be able to pick your vehicle, weapons, and special abilities. there are 6 different vehicles that are variations of 3 different types, tank, mech, and hover. Tanks have good Armour and speed, while mechs can use a powerful stomp, and hovers can strife and are the quickest, but they're balanced with low armour and HP. They all have their own unique characteristics and stats, and the same can be said about the weapons and specials as well. The game offers a fair degree of customization and experimentation, allowing the player to tailor their ship to their play style.

Brigador also features detailed but visually clear sprites in an isometric environment. The aesthetics have a classic PC look to it, and it's one of my favorite elements of the game. The art is interesting, full of nuance, and does a good job at communicating it's overall theme and atmosphere of a dystopian future. The sound design is also quite pleasing, with an appropriately futuristic OST and sound effects that has impact. However, since the game is in early access, some sound effects aren't implemented and is distracting from what is an otherwise polished presentation.

There's a lot of stuff to like about the game, it's presentation, it's skill oriented gameplay, and the destructible environments, however in it's current state, the game does feel incomplete. Currently, there is only one mode to play, endless mode, nothing to unlock, no stat tracking, and no story mode. So basically, the game is bare bones feeling very very beta. Of course it's in early access and these things are to be expected, but it is something worth mentioning for any one expecting a complete game. Bragador does not feel complete. There is a lot of room to grow and I am excited to see where it goes. One feature I really would like to see added is some kind of multiplayer. But until the game is further updated / released, it doesn't give much incentive for the player to keep playing, other than it's core gameplay, and maybe experimenting with different combinations of weapons and ships. 

Overall, Brigador is a very promising game, that in my opinion, has the potential to be a cult favorite. All the game need to do now is to fill itself out a little. Give the player a reason to come back regularly. We'll see how it'll turn out once it's a full release, but so far, so good.

Pros:
- Great classical looking visuals
- Challenging and rewarding gameplay
- Destructible environments
- customization

Cons:
- Missing sound assests
- limited game modes
- Feels incomplete

Good, new ways to control the mecha, much better.


Before:
The mechs are too hard to contral by keyboard, I don't know why it have to go this way. Hope in next vision the WASD will all be used for moving.

update:
like the designer insist the way about control, i insist the negative review the same way. the designer explained this is the best way he thought the way to control this game, and he also mentioned that users usually spend 1-2 hour to get used to the control way. 

As my opinion, the absolute control is only a option for possible choice, of course there will a better control way than the one right now, and maybe its not the absolute control way. I think not matter the absolute control will in this game or not, players will always happy to see more thinking, more design, more possibility in the game, maybe some goodwill design to help users based on the control way right now? making players feel more comfortable will always be right. even like dark soul, game famous because tough, in dark soul 2 there still a lot of change to help the players get more comfortable for the game. (like Locking enemy function, just for pc, as my memory :( )

so like I say before, u dont satisfied with negative review, and u don't satisfied to make any change either. I dont think its so simple question about my refund (im not asking and i didnt ask for refund), if the designer is really thinking about the market things, really dislike the negative followed by the negative reviews, I think it's the time to take care of this problem seriously. i hope next time, when we talking in a not bad Atmosphere, the helpless things like ""I can't spend any more time to talk with u"" ""I dont believe u"" ""u just spend 48 mins on this game, I spend 3 years"",these things seems not need to appear anymore.

Slightly biased towards the devs of this game, but only because I've watched them polish this game for quite a while. What it started from, the assets they hand crafted themselves (didn't borrow or steal), the fact they got a great musician that actually fit their game to work with the sound track and so forth sell me a game. I think of it as investing in someone's idea and dream as much as buying a product. They always chatted me up and answered my questions, so I  pre-ordered this long before Steam was even a reality. I'd probably give them a positive review even if the game were a steaming heap.... which it's NOT.

[b]Controls:[/b]

While this game can be a frantic iso-mecha-tric shooter, the controls are very much akin to tanks and mecha. Which means A and D will swivel the torso, W and S and will move front to back,  while mouse actually moves the aim. This takes quite a bit of getting used to, but tip is to look at the spotlights that the vehicle shines on the ground. One will be for the body/movement and one will be for aiming. The problem as it stands now is they can be harder to distinguish, become blocked by terrain/obsticles and generally get disorienting. I wouldn't have the game control any other way, however. It's true to the idea behind the vehicles and its something a bit fresher feeling over the generic point/click/move. There is a skill curve that makes sense and it's not just throwing square wheels on a car to make it harder to drive. This game will be something you will get better at playing as you play it. If you want a game you can sit down and be great at and win immediatly, then consider something else.

Tip: I'd recommend starting with the tank as the graphic serves a much better indication as to how to control it.

[b]Tactics:[/b]

The control set actually lends itself to a slightly slower gameplay that requries a bit of tactical movement on the players behalf. This isn't a game where you will endlessly kill mindless enemies. Your ammo is quite limited, though can sometimes be refilled by random towers or rare drops. Position matters where you shoot the enemy. Charging things without considering that you are just wasting ammo by shooting them from the front is bad form. You do more damage from the side or the back, so dodging and timing shots can be much more benefical over going pure John Rambo. There are also ""Special"" weapons. Smoke bombs which obstruct enemy view so it can help escape and positioning. Camo for the sneaky type and EMP grenades that I just rarely use.

Tip: To save ammo, use your melee attack on smaller enemies like footmen and in desperation against light craft. Stealth can combine with this for fun results.

[b] World Design [/b]

Isometric was just a perfect choice. It's very reminiscent of the 16/32 bit era of ""Strike"" games which pleases me greatly. Everything can be destroyed and you can carve a path through the level with your machine. Each weapon can affect the enviroment differently and of course there's explosive structures that can be used tactically. 

Tip: Blow everything up. It's cathartic.

[b]Soundtrack:[/b]

As a huge fan of synthwave/cyberpunk music, I was already a fan of Makeup and Vanity Set. His soundtrack for this game just helps a great deal setting the atmosphere. It's always nice to see a game seek someone that works better than just getting someone to fill in because their cousin can make beats. The soundtrack is very much part of the game. It's not just an afterthought asset at the bottom of the budget. Devs take note!

[b]Content:[/b]

As far as content, there is much much more to be added. I'll update this review accordingly to reflect this. Right now you can do basic runs and it's generally a sandbox with everything unlocked. You have complete mission freedom. You can kill a set number of enemies, find the commanders and kill them all or take out a few of the orbital cannons and advance to the next. In the future there will be unlocks and money as well as many more missions and tilesets. Also coming will be controller support, which may be a better alternative for the controls for some.

[b]Verdict:[/b]

A very thought-out design from top to bottom. The dev/brother team knew what they wanted to make and executed in a masterclass fashion. They have built an amazingly solid housing for their game. Now, the rest is just moving some more content into it and making the price tag more tempting.  The price doesn't bother me in the least. In a world of cheap sales, that only bring disposable titles or F2P games that are more timetraps than video games, I'd always pay premium for something like this. 20$ is hardly ""premium"" pricing though. I would have paid half that for the soundtrack alone.  This is a game I can revisit because after all it's actually a video game. Not storybook on rails or a grindfest because grinding because modern video games.

The controls are tight and responsive, although they may take a bit of getting used to. Enemies are diverse in both attributes and behavior, and the environments are dense and interesting. I really respect the devs for choosing to not color every explosive element red, although I cursed their names the first time i discovered this fact.

The graphics are excellent. I don't know what voodoo magic allows such accurate-looking lighting effects in a 2d game, but it is strong, and arcane. You really have to see it in motion to appreciate it. The overall visual density is high, and honestly pretty busy, but it gets much easier to read the action after a few games.

The game presents a stiff challenge, but not an unfair one. At first you'll find yourself overwhelmed by all the threats coming at you from every direction, but soon you'll learn how to use the environment to your advantage and manage the flow of battle. Smoke is your friend!

There are six vehicles to choose from in the current build (there have been more in pre-release builds and certainly will be again) and many different weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. This level of choice is one of the game's greatest strengths, but may also be the biggest stumbling block for new players, since it's easy to choose a loadout that doesn't have good synergy, and get completely owned.

Pro tip: try the loyalist mech ""Touro"" with the cannon ""Abbot"", machine gun ""Mae Dois"", and smoke launcher. It's a very powerful combo. But definitely don't stick to it! Try all kinds of things and have a great old time.

I did a little bit of research and discovered the upcoming game, being developed a group of four guys under the name ‘Stellar Jockeys‘, striven to be a isometric hybrid of ‘Syndicate‘ and ‘Mechwarrior‘. After reading that I was determined to jump into Brigador without any further knowledge of the game and see how much fun I had, and let me tell you; I had a ton of fun.

Damn is Brigador a beautiful game. The game is set in the bright and bustling isometric cityscape of Solo Nobre. At launch there are nine very detailed levels/districts to Solo Nobre, each with their own unique but similar layout. At the beginning of each mission (dubbed contract’s in the game), you choose from one of three categories: tanks, mechs, and anti-gravity vehicles. The tanks are typically defensive, the mechs primarily offensive, and the anti-gravity vehicles are fast. Each mech has it’s own weapons and play style as well as toughness when taking damage.

From here you’re thrown into the contract you selected and begin dishing out massive destruction to anything and everything in the district. The entire map is fully destructible, including attacking enemy vehicles, all of the buildings and enemy defenses, and even the civilians attempting to flee the city from your carnage. There are quite a few unique weapons in Brigador, all of which take some getting used to. You move using the W-A-S-D and a mouse, but it’s not as simple as it sounds. The movement is similar to Resident Evil in that you use the A and D keys to rotate your vehicle in places, W to move forward, and S to move backwards. You have a red and a blue line that project from your vehicle in different arcs and help show you where your weapons will be fired. Using this system you can aim high, low, and even around buildings to take out aerial or ground enemies at command.

Brigador is tough. On top of the intricate(but fair)movement system, the enemies themselves are quite challenging. By design, there is no saving or restarting, so you must play through the district’s clearing out enemies and completing the objectives of your contract to move forward. While keeping track of your ammunition is certainly important, there are ammo stations scattered across each map, and defeating some enemies will result in them dropping ammo packs to replenish your ammo. That being said, successfully completing a level carries over your current ammunition counts and health, meaning to ‘beat’ the game you would have to complete each district in one sitting and straight playthrough.

If you’re a fan of isometric ‘top down’ shooter type games, Brigador is definitely for you. As I mentioned before, it’s an extremely beautiful game, and a ton of fun. Destroying the city of Solo Nobre while wiping out your enemies and completing your contracts does require a bit of strategic shooting, but is enjoyable the whole way. While the game itself was a bit too difficult for me to successfully clear all districts in one sitting, I feel as though that’s necessary with a game like Brigador. The only thing I’d ask for is perhaps more of a story or campaign rather than just “Complete Objectives in all Districts’, but after playing through all of them there is definitely the feeling of some repetition.

Brigador enters early access on October 20th at the price of $20 on Steam and Humble and plans to add more content throughout the early access stage.

This review score is based on its Early Access launch. We may or may not do another review for this game once it enters the full retail launch phase.

The best thing about Brigador is the feeling of just blowing the hell out of tons of stuff. I don't know, maybe I'm just a terrible perosn, but it sure is fun to chase down scrambling civilians and run them over in my giant mech.

Brigador's a good mech game, which seems to be a rare commodity these days. It's an isometric shooter with systems bigger and more complex than 'put your mouse on the bad guy robot and press the button,' the biggest of which is the aiming system, since it's three-dimensional. You can overshoot or fall short of targets, and the camera works in conjunction with this. Unlike another recent top-down shooter with a banging synth soundtrack, the shifting camera won't give you motion sickness, and you won't get oneshot from offscreen. Differing armor values for front, sides, and rear (for enemies AND for players) means that flanking isn't just viable, it's vital, and different acceleration, handling, and speed while traveling in different directions in different vehicles means that even two vehicles of the same class feel and play differently. 

Your tower tank can plow through enemy and environment alike while absorbing blow after blow; your mech can peek and retreat around corners, fire over low walls or crouch to hide behind them, and stomp anything that dares get close; your main battle tank is fast and maneuverable with a low profile and a speed boost for hit-and-run attacks; and your antigrav can weave in and out of buildings, strafe targets without exposing vulnerable side armor, or belly flop on enemies who make the mistake of letting you get close. 

I've been playtesting the game since early alpha builds and the progress it's made is astounding. The game is gorgeous and never stops being fun to play. 60 hours later I still constantly get the itch to boot it up and throw together a new build to see how far I can get with it. There's really no game on the market that plays quite like it. This game is good and you should buy it.
