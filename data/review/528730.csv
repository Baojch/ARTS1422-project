Every level in the game is basically the same, just changed with different textures and different enemies each time, with a unique boss at the end of each level.

In each level, you have to collect a certain amount of keys around the “crypt” to unlock a gate to the final boss room.

If you are wondering if the keys are hard to spot, they are not. The keys can literally be found in the middle of almost every room you enter.

The enemy AI is hilariously terrible, making the enemies super fun to mess with in certain levels. I will not spoil it, but you can beat this game with very easy exploits.

That is the whole game summed up into a small paragraph. It is not very complex.

TLDR: If you are looking for a cheap and stupid dungeon crawler, a game to farm easy achievements, or a game to mindlessly play while listening to podcasts, this game is for you.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

To the point where I am not sure whether this is an asset flip or not.  It has all the hallmarks of an asset flip... mismatched assets combined with what looks like one of several Unity based procgen dungeon crawler templates (there's a bunch of free/cheap dungeon crawler asset packs available for Unity that would be trivial for someone to turn into an asset flip). 

If the developer wasn't known for making other, more genuine (if equally badly made games) I would have made a more rigid judgement on this, but it will have to be up to you, the gamers, to decide here.  All I can say for sure is that this has all the same qualities that you expect from lazy asset flips... mismatched assets, godawfully bad, unpolished gameplay, and as much depth as a tech demo.  There's no real game here for gamers, even if this isn't an asset flip. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game assets are far from bleeding edge, with lowish polygon counts and somewhat low resolution textures, making this look like it's at least 10 years old.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks poor in comparison to more professionally produced games as a result of their decisions.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

The game features no proper level design or game/story flow/plot, as they opted to try to use samey repetitive procgen algorithms as a substitute for adding such content to the game, to avoid doing the important job of level/map design.  As a result, the game doesn't actually have any content worth mentioning, just endless, boring, repetitive, soulless algorithmically generated sameyness.  Developers must learn that procedural generation is not an acceptable substitute for content.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  ""Crypt of the Serpent King"" has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for finishing the first basic ""tutorial"" level, trivial to achieve, but less than 8 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 8 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who didn't bother engaging with this game?  Trading cards.  People will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.

That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

""Crypt of the Serpent King"" is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

[b]Note:[/b] Due to the very poor quality of the game, all the comedians came out of the woodwork.

My wife has told me that she loves me more because of my new gained stamina, but she does not know the true nature of it.

[olist]
    [*]The visuals aren't super great
    [*]The jumping is janky
    [*]The game seems super difficult at first when you don't know how to play
[/olist]
But if you learn the strategies and how to play in a way that is less difficult for yourself, then this game actually has the potential to be quite fun.

This game is only fun for a short period of time, however. This is because the game boils down to pretty much spamming the same strategies, and going from same-looking hallway and room to same-looking hallway and room, to collect the same keys over and over. Luckily the game is pretty short, and the game should last you long enough to justify the asking price.

The strong suite of these devs would definitely have to be the atmospheric sounds and soundtrack. The battle music is average at best, but the rest of the atmospheric sounds and soundtrack are super great. Generally all being super spooky and enchanting.

Overall, I think this game would be best for achievement hunters and speedrunners. Note that the achievements don't stack for difficulties, so you will need to do 3 separate playthroughs.

Some tips if anyone wants to have an easier time with the game:
[spoiler] Enemies can be avoided entirely. If you don't want to fight them, just run past them. If you keep moving, they won't be able to hit you. The XP they give isn't really important if this is what you're doing. [/spoiler]
[spoiler] Bosses can be beaten by just circling them to the left and attacking them directly after they attempt to attack you. Doing this will ensure you never get hit. For the boss that does 2 swings in a row, just attack after their second swing. [/spoiler]
[spoiler] If skipping enemies, be careful not to let any into the boss room, or things become infinitely harder. You can lose enemies by bringing them to a room where a key is/was, and as the enemies are following you, just jump to the key section, and jump off on the opposite side from where the enemies were following you from.

Ich habe noch nicht viel Zeit drin verbracht aber, für 51 cent im Angebot kann man sich nicht beschweren.
Preis Leistung ist Top bei dem Angebot.
Es ist immer ein kleiner Grusel-Faktor dabei, das das Spiele Erlebnis  Beinfusst. Im großen und ganzen finde ich haben sich 51 cent gelohnt.Kann es für den Preis nur Weiter Empfehlen.

-Noch bissel was zum Spiel:

Man muss pro Level immer den Boss töten. Dafür braucht man Schlüssel, diese findet man im Level.
Um sich zu Heilen kann man Kisten öffnen im Level (diese verbrauchen keine keys) und Essen oder Gold finden.
Mit Essen kann man sich Heilen. Mit dem Gold kann man wen man das Level zu Ende gespielt hat, sich fürs nächste Level bessere Waffen kaufen.
Es gibt 3 Schwirkeits Moduse: Classic, Normal,Experte.
Für Experste muss man den Normalen Modus durchgespielt haben.
Im Classic Modus findet man Viel Essen/Gold und ""verdient"" auch gut xp.
Im Normalen Modus(wen ich das richtig verstanden habe) ist das recht ausgeglichen.

-Resultat:

Das Spielist kein Brecher bekommt für den Preis aber eine 7/10.
Ein Multiplayer-Modus hätte Potenzial um mit Freunden die Level zu bestreiten.

I would rate this game positively if only it would be a little bigger and less repetitive. 
This is a very simple game: you have 7 levels, in each level you have 1 type of enemies. So all in all 7 types of enemies + bosses. 
There are treasure chest, containing money for better weapons, food for health or arrows. 
In order to beat each level you have to find all the keys to unlock the boss arena. 
So what's the problem? I just described it. The lack of anything else. The repetition of doing the same thing over and over again. Also, there is only 1 trick in order to beat enemies = circle strafing. That's the only way of not getting hit. All other ways do not work. 
There are only 7 levels on easy, medium and hard for achievement hunters. 
With a little more content it would be a solid game but at current state it's also bugged ( example 1: from time to time the char drops randomly through the floor and can't continue, example 2: all the keys are put on altars, which are always surrounded by lava or spike traps. If you don't jump correctly the char dies and you have to start the level all over again. The problem is, there is only 1 way to jump correctly = to catch corners, all other ways are bugged and the char falls and game over ), so in all honesty I will leave a negative review.",1649867770,1649867770,False,1,0,0.488755643367767334,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am quite surprised of the immediate difference of the NEXT-GEN qualities in this game, as switching from PS4 to my PC, i was able to unlock RTX lighting, and holy shit, the sweet solid 60 fps ties the experience all together.   

All in all, if i could, i would buy this game again on this account.

1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

3And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

6And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

9And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.

11Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 12The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

14And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

20And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

24And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

26Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

27So God created mankind in his own image,

in the image of God he created them;

male and female he created them.

28God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

29Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

I'm glad that the video game is short as I beat it in 104 minutes, but the fact that it took that long to beat this game is abysmal. The graphics are so low-poly that I feel like I was playing a game from the PS1 era.

I will say that the hit detect is horrible because I'm never sure if I got close enough to hit the enemies.

Once I figure out how to play, the game gets super repetitive to get through that I'm just wanting to get to the end. It's gotten pretty easy to get through, but once it got to the last level, that's when it got a difficult jump for no reason. Even when I'm at the highest level with the strongest weapons, I still feel like I'm at the same level as the first level from where I started. The bosses are generic to get through and are pretty easy to beat, and the last boss was a pitiful looking final boss where I was trying my damndest to beat this Godforsaken game. Once I beat the game, the end credits are so lazily done that I felt like I accomplished nothing from playing the game.

It's brutal, precise and unforgiving...
The roguelike elements are not that much obvious or a focus.
The game saves progression only upon completing a level.
When you die, your experience and gold are not retained.
Speaking of the levels: There are 7 levels to complete on three different difficulties.
Each dificulty is significantly unforgiving, enemies will be really stronger, more resillient... Experience, gold, life and ammo pickups will be way more scarce.
It may seem short but those difficulty will greatly increase the time you'll need to complete the game (Not taking in account card drops).
However, once you get used to to enemies patterns it'll get easier as long as you keep focused.
The goal is simple : you need keys to open boss room and go forward once you've dealt with it. So on and so forth... On your way you can kill enemies, loot gold, arrows an food to restore life.
In terms of graphics, it's really good. There's this tense atmosphere and oldschool vibe...

One thing to remember is that it's not a AAA game by a big studio... Nice work.
Last thing, i noticed rare glitches when playing on PC but nothing alarming (got none on PS4).

I originally saw the comedic goblin character and decided I would like to combat the green fella. So I purchased this game and BOY HOWDY did I underestimate what I was getting into. 
This level of the game has your character (who I shall refer to as Grub for the remainder of this review) wandering a labyrinth full of rat-kin. And when you first meet these things. OMG you are not prepared. They swing quickly at you with their pics and on your first few attempts; you will perish, and you will suffer. For you see this game is difficult, as Grub will quickly die to just about anything that tries to touch him so I must say before you read any further that this game is NOT for the faint of heart. 
Now that the babies are gone I can get to some of my gripes with this gift of a game. The level design is pretty limited. Mostly the same traps that surround the keys needed to progress (with the exception of level 2)  and enemies that don't vary much other than appearance. Now not to say these characters don't like frightening as all heck, but it is a shame that most enemies attack with the basic melee moves (the spiders shooting webs or poison or something would be FREAKING SWEET) 
Now onto some golden nuggets of gameplay that I found to be delectable. The stats are pretty cool and allow for some different approaches to each run of the game. Now I found just maxing agility to be the best option (makes you run like Sonic on freaking meth) because I could run circles around enemies while I slapped them with my melee weapon or blasted the bosses with my ranged weapon when I unlocked it. That doesn't mean that there's only one way to play as upon further research I found that I have quite the hot take, so try this game for yourself to see what kind of hero you become. And i'm sure that it will be a magical adventure : )

[h1]The Graphics[/h1]
It is a modern Mona Lisa. The usage of the trial version of Unity is such a brave decision. No truly sane man would do such a risky task, but the people at Rendercore Games are neither human beings or sane, for the amount of detail are beyond our mortal realm, the compression is nonexistent, and yet i can run a solid 60 frames on Ultra High (the framerate is limited, so i would assume i could go in the hundreds), with my 6 year old laptop.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The chests that are loosely scattered in the barren walls make for an abandoned feeling across all the 8 levels, which is a great atmosphere where skeletons, goblins, fire monsters, and other [spoiler]stock unity assets[/spoiler] mythical creatures the developers at Rendercore cleverly thought up.
The melee system is cleverly crafted, with most melees not having a change in range or even a change in the model, with the hatchet model taking place for all of the melee options. This is a clever take in cultural appropriation, as no weapon is better than eachother, its all equally [spoiler]terrible[/spoiler] balanced to create a great gameplay experience with engaging combat with previously mentioned [spoiler]stock unity assets[/spoiler] mythical creatures.

The audio quality is bafflingly [spoiler]horrendous[/spoiler] to any human being not in the game development scene, and like i've stated before, the developers of this game aren't human, [strike]trust me, i know[/strike] they are beyond our human comprehension, they have mastered  technology, level design, and concept crafting, and the audio work reflects this.

I accidentally ended up on this game's page while searching for something else. I believe it was a misclick after an error in typing. There were a lot of mistakes involved that allowed me to find this game.

When the video autoplayed on the landing page, I was intrigued by the way the game looks. Mind you, while the game looks very simple, that's what I liked about it. At a price point of $2, you can't ask for much.

At first glance this game looked like a walking simulator with combat sort of... jammed into it. But it reminded me of a simpler time when everyone was using dial-up connections to American Online using Compaq computers and pc games looked pretty much like this but in much less fps. When I was younger, if I saw this, I'd be dying to play it because at the time, I didn't have my own computer. I would only get such chances at school or at a friends house.

The game's appearance took me back, is what I'm trying to say... And while it looked incredibly simple, I had to buy it and play it.

Review:
I have just beaten the game. For $2 of gameplay I enjoyed the game for 2 hours.
The game's graphics look preset, as if the developer didn't actually design any of the assets. However the environments look great for what they are. Everything goes together, nothing really looks out of place with the exception of one enemy I encountered in the sewers.

You play as a dude with a weapon of your choice going through dungeons that look almost randomly generated to find keys surrounded by hazards you have to avoid that unlock a boss room while dodging enemies and attacking them.

-All the enemies have the advantage if you attack them head on. However, all the enemies have the same weakness, sidestepping. It's like they were only programmed to attack where you were when the attack began. So all you have to do to beat the enemy is bait out the attack, sidestep, and return fire. In other words, the A.I is stupid, but for 2 bucks, whatever, I like that. 

-Most of the hazards surrounding the keys boil down to you just jumping over them. One of them is a timed hazard and it doesn't require you to jump at all. Jumping sucks, the animation is too short and it feels wimpy, but it's challenging if the idea is you have to time it exactly right. As far as I can tell, jumping has no practical use in combat.

-You have a good selection of weapons you can purchase with gold you find in chests but they all have relatively short range; Mind you though, with the sidestep strategy, you won't be getting attacked unless you mess up your rhythm or you get attacked by more than one enemy at a time. Later on at a high price, you can purchase ranged arrow weapons.

-There's not much to look at in the environments. Everything repeats so it's nice that the developer included an exact map of where you have been and where you have yet to go. This is much appreciated, otherwise, one could get lost immediately.

-Opening chests and picking up keys is weird because you can only do so by being dead in front of the object and pressing X, which is directly under your WASD keys. It's a little uncomfortable.

-Once you get points invested mostly into Strength and Agility, you can effectively kill most enemies in 2 hits, but you'll have to watch your attack speed, every time you attack quickly, you attack slower, so give a rhythm to your swings and stabs. I really like that there's a bit of strategy involved, even though there's very little of it. Luckily, sidestepping kills everything.

-You will like this game if you want something VERY simple to play with VERY little strategy involved.
-You won't like this game if you don't bother with random games on steam from developers you never heard of that sell their Windows 98 looking games for $2.

I Love it. I'd love to see the concept improved on a larger scale. I knew nothing about it before, I got here by accident, but I like what I found.

I don't think I can fairly grade this game on a normal scale. It implies holding this game to a AAA standard.

I'd recommend perfecting every CS:GO surfing map before even opening the application, because movement in this game is CRITICAL, especially in those closed-corridor boss fights.

The soundtrack is magnificient piece of art. Better than Skyrim's, And the sound desing is so realistic that while wearing my headphones I tought it was real ! Seriously dont even hesitate, buy this game !!!!

I almost forgot to talk about the gameplay, this game is very hard. It is the dark souls of boss fighting games ! I was legitimately scared by the ennemies because of their enormous power,  but it turns out that your character is an olympic sprinter and buy pressing two directions button at the same time you got twice as fast !

A friend had originally purchased this game as a joke, but we ended up being pleasantly surprised. While rough around the edges, the game had a certain charm that kept me playing and kept my friend watching.

An unordered list of thoughts:
[list]
[*]Randomly generated dungeon kept it fresh and unpredictable
[*]Dungeon enemy attacks felt fair and had some stradegy, especially the snakes if you were using melee combat.
[*]Audio indication of combat was a nice touch. Ambient tracks were very unsettling in a good way.
[/list]

Some ideas that could make the game better:
[list]
[*]Variety in ways to get some of the keys. The level that had fire obstacles was a nice change.
[*]Traps. Make your player crawl the dungeon with trepidation!
[*]There should be an achievement for playing the game different ways. One example: not killing any of the regular dungeon enemies.
[/list]

And now let me share my first experience... Being that I went in blind, I had no clue what to expect. I found my way through the first level, but level 2 caught me off guard because the enemy's attack was longer range and my hachet was ineffective at taking them down swiftly. I eventually found myself at 6 HP and the game suddenly transformed into a round of Slender where several enemies were pursuing me. As I weaved through the dungeon, I was frantically trying to avoid enemies, collect keys, and find some health. After several hilarious and scary encounters, I fell to the flames of the key. 

All in all, I enjoyed the 1.5 hours I was playing this! For best results, randomly gift this game to a friend and order them to play it. Fun for both will ensue!",1545984494,1545984551,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Querido Pepe, Por favor, no cometas el terrible error de ignorar las posibilidades humorísticas de este juego!

Así que, querido Pepe, no veas esto como un juego - malo, por que es más malo que pegar a una madre con su propio bebe en la cara - sino, como un maravilloso festival del humor, por que Pepe, seamos sinceros: el mejor humor que existe es, sin duda, el Humor No Pretendido.",1534857240,1534857240,True,1,5,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The sticking point is that it just doesn't feel like a finished game, the whole thing is more like a demo of what the game could be someday if the developer ever tried to finish it, and what there is to the game currently just isn't fun.

The whole game is too dark, you can't even see monsters until they are right next to you and everything, even the treasure in the chests, is a muted variation of grey, so visually the game is uninspiring.  While the swinging animations of weapons is fluid, you really don't get a feel for power behind the swing, even with higher level weapons.  Also, it is almost impossible to tell how far ahead of you your weapon swings reach, so combat feels lackluster and underwhelming.  The jump (while possibly more realistic than most games) is tiny and is also almost impossible to determin how far forward you move.  Since jumping over lava and traps are auto kills, and you can never improve your jump, and you have to jump multiple times in every level to succeed, this feature makes the game unnecessarily tedious and frustrating.

Probably the worst aspect of this game is the inability to save and load your game.  After you die, you do keep gold and experience earned (on the easiest level), but should you accidentally press back when you go to purchase a new weapon or upgrade your stats instead of start, you are immediately brought to the title menu where the only option is to start a new game and everything you just had is gone.  Plus you can never close down the game and come back to where you were before.

So, even for the price this game is not a deal.  Don't get me wrong this title is pretty cheap, if you enjoy FP hack-n-slash games and you don't mind the absolute bare-bones mechanics, you may want to check it out, but you wont be getting anything more than that.",1530236250,1530236250,False,3,0,0.565562427043914795,2,True,False,False,False,,1531660939.0,"""The whole game is too dark""

There are four brightness levels available in the Graphics Settings menu. Have you tried them?


""It is almost impossible to tell how far ahead of you your weapon swings reach""

That's what the crosshair is for. When it's red, it means your attack will hit the enemy. Otherwise it's white.


""You can never improve your jump""

Yes you can. Just use some XP to upgrade your agility, which will make you move faster and jump higher.


""Probably the worst aspect of this game is the inability to save and load your game."" 

Your progress is saved upon completing each level. Did you actually complete any?"

・一応ステータスは攻撃力・防御力・すばやさがある、ステータスは敵を倒して集めた経験地を使ってポイント振り分けで鍛えれるが無限に振り分けられるわけでもなく、割とあっさりカンストする、どれも１０Ｐまで上げたらソレまで。
・ダンジョンに点在するキーを集めてその階層のボス部屋への扉を開いてボスを倒せば階層クリアだが・・・集めなくてはいけないキーが多い、第一階層でいきなり９つ集めるの？こんな単調なのに？しかもキーの周りには常に即死罠あるのに？配置された敵多いし、敵から逃げれないし、敵から逃げると言う選択肢もないのに？
・暗い、とにかくＭＡＰが暗い、第三階層からもう何にも見えないと言っても過言じゃない、周りを照らすアイテムなんかあるわけも無い、設定も言わずもがな
・ＢＧＭがとにかくうるさい、本当にうるさい。緩急のついた静けさからの金切音＆壁ドン床ドンで普通にプレイするにも支障が出るレベル
・唯一いいところがあるなら、敵のビジュアルがしっかりしてる。別にカッコイイとかじゃなく秀逸でもな細かく作ってんなってだけのレベル
・なのでずっとイライラする、ほんとうに面白いと思うところが無いので苦行通り越して荒行


何事にも波打つことが無い心や無我の境地、無心が欲しい言う人はプレイしてもいいでしょう

[h1]Dungeon Crawling Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay is fairly standard for this sort of dungeon crawler, it's a real-time action game, so you walk around and you explore, kill creatures and pick up keys in order to level up and progress to the next level. The movement is simple and well executed, and the animations are smooth and swish.

Unfortunately the levels are extremely repetitive, to the point where most of them feel the same, and the selection of monsters very poor. There is a mini-boss guardian between each level, but they didn't seem to do anything special.  There are also only 7 levels to the entire game (repeatable on 3 difficulty levels), so it's really rather short. There's not a great deal of loot (only gold and health in game, and a very small selection of weapons you can purchase at each level start, no armor or skills or special abilities), and stats don't seem to make a whole lot of difference (and you can max them out by level 5 on casual). There are also no puzzles, and the mapping is standard and predictable, which unfortunately makes this game lack in much of the intellectual variety. 

So, you get where I'm going with this, there's just not enough. It's just shallow. Not enough depth, length, variety or gameplay at all. What is there is done well, and I understand it's a £2 game, but it really feels like the entire game is a Unity demo or concept - and it just needs more more more of everything. Since the levels, monsters and environment lack variety, I was thoroughly bored by the end of casual (approximately 90 minutes). I have no doubt that the harder difficulties are much more challenging - but without any additional monsters, loot or mechanics, I just couldn't find any fun in a further grind.

[h1]Why So Spooky Music Though[/h1]

If there is a mega epic battle around the corner, then the music ramping up in intensity and tone is great. However, the music in this seemed to be slightly confused, as on many occasions it got all excited over absolutely nothing, which really didn't help the tone at all. That wall I just walked into? Yeah, that's not a threat. Sometimes there would be no change in music (there are also no footsteps or noise indicators until you're being stabbed in the back by a goblin), which I suppose added an element of ""jump scare horror"" to the game when I turned around and realized three orcs were all up in my face.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] Smooth animations and reasonable graphics.
[*] Low price.
[*] Increasing difficulties for those who enjoy the game and want a challenge.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]  Incredibly simple and shallow gameplay.
[*]  Boring, due to the lack of mechanics and similar environments.
[*]  Weird music issues.
[*]  Very short (90 minutes on the easy difficulty).
[/list]

[h1]TL:DR It's a thumbs down from me; even at £2 - but it's not a terrible game, just short and somewhat limited, with a few creases that need to be ironed out. It might appeal to those who love this genre, especially when it goes on sale or gets bundled. Give the demo a try, as this is basically the entire game but rinse and repeat.[/h1]",1485172798,1485172946,False,23,0,0.638832032680511475,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Per ora l'ho provato e finito solo a difficoltà casual ma presto lo riprenderò tentando di finirlo anche a normal per cimentarmi nella difficoltà hardcore che si sblocca soltanto dopo averlo completato al secondo livello. 
Alcuni punti negativi ovviamente li ha ma essendo un gioco indie si passa sopra a quasi tutto se si ha poi tra le mani un prodotto valido (e questo, più o meno, lo è): 
1 -La grafica è piuttosto scarna ed essenziale anche se i nemici sono resi molto bene; 
2- Il sonoro a volte risulta essere piuttosto fastidioso (se giocate con le cuffie a volte vi faranno male le orecchie) quando invece si poteva mettere magari meno musica ma aggiungere i rumori che si possono fare sbattendo contro altri oggetti;
3- La componente gdr è appenna abbozzata e, nonostante si continuinono a prendere punti esperienza, non si può superare il lv10 nelle uniche tre abilità (forza, salute ed agilità); 
4- Sempre nella difficoltà cui ho giocato io si capiscono subito quali sono le armi migliori per attaccare i nemici, quindi massimo 1 tentativo ed al secondo finirete il livello;
5- Le armi da acquistare con i soldi trovati lungo il gioco sono troppo poche. Le avrete a metà gioco ma potrete, inutilmente, continuare a raccogliere monete d'oro dai vari forzieri dei livelli;
6- Avrei variato gli oggetti da raccogliere per ogni livello...sempre le chiavi (in numero sempre maggiore ma magari fatemi trovare pietre preziose...);
7- Una scarsa longevità...7 livelli per circa 6 ore di gioco sono pochini. 

In conclusione, per me è prettamente un gioco d'azione fantasy con delle buone potenzialità.
Se ve lo consiglio? Visto il prezzo si anche se ci sono prodotti ""dungeon crawler"" ovviamente di gran lunga più validi ma che costano decisamente di più :)!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA0y31TsWI0

Using my scoring system I use for all games, which is most heavily based on ""value"" and asking the question ""are you getting a good gaming value for your dollar?"".. this game scored an impressive 86% score from me.

The game, while being pretty simple, offers very decent 3D graphics and nice textures and very fluid movement and controls.  Timing is critical, and while I already see some reviews knocking the game for being impossible to jump across lava to get the keys or not being able to hit enemies.. it's all timing and skill based movement to succeed.   Every enemy has a different attack style and speed and method and weapon needed to best defeat them.  If you aren't patient enough (or smart enough) to try different strategies or weapons, then this game might not be for you, but don't knock the game because of your lack of patience or logic.

It's not a AAA game, but I think it's a very nice game for it's asking price, and it offers plenty of replay value as well with randomized dungeon layouts, multiple weapons to buy, and three levels of difficulty, as well as three attributes which can be increased with experience earned.

One note: If you buy this game, PLEASE start on the ""easy"" difficuluty level which will allow you to save your experience and gold progession and advance through the game without getting too frustrated early on.

The clutter to the left really makes it hard for me to focuse on whats going on and throws off my pref vision bad and makes it harder for me to play.

Crypt of the Serpent King is a perfect example of a fun dungeon game! All for $2.99.
You go through randomly generated dungeon levels to find all the keys to unlock the door to the dungon boss. The level styles are varied so it doesn't get boring and the levels are huge so your going to be looking at the mini map a lot if you get lost. If you beat the dungeon boss you get to move on to the next level and can upgrade your stats Strength, Agility, and Endurance with the XP you earned from killing enemies, you can also buy new melee and ranged weapons with the gold you found from loot.
-It's a hard game that has 3 difficulty modes.
-The music fits perfectly with the dungeon style of the game.
-The graphics are simple and clean, but modern. It gives the game a nice retro look. The game runs at a solid 60FPS on ultra, and my PC isn't even that good. Really smooth gameplay.",1482868530,1482980485,True,8,1,0.433253288269042969,2,True,False,False,False,,,

dont get me wrong the graphics are not the best, the mechanics are clunky and the overall appearance seems a little amateur.
