I love Steam so much for letting games like this stay online and purchasable.

The max supported resolution is 1080p, regardless of your video card, but that just makes for a more authentic experience when combined with Lossless Scaling on my 4K monitor. The pixellated look just adds to the style of the game.

I haven't completed a full playthrough yet, but I was able to pay off my loan on the first go, and seem to be pretty well on track. The gameplay is just as fun as it was a decade or so ago. The controls on PC are pretty good, other than the fact that key repeat doesn't work for movement.

The game feels super snappy and responsive, which I guess is to be expected for something so old. There are no issues running it on Windows 10, as long as you don't try to fullscreen the game, which is also to be expected since it uses exclusive fullscreen. But Lossless Scaling lets you make a window fill the whole screen without actually changing resolutions, so that's what I used.

I haven't interacted with the developers directly, but their Steam Discussions posts from when the game was still new seem super friendly and passionate. I feel like they love the game just as much as I do, which is really nice.

All in all, absolutely worth the $10. This isn't one of those games where it's worse than you remember it.",1658868716,1658868716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Arcadecraft é um jogo de gerenciamento de um fliperama que está começando. É um jogo bem interessante, com uma proposta bem legal. Nele, devemos comprar máquinas de fliperama novas que são lançadas, organizar nosso fliperama, botar para fora jogadores que brigam com a máquina, ajustar os preços das máquinas, tirar o dinheiro das máquinas (lembrando que elas tem um limite de quantas moedas podem segurar e, passado esse limite, ela para de funcionar).

Mais para frente no jogo, nós até podemos contratar um funcionário, porém esse funcionário funciona com burrice artificial, infelizmente. O trabalho principal dele é tirar as moedas das máquinas de fliperama, mas, ao invés de ir limpando as que estão mais cheias (ou as que estão paradas por estarem lotadas), ele vai limpando aleatoriamente. Ou seja, diversas vezes no meu fliperama eu tive de limpar as que paravam de funcionar pois o funcionário ficava limpando as outras que mal tinham dinheiro.

Basicamente, no começo é um jogo mesmo de gerenciamento, que devemos também tomar cuidado com os preços, com o nosso dinheiro e etc. Mais para o final, porém, acaba simplesmente virando um jogo de adrenalina, de ter que ficar limpando várias máquinas de fliperama rapidamente (com o seu arcade lotado de máquinas e sempre com gente jogando, que acaba acontecendo, vira uma loucura). Nesta parte final, temos tanto dinheiro que não precisamos mais ficar economizando, podemos comprar como se não houvesse amanhã.

Germany was overly strict to the point where arcade machines were made ""16 years and older"", so watching US TV shows where kids ran around arcades or Bart Simpson spending their money in that, i never really got that. I broke the law a billion times in bowling alley and roller skating rinks where arcade machines and pinballs were lined up, so i got my fair share of arcade action (first arcade i ever played was Golden Axe, first Pinball was Terminator 2, i was so young i only had a chance to look over the table while wearing roller skates :D ) and in fact i remember most my family vacation by the arcade machines and Pinball i played there....i mean why outside of ""They had Golden Axe, Ms. Pac Man and an Earthshaker Pinball!"" would i remember a rather boring camping trip to some camping place in Austria from way over 20 years ago?

Anyway, this game wants to bring back the magic of Arcades and give you the power of controlling an Arcade place. In theory, that sounds awesome. I mean placing Arcade and Pinball machines around, snack machines, soda machines, hiring staff, controlling the crowds (and send in armored guard when a kid runs out of money, like it happened in that one Simpsons episode) but as alwaysr fantasy and reality are quite different. 
This is a very simple, limited game. You start in 1980, when Arcade and Video Games were really starting to become massive, the Golden Age of Arcade. You get a bunch of money, a very annoying assistant (who constantly reminds you of shit you already know) and a small room. You buy your first few machines (which are all based on realy ones, it's a nice touch to recognize Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and watch Pac-Man or Donkey Kong become massive hits), place them and watch the kids come in. 
Until then i thought ""That's fun!"". 
Sadly there is not much else to it. 
Every month you spend your time emptying the machines to get the money and cover your expensives, then with the remaining money you buy new machines (every month there will be at least one new) and keep repeating the process. After a while you will have enough money to flash out your arcade with neon lights, a better floor, wall painting and more electricity so you can put more machines in.
I played the game until 1983, where your goal is to make enough money to pay the bank back your starting money. After that, you just continue. In 1984 the video game crash happens and somehow affects arcade machines (in real life that didn't affect arcades, they remained popular) which only results in your popularity taking a hit, by that time though i was richer than Scrooge McDuck with 30 machines in my arcade (the maximum) and 3 in storage and i stopped because all you do is empty machines, kick out angry kids who want to destroy your machines and repair broken machines. Money wasn't a problem, even during the dark times of the crash i made a profit every month and already had so much money that i could survive several years without profit anyway. So it turned to ""Empty machines, sell some, buy new, place them and repeat and repeat and repeat. 

Obviously this game has a great premise but lacks in depth and features. You have only that one store, you can't open others (And i mean Pizza Connection had that feature in 1994), there are no CPU opponents to challenge you (every Tycoon sim of the last 30 years had that) and nothing really happens. It does feel like a Peter Molyneux game: Great idea, great setting, no content and after 2 hours you saw everything and begin to think of all the missing features and all the flaws (like Theme Park or The Movies)

A parte mais interessante desse game é tentar identificar os equipamentos que vão sendo lançados, visto que os nomes não são os mesmos das máquinas reais. Mesmo assim é possivel identificar clássicos  como Asteroids, Galaga, Pole Position e tantos outros.
No micro gerenciamento, além do posicionamento das máquinas, podemos alterar o valor das fichas e o nível de dificuldade do jogo, essas alterações têm impacto direto nos ganhos e também na popularidade de cada arcade.
A limitação de 30 máquinas, sendo que mais 4 podem ser guardadas no fundo da loja, é algo desnecessário, existe uma dinâmica interessante de eventualmente tirar um título por ele ficar com baixa popularidade e voltar depois, ou ainda vender eles para algum colecionador, mas acaba que você vai vendendo tudo que não gera lucro e isso é bem frustrante.
Ponto positivo para os avisos da assistente quando alguns dos jogos ganham suas versões caseiras para videogames, meu Ms. Pac-Man estava bombando e de repente ninguém mais queria jogar, exatamente como ocorria.
Fora isso, você pode mudar o visual do estabelecimento colocando neon, pintando as paredes e colocando pisos coloridos, no final além de comprar os arcades, sua grande missão é recolher as fichas e colocar os vagabundos que ficam socando as máquinas para fora.

Overall, I enjoyed this game for what it is. It is a simple simulation game, but not like many other simulation games. It is compared to GameDev Tycoon, but they are not alike. I found the game to be extremely easy. I have failed at GameDev Tycoon, but I cannot see anyone running out of money in Arcadecraft. Still, I did enjoy my playthrough of it, which took me over three hours to do.

Some of the issues I saw with the game (Yes, some of these are just me being very picky):

1. I do not see much replayability to the game as I would do the same things again. I even achieved five of the six milestones in the first playthrough and would have done the sixth if I had looked at them prior to turning down the first import console.

2. There are not enough employees. I found myself wishing for a second employee to repair broken machines. While some would argue that I may want to sell a machine instead of fixing it, so this should not be automated, this is not the case as the ""sale"" price of the machine increases by the repair cost when it gets repaired, so either way, I get the same amount of money if I sell it immediately.

3. The one employee that I do get (which I saw more value in than others have), did not empty all coinboxes. There were several that he never emptied (e.g. Mario, I mean Contractor Twins, all of the imports, and several others.) I placed these in various places and left them full, but he never emptied them. Instead, I would see him empty non-full machines. If he were a real employee, I would have had a conversation with him about priorities.

4. POWER OUTAGES! These were just annoying. As I see it, they serve two purposes. One, to make sure that I have not walked away from the game and left it running to just keep making money. Two, to punish me for having a successful arcade that is the largest possible and full of machines. First, games should never punish a player for success. Second, if the purpose is to keep me from walking away, then there are better ways to address this. (I did understand the first one, though, as it happened just when I had the maximum number of machines before needing to increase power. It does not, however, make sense when I am at the highest power level.)

5. There are only 28 or 29 days in February, not 30.

6. I was left wishing for more expansion opportunities. There is space in that room to allow 40 machines without moving to a new space.

7. The pillar in the middle of the room was annoying and blocked the view to part of the room at all times.

Other than these mostly minor issues, I very much enjoyed my playthrough of this game. I would recommend it, and unlike what others have said, I believe that it is worth the $9.99. After all, I pay more to go see a movie which lasts less time and is often less entertaining, so this is a decent price for the amount of entertainment that I have already received even if I never play it again, and I am not saying that I won't!",1500685097,1500761135,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Plus, some things are missing :

- I don't have the feeling that keeping up surviving through years will bring anything new to the gameplay. It looks like all you have to do is just sell old games, buy new ones, and keep it up. It's ok for an hour or two, but after that, it gets a bit dull. Saw there were employees, but it was locked and had no intel about it, so i gues it won't change the game so much.

- I only had 10/11 games, and i got quickly bored by the fact that you must press space on every one of them to get your money. I understand this is a way to keep the play active instead of just staring at the screen, but we should at least be able to collect money by holding space and quickly move from a machine to another.

- When moving a game, you can move on a tile where there is already a game. Although i understand the fact that you don't want us to put two games on the same tile, i think it should just make the moved game red and transparent, instead of preventing you from going on that tile. Because of that, you are forced to navigate through the maze of your machines in order to place the one you are currently moving, and this is not intuitive nore pleasant.

- In the same spirit, let us move the cursor through pillars and desk. If i put a row of games against the right wall for instance, everytime i want to collect moneay, i'm forced to go around the pillar instead of just going through it.

Was able to play  this game through to the end for the first time. It looks like they fixed some of the crashing problems i experienced several years ago. They added a few new features such as Employees. (although its just a guy who helps you empty your machines)

Game is rather short i beat it in about 5.5 hours, and the game is really not even complete or has a ending. The devs tell you this in game when you near the end. The gameplay is great fun. Placing machines where you want, buying  new games, managing your money so you can by the cool new games from japan once a year. I love many aspects of the game, its so much fun. The problem is that once you get past year 3 or so, with your arcade  full with 30 machines and profits in the six figures range, the game really starts to become boring. You only seem to get one new game a month, and your time is spent just emptying your machines, which is not fun when you have 30 of them. So much unfinished game features for the end of this game. 

So much potential in this game I wish the devs revist it or  would have expanded on the features of the game. Different locations, sizes of arcades, more running your own buisness type stuff. You will have alot fun your first couple of playthroughs. In the end if you have 30 machines going it should have been worth $10 for a few hours of good fun.",1452033623,1599768048,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After getting frustrated trying to work the difficulty and quarter algorithms, I realized the way to play this game is to just leave it alone. Literally, leave it alone. This game begins as a semi-AFK arcade simulator where you drop machines, wait til they gather 400 coins, and then farm the machines. You panic somewhere in the middle when, for some stupid goddamn reason, the bank doesn't pull payments from you, and instead demands your loan in full upfront. This is not made known to the player until about 6 months before the loan is due, which still creates a crazy tough hardship in your arcade. I had to restart twice to be able to pay the loan.

The good news? Once you pay your stupid damn loan, now your arcade is too profitable. You'll hit 1983 and all of the sudden you have $60,000 in your bank at all times. This will undeniably happen because of how easy the game becomes during the 1982 ""arcade boom"". The game goes from 100 to 0 really quickly.

I played through the game completely twice and easily managed to get all achievements, also being a little OCD on second playthrough, getting both sets of triology games and keeping the starting 5 machines to the end to see if they would go super classic or anything, which they did not. The Japanese imports also never go classic and the first one will stop making money completely. I like how each machine is individual and unique.

While Arcadecraft is fun to play it does become evident that the designers were onto a great idea, but that the final execution needs more polish.  For one thing the pace of the game feels rushed and there is not enough time for the player to actually take a breath and enjoy perusing the stats and do proper planning.

Theme Park and Theme Hospital both had better pacing and more content and felt more complete.  Hopefully the designers will take cogniscence and inspiration from those and improve the game to make it more player friendly.

The ability to rent different arcade venues and to place machines at local businesses would fluff the game out a bit more.  

Competition with rival arcades is a missed opportunity.  The possibility of setting up the arcade at a go-kart track or an ice rink are also missed opportunities.  Machine rental to events like carnivals or to school cafeterias would have also been a nice feature.  A bigger variety of vending machines and some incidental furnishing and decor would also be a good feature.  Addition of things like a pay phone, coffee shop, hotdog stall etc would also have added something.

So ultimately the player is left feeling the game concept is solid, but that the game is not complete.

Certainly worth a look and a few hours if the game is on a 50% or better discount.  Bear in mind though that Arcadecraft does not have a high re-playability factor.  This review will be revised if the game is improved by the developer.

By the time the 2 years is up on the loan, its virtually impossible to be in the black. I don't say this with a sense of bravado: after failing on multiple attempts, I looked up strategies online, and found that I am not the only one suffering from this problem. In the trainers that do describe strategy, they are describing strategies that work on the original platform, rather than the steam version. I followed these trainers to the letter... they say you can get $1500 / mo on soda if you charge $1. Yet I received $2600 on soda after TWO YEARS. Clearly the developers thought that this was an exploit, and ""patched"" it, only to make their game impossible to win.

The difficulty is definitely much higher on the Steam release than the original platform. I find that game cabinet placement almost never gives more than 1 star. So-called ""Classic"" games don't noticably offer more business or revenue  or even much of a popularity bonus to themselves, despite claims by the game hintboxes, that they do.

So in the end: unwinable game, negative review. Some of you might cry foul at this, or that I simply didn't find ""the right way"", but even if that were true (and I don't believe that it is), a simulation game with only one way to win, doesn't seem like a good simulation game to me. It should be as-if I owned and was running an arcade, not a test of my ability to read the minds of the developers.

It's too difficult to build up capital in the early stages of the game.  I've never made it past the two year mark (or whenever the loan repayment is due) because you need to spend all of your profits buying new games because people stop playing old games after a few months.  In that regard, it's difficult to build up a large amount of cash on hand, so you end up forced to sell off a bunch of games to pay off the loan, after which the games you have left aren't making enough money to allow you to build back up and you go bankrupt.  On top of that, the games break, or are broken, occasionally and need repairs, so the games aren't very profitable in the long run.

I'm sure there's a way to figure it out and make it work, but i bought this for a casual game of mind-numbing fun, not a tedious game of intricate book-keeping.

It is not, in fact, a simulation game.  It is very casual, and is more a button masher than a simluation.

As a kid who grew up in the 80's and the heyday of arcades, I always wanted to own an arcade.  Being able to pick the games you place, the atmosphere, decorum, ticket prizes, food/beer selection, advertising and promoting it, being able to throw private parties at one...these are all exciting and intruiging ideas to me.  I would quite enjoy the ability to make a custom arcade and to see how well it could actually do based on these choices.

Unfortunately, this game only scratches the sruface of those ideas.  You do not serve food/drinks, you have an extremely limited number of games you can purchase, and the decoum is nice looking, but limited.  ""Maintenance"" on a machine involves picking the machine up and hammering the button several times until it starts to work again.   You do not build an arcade, you have a pre-defined space with limited choices on what you can do.  Want a huge two-story mega-arcade?  Can't happen.  The layout of the arcade is the same for every game, so the replay value is extremely low.

On top of the lack of building options, there isn't really much of a simulation happening here.  What you see on the screen is not what is occuring behind the scenes, and machines will generate money all day, even when no one is playing.  There seems to be little strategy involved other than ""get the best machines in different genres"" and you win.

Overall I was pretty disappointed, and hope one day we can in fact get an arcade simulator.  Unfortunately, this is not it.",1417284033,1417284033,False,40,1,0.768028318881988525,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I made it to 1987 with 30 games and $120K in funds. Then the game announces that I can play through 1987 but no new games will be available which basically means that you arcade has nowhere to go but down. The base gameplay is solid but is lacking details. During my play session, I did find a few things annoying and a few things I would add:

1. There is a ""clunk"" sound that seems to be reused too much. It sounds like the same sound when your machine is full of money or some kid is bashing on it or the coin slot is jammed.  The problem is you have some kid running around breaking your games (that you have to pay to fix) but that sound could also be something else far less serious. It should be a unique sound like a kid yelling or something.

2. The one employee you can hire is almost useless (but still costs you $800/mo). He will stand around while your machines are full of coins and unable to accept more. You will still have to run around 30 machines emptying the coin boxes over and over and over and over. The jerk won't even re-fill the soda machine. I should be able to pay an emlpoyee more money and have him do a better job. Where are the security guards? Repair techs? By the way, what does the guy at the counter actually do besides nothing?

3. Time passes too fast. True in real life too I suppose.

4. Not enough games or variety of games. There really is no reason this game should end in 1987. Arcades were still viable up through the mid-1990s. The game should start out in 1970 with pinballs then b&w paddle games then on through the 80s with videos and laser-disc games, and end in the 90s with fighting and gun games. It would be nice to see the evolution of the arcade over a 25-year arc. All games over 6-7 years old should be considered classics.

5. There are no redemption-type machines.

6. Why am I limited to 30 games? There is floor space for more as it is but you should the option to expand your space.

7. Why can't I advertise? Even lemonade stand on the Apple II had this feature. Radio? TV? Flyers? I want to spend some of my scrilla to promote my arcade to make...more...scrilla. How about holding tournaments?

8. There should be an option to set the games to free play or nickel play and maybe an option to charge an admission.

9. When I saved my game (oh yeah.. why only 1 save game slot?) I had a 5-star arcade. When I loaded it back, I had a 3-star arcade. WTF? I am anxiously awaiting the day when a computer game can have multiple save slots. If only that technology existed. I tell ya, we can put a man on the moon...

10. Where is the air hockey table? Seriously guys, there is no such thing as a respectible arcade without an air hockey table.

11. Why so few pinball machines and cocktail games? Should not be hard to change the textures to make more. While on the subject, there should be several newly released  games to choose from each month including uprights, cocktails, cockpit, pinballs, etc. One measly new game option per month (or some months, none) is not compelling. 

Anyhow, this is a good game. It is fun but ultimately the lack of content and very limited flexibility (oh boy I can buy a pumpkin head and a christmas tree) does let it down. In my case, once I got to 1987 and had a successful arcade, there really is no compelling reason to play it again.

I'm  not exactly sure what I expected here.  I've been a fan of both management style games and old school arcades for some tame.  This game barely delivered either.  

On the first point, the management in this game is minimal making the entire game too easy by far.  Ultimately all you do is make sure you buy a new game or two every month, upgrade the few upgrades you can when you can, then spend the rest of the time clicking on machines as they fill with quarters/need a repair.  The scant challenges and decisions that don't involve your machines are either mundane or just a break in the flow of... well OK it's a welcome change from just draining quarters from stuffed machines.

On the second, unless you know the history of arcades there is very little to glean over your scant seven year run as an arcade owner.  It makes nods to the video game crash, gives a few details when certain games got popular and declined, and does little else to educate a younger crowd into the way things were.

This game is certainly something that would be better off staying  on a tablet or mobile phone.

The basica mechanics of this game works, but that's just it, the mechanics are very basic. You put down some machines and they'll start generating money based on the set difficulty and price, whether anyone is using them or not. Customers teleport (you'd think with fancy 3d graphics it might have some walking animations but nope) in to a machine, play a bit and then back out, occasionally one will hit a machine and you'll have to throw him out, that's as far as the customer interaction goes.

Sure, you can tweak the apperance of the arcade and some other stuff to make it more popular and thus increase the rate at which money is generated by your machines but still, mechanics are far too simple to be worth your time.

Certainly wouldn't blame anyone for mistaking it for an early access title.

We're talking FTL hard!  I've only been able to survive 2 years (1980 & 1981), which in game time is not all that long.  I've tried numerous techniques, concentrating on just buying games, sprucing up the place more than buying games, buying vending machines along with games, and an amalgamation of all of the above.   The result is always the same.  You lose.  

And that's the problem.  The game doesn't seem to allow you to portray any semblance of a successful arcade of the time.  I have only ever been able to max the number of arcade machines owned at 6, and that my friend, doesn't remind me of a booming arcade of the era.

I don't mind hard games like FTL if the experience feels rewarding as you play.  Unfortunately the balance between the amount of money you receive in Arcadecraft, and it's various pricing structures of things you need to buy, are highly unbalanced.  You're always poor.  In fact, this causes the game to feel unrewarding past the first 3 or 4 months in game time.  You boom for the first few months, but then every month after that you slowly watch your Arcade decay into nothingness.  I've seen arcades that have been successful for years and that's not the case in Arcadecraft.  [Quick Note:  Even when you run out of arcade machines, because you had to sell them all to pay off debt, and you have no other way to make any more money, you have to watch a lonely representation of yourself sit behind a counter watching the days roll by.  The game itself doesn't realize the endgame has come and lets you live a couple extra months with nothing to do before the inevitable end.  OK, you could also just restart the game.]  

And maybe that's the point of the game.  To let you know how futile it is to open an arcade.  Maybe the game is trying to show you historically how stupid the dream of owning an Arcade really was.  I on the other hand, want to remember Arcades as they were to me, a fun place to get my game on and to hang out with my buddies!  And being provided the tools to create my own Arcade, I want to provide my virtual people with that same kind of fun.  If this game took a queue from more successful sim titles like Sim City, or even Rockstar Ate My Hamster, this would be more fun.  Mainly because history doesn't have to repeat itself.  

As it is, I can recommend Arcadecraft as a ""pretty to look at"" diversion, and a short enjoyable piece of nostalgia.  Pick it up only if it's on sale.  I got it for just under 5 dollars.",1405305952,1405326086,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unlike another similar store simluation game, Recettear, Arcadecraft unfortunatly suffers from almost all aspect of what you should NOT do in this type of game. The idea sounds simple, buy arcade cabinets, set a price and hope you will make a profit from it. But in this game, it seems none of what you do matter and all it is becomes a repetitive dread of hitting spacebar, tab, and enter.

Unlike Recettear, there is no point in choosing which cabinet to buy or to find an optimum price or placement of the machine, despite what the game tells you that it does. All you need to do is to save up enough money to buy one of each cabinet, set it in the store, and start smashing spacebar to collect money. Any price/difficulty other than the default will result in an un-optimum pay rates and it seems like cabinet placement gives little incentive/consequence to how popular it will be.

Unless you are aiming for a high score to compare to other people, there is really no point or incentive to keep on playing the game. If you can surive the first year with any profits, then you can't possibly lose the game if you just sell the old machine and replace them with new machines. There isn't even any reason to decorate the store as it makes no impacts to the store's popularity.

TL;DR, Arcadecraft is repetitive and boring, if you want a good store simluation game, go buy Recettear",1404891436,1405210104,False,14,0,0.66775435209274292,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Arcadecraft is a business/tycoon game where you manage an arcade in the 1980s. Sounds like a great concept for a game, right? You name your arcade and need to buy some games for your customers to play. To make money, you need to keep your games popular, adjusting their prices and difficulty. You'll also need to keep them in working order and replace older machines with the latest popular games. But hold it - some old games can become classics, and they can give your popularity a bonus, as well as increase the popularity of that specific game. So what's wrong with this game?

[b]This Game is Too Hard![/b]
This game is challenging, but for all the wrong reasons. Many of the game's features are stacked against you and there's little you can do about it. For example - if you get a specific game to be really popular, the logical thing to do would be to raise its price or make it harder to increase your profits. But in game, it doesn't work at all - even daring to increase price or difficulty one notch will bring the game crashing down. Now let me ask the developers - if changing price or difficulty is useless to do, then WHY IS THIS FEATURE IN THE GAME?!

The games get a popularity bonus if they are placed next to their own sequels, and your arcade becomes more popular if you have a selection of genres available to play. But there is only minimal indication of this in-game. There is little warning that some games are sequels (Qualify Lap and Fuel Injection, despite both being racing games from the same company, and being the came cabinet with a pallet swap, are NOT related!) or if a game will have a sequel at all, and there is no way to view the overall genre makeup of your arcade (is a screen showing 3 platformer, 5 sports, 4 shooter, 2 racing too much to ask?). Unless you manually check every game you own, you're not going to know. Same thing with classics - some classics become big money earners, but others are a useless game with a fancy title. Oh, randomly some collector with offer you cash for a classic game. Can you view this game before deciding, so as to weigh the decision? Nope!

But once you learn how to play and what features to use (sequels, arcade customizing) and not use (pricing, difficulty) then you uncover a different problem...

[b]This Game is Too Easy![/b]
I can hear you already: ""You just said it's too hard! Now you say it's too easy?! Pick one, moron!""

But really, this is one of those games that's ""hard to learn, easy to master"". Once you understand which games become classic money spinners, have sequels, etc.  then no challenge remains. The moment you pay off your debt, the game might as well stop and declare you the winner, because there is nothing to stop you after that. Oh, there IS stuff to do - make sure you move an arcade cabinet to an arbitrary spot, manually empty change boxes, and fix broken games. Seriously, what was the point of all these ""features""? It's just tedious busywork stopping you from leaving the game running. Did we really need random power outages, which do nothing but make you click each cabinet twice?

This game could've been quite fun. This game should've been fun. But as it stands, it's a waste of $12.99.",1404078708,1404078788,False,4,0,0.519094407558441162,0,True,False,False,False,,,

経営シムとしてはシンプルでとっつきやすい。白黒のインベーダーもどきとルナーランダーもどきしかないミニマルな店からスタートし、時間と共に少しずつ充実してくる新作カタログを見ながら予算をやりくりするのは実際なかなか楽しい。この最初の2年が一番難しいため、慣れないうちは何度か借金返済に失敗してやり直すことになるかもしれない。

面白くなりうる土台はあるのだが、調整不足か予算不足で不完全なままにリリースされてしまった作品という印象。雰囲気は良いので、一周（4～5時間）遊んで満足する分にはアリか。リプレイ性はほとんどないので、実績回収をしない限り二周やる必要はない（意識してプレイすれば一周目で実績コンプリートも可能）。",1403600715,1403600715,True,19,0,0.738675713539123535,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Arcades were huge in the 80's and the idea of simulating a business in the golden age of gaming sounds awesome, so why am I scrambling to empty each machine's coin tray to scrape up enough for the end of the month while the kids playing are calling my machines ""lame"" or ""classic"" when they're only a year old? The popularity stars on the games seem to plummet before six months and well before they've even paid for themselves, and increasing the difficulty or charging more for new games is a death sentence. Even having high total arcade popularity dosen't seem to make a difference.

The fundamental elements of strategy games are non-existent here. There's no contol of time (not even pausing), no graphs (not that you'd have the time to view them anyway), and popularity is a joke. There's no control of lighting, placement (in reguards to machines near bathrooms or enterance) is meaningless, and besides the games themselves there's only a cola machine and a jukebox. When I first started playing I bought a vending machine thinking it would provide sugar for the kids and I could jack the price for convience. I decided to put it near the bathroom thinking that games wouldn't do well there, only to find once I placed the machine it was day 10 already. The vending didn't make a difference on the kids (sugar seems to have no value) and it's run just like any other machine. The kids don't seem to care if food is available, they don't care if they are near the bathroom, they don't notice machines near the entrance first, they just magically warp to the machines. Their feedback is minimal.

Instead of strategy you get clicking busy work. Oh no, the power went out! You have to replug all the machines, which takes a whole day apparently. You're not making any money because you haven't been manually emptying every machine yourself, which makes that game unplayable for a bit too. Better look out, a kid is breaking the machines and you have to throw him out, if you've taken a moment to read something he can easily smash three machines before you get to him, goodbye $500 in repairs. All of these examples would be fine, with time control. Without the ability to pause you're franticly clicking and don't have time to check your options before you buy new equipment, or a moment to breath and organize the room. Occassionaly a star will appear on a tile for a short while, if you scramble to put a machine there before the star disappears the machine mystically becomes more popular till the end of the month. What great strategy.

I scraped by month after month with $800 to spare when the game wanted $13,000 for a loan payment. Ugh. Again, that would be fine if I could take a moment to figure out what I did wrong, but business RTS is just not a good mix. 

I advise you take this game's own advice. When Arcadecraft is easier and going for $.25 it's popularity should go up, until then, don't touch it.",1403467261,1403467465,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Things that would make this game better:

1) Interface adjustments to make sure icons are always visible, especially when the pillar or entrance is in the way.

2) More interesting game game modes, so there isn't just a single difficulty hump.  Perhaps adding senarios with different win conditions, or a survival mode with bigger loan payments every year.

Ranging from games getting released on consoles to angry gamers taking it out on your machines, there are a number of factors that make this game hard but fun. One aspect I am sure is designed to keep you occupied while time passes is the collecting of quarters from your machines. I wish there was a way to automate that a bit as I feel like I spend most of my time shaking down my machines of their money and less time worrying about game placement, getting new games, or changing decorations around.

Time passes by slowly enough to give you a chance to keep moving your games around and taking care of unruly gamers but I feel like I never have enough money to keep fresh games in stock. While older games can inherit a ""classic"" status that boosts popularity of your arcade, it does not feel like its enough. Little events that occur seem to happen randomly but not random enough to break the monotony of collecting quarters. Some of these events can vary from power failures (pick up every machine and set them back down) to a stuck coin slot (repeatedly pick and set down a game to eventually free the coin slot). Occasionally a hardcore gamer will come in and try for a record high score which boost a game's popularity but the catch is the game is tied for a long time while the gamer tries for their high score.

I wish games you unlocked stayed unlocked through multiple playthroughs because seeing the same set of three games every time you restart your arcade gets tiresome. Restarting your game is expected as the tutorial does not explain everything and you are likely to overspend your money and find yourself hurting to get by every month. In the end, the game is fun but I am just not sure how long the fun will last. I feel as if more novelty is needed to really hook me. Also, I wish I could rotate my view of the arcade because certain games are hard to see when placed behind other games or pillars and it can be hard to target them for collecting money or fixing. 

The game does a good job at keeping you informed at the little details of a game like graphics style, if it has become profitable, changing the games difficulty and cost. I think more positive events in the game and making money a bit easier to do would improve the game to more fun event and less like a chore to play. It definitely does a good job at capturing the feel of owning an arcade but includes the dangers of owning one all too well. After playing this, one could easily become disillusioned with owning their arcade.",1401252425,1401252760,True,21,0,0.559101521968841553,0,False,False,False,False,,,

1) It is a fun game to play FOR THE FIRST RUN THROUGH. There is no replay value what so ever other than
trying to obtain a better high score.
2) There is a lot to be desiered. I had no struggle what so ever with the game. I just kept getting the newst game 
and it was fine. I even got board and bought all the custimizations you can.
3) There is no indepth system. Now on this i dont blame them cause after i played ""Game dev tycoon"" 
I relized that they had the same flaw. You see to me making a simulation game needs to be indepth. A drag and 
drop or a slide meter (in the case of game dev) does not really make it a simulation. Yah you can change how much the 
games cost to play. However that leads me to 4
4) no matter what happens if you rasie the price it seems like your doomed. I had 5 Star popularity from like year to 
and all i did was drop each game diff. to easy and made it a quarter thats it. 

In counclusion. This game lacks what makes a sim game a sim game. Its more of a place your machine here and thats 
really it. There is no indepth system for you @ all.  I would of like to see some of the following
Marketing. Choosing your building (maybe certin areas have a preff. to certin genre). People accepting harder diff. games and not making it so your game becomes unprofitable if you do that. These are just a few things.

Figure it would be similar, but with running an arcade instead of a video game company. After about 12 hours of figuring things out and wasting so much of my time, i finally gave up. The game is nowhere near done, nor worth more then a dollar. There is barely a tutorial to help in the fine details of how the game works. Controls are either slippery or too heavy. I couldn't move anything to where i wanted it without either using the directional keys or practically flailing around with my mouse. Events in game overlap each other to the point where keys tend to freeze and when in the middle of a important action, having the game stop you and drop what you are doing. I have had so many games broken just because when i was taking the problem customer over to the door, the month ended and forced me to let go and the person destroyed it. Pausing is confusing, things still happen during events and menus. Not sure if really paused. Its basically a Facebook game. It’s the worst kind of time waster where I sit here tending to the machines without really interacting with them. Their stats (If they really are stats) have no meaning. They say if I put games in certain configurations, I can maximize popularity. Through all my tests and random ideas, never have I saw a difference in any configuration. It’s like RCT, you put the ride down, it gets popular for a while, then people get bored and you replace it. Except here, the money is so much tighter that after the first two months, your poor as shit. It is almost impossible to come up positive at the end of the two months. You are going to sell 75% of your games and slowly watch helplessly as the game closes in on you. And even better, when I sold my last game, I just broke even and the game continued. I couldn’t do anything for a month, I had 0$, no games, no vending, and yet still no game over. If I was patient enough, I would have sat there waiting to see what happens. But no, its not worth my time. The best part of the game is the variations of arcade games you can buy… then they ruin that too. It’s the usual cabinets with different textures, no super special games like DDR or Gun games, No fighting games, Overly expensive pinball (only one) game, and a racing game that is also too expensive, but is the most interesting game to look at. I hate to ramble on, but there is so much more. The characters you choose are bland and boring. It’s so bland, why isn’t there a character creation? It would make it slightly better? And the pop machine is a joke. It makes the least amount of money and has to be maintenance every 2 months. It’s a waste. There is this huge space for games and such, but I have only ever been able to fill a small corner (barely) with games. By the time I can afford a new one, I sold like two. Also that god damn post in the middle of the screen drives me crazy. This might just be me, but that post makes movement around the screen harder than it already is and is a general design flaw in my eyes. There is probably more issues im forgetting but this is my biggest problems.

TL;DR – Play a Facebook game, it’s the same but more stable than this. Still better built then Ride to hell.

Individual machines have popularity, which usually increases when the game is cheap/easy. However, increasing the games price per-play seems to make it's popularity take a nose dive, as well as increasing the games difficulty yields the same result (I have absolutely no idea what the direct benefit is to increasing a games difficulty anyways). This typically ends up having all of your machines being very cheap, and very easy, ensuring that you have people playing them all the time. Unfortunately, even keeping all machines occupied as much as possible for an entire month, never seems to yield you much of a profit. Couple this with the fact that moving or empyting the machine seems to force the current player off losing that one sale, and the random ""events"" like repairing a broken machine, makes it so you can only ever break even with your expenses. 

This wouldn't be so bad, but new machines unlock at the end of every month, giving you the idea that you should constantly be buying new games for your arcade. Instead it simply taunts you, showing you shiny new toys that are forever out of your pitiful financial grasp.

I also feel like some sort of graph or chart to illustrate each games strengths and weaknesses would be nice. In its place you have to read a wall of text just to understand what it is you're purchasing exactly, which doens't seem to make any lick of difference what-so-ever in the games popularty.

What I liked about it was  being able to design your own arcade with a variety of games you can choose from. It's cool being able to set up the arcade to maximize profits. It reminds me a lot of those old sim games, like sim-hospital, where you kinda have to think ahead in design and utilization of space in order to succeed. 

As I mentioned, the game can get very addictive. You constantly have to keep up a stream of cash flow to pay the rent and to keep your arcade up-to-date. It's not easy and games lose their appeal to customers quickly. You're often forced to resort to selling older, less popular games in order to keep up with the trends. As you progress, you can change the design of the arcade and even move into different locations. 

Surprisingly, there's more to do than to just place arcade cabinets and collect money. For example, you may have to eject an unruly customer, repair machines, keep vending machines stocked, clear coin jams, and constantly empty coin banks to keep the machines running.
