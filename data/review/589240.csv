I would be more than happy to give a glowing review for the free ride.  I'm kidding of course, my ethics in reviewing games on Steam prevent me from doing so :DDDDDDD hahahahahahaha hahahahaaha hahahahaha

However, I'm reviewing the VR experience and it's less than stellar, especially on the Oculus Rift.  The Oculus Rift is being listed as supported, however, you have to do the Windows 7 compatibility fix to get it to work properly.  Okay that's no biggie since this experience is free.  But even after you do the fix, the video stutters along.  It's really hard to enjoy the vehicle and the details put into it the I-PACE vehicle model when the video problems detract severely from it.

You honestly get a very little info on the vehicle.  You get more details just by looking at it.  The amount of details put in the car to match the real-life counterpart is amazing (e.g. you can see the stitchings on the seat!)  However, the narrated experience is very barebones.  There's no way to get more information on the car than what the guided experience gives you.  You get told to visit the Jaguar website.  Of course, it's probably advisable just to go to the Jaguar website and forget this VR title if you're really interested in this vehicle.

So it's cool to be inside the car.  But that's all you do.  The rest is point and click.  I was hoping they would at least let you feel what it's like in motion.  You don't even get that.  You want me to download your 1GB of data for an ad, at least let me feel what it's like going down the road.  I just can't recommend this experience, it's a try once and delete for the truly curious or for VR junkies.  I'd never show this off to a friend, so it's a NO recommendation.
