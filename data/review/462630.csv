I got this during the last sale, but unfortunately had to return it because it would get the black screen right after launching. I left a comment in the discussions, but just realized it was under someone else’s comment, so if you see this, do you know what would cause that? I’d like to get it again if I can get it working, but I tried everything from file verification to redownload to restarting the pc (I think I even fiddled with the compatibility options) but no luck.

It's hard though. You have to develop skill with fine maneuvering to avoid traps/sensors. Combat requires you to make effective use of dodge/dash and counterfire. You ambush slower enemies and have to be aggressive with the more nimble enemies. Opportunities to develop play style with different weapon types. Be prepared to go through the whole mission then get killed at the end, and just give it another go.

As another reviewer said, you need a gamepad for this to be fun, I agree 100% and would say definitely do not attempt to play this with keyboard/mouse. I would add to that apparently you need a really good gamepad. 

I have an okay gamepad, about $20 US, which has served me fine for a variety of twinstick games, but I could not progress past the mine section of the Event 0 tutorial level.

There is a tight gap you have to hit, and my gamepad apparently does not have fine enough controls to hit the angle. Additionally, something about the way the game interprets stick movement results in no ability to perform fine movement adjustments; trying to go backwards gives a little stutter in the wrong direction, so getting a little off-course means death as correction becomes impossible. You simply cannot pass the tutorial without finer control than I have available to me.

Tried to enjoy it, it looks like there's some fun content there and I'm into these types of games, but having a legitimately impassable portion of the tutorial level is not the way to hook new people. I gave it about 5 tries x 5 lives per try, dying to the same two mines every time, I am now done with this game.

Would really like to give a better review but not with the controls in their current state.",1528576019,1528603539,True,2,0,0.481365501880645752,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The game now features the full content. The game is a pretty fun [b]twinstick shooter[/b], though multiplayer is heavily recommended, both due to the difficulty curve and the enhanced fun that comes from careening past your ally as an explosion flings you.

Release issues aside, the game does feature a little bit of jank, though some of this may be down to netcode desync rather then the game itself. It's nothing world ending but it is noticeable.

1. Das Spiel startet trotz Kauf über Steam (also kein Schlüssel aus grauer Quelle) als Demo und verlangt die Freischaltung.
Dennoch konnte ich erst einmal loslegen. 

2. Die Steuerung. Leider keine klassische Twinstick-Steuerung (gespielt am X-Box One-Pad). Linker wie Rechter Stick sind für die Flugrichtung, Waffen werden über Analog-Trigger ausgelöst. Ist vielleicht eine Gewöhnungssache, finde ich persönlich aber nicht so gut gelöst.

3. Der eigentliche Grund für meine negative Kritik: Schon klar. Es ist ein Coop-Shooter. Aber Solo-Spieler sehen hier einfach kein Land. Es gibt offenbar keine Skalierung des Schwierigkeitsgrades. Wer alleine loszieht, wird gleich in der ersten Mission chancenlos zusammengeschossen. Also noch einmal in aller Deutlichkeit: Wer niemanden hat, der auch Bock auf das Spiel hat, der sollte es nicht kaufen.

4. Die Grafik. Kleines Team, sieht doch ganz nett aus, was willst Du denn. Richtig. Sieht nett aus. Gar keine Frage. Aber bei näherem Hinsehen offenbaren sich schwache Texturen, generisches Gegnerdesign und Effekte, die mit Sicherheit so auch auf einem Tablet laufen könnten. Das mir dann doch ein wenig zu wenig.
