Pros:
1- This game does not have any sexual(content and harrasment), inappropriate scenes, or even seduction although its a dating sim unlike other dating sim games, which makes it appropriate for most ages!!

2- This game is emotional more than its romantic

3- The soundtrack used is very rare(Referring to its style and way)

4- Story is well written and motivating! You cant get from your seat before seeing some parts.

5- No bad language used(e.g f**k, b**th and so on)

Cons:
1- Games like Area-x are hard to find nowadays(Referring to clean dating sims without inappropriate scenes)

2- In one of the characters paths, there are some(but not many) scenes of alcohols which may be inappropriate for some people

The game is a little confusing at first, specially with the choices you make. Like, talking to a bartender can change whether you get the good or the bad ending so it is like, if you don't follow a guide, you will be stuck a long time on the bad ending (the company made one, it is available here http://www.zeiva.net/otome/area_x_guide.html ).

There are some things the game itself does not explain to you. Like, when you reach an ending, you get a message saying something about SEA or SKY path so let me explain to you. Once you finish Belph & Yuras both good and bad endings, you complete a word that is a password to get to the SEA path which allows you to play both Livan & Rexus path (which I haven't done at the time of writting this review) but it is actually easy to do.

Now, about the story itself. I like it a lot, I have always liked time travel novels and this one is mixed with otome! It is not the best, it has its flaw sometimes but this is truly an underrated masterpiece.

We have character change their outfit through the story, which not much game have it.
The flash engine is not pleasant to play for sure. But it system do improve A WHOLE LOT compare to the first version they put out, when we didn't have skip! (and wayyy back then when X-Note didn't even have save feature for god sake!)
A good protagonist which is witty, smart, hilarious and super charming.
Great story for both mystery and emotional.

Cons
I do understand why ppl find it kinda pricey, it a little short compare to it price indeed.
We can't hide the user interfact for the sake of having a clear CG.
We have to replay the last route just for the sake of bonus scene, which I don't understand why they have to locked it??? I really don't see the point of it.

Overall, you may want wait for the sale but don't skip this game if you are a mystery otome fan.

[list]
[*]Around 15 hours of reading.
[*]Likeable and interesting characters.
[*]Great story. No, really.
[*]Beautiful art, beautiful backgrounds, beautiful CGs, but sadly undermined by the game's lower resolution (800x600)
[*]Dialogue font might be a bit small.
[*]Unusual controls. You press the down arrow to advance the text (or click on the text box), and hold it down to skip text (both read and unread). You press the up arrow to ""roll back"" the text, although there are times when it can't do so (can't go back after a transition, choice etc.).
[*]The time-traveling is a story thing, not gameplay, in case you came here hoping for that.
[*]It's also not overtly romantic (Zeiva's games rarely are), so come in with a low romance expectation.
[*]Echoing that it's still a great story regardless of the two points above.
[*]There are puzzles. A lot of them are easy, but some are pretty... tricky? Obscure? What's the word. In any case, [url=zeiva.net/otome/area_x_guide.html]I used the official guide[/url] from the get go so the puzzles never became an obstacle in progressing the story.
[/list]

[b]General tips:[/b]
[list]
[*]On the top of the screen there's that ? button. It brings up a map of the story branches. Every time you make a choice, you progress on it (also other things IIRC, but the choice is the most important one). There's a pattern to the progression and if you take notice of it, you'll be able to tell if you're on your way to the good or bad ending of the route. (Or you can just use the guide.)
[*]So you got the password to access the Extra Gallery? Cool. You don't put it on the base game though, but on the Extra Gallery DLC. It's technically a different game. Different .exe and such. You need to open the game from inside Steam (as in, press that green PLAY button), or you won't get the choice to play the base game or the extra gallery.

Area-X is of the Sci-Fi and Mystery genre with mild romance. More than anything, it focuses around the plot and the main character. There are plenty of comical moments as well though that doesn't mean the game isn't capable of crushing your heart to pieces. Just because it's a good ending doesn't mean it's going to be a happy one.

The game is also connected to X-Note and while it's not necessary to play it, I suggest getting to know a little more about the characters there.

The female protagonist is one of the least uninteresting main character I've ever seen in otome games. She's sassy, cynical, and bit of a sadist who enjoys teasing the hell out of one of her potential love interests. She's a breath of fresh air in otome games filled with dull, ""not particularly skilled but still hardworking"" MCs. That's not to say it's bad if you actually like them- they're just something I frequently see.

When it came to the love interests, it was a surprise for me to find that I don't dislike any of them. Admittedly, I feel that most of the reasons why I like them in the first place is because of their interactions with Elcia. The dynamics between her and her love interest is so good that I can definitely understand why the guys fell in love (or at least implied it) with her.

In terms of UI, I've gotten used to Ren'Py-based visual novels that I found this one that's akin to a flash game is quite inconvenient. Game codes are given out after finishing a route because it doesn't remember the routes you've finished. On the bright side, the entered code does that for you so you can skip the parts you've already read.

The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous. The art style suits the game just right. I may have a small gripe about people's fashion sense in the Future dimension though. 

But despite its drawbacks, I highly recommend playing this game. Sure it didn't have enough romance, but in my opinion the game makes up for it with its story.",1550306841,1550307004,True,5,2,0.568552255630493164,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(Don't let the time fool you I played this before it was on steam) I really should replay all of them though because the characters are just as great as the story it's self. 

I talked about how the art first drew me to X-Note in my other review and the artwork is still amazing but I forgot to mention how much I enjoyed just listening to it as well. This goes for both games in this series I could rewatch the opening sequence over and over just for that alone. 

Now the only thing I could say negatively about the game would be the mini-games I didn't hate them but I didn't care for them either though they didn't frustrate me like X-Note's did so that's a plus. I truely don't think that takes anything away from the story though so whether you do or don't find the mini games to be your cup of tea I recomend you try this game out and if you play through all the routes and have played X-Note the whole thing really ends up being one big interconnected story in a way that I just loved.

Probably one of the best VN's i have played- the gameplay requires some tweaking which was necessary in most Zeiva games, but regardless the game is worth every penny. In this VN, you follow Elcia, a sadistic determined girl who has got a job of retrieving resources by time travelling. You are in an age where humanity cannot live except undeground because of nuclear radiation and the limited resources are being depleted. In the game you can travel to various time periods, meet a lot of interesting characters both from X-note and this game itself and recover elements of your lost past.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story is pretty powerful and philosophical, it gets dark at times and humorous. It picks up various messages in society such as : ""Morality is something created by society"" or ""you survive today to see tomorrow"". Each male character route has an important message to be delivered. Since this is the prequel for X-note, you will eventually see in Rexus's route how the story connects and the titbits around the mysterious main character herself is revealed. All routes need to be explored to fully understand the story without flaws. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
I have played a lot of Zeiva games and had complained that how necessary it would be to have an auto-mode for their VN's. When saving the game, the game save slots does not represent the ""TIME"" of saving which is very annoying. If you have two multiple saves in the same chapter- you won't know which is which. Throughout the game you are presented with interesting puzzles, and sometimes dialogues are very important. It's sometimes vital to check each location multiple times even if there is nothing or even when the character says the same thing. The most interesting part of the gameplay was the choices you have to make to get the good ending- the difficulty is high in that sense. For an example for some characters you should lie and not tell the truth. It all depends on their personality traits. It's also helpful to check the statuses of Elcia since it gives out very important clues. There are many secret endings and easter eggs to be found- and each route (especially Rexus's) can be split into two or three segments. You also require passwords to enter the unlocked routes, which doesn't make sense and you need to keep tab of them. In the sky path, no matter what character you choose there will be easter eggs and a special scenes. After finishing the main route in sky path I believe you will get the password for the bonus content, which is present in a different executable in the file directory for Area-X. The bonus content are very great- i really loved the cute chibi comics. 

[h1]Characters[/h1]
It's been a long time now that VN's have employed weak female characters as the main protagonist. But Area-X, i am happy to say have broken the tradition. Elcia's personality is quite vivid and interesting, she is a sadistic girl who has repressed emotions and is very rebellious. A girl who can stand up for herself as she is a good example for the readers. The other male protagonists too have very interesting personalities, I love all of em except for Belph. The most interesting part of their personalities would be the contrasting opposite elements. For an example the nicest guy can turn psycho, and the most anti-social one can do surprising things. This is not present in most VN's and is a very good way to keep the story interesting. 

[h1]Art and Soundtracks[/h1]
Art is very good but needs polishing of the edges. The soundtracks are also very good just as X-note.

[h1]Overall[h1]

I remember thinking it was mediocre. I also tried to play the Demo for Area-X but I was intimidated by the puzzles and gave up on it. Many years passed since then and I decided to give Area-X another chance and bought it on Steam. 

I have to say that I didn't regret the decision at all. I found the story better than I remembered it from the Demo. I often get bored with the story when I play otome games, but Area-X managed to keep my interest all the way through. The art looks gorgeous and the characters are all quite interesting. I liked the game so much that I even considered buying X-Note again. (I had lost it when my old PC broke)

However, I also had a couple of problems with the game: a)There was not enough romance. The game mostly focuses on the plot. I think it would be better if there were more romantic moments, b) some of the puzzles were way too hard and impossible to solve without a guide. 

Overall, I would recommend this game but maybe it would be preferable if you played X-note first. There are some things in Area-X that you will not understand without having read X-note. I am not saying that it's impossible to enjoy the story if you haven't read X-note, just that you will not be able to get all of the references.",1534730800,1534730800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

****Edit**** 
Playtime: 19.1 hours on a binge from the second it was bought.

I should have added more to this review. I first played Zeiva's games when I was a small kid and encountered the first Other Age on Newgrounds. I couldn't buy anything then but bought this as soon and I had money years later as an adult.

This game's plot and numerous endings are AMAZING and super in-depth. Your choices matter and after unlocking the first few endings completely, they tie into all the other endings with your choice of character. One particular character I did not expect the story line to go the way it did and I BAWLED HARD. It made me so sad, but I was in love!! 

Even with the other character choices who don't seem as important contribute to the main hidden story line that connects with everything. 

This game's plot is like an onion with layers upon layers upon layers.  It still leaves me in awe with how excellent the game was structured.


I have played this game over and over to unlock all the endings and dialogue. Only thing I didn't do was replay each story line with the Sky path. It was just a bit too much for me at the time after binge playing the game so much. I was physically tired, but still loved to play it so much.

This is a very visual novel heavy game with choices. Still to this day in 2021 this game is by far my favorite and I try to replay my favorite path once a year or whenever I want to get a feel for childhood nostalgia.

Overall....Definitely get this game! It is soo worth the money and you will see how hard the developers worked for this game.

[u]X- Note[/u] is developed. You learn better on characters, like after Yuon’s mom death and before Rexus finds Essi. You’ll  discover Dr Loil Corporation’s plan and the consequence..
I bought it to know how lost natural resources would be recovered but there’s another large matter. 
[u]The revelations[/u] increasing in size are a good motive to play, Rexus route is wonderful as it changes the knowledge and it adds another about X-Note. I did Livan then, thought it would be a simple route but what we learn is awesome.
[b]Peculiar humour:[/b] goes against cliches for a good laugh! The ironic humour like the bad boys who were going to harass us are spanked by us. I like Belph sarcasma, making fun of Irina, the sound of his feet as he flees..  Rexus scrutinising look.. Quaint Master is such a clown as he seduces us heavily, when he’s scolded by his wife. His figure’s way on falling on the carpet! 

The analysis of Belph and Yuras is simple. There are Livan and Ferim more complex. 

[b]Characters artwork, a mask for their true self:[/b] 
Once you see his face you’re surprised knowing the importance of his role.
Lady Memme is a shining beauty with sparkling blue eyes and long plump hair. she looks dreadful with her cobra, knowing her current condition :(
Master Pedoe has feminine features like a homosexual (thin eyelashes), when he gets near Elcia, he’s creepy. Mistrust his bourgeois manner.
Ferim ‘s outfit is serious and rigid like his task he must fulfill. It’s a contrast to his young face. Yuras’s brother looks elegant and peaceful rather than a warrior.
Ciera’s indian outfit as she’s calm, her pose is like she bears the world.

Pedoe Manor [b]music[/b] sounds like a brass band, there’s a voiced trumped I like! “Recollection” track in Rexus route goes well with recalling.”Missing Piece” for a dark truth, “human gridlock” for the eerie catastrophe started and “Nostalgia” for Livan’s sadness to shed a tear.
How sad to hear about the witches’ hunt who could be avoided if they were treated better ;)

UNEXPECTED There are things u see unwell at first like: I thought the murderer is against recovering natural resources but no. The true nature of some characters.
Belph’s path puts apart the Project Recovery but we discover a dirty thing. 

In Rexus path, you’ll learn his origin and why he watches over Essi. At his good ending there’s something heartbreaking about Elcia. At the end of the main game, we didn’t recover natural resources, just cut the after effect of it in an ending. [b]How come Oure projected in the Future? What about the Mirage Fountain mystery?

Pros:

-art is fantastic

-If you've played X-note, all your answers can be found here.
-Even w/o playing X-note, you can still play the game as a stand alone.

Cons
-For most, the price will be a hurdle espcially since there are not even voices. However, given the cohesion of the story and amazing writing/story telling, I do not regret paying at full price.
-Lack of romance. There is a MUCH greater focus on the plot. 

+/- not a fluffy otome game. Plot driven with more emotional/ serious undertones. 
+/- has minigames. I honestly wasn't too fond of them since I found most puzzles to be quite difficult and required a walkthough. 

Area-X is one of my favorite otome games and (I know I sound like a broken record) a story that is so well developed, carefully planned, and intriguing that the price is worth it.

The soundtrack definitely improved from the last game, which I was pleased about.

[h1]Structure[/h1]
The artwork and the storyline make an awesome combination, the soundtrack was certainly improved, but I don't feel like it was enough. The ""Options"" menu barely had anything to change, there was no option to change the volume...it was either ON or OFF and there no other ""text"" options. Also, just like X-note, there is only 15 save slots which I feel isn't enough if someone is going to do all the 9 routes.

For £18.99, this VN is over-priced just like the X-note. I would've liked to see the price reduced to at least £10 as it’s too expensive right now...

Overall Verdict: The VN has amazing artwork, a great story and a decent soundtrack going for it, but the lack of options in the ""options"" menu, save slots and the price might be the only aspects keeping this VN down.

PROS:
- TIME TRAVEL!!
- The art for this game, though not perfect, is gorgeous. Not just the CGs and character portraits/sprites, but the backgrounds and animation as well ( I also liked that the main-heroine really gets a costume change for every era she goes to ). while there are some backgrounds in the game that might seem more simple than others, I still give a lot of points to Zeiva because they're definitely not free from stock images which means that they took the time to make everything original, and theirs.
- Really fun, cool, different and spicy heroine to play as (instead of always playing the dense and naive innocent girl)
- I personally love that each character got their own BGM.
- The puzzles are fun and different everytime, also they require some thought.
- There is a lot of characters in this game, all with their own charms.
- fans of X-Note might be happy to hear that there are more than a few familiar faces.

CONS:
- To get back on the topic of the puzzles, I did sometimes find myself guessing more, than finding it out.
- For an otome game, I do find it to lack a bit more of romantic sessions. So I would warn, fellow otome lovers, that buying this game, you will get a story that focuses a bit more on the mystery and character development than romance.

But all in all, I found it to be an awesome game. I had great fun playing it, Elcia (the heroine) made it more interesting and the rest of the Characters just added more spice to the story really. All in all I would rate it something like 9,2? (considering  the few drawbacks I meantioned)",1437528911,1437528911,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each major branch of the storyline is quite different from the others, so players aren't repeating so much of the same story as they play through multiple times. Area-X is definitely a game you will want to play through over and over, as more of the story is unlocked and more of the mystery is unravelled with each different completetion. Really, the game doesn't get started until you complete the first four basic endings, and then there is still a lot left to experience. The replay factor for this game is huge, and grinders who love to take a Visual Novel to its full extent will be fully satisfied by this game.

Elcia is a really strong female protaganist with a bit of a sadistic streak to her. Still, she is able to make connections with the other characters in the game, and some of the endings are super sweet. The game isn't about hooking up with the various characters or even finding true love. Some of the endings are more about making a special connection with a character, and the endings are really rewarding.

The writing for Area-X could be a little better, but as the writers have done a ton of work for this very long game, some players might be willing to accept some of the weaker parts of the story and move on. 

Overall, if you can get past some cheesy writing at a few points and press the ""I believe"" button at a few story elements, this game can be a lot of fun. Hard core VN players who love to experience every scene and ending will be rewarded with Area-X, and those same players should find that they certainly got their money's worth out of this game.",1437092353,1437092353,True,10,3,0.590263783931732178,1,False,False,False,False,,,

It's absoultely stunning; the author and artist should be extremely proud of themselves. 

Firstly, the art is beautiful. The animated eyes can look a little awkward on some characters, but overall everything is drawn in lovely detail; the characters are distinct and the backgrounds are never lazy. Then there's the music, which is sort of techno in style; it suits the game and the mood. Personally, I'd buy the sound-track if I could.

The story is engaging, interesting and well-written. Despite finishing only today, I'm already hungry for more. There's still so much mystery left, so many characters arcs I haven't explored. I felt for the characters. Some of them were very unique - in particular, I appericated Elcia, who isn't the stereotypical, sweet and loving otome protagonist.

Edit: I previously wrote here you cannot skip text, but this isn't true! Holding the down arrow allows you to fly through text. Also, you can press Enter to skip whole segments of the game after you've progressed to a certain point.

I'll also add that ""romances"" in this game are restricted to male/female couples, so no female love interests. In addition, none of the romances get too, well, ""romancy"", if that's what you're looking for. There's no declarations of eternal love, passionate kissing or desperate hugs - the affectionation between Elcia and the boys can be interpretted as romantic, platonic or queerplatonic, which I particularly liked.
