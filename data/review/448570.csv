I'm looking forward to seeing improvements, I think this game definitely has potential.

The story is pretty hard to follow; it's all over the place. I was especially confused about the guy who shows up on the first boss (the first boss you can actually [i]kill[/i]). He comes out of seemingly nowhere, and then he just... vanishes?
I also feel like there's no motivation to really keep playing. Who is Sophie? Who is Mike? Why should we, the players, care about them?

I understand that when you play RPGs like this, you usually start off like that, and good games usually provide more information about the characters and the world around them through dialogue and exploration, but I've been having that same exact feeling even after over an hour of gameplay (most of which is exploring bland, uninteresting mazes). All I can tell you from what I've seen is Mike seems to be a mage and Sophie seems to have some weird demonic entity in her. All characters have very little to no personality, thus I feel no connection to these characters, no emotion, no desire to help these characters get through their stories. Dialogue is very lacking, and I find myself wanting to get it over with rather than wanting to take everything in. Most NPCs have only one line, and some NPCs walk around really fast and are hard to talk to. Pretty much nothing they say is helpful.

The combat is okay. I really like how there's a QTE for some special moves. It keeps you on your toes, it's not too difficult, and you don't lose anything if you fail. It's like many other turn-based RPGs, with an added timed action bar that's not an uncommon system, and a bar that shows when enemies use their turns and when certain characters will be able to use their turn, also not an uncommon system. 

The visuals are mediocre. Most, if not, all, of what you see here is not custom; I've seen the character sprites and artwork before in other games, along with the environment tiles. There's nothing really special to see here. The mazes are kind of annoying to navigate. Dead ends are just frustrating, especially when pretty much everything looks exactly the same.
Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with using what's provided to you from the engine itself, it just makes your game less unique, and it stands out less.
It's also kind of distracting to see character sprites I've seen before, but that's an issue with me rather than with the game itself. It's not even really an issue, it's just kind of weird to experience.
Also Kathi isn't directly behind Mike when you walk up and down, and that bothers me more than it should lmao

Music seems to also be from RPGMaker itself. Nothing much to really say about it. It's okay. It doesn't really get under my skin. But it's pretty generic and forgettable.
The save sound effect is obnoxiously loud.

Proofreading for text is crucial, the random capitalization and poor spelling and grammar are also pretty distracting. I appreciate the mention that there are spelling errors upon startup. I can only hope these errors are fixed in the final version.

Also, Steam achievements are completely broken. I got past the Sand Tower and after saving, closing, and playing as Mike for a bit, the only achievement I've gotten so far is ""Battle Start"". Not sure if this is an issue with the game, with Steam, or both.

I understand that this game is in early access, and that you can try it out right now, but I say wait for this game to get cleaned up a bit more before you try the game out, because in its current state, I don't think it's really worth your time.

Я был наивным дураком. Много месяцев назад я хотел найти игру для создания ролевых игр, которая поразила бы меня. Итак, я искал и искал пар. Путешествовал по MMORPG, благодаря которым в результатах поиска «Бесплатные РПГ» появились.

В конце концов я нашел эту игру.


Мы играли в питьевую игру, и КАЖДЫЙ РАЗ ЭТА ИГРА БЕЗ СМЫСЛА, КТО-ТО ПОПИЛ.

ГЛЮКОЗНЫЙ ПАПА, НЕ МОГ БУДЕТ ИДТИ.

ДАЙТЕ МНЕ ПОДВЕДИТЬ ЭТА ИГРА. ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО БЫСТРО ДЛЯ ЯЛЛА

- Я получил травму от переходов между сценами. У меня никогда не было инсульта (к счастью), но если бы у меня был инсульт, я думаю, что это было бы похоже на темп в этой игре.

- На картах большого масштаба было так много тупиков, что я чувствовал себя пойманным в ловушку лихорадочного сна, от которого никогда не мог проснуться.

- Диалог, это как разговаривать с роботами, только не охлаждает. Мне сказали увидеть «Короля», и вот и все ... Других указаний, кроме этого, не было. Потребовалась коллективная группа, состоящая из более чем 100 человек, чтобы придумать, куда двигаться дальше (этот камень, черт возьми, обманул меня). И знаете что. В конце концов, я не был уверен, заблудился ли я из-за собственного замешательства или игра буквально высасывала мозговые соки из квадрата головы.

- один момент. Я резвился в чудесной пустыне, убивая гигантские ростки, а потом моргал и внезапно оказывался в царстве теней.

- Почему есть девушки-кошки?

- Я мучился весь путь вверх по пустынной башне, чтобы встретить ВОЛШЕБНИКА ВРЕМЕНИ, И Я ДАЖЕ НЕ ДОЛЖЕН ВСТРЕЧАТЬ ВОЛШЕБНИКА ВРЕМЕНИ. ПОЧЕМУ ВЫ БЫЛИ ЭТО СДЕЛАЛИ, ЧТО ТАКОЕ ВОЛШЕБНИК ВРЕМЕНИ, И Я НЕ ДОЛЖЕН ВСТРЕЧАТЬ ЕГО ПОСЛЕ ПРИНЯТИЯ УСИЛИЯ.

- Как король узнал, кто такая Софи, когда единственное, что она сказала, это то, что ее отца похитили? Есть ли в мире явная нехватка отца?

- Почему персонажи появляются и исчезают без причины? Почему бы не сделать постепенное исчезновение, а затем запрограммировать, чтобы последующее покинуло вашу вечеринку, а затем снова исчезло?

- Сюжет БЕЗ СМЫСЛА. КТО ЭТИ ЛЮДИ, ПОЧЕМУ Я ДОЛЖЕН ЗАБОТИТЬСЯ?

- ПОЧЕМУ ИФРИТ ХОТЕЛ БЫТЬ НАШИМ ДРУГОМ? ОТКУДА ОН ПРИБЫЛ? ПОЧЕМУ МЫ СЛУЧАЙНО БЫВАЕМ НАШИМ СОБСТВЕННЫМ СОПРАНИЦАМ?

- ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО, НИКОМУ НЕ МОЖЕТ ВЫЖИТЬ МЕТЕОРНЫЙ ДУШ ВЕЩЕСТВЕННОГО МАГНИТУ, ПОСМОТРЕТЬ НА ДИНОЗАВРОВ

CON:  long loads times but short game?

CON:  short?   author says ""only chapter 1 or so is free, parts of chapter 1 are being redone"" (and in discussions, says if part of one is redone, all save files will be trashed).  (the other parts are higher priced - i'll never buy)

CON:  in discussions says something about ""running a server to allow real-time ""chat and other things"" between the players and author"" - i don't like an idea of an author who thinks it might be legal in usa to ""inject monitoring and who knows what else"" inside the game, and things ""leaving a blurb in a discussion"" might cover his activity.

CON:  too experimental for me.  I don't need ""FREE"" so much that i want to be experimented upon.

I enjoyed it. There’s a lot of potential. All the ingredients for a great game are there, but there are issues. The menu is good, everything you want in a game, A+. The controls, however, feel awkward because we’re using the arrow keys instead of WASD. Even thought I’m right handed I’d still feel more comfortable controlling these characters with my left hand and having dungeon tools (which are a great idea) selected with the arrows. Combat is good but it runs too fast, I feel rushed in a fight which while not a major problem in the early dungeons or battles will become problematic in later battles where we’ll need to strategize and take time to think things through. Perhaps lower combat speed by 10-12% and add a pause button, unless there already was one in which case, I’m an idiot. The enemy random spawn is a classic and works well here. Finally, the biggest problem was the pacing of the opening. *SPOILER WARNINGS BELOW, DO NOT READ IF YOU DON’T WANT IT SPOILED FOR YOU*. So the game starts with Sophie breaking out of her cell and trying to find her brother, and thus I was mentally prepared for anything but being pulled out of that opening quest to fight the “Dark Lord”. Draw it out a bit. Explain somethings to us, the uninformed audience, specifically: “why are we here?”. That doesn’t mean I want you to go overboard with exposition but there it is a little hard to get pulled into the story. Also, maybe instead of the “Dark Lord” we fight his enforcer or lieutenant instead, because it dilutes his impact if we just fight him. Then Sophie wakes up in her house and that’s it, no reaction from her upon doing so as if this is a day that ends in “Y” for her as if the previous events were totally normal. She doesn’t even ask herself “wait, what, was that a dream?” That’s not how you’d react in that situation. Also, I wouldn’t have even known to recruit Jesse if I didn’t know to look in every house after playing so many RPGs, which could be a real problem for newbs. Possibly, it might be beneficial to have her enter Sophie's house and explain stuff to her like “Hey, I found you passed out and brought you to your house, what the hell happened to you?” It would flow better. I’m nit picking I realize, especially for an early access game but I really wanna enjoy it more and I love stories and this one has a lot of potential.

Smooth transition (beginning) story / fighting

Sometimes little lags when using pressing use while walking.
the speed of the turn based system

I like it alot, sadly for me personally there is a gamebreaker.
The Active Battle Time cripples the strategic element.
My advice unless it was intended to be a instant action battle game, 
is too allow the option of choosing between active time and passive time.
Meaning

Active: Time flows wether selecting a command or performing selected command.
Passive: Time pauses when your command screen comes up.

The reason I say this is because it is the reason I don't like Final Fantasy anymore.

But this one is full of typos*, weird combat system, where time is important (because it's not turned based as most RPGMaker games). Of course it has terrible performance because of RPGMaker from time to time.
The story starts in ""boring"" matter for me (apparently people overused ""kidnapping family member"" in RPG games), with that Lazy Guard that just gives you key... 
And sometimes you are moved to location X, not exactly knowing why :/

Another problem is using the same set of music and sounds like many other games... :(

I was a naive fool. Many moons ago, I wanted to find an RPG maker game, that would blow my mind. So I searched, and searched steam. Travesed the mmorpg's that litered the ""Free RPG"" search results.

In the end I found this game.
 

We played a drinking game, that EVERY TIME THIS GAME MADE NO SENSE, SOMEONE TOOK A DRINK.

GLUCOSE DADDY, COULD NOT WALK.

LET ME SUM UP. THIS GAME. REAL QUICK FOR YALL.

- I suffered whiplash from the scene transitions. I've never had a stroke (Thankfully) but If I had a stroke, I think that it would be similar to the pacing in this game.

- There were so many dead ends, on large scale maps, that I felt like I was trapped in a fever dream, to which I could never awaken.

- Dialog, is like talking to robots, except not cools one. I was told to see the ""King"" and then that was it.... There was no other guidance, but that. It took a collective group, of 100+ people to figure out where to go to progress (That rock, bamboozled the heck out of me. ) And you know what. I wasn't sure in the end, if I was getting lost because of my own confusion, or If the game was literally sucking the brain juice from the head square.

- one moment. I would be frollicking in the wonderful wilderness, killing giant brussle sprouts, and then I would blink, and suddenly I was in the shadow realm.

- Why are there cat girls?

- I suffered all the way up the desert tower to meet THE TIME WIZARD, AND I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO MEET THE TIME WIZARD. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE IT, THAT THERE IS A TIME WIZARD, AND I DON'T GET TO MEET HIM, AFTER MAKING THE EFFORT.

- How did the king know who Sophie was, when the only she said, was that her father was kidnapped? Is there a distinct lack of father's in the world?

- Why do characters appear and disapear for no reason? Why not do a fade out, and then program that the follow leaves your party, and then fade back in?

- The plot MADE NO SENSE. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

- WHY DID IFRIT WANT TO BE OUR FRIEND? WHERE DID HE COME FROM? WHY ARE WE RANDOMLY HURTING OUR OWN COMPANIONS IN CUTSCENES?

- FOR REAL THO, NO ONE CAN SURVIVE A METEOR SHOWER OF SUBSTAINTIAL MAGNITUDE, LOOK AT THE DINOSAURS

Woman was the best character in the game.

The menu's were pretty okay.

There is the option of three difficulty settings. Easy, medium and hard. Easy mode is if you just want to breeze through the story with little challenge, medium provides a serious challenge and hard mode is just insanity.
Graphics are your basic rpg maker kind of graphics with sprites that we expect from these games, which is kind of that Snes nostalgia era we all once knew an loved.

Pros:
Art is good for something free
menu is nice

Cons:
Npc moves so fast even the butterfly move faster than the human npc
Dialogue is a bit plain
Story so far has not much depth in it. (shopkeeper just told me i have power inside then gave me a thing to help me control it. not much explanation or any lore given direct to the point.)
The gameplay i didnt like because it is just a spam of spacebar because even if its your turn the battle still goes on so while your're thinking on what skill or what to do during the turn the enemies are killing you already. even at spam they are faster cause it only takes a second for them to do what they want.",1477914014,1477914014,False,3,0,0.505505681037902832,0,False,False,True,False,,,

excellent boss fight, (not sure why but some bosses die much more easily than others, some are just plain hard and takes a long time)
good story line 
a variety of characters to play with ( some are useless, some are just too strong and can do many hit combos)


Cons:
be prepare to die (so save often), most enemies are as strong as you and do alot of damage, sometimes enemies can do major criticals on you, sometimes you meet a rare enemy that  is way to hard for you to kill,

be prepare to save at different points in the game; certain maps have a very hard enemy that it is almost unkillable, and if you save in this map, you will always encounter this enemy in this map and you can't escape it.  (very frustrating to meet these super hard enemies)

encounter the same enemy in the same map every turn. (this make this game very boring cause if you enter a cave that have a rat in it, you will fight this rat all the time in this cave).  So annoyning!

random encounter of enemies in every 5 second is a major pain trying to get from one point to the other.  this is so FRUSTRATING!!!!  everytime i move i encounter an enemy.  There is not way out and you have to fight it.  This game needs an escape button. imagine fighting  a rat every 5 second for 100 times in a cave.

The maps are big in this game. you will loose your way,  this game needs a mini map to show you where you have been so you will not walk in circles.

All the healers and magic users are useless in this game.  They just die way too fast and causing you to use up all your potions.  The spells are very good buy it takes alot of manas to use it like you start out with 180 manas and you summon a fire and causes you 100 manas. After that cast, you must waste a turn and potion yourself, then you can cast it again; and also you have to enter the right combination of codes to use it. If you miss one of the codes you can't use it and skip your turn. The boss's turn come around and you are doom.",1476681897,1476681897,False,2,0,0.513513505458831787,0,False,False,True,False,,,

It has an interesting Storyline
The game areas are farily large and quite pretty
The characters are engaging

The Bad:
Repetitive battle system (e.g - an overload of rats)
Grammar, Capitalization, Punctuation needs work
The npc's move way too fast for a casual player to easily catch and speak to them

Overall:
I like the game, it's been fun to play so far (barring an error that happened in windowed mode). However the text needs a solid edit and new monsters would be a really good addition because after a while rats get really old. The NPC's move a little too fast to easily catch but it isn't such a big deal unless you're stuck fighting battles while chasing down a specific NPC you want to talk to.

We'll approach this lightly, since it's an early access game. It has potential, that's for sure.

Bugs found:
1- Walking to where the guy that teleports, on the forest, originally stands before walking to you and teleporting away, gives a permanent red tone to that forest area  (edit: dev. said it's actually a day/night event, not a bug)
2- The archer doesn't have a diagonal moving sprite. She is invisible while walking diagonally (edit: dev. said it's being worked on).

Tips for the developer:
1- The combat is too frenetic! please make time stop so you can choose calmly your action, when your turn arrives. If that was your intention, however, and wish not to alter that, please make the action meter fill a LOT slower, since the archer, when with high AGI stats, can get enought action points to act in merely 0.5 or so seconds. (edit: dev. said that's how the battle system will work, but the ideal AGI for the monsters is still being worked on)
2- The story. You plan on writing more, right? And while by writing more i mean, too, make the story bigger, i also mean writing more phrases and stories on the part you've already made.  Another thing: all characters are very succinct, they have the same personality whatsoever, making it seem they were all created by the same person. It feels you're always hearing the same person's phrases, even with the different character portraits. Give your characters more personallity! (edit: dev. said more story is coming!)
3- (edit - the fix for this one is incoming!) That 999999 health boss. Seariously... i spent 20 minutes in that fight, wasting almost all my items, so it could confuse all my characters so they killed each other, and THEN discovered that losing that battle was on the script. If you want to make a boss fight that is intended to lose, don't make us waste all our items on it. Make it even harder so we can notice our win isn't intended, please. It made me VERY angry, and certainly others as well 
4- It's obvious that that time to save/load is artificially put there. Please remove it. It's annoying. (edit: the time will be lowered! Thanks, dev.! <3)
5- I played only on hard, and the encounter rate made me literally sick. Almost gave up on the game a lot of times because of it. The ideal would make something like Millenium 1, in which you could move ""stealthy"" (less encounter rate) or intentionally attracting enemies. If not possible, please, make it 1/3 the actual encounter rate. (edit: dev. is working on it)
6- Warn us better when proceeding through a point that has no turning back to the previous area. Preferrably a guard saying something on the lines that, if you procced, it won't let you turn back, or something more creative, when you try to proceed (edit: dev stated that there will be no problem, since those areas will become available again as the story progresses).
7- The autosave feature overwrites your last save? Oh no, please. Make it always save on slot 0 or something, or even better: remove it. We are big boys/girls, we know we have to save on RPGs ;) (edit: it's actually a bug, it's intended to always save on slot 2. dev. is working on it)

While this review was originally inclined for not recommending, seeing a response from the developer gives hope the game will get the attention it needs. This game is fun, but is a bit too short and needs more work on.

What you normally do (in my opinion) is you make mobs a specific level in every zone, so your character actually feels strong or weak. 

If you're wondering how to do that without creating hundreds of mobs, just do what other old JRPG used to do and just change the color and name of the mob and add level to it.

Chapter 1 review only, some suggestions:

Visuals-
Character models and sprites appear very nice, and areas remind me of some RPGs I enjoyed on the SNES. The character pictures accompanying the dialog do not match the mood for the situation, specifically when Sophie opens the gate initially, as the picture is of what appers to be extreme joy for a situation that would generally call for concern. The second time this was noticed was when Mark approached Sophie from behind, and Sophie seemed to be pleased with this encounter instead of shocked or startled.

Dialog-
There are three spelling errors in the first chapter:
wounder - wonder
enery - energy
what they doing - they're or they are

Sophie's discussion with her dad, Mark, is lacking depth. It seems like she's not too worried about the situation. The line ""Dad..."" when she is told to just go home doesn't evoke much from Sophie's character, and makes it appear that her brother will just have to deal. This makes the opening feel a little washed out as I too did not care what happened to her brother.

Audio-
The Demonic growl when showing the controls is unsettling and a bit loud. Maybe a more gentle sound or no sound effect here would benefit. 

Opening song is repetitive and does not strike me as audio I would like to hear with an opening game or sequence. Granted, this is only title screen music, and I'll give credit for that.

The second room past the guard with the enemies that give chase has some extremely loud sounds to accompany being found. Recommend lowering the volume for these.

Card game music is super intense. Would be better suited for actual fighting. Card game music should be something slightly softer and moody, but light. 

Controls:
Arrow keys fit the style, and are intuitive. Controls screen does not give a thorough idea of the controls, including the A button requirement for the first guard to activate for a game of cards. 

In-game option for audio settings would be nice, but manageable with Windows mixer, albeit all game sounds are lowered at this point.

Gameplay:
Card game is a nice touch. It's different than the standard expectations most card games have had, giving a puzzle like feel to the game itself. 

The opening of the card packs is cumbersome, having to open the menu each time a new pack is to be opened. I suggest modifying this to remain in the menu until exited with the Cancel button.

Combat:
I did play through a few minutes of the second chapter, and the combat felt intuitive, like most turn based RPGs.

Overall:
I want to like this game, but the story and characters lack depth. I found myself not wanting to care about the characters or their plight to save themselves, or the world, or whatever was happening. Maybe spend a little more time on story and chacter development. I also do not like the idea of this opening sequence and first card game considered as a chapter, as the game's content has barely even been hashed out. I definitely do not like the idea that the second chapter would be considered a DLC. To play through in a handful of minutes would not be worth the possible dollar the single chapter might launch for. If you are seeking an option for DLC, maybe implement a separate story arc for Sophie's friends, or her father, or maybe a skin swap or something. 

I understand the game lacks polish as this is an alpha freeware game. Clean up the base mistakes and add some content to the opening. Really give something that will hook the player. This would warrant a chapter based DLC, like most games that employ this strategy (see anything from TellTale Games). Fix the audio levels and clean up the controls screen, and this may become something completely different. For now, I'm gonna have to go with a NO recommendation. Not because of game breaking bugs, but simple mistakes and a total loss of interest.

The plot itself is rushed and not very interesting in its current state, as it feels more like a summary or recap of a story rather than an actual story.

No comment on the gameplay. It's an RPGmaker game, so gameplay is pretty much exactly what I expected.
