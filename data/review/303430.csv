This is such a fun little game. If you enjoy cheesy cutscenes with deliberately bad acting, a game that does their best to be as bonkers as possible, and a ridiculous story, this is the game for you. The mechanics of the game are simple; you're a limousine driver that spins around. No seriously, you spin around 360 degrees constantly. You need to maneuver your way through a ton of short (3-8 minutes long) story-based missions, while running over passengers, traffic cones and avoiding cars. It can be frustrating at times, but after a while you can get really into it.

I strongly recommend playing with a controller. During my first playthrough several years ago (probably 2015?), I stopped after 2 hours, and I think I would've played the last hour of the story if I had a controller because it was so much easier to navigate through everything. The cutscenes is what makes this game so enjoyable. The acting is bad, and it's supposed to be. The costumes are cheap, because they're supposed to be. Georgio doesn't talk, because she's Georgio and she shouldn't talk. The entire game gives off a sleazy '70s vibe and it feels very natural and humorous. 

The story is pretty insane as well. I don't wanna go into it, because I don't want to spoil it for y'all, but there are some twists and turns (ha!) and some pretty weird sh-t happening. And that's what makes this game great!

And let's not forget about the customizability. You have hats, different colors and different horns for your limousine. On top of that, you have several different upgrades for your limousine that you're able to switch freely. Wanna slow down time to squeeze through a tight gap more accurately? Go for it. Wanna double-jump? Be my guest. Rotate (ha) freely between spinning clockwise and counter-clockwise? Why not! And there's plenty of customizability and upgrades to unlock post-story as well. I finished the story-mode and I've only finished the game 26% - there's still a ton to discover, and plenty of challenges to try out if I feel daring enough.

An absolutely excellent game that is truly underrated.

Gameplay wise it's kind of puzzle-esque because you're always spinning in a limo you need to think about how to fit through places. 

There are some issues/annoyances with this game though. Personally at first I powered through most of the game but the more I progressed the more I found myself running out of patience with the game.
- You do die quite easily and that's mainly because you can get stuck between obstacles and basically chain hits until your vehicle explodes (A little funny at times with the noises). 
- When you respawn some locations are prone to adding a hit to your vehicle right off the bat. - The hit detection with sloped terrain causing you to take hits which can absolutely ruin a run you're doing (eg. You can get onto carousel tops but the shape of them can cause to you get hit...).
- Some times the respawn points are super far (Even though you're closer to one - These aren't always the wrench locations) so this leads to more backtracking than you need.
- There is an ""item finder"" which may be considered a spoiler but it seems to not work properly. It also gives off ""false positives"" which pings in areas just once and you cannot replicate it again so you're left wondering if there truly is an item nearby which completely makes you lose faith in using it at all...",1674352339,1676905086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

E, por incrível que pareça, os controles são bem fáceis, é só você ter que aprender a lidar com uma limousine em constante rotação e saber bem o que é esquerda e direita/horário e anti-horário (que não é o meu caso).

Pros:
- Fun theme of 70s art and quality, in many aspects.
- Decent open world map, with lots of variety and collectibles.
- Unique gameplay design that can be challenging to learn, let alone master, but can feel very rewarding when you beat the challenges.
- Plenty of customization, from horns, paints, hats, and powers.
- Fun story of awkward cutscenes and acting, that while doesn't always hit, is a respectable attempt at FMV silliness.

Cons:
- VERY awkward feeling controls at times. Many times, you will find yourself in a situation where it's too late to fix your mistake, and will suffer multiple hits straight to death in seconds.
- Poorly designed respawns. In open world, you often respawn far away from where you died. In missions, you often respawn very close to where you died, instead of at checkpoints. This should be the opposite.
- Pricing of things, from customization to property, is very uneven. Some things are more expensive than others to unlock, and it's unclear why sometimes.
- No idea why the Passengers only have a black background for their windows. Maybe it's to add to the intentionally cheap look, but it just hurts the scene.

Ich weiß nicht, was es mit diesen Spielen auf sich hat, die echte Schauspieler für ihre Zwischenszenen nutzen, aber trotz des trashigen Settings will man wie bei einer Sitcom immer weiterschauen.

Roundabout hat zurecht so hohe Wertungen. Eine riesige Limousine, die sich nur drehend bewegt? Kleine Hindernisse wie ""Menschen"" einfach ummäht, aber bei Größeren wie Häusern oder Bäumen Schaden nimmt und explodiert? WTF! Es ist einfach nur super-lustig. Ich bin in den 3 Stunden sicher hunderte Male ""gestorben"" und musste jedes Mal dabei lachen, das Spiel ist so gaga, dass man gar nicht auf Leveldesign oder Schwierigkeitsgrad sauer sein kann.

Interessiert hat mich dabei nur die ""Story"", die eigentlich gar nicht existiert, einfach wegen den Schauspielern. Deswegen auch ""nur"" 3 Stunden, bis es leider wieder vorbei war. Wer Lust auf das Gamedesign hat, kann sicher noch viel länger die Welt erkunden und versuchen alles dort zu finden.

Fazit: Roundabout ist Trash, aber die Sorte von Trash, die wir zurecht als Kunst bezeichnen. Klare Empfehlung!",1648987175,1648987175,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some parts are worth more points than others, that is just personal preference to me as it’s just what I prioritize more when it comes to games.  I’m definitely a “Gameplay > Graphics” guy, so that’ll show in these articles.  Let’s hop in.

Spoiler-Free Synopsis: In the game Roundabout, you play as Georgio Manos, a truly silent protagonist who communicates purely through facial expression.  She also runs the world’s first rotating limousine service.  You spend the game driving customers around town which includes, game proclaimed, “‘70s B-Movie Full Motion Video” cutscenes.  Work your way through three different areas of the city of Roundabout and establish yourself as the best rotating limousine service in the world!

Graphics: 9/10.  The graphics look great.  The world is very colorful, the cutscenes (as mentioned earlier) as FMV cutscenes that take place entirely in your limousine, with the rare cutscene that involves B-movie flair of “person talks in front of green screen”.   

Controls: 9/10.  The controls are actually very fair.  The car drives very smoothly, the power ups that you unlock as you play all activate as they should, the ability to change direction is smooth.  Anytime that I failed something, I never felt cheated by the game, it just felt that I made a mistake myself.  There’s really only one thing I didn’t like and it came in one of the final missions of the game so I will keep it off here for the sake of spoiler.

Gameplay: 25/30.  Gameplay is streamlined, but that’s ok in this case.  You drive to a mission point, pick up someone, drive them somewhere, maybe do a side task or two, and then drop them off.  Your next mission is then usually right next to you after that.  There are lots of things that block your path, whether it be cars backing up and going forward in the middle of the street, cars going around in… roundabouts… and even rock sculptures that CONVENIENTLY are just close enough to each other that you just barely can’t fit between them at every angle and you have to slide through while spinning.  You will eventually unlock the ability to jump, which opens up a lot of potential shortcuts or secrets that you can collect, but then you also realize that this sculpture you’re trying to get past is just low enough that if you’re jumping, you’ll hit it.  Your car blows up after it hits a few things and you’ll get sent back to either the last checkpoint if you’re on a mission (which are pretty generous) or the closest repair shop if you’re not on a mission.  

Story/Characters: 30/30.  I LOVE the story of Roundabout, and not because it’s a story worthy of an Oscar or some sort of award, but because it doesn’t take itself seriously at all.  Some characters are just common stereotypes like Disco Sylvain, or a Canadian Tourist who you know he’s Canadian because he’s waving a miniature flag of Canada all the time and says “Eh?” a lot.  But it’s not a form of offensive stereotyping, it’s just poking fun.  Georgio herself is one of my favorite parts of the game.  As I said earlier, she is a true silent protagonist, she never says a single word throughout the game.  Most of her “dialogue” is her just turning her head to the person who just got in her car, or pointing at something, or facial expressions.  Story is very easy to follow, but you still get invested in making this limo company the best.  I want to go more into characters, but it’s just something that’s better experienced in the game itself.

Replayability: 17/20.  I’m gonna be honest with you, despite this review series being about games I’ve never played before, I have played Roundabout before back at the end of 2020.  Coming back to it a little over a year later, I love it just as much as I did then.  It’s a story that I can watch again and again and still get a kick out of everything involved.  There’s also a variety of minigames you can play, or if you really want to test your skills, you can play the “Esports Speedrunning Challenge”, which skips all the cutscenes and you just go from checkpoint to checkpoint completing the entire game in one go.  My personal best is 31 minutes, 5 seconds.

Total Score: 90/100.  Roundabout is one of my favorite games I’ve played recently.  I know I spent a lot of time gushing about the characters, but the characters are what make this game what it is, in my opinion.  It’s incredibly charming, and a single playthrough only takes about 3-4 hours.  It’s a great way to spend a few hours that you don’t know what to do with for a reasonable price point of $10.",1646532310,1646532310,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Kurukuru Kururin is a series of 3 GameBoy Advance/GameCube games (none of which were released in North America and 2 of which were Japan-only) where you control a constantly-rotating bar and need to avoid making contact with walls and obstacles. They are colorful and charming games that are a lot of fun to play while also being quite challenging. While the presentation of Roundabout and Kururu Kururin could not be more different, the fundamental mechanic is the same and, because of that, I had fun with Roundabout. It's satisfying to deftly weave your way around around obstacles and barely squeeze through tight spaces.

Instead of offering a series of discrete stage like Kurukuru Kururin, Roundabout has elected to take place in an open-world environment. Playing as Giorgio Manos, chauffeur of a rotating limo service, it is your job to pick up a variety of passengers and bring them to their destinations. These missions are delivered via FMV sequences that are intentionally very cheesy, so depending on your tolerance for bad acting and cheap effects, you might find them charming or insufferable. For whatever reason Giorgio is a silent protagonist who never speaks and communicates through facial expressions, which would be fine except that none of her expressions seem to match the scenario she's responding to. I actually found it kind of off-putting after a while. The plot is incredibly silly and definitely not intended to be taken seriously, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel the writing didn't need to be this lazy. Beth (one of your first passengers) falls in love with you immediately for no real reason, and it's implied that Girgio reciprocates her feelings even though this is never really communicated. Several of the characters are simply stereotypes that are completely uninteresting. Luckily, you can skip the video sequences and just stick to the game proper if you prefer.

Most of the missions are simply to go from point A to point B. You are also given optional tasks that are assigned for every mission (collect all stars, reach the goal within X time, reach the goal without colliding with anything, etc). While you can maneuver with the analog stick alone, you can also hold the R trigger to move your car faster or the L trigger (I think) to slow down time. The speed boost is necessary for the most challenging time limits, but I decided early on it wasn't worth the effort to re-play missions several times in order to accomplish all the tasks. Oh, and you also eventually gain the ability to jump, an interesting mechanic that changes how you approach maneuvering. There are also a series of challenge stages that don't revolve around reaching a destination but are timed score challenges that involve doing things like running over as many people as possible or bouncing a soccer ball off the hood of your car. These are designed to be competitive (you are shown the leaderboards and compared to people on your friends' list) but I didn't feel compelled to play any of them more than a couple of times. There are also plenty of collectibles scattered about, giving you some reason to explore. You can find cash stashes and use your money to buy properties that you can periodically return to to collect income from. This money can then be used to buy cosmetics for your car like paint jobs or objects on the roof.

Unfortunately, the camera angle and iffy hit detection make it a bit difficult to tell when you're going to hit something. Worse, it's sometimes easy to get stun-locked and explode before you even have a chance to react. There's no real penalty for dying, though, so you're free to try as many times as you need to get past tricky areas. There is an odd bug I encountered where re-spawing on top of buildings sometimes causes you to explode instantly, contributing to the impression that this game could have used a little more polish. It's not as clean and precise as Kurukuru Kururin, but I do appreciate the unique take on the ""rotating bar"" genre even if the presentation left a little to be desired.

So if you've ever enjoyed Kurukuru Kururin or if the idea of manipulating a rotating limousine through obstacle courses sounds appealing to you, you might enjoy Roundabout.",1633364286,1633364286,True,3,0,0.561752974987030029,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Roundabout reminds me a lot of what happened when Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez released Grindhouse in 2007. It renewed interest in old school exploitation films and for a brief moment there, a lot of movies were greenlit that followed the same style and tone.

A few years ago, full motion video or FMV games also celebrated a resurgence, after mostly being considered dead for over a decade. I don’t know how many people are familiar with early examples of games that used live-action bits in lieu of pre-rendered or in-game cutscenes, but there used to be a time in the 90’s when a lot of games were billed more as interactive movies. Stuff like Wing Commander, Phantasmagoria, Night Trap, Ripper and the Tex Murphy games spring to mind.

Roundabout is one of those games that came out during this initial FMV resurgence. And I feel that it falls in exactly the same trap as many FMV games from the 90s did: The live-action movie segments are entirely separate from the gameplay that happens in-between and only treated as exposition.

During gameplay, you’re in control of a limousine and your job is to pick up passengers and deliver them to their intended destination. So far so Crazy Taxi. The only difference is that your Limousine constantly spins in a circle, so it’s less of a driving game and more about finding ways to steer your constantly rotating vehicle without bumping into anything else on the way. 

I have to say I’m not the biggest fan of the gameplay. Not because it’s bad, but because it’s so basic. There are a few upgrades you can install that change up the formula a bit, but by and large the challenge remains with avoiding obstacles. But even if you do collide with objects, it’s hardly that much of a setback, so you can basically brute force your way through anything the game can throw at you. Sure, if you’re intent on achieving 100% completion, you’ll probably end up replaying most of the missions and are basically required to beat every mission without failing, but these days, I’m really not inclined to force myself to achieve a perfect score and would rather want a game to be designed in such a way that inherently requires a certain amount of skill to beat.

Then again, most people aren’t here for the gameplay, they’re here for the hilarious FMV sequences. Can you tell that I’m being sarcastic? Now I absolutely love cheesy B-movies. But one thing that’s really important to me when I watch schlock is that it has to be something that wasn’t purposely made to be schlock. There are very few exceptions to this rule like Black Dynamite, which is less of a “me too” attempt at making schlock and more of a love letter to blaxploitation cinema. But by and large I can’t stand modern stuff that wants to imitate legitimately bad movies from the 70s and 80s. 

And this is something that many are probably going to disagree with me over. Remember Kung Fury from a few years ago? Yeah, I absolutely can’t stand that movie. And the reason is that the filmmakers are in on the joke. They saw all those terrible movies from the 80s that mashed genres together, had ridiculous characters and nonsensical plots and thought to themselves “I’m going to do exactly the same thing, only I’m being ironic and over the top about it”. And that’s simply not how camp works. You can’t force campiness, especially not if you’re doing it to be ironic. It has to come from a sincere attempt at creating something artistic and failing somewhere. Miami Connection isn’t a great example of schlock because it’s full of terrible dialogue, wooden acting and gloriously cheesy music. It’s great because all of that was intended to make a good film. Kung Fury wasn’t meant to be a good film. It was meant to be a pastiche. It was intended to make its audience point at it and say “look at how ridiculous this is”, hoping that the audience doesn’t notice that it was purposely made to evoke this kind of reaction.

Now the reason I bring this up is because the FMV sequences in Roundabout fall in exactly the same territory as Kung Fury. Sure, all the acting is terrible, all the characters are quirky one-note jokes but that’s the point. The schlock-value isn’t something that happened by accident, it was a deliberate attempt at aping bad 70s cinema and it just falls flat from beginning to end. Remember, intentionally bad is still bad, only without the guilty pleasure to act as a saving grace. There’s a very fine line to walk here and if you don’t manage to pull it off all the way through, it just comes off as being insincere. Death Proof was a film that tried to ape bad 80’s serial killer movies that padded out their runtime with terrible dialogue. But Death Proof’s padded dialogue was written by Quentin Tarantino, so even the quote unquote boring dialogue is engaging to watch and that’s why it works, that’s why Death Proof is still a great movie. Roundabout by contrast has non sequitur after non sequitur delivered by quirky character after quirky character and it just doesn’t want to create a holistic picture or be taken seriously on any level.

And like I said, the narrative and gameplay simply don’t integrate with each other. You could strip out all the cutscenes and the gameplay would still work just as well on its own. Conversely, you could’ve made this into a 70 minute movie and the FMV portion wouldn’t lose anything either. So unfortunately, I really can’t recommend Roundabout.",1632049361,1632049361,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are so many damn things I like about this game. It's quirky, has great characters, a unique concept, and hundreds of collectables. Surely, a game after my heart.

You play as Georgio, the world's first revolving limousine driver, a concept as impractical as it sounds. Surprisingly, the set-up is quite easy to adapt to, and you'll soon find yourself cruising down the street, dodging an onslaught of obstacles and mowing down hordes of pedestrians.

In places, it falls a bit short. There's no real challenge in the game. Sure, you have the [i]option[/i] to get 100% on every mission, but I found that even a really shoddy run where I exploded my limousine several times was enough to earn me a rating of around 65%, seeing as the mere completion of a level accounts for most of your score. There are irritating glitches, such as a persistent respawn glitch that causes your limousine to take damage upon spawning. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that most levels have a ""don't take any damage"" bonus, which can often be immediately negated upon restarting a mission.

Gripes aside, this is a really well put together title with a lot of personality to it. It doesn't overstay its welcome, leaving you feeling like you've just had enough by the time that the credits roll.

Казалось бы, что ещё можно выжать из такой идеи, как развоз людей на такси? А как вам такое: транспортом у нас является длинный лимузин, который... непрерывно вращается вокруг своей оси! И при неаккуратном вождении сбивает ящики, заборы, людей, а потом и сам взрывается, получив достаточно повреждений. ""Что это за трэш?"" - спросите вы. Но это не трэш, это комедия! Второсортная комедия в стиле семидесятых годов с живыми(!) актёрами.
Привыкнув к необычному геймплею и необычной же стилистике, мы попадаем в открытый мир, состоящий из трёх городов, где на вращающейся технике обслуживаем разнообразных пассажиров. Дети не успевают в школу, тренер бейсбольной команды - на площадку, священник - на службу, а шведский турист в качестве пункта назначения называет ""sockergris"". Понять, что он имеет ввиду, у сидящей за рулём Джорджио Манос получается не с первого раза. ""Sockergris? Saw cow gris?"" ""Отвези его уж куда нибудь"" - гласит в конце концов панель текущего задания. И таких ситуаций немало, канадские разработчики не постеснялись обстебать даже самих себя - канадцев.
Извозом дело не ограничивается. Правда, другие задания нам попадаются нечасто, но зато в этот момент фантазия у разработчиков не ограничивается ничем. И в футбол играем, и гробы в могилы скидываем, и урожай на ферме собираем, и даже от падающих с неба машин спасаемся. А под воздействием кое-каких конфеток Джорджио встречается с живым скелетом и отправляется кататься по морскому дну, а потом ещё и охоту за отдыхающими на пляже устраивает.

В общем, веселья полные штаны. Первый час. Но вскоре эффект оригинальности сходит на нет, и взору открываются минусы, убивающие весь фан. Первое, с чем сталкиваешься - с однообразием. Все эти фермы и футболы встречаются редко, в основном же задания - обычное ""езжай туда, потом туда, и наконец туда, и по пути преодолей одни и те же препятствия из мешающих автомобилей или бетонных ограничителей"". Редко когда приходится прыгать по крышам (да-да, мы и такому научимся) или уворачиваться от погрузочной техники в порту, в основном - всё одно и то же.
Второе, что раздражает чем дальше, тем сильнее - перемещение по городу. Проклятый лимузин даже в этом режиме не перестаёт вращаться, так что поездка до очередного задания сама по себе становится заданием. С той разницей, что в свободном режиме после очередного взрыва мы восстанавливаемся не на последней контрольной точке, а не пойми где. В итоге, некоторые задания не просто выполнить, а ПОЛУЧИТЬ выходит только с десятых попыток. Это расстраивает.
Третий минус - продолжительность компании. Если уж вы решили проследить за глуповатой, но более-менее забавной истории Джорджио, то будьте готовы узнать о развязке через несколько часов. Иным высокоскилловым игрокам и часа(!) хватит.
Зато после прохождения у нас останется возможность покататься по здешнему миру и повыполнять задания, поискать спрятанные в кустах деньги, пособирать интересные звуки гудка, банально подавить педестриан... Но тут, как контрольный выстрел, нас ожидает очередной минус. Всего. Этого. В. Игре. ОЧЕНЬ. Много! На карте показывается только доступная для покупки недвижимость (за сдачи её в аренду можно заработать денег), а деньги, гудки и просто синие отметки, нужные лишь для соответствующей ачивки, ищите сами где хотите. Поскольку даже простое перемещение по городу - уже сложность, энтузиазм от поиска спрятанных предметов быстро улетучивается. Не легче дело обстоит и с выполнением заданий: чтобы исполнить его на сто процентов, нам нужно соблюсти кучу условий. ""Пройди за такое-то время, пройди, не взорвавшись, пройдя и собери все монетки, что встретятся по пути, пройди, не пользуясь бустером, пройди ничего не задев, пройди без прыжков..."" Не за раз, конечно, нужно всё это делать, но в итоге выходит, что одно и то же задание для стопроцентного результата следует пройти с десяток раз. А потом все остальные так же. Надо ли говорить, что это не очень интересно?
Про ачивки тоже скажу. Среди них встречаются такие неадекватные, что словами не описать. Жёсткие требования выполнения тех или иных челленджей - это ещё можно стерпеть, но, скажем, ""посигналь 1000 раз"" в игре, где сигналка вообще не используется - это зачем? А ""сделай 53596 оборотов лимузина""? В спокойном состоянии на один оборот требуется около 4 секунд. Простые арифметические вычисления дают в итоге около ШЕСТИДЕСЯТИ ЧАСОВ для получения достижения. Зачем это??? Но всех переплюнула ачивка ""Smoke & Mirrors"". Даже писать о ей не буду, вы мне не поверите, что такое могло прийти в голову адекватным людям. Почитайте в руководстве сами.

Что же в итоге? Очень печальный вывод: у игры есть демо-версия, и лучше бы вам поиграть в неё. Пойдите несколько заданий, проникнитесь весёлой атмосферой, познакомьтесь с оригинальной игровой механикой. А полную версию лучше не берите.

Georgia Manos es el personaje principal y tiene un problema o habilidad como lo quieras ver y es que solo puede manejar girando en círculos con la limusina, así que básicamente deberemos  transportar a nuestros pasajeros esquivando obstáculos y evitando explotar para llegar a nuestro destino. La historia en sí es graciosa y algo confusa pero tiene de todo un poco, romance, drogas, persecuciones policiales y un esqueleto parlante. 
La música del juego es agradable pero al no tener variedad a la larga llega a cansar y el otro punto negativo es que si realmente quieres completar el juego al 100% te encontraras con unos cuantos achievements que a mi parecer son bastante ridículos.

In other words, a game made on a ridiculous premise and exploring gameplay based around the concept. In the case of Roundabout, take a limo that can only do donuts and try to get from point A to point B as fast as possible without dying. 

Gameplay wise, I very much enjoy it. You can replay any mission an infinite amount of times with whatever abilities you unlock later in the game. Every mission has objectives that cannot realistically be done in one playthrough of the mission. Thankfully you can do a run through focused on completing only one task on the checklist. For example, collecting all of the collectible star coins in the mission. The game remembers which collectibles you had already collected through your sunsequent playthroughs so you can focus on only collecting the coins you have missing. The game has both friends list and global ranking systems with friends list being used for all activities and global only being used on challenges (which are repeatable with no real point other than to flex among your friends and the player base). 

There are however some issues with the game. If your limo dies and the previous checkpoint was on top of a building, you will die again as the limo gets respawned inside the building rather than on top. Further complicating things is that there is no way for players to know how much money they have while driving unless they drive over a purchasable property or collect a hidden money stash. The game also does not tell you how many star coins you have left to find when doing another runthrough of a mission only getting an update when you run over a new star coin. Another bug I found was that sometimes when you respawn your car starts off in a damaged state (you can take damage 4 times before dying on a fifth hit) which ruins any flawless or time trial attempts.

Quick score: 4/5

Notes: Great game, suprised this isn't much more popular on steam. The cutscenes/acting are extremely stupid but they made me laugh/smile almost every time. And the gameplay is extremely fun and smooth. Offers a ton of fairly difficult optional challenges and collectibles for you to go for once you have played through the story.


Couple noteworthy negatives 

#1 The jumping ability kind of breaks the challenge and fundamental flow of the game once you unlock it IMO. Once you unlock the jump ability it trivializes alot of the challenges and obstacles, not completely, but significantly. Would have preffered if it was implemented slightly differently, or that there were jump pads or something, rather than just a player input with no cooldown.

#2 IMO there shouldn't have been respawning enabled during missions. The missions are all incredibly short as is and the game could have used an overall difficulty boost, disabling respawning would have done this fine. (It also doesn't make much sense in terms of the story, having you and the passenger die and respawn like nothing happened lol)",1596493977,1616949092,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game was, surprisingly, a lot of fun.  The whole perpetually spinning car concept was awkward AF to start.  So much so that after wrestling with it for 10-15 minutes, I thought “F@ck this stupid sh!t“ and was about to quit and uninstall the game.  I gave it another few minutes... and then the whole thing clicked.  Once I got the hang of how the controls worked, I played through the whole game in one sitting, which is incredibly rare for me.

I did think the game ended rather abruptly; it all was over in about 3 hours.  Plus the story really goes nowhere.  But I’ll be damned if this game wasn’t a memorable one - I’ll definitely remember this game for years to come.  It really is a unique experience and the gameplay is more polished than it appears.

Roundabout講敘一名叫Georgio Manos的無口司機，憑藉著瘋狂的旋轉開車技術，所發生的故事，在路途上，Georgio會碰上許多古怪的乘客，還會遇到許多詼諧有趣的鬧事。 當初我是在商店頁面看到Roundabout的影片，當初看影片裡旋轉禮車就覺得很有趣，然後就買了，玩了後才知道這遊戲「不簡單」，所謂的「不簡單」就是遊戲裡障礙物很多，旋轉禮車一個不小心就會出車禍，出車禍就是喜劇片常出現的爆炸，而Roundabout是一款喜劇遊戲，當玩家被剛才的障礙物爆炸搞得很火大時，Roundabout就會推出許多搞笑內容來化解玩家的怒火，讓玩家心情再次變好，筆者在遊玩時，雖然常被遊戲裡賭爛的出生點和障礙物搞到心情不好，在總期望趕快過關來看接下來的驚喜，而驚喜呢，像是天降飛車、車踢足球等，多樣的內容讓人感到滿意，除此之外，遊戲裡充滿著過場動畫，以真人真景來拍攝，過場動畫充滿誇張形式來演出，不過有幾個角色的表演過於單調，讓人記不起來，但仍然不影響遊戲體驗。  遊戲車輛也有客製化和特異功能，你可以使用放慢動作，也可以使用潛水功能，也可讓車子跳起來，再加上車子的外觀改造，可以換噴漆外，最特殊的，是可以讓車子帶帽子，到帽子這方面讓人快笑死，這款遊戲是一款讓人滿意的小品遊戲，唯一的缺點是在任務時車子出生點容易卡點，導致車子爆炸，這點讓人感到不滿。其餘都沒有問題，是款可以輕鬆搞笑的小品遊戲。

I just played this game. It has some interesting mechanics, as you drive, but not in the traditional way. Your a limo driver that does one thing..spin, spin, and spin...It is a very interesting play mechanic. It also features live scenes. Anyways, here is my Pro's and Con's:

PROS:

-A interesting mechanic in a driving game, revolving and spinning driving. This actually takes some puzzle elements into the game too so you can fit into certain spots in the game.

-Live Action scenes. There are live movies which are voiced and acted out. The acting in some scenes is very funny. I laughed at a couple of them. This game does not take itself serious either..so that adds to the humour.

-Replay to collect collectables around the map.

-Different modes of play (some open after beating game).


CONS:

- The spinning driving might be not everyone's favorite game . 

- The voice acting is well..not that great, but it does add to game to make it funny.

-Some of the achievements are extremely time sensitive..and seem very long to me. For example, there is one achievement where you need to play for 8 hours to get it? That is a long time to get a achievement...

For all it's sillyness, i want to recommend this game. I think this game is more like a 1970's B movie..at least it feels like that to me. Anyways, it is a silly game with funny live action scenes. The game itself is solid. The strange roatating mechanic is even interesting.

ちょっと残念なのが、プレイ前に操作方法の説明がなく、カスタマイズもできないこと。基本的な操作は直感的で、説明が無くてもすぐにわかります。しかし、右アナログスティックでカメラの寄りを変更できることをクリア後しばらくしてから気付きました。また、右トリガーの高速回転(そこからの大ジャンプ)も、中盤、2つ目のマップになって説明されます。それを知らず、1つ目のマップで取れない収集物を前に何回も大破爆散したのは私だけではないはず、、、

A fun little game with a decent premise in which terrible acting and a nonsense plot actually work in its favour.

TLDR: Inept game design. Gimmick gone wrong. Avoid. Hotspot to Hotspot quest grind oriented driving game with clumsy on purpose controls. 

While the menus and minimap work decently the game still uses a driving style camera. The core gameplay is more akin to clumsy tube runner. The problem is that the camera does not really give you proper perspective on what you are trying to achieve. Furthermore, the design and layout of the map is usually fairly generic and does not seem to have been made custom designed to fit the mechanic.

The hitbox on your car is massive since it is a long thin limo, it rotates on itself constantly and you have no power over the steering. You can unlock an ability to rotate faster or jump but those are useless and clunky. Jumping even in paper lanterns will blow up the car so its uses are situational and usually pre scripted. Going faster just kills you faster. 

The gameplay loop ends up along the lines of staring at the minimap to get your bearings, dying on your way to the hotspot, usually respawning to the garage or some checkpoint that is closer to the quest, then picking up the passenger, having the mini scripted interaction play out, go from hotspot to hotspot dying regularly in between. Trigger a few banter lines. Reach a hotspot that is colored differently. Play the farewell exit video. Rise and repeat.

The game does unlock new areas and there seems to be a fairly varied cast of people. If the game used proper driving mechanics, and added more game mechanics to fleshen up the towns it could have been some strange FMV GTA1 parody of some sort. But as things stand what is on offer does not even compare to crazy taxi.

The acting was also fairly low energy and seemed like a cop out so they would not have to actually script any NPCS. The environments are static, bare, and mostly uninteractive. There are some random little townspeople but they just kind of scatter about randomly. The engine looked awfully unity-engine like as well despite the good cohesion with the UI.

There is a cosmetics shop but since you get paid pennies for doing missions you could never afford anything in it, and most of it looks fairly lackluster and uninteresting anyways.

As things stand this does not even have the mechanics necessary to compete with a proper Casual - Marble Routing game such as Rock of Ages. In fact I would recommend you play that instead, since at least you will have to engage with fun momentum management.

I laughed at surprisingly many of the FMV cutscenes (""the Giorgio stare"", oh my), and a few in-game events, so besides the entertaining gameplay, this definitely earns the [b]fun[/b] stamp from me.

Various tips:
- It takes about 3 hours to finish the game, with no attention to completion %, but including trying all the challenges at least once. There is additional content/challenge available after that, but for starters assume that that is the playtime you'll get for your money.
- The first thing you see when you start the game, is that 'Playing with a controller is highly recommended'. I can confirm that is the case, as I played the game with a keyboard, and the non-analog ""full speed-stop-full speed-stop"" necessary to pass some obstructions isn't optimal. Don't let that discourage you from buying the game - just be prepared for a bit of frustration and restarts here and there, and that you won't get many of the ""completed within x seconds"" bonuses. It is [i]completely doable[/i] to play and finish with a keyboard.
- Once you leave the DMV, hit escape and take a look at the map. I didn't realize this was available until later in the game, and I had to make detours to visit some things I had missed while driving right by.
- Have a look in the graphical settings, and consider turning off ""70's style visual effects"". I found it distracting.
- If you just want to finish the game, don't bother collecting/earning money to buy houses. Some of the achievements require buying specific upgrades in the garage, so keep ~300$ for that.
- Once you finish the last story mission, once you start the game again, you are plopped back down into the last map, and you can drive around and explore and complete any objectives that you didn't previously.",1528408038,1528408038,True,2,0,0.530685961246490479,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-Kind of short story leaving you with wanting more. 

This games story is a little short but you can easily find yourself doing more with side missions and collectibles. You can easily squeeze out some great worthwhile gameplay out of this experience. You can tell with the FMV that this was probably just the funnest project to work on.

If you enjoy driving games, and want a twist, this is your title. If you enjoy cheesy FMV, this is your title. If you just want something unlike the normal games in your library; the mechanic in this game of the constant spinning tells me, this is your title. Give it a try.

I bought this game for the Full Motion Video, after playing Press X Not to Die, and Roundabout delivered on that account. The game has a lot more interesting features, and it will keep me coming back to it to keep exploring. The designers put a lot into the game, and it is a unique experience. I think everyone should try it, just to see something very different. There is a lot of love and polish that went into Roundabout... cool music, funny joke upgrades, and little graphical effects... and this game would be otherwise easy to dismiss.

To everyone else, this is a pretty solid game.

A revolving limo is a neat idea. The comedy is spot-on. The open world is pretty good, but does get annoying when needing to travel to a place without the want of dealing with road hazards. Upgrades are pretty meh. Switching direction should have been bound to a button, not upgrade. Jumping was a very fitting idea, but it seemed as if it was thought of halfway through development, because it's not used very often. But the gameplay was generally fun and challenging (sometimes it wasn't a good kind of challenging).

For $15, I can't really recommend this. For $10, I think non-determined completionists would find value. But I do need to list the annoying bugs I've encountered, for anyone wanting to play:

Explosion sound not going away: happens when you die and restart just afterwards, sound can stack many, many, many times; fix: exit the game
Unable to jump: happens when you die or restart in an area where you aren't allowed to jump; fix: go into a no-jump area and come back out
Immediately hit as mission starts: just happens sometimes; fix: get onto a small ledge (like the island of a roundabout) such that the limo is angled and restart

If you can deal with a few annoying, unfixed bugs, then I recommend this. Determined completionists will probably find the bugs too annoying to deal with.

EDIT: After completing the game, I can say that completing the game is definitely very fun. But, unlocking all of the achievements wasn't so fun. The complete game experience was definitely recommendable, unless you want to get the high scores in some levels, then that part isn't fun when the bugs mentioned above start appearing.

There's no attempt to explain how or why, but you just go with it as you attempt to negotiate the streets to complete missions, progressing the amusing storyline, or simply exploring to pick up special tokens, including bundles to cash, that allow you to mod your limo, or buy real estate around the city.
Ultimately, however, I nominated it for the ""Whoooaaaaaa, Dude! 2.0"" award, as that seemed far more appropriate overall.
For such a cheap and seemingly simple game, there's a surprising amount of depth, and even replayability - while you only need to mosey your way through any story quest once to progress, you can go back and repeat the missions as much as you like to attempt to improve your standing against your friends and globally.

In the daily course of your job, you meet a mechanic who promises to help you get into the big leagues, fight a French-Canadian ripoff, hallucinate a talking skeleton, and fall in love with a spotaneous young woman.

If that doesn't already sell you on this, I don't know what more I can tell you.  I guess I'll try, though.

Georgio Manos is a revolving limo driver who comes to the city of Roundabout in 1977 with the intention of acquiring fame, fortune, and hopefully very little nausea.  The game plays like a combination of Kuru Kuru Kururin and Crazy Taxi - your goal in each mission is to drive the passenger to their destination via a series of checkpoints while collecting coins, mowing down pedestrians, and avoiding obstacles.  It's simple to learn, challenging to master, and a whole lot of fun to watch.

As the game progresses, you unlock more powerups for your limo, such as the ability to slow down time, reverse which direction you're spinning, and fire traffic cones out of your trunk (no, really).  Between missions, you can explore the overworld to purchase properties around town, collect cash bundles, attempt special mini-game challenges, and unlock new horn noises for your limo.

The gameplay is plenty of fun on its own, but what really makes Roundabout stand out is the story.  Every cutscene is presented as something out of a cheesy 70s B-movie, mixing stock footage with actors so amateur that it's actually pretty adorable.  Georgio Manos never speaks a word, but it's not necessary - the facial expressions she gives the passengers is all the communication you need.  The eclectic cast of characters ranges from a nervous guy going out on a date, to an anarchist art enthusiast, to a hallucinated talking skeleton.  (Seriously, I can't emphasize the talking skeleton enough.)

My one major complaint is that trying to 100% the game can be incredibly frustrating.  Each mission has a series of bonus objectives which range from fairly doable (collect every coin) to nearly impossible (complete the mission in under 12 seconds), and picking up all the collectibles in the overworld is sure to drive you insane.
Additionally, the game is fairly short - you can probably complete the main story in just 6-7 hours.  But this is a more minor complaint, because the game fits everything it needs to into that time.  Any longer, and it would probably just feel like overkill.

All in all, Roundabout is a great game with a quirky sense of humor and a whole lot of creative heart.

Basically, the game is about a limo driver with lots to say and no time to say it. The gameplay itself is basically a large puzzle. In your rotating limo, you slide gently around the levels while collecting tokens and avoiding hitting things. Since the limo is automatically rotating, that's a challenge.

During the three to four hours of gameplay, you'll come across a colorful cast of characters, gain rivals and maybe even find love. The cheesy story is presented in film, which has a very fun low fi asthetic to it. The graphics of the game aren't anything special, but it's an arcadeish game, not some AAA blockbuster, so you'll likely forgive the technical aspects of the game.

[h1] How does the game perform? [/h1]

Admirably, but again the game isn't trying to win any technical awards so good performance is a requirement at this point. The music and sounds are about as good, with nothing to complain about nor speak of in particular. Of course, the cutscenes are great at the end of the day they'll be what you remember most of all.

[h1] Should I pick it up then? [/h1]

The game is basic, but then again it's also cheap. If you want a fun few hours, I'd recommend it. The game isn't going to stretch your skills or challenge your intellect but it's really *really* fun.

The FMV sections are well put togheter and have the exact look and feel you'd expect. Driving around with a rotating limosine is challeging, and it never becomes too easy, since the challenges do become more complex at every couple missions. This is good for one hand because it keeps it fresh, on the other hand this game can also be infuratingly frustrating. Fortunately it allows you to retry the missions easily, however this is not without a few weird behaviours and bugs, since it appears the game doesn't really restart at the ""retry"" but remembers the damage the car had beforehand and sometimes when you respawn it will still take damage or explode, nothing massive but a tad annoying.

One thing to note is that the actress playing georgio (Kate Walch) is easily the best actor in this whole ordeal, and doing so without uttering a single syllable, the other ones are hit and miss, depending on the situation, but always in an absurd short of way, which is exactly what is intended.

The soundtrack is surprisingly charming and fits the tone, lots of soft funk basslines within the same style, all very catchy. In the graphics department it's perfectly servicable, colorful and nice but nothing spectacular. Fairly recommend this one if you liked the trailer.

Městečko Roundabout bývalo klidné místo, kde všichni dbali daných předpisů a chovali se spořádaně, pak se ale objevila ona – Georgio Manos, ryšavá šoférka bez skrupulí. S dodržováním pravidel si hlavu neláme, silnice je pro ni pouze jedna z možných cest, jak přepravit své zákazníky rychle a bezpečně do cíle. Samotný zážitek z jízdy, navíc obohatila o jeden nevšední prvek, kterým je neustálá rotace její limuzíny. Oblíbená je také díky své naprosté diskrétnosti, nepokládá žádné nepříjemné otázky, jen s úsměvem počká až se usadíte a poté v tichosti vyrazí. Na pohodlném zadním sedadle, jí tak dělá společnost pestrá škála zdejších obyvatel, od slavných celebrit až po tajemné členy podsvětí. Jedno takové setkání, se jí však má stát osudovým...

Autoři ze studia No Goblin, se při vymýšlení základního konceptu hry, patrně nechali inspirovat japonskou záležitostí Kuru Kuru Kururin. Vaším úkolem tak nebude nic menšího, než navigovat rotující limuzínu z bodu A do bodu B, a při tom se pokoušet vyhnout všem překážkám. Nemusíte se však obávat vysoké obtížnosti, na úspěšné zdolání všech misí, se nevztahují žádné časové limity ani omezený počet pokusů. Když se vám podaří někde havarovat, pak budete vráceni jen o pár metrů zpět, a můžete okamžitě zahájit opravný manévr. Postupem času získáte také speciální schopnosti, jako je například skákání nebo zpomalení času, díky kterým bude vaše snažení zase o kus snazší.

Vedle zábavného kličkování ruchem maloměsta, hra nabízí ještě jednu povedenou věc, v podobě hraných scének při nastupování a vystupování zákazníků. Všichni zúčastnění jsou očividně bez hereckých zkušeností, ale jejich upřímná snaha a neskrývané nadšení, působí velice sympatickým dojmem. Naprosto profesionální je ovšem přednes vypravěče, který vás bude provázet celým příběhem. Ten je rozdělen do několika samostatných lokací, takže se nemusíte obávat, že budete celou dobu hrát pouze na jednom místě. Můžete si také kupovat veselé kloboučky a neotřelá lakování, na jízdní vlastnosti sice nemají žádný vliv, ale hravé šoféry jistě potěší.

Pokud tedy máte náladu na neobvyklou hru, kterou se protočíte za necelé tři hodiny, pak máte mé doporučení.

PS: Hru lze hrát i na klávesnici, ale vřele doporučuji ovladač.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
You’re a silent spinning limo driver (the limo spins not you (well technically you do too but whatever)) who picks up random people as passengers and is dragged into a story of love, racing, and murder. The plot itself could have been easily ignored in a game like this but the effort and care put into it made me actually want to finish the story. Is it great? Absolutely not. But by the end, you forget the gimmick and kinda just take the story as a story. The FMV cutscenes are a bit more… terrible? The voice acting and direction in general is absolutely awful but in a way that made me laugh instead of hate myself. They knew it was cheesy and a B movie and they owned up to it. Overall, I actually really enjoyed the characters and story.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
You’re a spinning limouzine, hit all the checkpoints, you can jump, and you can get hit like 4 times before you die and respawn at the last checkpoint. It’s a simple format but it’s done well. The challenges break up into maximum 1-2 minutes each and it’s fast enough to get you hooked but not bored. The gameplay itself is almost like a puzzle game as you figure out what series of moves would be the best for this scenario. Honestly, I never “got it” (it never clicked) but it was fun having those micro challenges and I kinda want to watch a speed runner go through it because their runs must look amazing. If you’re a completionist or like the challenge itself, you will spend a lot of time on it.

There are challenges and side quests in an open world but I ignored all of them because all they get you is money to buy property that does… something? The upgrades are kinda useless too and I never actually looked for them or actively went to see them out. I’m glad too because it doesn’t over complicate things.

[h1]Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)[/h1]
The game looks OK. The cutscenes are FMV and the quality is nice but compression hits hard. Don’t know if it's because of the filter though. Performance was stable though.

+ Although there's no storyline justification as to why the protagonist is driving a spinning limousine, there's one great justification to have this as the core mechanic of this game - it's  challenging and fun, and that's all it needs to be.
+ Most cut scenes are pretty amusing. I didn't laugh out loud, but I did smile a lot :-)
+ Music, graphics, maps are all well made for a game with such a silly subject. The few things that lack polish (e.g. acting, dialogs) are very obviously intentionally bad.

- There's practically no tutorial and no explanation of icons etc...
- Some stages are frustrating to play, with difficult to complete jumps or places that are very tight and difficult for a spinning limo to pass through. To make things worse, in some cases when you die (that is, when you hit objects too many times until the limo explodes) you respawn too far back.
- The player collects cash during the game, and can use it to buy paint-jobs, horns, hats (yes, for a limo), properties around town etc. Personally I wasn't interested in collecting cash or paying for any of these things. I was only interested in driving and in the funny cut scenes, and luckily all this econo-stuff is just optional so I didn't have to put much effort into it (and if it is important in any way, the game doesn't explain).

Best tip: If you can't jump far enough, use the accelerate (boost) button together with the jump. It's mapped to the gamepad trigger.

Bottom line: I enjoyed playing this game and can recommend it for a few hours of fun.",1483054432,1483054432,True,9,0,0.563369572162628174,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The charming late 70s theme is sweet, fun, and hilarious! The story is driven by hilarious live action cutscenes that add an undeniable charm to this challenging game. You spend your time... actually, all of your time, driving people around in your constantly rotating limo. You can customize it, buy ability upgrades for it ( only 1 can be equipped at a time ), and squeeze it throw narrow passages. The main mechanic of rotating really makes the idea of driving around your local city an epic and difficult process!

Here is a summary of the positives (+) and negatives (-):

+ Challenging and pure rotation mechanic, transforming everyday objects and buildings into a puzzle unto itself.

+ Funny, charming, and great live action cutscenes!

+ Endearing and well fleshed out 70s aesthetic.

+ Easy to learn, challenging to master.

+ Tons of collectables and a solid amount of extra content.

- Graphics are fairly low fidelity. However, the 70s video filter DOES help. One of the few times chromatic aberration helps!

- The audio of the rumbling limo is way too loud and often drowns out other sounds in the game.

- Minor framerate problems, but only in specific locations.

- Main story is fairly short, at about only 5 hours.

- Some tiny and minor bugs, such as respawing in a safe location only to get damaged to the point of getting blown up again!",1482903024,1482903024,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Your friends may also consider you crazy if you describe it to them: ""Well, you're literally spinning around the city in a limo, hitting pedestrians, jumping on rooftops, and blowing shit up"" - they would probably give you a weird look or two after that.

If we boil it down to the core gameplay, then Roundabout is first and foremost a puzzle game. In fact, the main game mechanic here is inspired by a lesser-known Japanese puzzle game Kuru Kuru Kururin, which is more than 15 years old at this point. But it would be a gross oversimplification just to label Roundabout as a puzzle game, since its much more than that.

Gameplay-wise, you move around the map in a constantly revolving limousine, which is challenge in and of itself, since there are plenty of tight turns and obstacles or hazards in your way, that you'll need to manoeuvre around and avoid respectively, since it takes just three collisions for your limousine to blow up as though it was packed to the brim with explosives. So, timing and precise movement are key here, but you shouldn't really sweat it, since this game is pretty forgiving - blowing up usually isn't that big of deal. You don't really lose when blowing up, outside of various challenges and side-missions.

So why is Roundabout more than just a puzzle game? Mostly because of its story, style and setting. Everything is presented in a style of a 70s B-Movie, with the appropriate story, style of graphics and music — and there's also FMV! It's one of those rare times when cheesy green-screen FMV really feels at home, and having a just a few actors for all of those roles makes it even better. There are also various side-missions and challenges available in Roundabout, usually centered around endurance, collectables for you to find on a pretty big ""open world"" map, upgrades and customization options which you unlock (both visual and technical), property aquisition, etc. All of this greatly increases the overall scope of the game, providing a sometimes needed distraction.

With all that, Roundabout creates a very fun and relaxing puzzle game experience, which are pretty rare on the market. It's just the type of game that you need when you want to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Most people probably didn't understand this game, with SteamSpy estimating sales just at 38K copies at the time of this review, but I think you should give it a chance.

Seriously, this game is an exercise in frustration.

Okay, the story is kind of fun, told almost entirely through FMVs. Apparently the team couldn't afford any decent props so they decided to just add some film grain and turn it into a cheesy 70s pastiche. Even though, aside from a few references to Jimmy Carter and disco, it really has no effect on the game whatsoever. It's basically Kuru Kuru Kururin crossed with GTA. Navigate your spinning limo around the city delivering people from A to B, trying not to burst into a flaming wreck on the way.

But you'll finish story mode in about an hour, and after that, unfortunately there isn't a whole lot to do. You can replay the individual missions and try and achieve a better score, or you can try and collect some of the hundreds of extra items within the game world. You can buy some of the 23 properties within the game world. What do they do? Well, they give you money every now and then, but you have to go back and collect it. Or you could try and find the 127 piles of cash in the game world. They...give you cash. What do you do with all the cash? You buy 'hats' and paint jobs for your limo, which make NO difference to the gameplay and are purely cosmetic. So, money is useless. You can try and find all of the 157 ""Sick jumps"", which are similar to the jumps in the GTA games. I don't think anything at all happens when you find them all besides a Steam Achievement. Or you can try and find all 49 horns. Which, again, are purely cosmetic.

The story mode itself is also incredibly linear, with no branching, and almost no variety in the order missions can be completed in. So...about an hour of story mode which consists almost entirely of driving from A to B, with the occasional pedestrian killing-spree thrown in. And then there's 333 optional extras you can find. Which don't do anything useful. There's no additional vehicles or anything like that. Oh, and there's half a dozen or so minigames, most of which you'll have already done as part of main missions.

The only modifications you can make are unlocked in garages as you play, and can do things like let you float/dive in water, or alter which way you spin. None of which you need for the missions.

It's a nice enough game and the presentation is very well done, but there isn't really much here to do once you've finished the main game. It's really just a mini-game that's been expanded into a full-length game without reason. If there were optional missions (taxi missions, anyone?), or upgrades that radically altered the way the game works (what if, say, certain missions were only available after certain mods to your limo, like the rich guy won't get in unless it has tinted windows added), or if the collectables DID something (like the hidden packages in GTA) then there might be a reason to keep playing after the end. But, there really isn't. Except for bragging rights.

It's also quite buggy...often a respawn will either drop you miles from where you were, bypassing all the closer checkpoints, or it'll respawn you partially inside a building or vehicle causing you to explode immediately. This might happen 3 or 4 times before you can regain control. I also once had my balance switch to £0.01- for absolutely no reason, and was also told that the garage was earning me money and was 23% complete....even though that's not possible in-game.

It's worth playing. For about an hour. But there isn't any replay value unless you want the Steam Achievements.

They describe it as a '70s B-Movie and you'll find that everywhere. Expect 'bad' humor, 'bad' scenes/acting, 'bad' plot, etc. It has a very particular style of humor throughout the game that I think you'll either like or hate.

Pretty simple premise: you have a car that always rotates/spins and you have to maneuver it, avoiding obstacles, to your destination. The car itself doesn't control like a vehicle; you can jump, move in any direction (with a slight delay to reverse direction or reach max speed), and choose to spin faster. Collide with enough objects enough times you'll explode, no regenerating health. You drive through the same world where story missions take place. Missions are generally 'avoid obstacles, follow checkpoints until you get to the destination' missions.

There are plenty of collectables scattered across the world when you're not in a mission so there are things to do while travelling in-between missions.

A lot of the time one hit leads to another (no real invulnerability period after a hit) so you can destroy the limo pretty quickly. It's pretty frustrating when you almost get to a checkpoint before getting caught on one obstacle that destroys the car.

I would have liked a fast travel option or a way to just start missions. Maybe an easy-mode hot-air balloon type of thing to fly over the world just to activate missions (and be unable to get collectables).

It was a little annoying when I died multiple times trying to go fast through the city and just wanted to get to the next mission area. There are areas that I found a pain to get through which is fine for a mission but annoying for world travel.

Because the game plays almost top-down, I found myself looking a lot at the minimap for pathing and the main screen only to dodge/manuever. You can't really tell what the best path is because it's zoomed in enough that you may make a leap of faith into a deadly series of obstacles. I found out later that you can press +/- on the keyboard to zoom out a little but it's still not quite enough for me.

In rare cases (after dying) you'll respawn in a bad location that causes you to immediately take damage again.

Worth a look if you like platformers and you think you'll like this variant. Even if you enjoy cheesy cutscenes you're going to have to platform your way through the world and through several dozens of missions to see the story (which is B-movie mediocre).

In Roundabout, you control a constantly rotating limousine. You play as Georgio Manos, the world’s first revolving limousine driver. Your limousine is constantly rotating at all times, which forms the core of the game’s gameplay – you know how to get from point A to point B, but your constant revolution makes your life a lot more difficult. Early on it is fairly simple, navigating your way around stationary obstacles, but as the game progresses, things get increasingly more difficult, with moving obstacles, barrels which cause you to bounce in the opposite direction after striking them, platforming (done while spinning all the while), and the odd unique gameplay challenge to make things harder.

The core of the game are the “rides”. At the start of each ride, Georgio picks up a passenger, each of whom has a little bit of dialogue to start things off – a reason for going from point A to point B. There’s also a narrator, who chimes in, and both the narrator and the passengers are pretty chatty – every mission contains numerous lines of dialogue, as well as at least two FMV videos, one at the start and one at the end – with some rides having additional FMVs interspersed in the middle.

The passengers are deliberately terribly acted – every character acts in a very cheesy way. The videos are shot to look like something made in the 1970s, and the game itself is set in the 1970s, with references to Jimmy Carter and Disco present throughout the game, and a 70s aesthetic to the entire world.

But while the characters are campy as heck, they have a certain degree of Narm Charm to them – the acting in this is one of those “So Bad It’s Good” sort of things, and deliberately so, and it more or less works. It is impossible to take the game seriously, and the game knows it, and so plays it to the hilt, with “serious” events being comically ridiculous due to context, acting, and the very low budget of the game.

The game itself outside of the FMVs looks reasonable – it is not the highest quality of graphics, but the cars have an iconic quality to them, and while there’s nothing particularly special about the graphics in the game, they’re very serviceable and look decent enough.

While you can play through the game and just beat it, the game is not very hard in and of itself – the game is very generous with checkpoints, and it is impossible to fail at a ride. The real challenge in the game comes from completing optional objectives on the various rides. These include speed running the ride, beating a ride without getting hit at all, collecting all the coins in each ride, and beating the ride in various more difficult ways (no jumping, no using your alternate abilities). You can complete one or several of these challenges in any particular go at a ride, and you need not complete them all in a single ride.

Additionally, there are various collectables. Beyond being able to buy skins and limo hats via in-game currency which is not terribly difficult to collect (I ended up with $4k in the bank at the end with nothing to spend it on), you can also purchase properties… which periodically give you more money (oh boy!). But there are also piles of money in the environment to collect, “sick jump” icons which are in places you must jump to (ranging from inanely easy to reach to quite difficult, requiring multiple distant leaps), and horns which make different sounds when you honk them.

You also can unlock a bunch of items which allow your vehicle to do different things. There’s a raft which allows your car to float on water and dive beneath it, there’s an ability which slows down time, there’s an ability which reverses your direction of rotation just as if you’d hit a barrel, there’s an ability which makes your limo play ice cream truck sounds to pull in pedestrians to run over… there’s even an ability to shrink down your limousine, unlocked only after you beat the game, which makes a few things a lot easier (and is required for beating a few of the speed run times). These unlockables are either unlocked as you progress through the game, or (in most cases) unlocked by completing some sort of special challenge, such as running over 2,500 pedestrians or bouncing off of those direction-reversing barrels 100 times. While some of these sound tedious, I actually ended up unlocking almost all of them in the first of three major areas in the game.

All in all, this game is remarkably fun for how low budget it is. It rolled with its low-budget nature and did not take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it actually ends up having its cheesy story work to some degree – you can’t help but be amused by the terribly campy characters and the overdramatic narrator, and all the terrible, terrible puns. The gameplay itself is competent enough, though 100%ing the game is pretty tough, especially the speed run and no hit challenges.

If the core gameplay mechanic seems interesting to you, then this might be worth checking out.

A controller is strongly recommended.

It's a non-linear open world game with storyline attached. You head towards one of the animated stars on the mini map to pick up your next client. There's a short film (FMV) of a real-life character actor on the back seat telling you where he/she wants to go and why, then off you go following a big yellow arrow, trying to avoid all the cars and other obstacles in your way. If you hit 5 obstacles your car bursts into flames and you respawn at your last checkpoint, of which (thankfully) there are many.

Dotted around the streets there are spots where you can get a full repair. These are useful when they're in the middle of a particularly difficult stint but mostly redundant since you constantly just die and respawn anyway.

At the end of each successful trip there's another FMV as the character's personal story progresses. There's no overall storyline, the various threads are all unconnected apart from the fact that Georgio drives them all around.

At a certain point in the game jumping your limo becomes a thing, and the tasks increasingly require it.

[h1]Pickup Items[/h1]

There are many items to collect all over the place:

[list]
[*] Stars placed along the route. Try to collect them all during each trip for a bonus.

[*] Piles of cash boost your profits (which also increase as you complete tasks) and with the money you can buy properties, which boost your profits further.

[*] Shortcuts open up new areas of the map to explore.

[*] Hats (objects that appear on your limo roof - burger, donut, cardboard boxes etc), horns and paint jobs are unlocked which you can then buy with your profits.

[*] 9 mini games/challenges - eg. keep the football in the air, place the coffins, destruction derby - most of which have related achievements and leaderboards.

[*] Upgrades are introduced as you reach certain milestones in the game. The first one allows you to slow the car down which is very useful for new players. I'm fond of the one that reverses the spin direction at will - most obstacles are designed to be navigated either by spinning clockwise or anticlockwise so being able to choose makes things slightly easier.
[/list]

[h1]'70s Theme[/h1]

It's certainly recognisable as 70s. The generic background music (twanging bass and fast trumpet) from all 70s cop shows gives it away immediately, but if you're looking for period drama or insightful commentary on 70s culture then I'm afraid you're out of luck. There are some wing collars, tasteless sports jackets and I heard a pedestrian yell something about Jimmy Carter but that's about as far as it goes. There's a groovy disco tune on the main menu; I would have liked to hear more pieces in-game but sadly not even Disco Sylvain managed to produce any, and there's no punk at all.

[h1]Wanton Genocide[/h1]

Crowds of pedestrians shout angry comments wherever you go. They all end up in your wake as a bloody mess (don't worry, no close-up gore). There's no penalty for murdering innocent civilians, in fact one of the upgrades requires you to mow down 2,500 of them. It seems counter-productive for a driver to cull potential clients though doesn't it?

[h1]Acting[/h1]

... is (intentionally?) bad and the storylines are a bit wacky and inconsequential. There are quite a few characters with a different actor for each. The star of the show is a plastic skeleton, which indicates the general standard of acting here. These FMVs, though I wouldn't find them very impressive in any other context, do bring the game to life and I've enjoyed every cheesy minute of it. Georgio herself never utters a word. No idea why not.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

For the first few hours I was bursting into flames literally every 5 seconds. Towards the end my stamina increased to 10 seconds and occasionally even to the dizzying heights of 15 seconds (please resist any filthy comments). Deaths cost nothing though, unless you're trying for a deathless achievement. After a while it becomes part of the game and you're often repeatedly trying to make it to the next checkpoint without dying. Checkpoints are numerous enough that you can still make good progress despite frequent deaths.

Overall it's a good challenge. Difficult but no rage-quit due to the plentiful checkpoints.

[h1]Performance/Graphics[/h1]

Smooth and responsive, no glitches found on either Windows or Linux. The artwork of the game is clear and cartoony 3D, good quality but not overly artistic. The FMV is like watching TV (not flatscreen, ofc). There are a few cutscenes within the FMV which are deliberately fuzzy film snippets of cars exploding at the bottom of cliffs and suchlike. No problems at all.

[h1]Value[/h1]

It took me 7 hours to finish the story with 31% completion. Bear in mind that my controller skills are abysmal. The story is really only a means to show the player the entire town, afterwards you can continue in sandbox mode to collect further upgrades, hats, horns etc. Not to mention the achievements and mini-game leaderboards. All in all I'd say it's well worth the full asking price.

[h1]Steam[/h1]

5 trading cards. 40 achievements. Steam cloud. Steam leaderboards. It's got the lot. Cross-platform is the cherry on the cake.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

7 hours was more than enough for me - towards the end I was starting to find it tedious. I'm not blaming the game for this, it's just that I usually prefer some mental stimulation in my games whereas this is pure fun with no brainwork required. There's only so much fun I can take before I feel the urge to torture myself with some masochistically difficult puzzles.

This is a unique game, unlike anything else you've ever played (probably). If you like the idea of using a controller to grapple with a spinning limo then I highly recommend it, you'll have hours of fun. The many extra features flesh out the core gameplay nicely and it runs smooth as silk on all platforms.

Driving over people, blood everywhere, explosions. But it is not only about it really, only when you do few quests where you have to run over somebody. The main goal of the game is to get from one point to another and don’t crash with your car. And it's not easy as it sounds, because your car is a limousine that continuously spins around and occasionally just jumps.

Roundabout is essentially a logical platformer, where you need with the help of spinning avoid tricky deployed obstacles, including tires, which change direction of spinning of your limousine. In garages, which are scattered throughout the town, you can use removable upgrades like swimming or temporarily slow down time. You can also jump and quickly accelerate, but all at a constant spinning.

Even though this sounds like a strange feature, developers No Goblin were inspired by another game and they took it on their own. And it’s very funny. The environment is beautifully coloured and you will drive … I mean spin through several parts of the town, from the beaches to snowy mountains. You need to obtain missions in some parts of town and it feels like sort of an open world. You earn some cash for doing missions and tricks which can be spend to improve the quaint decorations on the roof and funny honking sounds.
 
What is the main advantage, however, is the story. It is narrated through FMV sequences that are very endearingly amateurish. Small studio due to their ""budget"" accommodate videos as short monologues of passengers with a female driver Georgio. Amateur actors take their roles with passion and you look forward to see more of it.

I haven’t encountered any major bugs while playing, just when the limousine jump into the air. I don’t mean when you crash, moreover, it takes only about five bumps into obstacles before the car explodes and returns to a nearby checkpoint, or to a repair shop in the garage. And I swear you’ll do this a lot. I am thinking of using the jump and jumping over roofs. Several times it happened to me that the car was stuck in the texture, flew into the building and blew up or crashed into invisible barriers.

Roundabout is truly indie game, the graphic design and movie sequences feels cheap, but it’s followed by the irreplaceable charm, from which some other little studios can inspire. This is an ambitious project that may look strange on paper, but in practice it works very well, because Roundabout doesn’t take itself seriously. Storyline is short and lasts for several hours, but the game is trying to prolong the game with pile of challenges plus the percentage performance of missions, which allows you to play again to achieve 100% in it. And you need to really try and endure dozens of explosions to achieve it. At these times, the game can be frustrating, but there’s no other game with a similar theme, nor a sense of humour so I can recommend it.",1469186726,1553294712,True,9,0,0.644970417022705078,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Et si un malade mental avait l'idée de fusionner Kuru Kuru Kururin avec les moments comédie d'un Pr0n Softcore des 70's ?

Bienvenue dans Roundabout.
Certes, vous n'aurez pas droit a de la nudité ou a ne serait-ce qu'une blague cochonne, mais vous aurez tout le même droit a des jeux d'acteur sublime digne des plus grand films des 70's.
Roundabout c'est littéralement Kuru Kuru Kururin en 3D avec une limousine en guise de... de... d'hélicoptère ? Le véhicule de Kuru Kuru Kururin est juste un baton qui tourne sur lui même et on doit le diriger jusqu'a l'arrivé en evitant de cogner les murs d'un parcours très étroit. Eh ben Roundabout c'est pareil, plus le côté hilarant, le jeu d'acteur délicieux, l'univers kitchissime et une BO funk/disco parfaite.

Roundabout est un jeu a scoring qui vous demandera une execution rapide et parfaite pour exploser le leaderboard ou au moins mettre la honte a vos potes. Pour ça rien ne vaut l'entrainement et l'aide de quelques petits power-up que vous pourrez débloquer. Enfin, si vous êtes comme moi le genre de personne qui adore jouer a la barbie dans un jeu-vidéo, réjouissez vous ! Vous pourrez customiser votre limousine avec des peintures, klaxon et chapeaux pour le toit de la limo.

Tous les personnages sont tordants, fous et offrent de bonnes barres de rires. Mention spéciale a Georgio Manos et Charles Maximilian ainsi que Beth, personnages de l'amour et du charisme.

Si en plus vous vous offrez la version deluxe, vous pourrez aussi jouer au jeu en vue cockpit et rendre votre déjeuner et ruiner votre caisse avant d'arriver a faire 3 mètres. Mais aussi profiter de la BO et d'une vidéo de l'amour <3.

Si vous cherchez un jeu fun, mais qui demande tout de même une certaine dose de skill, alors Roundabout c'est la vie.",1467665835,1467665912,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(Sì, ci sono mille altri giochi con attori veri a parte Plumbers, ma ci sono affezionato.)

Non ci sarebbe altro da dire.
Ma dico qualcosa lo stesso, e cioè che Roundabout è esattamente come vorrei che fosse ogni indie: originale. Anche riciclando idee di titoli del passato, ma originale. 

In questo gioco siamo Georgio Manos, un autista di limousine interpretato da Kate Welch, una.. YouTuber/GamerGirl/quellocheè, comunque una rossa molto carina. Se Georgio non vi sembra un nome da donna, è perché non lo è: l'autista infatti è pensato come un personaggio neutro (gli/le cresce pure la barba a un certo punto) e tutti gli si rivolgono come tale. Questa trovata fa già capire il tono surreale del gioco, confermato anche dal fatto che Georgio non parla, si esprime sempre a gesti e attraverso l'ottima mimica facciale della Welch (che di suo avrebbe pure una voce un po' fastidiosa, quindi meno male). Ma se non parla lui, parlano gli altri, ovvero gli eccentrici passeggeri che Georgio deve caricare in macchina, personaggi fuori dalle righe (e spesso interpretati dagli stessi ""attori"" vestiti in modo diverso) con storie strambe e missioni improbabili.

La particolarità di Georgio, però, sta nel suo modo di guidare, cioè… ruotando. 
La limousine ruota. 
Sempre. 
Costantemente. 
Senza mai fermarsi.
Sta a noi dover sfruttare questo movimento per destreggiarci nel traffico ed evitare ostacoli per portare i passeggeri sani e salvi a destinazione.
E anche se si sbatte troppo e si esplode, poco male, si ricomincia subito poco distante.

La città di Roundabout (così chiamata perché nessuno trova strano guidare così) è divisa in tre zone ben distinte tra loro, sbloccabili procedendo con la trama, ognuna di queste contenente una buona decina di missioni e sfide rigiocabili a piacimento e con le solite imprese (nessun danno subito, a tempo, raccolte tutte le monete, ecc.). I pedoni invece sono così poco considerati che si possono (e a volte si devono) investire facendoli diventare una cartoonesca poltiglia rossa. 
Proseguendo nel gioco si sbloccheranno anche altri potenziamenti quali il salto, la possibilità di galleggiare e via dicendo, mentre l'intera città è cosparsa di collezionabili quali mucchi di denaro (per comprare proprietà e modificare la propria limousine), clacson dai suoni diversi e gettoni da raggiungere facendo salti azzardati.
Completandolo si renderanno disponibili altre sfide tra cui Desert Limo, che riprende pari pari il tristemente noto Desert Bus per 8 ore di sfrenato divertimento (gh).

E niente, Roundabout è tutto qui: scarrozzare in giro la gente ruotando, ma è dannatamente divertente specialmente grazie alle espressioni di Georgio, all'assurdità dei dialoghi (tipo quelli del narratore) e agli inside jokes presenti. 
Con un ottimo comparto audio (alcune musiche sono bellissime) e a fronte anche di una longevità discreta (una dozzina di ore per fare tutto) è di certo un gioco che consiglio a chi cerca qualcosa di originale e sopra le righe, ma anche a tutti gli altri.

The result is about just as crazy as it sounds. 

The FMV video footage is deliberately cheesy and funny, and it mostly works. The basic gameplay mechanic is solid (as it always has been) and well-implemented in an open-world setting. The whole city turns into a big circus for your freaky car acrobatics! You also learn how to jump! JUMP! The game world is pretty big and sprawling, with multiple unlockable areas, minigames, collectibles and bonuses. Unfortunately the main missions can be played through faster than you can spin your car ten times, but for HC spinning afficionados there are plenty of fun bonuses to unlock to make the most of your time there.

You'll take role of Georgio Manos (Kate Welch) who just got her licence to drive a limo... in a new way (because normal driving is too mainstream).

Gameplay is all about driving a limo that's constantly spinning. I hope you haven't even expected some realistic play, because there isn't any - it's made to be entertaining and hard by its own way. You don't control the car from the position of the driver, you just choose the direction it should drive. That doesn't mean it's easy, it's actually pretty hard, the game will lead you to many puzzling situations where you'll have to use proper timing for all driving. To help that, you can use several skills like time slow down.

While the story is linear, between mission it's all about your driving in the open world (cities). Mission selection is based on driving (well, spinning) to specific place - that usually makes you stop at many places nearby, doing side missions and challenges. 

What's outstanding, are the cutscenes. They are made in 70s style with a lot of silly and funny dialogues, it doesn't even take itself much seriously. And neither you will take it seriously, considering there's nothing normal in the game - all you'll do is watching great cutscenes, spinning through the checkpoints, running over people and jumping. 

And that's what, in the end, made me disappointed. While I love the acting and whole sillyness, after about half an hour the gameplay feels too much boring and frustrating. I'd like to see this gameplay in some other (bigger) game as a funny minigame but building around this mechanism a whole game isn't something I could appreciate.

What's also a big disappointment is the length of the game. If you won't hunt for highscores and achievements, you can expect less than 3 hours of gameplay. ([i]I haven't finished it as I asked for refund, but you can check other reviews and howlongtobeat for this piece of information.[/i])

Some people might be surprised by the hardware requirements in compare to other casual games. I haven't got much performance problems overall but there were places with bigger amount of light effects which sucked most of my FPS (and it couldn't get turned off in the settings).

I understand why so many people like this game, though I haven't got the same impression.

Roundabout is a game about a chauffeur called Georgio who owns a limousine that always spins in circles. It takes this simple idea and puts it into a cartoon like open-world  with a few upgrades, some cosmetics and a few basic game mechanics mainly obstacles which you have to dodge, drive around and even jump over. At first, the game seems fun, colourful and quite funny. The map seems huge and the people you drive around seem fun and wacky. So why the negative review? Well…

The game just doesn’t work. At least for me it doesn’t. It’s not that the gameplay doesn’t match the story of the vibe of the world doesn’t match the characters. It’s just that there are too many things wrong with the game. Bugs and glitches are very common, I found myself easily once every 5 minutes getting wedged between 2 small objects or getting hit by something that I didn’t actually touch. When jumping onto things the limousine gets stuck and sometimes glitches slightly into the ground instantly killing you. That’s just PART of the reason why this is a negative review. 

 Let us start of with the gameplay. The gameplay starts off very fun and feels fluent and awesome, but after a few missions, it just starts to get so repetitive. Pick up X get to checkpoints A B C drop off at Y and dodge around a bunch of stuff along the way. There was no variation in the game. Even the challenges were just so boring after a little while. The gameplay did not fit in with how the world worked. It was just too easy to get hit too easy to die. It made the game frustrating and at some points feel unplayable. 

The story, while being alright, was only 2 ½ hours long, there are only a few characters that you pick up throughout the game and they’re all wacky and funny and stuff but it’s just so freaking short. Other than the story, there wasn’t much stuff to do other than the few challenges and going back to 100% all of the story missions completing tasks such as “Complete in under 30 seconds” or “Complete without hitting anything.” There are upgrades and hats and paint jobs you can unlock and buy but the best upgrade can be acquired within 2 minutes of finishing the tutorial mission. The rest are just cosmetics.  I mean if you want to get literal about it. You can complete the 8 F*CKING HOUR challenge that is basically “Desert Bus” but with this game’s art-style. What is Desert Bus you ask? It’s a game where you sit in first person in a car tapping left every so often so you don’t fly off the road, for 8 real life hours, and this game has a replica of it. 

So let’s get to another issue I have with this game. Who is it aimed at? At first you’d think children because of the colourful world and the wacky cartoonish characters, but the game is very difficult and frustrating. Not to mention the part where you run over pedestrians creating giant pools of blood on the road. So, achievement hunters? I guess, but it seems like even if you are an achievement hunter you wouldn’t waste your time with this game and have to sit there tapping left for 8 hours straight just to get that 1 achievement. So people who just want to play a short low budget indie game? Then why is it 15 dollars? I just don’t understand. 

The music is alright, very cartoony and upbeat, it’s good for this game. Nothing too crazy and like with a lot of games with not great music. I just put on my own music in the very small amount of time I spent driving around this game’s open world. 

The game looks cute, the real life cutscenes are very nice and compliment the game’s atmosphere. All the characters are brought to life by their costumes, and I generally I enjoyed the game and how it all looked.

Now the final part I want to go over is how the game runs. The game DOESN’T run at 60 FPS most of the time. Which I find crazy because I reach the minimal and recommend requirements for a game that isn’t very tanky graphics wise so it is just straight up poorly optimized. Also, micro stuttering from time to time. 

[b] TL;DR [/b]

Roundabout has a simple concept that it applies to a funny open world. The gameplay is frustrating, there are bugs and glitches everywhere. It’s extremely short and the entire game just doesn’t feel very complete. Also it’s way overpriced for the amount of content in it. This game will stay dead in my library never to be played again, by me at least.

Crazy Taxi has nothing on this, and even Grand Theft Auto pales in comparison to the cartoonish vehicular manslaughter committed in the sake of maintaing a combo multiplier. 

Casual gamers will feel welcomed and encouraged by the generous checkpoints, but an increasingly difficult series of bonus objectives for each mission will ensure that hardcore players don't have to take a comfortable backseat. Short of a few technical issues with the audio now and again, there's not a thing here that I wouldn't wholly recommend.

Roundabout is that game.  It's fun, exciting, frustrating, weird, but has a compelling storyline and cute visuals.  The bad acting is really endearing, and the gameplay is smooth and polished.  Really, my only complaint about it is that it's short. I completed the main storyline in four hours, with the main menu reading 24.0% completion, so there are a lot of other things to be done (challenges, achievements, etc.)

A lot of spinning, not as much as in a political campaign...but still quite a bit.
(This review comes 10 hours into the game having reached a 70% file completion.)

Roundabout is a game that some people will not get into (or perhaps even understand), either because the FMV and sense of humour falls flat for them or because the core gameplay mechanics might prove frustrating. However for some like myself this game will represent everything there is to love about gaming.

Gameplay:
Georgio Manos takes on the city of Roundabout in an attempt to be not only the world's first revolving chauffeur but also its best! The core mechanic of constantly spinning seems strange and disorientating at first, but it soon becomes second nature and the thought of moving in a straight line will seem absurd. The bulk of gameplay ‘revolves’ around reaching a location by passing through checkpoints whilst avoiding damaging your limo, it is in this respect that the game is simple, anyone will be able to clear missions by taking hits and resetting their last checkpoint so in that sense reaching the end of the game is simple. However passing each mission does not complete it, each mission has several other additional objectives that require you to achieve certain goals in order to 100% them, this can be completing the mission without taking damage, achieving a certain multiplier or streak and usually two time based goals with the faster one usually requiring you to use the speed boost through some if not most of the mission making it more challenging. If you are a completist when it comes to meeting extra objectives you will get more than enough out of this game to feel frustrated each time you almost meet an objective but oh so satisfied when you finally do. There is also a collection element to the game which has you pick up stacks of cash, buy property and customizations to your limo and collect blue coins only attained through jumping which is unlocked a little ways into the game and gives a platforming aspect to the game in a couple of missions but is primarily useful for collection purposes.

Story:
The story of Roundabout is delivered mostly through FMV, and it is in my opinion glorious. I adore the unashamedly and purposefully bad acting and although it may not be to everyone's liking I personally love it. The FMV really facilitates setting context to each of the missions and is supported by voice over at certain points within each mission at the checkpoints which is just as funny as it is useful for telling the player what to expect. Big props have to go to Kate Welch who plays Georgio, I already had known of her from youtube as ‘shegeekshow’ and she really gives a fantastic performance especially considering her unique position as the silent protagonist and the only person who doesn’t get any lines. It would also be unjust not to mention Jillian Carol who plays Beth, Beth features the most in the game beside Georgio herself and is definitely my favorite aspect of the game, I don’t want to spoil why she is the best part of the story and the FMV in general but without her the game would not have been as wonderful as I find it to be.
There is an over arching plot to the game and I honestly didn’t expect it to be as interesting as it was because it didn’t need to be nor did it have any right to be, but I found myself straying from my original method of playing each mission over and over to get 100% completion near the end so I could move on to each new mission to see how the story was going to develop and ultimately conclude. Is it a narrative worthy of an oscar? Of course not, however it wasn’t designed as such and didn’t need to be either however it has an unexpectant depth and charm which makes the experience this game offers all the more worthwhile.

Other:
The soundtrack is complementary to the fun and jovial nature of the game and along with the voice over within missions it prevented my initial expectation to play the game whilst listening to podcasts, it was simply too happy and enjoyable to sully my full experience that the audio provides to the game.
Bonus challenges and leaderboards add even more content and enjoyability to the game, just knowing you are so close to the top 10 or 50 or 100 makes you want to play to get further up the chart even if you have already completed all the objectives, it also quickly improves how good you are at the game.
Replay value - not applicable to everyone as already mentioned, but this game offers you so much more than just completing missions and moving on to the next one to see the FMV. Completionist gamers will love this game. Having spent about 8 hours in game and 2 hours just having fun messing about has only gotten me to 70% completion and I intend to make up the other 30% left to go. I also envision this being a game I come back to again and again perhaps every year or few months just to have a good time and to see how quickly I can get through everything.
I purchased this game on sale and to be perfectly honest this is a game that I would gladly pay full price for, however I do feel like this game had everything catered to me and as a result I felt happy to buy the Deluxe Edition Content not only to support the game but because I had the insatiable desire to see more from this game. For others who feel less enamored with the idea of the game at face value I say this game is a must buy if it is on sale if you even remotely think you might enjoy it.

Roundabout could be a perfect game for me from a subjective perspective and regardless of anyone else and their feelings for this game I will love it unendingly, however there are a couple of issues that I think would be unfair for me to overlook just because of my adoration for the game and these are:
- the menu will very occasionally (3 times for me across 10 hours) became unresponsive (only seems to happen when you constantly restart the same mission in quick succession, which can help to put you in a better position to start a speedrun by having you face a direction at first to make the start faster.) The quit to menu option always still worked on the menu and going to the main menu and selecting to go back in fixed this every time.
- sometimes restarting a mission that begins beside a wall or obstacle will cause you to restart and take one hit or damage straight away (it appears to be due to the position the limo starts in after being moved from your current location back to the start point) restarting a second time always fixed this problem for me and as such was not bothersome.

Conclusion:
I love this game, it pushes all the right buttons for me however it is not going to be to everyone’s taste. That being said I think for those who have an interest and who will ultimately get into what this game is and represents, they will have an enjoyable experience that perhaps in part can be found elsewhere but in full can only be had with Roundabout.",1448147463,1448168060,True,2,0,0.52245861291885376,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In all reality, Roundabout is a very confusing game. Yes yes the 70s  theme is very vell done and great, and same with the weird people living in the town, and it's hilarious that people getting bumpted install kill them and sound and look like a paint bucket spilling. 

But it's very hard to manage the actual game is the first point. The actual game, which is a simple taxi/ isometric driving game, is confounded by the fact that someone decided to put an overcharged revolution drive onto your limo, making the roadway's biggst (non-truck) inconvinience and safety issue into a bigger one. Because of this, it does not turn into a driving game, and turning like normal is impossible, and in idle, you sweep the entire road. This turns it into a sort of platformer-strategy-stealth-driving game, which is a confusing concept. It's a platformer, because there are only a few patches of land in which you can safely stay on, and you must somehow find a way to get to another safe space. 
The strategy part comes in that you have to figure out a way to get there, and taking into acount how your going to navagate any hazards along the way. And then the stealth part, you have to execute that plan perfectly with no slipups, diving into alleyways and avoiding damage and main roads. You have to do all of this while driving a quickly revolving limo. You get some powerups that help, but, prepare to die, and I feel bad for your passengers who much die and be reincarnated to die again over and over in what I assume is your rev motor exploding. I reccommend.

Oh, and the acting and Live Action Cutsceens are beautiful, the set design is actually very well done, and the acting/writing and everything falls in that sweetspot between ""school film project"" and ""aware indie film""",1447996905,1447996905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes? Okay, then. :-)
This game brings a huge smile to my face, if not for the main mechanic then for the execution...

The main mechanic - you're constantly spinning - is very original (okay, not unique, but close enough) and executed well. Actually traversing through the open world requires constant attention and timing, but very satisfying when done right. Along the way you get a few updates that help but won't break things. Make no mistake: this is a parkour game (and even that is mostly because it doesn't fit anything else). Don't think you're buying a racer or a sandbox or anything. It may have these elements but it's all about making your way from point A to B.

Even better is the briliant decision of the developers to not only dress the concept as a revolving limo in an open world but just balls out GO with the concept and include a great deal of hilariously badly acted cutscènes. Other devs should take note: never let a good idea be hampered by it not fitting in a certain world view. Instead, set the world around the mechanic.

So...a must buy. nonetheless, I have to note that the game isn't that long (though it has plenty of sidequests and hidden stuff) and barely varies from the main mechanic. So it won't occupy you for 10+ hours. But it'll entertain you in that time. :-)",1447797491,1447797491,True,1,0,0.524650275707244873,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That is easier said than done, as the city of Roundabout is filled with people equally as crazy as you and will happily ram into you if you don't get out of the way in time. Your limousine can never stop spinning or even change which direction you are spinning so that makes navigating anywhere trickier than you might expect. It sounds difficult and it is, however there is no way to lose a mission, if you blow up you will respawn nearby and are able to try as many times as you want. If you are a competitive gamer every mission has a leaderboard to take on, though if you are not there is only one reason to even try and that is the money multiplier. It is a system that rewards you for not crashing and at the same time causing as much mayhem as possible while collecting coins scattered about.

What is interesting about Roundabout is that it’s an open world game and you are able to explore wherever you please outside of missions. There are three surprisingly large maps to explore and are filled to the brim with collectibles like hidden money stashes, car horns and “sick jump” icons that reward you for reaching them. Early on in the game you earn the ability to make your limousine jump and are encouraged to leap from rooftop to rooftop, adding a lot more fun and variety to the game. With the money you have earned you can purchase real estate around the town, allowing you to take your share of the money they make. You have to personally travel to each of your buildings to collect your share and if you don't, the money from you share doesn't stack, meaning that you have to collect your money or that business won't make you any more profit. Even though it's open world there are still obstacles that can kill you everywhere and if you die while outside of a mission you will be teleported to a nearby mechanic shop. That can lead to you trying to make your way across the city only to die and respawn from where you started until you manage to get across. With how large the maps are, some form of fast travel would have been nice.

Environments are colorful and full of activity, like rabbits, fairs and pedestrians to run over Carmageddon style. There is plenty to see in the world of Roundabout from shopping malls to explore or great snowing mountains. Pedestrians scream and flee from the spinning limousine of death and make a satisfying splashing noise. There is plenty of blood and you are rewarded with cold hard cash to mow them over. If that bothers you there is an option to turn off violence and another one that makes the pedestrians scream gleeful things and giggle, which somehow makes the whole thing creepier to be honest. There are multiple other things to mess around with in the options menu like big head mode or changing the game to nighttime and it's all great fun. One minor nitpick is that you must exit your game and go into the main menu to activate or deactivate whatever options you want. It is a very cheesy and tongue in cheek game with a crazy world to suit. You can jump over planes, visit shopping malls and replay any previous missions for a shot at a better rank on the leaderboards. There are no graphic options so you may want to try the demo beforehand to make sure you can run it.

Kudos for having a demo on PC, which has become far too rare on the platform. Your limousine can be customized by going to a mechanic shop with a purple wrench icon, where you are able to purchase preset color schemes and hats for your limousine. Yes those hats, this is a weird game as you are no doubt aware by now. They are rather pricey however and there is a decent amount to buy, so it will take you a while to buy all there is to purchase. Side missions are blue stars on the map that have you bouncing a soccer ball on your spinning limo, avoiding cars falling from the sky and destroying police cars chasing you. They are all great fun that also include leaderboards, though they do repeat the same ideas, only in different areas of the map. By doing certain objectives like running over a certain number of people you can earn powers for your limousine that include driving on water or shrinking your limo to fit into tighter places. This game is constantly surprising you with its insane gameplay ideas and you truly never know what to expect next.

Speaking of Roundabout being an odd game, all the missions have a cheesy FMV cutscene of whatever customer you pick up in the mission. Our protagonist Georgio Manos is a mute driver that started the idea of a spinning form of transportation that really took off somehow. From children to billionaires, you will have all type of wacky customers that don't seem to mind that you run down dozens of pedestrians on your way there. The same actors are used in some situations but the tongue in cheek approach they take to that issue only serves to make it funnier. Eventually you meet a girl that is seduced by your awkward, wordless stares and becomes your love interest and the driving force of the story. It's not an interesting story by any means but it will have you laughing all the way through. The music in this game has a 70's disco vibe and while not outstanding it fits in very well to the world around it. Roundabout is a very creative Indie game in a sea of 2D platformers and RPG Maker titles.

Ever remember those old badly acted fmv (full motion video) games back in the 1980's and 1990's, those games sadly died down when gaming moved to better technology and better cutscenes and very few games nowadays come out using the classical full motion video technique

Then Roundabout comes along and I must say, it was a fun ride! The game basically follows a limo driver whose name is Georgio (but played by a gal, awesome!) who drives around areas of Roundabout City and its outskirts picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destinations and falls in love with one of his (or her) passengers, Elizabeth (Beth is mentioned in the game)

The plot does sound cliche but does use its gaming mechanics to make the game more fun and interesting, such as, that new technology makes limo cars turn round, like a roundabout, and basically you have to drive about with a turning limo, which is pretty fun but does have its flaws

I died or crashed... a lot, and it made me frustrated, sometimes it could be my fault, but it can also be due to bad timing, environmental elements blocking your limo, etc... this did annoy me sometimes but there are some upgrades that can help you on the way. The game does suggest that you use a controller, but I found it just fine to play with a mouse and keyboard

Now onto the fmv scenes, they are not bad, but they are not good. You can say that this game is so bad its good, but bad in a good way. Some of the actors did look like they were inexperienced and had no idea what was going on, for example, the date couple were the worst, they gave no character and looked like they were relying on each other for cues. Mike, the mechanic was also another one who gave very little character and also looked like he was relying on the script to give out his lines

The only two characters who I actually liked were Elizabeth, who although, did look like she was relying on the script but did give out some character and the quiet Georgio, who gives out his/her character brilliantly by just turning round, and looking at his/her passengers which made me giggle inside

The narrator was also good, giving out a character in his voice. The filming was mediocre and the sound editing did vary in some fmv scenes, sometimes they were okay and sometimes they were bad. I liked the addition of stock footage to replace the things the passengers were talking about

The game is pretty short, overall the main story is 2-3 hours long with some side missions here and there

Overall, this game is so bad its good, it has some memorable fmv scenes, and some great yet annoying gameplay, and a few characters that you will love till the end. It is highly recommended if you can take the type of games that they are so bad they are good type

Causing mayhem on the streets comes naturally when trying to maneuver a car that never stops spinning. Inspired by games such as Kuru Kuru Kururin, controls are responsive, yet actually controlling where you drive is challenging.
One can play through the main story fairly quickly, yet that is only part of the game. Numerous fun challenges await, there are collectibles en masse to be found, and a good amount of customizations to be unlocked. As a finishing touch, there's several goofy extra options, such as the Roundabutt mode.

While the game is surprisingly hard, the checkpoints are always fair, so that you don't really have to be perfect at the game.

The most charming feature about the game are its story and its FMV cutscenes. 
Keeping in touch with the 70s flair of the game, the cutscenes are ridiculous and full cheesy acting. But these cutscenes, where several weird, quirky characters enter Georgio's limousine are where the heart of the game is located. 

The game is incedibly hilarious with its story about love, glory, vengeance and redemption. Kate Welsh does an amazing job as silent Georgio Manos, who is interacting with the passengers using mostly facial expressions. But everyone else is on top of their game as well while trying to be as cheesy and hammy as possible. Not to enjoy these cutscene is almost as bad a crime as destroying someone else's car.

The core gameplay is very challenging. I had hoped I would improve my revolving limo skills as the game continued, but I found myself struggling throughout to get the timing of each run just right. Part of it is that mastery of each course requires memorization and crashing more than a few times. The game is fairly generous with checkpoints except during the open world segments when traveling from mission to mission - I often found simply getting to my next passenger more challenging than the actual ride.

It's a good thing that the story and presentation is simply not to be missed - it helps ease much of the frustration in the gameplay. The cutscenes harken back to the days of bad FMV games that used to dominate early CD-based platforms like the Sega CD. This means bad acting and cheap production values, but this time it's on purpose and used properly to give breaks from the gameplay (rather than replacing gameplay). It will certainly provide a few laughs to anyone who enjoys campy, ""so bad it's good"" production styles.

The story itself will only provide two to three hours of gameplay, but there is a good bit of variety in the experience. There is also hours of content to explore and unlock in the game's open world - customizations, mission replay challenges, and so on. Completionists will have a field day.

If the cutscenes presented in the game's trailer seem amusing, it's worth a purchase to experience the lunancy that is the world of Roundabout.

Roundabout is not one of those games.

Roundabout is an ingenious game. A game with a clear, well executed theme and a hilarious playthrough. The story is absolutely as silly as the gameplay, too. You play as a limosine driver that revolves, as you pick up a cast of strange characters and drive them throughout the city of Roundabout. The game goes about its goal of creating a 70's B Movie very well, with everything from acting like what you'd exepect from a 70's B Movie to VHS postprocessing effects that really add to the experience. Even little things, such as the HUD and subtitles add to the theme. The characters and story are memorable as well.

My only gripes are of the story length, as I wish it could be longer due to how great everything else is, however there are many challenges and settings that add various other neat things to the gameplay (permadeath mode, limo customizations, various collectables hidden throughout the map) that add some replayablilty.

First, take a simple, yet unique gameplay element.  Like, say, a limousine that's constantly spinning.  One that, through a delicate balance of timing and control, you have to guide through a city, weaving through parked cars, buildings, boulders, and whatever else it can throw at you.

Now, polish that one gameplay element.  Take it as far as it'll go.  Be creative.  Have fun with it.  Maybe there's points where spinning *backward* is the key.  Maybe you should spin over water, too.  Can the limousine jump?  Sure, but it'll be spinning the whole time.  Polish the gameplay until it shines.  A built-in speedrun mode that's solid and fun won't hurt.

Then, build your game's world.  A silly, spinning-obsessed city full of pedestrians who don't quite have the right-of-way, cars that park in the most inconvenient of places, construction sites set up so a well-trained limousine driver can spin through them, and a cast of goofy characters all waiting to be chauffeured around town, not a single bit of it being taken seriously.

Finally, sprinkle in actual live-action acting.  The sort where a bunch of people with actual cameras and sets filmed themselves getting into a limousine and acted out the story.  A delightfully cheesy story, no less, one about romance, weddings, civil disobedience, skeletons, murder, and tourism.  All acted out by a cast who were clearly enjoying themselves while they did it.

In short, if you don't at least get a good chuckle out of Roundabout, it's possible you don't have a soul.",1429383579,1429383579,True,1,1,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is definitely worth a play through, but maybe not at full price.


It's definitely a lot of fun, but it's also terribly short. It took me about 3hours (including the entire end credits section) to complete this game(at least the story), I still have a lot of collectibles to collect but I don't find that particulary interesting.

Oddly enough it requires quite a lot of power from the pc, I didn't have any issues, but windows suggested for me to use ''basic'' mode while I play it. 

BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME: it does not support all resolutions(mine was 1440x900), I  had black borders all over the place and it didn't want to fit into one monitor in a dual monitor setup(basically the game decided that in the middle of the two monitors conjunction is a great place to play the game)

The game isn't that much of a challenge, rather a nice and casual experience, even relaxing in a way apart from the challenges which are definitely tricky and keep you on your toes.

All in all, it's a nice casual experience and definitely worth a playthrough,  but maybe not at full price (though maybe all the acting and work put into the game does deserve full price... if only it was a little bit longer.. if only..)

And this is why we're going along for this crazy ride.




Gameplay: 95/100 A

""Roundabout is better with a controller! If you have one, be sure to plug it in and restart for the best experience possible."" - The Devs

Yes, take that advice if you're a PC user like I am, playing this game on a keyboard is hell. Not that it is poorly ported, not at all, this game requires precise movements and you can't get that with most keyboards, not like with a thumbstick. Anyways, Roundabout is a fun game, if not frustrating at times as you try and learn the game. It doesn't necessarily drops you in the middle of the game as it shoots you out of a cannon and into a wall and told ""Here you go - drive!"" But that's all part of the game and the story. Once you get a handle on the mechanics of the car, the game becomes a clever and really enjoyable experience, making the rest of the elements, the sights and sounds, that much better. Going back to the controls, I wasn't able to test the game out with my gamepad as it has up and disappeared and had to play with a keyboard, that said, with some growing pains, the game eventually became tolerable and again, fun, but I agree with the devs, a controller is a must to get the most out of this wonderful game. 


Audio: 98/100 A+

Let's get this over with - the music is fantastic. Nothing like 70's disco/funk to get you in the mood for silliness. Okay, now that the soundtrack stuff is out of the way, the sound design is pretty good as well. The voice capture from the FMVs are very well done, and the main character, Georgio, sounds amazing ;). The gameplay effects are well done as well, from the pedestrian screams of anguish and terror, to the explosions, and even the stereotypical 70s/80s video game effects from when you hit something. 


Visuals: 91/100 A-

Roundabout looks good, having its own design and style with obvious influences from the decade it is set in. Colorful and playful. The graphics are simple, even abstract at times, and all work together very well. matted neon colors, mixed with blurring effects and that Sims style that appeals to a majority of people, gamers or not, and that could part of the reasoning. Either way, the game is great eye candy even if it isn't the most realistic thing around. Not everything needs realism.


Content: 85/100 B

There's a fair amount of gameplay here and a bit more should you opt for the deluxe edition, as well a good amount of replayability, something many games like this seem to lack. There are also a good amount of visual changes you can make, like big head mode and whatnot, and customizing your ride, changing your special abilities and how you play the game in general, and you'll be left spending a lot of time just messing around with the different combinations you can make, especially in a free ride mode. Yet despite all of this, I feel like there needs to be more, more, more. Maybe I'm just being greedy and I want more reasons to play this game.


Story: 75/100 C

I don't really know what to say about the story. You play as a new limo driver who has a unique way of getting around town and you somehow managed to pass your driving test by sheer amazement. It's a goofy story that doesn't really add much, but it is fun to listen to, especially when the narrator comes in while playing or during the hilarious FMV sequences that are always welcomed and leave me smiling ear to ear. This is one of those cases where the story comes secondary to the game, but just like with Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario, did the story really matter in those games?


Design: 96/100 A+

Roundabout is a very well thought out game from the ground up. Yes, it has flaws, but it's fun. Everything from the menu and themes to the city's design, obstacles and courses, mini challenges, hell even the costume designs on the people are all very well done and fit the bill of the period. The characters are all interesting and colorful. Even Georgio's expressions are full of life with each gaze and glare that she gives. Power ups and bonuses litter the roads, just like pedestrians and their bloody remains, and there are plenty of checkpoints as you play for when you crash and die and die you will...over and over again.


Performance: 95/100 A

Overall, Roundabout ran smoothly on my pc with little to no issues in performance. I did notice that lower end specs did make certain things harder to read, but that happens to just about every game out there and even though the keyboard controls were a bit tough to get used to, the controls reacted reasonably and the way you expected them to. There are some clipping issues and collision detections here and there, but I expect those things to be patched as time goes on and that's ok.


Verdict: 90/100 A-

Roundabout is fun. I cannot emphasize that enough. Yes, the difficulty does ramp up fairly quickly, but not to the point that you don't want to keep going just to see what the next ridiculous things will happen next or who you will have to pick up as a passenger.",1425198579,1425198579,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Fun but:
- Issues resetting game state
- Poor handling of collision

Although I had fun, there are a number of things in this game that seem to show a lack of playtesting in the game's development. One of the major issues that crops up throughout the game is the incomplete resetting of game state when restarting missions - which doesn't make a whole lot of sense for a game that pushes the speedrunning element so hard. Your limo will start a mission with a different rotation depending on when you started it, missions that depend on pedestrians or a field of crops will not repopulate those when you restart, the camera will not immediately snap back to the mission start area, sometimes your limo will spawn sunken in the ground or in the air and exploding (EVERY TIME during map transitions), and a few other problems.

Other things that really reduced my enjoyment of the game include colliding with the slope the limo is sitting on, the limo sinking into the ground and colliding with a cliff I drove off because it starts falling when the center of the limo is off the ground, and cutscenes playing on mission restart and sometimes being unskippable. Also, some things stopped working until I restarted the game - missions would stop registering that I completed them with a continuous streak, and once, the menu stopped allowing me to choose anything.

Wait until it's cheap, and just play through it without going for completion or speedruns.",1424444946,1424444946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Deluxe Editionは、未公開ムービー, SoundTrack, 脚本・アートブックPDFなどがついています。
あとからDLCで購入しても合計価格はほとんど変わりませんので
ゲームをやってから検討してもいいかと思います。

The game can be divided into two parts: the gameplay and the full-motion video.

The gimmick of this game is that you are a limousine driver who is constantly rotating. Thankfully, in the town of Roundabout, all roads, cars, and other obstacles are laid out just perfectly for you to snake around to get people to their destinations. The game is as casual or as serious as you want it to be. There are lofty objectives and super-pro highscore boards, but if you explode in a fiery wreck, you'll start back up nearby in a jiffy. Additional mechanics and challenge are layered on slowly, and getting through the game I feel is pretty attainable.

The characters and video are the real delight of this game, though. Taking place in the 1970s, various employees of the developer's company don silly costumes and deliver so-bad-it's-good lines of dialog. Of note is that the player plays Georgio Manos, a silent protagonist whose primary role in the game is turning (with slight variation) from the steering wheel to see who hopped in her car. Yet she is still very compelling!

Hammy? Yep.
Self-aware? Oh yeah.
Hilarious? Georgio gets caught up in dark alleyway billionaire deals, a fierce rotating limo rivalry, budding love, and drug addiction, among many other weird scenarios. That's a yes.

But damn, this game was a blast!

You play as Georgio, a limo driver who invented a whole new style of driving: the constantly spinning style. While part of me assumed that it would just be frusterating to drive a spinning limo, it is suprisingly fun. Every turn where you don't crash feels like a great victory. Every time you dodge a moving car, a relief. Yet failing never felt that frusterating. With a very forgiving checkpoint system, Roundabout is able to keep you moving forward when it could of very easily just been flat out brutal. Truth be told, if you want a brutal challange, you can get it here too by trying to get high scores and completing every objective. But the only goal I had while playing was to get the passenger where they needed to go.

This is because of the campy and hilarious FMV cutscenes in every mission. I will be absolutely honest and admit I played this game solely for the humor and it delivered. The acting was bad in a good way. It managed to straddle the delecite line of being bad enough to be funny, but not to go over the edge to miserable. I never cringed or felt the need to mock the actors/characters in the game but rather was constantly amused by what they had to do or say. Every actor was just so earnest in the role that they played and it sold the enitre game. It helps that the story was cute as well and the perfect length.

The B-Movie style of cutscenes with atrocious acting, awful script-writing and all sorts of other 'mistakes' are worth quite a few laughs, while the gameplay of your constantly rotating limousine is tricky, challenging and save for a few instances where you'll call foul, bizarrely entertaining.

Enough time has been spent harping on the nature of Roundabout's live-action cutscenes with the comedy that it brings, so I'll merely be parroting the good points regarding the humor, acting and production quality that is all borked on purpose, which is what makes it so enjoyable (I swear, they use the same damn briefcase three or four times for different characters!). What isn't as mentioned as often is how smart Roundabout's humor is, where unlike Swery65's recent work, they're not trying too hard, reaching for jokes or bizarre moments to really try and elicit a laugh out of you when it just clearly won't work. An actress looking directly at the camera, children doing their worst (see: best) cheer for excitement, a rich man who calls just about everyone Jeeves while making rotation-based puns, there aren't many outright punchlines in Roundabout (at least as I can remember), so the numerous laughs I had came from the sheer ridiculous nature of the passengers Georgio (which is a woman's name???) picks up during her time as a rotating chauffeur. Cutscenes don't overstay their welcome even if they pop up during a mission, generally staying under one or two minutes to not keep you too long from the gameplay. The actors come in, get the point or plot (yes, they try to tell a story in this game) across, try and get a chuckle from you, and then get on with it, not pulling a Family Guy and jabbing a gag at you until the writer's get bored or you turn it off. At worst it makes the game quite amusing and at best it makes you want to press on to see which weirdo hops into the back seat next and what their deal is (and to see if they'll say 'Let's go, Georgio!' which makes me want a t-shirt of that line).

You're no doubt well-aware that you drive a rotating limousine in the game, and if you wondered if controlling such a vehicle is weird, it is... At first, that is. The entire map of the game is designed in such a way to prey upon your constantly spinning ways, but your rotation is done automatically; all you have to do is steer your ride and avoid smashing into everything along the way. Controlling your limo is nice and responsive (you'll quickly get a feel for the controls within a short amount of time) though it's far from a supercar, so changing direction instantly won't be happening which will result in bashing into a few obstacles here and there, and taking enough damage will result in a violent explosion killing you and your passenger - But you'll respawn at the last checkpoint in order to try again. Death is only a minor setback in Roundabout, where you're only penalized with lost time and not being able to get a 100% rating on your current mission. Later on you'll be able to cause your limo to jump (among other changeable upgrades), allowing you to access rooftops and other areas in order to pick up extra horns to sound off with, multipliers for your score by collecting coins and murdering civilians in cold, unpunished blood, or cash in order to purchase property for more money collection, paint jobs or hats for your vehicle. If you're not playing Roundabout for the comedy, you'll be playing it for the various elements of being a collect-a-thon (the Sick Jump tokens hidden away, cash stacks, horn unlocks), a completionist (acing every mission's objectives which isn't the easiest thing ever), a competitor (there are various challenges and mini-games with leaderboard support for your friends or the top spot), or just going through the main story which is fun all on its own.


The only major complaints I have about the game is that when you're required to push objects with your limo, it can get a little squirrely and annoying with the floaty physics, but these moments are far and few between. While the map is designed both for and against your rotating ways, finding yourself between two obstacles within close proximity can mean that nudging one will make you change rotation direction and nudge the other in quick succession, not giving you much time to recover and taking a death in the process. In most cases like this you can find an alternate, less tightly squeezed route, so you'd be actively putting yourself into challenging little moments like that. The final big issue I have is that trying to slip down cliffs or hills that specifically aren't made for your limo to drive on will result in death nine times out of ten. What happens is that your vehicle will bump against the geometry of the slope which will count as crashing into something, which will result in a few seconds of erratic twitching followed by an explosion before you can drive back onto solid, flat ground. Again, you'd be putting yourself into an instance like this, but the ensuing twitching of your limo before the kaboom makes it seem like the collision on slopes wasn't quite polished out.

Roundabout rides that line of comedy and gameplay incredibly well, being funny while also handling and playing well and having plenty to do for various forms of completion. Your replayability will stem from your desire to reign over the challenge leaderboards or to get 100% on absolutely everything or to simply just play through the story again and encounter all the bizarre people hitching a ride in the back of Georgio's limousine and how they interact with our silent protagonist. Once you get past just how utterly silly the game is, you have a very enjoyable, fun time on your hands - All while spinning on and on and on and on...",1412941548,1412941548,True,11,0,0.619805216789245605,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Il gioco in questione era Kuru Kuru Kururin e questo Roundabout, di cui mi accingo a scrivervi, è una sorta di erede spirituale su PC.

Nel gioco  vestiremo i panni di Georgio, redhead tassista ai comandi della succitata automobile oblunga e dal peculiare stile di guida: lei – o “lui”, visto che tutti si comportano come se fosse un uomo – non riesce proprio a guidare “dritto”, ma può muoversi solo in un perenne testacoda. Esatto: anche davanti a un lunghissimo rettilineo, Georgio macina chilometri solo muovendo la sua limousine come un’enorme elica.

Questa è l’idea su cui ruota (eheh, che fine gioco di parole) il gameplay di Roundabout, che sostanzialmente è una versione “leggera” del citato Kuru Kuru Kururin ambientato però in un contesto urbano. Da buon tassista, infatti, gran parte delle vostre missioni – soprattutto quelle iniziali – consiste nello scorrazzare da un punto A a un punto B un passeggero pagante. Il particolare incedere della limousine, però, renderà totalmente diverso l’approccio alle curve, ai semafori e ai diversi ostacoli rispetto a qualsiasi altro driving game. Muovendovi in senso orario – o antiorario, se colpirete gli appositi respingenti che vi faranno cambiare verso – dovrete calcolare con tempismo quando entrare in una curva, ad esempio, per evitare collisioni con mura e lampioni. Ogni tre urti, infatti, la preziosa limo esploderà in un tripudio di miccette. Più o meno.

Nulla che causi grossi problemi, comunque, visto che l’automobile spunterà come nuova presso uno dei checkpoint in cui vi imbatterete in una delle varie scorribande. La formula, in apparenza molto ripetitiva, viene però spezzata da diversi power-up in grado di facilitare le vostre azioni o addirittura far sbocciare approcci del tutto nuovi. Tra i primi è possibile citare il comodo “rallenty”, in grado di rendere Bestemmia-proof le sezioni più ardue; tra i secondi, invece, esemplare è il potenziamento per poter guidare anche sull’acqua senza affondare. Come dei novelli Gesù, ma sotto forma di limousine rotante.

Del resto “follia” è la parola d’ordine del gioco No Goblin. La trama è assurda, raccontata attraverso scenette in full motion video tanto anacronistiche quanto prive di alcun senso logico, tra riottosi meccanici, un clone di Disco Stu e uno scheletro parlante; il fattore “wtf” è potente, e costituisce certamente uno dei punti di forza e una delle maggiori cifre stilistiche di Roundabout. La colonna sonora, invece, è quasi impalpabile, limitandosi a pochi brani reiterati all’infinito e nemmeno troppo riusciti. Insomma, non si ride in Roundabout, ma si sorride con gusto.

Il level design invece è di buona fattura, offrendo il giusto compromesso tra sfida e accessibilità, tra passaggi facili ad altri ardui ma mai impossibili. C’è da dire che, a metà dell’opera, la possibilità di effettuare un “salto” rompe un po’ gli equilibri del gioco: rendendo lecita la facoltà di saltare – letteralmente – intere porzioni di strada, molti dei tranelli e trappole inserite dagli sviluppatori perdono un po’ di significato. Inoltre, più prosegue il gioco, più le situazioni tendono ad assomigliarsi, nonostante alcune missioni talmente fuori di zucca da risultare più che gradevoli. I power up, inoltre, non modificano l’economia di un gioco che non sfocia nella ripetitività solo perché ha il grande pregio di finire lì dove non resta più nulla da offrire.

In definitiva, Roundabout è un onesto puzzle game atipico, da provare almeno una volta anche solo per via del suo stile che può tanto ammaliare quanto repellere. Non è un gioco che passerà alla storia, né una sleeper hit come lo era il citato Kuru Kuru Kururin. Semplicemente, è un gioco che intrattiene senza strafare.
Alcuni non lo riterranno meritevole dei 15€ a cui è venduto su Steam, ma poco conta. I No Goblin hanno dato vita a un titolo ispirato e genuinamente divertente. Va bene così.

Gameplay: Roundabout is one of those games that sounds like it would work best as a simple Flash game. You are tasked with driving the world's first revolving limo around town, doing things that limo drivers often do. You might also think that this concept will get old rather quickly. Fortunately, that is not the case. You see, Roundabout isn't a game that is substantiated by one single gimmick. No, this game has some pretty solid level design. In fact, it becomes a bit more of an action-puzzler as time goes on, where the game becomes more about, ""How am I gonna get around this?"" Fortunately,  you do have infinite lives, and you crash and explode after four impacts with whatever it is you've crashed into. The game does try its best to keep things in sync, but sometimes you may have to throw away a life or two just to get the game to get things back in sync.

The game has a very GTA-like feel to it (by design, I would assume), and by GTA I'm talking GTA 1 and 2. It's a top-down open world kind of environment with collectables for days, so if you're a completionist, you'll have a great time with this game. 100% completion is where a lot of the gameplay time for this game will come from, as this game will only take you two to three hours to beat all the main missions. My playtime accounts for two and a half hours of doing missions plus some goofing around with the challenges. This game has nine challenges on offer which are unlocked as the game progresses, and they're for the most part pretty fun (save #9, but that's just because it's really not meant to be that enjoyable; you'll see once you unlock it).

Apart from that, I really don't have many criticisms on the gameplay front for this game. It's a game that I can see myself coming back to every now and then, that's for sure. For a very solid combination of world and level design which make very interesting use of the rotational mechanic of the limo, I'll give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay.

Story: The other big draw of this game is that this game makes liberal use of FMV. These are definitely some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, if you ask me. These cutscenes and the overarching story are written like an Airplane-esque satire of 70's movies and culture; absolutely chock full of references to various tropes, but knowledge of these references isn't necessary for enjoyment of the writing. While not necessarily being as great as Airplane (let's be honest; were we really expecting that?), it still offers up quite a lot of very funny moments. Overall, this game hits all the checkboxes for a 70's satire featuring many [b]twists and turns[/b]... *is shot*  9/10.

Graphcs: There's three big things here to talk about: the acting in the FMVs, the artstyle of the game, and the game's technical capabilities. I'll start with the acting. It really does take a lot of talent to act ""badly"", and they really did pick some good bad actors for this game. Of course, given the satirical nature of this game, ""good"" acting is out the window. So yeah, they definitely had a very solid cast for this game. As for the art style, it's pretty simplistic, but it gets the job done. Everything is brightly colored, and I never really had any difficulty picking out objects in the environment throughout my playthrough. Not too terribly memorable, but again; it's good enough to do its job. As for the technical side of this game, this game was built around Unity, so depending on how well your computer can run Unity based games, your mileage may vary. As for me with my GTX 760, I never really had any problems at all throughout this game. It does startup at 720p, which is annoying for people like me who think games should just have a one-time autodetect resolution function that activates at startup, but it's easy enough to go into the options and switch things around. There really isn't all that much that you can do with the graphical fidelity of this game, but since it's not the most graphically intensive game out there, there really isn't much point complaining about that aspect. As for how the game is optimized, it ran at about 55degC on my GPU. A bit warm, but nothing terrible. Overall, there's a lot of good stuff here on the visual front. 4/5.

Sound: Much like the physical acting, the voice acting is pretty ""terrible."" As a side note, I find it pretty funny that people were convinced that the villain's voice actor wasn't actually French, even though the voice actor (Psychedelic Eyeball) is French-Canadian. Anyways, the music is decidely disco-y and very slap bass heavy, much like the entirety of the mainstream 70's were. Definitely a soundtrack worth getting if you're into that sort of thing.

Except Roundabout isn't that, it's actually genuinely a really well designed spin-your-car-around videogame first and foremost and then there's this massive level of slick silly and polish on top of that to round it all off.

It's mainly a series of mini-trials punctuated by FMV cut scenes. Drive over a star, collect a passenger, complete the trial as fast and as cleanly as possible, ranked against your friends list for the obligatory ""I WILL BEAT YOUR SCORE"" stuff. It's a joy to move around in, it's a game you can and likely will get better at but even if you don't, the game doesn't care. You have to call up the report card yourself so you can just carry on messing around and no-one will bother you. It's a simple but wonderful solution to making what could be a really ridiculous twitchy time trial game into something much more accessible.

It drops the ball on the funny at times but it's all such a glorious bag of silly mess anyway, the odd joke misfire doesn't matter. Everyone seems to be genuinely enjoying themselves, it's that knowingly rubbish sort of FMV but it does have a message tucked inside it that's simultaneously obvious but also the sort of thing that videogames don't really tackle, especially in a silly mainstream-daft sort of way like this. That's appreciated, especially when you consider how games that tread this sort of silly route normally manage to either ignore these things or just plain get on the wrong side of it.

Innovation is something more or less absent from the game industry as we see the market pump out bland shooters, uninspired retro platformers, Diablo-likes, or roguelike-likes sticking with elements they know sell while struggling to find ideas that haven't been exhausted already. Every great once and awhile a game comes a long and changes everything capturing the hearts of players everywhere by simply presenting us with a mechanic so strange and simple yet is an absolute blast to play. A game that makes the player stop and ask ""Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?""

Roundabout is unlike any other game I've played, utilizing a concept more original since the world was graced with the likes of Katamari Damacy and its genre bending gameplay and definitely channeling that same spirit of creativity and imagination. The humorous 70's B-movie story of Georgios' epic rise to becoming the worlds most famous rotating limousine driver is told through the campaigns many quick narrative driven missions. Each twist of the story brings you to different locations on the map, with key events being triggered by large yellow exclamation points that are just as tricky to get to as the missions are to complete.

For such an out there and crazy concept Roundabout works incredibly well and plays like a dream with the swift and responsive controls of a rotating object through maze-like obstacles that is slightly reminiscent of the offbeat classic Kurukuru Kururin which spent more time in my GBA than probably any other game available for the system. Roundabout takes this concept of quick wit and extreme navigational skill to the next level, applying the quirky but obsessively fun sport of spinning to a GTA style sandbox world with an impressive map that you are free to explore at your leisure.

Don't feel like continuing the campaign? Tackle some side missions or test your skill against the world with some speedruns. Don't feel like pushing your rotating skills to the test and just want to relax? Take a spin around town and use your hard earned cash to buy various property, upgrades, and cosmetics in the form of hats and new horns! The choice is really yours, Roundabout is a sandbox with tons of possibilities offering open ended explorative gameplay that anyone can hop right into.

You'll spin your way through bright and sunny suburbs, crowded streets of the city, all the way to the snowy outskirts of the countryside all in a hilarious and dramatic journey to face down your ultimate rival and take back the title as the best spinning driver around. Finding your way to events is almost as much fun as the events themselves as you fight to go with the flow and use the rotation in your favor, bumping and crashing into everything in the process. You'll be whipping around in circles bringing your colorful cast of customers to their designated drop-off points in the fastest possible time like some sort of tweaked out Crazy Taxi.. Crazy Limo?

Roundabout has a seriously great sense of humor and tells its B-movie story in the best way possible; FMVs. Those not familiar with the long lost form of pop-culture might find this aspect of the game to be cringe-worthy, but as an old school fan of the likes of Tex Murphy, Bad Mojo, and Night Trap the style satisfies every nostalgic craving perfectly and even exceeded all of my expectations of what sort of imagery campy yet memorable FMVs are capable of.

You don't have to be a fan of FMVs to fall in love with Roundabout, though. It's a game that bursts with a style of its own, a game by people with a great sense of humor targeted towards those who don't take themselves too seriously. Its addictive and accessible obstacle course rotating action set to only the grooviest of tunes and the spiffiest of visuals.

It's a master of the sort of low budget, 70's nonsensical cheese that's so absolutely horrible in every way that it becomes hilarious despite itself, and Roundabout leverages this against a goofy mechanic to keep it from ever becoming too much to handle. As professional limousine chauffeur Georgio Manos, you must navigate the streets of Roundabout City, picking up passengers, battling the bad guys, and taking special unicorn ""medicine"" to make sure you stay the absolute best driver in the business!

But what sets Georgio apart, you ask? Her constantly revolving limo of course! With it she can traverse the windiest roads, the highest roof tops, and the most populated beaches twisting and turning around obstacles (and only killing a few thousand innocent bystanders in the process).

It's legitimately absurd, yet the act of driving a continually rotating car around these sandbox levels is surprisingly satisfying once you get a hang of the confusion, and provides a level of controlled hilarity as you attempt to navigate some of more maze like environments and inevitably wind up crashing into things along the way. The lack of any penalties for completely wrecking your car keeps the frustration away, and the game simply becomes a lot of goofy fun as you drive/crash your way through the surprisingly large environments collecting all manor of limo swag and miscellaneous stacks of money left lying around as you go from one crazy mission to the next.

What really makes Roundabout so great though is the sheer ridiculous of its FMV cutscenes, which are so incessantly outrageous and over the top that it's hard not to laugh and groan  at them in equal measure. There's a look and feel to them all that's almost like watching your friend's bad homemade movie, laughing at all the wrong places and loving it for the wrong reasons. Only in this instance Roundabout it in on the joke and laughing right along with you.

If there was anything I could say against Roundabout (aside from the disappointing performance issues that will hopefully be fixed in a patch), is that once you get through the FMV in about 3 hours, the novelty of a rotating limo has all but entirely worn off and there's really little more for you to go back to. It's a great ride if you can appreciate it for what it is, but even as someone who greatly enjoyed it the ticket price still seems a tad higher than it maybe ought to be. If by chance you actually have an aversion to FMV and B-movie stupidity, I'd be surprised if you come away from Roudabout with anything but a confused look on your face, wondering what you just witnessed and why I'm raving about it.

To that I say, phooey on you!

Have you ever dreamed of taking a stretch limo, and doing circles until the tires fell off? I sure as hell didn’t but now that’s all I want to do and no thanks to freshman developer No Goblin and their first game, Roundabout. On the surface, Roundabout is kind of easy to explain but the nuances in the game play elevate it above your standard limousine spinning game.

It is 1977 and you take the wheel as silent limo driver, Georgio Manos. I never understood why she never speaks but it does make for some awkwardly funny moments between her and her passengers. Yes, Georgio is a female. A gorgeous one at that, but that’s neither here nor there. Skipping any kind of real introduction, the game starts right off with your driving lesson. I breezed right through the lesson, with a whopping 50% and not meeting any of the objectives. Still passed though. From then on out its nothing but semi-controlled chaos.

Spinning ( and jumping…yes, jumping ) through tight streets and hairpin turns is challenging and you tend to die a lot. And I mean a lot. But the low success rate does not hinder the fun of the game at all. In such an open world game that is driven by streak based scoring and challenges, like trying to bounce a soccer ball on the roof of the limo as many times as you can or staying clear of as many falling cars as possible, its hard to get mad a the constant dying.

You are a limo driver so it should be a no brainer that part of the game is chauffeuring a zany pack of characters around town. These riders are one of the best aspects of the game due to the hilarious live-action cut scenes, filled with actors I assume are No Goblin staff, friends, and family. The kids are my favorite. Not to mention the tender moments between Georgio and a certain female passenger. See, this game even has a love story! The scenes have a very Troma Entertainment feel to them ( given studio head Dan Teasdale’s involvement with Lloyd Kaufman, its no surprise ).

Roundabout is just a ridiculous game. Everything from the funky 70s music to the smooth spinning and fiery explosions. Its rare to see a game be so outlandish but work so well at the same time. I skipped over a lot of the other wacky things this game has to offer in this review but my suggestion is to plop down the $15 ( $12 during the launch week ) and get yourself a copy. Now.

Buy Roundabout

QUICK TIP – If you have a xbox or playstation controller, use it. The game is much easier. You will still probably suck, just a fraction less.

The Breakdown:

Story – 3/5
I only got to 12% but I could feel something developing.

Visuals – 4/5
Its not real life but its a video game through and through.

Gameplay – 4/5
Its fun. And isnt that what video games should be?

Sound – 5/5
The music alone deserves 5 stars. Also, between the pedestrian screams and sweet sound of crashing and exploding, it has top notch sound design

Entertainment – 5/5
I played for hours without any sense of time. Most of the time I was grinning from ear to ear.

Replay – 4/5
Unless you are some spinning badass, it will take a couple replays to complete the game. And I could see this becoming a party game. Easy to challenge your friends.

How would you feel about becoming the world’s first rotating limo driver? Running people over? Driving underwater? Playing Soccer using cars? These are all things one can do in Roundabout- it’s so unlike every game we’ve seen before and doesn’t really fit nicely into a genre due to its uniqueness- and yet, unfortunately, I’m not sure its best efforts are quite enough to make it a good game.

The dialogue and character design is actually quite good. Granted, nearly every line of dialogue will melt your brain a little bit, but that’s what they were going for, that charming B-movie feel… and they nailed it. The team did a fantastic job and definitely invoked the comedic feel they were going for- players will be chuckling to themselves as they progress due to the effective comedy one can find in Roundabout. The narrative and method of delivering narrative (video clips) are definitely one of the game’s main strengths.

As for the gameplay, driving around a constantly-spinning limousine is about as fun and difficult as it sounds. Trying to drive around a city picking up powerups, running over pedestrians to increase your score multiplier, and doing your gosh-darned best to avoid other vehicles and various obstacles the game throws at you is an exhilarating experience. It’ll leave you breathless and desperately asking for more. About an hour and a half into the game, you’re given the ability to jump, which pretty much turns the madness meter up to 11.

Unfortunately, not everything is well in the world of Roundabout- this is one of those games that seems faultless for the first hour or so, but then reveals its inner flaws as time goes on. Think of it as a bag of trail-mix… plenty of candy, but also lots of disappointing elements mixed into the bag- and that’s perhaps one of the best ways of describing Roundabout- a mixed bag of good and bad elements.

For starters, the game is missing basic features that should have been at the foundation of its game design. A lot of the flaws are actually very strange, considering the obvious thought and care that’s gone into producing it. For example, Roundabout‘s options menu having 4 separate audio sliders to allow a lot of customization in the way the game sounds,  but missing the ability to rebind keys… a basic setting that every game should have.

Another issue with Roundabout actually has to do with the way rotation is implemented, and how it affects the player. Unfortunately, there are no invincibility frames after being hit… which, frankly, doesn’t make sense. It’s very possible to become wedged between two objects, taking the five hits and exploding, within a second or two. This issue becomes particularly apparent when jumping is introduced as a major gameplay element- one bad jump and you’re dead, as landing in a bad spot and becoming wedged will unmercifully kill you in a matter of seconds. Luckily, respawning is generally a quick process, though sometimes the respawn locations are mediocre and cause an annoying loss of progress.

The biggest issue Roundabout is faced with is its world design. One of the most important aspects of any video game is its world/level design, and unfortunately- this is seriously lacking here. A well-designed world has several characteristics: it should be living, breathing, immersive, and larger than the player. Unfortunately, the world of Roundabout has none of those things; Nothing in Roundabout feels alive, it’s like you’re the only person that actually matters and everything is there simply for your amusement. Rather than creating an immersive, living world, they’ve created an amusement park with only one person in it- the player.

Sure, there are cars driving around and pedestrians sitting around, but nobody actually DOES anything. The cars you’ll see with either be driving in a looped circle around a roundabout or moving forwards then backwards in a straight line… nobody’s GOING anywhere or doing anything. The pedestrians just sit around, waiting to be killed (though they will try to run away if you’re going to run them over) and you’ll never REALLY encounter another vehicle that’s driving anywhere in particular. Everything in the whole wide world is merely there for your sake, to make driving around more difficult or interesting.

That seems to be a reoccuring issue with Roundabout- it’s all about this illusion that you matter, your actions matter, they have an impact- but they really don’t… and that’s not even all of the issues Roundabout has! Stability problems, poorly thought out purchase options (the land available for purchase, which generates money over time… but you have to drive back to them all in order to actually get any of it), similar minigames at different places… I could go on, but we’ll leave it at that.

At the end of the day, Roundabout showed a TON of promise and potential- but it’s plagued with so many issues that hold it back from being a great (or even a good) game. As it is right now, Roundabout is fairly mediocre… and that’s really unfortunate. It had a lot going with it due to the interesting method of delivering its comedic narrative and novel gameplay- but that opportunity is wasted due to all of the issues it has… ESPECIALLY due to the effectively “dead” world you’re in throughout the experience… which really ruins the illusion of actions having impact. If you still want to pick up the game and give it a try yourself- go right ahead. Roundabout has a lot of issues, but it has a lot of great stuff to its name too… so if you’re not bothered by anything I’ve mentioned, this game could be just right for you. Otherwise, it’d probably be best to wait for a sale sometime down the line.

[b]Bottom Line:[/b] If you're willing to overlook all of the issues Roundabout is plagued with, it may be a worthwhile buy. Unfortunately, due to its ""dead"" world with only a quickly vanishing illusion that your actions matter in the slightest (among its other issues) it might be worthwhile to hold off until a sale comes around.

Don’t go and expect a deep game, because Roundabout doesn’t take itself seriously, not even for one moment, and that’s its biggest appeal and the reason why it is such fun. This is one of the reasons that I play games.

If you take a second to look at the screenshots you might think you’re dealing with a Crazy Taxi clone here, only shown from an isometric perspective. But I’m glad to say that you couldn’t be more wrong. In Roundabout you control a limousine (driven by a female driver named Georgio Manos) that spins around. Always and all the time. This makes navigating through the streets damn hard, but oh so much fun. And it’s the essence of Roundabout.
You’ll die frequently while playing this (not literally), especially later in the game when there are even more objects to avoid. Dying doesn’t really have a penalty; you just spawn at a checkpoint. The checkpoint system could’ve been implemented at bit better, because sometimes you spawn very close to where you died and sometimes the game takes you more than a few steps back. This is random; I had times where I would die at the same spot and respawn at totally different places. Small annoyance, but nothing frustrating and it certainly didn’t make the game any less fun.
There’s lots of stuff to do in the city/world of Roundabout, but your main objective is to pick up passengers and bring them to a specific location. Along the way you can pick up coins that will increase your multiplier. Bring your customer to their location unharmed (well, the limousine shouldn’t be destroyed is what it actually means) and you’ll earn a nice amount of money in return. But hit something along the way and the combo is lost. You can also stand still if you think you’re about to hit something and that way bank the combo instead. The money can be used to buy cosmetic things like a different limousine skin, hats (for on your limousine) or horns. Or you can buy some properties that will eventually make you more money to buy even more stuff.
Contrary to what you would expect is that Roundabout is an open world game. Meaning you can go anywhere you please and take on any job you want. There’s no set order. Discovering the world at your own pace makes the game so much better. Whenever you’re not taking on missions you can drive around and find hidden collectibles, do some challenges, find more cash, try to complete challenges in order to unlock more power-ups, buy properties and even perform crazy jumps  (yes, you get the ability to jump after a little while). And this brings me to the power-ups that you can equip, but bear in mind that most of these have to be unlocked by completing a certain objective, like running over 2500 people, or hitting a certain amount of traffic cones. But anyway, you can eventually unlock a boat to drive over water, a tool to make your limousine smaller or a weapon that shoots traffic cones. There are more power-ups to unlock and they’re usually quite handy. So it’s only logical that you have to work a little for it. During your first playthrough you’ll probably use the slow motion power-up the most. It does exactly what it says and it allows you to drive easier on busy roads.
Missions can be finished in one way, but each mission has a set of objectives that range from ‘don’t hit anything’ or ‘don’t explode’ to ‘collect every coin’ and ‘don’t use power-ups’.  Completing these objectives affect the rating you’ll get at the end of each mission. If you want to 100% the game you have to complete all of them. Some are relatively easy and some are harder than you might think.
Each mission starts and ends with a FMV movie, and sometimes one is triggered halfway through a mission, or at a checkpoint. Okay, so it’s basically quite random. 
The actors and actresses in these little clips are terrible at acting, but they do this intentionally. These could be people randomly picked up from the streets, I don’t know. It’s so cheesy and corny that at the same time it’s also very funny. And some of these spoken lines (actors and narrator) really are funny. The movies give the game an identity of its own, which is a smart thing to do when you start a new IP like this.

The graphics are cartoony and use a lot of bright colors. Textures are sharp but not extremely detailed and the engine runs at a solid 60fps. There is a bit of stutter when the FMVs start though, but this doesn’t happen all the time fortunately.
The voice acting is cheesy and mediocre, but as I said, this was done on purpose. Same goes for the acting. The sound effects are relatively basic with people screaming, cars crashing and explosions. No big effects here. The music has a 70s funky/soul vibe to it and this is exactly the vibe the game is aiming for, since it’s set in the 70s.

Unfortunately this isn’t a very long game and if you speedrun through it I guess it could be completed within 90 minutes. But you’ll probably just enjoy the story and if you take your time, occasionally going out of your way to collect and buy stuff, then this game could easily take you 4 hours or more. I finished the game around 40% (about 4 hours of playtime), so 10 hours total playtime would be a fair guess if you ask me. Considering the price of the game this is more than enough content. And there are still the standalone challenges that you can play to earn a place on the Leaderboards.

Roundabout is nothing short of excellent. I had an amazing time with it and I wish it was longer, with even more missions to complete. It’s become an insanely fun game meant for young and old gamers alike and you owe it to yourself to buy (and play) this. You won’t be disappointed, believe me.
Now, where’s my approval stamp ?
