No motion controller support, you have to teleport everywhere, or walk by making ONE step per button pressed (?!) 
No ability to interact with objects manually. If you want to open the door, you can’t take the handle and open it, you have to point at the door with the laser and press a button. If you want to take an object you need to, again, point at it, press the button, then it hovers above your controller and then disappears in your chest somewhere.

На моей памяти только в The Station история, поданная таким образом, захватила, люди там казались реально живыми.
Также контроллы. Работают вроде нормально, но назначены, как-то странновато. Движение и взаимодействие оба на триггер, в зависимости от контекста, и попробуй отойди от мусорки, а не щелкай крышкой.
Тем не менее, игра большая, проработанная, многодетальная, красиво и тщательно сделана. Там есть движущиеся люди, и они тоже хорошо выглядят. Если не торопишься, можно вникать и размышлять.

All PC specs meet or exceed requirements for VR. I wanted to play this game using VR so I did not try it out in non-VR, although it appears that it would be more enjoyable in playing without VR. I'm looking for titles that will allow me to justify my VR purchase so that it will get used and not just become a novelty gathering dust in a closet. I am a longtime player of graphics type adventures games, (Former Sierra On-Line employee). I purchased this game as the premise looked very promising. Unfortunately, movement in the game is very slow and navigating around in the environment is cumbersome at best. Also, the lack of instructions in respects to moving around in the game doesn't help. What it takes 5 minutes to accomplish in VR could easily be done in 30 seconds in non-VR using a mouse/keyboard. Game play in VR should be easier and more intuitive than using a mouse and keyboard, such as it is with games like Vader Immortal. Examples of issues I encountered: when you are playing as Pearson and the game suggests that you answer the phone, I spent 10 minutes trying to find the phone finally realizing there was no handset. Answering the phone shouldn't be a puzzle.  The next issue I encountered was in trying to put the sample under the microscope, I retrieved it from the fridge, but somehow dropped it and it disappeared, which means you can't complete the next step. The vial should have either shown up on the floor where it could be picked back up or reappeared back in the fridge. It is a great effort on the part of the company and maybe I'll try it again at a later date when I have more experience with VR, but as of right now it 's too slow and cumbersome to justify my time, (especially the time) and money.

It can be played in VR or as a regular non-VR game - this review is meant for the latter, as I do not have the equipment for the former.

The story contains two alternating plots that barely intersect, both focusing on ""The Assembly"", a secret group of brilliant maverick scientists who do self-funded research without governmental control or supervision. One plot revolves around a scientist who has been ""invited"" to join the group, but needs to solve trials to prove herself - these start with simple logical puzzles, and then turn into moral dilemmas to explore her personality. The second plot follows one of the scientists in The Assembly, who discovers that something is going dangerously wrong, collects evidence, and tries to flee and inform the authorities. Both plots touch on the ethics, chances, and risks of scientific research and progress. While neither goes very deep, these topics kept the game interesting and engaging for me. Some of your choices affect the ending of the game, and you can later revisit single chapters to make a different choice, see a different ending, or search for collectibles that you may have missed.

Many puzzles require a bit of thought and an eye for spotting relevant information in the environment, but they remain easy throughout the game. They succeeded in keeping me engaged without distracting from the story - this game is obviously intended to be immersive rather than challenging.

Graphics are crisp and fitting for a facility that mostly consists of various laboratories, offices, and a few living rooms. Sound effects are okay, though the game sometimes processes them in a weird way - start to play with a Newton's cradle in one room, and you can still here its clacking noise 50m away and through several walls. The voice acting stands out for its exceptional quality, the actors have interesting voices and deliver their lines very believably.

Unfortunately the game insists on WASD movement and does not feature key remapping. I wouldn't consider this a dealbreaker since you never need to move precisely or react quickly, you can get by with just using the forward key and the mouse. But it's definitely annoying that such a basic and for many players important QoL feature was overlooked.

I recommend the game to players who like story-driven adventure games without action elements, and who like to think about the risks and chances of science. However, the price seems a bit high for the amount of content it offers, especially if you have no use for the VR version.

I'm under the impression this game was mostly developed before motion controls were 'a thing' - and that's why the motion controller support that was added is simply point-n-click (as in you point a laser point at a drawer, click, and the drawer slides open).

Pros:
Nice visuals
Easy puzzles/some are actually fun
Interesting concept
nice parts to the story
Very nice leaderboard at the end to compare yourself to other players (a very nice touch to this type of genre!)

Cons:
very tedious fetch gameplay (whether it's ""discovering"" passwords or finding a key)
some very boring puzzles
poor mechanics, poor POV in spots
teleporting everywhere
most of the story is drab, you have no reason to care for either of the characters you play, the AI is more interesting and it's got a very short narrative on the AI
your choices don't really matter
game crashed once, had to restart whole level, also had trouble starting on Oculus Rift (had to exit and come back to Steam for it to properly start)

Nuetral:
voice acting is okay
game ran smooth other than problems noted above
not too long or short

you can move forward but it's jagged (but at least the option is there, unlike other VR games!)

Eine absolute Empfehlung!

The Assembly ist ein spannendes Adventure, ganz ohne physische Gewalt. Getragen von einer interessanten Geschichte, in der man in mehreren  Kapiteln zwischen zwei Protagonisten hin und her tauscht. Man interagiert mit Computern und es gibt diverse Puzzle zu lösen. Es sind mindestens zwei unterschiedliche Enden zu erspielen. Das Ende, dass ich bei meinem ersten Durchgang gesehen habe, könnte für mich nach einem zweiten Teil aussehen .... aber das sind sicherlich nur Wunschgedanken.

Es gibt bisher nicht viele Adventure-Spiele dieser Art im VR-Bereich, dass dieses dann auch noch komplett in deutscher Sprache spielbar ist macht es fast schon zu einem Pflichtkauf. Die deutschen Sprecher sind sehr gut ausgewählt und klingen professionel. Endlich mal ohne Untertitel spielen zu können ist schön, zumal Untertitel in VR immer etwas störend sind. 

Die Einführung in die Geschichte ist allerdings etwas irritierend. Der Spieler bekommt diese in der Egoperspektive erzählt und da der Protagonist dort in einem Rollstuhl sitzt, während man selbst steht, kann es vorkommen, dass man auch mal durch den Rolli durchläuft o.ä.
 
Die Grafik ist aber passend und man fühlt sich schnell im Geschehen. Es gibt leider ein Problem mit der Kolisionsabfrage von Wänden, dadurch ist es möglich durch Wände zu gucken, indem man seinen Kopf reinsteckt oder Roomscale ausnutzt. Allerdings kann man dadurch nur in andere Räume reinsehen, aber nicht mit Dingen dort interagieren. Das geht nur, wenn es auch ""offiziel"" Zutritt zu diesem Raum gibt.
 
 Die Steuerung ist o.k.. Leider gibt es keine Free Locomotion per Pad, nur Teleportation und ein etwas unnützes Blinken. Da könnte noch nachgebessert werden. Spielbar ist die Teleportsteuerung auf jeden Fall und irgendwann merkt man das nicht mehr so sehr. Zumal man sich in seinem Spielbereich ja bewegen kann.

 Die Interaktionen könnten natürlich, wie in jedem VR-Spiel, noch vielfältiger sein, aber das könnte dann auch nur von der Story ablenken. 
Vorsicht vor Mülleimern - ich bin des öfteren an diesen festgehangen - besonders, wenn sie neben Türen stehen.

Aber nichts desto trotz ein hervorragendes Spiel!

The Assembly by nDreams is a short adventure game with an interesting narrative style. An absolute recommendation!

The Assembly is a thrilling adventure game without any physical violence. Carried by an interesting story, in which you switch between two protagonists in several chapters. You interact with computers and there are several puzzles to solve. There are at least two different endings to play. The end I saw on my first run could look like a second part to me .... but that's surely just wishful thinking.

There are not many adventure games of this kind in the VR area, but the fact that this one is completely playable in German language makes it almost a must buy. The German speakers are very well selected and sound professional. Finally being able to play without subtitles is nice, especially since subtitles in VR are always a bit annoying. 

However, the introduction to the story is a bit irritating. The player is told the story in ego perspective and since the protagonist is sitting in a wheelchair while you are standing, it can happen that you walk through the wheelchair or similar.
 
But the graphics are appropriate and you quickly feel you are in the action. Unfortunately there is a problem with the colliding detection of walls, so it is possible to look through walls by sticking your head inside or using roomscale. But you can only look into other rooms, but not interact with things there. This is only possible if there is ""official"" access to this room.
 
 The controls are ok. Unfortunately there is no Free Locomotion per pad, only teleportation and a somewhat useless flashing. This could be improved. The teleportation control is playable in any case and at some point you won't notice that much anymore. Especially since you can move around in your playing area.

 The interactions could of course be even more varied, as in any VR game, but that could then only distract from the story. 
Beware of trash cans - I often get stuck on them - especially when they are next to doors.

But nevertheless an excellent game!

With all of the wave shooters you see on the store for VR, I think this is a pretty great game.

Yes it is pretty slow paced and not challenging, but at least it's a relaxing experience. The environments are very detailed and realistic. Graphics overall are superb. Audio is pretty realistic sounding too. I only have two negatives. One, the people are really short and child-like. I think this is supposed to be a seated experience but it feels wrong not standing up. It's funny because everything in the environment feels normal when standing so I think just the AI people are incorrectly porportioned. 

The biggest 'issue' with this game, and the reason I don't really play it, is because it doesn't run well on my computer. My rx480 isn't the most powerful card out there and is pretty low end for VR but this is one of the only titles I've had issues with. Very choppy experience, and I don't see anywhere to change graphics settings. Eventually I will upgrade the graphics card and this game will be one of the first I get back to playing.

The Assembly is an adventure game with a modern day storyline.

You alternate between two different characters’ story paths: A research scientist who works at The Assembly, and an applicant who is being tested by The Assembly. You take turns playing each character as the plot thickens and their stories converge.

Throughout the game you’ll be engaging in puzzles, item hunting, and moral choices. I think this game was originally made for flatscreens and then later adapted for VR, because you use the motion controllers like laser pointers whenever interacting with objects. But I actually don’t mind that in this game, since you’ll be searching through a lot of cabinets and containers looking for items and clues, and the laser pointer control scheme helps speed that up.

This was one of the first VR adventure games I bought, and I have a real soft spot for it. The voice acting is exceptional, all of the character performances feel genuine and I feel involved in each of their stories. 

And even though the story exists in the world of scientific research, I could follow along with the plot and was able to understand everything that was going on.

I’ve played through this game 3 times, I find it a lot of fun, it’s one of my favorite adventure games. The first time I played this it took me almost 5 hours to beat. 

The regular price is $30, but it routinely goes on sale for $15.
If you like narrative adventure games then I highly recommend it. It’s a real hidden gem.",1493395536,1519845002,True,9,0,0.516918361186981201,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is one of a new breed of indie games which delph into more serious and adult topics which borders on philosophical, making gaming an infinitely more cerebral experience which feels so much less passive and far more intellectually engaging.

The Assembly sees the player take two roles - two characters whose paths are intertwined, both based in the Assembly, an elite and secretive research society where science appears to bypass ethical and moral boundaries, and whose funding seems to be infinite. New employees are kidnapped and have to pass tests before earning the lucrative position, and if they reject it, have their brain wiped of memory of the entire incident before being returned to the real world.

The player is one such, Madeleine Stone, and an existing employee, Caleb Pearson, whose destinies play a vital role in the future of the organisation.

The Assembly is primarily built for VR, but keyboard and mouse works perfectly even if the gameplay and interactivity levels are limited - it works seamlessly, and it really is more of a story with some puzzles and button pressing. It also looks pretty good for an indie game, employing the very solid UE4. And the voice acting? Best I've heard in a video game - the main two protagonists are beautifully voiced, and the supporting cast isn't bad either.

The plot isn't easy to digest; it is deliberately a bit more highbrow than most video games, and a bit of knowledge of science jargon will definitely help; this is a game for a specific audience - most Joe and Jane Punters will not get this, and that is no insult to their intelligence. But if you do grasp where the story is going it'll grip you endlessly, and you'll be captivated to the end.

It's not the longest game, weighing in at about 4 hours, and is a bit pricey for that length, but the sheer quality does compensate for this with essentially a level of production which verges on AAA.

It's not for everyone - with some psychology, science, philosophy, ethical and moral questions in there, but if these themes appeal to you this will be for you.

So I will start with the good things about this game.  The graphics are great! really some of the best I've seen in VR yet.  The Voice acting is really good and the sound is great.  

So now with the problems I have with this game.  First off it's painfully ovbvious it is a port into VR from your standard point and click computer adventure game.  When I'm playing VR I want to feel like I'm really there.  I want to be able to pick up and manipulate everything, like  in the Gallery, or SVRVIE or Chair in a room.   It really takes away from the immersion when you can only kind of interact with items that are highlighted with certian icons when your pointer from your motion controller passes over it.  

Speaking of Motion controllers.  the locomotion system is terrible.  I cannot tell you how many times I would teleport into the middle of a wall.  It feels like the developers were like, ""Dang, we put all this time into this game and no one likes the locomotion so lets through in a quick teleport patch and not test it out to appease the masses.""  Also they don't work well with the puzzles.  

Speaking of puzzles or game play,.. you spend your time in this game as two different characters.  The male characters game play, which is the bulk of the game, consists of opening drawers and lockers, reading emails and answering phones.  seriously,.. that's pretty much it.  the voice overs tell you everythiing you need to do and it's linear as hell and just boring.  I do all of those things every day at work.  The female's part of the game is a series of ""puzzles"" you need to solve.  One in particular involves moving these large floating cubes around with this joy stick,. only you don't actually grab the joy stick,.. you are supposed to use your thumb pad which is maddening because no matter which controller I used trying to get the cubes to move to the right was down right impossible.  or trying to move a highlighted number to the right on a key pad.  Did I mention the controls were just terrible in this game.  There was one puzzle where you had to walk around and solve this who done it type of murder mystery by listening to tapes opening drawers and reading emails... Ok now that I think about it it wasn't that great either. 

The story was also just boring as hell.  a bit preachy at times.   There is just no way that this game is worth 30 bucks.  I bought it when it was on sale for a pretty substantial amount after they ""fixed"" the control and locomotion issues.  seriously  maybe 5 bucks,.. there are just so many other games out there that are miles above this one.  pretty graphics just don't cut it when virtually everything else in the game sucks.

OK I didn't really go into the reasons I found this story so terrible for the whole spoiler factor for any one that didn't heed my warning and want to play this game any way so if you are reading and don't want the whole thing spoiled stop reading now.  

First off,. aftter 8 years of med school and 20 years of private practice this story certainly did not go over my head.  It was just that the whole ""evil greedy corporation bioenginering pathogens to spread to an unsuspecting population through natural vectors like birds, monkeis, bugs, zombies, you name it""  has be done to death and if you are going to use that narrative at least make it interesting.   there were never any consequences for this and all you did was walk around and dig through file cabinets and read emails.  there was no suspence, no action, you would think that at least the security cameras that followed you around would alert the higher ups that you were up to something,.. messing with there ""amazing"" artificially intellegent main frame and all.  but no big deal there.   Carry on.  

Second,. What the hell was up with  those terrible, simplistic puzzles?  I mean really.  If this deep cover operation that employs only ninjas,.. (ok maybe they were some kind of filtration mask,. that eveyone wore every where,. or maybe a cheap way to not have to animate mouths) really wants to test their applicants to see how smart they are,. why woud they give them a bunch of easy grade school level test to perform?  And another thing,. why for the ever loving fuck, did this corporation build these GIANT freaking rooms do to test that could easily be done on a laptop?   That is just not a very good use of resources for your evil plans.

Great story, extremely geek oriented, moral choices during the game and well... I'm sad the game is ended to be honest, not because it's short (to be a VR game it's quite long) but because I was totally involved into the story and honestly I hope in sequels or DLCs, so many side stories inside.

-----

Bought it after the handtracking support update, as I'm a Vive owner. What a game and what a graphics! It's basically a sort of point and click adventure, but for VR. The story seems extremely interesting, with good dialogues and voices, and english subtitles are activable if needed (please, consider to translate at least subtitles in many languages).

The roomscale use and the whole button assignment for Vive wands need some work, as the game was built over sitting + pad interface. But it's very easy to forgive this, with a such quality! Lots of interactive objects, pointing and activating instead grabbing like Job Simulator, but you can open any door or drawer.

Finally a real adventure for VR, and a good one.

Concernant The Assembly,

Perso j’ai trouvé le jeu très correct, jolis graphiquement (le mode VR doit bien rendre) et l’histoire est bonne. L’alternance entre les 2 personnages est bien réussie et nous en apprend plus sur cette société secrète qu’est l’Assembly.

Il est vrais que certains pourrons trouver le jeu un peu chère pour ça durée je le concède (3 a 5h selon comment on y joue) mais pour cela attendez une solde ;D

Returned this game for a refund as it didn't support my gamepad which works with all the other games I have.  Such a shame that a game that claims to be built for VR doesn't support the Vive controllers.  Should it ever do in the future I'll consider re-buying.  

I also consider the additional £5 for the VR unlock a bit of a slap in the face of the VR community.  If the game was primarily designed for VR but you are also looking to subsidise the development costs by selling into the 2D market place them why not reduce the cost to half way between the two and have one standard product that works on both.  VR players have already had to shell out a considerable amount on their hardware without having to pay a premium to unlock VR capability in a game that was designed to support it from the beginning!

That said, plug in a 360 controller and it doesn't take long to become emersed in this title. It is clearly a big step up from much of the early bird stuff we've seen until now - an actual games studio producing a tentative step into the VR world. I still think it's only a first taste of what is possible, but at the very least a good first sip nonetheless.

- Durée de jeu : bon soyons clairs, le jeu se finit facilement en 3h00 max. Et encore, en prenant vraiment le temps de tout bien explorer comme il faut, en prenant une douche et en mangeant sa pizz' sur l'écran pause pendant la moitié du temps imparti...
- L'histoire : j'avais trouvé l'histoire vraiment accrochante au début, mais comment peut-on creuser ce genre de sujet en si peu de temps?

Et même sans cela, au début on est largué dans un univers, plutôt noyés par les informations, chose qui ne s'accorde pas quand l'histoire se dénoue en si peu de temps.
- Les ""Enigmes"" et ""Puzzles"" : si vous êtes fans des jeux d'énigmes franchement sur celui-là vous ne risquez pas de vous cassez les dents... d'une simplicité décevante. 
- Les Choix : pour moi un choix est fait pour être sanctionné d'une conséquence... Mais pas dans The Assembly! Ne pensez pas qu'on se retrouve dans les locaux d'une organisation en pouvant sauver ou tuer des tas de gens juste à cause de nos choix! Ben non! Non... Simplement non, non pas ici...
- Et forcément quand on a autant d'inconvénients le derniers et pas des moindres reste le PRIX: 19,99e!

A tester si vous en avez l'occasion, en VR, en ayant conscience de sa petite durée de jeu. Mais ne faîtes pas comme moi, attendez qu'il soit soldé ou que quelqu'un vous l'offre :D!

Well, for a ""walking simulator"" it's quite serviceable.
As is usually the case in these games, you spend most
of the time walking around, inspecting different items while looking
for the handful of specific ones that will let you move on to the
next area. It's par for the course and works like you'd expect.
The game also has some simple but neat puzzle solving sprinkled in
to break up the monotony, which is a welcome distraction when it occurs.

Presentation isn't bad, with clean graphics and some ""hit or miss"" voice acting.
The story is interesting enough, relatively speaking, if somewhat slow.
It's nowhere near as profound as it presents itself as, but - given what else is out
on the VR platforms right now, it could have been a lot worse and still came out
better than most of it's competitors.

As a VR game on the whole, however, it's not much to celebrate.

For the most part, it uses a crosshair in the middle of your sights to target things,
much like you would choose a scene in Oculus Dreamdeck.
Sadly, there is no way to decouple the HMD movement from your virtual body,
so moving around never feels natural.
There is also no support for VIVE motion controllers, even though the simple 3-button control
scheme could easily have been mapped to one of the wands.
The developer cites ""VR parity"" as the reason for this, and have said that they will not be
implementing support for those controllers.

Which brings me to the elephant in the room, of course.
nDreams have received plenty of feedback (most of it bad) regarding
their pricing model on the Steam forums - and while the company servbot, JennyB,
keeps rehashing a canned response (when she should have been apologizing instead)
about how the higher priced VR bundle is actually the base game,
that doesn't change the fact that we are charged a de facto premium
compared to playing the game in 2D.
This looks especially poor given the engine the game is built on,
and how the bare-bones VR implementation suggests that they've
simply just unticked the ""VR checkbox"" in Unreal4.

So, you know. The day a publisher makes a game's ""ultra"" graphics settings a paid DLC (since that's
something not everyone will be able to enjoy) you'll know who to thank for setting that precedent.

Durch diese Teilung der Geschichte lernt man die beiden Aspekte der geheim agierenden Organisation kennen.
Das krude innere und das freundliche ""äußere"", wenn neue Leute eingestellt werden sollen.

Insgesamt bietet The Assembly einige gute Rätsel. Diese sind nicht zu schwer zu lösen, machen aber Spass.
Die Bewegungssteuerrung ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, da man mit dem X-Box Controller entweder läuft (ruckartig in sehr kleinen Schritten) oder sich portieren kann (meist die bessere Wahl). Beim portieren sieht man den eigenen Charakter wo und wie er stehen wird, allerdings steht man trotzdem immer nur in der aktuellen Blickrichtung. Das ist etwas Schade, dass man sich hier nicht entsprechend der ""Holo-Figur"" auch gleich aufstellt.

Das Spiel löst Motion Sickness meiner Meinung nach vollkommen durch die Arten der Fortbewegung, auch wenn dies noch nicht ideal funktioniert.

Fazit:
Das Spiel kann ich uneingeschränkt allen empfehlen, die eine Popcorn-Kino-Story und ein paar Rätsel mögen. Die Umsetzung ist insgesamt super, die Geschichte wird gut erzählt und man fühlt sich in den Episoden der Personen gut herein versetzt.

-Excellent graphics, lots of attention to detail which helps immerse you in the setting; A large science facility.
- An interesting story that is presented via, notes recording, emails and conversations. The voice work is well done, all in service of inhabiting the different characters perspectives.
-  Movement system provides a choice between traditional fps controls or a blink\teleport system so that you can play in the fashion you feel most comfortable with. 
-Gameplay follows standard adventure game conventions, interact with objects and clues, and search spaces to find answers. This is mixed with the aforementioned puzzle sections which so far include spatial puzzles known as “trials”
Conclusion:
If you are looking for something a bit deeper that 8th wave shooter clone, the Assembly fits the bill. Right now many of the VR games on the market amount to glorified tech demos and the Assembly is a welcome change of pace. The biggest praise I can give it, is this game would stand on its own without the VR elements, but I’m glad that they are there as they add to experience and really help you to inhabit the view points of the main characters.

(OLD REVIEW)The following has been fixed:

Unplayable mess on my Vive. I meet more than the system expecations and I'm getting nothing but missed frames. I've tried on two systems so far. 

I'll hold on to the game and change my review if it is fixed within a reasonable amount of time. But for now, no go.

I also don't understand why I had to pay $10 extra for VR support when it's supposedly a VR game. 

I understand if it was a game like ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" which was origninally a non-vr game. I'll gladly support that and pay extra since they put in EXTRA work to port their game over.
