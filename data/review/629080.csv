The plot was good, the voice acting was probably the best I've heard in a HOG, and the mini-games and HOG scenes were decent.  Take note, however, that many of the HOG scenes were the type where you are shown the silhouette of an item.  Personally, I hate that type because it can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine what the item is simply based on its overall shape.  Also, several of the mini-games weren't really games at all, but were simply 'click here, here, and here', 'trace this line', etc.  In the end, it kept me entertained for about 10 hours, so I'd say it was money well spent.

Note that there are achievements, but they seem to be in-game achievements only, not Steam achievements.  One of the things I really liked about this game was that after you finish the game, you can go into the Extras menu to finish the collectibles hunt (find collectibles you missed while playing the game) and to replay hidden object scenes (to collect the morph objects and to reduce your time and inrease your accuracy) to unlock the achievements.",1546950489,1546950489,True,1,0,0.488260388374328613,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Beyond: Light Advent Collector’s Edition:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a young age, Diana has been mesmerised every time she looks up at the stars. The bright shiny sparkles that light up this infinite canvas at night was like bliss to her eyes. During the day, she raved to her imaginary friend, Nix, about the spectacle she saw every night and vowed to become an astronomer as soon as possible. Many moons passed and Diana kept her promise and indeed became a spy of the Milky Way. One incredible night at the observatory, she and her colleague identified a meteor on a weird trajectory; it was definitely destined to crash into Earth! Could it be her breakthrough or something sinister? You are about to find out in Beyond Light Advent!

Beyond: Light Advent Collector’s Edition is a casual / adventure / hidden objects game where you play an astronomer named Diana. She will embark on a journey to save the earth against Nor, an alien World Eater. 

Before you start the game you must choose between four levels of difficulty; from having access to a tutorial and hints button to help you if you have never played this type of game, to no help whatsoever for the people who know what to expect in this genre. 

The story is well written and will keep you entertained all the way throughout the game, which has six chapters including a bonus. Cut-scenes are well done and fit perfectly within the story. In a nutshell, and without giving too much away, Diana will have to activate three towers to save the earth. Early on, Diana will discover an alien bracelet which she will be able to use to blink (teleport) to different locations. This artefact will give her access to memories from characters from the planet IRIDESSA which was also attacked by the World Eaters in another galaxy. However she’ll need the right crystal to do so. These sessions will give Diana a better understanding of the connection between IRIDESSA and planet earth.

Plenty of collectables to gather in this game; try to find the spaceship in each of the locations you visit. I had to take the magnifying glasses on some occasions, despite wearing my own specks! The hidden objects sequences are well done. All objects are generally well-blended within these sessions but they are relatively easy to find. In a few parts of the story, Diana will have to evade the military. Here, Diana will have three paths to choose from to in order to evade detection from the military flashlights. It’s like a mini game. In regards to the puzzles, they are quite easy, too

Graphically Beyond: Light Advent looks good and the soundtrack is fun. Pretty good voice acting all the way through. There are achievements within the game but not on Steam, and there are no trading cards to gather. 

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Nice graphics
-	Good story
-	Good cut-scenes
-	Nice voice acting

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~  

-	No Steam achievements or trading cards
-	Puzzles need to be a bit harder

Beyond: Light Advent is entertaining with fun mini games, hidden objects sessions and easy puzzles.
