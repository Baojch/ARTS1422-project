My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707142673,1707142673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[13/20⭐, 14h🏅, 4/5💡]

[b]Context[/b] WayOut 2 is a Lights Out-style game on a hexagonal grid, and a sequel to original square-grided WayOut.

[b]Writing[/b] There is no plot, the game is completely abstract.

[b]Aesthetics[/b] The visuals are simple and abstract. The default view is isometric but can be changed to top-view (although I didn’t find the isometric view cumbersome). The soundtrack sounds decent initially but gets repetitive fast, had to turn it off eventually.

[b]Gameplay[/b] This is essentially a Lights Out game in a hexagonal grid: clicking a tile flips its state as well as that of surrounding tiles, and you have to turn off all tiles to beat the level. As the game progresses, new types of tiles are introduced with different effects, like being directional or triggering other similar tiles.

I often find games of this style a bit annoying because if the grid is too open, we often have to rely on trial-error (just felt that recently with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/400390/]Delusion[/url]). Luckily, WayOut 2 has good level design, and in most cases you can find the few Eureka steps that unfold the solution. Nonetheless, it can still get pretty challenging. Each level has a target number of moves that must be respected in order to “perfect” it, but once you figure out a solution this is not an issue.

It’s a bit it annoying that you cannot undo moves. Although in most cases clicking a tile reverses its effect, you may not remember the previous moves. And with some kinds of tiles the effect is not reversible. You can always restart a level, and there are no hints. The game auto-saves as levels are completed, but level progress is not saved. I’m not completely sure whether you can hit deadends with certain kinds of tiles.

[b]Value[/b] It took me about 12h to perfect all the ~60 main levels, and then further 2h for the 10 bonus levels. And the game is pretty cheap. You can always revisit levels from the hub, but there is a single progress slot. There are multiple levels open at the same time. Achievements are related to solving some of the main levels, and do not require perfecting them except for the last one. Replaying is solving the same levels.

Oh wait, while this looks exactly like a mobile app, it's not on the app stores where it belongs.  Anyway, incredibly shallow experience, once more we're faced with the eternal question about why Valve doesn't bother with quality control. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game features extremely lazy, minimalist ""art"", of the type you normally expect to see in low effort Flash/browser games and mobile apps.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes ""Wayout 2: Hex"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Wayout 2: Hex didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for completing the tutorial level, but only around 10 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show only 10 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Wayout 2: Hex is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  If this is the kind of game you really want to play, there's hundreds better than this available for free on the mobile app stores, so there's no reason to pay cash money for this one.",1682842085,1682842085,False,4,1,0.278137058019638062,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Wayout 2: Hex трудно назвать отдельной игрой. Скорее это более вдумчивое и трудное дополнение к первой части. Лично я затратил значительно больше сил на головоломки из второй части. А они требуют того же, что и в первой игре – тыкать на определенные клавиши, дабы превратить всю доступную клавиатуру в нужный цвет. 

Игровой процесс достаточно лёгок в освоении, нам предстоит просто щёлкать на кубики до того момента пока все они на поле не будут закрыты. Игрока при этом ограничивают количеством ходов для идеального прохождения, что составит немалую трудность. Одним словом, игра проста в освоении, но трудна в полном совершенстве.

Как и в первой части в игре есть 6 глав, каждая из которых несколько меняет игровой процесс, и 20 уровней в каждой. Так же как и в оригинале все кубики, при нажатии на них, затрагивают и другие. На этом и завязаны основные игровые изменения, в одной главе затрагиваются клавиши по диагонали, в другой, допустим, остальные по периметру. 

Естественно, наилучшим образом, нам нужно отключить все плитки, сделав минимально возможное количество ходов. Если хотите выполнить на отлично, то необходимо уложиться в определенное количество. Одним словом, всё то же самое.

Касательно сложности, то Wayout 2: Hex значительно превосходит оригинал. Главы второй части по принципам повторяют главы из части первой, но они значительно сложнее. Плюс ко всему, после прохождения финального уровня игра открывает дополнительное испытание – ещё одну главу. Если вас это волнует, дополнительных достижений за неё не дают, зато градус сложности там о-го-го.

[h1]Как и оригинальная Wayout её продолжение хорошо расслабляет на первых парах, но затем стремительно становится сложнее. Но она не менее успешно может вызвать сложности и подкинуть вызов в решении головоломок, ведь не все из них просты. Как и первую часть рекомендую к покупке.

УРОВНИ : все как во всех играх подобного жанра : вначале легкие,далее среднячок,затем сложные. НО единственное,что не зашло ,так это ФИНАЛ. В сравнение с 1 частью этот конечный уровень намного легче.(имеется ввиду время на прохождение от моего лица)

Нажимаем кнопки, дабы все разравнять. 
В разных этапах, добавляются свои сложности, что разнообразит процесс.
Достижения с буквами.
Можно пройти за час, два.

Как итог: хорошая мозголомка, но куда проще и мельче чем первая часть. Карты. Минимализм. Годно.

especially for the later half of the game and to ' Perfect ' within limited moves.

The only word could describe my sentiment is ' Cancer '.
"" The more you press, the worst it gets "".

Still lacks a convenient way to ' rewind ' or backspace a wrong move.

Grateful for community guide to help clear few of the harder ones which unable to resolve personally.


Decent puzzle but seem too hard for the Norm.
Glad it was over.

I've played a lot of hard puzzle games. I like those puzzle games where your best option to succeed is thinking hard about the level before you even begin. This is not one of this kind. In Wayout 2: Hex your best option to succeed is try and error your way [strike]through[/strike] out of this game. It's really not obvious which buttons are to be pressed. There are many many buttons in each level and the correct solution is press this one, this one, this, this and this... You never have to press a button twice and it's not important in which order you press them. It's just important [b]which[/b] button you press. You get no advantage by imagining different push combinations in your head beforehand, because you can try them out faster than you can imagine them. The mind is rather comfortable with a square grid than with a hex grid and therefore slow on the hex grid. Your best bet to win is to count how much pushes are needed for the upper right tile to go down and get a color. That means that the par amount of turns in which you could have finished the level is exceeded. Now try out different push combinations until you reach the turn count and see if you've got it. If not try again and again.

游戏采用了六边形的关卡设计，相较于前作的方形关卡，六边形的设计更具立体感和丰富性。这种设计让游戏场景更加丰富多样，为玩家带来了全新的视觉体验。同时六边形的拼接方式也让关卡更具挑战性，玩家需要巧妙地利用六边形的特性，才能找到通往出口的正确路径。

游戏中，玩家将面临各种类型的谜题挑战，如物理谜题、逻辑谜题、密码谜题等。这些谜题设计巧妙，需要玩家运用观察力、思考力和创造力来解决。随着关卡的推进，谜题的难度逐渐加大，玩家将在解决谜题的过程中感受到挑战与成就的快感。

游戏采用了极简的画面风格，以马卡龙色为主色调，营造出一种简约而神秘的氛围。游戏中的线条和图形干净利落，使玩家更容易专注于谜题本身。此外游戏还加入了少量彩色元素，如灯光、道具等，为游戏画面增添了活力。

游戏音乐是营造氛围的重要元素，在这方面表现出色。游戏中的音乐旋律悠扬、悠扬，既能舒缓玩家的紧张情绪，又能激发玩家探索的激情。在紧张的谜题挑战过程中，音乐起到了很好的舒缓作用，使玩家能够在轻松愉快的氛围中完成逃脱。

总体来说，这是一款具有高度挑战性和趣味性的逃脱游戏。它不仅保留了前作的核心玩法，还在画面、音乐和谜题设计上进行了升级和创新。游戏难度适中，适合各个年龄段的玩家挑战。如果你是解谜游戏爱好者，那么WayOut 2: Hex绝对值得一试。",1573054200,1710700377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I suppose they call the title that because all the puzzles are provided by a ""map"", in which completing one puzzle unlocks the path to the others until all of them have been cleared but like all sequels, it's naturally harder and more complicated with the hex-shaped buttons

Here's the good points for this game:

👍 Good graphics.
👍 Decent music.
👍 Decent price.
👍 Decent Steam Trading Cards for decent-looking Profile Badges, decent profile backgrounds and decent emoticons that can be useful for lists on Steam, or something like that.

Unfortunately, just like the prequel, this game has a major drawback; not only are the puzzles hard without a guide, especially a visual guide (here's one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0Eng-LWMis ), there's a certain feature missing that ought to be included for ALL games: the ability to SAVE PROGRESS. No matter where you are when you close the program, when it's opened it back up, the game resets and you're back to square one (or in this case, hex one). This means if you want to get all the Achievements, you'd have to complete the game all in one session. This makes using a (visual) guide essential to finish the game quickly and for the Final Puzzle, you'd have to copy every move to the note because the Final Puzzle is the map itself and there's NO REDO BUTTON; you mess up here, you'll have to do EVERYTHING over again from the very beginning. And yes, after getting all the Achievements and getting a Perfect Game added to my Profile, I closed the program then went back to make sure. Sure enough, the map went back to it's default state, with only the first level available. Screw those extra levels that came after finishing the Final Puzzle; get all the Achievements all at once then never touch this game again.

I'm truly sorry to the developers of ""WayOut"" but please fix this issue so that the game saves progress (or tell me what I'm missing that's not allowing my program to not save progress) and let me know because only then will I change my recommendation for approval.",1554745526,1554745526,False,6,0,0.582173526287078857,0,False,False,False,False,,,

本游戏的关卡不存在唯一解，解法多种多样

这个游戏的目的是为了把所有的方块都按下去才能进行下一关，规则很简单，普通的方块当你按下去的时候，周围突起的会沉下去，沉下去的会立起来，当你选择了一个沉下去的方块的时候，同理，周围的也会是一样的算法，为了避免这种枯燥的van法，开发者加入了特殊规则，也就是特殊格子。并且延续了前作的完美通关模式，全部完美通关后才会解锁最后一关，
本作不同于前作，是六角形的，关卡比较少，但足够难。刨去介绍特殊格子功能的关卡之外很让人头大，下面我们来认识一下这些特殊格子（均含有黄色）
1.黄圆点，长这样  功能，你只能通过点击这个圆点格子来改变它的状态，点击周围格子不会改变它的状态，技巧：一般看到这个格子凸起一定要按下去，沉下去的话不用管，完美通关不用点它。
2.黄色六角形   功能 ：同普通格子，外加一条：如果你点击了这个格子周围相邻的格子，就会默认你同时点击这个格子，这个格子周围非你点击格会做出反应。技巧：可以通过点击它周围的格子一下子按下去不少
3.箭头 功能：点击它只会影响指向的两个格子，被影响的话如同普通格子，技巧：该格子具有特殊意义 ，可以被单独按掉（指的两边米有格子）也可以把普通格吸引到两侧一起按下
4.大黄格：这个格子不会被为选择为点击对象，除非进行激活，激活方式为点击相邻周围任意不是大黄格的格子，然后大黄格转变为普通格，保持原有状态，大黄格的存在表示关卡可能需要某一个格子点两下了，之前都是一个格子一下。
5.双黄点：最恶心的格子，这个格子会和其它双黄点联动，当你使一个双黄格改变状态时，其余同样标记的格子都会改变为那个状态，其余同普通格，技巧 我没总结出啥
  总结

...4 hours later I realized how wrong I had been.

Rules are simple. The game also looks simple. But it is not.
It took me long hours of struggle to complete the whole set of levels, and I had about half of them done with perfect movement. I finished the other half with little help. Actually I don't see any pattern in many levels, so I have no idea how one could possibly solve it with a minimum amount of steps. To get perfect score on each level by yourself you must be either some kind of super human or have an incredible luck. 

The biggest problem of the game is lack of 'undo' button. Not only it would help to get a perfect movement, but it would also help player to generally solve levels without lots of frustration. 
Having a counter for steps would be nice too.

There was one more issue for me - a slowly rotating background was making me feel dizzy after spending longer while with this game.

Expensive cards
Low price

Not complicated

- Teilweise Lösung gebraucht

Fazit:
Nachdem ich vom ersten Teil positiv überrascht war, holte ich mir gleich den zweiten Teil dazu! Einzige Änderung hierbei ist, dass statt auf vier Seiten jetzt auf sechs Seiten geachtet werden muss! Das Spielprinzip ist gleich geblieben! Es kam mir vor ob das etwas weniger Level sind als beim ersten, was aber nicht schlimm ist, da es trotzdem knackig ist! Auch hier habe ich, um das letzte Level freizuschalten eine Lösung zum Schluss zur Rate gezogen (Um fünf Level auf Perfekt zu schaffen)! Ansonsten kommt man wunderbar vorwärts und hat selten Frustmomente! Die Musik war mit der Zeit mal wieder nervig, aber auch hier konnte man sie problemlos abstellen!

Aside from that, the game imports pretty much all of the mechanics and tile variants from the first game - not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that the game doesn't feel quite as 'fresh' as it might otherwise.

Notably, this sequel presents a significantly tougher level of difficulty, especially when aiming for 'perfect' solutions - this is likely primarily to be the result of each move now having a greater impact (on the six adjacent hexagons, rather than four adjacent squares), so be prepared for that. Conversely, it felt to me that the trial-and-error element may have dropped slightly, though it's still definitely there to some extent and perhaps this feeling is due to my accumulated experience across the two games together.

1. add an ""undo"" button with unlimited turns, all the way back to the beginning. It's very hard to keep track of continuous changes you made, and if you find that a previous position (if you're already well underway in solving a map) would have been more advantageous, it should be made easy to return to progress that you reached earlier, instead of having to redo the whole map.
2. add a save/""continue where you left off"" feature. As it is, you have to beat each map in one sitting, and some of them can be large.
3. Reposition the settings so that you can turn on/off the music and/or sound while you're working on a map. As it is, you have to give up your halfway map progress if you decide that you want/don't want one or the other.

Tá, eu sempre busco apoiar desenvolvedores Indies, acho bacana dar uma chance e prestigiar os seus trabalhos, sendo ruim ou não, isso não importa logo de cara, primeiramente o que vale é dar uma chance se você acredita em dado jogo, certo? Após o 1º, em que já joguei e tirei uma análise, eu resolvi pegar o 2º jogo e também analisá-lo. Eu realmente pensei: ""Agora vai, talvez um jogo melhor, hein. Apoie, Frank!"". Pois bem, o jogo melhorou em relação ao primeiro, hein! Sim, o primeiro eu não recomendei por ser massante demais, mas esse melhorou mesmo ainda tendo poucas coisas chatinhas. Eu me diverti até agora, sabe? Tanto que esse será aquele jogo casual para eu ir pegando as conquistas e ir completando-o calmamente, sem pressa.

O primeiro ponto em que devo salientar, é que o jogo apresenta novas melhorias como novas funções, uma trilha de fundo menos enjoativa e uma apresentação menos massante ao jogador de todo o seu conteúdo. Os níveis dos jogos parecem mais divertidos, mesmo com aqueles mais complexos. Alguns mesmo eu fico rindo de minha burrice e como não ""percebi"" tal coisa. Tipo, não estou falando que o jogo é muito melhor que antes, mas teve uma melhoria sim, algo notável. A ideia se baseia com a mesma do jogo anterior, no entanto, agora se trata com figuras hexagonais, o que torna as consequências de seus movimentos não mais ao lado vertical e horizontal da figura e, sim, como em toda. Se você pressionar o ""botão"" hexagonal você irá afetar todos os ""botões"" hexagonais que estejam ao redor do ""botão"" acionado. Para um melhor entendimento quanto à ideia, basta seguir a minha review do primeiro jogo por [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnofranklin/recommended/551110/]aqui[/url]. Mas saiba de que o único e próprio vídeo do jogo na Loja é autoexplicativo quanto a isso.

Agora, quanto às novas funções, você pode deixar o jogo em 2D (C), reiniciar o nível (R), desativar os efeitos/animações ao fundo (B), alterar o fundo (V) ou tirar/colocar do/em full screen (S) com atalhos no teclado. Parece bobeira, mas ajuda dependendo da pessoa que vá jogar. Talvez algumas pessoas se sintam melhores com uma imagem em 2D, assim percebendo melhor seus movimentos. É tudo questão de gosto e percepção de cada um, e isso o desenvolvedor conseguiu pensar e aprimorar em seu segundo jogo. Quanto à trilha de fundo, sim, ela melhorou, parece menos enjoativa e tudo mais, mas uma hora ela irá enjoá-lo e, a partir daí, recomendo ouvir alguma música ao fundo, mas algo para relaxar e fazer você pensar. Ou não, pode tentar na sorte, hehe. Vale falar de que há novidades de movimentos no jogo e que serão melhores apresentadas com o tempo nele e muito bem elaboradas.

O tempo do lançamento do primeiro ao segundo jogo levou em torno de 3 meses, o que é curto e estava se tornando natural fazerem isso lá no [url=http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/]Greenlight[/url]. Não estou falando que isso torna-o ruim, ele não é, teve melhorias sim, mas como eu disse no começo: não o deixa bem melhor que o primeiro. Isso se dá pela falta de um maior espaço de tempo entre os dois jogos, pois, se tivesse sido tratado com maior tempo, poderia sair um jogo muito melhor, claramente. Acredito que um 3º jogo demore agora para sair depois de toda a notícia sobre o fechamento do Greenlight e a abertura de um programa melhor de suporte à divulgação de desenvolvedores Indies. Com a melhoria que teve, eu ainda compraria um 3º, no entanto, se o tempo de lançamento for consideravelmente correto e capaz de trazer ainda mais melhores mudanças.

Suas conquistas agora são menores quanto ao primeiro e não cansa tanto alcançá-las, note também que tudo é questão de paciência, pois ao avançar do jogo ele fica mais complexo, hehe. Porém, mesmo assim, ainda é bem menos massante quanto ao primeiro jogo. Tem estímulo. Recomendo jogá-lo casualmente, ele é totalmente casual, então não foque em jogá-lo por bastante tempo, consecutivamente. Inevitavelmente, isso irá desgastá-lo e, consequentemente, desmotivá-lo. 

[b]Finalizo dizendo algumas coisas:[/b][list]
[*][i]Eu recomendo, caso ainda não tenha visto o primeiro jogo, a dar uma olhada em minha [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnofranklin/recommended/551110/]review[/url] falando dele e também olhar a sua [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/551110/]página[/url] na Loja Steam[/i];
[*][i]Caso o primeiro jogo também lhe interesse, dê uma olhada na [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2730/]WayOut Bundle[/url] - onde contém os 2 jogos[/i];
[*][i]Caso ambos os jogos você queira apenas para ADD à sua biblioteca, bem, siga o que falei na minha review do primeiro jogo: compre com 75% off, ou mais, a Bundle ou algum deles que esteja faltando separadamente[/i];
[*][i]Se você sabe prestigiar pequenos jogos com boas ideias, mesmo que com algumas falhas nada prejudiciais ao gameplay, então suporte-os[/i];
[*][i]Contém 5 cartas para um level de insígnia, sendo assim 3 cartas dropáveis e que, seguindo o mercado, com um valor considerável de retorno - [b]PS:[/b] o valor pode mudar dependendo da época em que esteja vendo a review.

WayOut 2: Hex - отличная, действительно сложная головоломка.

Всего 3 дня назад, GrabTheGames выпустили вторую часть WayOut (получившую положительную реакцию от пользователей Steam). Если изначально мы играли четырехугольными фигурами и разработчики призывали нас к тому чтобы просто расслабиться и найти выход, то в данной части дело несколько осложнилось. С шестигранными фигурами отдохнуть, по крайней мере морально, вам не удастся. Каждый уровень труднее предыдущего, ведь вы вынуждены выстраивать стратегию не на несколько шагов вперед, а значительно дальше.

Итак, при запуске, вас встречает небольшое меню в виде головоломки, каждый сегмент которой обозначает уровень (а их 60!). По мере приобретения элементов меню-головоломки желтого цвета (это свидетельствует о том, что вы успешно окончили один из уровней), вы продвигаетесь вперед по лестнице сложностей. Суть состоит в том, чтобы все части-шестиугольники опустились вниз и сменили цвет с оранжевого на белый. А вот тут все не так просто: опуская или поднимая звено, прилегающие к нему принимают прямо противоположное положение.

Скажу честно, у меня возникли проблемы с решением задачи уже после 7-и уровней. Чувство того, что сложность растет в геометрической прогрессии не покидало ни на минуту. Но это распаляет азарт, и вызывает желание продвигаться дальше, испытывая себя все более каверзными уровнями.

Кстати говоря, в игре имеются 40 забавных достижений в виде букв и цифр, которые вы получите по мере прохождения, и вдобавок коллекционные карточки.

Обобщая обзор хотелось бы сказать о том, что данный продукт не только развлечет, а так же поможет развить усидчивость и терпение. Приятная атмосфера и забавное музыкальное сопровождение помогут вам в этом. Однозначно стоит потраченных денег и времени.

Уж никак не могу сбавить балл за сложность. 10 из 10.

·任意一个板块点击两次恢复原状；
·点击板块的顺序不影响最终效果。
（第二条原则在出现黄色板块后有所变化，但本质上没有区别，只要在找到最佳路线后将黄色板块的点击顺序全部延后即可）

上面两个原则实际上规定了整个游戏的逻辑基础：最终的解决方案，就是[b]找到若干个确定的板块，点击并且仅点击一次，即可通关[/b]。他的数学本质其实就是一个多元方程组，未知数的数量与板块的总数一致，而方程的解就是一串二进制代码。遗憾的是，寻找这串解法的过程是没有任何捷径和规律的。对于不同功能板块的效果理解，其实就是更准确地表述方程组中每一个方程等号右边的数值——这无益于改善整个方程组的数学结构。

在游戏过程中发现的“规律”，其实没有任何逻辑基础可言，如果生成关卡的过程完全随机化，那么随便杜撰一些所谓的规律，在统计上一定会适用于某些关卡。之所以有些关卡看似简单或困难，或似乎应用于某些特定的手法，仅仅是因为[b]在关卡制作的过程中有意或无意地契合了人脑的常规思维模式[/b]。事实上，只要关卡中板块数量一定，那么关卡的难度就是一致的，作为游戏者，唯一的作用就是排除掉一些明显不合理的操作步骤。但如果关卡能够无限制地扩大，那么这种排除手段的数量级将迅速落后于全部可能的操作数量，以至于可以忽略不计。也就是说，[b]解决关卡的唯一办法就是穷举所有的可能手段——既没有比这更高效的办法也没有比这更低效的办法了，没有任何思维逻辑手段能够改变这一点[/b]。

那么玩这款游戏的意义在哪里呢？是检验自己的运气好坏还是锻炼自己的毅力呢？这款游戏看上去是一个益智游戏，但实际上他的逻辑内涵比扫雷还要低。

Логическая головоломка.

Поле состоит из поднимающихся и опускающихся платформ. Наша задача опустить все платформы (чтобы поле приобрело белый цвет). Сложность в том, что при опускании одной платформы, соприкасающиеся с ней краями соседние платформы меняют свое положение на противоположенное. Надо найти нужную последовательность переключений, чтобы опустить все платформы и пройти уровень. При этом надо затратить как можно меньше попыток.

Довольно своеобразно выполнено меню игры. Не сразу понимаешь, что выбор уровня тоже сделан в виде такой головоломки. Только каждая такая платформочка в меню изображает один из уровней. Всего в игре 60 уровней.

Геймплей рассудительный и неспешный. Тут нет таймера, никто не торопит. Считают только количество попыток, затраченных на переключение платформ при прохождении.
Постепенно уровни усложняются, меняются условия. Например, платформы с желтым кругом не переключаются в противоположенное положение если рядом с ними щелкнуть соседнюю платформу. Они меняются только при нажатии на саму платформу с желтым кругом.

Интересная головоломка, которая заставляет пошевелить мозгами. Отличный способ потренировать логическое мышление. Игра предоставляет для этого самые благоприятные условия. Никаких таймеров, отвлекающих и аркадных элементов на ловкость. Только тонкий, логический расчет каждого действия.

Také jsem se na ni těšil, i přesto, že první díl byl ne zas tak moc zábavný a spíš o logice byl o nudném klikání všude možně. Viz moje [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/lonelyfirewolf/recommended/551110/]recenze[/url]. U druhého dílu jsem čekal, že se autoři poučí ze svých chyb a přinesou nám něco, co nám všem vyrazí dech. A skutečně mi tahle hra vyrazila dech.

[h1]Jak nedělat pokračování[/h1]
Hned první, co mě praštilo do očí a nemile překvapilo, byla cena. Ta se zvýšila z 0,90 euro na 1,80 euro, tedy dvojnásobně. Vím, že je to směšná částka, ale logicky jsem očekával tedy dvakrát tolik obsahu. Zde přišlo nemilé překvapení číslo 2, když jsem zjistil, že ve hře je jen něco kolem 60 levelů. V prvním díle jich bylo přes 100.

Ale to je ok, víte. Chlácholil jsem se tím, že třeba ty levely budou těžší a propracovanější a díky tomu si tohle obhájí onu cenovku. Spletl jsem se. Levely sice jsou těžší (už čtvrtý je až nesmyslně obtížný), ale není to dáno tím, že by byly, jak to říct, inteligentnější. Problém, který byl u prvního dílu Wayout, tedy nelogický postup a náhodné klikání, dokud level nedokončíte, je zpět. A je zpět ve velkém stylu. Díky tomu, že tu nyní pole mají tvar šestihranu, narostla raketově obtížnost a prvek hádání je přítomný už od začátku. A to je špatně.

[h1]Vzdávám to[/h1]
Přiznám se, že jsem hru hrál jen 33 minut, než jsem ji vypnul a požádal o vrácení peněz. Splnil jsem kolem sedmi levelů a dostal jsem se do druhé části hry, kdy byl představen nový prvek. No... on vlastně nebyl představen a i když jsem s ním splnil tři levely, tak netuším, co vlastně dělá. Hra vám tam prostě hodí nějaký nový druh políčka a to je vše. Poté, co jsem dohrál Linelight, je tohle jako studená sprcha a ukázka, jak nedělat logickou hru.

Bohužel tu je opět také jedna z největších chyb prvního titulu - Wayout 2 po vás zase chce, abyste hádanky plnili na co nejmenší počet tahů, ale NIKDY vám neřekne, kolik že to je. V praxi to vypadá tak, že zapnete hru, vyberete level, snažíte se logicky přemýšlet a dělat co nejméně tahů, ejhle... vpravo nahoře již vidíte, že to nedáte, takže se musíte rozhodnout, zda level dokončíte a spokojíte se zatím s tímhle provizorním výsledkem nebo ho restartujete.

K tomu se váže DALŠÍ chyba hry. Není tu vracení tahů. Což bych u tohoto typu her bral jako samozřejmost. Není to moc prdel, když hrajete, jde vám to a pak se omylem překliknete a jedinou možností je pak restart celého zatraceného levelu!

A novinky? Páni, těch tu je, že byste to spočítali na prstech jedné ruky vysloužilého dřevorubce. Kromě logicky trochu odlišné povahy hádanek tu máte i možnost změnit paletu barev na černobílou, což je super, jenže díky tomu na mapě nerozeznáte, které levely jste udělali na perfektní skóre a které jsou odemknuty... Ach jo. Poté můžete mít i 2D, ale to je taková blbost, která mi přišla strašně nepřehledná.

[h1]Dost bylo slov[/h1]
Někdo může namítnout, že jsem hru nehrál dostatečně dlouho. Uznávám, že většinou se snažím hru dohrát, ale tady jsem to prostě musel vzdát. A to jsem chtěl, aby se mi líbila. Vážně jsem to moc chtěl. Bohužel hra velmi brzy kašle na logiku a opět to je jen o náhodném mačkání tlačítek a modlení se k hernímu bohu, ať již konečně dokončíte tenhle zpropadený level.

[h1]Plusy[/h1]
+ velmi brzy zjistíte, že to je blbost, a tak to můžete vrátit a dostat své peníze zpátky!!!
+ hodně rychlá odinstalace
+ hezké menu
+ celkem v pohodě hudba
+ první tři levely... :D

[h1]Mínusy[/h1]
- nezábavné
- není to o logice, ale náhodném klikání
- hra je VELMI brzy těžká a nevysvětlí vám nové herní mechaniky
- není tu opět počítání tahů (kvůli perfektnímu skóre)
- chybí tlačítko na vrácení tahu
- u černobílého režimu nejdou rozeznat levely na mapě
- o dost méně levelů než u prvního dílu
- dvojnásobná cena oproti prvnímu dílu


[h1]Konečný verdikt[/h1]
[b]Mé hodnocení: 2/10[/b]

Doufal jsem, že se tvůrci po prvním díle poučí. Nestalo se tak a co víc, tahle hra je horší. Máte rádi logiku? Pak se tomuhle titulu vyhněte.

P.S.: Všiml jsem si, že aktuálně jsou na Steamu tři recenze, z nichž jsou všechny kladné. To by bylo v pořádku, jenže dva tito lidé mají vývojáře v přátelích a ten třetí je z Ukrajiny, odkud pochází i vývojáři... Náhoda?",1486847279,1486847692,False,3,0,0.420746892690658569,0,True,False,False,False,,1486911800.0,"Hey! Thank’s for your feedback.
Yes, game mechaniс isn't clear for all players, but there is logic in it.
Game is definitely hard, even harder than the first one, but it's caused by new hexagonal game field.
And game is all about the flow and feelings, not about perfect score and finding perfect solution (that's why there is no back button). If you would have least competitive mood, maybe try it again and look at it from different angle.
There are two times less levels than in the first part, but they are bigger and more complicated, so they in total need more time to finish than whole prequel.
Please, if you want developers to read the review, write it in English. I can't understand nearly half of the text using google translate, sorry.

P.S. Our friends played a game and write reviews, but no worries, they got keys for free, so their reviews don't count in user review score ;)
P.P.S. And some even buy it by themselves and write their opinions, but we can’t do anything about it.
