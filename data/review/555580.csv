前作のレビューはSwitch購入の為書けませんが、2と同様に私の中では良好です。

前作の押しが何とプレイアブルになったのは嬉しい。
プレイアブルってだけで凄いテンション上がるんですよ、おかげ様でルナティックにも挑戦したくなるってものです。
さてアクション初心者層への配慮ですが、難易度選択があるのは◎。
一番下の難易度でもラスボス辺りはそこそこ強いかもしれませんが、ショップ利用の強化やその他の強化手段もありますので、アクション初心者層でも粘れば完走出来ると思います。
そのような意味でアクション初心者にもオススメしたいゲーム。
純粋なアクションではなくSTGアクションな感じなので、ロックマンやメタスラみたいな「撃って敵を倒せ！」なアクションが好きだと尚相性◎。
不慣れなうちはインストール（パワーアップ）も難しい事考えず、完全オートでベリーベリーイージーで脳死プレイでOKだと思います。
慣れてきたらセミオートなりマニュアルなり、難易度を上げたりと自由にやってみましょう。

ある程度アクションは慣れてますが、ルナティックを初めてプレイしましたらボスが撃破出来ずあまりに硬すぎて笑いました……。
ファミコンロックマンみたいなボスの体力を想定しますと、比べ物にならない程硬すぎます。
各ボスに弱点があると言えども、1ボスも撃破出来ないうちは通常攻撃で遣り合うしかありません。
どうしても駄目でしたらショップや「その他の手段」で色々と底上げするしかなさそうなので、現在底上げを試みてルナティック完走に頑張ってます。
このように完全無理ゲーではなく、底上げ手段による救済処置が設けられているのは好印象。

ミニゲームのルディミカルは実績やアイテム収集でお世話になると思うのですが、BEMANIみたいな音ゲー経験者からみますと正直これは「音ゲーではない」と思いました。
ただ曲が流れているだけの目押しゲー、むしろ曲が無い方が集中しやすいまである……率直な感想です。
ボタンタイミングが音ゲーとして考慮されているものではなく、更に私のやり方が悪いのか仕様なのかシビアなのか、短間隔での3～4連打辺りが来ると高確率で最後の1打が反応せずミスになります。
空打ちするときちんと連打でも入るっぽいですが、いざ実践となると何故か連打で斬れません……私のやり方が悪いのでしょうか。

アクションゲームとしては比較的自由度も高く、初心者から熟練者まで楽しめそうで、前作ファンにはキャラ的な意味で嬉しい要素もあり、アフタートークも楽しめ、値段を考えましても十分な程の作品です。

	Like its predecessor, Dark Witch is a mix of Megaman and Gradius. You platform and shoot, whilst also gaining temporary upgrades that last the length of the stage for as long as you stay alive. Movement speed boost, increased damage output, expanded projectile trajectories, etc. 

	My issues with the first game were that the boss weapons used the same resource as your upgrades. So you had to decide whether to upgrade your character or use boss weaponry. That, and the upgrades were requirements rather than optional. So if you died at certain points you just made life that much harder. 

	Dark Witch 2 includes some simple changes that imrpove a lot. Weapons, including your basic buster, have their own separate ammo pool. This ammo pool constantly refills. Different weapons use different amounts of the pool, and all have a set requirement to shoot at least 1 bullet. So the beam uses the entire pool whilst your buster uses such a small amount it allows you to spam. It's ingenious and something all Megaman-like games should take note of.

	There's some trade-offs in the stage design. The upgrades are no longer requirements to pass the stages, but that's because the stages are much simpler in design. There's barely any variety between them, with many being straight paths with the ocassional bottomless pit. It's a definite downgrade, even if it alleviates the upgrade issue. The bosses are like-wise much easier than before, even if they finally move (previously they stayed perfectly in place throughout the fight). 

	Outside of stages you can upgrade your abilities permanently. Just as before, you can upgrade for more health, increased base damage on your buster, and more lives. It makes the game much easier without altering the difficulty level. Dark Witch 2 expands the system, by allowing boss weapon upgrades and unlocking new abilities to upgrade in-stage. So instead of your temporary upgrade being a hover, you can replace it with a dash. Instead of the damage boost, you can replace it with a guard. So next time you're in-stage, the potential temp upgrade is now that.

	The game is roughly twice as long as the first game. You can still speed through it, but it carries almost double the stages of the first one. My only problem is the grinding required for the permanent upgrades. The first few levels are easy enough, but later ones require grinding out either the boss rush or individual levels. It feels like artificial padding, but you can also argue that the upper tiers are harder to attain because they're optional and make the game easier. In other words, it shouldn't be too easy to make the game easy. 
	The first game had some issues in its game design that really dampened the entire package. Dark Witch 2 makes some simple changes that lift the entire package out of that pit. But the outcome is a game balanced more on the easier side. Whilst it may be a longer game, its easy enough that your playtime isn't drastically extended. Unless you grind out the permanent upgrades. Despite some of the trade-offs in difficulty its definitely a game that has improved over the first. So much so that I'd be willing to recommend it, unlike the first game.
	
	Inside System (the developer) would go on to remake the first game with game mechanic alterations. Primarily, the ammo pool change introduced in Dark Witch 2. This obviously isn't a review of that, but it goes to show how crucial the change is. From my understanding, the third game has difficulties in making its way onto Steam due to it being developed in tandem with another company. Hopefully it can get out of limbo, because I'm definitely looking forward to it. I wouldn't call Dark Witch 2 a monumental game in platforming history, but its certainly working its way into a solid franchise.",1657249863,1657249863,True,2,0,0.4212188720703125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

One hell of an awesome Shooter+Platformer game, There's 3 characters you can play as: ZIZOU OLYMPIA, SOLA, and RIVA. There are many new things that I really, REALLY, like about this game.
1. The Music
The Music is honestly one of my most favorite parts of a game, I'm a dude who loves listening to video game music when I am bored. and TLoDW2 has some good music for the game. 
2. The Extras, Designs, etc.
Once you beat the game for the first time as Zizou without cheats from Al's Shop, You can unlock things such as PLAYING LEVEL, SYEGA SHOP to where you can unlock new things to change up the game on a new save file! Things in the Syega Shop are Costumes for Zizou and Sola, Stat Bonuses, and more!
3. The Voices
The voices are honestly one of my favorite parts, Hearing the voices just sounds so good to me. I really liked how well the VAs did in this game.

Conclusion: A great game to buy if you're into Shooter Platformers. I love this game and I have been playing this game on my 3DS too! I'd say that this game is just... magnificent. And I really love the story and how cool the character designs are. And with the Syega Shop, you can perform awesome new things and make up some challenges to make the game harder!

I'm keeping The Legend of Dark Witch 2 as a Reccomend game because of:


The story. There's a nation on the west side of  The Old Islands named Germa. This Germa has been shown to have good research in Seyga, and they have a researching group feared upon many known as the Ich, consisting of the top researchers of the nation. Germa decided to cause some naughty actiivy by sending that said group to Liana, antoher nation although its in the west, to continue their research in private. This move immediately Alarms the protagonist of the prequel, Zizou Olympia, to go check up on this. She decides to defeat all members of the Ich and creates a plan to go inside of Germa and to stop whoever is behind all of the research. With the people she gotten help with (the 2nd tier of bosses Codino, Blad, Stoj, and Pelusa), shes manages to go to the castle and then she counters the one behind everything: Franzer V. 

As the first phase begins, Franzer starts off with a melee strat with her sword with some magic in between. However, when Zizou defeats her, she told her the reason behind everything and how nobody was able to cap a whole bunch of Seyga into a human body except for her. Then, she turnes into her awakened form and the second and final phase begins. Even after the power that she had, Zizou finishes her off, and then tells her to stop her meddling, calming and finishing Gerrma's research. 

This story perfects the prequel's story in every way possible. Instead of being a cliché plot about some girl stealing stuff, it expands on the world of Beatus (the universe takes place) and revolutionises it as a whole even more. This along with the game's soundtrack's names, perfectly evident the importance of the story (Reach for your Wish, the final boss is reaching Franzer's wishes for Germa to become the strongest nation in The Old Islands) giving this game props to the storytelling. 

How's the characters overall though? While the charactes have been shown to have a spike in personality, I still feel like the characters fit the classic anime style of characters. This is evidented with one's Like Icke, Pelusa, and Rudy. Their designs are fantastic though. But the charactes could be a bit worked on to make it a better experience. I can probably see why as most of the developers working on the game are males (NAN-A, the main Dev behind most of the games) and I feel like they don't know how females work really. This is just me, but the personalites of the characters in this series feel more generalised than anything. 

Now how about the gameplay. The gameplay completely takes what the first game had to offer on both the positive and the critical perspective and fix the mistakes right away. The bosses attacks you get from them have a special metre instead of using the Gradius slot bar, and you can choose between Comet and Line without once again, using the slot. The only thing you can use with the slot for the primary is attacks is by enhancing them (and I believe that comet and Punishment (the other shot unlocked in Papelne Trade) is broken as hell) and its a better addition than what the prequel had. The Level design has been nerfed to the ground though. The levels seem too easy, and you can probably finish the game in under thirty minutes. Not to mention Papelne trade; with that you can get Express, a better version of speed that makes you extremely fast. Makes the game too easy as a whole. I'd suggest playing the game on Expert to get a more casual experience (casual is Very x2 Easy without the extra things it has to offer). 

The charactes also got revenge attacks: last minute damaging moves that can be threatening (especially on Lunatic) But don't worry, you got one too. Hyper Dark Arm! (or Churros Scramble, or Princess Strike (only exclusive to this version though)) They're all convenient especially when finding a way to dodge the enemies' ones. My personal favorite is Icke's where she sends out a giant beam. 


The postgame is excellent too. Sola as a playable character has got to be the best choice INSIDE_SYSTEM has ever done. Not only she's broken as hell, but her story of her taking her Spring Break to find her parents takes dedication, and she's willing to go through the trouble to find them at the end of the game. I didn't really like how Zizou was once again the final boss and she almost works similar to what she's like against Riva in the first game, but I guess it sparks discussions whether or not Zizou is good or not. Riva as a playable character although she's a bit broken as well, she doesn't interact with the bosses nor even has an aftertalk with them. 

This game is how you perfect a prequel game and The Legend of Dark Witch 2 is a fantastic game. I'd recommend this game to anyone especially for casual gamers.",1617791539,1669578701,True,1,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

這Episode 2在量的方面名副其實是一代的強化版，無論是關卡數目、強化選項和收集要素都明顯比上集豐富。然而，在質的方面，個人認為上集的關卡和Boss設計都比這一集用心和好玩得多。本作作為Platform game關卡卻幾乎都是平地直路、敵人和機關的放置也顯得有點隨便、Boss的攻擊即使在最高難度也有很多是固定模式和可以定點安置的。種種要素雖然不是很大問題、也不會令遊戲沒法玩，但整體感覺就是不好玩，破關也沒有成功感，只有作業感。

另外不建議從Casual或以下難度開始遊戲，而是直接由Expert玩，真的有嚴重卡關才去調低難度。Casual以下難度的Boss HP簡直跟紙糊一樣，很多時候還沒摸清打法，就算所有招用臉硬接換血最後還是會贏，這種感覺在遊戲體驗上實在稱不上是有趣…",1606586132,1606586132,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Review[/h1] 

The Legend of Dark Witch 2. Everything is improved compared to the previous series. Best of all, this game is designed for beginners to easily adapt to the game and enjoy the gameplay itself. Of course, the game is still challenging and exciting. More stages and stories are complemented. This game properly blended the advantages of Gradius and MegaMan. Basically, the gameplay time per level can be rather short, but the replay value is high. Sometimes a grinding process may be required to practice advanced skills, but in some cases such a play would be its own pleasure. It has a lot of content to enjoy. If you find this game, try it without any hesitation. This developer has great potential and talent. We really look forward to its another sequel project. Highly Recommended!

The graphics remain in a lovely pixel animation style like in part 1. All enemies and background are fully animeted an uniq.

The first game suffered quite much from its Nintendo 3DS origins. Luckily this time the game doesn't feel like all characters were crammed into a very small screen which results much more smooth gameplay. 

If I were to nitpick about something it would be the difficulty that is considerable easier than it was in the first part of the series. I don't miss all those pits or suddenly appearing enemies but cute bosses have somewhat lost their charm because of the easier difficulty. In the first game bosses either required multiple lives to find out barely survivable strategy or upgraded technical skill that was their weakness. This time I accidentally beat most of the bosses in (so-called) expert mode with normal shot on first or second try. In the first game utilizing weaknesses felt like strangely satisfying cheating after failing multiple times with normal shot but now just beating bosses makes me have guilty conscience.

Later Thoughts: Replay-value of the game is huge thanks versatility of gameplay. There are two (and half) characters to play that differ considerably but what really adds that replay-value is the shop system. There are the normal shops that sell stuff for current playthrough and ""cheat-shop"" that can be used to alter characters initial parameters. Beating the game even on the hardest difficulty isn't exactly very hard because you can farm currency and quite buy ease. The real difficulty of the game is to understand all those (stupid) things you can do with shop-system and how to tailor your playthrough. For example: like in most of the megamanesque games, all the sub-weapons/technical skills are used extremely little. However with cheat shop its possible to get enough initial currency to fully upgrade your (least) favourite technical skill which gives incentive to put it into main weapon slot. Sliding through the game and enemies (and into pits) is very different  experience compared to just shooting things with standard shot.",1520118257,1520606924,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is almost exactly the same as the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/420770]previous title[/url], only a little bigger and more polished. This means that the parrying, on-site upgrade system, and the Megaman-esque gameplay aspects are all still here unchanged.

While playable on it, keyboard controls are only slightly better supported. Instead of being able to rebind keys to actions, you can only bind the actions to the keys on the screen. For example, you can't assign space bar or another key to ""Jump"", you have to assign the ""Jump"" action to one of the 9 keys that you can only assign to. The same deal is with controllers as well, you can only assign actions to buttons. 
DualShock 4 controllers are natively supported, but if you're using DS4Windows or maybe something else similar, the controls in-game get weird.

Just like the first game, it's simplistic with its run-n-shoot mechanics. You can shoot almost as fast as you press the button and there's a recharging ""Capacity"" bar that drains each time you attack with anything so you're discouraged from spamming attacks. This was here before, only now this applies to your default attacks as well to prevent the endless, unnecessary spamming.

The screen is still a bit small and constantly running forward without a bit of caution can still be consequential, though less so than the first game, and the camera still moves pretty slowly when turning around. You can still change the camera speed and positions, but it's all as slow as before when it moves.
Because of the lighter punishment in running forward without caution, the game overall can be pretty easy; it's possible to run to the end of most levels without stopping if you know when to jump, shoot, and upgrade, or if you just react fast enough.

There are more stages than in the previous game and they can be cleared pretty fast. They've got their own unique set of enemies as well as some recycled ones and level designs for each one are as simplistic as before as they're mostly flat with a few basic platforming sections here & there.
The bosses in the game are unique & simple, and a few from the previous game make a return. Unlike the previous game though, almost all of the bosses actually move around instead of remain in the same X-axis for the entirety of their fights. They also have no collision unless it's from certain attacks, meaning you can walk through them without harm, making many fights way easier than they ought to be. For a few bosses, using that advantage may be one of the only tactics against a particular attack of theirs to prevent you from taking damage.
There are 3 sets of stages/bosses in the game; 8 are available from the start, 4 more become available after the first 8 are cleared, and the last appears when those 4 are done. The last stage is a boss rush of the first 8 followed by the final boss after they're all done.
You acquire a boss' ""Technical Skill"" when you beat them, but this only applies to the first 8. They can be useful against specific bosses Mega Man style and in the stages themselves, but I rarely found myself using them there. One Skill in particular is an offensive dash with i-frames that activate as soon as the Skill itself activates. It makes for a great defensive option if upgraded and/or if other methods like basic dodging & parrying aren't going pretty well.

Parrying, or ""Blocking"", is still difficult to pull off, but is just as rewarding if you do it right intentionally; speed & precision is still required to negate the damage coming towards you. You press left or right just as an attack of some kind is about to hit you, however it can sometimes be pretty tough to determine when & where exactly the hitboxes collide.

""Tres"" is still both the currency and fuel for filling up the Enhancement Slot bar, your Gradius-style on-site upgrade system at the bottom of the screen.
There aren't many new upgrades compared to the previous game and only very few are any practical. The same goes for upgrading the same ""upgrade"" more than necessary; for example, upgrading ""Speed"" too much may make your movement speed harder to control, and too many upgrades to the slot that makes your attacks cover a broader range is highly unnecessary because almost all of the enemies in the game are in front of you or are just slightly above your default line of sight.
Like before, there's an upgrade shop of sorts in the stage select screen, only it's much bigger than before. You can buy various items and upgrades for a variety of selections such as the upgrades themselves in-game, your stats, and ""Technical Skills"". Because of how short the game is, there's a good chance you won't purchase everything in the shop before the game's actually beaten unless you decide to grind for them, which won't reward you with anything in the end.

Within each stage—save for the very last—there are 4 hidden collectibles, ""Pure Syega"". They're invisible, but they give off a subtle sparkle which you can either shoot or touch to reveal them. Their primary use is to be special currency for upgrades in the shop, but there's a good chance not all of them will be used at all as many upgrades aren't necessary.

Like the first game, you unlock Lunatic difficulty once you beat the game for the first time. It's a huge difficulty increase compared to what was already available as attacks for almost every enemy with an actual attack changes in some way and enemies—especially bosses—take more shots to beat regardless of your upgrades.

Replayability is relied on the in-game achievements that are tied to the Steam achievements, and two new characters that become available to you after the game's done; they're both from the first game and only one of them is of any real relevance to the rest of the game. The irrelevant one was pretty much just included in the game for appearance's sake as she doesn't have her own storyline or voice even. The one with the voice and storyline though plays pretty differently and she can be overpowered thanks to an in-game upgrade you can purchase that maximizes the rest of her upgrades in-game automatically.

The game's plot is pretty simplistic and doesn't really tie-in to the first game all that hard, so outside of familiarity's and numerical continuity's sake, you don't really have to play the first one.
Playthroughs are very short so replayability and the achievements in-game are relied on for extensive play times. It's double the price of the first game, though it is bigger and a bit more refined than that of the first game.",1516539754,1516551052,True,1,0,0.523470818996429443,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Absoluely loved it, while it is the closest game to good megaman gameplay you can find in this day and age, its also doing its own take on that genre and some older bullet hells.  

confused?  dont be, its decently classic megaman gameplay brought into the modern day along with power ups for destroying enemies and not taking hits: speed up, gliding, patterns to help get more enemies down in tougher spots, all the way to straight double, quadra, and even more power!!!

at first i hated the game, i really did jsut want megaman gameplay, i was hating it, but when i gave it a fair shot i started to not only get better but love the unique gameplay thats been put into this game.  enemies are hard to deal with but easy once their patterns and behaviors are studied and thought out, and bosses are good test of your own dodging.

enemies arent a push over unlike in other megamanesc games and you cna only take so many hits but you will learn their patterns and with each boss ability unlocked, the abilites behavior will be perfect for countering the enemies, even the bosses (think about what ability's behavior, hit box, effect or more will counter the boss and you'll likely guess what their weakness it, giving you a massive advantage in both damage and making their best bullet patterns much easier to deal with).

each of the 12 stages, (YES BACK TO MEGAMAN 3 WITH THE ADDED ON LATER CONTENT :P ) also has 2 syega crystals that midly reveal themselves, if you pay attention to that or their shine when you hit them you can collect them for further upgrades to your slot upgrades.  collecting these will allow you to further push the limits of your characters powering up at your own choosing now unlike the first game, your special gauge to the side is used for any attacks but mostly boss abilites will drain it and is very easy to keep track of.  not only that but with each character played the hidding spots are changed respectively per character, based on what they can do and jsut generally relocating the syega again makes the hunt more fun per playthrough, i cant even memeorise where they all are because this will stump you half the time when youre jsut checking from memeory.  really enjoy the fresh feel you can get per cmapaign played.

i know ive only a few hours put into this pc version but ive 6 files of the varying difficulties, mixing between the characters and their unique playstyles, story and more, on my 3ds completed.  normal, hard, insane and even more random difficulty modifiers you can get from the menu section once you beat the game.  Inside System really know how to make the game last longer by it allowing itself to open up to you bit by bit offering more options and such to be played through giving you a different experience per playthrough.  

i highly recommend this game on either version.  though i will say a certain character youd wanna play from the first gmae if you beat it is playable only on the steam version.",1513060560,1513060583,True,5,0,0.547019064426422119,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I think the primary reason behind that is The Legend of Dark Witch 2 is 100% an homage, if not a 'love letter', to the Parodius and Megaman franchieses.

It starts with the base mechanics... You have in level upgrades that you can select as you accumulate 'Tres'. This is the Gradius/Parodius mechanic. A bar along the bottom of the screen grows as you kill enemies, the farther along the bar you are, the more powerful (relatively) the upgrade is. You can activate the power-up at anytime with a button press (B on an XBox controller). 100% the Parodius power-up system.

Each level has an end boss with a specific weapon that you learn once you beat them. To get to them it's a side scrolling, run and gun platformer. You can play the levels, for the most part, in any order. This is 100% the Megaman modality.

The two styles mesh perfectly together. Playing through on Casual, the game was simple enough but it had sufficent challenge and I'm looking forward to tackling the harder levels. 

I do see this as more of a Parodius X Megaman than Gradius based on the beautiful, charasmatic and cartoony characters and environments. Several of the stages are just full of detail and really harken back to the 32-Bit console days. TLoDW2 feels like a Sega Saturn game.

Even better, the mechanics aren't limited to just choose your power-ups and choose your path. There is also a light RPG mechanics where the Tres you accumulate is carried over. You can then exchange Tres, and the hidden Syega crystals, for upgrades to your weapons and power-ups. I horded Tres probably a lot longer than I should, mostly just upgrading the increased Tres drops by enemies (always take your XP multipliers when offered) and increased base damange. I strugged a bit on the final boss until I really committed to increasing my overall health (which was a mistake to hold off on) and unlocking at least the recovery magic item.

I was enjoying the game up until that point, but I realized I loved this title when presented with the new game plus and mini-game options. For New Game+ you unlock the bonuses you want with another form of the Syega currency. Things like higher jump, simplified blocking and increased health. Even better, you not only earn Syega by completing the game but by playing the mini-games! Spending some time with the video poker mode, I was able to unlock more bonuses. And while it's just video poker, I loved having a way to unlock power ups in a relaxed, low key manner.

Clearly a ton of thought and heart went into this game.",1508084091,1508084091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

More bosses, all of whom telegraph their attacks better.
The ""you suck, have a comeback"" mechanic that you AND the bosses have.
More descriptive difficulty - knowing which difficulties have health drops is a big deal.

El primer juego lo conoci en steam(a un precio muy bueno por lo que ofrece) y me enamore del estilo, es un megaman X en toda regla (un poco mas dificil). Esta secuela mejora los aspectos del primero, en cuanto desbloqueables y poderes asi como skills y que ahora posees un ""ulti"" que se va llenando conforme te hacen daño.

-Lo bueno: sigues la historia de Zizou, ahora tiene 3 personajes jugables, las eskills ahora las puedes escojer de forma manual; dependiendo de tu estilo de juego y esta un poquito mas largo que el primero.
-Lo malo: De entrada el precio (el primero sale a 1/4 de este xD) y la dificultad; el primero era un reto pero no imposible en esta ocasion incluso en normal se siente muy facil y los poderes que obtienes quedan sin sentido (a la vieja escuela de los megaman, matabas a cada boss con cada habilidad mas rapido) ya que bajas mas con tu habilidad normal.

可以买各种强化各种道具比如回血道具blablabla
（辅助道具属于一次性道具！请主动联想洛克人X6！）

普通难度整体有情了很多，损血也不必太担心 只要加足能量和火力，保证boss前满血，即可以速杀boss

不过整体感觉还是那种没有从1代的局限性中逃出来的比较尴尬的状态...强化/进化的部分7/10吧。

运行流畅度满分。老爷本儿都跑得动。这个必须点赞。9.9/10。

话说这画面比例是也有上PSV的打算？不得而知。之前是看了AGDQ的速攻视频才知道有2代。然而PSV版迟迟不出，等不得了才选择的steam版。1代我买的PSV版。不过实际上手之后算是感到有些抹不去的小失望吧。

BGM算是比较好，不过暂时没有发现1代里的那种头次听就让人爱上的曲目。7-1=6/10吧。

虽然大方向是推荐的不过打分不会太高。如果你有其他的选择的话可以把这个推到第三第四优先值甚至往后。因为140买个跟1代的捆绑包真的不算太值。

缺点之虎：手柄！
虽然支持非XBOX/PS的第三方手柄，不过对第三方手柄的支持不好（调键位花费了我很长时间，而且调键位不是“所有功能都在键位调整菜单里，你可以选定键位里某个特定的功能，然后按那个键就可以映射到该选项”的形式）
而且键位跟第三方手柄的键位无法有效对应（最好的选择还是搞个xbox的360手柄，组装也行）
分数：4/10

缺点之二：传承的宇巡的罪恶
最终关到最终boss击破前不要死命，而且要尽量少受伤（即使你买回血道具也好）不然死了一命再接的话有的你苦头吃。

最终boss恶俗，而且因为游戏本身的特性特别容易受伤。必须减分。完全没有吸收前作失败的教训。可能挑战有意思但我不知道什么原因就是不是很喜欢，可能感觉不到乐趣吧 而且也不是大多数人都喜欢这么做来折磨自己的。
分数：2/10

『魔神少女 エピソード2 願いへの代価』
Steamでも販売中の[u][url=store.steampowered.com/app/420770/]『魔神少女』[/url][/u]の続編。日本語あり。
基本的なシステムは前作とほぼ一緒なので、詳細は[u][url=steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060628914/recommended/420770/]前作レビュー[/url][/u]を見て下さい。

[h1]前作からの変更点[/h1]
前作から様々な面で改良が施されており、かなり遊びやすい仕様になっている。
[list]
[*]前作ではスキルを使う際にインストールゲージ（強化に必要なゲージ）を消費していたが、
今作は専用のキャパシティゲージ（時間ですぐ回復する）を消費するようになった。そのためスキルが非常に使いやすくなった。
[*]能力の強化の幅がかなり広がった。スピードアップやパワーアップといったスロットがカスタマイズできるようになり、
それぞれの強化に必要な純色のシェガーも前作と違い自由に扱えるようになった。
その純色のシェガーもかなり見つけやすくなった。（常にキラキラ光っているため）
[*]個々のステータスの強化の上限が大きく引き上げられたため、自キャラを大幅に強く出来るようになった。
[*]ショップにてお助けアイテムを買えるようになった。
「ライフ回復」や「オートブロッキング」等攻略がかなり簡単になるアイテムを販売している。
[*]リベンジマジックという必殺技が追加された。被弾の度に溜まるゲージを消費することで使用可能。
[*]キャラがよくしゃべるようになった。ボス戦前の会話等はフルボイスになり、
普段も、能力強化の度に強化した項目をしゃべってくれるようになった。
（そのためオート時に何を強化したかわかりやすくなった）

[/list]
・・・といった具合にかなり遊びやすくなっており、
超高難易度だった前作とは比較にならないほどヌルゲーとなっている。（最高難易度LUNATICもそれほど難しくはない）
2周目でアンロックされる2人目のプレイヤーキャラも、
1のが超上級者向けだったのに対し、2のはぶっとび火力を持つ超強キャラとなっている。
（ちなみにSteam版限定で、1のアンロックキャラが3人目として追加される。実績などは一切ないが・・・）

ボリュームも大きく増しており、
前作のボスが6人+1人+ラスボスだったのに対し、今作は8人+4人+ラスボスとステージ数大幅増量。
プレイヤーキャラもSteam版で追加されたキャラも含めると3人に増えている。
クリア後のおまけミニゲームも追加されており、リズム天国みたいなゲームもプレイできる。

[h1]その他[/h1]
前作の6ボスは全員登場。
そのうち3人はボスキャラとして続投、2人はショップ店員、1人はなんとプレイヤーキャラへ昇格している。
前作ファンにも嬉しい仕様。

ドット絵は前作のほぼ流用だが相変わらず超綺麗。
ステージ毎に用意されたBGMも、前作アレンジ含めて良BGM揃い。

[h1]総評[/h1]
前作プレイヤーはもちろん、
ロックマン等の往年の横スクロールアクションが好きな人には間違いなくオススメできるゲーム。
難易度も低い（特に最低難易度は、人生で初めてアクションゲームをプレイする人レベル）ので、
アクションが苦手で、可愛いキャラ目当てで買っても損はしないと思います。

また、ドットのクオリティが素晴らしく、雑魚キャラだけでもかなりの動きがあり、見ていて飽きません。

It's a simple little platfomer that allows you to upgrade your abilities as you make your way through the stages.

There are a few modes of difficulty starting with easy x 2, casual and higher.  I played it on casual and found the game to be way too easy and wishing it was more difficult by the third boss, of which I can easy dispatch in under a minute and you can't change the difficulty to anything harder than what you started with once you start the game.

Since the game has multiple weapons I feel it's time to talk about them.  Outside of your primary weapons the liner and comet all other weapons are useless are are more of a hinderance and not necessary.  You can beat the entire game with just Linear and comet.  Heck using the shop you can actually make it so you are overpowered before a stage even begins properly.

Collect experience from defeating enemies and redeem them to power up your player character, to make them faster and stronger. This game was released on the Nintendo 3DS eshop and, like the first game, has been reworked for a PC release. I worked on the beta release of the game.

I enjoyed this game very much on the 3DS and I am very glad it made its way to Steam much like the first game. Dark Witch 2 is a huge improvement over the first game in many ways, feautring more customization, more stages, more bosses, and more playable characters, including the Steam-exclusive Riva. There are shops to buy items to help you in stages or increase your power. There is much, much more content than the first game.

Among the best changes to the gameplay are customizeable upgrade slots and a new ""ammunition"" bar for using your boss skills, so your experience is not depleted when you want to use boss weapons. This is a very welcomed change for those who became frustrated with the ammo system in the first game. Additionally, collecting 4 crystals per stage allows for the player to choose which attributes they want to upgrade, as opposed to getting very specific ones.

The sprite work is fluid and cute, and the music is fantastic.

I have put lots of time into this game on the 3DS version. If you enjoyed the first Legend of Dark Witch game, I very highly recommend this one.",1484929456,1484933421,True,7,1,0.387442052364349365,4,False,True,False,False,,,

玩了一晚上来更新一下，相比一代完善不少，很多基本上是一代的升级版，洛克人的过关模式，沙罗曼蛇的升级系统，三目童子的商店模式，一些钻石在商店购买道具后也会很方便的找出，有一个地方需要升级boss技能才能撞破墙，另一个需要商店购买垫脚石，还有一个地方需要用穿墙的炮弹打出来，激光和自带的第三个招式都可以。
通关后，还是刷梭哈，另外加了个扭蛋解锁图鉴和类似osu节奏切西瓜的小游戏来刷纯晶石，打牌最效率。

虽然很好玩，但是卖这么贵就是不推荐。看看1代的价格再看看2代的价格。还不如省点钱去买其他游戏。",1484918520,1484932783,False,27,2,0.34130820631980896,10,True,False,False,False,,,

The Legend of Dark Witch is a action series originally developed for the 3DS, but has been brought to Steam with HD artwork and redesigned UI to make everything fit into one window.
The gameplay is very similar to the clasic Megaman games. You jump, shoot, fight bosses and gain their powers.
There's another gimmick though. While fighting enemies they will release tiny butterflies called Tres, which builds up a meter at the bottom of the screen that you can consume for a temporary upgrade for that stage or until you die. It works just like the upgrades in the games Gradius.
There's also a shop where you can use your collected Tres to buy passive upgrades, to give yourself more life, attack power or extra lives.
Overall a very fun game. The music is great, the controls are very responsive and can be customized to your liking. 
My biggest issue with the game is that even though there's a lot more stages than the first game, they all have very similar design. Most of the stages are just a straight runway.",1484911891,1484944922,True,35,1,0.504279732704162598,11,False,True,False,False,,,
