The stories and sprites are alright but quite basic and everything felt a little rushed or forced, outside of a couple story lines. The CG felt quite disappointing, they're not even pretty or special. Translation is alright, UI is clunky as hell, you can tell they didn't put much care in this port. The voice cast though is really good with classic voices from beloved VN/otoges. 

Overall, the heroine was quite annoying; if you enjoy the classical demure and clueless maiden it's fine I guess. The Soshi story really started well and then the heroine does something out of the blue that makes no sense outside of a narrative need for it, then spends her days sobbing about the consequences of her stupid actions.

When I saw that Dogenzaka Lab had anything to do with it, I must admit that I was 100% ready to roast it myself but oh how wrong I was.

The art is gorgeous, simple but very efficient. (Can we talk about Sera's hair colour ?)
As expected from japanese voice acting, the quality is top notch. They also played with the proximity and in some scenes, you'll hear the LI's voice much closer to your ear. (~ne, Soshi)
I liked how all characters had distinctive personalities and stories. Though, they can totally be categorized under well-known LI categories (outgoing, tsundere, more-serious-you-die, etc), I didn't feel like they were too much of these stereotypes.
While the story itself is not the grandest piece of litterature, I found it well-written, well-paced with few to no inconsistencies. I loved the way we kept learning more about what the situation actually is after each playthrough, it's really thrilling and got me hooked. I couldn't help but go for another character as soon as I was done with the previous one to learn more about the intrigue. In this regard, Soshi's route is the climax of the whole story. However, it disappointed me to some extent because we didn't learn as much as we did in other routes, it felt more like a summary of everything we've learnt so far, written black on white and in good chronological order to make sure we got it right but that's it. Given the momentum other discoveries triggered route after route, I expected more, a grand revelation that could change the whole perspective of what we've been said.
Even though the finale is not as grandiose as it could've been, I would still advise everybody who would like to give this game a try to play it in order (from left to right on the character's panel). For me, it went like : 
- first playthrough : Oh, it's that kind of basic manichean story.
- second playthrough : Hum, so this is what happened from a different perspective.
- third playthrough : Oh my, that's a big piece of information you've just revealed.
- fourth playthrough : We're getting closer, we're stepping inside of the boss room.
- fifth playthrough : The missing link has been found, everything falls into place.

Let's now talk about the drawbacks.
The biggest issue was the OST in my opinion. Musics are not bad per se, the opening one is way too loud/dynamic in the first few notes, but that's it. They're just lacking in quantity and/or diversity. Sometimes, the music doesn't feel right for the scene it is played in and it's been especially true for some endings such as Kei's and Soshi's. In Soshi's case, it simply ruined the feelings. I'm not gonna say anything more to not spoil it but if you want to enjoy his endings to their fullest, turn off the game's music and put on some emotional OST from your favourite playlist.
A few more backgrounds would have been good too, it makes no sense that the emperor has the same tiny little room as any other servant.
Last but not least, I didn't like the lack of consistency in character's distribution from route to route. The cafe owner, rebel leader and princess tutor are not always the same and it kinda annoyed and even confused me at times.

Each route (happy + normal ending) is around 3 hours. I felt like Soshi's was a little longer while Kei's a little shorter.",1678189993,1678189993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This will contain some spoiler at the end for Soshi's route. Just warning. 

I went in this route order - Kei > Sera > Toki > Kagemitsu > Soshi

Kei's route was alright. It felt a bit fast but had a little bit of charm. I guess it was overall...average? Not really exciting or overly interesting but it had a bit of feels
. 
Sera I liked a bit more than Kei because of his personality. It would have been better if the MC wasn't so...submissive? Also a average route.
 
Toki was my overall favorite in this entire game. Now he had a personality. After two eh routes with mellow main guys and the overly submissive MC, Toki was like a breath of fresh air. He was fun. Of all the routes, he brought out more personality from the MC. She was still submissive but it was bearable and she actually did take some action. They bantered a little and the overall environment around the MC was just more enjoyable. 

Kagemitsu was probably my second least favorite route just because I didn't like his personality. Quality-wise, I think his route was probably second best. He had some backstory with the MC that kind of felt like it was just giving information more to lead up to Soshi's route. He gave of a little bit of a sadistic vibe in the beginning but it didn't really go anywhere, which was a bit disappointing since it would have made him more interesting. He felt too attached to the MC from the start. That was probably because he was an over-the-top childhood friend cliche. He constantly complimented the MC and went easy on her. She didn't really grow and felt so bland next to him since he pretty much worshiped her.

SPOILERS COMING (Soshi's Route)


Soshi was really something else. Honestly, even after having read it all I don't know what to think. I don't understand how they allowed this route to go out like it did. I played in English, so maybe it was just a translation thing but it was just so out there. [spoiler] It started out normal. MC was curious about her brother and wanted to see if he was the same person she vaguely remembered from her childhood. There was some memories with him that were jogged during the route. They were slowly getting closer and it was hinting that she was starting to develop feelings for him that were romantic, which is strange but I sort of saw it coming. They are first introduced as siblings in the beginning of the game then it is said they are half-siblings then they say they are step-siblings. It is pretty hard to tell what their actual relationship is. From what I understood they are indeed half-siblings but they constantly say they aren't actually related even though they supposedly have the same dad. ANYWAYS, I got a bit offtrack. As I said before, it started out normal and despite their complicated familial-or-not-familial relationship, I was sort of enjoying it. Soshi's personality was alright and seemed to be developing. Then just as they were getting closer to each other and hinting romance coming up....BAM!!!! MC tries to murder him. Yeah...that is right...she literally tries to poison him. There is no lead up to that at all. It comes from nowhere and confuses the crap out of me when it happens. Literally no thought process goes behind it. She is worried about him because he overworks himself and is tired and wants to make him tea but then poisons it. He acts like he has been on to her the entire time even though there has been no hints that any of this is going to happen. She acts all upset that he found out...BECAUSE HE WON'T TRUST HER NOW. I was just thinking wHAT...the entire time. She continues to act like it isn't a big deal and he does the same even though he casually brings it up sometimes. They are distant for a bit then he suddenly starts acting crazy. They dance at the ball that happens on every route....then she suddenly realizes she is in love with him? He starts acting even crazier. She tries to stop him then comes to the conclusion that she has to try to kill him AGAIN. While she is there to KILL HIM...he suddenly tells the truth about what is going on and she is like...oh so he had reasons. Then just when I think things can't get any more out there...he confesses his love for her. They never mention that she was there to kill him again and they live happily ever after? One more thing. After they are romantic...she suddenly start calling him brother. Even though she usually called him Soshi before she claims it is just a habit from before???????? [/spoiler] Let me just say....it is a mess.

There are [b]five romanceable men[/b]; each route has [b]15 chapters[/b] (they are very short though) and there are [b]two endings[/b]: a happy and a normal ending. When you reach the normal ending, you'll see it in chapter 15 itself. But if you gather all the points necessary during your choices, you'll get to read an extra chapter, the ""happy ending"" one. [b]Please notice that one of the guys is the brother of the protagonist and she has the option to romance him.[/b] There are [b]no adult scenes[/b] in this visual novel, though. It was published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/dogenzaka]Dogenzaka Lab[/url] on Steam and developed by another company, [url=https://twitter.com/OPERAHOUSE_info]OperaHouse Corporation[/url].

You play as a young girl called Amane Kosaka (you can change her name). She lives in the countryside, until one day her brother orders that she must move to the central city of the Empire (he's the current ruler). Amane is a sort of ""cookie cutter"" otome heroine: she's young, inexperienced, naive, doesn't think too much of herself, etc. It can be hard to relate to someone like her at times, but that's fine. It would be a lot better if she was a bit more independent or just stood out for herself. She could be really worse, though. Anyway, let's talk a bit about the guys and their routes. [b]Sera Kouichirou[/b], the serious bodyguard, was my first choice. He's the quiet type, and his route was... okay? I mean, nothing much happens. It's very straightforward, and suddenly the story reaches its climax. [b]Tanba Touki[/b], the playboy and café owner, wasn't my favorite character, but his route was my favorite. I'm not into the ""flirty"" type in otome VNs, but Tanba was a sweet man. And I actually liked his route, it was more interesting than the other guys' stories since it happened outside the castle. [b]Yoshimine Kei[/b], the captive prince and private tutor, is very handsome. But... is it me or does he also have a very punchable face? I'm dead serious. Anyway, I liked his backstory, it was sad. But his route was also rushed, and he changes his behavior towards Amane too fast. [b]Togawa Kagemitsu[/b], the childhood friend, was... alright. He's even sweeter than Tanba. But his route was [i]so boring[/i], oh my god. I fell asleep twice, I'm not kidding. It was cute, sure, but just... boring. I'm sorry. And finally, we have Amane's brother, [b]Amazaki Soushi[/b], the cold emperor. His route was like a rollercoaster, it starts fine, and then suddenly [spoiler]Amane tries to poison him out of the nowhere[/spoiler] and things just go downhill from there. And then they change again? I don't know, it was very confusing and rushed. Not that I was expecting much dept, but some coherence would've been nice. [b]Overall, the main routes are plain boring[/b]. I'm usually a fast reader, but it took me a bit more of time to read through this VN since I fell asleep during Kagemitsu's route. Which is really a shame, the art and VA are great here. But the story wasn't. [spoiler]Also, the happy endings felt so incomplete! I wanted to see more, it felt like something was missing. They were rushed and ended out of nowhere.[/spoiler]

The art style is good, and the guys are overall handsome. There is awkward anatomy in a few CGs though like really big hands, small heads, etc. It didn't bother me so much, but I'm not sure about other people. The BGM is nice as well, it's not a masterpiece, but it's pleasant. My only complaint about the UI of this game is the fact that the auto button isn't really for automatic text, it's to skip read text. The highlight of TCE is definitely the VA: the voice actors did an amazing job! Actually, the whole game has VA, not just the romanceable guys. The protagonist is the only silent character. I mean, it's great that we get such good VA, but in the end, if the story is just boring, I don't think it's much worth it. It took me 11 hours to complete all routes, reading at a slow pace. Mostly because like I've said before, the game is tedious and I fell asleep. 

5/10. In the end, I don't recommend [i]The Charming Empire[/i]. Yes, it's visually appealing and the VA is great, but... It's [b]very[/b] expensive for such a boring game. I can only recommend this VN when it's heavily discounted or bundled AND if you're really curious about it. There are better and cheaper otome games out there, and even for free.

Honestly, the story was medicore and was very easy to play through. There were many plot holes in the story especially in Soshi's arc. The story need many developments and the VN creators should know by now that submissive weak women are not a trend anymore. The characterization is okay, but need more depth and twists. You get the easy going Tanba, strict Soshi,, kind Kagemitsu, tsundere Kei and idk-how-to-react Sera. The art was pretty good not many complaints there. One major flaw in the story was that everything was confined into one single place, the heroine is just restricted to the palace mostly. This was debunked in Tanba's route which was interesting.  But the rest of the routes were concentrated on the palace. 

The endings seems incomplete, the players would want to know what would happen next or extra bonus secret scenes maybe. Those were absent and would have made the game more interesting.

I wouldn't want to recommend this game to anyone UNLESS you enjoy hearing the characters speak (which is not present in many visual novels).

Since periods/eras in Japanese history tend to be based on either the Emperor who is ruling, or the Shogunate in charge, the Taisho period corresponds to Emperor Taisho, who reigned from 1912 to 1926. It succeeded the Meiji era and followed by the Showa era.

This is an alternate Earth however. Because the protagonist's stepbrother is the Emperor, and a lot of things start happening that... are a bit out of place. Like revolutions that seem to happen in most of the routes (which, if they were formenting in real Japanese history never really got started).

Anyway, the five love interests are well-formed, with a good voice acting crew behind them. The romances themselves are decent. And the art... well, it is gorgeous. The protagonist is a bit of a fish-out-of-water, so maybe her heavy dose of ""otome-protagonist-syndrome"" can be somewhat absolved. Not by much, but still...

This game is not outright bad and some people might find it entertaining, but I was disappointed with the story and characters.[/h1]

It was quite difficult for me to review this game simply because I have seen half of its content before I even launched it. Two of my Steam friends purchased the Charming Empire almost as soon as it was released and, of course, they posted lots of screenshots. The main problem was that my friends had absolutely different opinion about the game. One of them was frustrated with the main character and said many times that she is as stupid as a piece of rock; she was also quite disappointed with the overall quality of the game pointing out that the writing is poor, the characters are like soulless paper and the art is nothing special. On the other hand, my second friend absolutely loved the game. She complemented cute boys, romantic parts, dramatic events and the art in general. Now imagine my confusion after such reviews that are as different as black and white!

About a month ago I finally got the chance to try out the Charming Empire and see for myself what kind of game it is. Oh boy, that was…interesting, to say the least. I had to take a break from the game at some point because of my work, but today I returned to it to complete some routes and write a review. Oh, also: I had accidentally skipped the Prologue when I first launched the game and started with the main storyline, but I cannot say I missed much by doing so.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405898237

[h1]What I liked (with some exceptions)[/h1]

I liked three things about the Charming Empire. 

First, voice actors. Hands down, they did a marvelous job here! Each character has their own personality thanks to their work [i](if only this very personality was supported by any kind of character-development or god damn originality!)[/i]. I even have some all time favorites now. Side-characters are also voiced, but, unfortunately, do not have even basic sprites.

Second, the art. Here I have to agree with my second friend – I liked CGs and characters’ sprites. Each was neatly drawn and I will definitely save them for my collection of good CGs. However, there is one thing that was bad almost all of the time – backgrounds. Just look at the room of the main character:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405899784

Maybe I am just being picky, but these curtains are just killing me, as well as the whole computer-drawn interior with items that do not go well together. Characters look out of place if you compare them to the overall quality of backgrounds, which are not that great. It seems that developers did not really bother while drawing/editing them and made each picture completely lifeless, and this is extremely sad! 

Last, the music was nice. Nothing too impressive, but not bad either. Tracks usually went well with different situations and emotions. And I did like the opening music – it was always pleasant to listen to it when I launched the game.

[h1]Why I did not like the game in the end[/h1]

First, all boys are nothing else but basic stereotypes. Of course we have a childhood friend, a cold guy who is actually very shy and kind, a mysterious guy, a womanizer, and even an older brother. I have played lots, lots of otome titles and most of them had love interests like this, so it seems I have finally grown tired of them to the extent that they make me yawn or roll my eyes.

Second, the main character. What can I say here. I admire strong girls who have a distinct personality and can go against others without being rude, girls who have brains and know how to talk. Amane (the MC; I named her Kaede) has none of these. She is bland, meek to the extent when it becomes annoying, and outright stupid! She cannot defend her own opinion, she does not know what is going on in the kingdom, she does not understand people and their emotions. I do not mind naïve characters if they grow over time and become sensible people by the end of the story. Let us remember Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon, for example. But Amane stays the same for the whole game. And this is what makes me dislike her.

Last, I think that characters’ relationships were developing too fast. Let us take Kei, for example. One moment he hates you, the next one – gives you a friendly smile and seems to be madly in love with you. Kagemitsu’s was outright boring because I am not very keen on all these childhood friends’ stories. The whole rebellion part did not have any real base behind it; I just could not understand the reasoning behind their actions (this includes Soshi). 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405898094

This also brings the issue that each route was quite short. It took me about 2-3 hours to complete the first one, I think. Normal and Good endings had hardly any variety in text, so there was nothing left but to skip it. All answers were very predictable and some endings looked rushed.

[h1]Would I recommend this game?[/h1]

Even though it is not a really bad game, I do not think I can wholeheartedly recommended it, and this is the reason why this review has a negative mark. The Charming Empire is a stereotypical otome title that does not bring anything new to the genre. Voice actors and art cannot save a visual novel with too common characters, a cheesy story and a boring main character, who is the final nail in this bright coffin.

Still, I can recommend the Charming Empire to people who are looking for a very light and short read and are not too fed up will all the same otome characters. Nice art and great voice acting might keep you entertained until the end, I hope. However, if you want some good romance, characters with developed and distinct personalities, and an engaging story, then you should look elsewhere. I would suggest [i]Amnesia: Memories, 1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum[/i] or [i]The Confines Of The Crown[/i] instead.

I'm sorry. The art is so awesome you might get it just for that. It is really lovely. The voice acting is very good.....The actual story itself is so rushed and yet slow to progress it is infuriating. I stopped playing before finishing the last route and I have never done that before. I just hit a wall thinking, ""if the story is going to be like this and the MC is going to keep being inconsistent and dense... do I even care to see the end?..."" I know that sounds awful but the story is either painfully predictable or completely unexpected (in a bad way that is confusing). There are moments (almost always the beautiful art) that made me keep going but then it would just get annoying again...

You have to play in a sort of order or things will be revealed in certain routes. The MC is painfully self depricating and clumsy and anxious and sad and pitiable that I don't want to be her and don't see why the guys like her. Oh i almost fell and he caught me like 4 different times... I ran to his room because there was a storm... I cry in every other scene...I need to be saved... I faint from surprise... I run into plot devices like it's my job haha so clumsy... -_-... Having all of those traits and then coming out with insightful or shockingly mature revelations out of absolutely no where is unrealistic and annoying and just to further the plot obviously because she just goes right back to her sad, emotional, pitiful, anxious, clumsy, childish self.

[h1] PROS: [/h1]
+ Fully (except protagonist) voice acted, and the voice acting is GOOD
+ Each route has a mixture of fluff and angst that works well
+ Protagonist isn't a completely helpless weakling, which I always appreciate
+ Clear indication of ""good"" choices, which may be a turn-off for some but is a plus for me
[h1]CONS:[/h1] 
The entire Soshi route was awful. That's actually almost the only con for me so I'll detail it here[spoiler]
- There's weird transphobic stuff with the tailor character, it's just clumsy and uncomfortable
- The protagonist just like, poisons her brother? Without really explaining it beforehand? She acts with conviction even though you appear to be growing closer but once he catches her she spends the rest of the game snivelling over it.
- THE WHOLE INCEST THING. Honestly, I had to force myself to finish Soshi's 'good' ending and it's really not my thing. She's still calling him 'Brother' happily while they're living together. Really really actively disliked that.
[/spoiler]
- I am somewhat of a collector (gathered every ending/CG/literally anything from Ozmafia!!!) and I wasn't interested enough to go back through the routes for both endings. Not a lot of depth to the choices and I wasn't really interested in the outcomes.

I personally enjoyed Toki’s route more than Soshi’s, which ultimately leads to me saying that 3 out of the 5 routes has something substantial to offer.  Thankfully, all the characters were decent guys who weren’t hungry to lecherously harass the MC at a moment’s notice, but it’s easy to say a minimum of two routes weren’t very memorable.

The biggest negative issue of this game is the MC.  It’s really annoying how she goes with the motions and accepts whatever situation is thrown at her without a second thought.

I went into it thinking it HAD to be better than Dogenzaka's in-house developed catalogue, and I was wrong, so very very wrong.  I don't understand how anyone can derive enjoyment out of it as I literally cannot bring myself to read through more than a chapter at a time due to sheer boredom, and they're the shortest chapters I've ever read through in a VN.  The writing is juvenile and simplistic to the extreme with a paper-thin plot that takes FOREVER to get moving, and when it does is so insanely illogical I just want to shoot these characters to end the pain they're putting me through.  But that doesn't accurately convey how badly I hate this MC.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=926949032
Our milquetoast protagonist has no discernable personality AT ALL, and is frustrating beyond belief with how wishy-washy she is in just about every situation. The guys are basically cookie cutouts of the most stereotypical otome tropes, which isn't horrible IF there's some decent romantic tension to push things along; but the MC is so brainless that she spends most of the story shooting down the possibility they even like her, thus negating all potential feels to be had! That's not to mention how incredibly naive and childish her thoughts are, so much so that at times you'd think this 16 year old girl may actually have a developmental disorder.  I'm not kidding, it's really that bad.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928106068
It's abundantly clear that a majority of the production budget went into paying the voice actors, because that's all this game has going for it. The artwork isn't even that great. Sure the character sprites are nice, but the CGs are so emotionlessly boring that I'm not even sure why they bothered.  Listen, I know people are desperate for good otome, especially ones with voice acting, but do not waste your money on this garbage.  It may look and sound pretty, but if you value storytelling at all, DO NOT add this waste of space to your library.  There are far better voiced otome games on Steam for the same price OR less.  Do yourself a favor and grab one of those instead, or if you already own them all, play one of them again.  I promise you won't regret it.

Story...

As a fan of visual novels with a historical setting, this immediately captured my attention. Yet, the setting wasn't as medieval as I expected it to be. It is an interesting mix of the past and the modern day, which I ended up accepting easily, as the focus is on the story.

The routes offer variety, with a slice of forbidden romance. Even if all of the routes happen in the same areas, but they turned to out to be different from each other, beside a few aspects. Some of the plot twists can be quite predictable, but I couldn't guess everything ahead. In a way, that makes the routes more interesting, because you figure out something, and something you don't. The game also offers a bigger mystery, that you will eventually figure out.

Characters...

I liked all of the romanceable males enough to enjoy their routes. Admittedly, I found one of them to be boring, but rarely all characters are to my tastes. The males represent certain types; we have a flirt, a tsundere, a stoic one, a childhood friend and an intimidating older brother. While they are typical, at least you can tell which one(s) you're going to like. Now, I know some people are uncomfortable with the brother being a romantic interest, but the game is really tame content wise.

The main character is pretty innocent, but she had more inner strength and temper than I expected. I liked her for that. But her actions on one route made no sense to me. I guess it was put there as a ""shock factor"", but I was just really annoyed by what she did. I'm surprised the love interest even forgave her for what she did in the end. Otherwise, I wasn't bothered by her actions - or lack of them.

Gameplay...

Like most visual novels, this game asks you to make decisions. Not all decisions are wrong, so it gives you more chances to act more like yourself, without making you lose affection points. It was interesting aspect for sure.

Art...

It's pleasant to look at, as it usually is in visual novels. I enjoyed all the colorfulness, especially on the love interests, but the fact that they rarely changed clothes was a bit strange, with the exception of the ball event. Apparently everyone always sleeps, eats and walks in the same clothing, every day. And we never got see the main character in her dress.

Voice Acting / Music...

The highlight of this game was definitely the voice acting. As this was originally a mobile game, I didn't expect that great performances, but I was pleasantly surprised. You can hear both the laughter and the agony in their voices, as you should be able to. The voice actors are really famous around otome game and anime world, so it makes sense they do their work with passion. You can definitely hear every emotion in their voices, no matter the situation.

I didn't particularly notice the music. Because I didn't notice it, it wasn't bad. 

Conclusion...

I enjoyed the game. While some of the things can get serious, it isn't as dark as it could have been. It was a nice change, and not too full of anguish. If you want some quick, fluffy romance, this is for you.

BUT. The price is too high for a game that doesn't even take 20 hours to finish completely. The voice acting naturally brings up the price, but compared to some other games that have the same price, it definitely doesn't have enough length.

I bought this on sale, and I'm glad I did. I have no regrets buying the game, but the full price would have been too much.",1493565046,1493626756,True,34,3,0.756822943687438965,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros: 
* Interesting premise.
* Overarching storyline of political unrest and a corrupt empire. 
* Improved translations in comparison to previous Dogenzaka Lab titles.
* Light and cute read that is enjoyable for a relaxing game experience. 

Cons: 
* Writing and execution heavily suffers due to it originally being a mobile port.
* Prologue is extremely abrupt and short, and you're immediately thrown into the main storyline. 
* Sentences are short and condensed to fit into text boxes normally seen a small mobile screen.
*  If you're looking for a detailed and immersive storyline like [url=https://visualnovelreviews.com/2017/04/21/nightshade-hyakka-hyakurou-review/] Nightshade (another April release)[/url] then this isn't the game for you. 


[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT 3/5[/b]

Recommended Play Order: Yoshimine Kei → Koichiro Sera → Tanba Toki → Togawa Kagemitsu → Amazaki Soshi. Soshi must be played last due to spoilers and storyline flow, otherwise the story loses its impact and doesn't make much sense.

Pros:
* Plenty of cute and fluffy character moments
* Yoshimine Kei's route was unexpectedly really cute, and definitely my favourite from the game. 
* Soshi's route tied up all the missing elements within all the other stories, and explained the overarching storyline. 

Cons:
* Character routes are fairly repetitive as they all follow the same linear sequence of events, that eventually leads to the endings with each bachelor.
* All the character routes were used as a build up for Soshi's story, and as a result were lacking in terms of individual storyline. 
* Character personalities were very inconsistent for some of the routes. 
* Despite how similar and connected the stories were to one another, the bachelors made little to no appearances in the other character routes.
* This was very disappointing considering the game length, and it made it difficult to develop meaningful attachments towards the characters.


[b]DESIGN 4/5[/b]

Pros:
* Highlight of the game.
* Clean and crisp character designs, sprites were consistent with the CGs.
* Lovely protagonist design
* Many CGs for each bachelor, in spite of the relatively short game length. 


Cons: 

* Backgrounds were digital paintings of photographs/real life images. 
* Sprites looked noticeably distinct from the background, and distracted from the artwork itself.
* Although common for mobile ports, it looked pixellated on the PC Screen and definitely took away from the overall impression of the game. 


[b]MUSIC AND VOICE ACTING 3/5[/b]

Pros:

* Famous and prolific voice acting cast, with previous work on popular otome games.
* Emulated their personalities well, and definitely carried the monotonous story writing. 
* For example: 
* Yoshimine Kei | VA: Masuda Toshiki | 増田 俊樹 |
Taisho x Alice series as Kaguya, Marginal #4 series as Kirihara Atom, Haikyu!! as Chikara Ennoshita
* Koichiro Sera | VA: Eguchi Takuya | 江口 拓也 |
Taisho x Alice series as Gretel, Collar x Malice as Hoshino Kazuki, Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak Academy as Sonosuke Izayoi
* Kagemitsu Togawa | VA: Toyonaga Toshiyuki | 豊永 利行 |
Marginal #4 series as Makishima Shy, Yuri!!! On Ice as Yuuri Katsuki
* Tanba Toki | VA: Kakihara Tetsuya | 柿原 徹也 |
Amnesia series as Shin, Code: Realize series as Viktor Frankenstein, Kenka Banchou Otome as Mirako Yuuta
* Amazaki Soshi | VA: Tsuda Kenjirou | 津田 健次郎 |
Yu-Gi-Oh series as Seto Kaiba, Hakuoki series as Chikage Kazama, Nightshade as Hanzo Hattori


Cons: 

* Music was an improvement from previous Dogenzaka Lab titles, but still suffers from blatant looping. 
* Incorporated very little tracks, and became repetitive by the end of the first playthrough. 
* Hindered the great voice acting. 


[b]SYSTEM 3/5[/b]

Pros:

* System design and UI is quite nice for a mobile port.
* Incorporates all the basic functions such as save/load slots, CG Gallery, skip, text speed etc.
* Voice lists were a nice touch. 
* Skip speed was surprisingly quite fast, which helped a lot in subsequent playthroughs. 


Cons: 

* The character select and prologue options are reminiscent of a mobile game, as you would purchase their individual route and lock yourself into their story.
* Ease of use felt clunky overall.
* Would have liked a scene recollection option for the CGs and a ‘jump’ button to skip to the next decision.


[b]CONCLUSION[/b]


* Had mixed feelings about the game. 
* If you’re looking for a light-hearted and short read, with beautiful art and great voice acting then this is the title for you.
* The overarching plot is relatively simple, with a greater focus on the cute character moments and relationship development for the bulk of the game.
* It has a lot of CGs with every character, in spite of the short length.
* Can overlook a lot of the shortcomings of the game, if you consider the fact that it was originally a mobile port.
* Still significantly cheaper than purchasing individual mobile routes and side stories. 
* However, would not recommend purchasing the game unless on sale. Other games of the same price point in the steam store offer significantly more content. For example: [url=https://visualnovelreviews.com/2017/03/25/amnesia-memories-review/]Amnesia Memories[/url] [url=https://visualnovelreviews.com/2017/04/21/nightshade-hyakka-hyakurou-review/]Nightshade[/url] & [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/337930/]Nameless ~the one thing you must recall~.[/url]
* Enjoyable game to play and a nice breather from more content-heavy and darker themed games. 
* If you're looking for something really worth your money in terms of content, then I would not recommend The Charming Empire. 
* Although it isn't without it's faults, it was definitely a huge improvement overall from previous Dogenzaka Lab games and a good sign for better releases in future.

The main problem is that she is a completely immature bimbo. It would have been fine if she was a five-year-old princess maneuvering her way through a political system of this world, but then they added the romance element with characters much more mature than her. I cannot see how or why any of these characters fall in “love” with her on that kind of level because she IS like a CHILD. 

---One thing this game has going for it is the fact that each route is different from the others, which together, paints a bigger picture of the overall story. Each route rarely overarches the other. Unfortunately, individually each story is subpar and even IF you play all the routes to get that bigger picture, it does not, in my opinion, make up for the individual story routes. Individually, each story seems rushed and incomplete and the romance, which is the forefront of its focus, unrealistic and forced. 

---I am starting to get annoyed at the continuing theme of how girls/woman need to be aware of man and that they are dangerous. It was funny when I first saw this technique, at first, but it always end up with the girls being those stupid bimbo’s. I think this happens when the whole story makes the romance the forefront instead of a side plot beside the bigger problem. The subplot in Charming Empire is the fact the citizens are disgruntled over the government which always takes a back seat to the romance. As a result, the writing is mediocre. Most otome games, unfortunately, are rift with mediocre writing with only a few being acceptable or good. FYI this was one thing I liked about nightshade because the focus was on the political, escape theme and the romance second. When you buy otome games, you often are pretty much paying for the art. 

---speaking of art, the art is good and there really is nothing more to say about it, except the protagonist. I am sorry, but they even made her look extremely young to me, but if she was just a five-year-old maneuvering her way through the political system (without the romance) than I would be fine with her. 

---Interesting discovery. While I was playing, I found that one voice sounded familiar to me, but from where? So, I looked it up and low and behold! Tanba’s voice is the same voice that played Shin from amnesia memories! All those years playing the piano finally paid off in differentiating the differences in pitch and tone! Yay! It was really strange to see the voice that played such a tsundere character play a happier go lucky one with a slight touch of yandere overtones.

...I just knew it when Shin said he wished he was a bit more like Toma that he had some kind of hidden fetish. As Tanba, [spoiler] he kidnaps the protagonist and locks her up in a warehouse storeroom. [/spoiler] Damn you Toma! You corrupted Shin! Haha jokes aside. His style of clothing has improved at least and he doesn’t call you an idiot all the time though he probably should. I hate this protagonist. 

---I played two routes and decided to request a refund. I really did not care for it. It was extremely juvenile. I would have liked to give a full review and if Steam decides not to refund me I suppose I will bear with it and write more later but I hope not. I rather not own this game.",1493123025,1493127515,False,7,0,0.539798974990844727,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was excited for this because I was fresh off of playing Hanzo's route ([i]Nightshade[/i]) for the umpteenth time and was ready for some more slow burn, healthy love. I watched the trailer and saw beautiful men, terrific voice acting, some nice art—even a character that gave off some [i]Nightshade[/i]-Hanzo vibes and another man with ombre black hair and a silky bass tone to match (the work of Kenjiro Tsuda who also plays Hanzo). All of this was shattered when I decided to play the latter character's route first (Soshi) and it turned out he's the MC's older brother. He's not related by blood but the fact that she looks at him as a sibling would, constantly reminds the reader that he's her brother, and [i]still[/i] wants to romance him is creepy in and of itself (so yeah, incest warning).

Everything culminated down to me sending this game back for a refund. I haven't played very long so you can take my opinions with a grain of salt. Even reading the spoilers in positive reviews and watching videos of what I ""missed out on""—from the way the MC is treated, to the watered down characters, and the lackluster plot—have only reaffirmed my decision. The content they're offering isn't worth full price. I've read free visual novels with no voice acting that featured better storytelling within 5 minutes than half an hour of this. What little trust I had left with Dogenzaka Lab to publish good content has dwindled with every recycled VN that got pushed out by them.

Back to Hanzo for me.

There are five routes, and all of them are quite safe and innocent. It's very hard to not get the happy endings, and I would say the price is only so high because you're paying for the name voice actors. There is not a lot of character art nor is there a lot of CG art- only six charaters have character art (the player and the five guys), and there's not even pictures for characters that appear in multiple storylines, like your personal maid and the tutor you have that isn't Kei. In fact, in most of the storylines, the other guys don't even appear outside their storylines, and they are never mentioned by name. The only exception aside from Soshi (who has to appear) is Kagemitsu, who is only completely absent from one of the five storylines. I bring this up because, well, you can't exactly get a feel for the guys outside their routes as a result.

Further, not much changes in each route outside the ""how"". The general outline is the same in each storyline, the same events happen, just the order is different and the specifics of the events change. This, I kind of feel, is in poor taste when so many otome have very different storylines depending on the chosen route. It's easy to predict things in the story once you spot the recurring trend, so the plot twist that [spoiler]the guy you pursue is the/a leader of the Rebellion[/spoiler] is ruined, since aside from one route, this is always the case.

It's frustrating to play a game like this and have it be so... repetitive. If you are curious, these are the recurring plot elements: [spoiler] There is a festival, part of the town burns down, you go to ask Soshi to do something about it and he refuses (his own storyline is the exception to this rule, but that's due to what part of town burned), there is a ball, you have a dance lesson with the guy you picked to prepare for it, Soshi announces your engagement to a foreign power at said ball, there is a rebellion shortly before your departure that your chosen guy leads (Koichiro is the only one who doesn't lead the Rebellion but he is still an important figurehead in it), the Palace burns down (Kei's route is the exception because the climax doesn't happen in the palace), you get together with your chosen guy forever[/spoiler]. The order may change, but those events happen in all storylines. There is one thing, though, that was a gigantic ""WTF"" because it comes out of nowhere and isn't properly explained for quite some time- [spoiler] that being when the protagonist tries to poison Soshi in his storyline[/spoiler]. And even when it is explained, it still makes no sense.

The story is quite basic I think and, as noted, does not really change from path to path. It's very safe- nothing truly exciting happens and the protagonist is never in any real danger. The voices are nice on the ears, particularly Soshi's deep, bored drawl, and the guys are all quite handsome. As characters, I didn't enjoy them as much as I've enjoyed characters in other games- Kei was a rather weak tsundere, Koichiro was an all right dandere and probably the second most enjoyable, Kagemitsu was ungodly boring due to being a generic nice guy childhood friend type (which is a pity, because I really like Toshiyuki Toyonaga's voice), Toki was merely all right and to be honest I don't have much of an opinion on him aside from I would have liked him more as a yandere (I said the same about Kagemitsu when playing his route- anything to make him interesting and less one dimensional), and I... really don't know what to say about Soshi. I certainly liked him best, but I don't know what to say about him, aside from the feeling that most of the effort was put into making him the most appealing option despite being your stepbrother.

Much as it pains me to admit it, I can't really recommend it. It's fun, it's pretty, the voices are a delight to listen to, but I've played free otome that have more substance to them even without voices. So while I think I enjoyed the game, I do not recommend it unless it's on sale for 75% off or so.",1493051106,1493273978,False,23,0,0.668773829936981201,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2.Кей - личный наставник. Застенчивый и милый. Принц побежденной страны, а теперь пленник империи. (Поэтому он относится к героине довольно сурово.)
3.Коичиро Сера – телохранитель. Сдержанный и нелюдимый.
4.Кагемицу Тогава – помощник, правая рука Соши. Милый и добрый. Друг детства героини и ее брата. 
5.Соши Амазаки - одинокий лорд, правитель страны и брат главной героини. Холодный и расчетливый.  Даже свою сестру он готов использовать в качестве политического инструмента.

Но этой идиллии пришел конец, когда Соши Амазаки (брат Амане, правитель империи) решил забрать сестру в свой дворец и сделать из нее настоящую принцессу.

«The Charming Empire» порадует вас отличной озвучкой всех персонажей известными актерами.  Главная героиня не имеет озвучки. Так уж повелось в японских новеллах – главных героинь не озвучивают. Жаль. Многим приятно было бы слышать мелодичный голос вместо чтения текстов. Видимо, японцы считают, что под главной героиней каждый должен представить себя, а озвучка этому может помешать. Это уже стало традицией для японских визуальных новелл.

В игре великолепные арты и очаровательные персонажи. Иллюстратор Мицуйя Фудзи в очередной раз радует своих поклонников качественными работами.

Шикарная романтическая отомэ с великолепной музыкой, с качественной озвучкой, прекрасными артами и милыми персонажами. Все в лучших традициях и в исконном японском качестве. Рекомендую!

En al caso de este juego el dibujo actua como una obra conceptual a través de dibujos artísticos para rerpesentar a los protagonistas de las historias, y secundariamente actua de soporte por medio de secciones de dibujos arquitectónicos.

Su centralización hacia la obra conceptual en este caso sería el dibujo artístico de los personajes de los chicos mediante su puesta en escena, quedando los guiones de las historias y el dibujo arquitectónico como secundarios o como misioneros que apoyan al dibujo artístico: Tenemos el dibujo artístico y arquitectónico junto al guión como los tres ingredientes principales de las visual novel. Entre los tres se supone que tienen que formar un buen conjunto de base.

Se compone de varias historias independientes que de base compartirán al mismo protagonista femenino; podríamos estar hablando de 5 visual novel en una. Su precio de salida creo que esta totalmente justificado, me he tirado casi 7 horas en completar la primera historia.

El juego está basado totalmente hacia una relación del protagonista principal con cada uno de estos chicos. La novela tratará de conocerlos y por ello se han separado drásticamente por historias independientes, para intentar encontrar los mejores encuadres y ajustes sobre su base desde la perpectiva propia, única y singular del protagonista. Por medio de unas cuantas opciones de dialogo derivaremos una mínima parte del guión hacia nuestra decisión para determinar la conclusión en sus dos posibles finales que pueden darse, uno normal y otro bueno, como desafio superflúo tendriamos que llegar al final bueno.

Como comentaba antes, la novela se centra en el dibujo artístico y en este caso de los chicos. Yo creo que en general es una novela gráfica muy notoria por empezar por una escasa aunque excelente realización de los chicos y acabar por un gran guión narrativo.
