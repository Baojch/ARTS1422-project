[spoiler]A wealthy man wanted to go hunting in a part of northern Canada where few people had ever hunted. He traveled to a trading post and tried to find a guide to take him. But no one would do it. It was too dangerous, they said. Finally, he found an Indian who needed money badly, and he agreed to take him. The Indian's name was DéFago.

They made camp in the snow near a large frozen lake. For three days they hunted, but they had nothing to show for it. The third night a windstorm came up. They lay in their tent listening to the wind howling and the trees whipping back and forth. To see the storm better, the hunter opened the tent flap. What he saw startled him. There wasn't a breath of air, stirring, and the trees were standing perfectly still. Yet he could hear the wind howling. And the more he listened, the more it sounded as if it were calling DéFago's name.

""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!"" it called. ""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!"" ""I must be losing my mind,"" the hunter thought. But DéFago had gotten out of his sleeping bag. He was huddled in a corner of the tent, his head buried in his arms. ""What's this all about?"" the hunter asked. ""It's nothing,"" DéFago said. But the wind continued to call to him. And DéFago became more tense and more restless. ""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!"" it called. ""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!""

Suddenly, he jumped to his feet, and he began to run from the tent. But the hunter grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground. ""You can't leave me out here,"" the hunter shouted. Then the wind called again, and DéFago broke loose and ran into the darkness. The hunter could hear him screaming as he went. Again and again he cried, ""oh, my fiery feet, my burning feet of fire..."" Then his voice faded away, and the wind died down.

At daybreak, the hunter followed DéFago's tracks in the snow. They went through the woods, down toward the lake, then out onto the ice. But soon he noticed something strange. The steps DéFago had taken got longer and longer. They were so long no human being could have taken them. It was as if something had helped him to hurry away.

The hunter followed the tracks out to the middle of the lake, but there they disappeared. At first, he thought that DéFago had fallen through the ice, but there wasn't any hole. Then he thought that something had pulled him off the ice into the sky. But that made no sense. As he stood wondering what had happened, the wind picked up again. Soon it was howling as it had the night before. Then he heard DéFago's voice. It was coming from up above, and again he heard DéFago screaming, ""...My fiery feet, my burning feet..."" But there was nothing to be seen. Now the hunter wanted to leave that place as fast as he could. He went back to camp and packed. Then he left some food for DéFago, and he started out. Weeks later, he reached civilization. The following year he went back to hunt in that area again. He went to the same trading post to look for a guide. The people there could not explain what had happened to DéFago that night. But they had not seen him since then.

""Maybe it was the Wendigo,"" one of them said, and he laughed. ""It's supposed to come with the wind. It drags you along at great speed until your feet are burned away, and more of you than that. Then it carries you into the sky, and it drops you. It's just a crazy story, but that's what some of the Indians say.""

A few days later, the hunter was at the trading post again. An Indian came in and sat by the fire. He had a blanket wrapped around him, and he wore his hat so that you couldn't see his face. The hunter thought there was something familiar about him. He walked over and he asked, ""Are you DéFago?"" The Indian didn't answer. ""Do you know anything about him?"" No answer. He began to wonder if something was wrong, if the man needed help. But he couldn't see his face. ""Are you all right?"" he asked. No answer.

To get a look at him, he lifted the Indian's hat. Then he screamed. There was nothing under the hat but a pile of ashes.",1680555110,1680555191,False,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Nordamerika. In den Wäldern gibt es ein Wesen, von dem schon die Ureinwohner in ihrer Anishina-Kultur berichtet haben. Ein menschenähnliches Monster, das jeden in den Wahnsinn treibt. Der Wendigo.

Wir erwachen in einem Waldgebiet, in dem alte Bauwerke wie ein Brunnen oder ein Tempel zu finden sind und müssen insgesamt 9 Totems finden, um dem Wendigo zu entkommen, der uns die ganze Zeit verfolgt und den wir nicht anschauen sollten, denn sonst werden wir wahnsinnig. 

Klingt bekannt? Ist es auch. Das Game ist nichts anderes als ein Slender-Klon, zwar mit schicker Grafik und gutem Sound, aber es ist nichts anderes als ein Slender-Klon. Auch wenn es Variationen zum Original gibt wie etwa das Ankh, das wir stets in unserer rechten Hand halten und mit dem wir angeblich die Umgebung scannen können, was sich aber als reichlich sinnlos erweist. Weshalb nun bei einer nordamerikanischen Urkultur ein ägyptisches Ankh funktioniert, frag ich besser erst gar nicht.

Die Atmosphäre scheint zunächst richtig gut zu sein, der Dschungel ist dicht, die Geräusche einschüchternd. Sehr schnell merkt man aber wie langweilig das Spiel im Kern doch ist, ja es schafft es sogar weitaus unspannender zu sein als das Vorbild Slender. Das wahrscheinlich, weil es eine Atmosphäre behauptet, die es in der Spielmechanik hinten und vorne nicht erfüllen kann.

There are 2 ""mechanics"". first one is to keep your light off which doesn't help you in any way, second one is to stay down to not get noticed by the wendigo, who turns up every 5 secs or so, basically you have to play the entire game in crouch mode which is extremely slow and annoying.

At first I was curious about the belt under me, but that became clear when I found the flashlight. The map is quite big and has some nice locations. It does becomes very fast dark, but then the fun really starts. The goal is to find totems and putting them on fire while there is this ""Eye of Sauron"" occasionally searching for you and the typical jump scares in the proces. The sounds of certain things are a bit too loud and less scary, I would advice to use something else for the searching sound.
You got this artifact in your hand with a floating item inside, it points you towards the totems. Sometimes confusing when you are near two totems, the item is then kinda showing you into circles but you will find them eventually in the darkness. The flashlight (if you found it) is a HUGE help during the searching.

This game made me jump a few times and it's eerie and challenging. I love it and I won't stop playing it untill I finished this game. (So I might still playing this game when I am in a retirements home) xD

[i]Желтоглазый демон, или Жги, молись, беги[/i]

Леса Северной Америки хранят в себе множество тайн. Одна из таких - таинственное создание вендиго, питающееся живой плотью и, согласно поверьям, вечно ощущающее неутолимый голод. Как героя игры Seeking Evil: The Wendigo вообще занесло в североамериканскую глухомань, история, однако, умалчивает. Четко ясна лишь задача - сжечь 9 тотемов, чтобы снять проклятие вендиго и как бы между делом положить конец тирании монстра. В непростом деле борьбы с лесным чудищем нам поможет зажигалка с бесконечным запасом бензина, факелы и еще фонарик впридачу. На кой в игре столько источников света, учитывая, что свет привлекает монстра - вопрос, конечно, хороший. Помимо вышеперечисленной дребедени, у игрока в распоряжении есть по-настоящему толковый предмет - древняя реликвия анк, которая способна сканировать окрестности и подобно компасу указывать нам на ближайшие тотемы. Архиполезная вещь, которая заметно облегчает поиск тотемов. 

Местность, скорее напоминающая охотничьи угодья для страшилища, создана неплохо и довольно атмосферна, но с фантазией у автора все равно туговато - есть большое страшное дерево, есть какое-то заброшенное поселение местных аборигенов, речка с ужасными текстурами воды, больше смахивающей на гудрон, церемониальное строение, где вы начинаете игру, и гордость автора - каменная пирамида, где находится сердце вендиго. 

По задумке разработчика, нам надо, прячась за деревьями и кустами, играть в кошки-мышки с плотоядной тварью, шарящей по окрестностям. На деле четкий алгоритм взаимодействия с чудищем остался для меня загадкой. Поведение ИИ плохо поддается логике - то зверь носится по лесу как ошалелый, то может оказаться стоящим как столб за ближайшем деревом, то может просто материализоваться в паре десятков метров от вас и начать светить своими ярко-желтыми глазищами-блюдцами. Ясно одно - попадаться ему на глаза в такие моменты себе дороже. Но даже если вы проявили невнимательность и тварь вас-таки заметила, то и здесь возможен разный исход - монстр может убежать от вас (!), может исчезнуть, а может и погнаться за вами вдогонку. Последний вариант развития событий наиболее опасен - если чудовище вас настигнет, игра заканчивается.

Если все же придется давать деру, то следует помнить, что в игре реализовано два типа быстрого перемещения - бег и спринт. Бег активируется зажатием Shift. Чтобы перейти от бега к спринту, нужно, помимо удерживания Shift, быстро нажимать клавишу F - герой начнет ускоряться пока не наберет максимальную скорость. Стоит сказать, носится персонаж довольно быстро. Более того, не выдыхается через 5 секунд, так что можно преодолеть вполне солидную дистанцию.

Игра была бы относительно нетрудной, если бы не непредсказуемость монстра, которого то не видно, то тот выскакивает из первого подвернувшегося куста с диким ревом, разрывающего динамики звуком с чудовищным перегрузом. Любимым трюком монстра, впрочем, является появиться в метре за вашей спиной и тут же исчезнуть, оставив вам в наследство пару седых волос. Опасности данная сцена для игрока не несет никакой, чудовище в такой момент вас даже не атакует, просто появляется и растворяется в воздухе, но на месте вы подпрыгните точно. На таких дешевых уловках и выстроен весь хоррор.

Проблема в том, что в своем текущем виде пройти игру чудовищно сложно, если только не прибегать к различным хитростям и уловкам. По мере сжигания тотемов скорость бега вендиго возрастает. То есть если вы сожгли всего 1-2 тотема, то убежать от монстра не так уж трудно. Но если 6 или 7 деревянных истуканов превратились в пепел, то тварь будет носиться как полоумная и убежать от нее вы не сможете. Вообще. Единственным способом пройти игру является задействовать незадокументированную (хотя и логичную) возможность - [spoiler]залезть на дерево[/spoiler]. Реализовано это чудовищно криво, так что это определенно баг. Но пройти игру иным способом практически невозможно. 

Пауза в игре носит чисто формальный характер - игра продолжает идти, так что монстр может сцапать вас даже при активированной паузе.

После окончания забега ведется подсчет очков. За каждое действие присуждаются баллы: убежал от монстра - 600 очков, пережил глупый скример - 100, сжег тотем - 150. Видно, что планируется реализация полноценной системы списка лидеров, но пока об этом напоминает только надпись Global Rank 20, которая не говорит вообще ни о чем, для чего она болтается в главном меню - неясно.

It's not even worth the sale price at $7. Harsh but true. I thought that for this price they would be adding a LOT more to the game rather than mostly leaving it 'as is' with a few minor bug fixes. Everything feels clumsy and lazy.

Ugh. I purchased this game while it was in early access to check it out and support the devs. It seemed like it had potential then, albeit clunky as hell. Little did I know, I would be getting basically the same thing upon release.

This game is aggravating. I played the non-VR version and it seemed like it was only meant to be played with a VR headset because you have to constantly look down at your belt to clumsily try to fumble for items. 

Both walking and running feel really slow for me and the ankh mechanic didn't ever seem to work properly at all. Ever.

Here is what my gameplay was like:

>Start a new game
>Clumsily make my way out of a cave/ruined building
>Look right, look left. See nothing but woods and a handful of torches in the distance. The artwork seems neat enough.
>Find a flashlight, spend a few minutes clumsily fumbling with the belt mechanic(this is so frustrating) to get the right items in my hands. 
>After a few moments exploring and trying to use the ankh, the sun goes away.
>Several minutes of wandering in the dark woods while spamming the ankh finally gets a faint purple highlight. 
>I wander over and wave the lighter around in front of this thing I assume I am supposed to burn. It burns.
>Weird red light shows up with an annoying sound. There is nothing scary about any of this. It's just loud. 
>Wendigo spawns literally right on top of me and I run away, spamming the ankh to find another totem thing.
>The red light and annoying sound never go away. I hear chase music and I'm told to sprint but see nothing.
>After 20 minutes of running around the woods spamming the ankh and being forced to deal with that red light and awful noise, I was unable to find a second totem. 
>The wendigo spawns on top of me again and kills me. 
>At this point, I really don't want to spend that long running around in the woods with that awful sound and mechanics that don't seem to work properly at all. I give up.

There was nothing scary about this game. I really expected so much more for a $10 price tag and I really have no idea why there are any good reviews at all. 

Sometimes I'll give a no recommendation and say to buy a game on sale. I wouldn't even go that far with this title, so I'm just going to give a firm 'Do not buy'. Not even on sale. How incredibly disappointing.",1505218214,1505218214,False,22,0,0.64546358585357666,0,True,False,False,False,,1505225357.0,"Hi fragkitten,

The ankh should work properly (unless you've ran into a bug), the totems light up upon use when you're in a certain range. The floating cube in the inner core works like a compass and points in the direction of a totem.

When it comes to the red light; this appears because you're not staying low profile and normally it goes away after you hide for a while. If you don't do this, the wendigo will eventually get you. 

We did our best to make the game as scary as possible by working on the graphics, audio and the wendigo behavior, sadly it doesn't scare everyone and we're sorry to hear that the game didn't match up to your expectations. 


Cheers!

The dev needs to fix a few things, but in the meantime I think its worth it, just bump down your ss settings a bit 


Playing on the vive, 1080, 16 GB RAM, i7-6700. Running feels satisfying, the forest feels spooky and dangerous, there's mystery to how the monster works and the way the night progresses as you find the totems builds tension. 

Things that need fixing though: there is a white line or flash when I scan my head horizontally - its not game-breaking but it's annoying and immersion breaking. There's an occasional tree that floats with no base, and the game seems way more performance heavy than it should be. Biggest issue is that the trackpad is way too sensitive, it makes sneaking really difficult, if the sensitivity setting in the menu is meant to address this it should be more clearly labelled, and the default should be much less touchy. An ss setting that overrides steam VR's would be nice as well to let players more easily adapt for performance. But otherwise its a good game, and the slightly different take on trackpad locomotion works once you get the hang of it, but again its too sensitive. I'll try later with the ""sensitivity"" in the settings to see if it fixes that which if it does, can't stress enough how the default setting should be way lower.

But yeah, for about 10 bucks this is worth picking up, my playtime's only 0.7 at time of writing but I think it'll slowly grow


Update - turns out sensitivity setting doesn't change anything for trackpad loco on vive (not sure about other platforms).

I'm into horror games, and there is something legitimately unique here. I've played a lot that involve a chase, Amnesia, Outlast, Alien Isolation. There's something extra in Seeking Evil: The Wendigo.

Despite being Early Access I think it's pretty much done. There's just a few things that might not have the required level of polish.

The Good:
VR is implemented with no grief.
Looks great in VR.
Seriously the visuals are amazing, it's appropriately very dark, but the way things sillouette is bordering on genius at times.
Feels like you're being hunted.
Lots of visual and auditory extras to keep you focused.
AI isn't easy to figure out, which is important in a game like this.
Unique mechanic in the Ankh (it's a fancy compass...)
Well priced.

The Bad:
No smooth turning.
Minimal options.
The mechanics of burning totems feels a bit minimal.
Lack of collision on some walls/trees.
Occasional draw distance issues.
For non-VR the value drops a bit, it's still reasonable but it's a bit more average by comparison.

The devs have done an awesome job on the visuals and sound to make this a terrifyingly scary game. 
The gameplay is in simplicity just slowly walking around in a dark forest tryeing to find and burn the totems, but things gets more and more interesting as you progress by burning those totems. Since the visual effects changes into a more darker tone. 
I managed on my first playthrough to burn ~4 totems, but i failed as the stress took over and i began running around to be done quicker. Not a good idea. As i had not met the Wendigo during the time i walked, but when i began being careless he was around every corner. 

All in all it's a great game even during early access that has a good amount of content for it's price point. That is of course if you dare playing it until you  can beat it ;)!
9.5/10 - Just need a laser pointer for the menu!

As other reviewers have stated...it's very dark. I tried ramping up the gamma only to find graphical issues thoughout especially to the canyon wallls.

There does not seem to a logical method of finding the totems. The Ankh seems only to provide a pulse of light rather than assist finding totems. Once found the buring animation is brief and unconvincing.

Sound is well done and is suitably eerie especially when the Wendigo is looking towards you.

At one point the Wedigo stood next to me for a few seconds then disappeared. This was either a close call or something didn't go as planned.

Flys on the headset were a nice touch and were realistic enough for me to try and swat then away. The waterfall is well animated athough I walked on top of the stream rather than in it (and no sound effects either).

Movement uses the trackpad and depends on where you are looking so that you cannot free look around whilst moving.

*Sigh* I wish Steam would allow a little more leeway in it's review options. Saying that I don't recommend Seeking Evil makes it sound like it is a bad game, when really it isn't. I'm just not sure at this stage it justifies the 10$ price tag.

Graphically the game is legit. I was really surprised at how good and smooth it ran. No issues, bugs, or glitches that I notcied in my hour play through. 

The sound is also really well done. The rustle of the grass as you move through it, your character's labored breathing as he sprints haphazardly through the forrest, the death screetch of the approaching Wendigo, all of it is top notch.

AAA game quality in graphics and sound; so what's not to like? First off the item interface is super clunky. It get's annoying having to crouch down and zoom in to select what you are trying to pick up. The gameplay is intense when the action is happening...which is unfortunately in my experience, like 10 % of the time. The majority of my playthough was just spent running around aimlessly through the forrest, trying to 'ping' the locations of the totems, and dodging the Wendigo's ""Sauron's Eye"" mechanic. The suspense wore away quickly, and it got failry repitive after awhile.

I will admit that the game does have its moments, on the Ohh shit scale. I nearly jumped out of my chair during one certain interaction. The atmosphere is good while it holds you in suspense, for me it just wore off really quickly due to all the time spent aimlessly wandering around. 10$ is cheap in AAA game world, but for indie game world, that is middle of the road in cost. You'll have to decide for yourself if there is enough here to hold your interest to pay that price.  

I included a short gameplay video so you can see if you are curious as to the mechanics and how the game functions.

I really love this game so far and I can't wait to see how it gets better. Its very atmospheric, scary and decently challenging. Of course I'm new to the game so as time progresses I'm sure it will become easier, but for my first foray into this I absolutely loved it. Has great potential.

If you are fan of Finding Bigfoot or anything similar then this is the game for you.

Others have complained the game is dark and murky. Maybe its just my monitor, but I find with the glow of the moon it seems very bright/beautiful at night. I'm comparing this to most games where its just darkness and you can't see anything. This is nothing like that. I think it mostly has to do with people playing in VR.

The ankh shows you exactly where the totems are. The floating ball in the middle of the ankh goes either left or right depending on where you are facing. Just even it out and go straight. It will lead you directly to them.

I've not encountered any bugs or weirdness so far. I read a review about controls sucking using VR so beware of that.

Ein gutes Horror-Spiel für VR! 
Ohne VR wäre es mir glaube ich zu langweilig, da kommt das Paranoia-Feeling nicht richtig auf.
Mit einer VR-Brille kann auch hinter dir jemand stehen und dieses Gefühl hat man beim Spiel permanent!
Die Grafik ist gut gelungen, auch die Soundkulisse und die Steuerung.
Den Sensor habe ich nicht kapiert, er hat mir nichts gebracht, außer Augen- und Kopfschmerzen, denn er verzerrt das Bild für einige Sekunden. Ein Totem habe ich damit nicht gefunden. Insgesamt habe ich sowieso nur eins gefunden und das auch nicht mit dem Scanner, sondern per Zufall.
Insgesamt kann ich das Spiel definitiv empfehlen, allerdings wie gesagt nur für VR!

After that, it seemed pretty straightforward.  Search the map for the 9 totems while avoiding the Windigo.  Once you burn all 9 totems, you must locate and burn the heart of the Windigo.  After that I have no clue.  The difficulty scales up each time you burn a totem, and I'm just too scrubby to actually find all of them.

All in all, the map seems well made, the graphics are pretty high quality, and the controls are fairly nice once you figure them out.  Additionally, the vibe you get from everything adds up and makes a very horrifying experience.  Dead people and animals everywhere, trapped in a dark, wet, foggy valley.  They even added small touches like bugs crawling on your face when you walk through a cloud of bugs.  I'd recommend the game to all my friends who play VR horror games, for sure.

My only complaint with the game is that it is extremely dark, and I found navigation very difficult.  In addition, the totems you have to burn are not really in intuitive locations.  Though they are near them, so I suppose you're just supposed to search a bit harder.",1493245916,1493251832,True,38,3,0.730495870113372803,2,True,False,True,False,,,
