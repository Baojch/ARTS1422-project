It has plenty of oddball humor and craziness as you attempt to find Justice and learn what has happened.  The fighting mechanics and abilities are inventive and keep the game from becoming just a slog of a typical  RPG grind. Unless you play in hard mode.  Hard mode is... a grindfest extraordinaire.  I would suggest sticking with Normal or Easy, as it has no bearing on the story.  

Instead of typical enemies found in these style of games they are uniquely designed and use non stock art, which is a relief from so many RPGmaker games simply using base assets. Because the enemies aren't your typical RPG fare, you have to experiment as the usual kill x by using x doesn't apply, leading to less boring fights as you learn the game.   The stamina system is a nice system as well, I've not seen it used this way in very many games.  

The map is fun to explore and the art used different from anything else I've seen.  I never felt like I got too lost, nor did I feel it was far too big.

All in all it's well put together and well worth what is being asked for.  Well worth playing.  

As for why I have so little time in the steam version, I bought and originally finished the game on itchio.  

The only real con I have is that because it's RPGMaker and low budget,  the art though unique when not stock doesn't overcome the 'RPGmaker' feel.  Yet there is still enough changed in the game that it certainly isn't cookie cutter either.

The fights are quite engaging, even though the fighting-system is a bit hard to understand at first, but what's really interesting about this game is the story, which is quite enjoyable and how the world seems alive, even though there isn't much visual input in this direction.

So I'd definetely recommend this to anyone out there who is willing to overlook the poor visuals of a game and is on the search for a retro-indie experience.",1461171514,1461171514,True,1,0,0.383639484643936157,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I have not yet beaten the game. I'll try to give an honest mostly non-biased review. Since I have a preference and style of games I like (as I assume everyone does), I will try to push that aside for this review.

It should be noted that this game wasn't delvoped by a team or company, it was made by one man over the course of a few years. That alone should count for something. But I digress...

To start, lets talk about the obvious. Yes it looks like crap. The graphics are pretty barren and old. It really does leave much to be desired. But if you judge a game solely on it's looks then you'll miss out on a hell of a lot of treasures! The game shouldn't be played for looks alone.. or at all. The game should be played for the story, much like any RPG.

The story is good, it's not amazing but it's not trash either. It has a unique perspective and moves at a reasonable pace. There are a few times where I personally felt the story was dragging a bit, but I think the plot unfolds well enough and the over all arch of the story suits the game.

The characters are unique and indepth. They all have their own personal back stories that helps to understand their motivation and personalities. There is enough substance to the characters that you can either relate with or against them. I have a few favorites when I play, and the nice thing about the game is that I could play with all of my favorite characters in one party. (I don't because most of my favorites are support characters... but I could!)

The system is interesting... Its out of the norm and that adds to the game play, but I personally feel it was a bit hard to understand and I struggled to pick it up quickly. It took me a while to understand how to do a lot of things in and out of combat, but I also played the majority of the game in beta before there was a tutorial... It's probably much easier to grasp now that there is a tutorial to break it down for you.

The level of difficulty in the game is pretty rough, I tend to be more of a casual gamer, and I find myself struggling a lot to finish this game. I die constantly and get frustrated when things need to be repeated because I failed at them, or when I have to back track to grind levels out to defeat a boss or quest mob. But a lot of RPGs are grindy, and this one is no exception.

So to recap:

Cons:
It is not visually appealing
The unique system can be hard to pick up and learn quickly
It's really hard and requires a lot of grinding (that's what she said?)
Some of the story elements felt drawn out or forced

Pros:
The story draws you in
It has interesting and fun characters
It doesn't have a typical battle system
You get a sense of nostalga from playing it

Overall opinion, I'd recommend this game ONLY to people who really enjoy RPGs and don't mind being ported back to the NES era of gaming. This game isn't for everyone.",1457125226,1457125226,True,11,2,0.49453967809677124,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Since two particlular people decided to be angry at my generic review I posted I decided to edit this.

I beta tested this game starting over a year ago, so I don't have a lot of game time on Steam because I have restarted and played this game multiple times as did several other people.

I enjoyed this game for what it is. It doesn't have a lot, but it's a 5$ game. If you do all of the side missions and grind like you are suppose to, then you can get a good amount of hours into the game. 

The graphics arent the best from what you can see in the screenshots, but if you look past it I can recommend this game. If you like the retro style RPG type of games then I think you will have fun. The characters I feel are likeable and it has it's silly moments so you get the occasional laugh here and there. The combat gets your gear turning meaning you can't just spam attack every battle. If you do that then it will get you killed. You have a good selection of different characters so you can make some pretty interesting combos if you plan it out right. 

If you can't get past the graphics, don't buy it. If you can, then I would recommend this nice little game to people.",1457051255,1457136510,True,7,0,0.345156937837600708,28,False,False,False,False,,,
