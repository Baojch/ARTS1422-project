A differenza del primo, dove si potevano raccogliere dei francobolli che attivavano particolari abilit√†, qui ci sono delle carte (usabili in battaglia) che conferiscono abilit√† e bonus. In pratica a livello di gameplay il gioco √® pi√π rifinito (e meno facile anche se non ho mai visto un game over) ma meno divertente del primo (che era una novit√†), il classico more of the same senza infamia e senza lode.

PREGI:

Costumi simpatici che attivano abilit√† uniche
Missioni secondarie che spesso richiedono l'uso di uno specifico costume
Diversi costumi sono opzionali e vanno scovati all'interno degli stage.


DIFETTI:

I combattimenti sono sempre facili, hanno solo aumentato i danni fatti dai nemici (√® praticamente impossibile morire)
Alcuni livelli sono noiosi 
Per via della storia, l'atmosfera di Halloween √® meno presente
I combattimenti richiedono solo la pressione di un tasto al momento giusto (per fare pi√π danni e per pararsi), ci si stufa presto di questa mancanza di profondit√†.

VOTO: 7

Costume Quest 2 √® il seguito diretto del primo capitolo, migliora alcuni aspetti ma nel contempo ne peggiora altri (l'atmosfera del primo era decisamente migliore e poi il gameplay era una novit√†).
Consigliato solo a che ha giocato il primo capitolo (che reputo migliore).

Executive: Alright, so what have you got for me today?

Creator: Okay, picture this: it's Costume Quest 2!

Executive: Ah, the sequel. People love sequels. What's the scoop this time?

Creator: Well, we've got the same kids in costumes, right? But get this, they're time-traveling this time!

Executive: Time travel, nice. So, where do they go?

Creator: Everywhere! Ancient Egypt, the pirate age, and even the future!

Executive: Ah, expanding the universe, I like it. Any new characters?

Creator: Absolutely. How about a villain who's a... wait for it... dentist?

Executive: A dentist?

Creator: Yeah, they're terrified of the guy. He's got a whole army of toothbrush-wielding minions.

Executive: Toothbrushes as weapons, that's a twist. What about the costumes?

Creator: Oh, they're wild. You can be a unicorn, a french fry, even a pterodactyl.

Executive: I can already see the merchandise. But can you top the first game's cardboard box hero?

Creator: You bet. We're bringing back the cardboard box and giving it even more ridiculous powers.

Executive: Love it. What's the message here?

Creator: Well, it's all about the power of friendship and teamwork, you know, the usual. But with a lot of candy.

Executive: Candy always sells. And the humor?

Creator: Puns, dad jokes, and some adult humor slipped in for the parents.

Executive: Perfect. This sounds like a deliciously spooky adventure. You've got the green light!

Creator: Awesome! I'll get back to work on those dental villain puns. Thanks!

Executive: No problem. And remember, it's all about the teeth-chattering fun! [/i]

It definitely was the right choice, as the feedback from other reviewers was correct. The game is 90% the same. The major differences include needing to refill your health between battles, a few extra combo/counter moves in combat, and the replacement of stamp abilities with card abilities with cooldowns. 

The refilling of health would be a good touch, if there weren't constant health fountains in every single area making the fear of death pointless. The additional combo mechanics were a welcome addition. Card abilities seemed to get some negative feedback, but honestly, I didn't mind the system all that much. The new costumes don't quite have the same charm as the first game, but they are still pretty good. It's a shame the costumes from the first game couldn't also carry over to this one for one big costume frenzy.

The game is incredibly easy, I didn't lose a single battle in my initial run. I was about half-way through the run though when I realised I had accidentally blocked myself off from an achievement. If you want to get 100% in a single run, there is only one thing that you can accidentally be blocked from doing. One achievement demands you complete every single battle with the candy corn costume in your party. So I completed my initial run, and then had to redo the entire game with the candy corn in my party. While definitely more challenging, as you're basically handicapped the entire game, I still only lost 4 battles, and I ended up beating the game a second time around in about 3.5 hours, and at about level 7 in combat strength. So if you bother to farm enemies more, the game would be easy to run deathless, even with the handicap.

Play Costume Quest 1 before buying this game as the stories are linked, but honestly the story in this game isn't special enough to say it's a must play as the first game has enough closure already. I'd say I enjoyed the first game more than this one, but this was still a fun little distraction from better steam games.

Music is great, nothing to write home about.

Gameplay has slightly more depth, but is still terribly long and drawn-out. You now have options for more combos and a small risk-reward blocking system, but it all ultimately ends up taking way more time than you'd ever want (per battle too). If you just came from the first game and just want more story and less of the pointlessly-long combat, hack yourself to a 1xp away from level 13 and enjoy the game at a better pace.

I know this game is made for kids, so if you're reading this you're probably not a kid (and probably have more value for your time). If you played the last game and wanted more of that Double-Fine humor and story beat, this game is a great continuation. Otherwise this might turn away people who strongly dislike turn-based combat that take *way* too long to finish.

For those who care to know, I played this from start to finish on a Steam Deck. The game runs flawlessly, with the minor gripes being as follows:

- Waking from sleep will sometimes just break controller inputs (binding some keyboard inputs to a few buttons can help you get to a save point)
- Occasionally, waking from sleep will just outright crash the deck into a restart
- Most in-game menus (the first save slot selection, the inventory, Shady's Shop) seem to have a bug where it will always repeatedly be pressing a button. Most of the time it's B, other times it's A. I'm not sure how to fix this other than spamming the button that's bugging the moment the menu opens so it will ""cancel out"".
- Unrelated to the Deck itself, but this game does NOT support cross-platform saves, even if you try to copy the save file from the deck to a Linux distro to hopefully continue your game on. 

Besides these issues, the game runs great. No visual bugs, no weird audio glitching, all the way from start to finish.",1686799790,1686800710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

In short: 5.5/10. The gameplay is similar to Costume Quest, but the new combat system was awful and borderline annoying. The story is okay but nothing special. Frame drops and technical issues may occur. They didn‚Äôt do anything better except for one or two small things. I loved the first title, so I am a bit disappointed.  
 
[h1] DETAILS [/h1]

(+) The gameplay (outside combat) will be the same: You walk around in adorable new costumes, hit things on your way with your bag to obtain candy, and do quests. You can buy a [b] map for each area [/b] with candy now, which conveniently tells you if you found all chests and costume parts. I found the maps mostly confusing, though (since they look like a kid‚Äôs drawing, and you still have to find your location). My biggest plus is that you can [b] roller skate with every costume to speed walk. [/b]

(+/-) Okayish storyline: An evil dentist wants to destroy Halloween? Not very groundbreaking. Nevertheless, one part of the story got me and improved my opinion.  

(-) Your health bar won‚Äôt heal after each fight anymore: You need to find a fountain (or eat candy) instead, resulting in more unnecessary walking. 

(-) [b] The new battle system made me dislike fighting: [/b] In the first game, you could easily equip ‚Äúbattle stamps‚Äù for specific combat advantages. Now they made a [b] card game [/b] out of it where you first have to select three (chaotically displayed) cards before combat, THEN select one of them during the fight and lose an entire move. You also have to consider their cool-down! Overall, it‚Äôs much more clicking and thinking if the card is worth it. Before, you also had to concentrate a little during the fights to click the correct button (E, Q, Space, or Shift) at the right time to fight/parry. Now you always press the same button (either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the character) and move with A and D to select a specific attack, card, or even run away. As I said: much clicking. [b] Frame drops made it almost impossible to get the timing right, [/b] resulting in less overall damage and longer fights ‚Äì even longer than with the changes they made. Not sure if it was because of all the said above, but the [b] combat music annoyed me. [/b]

(-) One of the worst letdowns was the overall look of the costumes in combat, which was the heart of the game for me. While I found them creative and badass in the first game, they now look 3D-ish and out of place. 
 
(-) More technical issues: My game crashed once and deleted part of my progress. One of my team members decided to randomly leave my group and run into a wall for a couple of seconds, too. Quests containing music acts were tonally out of place (= no sound while playing), thus making them feel unauthentic. 

(-) Even though I enjoyed the first area (and one near the end), everything was too dystopian and/or depressing for me. I get we needed to save Halloween, but still. (This comes from someone who loves cyberpunk vibes).",1682861474,1682864293,False,7,1,0.59239572286605835,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Si bien la modalidad de golpear puertas para obtener caramelos puede resultar mon√≥tona a ratos, el juego avanza r√°pido y lo compensa con una serie de misiones secundarias. Por otra parte, aspectos de la jugabilidad mejoran en este t√≠tulo en contraste con su entrega anterior, por ejemplo, respecto al desplazamiento r√°pido y al sistema de combate. Adem√°s algunas habilidades de disfraces del primer juego se reciclan inteligentemente en nuevos trajes. 
En mi opini√≥n, lo mejor de Costume Quest es que es un juego que te permite de alg√∫n modo revivir la infancia y lanzarte a la aventura y explorar el mundo bajo la perspectiva de un ni√±o -con humor y cierta simplicidad de por medio- precisamente porque los adultos de este mundo no son capaces de percibir la amenaza o bien √©stos llevaron al mundo a un desequilibrio o distop√≠a. En este sentido, Costume Quest 2 sigue prometiendo este prisma y esta singular experiencia de juego.

First of all, I'm not a fan of the card option and can see why they added it as the first one had the cards purely for cosmetic and collectible reasons. I'm 2 hours into the game and haven't found the battle stamps, which is a little frustrating as that made the game a bit more enjoyable as you can equip and unequip them based on your liking.

I played the first Costume Quest on M&K but feel very forced to play this one on controller due to the new combat system. The beginning of the game is rather slow as you start off with a candy corn costume which doesn't do anything and is just purely a meat shield.. on top of that the candy corn commentary was funny at first but becomes repetitive and is unskippable.

Art: Better than the original, but still in the same style. Honestly, it holds up excellently compared to any modern game, because it pulls off its style perfectly. Very good!
Writing: Great! I deliberately tried to find every line of dialog, it is that good.
Audio/Music: There's more music this time (compared to Costume Quest 1), and the music is great!
Gameplay: Yes, it's simple. yes, it's (slightly) different from the original Costume Quest. But that's all fine. I didn't play this game seeking an intense, brain-wracking, RPG grindfest. There's enough mechanics here to put it a step above brain dead though, thankfully. And of course figuring out the puzzles (without hints) is rewarding.
Ending: Still trying to remember to judge games at least partly by how they handle the end of their stories. And this one is a slam dunk, no question. Just about perfect, though maybe it could be slightly improved (but I can't suggest how here because that would be spoilers), but what can't? Miles better than most endings to games, that's for absolutely certain.

In conclusion: Play this game. It's good, especially if your Halloweek irl was bad.

Side Note: Any game where I get to defend the honor of Candy Corn by dragging it into every single fight I get into in a game is a good one. Especially when I get to KO enemies with it. (You don't get that ability right away though. Keep playing, you'll get it eventually.)

[*]In CQ1 you press need one of a few buttons at the right moment to do full damage, failing will do reduced damage.
In CQ2 in addition to the above, with even more accuracy you can do extra damage, but instead of a few buttons you only have to press 1 2 or 3 depending on which party member is acting.

[*]In CQ1 you can pick any costume for any situation, surviving combat is dependent on using costume powers.
In CQ2, costumes have weaknesses and strengths, your party will take and deal more or less damage depending on your weaknesses and enemy type.
Defensive costume powers are also much weaker, the focus here is on offensive, for defense you have cards.

[*]In CQ1 you equip your party members with stamps to give them a passive bonus to help in combat.
In CQ2 you don't have stamps, instead you use cards for various effects once per combat, then they need to recharge afterwards by fighting a few battles.

[*]In CQ1 when you finish a battle, you lose any charge on your abilities you had and you are fully healed.
In CQ2 when you finish a battle, you keep any charge on your abilities you had and are not healed, you have to visit a fountain or eat some of your candy to heal.

[*]In CQ1 you had to switch to the robot costume to move faster out of combat.
In CQ2 you have the robot's skates by default.[/list]

and some half-baked ones: the strength/weaknesses system, OP Creepy Treat cards, the Superhero costume model (lol), the Candy Corn costume (special ability used literally only in the final fight), older (first game) costumes locked behind a pre-order bonus (i wonder if there's not a way to get them nowadays?), needing to heal in the overworld unlike CQ1

Just press the same buttons over and over, the cards are ""fine"", but it's annoying to constantly shuffle them after each fight.

If the combat was at all engaging, it would be a good game, because everything in the presentation works, it's even endearing at times, but the combat put me to sleep. There is also some frustration with hidden objects or comfusing and overwhelming layouts at times.

En esta nueva aventura viajaremos a trav√©s del tiempo para poner fin al malvado plan del Doctor White, el dentista de nuestro barrio que tras hacerse con el poder sobre el espacio tiempo toma el control de todos los monstruos de Repugia para crear una distop√≠a futurista sin halloween ni golosinas. Nuestra misi√≥n consistir√° en viajar entre el pasado y el futuro para hacer frente a esta nueva amenaza, poner fin a los planes del Doctor White y recuperar de nuevo la normalidad.

El juego, como su antecesor, se sustenta sobre una base RPG de batalla por turnos donde nuestros h√©roes ir√°n desbloqueando diferentes disfraces que les proporcionar√°n habilidades √∫nicas para el combate as√≠ como m√∫ltiples equipamientos para potenciarlas, a su vez deberemos ir avanzando en la trama sirviendonos de estos para sortear obstaculos y resolver puzles. Por la parte gr√°fica nos encontramos con un titulo de est√©tica ""Cell-Shading"" combinada con ""Super-Deformed"" donde destaca enormemente la calidad y la simpat√≠a puesta en sus originales dise√±os que denotan gran fluidez de movimientos y calidad de modelaje que a su vez casan a la perfecci√≥n con unos amplios y coloridos escenarios ofreciendo gran nivel de detalle y sorprendiendo por sus fant√°sticos efectos de luces y sombras.  por la parte sonora la OST se presenta correcta, buenos efectos de sonido combinados con una banda sonora inmersiva y de gran calidad nos sumergen totalmente en la acci√≥n gracias a unas composiciones variadas y amenas. Finalmente en el apartado jugable encontramos unos controles sencillos e intuitivos con interacciones claras y r√°pidas que aportan mucho dinamismo a la acci√≥n as√≠ como una interfaz din√°mica con funciones acordes, aunque cabe destacar que la elecci√≥n de mando para jugarlo har√° mas c√≥modas las interacciones, sobretodo de cara a realizar los ataques sincronizados en los combates.

As√≠ pues y como nota final solo cabe remarcar el buen trabajo realizado creando una continuaci√≥n directa de un peque√±o titulo que nos brind√≥ un toque diferente y divertido al ya encasillado mundo del RPG de batalla por turnos y que nuevamente nos ofrece una entra√±able y divertida historia que, a√∫n sin grandes pretensiones se hace eco de su antecesor ofreciendo una grata y desternillante historia que encantar√° a los amantes del g√©nero y que adem√°s podemos adquirir en pack junto con su pimera parte a un precio bastante razonable. Bastante recomendable.

I played the first Costume Quest and really loved how it captured the pure whimsy of Halloween and trick-or-treating. Not only did it look cute and have the right Halloween atmosphere, but it was also a simple yet fun game.

Costume Quest 2 is very much the same basic formula, with plenty of humour and silliness throughout. Unfortunately, it's just not as fun. Combat is somehow made into a total chore in this game. There is some satisfaction in figuring out the best way to use the card mechanic and special ability mechanic across battles - for example, charging up during one battle and switching your cards so you are ready for a harder battle. But it becomes very repetitive, and I resent that I actually had to grind battles at the end just to get to the top level and get all the candy I needed to buy everything.

I really struggled to get into the game, trying multiple times to start but always groaning about playing it. Eventually I got a full hour into the game and started to enjoy it more. But after a while, the last few hours started to feel like a chore again. I found myself finishing it just to finish it.

Also, in traditional Double Fine fashion, most things about the game are either painfully easy or obtusely difficult to figure out. Most of the quests and challenges are really just a matter of putting around the map and slogging through the turn-based battles. I don't mind this a lot of the time, since I do enjoy wandering around the environment looking for stuff. And sometimes the dialogue and quests could be very funny. But at the end of the day, you really are just running back and forth without much challenge. Once in a while, a certain battle will be strangely difficult, even though the final boss battle of the game is actually very easy. More frustratingly, though, there are times where I found myself running around because it wasn't exactly clear what I was supposed to do next, and the answer was so specific that I either had to stumble upon it or look up a hint. One time there was actually NO way for me to get through without looking it up because the visual cue I needed to see was hidden from sight. Did they not catch that in play testing? This really took me out of the flow and the atmosphere of the game. I probably would have enjoyed it more if this hadn't happened a few times, cause that's when it started to feel like a chore.

And while I do enjoy the imaginative environments, it was a bit sad that the classic Costume Quest Halloween vibe was only present in certain areas, while a lot of areas were cold and bland because they took place in a dystopian future. It was interesting to explore the first time, but got real old when I was milling around figuring out what I had missed.

It seems like there are certain flaws that Double Fine repeats in all their games, and those flaws made this game less enjoyable than it could have been. It felt slightly unfinished, as if they had reached a certain point and given up on trying to fix the last few things that prevented it from being super fun. All that said, it's not a bad game and it's totally worth playing if you want a cute and fun Halloween-y game to play. If you haven't played the first one, though, that is an even better option.",1637572641,1637573031,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is not a bad game, but it‚Äôs not as good as its predecessor for a few reasons. If you look at the review page for the first game, you‚Äôll see many players praising the nostalgic feel and charming design, calling it a game to play every Halloween. Sadly, this is entirely absent for most of 2. Instead of suburban neighborhoods, malls, and fairs decorated for the season, you spend most of the game in a generic, rainy dystopian city. This is justified with the (admittedly decent) story about a time-travelling candy-hating dentist, but I would have liked to spend the game seeing the Halloween spirit come back to the drab environments.

Regarding gameplay, 2 tries to vary things up for its turn-based combat compared to the first game, but none of the changes really worked for me. Timed button presses are now used for every attack and defense action, but they are represented as a shrinking circle and much harder to get right. You no longer heal automatically after every battle, but it‚Äôs rarely more than a 10 second detour to find a healing/saving water fountain on the overworld. There is a simple damage-type system with each costume being stronger or weaker against monster, magic, or mechanical enemies, but the impact is barely noticeable with the boring but practical strategy of taking out the enemy party one at a time, regardless of their composition. 

Lastly, the stamps from the first game have been replaced by the trading cards in a system which had promise, but fell flat. You pick 3 cards from your collection to keep on hand for battle, can play them for a given effect in place of any party member‚Äôs turn, and must wait a certain number of battles before you can use it again.  Unfortunately, combat is so easy that battles rarely take more than 3 full turns for the whole party, so spending one of your actions to play a card is almost never worth your time. I wound up only using the cards that increased Candy and XP payout to reduce grinding, and still never lost a battle.

If you really enjoy Costume Quest, this might have some novelty for the new costumes, continuity nods to the first game, and a few decently funny moments, but it simply lacks the holiday charm that makes the original such a treat. Throw in a battle system that increases variety but remains as shallow as a puddle, and you‚Äôll ultimately wish you were playing the first game again.

However, this one does not offer much that is new and definitely gets repetitive before then moving the story forward.  I will say though that the game is still fun and enjoyable.

You control a group the main character Wren, Reynolds, and a third kid.  You go around trick or treating to collect candy or parts for more costumes.  Each level offers a variety of secrets where you can discover more costumes.  Each costume also has a special action it can do in the world, when not fighting.  This adds a puzzle element to the game.  When fighting you play a Final Fantasy style fighting game where you costumes become real characters to be reckoned with.  The game offers something like 12 costumes to collect.

The storyline the game follows is about your dentist stealing a talisman from the past which eventually changes the world so that Halloween is no longer celebrated and candy is illegal.  You must follow the dentist into the future and into the past to regain the talisman and make the world happy with candy again.

Overall, the game is just cute.  The graphics are cartoony, the dialogue is fun, the actions are what you would expect in a kids game.  You even have the chance to speed across the game world on your healies, shoes with wheels.  The only downfall is that it gets repetitive and it's very easy.  So in easy in fact that one of the achievements is to beat with game with the Candy Corn costume being on at all times throughout the game.  The Candy Corn costume does not fight.  This means that only 2 out of the 3 characters is fighting at all times.  That's how easy the game is.

If you played the first one, you have to play the second one.

Votre nouvelle mission : Sauver la f√™te d‚ÄôHalloween gravement menac√©e par l‚Äôaffreux docteur White..[/quote]

[i]Litt√©ralement tomb√©e sous le charme du premier opus, il me tardait de poursuivre l‚Äôaventure dans ce second volet qui ne m‚Äôa pas d√©√ßue ! Contrairement √† certaines sagas dans lesquelles les √©volutions graphiques ou de gameplay sautent aux yeux, rien n‚Äôest ici vraiment d√©paysant. Toujours aussi plaisant √† parcourir ‚ÄúCostume Quest 2‚Äú reste tr√®s similaire au premier except√© peut-√™tre au niveau des combats qui b√©n√©ficient d‚Äôune approche plus riche et plus dynamique √©vitant ainsi les petites longueurs du pr√©c√©dent volet. √Ä titre purement informatif, vous retrouverez ici, de fait, certains √©l√©ments descriptif de mon √©valuation du premier [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/app/115100/Costume_Quest/]Costume Quest[/URL] toujours d‚Äôactualit√©.[/i]

Rest√©s en suspens √† la fin du premier opus, vos petits h√©ros tout mignons doivent √† pr√©sent sauver Halloween gravement menac√© par le vilain docteur White, vouant un culte obsessionnel √† l‚Äôhygi√®ne bucco-dentaire et bien d√©cid√© √† mettre un terme √† cette f√™te traditionnelle ainsi qu‚Äô√† toutes les orgies de sucre qu‚Äôelle repr√©sente.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2305680215
Exploration, r√©colte de bonbons, confection de d√©guisements d√©lirants, qu√™tes en pagaille ou combats rigolos, on retrouve ici toutes les m√©caniques du premier opus. Toutes sauf une qui √©tait pourtant si sympathique.. le jeu des pommes ! Ni lui, ni aucun autre petit jeu. En revanche, une part plus importante est consacr√©e √† l‚Äôexploration et le nombre de lieux √† visiter est plus important, on dira qu‚Äôau final √ßa r√©√©quilibre bien les choses.

[h1]Goules sucr√©es[/h1]
Th√®me d‚ÄôHalloween oblige, la qu√™te de friandise √† s‚Äôen faire p√©ter la panse reste une priorit√© et √† l‚Äôinstar du premier opus tout est bon pour gagner des bonbecs : frapper aux portes (au risque de vous retrouvez nez √† nez avec un gros m√©chant pas beau que vous devrez affronter) ou frapper sur un peu tout ce qui vous passe sous la main, √† vous de chercher !

En plus de l‚Äôimmense satisfaction de voir votre pr√©cieux butin s‚Äô√©toffer, les friandises peuvent √† l‚Äôoccasion vous redonner de l‚Äô√©nergie (si, si !) mais elles sont surtout une pr√©cieuse monnaie d‚Äô√©change pour acheter des plans, des am√©liorations de costumes et des cartes de ¬´¬†bonbons farceurs¬†¬ª utiles lors les combats (elles remplacent les timbres de combats qui n‚Äôexistent plus dans cette suite).

[h1]Des qu√™tes, toujours des qu√™tes..[/h1]
Si vous connaissez d√©j√† le premier Costume Quest vous savez d√©j√† un peu ce qui vous attend. Pour les autres, sachez que la liste des qu√™tes secondaires qui viennent s‚Äôaccumuler au fil de l‚Äôaventure peut effrayer au d√©but, mais en pratique bon nombre d‚Äôentre elles se r√©alisent d‚Äôelles-m√™me au cours de l‚Äôaventure (les autres √©tant facultatives).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2312031795
Un petit carnet bien pratique et tenu automatiquement √† jour permet d‚Äôacc√©der rapidement √† toutes les informations dont vous avez besoin : que ce soit les qu√™tes restant √† effectuer, les costumes trouv√©s et leurs propri√©t√©s, les plans ou votre collection de cartes de bonbons farceurs.

[h1]√Ä vos aiguilles ![/h1]
Comme dans le premier opus, le plaisir de confectionner et d√©couvrir de nouveaux d√©guisements reste intact ! Plus loufoques les uns que les autres leurs diff√©rentes propri√©t√©s peuvent s‚Äôav√©rer d‚Äôune grande utilit√© lors des phases de combat. Pour obtenir une nouvelle tenue, il vous faudra commencer par en trouver le ¬´¬†patron¬†¬ª indiquant les √©l√©ments qui la composent (et que bien-s√ªr, vous allez vous employer √† chercher f√©brilement). Une fois les diff√©rentes parties r√©cup√©r√©es, la tenue se cr√©√© automatiquement et on a plus qu‚Äôune seule h√¢te : l‚Äôexp√©rimenter lors d‚Äôun combat pour la d√©couvrir en situation !

Certaines ont des propri√©t√©s plus d√©fensives / protectrices et d‚Äôautres sont plus port√©es vers l‚Äôattaque. √Ä vous de choisir celles que vous pr√©f√©rez et d‚Äô√©quiper vos personnages avec les cartes de bonbons farceurs qui vous semblent les mieux appropri√©es (soit dans le but de parer aux lacunes de telle ou telle tenue, soit inversement pour venir amplifier un pouvoir d√©j√† tr√®s fort). Dans cet opus, vous avez √©galement la possibilit√© d‚Äôacheter des am√©liorations permanentes de costumes moyennant [strike]quelques[/strike] beaucoup de friandises.

Une bonne gestion des costumes et des cartes √©quip√©es permet de vaincre tous les ennemis sans aucune difficult√©. Mes chouchous sur ce volume : Le Sorcier, le hot-dog et le clown (m√™me si la cin√©matique de son pouvoir sp√©cial de combat devient vite horriblement aga√ßante √† la longue elle reste super utile !). √Ä noter que plusieurs d√©guisements ont des propri√©t√©s tr√®s utiles durant l‚Äôaventure (m√™me hors des combats).

[h1]Les combats[/h1]
C‚Äôest probablement pour moi ce qui a √©t√© notablement am√©lior√© dans ce second volet. Sur le fond les m√©caniques restent similaires : les combats se jouent au tour par tour avec des phases de QTE durant lesquelles l‚Äôex√©cution des indications doit √™tre r√©alis√©e correctement et dans un temps imparti. Mais √† pr√©sent il ne suffit plus de cliquer ¬´¬†sur le bon bouton au bon moment¬†¬ª : l‚Äôexp√©rience s‚Äôest enrichie d‚Äôune sorte de timing de frappe qui n√©cessite de percuter ou de parer l‚Äôadversaire √† un instant pr√©cis qui apporte de l‚Äôinteractivit√© et une touche de r√©alisme tr√®s gratifiante lors de l‚Äôaction ! De plus, vous aurez plusieurs fois l‚Äôoccasion de travailler avec votre ma√Ætre d‚Äôarmes afin de perfectionner et apprendre tr√®s progressivement les techniques de combats. C‚Äôest particuli√®rement bien pens√©, rapide et intuitif.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2309929123
√Ä chaque ¬´¬†mauvaise¬†¬ª rencontre, le combat est annonc√© par une courte cin√©matique durant laquelle vous voyez votre mignon bambin se m√©tamorphoser en super combattant. La cin√©matique varie en fonction du costume que vous portez √† ce moment l√† et je vous assure que m√™me dans le costume le plus ridicule la transformation est stup√©fiante ! √Ä noter que les cin√©matiques des phases de combats dans le style Manga contrastent avec le style mignon et tr√®s enfantin du reste du jeu.

Sachez que la dur√©e de vie du jeu d√©pend beaucoup de votre fa√ßon de jouer (si vous tracez la route ou si vous avez envie de fouiner partout pour d√©crocher tous les succ√®s) je donnerai donc ici une fourchette plut√¥t large √† titre purement indicatif : comptez entre 10 et 20 heures pour boucler l‚Äôaventure.

üìé Bilan tr√®s positif pour la suite de ce petit RPG qui ne devrait pas d√©cevoir les amateurs du premier opus ! √Ä la fois dr√¥le et enfantin, ‚ÄúCostume Quest 2‚Äú peut sans aucun probl√®me √™tre conseill√© aux adultes comme aux plus jeunes.

Luckily, that goes for the sequel as well!

Costume Quest 2 is a fairly ""safe"" sequel, operating on basically the exact same formula, structure and even engine as the original game. It's definitely closer to a stand-alone expansion than a true, genre-bending reinvention of the formula. If Costume Quest was decidedly not your thing, even if it's better I still don't think Costume Quest 2 is gonna change your mind.

But if you liked the original, Costume Quest 2 is more of the same candy to gorge yourself on. That's not to say there aren't [i]any[/i] improvements‚Äîfar from it. Indeed, all of the most annoying features of the original have been fixed. There's a teeny bit more depth in the combat with a rock-paper-scissors gimmick and reusable items, and also just ""feels"" better thanks to timing window changes. The levels are a little more varied and exotic than the suburbia of the original. Best of all, the framerate is an even 60 now, making everything so much smoother. I understand why Costume Quest 1 runs at 30 FPS (timing RPGs are tricky that way) but I'm very glad a fix was a priority for the sequel because the smoother FPS makes the adorable art look so much nicer.

It's also still pretty hilarious. I know ""good writing"" is usually such a given for Double Fine it's almost not worth mentioning, but good writing is hard! The fact that it always seems so effortless is a huge compliment to the dev team.

The worst thing about Costume Quest 2 is that it feels kinda silly to play it any time other than Halloween. But it's short and sweet, and it's well worth picking both games up to dabble with between trick-or-treaters.",1603911944,1603911944,True,4,0,0.56187891960144043,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]The Good[/h1][i]Battle Cards can be used by anyone in battle.[/i]

In the first game, you could acquire stamps that when equipped, can give you another action in battle, whether it‚Äôs a special attack, healing your allies or something else. You could only equip one stamp per character, unfortunately.

In the sequel, you can collect battle cards instead of stamps, and the setup has improved for usage in battle. While you can only equip 5 cards at a time during battles, your entire team can now use the cards at anytime, instead of being limited to having each characters with one card. This makes the battles more manageable and experience less frustrations as a result.

[h1]The Bad[/h1][i]Not a fan of Candy Corn Costume‚Äôs usage.[/i]

One of the first costumes that you will have available will be the Candy Corn costume, which wasn‚Äôt used in the first game, but was worn by the kidnapped sibling. As far as what the costume is useful for... nothing, just nothing.

All of the costumes that you can acquire has their own unique abilities and the Candy Corn‚Äôs ability is simply drawing enemy attacks to it and while wearing it, you can‚Äôt attack, which puts you down one character in battles. There‚Äôs an achievement for completing the game with the costume on from start to finish, but I feel that wasn‚Äôt really necessary.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1][i]Sequel feels shorter than the first game.[/i]

It‚Äôs been a while since I last played Costume Quest 2, so when looking back at the game length, it feels roughly the same as the first game without the extra story, yet in hindsight, the sequel feels shorter compared to the first. When thinking what could be the possible reason for this, I look at how the game puts more focus on having you progress through the story and that there‚Äôs less focus on side activities, like trick-or-treating and mini-games.


While the second game feels shorter, the experience and fun factor is still there and with some improvements, like the battle cards feature, this is another experience that shouldn‚Äôt be ignored.

For starters, the trick or treating is still present, but somehow feels a bit tacked on. It‚Äôs not the main objective anymore, but a means to reach an end. The story is more convoluted with time travel, and you‚Äôll visit more locations. However, they‚Äôre not as interesting as the ones present in the original game, that had fewer but more memorable places to go. Combat is a bit different with more options and new costumes, and overall feels a bit better, with one big exception. This time you can equip 3 cards with various special effects, and after using one it will be on cooldown for a few battles. You can swap used cards for fresh ones between battles but doing that constantly after every single battle is incredibly annoying, and I just avoided most of them. And, if you‚Äôre going for all achievements, you practically need to play the entire game with only 2 party members, which is totally doable, but a bit annoying as well.
There‚Äôre still lots of things to do and collect, but the way the game tracks things going for 100% is a bit inferior to in the original game. And this time, unfortunately, you‚Äôll need to grind some battles for candy to buy everything and even to reach max level. All costumes have an upgrade now, including the 4 bonus ones from the first title that my copy included, but those are incredibly expensive to buy to give small benefits. Still, one of the best additions to progression.
Now, I‚Äôm not trying to say that this is a bad game. It‚Äôs still a good experience, I just personally enjoyed the original Costume Quest much more.

I have a xbox controller plugged in, game did not detect that. Navigated to the options with keyboard -> game freezes.

2nd try:
Game detected my controller (Press (A) instead of [Space]), but not responding to it. Unplugging controller causes another freeze. It seems that each time plugging/unplugging a controller will cause a freeze.
Game seems to display in the same resolution regardless of setting. If you run it at full screen it's at full screen, otherwise it's at some kind of windowed mode that you can't adjust the window's size or see the top bar of the window. You can only tell it's at windows mode by a very thin line of your wallpaper at the right side of your screen. This ""window"" still occupies your full screen, again regardless of game resolution settings.

3rd try:
Launched the game's DX9 version instead. Freezed immediately.
Let's see how many updates I can make to this review...
I may still try the game using a keyboard but for now this is the worst experience I've had with Double Fine games.

Final try:
So I did try to play the game with keyboard. Weirdest thing is: controller rumbles as it should be, it just won't work as an input device. Tried key binding - if I press the keys on the controller, the game seems to have registered them, in fact not. Using controller is a dream and without proper keyboard instructions makes using keyboard a nightmare.
Dialogue is not as witty as the last. Boring house grinding (oh how much I hated that part in the last game) started as soon as you unlocked the third costume.

Because of this, I was apprehensive to say the least playing the second game.

If you have played the first game and are looking for a similar experience, Costume Quest 2 brings that feeling back with a tad more simplicity, but also some flavor. It still retains combat elements from the first game, combined with the same ""battle costumes"" concept that allows you to fight monsters. The costumes you choose between in this game are new. While a few costumes are lacking in appeal to me personally, there were some costumes that were immediately my favorites. (The hot-dog costume is adorable.) You also feel rewarded fighting and playing, as you can learn combat techniques that help you and you can tell the difference between your damage output before and after you learn them.

As for the story, it can be a little confusing, simply because it has time-traveling elements, which is confusing in and of itself. Old characters from Costume Quest 1 and Grubbins on Ice show up, so it really feels like you're playing the sequel to this game. The story line is a little ridiculous, but obviously had some thought and care put into it, and I found myself playing just to know exactly what would happen, and how it would happen.

There were some things that deterred me from it, and I'm not sure if I'll play it again. If I do, it will be in place of the first Costume Quest until I get every achievement. And then it's back to the first one.

The first thing I really hated was when you got a ""perfect/critical hit"" the screen flashes bright purple/white. If you are sensitive to flashing lights, it can be annoying to see that every time you're in a battle and you get at least 1 critical hit. Be prepared if you are.

Another thing was how on-the-nose a LOT of jokes and themes were, but as far as anyone is concerned, this game IS geared toward an audience on the younger side, despite being a game that is open to all ages 10+.

There wasn't much that notably took away from the game, and I must admit it has a lot of love put into it, in terms of really making it feel like a sequel to the first Costume Quest. I would say whatever qualms you have about this series (or this game in particular) put it aside, and try playing, especially for how cheap the 1&2 bundle is.) It's about 6-7 hours of content per-game I'd say, and playing it was a fun experience. It's also really easy to put down and pick back up again after a few days/weeks. I really would genuinely recommend this game to anyone who is curious about trying it, and is looking for a serious review.

Lot of NPCs to do a talk-action, and once and a while they have something funny to say. Story was decent, if a bit bland, with typical Doublefine quality.

Played this game on an ubuntu linux desktop computer with radeon mesa graphic drivers and a gamepad controller. The game requires 1,300MBs of diskspace and a fairly fast computer system. Not a game for everyone, as seen by only 45% of steam owners advancing past the first boss fight. The (improved) combat is still a bit slow and repetitive.

Pros:
-Cute
-Not too grindy besides fights required for the main story, there are respawning mobs if you want to grind but you can beat the main story without fighting any of them.
-Retains the core mechanics and world exploration of the first game that made that game fun/interesting
-The story/world was the biggest highlight for me. The world and characters were so fun that I really wanted to go and interact with everything.

Cons:
-The game is short, about a 7-9 hr run time depending on much of a completionist you are
-Not much added in terms of gameplay when compared to the first game. If anything it is less interesting since all of the costumes use the same timing windows/mechanics for attacks and blocking.
-Once again the movement is still very janky as I got stuck on the environment a lot and even had to restart once because my character got trapped in a spot and couldn't get out.

Overall I loved the story and world, but was left wanting in terms of actual gameplay. The game is short so the lack of gameplay mechanics isn't the worst thing in the world, but it is definitely something that I wish they improved more on and had more creativity with; especially considering that this is a sequel. I think that the game is worth playing for the story/world aspects, but I think that I definitely enjoyed the first more as a game, even if I did play it 5 years ago. Enjoyable game but I expected more from a sequel.

What I liked about the first game is that it had one foot in reality and one foot in fantasy high-jinks. You trick or treated in a neighborhood, in a mall, at a festival; all while fighting monsters that only the kids seem to know exist, making it feel like just maybe its all made up, which was charming to me. This 2nd game though? Time travel, trick or treating in a dystopian monster city, evil overlords, and this time adults are involved in the adventure... it lost all connection to reality and I just really did not like that aspect.

That said, still charming overall, and can recommend if you enjoyed the first. But really, play the first one first.",1588135735,1588135735,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So when I got the gift [set] of Costume Quest 1 & 2 I was excited.  I started playing this game pretty shortly after I completed Costume Quest, and the main difference for me was that instead of using a keyboard to play, I used a playstation controller.  Any issue from there on out was a transitional one for me.  I would have to say though that I did like the controller better than the keyboard - which is one's own preference.  Anyway, a couple changes that I'm sure many reviews have covered is the way that you attack the monsters. Instead of a leveled bar with the specified ""go"" space, it was like a narrowing target which initially appeared to be impossible to successfully attack with.  I am not great at explaining this, so would encourage anyone to see if you can find a youtube video to visually show the differences.  The three main adjectives used to measure your success is AMAZING (which is the best), NICE (which is good, but could've been better), and WHOOPS, which means that you totally mistimed the hit. Not to mention that throughout the game Corvus will provide different attack strategies and teach you them throughout the game, which I'd honestly prefer to learn right from the start. My only other complaint is the Candy Corn, which other than for defensive purposes was utterly useless.  And the constant commentary whenever it was the Candy Corn's turn was annoying as well. One thing that really irritated me though was that one of the achievements for the game (which is the ONLY one I didn't get) was that you had to play all battles throughout the entire game with the Candy Corn present. Which, as I noted earlier, would be frustrating when trying to beat a particularly difficult opponent, but also annoying. However, that didn't mean that I didn't intend to do it.  The problem with that is, on occasion there are a handful (or less) of monsters that kind of pop out of nowhere to battle you, and throughout the game you're switching costumes to utilize the different in-game talents. I had intended on battling every monster with Candy Corn, but got caught unawares by one of those monsters, which totally messed up my chances of actually getting that achievement. Maybe the next play through I will aim for that. 

Other than that, the game is basically the same in terms of game play.  The story is fun, about a dentist whose mother basically tortured him by not letting him go trick or treating or eat candy or anything like that, so as an adult he basically goes overboard with that same expectation and does away with Halloween and acts as an overlord to all, which is kind of hilarious. 

I liked the costumes with this game, as I did with the first costume quest, although I would have to say that I felt that getting the Space costume was a bit anticlimactic because of course it was a pain to get, and I wasn't overly impressed with the costume's general moves or its specials, even when you had the ability to upgrade it. As much as I did love the Egyptian costume, the Wizard costume, and others, I would have to say that I preferred the costumes from Costume Quest [1] . The clown costume with the horn was absolutely obnoxious whenever a battle was won. I saw that if one had bought or pre-ordered costume quest 2 when it initially came out, that the costumes from Costume Quest would be available. I don't know if that's true or not, but I was disappointed that there was no way to get the costumes from the first game. 

I do genuinely hope that a 3rd Costume Quest will come out because I really enjoy this game series!",1588083195,1588083195,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,False,True,False,False,,,

All around this game really made me feel like i was playing a Double Fine game, this oozed originality. I really enjoyed the few easter eggs as well, like a call back to costumes of the previous game in one of the levels. The rest of this review will be in comparison to the first Costume Quest: I finished the first CQ and immediately played this one and the switch was very noticeable, mainly the artwork, the characters looked sharper. The fight mechanics changed significantly and, at first, i was against it. I hated the limitations it felt like the game put on me but by halfway through I realized that in comparison to CQ, CQ2 just felt more engaging in the fighting mechanics. The costumes all looked incredible and the addition of types made the gameplay that much more fun, it added a layer of strategy. The opponents felt less cookie cutter this time around and the script felt more imaginative. When i first started this game I didn't think I would like it, it felt very different to the original game, it felt like an adult Double Fine game that played on a cute subject but as I played I saw every little npc and all the interactive work put into this gem and i fell in love with costume quest all over again.

Au final, on retiendra surtout de ce Costume Quest 2, un jeu l√©ger et sympathique, qui se laisse jouer en un peu moins d‚Äôune vingtaine d‚Äôheures. Le concept des costumes est vraiment original mais le syst√®me de combat, tr√®s simpliste, ne fournira aucune difficult√© au joueur. Gr√¢ce √† son aspect graphique tourn√© vers la bande dessin√©e occidentale, et √† son ambiance musicale travaill√©e, Costume Quest 2 peut se vanter de s‚Äô√™tre cr√©√© une r√©elle identit√© qui marquera le joueur. Si vous voulez passer quelques heures devant un petit jeu humoristique, qui ne vous prend pas la t√™te, Costume Quest 2 fera parfaitement l‚Äôaffaire.

Costume Quest 2 est une v√©ritable petite douceur. Pris comme tel, il arrive sans mal √† embarquer le joueur dans son univers bon enfant d√©bordant d‚Äôhumour et de p√©rip√©ties gentiment monstrueuses. Loin d‚Äô√™tre un grand jeu exempt de d√©faut, on oublie sans mal ses errances durant les quelques heures qu‚Äôil nous offre. Repus de ses farces, on c√®de volontiers une partie de nos friandises √† Wren et Reynold et on laisse en toute confiance les enfants de 7 √† 12 ans (et les plus grands √©galement !), filles ou gar√ßons, partir avec eux pour l‚Äôaventure d√©guis√©e d‚Äôun soir d‚ÄôHalloween !

[h1] Description [/h1]

Costume Quest 2 is a short RPG  that follows the gameplay of the first game : You trick or treat, defeat monsters, gather candy, buy stamps, collect costumes and save the day.  Dr. Orel is the bad guy in this sequence and wants to create a future without costumes and candies by messing with magic and time.

[h1] Review [/h1]

It's a bit more challenging than the first one because you have to eat candy or find a fountain to recover HP and the fights are also more difficult and interesting, but it's basically the same as the Costume Quest 1. So I'm sure that if you've enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one.

If I had to choose one favourite I would definitely choose Costume Quest 1 because it was more related to Halloween than this one and also because everything was new. With Costume Quest 2 there are no more surprises, except for the story line that it's really well written.

It takes the 'more' approach to sequels far too literally, by not innovating on the original gameplay loop and just giving you... 'more'.

If my memory serves me, the original game had a fixed number of enemies and no respawning. This has been removed, so now any kind of exploration will result in a number of battles, particularly if you do any backtracking or grinding for XP. The combat system is bare-bones simple to the point of boredom, but you can't just mash though it like a JRPG, because every attack and defence requires a QTE to be effective, requiring you to pay attention at all times. You also no longer get passive buffs from the candy cards, requiring you to sacrifice your turn for an effect, and with one of the game's achievements requiring one of your characters to wear a non-combative costume, you will often find yourself at a disadvantage with optimal gameplay.

The story is fine; I suppose it was a logical progression to the concept, and the world and writing is as charming as ever, but they just HAD to fill it with fluff to pad the time, and that's to its detriment. Go play Costume Quest 1; it's shorter, cleaner, and a more rewarding experience.

Still worth a buy though, especially since it's one of the rare ""Halloween games that aren't horror"" out there.

Anyway the costumes are cool and each have a weakness and strength against a certain type of enemy, the wizard is pretty damn amazing. Overall a fun game that you might get bored of the repetition of, but you'll probably enjoy still.

Story:
So the game has a good, easy and well-devoloped story so that other players can follow along with it! so I'd probably rate the story of the game 8.75 / 10

Art/Design:
The Artwork for this game is also quite good! I'm not artist or expert at art but I'd say the shadings good and the characters moods fit the image for the loading screens. So I'd rate the loading screen artwork and the rest in general about 8.5/10

Graphics:
I'd like to say that they are good but I don't know if it's just to have that cartoon effect or not but I've noticed all the kids have the same face thrown onto each others model. Same for adults (ones related to the story) npc adults that are in the background just look like a potato with a cotton ball on it. although Dr. White seems to have lots of more work put into his face than any other characters face in the entire game. So I'd rate the graphics a 5.85

Costume Quest 2 is an adventure RPG with turn based combat. This is a direct sequel to Costume Quest (1) and the story this time involves traveling through time to stop an evil dentist who wants to get rid of both Halloween and candy. The 2 main characters are the same twin brother and sister from before who are joined by a couple new characters along the way. The costumes you find along the way are what determine your abilities both in and out of battle. The costumes sort of act as RPG classes and they can be switched freely among your party members when outside of battle. In the field, your player character is able to use the unique field skill of the costume they are wearing, such as the wizard's ability to light up dark places or the clown's horn which is used for various interactions throughout the game. 

[h1]What I like:[/h1]
+ All costumes are unique to this game (no repeats from the first game)
(Well, a few costumes from the first game do exist in this game, but they were a preorder bonus, which I didn't get).
+ The button timing for attacks is more focused on timing and less on reaction by using consistent buttons per party member.
+ The roller skates (faster movement speed) are no longer tied to a costume, so you can use them all the time. 
+ Same as the first game, you can choose to play as the boy or the girl as your lead character at the start of the game. 
+ Same funny sense of humor in the dialog as the first game. 
+ While you don't use the all same party members from the first game, they do play a part in the story.

[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]
- Not all costumes have an ability which can be used outside of battle. 
- While the first location is a spooky Halloween type place, the other locations of the future have less of a Halloween feel to them (for story reasons, of course).
- The first game let you go back for extras at the end of the game, this game saves at a point of no return at the very end of the game where you can't go back.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
I'm not sure if I like the first game more than the second. Costume Quest 2 has a superior battle system. CQ1 has a better connection to Halloween through it's level environments. Both games are about the same in difficulty. The first game is easier to get all the achievements. I still enjoyed this game, so I recommend playing the first game first. If you like that, this game can give you some more of the same and continue the story. If you want to go for all of the achievements, look them up first, one takes the entire game to do and you can mess it up very early (Candy Corn).

The reason the first game was good despite being repetitive is that almost every fight takes a minute, 2-4 turns if you know what you are doing and cool super attacks were going off all the time. You could run really any costumes you wanted and the only real skill you needed to make the combat not suck was the timed presses and that was simple

The way they changed it makes the same amount of fights take 3 min, animations are longer, stamps were removed and were replaced with really bad cards that charge per 2 or more battles, it feels like you do less damage in general, supers charge slowly and you almost don't want to use them in case you fight a boss next, and to top it off after every fight you have to go heal at a fountain or go into the next fight with low hp

A couple of the issues that bogged down the first game are present yet are not as bad in the repetition department. There are a few new fetch quests for you to do that oddly breaks up the monotony of fighting and collecting candy that made up the first game.

If you liked the first game, you will definitely love this as it improves a lot on story and combat, especially the combat which makes fights feel more balanced and that skill plays a significant role more so once you get the ability to counter. As well as that, each costume provides some tactical play though that's stretching it a bit since you have to guess who you're going up against for the Bonus / Weakness setups that you could only figure out after the battle.

The world is a little blander and bleaker than the previous title, but overall it feels much better to look at while you're going about trick-or-treating. Music is the same with no real changes that I can tell immediately yet the battle arenas are so much better to fight in. Alongside that, each punch just feels SOOO rewarding when you get an Amazing and even a double Amazing. There is a lot of power in each turn that sends a shiver down your spine.

- Interactive combat. (For a JRPGish experience)

Cons:
- They made the game more difficult than the first, however i feel that they changed too much. It is rather annoying after every 2 battles running back to the fountain to heal up. 
- Each costume has only 1 skill and a auto attack, so not much customization inside of  combat
- Game is only 6 Hrs long. Can be beaten in a single sitting.

In the end, not very compelling to play considering there's no challenge and every fight is a boring grind.



The original combat system has remained mostly unchanged, with a few tweaks or new features. But nothing that fundamentally changes it in any degree. The combat is still void of difficulty however. Playing the first game, by the end it started to get boring when the novelty wore off and it became obvious there's zero challenge or risk of failure. So going into this game with that knowledge, there's virtually no sense of purpose to keep playing when the novelty of the combat has long worn off and it's clear every fight is just you pushing buttons. You couldn't lose unless you literally tried. It is understandable to keep the game easy for the sake of making it accessible to children, who at this point don't actually need to be pandered too with easy games; but not even having a high difficulty option at all is just shallow design.

Yet the amount of fights in the game has seemingly only increased, while the amount of environmental exploration has decreased. So it's even more grind based then the previous one. The whole thing of using costume abilities to traverse certain obstacles in the environment, still a really generic and uninteresting gameplay mechanic. All it does, is just force the player to change their costume to push one button so they can get past an obstacle. It's not gameplay at all.

The new card system is generally worse then the previous stamp system. The new cards use up a turn and thus it's often simpler to just hit enemies instead of wasting cards on them, since the game isn't difficult enough to justify using the cards to improve your chances of winning. Meanwhile, having the cards on a battle based cooldown just discourages the player from using them at all unless absolutely necessary; and switching cards out when they go on cooldown is just tedious inventory management.

The new costumes feel uninspired. Clowns, dinosaurs, some old american guy with a wig. Not very Halloween spirited outfits and they just make it feel like the developers ran out of ideas. Having the Candy Corn costume unable to actually perform actions is boring and makes the early game extremely slow until you unlock a new costume to replace it with; a costume that actually can perform actions.

The new storyline is an overly wacky, un-Halloween themed time travel thing that just feels like a really bad attempt to artificially make the story more interesting. The story isn't very compelling especially because it's just a generic cartoon whatever type of plot; and while the writing is sometimes funny it's not usually entertaining to read. The new areas are similarly uninspired and don't really feel like very Halloween themed place to be or in general, they don't feel like logical or cozy places to be Trick-or-Treating.

The only distinct improvement in this whole game, is the speed boost shoes are no longer costume specific.


The novelty of the original game was a huge part of what made in enjoyable. The combat wasn't especially interesting but at least it was neat for awhile, the sometimes funny writing and classic Halloween cartoon plot made it feel a lot like an old school Halloween special turned into a game. This feels exactly like a bad sequel to an old school Halloween special, where all the new ideas just aren't very interesting and a lot of the original charm has worn off or been replaced by something less charming.

To a degree it highlights how fragile the quality of the original game was, as a novelty. Trying to sell that novelty a second time would of been questionable enough without clearly losing inspiration in the process. 

As a whole it's a shallowly designed game with a very shallowly written story.",1559082152,1559082891,False,1,0,0.483925551176071167,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Przez ca≈ÇƒÖ grƒô eksplorujemy r√≥≈ºne lokacje, zbieramy cukierki, kupujemy karty, kolekcjonujemy kostiumy i walczymy z przeciwnikami.

Chyba, ≈ºe decydujemy siƒô na u≈ºycie specjalnej zdolno≈õci naszego kostiumu, wtedy odbywa siƒô on bez sekwencji QTE.

That makes the review I'm about to give this one....well, a whole lot harder. <:{

While I would still recommend people try this game, Costume Quest 2 took away or changed some of the key features that made Costume Quest 1 so enjoyable. Firstly, Costume Quest 1 had these epic battle animations and camera angles that made combat super satisfying and interesting. Battle stamps equipped to your characters granted a whole slew of different passive effects or usable/triggerable abilities. In this one, the diversity of combat camera angles is almost completely gone, and the combat animations are all toned down in general epicness and have far more muted colors. Combine this with a change in how customizable abilities work (which I'll talk about in a second), and you've got a new combat system that both feels and looks boring. I found myself actively avoiding the enemies because the new combat system felt like a chore, whereas in the first game I didn't skip a single battle and actively combed and re-combed over each map in search of any baddies that I might have missed, because it was just so fun to destroy them in satisfying action-packed combat.

Now the customizable combat abilities. The change in how these work between the first game and this one is a majorly contributing culprit to why the combat is no longer fun. Battle Stamps from the first game have been replaced by reusable Creepy Treat Cards. In the first Costume Quest, you would equip one unique Battle Stamp on each of your characters to grant them various abilities, passive or otherwise; maybe one to make a character's attacks do lingering poison damage, or maybe one that grants them an additional special ability that will stun an enemy for one turn, etc. In this one, you just equip a total of three cards that any of your characters can use. The catch is that once a card is used, you can't use it again for a set number of BATTLES. That's right, entire BATTLES. In Costume Quest 1, stamps that granted passive abilities worked their magic every single turn and ones that granted additional abilities were USABLE every turn (or for special charge-up abilities, they were usable every time your special meter filled). This new system SEVERELY limits your combat versatility and customization, and largely forces you to just use your costumes regular abilities (which, combined with tedious, disinteresting combat, makes it even harder to enjoy.) To make matters worse, I am SICK TOO LITERAL DEATH of [spoiler] super hero stuff [/spoiler]. So the fact that [spoiler] that's your first costume in the game [/spoiler] was disheartening for me personally.

Not all is bad, though. Some of the maps still hold all of the magical enchanting lighting and childhood nostalgic feel that the maps from the first game did (there's a reason not all of the maps do; the lacking ones are that way intentionally, but I can't say why without spoilers). The minion dialogue I've encountered thus far (I've made it to Auburn Pines) is flat and disinteresting, but the dialogue for the Candy Corn costume FAAAAR makes up for it. You'll quickly see what I mean if you play, lol.

CQ2 is peppered with other little things that fall flat in comparison to the first game (and sometimes just in general), but it's just fun enough that I'm going to keep playing it and recommend it to others. And also because it's riding the high of fun and wonderful excitement I got from literally just finishing Costume Quest 1 (which I highly, highly encourage you to play before even touching this one, one because you'll need its inspiration to get through this second game and also because this game won't make any sense without having played the first one).",1544023577,1544023733,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Das Sequel des erfolgreichen [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/115100/Costume_Quest/?curator_clanid=32139821]ersten Teils[/url] von [url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/doublefine?snr=1_5_9__creator-home-product-page]Double Fine[/url]. Nicht unbedingt besser, sondern anders. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Wer ist der gr√∂√üte Feind von S√º√üigkeiten? Genau: Der Zahnarzt! So ist dieser im zweiten Teil unser Gegner. Die Protagonisten des ersten Teils sind auch dieses Mal wieder am Start und es gibt einige √Ñnderungen im Vergleich zum Vorg√§nger. Die lustigen und humorvollen Dialoge blieben hingegen, ganz wie man es vom Entwickler gewohnt ist, erhalten. 

Als wesentliche Ver√§nderung erachte ich das Kampfsystem. Im ersten Teil simpel und einfach gehalten, erscheint es mir nun unn√∂tig kompliziert. Jeder Charakter hat eine Zahl von 1-3, die Spezialf√§higkeiten oder andere Auswahlm√∂glichkeiten sowie der Fokus welcher Gegner attackiert wird, sind per WASD zu bestimmen. 

Der ausgeteilte Schaden scheint in Relation auch gesunken zu sein, sodass K√§mpfe jetzt gef√ºhlt l√§nger dauern. Erlittener Schaden bleibt im Anschluss an K√§mpfe erhalten und man muss sich heilen. Daf√ºr kann man jetzt quasi auch Gegner ""farmen"". Das raubt dem Ganzen den Charme des Vorg√§ngers. 

S√º√üigkeiten k√∂nnen nach wie vor f√ºr Karten ausgegeben werden, deren Verwendung ist jedoch jetzt leicht ver√§ndert. Ansonsten k√∂nnen die Kost√ºme aufgewertet werden. Hier ist es √§u√üerst positiv, dass die Kost√ºme im zweiten Teil weitestgehend andere als aus dem ersten Teil sind. Die F√§higkeiten hat man nat√ºrlich angepasst und passen entsprechend.

[b]Grafik & Sound[/b]

Grafisch hat man am Altbew√§hrten festgehalten, genauso bei der musikalischen Umrahmung. Es bleibt niedlich und knuffig, mit typischem Setting w√§hrend Halloween. Die Kameraperspektive bleibt nach wie vor ab und an hinderlich. Gef√ºhlt eher h√§ufiger als in Teil 1. Musikalisch passt das Ganze, wie schon erw√§hnt, auch weiterhin. F√ºr die Errungenschaften sollte man sich vorab informieren, denn ich musste das Spiel einmal komplett neu starten. 

[b]Fazit[/b]

Das Spiel ist in meinen Augen nicht mehr so charmant und auch die Nutzerreviews best√§tigen meinen Eindruck. W√§hrend Costume Quest 1 noch 94% positive Bewertungen aufweist, sind es hier ""nur"" 85%. Ich empfehle den Kauf von Teil 2 daher mit Vorbehalt und empfehle einen Sale (z.B. zu Halloween) oder gleich den Griff zum [url=https://store.steampowered.com/sub/53813/]Bundle[/url]. Es ist jedoch ein gutes Spiel, k√∂nnte allerdings f√ºr Spieler von Teil 1 zu Entt√§uschungen f√ºhren!

I play it every fall. It's just one of those feel good Halloween season games for me, and it never gets old.

This one? Eh, I'm sad to say, I was looking forward to it being over. It borrows a lot from the original game, including maps, quests, and character models. In fact, there is very little that's actually original in this game, and the things that are original are pretty uninspired, tbh. The music was pretty boring and lackluster too, and I found myself longing for the old battle theme a lot. Or at least for something with a little more oomph, you know? 

They changed up some of the core game mechanics and I can't really say it was for the better. You liked being auto-healed after every fight in the first game? Well, too bad! Now you have to backtrack to a heart fountain to heal after just about every battle! It's every bit as annoying as it sounds. Battle stamps are no more, replaced with creepy cards that are a one-use kind of thing and can't be used again until their cooldown (which is usually anywhere from 1-3 battles). It's not too horrible, so long as you use them wisely. There are some pretty awesome cards in the mix, and they can come in quite handy in a pinch. A lot of the costumes were kind of lame and left me disappointing, but that's just my opinion. 

All-in-all, it just felt like a half-assed rehash of the first game, and that's a huge bummer!

While the writing is decent it felt surprisingly derivative of the first. I think a large issue of that may be due to the fact that the second game is a lot more linear than the first. While the second one really had you choosing to go out of your way and explore the world for secret costumes, this one hands you every costume along the storyline. I get that these games are short but this one made me finish the game going ""wait, thats it?"" It really felt more like a small DLC of the first and calling it a second game really feels false. Much like getting crummy fast food, this game is over in a couple of bites and really makes you crave something with more sustenance.

Costume quest 2 is a cute adventure game set during halloween, its fun and full of personality, perfect for fans of turn-based combat, here the main characters are kids and they transform into the costumes they are wearing, you can control up to 3 kids in your party and theres different costumes to use, I never expected a sequel to the first one and while I think the first one is better and this one is shorter than it should have been (It isn't one of those sequels who goes big but instead play safe) It was still a surprise to me to know that a game I loved received a sequel I never expected, but while I prefer the first, having more of the same of something I really liked is not a bad thing, so I recommend both this game and the first one for everyone, especially fans of the adventure genre mixed with turn-based combat, those two are really good games.",1528835395,1653529570,True,3,1,0.562486946582794189,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall it was about as addicting as the first as far as story line went. However when it came to enemies and costumes... it was lacking in the creativity department. I'd so wished to see a brand new set of enemies but... it was very much just more of the same. There were roughly four new enemies. All of which were very plain or simplistic. Two of which made no sense whatsoever as to why they even existed... namely the random moles and snails scattered about. Why are they so big... and why are they on the enemy's side? They even look innocent at first glance.

Then there were the costumes... I was excited at the concept of a few of them but... when they were finally put together? Another batch of disappointment. I think I liked only one of the outfits on the avatars, but when it came to combat..? They were all so unintimidating. In the first game they would always turn out to be so epic, especially with their special moves but... all of these just felt purely like jokes. I understand wanting to be comedic but... I also always thought that part of the game was to give a visual representitive of how children can be strong too. That they can be whatever they want to be. Such is one of the reasons for Halloween after all. (It's even mentioned in game several times if I recall correctly.) I feel more could have been done to show this. If needed be you could have made less costumes but put more thought and time into them. That would be my personal preference though.

All in all, I would say the original Costume Quest game is preferable to this. If you loved the original... you'll probably be as saddened as I am by the content of this game. However if you have too much extra time on your hands and need a game that you don't have to put much thought into this is your game. (Aside from the acquisition of the last costume... which is more effort than it is worth. So much so I would toss it into a black hole at risk of being sucked in myself.)",1523156851,1523156851,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It's a good game, don't get me wrong. But after playing the first game, I had VERY high hopes. Some changes made to the game made perfect sense, whereas some others were very... Odd. The story was a big weakness in my opinion. I'd rather get attached to a group of characters than keep switching out in an already short game. I wanted to like some of them, but for example; the first companion to join your party feels like a random kid that would give you a stamp. Yet he's important to the story, and he joins you for a while.

I fel like the first game had a better idea; where you gradually get party members, and you have a cute interaction as you get them; already making them a bit more endearing. And then you keep them. Meaning there's even more interactions. I just think that recipe was better executed.

The combat -is- mostly better in the second game. The combos add another layer of ""intensity"", even though it also feels superfluous. The counters are a much better touch. However, making it so every single attack is the exact same ""attack meter"" was a big turn off for me. I liked having different ones in the first game, it made it less repetitive.

The removal of battle stamps felt like a huge waste to me. It removed a BIG deal of depth from the game, and I feel it was felt in the difficulty of the game. In fact; there's an achievement to beat the game having the Candy Corn costume in your party the entire time; it doesn't do any damage. That alone would be unbelievably hard if not impossible in the first game. Mostly because of the last boss, but still.

Allowing you to use rollerskates the entire time was a definite plus. You don't feel restricted to the robot if you want to be faster, unlike in the first game.

The costumes were also all perfectly fine, same for the sidequests. It felt like there was a lot more back-and-forth in this game than in the first one, which isn't super fun but eh... Not a deal-breaker.

I was kinda put off by how short the game was. The first one was short but this one was even shorter, which came as a shock to me.

Making some costumes better against certain types of enemies and whatnot... I... I didn't like that. It's like... A layer of depth this game doesn't need. I honestly ignored that part of the game completely and I did perfectly fine. It's just not necessary, and kind of an eyesore when you start seeing 2 numbers instead of just your damage while fighting. On top of the combos it kinda just looks like screen clutter to me.

I definitely prefered the ""random button"" aspect of the combat in the first game, on top of having a different attack gauge. All of it made it for a much more fun and interesting combat in my opinion.

All in all, when I think of the good things this game has done compared to the bad ones, I'd say... This is a 7/10. If there's a 3rd game and we can expect things like... 10hrs of gameplay, actually interesting characters, maybe more costumes, more puzzley areas, more interesting combat, and a more engaging story, I could see myself somehow loving it more than the first game, which I promise you is no easy feat.

This is still worth playing. But I do feel it was a downgrade from the first game. I don't think Costume Quest needs to be flashy. Or epic. It just needs to feel like a Halloween night gone wrong and you and your friends do everything in your power to fix it. This just felt like it tried too hard to be an epic adventure. Just make it a fun one. I'd say keep the charm the first game delivered. You can tell the graphics were improved in this game and I honestly didn't like the art better, because the atmosphere felt so much colder. Less full of life; vibrant. I would LOVE for a 3rd game to make the 2nd game the odd one out by making it the only ""good"" game in a series of great games.",1516478241,1516478241,True,3,0,0.542496562004089355,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It had a lot of atmosphere, a cute humor and was just generally loveable. 

Costume Quest 2 kept some of those aspects, like the free roaming in small areas, where you can do some fun side quests and the tongue-in-cheek dialogues. However, that's pretty much it.

The best way to describe this sequel is ""frustrating and dull"". The game loves to play with the players patience. That starts with the fact that everytime you want to access the main menu, you'll have to go through credits and an animation and continues when you can't skip a cutscene. 
The worst offender however is the new fighting system. First of all, all the costumes play the same (and you need much longer to acquire new ones). Even the small variation when it comes to how to execute an attack was taken out of the game. That makes the fights pretty stale, you ALWAYS press the same buttons. Apart from that, the new technique in which you initate your attacks feels weird - it's hard to understand how to actually execute ""amazing"" attacks.

The Halloween-card system was changed aswell. Instead of giving each of your character either an additonal attack or a cool passive, you can only use those cards once. That brings some more variation to the fights, but makes the cards less reliable aswell. 

Then, there is this stupid new well-system, which forces you to refill your health after each fight. If you don't do that, your characters will have decreased health the next time you get into a fight - UNLESS they died in the last battle. So you're pretty much punished for surviving fights. This can be super frustrating when you enter a bossfight with a big disadvantage, lose and then have to watch the whole cutscene again (cause you can't skip it). 

The level-design isn't very exciting aswell. Thinking of the great Grubbins On Ice DLC for CQ1, that brought some variation to the areas, Costume Quest 2 feels like a rehash of the first game with muddy textures. The side-quest are pretty much the same ones aswell.

in conclusion, the sequel does not do justice to the first game and comes across pretty lackluster. Neither the story nor the gameplay are actually engaging and most of the ""improvements"" feel gimmick-y.",1514302343,1514302343,False,92,2,0.825510323047637939,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The turn based battles are fun if a bit shallow.  The timed based attacks and blocks keep you on your toes and the super attacks and ability cards add a bit of strategy to the battle.  There are plenty of costumes that allow you to change character class and each costume makes the battle a little different, mostly due to the unique super attack for that class.  Plus they look cool in an 80ies cartoon sort of way.  The neighborhood is just as much fun to explore as last time, and some of the costumes open up new avenues of exploration with their abilities.  For example if that alley is too dark to see then light the way with your wizard wand and find that missing costume piece or rare creepy treat card.  

There are only a few settings to explore this time thru but each one is chock full of atmosphere with plenty of quirky characters to talk to and lots of candy to find.  The lack of enemy variety hurts Costume Quest 2 but there are a few interesting boss battles and the story, atmosphere and exploration is really the calling card of the series anyway.  Costume Quest 2 is not the evolution of the series that I hoped for, but it‚Äôs still a blast to play on a crisp fall night with some hot cider and a bowl of candy corn.  

Costume Quest 2, like the original, works best as a light JRPG and an ode to Halloween for the kid in all of us.  It‚Äôs still more treat than trick, but with mini fun sized candy bars instead of the full size ones.  Happy Trick or Treating and don‚Äôt forget to floss afterwards!

Orel White setzt seinen Plan um, alle S√ºssigkeiten zu verbannen, um eine Welt der perfekten Zahnhygiene zu erschaffen, der aufgrund eines MacGuffins und eines Zeitzauberers Erfolg zu haben scheint. Nun liegt es am Geschwisterpaar, die althergebrachte Ordnung wiederherzustellen und den Karies zur√ºck zu bringen.

So viel zur Handlung. Costume Quest 2 ist eine direkte Fortsetzung zum Erstling und setzt direkt da an, wo der erste Teil sein Ende gefunden hat. Es ist nicht zwingend notwendig, den Vorg√§nger gespielt zu haben, aber empfehlenswert ist es alle Male, da man sonst mit einigen Figuren √ºberhaupt nichts anfangen kann.

Im Mittelpunkt stehen erneut die Kost√ºme und das simple, aber √ºberaus charmante Kampfsystem, das im Vergleich zum ersten Teil ein wenig angepasst wurde: So hat jetzt jeder Charakter eine festgelegte Taste, die sowohl f√ºr die Verteidigung, als auch f√ºr den Angriff verwendet wird, was einiges an Frust erspart und den Schwerpunkt auf den Rhythmus legt, den man braucht, um m√∂glichst effektiv anzugreifen oder zu verteidigen.

Die Kampfmarken des Erstlings ist ebenfalls der Schere zum Opfer gefallen und wurde durch ein Kartensystem ersetzt. Dieses Mal sammelt man Karten und nutzt die teilweise sinnlosen oder √ºbertrieben Effekte in den K√§mpfen, um sich einen Vorteil zu verschaffen (Oder einen Nachteil - warum man einen Kampf in doppelter Geschwindigkeit spielen will, erschlie√üt sich mir einfach nicht.). Mir pers√∂nlich hat das Markensystem besser gefallen, auch wenn es nur passive Effekte waren, denn durch die Karten kommt nicht gerade frischer Wind ins Geschehen. Daf√ºr sind die Abklingzeiten einiger Karten viel zu lang und manchmal steuert man einige K√§mpfe ohne brauchbare Karten durch die Gegend.

Die Selbstheilungsmechanik des ersten Teils wurde ebenfalls ver√§ndert: Dieses Mal wird man am Ende des Kampfes nicht wieder auf 100% Leben hochgeheilt, sondern muss einen Brunnen suchen oder S√ºssigkeiten naschen, um die eigene Gesundheit wiederherzustellen. Das ist - in meinen Augen - komplett √ºberfl√ºssig. S√ºssigkeiten hat man immer in H√ºlle und F√ºlle und es gibt keinen Grund, einen Brunnen anzusteuern. Da h√§tte Double Fine es auch dabei belassen k√∂nnen, dass man am Ende jedes Kampfes geheilt wird, anstatt damit Tiefe vorzugaukeln, die nicht gegeben ist.

Grafisch hat sich nicht sonderlich viel getan. Nat√ºrlich, die Grafik schaut etwas runder aus als im ersten Teil, aber da Costume Quest kein grafisch anspruchsvoller Titel ist, lassen sich die Unterschiede nur mit der Lupe erkennen. Das ist aber nichts Schlechtes, denn das Spiel lebt von seinem Cartoonstil und dem charmanten Figurendesign.

Im Gro√üen und Ganzen hat Double Fine mit diesem Titel viel richtig gemacht: Die meisten √Ñnderungen sind Quality of Life-Anpassungen, so kann man z.B. jetzt den Dash benutzen, ohne das Roboterkost√ºm zu tragen, und das Kampfsystem geht deutlich besser von der Hand, aber trotzdem gibts Dinge, die mir √ºbel aufsto√üen: Durch das dystopische Weltbild geht sehr, sehr viel Charme verloren. Im ersten Teil kam ich mir vor, als w√ºrde ich eine Gruppe Kinder durch die Nachbarschaft begleiten und S√º√ües oder Saures spielen, wobei die Fantasie der Kinder aus den Kost√ºmen Superhelden uswpp geformt hat. Das ist im zweiten Teil nur noch im Startgebiet der Fall. Danach verliert sich das Spiel ein wenig zu sehr in seiner dystopischen Fantasie und der Zeitreiseproblematik und nimmt den ganzen Quark, der um die Kinder herum passiert, viel zu ernst. Dadurch ist die Welt nur mit wenigen Charakteren bev√∂lkert, was ich sehr schade finde, da mir im ersten Teil die Interaktionen zwischen den Kindern die gr√∂√üte Freude bereitet haben. Die Verspieltheit ist irgendwo fl√∂ten gegangen und jetzt stehen die Kleinen zwischen zu vielen Erwachsenen herum, die sie von A nach B schicken. Schade!

Trotzdem: Costume Quest 2 ist ein starkes Spiel und hat mich w√§hrend meiner gesamten Spielzeit sehr gut unterhalten. Im Direktvergleich w√ºrde ich den Erstling eher empfehlen als den zweiten Teil, aber das w√§re Korinthenkackerei. Beide Spiele sind gut und man kann sie sorglos einpacken, um ein paar Stunden in eine einfachere Zeit abtauchen, als man zum Fasching mit seinen Freunden um die H√§user gezogen ist, um alte Leute um S√ºssigkeiten anzubetteln.",1509966750,1509966750,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It took the idea from that Buffy episode (and Treehouse of Horror, and probably a lot of other examples) where the characters turn into their costumes and use it as the combat mechanics of an rpg staring kids battling candy stealing goblins. It's was a cute idea, that had charm and was pretty funny in a silly Double Fine way. A pretty good if simple game. Along comes Costume Quest 2 and brings in time travel and a insane dentist and it's just not as good as the first game. 

It's not as funny this time. The costumes are not as creative, and the novelty of the game has worn off after 1 game and a DLC expansion. The combat is somewhat more involved this time, bit it adds a really anoying mechanics with the removal of post battle healing, forcing you to backtrack to a fountain (or to eat some candy). It doesn't add anything, it doesn't make the game any harder and it just makes the battles anoying. 

Overall it's still pretty much the same rpg-lite for kids, but the combat mechanics is still kind of uninteresting and too simple and the storyline is weak, even when you take ""it's for kids"" into concideration. The first game had charm that made it a pretty good game.

COMPRALO PERCHE:
-La Storia, seppur risulti molto fanciullesca, pu√≤ appassionare ed incuriosire il giocatore sino a spingerlo quantomeno al compimento dell'avventura non risulta minimamente prolissa puntando molto sul sodo seppur con larga presenza di cliche e davvero ben pochi colpi di scena. Caratterizzazioni dei personaggi divertenti e che non infastidicono per la loro idiozia (piaceranno sicuramente ad un pubblico pi√π giovane)

LASCIALO A STEAM:
-Graficamente il titolo non brilla di certo sotto il lato puramente tecnico regalando un cell-shading molto abbozzato e con davvero poco carisma (decisamente meno del predecessore seppur il balzo di poligoni lo si nota in maniera decisa). Un titolo che da il meglio di se nel lato artistico che risulta sicuramente divertente e caricaturale ma meno geniale del predecessore. Gira anche su un Tostapane quindi lato ottimizzazione e fruibilit√† generale non si pu√≤ che lodarlo purtroppo in generale non risulta essere un comparto cos√¨ SUFFICIENTE da meritare il pollice in su (soprattuto per non aver raggiunto il livello del predecessore)
-Il comparto Sonoro non brilla ne per originalit√† (qualche track presa dal predecessore) ne per variet√† (per tutta l'avventura le tracce saranno quelle 3/4 ripetute all'infinito). Una totale assenza di doppiaggio ed una realizzazione molto abbozzata dei rumori ambientali regalano un comparto sicuramente insufficiente
-Ludicamente parlando il titolo si ispira in maniera molto semplicistica agli RPG con un sistema di crescit√† dei personaggi dovuta all'esperienza post battaglia o missione principale o secondaria che sia. Punto focale del comparto rimangono, cos√¨ come il primo capitolo e cos√¨ come fa intuire il titolo dell'opera, i costumi (circa una decina, ognuno diverso ed ognuno con abilit√† uniche, seppur un paio si somigliano in tutto e per tutto). I nemici risultano a schermo quindi si pu√≤ sempre e comunque decidere se ingaggiare o meno una battaglia seppur il grinding ed il farming siano totalmente assenti visto il level cap decisamente basso dei protagonista e delle battaglie che puntano pi√π sul tempismo nel premere un tasto durante il colpo che sulla strategia di malus/bonus o sull'essere decisamente pi√π forte a stat rispetto al nemico (molto in tal senso la fa la scelta del costume, non possibile da switchare in battaglia). In generale, per tutta la durata del titolo un comparto che diverte ma ampiamente difettoso soprattuto per una difficolt√† quasi assente, un sistema di missioni decisamente caotico e che risultano poi nel compimento delle solite azione e nella ricerca spasmodica del Costume successivo per sbloccare i paletti delle varie aree che il gioco impone e se a questo aggiungiamo una non perfetta navigazione del personaggio nella world map, un sistema di controllo non del tutto calibrato ed in parte buggato (colpi o parate perfetti non calcolati, e viceversa) ed uno svolgimento delle battaglie davvero semplicistiche seppur con qualche buona idea (il ragionamento tipico dei giochi con battaglie a turni risultano in toto inutile) non pu√≤ che farmi bocciare anche questo comparto.
-Anche a longevit√† siamo messi piuttosto maluccio, terminato il primo capitolo con il doppio delle ore (e mi sembrava gi√† una durata molto striminzita) anche la rigiocabilit√†, visto le parole spese, non risulta poi cos√¨ eccelsa (una volta terminato sicuramente non vi verr√† voglia di riprenderlo ne nel breve ne nel lungo periodo)

Che dire se non...Delusione?!
Mi aspettavo un titolo dai toni fanciulleschi ma non cos√¨ tanto ed avendo giocato il capitolo precedente (non mi era neanche dispiaciuto) mi sarei aspettato passi avanti pi√π decisi e marcati invece mi son ritrovato un prodotto insipido e che non porta nulla al panorama indie se non la classica storia di Bambini che salvano Halloween. Peccato.

VOTO
30/100
Sicuramente un pubblico decisamente pi√π giovane potr√† apprezzare di pi√π un titolo di questo stampo ma, il mio consiglio, √® di far ingegnare i ragazzi nei videogiochi e non dargli in pasto un titolo dove la loro testa pu√≤ andare tranquillamente in vacanza data la sua ""stupidit√†""",1504391655,1504391655,False,2,0,0.469688236713409424,0,False,False,False,False,,,

En esta entrega, la esencia divertida se mantiene pero el sistema de combate var√≠a un poco, ya que incorporan cartas jugables en vez de sellos para los stats de los disfraces, lo cual aumenta bastante el estilo de lucha a algo m√°s elaborado.

PROS
-Las conversaciones y la trama en general es graciosa, se pasa un buen rato. Adem√°s, es el broche final a la historia (o lo parece) de forma bastante digna
-El sistema de juego por turnos junto con los disfraces y sus golpes especiales son divertidos

CONS
En este punto.... El juego ya no me ha entusiasmado tanto. Hay errores t√©cnicos que ensombrecen la jugabilidad en alg√∫n punto. En mi caso sufr√≠ tres:
-En un momento dado, al comienzo de una batalla, las cartas jugables se ve√≠an delante sin poder ver el cursor ni a d√≥nde clicaba; s√≥lo se solucion√≥ atinando ""a lo que fuera"" unos segundos, despu√©s de varios intentos fallidos en el que terminaba d√°ndole a huir sin querer xD

EDITO: En cons mencionaba unos supuestos fallos relacionados con llevar el disfraz de robot, porque era pon√©rmelo y que los enemigos me ignorasen. Tambi√©n me quejaba de que en la batalla final no pod√≠a pon√©rmelo para luchar y verlo en acci√≥n. Pues... estos ""fallos"" no eran tales, sino que el disfraz en cuesti√≥n, su utilidad especial es la del SUBTERFUGIO, o sea, pasar desapercibido....... Por eso no me interactuaba y en la batalla final desaparec√≠a y la m√°quina me endi√±aba el ma√≠z dulce por defecto >,< xD (no caig√°is en errores tontos como el m√≠o, leed bien las descripciones de los disfraces xDDDD)

As√≠ que bueno, s√≥lo me queda rectificar y a√±adir que joer, ya podr√≠an poner alguna pista de ello, que los pjs comentaran algo antes y as√≠ el tema no pillara de improviso justo adem√°s en el final, con las prisas del boss :S xDDDD

Hilando la historia original, meti√©ndonos de lleno en otra, y endulzando la semana de Halloween. ¬øQu√© m√°s pod√≠amos pedir? Quiz√°s un poco m√°s de jugabilidad, y menos repetici√≥n o mayor profundidad, aunque por lo dem√°s sigue la estela de una decente aventura RPG, en la que el g√©nero de aventura, de investigaci√≥n, de hacer clic aqu√≠ y all√°, de buscar las claves de la trama, se mezclan con el combate por turnos caracter√≠stico del rol cl√°sico. Eso s√≠, donde el humor y la belleza visual abundan por todos los recovecos del juego. 

Con un alma infantil, Costume Quest 2 nos pone en los ojos de los gemelos Reynold y Wren, que a trav√©s de agujeros en el tiempo, disfraces que emulan los cl√°sicos en Halloween, y la incesante b√∫squeda de caramelos y pegatinas de poder, han de evitar que un malvado dentista deje al mundo sin caramelos. 
 
 JUGABILIDAD 
Costume Quest 2 basa su sistema de juego en el ir y venir de los dos protagonistas disfrazados en un d√≠a de Halloween mientras intentamos detener al malvado dentista. Y estos disfraces no solo otorgan un m√©todo pintoresco de moverse por el escenario, sino que cada disfraz otorga en el combate un rol determinado. De este modo, podremos ir disfrazados de ‚ÄúSuperh√©roes‚Äù, que nos conceder√°n capacidad de da√±o directo; de ‚ÄúPayaso‚Äù, con habilidades de curaci√≥n; de ‚ÄúMalvavisco‚Äù, el cual no hace m√°s que recibir da√±o (pero es muy gracioso), o si necesitamos apoyo siempre podremos recurrir a un disfraz de ‚ÄúPerisod√°ctilo‚Äù. Vamos, los cuatro cl√°sicos roles en un mundo de fantas√≠a. 

CONCLUSIONES 
Aquellos que hayan disfrutado de la primera parte, no encontrar√°n muchas novedades en este, y aunque s√≠ se corrigen determinados problemas como la velocidad de los personajes a la hora de recorrer el mapa, los mismos problemas del original siguen en esta nueva entrega. A los apasionados de Double Fine nos encontraremos ante un estilo similar, y cierta cercan√≠a en la forma de jugar. Y aquellos que llegan nuevos, no necesitar√°n conocer el Costume Quest original, ya que este es en s√≠ mismo una entrega √∫nica. 

Los gr√°ficos cumplen perfectamente su funci√≥n, y nos meten de lleno en una historia colorida, donde las explosiones, los gestos extravagantes y las animaciones un poco anime har√°n las delicias de los fans de Double Fine. Escoge a Reynold o escoge a Wren, y emb√°rcate en la aventura de evitar que el se√±or White, malvado dentista, intente dejar al mundo sin caramelos. D√©jate llevar por una aventura de caramelos de sabores, llena de colores y de disfraces. Y disfruta de una tarde de peleas roleras, mientras de forma virtual pides ‚Äútruco o trato‚Äù, una vez al a√±o, mientras el humor y la belleza del mundo de Costume Quest 2 te maravilla. 

LO MEJOR: 

La ambientaci√≥n, el mundo colorido y detallista.

El humor ,que nos hace sonre√≠r en muchas ocasiones.

Aunque no sea habitual, la duraci√≥n. El tiempo de juego es suficiente para disfrutar del t√≠tulo.

After playing through Costume Quest 1, I took a break by playing something else, because honestly, that game is not great. It has the charm, but the combat was too simplistic and repetitive. Some players also had problems with the fast-scrolling, automated texts. Though I still think this sequel is somewhat too easy, I do think that this game can be considered as one of the best video game sequels in recent years.

It's improves everything from the first game. The combat this time is more intriguing with the slight rock-paper-scissors mechanic and the significance of the cards. Graphically they also added a lot of great looking effects, lots of original assests and generally more detail to the world. I thought the first game had a great style to it, but the sequel just made the style prettier in overall. Perhaps the best improvement is the writing. The story has a lot more going on, the humor pretty much always hits and the cutscenes (including those in combat) have been treated with care.

I've one would ask me, I'd say this game is one of Double Fines best, next to Iron Brigade.",1492962286,1495984024,True,30,1,0.748088359832763672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Entonces este juego es lo que buscas.[/h1]

La primera entrega me encant√≥ y esta no se ha quedado atr√°s. Costume Quest 2 es un juego en el que tienes que ir haciendo misiones por diferentes localizaciones hasta conseguir llegar a la batalla final con el enemigo principal del juego (un dentista). La ambientaci√≥n de esta segunda entrega es sublime, adem√°s podemos explorar las zonas que vayamos desbloqueando. La historia en s√≠ es muy graciosa y divertida, aunque no es nada del otro mundo tampoco. Podemos seguir la historia principal y a su vez ir realizando misiones secundarias y recogiendo caramelos (ya sea en casas, batallas u objetos que encontremos) los cuales nos servir√°n para comprar mejoras de disfraces y cartas.

El dise√±o art√≠stico es muy bueno, personalmente me enamoran los juegos as√≠. El sistema de combate se hace algo repetitivo a la larga debido a lo simple que es. Se basa en combates por turnos, donde podremos lanzar dos tipos de ataques (uno normal y otro especial), tambi√©n se pueden lanzar dos en el mismo turno, defenderse y contraatacar. Tambi√©n se pueden utilizar cartas en el combate, las cuales vamos recogiendo en batallas, cofres o compr√°ndolas.

Tenemos 11 personajes diferentes (que en realidad son disfraces de Halloween: hombre lobo, superh√©roe, payaso, perrito caliente, mago... ), cada uno con su ataque normal y especial, como nombr√© anteriormente. Algunos de ellos tambi√©n tienes habilidades fuera de combate, √∫tiles para realizar misiones secundarias y acceder a zonas secretas. Un disfraz a destacar es el de ""Ma√≠z de caramelo"", un personaje que NO ataca y que se dedica a decir frases graciosas cada vez que es su turno. Existe un logro, en el cual tienes que pasarte el juego luchando con √©l en todas las batallas, un plus de dificultad para el que acabe el juego y quiera volver a rejugarlo.

La duraci√≥n es algo mayor con respecto a la primera entrega, sobre las 9-10 horas se pueden conseguir todos los logros. En rebajas este juego se puede conseguir tirado de precio (yo lo compr√© por 3‚Ç¨), al igual que la primera entrega (que ha llegado a estar a 0,99‚Ç¨). As√≠ que si buscas un juego para divertirte, pasar el rato y probar algo diferente, no dudes en comprarlo. Eso s√≠, recomiendo antes jugar la primera entrega para as√≠ enterarte mejor de todo.

W√§hrend die Spielmodus-Ansicht und die Story doch eher an ein j√ºngeres Publikum gerichtet ist, ich kann ohnehin mit dem amerikanischen Halloween nichts anfangen, ist der Kampfmodus recht witzig gemacht.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Das Gameplay von Costume Quest 2 hat sich im vergleich zum Vorg√§nger nicht gro√üartig ver√§ndert, hat aber einige entscheidende Neuerungen.
Das [b]Kampfsystem[/b] ist im Gro√üen und Ganzen das gleiche wie im Vorg√§nger. Man bek√§mpft im Rundenkampf die Gegner. Bei Angriffen und Verteidigungsaktionen wird ein Quicktime-Event gestartet, das bei bestehen den ausgeteilten Schaden erh√∂ht oder erlittenen verringert. Die drei Klassenelemente im Spiel bringen je nach resistenz Boni oder Abz√ºge im Kampf. Charaktere, die beispielsweise gegen magische Monster stark sind, erleiden durch sie weniger Schaden und verursachen ihnen mehr Schaden. Auf der anderen Weise erleiden Charaktere von Gegnern gegen deren Typ sie schwach sind mehr Schaden und f√ºgen ihnen auch weniger zu. 

Anders als im Vorg√§nger hat man keine Kampfmarken mehr, die permanente Boni bieten sondern [b]Sammelkarten[/b], die man einmalig im Kampf einsetzen kann und bei bedachtem Einsatz gro√üe Auswirkung auf das Kampfgeschehen haben.

Das war es dann mit den Neuerungen auch schon. Wie im Vorg√§nger l√§uft man in den einzelnen levels herum, geht von Haus zu Haus und sammelt dabei S√º√üigkeiten. Ziel ist es oftmals unter anderem, alle H√§user abzuklappern. Dabei wird man hin und wieder von Gegnern angegriffen. 
In den Levels sind oftmals zahlreiche optionale Secrets und Kost√ºmteile versteckt, aus denen man sich ein Kost√ºm basteln kann, das ben√∂tigt wird, um im Spiel weiter zu kommen, denn wie im Vorg√§nger haben Kost√ºme auch hier oftmals besondere Eigenschaften und F√§higkeiten, die einem neue Wege ebnen, so kann der Pterodactylkost√ºm beispielsweise Laufhaufen hinwegblasen, die im Weg sind.

[h1]Grafik/Soundtrack[/h1]
Die Grafik hat den selben minimalistischen, kindlichen Stil wie im Vorg√§nger und passt damit gut zum Thema des Spiels. Der Soundtrack ist recht h√∂renswert.

[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]

[b]Positiv:[/b]
[list]
    [*]einfach zu erlernendes, eing√§ngiges Kampfsystem
    [*]Hier und da Humor
[/list]

[b]Negativ:[/b]

    [*]immer noch zu leicht f√ºr √§ltere Spieler. Taktische Ans√§tze gehen unter. Mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade w√§hren gut.

    [*]gro√üteils repetatives Gameplay

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]
Costume Quest 2 kn√ºpft an der Konzept des Vorg√§ngers an, wenn auch nicht komplett. Wer den Vorg√§nger gut fand und wem nach weiteren S√º√üigkeitensammelstreifz√ºgen durch die verschiedenen Levels ist, der kann hier zugreifen.

In the sequel a grumpy Halloween-hating Dentist threatens to destroy the beloved holiday in order to build a new society where candy and Halloween are illegal. The heroes from the last game - the twin siblings Wren and Reynold - again fight baddies, collect costumes, candy and trading cards but this time also have to use time travel where they take a glance into a bleak future with even North-Korean, communist tendencies (no joke, there are two or three or even more references).

So the story's a bit bigger than last time, although I admit that I prefer the first game also because of the story. It felt like something a child would completely fantasize about (some bullies stealing candy and fighting you, the own mother being the evil witch boss) while the sequel provides a story that's almost nowhere just out of a child's mind. It's a matter of taste but it's still enjoyable. But the first game just spreads that Halloween feeling much better.

The gameplay is almost the same and not hard to learn after a while. However, fighting and handling the menues and trading cards are different. Generally it's not bad but if you played the first game and liked the controls there, you might need time to get used to the new controls. When it comes to fighting, there's a character teaching you moves in tutorials.

The new costumes are sweet for the most part and in some way or others replace the old ones (like the clown replaces the Statue of Liberty...I never thought I would actually say this or write this down...).

The graphics are a little bit better and the music is okay, though, not very memorable.

The puzzles throughout should be easy to solve, yet there are also challenging ones (like getting access to a place or finding necessary items in a city with easy missable corners). And also you can collect achievements for a couple of optional actions (like pimping your costumes which you can but don't have to do).

Overall it still is fun but I like the first ""Costume Quest"" more. If you haven't played the first game, you might not totally get into the characters or their references to the first story. I generally recommend to play both if you love RPGs and/or Halloween.",1486493272,1486493272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the story of Costume Quest 2 is meant to continue on from the first game, and is meant to embody the same style, I would say that this sequel is not quite as strong as the original.

I am an extreme fan for the first game and still really enjoyed this game, but it definitely has some big weaknesses. Note that I played both of the games back-to-back, so certain details stood out even more than they might have for years apart.

An adventure RPG is here for you again, as you continue with the brother and sister from the first game, stuck in a bad world suddenly being taken over by a dentist of all people. You must fight your way through some returning monsters from the first game as well as robots created by the dentist to keep his world in check.

Many of the mechanics of the first game still exist, such as using costume abilities to explore the map, the same player stats, the turn-based RPG battles... However, there are some tweaks here and there. In the first game, the only way to sprint across maps was to use the robot ability, which was a slight grievance to keep changing costumes. This game fixes that with its own designated button, thankfully. Further, in the previous game, most battles were triggered at specific points, with only a few sections having enemies walking along the map. This game now has many sections where enemies will run around on the map and you need to avoid them unless you want battle - and many of them respawn. That change is good for giving the maps more life, but bad in the sense that the game adds in some grinding.

Other bigger changes are to the battle style. In the previous game, you mainly performed normal attacks and used the special powers when available. This game adds in a few changes to that: First, you can now run away from battles if you do not want to have them. Second, the developers removed Battle Stamps and you now find Treat Cards which allow for special attacks or powers in battle. You can equip 3 cards at a time and any character can use them. They can only be used once per battle, and each card has a different time limit before it can be reused (i.e., you must complete X number of battles). Third, when you perform attacks, you must now hit the attack button at an exact timing to perform more damage, which is much tougher than in the original game.

Some of those battle changes make the game stronger, some make it weaker. One thing I particularly noticed is that the majority of battles take a lot longer than they did in the first game. The developers seemed to make enemies a lot stronger and you a lot weaker. (As a note, I did have one of my characters being the Candy Corn costume the whole game!)

Besides the above, the rest of the game is pretty much the same, but this time not as fun. You explore the maps, use costumes to get around, and perform trick-or-treating a lot while also solving some side quests... While the first game was quite nice to do that exploration, it now became somewhat of a chore. The story of the game is not as well-done as the first, for many of the main characters only show up occasionally, and the game has a significantly smaller amount of conversations and funny dialog. Further, while the places of exploration are still nice in style, that lack of characters and events makes some of them particularly boring.

If you enjoyed the first Costume Quest, you might still enjoy Costume Quest 2 to some ends, as I still did. But I definitely think that the developers fell behind on keeping the game consistent. The feeling of heart and charm that I had for the first game only happens sporadically for this one.",1484509836,1484608157,True,3,0,0.540198087692260742,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Costume Quest 2 is, plainly, an RPG about kids trick or treating.  On the surface, that's all it is.  However, it's Tim Schafer at the helm with all his inherent crazyness making it absolutely hilarious.  The battle system is quite nice and nods to classics such as Super Mario RPG with its timing mechanisms and job system (well, costume system in this case) of Final Fantasy 5, but put in a very light way so people of all ages can enjoy it.

Costume Quest 2 is an adventure game developed by the wonderful people behind Stacking, Brutal Legend and Grim Fandango: Remastered; Double Fine Productions and published by Majesco Entertainment and Midnight City. Double Fine Producitons once again hits the nail yet again with their cleverly designed and well thought out game

Costume Quest 2 continues right after the ending of Costume Quest which I won't spoil here. Across the game's worlds you have to go and knock doors to ask for candy. Sometimes you will get regular human beings who give you candy, sometimes its the nasty Grubbins which it will send you into an RPG button prompt combat system. The combat system is sort of fun but can get very repetitive and boring

This game, the same with Stacking, is meant for people unlike me who are known as completionists. Completionists will have a ball playing Costume Quest 2 and leveling up. The game's graphics are really cute and well designed, the music is nothing special but it is good nevertheless

Costume Quest 2 is the same as Costume Quest, it is very repetitive. Expect to enter the boring combat system multiple times and doing the same thing which is trick or treating can get boring and repetitive too. The game is okay at first but it can be impossible to finish if you are not leveled up properly

Costume Quest 2 has some improvements from the first game but also has some new or the same issues that Costume Quest suffered with that made me not enjoy it. Costume Quest 2 however is certainly more enjoyable and entertaining yet somewhat repetitive at certain points and is certainly better than Costume Quest

Double Fine have a habit of making charming games that I love. They aren't perfect (except Psychonauts which literally is perfect and when I die I hope to be buried with it) but what they lack in one area they will more than make up for in story telling, character development and humour. I found that I take more screenshots playing Costume Quest games and DLC than any other game.

E' proprio per questo che questo nuovo capitolo non mi √® andato molto gi√π.

Sebbene sembra sia stato fatto per i giocatori pi√π piccoli (molto piccoli), il primo era divertente anche per i pi√π grandi, con dialoghi di certo infantili ma non scritti proprio da poppanti per poppanti, ed un gameplay che comunque fa passare piacevolmente qualche ora (poche a dire il vero) in completo relax, fatto molto gradito da gente pi√π grande (come me), perch√® non sempre si ha voglia di azione o spremimeningi dopo una brutta giornata.

Ecco, nonostante ci√≤, questo gioco non lo vedo adatto ad un bambino piccolo, a meno che non sia assistito da un adulto. Per altri motivi, non lo vedo adatto ad un adulto, visto che non sempre √® puro relax.

Lo svolgimento del gioco √® spesso confusionario: ci sono luoghi nei quali √® difficile capire cosa dobbiamo fare perch√® le nostre azioni non hanno nessuna logica, e gli obiettivi di missione sono generici e poco comprensibili. Ci√≤ non accade troppo spesso, per fortuna, ma comunque accade, e la struttura confusa degli ambienti di gioco, e quella praticamente inutile della mappa del territorio, di certo non aiutano.

Poi non aiuta nemmeno il sistema di combattimento, che per fortuna almeno non √® random. Questo secondo capitolo implementa un nuovo sistema che richiede la pressione di un tasto al momento giusto, sia per l'attacco che per la difesa, se vorrete riuscire a vincere. Sebbene sembra buono su carta, nella pratica non funziona cos√¨ bene, visto che, per qualche motivo, ho trovato che il momento giusto per premere il tasto √® rilevato un po a casaccio. Non so se dipenda da un bug mai risolto, ma ho ottimi riflessi e nonostante ci√≤, il gioco spesso rileva la mia pressione al momento sbagliato, rendendo difficile fare danno (e difesa) massimi. Anche qui, comunque, niente di impossibile o complicato, visto che i combattimenti non sono molto difficili.
E' poi molto noioso il dover andare a bere da una fontanella dopo ogni combattimento, ma almeno ora si pu√≤ anche mangiare qualche caramella raccolta per ottenere lo stesso effetto. Sarebbe bastato che i personaggi si ricaricassero automaticamente dopo ogni combattimento per rendere il gioco molto pi√π godibile.

L'esplorazione viene promossa mediante la solita caccia ai segreti, ma anche qui c'√® qualcosa che non va: le mappe sono piene zeppe di ostacoli invisibili che rendono anche questa operazione pi√π noiosa che divertente.

Per il resto non c'√® molto altro da dire. La grafica √® buona ma forse ha qualche problema di stabilit√† di framerate di troppo; inspiegabile, tra l'altro. Mentre il sonoro √® allo stesso livello del precedente capitolo, da quanto ricordo.
Buona la selezione di personaggi anche se, alla fine, non ne vedo molto il senso, visto che potrete vincere con praticamente qualsiasi combinazione di essi. Avrei preferito che fossero utilizzati meglio.

Insomma, un gioco che non √® all'altezza del primo, che non va bene n√© per i bambini n√© per gli adulti, e che consiglio solo con un buon sconto o in un bundle.",1480354519,1480354519,False,0,0,0.437026053667068481,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The first Costume Quest held a special place in my heart. It's sequel had a lot to live up to. 

From the get-go I was not impressed. The game's storyline seemed loaded, time-travel - really? Despite the graphics retaining their similarity with the original there was a lot of added 'detail', it felt cluttered. To top it all off the fighting mechanics had changed. From playing the original to this in a short span of time, the altered fighting style was jarring and uncomfortable. 

But the costumed kids had provided me such joy in the past, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and stuck with it.

After some groaning and grousing. Some frowning and some grumbling. The storyline began to unfold. Familiar faces resurfaced and a smile was gracing my lips. The world you explored had deepened, the hidden bonuses for exploring were genuinely rewarding. The battle system, especially as it expanded became just as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable than the original. 

By the end I was thoroughly satisfied! The antagonist was a great blend of bizarre and entertaining and entirely appropriate for the game's Halloween-themed setting and the cotumes were, as always, fantastic to see in battle-form. (Of particular note was Jefferson's 'Declaration of Destruction.') The strengths and weaknesses mechanic was also a nice detail and the ability to upgrade your costumes, which in turn, changed their appearance, was kind of awesome. 

Unfortunately, the game felt much easier this time around. Much more forgiving, especially later on in the game. The water fountains were never an issue, as you could eat candy on-the-go to keep your health in check. I didn't use the cards a single time, only after I had finished the game to farm the achievement. The only tedium I found was exploring the little overworld's your character's traverse, as the maps were almost entirely useless and a few secrets and a hiding kid or two drove my patience to it's limit. 

Nevertheless, I would highly suggest this game for it's charm, maybe not at full price, mine was bought at a discount, but for the original I shelled out the full price, here and on my old ps3. It provided me with quite a few hours of enjoyment, it is an exceptional sequel and I would definitely buy another installment.

One of the highlights of Costume Quest was the story and I wasn't disappointed with this new storyline - saving Halloween traveling through time, fighting the evilish Dr. White and his dental army. A lot of fun, new costumes and abilities, various new cards to use in combat and of course, new characters. The gameplay and the quests remain identical, but it doesn't get boring for all that (you can even skip combat animations if it starts bothering you after a while). Let's not forget to mention that they (finally !) added maps.

So I would play this game with the ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement in mind, because the last game did somewhat better at not just favoring the player in most battles.

Pros:
Graphics are slightly better. ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement is a genuine challenge. Level depth seems better. Power up attacks and counter attacks (learned later in game) are welcome additions.  Variety among costumes, their abilities, focuses, and purchaseable upgrades. Candy wasn't so plentiful like the first game that I naturally had enough candy by the end to buy all creepy treats - A welcome challenge.  Maps are nice, and their counters for costume pieces & secrets are very helpful tips.

Cons:
New additions to the game make it way easier outside of Hardcorn Mode. Time travel story is a little more convoluted than the story from the first game.  Creepy treats are now special attacks, and they're either consumables or attacks you can reuse after a certain number of battles (can't spell ""Con"" without convoluted).  Maps cost way less than creepy treats.  A faint dark translucent horizontal line appeared on most levels throughout the game when navigating on foot - Does not appear in any other game of mine.

Costume Quest 2 is exactly the same thing, but slightly worse.  
  
[b]Graphics & sound[/b]
Not much has happened in the graphics department since Costume Quest 1. If you play the games back to back, you might notice some differences, but to me, who played them a few years apart., the two games look very similar. 
The game has an intentionally simple graphics style, with cartoonish looking characters. It works quite well, considering the game is a lighthearted game about a bunch of kids who have to save the world on Halloween, and it helps set the tone for the game.  
Outside of combat, most animations are very simple, but they get the job done. The simple animations never actually clash with the game, nor do they look out of place. In combat animations are more intricate, while still keeping with the overall simple tone of the game. In particular the main character animations look quite good. The models are also more detailed in combat and despite how different the models look, the art style still always feel consistent.  
  As far as sound goes, the game fares a bit worse. None of the music is particularly memorable, and the sound effects range from alright to downright annoying. I ended up not using certain costumes due to their annoying sound effects (the clown costume in particular was bad in this regard).

[b]Story & setting[/b]
It's Halloween and an evil time-traveling dentist has ruined everything by banning costumes & candy. It's up to two kids to save Halloween and by extension the world from being boring. Or at least a specific city from being boring on Halloween, the game is not entirely clear on the details. With such an outlandish plot it's surprising to see how little they actually do with it. There are some funny moments, but mostly of the game seems to focus on tedious busywork rather than on the story itself. You visit some different time periods, but while they have a different coat of paint, not much seem to change. Had the game focused on actually telling the story of how Halloween was ruined rather than focusing on having you collect candy from houses no matter when or where you are, the game would have been a lot more interesting. Basically, it feels like Double Fine were unwilling to commit to the story they had created, and they just padded it with things that ended up feeling only loosely related.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
If you've played the first game, you'll know how this game works. It's nigh identical. You move around and talk to people with WASD, and solve some simple puzzles, like many other games, and when you enter combat, it switches to a different perspective. Combat is turnbased and works very similar to Super Mario RPG, where you select what kind of attack you want to make, and if you time your button presses right, you deal additional damage. Each costume has a basic attack and a special attack that requires some buildup before it can be used.
Combat is tedious though. The combat animations are very long, which makes combat take far more time than it should, and there's no way of skipping regular attack animations, due to how you need to time your button presses. Combat is also very easy, which just makes fighting a chore. You're not going to lose, as long as you're paying a bit of attention to the game, it's just not going to happen. 
And while combat is easy, you'll also take a lot of unavoidable damage, so you're expected to go back and heal after every second battle or so, which just makes the game even more tedious. Luckily there are no random encounters, and as long as you stay within an area and don't reload the game, dead enemies stay dead.

[b]Final thoughts[/b]
Costume Quest 2 is a step back from the original Costume Quest. It keeps all of the flaws that the first game had, and introduces a few new ones. Tedious is the best word I can find to describe this game. It's also very bad at actually committing to its strange story, which makes it a lot less memorable than it should have been. Costume Quest 2 is by no means a terrible game, but it's not very good either.

Now we go to the sequel and see what‚Äôs new.

Story:
After the events of ‚ÄúGrubbin's on Ice‚Äù, our heros made it home on Halloween even though it was winter. While walking around, the twin's Wren and Reynold, find their dentist is up to something and with the help of a time wizard, gets a talisman that lets him unleash the monsters and gets Halloween. Confused, a time traveller finds them and tells the twins that the dentist has taken over and now you must go on an adventure to save future and Halloween.
This is a time travel story but you only go to two time periods(Bayou Past and Dystopia Future) but the time travel isn't that complicated. I don't much to about about the characters except for the villain, Orel White. This guy is such a delight when he's on screen and is properly one of the funniest villains I've seen in a while. 
I also like the dental theme empire that your explore. It's nice to have a fun take on a dystopia setting every now and then.

Gameplay:
The combat in the first game was repetitive as every fight was the same thing, over and over again. Here, the combat has improved greatly as now you can keep you special bars but you health doesn't refill after a fight. While most of the costumes you get are simply reskins of the ones from the last game, they now have different strengths and weakness to fight enemies which are: monster, magic and tech, and now the costume select shows what stats you'll get for each costume, AND the dash move can be used by everyone. While the all this make deciding costumes more flexible I must saw that Thomas Jefferson is almost essential to a party as he's one of the few costumes that's strong against tech.
Also, the cards you get in the last game gave been promoted to card you use in battle like one that gives you two moves, one that stuns all enemies or one that gives more exp. While I didn't use them much myself, they can be useful depending on what kind of party or stragey you want, although some take longer to recharge than others. I also noticed that every enemy was different as some can do special buffs or debuffs and some attack faster. A trowbog was a lot faster hitting me than a gubbin.
As for the stuff outside of battles, it's mainly the same as the first game, with similar side quest and similar trick or treating with a few minor differences, mainly in the second area.  Not much else to say.

Presentation:
Most of the character models are copy pasted from the last game along with new ones for the new monster types and they replaced the adult model with the one for the twin's parents and Dorsilla. I still think the fat people are adorable in this game. While the music isn't that memorable, the theme for the French Quarter is really catchy. There isn't that much great music so it really stands out.

Verdict:
Like every good squeal, it improves and expands on what didn't work or this case was tedious and made it a bit more challenging.

It follows the events of your crew consisting of brother, sister duo Reynold and Wren. However unlike the first, this one is beset with bugs, lag and lack the memorable aspects and charm of the prior game.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Cartoon aesthetic is still lovely and evokes a nice Saturday morning cartoon vibe.
+ Audio matches much like the first.
+ Story is good overall but I preferred the events of the first.
+ Battle system is improved a bit, now there are single turn double attack and defensive counter-attacks which reflect some damage to the enemy attacker.
+ Funny at times.
+ Combat requires you to master it otherwise combat will feel tedious at time.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Combat QTE feel like it has some lag as there was numerous times where I hit the QTE correctly but for some reason it failed to respond correctly. There's a fair chance you'll not make it out of the tutorial introducing the QTE combat mechanics.
- The new Creepy Cards system is disappointing, unneeded and can be ignored completely when compared to the Battle Stamps of the first. You can take 3 Cards into battle whereby you can spend a turn to use any one of your cards like consumables. Cards have various effects but the downside is that unlike your special meter it takes 3 battles until you can use that card again. Who thought this was a good idea; all it does is make me not want to you the system entirely.
- Certain Creepy Cards will work 100% of the time on normal enemies but will not on bosses whatsoever. Again, who thought this was a good idea. If you were to compare the Stamps from the first I could augment my costume build without any restrictions and it would work all the time but this just adds insult to injury to those who like the initial system.
- As like many games these days, bugs exist. There's this one bug where the QTE buttons failed to show up against certain enemies forcing me to eat a lot of damage as I couldn't mitigate the damage using the blocking system.
- A map exists but it doesn't indicate your position, lovely.
- Main menu is the most unintuitive menu I've ever had to use. Normally it's hit the Start Game button but here you've got to watch an intro scene which displays options controls or start game controls every time you wish to play. 
- You can't quit the game easily. Normally it's a simple process of hitting the quit button to either quit to the main menu or desktop. With this however, when you quit you're taken back to the unintuitive intro scene, before being presented with the main menu. So the only way to quit easily is to save your game and ALT + F4 out of the game. What nonsense is this?

[h1]Irritations[/h1]
+/- Reuses a lot of assets of the first.
+/- Doesn't really add anything new to the game. Most additions feel like it could've been DLC for the first.
+/- Quest are generally unchanged in their execution but feels really repetitive early on in your adventures. It's essentially the same talk to quest giver and go Trick or Treat on doors but it feels ways more repetitive as there's nothing else to do. 
+/- AI is dumb. I remember dying quite a few times in the CQ1, but with this one, unless I made a mistake or the game failed to register a QTE I'll not die but that could also be attributed to me knowing the system now.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
For some reason this game feels like a cash grab which saw to cash in on the popularity of the first one without really addressing its flaws. Instead of issues being resolved from the first we're met with those same issues and new ones to boot. At 3+ hours I got bored of the tedium and constant repetition and unlike the first this one feels like it has little to no charm and loses my attention quite early. 

I really enjoyed the first game it had charm, endearing story, simplicity in its systems which still had a certain level of depth. This on the other hand feels like the complete opposite. It doesn't improve on any of the original's ideas, it adds new but buggy systems, restricts prior systems and to me that's the worst kind of sequel but it's not terrible. So even though I'm recommending this do note that it has problems.",1475088058,1475253613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's hard to believe someone at Double Fine didn't see the problem here, but I'm guessing they knew it was a bad design choice but were more afraid of being accused of releasing a short game than a tedious one since people that play games would rather slog through garbage for dozen of hours than have fun for a few.

Even the writing in the bit I played didn't seem as fun as the original, and even exiting the game is strangely tedious if you don't force quit out of it.

Ich muss wirklich sagen, als gro√üer Fan des ersten Teils waren meine Erwartungen an die Fortsetzung hoch. Leider wurden diese sehr entt√§uscht. Generell ist Costume Quest 2 kein schlechtes Spiel und einiger der neuen Elemente finde ich sogar ganz gut, (das gliden funktioniert jetzt auch ohne Roboterkost√ºm) nur kann ich √ºber die schlechten Dinge nicht hinwegsehen (man muss sich nach K√§mpfen an Brunnen wieder heilen).

Wenn man wie ich den ersten Teil gespielt und liebgewonnen hat, findet man das neue Kampfsystem in dem Punkt gut, das es nicht mehr wie ein Quicktime Event wirkt, sondern jetzt jeder Charakter einen festgelegten Button zur Benutzung hat. Dadurch wirken die Attacken jetzt fl√ºssiger und man verbockt nicht hin und wieder das Blocken der gegnerischen Attacken. Was mich allerdings am neuen Kampfsystem st√∂rt ist die Tatsache das ich im richtigen Moment die Taste dr√ºcken muss damit etwas Wumms reinkommt. Man kann im weitern Spielverlauf noch etwas dazulernen (Kombo & Gegenangriff ), das t√§uscht aber nicht √ºber die M√§ngel des neuen Kampfsystems hinweg.

Bleiben wir noch ein wenig beim Kampfsystem. Die Kampfmarken aus dem ersten Teil sind auch wieder dabei, nur leider wurde das auch neu umgesetzt. Man r√ºstet √ºber das Men√º vor dem Kampf seine Karten wieder aus. Neu umgesetzt ist allerdings das es keinen ""passiven"" Boni mehr gibt, sondern die Karten im Kampf gespielt werden m√ºssen. Das Ergebniss sieht dann so aus das Karten dann f√ºr einige Runden wieder aufgeladen werden m√ºssen und somit ihren Zweck f√ºr mich verlieren. 

Die Grafik sieht gegen√ºber seinem Vorg√§nger aufpoliert aus, nur leider verliert es dadurch ein wenig an seinem Comic Charme. Costume Quest 2 kommt wie der Vorg√§nger auch wieder ohne Sprachausgabe daher, was einem mal wieder dazu bringt Gespr√§che mitzulesen (als RPG Spieler ist man das ja gew√∂hnt). Der Sound und die Musik passen sich dem Setting in dem wir unterwegs sind, und da gibt es auch f√ºr mich nichts zu meckern.

Ich w√ºrde dem Spiel gerne einen Daumen rauf geben, nur kann ich das nicht weil die Neuerungen einfach das Spiel runterziehen.",1468408964,1468408964,False,2,0,0.474440902471542358,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Costume Quest

[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]
The gang is out collecting candy again, but with a twist. Time travel and an evil dentist has cause the end of halloween as we know it. You now must time travel to prevent it.

[u][b]The Good[/b][/u]
Same adorable style of graphics and humor as the original. The level designs are much more interesting this time around. The objectives are a bit more interesting along with use of costume powers to traverse the level or solve small puzzle situations. The use of cards that give combat advantages.

[u][b]The Bad[/b][/u]
Even though the combat should be more interesting with timed button presses forcing you to stay involved it ends up just being annoying. The cards are great, but the actual abilities don't seem as interesting or balanced as the original.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
It's a great game if you loved the original. If you didn't like the first one you won't like this one. It doesn't really evolve enough to be called anything beyond an extension of the original.

This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters & setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.

As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control & others are defensive. It may sound unique & interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal & damage battle over.

‚Ä¢    Au√üerdem hat man, sinnfreierer Weise, noch zus√§tzlich Heilbrunnen aufgestellt. Sehr nervig wenn man jedesmal
einen Brunnen suchen muss um die HP zu regenerieren.

La f√™te d'Halloween est en danger car le mal√©fique dentiste Dr. Orel White a pactis√© avec un magicien du temps pour retourner dans le pass√© et supprimer tous les bonbons ! Les enfants sont bien d√©cid√©s √† ne pas se laisser faire et ayant √©chou√© √† stopper le dentiste dans le pass√©, ils sautent dans un portail temporel qui les am√®ne vers un futur dystopique o√π les bonbons sont interdits et o√π les robots dentaires patrouillent les rues. Avec l'aide de Lucy et Everett, leurs amis d√©sormais adultes, ils devront trouver un moyen de repartir dans le pass√© pour arr√™ter le petit Orel White avant qu'il ne soit trop tard ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600359663 Costume Quest 2 est la suite directe du DLC Larvins sur Glace qui √©tait fourni gratuitement avec le premier opus. Si vous avez appr√©ci√© le d√©but des aventures de Wren, Reynold et leurs amis, vous devriez retrouver votre compte avec cette suite mais certains changement et ajouts pourraient vous d√©concerter, voire vous d√©cevoir. Et cela commence par le syst√®me de combat.

La question est : pourquoi changer une recette qui marche ? Dans le premier opus de la s√©rie, les combats fonctionnaient avec des QTE et c'est toujours le cas, mais ici nous n'avons droit qu'√† des QTE tim√©s. Oui il y en avait dans Costume Quest premier du nom mais c'√©tait plus diversifi√©, parfois on devait appuyer sur un bouton au bon moment, d'autres fois faire preuve de dext√©rit√© avec des boutons √† marteler, tout d√©pendait du costume port√© par notre personnage. Bien qu'ils aient gagn√© en dynamisme, √† pr√©sent les combats sont encore plus r√©p√©titifs qu'ils ne l'√©taient d√©j√† et cela enl√®ve de la ""personnalit√©"" √† chaque costume. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599334448 Si on r√©ussit l'attaque on peut r√©-attaquer une seconde fois mais attention, le timing change et il faudra s'y habituer pour r√©ussir. Il y a toujours les attaques sp√©ciales pour couper √† la monotonie des combats et elles gardent quant √† elles un c√¥t√© humoristique bienvenu. 
Pour bloquer les attaques des ennemis, m√™me recette que pour le reste du combat : appuyer sur la touche correspondante au personnage en danger au bon moment. La seule nouveaut√© vient du fait que l'on peut d√©sormais contrer les attaques en maintenant la touche d'un des trois personnages, au hasard, en esp√©rant qu'on ait opt√© pour le bon, et rel√¢cher la touche au bon moment. C'est donc le jeu de hasard √† chaque fois.
La double-attaque, l'esquive et le contre sont des atouts qui ne nous seront pas donn√©s d√®s le d√©part, il faudra passer par quelques s√©ances d'entrainement au cours de l'aventure. Il est tout de m√™me dommage d'obtenir un ""booster"" de jauge d'attaque sp√©ciale uniquement vers la toute fin du jeu.

M√™me constat pour les timbres de combat. Mais si souvenez-vous c'√©taient de petits timbres que l'on attribuait √† nos personnages et qui conf√©raient un bonus en combat (plus de PV, r√©surrection, d√©g√¢ts sur les ennemis environnants...etc). Eh bien ces petits atouts qui permettaient aussi de personnaliser nos petits amis (quand on me dit ""RPG"" je m'attends √† un minimum de personnalisation) ont tout bonnement √©t√© remplac√©s par des cartes √† collectionner. Il est impossible de les attribuer directement √† un personnage, non, elles s'utilisent en plein combat et font par la m√™me occasion perdre un tour. Grrrr...

Aussi, les d√©veloppeurs ont cru bon d'ajouter un aspect dont on se serait pass√©s. En effet, apr√®s chaque combat on ne gu√©rit pas automatiquement et on [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599827554]devra se diriger vers une fontaine pour boire de l'eau et rebooster ses PV[/url]. Je ne comprends pas ce choix qui plut√¥t que d'ajouter de la difficult√©, ce qui √©tait peut-√™tre l'intention des d√©veloppeurs, ajoute surtout de la lourdeur au vu des allers-retours √† effectuer. 

Concernant les fameux costumes, on a droit √† une nouvelle panoplie qui redouble d'inventivit√© pour apporter du neuf par rapport √† ce qui avait d√©j√† √©t√© fait. On obtient entre autres le costume d'un clown qui permettra de redonner de la vie √† tous les alli√©s gr√¢ce √† son attaque sp√©ciale, le pharaon qui peut ressusciter un alli√© mort au combat, le magicien et son attaque foudroyante ou encore le loup-garou et son attaque griffue. Il n'y a rien √† redire √† ce niveau-l√† car on retrouve cette originalit√© et cet humour bon enfant qu'on avait appr√©ci√© avec Costume Quest 1. C'est toujours un plaisir d'obtenir un nouveau costume et de visualiser la transformation et les attaques qu'il permet d‚Äôex√©cuter. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600902955 Petite nouveaut√© : on peut am√©liorer nos costumes en achetant un objet aupr√®s d'un marchand chez qui on retrouve aussi les-dites cartes √† collectionner. L√† aussi, il n'y a qu'un objet par costume et il aurait peut-√™tre √©t√© sympathique de donner le choix entre plusieurs items qui apporteraient un bonus diff√©rent √† chaque fois histoire d'accentuer un peu le c√¥t√© RPG du titre. J'ai quand m√™me une petite r√©serve √† √©mettre sur les costumes car on en re√ßoit beaucoup sur la fin du jeu et on n'aura donc que peu de temps pour en profiter. Il aurait fallu mieux les r√©partir dans l'aventure car c'est quand m√™me l'atout majeur du jeu.

A nouveau le jeu est irr√©prochable au niveau de ses graphismes et de sa bande-son, je dirai m√™me que c'est le gage de qualit√© d'un jeu estampill√© ""Double Fine Productions"" car sur tous les jeux test√©s je n'ai jamais rien eu √† redire sur ces points-l√†. Les nouveaux d√©cors que nous allons visiter sont jolis, originaux et invitent toujours autant √† l'exploration pour r√©colter des bonbons et trouver des pi√®ces de costume. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600903119]La petite carte est bien pratique pour s'y retrouver et distinguer aupr√®s de quelles maisons il faut encore aller r√©clamer des bonbons tout comme pour savoir si on a d√©got√© tous les secrets du niveau[/url]. La bande-son emprunte quelques th√®mes au premier jeu mais loin d'√™tre un d√©faut, c'est un plaisir de les r√©entendre au vu de leur qualit√©. Petit b√©mol, car oui il y a toujours un b√©mol qui vient tout g√¢cher, j'ai fait l'exp√©rience, comme beaucoup d'autres joueurs de baisses de framerates fr√©quentes alors m√™me que la configuration n'est pas en cause. Tout va bien du c√¥t√© artistique mais il faudrait un peu revoir ses bases au niveau technique pour mieux optimiser ses jeux √† l'avenir, n'est-ce pas Double Fine ?

Au final, j'ai malgr√© tout beaucoup appr√©ci√© cette suite de Costume Quest et je ne la juge pas tellement plus mauvaise que le premier jeu. Il y a juste au niveau du gameplay que quelques choix hasardeux ont √©t√© op√©r√©s, probablement pour renouveler l'exp√©rience parce qu'il faut l'avouer c'est tout de m√™me tr√®s r√©p√©titif et si on a jou√© le premier il y a peu mieux vaut s'accorder une pause de plusieurs mois avant d'enchainer. Mis √† part ces quelques d√©fauts les fans y trouveront leur compte avec un nouveau sc√©nario bien ficel√©, des environnements soign√©s regorgeant de cachettes, une bande-son toujours au top et surtout de super costumes !

The Costume Quest games are unique little adventure titles that are sprinkled with RPG elements. Both games center around Halloween and, of course, the act of Trick-or-Treating. Costume Quest 2 picks up where its predecessor left off in terms of story, and it expands on all of the elements that players will be familiar with from the first game.

Without spoiling the main plot, I can say that you will take on the role of the brother/sister duo, Reynold and Wren. You will be tasked with regaining a talisman in order to save the world from a most disturbing fate of a candy-less future. Throughout the course of the game, you will have a few friends to accompany you on your journey; effectively turning your party from a duo to a trio. Having three party members comes in extremely handy across the numerous main and side quests that you will encounter. From knocking on doors to Trick-or-Treat and possibly running into enemies, to free roaming enemies, to helping find lost Hide n' Seek kids, the quests are enjoyably easy.

Each character is able to equip the various costumes that you will unlock whilst playing the game; from a wizard to a pharaoh, a clown and a werewolf, and many more. Each costume comes with its own unique attack, special ability, strength and weakness; all of which makes it essential that the player equips their party with the appropriate costume from area to area. You will earn experience points and candy (which is used as currency) after each battle. Candy can be spent on purchasing costume upgrades and special cards, which brings me to my next point.

The cards in this game act as battle stamps did in the original Costume Quest. If you never played that game, it's simply an extra element that introduces more factors into combat. Where one card can revive a player at 50% health, another card can cause a character to attack twice per turn. There are 45 in total, and you can equip 3 at a time; using them can often move a seemingly hopeless battle into your favor. There are some massively overpowered cards, such as one that will kill all minions, which cause the game to become rather easy at a certain point. However, the cards also have cool downs that expire after a set number of battles.

The soundtrack to this game is fantastic, and given that you rarely go back to previous areas the tunes just do not get old. The game mechanics are also extremely smooth, and the game itself runs at a stable 60 frames with no hitches. The graphics themselves are cute, fun and simple, and it's always exciting to see what your costume will look like in battle once you've unlocked a new one or have spent your candy on an upgrade for it.

Costume Quest 2 is an outstanding follow up to its debut title, in every way imaginable. Double Fine even put a few new elements into the combat system to give it a slightly fresher feel. The story is satisfying from start to finish, and it definitely doesn't let down its audience at the end. I highly recommend this game to fans of the original Costume Quest, or for anyone who is looking for a fresh, fun little adventure game that will last around 8-9 hours. Although I do suggest if you have not played Costume Quest 1, you pick that game up first so that you have more of an understanding of the story.

More costumes, more characters, more and bigger areas, and new abilities make the second Costume Quest huge, but not -too- huge.

Wren and Reynold return, but both their friends from the original Costume Quest are... otherwise occupied shortly after the start of the game. For some reason, the monsters from the first game return to wreak havoc, and it's up to the twins to find help from whomever they can to fix what's gone wrong. Time travel plays a large part in Costume Quest 2, as Reynold & Wren jump from period to period of their little town's history (and future), encountering new friends in each period that fill a rotating third party slot.

A few of the original game's costumes return, but only as a reward if you've finished the first Costume Quest (which, by the way, you should). Most everything you can wear this time around is new, save for the previously unusable Candy Corn. Yes, you can be Candy Corn. Yes, it's basically hard mode if you do so, as you're not going to get much more than life advice and inspiration from whomever wears it.

As mentioned before, the regions in Costume Quest 2 feel a bit more expansive than those in the first game, and are often sectioned off by ability or interaction sequence requirements. This occasionally leads to feeling a bit lost or concerns you may have missed something, but it's rare that you can't backtrack to pick up something you passed up earlier. In fact, there are several things in each time period that require traveling back to them toward the game's end to retrieve with new costume abilities you've retrieved.

Despite the increased cast size, the story in Costume Quest 2 is just as well told as that of its predecessor, if not more so. The stakes feel adequately raised along with the game's other improvements without feeling like a ridiculous leap, and nothing is left dangling once all is said and done. The combat has been streamlined even further, with a few new features added for variety, and the stamps from last time have been replaced by a more useful and inviting collectable card system for buffs.

Basically, it's Costume Quest 2, but better. Which is a good thing. Get this. Play this. Candy Corn for lyfe.

Granted, they also referenced Blazing Saddles at one point, which may have introduced some bias on my part: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zjCi_JH7dA",1452267284,1452267366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Costume Quest 2 is the sequel to costume quest and it is pretty apparent as the game is pretty much a reskin of the first game with some gameplay changes

Story
The game continues off of the DLC (I think) of the previous game where you have to go and free the future from an oppressive dentist while going through the past. It's a bit weird (But then again, so was the story of the first game). However, I think the first game had more charm. It was about halloween and monsters rather than time traveling dentist dystopias. Not bad but not really good either

Gameplay
It's been gutted and changed. You still only have one basic attack and one special attack. However, now it involves timing and your damage depends on how close you hit it to the indicator. You can also block and counter although they have their own disadvantages. The one thing that I really didn't like is that the status cards are no longer applied to characters. Instead, you have to play them in game (which wastes a turn). This turns down the amount of customization each characters has (which is already pretty low) and I wish they really didn't change it.

Graphics/Performance
The game ran at a smooth 60 with a 4790K, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram. It looks much better than the previous game (Especially the water reflections). When you zoom into a character, it looks a bit.. cartoony but that's just the play style.

Final thoughts.
Overall, it's basically part 2 of a game with a different combat engine. It wasn't bad but there is just so much freaking combat and it gets old really fast. I was just rushing through to finish it and didn't want to do the side quests like the first game. Play it if you really want to

Il primo titolo era carico d‚Äôatmosfera. Una ventata d‚Äôaria fresca nel mercato, grazie alla messa a schermo di un mondo governato dai problemi dei pi√π piccini, ma affrontato con intelligenza e con quella spensieratezza avulsa ormai alle grosse produzioni videoludiche. Le meccaniche d‚Äôispirazione jRpg‚Äî seppur non ricche di profondit√† ‚Äî facevano del titolo Double Fine un piacevole intrattenimento. 
Costume Quest 2 ci propone stavolta una storia che trae spunto da un elemento tipicamente sci-fi: il viaggio temporale, mantenendo sempre l‚Äôambientazione tipica della festivit√† anglosassone del 31 ottobre. Inoltre il titolo viene confezionato con un occhio di riguardo alla parte tecnica e grafica, ora pi√π curata.    

[b]Storia:[/b] ambientata subito dopo l‚Äôespansione, del primo capitolo, Grubbins on Ice. Vaghiamo nei meandri di un limbo ricco di portali, raggiunto in seguito al combattimento con Axaria. Il nemico stavolta √® meno ‚Äúspaventoso‚Äù, e veste i panni del Dott. White. Un dentista ‚Äî decisamente diverso dal Dott. Stu di una Notte da Leoni ‚Äî col pallino dell‚Äôigiene orale. Orel ha deciso di cancellare la Carie abolendo il rito del bottino dei dolciumi, e mandare in ginocchio l‚Äôindustria dolciaria. 
A noi l‚Äôarduo compito di ricalcare le orme di Marty McFly per impedire il disastro‚Ä¶

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 2 novit√†. La prima √® rappresentata dalle Figurine che sostituiscono i francobolli. Quindi niente Perk ma consumabili da lanciare in-game durante le battaglie. Ci sono comunque delle carte speciali da acquisire per potenziare le Skills base dei costumi, ma non sono dotate di potenziamenti trasferibili come nella prima interazione. 
La seconda novit√† √® costituita da mosse e contromosse da imparare nel corso dell‚Äôavventura presso il nostro maestro di combattimento.
Ritroviamo alcune missioni secondarie identiche, come il gioco del nascondino.
I combattimenti sono sempre a turni su un campo di battaglia idealmente suddiviso in 2. I nostri protagonisti contano ancora su meccaniche rette da semplici Q.T.E: un attacco base, una contromossa, e un contatore (legato al bimbo e non al costume) che va alimentandosi di turno in turno fino a rendere disponibile una mossa speciale (d‚Äôoffesa o di ripristino della salute). 
Ad accompagnarci ci sar√† anche un costume non in grado d‚Äôattaccare ma di sciorinare battute ironiche, che vi strapperanno in pi√π d‚Äôuna occasione una risata. Forse per√≤ sarebbe stato gradito un campionario pi√π robusto di frasi ‚Äî soprattutto in considerazione dell‚Äôachievement da sbloccare qualora decidiate di mantenere sempre nel vostro party Candy ‚Äî che si ripeteranno, ma √® un peccato veniale.
Anche stavolta: saremo chiamati al rischioso trick-or-treat; recupero dei pezzi per creare gli abiti (pi√π semplici da trovare); usare le importanti abilit√† di alcuni costumi durante la fase esplorativa ‚Äî con un concept tipico degli action-gdr isometrici ‚Äî per rendere accessibili alcuni passaggi della mappa, e irretire gli npc.

[b]I.A:[/b] le maggiori possibilit√† offerte al giocatore (carte, mosse, e contromosse) non sono stimolate da una tattica nemica ricalibrata sulle novit√†. Nel primo capitolo forse c‚Äôerano un paio di Boss Fight in cui imbastire una lieve strategia, tenendo conto delle abilit√† dei costumi per sfruttare il modo di combinare i vari perk: qui invece il livello degli scontri √® decisamente sbilanciato in nostro favore, basti pensare che si pu√≤ fare tranquillamente a meno dei nuovi power-up.
Certo, stavolta, non c‚Äô√® il recupero automatico della barra vitale, ma basta abbeverarsi presso le numerose fontane (o addentare qualche caramella) per ripristinare subito la salute della compagnia. 
L‚Äôunico modo per renderci la vita un po' complicata ‚Äî ma non migliora certo la scarsit√† di base dei pattern d‚Äôattacco nemici ‚Äî √® portarsi dietro Candy (che non attacca), riducendo il party offensivo a 2 elementi‚Ä¶ Ma comunque alla lunga i combattimenti risulteranno ripetitivi.

[b]Comparto grafico:[/b] sempre molto belle le animazioni dei costumi, sia quando prendono vita all‚Äôinizio dello scontro, sia durante l‚Äôespletazione delle mosse speciali. Il Mondo di gioco √® vario (un villaggio tipicamente del Sud degli States, una palude con alligatori, un quartiere d‚Äôispirazione francese, una distopica Repugia, degli incredibilmente affollati sotterranei‚Ä¶), e pi√π curato nei dettagli. Anche la paletta cromatica √® pi√π ricca nelle tonalit√†, rispetto al predecessore.

[b]Comparto tecnico:[/b] di nuovo il Cel-Shading, ancora un buon lavoro sul fronte ottimizzazione, con frame costanti e una richiesta hardware minimale. Sono presenti stavolta maggiori effetti speciali, texture pi√π rifinite, e particellari pi√π convincenti per l‚Äôacqua.

[b]Comparto audio:[/b] piacevoli i temi musicali, buona l‚Äôeffettistica. Il doppiaggio in inglese √® decisamente superiore alla versione italiana, che non riesce a restituire sempre la verve comica originale.

[b]Commento finale:[/b] Costume Quest 1 era magico. Un po' grezzo, ma alimentato da un‚Äôatmosfera tipica pi√π di un film d‚Äôavventura, con tematiche anche importanti. Questo secondo capitolo perde un pochino quello smalto, pi√π per essere arrivato cronologicamente dopo: non c‚Äô√® l‚Äôelemento novit√†, e le tematiche dei pi√π piccoli ora fanno da cornice (i mostri, le caramelle, i bulli‚Ä¶). La trama principale trae linfa vitale da un diverso spunto narrativo, invero anche efficace.
Se il primo titolo per√≤ riusciva a portare un imprinting narrativo ‚Äî sulla carta ‚Äî poco avvezzo ad un videogame, il secondo punta pi√π a migliorare quanto di buono fatto vedere in precedenza: ampliando il ventaglio dell‚Äôofferta videoludica, anche con meccaniche action senza tuttavia approfondire troppo; curando maggiormente i dettagli tecnici e grafici. 
E‚Äô un titolo caratteristico, ha una sua personalit√† e atmosfera, ma non riesce purtroppo a fare il salto di qualit√† che videoludicamente era lecito aspettarsi dopo la prima esperienza.

Just like the first game, if you love the classic turn based RPG's and comical adventures, then you should really enjoy this shorter game.

First off, the game continues immediately where the first games DLC ended. Literally starts at that cliffhanger ending. After you have saved Halloween and your friends, you enter a portal to return home but end up coming back a few months earlier. As you start Trick or Treating again you find out about a plot to get rid of the holiday and its costumes. So now you are on a quest to save Halloween again! Unfortunately, the game is really short. It is not too much bigger the the DLC. In my opinion, this would of been a great DLC instead of a sequel.

The levels in the game still have that incredibly detailed cartoonish feel. The level of detain in each area is outstanding. However, there are fewer locations and they are not as diverse. The look of the costumes all look much smoother and better detailed in combat. However, the costumes outside of combat do not look as ""horribly made"" as the first game. That was one of my favorite elements to the game. The horrible taped up costumes transforming into these colossal realistic versions.

Speaking of costumes, all the costumes you received in the first game are all gone. So you have to acquire a new set. This time around, the costumes are more traditional to the holiday. The superhero and candy corn are back but now there are costumes like ghosts, wolfman, clowns, etc. One of the changes made to this game is that the costumes can be upgraded to make them a bit more powerful.

Also changed is the combat. You no longer have different activations for each costume. Everyone has the same attack activation. However, they have assigned a specific button for each character. so the first character has to use button 1 for their moves and the others use button 2 and 3 respectively. From watching the trailer, you see that the combat is changed up a bit as well. You have to hit the button a the precise moment to do more damage. Later on this will be upgraded to give you two attacks. And the block will work that way as well, to include a counter attack. Stamps are gone from the game and cards are now introduced. The cards can be used in battle to give you character a boost or hurt your enemy. But they all have a cool-down timer that is about 3 fights (not rounds).

Other than that, the game is exactly like the first game. If you enjoyed the first and the DLC, then you should enjoy this little conclusion to the set.",1449057552,1449057552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Strongpoints:
-The story is simple but the details are intricate.The past causes correspond perfectly to the future ending.
-And one thing interesting about a time travel is that you have many  possibilities to reverse the whole story.
That inspires me to move on and hold on, though some quests & acheivements are miserable to complete.
-The graphic style just like CQ1,I like it very much.
-And I also love the music in CQ1&2.Whenever you guys release a soundtrack I will definitely buy one!
-Comparing to CQ1, this game makes NPCs much more alive &humorous.Alway enjoy talking with them!And quests need you to do that!Or you will miss some quests,espeically the solar system costume.

Shortcomings:
-Some quests & acheivements are miserable to complete.
-Sometime battle speed & waiting the door to open run slowly when I use my laptop to play it;
-Some costume are interesting,but others just look like those old ones in CQ1 with different surfaces.
-Can not avoid the repeated quest &story pattern in CQ1.The secrect's idea is new,but it is boring sometimes.
-It has a much more complex battle system&cards usage,so it takes me a lot of  time to get used to. But you don't have to use cards to win the final battle,so what's the meaning of cards?(except collection)

So here is what they did right Vs. What they did wrong.

The right

1. They kept it cute and charming.
2. The story is interesting.
3. The time travel mechanic was done well. 
4. Seeing the characters from past to future was clever. 
5. The new and old enemy designs are cool.
6. The new costumes were innovative and well thought out. 
7. Using Creepy Treat Cards for a benefit in battle was a good change of pace.
8. Certain enemies are stronger or weaker to different costumes. 

The Wrong

1. The change in battle style was unnecessary and was many times just difficult to use. 
2. The ending basically ret¬∑cons everything you do. Making what happened in the first one not even matter.
3. Only 3 of the Creepy treat cards are useful from my point of view. 

What they should have done.

If they changed the fight style the way it is with certain enemies being stronger or weaker to certain types of costumes. Then to balance it with the annoying combat style they should have made it to where you use a turn in the middle of battle to swap your costume. Similar to switching a party member in certain RPGs. 

Still this game took me about 9 hours to complete, it's not that expensive. Granted mine was a gift, and it's fun enough to replay. I give it 3.5 out 5",1446663770,1446663770,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you want to know about that one, I suggest you go read my review on it as a lot is similar.

Just like the first game, this is a wonderfully quirky game with so many jokes that I was frequently laughing out loud. In particular, the Candy Corn costume always made me giggle, despite reading the joke 50+ times. There was less meta-humour in this one than the first, but it was never boring.

The combat is very similar to the first, but improved overall. There is now only a single form of attack (compared to various QTE-styles in the first game), but they've added additional mechanics like countering that add another dimension to combat. They also added 'actor types' which are a basic form of strengths and weaknesses split between 3 classes; it sounds odd, but it's easy to understand and it adds a tactical edge.

Like with CQ1, however, I did tend to stick to the first costume you get and swap out the third as I went (the second was always Candy Corn for the achievement), but as the visuals are interesting and the cutscene moves are now skippable, that isn't too big an issue.

One issue I should mention is this game was very easy. I only failed perhaps two fights (and one was because of a glitch), but I did do some grinding in places for XP and candy (in-game currency). The boss fights were very straight forward and fit SO MUCH better into the flow of the game compared to the almost puzzle-like ones in CQ1.

The story is clever and moves on from the first with just enough nods and references to 1 to induce nostalgia. They would, however, go over the heads of anyone who hasn't played 1, so definitely play that before this. It is a sequel in every sense.

This was a fantastic game that kept all the good feelings I had for 1 and added to them, creating its own individual experience that fits beautifully into the Costume Quest universe.

You play the role of two twin siblings, Reynold and Wren.  The game follows on from the original game in the story and offers much of the same game play elements.  The game has been released on PS3, 360, PS4, Xbox One, WiiU and all of the PC platforms. 

Like I said, the gameplay is very much the same as the first game, you travel around in your party exploring the world and encounter enemies, which you battle in a turn based fight scene. These fight scenes have an essence of QTEs in them, so if you hit the button at exactly the right time, you'll either do more damage, or block more damage. As you venture throughout the game, you will discover new and interesting costumes to wear - each costume has its own special ability and unique style of play.  There is some real interesting costumes to find, my favorite is the Clown costume, which acts as your early game healer, but you also have tanky classes and damage dealing classes like in other RPG games. 

Graphically, Costume Quest 2 is identical to the original. The art style is beautiful though, I loved the stylized world that you are put in and all of the characters just look gorgeous.  The animation in cut scenes and in the game are second to none too.  The game is so well optimized that pretty much any rig can play this in its full glory. 

The plot is similar to the first game too; you are out to stop Dr. Orel White who has taken over the world and aims to bring an end to the holiday, Halloween! Obviously being the candy loving kids we all are, we can't let that happen and you must stop him.  With an element of time travel to be seen, there is some very interesting plot points throughout the game, and this comes with the inclusion of some brilliantly comical moments along the way too. 

Sadly the game is not voice acted - for me I was hoping it would be given how popular the first game was, but this doesn't take away any of the charm the game has. You can pretty much imagine how each of the characters in the game would sound, and the animation of them all with the facial expressions aids this ten fold too. 

Costume Quest 2 has moments of difficulty; some of the quests are not easily figured out and you have to put a bit of thought into them, or working out where to go next in order to progress the game. Not to mention the boss battles can also get quite intensive too; I actually had to spend a fair amount of time grinding my characters up a few levels just so they were on par with the difficulty of the bosses I was facing. This is by no means a bad thing as with each fight you win, you also get the chance to win a card, which will have a unique effect that you can use in a battle, such as avoiding attacks, doing double damage, or sometimes actually out right killing an enemy no questions asked!

That brings me onto the level design, every single level in Costume Quest has absolutely tons of areas to explore and items to find. You have to destroy typical game world items in order to find the games currency, candy. The candy can the be spent at the vendors which are scattered around the world to purchase costume upgrades, or the above mentioned special effect cards. Each level also has a handful of side quests which you can complete, granting further experience points and candy as rewards. I would recommend people actually focus on the side quests before progressing in the main quest just so you keep up at the right level compared to the enemies. Some of the side quests are linked to the main quest; but a lot can be skipped over if you really want to. 

A full playthrough with completing the majority of the side quests at a leisurely pace took me just under nine hours to complete which is actually a bit of a jump in length compared to the original which only took me five hours to finish. Again though, there is no reason at all to play through Costume Quest 2 for a second time apart from maybe mopping up a few achievements if that's your jam. Much like the first, I would really of liked to have seen a ""New Game+"" mode just to squeeze a couple more hours out of it, and maybe introducing local co-op too, that would be an almost perfect addition given that you play as twins the whole way through the game. 

I had virtually no technical issues in my run through. I was able to play at 4K resolution with a steady 60 FPS the whole time. I did run into a few bugs where you could actually walk through some walls when interacting with items on the other side of the wall such as ladders and chests, but there are no real game breaking bugs to be found. I played the game with a controller given the amount of QTEs in the game, I felt that would be a better option, but this can just as easily be played with keyboard and mouse too. 

To sum up, I think Costume Quest 2 does exactly the same as the Costume Quest just bigger and better. I can only hope that there is going to be a third game in this series as it just gets better and better with each release. I will go as far to say this is one of my favorite games I have played this year so it gets a strong recommendation from me!

It's hard to review this without the caveat ""but if you're a kid"".
If you're a kid, probably all the design decisions in this game make sense.
However, if you're over 7, you're going to feel pretty frustrated at times.

I would have no problem recommending this to any of my nephews.
But given that a greater part of the audience is older, and it wouldn't've taken much to accomodate that (a difficulty level selector, for starters), it's definitely not without shortcomings.

First up, the good:
* better than the original - more nuanced battles (once you get further in), better mechanics, the cards are actually fun and exciting to use
* great atmosphere - if you like double-fine's style, this is their best ""feel""-wise since Psychonauts, and feels a little similar to grim fandango at points
* better use of costumes - this time, only certain costumes can perform certain actions, and the game takes on shades of (albiet very easy) adventure games - which is great
* Great humour
* Great and innovative level design
* fun!!!

Now, the annoying:
* some random-as cards - ""peanut butter bombs"" is basically a ""win this battle"" card. Really weird.
* Bad keyboard choices for PC. Holding WASD direction keys in tandem with 'Q' (required for certain portions of the game) results in stuck keyboard errors on most PS2 keyboards. Not to mention it gets a bit cramped getting your hands in there like that.
* Mouse support is bizarre, and terrible. You can either use mouse or keyboard on the menus, but using mouse, for example, on the creepy cards menu results in weird glitchy selection.
* Inconsistent keyboard use. Depending on the menu/area of game you're in, 'returning' can either be 'esc', 'q', or space. There is no way around this. Also, regardless of how you've set up your keys, the arrow buttons will be used for certain menu actions.


And the bad:

* respawning. Monsters respawn when you leave a level/game, meaning you can basically grind for candy, making getting 'all the stuff' not strategic, but basically boring. Certain candy-hit items like letterboxes etc also respawn their candy. This took away from  the game in a big way, including leaving the player without a feeling of progression.
* no difficulty selection - the game presents little challenge - which is a shame due to the amount of mechanics thrown into the combat
* ridiculously easy end boss


To fix this game they would need to tweak their PC version a little more, throw in a difficulty selection at the start of a game, and basically get rid of the respawning monsters. Then it might actually be worth getting that really cool Creepy card, just to win that final battle.

The only thing I don't like about this one are the timed attacks in combat. It reminds me of Super Mario rpg and that was about the only thing I didn't like in that game. It's fine though I guess but one other thing that bothers me is that combat takes a long time because you have a follow up attack on each attack that you can do, enemies have a lot of hp, and all attacks from you and the enemies take longer than in most games. Although I wish combat was quicker, it isn't too bad, especially since this is the type of game you only ever really play through once. I like the first game better because it seemed like it had more detail to the story and the world. This one seems to be a toned down version of the game, but it is still a fun game in its own right. Some of the reviews I've seen didn't like this game for whatever reason but like I said its basically about the same formula as the first one.

The few adjustments that have been made are of little but if you enjoyed Costume Quest and wanted more of the same, you'll enjoy this. 

The story in Costume Quest 2 revolves around a group of kids who must use time travel to deal with the results of a obsessed mother with keeping her son's teeth in perfect condition and with that you will save Halloween. In order to complete this, you will have to knock on doors, jump here and there, grab some costumes part to make a full costume. 

The combat system is the same as in Costume Quest, the only difference is now you can block easily, counter, a nice upgrade here. Still there is one annoying thing that they haven't fix yet, the fact you can't speed up the QTE and battle, trust me you will have to battle LOT and battle are bit slow, this would help a ton. 

Overall, good game if you enjoyed the first one you will most likely enjoy this one, but bare in mind is semi DLC.

In some ways it's a little disappointing that this is so close to the original game. Combat is a little bit better and the treats cards are more useful but overall exactly the same as the first game. The format of going to different areas and trick or treating is the same as well but I find it very fun and don't mind it at all. Also, I'm a little surprised that the game didn't expand into new territory in terms of holiday themes. The first game was obviously Fall but the DLC Grubbins on Ice was set in the Winter and had Christmas themes and references. So I expected this to continue that theme and have Spring themes or Easter references, something like that but instead it returns to the original Halloween Fall theme. Which makes a lot of sense I suppose since it is the original premise for the game and where most of the themes come from.

That said though, when the game was starting I was sort of disappointed in the way it looked like the story was being set up. A dentist wants to end Halloween and make candy illegal so everyone can have clean teeth so it's up to the kids to save Halloween. Are you kidding me? That's the most cliched holiday plot I've ever heard. So, I had a bad taste in my mouth starting out. However, I was really won over. The writing is very good. The side quests have really good plots and are fun to do and everything about the cliched main storyline ending up being better than I expected. The evil dentist ends up being a very tragic figure and ends up having a great character arc.

Gameplay-wise, Costume Quest 2 doesn't differ that much from the first game's formula, but manages to tweak several elements along the way. The combat is the feature that recived the greatest overhaul: while the whole turn-based RPG fare with QTEs for extra damage is still there, now the health of the characters doesn't refill itself after combat (forcing you to visit fountains scatterd in the areas or consume a stock of candy to heal up), your attacks can either be nice or amazing and dish out damage accordingly regarding when precisely you press the attack button, you can defend yourself and try to counterattack via QTEs, chains of attacks are available and enemies tend to hurt a bit more and some will respawn to free roam the streets again. The sequel also introduces three classes for enemies and costumes alike, Tech, Wizard and Monster: there is a little weakness/resistance system going on between each to put some emphasis on gear and target choice. Finally, this time around  you can actually buy upgrades for your costume, which either empower the character's attacks or add some useful side effects. While these novelties make the first encounters you'll face very challenging and requiring some demanding good timing, as you progress through Costume Quest 2 and gain the roughly ten levels there are to get you'll become more and more powerful and get used to the QTEs general flow, to the point of making most of the battles trivial (the bosses in this game are especially disappointing because, unlike the first game, they don't display any unique gimmick and all boil down to a very easy dps race).

Aside from the combat, eveything you left in Costume Quest returns in the sequel as you'd expect: in the roughly three main areas you'll visit in the second game there a lot of doors to knock on for trick or treating, obstacles to overcome with the right costume, collectable cards that give you a pletora of effects in combat and a huge crowd of NPCs to interact with. The writing is still funny and charming as you remembered.

The game didn‚Äòt change much. The core is the same. Simple rpg mechanics, collecting candies, leveling up, collecting new costumes to become a three-headed hotdog. 

The combat system changed a little, you now need to press a button when attacking to do more damage and same goes for defending ‚Äì press the button in time to receive less damage. And there‚Äòs fountains where you can restore your health after the fights. I heard people complaining about it, but i don‚Äòt see the problem here, fountains are always close to you, it‚Äòs easy to go and refill you hp.

Double fine has done a fine job here. Costume quest 3 next halloween maybe?

The super secret is kinda neat and you'll feel pretty awesome if you figure it out yourself. 

The overall story was short (I did 1 playthrough, and got everything in that one playthrough and did it in 9 hours) but was well written and funny.

You don't have the different attack meters anymore, the cards you get need to be activated during the battle and do not give passive bonuses, you should heal after every fight (either with a ability or the fountain which caused me to run back to the fountain all the time).

Cute, fun and now a bit more challenging. I played the game twice because I realize there was an achievement to finish through the whole game with one of your party members wearing the candycorn costume, which is a bit more challenging.

The story takes place immediately after the first game (not gonna go any further discussion about the story because I dun want to give spoilers), though I have to say they could have a little bit more depth to the story. The whole game is almost the same to the first one, but with a number of additional gimmicks and changes:

1) All the characters now have the same button prompt unlike the previous game where they all have a variety of it;
2) You can now attack again after a successful attack, and also there are levels of damage depending on your timing;
3) You can now defend and counter;
4) Once you flee, you will teleport auto-matically to a healing-well-thingy, which follow up to my next point...
5) You can now heal and save at a healing-well-drinking-thingy, not a ignorant police phone booth;
6) You will have a lot of cards to use in battle to act as an battle-equalizer, because the fights are a lot harder than the first game
7) You can now move faster in any costume, unlike the first game which is the ability for the robot costume;
8) Costumes and enemies now have effectiveness typing, kinda like rock scissors paper. They are Monster, Magic and Mech types. 

Thats all the things I can think of for now.

The game is now more challenging, which is good. The characters are still adorable and lovable, and the attack prompts in battle feels more respondsive. The main menu though, I wish they would just stick to the simple looking menu rather than what it is now, but oh well. Overall not bad for a sequal.

I never really did Halloween when I was a kid. I‚Äôm one of those killjoys who rolls her eyes at the Halloween decorations the shops insist on trotting out and flogging to a mostly disinterested British audience every year. I managed to work my way through my formative years without it playing any part in my yearly routine. I never went trick or treating, or ‚Äòglorified begging‚Äô as I was told it was. I‚Äôve never really done fancy dress in any big way either. In fact I‚Äôve probably put more effort into making costumes for my hedgehog soft toys than I have for myself. Costume Quest 2 lets me precariously live out my repressed need to threaten strangers into giving me sweets and dress up in increasingly deranged outfits whilst hitting monsters, which I assume is standard Halloween behaviour for those inclined.

Costume Quest was a game that impressed me immensely. It was simple in places but filled with all the wonderful charm and wit that Double Fine have built their reputation on. Like Psychonauts (another game I love), Costume Quest is a game about being a kid, doing kid stuff and seeing the world in a fantastical way that the adults around them just cannot do. It‚Äôs silly and quirky without coming across as pandering or dumbed down. On the contrary, Costume Quest had some really clever writing. Despite my Halloween-cynicism, I was strangely excited about the prospect of Costume Quest 2 (especially after seeing the wonderful announcement trailer).

After stopping monsters stealing all the Halloween candy, brother and sister team Wren and Reynold are preparing to finally enjoy some trick or treating Halloween fun. But would you believe it, an evil dentist has changed history to outlaw the festival. The simple premise belies the sharpness of the writing and the sheer joy of finding all the gags and japes the game has to offer. There is always something happening on screen, be it a quick one liner or a visual gag going on in the background. It seems there is no wasted space in the game world, everything has a purpose. I adored the art style that lead designer Tasha Harris gave the first game, I‚Äôm very pleased to see that the sequel has added to it in the best way, keeping the style consistent as new characters are introduced and fresh costumes take centre stage. The game looks brilliant, being so full of colour and life as it is with some well thought out areas to explore. 

It plays almost exactly as its predecessor. Costume Quest was never the most challenging of games in terms of gameplay, which is fair, not every game needs to be a hardcore l33t ultra noob-smasher pain-a-thon. I always enjoyed the gentler style Costume Quest took but it would have been nice to have the sequel mix things up a bit more to stop it becoming too repetitive or overly familiar. Very little has changed. The meat of the game is divided betwixt two scenarios; knocking on doors to trick or treat and seeing if you get candy or a fight, and then there is the fighting. It‚Äôs not a bad system but one that gets a bit too predictable the longer the game goes on. The fighting in particular runs close to becoming tedious after a while. Two parties line up and take turns hitting each other until one party has lost all its health points, it‚Äôs a time honoured system but one that wears itself pretty thin when it‚Äôs limited to a few characters with the same moves and little involvement from the player. 

The combat system has had a bit of tweaking though. The button timing mechanic for attacking opponents has been streamlined slightly to make it more consistent over the various costumes and there is a more effective block/counter-attack move to be learned. However you‚Äôll be performing the same actions so many times in combat you become numb to them. The joy of seeing the kids you play as transform into literal representations of their costumes and fight giant monsters or robots loses its impact after the hundredth fight or so. The special moves your characters can use are amusing (the clown‚Äôs ‚Äòlaughter is the best medicine‚Äô is my favourite), but even they become tiresome the more you see them. There are some enemies that certain costumes are stronger or weaker against, but I never found myself needing to worry about it so much and just used the costumes I liked best or had upgraded most recently. You also need to heal your party after fights otherwise damage taken rolls over to the next battle, but even this was never an issue I needed to adjust my tactics for. You can just eat some candy at any point to replenish health or visit a water fountain. 

In the end, combat started to become the tedious bits in between the story and exploring. As slight as the fetch quests and trick or treating that make up the bulk of the non-fighting sections are, I still did it all with a big grin on my face. The world is just so cute and charming that I was irresistibly compelled to play on and poke my nose into every little corner of the game. The story was enjoyably bizarre and presented well (it follows on directly from the CQ1 DLC, Grubbins on Ice). It‚Äôs frequently very funny and features a twist that had me giggling so much I dropped my controller. I spent a silly amount of time running around being a jerk honking a loud clown horn in people‚Äôs face, trying to initiate diplomatic talks with everyone and hitting alligators with candy buckets. That this is a game that encourages such childishness can only be a good thing in my opinion. 

It may not be for everyone, but if you‚Äôre after a game that captures the child like glee of getting caught up in an insane festival, then Costume Quest 2 may be for you. It doesn‚Äôt do anything that its forbearer didn‚Äôt do, but it‚Äôs a game that boasts buckets full of wit and an incredibly adorable outlook that‚Äôs hard to dislike. After all, if it can make stone-hearted me appreciate Halloween in anyway, it has to be onto something.

You start out the whole game with no idea what the plot is but all the characters know. You never get the backstory of some of the people.

The battle play was dumbed down and is now pretty boring. I don't need to pay attention because each character has one button and the attack never changes. The first game used different buttons and you had to remember what move on  your buttons went with what attack and which character. 

The creepy cards are obnoxious. They don't always clearly state how long they last and the whole 'wait two battles!' is pointless. I can just replace the card. The battle stamps were much better thought out. 

Also. This is just a little pet peeve but there isn't anyway to skip the cutscenes Before every. flippin. battle. I'm getting real sick of watching Wren turn into a clown. -_-

They oversimplified the battle system, requiring only one button and the same ""time your attack"" mechanic. The dumb aspect is that they mapped each character to a different button, which is completely pointless. A lot of the new costumes are cool, but they share a lot of the same abilities from the first game. I didn't preorder so I didn't get the DLC bonus costumes, but no worry. They're ones you already played in the first game and you'll probably prefer the new ones anyways. I liked how the 3rd child in your party was changing throughout the game.

It had it's problems as the new combat system was a lot harder for me to pull off at first (It took forever to master the first combo) but over all I really liked it. 

I definitely recommend it if you are a fan of the first game, because it still has the same feel and charm, along with a really engaging story.

While I'm sad there were only two main areas instead of the first games three I really love all the design that was put into these areas.

Now I wasn't sure about the changes at first but I did like a lot of them in the end

Attacks and blocking was a LOT easier to pull off once I got used to them and it was a lot better to pull off then in the first game where the buttons would be unreadable sometimes.

I'm also kind of sad that they got rid of battle stamps but the creepy treat cards were a nice replacement as they were really useful and fun (Morons is seriously the best card for boss battles)

I had some issues with the game, but in the end I don't care because I really enjoyed this game.

I even put in the effort to get all of the achievements except for the candy corn one which... I'll probably attempt some other time when I feel more comfortable with the idea >>

I played through the entire game in about 6 hours, with my girlfriend playing the WiiU version at the same time.

Because of this, and the somewhat ""floaty"" controls (at least in the PC version, with xbox 360 controller), the game doesn't feel like it had all it's bugs squashed. Some things could be a be ""tighter"", but doesn't really detract from the game's playability.

The platform costume exclusives (PS3/Steam pre-order) are annoying. Give me the option to buy them as DLC, I don't care; I'll buy them. Just give me the option.

CQ2 is roughly the same length as CQ1. It's also roughly as hilarious and fun. I laughed out loud so many times during this game.

I think this is a good sequel to the first Costume Quest + Grubbins on Ice, so far from what I played. 

+ Great follow-up to the cute-sy story the series has, along with excellent and consistent writing on-par with the first game
+ While time-travel can be a cliche, it can be seen as a fitting trope for the game (that is if you played the GoI epilogue)
+ While battle stamps were removed, creepy treat cards now take its place in a much more practical way


- Optimization needs work, it's harsher on the CPU than the first game
- Combat is dumbed down and less varied, and some the QTEs don't register from time to time

If you don't, I don't care, I'll just change into an actual superhero and beat the candy out of you, you creepy monster!

If you've played the first Costume Quest, then you know exactly what you're in for- kids beating the crud out of monsters for halloween candy.  But this time... there's more to it than just ""the bad monsters want to steal away our candy"".  Nope, this time, there's a new villain in town... the one person who has more reason to hate candy than any one other person in the whole city...

...the creepy local dentist.  

In fact, he hates it so much that he's somehow managed to make it to where Halloween, candy, and costumes are crimes against his order, and he's recruited the Repugians to help enforce his views.  It's up to Wren and Reynold to put a stop to it, and save Halloween for future generations.

To be quite honest, this is just as good as the first one- battles are a tad bit more complicated with a bit of Pokemon-style type weakness mixed in, but you'll pick up on that easily enough.  Stickers are also gone, replaced with Creepy Treats cards that recharge after a certain number of battles.  The automatic healing after every battle has been removed too- but it's not as terrible as it sounds, honestly.  You either need to camp out around a water fountain to keep healed, or finally put that candy to more use than just as a currency- you can fully heal your party for 25 pieces of candy, or use it to buy upgrades and cards.

To be honest, the new costumes you get in this one may not be as powerful as some of the originals- for instance, the Unicorn's My Pretty Panacea special is still brokenly powerful compared to the revive you get without the preorder- but the right combinations are still very, very powerful.  

Enemies are no longer a finite resource- there are respawning enemies in all the areas of the game in addition to the ones in the usual places, so if you just feel like sitting somewhere and grinding levels, you can do that, too.  To be honest, though, you don't need a super-high level to beat the game- I finished it around level 9, with the Hardcorn achievement, even.

Some of the late-game random encounters need a specific strategy- you'll run into a group that can drop a group heal every turn, if they so choose, and if you don't destroy them in a specific order, they'll tear you apart.

It might need a little balancing in the late game, but overall, if you have the first one, you can expect more of the same fun that was in the first one- or you could just outright buy the first one as well and play through that if you want to!  If you didn't play the first one, that's still fine- you might not understand some of the story elements, but you'll like the great gameplay and all the fun!",1414134710,1414134710,True,38,5,0.788829386234283447,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This sequel is basically ""more of the same"", but it's a missing a little of the nice touches of the first. The battles have been tweaked a little, but are still very simple and basically still a matter of choosing the target and timing the QTEs. There are reusable cards for effects the special actions, but in-depth combat is not what this series is known for.

Emphasis on ""[b]nice[/b]' and ""[u]Good[/u]"", not outstanding (like the original). 

If you liked the first game, you will probably find this one good too...

Having played the first for the first time soon before playing Costume Quest 2, I can say that the first game had a lot more charm and better writing and attention to detail. The story seems less Halloween-centric even though it says it is, it loses some spirit trying to add scale. The sequel also relies on hints, tells, and story elements that are very dependent on the first game making it feel like it cant stand on its own.

Costume Quest 2 feels like the DLC for Costume Quest 1 did, sorta tacked together in the same world but not as much heart or attention put in it, its the little things that seemed to be missed or stand out, unlike the original (I'm not talking graphics persee)

I truly feel something was lost, I chuckled or smiled a bit in Costume Quest 2, but I played Costume Quest not a week before, and I was smiling and laughing my butt off. It just felt drawn out after a while, and a great example of this, compared to the last fights of Costume Quest 1, which were awesome and funny and sorta epic, the last fight, heck most of the boss fights in 2 were sorta boring, leaving me pining for more.

That isn't to say Costume Quest 2 isn't good, they try to shake up the combat a bit and have different ways to power up your characters and it has many many many nods to the original game, almost to the point of head scratching at times. I think the game sorta took itself too seriously, even though it was also being ridiculous. Also, I can see they were trying to make the game ""more rewarding through skill"" but in so doing, they made the game dismally easy in the process.

I have a feeling, and this is my opinion, that this game may have been DLC for the original, based on the content (aka, the excessive reuse) I witnessed.

[b]All in all, the style and shading and detail has changed a little bit, subjectively to its detrement or benefit, and the game plays in a more active fashion than before, making the player react more during turns than the original. Engine wise and concept wise it actually has not greatly progressed from the original and I beat the game with a feeling that this was ""expanded DLC"" of the original, it uses and relies on the original too much to consider it as it's own game, really.

The original Costume Quest was one of my favorite games of all time, so the changes that were made to gameplay weren't all that welcome at first. As I played the game, though, and let go of my prejudice, I discovered a really great game with a cute story and some really cool mechanics. While I'm not sure it surpasses the first game, it does serve as a good continuation of the Costume Quest tale. While I may have gone into this game shy, I had grown to thoroughly love it by the end. I have a feeling I will be playing through it every Halloween along with the original and Grubbins on Ice, and I'm really happy to have it in my collection.

Pros:
+Really cute story, with well-written characters and an enjoyable story arc
+Picks up right where the first game and DLC leave off. The continuation feels nicely organic.
+Costume upgrades were a nice touch, both in how they improve the costumes and the physical changes that occur
+Classic Double Fine humor
+The musical score fits really well with the game, and functions better in places than the original in my opinion
+All characters can use the skate shoes now
+Some of the new costumes are simply fantastic
+Candy Corn

Neutral:
=The game can be short if you don't explore endlessly or grind for candy and experience
=The game bosses seem underwhelming compared to the first, and don't put up much of a challenge
=Somewhat requires you to have played the first game and the original DLC
=The new Paper Mario style combat is a wild departure from the first. I think I preferred the original combat as the different costumes required different combat quick time events, but the combo system in this version is welcome.

Cons:
-The new Creepy Treat card mechanic isn't as much fun for me as the old battle stamps
-You no longer auto-heal after combat, meaning you're always running back to a fountain to heal. There is an option to eat candy to heal instead, but it never seems worth the cost until after you've bought everything you can.

This is a nostalgia game for those who liked the first Costume Quest and is, therefore, highly recommended to them. 
Technically, it is a prequel/sequel, but favors the sequel side.


[u]Fine grained dissection:[/u]

Lots of cameos from the first game in the prequel section of this game, but they could've gone more in depth with the character backstories.

The sequel section of the game is more thoroughly explored and even has a fair amount of closure unlike the blatant cliff hanger at the end of the first Costume Quest. This, alone, makes it worth the buy, though maybe when it is on sale, if you can wait.

As for the execution of the game, it's visually stunning compared to the first Costume Quest, otherwise, it is very similar. There are many new worlds and costumes which are fantastic additions to the Costume Quest universe, but the battle system hasn't been changed so much as to be mind blowingly new.

[Begin battle system dissection] [Spoiler]Having that said, like some, I also hardly ever used the new Creepy Treat system (unless I was grinding for candy, even then, I only used the candy boosts) because it is not that relevant to the outcome of the battle. In fact, you essentially waste a turn using them.[/spoiler] [/end]

It is possible though not entirely necessary to grind for candy in this version, which can be...painful. Having Candy Corn battle will make or break the grind sessions. Near the end of the game, you get around [spoiler]200[/spoiler] pieces of candy per battle (more the higher your level), but the cost of things is so high that it is still classified as grinding.

There are still some mild bugs, such as cutscene transition speed-ups and quests occasionally breaking if you do not complete them in the right order, but it auto-saves so often that it is not a deal breaker.

[Begin ending dissection][spoiler]They went for an early Disney-esque ending where everybody is happy, but not everyone in the prequel side of the story was given complete closure. Nevertheless, the ending was vastly more concrete than the first Costume Quest, though it does leave a little wiggle room for something small, like DLC.[/spoiler][/end]",1413113646,1413114392,True,0,0,0.48267325758934021,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Many of the assest in Costume Quest 2 are reused from the first. Many of the villians are copied right from the first and changed ever so slighly, like giving one monster a lab coat, TADA!!!, totally a new mob. Another big downside is how worthless some of the costumes are. Many of them felt like they fit the same roles and it was pointless to switch out much besides in open world puzzles. For example the clown, pharaoh and the unicorn. The clown for the whole first half of the game beat the unicorn and Pharaoh by miles in the healing department. The Pharaoh, you get so late into the game, I no longer died and needed her resurrection heals. However after upgrading the unicorn, the clown become useless. The upgraded clowns AoE heal was = to the unicorns, but the unicorn also healed one extra party member for quite a bit more. The best part about Costume Quest 2 is the story. The humor in the game is spot on, and I loved all of the characters and how many jokes they fit in, for the kids and for the adults.

Le seul r√©el d√©faut par rapport au premier est la facilit√© des combats de boss, certes le jeu n'est pas sens√© √™tre diificile mais dans le CQ1, certains boss n√©cessitaient quand m√™me un minimum de strat√©gie et d'avoir une composition d'√©quipe plus ou moins efficace et synergique, ils √©taient beaucoup plus violents, l√† o√π dans CQ2, je me suis retrouv√© √† bourriner b√™tement sans prendre beaucoup de d√©g√¢ts dans la face √† part peut-√™tre pour le tout premier m√©chant. Il est vrai qu'on retrouve aussi moins le c√¥t√© ""Halloween"" vu qu'une grande partie de l'action se d√©roule dans un monde futuriste. 

Bref, si vous avez aim√© le premier, vous aimerez celui-ci, m√™me s'il ne r√©serve finalement pas beaucoup de surprises en terme de nouveaut√©s.

        [td]I really enjoyed this game and I enjoyed it more than the original Costume Quest. This game takes everything good about the original Costume Quest and improves it. The combat is more intense, theirs more costumes, more characters, and the story became more complex. This game also fix the issues from the last game by running at 60fps and by have a more satisfying ending. If you enjoy RPGs with a nice light-hearted story and characters or you loved the original Costume Quest, then this game is certainly for you.[/td]

So October has always been a haven for Halloween and indy horror games. This year is no exception, and the first big shot is from Double Fine Productions. They are better known for a nice little title called Psychonauts, as well as some amazing smaller titles like Stacking and Broken Age.

Costume Quest 2 is obviously the sequel to Costume Quest from 2010, also in October. At the core it is a turn based RPG with multiple classes and monsters. The first one took about 8 hours to completely, and I'm about 3 hours into this one, and it seems like it going to be much longer! Candy is your currency, and trading cards are your accessories. To change your class, you just don a different costume, each with unique powers and weaknesses. From a clown with a nose horn to a Pterodactyl that blows away leaves. To the very amazing candy corn costume from the first game, that we never got to use. Now we get to, and to make up for it there is an achievement for using it in every battle of the game. I already failed that achievement this time around, because oh ya it is the tank of the game, it has no offense, cant use items, or anything. It just has a fairly high threat, and decent amount of defense.

The premise of the series is to go door to door trick or treating, fighting monsters, and collecting candy. You use the candy to buy upgrades to your costumes, trading cards, and maps of areas. 11 new costumes and 4 classic costumes (pre-order bonus) make up your classes, ranging from offensive, defensive (seriously the candy corn doesnt do anything but soak damage!), and healers. As an added bonus, the roller skates from the robot costume of the original are permanent, and useable in any costume. Trading cards are now items, slightly replacing stamps. You can put 3 cards into your inventory, and then use them in battle. There is a wide range of options including double exp for the battle, heal to full at the end of the battle, when the enemy attacks they take damage from it as well, a character can go twice per turn, and many more. Maps, seriously they added maps. If you watch my stream of the first game, you can see in the expansion, I missed one house, and could not for the life of me figure out where it was. Probably spent 20 mins looking for it. The map now shows you all the houses that can be trick or treated, as well as healing wells, portals, the number of costume parts found/available, and secrets found/available. Quite a huge addition in my mind.

Combat has had a few tweaks as well. Each character is assigned a button specific to them. It factors in on offensive and defensive sides of the battle. You now can combo a second hit, if timing on your first hit is decent. There are also two tiers of timed hits Nice and AWESOME, both give a bonus to the damage taken, and then roll over to a second hit, which also has a timing action. Defensive uses the same button for the character, and majorly cut down on the damage, just like the original. A big difference from the first is the special meter. Instead of just powering up for 2 turns and being available on the 3rd, it charges up with each attack you give and receive. So now instead of just rotating heals on boss fights, you have to actually think about when the best time to use them is. Each costume as has a strength and weakness associated with it. These correspond to the types of enemies, and give you a bonus or penalty to your attacks if they match up with the enemies type.

This time around the story picks right up after the ending to the Grubbins on Ice expansion. After jumping into the portal to escape the Monster's home world, you go back to your home town. But things are different, apparently your parents moved next door for some unexplained reason (my theory is a different dimension, not developer error). You then see Oral White DDS and some dude with a clock on his neck jump into a portal and then reappear from it. Your candy bags from Halloween soon disappear and a strangely familiar face jumps out of yet another portal and asks you to jump in with him. For some inexplicable reason, you jump in. Turns out it is Everette, the Knight from the first game, who has grown up and married Lucy (like we didnt see that coming!). The future is crazy, Halloween, costumes, and candy are outlawed, monsters run the place, and all the houses have banners promoting tooth related things as if they were the local sports team.

All in all the game has improved in many areas, still has the inside jokes, and political statements of the first. Was completely worth the $15 it costs on steam (or $20 if you want the original as well). Anyone who is a fan of the first, stacking, or DFP in general should give this game a serious look. If you want to see how the game plays, I have already streamed quite a bit of the game on the gamesource twitch and youtube channels, so take a look at them! [b]The score that everyone wants to see is that the game is an 8.5 out of 10.[/b] The game is 'fun' but not great, and I'd rather have fun than great and boring. The timing on the attacks is a little annoying at times, and I've already encountered a few glitches (non game breaking, just graphical annoyance, and some candy you cant reach at times).",1413035419,1413035419,True,2,0,0.508861422538757324,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Here's what CQ2 boasts:

+ A new combat system.
Anyone who's played CQ1 will tell you that that game's battle system was not the most exciting. It required you to perform quick time events to increase the damage output of your attack or the damage reduction of your block. Instead, CQ2 now requires you to press a single button at a precise moment to do the same. This sounds terrible but actually the timing is brutal with its precision and messing it up can and will screw you over, especially when you get into the realms of needed precise timing to be able to do counter attacks and double hits.
That said, much like the original CQ, you will run on autopilot eventually, as the precise timing will soon turn into muscle memory.

+ Many different areas.
This is either a hit or a miss, as the original CQ had only three areas, however each area was unique and really well made. In CQ2, there are now several areas that can sometimes seem a bit samey. They're all great to look at, but do sometimes feel like a chore to navigate.
The new addition of maps is fantastic, and I've heard complaints of people saying they would prefer it if the map told you where you were, but I didn't mind that. What I had a problem with was that the maps looked like arse, but once you orientate it in your head, finding your position is easy.

+ Enemy classes.
The original CQ had four uncredited enemy classes: ranged, melee, support magic and offensive magic. Here, they are now monster, tech and magic (the two magic classes have been fused together so healers can now cause lots of damage, as if they weren't irritating enough!). The relevance of this is that each costume has a class that it is stronger against (will do more and take less damage) and weak against (will do less and take more damage). This is actually quite a nice addition as I used to prioritise enemies to eliminate with my strongest costumes and then finish off the weaker ones with my weaker costumes, but now the game is forcing me to do that and it's much easier to figure out how it all works.

+ Many new costumes.
Some of them are just reskinned old ones, the ghost is the ninja, the pharaoh is the pirate and unicorn, and even the new hotdog and wizard seem similar to each other. But they do work differently by now having new costume specialisations. As well as healing, attacking and defense, you also have splash damage and ressurection costumes, among others.

+ Upgradable costumes.
Costumes can be upgraded for a large sum of candy by talking to Shady. It's unclear when upgrades are available or how they are unlocked, but they are useful, acting as permanent buffs and changing the model of the costume slightly.

+ The robot's skate ability is now in every costume.
'Nuff said.

+ Useful Creepy Treats Cards.
Gone are battle stamps, my friend, Creepy Treats Cards are all the rage now! Every Creepy Treats Card has an effect that can be activated in battle, which requires a cooldown to be used in later battles. You swap out which cards you take into battle outside of combat in your logbook. The effects are more interesting than the old battle stamps, such as ""Next minion to attack this hero is defeated"", ""Double XP at the end of battle"" and ""Mute a minion's magic attacks"" to name but a few. I mostly used the 'double XP' and 'instant death upon attacking hero X' ones and wasn't particularly interested in the others. I will say I preffered the art design for the Creepy Treats Cards from the original CQ.

+ Story.
The story continues immediately after Grubbins on Ice, and if you thought the first two stories were ridiculous, take a gander at this one. Dr. White the dentist has made a deal with a Time Wizard to go back in time to when he was a child to steal a talisman from two witches in a bog that used to exist before Auburn Pines which stops monsters from Repugia entering the human world so he can create his metropolis of a clean teeth utopia and rid the world of Halloween and candy forever.
Sounds ridiculous but its actually very interesting to watch and its great to be along for the ride. What's more, I have a soft spot for watching characters I know and love grow up, and CQ2 nails that when you travel to the future and meet a married Lucy and Everett.

With all of that said, CQ2 isn't perfect. There is a big black hideous tumour growing on the side of its face, resembling an awful new game mechanic that wasn't needed and really detracts from the experience. Those who have played CQ2 know I'm talking about the fountain drinking.
Your health does not recover after battle, unless you level up. So to recover your health to full, you have to drink from a water fountain. This means that every couple of battles you will have to backtrack to the nearest fountain just to have a drink, only to go back to where you were and continue. It's really easy to avoid fights if you don't rush it so you pretty much won't get molested on the way to the fountain, and running away from fights teleports you to the nearest fountain anyway!
It's really dumb and doesn't add anything to the gameplay, other than an annoyance to have to backtrack. Plus, when you enter a new area, your first priority is to find either Shady or a fountain, as any area entered for the first time spawns a map for purchase from Shady. So if you find Shady, buy the map and you'll see where the fountain is. If you find the fountain first, remember where it is.

Overall, Costume Quest 2 is fantastic. Fans of the original will adore this game, and like Costume Quest before it, I can see myself giving this game multiple playthroughs. It took me about 7.4 hours to beat first time round, when the original CQ and its DLC combined takes about 6. Both of those times are taking all quests completed into account.",1412980535,1419162550,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Costume Quest 2 is a refinement of the good parts of the first game (goofy colourful fun, simple mechanics with many permutations) remixed with some more modern handheld RPG elements (items with a single use per battle, reaction based attack bonuses).

The puzzles are straight forward enough that anyone should be able to solve them but are still difficult enough to require some thought and experimentation. The only exception to this is the final optional costume which involves a fairly obtuse solution, though thankfully it isn't required to complete the game.

I found the combat system intuitive and forgiving. While the attacks now require carefully timed button presses it is still easy to get a [i]Nice![/i] damage bonus, which is more than sufficient to progress in the game. The best bonus is [i]Amazing![/i] but it is effectively impossible to get consistently. There have been complaints of input lag making combat difficult but I have not witnessed this with either the keyboard or a gamepad.

My only real complaint is that it is a bit shorter than I was expecting, but it still took 6 hours on my first playthrough - that's just less than ¬£2 per hour (assuming you don't play it again) or about the same value as a cinema ticket.

Really addictive but extremely easy unless you engage with the HARDCORN Mode achievement.  Even then it's really easy, but I found myself running away from some tough fights to prepare more.  Less Halloween-y than the original, not as funny, and probably not as challenging, but there are slightly more RPG systems to play with and the NOLA-Louisiana pastiche near the beginning is pretty nice.  It uses the Paper Mario timing system of attacking; and, they changed out the equipment system of the first game for an ability card deck with cooldowns.  You can make some devastating set-ups.  While I wouldn't say there's much a of difficulty curve, there is a complexity curve; and, you're given appropriately more powerful or complex cards as you progress. Each costume (which serve as party members) gets one upgrade to make them more specialized, but I found myself sticking with much of the same roster for extended periods of gametime.

Many assets, including costumes, are recycled and the neighborhoods are likely to induce deja vu in those who played the original. The few adjustments that have been made are of little consequence so, if you enjoyed Costume Quest and wanted more of the same, you'll enjoy this; on the other hand, if you felt it began to drag and become repetitive, or that battles were tedious, you will feel it again here and sooner. For those who haven't played either, there's no reason you can't start with this one. 

The story in Costume Quest 2 revolves around a group of kids who must utilize time travel to deal with the results of a mother obsessed with keeping her son's teeth in perfect condition; that is, save Halloween from being outlawed by the deranged dentist he becomes. To accomplish this, you'll need to skate around neighborhoods completing quests, knocking on doors and beating up baddies for candy that can be used to buy maps, costume upgrades and battle abilities. Some costumes grant powers that are needed to access secret areas or progress the story, and you can switch between them at any time while not in combat.

Combat begins with your characters morphing into giant versions of whatever costumes they're wearing and is turn-based, with QTEs for enhanced damage, blocking and combos. Whether it's Thomas Jefferson and his special attack, the Declaration of Destruction; generic robots and superheroes; or a useless candy corn that's still trying to find his courage, it's all amusing and the animations are nicely done. The biggest improvement that could have been made to the game, but wasn't, would no doubt involve the length and repetition of battles and QTEs.

Overall, Costume Quest 2 is a light-hearted, humorous, feel-good game that, when played by someone new to the series, should make up for in charm what it lacks in depth. I can easily recommend it to newcomers and lovers of the first title; for those who thought Costume Quest was nothing more than fair, don't expect this to change your mind: Double Fine didn't attempt to in the slightest.",1412825010,1412872208,True,180,2,0.909935355186462402,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Changes to the combat are largely successful - damage types, combo attacks and the trading cards all make things a little more interesting and varied than it was before, providing more meaningful decisions in battles. It's not deep by any means, but it was enough to sustain my interest over the 6 hours or so that it took me to see the end. It was also good to see special meter retained between battles, although the retaining of damage between battles mainly just provided a chore of going back to water fountains regularly to recharge. Luckily, there's pretty much always one nearby. 

Elsewhere the game has all the charm we've come to expect. A graphical uplift makes the already lovely, stylised visuals even sharper, and the time-travelling plot provides opportunity for a wide variety of locations. Peter McConnell is back for the soundtrack, which stood out to me as one of his finest, with the themes in the past area making particularly fine use of slide guitar. 

The humour is endearing rather than uproarous, which suits the tone of the game well. It would have been nice if they'd had a budget for voice acting, as I'd love to hear this world come to life in that way, but we can't have it all.

The game length was shortened by almost half, I found myself wandering around aimlessly in this game for 20 minutes at a time trying to figure some of the more cryptic quests out and I still managed to finish it in half the time it took me to beat CQ1... although in it's defense, this game doesn't have DLC, but the DLC for CQ1 isn't 6 hours long. 

The story was a bit rushed, It felt really manic and clumsey and the costumes all felt more useless than in the original... 

The coolest costume is very hard to find and requires you to actually do a lateral thinking puzzle where all other quests are basically spelled out for you or documented in your note book. It's just a shame I finished the game before finding it because after discovering it I had no use for it... I tested out it's special move and thought it would of been cool to fight the final boss with it again, but he was already a push over.

The Candy Corn achievement is just gruling and brutal because of all the quips you have to endure every time that characters turn comes up but in the long run it does you a favor... Using Candy Corn slows the pace of the game to a crawl because you lose one of your fighters for the entire duration of the game but it helps tremendously during boss fights and even more especially during the final fight.

The music and design is nothing to gawk at... just more of the same except now you can double attack and use counter attacks... The buff badges have been removed and the creepy treat cards were given more utility... 

So now you can actually use them for something other than staring at but I didn't want to waste any in fear that I might lose out on the collection achievement... so that was a waste of resources if I've ever seen one... I never needed to utilze a single card the entire time playing.

A 6 / 10 on my scale

Combat gets repeatitive, is very frequent, and enemy battles always run the risk of offing you if you get careless

Story is nothing to write home about, on par with the first game

Length - Took me 4 hours to beat it at ~100% completion.  Then I took a half hour wandering the ""kill screen"" final end ""credits"" before realizing that after talking to everyone multiple times, trying to enter a house, and the like nothing would end it...  Kind of a weak ending.  At least you don't have points of no return this time.

Costumes - Lots to choose from, sadly only a handful have map interaction, the rest are just for kicks.  And you'll find yourself using just a couple in battle because they are so clearly better than the others.

Graphics and gameplay are about what the first offered, if you want more of that then great.

Basically, if you like me have a lot of disposable income and time.  Then check it out.  If you expect anything more than the first game, you will be sorely disappointed.

So, would I still reccomend this game?  Yes.  And here's why.

As I have mentioned before, the combat is been reworked a little, so instead of function selections it's actually QTE button attacks.  But there is a bit more variety than I first mentioned.  Not a whole lot, you can double attack and counter (if you can time the counter right).  But it still makes a faster pace to battles.

The Battle Cards replace the Battle Stamps and Creepy Cards, you use the card like items in battle, which takes up one turn.  You can have up to three for selection at battle, and they take a number of battles to recharge (you can cheat this by restarting the game).  The cards vary from ""Enemy takes his own damage"", to ""Double Candy from Battle"", to ""Get healed 25 percent of your health for three turns"" etc.  You get these cards by drops, buying, chests, and trades.

As I said before, the area's are expanded out quite a bit, but there is only two hub worlds you can play in.  But that's not bad though, there are big maps, and one would take up nearly 3 area's.  Exploration are well done, but near the end the game curves paths to more straight lines so it's easy to get to chests, kids, or quest items.

Speaking of quests, not too much to offer.  If you played the first one, you'll know what to do in the second one.  If you haven't, it's mostly talk to this person, use this costume to find clues or get to new area's, play hide n seek.

Story is alright.  It's nothing to write home about, but it doesn't have to be.  It made me chuckle and that's what I expected.

And that's what I think of this game really, it's expected.  I'm rather glad most YT'ers are sorta overlooking this game, they probably would have chewed it up by the changes since the first one was very charming, and thus it will give them time to look at it for what it is and not what they want it to be.

If your still on the fence, I would recommend a sale then, at least 30 percent off.  But as it being of Double Fine's first sequel ever?  I think it's alot better than I would have first though.  Give it a shot.",1412719385,1413085353,True,13,0,0.508130550384521484,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Much of the story would make little sense on it's own.  It seems the developer assumes you've played the previous game and doesn't try to fill in the blanks too much.  (Don't worry, it's worth it to play CQ before CQ2.)  My review also assumes you're familiar with the first game.

the Good:  - cute graphics, Halloween atmosphere
  - witty dialoge
  - fun gameplay, more complex battle system
  - lots of exploration
  - good story
  - many new and upgradable costumes

the Bad:  - main menu is quite annoying, call me old-fashioned but I prefer simple, efficient text on the screen

It's rare to see a holiday-specific game, but like those familiar Christmas songs, Costume Quest has become a tradition among it's fans.  Much like the first game, Costume Quest 2 is simple, fun, and charming.  The battle system has been refined to better engage the player with combo attacks and timed button presses.  Health sometimes needs to be replenished after battles this time, adding a bit of difficulty, and the collectible card power ups have been re-tooled forcing more strategery.

In short, this is everything that made Costume Quest great with increased variety and the welcome addition of more complexity.  Is it time for Halloween?  Long for a little Trick-or-Treat nostalgia?  Then it's time to play Costume Quest 2.
