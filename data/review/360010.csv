I think It's biggest strength comes from its battle gameplay. I think the two character combo ability+magic system does grant it some depth and the difficulty feels pretty well balanced. Sadly the dungeons feel quite generic and aimlessly designed lacking any real things of interest, but at least they're all very short so at least you're probably not gonna get lost.  There is a sense of dopamine to it with how many treasure chests there are and how quickly your guys end up powering up.

There is some minor chemistry between main characters, the mute girl and the axe guy but it's all extremely surface level stuff and leaves you wanting for more, the background lore of the game is completely uninteresting and the info dumps on the notes you randomly find through the dungeons completely lost me. The game advertises its three endings but none of them are really substantial at all.

I think I got this game ages ago as a part of a humble bundle or something akin to that as a filler game and I guess for what it is, it's fine, if you want an extremely low commitment RPG that's over in a evening then you could do worse than this.",1709943739,1709943739,True,0,0,0.489443391561508179,0,False,False,False,True,,,

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705370547,1705370547,True,4,0,0.564970135688781738,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Remnants Of Isolation is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.  The ""developers"" did add some of their own craptastic pixel ""art"" assets to this RPG Maker asset flip, all of which look like they were done in MS-Paint by someone suffering from Parkinson's, only worse.  Which just goes to show, if you can't do better than the assets you would otherwise be flipping, just.. don't. 

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art (or worse), looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Remnants Of Isolation has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  Every achievement for the game was only attained by around 2 percent of players, who only bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show only 2 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  The game doesn't demonstrate any true popular appeal with gamers, most likely due to the reasons raised in this review.

Remnants Of Isolation is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.",1677083950,1677083950,False,2,1,0.218010202050209045,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Artıları:
1. Dövüş sistemi titriyor. Nasıl çalışır, her karakter herhangi bir temel büyü kullanabilir, ancak yalnızca o kişinin diğerinin büyülerini güçlendirmek için kullanabileceği doğuştan gelen yetenekleri vardır. Böylece bir kişi gücünü arttırır (onu daha güçlü yapmak veya tüm düşmanları vurmak gibi) ve ardından diğeri hasar büyüsünü yapar. Karakterlerin birlikte çalışmasını ve birbirine ihtiyaç duymasını sağlarken, çoğu RPG'de her karakter kendi işini yapar.

2. Müzik oyunun temasına uyuyor (Keşfetmeniz gereken ürkütücü bir kale).

3. Karakterlerin kimyası iyi. Ana karakter konuşmasa da arkadaşı onunla iletişim kurmaya devam eder ve birlikte geçirdikleri kısa süre boyunca işleyen bir aşk ilişkisi kurar. Dış dünyada, her karakterin kendi yetenekleri vardır (Ana karakter kapıları açmak için müzik çalabilir ve arkadaş boşlukları atlayabilir) bu da kişiliklerini geliştirmeye yardımcı olur.

Eksileri:
1. Oyun kısa (2 saatte bitirdim).

""İyi"" son olmayan iki son, anlamsız görünüyor çünkü onlar için hiçbir madde yok (sadece karşılık gelen karakterin ""son 2 veya 3"" yanıp sönerek ekrandan çıkması var).

首先游戏的剧情和故事叙述方式显得平淡无奇，缺乏深度和吸引力。尽管游戏试图通过主角的孤独探索来展现一个独特的世界，但故事情节却显得单薄且缺乏情感共鸣。角色之间的互动也显得生硬和机械，无法引起玩家的共鸣和兴趣。

其次游戏的玩法机制相对单调且缺乏创新。游戏中玩家主要进行的是探索和解谜，然而这些元素并没有得到很好的呈现。探索过程中缺乏足够的惊喜和发现，解谜环节也显得过于简单和重复，使得整个游戏过程显得乏味和单调。

再者游戏的画面和音效表现也令人失望。虽然游戏试图通过独特的艺术风格来营造一种孤独和神秘的氛围，但实际效果却并不理想。画面质量平平，缺乏足够的细节和精致度，使得游戏世界显得不够生动和真实。音效方面也同样糟糕，背景音乐单调乏味，音效也缺乏层次感和真实感，无法为游戏营造出应有的氛围。

此外游戏的优化和稳定性问题也令人头疼。在游玩过程中，我多次遇到卡顿、延迟和崩溃等问题。这些问题不仅影响了游戏的流畅性，也让我对游戏的品质产生了质疑。尤其是在进行复杂操作或探索新区域时，这些问题变得更加明显和严重。

最后游戏的社区支持和客服反应也相对较慢。尽管游戏提供了社区功能，但玩家之间的交流和互动并不活跃，很难形成有效的社区氛围。同时客服对于玩家提出的问题和反馈反应迟钝，无法及时给予有效的解决。

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]Yes.[/b]
[i]If you're looking for a short RPG Maker game with great-looking custom graphics and multiple endings, you can buy this game. I suggest you buy it on a discount though because of the game's length.[/i]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Even though the game only uses custom assets for the characters and enemies, it looks stunning and matches well with the default assets. The enemies' images are smooth and great-looking despite some of them being recolors. Although I don't like the main character's designs, the images that show in the middle of the story help to progress the story better.

Each dungeon has a certain theme and concept in it. The mappings are also great and I don't seem to get bored in exploring the dungeons.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Despite the stunning images and soothing music, the game's story pales in comparison. The story is told through several journals and the characters don't have enough conversation to make me relate to them at all. The cutscene and the melody might have their part in improving the story, but it's still not enough especially since the story itself is more like a repetition of ""you must return to the prison"" word.

[h1]The game[/h1]
[b]Characters[/b]
You will mostly play with 2 characters in your party. Each character has a unique [i]Innate[/i] skill list and magic spells that can be learned by equipping a certain elemental card. You need to use MP to cast them but you don't have to worry about MP since you will always start with 3 MP in battle and it will be regenerated after each turn.

[b]Combo[/b]
You can combo an [i]Innate[/i] skill with an elemental magic spell to create a unique skill. The unique skill that will be created depends on the [i]Innate[/i] skill used before casting the spell. This combo can have various effects, from a better damaging spell to a buff to protect yourself from taking a particular elemental spell. Combining spells is a must in battles if you want to finish them faster.

[b]Spells[/b]
As I said before, each character has a unique [i]Innate[/i] skill and ""learnable"" magic spells. You can learn [i]Innate[/i] skills by leveling up while you can learn magic spells by equipping an elemental card to your character. Each character has 4 spell card slots and you can get the elemental card from a chest in the dungeons. Some card has duplicates, some don't.

[b]Dungeons[/b]
There are 4+ dungeons in total. There is only one easy puzzle throughout the game and the rest is just about killing or avoiding enemies to reach the boss. There is also a dungeon where you have to find a yellow tile to use a skill in it.

[b]Enemies[/b]
The game has touch-based encounters. Most of the encounters have a predetermined set of enemies in it and the escape rate is high, except for a small number of encounters. Most of these enemies will disappear after you escape or kill them although some will persist until you kill them all.

Surprisingly, this game has a lot of enemies with different weaknesses and resistance. Each dungeon has 5+ different enemies that you can find although I admit that some of them are recolors or the same enemy from the previous dungeons. However, I find that bosses are too easy since they can be defeated in the same combo as long as you know its weaknesses.

[b]Length[/b]
I finished this game in ~7h after grinding the level 10 achievement which somehow didn't grant. The rest of my playtime was spent in reloading my save and doing some experiments to get that achievement. It took me ~15 minutes to grind the level 10 achievement although I admit that your playtime can be shorter than that since I played while making a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2144652115]guide[/url] and reloaded my save several times to get the speedrun achievement in my first playthrough.

[b]Problem[/b]
I didn't encounter major problems when I played the game although the game always stutters when I walked my characters. I needed to take extra care in noticing important items, which is usually sparkling, because of it.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's a nice, short RPG Maker game with a great combo system and multiple endings.

What makes it stand out is several aspects. The storytelling is not done with long dialogues, there aren't many of those in the game since the lead character doesn't speak (can she even speak?) yet there is communication between the two persons that you're playing with and you can even feel the chemistry that's developing between the two. What makes this game so unique is that in game combat mechanics are used to convey emotions and that chemistry. 
Games like Celeste or Gris also managed to capture a sense of magic, that you're playing a special game made created with passion & love.

The game uses a very smart mechanic I haven't seen yet in other JRPG's, a combo system. You can choose abilities for both characters and if you manage to combine them right you will be stronger. So even though you will always only have 2 people in their party that's more than enough if you manage to combine those combo's because they are complementary.

The environment of this game looks wonderful, seldom have I seen pixels in an RPG Maker game look so gorgeous and it was done with just standard stock material, they did this by carefully selecting the tiles and walls so that colours match really well and create it's own vibe. There's lots of purple in the game, the lead character also has purple, it all just fits well together.

The game is not very long, between 4 and 5 hours, but it's short & sweet. Some people have complained about the shortness but I actually love games that can tell a captavating story in a short timeframe. This one can be played on one night with a hot cup of coffee and that's a perfect way to fill an evening. For me the lenght felt just right.

The soundtrack, piano music, is beautiful and even haunting. I also love the fact that the lead character can play a lovely music tune as a mechanic to trigger certain effects. The music really added to the athmosphere.

The game won a high profile 'best RPG Maker game of the year' competition set up by publisher Degica and they decided to publish it afterwards.

The ending of the game is one that you won't forget. There are actually three different endings so if you want to see all three of them make sure you save before the end boss. Basically it's a story about 2 people who are prisoner in some sort of mansion. Will they get out? And if so... is only one of them going to get out and who will that be? Or will both of them escape or will no one escape and will they remain a prisoner for eternity? Time will tell, that time is exactly the 4-5 hours it will take you to complete it.
Enjoy...

To be honest I played this game because I saw it won the Indie Game Maker Contest back in 2014 and I wanted to check out how good it was.

Despite the game’s short length (due to the contest’s conditions) it manages to tell a gripping story about a mysterious, mute girl who is accidentally freed from her magical prison by a mage and both have to find their way out from there. Even if the plot is a bit simple you can’t help but care for the characters.

I also liked the combo system in the game a lot. It lets you combine your innate spells with equipable spells to produce a stronger attack, one that hits everyone, cause status effects, etc.

Both the art and the soundtrack were remarkable too. It’s pretty clear they put a lot of care in both the characters and the monster’s design, and the music does a great job at enhancing every scene in the game (especially that piano track).

To sum it up, this game is just great. It's a must-play for anyone looking for a short, memorable game.",1581163517,1609440675,True,3,0,0.580878257751464844,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's the story of two people locked in the same foreboding castle with the desire to get out together.  They even have a language barrier, or rather, Celesta seems to be incapable of speech.  Each character has a unique ability for navigating terrain and they have to be used in combination to get through.

However, it takes a willingness to set aside reality to believe that these two people grow so quickly attached to each other in such a short period, even given the fact that they seem to be the only two sane beings left in the castle.  Also, like Ico, the navigation of the castle can drag on.  There is a complicated mechanism to unlock the final door and it necessitates traveling the length of the entire castle to unlock it.

On a gameplay note, the only gripes I have are that you cannot change the battle order and that when you select a healing item or spell it defaults to Celeste.

Overall, the story is intriguing and the gameplay is solid.  It helps as well that there is some beautiful custom artwork.  Highly recommend.",1569132373,1569132373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Good difficulty level. Strategy is required and you'll get wiped out if you make a mistake, but not so hard that it's frustrating.

Cons:
- I would have liked the ending to be fleshed out a little more. The devs went with a ""let the reader fill in the rest"" mentality, which is fine but a little bit of a let down.

TLDR: Deviant-art style assets that at least are original. The spellfusion combo felt a little over-engineered and not all that fluid or organic to use. Odd dialogue.

My mind was aggressively tuning out the dialogue and I found no immersion whatsoever. Felt like an odd game where you walk out of your magicell as an esper and start walking out of some facility. You meet some black dude with dreadlocks who just because, happens to stand there and wants to help you out, and he has a medieval name. Which is just jarring. You fight spookies but cant really tune out and hold attack because the game wants you to use its spellcard/fusion spell thing. So you have to use the guard function, micromanage your recovery of spellpoints and spend attacks strategically. Which in a game of this immersivity is just a tedious chore. Maps felt small and rather linear. Everything struck me as rather amateur. As if I was playtesting a free rpgmaker project off some shareware website.

The characters are beautiful and colorful, both appearance wise and personality wise. The monsters were memorable as well, some of them catching me off guard from how grotesque they appear. Without any grinding and kinda just learning the game as I went, said enemies provided fights on the difficult side without being impossible or frustrating. I wonder if I play through again if it will be easier because I know weaknesses and combos, which is possible. Grinding seems like it would benefit some too.

At first I was a bit wary of the art because I've played many RPGMaker games in the past that had some, if anything, completely uninteresting visuals. While this game won't wow you with big flashy animations, it is still wonderfully gorgeous. The maps and characters really have a wonderful feel with just how colorful they are. I think it would've been easy to make them muted to fit the sad tone of the game, but their color and the fact that it looks good in this setting really show the work artists put into this!

It's a nice, short game with a storyline that is easy to understand and get into. Some sections with dialogue might feel a little weird because one of the protagonists doesn't talk at all, but I think it more helped the game's tone more than hurt it. Character interactions were charming and cute despite one side of it being mostly facial expressions. And normally I would roll my eyes at how things like romance were referenced because it was pretty cliche, but the characters being so unique actually made it incredibly charming.

It's not the perfect game, as some things are a bit confusing at first and it seems like taking your time to think is encouraged, but again, it's not all bad. The mystery and the slow pace of the battles really are part of the experience. It wouldn't be quite the same game without those elements, even if some aspects of them might be a little irritating when you first start.

I will play more of this game and try to see the last two endings, as the one I got really just made me want more! I'm worried playing through again may be boring as this kind of game doesn't have the most replayability potential, but I'm still eager to give it another shot.

Overall, for the price, this game went beyond what I was expecting. I was thinking it would be a cliche RPGMaker game with flat characters and environments, so naturally I was shocked to learn about the true nature of it! The battles in particular were nice, and the combo system reminded me of games like Chrono Trigger, where cooperation between characters is highly encouraged. This game did a good job at feeling unique and different in lots of areas!

Our story begins as a girl is playing on her magical piano when her cell opens. After some exploring, she meets a boy called Melchior who was recently threw into the prison and is thrilled to meet someone who isn't trying to kill him and together decide to find a way to escape. 

One if the interesting things about the the story is that the only voice for most of the game is Melchior who tries to be optimistic with his new friend but those feel the dread and is only holding on because of his friend. And while Celesta doesn't talk(either because she's a mute or she doesn't know how) I do like that shes doesn't fully understand whats happening and immediately gets attached to Melchior because he the first person shes ever met and I love her expressions she makes, my favourite is when she looks confused or curious as it just looks cute. 

The relationship between the two leads is very sweet and is clearly the ""heart"" of the story.I mainly see it as true friendship with Melchior telling her about everything he knows and wants to show her and shows and wants her to have a life and Celesta helps supports him and stops him falling into despair and would give her life to make sure he can be happy. This is also seen in gameplay and I'll wait til I talk about gameplay before I explain 

And one final quick point is that I really liked the Sentinel but wished the other bosses were had a personality like him mainly his motives and goal made him an interesting anti-villain and his last moments were nice. 

Gameplay: 
Lets get this out of the way. Yes the game is very short. There's even an achievement for speed running this game in a hour and a half. I don't have a problem with that. 

The main feature in this game is the spell fusion and its a very good system and fits with the whole partnership. Just use a characters innate ability followed by a magic card and then watch the fireworks. I would admit this makes the game a tiny bit easy...if it wasn't for almost every enemy hitting like a truck and aren't shy about poisoning the two. I see it as one of the more balanced combat systems I've played as its more about strategy: weaken and attack when possible and turtle and heal in an emergency. And that's the simple way of explaining. I admit there was one boss that was ridiculously easy but I just exploited his weakness. Another was easy for story reasons. 

But what shows how hard this game can be is when your alone because even the first fight in the game is brutal by yourself before you get your partner and learn magic. Some people might say this is a bad thing but I like to think of it as Story-Gameplay integration showing how powerful you are together but alone, your as weak as a biscuit in tea. 

Presentation: 
Lets start with the music. There no doubt the music is beautiful, but I eventually got bored of it. The music Celesta plays on her piano is a lovely song but when I realised the dungeon song was the same song, I just stopped paying attention. Its not bad, just not my kind of music. 

The art is pretty good. The two leads and the bosses are all look lovely and are very colourful which contrast the monster which are mostly fleshy things that came from Silent Hill. I liked the character portraits but I wish they were bigger since its just the two of them and Celesta mainly communicates through her expressions and I feel that they were too small for her. 

Verdict: 
Despite the length this is a nice short story and a pretty good battle system and I don't regret buying it.

Remnants of Isolation has fun mechanical ideas and some strong text writing hampered by a reliance on RPGMaker standards like visual styles we've seen everywhere before and a story of instant love between a blank slate and her exposition spout.

The long:

Remnants of Isolation is a game that wins and loses on what it does with its limited resources. The game gives you two characters, one of which is mute and one of which talks enough for both of them, as you travel through a series of dungeons within the same sealed castle.

This limitation shines in the gameplay: while you only have two characters, their magic system is split in two: one set of utility-based spells that drain life, inflict status effects, etc., while the more traditional ""fire"" and ""lightning"" are equipped slots. Casting the ""innate"" utility magic followed by spell card magic from the other results in a combo that doubles damage, adds extra targets, or changes an offensive spell into a defensive one. This, along with an MP system that charges from empty during a battle, changes what would normally be a fairly mindless turn-based attack system into one that requires enough rhythm and planning to keep things surprisingly deep and entertaining.

The character design is above-average, with the female lead having a striking and memorable design. Beyond that, the art is standard RPGMaker fare: a bunch of worlds with themes like ""forest"", ""ice"", and ""flesh"" that have no real uniting factor except the ""medieval castle"" overworld that connects them. The sound design, likewise, is the usual dings and jingles, but well-composed for what they are.

The story is appealing, but thin. Flavor text gives strong impressions of a world beset by entropy and sacrifice, but we get little out of it beyond a couple of first names. The characters are meant to bond, but we're given a story where the two leads -- one of which never speaks -- are meant to fall in magical, cosmic love in the course of the couple of hours that they spend together. It feels more obligatory than organic.

Even with those failings, there's enough there to be worth a playthrough.",1491385340,1491385340,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its uniqueness is largely due to its battle system known as ""spell fusion."" Basically, you have two party members, each with two types of spells, ""innate"" which is learned through leveling and ""magic"" which is equipped. If one character uses an innate spell and the second character follows it up with a magic spell, the latter will be significantly enhanced. It's addicting to find all the combinations and it's no arbitrary mechanic either; it's near impossible to succeed at this game without using it.

The story and atmosphere are also very nice, making me want to know more about this dreary world.

The enemy designs are also legitimately scary, so that's impressive.

* The battle engine, with its combo spells, is a good idea in principle, but the implementation isn't great. It's poorly balanced, with your party having infinite regenerative capabilities, and bosses being too easy. Also, with just two characters, there's just not a lot of depth to work with.

* Personal taste, but I find the art style... odd. Enemy design seems to be going for a horror theme, but they end up looking more like Halloween props than actually disturbing imagery. The two player characters just look... wrong.

* The story - and this is perhaps where everything does fall apart - is bare bones, lacks nuance or anything interesting. The main character doesn't speak, the creepy sidekick ""falls in love"" with her over the course of one evening, with nothing to justify such a development.

Remnants of Isolation is a linear dungeon-crawl with a narrative about loneliness and, of course, isolation. The central conflict is over whether or not people can find meaning in each other and deal with these problems and, less importantly, whether folks can escape a giant magical dungeon full of well-rendered megabosses. 

The art in RoI is really quite good, provided you limit your definition of ""art"" to strictly the character portraits and the monsters you encounter in battle. The tileset seems to be largely stock, and looks about as interesting as a slug on pavement. 

Music is overall better, with what seems to be a custom soundtrack and decent stock effects. However, the Chrono Trigger victory noise is the soundbite that ends every battle, and I have no idea how that snuck into the finished copy. I'm realtively confident that it still belongs to Squeenix, although maybe it has somehow been opened up for indie developers to use.

Combat is nearly engaging. Your party consists of two characters, each of which has spells and also abilities that amp spells used on the same turn. So, you'll have one character attack with an ability that makes the other character's spell hit all monsters, and then you'll cast fire for AoE damage. Battles still feel grindy, but there's at least a little more substance than mashing your strongest abilities to win.

In summary, this isn't an abominous travesty like Data Hacker is. It's not a sleeper hit like City of Chains or an actual quality title either. It's just okay. Not bad for a first effort on steam, but not particularly worth your time either, even if it is priced accordingly for the content it delivers.",1471380857,1471380857,False,8,1,0.559493660926818848,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Combat feels good, and isn't the standard ""mash attack until they die"" variety. Spells have to be carefully chosen and combined with your companion's in order to achieve the most powerful and/or appropriate effect, especially when dealing with groups of enemies that are each resistant to different elements. That being said, there are some clearly superior combinations that you'll be using almost exclusively.

+ No random battles. You can see enemies on the map as you're walking around, and individual fights are static. If you leave an area and return, you'll fight the same monster configurations you fought the previous time. This allows for some easy grinding because you'll develop a sure-fire combo strategy to kill a particular group of enemies over and over for some quick level ups.

+ Interesting merchant set-up. You ""craft"" items with souls at special altars, which really isn't any different than buying them from a merchant with gold, but for some reason it just feels better. Kudos to the developers for turning a boring mechanic into something a little less dull.

+ Engrossing (if minimal) storyline. Melchior is a great companion and more than makes up for the fact that the protagonist doesn't speak. Most of the setting is explained through his dialog and the notes that you find throughout the dungeon.

+/- Three different endings, but only the ""good"" one is worth seeing. Even then, it's extremely brief.

- Bosses are total pushovers. You can set up a combo to make any boss weak to any element type. Afterwards, you can then use another combo to hit them with a supercharged version of the element you just made them weak to. 9 times out of 10, this one-shots them.

- Some spell combinations are clearly inferior, or take too long to set up because of the mana mechanic. You're almost always better off just coming out guns blazing and ending the fight quickly. There are buff combos, but there's nearly no reason to use them.

- The game is really short. I wouldn't mind so much, but I actually felt like there was a story being built up that could have turned into something full-length. As it is, the entire game feels like the prologue to a much larger game that  never happens. That was the single most disappointing thing about this game for me -- it's such a tease!
 

I'd be interested in a continuation of the story where we actually see this outside world referenced in the game, and what effect our characters would have on it in the aftermath of the game's ending. Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed this little gem and I definitely recommend it if you enjoy games in the genre. The price is a little steep for the amount of content, though. I'd say wait for it to go on sale and then jump on it.

The way mana works in this game and the unique spell chaining/combo system allows each battle to feel way more engaging than in typical RPGs. Both party members really feel like they are dependent on each other, and it hits you even harder when they get seperated. This is less a nusance and more of a welcome change of pace, however.

Remnants of Isolation is a 2-hour RPG journey that follows Celesta and Melchior as they try and escape this castle. To escape, they'll need to defeat several guardians to light the different crystals. Once they do that, will the be able to make it out alive?

I generally enjoyed Remnants of Isolation. The combat system was different. Instead of just your regular turn based battle system, you need to plan between the two to set up Spell Fusions. These are essential for surviving through the various battles. To learn your spells, you'll need to find what are called spell cards and then equip them. I found this quite interesting, as it really did lead to having to think up some unique strategies. On the other hand, though, I didn't like the MP system as much, as it felt quite limiting at times. I couldn't cast the spells I needed when I needed to.

La música acompaña muy bien (me encantó la melodía principal). Los escenarios no tienen un acabado fantástico y en ocasiones son algo sobrecargados, con echar un vistazo a las capturas en la página de la tienda se entiende a qué me refiero, pero es lo que hay con el RPG Maker.

Vamos ahora con el principal atractivo del juego. El sistema de batalla es muy original y divertido: cada combate es diferente, ya que hay que planear bien la estrategia y ni siquiera al principio consiste en atacar sin más hasta tumbar al enemigo. La forma en que se empieza siempre con el mismo maná y se va recuperando dentro de la batalla hace que tengas que vigilar siempre cuánto tienes para poder hacer lo que planeas, pero al mismo tiempo no te hace reservarlo para más tarde. La única pega que se me ocurre es que algunos combos son muy buenos y rompe un poco el juego, pero al usarlos sientes más que has resuelto el acertijo de cómo ganar el combate que simplemente estar machacando porque tus personajes estén rotos, así que no está mal del todo. Al final acaba siendo algo fácil, ya que si planeas medianamente bien tus movimientos, probablemente no pierdas en todo el juego. En definitiva, es un sistema original y muy divertido, que en mi opinión es lo mejor del juego.

There are two negative points which I want to point out (but don't be fooled, they're compensated by the positive points I mention right after)

- Theres not too much focus on the story and huge parts of it are gathered through notes (which you may find or not, depends on how much exploring you do)
BUT: The characters are very likeable, even though one of them can't speak. The relationship between the two main characters is heartwarming, which is pretty surprising regarding the fact that you spend such a short amount of time with them. 
The atmosphere is phantastic and very mysterious - the music is largely responsible for that. The soundtrack is awesome and supports every mood presented in the game.
So yeah, if you are able to connect to the characters and atmosphere, you will have a great time and get more out of the story than you might think.

- Exploring the different parts of the dungeons can be tedious, although every path has its own design. But the riddles there are so easy that you really do nothing else than running and fighting.
BUT: The battle system is great. The characters have skills which can be combined to have different effects. And you really need those. I didn't think the game was too easy, in fact I had to prepare a tactic for most of the fights. I really enjoyed that.
I also think that the short playtime benefits the gameplay. Yeah, its a little disappointing to see the ending after 3-4 hours, but otherwise the dungeon exploring would've become too annoying. 

So, is it worth it? I'd say yes, definitely. But you have to keep in mind that the game is short and may want to wait for a sale. I didn't regret buying this game at release at all. Really liked it.",1431456842,1431517202,True,21,1,0.74138408899307251,2,True,False,False,False,,,
