TLDR: Got pewpews and aliens. Repetitive. Instance based. Mop up. Progress campaign. Rince and repeat. Shallow mechanics. Simple A.I. Unrewarding grind. Xbox360pad not working out of box. 

Debatable immersion factor. In the end this almost feels like some strange single player version of some faction based MMO

This is an instance based game in which you use a limited amount of racial cooldown powers to repetitively take over planets as part of a pre-established galactic domination timeline. The instances did not really feel handmade either, just creatures of each race dumped on each ends of a map and some buildings randomly generated here and there for you to destroy.

Your choices boil down to picking your race at the beginning and the goal is to roll over the other three factions until you occupy the spacemap. Only thing to do is buy upgrades and consumables between missions or go for the odd bounty sidemission for extra cash. The engine had resolution options and even dated looked alright. The narrative sort of goes nowhere and it just seems like a lame excuse to have little mini wars with lasers and robots. 

Xbox360 pad was not detected or working but given the shooter heavy nature of this title it is not a problem. Most upgrades are simply +stat versions of your starting stuff as part of keeping with up the gradual difficulty curve. Not very engaging.

The user interface was clean, the idea for the different factions was alright and the tutorial was effective. The camera was fixed vertically but rotated smoothly around and navigation felt rather responsive and made sense.

Having to wait for the next mission to appear, or go from spot to spot in the hub map to buy or start a new encounter felt a little bit like pointless padding.

This game suffers most from keeping everything on rails. There is no real sandboxing your own career through contracts, having different reputations with different alien factions, acquiring exotic technologies, outfitting your own ship or anything of the sort from what I have seen...",1506029520,1509676598,False,2,0,0.528377950191497803,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Full disclosure: I only played this game for about an hour, but if you are looking for a space combat sim, read on to see why I only played for an hour.

I started off liking the game despite the dated graphics and somewhat clumsy feeling controls.  The first couple of ground missions were very simple in nature, but I figured that is what they should be for the first couple of missions.  Then I got my first space fighter.  For my first space mission, I stuggled mightily with the controls.  I had to turn my mouse sensitivity (using my Logitech mouse software, not the game engine) WAAAAY down to prevent oversteer.  Once I got that down, I thought everything would be smooth sailing...I was WRONG!  The space combat is NOT a sim.  It is a very simplistic wannabe sim with the WORST controls in recent memory.  If you are going to give me a space fighter, I had better be able feel like I am flying the damn thing.  Even games that make space fighters fly like atmospheric craft, while completely unrealistic as far as Newtonian physics go, are at least FUN to play.  Sadly, Salvation Prophecy is not.  The space ships have a speed slider that is about as much fun to manipulate as the volume slider in your Windows system tray, and also exactly as responsive.  What I mean by that is there is very little (if there is any at all) in the way of acceleration in the space flight.  You set your speed with the thrust slider and your ship goes that speed instantaneously.  The motion of the ship feels like you are maneuvering through a thick jelly.  In short the space ship handling is like a crippled sloth that has had its reflexes slwoed to near comatose levels with a massive dose of Morphine.

In the end, space combat killed this game for me...killed it dead in less than an hour.  After playing though maybe half of the first space mission I immediately quit the game and uninstalled it.",1495508405,1495508405,False,3,3,0.410738259553909302,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Salvation Prophecy has some pacing problems. The beginning of the game is grating, working your way through the first few missions on land with no freedom. Then, suddenly, the game opens up with the addition of fighters and space dogfights. Easily the middle section is the best, hunting down bounties, destroying space stations and investigating mysterious wormholes. But then suddenly it all blows up in your face at the end, as you are in the middle of fighting the other space-faring nations as the leader of your faction. The ending of the game completely destroys pacing and ruins it for me; the horrible, ceaseless battles against an overpowered enemy frustrating and tedious. 
So why do I still recommend this game? 
Because I enjoy the lore behind the game, for one. I like learning about the android Wyr, the militaristic Drone Unity, the human Free Nations and the Salvation's prophecy. 
Because the space battles are just so much fun when you are fighting an equally matched enemy, that doesn't come back every five minutes and drain your resources. 
Because the middle game is some of the most fun I've ever had with a space-faring game, and it checked many of the boxes I wanted from a game like this - to be a cog in the machine, to be involved in large-scale galaxy wars, to dive and twist and turn around, to fire missiles, to upgrade my ship, to be promoted, to become somebody. 
And so I do recommend this game, but it comes with a warning. 
The invasions at the end of the game take far too long to overcome, and their ceaseless repetition with barely any respite in between battles were rather irksome. But should you want an awesome dogfighter, a ground-warfare game, a game of galactic conquest, a game of occasional puzzle-solving, of alien-world delving, then Salvation Prophecy is right for you. 
I just wish I could recommend it more highly.

I did a few playthroughs with different races and it's clear that a lot of love went into this game. There are parts that definitely could've used more polish, but Salvation Prophecy is still an excellent mix of space combat and ground missions.

The game takes you between space and ground combat, both of which have offense and defense missions. There are primarily squad-based missions for the factions, but the main plot often has the player on a solo mission to explore a mysterious planet. There are also a chain of solo space missions for bounty-hunting. Later, as the player advances ranks within their faction, they can buy upgrades for their ship and eventually assume control of their faction. This lets the player order fleet and ground missions as well as build new buildings and space stations on conquered planets. 


[h1]Pros:[/h1]

--([b]Major[/b]) Space combat. While space stuff could be repetitive, it was overall very fun. The jump and wormhole mechanics made travel more interesting. It was an awesome feeling, being able to single-handedly take down an enemy capital ship and space station in the same mission once my squad had been killed.

--([b]Major[/b]) The ability to go from exploring my faction space station, jump in a ship, fly to another planet, land on it, meet new and interesting monsters, and kill them, in a 3rd person perspective. We seriously need more games like that.

--([b]Minor[/b]) Ship upgrades. I love games that let me upgrade vehicle stuff, and my only complaint here was that there weren't more choices or options. 

--([b]Minor[/b]) Some of the Salvation Prophecy storyline missions involve collecting runes with special powers that give the game a different twist beyond the usual sci-fi trope of simply getting bigger/better guns. Unleashing these runes on the very next ground mission was fun.

--([b]Minor[/b]) While all factions have mostly decent dialogue with occasional fun, the Wyr faction in particular has some great moments here.


[h1]Cons:[/h1]
--([b]Major[/b]) Ground combat. It often seemed a bit clunky and the races felt poorly balanced. For example in most ground missions, fighting the humans or killer robots was easy, but fighting against the blue all-female race that could steal life energy as a ranged attack was much harder (however [i]playing[/i] as the all-female race was a blast). 

--([b]Minor[/b]) Would've liked to see more mission types beyond a simple offense/defense on space and ground, and the bounty hunter chain. The prophecy plotline took care of this sometimes, but still could've used more variety in the faction missions.

--([b]Minor[/b]) The interior layout of the space stations was exactly the same across all factions. While the stuff inside the space station was somewhat different for each faction, it seemed a bit unrealistic that they'd all have the same map, with the exact same NPC jobs in each place. As such, once you know where your weapon vendor is for Race A, it will be in the exact same spot for the others. Definitely could have used more dev time to make the layouts feel unique to each faction.

--([b]Minor[/b]) Controls occasionally felt clunky. Worst was unstable wormholes, though maybe that was the entire point there.",1469671376,1469671591,True,5,0,0.579539775848388672,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Bit on the fence whether I should recommend from an objective (as much as possible) point of view, but its unique enough that the developer deserves more visibility. And from subjective point of view: I quite like it even though it gets repetive and has a tight budget (though the price is ofcourse also lower than an AAA game). The game is set in space and on planets / stations and there is a mass war between 4 factions (humans, aliens, robots and more aliens I think). You can pick a faction to fight for.

You begin relative weak and really need to stick with your teammates early on in land battles (1 faction attacks an enemy's base with troops) aswell as space battles (1 faction attacks an enemy's station with ships). While doing faction missions and lateron optional bounty hunt quests (the bounties are in space), you gain money which you can invest in newer weapons, armor, chargeables (like stimpacks or speed boosters) or ship upgrades. Though there are not many unique weapons and basically only 1 armor (most are just better versions). Its still a fun cute rpg addition.
Lateron in the game, get more main quests which are a bit different and you gain runes which will give you extra abilities (like stopping time for a while). Though it would have been better if you would get these abilities sooner and if there would be more different rewards from doing missions (like chosing between a few passive rewards).

On land the gameplay itself is mostly hip-fire (which is fine and comes down to matter of taste) combined with some explosive weapons and some meleeing and some chargeables. It feels a bit stiff but I think its fun for short game sessions. In space you control a fighter ship and fire energy weapons, missiles and some more goodies like a turbo and counter measures. I personally think the space combat is a bit wooden so I find it less fun, but others might prefer that. Is it nice for a change of pace though. One annyoing thing of space battles is that you need to travel a tad to long before arriving at your destination and you need to go through wormholes and hyperspace avoiding stuff that could damage you (at first its okay but since you will be doing alot of battles, it will get annoying).  

Though where I think this game really shines in, is that it does give you a feeling that a war is going on. You feel you are a soldier working its way up the ranks within a faction up to commander rank (giving you some extra options to chose where to attack and what to build etc). Its also just feels cool to fight in big battles with your AI teammates.

My score: between 6,5 and 7,5. A sequel would have alot of potential and I hope the dev goes for it.",1468791066,1468836391,True,2,0,0.511316895484924316,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you think so, you probably won't enjoy Salvation Prophecy very much.

If, however, you're with me in believing that each game's merits should be carefully (even painstakingly) considered ALONE, based on how much was accomplished given its limitations, then this title deserves your attention.

Salvation Prophecy mixes genres fluidly and frequently. You'll engage in ship-to-ship combat in space, storm enemy planets filled with bizarre and violent aliens, and strategically select which territories to take over (as in a turn-based strategy game). Hell, just moving from system to system requires you to play a movement mini-game which, while certainly not deep, is an innovative alternative to the boredom of a loading screen. There's even a plot in there somewhere if you pay attention. It's not the most complex thing in the world, but it provides a backdrop of mystery that really kept me interested. 

This is a budget game, with the drawbacks you'd expect from that. The graphics were outdated when the game was new, the animation is rigid and sometimes hilariously bad, and the writing is, for the most part, so-so. That's all okay, though, because you don't approach this kind of game expecting the highest production value. Approach it expecting a varied, somewhat experimental experience with more character than most big-name IPs of the last six years and you'll get a lot out of it. Add to that the fact that you're helping support a small developer, and it's a total win.

Gets a little repetitive and the strategy portion is bareboned, but the space combat is really fun with some of the best flight controls I've ever used. Works flawlessly with a gamepad.

Despite the repetitiveness, the game is quite short if you complete the story missions as they come. But, with 4 different factions to play it packs a bit of replayability, although after your first playthrough, there are no more surprises, since there isn't really much difference between the factions beyond some aesthetics, except for one faction that gets the ability to construct turrets during planetary invasions.

The strategy portion, which doesn't unlock until mid-game leaves a lot to be desired. First, you can only attack from one station at a time and you must be docked at that station. When your stations or planets are attacked, there's no warning, and you will only find out about it after the fact on the news. The factions are all evenly matched, the planets alll have the same amound of buidlings and units, all stations have the same amount of ships, so who wins or loses these battles is a crap-shoot. Of course if you are at a station that is under attack you are given the opportunity to board your ship and defend the station, which will heavily put the odds in your favour.

As commander, when you launch an attack you must also participate in it, which means you can only ever fight one battle at a time. You can't send troops to attack one planet, while you attack another.

A: some sort  of creative and lame 4x.

Creative and lame?

A: yeah. As i said, there are some nice concepts that work immersion wise, like well placed minigames, a constant feed of news and a cliché but solid lore. However, what the game gives with one hand it takes with another:

 + deep immersion potential
 - not much to be immersed with

+character progession
- it is linear as fuck

+Racial diversity
-unless you are a die harder, the game style rewards a specific faction while punishes the others. specially late game

+a whole galaxy to conquer
- the way the war works makes it look like a sophisticated war tug, making fighting pointless as time goes by

+build stations and colonize planets
- it does not make any sense in game. they are all built like magic the moment you ask them to, regardless of the distance of the rest of your planets. Hell, you can build a station orbiting an enemy colony (?????)

+ real time tech up on the galaxy, making the battles more intresting with more elements
- they stop happening way too soon and in the end of the day, it just makes the battles last longer

+space dog fighting and planetary invasion
- fun until certain point ( 10 hours in game id say) after that it is all mechanical and pointless

Скажу сразу - фанаты графики и эпичного сюжета - проходите мимо.
Что понравилось:
Игра подкупает своей простотой - на первых парах главное добежать до десантного корабля для высадки или до своего истребителя в ангаре - вылетел/высадился и круши врагов.
Понравились гипер-прыжки с уворотами.
Простота покупок апгрейдов не заставляла заморачиваться, а вдруг куплю что-то не то, а потом буду жалеть - просто покупал что было необходимо и на что хватало денег и в бой.
И сначала игра вообще не напрягала, но когда только что отбитую территорию захватывали враги и Вас не позвали на защиту - было обидно.
Не понравилось:
Графика - для игры 2013 года игра выглядет старше лет на 5
Сюжет - его толком и нет и он не поджимает строгостью прохождения, пока не открываются порталы пришельцев и устав от постоянных налетов/набегов инопланетян - плюешь на все и понимаешь что пора выполнять сюжет.
Чего не хватает:
Безусловно - кооператив добавил бы в игру фана, но он бы уперся в небольшую вселенную, где сильно не разгуляешься.
Больше вещей, корабли на продажу, торговля, задания на планетах союзников (фракций с которыми заключен мир).

It has an amazing concept, a really good storyline with two distinct endings, and plenty of great lore. However, I can't like it. The beginning of the game? Awful. It's mostly grindy, you feel very not powerful, and the like. The middle? Amazingly fun, complex tactical simulation. The ending? Tedious, and even more grindy than the beginning. Without spoiling anything, you can spend the entire game carefully building up an entire empire only to watch it be tore down, with little you can do. Some of the most fun I've had in recent gaming history has been in the middle section of this game, but I honestly don't feel like I can recommend it.

In addition to my other hesitations, the game is very glitchy. There are also missions exclusive to sections of the game, with know way of knowing in advance which missions will vanish. I had to replay the campign just to get some achievements that I missed because I didn't realize the missions would be inaccessible later. The graphics are also wanting, with absolutely no customization available -- and it definitely feels like it's missing.

Overall, Salvation Prophecy is an amazing attempt. I feel like if it had been given the funding it needed, it could have become an amazing game, similar in caliber to the other space epics but distinct, bringing its own unique perspective on the space sim.

This game is possibly one of the most overlooked jewels among indie titles on tiny budgets. 

I totally recommend it for purchase if you are in space rpg + space fighter combo games. 
Totally worth supporting developer, this one was created on a very thin budget and it shows - Salvation Prophecy is a jewel, but rough around the edges.

Let me give you a quick summary:

Graphics:
- Indie budgets shows right away. Textures are low res, location are reused, models are ridiculous sometimes. 
- Animations are hilarious

+ Space combat effects are decent
+ Very few obvious bugs to speak about
+ unique planetary missions have amazing locations

Sound:
- your own music recommended
- voice acting is ridiculous 
- actually not that many sound effects

+ doesn't get annoying
+ space travel effects amazing
+ no bugs detected
+ ambient sound effects help immersion 

Gameplay:
- simplistic in every area
- little choice of items, most useless
- difficult to understand why are you promoted to faction leader so soon
- otherwise unbalanced (AI and Aliens)
- land combat AI sucks (worst part of the game actually)
- shallow story line, some ridiculous moments especially with runes
- arcade minigames in warp tunnels and wormholes 

+ story is presented in interesting manner and despite being quite simple is properly explained and transparent, you can tell the reason for the ongoing war
+ missions. Mass fighter jumping in and out of combat is just the most amazing thing this game has (I say this as FreeSpace veteran)
+ simplified arcade combat - not necessary a good thing but at least it is made in proper way (does not annoy)
+ side missions, hilarious pirate descriptions
+ multiple aspects (well, not that many) of faction to manage
+ ending better than Mass Effect 3, despite very shitty final boss battle(considering mission length this battle is actually a good thing)
+ overal feeling and atmosphere is a combined shadow of Homeworld, FreeSpace and Mass Effect titles. It is quite simply good.


Conclusion:
Love and care is visible in each and every part of the title. It is properly done, relativelly bug free, not badly imbalanced jewel that makes it obvious - developers really wanted to deliver but were short on funds. These are the pople who seem to know what they are doing and where they are heading, just didn't head the means to make the journey.


You will not be disappointed if you get this game on sale, even tho it is short you will enjoy this.

For the content this game packs, it can be played through fairly quickly (took me about 12 hours, although I mostly neglected bounty hunting that run). Still, however, some parts of the game become repetitive quickly, and it is especially annoying that later in the game you still have to partake in the same kinds of missions you take on in the beginning. The only difference then basically is that you're in control of where these missions take place, but delegating (as you would expect to be able in a commanding position) is not a thing here.

Story-wise the game is very linear and simple, but that's okay. The only irks I have with the storyline are that towards the end it often takes longer than necessary for the next story mission to show up.

It will drive you nuts but not nuts enough to not buy the game (for a sale price of course :).

The tutorial first and fore most is great. Absolutely, it will walk the gamer through everything you need to know and will even politely say where to go next. 

As stated, this game is essentially STO. You are able to walk around your station (and other planets) and participate in raids or a take over of a planet. There are two aspects to the game : 3rd person over the shoulder and controlling a spaceship. The spaceship aspect is pretty cool as you get to be in control of space jumps. There will be missions where the player will need to travel quite a distance in a short period of time. This is done by initiating wormholes or the jump drive. This in itself is a mini-game that could potentially make the game better, or drive someone nuts. The player is also able to take part in major fleet missions involving destroying another rivals space station. This game is very controller friendly and make navigating through wormholes and warp jumps easy. This game does a good job allowing you to control exactly where you go - however some may find wormholes and the warp jumps annoying. Armor, stim packs, and even weapons for your character become modifiable. You are also able to choose between 4 races. 

I got this game as a gift and would likely only buy on sale. I would rather play Star Trek Online though as I feel it has more depth to it. This game tries but that little extra freedom of being able to walk around your own ship or wherever is not there. The gameplay itself (movement and action) is alright at best. A lot more could have been done in these regards. I mean cmon, you get to invade a planet!

- охота на пиратов (пусть и не разнообразная, но всё же)

I imagine certain aspects of the game would get repeatative if that's what you focused on but the real beauty of the game is the diversity of play.  I've had a good mix of gameplay so far.  Huge land battles assaulting enemy ground installations, space battles assaulting space stations, exploring alien planets on foot, and hunting down dangerous pirates in space.

Most recently I've achieved the highest rank and opened up some of the 4X style gameplay.  I'm now able to allocate resources towards colony and fleet building as well as dictate where and when my faction will strike next.  THIS is where the game truly gets awesome.

Early on I enjoyed the diverse missions but got a little frustrated with how stupidly my faction would chose targets.  We lost a lot of ground that way.  We'd lose colonies, lose space stations while I was on other missions.  It did however add to a sense of urgency to the gameplay.

At first I didn't like that galactic events happened realtime, but after putting in a number of hours it's become one of the better features in my opinion.  It adds life to the game; if you sit on your hands and do nothing, your faction's holdings will be crushed.  I get to really see my contribution in a way no other game I've played is able to show.

The fact that the game was developed by only one guy merit my money and the 6 hours I got out of it I did not regret, BUT I would not recommend this game for the general mass, I think you really need to know with what you messing with.

Though at first the game looks interesting because of all the progression you can make you will end up maxing everything in 5-6 hours at which point the game starts to lose it charm.

So you start as a soldier who must obey his faction leader's orders. After each successful mission you get rank points and credits and sometimes badges that gives you bonus credits.Missions are 3 kinds. Land attack as a soldier, Space attack/defense on your spaceship. Land attacks are boring,you as a soldier must upgrade your skills and gear while the defender can have turrets,fliers and even mech and in numbers both sides are equal. 20v20 soldiers ... and defender got bonus toys. Space battles are fun for most of the time. 20v20 spaceships and defender got the his base with turrets and a battleship. In both fights attacker got less toys but wins most of the time. Sadly all this gets boring after you do ~20 of each fights.

GAME LACKS DEPTH! Which is the main cause to get boring/repetetive. As Droid I had only 3 weapons to use - blaster,claw and missle launcher. There are skills for your guy but you can max them quite fast. There is no specialization to make the game a bit more interesting. Everything looks the same because of lack of customization. Even when you reach the rank of Faction Commander you still look like everybody else in your faction.

I was hoping to see in the game option to gather a squad of 3-4 droids from my faction and go hunt bounty targets but nope,you are all by yourself.

Unstable Wormholes were nice but when I got to check 4th one I simply stopped playing because just the end part of the mission is different : check the wurmhole,dream about the planet and the animals on it, wait for cartographer to upgrade your ship and check the planet.

I thought when I reach the rank of Faction Commander the game will be a bit more interesting... Was I wrong... As FC you can build stations,colonies and order attack, no attacks, an attack because you need to take part in the attack. You can't order several attacks and pick one to join in,you cant send troops to support stations/colony that will be attacked and to order an attack you have to be on station from which you gonna launch the attack.

Overall I can't really recommend the game unless you feel like doing the same thing over and over again. The game doesnt make you feel important with the lack of customization.It just makes you one of the mass.",1411728291,1411728291,False,19,1,0.605067014694213867,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- It looks amazing.
- It's incredibly fun. You get a real sense of immersion through upgrading your character and progressing, beating more and more drek out of the enemy.

The bad:
- Sometimes the spaceflight missions are dauntingly hard if you don't know the ""trick"" (spoiler: the trick is mostly going straight for the station's turrets, then the station), leaving you with a derpish AI squad whose main speciality is hurling themselves against turret fire and dying, and not much support in the battle.
- Many of the rooms in your home battle cruiser seem empty and not well-designed; the battle command room is the size of a gymnasium and mostly empty except for two guys. Kinda weird.

It's definitely unpolished, but unique and interesting in it's own way.  If you're looking for a really smoooth, AAA title, you might want to look elsewhere, but I had a lot of fun with Salvation.

The game is basically a war game.  You choose to play as a soldier in one of four factions, but the gameplay structure is the same for all four.  Starting out in a space station that functions as a shop / hangar / communication hub, you get missions that fall in to one of two types: on foot, or in space.  The ""on foot"" missions are pretty simplistic third person shooting sections where you run around a field and blow up buildings and enemies.  Each race has three weapons: a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special weapon (like an energy shield or a bomb launcher).  Space missions put you in the cockpit of your space fighter, and generally play like a simplified version of a space shooter, similar to something like Rogue Squadron or Strike Suit Zero.

The game is technically open world in that you can go anywhere, land on any planet and walk around, but since there's a war happening in real-time in the background, there's not a lot of time to explore.  Completing missions gets you rank points (which give you promotions to advance your career) and money, which you use to upgrade your gear for the ""on foot"" sections and your spaceship.  You can also get skill points to level up your character.  However, there isn't a lot of customization here.  Each faction has only one character model, which you can't change (humans can choose a few different skin tones), and one spaceship model, which also never changes.  You can't even change your name, as far as I could find, even though it's just a text string.  And while you can level up your character, you'll generally get all the upgrades in the game in one playthrough.  This isn't inherently a bad thing, just bear in mind that you won't be able to, say, play a stealthy commando one run and a patient sniper the next or anything.

Moment to moment gameplay tends to be pretty shallow.  The ""on foot"" sections are pretty straightforward, just move the cursor over the enemy, hold the trigger, and use a healing item when you get low on health.  Space combat is pretty similar, although movement is slightly more complicated, you're still just pounding on enemy shields and popping a shield recharging item when yours get low.  Annoyingly, enemies also get health/shield restoring items, meaning that a lot of fights tend to be drawn out affairs where you beat an enemy down to five or ten percent health and he pops a potion and heals back to 100, so you beat him down to five or ten percent again and he pops a potion and heals back to 100, so you beat him down again, and so on, until he runs out of regen items.  It's pretty basic stuff, but it does get the job done.

Once you get to max rank, you become your faction's leader, and can direct where you want attacks to focus on, as well as what buildings to build on colonies and so on.  This isn't as game changing as it sounds, though, because you can't really control if you win or lose a battle except by going there and killing everyone yourself, and since you can't have more than one attack going at once, you may as well join in on the battle anyway.  However, enemies can still attack your bases while you're out, so progress tends to be irregular.  You may get back from conquering one planet only to find you've lost two somewhere else.  Or, sometimes, none, since the AI's decision making seems to be random instead of adhering to a specific strategy or anything.  The endgame does get a bit annoying, too.  Story events basically negate the progress you made in the game up to that point, and the challenge ramps up, except ""challenge"" in this game means massive waves of enemies with titanic health pools that take forever to burn through.

But I don't want to exaggerate the negatives, this game is a lot of fun, especially early on.  You advance in rank fast, earning new abilities and upgrades fairly quickly, but never so quickly that you feel overwhelmed.  The UI is clunky and ugly, but straightforward and easy to learn.  And one of the really great things this game does is gives a sense of scale: you're usually going in to combat with 20 other allies, so you feel like a small part of a large team, rather than some unbeatable lone wolf, which is a neat feeling.  On those occasions when you do have to do something solo, that aspect always made it feel special to me, making that jump without a swarm of allies around me felt more dramatic and tense because of their absence.

In terms of graphics and sound, this game is pretty inconsistent, as indie titles often are.  There are a few good bits, a lot of the models look fairly nice.  But as a whole, the art direction is hit and miss, there are issues with lighting and materials, the environments are very low detail, and so on.  Outer space is full of asteroids and fights take place at point-blank range, making the galaxy feel small and cramped, while ground fighting is almost all on a slightly hilly outdoor map with few decorations or geological features making it feel barren and empty.  The UI, as I mentioned above, is functional, but clunky to use (especially if you have to use it in combat) requiring a lot of extra clicks and wasting a lot of space.  Animations are inconsistent, with some of them being fairly good (the sexy swagger of a Salvation officer) some of them being really bad (the derpy run cycle of a Drone Unity soldier) and a lot of them being flat out missing (like any kind of forward diagonal movement animation, your character just animates like he's running straight forward and drifts to the side).  The audio is serviceable, but doesn't really stand out.  The game does run at a nice framerate, though, and never crashed or ran in to any other technical problems during my playthrough.

Overall, this is almost a poster child for indie titles.  The lacklustre graphics and shallow gameplay are made up for by the fact that this game tries to produce an experience that's mostly fun and unique.  It's full of issues that a larger studio could probably have fixed, but the quirky nature of it's core gameplay produces an experience that a more polished title probably wouldn't match.  Overall, I can't recommend it to everyone, but I definitely had a lot of fun with this game.

I like the mix of linear campaign structure versus quasi-open sandbox, though there aren't really many different mission types; pretty much everything boils down to shooting in space or on land. Even the ""acid-trip missions"" end up being little else.

But the sense of achievement and growth as you progress through the ranks is palpable, the options for using different stims and perks on land and equipment in space are enjoyable, and it doesn't really get old. It's definitely a game you can pick up for twenty minutes and play a quick mission or two and put down again.

It's fair criticism that the graphics aren't fantastic and the game is repetitive, but it's clearly a low-budget effort and packs a lot more fun than its tiny asking price suggests. I think I picked it up on sale for something like $4.99, and I've already enjoyed ten-plus hours with it before even beginning what I suspect is the end-game final conflict phase.

In short, it's a lot more fun than I thought it would be and highly recommend it for those who like sci-fi FPS or space combat games.

Lots of stuff.  You start off as a run-of-the-mill GROPO taking part in planetary invasions as directed by your higher authority.  As you rank up you're given a fighter so that you can take part in space missions.  You buy your upgrades, there's some minor customization on how you get to the end of each faction's 'tech tree'.  At some point you'll become the faction commander.  Now you get to decide where to send your fighters and grunts.

All in all.  I had a lot of fun for the 15 hours (currently) I've put into it.  It's a little of everything.  Some base building, some rpg, some third person shooter, some space combat.  The game makes sense it what's it's trying to do.  You want to colonize a planet to get more resources for your faction.  You need to invade the current owners colony and wipe it out first.  Before you can wipe out the colony you need to clear space station and fighters in orbit.  But before you can do that you have to launch the spae invasion fleet from one of your own space stations.  But you have to build the fighters even before that.

Okay, don't get intimidated.  It makes sense.  Build your fighters.  Point em at the enemy and launch.  Go with em to make sure they win.  Come back and launch the grunts.  Go with em to make sure they win too.  (Note, as far as I could tell you will never establish numerical superiority--which would be negative for me).  Then build the colony, get it's resources and repeat.

Gripes.  Each part of the game has it's own gripes.  When I'm launching an invasion fleet, why can't I luanch multiple invasion fleets from different areas?  Your soldiers/pilots who go with you do their own thing.  You can't give them objectives.  You can't ever esrtablish numerical superiority, even if by launching invasion forces from different stations.  THere are more, but I can't think of them at the moment.  But it comes down to the focus.  Because the focus is wide, it doesn't neccessarily do each part of the game as polished as it could be.

Big Gripe:  I played with a controller and two things really irked me.  
1)The controls were a bit weird.  A B Select and Start didn't follow their usual functions.  As in, A (bottom middle button) = accept/forward, B (far right button) = cancel/back, Select = in-game menu, start = global menu.  Salvation Prophecy has it to be A=Accept/forward/use, B = accept/forward, select = back, global menu, start = in-game menu.  Also, no dedicated button to missles and emp? (missile defense)
2)When you accept a call/mission in the fighter it does not pause the game (no gripe there) but it does slow you down to a crawl while you try and figure out why someone keeps calling you every 5 seconds while you're in the middle of a dogfight...which, btw, if you accept said call in the middle of a dogfight you run an 80-90% chance of dying.
I have no idea if this holds true for the Mouse/Keyboard controller options.

Graphics are dated but not so bad as to detract from the story and what it is you're trying to do.  The map is kind've small, the tech tree is kind've short, there aren't many weapons to choose from, the upgrades for your fighters are kind've short...

Through all that, I still really like this game.  While it doesn't do any one thing stellar, taken all together it's a fantastic game.  I hope the developer at some point in the future makes a sequel.",1400454220,1400454220,True,3,0,0.500177085399627686,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As the game goes on the enemies and enemy buildings/turrets/etc become stronger and take more shots to kill, increasing how tedious everything is. 

After you reach max level and become the leader of your race, you can command attacks on enemy bases and space stations, which you personally have to lead. You can only command one action at a time, which causes everything to move extremely slowly, and you can't combine the forces of multiple stations.

The enemy AI isn't that great either, once you power your ship up enough you can repeatedly do attack runs on the enemy station practically unmolested and win the battle while everyone else is flying around shooting each other. Enemy ships don't seem to target you or try to follow you, they just seem to shoot at you if there's nothing else nearby to shoot at. The ground missions aren't a whole lot better, other than the targeting on the enemy turrets is so bad you can just keep slowly strafing and they'll never hit you.

Beat it 4 times on full hard\autaims off, 2 more - spared the final couple hours for the nearest future to avoid killing the final bunch of bots too often, and at least two more times are about to happen soon.
And all done by now only took about 2\3 of time on my record. Yet i wouldn't say it's too short, it's just about optimal time expenditure.
There are 4 diffirent competing playable factions(differed by weapons and skills), one major enemy showing up at the end. All gameplay is nice tough fast-paced action on land and in space(on fightercraft). Completing missions and helping allies brings cash and exp. points(both depending in rate on how well you perform) to develop your skills, improve your space fighter ship and buy better weapons. Minimum dialogues and other waste of time. The story is simple yet rather abstract than dull, and you actually don't care about it, waiting or looking for the next bunch of enemies to deal with.
Besides, flying spacecraft includes two mini-game-like processes when moving at long distances.
All this game's missing i'll easily find in many others yet i can't even remember a game to compare with what it possesses of. It's rather meditation than just a gameplay.
The game's very well made. Nice picture, nice controls, no bugs, nice balance on full hard.

It's an indy with the ambition of a AAA. It succeeds in some its goals, fails in others, and yet I somehow still have to give an approve (if barely) for this game. It has a charm to it, sort of that 90's early 2000 charm to it.

-Story is paced way too fast
-Upgrades and weapons are stupidly linear

    Now I admit, I was hooked at first and the idea and concept of it was amazing to me that you could work your way up from a grunt to faction commander. So amazed that I immediately spent my money on it blindly, just [i]hoping[/i] I would get something good out of it atleast. For a good while I most certainly did. However, the game becomes too simple and boring very quickly: There is one gun type, one soldier type, and one spaceship type, [i]and thats it[/i]. There is no variation in this game at all. The only variation are the different races which all are basically the same thing with the same progression, but different abilites, statistics, and some different models. There is just no substance at all to this game, and it leaves you wanting so much more to every [i]single[/i] aspect of it.

     All the ground battles are essentially the same ground battle with varied models, and sometimes they just reuse the same models for different things. Space combat is the same thing essentially, though I admit it is fun for awhile because its got some neat mechanics. Theres somewhat of a fake sense of progression to it that bases get upgrades and ships get upgrades but once all the upgrades are upgraded it is once again just bland. The epic story-line makes it exciting for awhile but then once you get past all the prophecy nonsense its just this really bland game with terrible animations and it just feels half-baked. I'm not the kind of person who cares much about graphics either, its better to have great gameplay and terrible graphics I always say, but this game doesnt have either. The only thing interesting about the gameplay like I said was the prophecy story-line which has a bunch of puzzles, and a nice little sense of discovery that made you feel like you were unearthing something nobody ever knew about, but all it ammounts to is some more half-baked abilities to aid ground battles.

     Once you get past the main gimic of the ranking system and you make it to faction-commander you realize just how boring this game is: Being faction commander is not really any different than being the lowest on the totem pole. You don't get to create or leave your own mark on anything in this game, you dont get to customize your character, you dont get to build bases, or try different strategies in battle. Nope. The only thing you get to do as faction commander is tell your guys where to have their next monotonous ground or space battle, which you still have to go fight and essentially win for them by yourself. You dont even get to make a larger fleet of troops or ships, nope just what you've always been fighting with, that or less, which why on earth would you ever want to do that? You dont even get to command your troops in battle, except for telling them to make a retreat.

     No customer service what-so-ever either, no updates, nope this is considered a ""finished product"" though it doesnt feel finished at all. You won't be getting any more out of your 20 bucks than the crap thats already on the table with this one.

My opinion? Don't waste your money. You can take in all this game has to offer from the screenshots above, and actually playing it wont get you very much more out of it.",1393315825,1393315825,False,30,1,0.675932228565216064,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The execution is poor.

In the shooter portions of the game you will be riding a dropship down to a planet's surface and killing the opposing force. The foot controlls w,a,s,d to move, right click to aim (no over the shoulder here, it just makes your reticule appear) and left click to shoot. That's it. No crouch, no cover mechanic, just trading fire until you or your opponent die. There are slight variations in the different races weaponry, but their skill trees are all the exact same.

dogfights are the better portion of the game. You can fight using three weapons, laser fire, missles, and emp bursts which destroy incoming missles. The fighting is intense and challenging. The real problem with the ship combat is the navigation. to jump from area to area in the game you will need to warp and use black holes. warping is a mini-game in which you will be avoiding electric beams that do damage to your ship. black holes have you flying through a tunnel and avoiding the sides, operation style. often you will have to navigate two or three of each to get to your mission. The black holes are the most frustrating as damage is unavoidable and and you will need to use your healing items before a battle even starts.

The strategy portion of the game I never got to and before you cry foul let me explain the ranking system in the game. You will start out as the lowest ranking in your military installation only being able to do shooter missions. after doing a couple of those you will rank up and have access to  star fighter missions and exploration. There are about ten ranks in the game and the very last rank is the one that gives you access to the strategy portions. I am about 4 hours in and have moved up to about rank three. The strategy missions could be the most amazing thing to happen to gaming, but I would have to wade through at least 5 more hours of mediocrity to get there.

Salvation Prophecy is a prime example of how music and sound can make or break a game. It's essentially a military space fighter, turned military space strategy/shooter about halfway through. You choose your faction, have a few fights, go and collect these relics through these very boring special missions and then take over as commander of your faction and subsequently beat everyone else up.

When I first started with the drones, there was no music. When I fought on a planet, there was one track. When I fought in space, it played what sounded like idle space music, not epic space music. The voiceovers spoke at the speed of cabbage. The single laser gun sound effect became very jarring, very quickly and I fought melee alot, just so I didn't have to hear that sound. To put it bluntly, the audio was awful.

But that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the space battles. The overall idea was good and executed well, although more detail in the strategy portion of the game would have been nice. The effects and little minigame when warping somewhere were actually really effective and I never found myself growing tired of jumping.

I notice you only played the game for a short time (<1 hour).  I understand that if you don't like a game, you probably aren't going to keep playing it.

But I wanted to comment on ""affecting the completion of the mission"".  It is true, when you start the game, you are a fresh recruit, who really isn't powerful enough to make much of a difference.  However, as you increase in rank and power, this dramatically changes.  The outcome of battles absolutely hinges on your character.

This was intentional.  The idea of the game is to journey from a newly recruited soldier grunt, to a powerful commander of your entire faction.  In my (biased) opinion, this is one of the things that makes the game interesting.  However, I understand that some players may desire, or be used to being a super-powerful hero in the games they play.  In Salvation Prophecy, you have to earn that.

I hope you find games more to your liking in the future, and thank you for trying the Salvation Prophecy.

The Mount and Blade-like dynamic war is innovative, but doesn't really mean anything as the races tend to keep a stalemate until you reach the faction commander level.

I'm sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the game, but I respect the way you wrote up your critiques.  I'd like to share a couple thoughts I had while reading it.

The lack of the lead reticle was intentional.  Early on, I experimented with having one (it's a very simple thing to program).  Here's why I took it out.  A lot of space sims devolve into a ""chase the circle with the X (crosshair)"" game.  What I really dislike about that is your attention is drawn away from the 3D graphics and the overall scene in front of you.  Instead, you spend most of your time staring at that little circle and X.  I feel a lot more immersed in the game without it.

The radar just kinda ended up being a noisy blob with the large scale of the space battles - I thought good targeting functionality along with the off-screen target pointer worked better.  Although I can understand this being a controversial decision among experienced space sim vets.

It is also intentional that the 4 factions tend towards a stale-mate until the player reaches faction commander.  If your faction was hopelessly weak or excessively overpowered by the time you reached commander, it just wouldn't be fun.  Similarly, if other faction(s) were obliterated by the time you took over, this would make for a less interesting war scenario for you to inherit.

Thanks for your complement on the writing.  It does cross into the gameplay portions through the prophecy storyline - the series of missions through unstable wormholes to alien planets.  But I agree the faction warfare which makes up the majority of the game is purely combat oriented.

Graphics from 2006 - that sounds about right actually.  Indies do what we can, but cutting edge 3D graphics takes a lot of money.

I appreciate your comments NSA.  I thought it might be useful to other potential players to see my game design ideas behind some of this stuff.

The mechanics are the same as all the other spaceflight sims, FPS, womholes, and starjumps are included as required space sim memes.  So far the conversations are weak.  One actually used the word schnizit when we were going to attack as a fleet.  It's not nearly as complicated as the previously mentioned games.

When I first started playing this game I thought it would be the game I had long waited for.  A space type game where you both command and fight, both in space and land.  Although it wasn't quite what I had hoped it to be after playing for a little while, I still enjoyed the concept, and enjoyed playing it.  When I became the faction leader I proceeded to concentrate on expanding my Empire while gradually destroying my enemies.  I was doing really good, and then came the alien invasion.  From that point forward it was a full time struggle just to survive and rebuild against their attacks while waiting for the storyline to continue.  But I thought to myself, ""Well, once I destroy the alien invasion I can go back to finishing the game by defeating my opponents"", and decided to see the alien invasion as a good late game variable as it did cause powers to shift, and even allow one faction that was all but destroyed to make a comeback.  So I procedeed to follow the storyline which led to the solo attack against the alien mothership, which took about 4 attempts, then landed on the alien homeworld and defeated the ""Boss"" alien.  And then the game ended, apparently with me sacraficing my life to destroy the alien homeworld.  So really, once the alien invasion occured, the only objective left in the game is to survive long enough to defeat the alien mothership and Boss on the alien homeworld.  Because of this, I was left very disapointed, since the game turned from a changing dynamic of a power struggle to defeat everybody else, to a very narrow storyline of survive long enough for the final battle that ends the game.  Overall, would not recomend this game.",1386823302,1386825301,False,117,3,0.639981865882873535,7,True,False,False,False,,1391336183.0,"Hi Wild Dog -
I'm glad to hear you (mostly) enjoyed the game.  It seems like the alien invasion is the main reason for your down vote. Fair enough!  The game combines sandbox and story, and the exact blend won't be right for everyone.

A couple notes:

1. The game can easily be modded (1 file, 1 setting) such that the alien invasion never occurs.

2. True, the alien invasion is a changing dynamic, where everything you have worked for is put to the test in a frenzied ""crescendo of destruction"". The battles against the alien mothership and on the alien home world push your skills to a deeper level than any other battle in the game. For many people, this is a more satisfying challenge than simply continuing the ongoing battle between the factions.

3. Before (and during) the alien invasion, you can still destroy, submit, or join forces with the other factions, depending on how dominant your own faction is.  The alien invasion just makes everything a little more... complicated.  ;)

Thanks for sharing your thoughts."

Primo il doit y avoir une fin alternative, j'ai pas sauvegarder avant de choisir ce que je voulais spécialement donc si jamais je le finit en mode méchant il faudra que je recommence tout en mode gentil.
Le jeu est un bon simulateur de dog fight, vraiment pas simple.
en premier défaut, vous avez un générateur de bouclier et des boucliers, sauf que le générateur ne remonte pas le bouclier tout seul au fil du temps,  vous devez ""l'actionner"" pour qu'il vous les remette à plein régime, mais sachez que même avec l'évolution maximum vous ne pourrez les recharger que 15 fois, passé ce point s'en est finit de vous. (retenez bien ça.)
les armes ... ou plutot devrais-je dire L'arme de votre vaisseau est bof, vous ne pouvez tirer que pendant quelques secondes d'affillées avant de tomber à court d'énergie pour votre vaisseau, ce qui signifie plus de maneaouvre d'évitement, problématique me direz-vous pour un dog fight. (retenez bien ça)
l'emp qui sert à dégager les missile ennemi est pas mal faite, mais si j'ai eut un peu de mal au début ça marche du tonerre, le problème est que l'on en a que 40. (retenez bien ça)
le truc hyper cool a acheter comme début d'amélioration est la balise de téléportation car ça évite de fastidieux voyage.
les combats sur les planètes sont ... moyen, c'est sur ça change mais bon ... bof quoi, si vous n'avez pas prit la race drone, disposant de maxi blindage et maxi arme, mais comme moi les androides qui ont maxi blindage mais arme moyenne et vitesse moyenne et qui ont par contre maxi spécial ... AH parlons en du spécial. l'androide peux poser sur le cham de combat des tourelles, au nombre de 3 maximum à la fois elles fournissent un support pendant la prise d'objective en dézinguant tout ce qui passe à porter, sauf les batiments. Ca c'est sur le papier, en vrai vous posez vos trois tourelles, qu'il faut acheter je précise pour un maximum de 30 dans l'inventaire, chaque coup de la tourelle fait baisser la vie de l'ennemi de 1%, l'ennemi baise la tourelle en quelques secondes. Cherchez l'erreur ... et ce sont pas les autres armes des droides qui font la différence, un tir de mortier ... OMG jamais vu plus pourri, quand vous vous battez contre des cibles mobiles ou même retranchée voilà ce qu'il faut faire, se planquer dans un coin en espérant qu'il viennent pas au cac, viser la zone avec la souris et appuyer longuement sur la touche feu puis relacher. Maintenant dans le jeu ça donne quoi, vous visez l'ennemi le réticule vous dit qu'il est a 70 mètre, tant que vous maintenant le bouton feu enfoncé la distance à laquelle vous envoyez votre projectile augmente jusqu'à un maximum de 230m sauf que pendant le même temps où vous devez précisément lire le compteur afin de pas dépasser la position ennemi il faut aussi la viser. Encore se serai pas TROP DUR si les ennemis était immobile ... mais non, les ennemis ils bougent, donc on se dit qu'on va garder ça contre les batiments, puis on se rend compte que le temps de viser et prévoir la porté puis lancer et attendre que ça tombe, on fait autant de dégat si on sort le flingue et qu'on tire sur le batiment. Sans dec quoi ... En plus si un ennemi a 200m décide de vous attaquer il vous touchera toujours, ce qui n'est pas forcément votre cas. donc bon ça part d'une bonne idée mais c'est gaché par manque de testeur intelligents. Je reviens au dog fight.
Qui dit combat spatiaux dit vaisseaux à acheter ou à gagner via des quetes, en effet notre premier vaisseau on nous le donne grâce à une quete, SAUF QUE c'est le seul et unique vaisseau du jeu que vous aurez à votre disposition, donc même une fois upgradé vous ne pourrez pas en changer. Au début on se dit merde sont stupide ou quoi, puis on voit que finalement avec les amélio ça tient la route ... SAUF QUE quand vous arrivez à la fin du jeu vous vous fightez contre des méchants aliens belliqueux, qui eux ont des vaisseaux du tonerre qui encaissent à mort et même si vous vous lancez à 20 contre 30, pour eux les 30 hein, vous finissez généralement tout seul, ou bien vous mourrez.
Vous pigez un peu le problème ?
Alors maintenant je vais vous dire pourquoi je n'ai pas finit le jeu.
Je suis à la mission finale, je gère un empire galactique, j'ai des centaines de troupes sous mon commandement, mais à chaque fois je ne peux envoyer que 20 troupe sur une seule mission à la fois pour faire un truc, donc je suis à la misssion finale et là, je dois y aller seul ... bon ok ... va falloir s'accrocher me direz vous. c'est courant ça l'empereur qui part tout seul sauver la galaxie dans un petit chasseur au lieu de prendre un cuirrassé lourd. M'enfoi soit ... je me retrouve en face du vaisseau mère ennemi ... à vue de nez ... mmm ... 200 fois la taille de mon vaisseaux .. ok. je le scann, alors un gros corps au millieu, trois pattes de chaque coté et environ une 30taine de tourelle ... ok ... j'ai une petite goutte de sueur mais ça va je gère. Je m'approche, fonce dessus plutot, y se passe rien, donc bon me dit on va attaquer les tourelles en premier au cas où. Pas de dégat ... ok ... bon on va viser les pattes ... BOUM ! Ah bah je suis mort je sais pas comment. Je reviens au checkpoint je me relance à l'assaut et attaque les pattes à coup de missiles cette fois ci, y en a que 20 ça a intéret d'assurer ... 0 dégat ... bon ... me reste plus que le coeur du vaisseau ... BOUM ! encore mort ... mais merde quoi c'est quoi ce délire je pige pas. j'y retourne et bien décider à égratigner cette monstruosité je fait feu de tout bois, missile laser je grille mes emp au cas où si y a un bouclier en face ... RIEN. BOUMMMM.
retour au check point je prend un instant de reflexion.
si je peux rien attaque sur la carcasse c'est qu'il doit y avoir une entrée ... un sourire nait sur mon visage alors que je me dit que j'ai été bête et que ça semblait tellement évident finalement. Ca ne peut-être que dessus ou dessous ... je fais les deux et chaque fois je crève sans comprendre.
NAN MAIS BORDEL DE MERDE !!!
Cette fois-ci je m'approche du vaisseau et je test la portée de mes missiles ... 40km niet. 30km nada. 20km no. 10km ... Et là je vois ... une pluie d'étoile filante partir du vaisseau et me foncer dessus. Non mon missile n'a pas fait effet, c'est juste qu'il fallait attendre que le truc fasse feu. Mais quand je dit pluie d'étoile filante ... c'est environ 15 000 obus que se truc est entrain de me tirer dessus, le terme ""tir de barrage"" prend tout son sens, impossible de passer au travers j'enclanche la postcombustion et je file a toute vitesse ... enfin ça se calme et je me retourne, et là je voit au top de la strucure des chasseurs ennemis.
Je me dit doit falloir dezinguer les chasseurs et voir ce qui se passe ensuite ... je le fait puis quand je me retourne vers le vx mère je vois qu'une patte est endommagée de 10%. YOUPI EUREKA j'ai trouvé ! j'ai compris et ce fut dur. Le reste ne sera qu'une formalité me dis-je ... naïvement. voilà le cycle :
1) tir de barrage
2) pop de 5-6 chasseur
3) 30 secondes de calme pour dégommer une papatte.

Vous vous rappelez ce que je vous ai dit au départ de cette recommandation. missilie limittés, armes qui pompe toute l'énergie, bouclier qui se régénère pas, emp limité... Il m'aura fallut 25 minutes pour dégommer une patte, me restait la moitié de mes emp seulement, à peine autant de recharge de bouclier, missile épuisés et je crève.

On pourrait croire que une patte dégommée = checkpoint non ?

bah non.

Mass Effect, Mount & Blade, and to a lesser degree Dynasty Warriors

The Good:

Varied gameplay mechanics that primarily focused on third person ground combat and space flight, but layers of strategy & RPG were there as well
Ground combat had a Mount & Blade/Dynasty Warriors feel to it, so the player would be fighting alongside his/her comrades in massive ground battles
Space flight and combat had a similar feel to the ground portions, but much more open and interesting 
Space travel was unique in its use of wormholes and hyperjumps, which were refreshing and a nice change of pace
When needing to get a far off area in space, “hyperjumping” gets you there faster through the use of a quite fun mini-game that involves avoiding electric bolts strewn across a tunnel (See image)
A similar mini-game is present when using “wormholes”, which require you to stay in the center of the tunnels without hitting the sides (See Image)
Four different character races that each have different looks, starting areas, ships, and equipment loadouts
An RPG progression system that rewards you with skill points for accomplishments in battle (both space & ground)
This allows the player to tailor their character to their specific play styles (offensive, defensive, etc…)
A giant living, breathing world with a deep backstory and lore
Conversation trees are welcome and add a bit of needed flavor to character interactions
Numerous choices and options that are not only present in character and story development, but also in the game interface
Character interactions are amusing and keep a sense of humor about them (I was reminded of GlaDOS during certain points of the tutorial)
Sound design is well done and helps to immerse the player in battles or space travels
The Bad:

The beginning of the game is not indicative of the full package
The player will spend a good thirty minutes of slogging through a mediocre tutorial/basic combat section that has a very “been there, done that” feel to it
Graphics are very dated and can really ruin the great immersion the story creates
Animation and physics when it comes to combat sequences is very limited
Example: explosions all look the same and do not have a physics engine behind the particles (at least it is perceived that way)
Example: the death animations on the ground combat sections are all the same as well, with no variation based on the chosen weapon or vehicle of death
Not enough variation in indoor textures
When traveling to different space stations it is not uncommon to see the same textures and/or room setups within the same race
It feels like the game tries to do too much in scope and would benefit on focusing on one of its styles (space combat was my personal favorite)
Can you play it while the children are awake?:

I think so.  With the dated graphics and basic death animations, the game didn’t scream inappropriateness to me.

Did I make time to complete it?:

I did not.  However, I found the scope and gameplay compelling and worth the time spent in the game world.  This small team should be proud of their ambitious project and I look forward to their future endeavours.

Star Wars: Battlefront 2's sandbox mode."" In this persuit there were some successes and some failures.

Successes:
In general, the game does a good job of making you feel like an important piece in your army, but not necessarily the whole army. If you work with your units rather than doing your own thing you'll be more successful, but it also seems at the end of every battle (especially land battles) that had you not been there, the odds of winning would have been zero.

The game takes a while to get warmed up, but once you reach ""Faction Commander"" status, some strategy elements become highly entertaining, Managing resources to create well-placed armies and defences is interesting, and working with or against the other factions is the best part of the game, in my opinion.

Space battles are fun, and upgrades for your ship really feel important and obvious (rather than some games where upgrades make such a minor difference you can hardly tell they've been installed). While the space battle system isn't completely intuitive to veteran space simulator pilots, its fairly easy to learn the new rules and becomes a new and interesting challenge. Furthermore, piloting your craft through wormholes and hyperspace turns out to be an important skill, though I do wish that computer players coming out of hyperspace would exhibit some amount of damage, as you often do.

Failures:
The biggest failure of this game are the land battles which are incredibly repetitive. After finishing a battle you will likely need to take 5 minutes for your trigger finger to relax after it had been held down non-stop for 15 minutes or so. While the factions are each unique, each member of a faction plays practically identically, but perhaps with different skill levels. The game could have added significantly more depth with different weapons (other than ""Standard Blaster, Melee, and Faction-Specific).

Some factions are simply better than others. The Salvation, after which the game is named, have an ability to heal themselves, and also have an ability to throw up a reflecting shield making a skilled human player practically invincible. Meanwhile, the amusing Wyr are large targets with almost no defensive capabilities.

The main plot of the game is fairly unimaginative. Factions fighting in space, check, prophesy and chosen one, check, inexplicable and inevitable galactic doom, check. I didn't feel like I was very invested in the plot, and the only reason I was motivated to finish it was that if I spent any more time not finishing it, I would have eventually lost.

The worst part about the plot was that it was carried through by plot-specific missions which mostly involved you trudging around alien planets toward a puzzle solution. There are alien beasts on these planets, but solo combat basically involves standing there, holding down the ""fire"" button, and waiting. You'll always win, so the monsters seem less like a tactical roadblock and more like a waste of time. I think these missions could have easily been shortened to just the puzzle sections to be much more effective.

Some of the mechanisms of the game are also broken. If another faction destroys a third faction's base, its totally within your power to build a new base there instantly, as it is within your power to instantly rebuild any base destroyed by your enemies. This makes losing battles more of a bother than a tactical setback, and it makes winning seem awfully easy. If you're like me, by the time you unlock diplomacy, two of the factions have already been reduced to one or 2 bases, and their surrender is easy to coax.

I hesitate to reccomend this game because the issues do keep parts of the game from being fun (especially by the end of your campaign when the last thing you want to do is another damn land battle), but there's also so much good in this game. I would love to see a sequel with some more depth, and maybe a little more production value.

If this game is on sale, it is probably worth checking out.",1385839863,1385839863,True,10,0,0.576498150825500488,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Another thing that may interest players is the planatory exploration, it's fine, though there isn't much to see besides a few aesthetically pleasing scenes.

The game loses points how ever due to there being no customization options, a minor complaint, but I'd like to be able to personalize my character, customize and change my ship, select weapons from a larger variety and change my armor, there's also the problem of the story, though it sounds good, the delivery is so damn piss poor that I enjoy doing the repetetive side missions even more.

Насыпали вроде щедро: в SP есть ""эпические"" наземные битвы, космические сражения, а потом появляется даже стратегическая часть,  где можно управлять своей расой. Проблема в том, что при ближайшем рассмотрении первые два компонента настолько плохо сделаны, что до третьего добираться уже не хочется.

Побегав по стартовой станции, покопавшись в профиле и взяв первое задание от игры уже не ждешь ничего хорошего. Так в оружейной можно покупать лишь улучшенные версии своего стартового бластера, меча, брони или купить третье (и единственное новое) оружие и в дальнейшем точно так же покупать его улучшенные версии. Само собой каждая новая версия лучше старой, никаких альтернатив. Забегая вперед, скажу что точно так же дела обстоят с улучшением своего истребителя, где никакой альтернативы в прокачке нет. Есть в игре и улучшения для главного героя, их всего 16 и они разбиты на четыре группы - улучшения урона, защиты и целых две категории под стимуляторы.

Графика и анимация в игре отвратительные, и внешне игра напоминает фанатские переделки старых шутеров вроде Doom 2, когда древние текстуры заменяются на четкие, отчего игры становятся похожи на накачанных ботоксом старух. Локациям (особенно космическим станциям и кораблям) сильно не хватает мелких деталей, они выглядят пустыми и не натуральными. Выпускать подобное при живом Mount & Blade это позорище.

За отыгранное время никакого сюжета обнаружить не удалось - каждый раз начальник ЦУПа предлагает тебе миссию по уничтожению некой колонии или флота со станцией одной из 3-х вражеских фракций, не обрамляя хоть какими-то  подробностями или деталями.

Наземные битвы смотрятся смехотворно: толпа из ~20 голов набегает на другую толпу. Никакой тактики, никакой стратегии, никакого управления отрядом. Техники кстати тоже нет, как и нет каких-то возможностей, вроде вызова артиллерии. Твоя задача состоит в том, что бы убить всех противников и уничтожить несколько зданий противника (турели/заводы). Здания здесь даже не взрываются, они просто исчезают, что смотрится глупо и смешно, а на месте исчезнувшего здания материализуется кучка врагов. Играть было бы интересней, если бы стрельба была веселая. Но в Salvation Prophecy она скучная, так как никакой видимой отдачи у оружия нет, стреляешь по врагам словно по деревяшкам, даже в древнейшем Думе стрелять веселей. Ну или могу снова в пример привести Mount & Blade, в котором битвы были интересными.

С космическими битвами все еще хуже (хотя казалось бы куда?). Почему-то в них вырезали радар, который есть в наземных битвах, отчего непонятно где враги вообще, максимум ты видишь только одного. Управление корявое и неудобное, стрелять все так же скучно. А еще до мест битв надо добираться через два вида порталов-тоннелей, в каждом из которых надо уклоняться от препятствий, иначе твоему кораблю наносятся повреждения. Первые пару раз это даже забавно, но потом достает.

Как я уже говорил, до стратегических миссий я не дошел, они появляются в самом конце, а я не вижу ни одной причины, по которым мне бы хотелось продолжать играть: битвы скучные, сюжета нет, квесты унылые, графика отвратительная и вообще нет никакой атмосферы живой вселенной, которая была например в Космических рейнджерах.

И не надо оправдывать эту игру словами про то что это инди или что-то в этом духе, снова упоминать M&B мне уже не хочется, а стоит он, кстати, меньше чем это поделие.",1385536488,1385536488,False,123,3,0.842471063137054443,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Salvation Prophecy manages to successfully marry several play styles into one game which makes for an enjoyable excursion into space for fans of shooting and exploration. Whilst the  progression feels a little rigid in places, once the game opens up there's an enjoyable fusion of gameplay elements that keeps the game fresh and worthwhile. The game is very much a budget release, but with so much care and attention placed into this project, it stands as a testament that smaller budget games can be good and don't necessarily need expensive effects or flashy graphics to make them enjoyable. The gameplay and looks are simple compared to triple A games, but if this can be ignored, there's a cool and fun game to play here that's well polished and certainly worth the price of entry.

Don't be put off by the dated looking graphics, this game has a ton of gameplay. Starts out with a simple mass-combat ground assault and every couple of 5-10 minute missions it adds on a new twist.

Almost before you know it, you're in charge of the entire war, picking targets, launching strike fleets, building bases, and investigating the prophecy, all with a frenetic fluid gameplay that has you doing something different every few minutes.

It's hectic and relentless but never leaves you feeling harried: it's amazingly easy to keep up with the strategic decision-making even in the depths of battle.
