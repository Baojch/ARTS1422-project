the game's graphics is not absurde or crisis-like but he has all that he needs, this isn't a game born to have a beatiful visual, this is born to challenge you, stage after stage, world after world.
the first 10 min with my brother was like:""meh, it's cool but there isn't anything special..."", well at 15 min in the game, when the difficulty started to be pretty challenging, me and my brother were:""wow this is cool and hard but i'm better than you, how about a challenge?""; we made 2 profile on the same game and we started tryhard to finish all the game and his achievement, after the full finish of the game i was like:""let me see how much time we spend on this game..."" i looked the timer and there was 150 hours so i decided to make a good review, so what can i say about this pure skill game... it's fantastic in his context, very hard(very very very very hard) but also not too much frustrating, the controls are very fluid and there is also a lot of things too unlock(spaceship, powerups, guns, etc.) so you can adapt your play style to your ship and personalize your expirience.
the artistic side is very good too, the ship are well designed, the music is very good.
it's all like an old 8-bit game like asteroid made in 2k17;

the only cons is the story... it's not very structurated and not well telled... but it's not a big problem for the gameplay

the vote is:

Gameplay 8.5/10
Story: 2/10
Music: 8/10
Graphics: 7/10
Challenge: 9.5/10
Unlockable 7.5/10

Final Vote: 8/10

I can say that for being a game developed from an indie team, it's not bad. It only costs 1 euro, it's worth a try.
I trust the developers, they have already released two updates in about a month, keeping the project alive and active.
The basic idea is good, I think the GUI needs to be improved (HUD) to make it more active and engaging.
The gameplay is not bad, it should be improved in some aspects such as: damage indicators, and stuff like that which helps the game.
Keep on the great work guys.

I have a few questions for developers tho :
What are those scores at the end of a game?Will you implement those scores in the next patch?
Is it only me or the game gets buggy when i try to change resolution?",1476026393,1476026393,True,2,0,0.391010314226150513,1,True,False,True,False,,,

First of all, this game is pretty nice and enjoyable, it's preatty simple by now but still the level of challenge is pretty high and  the difference in ships and enemies push the player to try lot of combinations for different levels, the powerups adds alot of combinations to the game.
Still... the game is not yet ok for quite some reasons, like some balance, it's a bit TOO simple and it still needs some enhancement to the graphics... but hey... it's less than 1 buck, I say give it a shot, you might find something more than worth when it's out of the early access.",1475268272,1475268272,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,False,False,True,False,,,

So far I have only played ten minutes of this, and in that ten minutes I REALLY enjoyed the game, however I was able to find a couple flaws. For example, there is no storyline. I know this sounds weird because in these types of games you don't need a storyline, however I didn't fully understand what do to. What I understood was that all enemies will blow up if you go near them, and that is really it. Shooting doesn't seem to do anything.

Also, the models aren't the best, I mean the closest thing I can describe the enemies to are the bullets from the mario racing games, and it doesn't help that (what I take is supposed to be the windsheild) looks like an eye.

However, again, I cannot say this is a bad game. It is early access, and to top that it is less than a dollar. 

To me, it was worth a shot, and I am happy with my dollar investment.",1474203436,1474203436,True,7,0,0.471214383840560913,2,True,False,True,False,,,
