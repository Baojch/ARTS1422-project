Okay I'm gonna say it... this game is better than Zoo Tycoon 2 

*Immediately changes name and goes into hiding to avoid assassination from the ZT2 mafia*

Before I explain why let me say that I spent countless hours growing up playing ZT complete collection and ZT2 complete collection, and for this comparison I'm referring to Wildlife Park 2 + all expansion packs and DLCs

Things I like better about WP2:

1. Animal designs are so much more realistic than in ZT2, and many are unbelievable adorable because of it (the otters!!!)
2. Animal's needs and behaviors are more realistic (i.e. needing it to be hotter or colder, interacting with the natural parts of their environment for food, water, shelter, and entertainment)
3. More animal and plant species to choose from (including oddities that can only be achieved through breeding and certain species that have color options when you purchase them)
4. Zoo IS NOT set up on a grid system which allows more design options.
5. Environmental challenges such as weather changes and temperature challenges
6. You don't have to make a zoo, ZT2 made you have a zoo entrance and guests would show up and complain no matter what you did. WP2 gives you the option to make a zoo, nature preserve, farm, ranch, animal shelter, or just a natural environment for the animals to exist in.


Things I like better about ZT2:

1. Terraforming controls are much more user friendly in ZT, however those in WP2 are more realistic in terms of how one would actually landscape and form lakes and deep water tanks
2. The sorting system, WP2 has no sorting system for anything and that can be overwhelming before you know where everything is and tedious once you do.
3. Staff didn't need their own individual buildings, nor did they have a limited range


Really in the end it all comes down to what you are looking for in a zoo game. In my case, I wanted realistic animals more than anything and a wide variety of them on top of that. However, if you want a more user friendly, child safe (I've seen multiple posts in the discussion boards from parents who aren't pleased with the realistic mating in WP2) zoo game, then perhaps ZT2 is better for you.",1509085337,1509085337,True,8,1,0.624050915241241455,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I liked the animals better and caring for the plants wasn't very fun for me. 

A little buggy for me. The skin varients didn't work for me in freestyle, only in the missions. The narrator for the missions didn't speak (which maybe you prefer, but I would rather hear him talk). Also all the animals constantly vocalized so if you went to first-person mode near a large group of animals you might find all the noise quite annoying. 

The expansions for WLP2 don't tie together very well. For example, if I wanted to play Crazy Zoo, I could still get the Farm World animals, but thats it. None of the plants, buildings, or decorations would transfer to the other expansion, which is kind of annoying.
