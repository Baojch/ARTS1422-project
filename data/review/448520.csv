Anybody liking the genre is going to fall in love with this one and if you start playing it, you won't stop until it ends. 

Controls are convenient and responsive, no lags or other bugs, so every death is on YOU! And the game is fair.

Don't pass this up. It's worth the time and effort!
Even at its base price, I would recommend it for lovers of the genre. But if you are not one, I would wait some sort of a discount as you'll probably only play it once and it's about 2-3h length even for those not used to games like it.

Developer Mikko Nykyri is one sadistic bastard. I mean that in the nicest, most complimentary, type of way. Deranged Rabbits is a frenetic platformer where the player takes the role of Fluffy the Bunny. The objective of each level is to get poor Fluffy to the end of the level where there is a carrot waiting as his reward for surviving. But as we all know with the greats in this genre, the majority of players will spend as much time killing poor Fluffy as feeding him.

[h1]Better Than Just Another Indie Idler[/h1]

I know that many of you may already have the game in your Steam libraries. This is because the game has already been bundled twice. The first time was with the Remute X bundle by Groupees and the second being Friday Special Bundle #37 at Indiegala. Both sites are huge boons for avid game collectors. However, there is a tendency for players to simply idle the cards back from the games that they buy in those bundles. As a result, I know for a fact that many of them never get downloaded let alone played. However, I urge those of you who have do this to check out some of the games you idle. You may just find a hidden gem that gives you some unexpected entertainment. I believe that Deranged Rabbits is definitely one of those games for platformer fans.

[h1]Well Designed[/h1]

Deranged Rabbits is a well-designed minimalistic platformer. It forgoes a lot of the high production features that many gamers look for while aiming for high level of playability. In this regard the game is very well designed. The game introduces new mechanics at a regular enough interval where the game never becomes boring. Furthermore, the way in which the game incorporates the Steam leaderboard system encourages players to improve their times on each level in order to gain bragging rights over your friends.

The game controls as efficiently and effortlessly as it should. I have found in my time with the game that Fluffy moves as well as intended. It doesn’t feel floaty and consequently no deaths feel unfair. I’ve often known immediately before Fluffy has died the error in judgement or control that I have made. I have not once felt cheated. This is of vital importance for a game of this type.

The game is also well presented for the most part. Although the graphics are simple they are pleasing to the eyes and the music is thumping. The UI is easy to navigate.

[h1]Demotivating[/h1]

Although I admit to enjoying the game’s leaderboard incorporation it ultimately becomes demotivating. This is because when your friends who have played the game have stopped progressing there are no longer any times to beat. It makes you realize that they have quit the game. I found that for me this was relatively early on in the game. There are 75 levels in the game. I believe that it was just over ten or so levels into the game where I ran out of times to beat.

Yes, there are times that you can beat where you are rewarded with a cabbage. If you unlock enough cabbages you unlock special game modes. For example, there is a map that makes the screen spin. If you unlock a cabbage on that screen you can make the entire game spin. However, this doesn’t prove to be as motivational to me as what I had hoped that it would.

In order to improve this situation, I would ask the developer for this or their next game to incorporate global leaderboards rather than just the friend leaderboards. If this is already available, then it isn’t obvious to me how I can see this within the game.

[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]

Deranged Rabbits is Steamified. It comes with a set of trading cards and 32 Steam achievements. As previously mentioned the game also takes advantage of the Steam Leaderboard system. However, better integration with the global leaderboard between levels would work wonders when your friends have stopped progressing would be delightful.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I don’t normally like killing cute bunnies. I’m not sadistic. But I had quite a bit of fun playing Deranged Rabbits. If you haven’t picked it up in one of the aforementioned indie bundles, then it’s worth its value in money.

Along the way levels get harder and you are introduced new elements so the game doesn't get too repeative.

Just that the game isn't done after you have finished all the stages you can focus on getting best time among your friends or even speedrun which seems to have global rankings. The feeling when you try to master a single level but you **** up the smallest jump or timing can be frustrating but getting the best possible time in rewarding on it's own.

Oh and the music is great.

EDIT: Just finished my first Speed run. Brutal, but rewarding. 

The game itself doesn't have that much content but it is definitely worth it's price. Though it can be boring if you don't have friends playing the game whose times you are aiming to beat.",1469977574,1470303961,True,7,0,0.569498956203460693,0,True,False,False,False,,,
