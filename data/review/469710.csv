일종의 어드벤스워즈류의 턴제 전략 게임입니다.

맵도 상당히 신경 써서 디자인해 놓은데다가
한 유닛을 연속해서 공격했을 때 발생하는 콤보 시스템이나
이와 연계되어 사용할 수 있는 지휘관 스킬 등
전투 시 활용 가능한 소소한 전략 요소도 있어서
생각보다 공략하는 맛이 괜찮은 게임입니다.

(유저가 없어 실행은 못해봤지만)멀티플레이도 가능하고
맵 에디터(+스팀워크샵)나 리플레이 기능도 있는데다가
캠페인을 진행할수록 추가로 해금되는 요소도 많아
질적으로도 양적으로도 은근 풍성한 게임입니다. 

문제는 비주얼이 너무 안타깝다는 점입니다.

지나치게 조잡해 보이는 UI와 폰트도 거슬리고
캠페인 모드의 핵심이라 할 수 있는
지휘관 일러스트가 너무 구립니다….

とは言え、それぞれのマップのデザインはなかなかに良くできており、2回目3回目で難易度を上げてやるとかなり歯ごたえのあるバトルが楽しめます。町を占領することにより軍資金が得られ、それを使って城で部隊を生産することもできますので、攻略方法がワンパターン化しにくく、いろいろな戦略を試して楽しむこともできそうです。お約束的な突然の増援なんかももちろんありますから初見時は用心深くなりますね。システム的には兵科クラスやスキルもそれなりに豊富で、特にコンボシステムと呼ばれる集中攻撃優遇ルールが戦術的な面白さをうまく引き出していると思います。

It's largely inspired by Advance Wars, and it does a good job of capturing a lot of the great fun in those games, but it's also quite ambitious and does a lot of new things to make it stand out.

One of the greatest things about this game is all the different units.  First of all, there are three factions that you can play as and they all have their own units.  The factions are well balanced, and it's a lot of fun to strategize around their different playstyles.  Each of the individual units also has a lot of personality, because they all have unique skills that can give them the edge in certain situations.

The skill system is a great addition to the game, but one problem that can come up here is a lack of clarity.  Almost all the skills in the game only take effect on either your phase or your enemy's phase, but there's no indication telling you this!  It would be so easy to just put a little icon by all of the skills to signify when it's active, but for some reason it just doesn't tell you at all.  There's a similar problem with effects like buffs and debuffs, where you're left wondering exactly how much an effect increased a stat or how long it's going to last or when the effect even takes place.

The campaign in this game is a good length, and it continues to provide new content throughout the whole thing, so I think it's pretty good overall.  One ugly flaw to rear it's head here, though, is the difficulty modes.  First of all, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Challenge.  However to even play a map on Hard you first have to beat it on Normal, and in order to play a map on Challenge you first have to beat it on hard.  I hate this sort of design because it completely ruins the point of having difficulty modes in the first place.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Normal mode is ludicrously easy.  Many of the maps provide you with so many resources that you can flat out skip the main mechanic of the map and go straight for a win.  I would love to just play Hard to start with, since it's a lot more fun for me, but instead I have to play baby mode first. Ugh.

Challenge mode is even harder than Hard mode (often frustratingly so) and usually adds on an extra condition, like ""you can't lose more than x units"" or ""your units take gradually more damage after x days"".  I think these extra conditions are really interesting, but I would love to experience them without having to play the same map three times.

As you may have guessed, I really dislike the difficulty modes in this game.  Normal mode is balanced terribly, and the other two aren't a whole lot better.  Instead of having a bunch of redundant and poorly balanced difficulties, I would have liked to see just one or two really well balanced ones.

Another big feature of this game is the map editor.  Just like in Advance Wars you can make your own maps.  The editor in this game is obviously very ambitious, since it allows you to set lots of different rules and conditions, and even lets you put in reinforcements like in Fire Emblem.  However, there are also several problems with it.  One simple one is that you can't drag your mouse to paint multiple tiles, so you'll have to click each and every individual tile if you want to make a big ocean area, for example.  The max map size is also only 29x29, which would be too small to fit many of the basic maps of other similar games.  Another problem is that you have to set all the win objectives yourself.  In Advance Wars' map editor, if you put down an HQ it's automatically a win objective.  But in this game even if there's an HQ on the map, you have to manually go into a little window and put in the objective, and on top of that you have to type in a description telling the player what the objective is for some reason.  You have to do this for both armies.  And even though it might seem obvious that defeating all enemy units would also count as a win, it isn't by default!  Just like before, you have to manually add in the win objective AND description, for both armies.  And you have to do this every single time you make a map.  I think the map editor in this game totally misses what made map creation in Advance Wars so snappy and fun.  It's obvious the developer focused on minute customization without giving a thought about the quality of life features that it more desperately needed.

So I've complained about quite a few things here, and rightfully so.  Shattered Throne is far from a perfect game.  It has this problem where it's just over-designed in a lot of areas.  I think if the developer would have just cut back a little and focused more on quality rather than quantity, the game could have been better.  But I only complain so much because it's a game worth complaining about.  This game has so many unique features like the factions and skills, and others I haven't had time to talk about like upgrading bases and the combo system.  It's a game that doesn't shy away from it's roots, but at the same time it's willing to try lots of new things.  No matter how many other similar games come out Shattered Throne will always have it's own place and it's own personality.  If you're a fan of Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, or strategy games in general, you should pick this up.  You'll get lots of great hours out of it.",1511133283,1511133283,True,12,0,0.68508601188659668,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Short answer: Fantasy Advance War.

You have three very distinct factions: Humans, which mostly operate on combos and simply strong units, elves, which specialise on mobility and guerilla tactics and the undead, which have a lot of regeneration abilities. 

You only control nameless mooks in battle, there are no heroes like in fire emblem. It really is more like Advance War in that way. But every faction has a number of different generals (two to three per faction I believe) who each have a passive and two active effects. The passive ones are things like taking over citeis imedately or all units having more health while the active ones range from healing to having everyone who is in a forest act again. Active abilities are powered by mana, which you get for combo kills.

What are combos? Attacking an enemy will place a combo marker on that unit. If you attack that unit again with another unit without doing anything else in between (moving and attacking with one unit counts as one action and does not break combo) will deal increased damage and reduce the damage of the counter. This stacks up to three times. Killing a unit with combo markers on them will generate mana equal to the amount of markers on that unit.

The campaign is good. It doesn´t have a deep story with any notable twists (so far) but it is written in a humorus way. Don´t take it seriously, it doesn´t take itself seriously too. 
And best of all: Everything is deterministic and you can undo each of your actions however often you want during a turn, so even if you misclick you can undo and do better till you have foudnd the best combo. So battles are decided by long term strategy, not by who can calculate the best and does the least misclicking during short term skrimishes.",1507801608,1507801608,True,6,0,0.571801960468292236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[u]What is it? [/u]
On the surface it plays a lot like a PC port of Famicom wars in a different setting with different sprites.
If you've never heard of our played a turn based grid based strategy then imagine Chess with more rules and variation.
Changes to this formulae include the map varying in size and shape, terrain effects, different units, a money system,  units having HP which can be replenished. There is also a big story woven throughout and some various in rules.
Ok so nothing like chess then...fine.

These two series have been around since the first Nintendo (NES/Famicom) and their first handheld the Gameboy (DMG)

[u] What makes it different? [/u]
There are some different mechanics we’ve found including
1) Ranged units can move and attack in the same turn.
2) Capturing always takes 2 turns with an infantry regardless of their HP 
3) Battle animations have being skipped which speeding up gameplay
4) Less information about terrain and units obviously available
5) Many units with more than the standard 10 HP
6) It's on a desktop PC now! Those old enough to grow up with poor eye sight and stiff necks growing up with non backlit gameboys, GBA and small DS screens thank you!
7) Online play, haven't tried it but not a bad idea

[u] What don't we like? [/u]
You cannot fault the developers for finding something 'Not broke and not fixing it' however there are a few things we would of prefered to have changed
1) The original  Fire emblem and some of the Famicom/ GB wars had a strong story but...some of us don't feel engaged and just want to go straight into the action
2) The undo and next turn buttons although visible in the top right need shortcuts. It is tiring repetively moving the mouse up there each turn of the game, there is no obvious keyboard shortcuts
3) The Beautiful pixel art has not been sampled/ scaled well onto my desktop. Why is there so much 'white space'' empty space'? We wish we could see the units more clearly as the artist intended.
4) An alternate setting? Perhaps we've played too much fire emblem/ fantasy settings...sorry if you like it.

[u] The bottom line [/u]
Should you play it?
Well...Are you a patient gamer who likes to think things through several moves in the advance and learn a complex system of rules?
Did you really enjoy the Famicom/ GB wars and Fire emblem series and really want to play some more?
Then the answer is easy.

However 
Are you a gamer who picks up games once a month and on their smartphone?
Are you a gamer who wants an easy and straightforward fun experience?

Для всех любителей тактических стратегий просто 10 из 10!
Здесь есть всё, чтобы понравится:
1. Три непохожих фракции - люди, эльфы, нежить. Причем они действительно непохожи! У каждой расы свой стиль игры. Люди мощные и хорошо играют от обороны, эльфы быстрые и телепортаются по всей карте, нежить медленная но многочисленная ...
2. Юниты одинаковых классов отличаются не только статами, но и абилками, что сильно меняет тактику их использования.
3. У каждой фракции по 3 генерала, которые так же сильно меняют стиль игры.
4. Здесь есть морские сражения!!!
5. Асинхроннй мультиплеер! Просто моя мечта!!!! Есть до 48 часов на ход. То что надо для вдумчивой игры.
6. НИКАКОГО РАНДОМА! Всё чётко детерменированно. В поисках оптимального вариатна можно делать откат действий вплоть до самого начала хода.
7. Помимо множества абилок у юнитов и генералов, присутствует интересная система гангап бонусов (типа как в юниваре, если кто знает такую игру). Т.е. каждая атака по юниту добавляет +1 к дамагу для следующей атаки. Ну и другие взаимодействия с этим бонусом могут быть.
8. Так же присутствует влияние рельефа: горы, леса, равнины, пустыни, болота и т.д.
9. Присутствует неплохая стратегическая составляющая: захваченные деревни можно развивать, увеличивая доход ИЛИ защиту, или производство ...

В целом, все правила и фишки довольно простые, но все вместе они дают потрясающий простор для манёвром и тактик!

Всем очень рекомендую. Не пожалеете.

P.s.: из минусов могу лишь отметить, что фракции и генералы открываются лишь по мере прохождения компании, что меня очень бесит, т.к. сингл играть не люблю. И скипнуть компанию нельзя. Более того, даже включить высокий уровень сложности нельзя, пока не пройдёшь на лёгком... Из-за этого бои в компании играть черезвычайно скучно. Но это мелочи, игра совсем не про то.

Asynchronous online multiplayer can use Steam notifications for new turns. A skirmish mode is also available, but only with a couple of maps; thankfully, the map editor is easy to use and includes Steam workshop integration. Each turn, every unit can move then attack; successive attacks on the same unit increase damage. Mana gained from defeated units can be used to grant map-wide powers. Units include melee, ranged, healing, and mounted options with varied special abilities. Units are purchased at castles from funds earned by capturing villages. Terrain comes with different movement costs and attack/defense bonuses. The AI can surround vulnerable units and capture key structures, but not consistently, and it definitely benefits from a higher quantity of reinforcements common in the campaign. Shattered Throne is a good foundation for a turn-based strategy game, but it needs more content for long-term enjoyment.

From Advance Wars it takes the basic flow of gameplay: make money, build units, trade casualties, capture buildings, as well as COs and CO Powers. From Fire Emblem it takes the fantasy-medieval setting and individual unit level-ups. That being said, Shattered Throne brings many new mechanics to the table which set it apart from these games.

The meat and potatos of combat in this game is the combo system. Units are afflicted with a ""combo"" when struck, up to a maximum of three. Combos reduce their defense and counterattack strength, but will only stick around if the unit suffers many consecutive attacks. If any other action is taken (attacking a different unit, not attacking, ending the turn, etc.) the unit loses all combos and regains its usual stats. Since most units in the game are actually quite tough, an attacking player must be careful not to lose their combos before the enemy unit is dead.

Thankfully, Shattered Throne also has an ""undo"" function. You can reverse any move you have made during the current turn, allowing you unlimited flexibility to optimise your moves prior to ending your turn.

The rest of what this game has to offer is better experienced than explained. If you're a fan of Nintendo's old turn-based strategy games, you will definitely enjoy Shattered Throne.

It would be nice to add tooltips to the unit stats, but hopefully that is coming.  The stats are pretty straightforward, though.  I had to ask on the forum what the range of ranged units was, and the developer answered very quickly.

The developer is very active on the forums so far, and it is obvious that this game is his/her baby.

First things first, Shattered Throne is fun.
The video and screenshots remind heavily of Advance Wars, and the developer has said that that game certainly was an inspiration. However, this game brings in fresh new mechanics into play.

=There is unit progression within a level - units gain xp for kills and level up.

=Unit classes have unique traits - death knights resurrect as zombies after death, crusaders attack enemies adjacent to a target, etc etc.

=There are units with AOE attacks

=There are buildings that do different things, and the most basic building class - the village - can be upgraded into the other building classes. 

=There is a combo system that increases damage dealt to an enemy unit that is attacked consecutively, and killing enemies with a combo counter gives you mana.

=Mana allows for the usage of your General's Powers, and each General has one passive and continuous perk along with two Powers.

=There are three factions: Human,  Elf, and Undead, with different generals/units/buildings

=There is a take-back-your-moves feature

=I've yet to encounter any bugs or crashes

All the above points increase the breadth and depth of the tactical approaches available.

The campaign so far has been excellent and loads of fun. 
The story and dialogue have a largely humorous bent with some genuinely funny moments.
The levels have been challenging without being devastatingly hard, and you can replay them for a better rank.
While there is an amount of flux in the quality range of the graphics, a lot of it is very well done: detailed and tasteful.
Although I did not find the music to be particularly spectacular, it fits the game and there is nothing wrong with it.
Also, the developer has been responsive so far.

I'm really looking forward to what the campaign brings next; just that I barely beat the fifth level because of a stupid mistake that I made and so need some time to recharge.
I also think that the Online multiplayer pvp could be a lot of fun.

Some Cons may be:
-Only 1vs1 maps
-Only asynchronous multiplayer
-So far only a few maps in skirmish mode, but not sure whether this is because I haven't unlocked them

The game works without any problems, has unique elements that differentiate it from other games in the genre, the gameplay is just some plain good'ole fun, and there is spades of personality in abundance in every element of the game. 

If you like turn-based tactics and strategy games, I heartily recommend Shattered Throne even in its current Early Access state. For this price, you are getting a lot of value in return.",1465356721,1465357482,True,29,1,0.757705509662628174,0,True,False,True,False,,,
