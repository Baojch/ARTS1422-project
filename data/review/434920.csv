Первым делом скажу, что эта игра один в один похожа на свою первую часть, так как это её продолжение... Если вы не играли в первую часть, то советую вам в неё поиграть!
Именно об этой части скажу тоже самое что и сказал об её предшественнице:
У таких RPG есть свои плюсы: они требует мало места на жестком диске, просты в управлении. И, играя в игры такого 16-ти битного типа, я впадаю глубокое детство... Это классно!
У этой игры есть отличный сюжет, какие-никакие бои, несколько классов, огромная карта, прокачка уровней и т. д.
Графика в игре отличная, также прорисовка персонажей... Музыка не навязчивая, что способствует интересной, а главное спокойной, игре...
Если сесть в игру, то можно забыть о времени, так как ты не можешь остановиться, тебе кажется ""сейчас, сейчас уйду"", но сюжет тебя манит все дальше....
Конечно, как и в любой игре, в этой игре тоже должны быть минусы, но каждый эти минусы воспринимает по разному...
В игре нет поддержки русского языка, что значительно усложняет процесс прохождения. Приходится сидеть с переводчиком в другом окне и переводить английский текст…
Ну, как и в предыдущей части, особых минусов в этой игре не вижу...

Я не знаю, оценивать ли игру по баллам.. Ведь у каждый оценит её сам... Но учитывая такой тип игры и что для него игра проделана отлично, я , пожалуй, поставлю оценку 9/10!

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Last Heroes 2 is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

This is another ultra basic minimum viable product RPG maker asset flip from Falling Star/Warfare with a craptastic plot, the fanfic is so bad here there's typos and grammatical errors all over the place, which is the only part the developers came up with themselves (if they stole someone else's writing like they copy + pasted all the game assets from RPG Maker, it wouldn't be quite as awful).  There's absolutely zero interest here for RPG Maker fans let alone serious gamers.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards. 

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

TLDR: Same filler-oriented padded structure as the original. Stock assets everywhere. Cult VS resistance theme. Poor quality writing.

Take 2 heroes from the first game, stranded on continent, game warps back and forth between them and resistance until they meet. Go take the fight to the bad cult, probably an evil god behind it or whatnot. Dont really care.

Game still uses swirly backgrounds, stock tileset, stock assets all around. Same music loop as the original gets grating, it restarts every fight you have.

This time the pacman game is harder since the encounters move at running speed and can even swarm you gets tedious and annoying.

Grammar and spelling errors.

This one is a bit longer than the first as Amelia and Roland (from the first game) team up with Leon and Sofia to track down the evildoers of a group called Illion in the hopes of putting a stop to their plans, and to discover more clues about Amelia's parents.
So, in the classic rpg style, you are on an adventure that takes you to many locales that require investigating, fighting monsters, and meeting various characters that all build the story.

There are some changes here that enhance the game play, most notably that the enemies respawn so you can level up more. And by the leveling, more skills are acquired. There are also more treasures to find, and there are some side quests involved. 
The artwork, especially of the enemies, is good, and the music is nice with a pleasant variety.
So, do you need to play the first one to enjoy this one? Not really, but I would advise playing them in order for the cohesion of the long range story ---- and, at the low price for both ---- why not?

All in all, if you are a fan of these classic games, this one will keep you entertained for hours, and is a good addition to the series. Recommended for sure.

Первым делом скажу, что эта игра один в один похожа на свою первую часть, так как это её продолжение... Если вы не играли в первую часть, то советую вам в неё поиграть!
Именно об этой части скажу тоже самое что и сказал об её предшественнице:
У таких RPG есть свои плюсы: они требует мало места на жестком диске, просты в управлении. И, играя в игры такого 16-ти битного типа, я впадаю глубокое детство... Это классно!
У этой игры есть отличный сюжет, какие-никакие бои, несколько классов, огромная карта, прокачка уровней и т. д.
Графика в игре отличная, также прорисовка персонажей... Музыка не навязчивая, что способствует интересной, а главное спокойной, игре...
Если сесть в игру, то можно забыть о времени, так как ты не можешь остановиться, тебе кажется ""сейчас, сейчас уйду"", но сюжет тебя манит все дальше....
Конечно, как и в любой игре, в этой игре тоже должны быть минусы, но каждый эти минусы воспринимает по разному...
В игре нет поддержки русского языка, что значительно усложняет процесс прохождения.  Приходится сидеть с переводчиком в другом окне и переводить английский текст…
Ну, как и в предыдущей части, особых минусов в этой игре не вижу...

Я не знаю, оценивать ли игру по баллам.. Ведь у каждый оценит её сам... Но учитывая такой тип игры и что для него игра проделана отлично, я , пожалуй, поставлю оценку 9/10! 

P.S. Автор, где коллекционные карточки? В прошлой части игры они есть! Надеюсь, что ты их добавишь!",1453662840,1453728665,True,8,2,0.53183746337890625,0,False,False,False,False,,,
