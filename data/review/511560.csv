Strangely realistic physics, in as much as my real life slice is replicated perfectly in the game. 

There is a mechanic where you need to pull the trigger to 'activate your club' to stop you hitting the ball accidently and it took me a couple of holes to get in to the habit. However, once there I was picking different clubs and reading distances quite happily.

You definitely miss the weight of the club on the controller but you can't really blame the game for that. All in all it’s a really good effort at a golf game in a brand new world and I look forward to actually getting good at it!

I've played lots of Tiger Woods golf in the past and this game is a lot of fun. Sure it's got physics issues and it's very much early access but it's still a lot of fun and that's most important. I like its straightforward style. It's not arcade golf. A few things to help:
- Putting green color way too saturated. Would be better off using same color as tee box green.
- Move teleport to left side of ball instead of directly over.
- Some holes don't allow teleport towards ball while it's in the air, would like to follow it somehow.
- Flag on first hole is gigantic.

I'm an avid golfer and golf is particularly well suited for VR simulation, and I can't wait to see how many great golf games will produced over the coming years. Now, this is the first real golfing simulator to be released as far as I am aware, and so I bought this fully understanding that there will be a certain lack of polish to it. That being said, this game is a good first step, and gives a nice glimpse into what is possible when you look into the future of VR. At the moment, however, it's just not fully fleshed out enough to cross the boundary from ""fun curiosity"" into ""enjoyable game"".

The most important quality to a VR golf game is always going to be the swing physics. The player HAS to believe that their swing is 100% responsible for the resulting actions of the golf ball. That's where the fulfillment and enjoyment of real golf comes from, being able to tinker with the mechanics of your swing over and over again, and the gratification that comes with really nailing a shot and knowing that your swing was the reason why. The moment that the player feels the suspicion that there are ""behind the scenes"" forces producing the resultant shot, beyond his swing, is the moment that the magic is gone. The moment I realized that my shots in this game were not making sense with my swing changes is the moment I slumped my shoulders and didn't really feel like playing anymore. Don't get me wrong, there's a broad sense of control, but you just can't fine tune your swing like you would in real life. I understand it's a hard thing to program, but it's going to be crucial for the future of VR golf.

Other points: Number one, the game NEEDS (repeat NEEDS) to have the sound of the ball falling into the cup when you're putting. That small sound is the payoff when you're playing golf. It's one of the sweetest sounds in sports, and it's incredibly depressing to hear nothing as the ball drops into the hole. There is also no sound when contact is made between the putter and ball. That also contributes to the hollow feeling when putting.

Secondly, the colors and/or textures need to be tweeked. I'm not talking about the low-poly objects necessarily, because I like the general philosophy of the art direction in this game, but there at least need to be some texture modifications to give a better sense of depth to the holes. The neon green color of the greens are actually physically uncomfortable to look at for too long. A contributing factor to this may be that the holes are just not well designed, and are simply uninteresting. Possibly look into replicating a real course? Also, the way that the bunkers blend into the fairway is really unappealing. Bunkers need to be well defined.

It might sound like I'm being rough on the game, but that's only because I know those tiny details are the difference between a great golf game and a frustrating one. One day a well made golfing game will find tremendous success and I'm glad this game exists just to take the first step. I hope everyone enjoys it for what it is, and we can all look forward to some real top notch golfing games in the near future.",1475870251,1475871760,True,19,1,0.710140228271484375,3,True,False,True,False,,,

What is good:
- I like the ""Virtua Fighter/Racing type of graphics, this should help it stand out from the upcoming competition
- There is decent feeling of scale
- more options than I expected from what I had read, such as:  there is slope, enough clubs, wind (though not sure if it affects the ball), grid on green
- I have no problem with the sale price though I think at this stage of EA, that should be the regular price

What needs work:
- Lack of sounds:  No sound when putting, no sound effect for the ball falling in the cup, needs more variety with the ambient sounds
- Lack of environment effects:  IE: keep going with the Virtua Graphics stuff, but add basic birds, squirrels, anything to make the course feel more alive.  That volcano should be spewing out something, IMHO animation is king when using basic graphics
- Its nice you have the arrow wind indicator, but basic cloud movement would be a better tell
- I don't have too much issues with the golf club swing (though I have a nasty bloody slice to the right!) but the putting feels off, feels better in Cloudlands minigolf.  Now it's not all bad, I found that part of the issue was I wasn't standing enough over the ball but still, it feels like it needs some tweaking
- a tad smaller cup size would be better ;)
- graphics are decent but I would up the color content since in VR they tend to look a little too bland
- the putting grid needs to be smaller so we can tell slope better
- I don't think your super sampling option worked? (could be wrong) 
- presently only 1 course, would love to see more
- Continuing with the tradition of the Virua Series, why not add a mirror option for the courses?  Instant double up!
- multiplayer and tournament or season would be nice (it's coming!)

However the game doesn't do a good job of translating the swing to ball flight.
