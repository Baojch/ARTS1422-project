Game's premise is simple: collect the items scattered throughout the level. The difficulty? There is no general ""down"" direction, as the floor is only defined by what's under your feet in this harp-accompanied fantasy world. Which means that out of the three possible artificial locomotion systems (teleport, point-and-slide, touchpad) the touchpad's constant movement becomes the most desired one.

YOU WILL FEEL DIZZY AT FIRST! THIS IS NORMAL, AS YOUR BRAIN IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS OF A NEW WORLD, AND THAT PROCESS TAKES TIME. TAKE BREAKS, BREATHE FRESH AIR, AND DRINK SOME WATER, WITH ENOUGH TIME GIVEN YOUR BRAIN WILL ADAPT.

I personally like the game's sandbox-style approach, where you're free to go wherever you wish to, as long as you have collected enough of those crystals to activate the teleport.

Butterflies are cute, but the grass kinda sucks, especially when you try to touch it with the controller (controller gets superimposed into the grass).

Great game overall, nice atmosphere.",1485556424,1485556424,True,2,0,0.516556262969970703,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Teleport inherently isn't good for the game, since you're climbing walls and going upside down, effectively spinning it. It feels awkward. Slide teleport is better, but not much. That leaves touchpad moving, which should be the way to play it, but touchpad movement made me ill about 3 levels in. It might be able to be fixed without the super-sudden stopping, I'm not sure. 

It does seem like fun, and if they can fix the movement, it can probably be turned into a great game. Until then, I don't feel inclined to load it up again.",1483099204,1483099204,False,4,0,0.483479857444763184,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Having a more animated teleportation system like in Raw Data or Island 359 - or maybe movement by swinging your arms - would be really great, as it probably would make walking around in these strange environments feel even weirder!",1472372660,1472372660,True,3,0,0.49052804708480835,2,True,False,False,False,,,
