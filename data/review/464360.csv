Questa odissea spaziale segue le gesta di John Falcon, pilota mercenario e cacciatore di taglie, con il look alla Indiana Jones. Ricorda qualcuno? Il citazionismo non si limita al personaggio principale ma si estende ad una trama declinata perlopiù in maniera umoristica. Non mancano comunque momenti più dark ed un paio di buoni colpi di scena. 
Il gameplay di 3030 Deathwar Redux è suddiviso principalmente in tre sezioni. Passeremo la maggior parte del tempo a pilotare l'astronave di Falcon con una visuale dall'alto. Nello spazio la lista di missioni che non seguono la trama principale e che ci permettono di guadagnare preziosi crediti ha una discreta varietà, sebbene non eccelsa. Si comincia con semplici lavori da tassista o corriere spaziale, ma una volta che riusciremo ad acquistare una nave dotata di armi verranno sbloccate missioni di scorta o che prevedono di dare la caccia ad una flottiglia di pirati. Ed è qui che la colonna sonora riveste la parte del leone. Il pop elettronico e un po' ruffiano del gruppo The Kyoto Connection dà ottime vibrazioni e rende la navigazione nello spazio ancora più godibile. Quando ci troveremo all'interno di una stazione spaziale prenderemo il controllo del prode Falcon in una visuale a scorrimento laterale. Qui l'estetica da avventura grafica vecchio stile è al servizio della narrazione e della customizzazione della nostra nave. Saltuariamente nelle fasi più avanzate ci sarà anche qualche sparatoria. L'ultimo segmento riguarda l'esplorazione dei derelitti delle astronavi che all'inizio aggiunge ulteriore varietà ma finisce per stancare abbastanza in fretta.

Memory of a trepanned, ADHD toddler with impulse control issues notwithstanding.  

Teaboy's Basic(ish) Reviews....I read a lot of reviews when looking at games on Steam, and it quickly gets tiring – those who write involved, down to the micron scale reviews, although helpful, end up like looking at War & Peace when you’ve only got time for a quick 5 minute dump!  This is middle of the road and to the point – not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer’s work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these – it is their life after all – this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy’s Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, “She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man’s tonsils!”.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score – perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It’s a flat stomach....sure it’s nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‘gaming rooms’.  The definitive ‘Meh’ - the middle ‘sideways thumb’ option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‘a’ or is it an ‘o’?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like – the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it’s like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who’s trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  TONSIL TICKLER!!


The Review:  

They took 10 years to make this game....TEN YEARS!  And it shows because the game is flawless!  

Its simplicity is what makes it work - it's just fun!  Pixel graphics!?  I mean, wtf!?  And yet....magic.  You just keep wanting to get out there and splash pirate scum all over the spacelanes!  Why?  To get the cash to install the stash to make the splash!  Bigger better guns, faster more explodery mis-kiles, and that marvellous looking superduperuber-ship!  

When you start the game you're earning hundreds - when you find a system that sells the top ships they're in the Millions!  You think you're never going to get there, but you earn some dough, you buy a bigger gun, you learn to kill bigger baddies, you haul more parcels, you buy another ship with passenger space, you turn into a taxi/delivery service.  Money comes in, you buy another ship that can actually turn^^  You shoot stuff, you try your first missile, you start to buy all the bits n bobs available to upgrade your ship.  You think, ""Wow, this reward is 10k for this pirate....can I?""  You give it a go, you waste that mother....the world opens up to you.  One moment you're a newt, next you're a naughty-bottomed chocolate coconut bar capturer!  

It's just a joy to play, pure and simple.  The most common thing said about this game is the desire for it to be longer.  No greater compliment can be given to a game other than people want to Keep playing it.  But then the these things are considered marvels of their ilk exactly because they end before they unravel - how many things have we had/eaten/watched etc that we thought were absolutely brilliant....until they made another one, and then another.  The gem became cloudy, the heart of it slowly poisoned, the colour drained and the soul died.  Keep 'em wanting more.  

Oh, and the scanner thing - one mission!  You can scan EVERYONE!  The entire galaxy worth of characters, and it is pointless!  Just that one person for that one mission.  Shame they never expanded upon its use.  And the ship scanner too - let's face it, you're just gonna blow ship up regardless of its content^^  

Don't bother trying to map the clouds, it doesn't affect you enough to matter.  And for those on larger aspect ratios, the bottom of the screen has a tiny line of script that is vital in a later mission searching for a satellite - there's a verbal diarrhoea post in discussions from me exactly about it^^  

Just play it, it has a magic about it that makes it....magic.",1701708891,1701708891,True,0,0,0.442404866218566895,0,True,False,False,True,,,

That being said, the game is solid. Lots of mechanical crunch (you'll be upgrading your ship for a /while/), different approaches and styles to what ship you want to fly, a high skill ceiling for flying, and a beautiful world to explore. Flying your ship feels lovely, too, especially given the plethora of ships to get and upgrades to buy, there's almost always something new to try out.

My two gripes are:

It seems like you hit a bit of a wall with income potential. You'll run into ships that cost millions and still be getting 10-50k jobs. Entirely possible this is a skill issue, I haven't played for too long and haven't looked up any guides for it.

The music is wonderful, and there's a field in the escape/settings menu under ""sound"" that tries to show the artist and title currently playing, and even throws in a ""next song"" button for good measure. All of this is wonderful, I wish more games did this. However, the artist/track-name field is a bit messy, I've seen it show artist - album, or album - track name.

I took it as a more relaxing game rather than a hardcore simulation and I had a lot of fun.

Just don’t take too much time to grind stuff. Enjoy the story! Or else you will be bored by the possible repetitiveness of the side quests. I played for about 18 hours without grinding, just having fun, and I was able to finish the story without problems.

What I liked:
* The soundtrack is incredibly great for such “little” game.
* The 2D graphics are charming.
* I love the 2D point and click interface when in station: This is much better than a menu or a crappy 3D rendering like in X4. It is quick and immersive. Plus, there are really pseudo point and click parts in the story!
* Freedom is here. Despite simple missions, you can decide how to grow your “character” and how go thought the story.

What could be better:
* The gameplay is good but repetitive. Maybe something like 10 different tasks. But that’s fine if you don’t grind: Just follow the story line, while doing side missions on the way…
* There is no real customization concerning your ship. There is a good variety of ships available of all kinds and tiers.

They fill a niche in my childhood I will always want to fill.

This title scratches the edges of the itch, but unfortunately I think too many decisions were based on what is easier to develop ending up with a game that goes backwards from the retro games of old.

Firstly I enjoyed the writing – spoofy style humorous and engaging.
But then...

[b]Entering space stations[/b] seems fun, but ends up just tediously talking to people with filler text.
[list]
[*]not an improvement from classic dialogue popups (needs an important conversation indicator at minimum)
[/list]

[b] Scavenging derelicts [/b] also seems like a great idea, but again just ends up being tedious. Weapon aiming is janky, and there is no risk reward type of gameplay. You end up just mononotonously looting everything (cargo space allowing).
[list]
[*]not an improvement on a [loot] option popup.
[/list]

These could be easily overlooked as long as the core gameplay is fun...
...yeah you know where I'm going.

[b]Tailoring your ideal ship[/b] is a big part of this sort of game, but here it just comes down to buying everything you can afford. Buying a new ship affects movement stats and cargo space, but everything else is based on optional (unlimited) addons.
[olist]
[*]You can only have the one weapon. No optimising for multiple weapons/energy/heat limitations. Just choose one weapon (the best you can afford) and that's it. Well you can install a turret sure, but that halves the damage of your weapons so pretty much no change.
[*]There are no hard points or slots for addons. If you can afford it you can have all addons (including shield strength) on any ship.
[*]Addons are in a big list without any sorting. Makes it tedious to find and unequip your previous crud shield to install a better one for example.
[*]Some addons are single use - requiring you to find and purchase it in the list off all addons each time you use it.
[/olist]
Lastly [b]UI and in game interaction[/b] isn't great. You can't target specific space objects or tab through all enemies. The keybind always selects the closest enemy/station/friendly etc. oh yeah you can't change keybinds...


All up I did have fun for a bit, and have no issue supporting the devs (as I selfishly want more games like this). Unfortunately most design elements seem to fall short. I'm ok with that mostly, but it ends up being tedious and doesn't quite hit the mark.

A sequel, a DLC, anything.

Progression is just right if you take a little time to explore and upgrade in between story line objectives. Combat is a thing but can be mostly avoided if you want a more laid-back time. Or in the options you can turn on a setting that has hit squads come at you with varying frequency and intensity which can be a great way to get that kill count up and score lots of rare loot - although I wouldn't do this until at [i]least[/i] mid-game as it can get pretty intense on the harder settings!

You'll run a lot of courier missions, and at least initially be doing some pretty low-volume trading. Salvage ops are entertaining for a while - make sure you explore completely and if you're lucky enough to encounter enemies shoot them until they drop gems for some extra cash. Salvage is also the best way to unlock the map, as about 1:6 crates will have pieces for you.

Go mining for a quick boost to the wallet (only mine the rarest ores to make it time well spent). I made a habit to swing through any asteroid field that was nearby to look for rare minerals real quick when returning to a station - just fill up an inventory with the rarest stuff for some extra cash at the expense of a minute or two.

While commodities have fluctuating values, [b]ship equipment stays the same and you can unequip/sell your gear at 100% purchase price[/b] to try other setups out with no loss. This is a really nice feature in the game as the weapons handle differently and just because one is more expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's better to your playstyle, Selling ships usually has a 3-8% loss in resale value, but honestly there's really never a reason to downgrade your ship.

The shining star for me in this game had to for sure be the writing and all the little Easter eggs left in the background. Plenty of references to scifi shows and movies got a chuckle out of me. I laughed so hard at a dialog tree in the final mission I tracked down the dev's Discord just to say thanks 😂

If you're a completionist, the $100M achievement [i]sucks[/i].

3030 Deathwar Redux is a solid little top-down space adventure game with very addicting gameplay. Forewarning though, 3030 Deathwar is very simplistic in both its flight model (being top down and with little control over ship systems) and missions. In further detail, the most you can really do during in-transit flight is refuel your ship if you packed extra fuel. Regarding missions, most missions are just “take this from point A to point B”. Not only that, but most missions don’t tend to pay that much, capping out at around 100,000 and those missions are often very rare. Meanwhile, a decent ship can cost you up to 6 million. Meaning you’ll be doing a lot of grinding for money and if you hate grinding then you’ll absolutely hate this game. 

Although I might come off as talking about this game negatively, there is a decent game here. While not as in-depth as other top-down space games, such as FTL or Space Rangers, what little 3030 Deathwar does it does very well. Stations are designed beautifully, each starship is distinct and there are a ton to choose from, trading is intuitive and easy, you can mine, hunt pirates, commit piracy yourself, explore derelict ships, complete transport missions, racing, participate in battles between pirates and the police, survey missions, delivery missions, taxi missions, etc., so while 3030 Deathwar isn’t as thick with content as other top down space games, what is there is still worth pursuing. 

Graphically, being a top-down space game, I wouldn’t expect much. The only issue is that many entities and ships do appear copy pasted. For example, only a handful of stations are unique in their interior and exterior appearance. Derelicts all look largely the same and even pirates/police tend to fly the exact same ships every time you encounter them. Even so, these copy-pasted textures and models are substantially detailed. Also don’t let the cartoony graphics fool you, the game can be very dark at times. For example, if you destroy a ship, you can often find bodies floating from the battle afterward, which you can collect and sell for cash. Derelict ships will contain dead bodies and sometimes pornographic magazines. Honestly something I wasn’t expecting to see, but it definitely game reason towards the included “YouTube safe” button! 

In addition to everything mentioned previously, sound design is a huge plus. With 3030 Deathwar featuring a multitude of songs most of which are designed with a sort of 80s aesthetic. Performance is also a huge plus as I rarely encountered bugs and the game is very easy to run on even the most barebones systems. Really the weakest area of 3030 Deathwar is its main story which is very confusing to follow and feels somewhat disjointed. Regardless, 3030 Deathwar is a decent little space adventure game that will keep you entertained for hours.",1652794862,1652794898,True,3,0,0.57055211067199707,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-It has a lot of the elements of games like Escape Velocity and Endless Sky with an added ability to leave the ship and walk around spaceport bars.  

-Story is pretty funny.  It isn't heavy stuff, but it absolutely will amuse.  The writing overall is irreverent and good, if a bit light.

-There's a good abundance of ships/upgrades/weapons to choose from, but the combat in this game is a bit underwhelming.  It can still be very fun to be a bounty hunter, but it's very basic and will get repetitive.

-UI can be a bit clunky in space and buttons can't be remapped.  This doesn't stop the game from being completely functional, and after a bit of playing you'll get right in the rhythm.  

-The soundtrack absolutely slaps.  It has this 80s retro feel that will make you wanna wear sunglasses indoors while flying through space.

I am both fan of space trading games and retro stuff but wanted to keep my hopes low when 3030 Deathwar appeared on my radar. While it doesn't provide complexity of bigger games, ie. it's really easy to fly the spacecrafts, the fights are really arcadish, I mean, Privateer/Rebel Galaxy Outlaw are tactical space fight simulators when compared to, but it has a few things where it stands out:

1. Radios/music. They are amazing. The first missions you take (transporting people within a system), when you depart from a space station, see other ships minding their own business and you hear a song, this reminds me of long night rides with just radio on.

2. Space stations & adventure part of the game. While all space stations navigate the same, although they look differently, they are not tedious to walk through to meet other characters and sometimes you have to meet them in person to perform a given task. It's a good addition that really works. You don't have to walk for minutes to get anywhere. I wish the layouts were different sometimes, even having two separate floors where trading and job computers could be placed sometimes. Like anything to have the space stations not only look but feel different.

3. Interstellar travel. This is where the game stands out to me. The games usually go two routes:
- travel using jump points (these can be star gates, anomalies, whatever). This takes away a bit of your freedom, as you're dependent on objects that exist in certain places but it also creates routes along which the spaceships travel and this feels natural
- jump to any other star system from almost any point - this is something I quite dislike in Elite/Frontier games. when you jump into a system, you meet other ships but there's almost no reason for them to be there unless they're hunting for other pilots (or mining or travelling to other stations within a system but many systems are empty)
3030 Deathwar manages to combine both approaches and adds a bit of skill and exploration on top of that.

And this is one of the things I'd love to see in other space trading games:

See, there are nebulas between star systems. To travel safely between stars you have to avoid nebulas. Initially you have just a general map of them, you know what more or less to avoid. Later on you can buy a nebula radar which will allow you to find passages between nebulas to speed up the travel. I love this aspect of the game. I actually would love if you would have to run away from enemies to hide behind nebulas if they'd interfere with the radar system, etc.

Second thing I really like about space-travel system in 3030 Deathwar is that it mixes travel wihtin a star system and interstellar travel nicely. There's a device to perform such travel called split drive. If you engage it, you move much faster than without it. But within a star system, you're moving still at relatively low speed. When you leave it, you start to move much much faster. As space stations might be at different locations within a star system, sometimes it is a good idea to go around a star system to approach it from the other side, to enter the star system closer to your final destination.

Both of these features make space travel require a bit more thinking and makes it more exciting.

Even refuelling using fuel scoop is a bit more demanding as you have to plan ahead how much fuel you've got (although having hydrogen in your cargo doesn't hurt). In Elite: Dangerous you just jump system-to-system and when you're low on fuel, you get closer to the star. If you don't have a fuel scoop you have to plan ahead a bit, to know where is a safe place to get some fuel on the way but that's it. What's even worse is unless you use space trader tool, you won't even use longer routes usually. And space trader tool (or other tools) really break the game (unless you don't use it properly).

Trading. Haven't used it. Mined a few rocks but for most of the game, you're good with missions which get quite repetitive but that's the standard fare. I wish there are no procedurally generated missions in which you may choose what to do or that chain together with some simple stories behind them.

You are also not really encouraged to trade as you start with a space taxi and get enough money by taking people and packages to get a better ship. Then you're somehow stick to the missions as they're easy money. And then you also get significant amounts of money as you reach certain milestones. The only times I used trading computers are when I was dropping loot.

But there's much more to the game than just trading and actual fedex missions or people transport. There's the standard deal with mining but there is also looting derelicts which on its own is a minigame and also is a bit of a separate story about a mythical derelict full of gold that you might end up hunting when you finish the main story line.

You may also be a pirate but I am not sure if the game doesn't make it too easy for you by letting you into the normal stations. Only blocking them when you try to reenter them within a certain time.

Haven't yet tried to shoot people in the bar which might be possible. There are certain moments in the story where you may talk to the characters. Having an option to bring out the gun turns out really useful at times. [spoiler]I loved the climax, where you meet the villians in person and you have a total control. While I decided to talk to the first villian I met and learn as much as possible, I decided to that I will kill them last. When I stopped talking, I immediately pulled out my gun,killed them and went to the main villian. He turned around, seemingly expecting to have a chit-chat first only to meet my gun and get killed. This is something I used to hate in some of the movies, the final explosure and ability to skip it, to just wreck the final guy, feels amazing.[/spoiler].

The game is relatively short and while there is a certain amount of things to do once you finish the story, I guess that many people may already had explored the whole (small) galaxy and won't find much to do. But the few hours you get from doing the main story line are still worth both the money and your time.

The main gameplay is like in Elite and all the others of the genre, explore, do some repetitive missions like mining, taxiing, pirate hunting, get more money, buy a better ship, upgrade it, repeat. Along with that, you get lots of dialogues that are actually very well written, funny, quirky, absurd, like in an 80s B movie. You also get some sort of story driven campaign, but let us be fair, it was underwhelming (very short, abrupt ending, no plot twists...). Truthfully, they should have spent less time on some parts (like the basic NPCs dialogues or the ship upgrades) and more on this main story, which deserved better. The Galaxy is fine, but gets very repetitive. There are many ships to have, and yet as soon as I bought my 1 million ship, I realised there was no incentive for me to keep buying the other ones, it's not as if the interior of the ship changed or something - barely a bit of maneuvering. The visuals are what they are: lots of bitmaps and sprites glued to your screen! either you laugh with them or at them, but I was not bothered (it is indie and totally in the spirit of the game). Now the last thing I need to mention if you are still hesitant: if you are a music fan, buy this game... just for the music! WOW!

And especially my hats off to The Kyoto Connection, main band featured in this game, WOW, totally fits the game, the retro-futuristic feel of it, a tremendous sound!

[*]	Ship combat is frantic and fun reminiscent of old arcade shooters 
[*]	There is a ton of personality in its art style form neon lights space stations to various design of space ships to the unusual and quirky citizens that live in this place 
[*]	There are quite a number of things to do which is quite impressive, mining, pirate hunting, taxi jobs, delivery, photography jobs 
[*]	Dialogue is often entertaining and quirky 
[*]	Music is really good having synthwaves like music during the space shootouts and exploring space. There is also quite a lot of musical tracks and variety 
[/list]

[b] The Bad [/b]
[list]
[*]	While there is variety, sadly there is limitation in its systems. The same areas are often used in salvaging missions. Most space stations although have unique personality is essentially the same layout. 
[*]      Repetitive game design, the ship combat starts to be a repeat of the same old especially in the late game. 
[*]	Variety in locations only start if you follow the main storyline 
[*]	A lot of info dump at the start
[*]	Humor is not for everyone though

[h1] Summary [/h1]

[b] Gameplay 6 - [/b] Its a fun open world space simulator with some fun top down action. Its impressive what they have did in terms of offering variety of missions and jobs as well as some light puzzle adventure moments. Sadly it is hindered by repetitive game design in the late stages and side content. 

[b] Graphics 5 - [/b] While its nothing to shout about, it oozes a lot of personality and each ship and quirky denizens of the galaxy do feel very distinct 

[b] Sound 7 - [/b] The music and sound effects in this game is quite good giving you a ton of variety. From synthwave beats, to some quirky cantina music reminiscent of star wars cantina music with its own unique flavour. The variety in musical tracks is quite amazing making the journey of exploring this quirky galaxy quite relaxing at times.

[b] Story 6 - [/b] While there is nothing new about this cliche absurd sci fi adventure, it still has quite a lot to offer in terms of humor and bizzare but overall entertaining writing. Although in my opinion the humor is not for everyone    

[h1] The Review [/h1] 

If there is one thing to be said about 3030 Deathwar redux, its definitely, quirky, unusual but surprisingly fun to go around this bonkers galaxy. 3030 Deathwar redux is made by developer Bird in the Sky. This 10 year project honestly brims with personality despite some quirks and flaws in this rogue-lite space shooting adventure.

The games starts as you, John Falcon and his crew finds a dead body on his newly acquired ship after a salvaging gig. On returning to the closest space port to find answers, he and his crew soon finds out they are in bigger trouble. John new ship is impounded as stolen, his crew members have to be let go for the time being, while he is stuck on a measly dingy space ship looking for work. Here the game leaves you to your own devices to either follow the bizarre mildly absurd comedic premise or go around and literally do your own thing making it a pretty interesting space simulator as well. There is not much handholding when it comes to the basic tutorial as it explains what you need and just leaves you at the airlock to fumble along. I did wish that they did a better way of introducing the mechanics of the game because for the first hour, I was bombarded with all sort of information and was pretty lost.

But once I figured out how to use the maps properly and the various computer consoles to get jobs, upgrades or sell merchandise and cargo, the game starts to open up. Deathwar 3030 redux requires quite a bit of experimentation to get the hang of things from salvaging, mining, being a space taxi driver, bounty hunter, pirate hunter, photographer and even a space cleaning garbage men. It controls well enough with its variety of ships taking a book from other top down arcade shooters. Controlling with basic WASD and spacebar to shoot. For the most part the game does not really throw a barrage of bullet hell moments, instead it eases you slowly into this bonkers adventure and music of this absurd galaxy. Although at times combat can be pretty frantic with a few bullet hell moments which can be pretty fun. There is also a ton of ships to experiment. Ship variety is plentiful and adds some depth. For example bigger ships usually benefit in bringing more cargo but are difficult to maneuver in a combat situation where as small fighter are quick and nimble but can only bring a small cargo. 

There are other things added as well. Away from the top down space action moments, you can explore derelict ships for salvage with you floating around with your radar that locates loot and cargo. However this side scrolling salvaging areas always feel the same and becomes remarkably repetitive in the game with the same layouts as well as enemies. This really puts me off into salvaging any derelicts. With that being said, what I find impressive is the way Deathwar adds variety to the simple top down action gameplay. Taxi and delivery missions are added timers which add some depth as you contemplate which ship have enough cabin space or a thruster to get you fast enough to that location. Same as garbage disposal. Although these mechanics are not new and have been done before, it’s a nice addition to the simple top down action gameplay which takes a large portion of the time.  

3030 Deathwar redux continuously throws all sort of random moments and things at you letting you experience the absurd cliché moments of the game through its quirky writing. However the humor is a bit of hit and miss. It’s not for everyone, with John sarcastic replies and the denizen’s goofy banter but it overall works for me. It does have a very Lucas arts adventure feel of old as you move around the pixelated environment and talk to all sorts of characters when you are out of your ship. The pixelated graphics although not impressive definitely has a lot of personality with its neon light space stations, goofy bars, and bizarre funny alien design. The music is another bonus with its often entertaining synthwave bliss tracks and cantina music which differs from space station to combat to exploration. I was surprise at the amount of musical tracks that this game has as it kept the mood always interesting.  Sadly the game illusion starts to falter in the later stages as you realize the combat never changes much, most of the space stations have the same layout with some nice visual designs to differentiate from the rest, and salvaging is remarkably repetitive. It’s also kind of a miss opportunity the developer did not go further with playing around with the point click adventure moments with more puzzles which could have even added more variety. 

However it is commendable what the developers have done, giving you a wide variety of things to do with the limitations they have. This game does brim with a lot of passion. The humour may not be for everyone but for RM 30 which is roughly 7 USD, this budget indy space simulator/ adventure game does offer quite a bit of content and replay value for your money's worth if you can look past some of its flaws.",1625543655,1625543689,True,14,0,0.678225338459014893,3,True,False,False,False,,,

-player controls single ship, many new ships for trade in, ship is upgrade-able with many parts, weapons is combination of one turret plus a front mounted gun as the main attack, missiles and homing mines as sub attack.
-adventure story happens mostly while on stations, specifically in the bars of the station.
-has simple mining, tractor beam for cargo and people, and a mini game called derelict ship looting.
-No dynamic economy.

The music of this game just blew me away. They are not the original soundtracks of this game, just some music and songs under the Creative Commons license. One of the band responsible for the captivating songs in this game is called The Kyoto Connection, they are a band from Argentina. The album is called No Headphones Required . And there was another great musician responsible for the adventure music called Kevin MacLeod. Whoever decided to use their music, you are the real mvp of this game. 

The space combat is nicely done. A bit to the easy side but that is exactly what I liked because I have slow fingers. Pew pew pew. The character art is quite detailed , especially those small items, whoever did that is very perceptive artist. The weakest link of the chain is actually the story, it is short, a bit lackluster  , and not enough presence of female characters involved(sigh was hoping to see some romance plots). I got the second best ship of the game, but the story can be finish in about 25 hours if you don't want to grind for  the better ships and better weapons. All in all a great experience.

Edit: Now for those interested in the same genre, you might want to give Starsector a shot (it is a fleet combat game, you still control one ship directly but the 30 ships following you around is still too much for me). It is not on steam yet. For steam games you might like Gaia Beyond and Starcom Nexus. I was playing Gaia Beyond and I think it is far prettier than any other top-down space shooters on steam right now. There is a game called Endless Sky which I heard is a total legend so you might want to check it out too, it is free by the way. And there is Space Pirates and Zombies, it is a dated game so it looks a bit ugly to me but you might like it. I tried Star Valor, but dislike its implementation of ship ability and perks being unlocked only after your death, it is a mechanic used by roguelike genre to keep you from experiencing the whole game from the get go, by locking important game content behind ""death wall"" so to speak.",1621075111,1621089241,True,4,0,0.563559770584106445,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Music - Very unique, kind of reminds me of Cowbow Bepop.  Not the same, but reminds me of it.

Dialogue - Others have mentioned cliche dialogue which is an unfair review.  This was the intent, and it works.  Of course it's cliche, but a couple of times I have chuckled.  If you are expecting serious writing, move on.  If you go watch a Godzilla movie, and you are mad giant monsters are in the movie, then that is on you!
Ship Combat - It's simple pew pew, yet still fun to upgrade your ship and blow stuff up.  I like complicated simulations, but sometimes I just want to pew pew.

Combine the best parts of every 2D space game you have ever played and add some Neo- Japanese cultural revolution plus some acid and you get this.

Soundtrack alone was worth every cent, the gameplay was fast and loose, plenty of tactical 2d space pewpew without getting overly technical. Ships get stronger but never so much that you're ever completely safe. Crash a deathbowl and you will soon see what i mean...

I will admit to spending way too much time squashing bugs....

the story is easy to follow, perhaps a little too easy at times, and although extremely interesting it does have a solid foot in the ""linear"" side of things.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I recommend this game as a decent, affordable, space shooter.  It's not the best space shooter I have played, nor is it the worst.  It's simplistic.  So why am I recommending it?  Because I think it's a good game for what it's trying to do, especially for the price point.  I purchased it on sale and don't regret supporting the developer.  If it's on sale, I'd say give it a try.  You may end up liking it.  If you breeze through the story in the beginning of the game, you can try out the combat before the 2 hour mark so you can get a refund if you really don't think it's for you.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

I am someone who likes complicated systems when it comes to designing a ship.  While this one does have different ways to upgrade your ship, I didn't find it fulfilling enough.  It also had a mix of click-based story telling.  Those aren't my strong suit,

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I made multiple purchases during a sale that was happening, including this game, so I moved on to another game I had purchased.  I doubt I will re-visit this game unless I want a simple space shooter with text-based story telling.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.

Aber verdammt, während jeder Teil für sich allein mich wenig angesprochen hätte, hat die Art und Weise, wie es zusammengewürfelt worden ist etwas ergeben, das sich über die Summe der Einzelteile mehr als erheben konnte.

Here are a few of my complaints::

1) - There is no reason to explore derelict ships other than the first few you encounter. They are all the same in all the star systems.

2) - Mining asteroids is extremely unprofitable and a waste of time unless you are really into doing so. You get constantly interrupted by NPC's offering to protect you or buy your ores to the point that you get little done. 

3) - The best ways for making money and using your time is in completing taxi missions or hunting pirates.

Than's not to say it's janky, mind. As a videogame/software package, it's competently put together. 

Despite the indie-esque depth problems, it manages to successfully check most every major box necessary for a space-trading game. It has pretty much everything you would expect from one of these games. It is a true-blue successful entry in the genre, if a minor one. What its various bits and pieces lack in oomph, it makes up for in charm and clever development, a wry and prevailing sense of humour, and being 100% in tune with the genre.

Mechanically speaking, in space it's basically Asteroids, on stations it's basically old Lucasarts. Each side is done pretty well. It has a fairly lengthy progression system in place via ship upgrades, but it's not something you would consider an RPG-style mechanic as the whole thing is pretty much oriented towards opening doors and then making your ship better. There are only two consumables complexifying that stairway that I've encountered, one being missiles, and the other being a shield recharge.

It has a pretty interesting story and handles pacing and characters pretty well.

If I had any criticism for the game, it would be that the trading is a little weak. This is something that a lot of the games in the genre have trouble with though; which is somewhat ironic when you consider that a genre half-named for a particular mechanic would have it be one that it so frequently underserves. 

The game generally sets up systems to have buy/sell relationships with other systems in their vicinity, but the profits are usually lowball. There are higher-value commodities, but these are in very short supply and are mostly relevant to the salvaging mechanic. There are a couple of those higher-tier commodities that can be bought in limited quantities in various places and held on to before selling at a particular place that buys them very high, and this will generally net the best profits per sell, but it does take a significant amount of time. 

Also, there is a supply-and-demand mechanic in the game which will alter these prices across sessions; that mechanic is nothing I would consider additive, though, given the time it takes to make a full sell of the better cargoes. The trading system is also fairly opaque with almost no mechanisms to demystify it and nothing to gain current price information remotely, with basically only trial-and-error and then some best-guessing as tools to succeed. It all adds up to a mechanic that is somewhat underwhelming.

Trading is not a total wash, though. I found a couple of nice 3-point routes, including one where you couldn't refuel in the middle system, thereby adding a bit of extra interest. You can combine the mission board with trading very well (which is something not even the big players in the genre manage to do as well as this game), and when so done, the profits are relevant to timely progression.

You won't get a tenth as much time out of this as you will from the old standbys of this genre, but what you will get is funny, 100% authentic to the genre, and enjoyable, and then you'll have some time to for the love of god play something else once in a while.

Some of the non-game music may make you want to kill yourself. Watch out for that.

You may start liking that music. Double watch out for that.

Really lo-fi but really good.

It is the gameplay is a mix of  the old 'Space Flight' and 'Frontier: Elite 2' with a short adventure game story stuck on.

I recognize many of the games that influenced this, but I did not play them myself. I've been catching up in the modern era. 3030 Deathwar is one of the best space games I have played.

Admittedly, it's not perfect. Procedural station missions are where the bulk of the money is made, but they don't seem to take the stats of one's current ship into account.  For instance, cargo space never matters outside of holding extra fuel and the destination range doesn't seem to extend with ship speed. Meanwhile, there's a limit of 4 simultaneous missions so it's never made up for in bulk. Fortunately, the ship/upgrade prices are balanced such that the grind isn't excessive. It just makes the ships feel less rewarding.

Outside of stations, mining seemed nigh useless even with sensors and trading felt like too much manual tracking. Salvaging, however, at least provided a distraction and allowed items like nebula sector maps to found. All three of these activities give a reason to actually have that cargo space if you're interested.

The flying is fun. Momentum and turn rate are considered.  There's obstacles to avoid, debris to shoot, and ship traffic for you to use your best judgement on. Dogfighting can be performed with a front-facing gun and/or a turret while split engines double as quick dodges.

The campaign is light, but enjoyable. The jokes, thankfully, are not as full of pop culture references as the visual art of the NPC species wandering the galaxy. (Don't worry about those Steam workshop ship mods breaking immersion.) I spent about 20 hours. There is no real replay value.

I don't mean flying everywhere, spamming lasers at everything until the area's clear. What I mean is  thinking about your actions, resources, and goals. Do you have enough fuel? Should I save for a better ship? Would using a missile to kill this pirate cost me more than the bounty I would get? You might be considering options such as ""If I chase after this wanted space pirate for their bounty, I can still sell the cargo I purchased at this station, but I'll need to navigate around nebula clouds to reach the system.""

There is a story that works as a very functional tutorial without forcing the player to follow a very strict path. You can be a trader, derelict ship salvager, bounty hunter, pirate, ore miner, cargo deliveryman, taxi, or many of the above. You can, and likely will, multitask and switch as often as you like.

Movement and navigation is easy to learn and satisfying to master. Even the basic and most cautious movement will get you where you need to go. However, everything above that will make your flying better, your travel more efficient, your battles more strategic, and you feeling like a spaceship flying master.

The gripes I have are mostly with the game's style. The visuals' low-res style rarely benefit from the pixelation, and sometimes make things look homogeneous, due to a lack of small details. The music during flight is absolutely amazing, but the music within stations is boring and often unfitting.

Nevertheless, this is one of the best games I've played, and it truly fulfills the dreams of flying a futuristic spaceship and doing what you want.

Quick answer buy it!...The long...I can not believe i missed this game when it first came out.  I really love this game.  It has a fantastic pixel art style i love with many individuals from other scifi shows, and the style does have an 80/90's throwback feel that compliments the game.  Now the Sound and Music, i got to hand it to the developers who selected these tracks, as they are superb, i really loved the music and it really compliments the look and feel of the game, as the main character has that cool Indiana Jones look it perfectly fits the Indi in space, and although there is some dialogue that may come across as tongue in cheek or even a bit rude, it perfectly sums up the type of criminals you will be dealing with.  The UI and controls are a little rigid and unfriendly to some, but i actually thought it complimented the games style perfectly.  I had my doubts at first but wow what a game.  This is a gem and really appreciate all the work they put into this game.  It shows in its simple yet addictive play style.  It can be a little bit of a grind at times with the mission types and the main plot does seem to somewhat short, however it could be because i could not stop playing this game.

The story is engaging and includes unique gameplay elements, but it's pretty short. It only took me about 10 hours to complete, including a couple hours of grinding for a better ship (that got taken away from me by the story anyway, so I had to grind it again). The mid- to endgame goes by crazy fast as there are a couple hefty cash incentives you get for visiting every system and completing the game, catapulting you pretty much entirely over the $2-$3 mil ships if you're not spending it on upgrades, which I think is a shame. It means you spend most of your time with the worst ships or the best ships, so a lot of the ship variety goes to waste.

A huge bugbear I have with the game is the lack of unique scripted missions. There are [b]zero[/b] scripted side quests. Everything is procedural with very little variation outside of the story mode. You'll be doing the same handful of mission types the whole time. Even other smaller space games like Void Destroyer 2 know that just a handful of uniquely scripted sidequests really serve to liven up your universe. This game... doesn't have them for some reason.

The story mode and the 80's atmosphere and odd neo-noir aesthetic are the driving force behind this game, with the 80's-inspired pop soundtrack really serving to set the mood as you do the same things you do in every other space adventure game, just... easier. There's no challenge here. Fortunately, the game's story is written in an entertaining manner and the ending is incredibly cathartic. Like, the ending is really, [i]really[/i] good.

now this might be subjectual but i realy, realy love the HUD and the UI, they work perfectly, give you all the information you need, but most important: they look the part. in many games you get stellar 3d-grafic, but an UI/HUD straight from good old PS1 days. the whole design fits perfectly and never breaks the immersion.

Everything about this game screams ""it's a labour of love by an amateur developers that are bravely developing way outside of their comfort zones"", and I'm not sure it's really worth playing.


The biggest, jankiest problem with the game is that it's simply a mass of cobbled together systems/things with no overarching UX or game design. This inconsistency is annoying as a) it increases the friction involved when first learning the game and, once learnt, when playing it; b) it seems like this kind of thing is unnoticed by the developers or that they simply don't care/have time, which means players will feel the game isn't the ""best"" it could be. 

Some examples of tedious inconsistency:

* Information is presented in a completely inconsistent way. Message appear all over the screen - top left, top right, middle, bottom, in menus etc. There's no one, single place you need to look to see important information, you need to look everywhere. 

* When the spaceship controls are set to ""mouse + keyboard"", you get a very useful dotted line showing where the front of the ship is and where it intersects the outer edge of the HUD. This is useful for navigating when warping between stars... but it's not needed when you have a mouse cursor. Yet the line is not present when set to keyboard-only, which is when it would be genuinely useful!

* On a similar theme, when in adventure game mode, when exploring a derelict ship, and when using ""keyboard only ship controls"", space bar is ""fire"". Yet when using ""keyboard + mouse"" ship controls space is now suddenly used to deactivate the controls.... why? Why not keep it consistent with everything else and keep it as fire, and make some other random button ""deactivate controls""?? 

* Infact, keys aren't even remappable, meaning I can't change this madness myself.

* The mission scripting is all over the place. Some things are ""missions"" that you can see in the mission list, and others are ""contacts"". Both end up with you going places, talking to people, and getting paid. But the contacts thing was presumably chosen for some of the missions to let you workaround their own weird saving system that doesn't let you save when you have a ""mission"", but is fine when you have a contract??? Also some of the ""contact"" mission sequences (e.g. the gold ship) just randomly disappear without explaining themselves.

* The graphics implementation is a very ""brave choice"", though I often feel like it wasn't much of a choice as more of a ""best we can do"", as the developers thought that scaling, rotating, and filtering hand-drawn pixel art was a good idea. (It's not! Why ruin the nice art?)


But it's not all doom and gloom, 

e.g. 
* the look and theme of the game is very interesting
* the music and the way it changes is a nice touch (though varies in quality!)


Still, in terms of gameplay it suffers from a clear lack of polish in terms of the experience a player goes through.
e.g. The game is clearly intended to be played as a ""story"", but yet it also presents it self as an ""open world, do anything!"" kind of game, even going so far as to use those terms. But ""doing anything"" just means you get way ahead of the intended power-curve and the story missions are then rather trivial and boring to play through. I'm aware that even AAA ""open world"" titles suffer this problem, and it's not an easy one to solve, but the game makes no attempt to solve it.

Infact I'm surprised the game even wants you to do it's open-world stuff, 
as the open world gameplay is quite boring. Trading is tedious, as it requires the player to manually take note of a system's good's prices (yawn) and you can't see a system's prices until you get there (double-yawn). To top it all off: it doesn't make enough money! You can make most of the money from pick-up-and-deliver missions and bounty hunting, which are much more interesting. Some also comes from ""salvage"" missions which are weird little mini-games were you float through an empty ship picking up stuff, but that's also tedious and jankily implemented.


So the janktactular nature of the game means that even though it's quite enjoyable to play, and kinda satisfies the Escape-velocity itch, I could only actually will myself to play if I  ""got past"" the inconsistency issues and directionless ""game design"".  Which means it just leaves me wanting to play Escape Velocity: Nova or some other better-implemented game in this style.

thanks for your write-up. This game has been a passion project for us, developed over the course of well over 10 years. We worked on it besides our main jobs, and so only had limited time and resources to spend, which might help explain some of your complaints.

We agree that saving the game anytime, rebindable key controls and nicer graphics would be pretty great, but we had to decide between that and making the missions and story more fun, and ended up going with the latter.

In the end, we just wanted to make the most enjoyable game for people to play, and tried to add as much stuff that made the experience as fun as possible, but that also meant having to cut some features unfortunately. 

In any case, we hope the game was still somewhat enjoyable to you. Thanks for the feedback, and thanks for playing the game!

 It's a little Escape Velocity type of game with very charming presentation.

As far as the gameplay, the ship control feels pretty good and I like zip zooming around blasting things to some extent, but it's also got some issues.  First, no lateral thrust is kind of disappointing, but not a huge problem.  Second, the way ship weapons are handled is kind of awful.  Your ship has a front weapon mount, and maybe a turret weapon mount, but you can't fire them separately (???) which is awful.  Also, you're supposed to be able to left click to fire your turret/weapon, but it doesn't work, so you're stuck holding down spacebar to fire.

The UI is minimal to the point of barely being functional.  The radar appears as a faded out overlay in the center of the screen, which sucks.  The Map is very bare bones and so is the navigation UI, leading to situations where it just feels like a janky pain in the ass to travel to places. 

But I did enjoy the story vignettes (you are running from space mafia hitmen), the mission system works well, and blasting enemy ships can be fun if you stick to only turret or only mounted weapons.

thanks for the feedback!

You can actually choose how much or how little space combat you want to have in your game. If you avoid certain mission types and events like MONEYBALL, you shouldn't have very much combat at all.

Another good way of making this more enjoyable is upgrading your ship with a turret and missiles. These are much easier to fight with, and will hopefully make combat a lot more fun for you.

You can also go to the game options and set the ""Gang activity"" setting to the lowest setting, so you don't get the occasional hit squads attacking you later in the story.

I hope some of this helps!

Some of these parts are good, like the jam in a sponge cake. Some of these parts are bad, like the rest of a sponge cake. Let's run through what makes Deathwar tick (and I'll ditch the cake analogy - for now).

First up, flying around in space. Here you'll pilot a 2D ship through 2D space, beautifully rendered in 24 caret sci-fi themed pixel art. There's combat, junk busting, cargo collecting, exploring, missions, and possibly a few other things I've forgotten. It works well, runs smoothly and has a few quirks and perks along the way to keep things fresh (pilots randomly offering to help, or to sell you illicit goods).

Then there's the on-station portion of the game. When you need to stop off and stretch your legs, you dock with a space station and get around in a side scrolling, adventure style UI. Pretty much all stations look and play the same (with art changes on the bar area and different styles of background, but fundamentally it's the same makeup every time). You can go to the bar and talk to the patrons; interesting for the first few dozen times but after that you'll start ignoring all but those required to fulfill your current mission. There's also a mission computer and a market/ship/parts computer. Pretty run of the mill, you take various kinds of missions to make money and sometimes advance the story. Ships get bigger, faster, better, have more storage etc, depending on how you want to play. You can play the market and be a trader, but I found the mission route was far more lucrative and only went to the market for fuel and to sell the crap I found on salvage missions (more in a second). Very occasionally you have to fight someone with your pistol while on the station. The shooting part worked about as well as pasting head-shots of your new girlfriend over the face of your old girlfriend on the pics you have hanging over your fireplace. Actually I'm not sure that analogy works, but I spent five minutes dreaming it up so it stays. Stations play a valuable role in the theme and feel of the game, while the shooting part felt shoehorned in, slapped over the top for the hell of it. It was just one more thing they tried to jam into an already crowded game - one thing too far. I mean, now I read that statement and compare it with my girlfriend analogy, it's painfully clear how crap that analogy is. Moving on.

Salvage. When encountering a hulk you have the option of conducting a salvage run. This was pretty cool the first 10 times, zipping about in your space suit, zapping aliens, collecting cool stuff and looting the dead meat popsicles. After that magical 10th time it kind of waned in entertainment value, which is a shame. You weren't forced to salvage but it could be a lucrative income stream. I'm not sure what the developer could do anything to improve things without an overhaul; the mould was cast and each salvage mission played out like like the previous ones. Float, dodge, shoot, grab, escape. Never once did I feel particularly threatened.

Now take these parts, smoosh them into a single game, and what do you have? Is it coherent? Like the proverbial sponge cake, you have some good parts (the jam center), some okay bits you can tolerate (the cake), and some parts you sort of ignore or flick off onto your plate (cream, half priced fruit the baker added in a failed and misguided attempt to jazz things up). I loved the first ten hours of Deathwar. Zipping here and there, zapping this and that, getting into the game loop of making money, exploring a bit more, getting a new ship, upgrading that ship, taking on new missions. Repeat. The story was ok. I could ignore the dull bits and it just sort of progressed on its own time-frame. Then, once more akin to the majestic sponge cake, it all stopped being fun and became a chore. The words ""rinse, repeat"" spring to mind.

If Deathwar was the only game I owned, I may have persisted. I mean, it's not bad - in fact, it's quite a good game - I just don't love this sort of game enough to persist and push through. Like every gamer these days, my collection is frighteningly large and half of them remain unplayed, or with a play time still shy of the single digit hour mark. Therefore, I dropped it. Right or wrong, fair or not, I felt I'd played though all the cool content, seen what there was to see, and future content was all going to be variations on the same themes. However, I can definitely see that if you do like this sort of game, or love the art style, then that'll be enough for you to plow on and see the end credits.

With all of that said and all of the caveats and the hand wringing and the fact I dropped it after 13 hours, it is with only a tiny amount of hesitation that I recommend 3030 Deathwar. It was a game I loved, then played casually, then dropped like an old sponge cake I just found at the back of the fridge in an orange Tupperware container.

VERDICT: Layered like a sponge cake, no wait...damn it I should have used layer cake as an analogy. Anyway, like a dessert option with more than one component, Deathwar is greater than the sum of its parts and can be enjoyed as one big, messy whole. Definitely worth playing on the cheap, or worth playing anytime if you love this kind of game (Space Pirates and Zombies comes to mind as something similar).

Final Word: It's a decent game with lots of parts. RECOMMENDED

(shit, I forgot to say the music was cool. Hey, the music is cool!)

Lots of recommendations from people I trust.  Had it on my wishlist a long time, and finally picked it up.

- Lucasarts SCUMM-VM like adventure: Point-and-click adventure game on stations, funny dialogue, cutscenes, nice story.
- Well paced upgrade paths, technology trickled out such that you get to experience a bunch of it and not just plot optimal paths through the tech tree
- lots of options.  different ship choices for different playstyles
- combat not too hard
- Free-roaming sandbox game world that can be explored while doing the story

The main gameplay loop is solid, you bounce from system to system doing various missions and upgrading your ship. The top down space combat, while simplistic, is brisk and chaotic, and is the part of the game I enjoyed most. Unfortunately, the missions themselves are a major letdown and a tedious slog.

Side missions, which is what you'll be spending most of your time on, are incredibly tedious. Most consist of traveling from point A to point B or from point A to point B to point C. Nothing interesting happens along the way, no pirates to contend with, no random events, no challenge aside from watching your fuel gauge. The only obstacle are nebulas, which only serve to slow you down and annoy me to no end. Bounty hunting is fun at first, but gets old quick thanks to how the behavior of pirates never change, they always use the same tactics and their ships have little variation. Mining consists of parking your ship next to asteroids and pressing a button, slightly more engaging than delivery errands but that's not saying much. Derelicts earn you little money and become just as repetitive as everything else.

For the most part, the story missions are just reskinned side missions. The adventure bits where you walk around on the surface of a planet or shoot killer robots with a dinky pistol were enjoyable, but these happen so infrequently that they can't make up for the lack of variation in the main story missions. The only interesting story mission apart from these adventure segments was near the end of the game when I had to take on a small fleet in order to destroy a larger ship. I really wished the developers focused more on the adventure bits and made more of them. The story itself is rather forgettable. A few lines did give me a chuckle and I do enjoy the main character's interactions with others. Otherwise, the story is a rather generic doomsday plot that loses steam halfway through the game.

A big issue is the fact that the game never progresses in any substantial way. In the 9 hours I played, the pay rate for the average mission never rose beyond $30,000 while ship costs rose higher and higher. The missions were the exact same hour 1 as they were in hour 9, only that you would have to travel farther and with a time limit. Once you did each type of mission, you pretty much did them all. The exception to this were bounties, which would add enemies protecting the bounty if the reward is higher. Still, this capped out at around 3-4 additional enemies and sometimes those enemies wouldn't spawn, leading to an easy fight that was over in a few seconds. The ships don't really change much either aside from basic stats. Each ship has a single front weapon and/or a turret with some missiles, that's it. There is an upgrade that doubles your front weapon output, but it still doesn't change much and I never saw an enemy with this upgrade. Each fight plays out the exact same way with no variation, run circles around the enemy and occasionally activate ECM to destroy missiles. There are no special weapons like a gravity bomb or a harpoon to play around with, all weapons either shoot a generic energy projectile or a laser beam.

There is nothing particularly frustrating or horrible about 3030 Deathwar, but there's nothing really great about it either. It's a few good moments buried under a slew of forgettable filler. Even though the developers said that it took them 10 years to make this, it certainly doesn't feel like it needed to take this long.",1566713177,1566713177,False,8,2,0.534102678298950195,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Similar games in the genre: Escape Velocity, Endless Sky, Star Control, Rebel Galaxy.  If you like the gameplay loop of making money and upgrading ships through the usual means (trading/mining/exploring/bounty-hunting/pirating)... chances are you'll enjoy this one.  Its a genre that there needs to be a lot more of, in my opinion.  And this is a relatively recommendable entry.  A bit short, though.  And no side-quests.  You're going to be either mainlining the story or doing repeatable missions with a little optional exploration sprinkled in.


Pros:
+ Lots of ships to choose from.  Mostly boils down to fighters or traders, but other options are there.
+ Lots of ship system upgrades.  The majority of these are straightforward (e.g. shield recharge rate), but there are a few creative ideas that give your vehicle a more personal and 'realistic' feel.  Many of which add new UI elements to your screen.
+ Ship flight feels good
+ Progression to better ships and upgrades feels natural and goes at a good pace for the most part.
+ Lots of visual detail in and around stations gives a pretty unique feel to the game.
+ Very friendly and helpful devs.  Very small team... true indies.

= A couple interesting attempts at genre-blending... Namely: the on-station adventure game element... and the ""twin-stick shooter lite"" scavenging mini-game.  Disappointingly, neither of these have much depth to them.  Dialogue choice has no consequences at all from what I could tell.  There is no challenge or risk/reward system to the adventure or scavenging aspects.  For example: perhaps they could have added some in-station adventures as sidequests with some light puzzles that would unlock some sort of unique ship, weapon, or upgrade.  Perhaps the ship-scavenging could have been made shorter, or expanded upon.  Still, these little detours from space trucking weren't terrible, and they serve as a short break from the norm.
= Station computer missions are the usual.  A decent variety of them, but they are all pretty basic.  None of them lead to anything more interesting.  Deliver package here.  Kill pirate outside.  Take picture and bring it back.

- No customizable controls.
- Lack of modern fullscreen/resolution options.  Beware bugs going past 1080p.
- VERY little content outside of the main story line.  There are a few secrets here and there, but nothing substantial.
- Manual mining and trading are perhaps the slowest and least profitable activities by far.  At least until you get a very large cargo hold.  But by that time you will have seen all of the game's content.
- If you're new to this genre of game (and even if you aren't), the UI is a bit of a mess.  The map system in particular is disjointed.  Even with practice, it seems the map system could have been better designed.  If you're going from one system to the next, you have to sort-of juggle your map controls a bunch to see where you're going.
- Once you leave the tutorial sector, all the content feels VERY cut-and-paste.  Nothing new to discover.  Especially stations.  Not much point in talking to people.
- Very small selection of weapons.  Weapon customization on ships is also extremely bare-bones.  There are, at most, only two slots for weapons on ALL ships; A single forward mount and a single turret mount.  Some ships have only one type.  If you install one in both slots, their fire rate and damage is halved.
- No true ship customization.  Every ship can have the exact same systems installed on them as any other.
- Weapon sounds are awful.  Not going to pull any punches here.


It brings a few neat ideas to the genre, but those ideas aren't really taken to any meaningful lengths.  It's also missing so many simple things that could have made the core combat and gameplay much more satisfying.  Salvaging abandoned pirate ships and taking their ships/weapons, for example.  Or adding a simple hardpoint customization to ships.  Adding more weapon types?

It does the basics so well though, which is why I'm still recommending it.  Its most of what you're looking for in this genre of game, and nothing in 3030 DeathWar Redux is offensively bad.

This game is at best, okay. There are some really decent game play pieces here that just largely go under utilized, or so poorly balanced even though fun, feel like a total waste of time.

There is a huge amount of repetition right from the start, typical of these space merc games admittedly, but this is worse than most simply because of the lack of any variety.  There's only so many times you can read the same quest text about someone's wife recently dying so they can't pay you more before it starts to feel ridiculous.  I have no idea if this is some inside joke or just a genuinely bad random mission generator text.  The reason I mention in joke possibilities is because the game is full of them of which I have absolutely no knowledge of.  

So, all of the random missions are basically the same, and they don't in the slightest pay for the annoyance of doing them.  Destroying debris outside of space stations is supposed to award 250 credits but usually awards just shy of 1k.  Also you can get decent paying missions to complete just to clear junk.  But it makes it clear pretty fast that whats happening is that junk is stacked up oddly, so you shoot 1 junk, get credits and quest credit for 3-4.  You want the best ship in the game, get the fastest cheapest ship and go blow up junk for 2 hours, congratulations, you broke the game.  

So, there is a story which is nice, but its just random jobs, often of obnoxious fedexing things back and forth.  A couple times random mini games are introduced and never seen again, which seems a shame because at least that was variety for 20 seconds.  My favorite part of the story was when I'd gotten myself a nice big beefy ship and the story quest forced me into one of three chosen ones of only modest quality, forcing me to go fly somewhere else, to repurchase the ship i had just bought at a loss.  The story doesn't advance nearly fast enough to keep up with the simple progression of doing a few debris clearing sweeps. The pay ends up feeling insulting, the tasks boring, and then sometimes just massively annoyingly inconvenient for no reason except, if I was feeling really generous, humor.  

Combat is, okay.  There are a lot of upgrades to your ship, except all the guns are basically the same, missiles are expensive and you can't upgrade the durability of your ship at all.  The first ship you get has the same shields as the last ship you'll get. So fighting more than 2 or 3 ship is basically gonna be a big risk of getting wrecked.  The one beam weapon in the game felt so unbelievably strong next to any other gun in the game I basically never changed it.  The range doesn't matter because enemies have the inexplicable ability to teleport right next to you anytime they seem to want.   

Salvaging is fun at first, but falls off so hard in its time to reward ratio that its kind of a waste. Mining on the other hand is painful at first, then becomes by far the easiest way to make cash, aside from the broken debris clearing anyway.

Now that's all the stuff that's okay.  The bad stuff largely concern the navigation mechanics.  An absolutely indecipherable radar system, and multiple awkward key presses for system and ""galaxy"" maps are very frustrating.  Fuel is a huge pain, that becomes just a non issue as soon as you get a fuel scoop. You can barely upgrade your fuel efficiency so it exists merely as a gate keeping time sink. The nebula exists as an obstacle only as a means of extreme inconvenience.  It holds no navigational, strategic or anything of value, it is a stupid time sink for no reason.  If exploring it provided any sense of value or reward, I wouldn't mind.  

Trying to track loose floating cargo is impossible.  

Dropping way points, called buoys, is a one and done.  So find a wormhole, yay, fast travel.  Except you can't mark it in anyway except with a buoy you can only carry one of at a time, and that you can't rename as far as I could tell.

Things that I found great about the game

+ Really fun game play
+ Open world galaxy
+ Plenty of funny moments and funny story
+ Lots to do if you don't rush the main story
+ Quite a number of upgrades for the ships and plenty of different ships to purchase and fly.

+ Great references to tons of classic games spanning the 80's and 90's

Piccolo capolavoro indie che davvero getta nuova linfa al genere Sci-Fi, rivista in questa chiave del tutto che scontata che, se giocata come si deve, può regalare ore e ore di pure divertimento e sano coinvolgimento.

You can (and should) just use the radar and the artistic drawing of the nebula clouds. Spaceship weapons and upgrades overpower the value of the ships themselves.

This is by far one of the best ones out there. The aesthetics are great. Yes, its a small indie game, but its filled with love and some great work.

Pros:
-Plot is nice
-great aesthetics
-Space sim is interesting
-lots of ways to make dough

Cons:
-Trade simulation is not a system, but handcrafted numbers
-Salvaging ships is interesting but feel repetitive
-Ship to ship combat is not very well fleshed out
-gun combat does not work very properly
-Had some frame lag in some parts of the game(later on planets)

Aesthetics:
This is a great looking game, full of eastereggs, visually interesting places, and great character design. Nothing is 'forced' or ugly, its all nice. Some stations do feel repetitive and you will see that some stations look just like other staions on the inside. On the outside, each station looks unique and interesting, its sad that the interiors and characters inside just feel as repetitive as any other station.

Combat:
Every ship has the same AI. Battles will end up feeling a bit repetitive, but you do need to destroy some enemies, it also gives you plenty of cash if you capture live pirates, so you can just target pirates and go looting their cargo or just bounty hunting. 

Trading:
It consists basically of finding where stuff is sold low and bought high, market doesnt fluctuate or is a complete simulation. Wish the trading part of the game were a little bit deeper or that you could create a trading company, set routes and have a fleet(or hired guards).


Gameplay loop:
Do delivery and taxi missions, get a freighter to buy and sell cargo whenever you stop or after you sell clocked missions. Most combat you will just avoid unless you get a bounty mission, those reward a lot of cash. Also dont forget to buy upgrades, they are essential.


Review:
This is a great open world game, its not 'procedural' or a full on simulation. it doest emulate the best of space out of many games i have seen so far, many focus on the combat or other ship elements, but they all forget about the ambience and aesthetics of space, its plot and visuals will show you how well crafted this has been

An essential game for anyone that likes space games, just dont expect to stay in this game for too long.

Probably my favorite approach to the combat element of any game in this genre I've seen. Usually I expect combat in this style to be a painfully awkward slugging match that tests which ship has the highest stats rather than rewarding handling skill to any great degree. I wouldn't say 3030 Deathwar's combat is [i]great[/i], but it does manage to be engaging and even satisfying at times. Especially when you realize that you can perform micro-warp maneuvers to help dodge and approach enemies.

Long-distance travel is also superior in its genre. Rather than instantly teleporting between star systems, you maintain direct control the entire way, with increasingly efficient time-dilation as you travel further from systems and hazards. The result is that you aren't taken out of the game as much during long voyages and you keep that atmosphere of exploration and mild loneliness in the vastness of space.

The excellent soundtrack and awesome visual effects also help keep lengthy trips fun.

The story is by far the weakest part. The writing is bafflingly awkward and the plot is extremely superficial. But it's not obnoxious, and even has some fun moments of self-awareness and visual humor. You can safely ignore it most of the time, including after completing the story which does not require more than a few hours if you focus on it exclusively.

The graphics look dated. In the space-travel segments, which are most of the gameplay, they are more charming, and even gorgeous at parts. The adventure game-ish segments where your character walks around space stations or other environments are much rougher, but not necessarily awful depending on your taste.

My biggest disappointment is just that there's not more content to this game. I'd like to explore a setting and story as vast as, say, Escape Velocity: Nova just with these flight mechanics, visual style, and music.

So I think that works out to a positive recommendation, even a strong one. I'd say it's easily worth picking up for $5-10. Higher than that and you might want to make sure you're really going to be into its particular gameplay and visual style, but still worth investigating.

For a while I was looking for a space game that fits the description of sandbox with exploration and space fight. As in some of other reviews I can confirm that there was a lot of thought put into this game... at least the first half. 

PROS:
- The game gradually introduces you into various game mechanics without holding your hand, which gives you that nice feeling of accomplishment so many titles are missing.
- Pretty nice range of ships to buy with some decent customization.
- Music is on a plus side but after few hours you may want to disable it... there is only so much you can listen to specific song ;P

CONS:
- As much as the start and mid game is fun, the end game seems to be missing something. I found myself looking at ship upgrade, and was unable to pinpoint a good way to earn money. Just trying to get 3.000.000 doing 20-30.000 missions (mining, delivery etc) means I have to do it 100 times... given I get max payout. Add some randomization = lower pay and it gets boring. The most expensive ship is 8.000.000 and there are no better ways to find money... so do the math
- Space battle may seems alright at the beginning but after a while I found it a broken system.
  -- missiles do little damage and you are limited to few (depending on the ship)
  -- projectile weapons scatter therefore you need to get close to get a decent DPS... with enemies literally teleporting around this gets quite annoying
  -- two ways to fight, that I found most enjoyable are; shot and fly where the mouse is pointing, but the huge downside is that you wont be able to strafe aside easily to avoid incoming fire, as such even the best shield with more than 1 enemy seems pointless. // you get a ship with turret and switch to keyboard and mouse control - you can move freely and hit the target but due to scatter you may miss majority of shots.

The main problem with this game is how the fighting is designed. To get the max damage you need to install weapon on turret and front (turret turns where you aim and front... always shots ahead of you DUH ;) This causes big problems later when neutral or friendly ships are around. Both guns shoot with one button so you find yourself quite often using turret while front is facing neutrals/friendlies - and accidently you are sharing some DPS with them as well. This in result agro friendlies on you and you need to pay fines at stations that initially welcome you back with friendly fire as well.

To sum up:
Game will definitely give you a lot of enjoyment. For the price, just getting 10 hrs of play is way worth it, but don't be surprised to get annoyed with end game. I had some fun but not feeling upset leaving this game half way. A lot of potential and will definitely try it again if they release a follow up.

This is a game that keeps the core of what keeps so many of us gaming in focus: good solid gameplay. It doesn't try to be anything that it isn't.

One reviewer I saw online equated this to a mash of Space Quest, Freelancer/Privateer, and Star Wars. Not sure about that last one, maybe I would substitute Subspace in there instead. Either way, it was absolutely as advertised in their great trailer. While the main story was short, if you messed around with the more open gameplay elements, trying out all the different jobs, playing moneyball, bounty hunting, mining, trading, exploring, bumping people outside a station, and a bunch of other random activities. If you tried all those along the way, the game certainly feels a lot fuller than rushing the story, which I think many people do.

I certainly wasn't expecting there to be so much optional content as there was. Definitely a ton of fun to be had in this title. 

+ Really fun gameplay
+ Comedic storytelling
+ Lots to do if you don't beeline the main story
+ Tons of upgrades/ship types that all help enhance the 'lots to do'
+ Awesome soundtrack
+ Great references to a ton of classic games
+ Price/content ratio is astronomical

- Not a ton of replayability, all the more reason not to rush the main story

В ней всё очень ламповое и как будто родное. Весь геймплей состоит в том чтобы летать по планетам, трейдиться, таксовать и воевать в космосе с пиратами(сразу вспоминается сега и денди). Есть возможность и самому стать пиратом, правда кроме всеобщей агрессии и неудобств с этого мало что можно поиметь.
На ваш вкус и цвет предлагается куча разных кораблей, каждый из которых хорошо подойдёт для тех или иных типов миссий, ну или не подойдёт вообще не для чего(самые дешманские корыта).
Очень порадовали космические фоны и эффекты полёта- сделано дёшево(очень просто), но сердито. Музыка отлично подходит для дальних ""плаваний""- расслабляет и дарит хорошее настроение.
Очень расстроила продолжительность сюжета- он настолько короткий, что я искренне офигел- буквально пару полётов по планетам, пару загадок для детей и всё. Разработчики творили маленькой тимой- именно поэтому всего тааак мало, но работа проделана великолепная. Тем не менее, сам сюжет подан в стиле комических боевиков 90-х- это так же позволяет поностальгировать о былых временах.
Игра совершенно не напрягает, особенно когда разберёшься со всеми механиками. Прохождения по ней нет, поэтому если возникнут вопросы- с радостью отвечу на них в комментариях(или в друзья залетайте).
3030 DEATHWAR REDUX - A SPACE ODYSSEY заслуживает покупки даже по полной цене- в отличие от всяких зажравшихся ААА-проектов, где несмотря на имя, репутацию, количество кодеров и денег всё делается через одно место, не оптимизируется и вообще фу, эта игра сделана С ДУШОЙ. А это однозначно стоит благодарности разрабам, ведь они подарят вам действительно приятные воспоминания о коротком, но весёлом и ламповом путешествии в космосе.

It's one of the weirdest experiences because I start to say ""I wish this game had...."" and before I know it I quickly find out that it's actually a feature of the game.

So much heart and thought went behind every idea in this game. Nothing seems half baked and it's apparent that during the development they took the time to test every process. It's so fluid and intuitive. Every action seems to have some sort of QOL feature already built in.

I'm still early in the game and as a new player my only annoyances are the fact that I can't save during a mission and despite the controls being easy to learn there seems to be extra steps that aren't needed. For instance to dock at a location I have to press Q -> Tab -> 1. Which doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

If you have played anything similar to Freelancer (you have a ship, make money in any way you want, find cool shit, become a god) then you will absolutely like this. 

Added bonus: The music is simply amazing. You can set what soundtracks to use and when the game switches songs. I was getting annoyed that I would be jamming to an amazing song while flying but it switched songs whenever I docked. Well guess what. There is a setting so that it doesn't do that.

we can't write a full history here, but the ""10 years in the making"" was meant as a thankyou to those that supported us, and showing that this is a project of long-term dedication. The core of the game was coded more than 10 yrs ago, then after a long gap of maybe 7 or 8 yrs, we started work on a fresh updated version which improved the game a huge amount. All the time this has been a part time project and the remaining very old code has limited what would have been possible with modern engines.

Since full release we have continued to add more content and opened up modding to allow more content to be added in future. We are sorry you were disappointed by the game. This was a very long-term passion project for us, and we only hoped to bring people joy with it. Perhaps as additional features or modding work is done you'll give the game another try and enjoy it better."

I love space exploration games, as well as open-world adventure. This delivers both, though it sometimes feels like a tease, as if there should be more to explore and greater variation in missions. In some ways, this feels almost like a demo that only lets you see a little bit of what the game can deliver.

Graphics and Sound:
The retro graphics look great, as well as the ship designs; many of which look like cars retrofitted for space travel. The overall look and feel of the game is fantastic, and it is a world you want to explore more of. Unfortunately, due to a ""quarantine"" written into the story, you can only visit the bar and job consoles inside each station and are only given a tease as to to what the rest looks like. Every station feels exactly the same really quickly, with just a few minor scenery changes, which gets old. You can talk to the other patrons, but as few have any sort of side-quest for you (and these are extremely short), the amount of interesting dialog dries up really fast. I admit, I do like that the occasional character looks like Kryten from Red Dwarf, and you'll sometimes get a bar droid that looks exactly like Crow from Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The sound effects are fitting, but what really stands out is the soundtrack. While in space the game often plays random songs by The Kyoto Connection; a highly underrated band (I bought one of their albums just because of this game), which adds another level of atmosphere.
Controls and Combat:
I use an X-Box controller and found the controls both fluid and easy to memorise. However, as some reviewers have already mentioned, the space combat is extremely easy. I used a plasma cutter, which you can purchase fairly early. And though it has a short range, it can shred an enemy ship in a matter of seconds. When on board stations, or the very brief scene where you can actually go planet-side, your character moves on a two-dimensional plane and there are only a couple times when you need to use your gun. It's very simple, but not bad. Though like the space combat, it lacks in difficulty.
Gameplay and Missions:
As this is an open-world game, you are not required to follow the main story plot at all. And even if you do, you can still continue playing even after you've beaten the main game. However, for being open-world, the main plot is extremely linear and fairly easy to beat. Honestly, it can be finished in about an hour and was really anti-climactic. A shame, because the dialog, especially between the villains, is often witty and hilarious. Some reviewers have complained about the excessive profanity, but honestly, I thought it added to the humour. I do like being able to explore derelicts and mine asteroids, which can earn you funds to upgrade your ship; plus you can haul passengers or parcels to various stations for cash. Shooting of space junk is also a means of earning a small stipend. However, once you've beaten the main game and / or maxed out all your ship upgrades, it quickly gets repetitive.
Characters:
While the main protagonist, John Falcon, has a decent story, the secondary characters are lacking. There is a short side-plot involving Kent the robot, which is entertaining, yet once it's finished, you don't interact with Kent at all anymore; he just follows you around the station. A shame, because he has some really funny dialog. And the other main character, Vasquez (her first name is never given) does almost nothing. You see her a couple times, yet after she links up with you again towards the end of the main story, you have zero interaction with her.
Overall:
3030 Deathwar is a fun game that I do recommend, just keep your expectations realistic. As it was made by a small, independent company, I'm not expecting a vast world with hundreds of open-ended side stories, i.e. ""Then Elder Scrolls in Space"" (hmm, Bethesda should make that!). The retro graphics, excellent soundtrack, and great visual ambiance are what gives it replay value. The controls are also excellent and make for a solid gameplay experience. The paper-thin plot and tasks that become repetitive very quickly don't necessarily detract, they just leave you wanting more. This is a game I would actually like to see some DLC; more quests, a larger and more varied universe to explore, more characters with meaningful interaction, and access to the rest of each station.

The missions are fun for less than an hour, after a while I just accepted bounty missions, or killed pirates without missions. The battles aren't very hard, but at least more fun than taxi or delivery jobs. The story isn't really interesting, dropped out of that after a while.

Most frustrating is the fact, that ""friendly fire"" immediatly makes every friendly attack you. There are this events, where giant battles between police and pirates take place, where you are supposed to help out. But a single friendly fire hit makes all police try to kill you. Meanwhile, the police keeps friendly firing non stop...

Salvaging, the thing the story tries to tell you to do, is really boring and not really worth it. In comparison, everything but bounty hunting just didn't seem worth it money wise...

The story also doesn't acknowledge it, when you found the one ship you're supposed to be looking for. And you're supposed to enter it multiple times, which the game doesn't tell you. So I've found the ship on my first salvage by chance and ignored it, until it disappeard. Since I didn't have much cargo space on my ship, it was absolutly worthless.

There also is this ""interesting"" idea of ""money ball"". Apperently an illegal and dangerous game, which should be a good opportunity to make money. Well, you get almost no money out of it, it's really boring, and the first few times, I killed everyone, because I didn't understood the goal.

Hi there! Beta tester Axl RAID here.

This game is some kind of blend between Space Top Down Shooter and a Point & Click feeling when aboard stations and some other scenes (when outside the ship in short).

The OST is very nice & original and above all the devs are more than nice people.
Just for this last statement 3030DWR - ASO deserves your money even when not on sale.

OK I'm the credits so my opinion isn't totally objective but it is when I say this game is a good game.
The last update added a lot a new stuff and when you know that even before it was good, now it is best as ever.

Believe me when I say that the devs are nice people.
3030 Deathwar Redux is a game made with love. Love for Videogames and love for gamers. Just try it and you'll feel it.

If you're in this kind of games you should appreciate this one, I bet it. Just click that ""BUY"" button.

Salut! C'est Axl RAID des beta testeurs.

Ce jeu est un genre de mélange entre Top Down Shooter spatial et une ambiance Point & Click lorsque vous êtes dans les stations et certaines autres scènes (quand vous n'êtes pas dans le vaisseau en bref).

La bande son est aussi top qu'originale et par dessus tout les devs sont des types plus que supers.
Rien que pour ce dernier point 3030DWR - ASO mérite votre argent, même à plein tarif.

OK je suis dans les crédits donc mon avis n'est pas tout à fait objectif mais il l'est quand je vous dit que ce jeu est un bon jeu. La dernière mise à jour vient de rajouter une tonne de nouveau contenu et quand on sait qu'avant c'était déjà un bon jeu, maintenant il est encore meilleur que jamais.

Croyez moi quand je vous dit que les devs sont des gens biens.
3030 Deathwar Redux est un jeu fait avec amour. Avec l'amour des jeux vidéo et l'amour (platonique je vous rassure) des joueurs. Un jeu développé par et pour les joueurs en somme. Essayez le et vous le sentirez très vite.

Not like ""moist"" or ""turgid,""  but because that's what developers usually say when they take all the creative stuff out of a game so they can try to sell it to more people.

Sometimes it's not a bad thing, though.
 
Imagine how terrible this little game could have been if they had clogged it up with a lot of complex controls, ""realistic"" features and obstacles between you and the fun.  Here, there's no screwing around. You just hop in your ship, stomp the gas pedal and go.   Living the space life has never been so easy!

There's a lot of different stuff to do in order to progress and upgrade your ship: play the story missions, deliver packages, hunt pirates, enter races, shoot at space junk, haul trade goods, etc. You can pretty much do anything in less than 5 minutes.  It all feels quick and intuitive and doesn't waste your time, which I really appreciated.  It's probably tough to strike a balance like that in one of these open-world, Freelancer-style space sims which are usually geared more toward depth and complexity.

The story fits right in with this breezy little world.  It's funny and silly, and they play around with all the usual space cliches on purpose; but on the other hand it's still a real story, and not just a bunch of dumb pop culture references trying to be snarky and clever.  They walk pretty close to the fourth wall sometimes but never completely break character, so you stay invested.
  
Hell, even just flying around feels great.  The way they transition between your warp drive (or whatever it's called) and your normal speed as you move within and between systems is so seamless and nimble.
  
Man, I can't get over this.  It's like these guys actually want you to enjoy playing their game.

Imagine that!

Here's what I liked:

// The graphics are sweet, and also the most immediate throwback to the retro vibe that gives this game a sense of nostalgia while still being original.

// The music is a really nice touch.  I'll admit, I was a little weirded out when I was first playing and suddenly the music had lyrics.  I can't think of any games I've played, at least anytime recently, where the music had lyrics.  So I thought that was a strange choice, until I looked a little deeper and learned that the bulk of the music in the game is performed by The Kyoto Connection (TKC), a sort of electro/synth pop group from Argentina.  This was an appropriate choice for music in the end, since many of the synthy electronic sounds in their music, combined with the pop-ish singing, lends itself very well to the type of game that 3030 is, even if some find it a little unusual.

// There are some obvious character inspirations in the game, which is not necessarily needed but definitely very cool.  The main character could easily be a cross between Indiana Jones, and Lone Star.

// The gameplay is fun enough to play casually without being too deeply involved, and the plot is entertaining, with the potential to be so much larger, which leads me to my next thing..

Here's what I didn't like so much:

// The story, while short enough to be easily digestible, is very short in a way that I found disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the story.  It's just way too short.  To the credit of the developers, they don't overstate the game as being this big, epic thing. But by the time I completed the story, with a ship that the game had given me less than halfway through (which I didn't even want), I just felt like it was not only too easy but also too short.  What I'm saying, really, is that I feel the story could have been much more expansive, especially given how many systems there are to explore, and yet you only go to maybe half of them throughout the story.

// 3030 has much less replay value than what I first expected.  After completing the story, there really isn't much point to playing the game, unless you feel like grinding low-value missions to save up enough space credits to get a ship that you actually wanted, which I did do, by the way.  But afterwards, I played for another 10 minutes before turning it off.  The ship I saved up for and bought was cool, but there just wasn't any reason to fly it anymore, other than for the sake of passing time before playing the next game.

TLDR; It's a really fun game, and I might have missed mentioning some mechanics that make it cool, but that's not really relevant--it's definitely worth the asking price and even though the story is short, I still played it for a good bit of time (4-6 hrs) after finishing it.  Definitely recommend, even at full price, and would love to see if any more story content is added later. Cheers to the devs for creating a game they wanted to create.",1551665365,1551665707,True,4,0,0.558599710464477539,0,True,False,False,False,,,

we're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the game.

We have gathered a lot of feedback, through testing, forums, Discord and of course Steam reviews. The spacing of characters at bars was never mentioned before, so I'm not sure what the issue there is. You can actually turn down the moving speed on stations if you find it difficult to talk to certain characters. You might also be accidentally talking to the bar droid (happens to all of us), so just wait a second for them to move out of the way.

As for the 2 hours of gameplay, I'd just like to mention that most players are reporting 10-15 hours for completing the main storyline, and easily twice or three times that if you enjoy exploring the universe and earning money for top end ships and equipment.

It would be great if you could give the game another shot with those changed settings. Please let us know what you think!

All the best,
Max, Matt and Mike"

If you really like old fashioned games, or at least those how apparently look old fashioned, than this is a must have and absolutely recommended. Its beauty is in its simplicity.

3030 Deathwar Redux ia a solid, down-to-earth game which is easily able to let the player dive into its heavily 80´s inspired atmosphere. All parts fit together perfectly. One of the best stress reliefs for the after-work hours.

Sadly, 3030 Deathwar falls flat on its face.
It’s an extremely monotonous grind in which you find yourself in one reskinned solar system or space station after another doing the same 4 types of jobs for money. I tried to justify playing thinking the grind might be worth it, but characterization and story kind of petered out and the ships never got more fun or interesting. 
Despite the first scene alluding to a point click adventure style, that element of the game is virtually non-existent. 
Combat is extremely lackluster. There is no challenge whatsoever.
Dialogue is corny, boring, and it begs to be skipped.
All the controls are clunky and convoluted on a system that could’ve been streamlined so easily.

I say revival because unlike many ""remake-like"" games that hold their source material in overly-reverent regard, warts and all, 3030 breathes new life into the best and most exciting parts of the EV series and dumps everything that doesn't work.

The basics are still there: Start with bad ship and no money. Do jobs. Make money. Get better ship. Do more jobs. Make more money. Get better ship. Start hunting pirates for fun and profit. Start buying out the local market and flipping cargo for easy profit. Do some story missions and build your reputation. Get better ship. Shoot everything that makes eye contact. Demand tribute. Take over a planet or five. Get better ship. Own a personal galactic armada. You get the picture.

I've played a lot of Escape Velocity. I grew up with a Mac in my house, so Ambrosia SW games defined that era of PowerPC gaming for me (such as it was). There is a lot about that original gameplay loop that is drilled into my brain. 3030 updates virtually every one of the core mechanics to make this game feel modern and responsive, while retaining the massive open-universe do-what-you-want scope that made the original EV so enticing.

For instance, one specific detail that absolutely does it for me: in EV, the Bar was an interaction on nearly every station that let you meet weird characters and advance plot points. However, running on a 60 MHz Performa meant that most of the plot went down via text boxes. 3030 takes that underloved system and moves it front-and-center - each station has a fully interactive Bar with dozens (hundreds??) of looks, background characters, drinks, and dialogue trees. The end result is that you're not just making a binary choice with a block of ASCII or delivering the idea of a package to a rewards screen - you're meeting in a seedy, derelict dive with your contact for better-paying work. It's a huge boon for immersion and gameplay depth.

3030 is a winner across all the checkboxes that matter to me. The soundtrack is fantastic, the visuals are rich and almost elegant in self-imposed 90's low-memory-ugliness, there is an astounding amount of snappy dialogue hiding behind even mundane characters, the derelict EVA-suit mechanic makes exploration and looting feel compelling, extra-spatial nebula complicate the act of getting from point A to B just enough to keep you on your toes, there is a story with characters I almost immediately cared about, the options menu is so interesting as to warrant its own entry, and hot dang, it even manages to be funny without falling into farce or cringe. 

I will update this review as I get further into the endgame, but this game is an awesome surprise and scratches a long-forgotten itch. It sounds trite, but playing 3030 makes me laugh and smile. Highly recommended.",1549295700,1549308180,True,15,0,0.693810820579528809,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Well nevermind back to the game. It basically has two kind of settings. Either you stay in a bar where you can take jobs, squash some bucks and buy stuff like upgrades for your ship, fuel, goods, etc or you can fly in one of the plenty star systems. When you are flying in space the game changes to a top-down view where you can gaze at the pixelated beauty of more or less busy parts of the infinite void. Here you can either shoot space junk, loot cargo, shoot pirates, get random trade offers or just travel around to amazing music. There is always stuff to do and it is totally up to you what you are doing with your time. So nobody is going to hold your hand big boi! 
Oh there is also a story going on which is quite good on its own. But well, for me the space exploring and pirate shooting is way more fun. Just don't get attached to your ship to much, you might like that fighter jet but ooooh boi is it bad for looting cargo. So much guns, so little space for diamonds...
After all I can really recommend this game. It's pretty unique with a great atmosphere and has kept me entertained for roughly 10 hours now. And that is more than most people can realistically offer.",1548936358,1548936358,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

we're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the game out of the gate.

You can actually speed up the talking in cutscenes by either increasing the talk speed in the game options, or by left-clicking with mouse or hitting R3 on the controller.

Ich bestreite nicht, dass 3030 Deathwar nicht liebevoll gemacht ist, und es hat auch einen gewissen Charme. Aber beim Gameplay hört es dann auch schon wieder auf. 
Klar man kann verschiedene Missionen erledigen und machen was man will - das Todschagargument aller Freespace-A-Likes. Aber warum? Taxi fahren und Briefträger sein macht keinen Spaß, bringt nur Geld. Kopfgeld jagen ist mühseelig, da das Kampfsystem mäh ist. Mining und Trading sind kaum lukrativ, da man selbst mit einem Tading Ship nur so wenig Frachtraum hat, dass man kaum Gewinn generieren kann - jede Taxi-Mission bringt mehr ein als die beste Handelsroute.
Und dann die verschiedenen Schiffe - klar kann ich darauf sparen, aber wenn ich eines der kleinsten Schiffe für 30 000 Credits mit einer ordentlichen Wumme ausstatte, finde ich erst in den Millionen wieder ein Schiff, das damit konkurrieren kann. So ewig Geld zu farmen macht mir keinen Spaß. Im übrigen alles Dinge die beispielsweise in SPAZ besser funktionieren. Oder in Freespace.
Bleibt noch der 90er Adventure - Part: Hat bei mir leider auch nicht funktioniert. Die Grafik ist gar nicht meins - da sahen die Lucas Arts Adventures um Welten besser aus. Die Animationen sind richtiggehend schäbig. Und in den ersten 8 Stunden passiert zwar was aber weder mein Charakter noch die Spielwelt konnten wirklich gefallen - alles ziemlich generisch.
Fazit: Wer SPAZ oder Freespace oder sogar Elite Dangerous mag und sich nicht an den repetitiven Aufgaben stört, der kann im Sale schon mal einen Versuch wagen. Sonst würde ich eher abraten.",1546361400,1546361400,False,11,0,0.623052239418029785,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, unlike those games, it is played in top-down gameplay. I wasn’t sure about this at first but I’m having no issues with it. The graphics have a 90s retro feel to them...very similar to the classic Lucasarts and Sierra adventure games. The gameplay also has some point and click aspects of adventure games. You can walk into the bars and talk to NPCs and explore derelict space ships in your space suit and collect loot. The music is surprisingly well done and has a 80s and 90s vibe..it fits the game perfectly. Although, there is no voice acting which isn’t a big deal given the kind of game this is.

Haven't gotten too far in the story as of yet. Overall, it seems fun and the autosaves are fairly forgiving. My cheapo generic usb controller doesn't work with it. Always scrolls to the left for some reason. It works fine with emulators but I often have trouble with it for steam games. You don't need a controller though, and there are probably legit ones that work fine. It just depends on what you have.

My main gripe would be that the control scheme for the keyboard and mouse desperately needs an option for customization. There are a couple of modes to select from, but as of yet I hadn't figured out how to use the mouse ONLY for aiming. Right now both aiming and turning are linked which makes sense for the straight ahead shot, but makes the turret option not as useful as it could be.

If the developers added in complete control scheme customization, that would elevate this game from fairly good to very good or even great. Even so, that isn't a deal breaker and you can still have fun with this. The story/characters are fairly humorous and tongue in cheek rather than serious. That style is fine for me. As part of that, they also don't worry about being too PC or G rated, which is also good for me. That isn't to say that they get really graphic or something with raunchy stuff, they don't. But one example is one of the salvage things you can get is porno mags, but its not like you can browse through it (modders?).

Info Game: 
This is an open world space exploration game. Your new bought space ship is reported stolen and so the police take it away and give you a mini ship. You try to earn money with doing different kind of task. Selling items, be a taxi for different people, clean up space junk and attack pirates. That way you try to buy a bigger ship so you can earn even more money at the same time. The story is funny and you have different dialog options.  

Info achievements:
You have achievements for party of the story, but there are also a lot of achievements for doing the different tasks. Those seems a bit grindy, especially to get to 100 million money.  You can complte this game between 25 and 35 hours.

3030 Deathwar Redux is a charming little 90's throwback space adventure with a surprising amount of depth, ultimately allowing you to play how you want. You can choose a number of different ways to make money(pirating, salvaging, mining, trading, bounty hunting, missions), and they all are viable, and are balanced fairly well.  There are probably 5-10 different mission types, from towing a container, to killing a pirate they are pretty well varied.    

There are a fair amount of ships 20-30 over all you can purchase and all have their niches to support how you want to play the game, and probably 40-50 upgrades which are released throughout your 15-20 hours playing through the story.  There are a number of system upgrades (ecm, boost, cargo scanner, fuel scoop, asteroid scanner, etc) that you can purchase which they are both intuitive, easy to use, and ultimately better the over all experience.  

One of the highlights was the universe design; ultimatley you have one large map, and individual solar systems within the map.  In between solar systems (deepspace) you have a nebula that damage your ship if you drive through them.  So ultimately you can go anywhere within the map (universe) and even drop out of FTL in deepspace.  When you hit the gravitational boundry of a solar system it slows your FTL drive down considerably.  Overall the map design is solid, and how the environment interacts with your ship feels great. 

UI was also designed very well, it's non invasive and appears only when required.  It also gives you a solid understanding of the situtation with very little required from the user, which is ultimately the halmark of solid UI design.  

The core gameplay is top down view on your ship, game play in this mode is responsive and the systems work really well toghether(ecm, FTL, tractorbeam, etc).  The secondary game play is the side scrolling aspect which ocurs within salvaging, space stations, and on some planets within the main storyline.  This is an area that while not terrible could probably use a bit more work, for example when you pull your side arm you stop and cannot move.  It just feels clunky in comparison to the rest of the game which is well polished. 

The universe for the most part does feel alive and lived in.  There are ships flying around in system, miners mining, police, moneyball races, all add to the feeling of the universe being lived in and alive.  There are a few random events that occur in system such as distress beacons ships about to explode, but this could definately be increased.  The distress beacon definately isn't really explained very well and is on a timer, and ultimately each ship I encountered ended up blowing up. 

Overall 3030 Deathwar Redux is a great game, and I highly suggest it if you enjoy games such as Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, and the X series.  The developers state this was a labor of love over 10 years, and I don't doubt it, its a solid well designed game, and ultimately it's a lot of fun. 

What I would love to see in 3030 Deathwar Redux 2: 
Emergent dynamic gameplay, a reason to stay in the universe after the story ends.  
Factions, with dynamic waring parties.
Construction, X series style construction and fleet construction would be amazing.
Destructable bases/space ports.

I took a chance on this game at 50% on recent steam sale -Bird in Sky really nailed it, for me as an adult gamer where time is my most limited resource. If you like space exploration/adventure it's hard to go wrong with this one.

What I liked about it:
-Aesthetics & pacing - The 2D Vector mechanic really reminded me of Grand Theft Auto 2- Due to the simplicity of the controls, you can really get into action very quickly.
-80's Retro futuristic vibe with so many loving fan-culture references. Likewise the synth-pop soundtrack takes you back in time.
-Intuitive controls, which just work. The learning curve of controls and exposure to new mechanics is fast, steady and engages you.
-Space-Adventure RPG progression, with considerably less serious grind mechanic than Elite. You can take on whatever mission types you want, and your profit margins aren't too tight. Typical missions can be completed in 2-4 minutes- Much less of a sense of waiting to travel between systems than say Elite.
-Adventure-lite game mechanic - This draws strongly on Lucasarts influences, although the writing quality felt a bit amateur.


What could be better:
-Ship design balance - For combat and most missions 've been playing, high engine power and turn radius were critical features - and one of the first ships in the game has no rivals on these dimensions. I felt like main plot milk runs and combat doesn't reward you much to experiment with alternate styles of midrange ships, until you've unlocked rather high spec ships. 
-Space station layouts and Salvage locations looked distinctive, but quickly felt repetitive. Note: Elite Dangerous, a much grander title has very similar limitation.

I wouldn't say that they grew on me, but the game is a bit deeper than the graphics make it look.

So, what's the game like? It's actually very similar to Rebel Galaxy, except of course for the combat, which is more like a shallower, more fast-paced EV Nova.

I've mentioned depth already, and that's because the whole game is shallower than I'd expected. There are maybe 6 or 10 different randomly generated side mission types, but I only tried 2 or 3 because there was no point in doing any other types. The only thing to grind for is money - no reputation or anything, and that's fine with me, but it does limit the variety of mission rewards and lead to ""what mission type is the easiest for the most money, and let's do that one only."" Money is pretty hard to come by, since the missions barely scale with your progression; at the start, you'll make maybe 6k credits per mission, and at the end, most of the missions will give 20-30k...and the best ships cost around 6 million. There's no particular reason to get the best ships, so it's not *really* a problem, but it just feels kind of hollow. It doesn't help that the missions don't particularly ramp up in difficulty. You won't see anything like Rebel Galaxy's ""penetrate a blockade"" or ""survive a delivery"". 

I didn't bother trying to trade, since the game map is rather annoying to use and doesn't show discovered prices or let you make trade routes. 

So, that was a lot of complaining...BUT I still recommend the game. I had more fun than I have with most games. Combat, while nothing more than ""hold down spacebar and dodge enemy fire"", was enjoyable. Upgrading my ship was enjoyable. Most of all, the writing was funny and engaging, and struck just the right amount of silliness without becoming ridiculous (although there were a lot of spelling mistakes). And, in a way, I'm glad that the game didn't have too many complex systems, because depth can actually get in the way of itself and make a game overwhelming (eg Space Rangers). 

Thumbs up. I wish it had a little more meat, but 12 hours of playtime for $7.50 was more than worth it.",1543119018,1543119018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1 cup of [b]Elite[/b]

4 teaspoons of [b]Space, Pirates and Zombies[/b]
4 tablespoons of [b]great Soundtrack[/b]
3 teaspoons of [b]customization options[/b]
Put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir together until you have 3030 Deathwar Redux. (Don't forget the workshop topping!)

Meet John Falcon, a mixture of Indiana Jones and Han Solo and help him getting through his adventure. 
You are free to choose your path - will you be a trader? Hunt down Pirates? Space Taxi Driver? 
As it's an open world 2D Elite exploration game, you don't have to choose. 
The visuals are very well done and together with the great soundtrack (Instrumental + The Kyoto Connection), the game delivers a great retro-esque atmosphere.
The gameplay is really fun and as the game offers loads of customization options, the fun doesn't stop after you played through the initial quest. I am not through the game yet, as I am on my way saving money to get an even better ship plus upgrades. 
The devs are very active and responding, adding new features and getting rid of bugs all the time. 
For this reason, 3030 Deathwar Redux gets my vote for the ""Labor of Love"" Award 2018. I hope the devs will continue their journey through space with us, so I can nominate this game in 2019 also!

The Kyoto Connection sums it up nicely in one of their songs:

Now this is a 2d space shooter with a bit of trading and generic missions (go and kill, taxi, delivery boy, etc) thrown in. Main character has been blatantly ripped off from old Lucasarts games. In fact the whole ""adventure"" interface looks like 80s adventure games, at least after they got VGA face-lift. Unfortunately the adventure bit is more or less chatting to random npcs with random lines in generic 1-screen space stations.

The whole thing gives me 90s shareware game vibe. If you want 2d space shoot-em-up, space pirates and zombies is wastly prettier with tons of different ship types to whack. For generic delivery boy missions with occasional slightly scripted one, that goes down to just about every pc open end space game written.  It'd be unfair to compare to Elite:Dangerous but the structure is fairly similar.

I'm sure the story picks up a little bit but I just can't muster interest to keep on going.

The game universe is full of abandoned, or crashed ships and stations, which can be easily accessed and searched for some valuable loot. By the start of the game, your character managed to gather a working crew, collect quite some money and purchased new ship. However quite soon it turns out that the ship he purchased, was stolen, with previous owner’s body found dead inside. Local police force provides John with basic ship to travel within the system limits and some spare credits as a compensation, while investigation is going on.

Universe itself is full of many tiny details, which you find out through rumors and dialogues, or through various magazines. For example, most of the pilots are unable to land on planets, which leads them to having complications in getting coffee, or bath. This is why you can meet one of cruise liners in space, which serve as something similar to our ocean cruise ships, with full spectrum of entertainment on board. Or you can meet a space trucker, who carries huge amount of cargo. So much so that it resembles more of a train, than a spaceship honestly. And I didn’t even cover bars at local space stations where you can land, talk to random pilots, or take jobs. So yeah, as you understand, the universe itself is quite rich lore-wise.

[h1]Gameplay analysis:[/h1]
As it was mentioned in the introduction part, ‘Deathwar’ is 2D space adventure, which means that most of the time you’ll view your ship from top-down point of view. Landing on space stations, or abandoned vessels, though, switches you to the side 2D perspective. In terms of tone overall, game feels like those quests from ‘90s, so if you enjoyed, say, “Space Quest”, maybe you’ll like this atmosphere too.

Perhaps the best part about the game is the amount of possible secondary missions, which surely counts a dozen of different jobs, to say the least. Most of them mean that you’ll just need to go from point A to point B, though, but wide variety of ships you can pilot, makes you capable of immersing into your secondary role. Do you enjoy delivering cargo? Get a vessel which is capable of pulling many tons of cargo. Prefer working as a taxi driver? Feel free to buy yourself a space bus. Yes, an actual bus without wheels. 

Quite often you’ll find yourself trying to fit your ship for multiple roles at same time, though. It’s nothing bad really, but keep in mind that in many cases when buying a new ship, you’ll need to sacrifice something, in order to get bonuses for something else, that you need more. So, as you can see, the choice can be quite tough sometimes, especially given the fact that there are multiple dozen different ships, or even more, who knows...

As we started talking about the ships, I couldn’t just refrain from devoting another paragraph to their upgrades. There are so many upgrades for the ship, so that some “Pimp my ride” show can easily die of jealousy. Missiles? Throttle boost? Shields? Mines? Cargo or ship scanners? Literally anything one’s soul might want. But yeah, most of those upgrades tend to appear with time, so you’ll have to stick to very basic stuff during first hours.

 [h1]Visuals:[/h1]
Cheapish looking graphics. Truth to be said, though – game looks like that [i]intentionally[/i], however I couldn’t help but smirk few times at start. That first reaction tends to pass with time though. You just need to get used to the game style.

Perhaps, ‘Deathwar’ can be called retro futuristic in some way, as game literally copies most of our everyday objects, adds up some futuristic details to them and just drags it into the game! There are some exceptions to that rule, of course, but you’ll get my idea once you’ll see flying police Chevrolet corvette without two-flags sign and wheels.

Overall, though, game looks interesting and quite variative: here you can see a huge shuttle at the space, which looks even more gigantic, compared to your first vessel. Yet at the next moment you land at space station, go to the bar and you can see usual ‘small’ cars, which size doesn’t look so tiny anymore. On contraty, you find them quite big too! 

Another paragraph, perhaps, would be devoted to the scavenging abandoned vessels and stations, as it’s fully working side-game with separate mechanics, where you jump into a space suit and explore various blown up debris, while trying to recover the bodies of possible survivors, loot some crates and shooting whatever hostiles are present on the ship. Not all life forms you meet are dangerous, though. Some of them can charge up your suit with extra energy. Overall, this mechanic, despite being done in rather simplish way, feels quite interesting and alone manages to diversify the gameplay.

[h1]The sound:[/h1]
Music in the game feels quite cool. Surprisingly enough, songs with female vocalist make you wanna stay in space for one more minute, just for the sake of listening the song till the end. Other, non-vocal songs are pleasant to listen too, of course. In all honesty, game should have the OST as a separate DLC.

Other sounds, like blaster shooting, or engine throttling, etc. feel usual and moderate every game ones, which is neither good nor a bad thing. So yeah, overall sound in ‘Deathwar’ isn’t something people usually complain on.

[i]With all that being said, let’s take a brief look at strong and weak sides of the game and come up with final verdict….[/i]

[h1]PRO’s:[/h1]
[b]-Funky, humorous style:[/b]
Game likes to bring various jokes during dialogues and overall it not even trying to look serious. Do you often see humorous space games? Neither do I.
[b]-The universe is rich for lore and events:[/b]
You can even easily meet a bounty hunter who would come up with a suggestion to secure your ship, but take any bounty for his kills… And run away as soon as he sees real space pirates. Or not… And it’s literally just one of many other events which bring so much life to the game.
[b]-Large variety of secondary jobs:[/b]
You can be almost anything, from standard bounty-hunter, delivery guy, or truck & bus driver, to professional trash-shooter, or even spy-style photo agent. It’s all in your hands.

[h1]CON’s and issues:[/h1]
[b]-Weak tutorial:[/b]
Basically, you quickly forget what was shown in the tutorial and then have to re-discover how some things work. Just remember that game doesn’t have controls change option yet, so F1 key is your best helper in some situations.
[b]-Clunky space combat:[/b]
Maybe on higher tier levels it’s different, but on lower tiers you simply can’t turn your gun as a turret, and have to turn whole ship if you want to aim at the enemy. That mechanic adds up ‘interesting’ gameplay, where you feel like you’re playing 16-bit space arcade, rather than modern indie game.
[b]-Odd map navigation:[/b]
Navigation in this game is overcomplicated, as universe and local star system maps are done in somewhat clunky way.

[h1]The conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, ‘3030 Deathwar Redux - a Space Odyssey’ is quite interesting game with large variety of quests and side jobs for your choice, many lines of funky dialogues and a deep role immersing system. If you have weak PC or working laptop, this game will surely brighten up your days with fun, humorous gameplay.

As the info states it's a hybrid space sim/adventure game... 

The last patch helped out a with the space sim part as there a tons of ships available now in a pretty cool interface that reminds me of Space Rangers 2 a bit.... Is this a graphic intensive game, not at all, but it has it's own style which is pretty cool, heh. 

The soundtrack is awesome as well, has a lot of 80s vibe music when going around space and the pop culture and story bit seems pretty cool as well. 

If anything the only real complaint I have is you can't change any of the keybinds at all, which for lefties like me is a pain, luckily I can just go the auto-hot key route to get the keys where I want them too, but I honestly hate doing that and it always strikes me as odd when you don't get keybind options for the controls. 

Space Combat feels more like a rails shooter in a way, but overall there's not much tactics involved with it seems, just turn and manuever until you get lucky with good shots to take down the ship or ships attacking you. There is also slight grind in terms of trying to upgrade your ships and all, but it hasn't bothered me at all yet. 

I haven't really gotten involved in mining parts of the game yet, but I have done the savalaging of direlect ships, and overall that's pretty cool as well.. There doesn't seem to be any interesting gear or ship upgrades to find while savalaging at least from what i've done at first, so it's been more of a helpful Money Sink to get in a abaondon ship, and come out with a few cargo items to sell and good cash too, so we'll see if that changes as the game goes on. 

So, if you're bored waiting for the next big blockbuster and feel like trying out something new, it's well worth giving it a go.

A couple planet visits occur but there is no planet exploration.  There are many space stations having handfuls of people you may talk to.  All dialogue is text-only with humorous undertones.  Mining asteroids is possible.  Exploration of derelict ships, mapping out hull-damaging nebulae and rapid space flight ability add to the charm.  Keyboard mapping is okay but the user cannot remap keys.  No pause feature.  To game save, you must be at a station with no pending missions.  I've spent hundreds of hours in the 3D X-series games by Egosoft and was amazed that this 2D game could be as compelling to play.",1542083305,1542083305,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I feel like it would be the type of game I'd make if I knew how to make video games. I'd start with a list of desires, incorporate them into the game, and then pray they all worked well together.

What does this game have?
- Great music, but the number of tracks is limited so you'll hear many repeated.
- Clever game settings which control if songs switch when entering a new area. It is great to have this control.
- Several types of missions to earn money.
- Lots of ships and ship equipment to purchase.
- Space battles
- Open gameplay [/list]

The game is fun. I completed it in about 15 hours over the span of a weekend. It can tend to get a bit grindy as you complete jobs to earn money for ships, ship equipment, and ship repairs. But, you don't need the best ship to win this game, I suspect it can be won with almost any ship.

If there is a Deathwar 4040 in the works, I'd offer these suggestions:
-Don't limit the ships/upgrades available to the level of the story. I flew clear across the galaxy to find better equipment early in the game. It did not exist. Every system sold the same gear. New/better gear only arrived as the story progressed.

- The game spans a galaxy, but every station visited was essentially a duplicate. There was no feeling of scale or change.

- Keep the ship/equipment upgrade system. Being able to sell and change ships/equipment without huge penalties makes it more fun to experiment with different ship types.

- More, and varied jobs would be great. Current jobs are all are quite similar. The one unique job was Untangle the Circuit. It was one of the best jobs since it paid well, and could be completed without a lot of travel.

- Some game elements are ""hidden"". I was nearly 10 hours into the game before I found the little challenges about visiting 10 systems, visiting all the systems, and the badge/medal system for salvage.

- Look at that, I even nominated this game for an award, and updated my review for the 2018 Autum sale badge requirements.",1541991018,1542838843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In theory, there are several playstyles (miner, trader, taxi / delivery man, salvager, bounty hunter, pirate, etc.) but many of them are painful. Mining is very boring, and perhaps more importantly you'll need a large amount of cargo space to make money without frequent, tedious trips back to the station - cargo space that you probably won't be able to afford at the beginning of the game. Salvaging is less boring but has the same problem with cargo space. Trading has the same problem, and worse, there's no way to know what the prices of goods are at various stations unless you visit them all and write them down on a piece of paper or something, making it a real pain to find a trade route. Bounty hunting requires decent weapons which you won't have at the beginning, and the missions are rarely offered. Piracy practically limits you to the very few systems with pirate bases, which are mostly on the other side of the known universe and inaccessible at the start of the game. So you'll probably be a taxi / delivery man for much of the game, which is not a bad job but it doesn't pay well and gets old.

Besides those problems, the gameplay is pretty good. Combat is relatively fun, talking to bar patrons is interesting in the beginning, and the game has a lot of charm. One weird thing is that combat-wise your $100,000 ship from the beginning of the game is about equally strong as the $2,000,000 ship you can get near the end because all ships get only one weapon. (Some can equip two weapons, but then each one deals half damage...) The main difference is the number of missiles, but missiles are too expensive to use often and if you're good with the gun you won't need them anyway. Some more differentiation would have helped me feel like I was actually making progress. For instance, if tier-2 ships were restricted to tier-2 (and below) weapons and upgrades, then upgrading your ship would actually matter. As it is, I used the same gun from about the beginning of the game all the way to the end and only ever upgraded my fighter to get more cargo space.

The graphics are poor, but they're good enough and more importantly they're stylish. The music isn't great but it's decent; it was produced by The Kyoto Connection, which releases all their music free for use in all kinds of projects, which is a nice idea. The controls are obnoxious if you don't use a QWERTY keyboard or otherwise don't use the WASD setup, since the game doesn't support key rebinding. I recommend the keyboard + mouse as the most effective control scheme.

The game takes about 10 hours to get through if you don't do any grinding. Overall, it's a fun little game that's worth buying (perhaps on sale, given how short it is) if you like the genre (and aren't hoping to be a trader) but it has some annoyances that prevent it from being great.",1541966662,1542706157,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The simplistic and retro art style may fool you into thinking that this is a primitive game but I found the gameplay surprisingly polished. Probably because they apparently spent 10 years polishing and cutting things that didn't add to the experience. There's a lighthearted cliche story to keep things going and motivate you to get out and explore, but instead of just forcing you into impossible situations that can only be solved with grinding, this game actually helps you along quite nicely. Trading upgrades/weapons etc is done in a way that rewards experimentation rather than punishing it: The price is the same for buying and selling. Very simple, very effective. The result is a game where you have the freedom to just jump in, play it your own way, take your time or rush towards the end of the story. Some will probably find the game too easy, for me it was just perfect but then again maybe I just got lucky... I went with an all-round ship with an ion cannon, hard to aim but capable of one-shotting the weaker enemies. There are LOTS of other ship types and weapons to experiment with so you're almost guaranteed to find something that suits you.

Having grown up with computer games in the mid-80s, the soundtrack alone was worth the price TBH. A brilliant choice by the devs.

Finally, I strongly recommend reading the player made guide over at the Community Hub. The in-game ""radar"" can be tricky to make out at first but becomes super useful once you know how to read it.

Felt like a ""Secret of Monkey Island"" in space, complete with chapter screens, bars full of interesting characters, and a villain who was funny and enjoyable but overall competent.

Gameplay is very straight forward. Fly your ships to stations to resupply or purchase tradeable goods, wrecks for a side scrolling looting minigame or engage some dastardly space pirates in combat with missiles and energy weapons.

I very much enjoyed one on one space combat as it felt fast and I found it very rewarding when I had purchased a combat oriented ship and it made short work of enemies, however despite the game including NPC's that invite the characters to space raids or stations being equipped with turrets, group battles are a MESS as a good portion of your shots will miss your intended target and if too many hit a police ship or station, they will ALL turn against you so I now avoid any fight with friendly ships entirely.

While on the subject stations are also some of the best and worst parts of the game. They primarily serve as your mission vendors and resupply areas along with complement of random NPC’s you can talk to or acquire additional missions from. These bars also however serve as the only form of plot progression in the game outside of scripted battle which (as far as I have seen) always take place outside the station, unfortunately this led to me docking at the stations without ever realizing I was under attack causing the game to claim the enemy was dead and continuing the story completely without my knowledge or input which can be disorienting.
 
As far the story NPC’s themselves, they are quite enjoyable with quirky looks and dialogue and felt like a nice compliment to the retro futuristic vibe the game gives. Although these characters cause my biggest problem with the story, that being it is very threadbare and spread thin in my experiences, leaving me invested more in the world itself rather than my main character and his supporting cast.

As my final point if you are looking for a game where you can drift through space with great music, then this will scratch that itch as the music chosen for the soundtrack is fantastic for the setting and really add to the experience.

I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style of point and click adventures but the gameplay of space combat and trading games.",1541515927,1576041643,True,2,0,0.500509679317474365,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game obviously had a lot of effort and love put into it, especially for being 10 years into development. I heard the name in passing, but I finally got a chance to play--the verdict is not disappointing. 

I LOVE this game. I am in my thirties, and this game is a becking to those raised in good old fashioned game styles--but pumped up kicks. It has the nostalgia, humor, graphics, sfx. But what those old games don't have is a finely mastered late 80s synthwave soundtrack! The music is incredible. 

The story is meh, but it's mostly about letting you do your thing while this ""meh story"" unravels. It works well. 

However, if I had to give it my own score system, it'd be closer to 8/10 in overall gameplay. I heard there was a lot of content, but it seems like you are limited in jobs. There is some meta jokes and meta references to the team itself behind the game, but they aren't well executed for it to be given any extra hype.

I was telling people it was like Wing Commander and Stellar Frontier (old school stardock) had a baby. With some hints of gta2 in space. Stellar Frontier stands out even to today's crowd. If it weren't so outdated on graphics and sound, it would be a killer game still. SF has population control, colonization, planet destruction, asteroid mining, asteroid launching (as weapons, space station building, faction changing gameplay and I only wish it was like that, but it feels similar. It has its own charm.

I would totally reccomend this game at $15 and would consider it a steal if on sale.

3030 Deathwar Redux has a nice mix of play mechanics including a flight system reminiscent of Asteroids and Star Control, plus some side scrolling environments for derelict ships and space stations. There is a lot of flexibility in play style which includes space combat, mining, trading, bounty hunting, pirating, delivery jobs, taxi service jobs and more. As you play, it steadily unlocks incremental upgrade options, with the cost increasing a little faster than your income growth curve is likely to increase. I believe that eventually you can unlock every performance upgrade for your ship, but that along the way you will focus on the upgrades that have the biggest impact to your chosen playstyle. Every playstyle has a few ship archetypes that should fit your needs, and each ship archetype has about 9 tiers to work your way through; plenty of enjoyable moments where you move on to that new ride. All performance upgrades carry over from ship to ship, which is a nice touch.

Changing playstyles is not an impossibility, although some are easier to adjust to on-the-fly versus others. For instance, most combat craft have minimal cargo capacity, so going from bounty hunting to trading will probably require a ship swap. On the other hand, mining and trading both require cargo capacity so you can easily do either or both with the same ship archetype. I've only played with tiers 1-3 of various ships, so my impressions are heavily based on those. It's clear from examining the higher tier ships that their differences do get a bit more extreme down the line. They do have one archetype called the Allrounder which does a decent job at most playstyles from what I have seen, although I have not fought too heavily with it, as yet.

Having looked through some comments, it looks like there have been a lot of quality of life improvements to the game since it was launched. Everything from a game experience perspective has been pretty smooth since I started. I side stepped the main story early on and have enjoyed the open world nature of the game, although I intend to get back into the story shortly. The humor is great, whether it's the storyline or a random bar conversation.

That pretty much covers my thoughts on the game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",1537282689,1537282689,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is faithful to the genre: the player goes on missions, flies between systems, mines, shoots bogeys, runs out of fuel, and earns cash to buy better equipment and ships. It is, obivously, in the 2D top-down stream of these games. From here, this sounds like many many clones, and not worth getting, but Deathwar stands out in a few big ways.

I think most importantly, this game drips with personality and charm. From the weird people on space stations, to the radio chatter, to the pirate base that looks like a giant head, Deathwar has character. That character is decidedly retro: half the music tracks are 90s pop inspired, the main character wears a leather jacket, and its kinda-sorta pixel art. This is partly why long-time lovers of the genre, who may be of a certain age range, will find some extra nostalgic charm here: the game does not take itself too seriously, and is definitely winking to you about the genre you love.

At the same time, the core gameplay is solid, and the main story line is a good way to keep things moving (my advice: don't rush through it; take your time and build up your credits). Most of the different paths to earning money are viable to an extent, and fun to at least try out. There are some nice twists on the old mission type standbys, like towing cargo between stations, and two very nice additions I havent' seen elsewhere: salvage missions, in which you play a side-view mini-game to guide your character around busted ships looking for survivors and loot; and a space sporting event, where you and many other ships chase a moving goal around a system. This all works, and there is still an immersive element. 

What are the space fligth mechanics like? There's a bit of momentum as you fly your ship around, and turning is slow, but it will automatically come to a stop, and you have a max speed -- so non-Newtonian. Combat is fairly simplistic, with guns, missiles, afterburners, and ECM systems. It's not hard, and a bit samey. The general pacing is a little like the Elite/Frontier games, where you definitely are waiting around for a minute to travel between systems. Unlike Elite, the universe is not infinite or random/procedural: it is hand-made, with around 30 systems to explore. There is some in-game hand-waving about why this is, but I think it works: the systems have some distinctions betweent them, and there's no real need for more.

In the end, this is a charming and fun game. It might not have the longevity of some of the bigger open-ended games, but we'll also have to see what the modders come up with. It's not expensive, so grab it if you like this kind of thing.",1535640614,1535640614,True,4,0,0.551773369312286377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

3030 Deathwar Redux (DWR from now) is an open-wold sci-fi space opera title in which you will impersonate John Falcon, a spaceship salvage expert, and undertake over the top adventures featuring extravagant characters to help him get back to his former glory.

The center of all your activities will be the space station, there is at least one in each of the numerous systems on the map. Here, you can access a Trade Terminal, enabling you to trade goods you found, buy weapons and upgrades for your current ship, access the ship catalog to get a new ride, make repairs, and even buy amenities such as magazines you can actually read. Then you also have the Job Terminal, where all the available quests in that station are listed, divided in various types, such as assassination, transport, taxi, space garbage cleanup, container towing, and many more. Each space station also features a Lounge, where you can talk to unique NPCs, some there just to banter, while some others will become contacts and start secondary quests, or trade unique items.

Once left any station, the vastness of space will be open to you. DWR features a realtime map, where all systems and places are in the same chunk, without any loading times except to enter stations or space derelicts. Distances between things are often huge, that's why most ships are equipped with a warp drive that consumes more fuel when used, but is also essential in traveling between sectors. Dangers will be routine, as nebulas, space anomalies, stars and pirate ambushes will just be some of the dangers you will encounter while warp traveling. The interface to navigate all this and get an idea of where you need to go is decent enough, so you will unlikely get lost or stuck.

Aside from questing and jobs, there are also several careers you can engage, such as miner, trader, bounty hunter... there will be specific ships to better suit the needs of each career, but this doesn't mean a miner can't fight, or a bounty hunter can't mine. Player freedom is absolute in DWR. There are no skill trees or anything like that, only your ship, the equipment and your piloting skills will be what makes a difference. Of course, you can also become an outlaw pirate and kill everyone in sight if you wish to do so.

All of this sounds really awesome, and it is, in part, but what I really found DWR lacking about, is game pacing. The game and its contents themselves are not bad at all, but the general pace of quests, combat, dialogues, felt a bit too slow and clunky, and this partially limited enjoying what otherwise has been an all around solid title.

[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]


[b] General Gameplay [/b]
Generally, the gameplay of DWR will be divided into Exploration, Dialogues and Combat. Exploration is performed on a persistent realtime galaxy map, is completely free roaming from the start, and features all sorts of unexpected discoveries and encounters around the various sectors. An interface around your ship will advise about what kind of objects are close to you, while the zoomable realtime map is useful for knowing what is where.

Dialogues with station NPCs are surprisingly varied, featuring a good amount of content, and many tales to listen to, some with even some useful information in them. There are no RPG-like choices or checks to pass, as NPCs will simply tell you what you ask them, without any specific requirement in most cases, unless quest related. 

DWR also features a minigame of sorts: when boarding a derelict ship the game becomes a side-scrolling shooter, and you will control our fellow adventurer, wrecking abandoned ships apart to loot what may be left inside.

Overall I found the gameplay of DWR to be pleasant as many other space-opera games, the only disappointment being the pacing of it, which was a bit too clunky and slow.

[b] Story [/b]
The story will not be very elaborate, but not minimal either. There is a decent amount of content to it, and characters you encounter have good personalities and realization. Side quests and just station banter add a lot to the lore content of the game.


[b] Combat System [/b]
Combat is simple enough, but hard to master. WASD to move your ship around, and space to fire: dodging bullets while also hitting the enemy is paramount, while also dealing with inertia, ship module damage, and eventual missiles or enemy turrets. Personally, I found the control system for combat to be not very good, as it is very hard to hit enemies, while foes, being computer controlled, have a marked advantage in accuracy. This said, combat is certainly passable, but not the best.


[b] Content & Pricing [/b]
Depending on your play-style, money farming methods, and just how much you want to explore, this game can last between 12-15 to 20-25 hours. For a base price of 14.99€, i'd say it's worth the money if you are a fan of sci-fi adventures and space opera games, while for everyone else, you can aswell wait for a sale.


[b] Balancing & Challenge [/b]
Some weapons and ships are quite unbalanced, a shining example being the Ion Cannon, the most ridiculous weapon in the game, delivering insane damage at a relatively affordable price. Combine it with an auto-aim turret, and you have the perfect recipe for death. Overall the balance is not bad at all, delivering challenge and engagement steadily enough. Challenge rating is Medium.



[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]


[b] Graphics [/b]
Well done pixel art, purposefully low-res graphics, give out a unique style exuding originality from every pore. Good effects, and a lot of little details that summed up, make a big positive difference in quality.


[b] Sound [/b]
Exceptional soundtrack, with some of the tracks sticking in your head for days on end. Decent sound effects.


[b] Performance & Stability [/b]
Nothing to report.


[b] AI [/b]
Enemy AI will use attack patterns relative to their equipment and ship type, expect different styles of enemies as you progress.


[b] Quality of Life [/b]
Interface and menus do the job alright, without any major issue. 


[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]
Nothing major to report, the game is polished good and proper after many updates.



[h1] Conclusion & Rating [/h1]
Deathwar Redux is definitely an original space-opera adventure that will be the joy of any fan of this type of game, and also for anyone looking for an adventure different from the regular ones you are used to. While far from being perfect, its charming style and varied situations made me develop a strange love-hate relationship with this game, one that in the end, didn't leave any bitter taste.

Seriously. 

I do not often leave reviews, especially positive ones, but this game absolutely deserves it. I have a sort of never ending lust for quality space RPG's where the player is more than a ship and a player portrait. Finding a quality space RPG where one can get out of the ship and stretch your legs is very cool. It is especially rare to find a space game where the universe and general atmosphere feel strange. Every game just feels ""futuristic"", but we have all seen dozens of games and movies that take place in the future. There's no sense of adventure in those games for me, but this game really gives you a sense of being a bit of an alien yourself. It's strange and unfamiliar. You've got to figure it out. 

The artwork and music are absolutely wonderful. Soundtrack especially is a true joy and for once in my life, I have been able to mine asteroids in a space RPG! The music and general feeling keep me entertained well enough to, when I want to eat some food and play this beautiful game, I can just do some mining and relax. No other game has ever been able to get me to go near a mining laser.

Story so far is pretty interesting and I am enjoying it. I am also greatly enjoying the side quests, especially the bounty hunter ones, though I do wish that they were more plentiful. Still, hunting pirates down in their ""last seen"" sector is fun, too. While the combat isn't the greatest, I don't find it particularly lacking and I am content with it. 

The station designs inside and outside are almost all excellent, creative and awe inspiring. This game is almost like Morrowind in space. It gives me that sense of mystery and adventure that no game really has since Morrowind. For me, that is something almost sacred. 

I cannot recommend this game enough and I wish nothing but great things for those that have worked on it. If any of my friends express interest but don't want to pay the more than fair purchase price, I will totally buy it for them. I just fucking love this game so, so much.

I played it hoping for Escape Velocity, but I got something slightly different. It's good through the whole progression, even if the game is shorter than I was hoping.

Pros:
+The game has a great feel to the space movement very similar to EV games, where velocity in a single direction continues, even if you turn your ship.
+Space exploration is amazing. Traveling between galaxies is thrilling at times, and always at least makes you think.
+Simple controls and mechanics, that still leave a lot of room for learning how to better play the game. I felt like I was learning how to fly, traverse, fight better every hour or so as I learned something new.
+I do like the ship variation as how they affect gameplay and what you're able to do.
+The missions are actually pretty fun, even though they're repetetive. I found myself taking 3-4 missions at a time and balancing taxi missions, delivering missions, scouting missions and pickup missions to try to maximize profits, before switching to mining and pirate hunting. I have never done that in a game (each money making source) as usually one of them isn't as good, but really, you can do whatever you want. Mining is restrictive early though, because of cargo space.
+The game has mods, though there aren't really any right now. Hopefully someone finds a way to make a story mod, or throw in some factions, or anything to spice up the universe. This is a future hopeful Pro.
+Although simple, getting out of your ship and entering space stations, or looting derelicts or landing on planets (story only) is a nice change of pace from EV's HUD/text only space stations.
+Through the 20 hours I put in, I never felt bored, and always had a story mission or money to make for the next ship or the next upgrade. I enjoyed the money making as much as the rest, so it felt like time well spent.
+The game supports crazy wide screens like my 3440x1440 resolution with no problem. It looks really nice. It plays smooth and space never looked more exciting.

Cons:
-The game does not have the replayability of the EV games. It reminds me more of Rebel Galaxy, in that you have a few options outside of the story like trading, mining, pirating, etc, but no real reason to do it outside of monetary gains, of which there's little point.
-The ship customization system is basic. You buy upgrades, of which there is no weight limits, and no difference between ships except for turret/gun placement and missile number. Everything else you just buy the best and you are done.
-The combat is too easy. Once you get a ship with a turret, it's game over if you keep your ECM finger ready and boost whenever you're about to get in someone's fire. I went without taking even a hit to my shields dozens of times against many foes.
-Ships, even though varied and feel different, follow a progression path that is too simplistic. There isn't a reason to have a good fighter or a massive cargo ship. Once you get the fast/300 ton cargo/turret/14missile ship, there's no reason to change. More missiles aren't that helpful, few ships are faster, but sacrifice a ton of cargo or the turret (that's a no go). I saved for the best ships but they weren't as good as that ship. I didn't find a ""favorite"" ship as much as I just found the  one that did everything. There was never a time when I felt like ""Oh I love this ship"" and I will use it even when I shouldn't. I just moved up constantly.
-Locations are generic most of the time and there doesn't feel like there's a difference between anywhere. Every single place is super multiracial, so there's no stations specifically for aliens, or humans, so everything seems randomized. There's no factions that are noticeable, beyond ""Colonial"". 

Overall: I definitely enjoyed the game, and unfairly compare it to EV games. While it is similar and plays much like it, the EV games are much grander in scope, customization and story, while this sacrifices that for much, much better space flight and exploration. I've never played a game where flying through space, literally nothing, was exciting.

I enjoyed the fact that there is an over-arcing story to begin with that unfolds as you go. And I liked the flow and the general feeling I got from playing - that I was pulled in and part of what happened and that made me care. My definitiion of a good game is one that makes me care, at least to some degree.

Cons of the game were that I ran into some glitches occasionally, particularly with the derelict searches, but nothing that stopped me from enjoying the game. Another challenge is not being able to save while on missions and there are a few points where that could require being extra careful. Again, not a show stopper.

My bottom line is that if this type of game is your cup of tea, then take a sip. In fact, drink deep and gulp it down. It will quench your thirst more than adequately. I still have the final mission to finish in the game but I definitely recommend it - at least give it a try.

This game turned out to be much the same as far as fun factor, but with added bonuses of landing on stations and mining, neither of which were in the game so many years ago. The story is engaging, and has some spots that really had me chuckling at the cut-scenes. Humor is a big bonus, in my opinion!

The ship selection is outstanding, with so many different builds for different playstyles. Also there's a very gradual curve as far as prices, so you can keep upgrading quite regularly, without grinding for long periods of time to make a bunch of cash. Trade-in value is very generous, so you don't lose a lot when upgrading to different ships.

At its core, it is a top-down arcade space shooter where you complete missions to gain money and upgrade your ships. The combat is serviceable, but thankfully the game doesn't force you into a fighting role to advance the story. In fact, most of the missions are either delivery or taxi contracts, It is also quite possible to make money by mining asteroids, or salvaging lost ships. However, salvaging is a strange ""platforming"" mini-game which I found less enjoyable than the other activities.

The space travel and exploration between system is honestly quite clever, although it is also confusing at the beginning when you don't know how to use the star map. For example, nebulas are hazards that any new player will want to avoid at all cost, but a well-equipped ship can technically power through them (albeit slowly).  Since some contracts are on a timer, finding shortcuts in nebulas between two systems can be incredibly satisfying. Furthermore, fuel management will force you to think of optimal flight plans around the map.

Most of the time, you will find yourself travelling between space stations in different systems. While there are activities to do along the way, what makes this experience truly enjoyable is the superb choice of music for the soundtrack. It is a perfect fit that enhances the ambience significantly.  

The adventure part of the game is found mainly in discussions with the characters you find in space stations around the universe. The main story and characters are all a bit silly, but in a good way. The game is filled with subtle, and not so subtle, references to science fiction and pop culture. More importantly, the characters found in stations make the universe feel alive in a way very few games manage to do. That, in itself, may be the greatest achievement of this game. It also helps that Falcon and its detective robot are funny/adorable characters. 

In a strange way, the graphics style of Deathwar reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 2. Indeed, the game would not look out of place in 1998. This older style of graphics creates a nostalgic feeling which is well-suited to this genre of game. With that said, the UI can be incredibly clunky (e.g., all the wasted space in station consoles) and the low resolution will certainly be a deterrent to some players. 

It is clear that ""3030 Deathwar Redux - A Space Odyssey"" is a labour of love by a tiny, dedicated development team. The game may be sharp around the edges, and a bit slow at the beginning, but it is quite enjoyable once you get the hang of it. It is a bit expensive for what it is though, so I would suggest to buy it on sale. 

Overall, I recommend it to anyone willing to experience a surprisingly ambitious little arcade space shooter, sprinkled with a healthy dose of humour and an over-the-top story set in a strangely believable universe.

You have to read all of the dialogue and its very funny stuff. So I do enjoy that part of the game. Its just those really ugly menus. I wish they were bigger because again they only take up about 30% of the screen. 

Outside in space is wonderful. Its bright, it takes up the full screen, its easy to navigate. Its fun. Navigation is easy enough if a bit cumbersome.

thanks for your feedback. You are correct about the lack of variety in station layouts but the mechanic is intentionally simple with new mission types getting unlocked with story progression and experience, as well as new ships and upgrades allowing new activities like hunting pirates and taking part in space races.

With continued community support we are adding more content and have recently added modding that can help address this as well. Currently we are not getting much exposure so reviews are very valuable for us to help promote the game, hopefully if more content is added it will tip the balance of your review to positive. Thanks again for your feedback, please let us know any more details or what should be our top priorities to improve in our Feature Requests forums.

Cheers,
Max, Matt and Mike"

""3030 Deathwar Redux - A Space Odyssey"" strongly resembles a freeware game released in the 90's by Ambrosia Software: ""Escape Velocity.""  This new title builds on Ambrosia's concept with a passion, expanding gameplay while adding lots of modern production value.

The soundtrack is phenomenal, every track an earworm.  Best music in a game since Hotline Miami.  Perfectly composed and tailor made for an interstellar-faring game.

The writing is literate and clever, without trying to take over the experience.  Dialogue and narration are easy skim for game objectives and click through, but also quite creative and thoughtful at times.  As a technical writer, I'm pleased to see such masterful execution.  Like the music, this element of the game takes a passenger seat, to better help you navigate the real experience, which is...

...casting around the universe's milky nebulae.  Running out of fuel between solar systems and making it to the next station running on fumes.  Ending up on the wrong side of the celestial tracks, and slinking away from predatory pirate ships.  All these great experiences of the imagination I got to have as a kid, done up for a new generation.

Very good for an indie game and well worth the pricetag, but if its on sale you shoud deffinetly get it. The game is charming and immensly atmospheric. If you like games such as Freelancer and similar space games you'll enjoy this. The game is very ""on the nose"" and not very serious which was fun. The soundtrack is unique and might not hit it off with everyone but its very configurable and you can turn off vocal tracks if you like, but personally I liked it a lot. I was dissapointed that trading and mining is useless however. No reason to get a cargo ship really since missions pay much more than even a perfect trade of full cargo for cheap and selling high. The game is not combat based (at least as far as I have gotten), but it does have combat and its pretty good and intense if you partake in it. Basically to summarize the game, its a top down space game in the vein of Freelancer. The game doesnt have a HUGE amount of depth to it, but its good. Atmosphere might remind you of Cowboy Bebop and especially Space Dandy (I even saw a commercial ship with a Space Dandy commercial on it)

Pros:
- interesting Lucas Arts adventure style graphics in stations
- unique soundtrack (some might not like it but you can configure it)
- fun combat
- cool ships (what else do you need?)
- lots of star systems for an indie game
- atmospheric
- Rich Evans is in it as an NPC

Cons:
- trading and mining is useless (this is such a common problem for these games that its not even surprising anymore)
- not very deep
- story is hard to follow and sometimes nonsensical
- salvaging minigame is a cool addition but ultimately useless and unrewarding

Pros:
Great soundtrack. Really loved the jams while flying around. Did not expect that at all.
Do you like Privateer as much as I do?  You'll love the open world/open mission concepts at play here.  Do taxi runs, courier packages, or kick back and relax with some mining.  Kit out a fighter ship and go bounty hunting.  Track down hulking shipwrecks and loot them for profit.  Piracy is an option.  Lots of ways to make money and it encourages exploration while also catering to many play styles.
Related to play styles, there's tons of ships and so you can easily go from a missile-toting fighter, to a commercial passenger ship, to huge transport ship with upgrade paths to support all styles.
Big galaxy to explore.
I dig the 16-bit era Lucasarts aesthetic they went for.  It's a bit more modern in the flight segments.

Cons:
I wish there was a bit more meat on the ""adventure game"" portions of the game.  Mostly all you do is visit the trade and job terminals with the occasional dialogue tree for Plot Important NPCs.  Would've been nice to see some unique puzzles i.e. the one during the last mission which I won't spoil here.
While the galaxy is big it can get a bit same-y over time.
Can't save while you have active missions but are penalized a little bit for ditching them.
Thats about it - I really don't have any huge complaints.

Misc:
I completed the main story after 13 hours according to Steam - though it's really more like 10.  Because of the mentioned inability to save during missions I actually left the game running for a few hours while I went to the movies.  There is postgame as you might expect, leaving the galaxy available for exploration and continued jobs if you feel like it.

AAA developers have been trying to make the next big hit for the past several years, yet none have been successful. No Man's Sky, overhyped and overestimated, managed to be the greatest disappointment of this gaming generation. Elite: Dangerous, the successor to the legendary game that created the genre, ended up vast and empty, just like space itself. Star Citizen, the most expensive crowdfunded project of all time, is still in development, years past its original deadline with no end in sight. These games have cast a shadow of doubt over the viability of the open-world space genre, and all of these cases seem to be proof to the growing fear that it might just be impossible to make space [i]interesting[/i] in video games.

If you agreed with any of the above, you need to get [i]3030 Deathwar Redux[/i] right now. What makes [i]3030 Deathwar Redux[/i] truly special is the vibrancy of its open-world: instead of drifting through empty, cold space, you’ll constantly be meeting weird, funny characters in the bars of space stations. Travelling through space will never feel empty when you’re jamming out to retro 80’s synthpop. The plot is nothing particularly incredible or surprising, but the writing is top-notch; with humor taking inspiration from cheesy LucasArts adventure games like Monkey Island. The genius of this game is simply in its charm: the story, characters, and world come together in an amazing package that makes space seem [i]fun[/i].

If you're burnt out on open-world space games, please give this one a shot. It will rejuvenate your love for the genre.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
How hard is it to spread your wings as a successful scavenger in 3030? From where I am sitting, it seems to be quite challenging. Take a look at this fellow who goes by the name of John Falcon. An astute operator who travels the galaxy in search of abandoned spaceships and their cargo. Let me tell you, John is one of the best in the business of retrieving goods from derelicts. With a healthy intergalactic bank account of two million credits, he came across the best deal in the galaxy . . . a stunning vessel with great firepower, speed, and the ability to hold a huge cargo, all for only two million credits (a third of its value)!  After this unbelievable purchase, John kept moving from one derelict to another until his cargo hold was full. Upon docking at the nearest station to refuel his vessel and sell its cargo, he was told by an officer that the deal of the galaxy was, in fact, a stolen ship and has to be impounded. Here you go John, take these 1500 credits, a crappy two seater vessel and this package to be delivered to the next solar system! Welcome to 3030 Dearthwar Redux – A Space Odyssey!   

3030 Deathwear Redux – A Space Odyssey is a sci-fi action /adventure game where you take control of John Falcon, who sold a stolen ship and has to restart his wealth from scratch. The question is, which way will he choose to get there?

At the station where his new vessel was seized, John will become aware of the disappearance of a large ship named the Largo, which was carrying an extremely valuable cargo. He will also learn of the restriction imposed upon all scavengers by a local pirate lord, to not attempt to retrieve the Largo’s cargo, or face certain death! 

It’s a bit much for John to absorb all of this at once, but nonetheless he wants to get back on his feet as soon as possible. At each of the stations, he will be able to pick up work through the job station (delivering parcels, taking down pirates, taking pictures of an unknown planet and others). All of these jobs will earn him credits if he successfully completes them. Bear in mind that some of these jobs will have a time limit attached to them and the countdown will start as soon as he accepts them. The other point is that you can only have four active jobs at any given time. By using the trade console, John will be able to buy or sell goods (prices of goods vary in each station), buy new ships if he has enough dough, upgrade or repair his vessel, and also refuelling it. Or he can just head up to the bar and chat with other characters! 

When he is done at the station, he’ll be able to explore the current solar system, or he’ll be on his way to complete a job. Every time he discovers a solar system, John will be able to open the system map and identify the position of the stations, as well as the location of abandoned ships. The derelict will be represented by a purple dot before he goes through it, and will turn green after visiting it. The moving green dots are friendly vessels (freighters, traders etc.) and the red ones are pirates. Most of his first jobs will be within the first solar system, but soon after they will spread into unknown systems. Not to worry, a green arrow will show him where to go within the galaxy map.  Beware of the nebulas and its storms, which can heavily damage his vessel when passing through them. He can become aware of the storms within nebulas if he discovers discs containing storm data, which are usually found on derelicts.

As soon as John’s vessel hovers over an abandoned vessel, he will automatically be in his space suit and start to explore the ship. With the help of a scanner, John will be able to locate possible survivors (receiving a big reward), R.I.P members (receiving a small reward), valuable goods (adding credit to your bank account), junk (waste of space) and crates (good to sell at stations). He will encounter some strange alien lifeforms but they are really easy to kill. 

Pirates are another kettle of fish; John needs to defeat small pirates first in order to get a shot at the big ones. He’ll need a ship with a large arsenal to increase his chance of winning these fights.

Great Pixel art accompanied by a superb soundtrack. In terms of controls, you can either use the keyboard and mouse, keyboard only or play with your gamepad. This game has plenty of content and offers plenty of re-playability. The only things that took me a bit of time to get use to is the interface, and it can be repetitive too. Apart from that, it’s a pretty cool game!

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

+	Good Pixel artwork
+	30 Solar systems to discover
+	Stacks of jobs to do
+	Fabulous soundtrack
+	Fun characters and story
+	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	A bit repetitive
-	No trading cards as yet

Looking for the final frontier adventure? 3030 Deathwar Redux - A Space Odyssey would be that one!

we're sorry you are disappointed. It clearly says in our system requirements that only XBox-type controllers are supported, but it's understandable that can easily be missed.

Just so you know, Steam has a clear guideline on when a game must be marked as 'Full Controller Support': ""Must work entirely with an Xbox or similar controller from installation to play and beyond.""

In closing, the game plays very well with Keyboard and Mouse as well. We hope you give the game another shot :)

thanks for your feedback. You're right that combat is initially difficult, as pirates are well equipped and you don't have the upgrades necessary to be a super effective fighter at the beginning of the game. Our goal was to give players a feeling of progress, so that you would initially have some trouble fighting one or two enemies, but would be able to take on a full squadron later. This approach probably isn't optimal for everyone, but we prefer this design to a ""scaling"" system where enemies become stronger as you do.

We also understand that combat might feel a bit shallow by itself, so we tried to add other space activities, such as asteroid mining, space races, crew rescue and refueling your ship from a star's corona. With continued community support, we plan on adding even more activities and to expand the 3030 universe. Currently we are not getting much exposure so reviews are very valuable for us to help promote the game, hopefully if more content is added it will tip the balance of your review to positive. Thanks again for your feedback, and please let us know any more thoughts or what you think we could do to improve the game in our Feature Requests forums.

Cheers,
Max, Matt and Mike"

Do you like cheesy writing and playing as a futuristic Indiana Jones?
Then this game is for you. It's basically a 2D Freelancer-lite. 
Moreover, it is the most fleshed out top-down Elite-like game that I've played.

[b]Positives[/b]
+ open-universe
+ story with good character and cheesy writing
+ different career options (trading, mining, combat, scavenging or delivery)
+ different flyable ships
+ different weapons and upgrades
+ good soundtrack (personal taste)
+ neon-80's aesthetics (personal taste)
+ side events and other efforts to make the universe seem more alive

[b]Negatives[/b]
- despite the variety in career options the individual missions tend to become repetitive which makes the game prone to open-world fatigue syndrome
- the game is not hard; therefore the sense of accomplishment becomes smaller compared to something more challenging
- basic loot/rewards
- basic character animations
- minor bugs

Long review below.

[h1]Premise[/h1]
I sunk many hours in the original 3030 Deathwar before development on Redux started. The game has you playing as John Falcon, an Indiana Jones/Han Solo-inspired space pilot who got himself stranded without a ship by dealing with the wrong people. You need to take some jobs and make money to get a new ship and find the guy who double crossed you. But that changes when a bounty is placed on your head for a crime you didn't commit.

[h1]Genre and gameplay[/h1]
3030 Deathwar is a 2D top-down Elite-like game: an open sandbox universe with almost 40 different star systems where the player is free in the way he makes money. You can make money through trading, bounty-hunting, scavenging, mining, package delivery, taxi jobs, and reconnaissance. Or you can be a pirate and blow ships up to get their cargo. Early on when you're low on cash you can do some delivery and taxi jobs to upgrade to a better ship. Scavenging derelicts is a nice option that's been added in Redux. Bounty hunting can be hard depending on your bounty. Though after upgrading my ship's guns, the combat didn't pose much of a threat. Mining can be pretty profitable if you've upgraded your ship to scan an asteroid's contents. I've never dipped into reconnaissance or trading. The latter being because I can't bother remembering or writing down the value of goods in every system to determine what is a viable trade route. The game tries to help you by indicating which wares are expensive or cheap to buy at the station you're in. While the career options are diverse, the gameplay itself is not deep. For me, this made it easier to get bored with the game and put it down for a while. Maybe it was open-world fatigue. After a while all delivery missions look the same, all mining expeditions look the same, all scavenging expeditions look the same etc. 
Which brings me to the part where this game needs attention. The reward system is one area where I see room for improvement. Sure, giving cash for completed missions is fine. But what if there were mission-givers that offer you either cash OR offer a certain ship upgrade (maybe at a reduced price) where you can choose your reward? This gives the player more choice and varies the reward system. The derelicts. They're pretty interesting and you can get some valuable stuff from them, but at the same time the risk of going into one is not high which makes repeatedly looting derelicts eventually become boring even if the loot is high value. I've never encountered huge dangers when going into them. Only some simple critters that attack and can be easily killed.
I think this game can take some valuable pointers from Freelancer. Freelancer had these derelict ships in high-risk areas, which contain high-class loot, like experimental weapons or some extremely valuable cargo. If this game had something like that where there were these small derelict ships in some areas where there was a lot of environmental hazard, then it would make looting them not only lucrative but also exciting. But it must come at a high risk and real danger to your survival, otherwise it will feel like the game is just showering you with overpowered weapons for very little effort on your side. Who knows what that derelict C590 holds? Maybe new weapons for my ship? Proceed to fly into that patch of nebula that constantly damages your ship systems, find the derelict ship, shoot it, recover the items and split out with just enough health left that you can fly to safe port and equip/sell the loot. This makes the exploration more fun as well. 
It all comes down to a balanced risk-reward system and right now the risks are too low and the rewards do not feel very lucrative in my opinion. This leads to the looting feeling repetitive, where even finding a stash of valuable ore won't feel like you've achieved something special. The game's universe is big enough to warrant deeper, more fun mechanics but they're just not there right now which can make the gameplay feel a bit shallow beyond the early-game adventuring. 
The game lets you decide how you play and progress. You can stick to doing the main storyline, which will inevitably have you take on different side missions to prepare you for the next part. Alternatively, you can ignore the storyline completely and roam free as long as you want. There are many different ships, weapons and upgrades. Some ships are geared toward combat, some are more geared toward passenger transport while other ships are suited for trading. The ships have different speeds (both for regular and split/fast travel), turn rates, cargo space, passenger cabins, weapon mounts, turret mounts and missile mounts.

[h1]Music[/h1]
The original game's music has an ambient space-y style that blends in excellent with the game. With the Redux version, the developer added in music from The Kyoto Connection. It is electronic music that has cues taken from 80's pop music with distinct Japanese influences and actually fits very nicely in the overall atmosphere of the game. Good choice from the developer and props to the artists on the music. You can download the music for free from The Kyoto Connection's homepage. There's an option to keep the original 3030 Deathwar's music for those who prefer that. 

[h1]Miscellaneous stuff[/h1]
There's lots of attention to detail in this game. There are little side events you can encounter like Moneyball in which you can participate for a quick buck. There are trade ships that pass by and ask whether you're interested in buying their wares. There's interesting information on certain datadisks in the game which you can buy on stations: some give you tips on how to be a good miner, some are purely there for world-building purposes. There are little details like kicking people on space stations. You can buy a drink at the bars. There's an Easter egg where you can find the game's developers on a station. You can do the Kessel Run.

特色：
像素點陣風格畫面。開放宇宙。

優點：
俯瞰視角的飛船操控頁面，適合不善於立體飛行遊戲的玩家。
有趣的故事劇情，時常看反派的3個外星人聊天吐槽覺得好笑。

音樂很有電子龐克風格。

缺點：
任務面板的描述太冗長，關鍵人物和地點沒有高亮標識，尋找會花費點時間。
初期任務就很容易遇上突然襲擊的海盜。雖然可以通過直接停靠太空站來躲過攻擊。
承上，也因此跑商載客也必須有相應的戰鬥能力。
在飛行模式下操控某些界面時點擊鼠標進行選項的同時也會發射武器，不確定是不是bug。

Ich bin seit langem Elite Dangerous spieler und war auch riesiger Fan von Freelancer und erst recht von Retro 2D Games.
Das Spiel viel mir erst vor einem Tag durch Zufall in die Hände und ich musste es sofort ausprobieren einfach der Neugier halber. 
Erstes Fazit: es macht mega laune. Man findet hier so viele Elemtente aus anderen Spielen wieder, das man sich sehr leicht zurecht finde. Die Entwickler haben für diese Game nur ein minimales Budget zur Verfügung gehabt, daher darf mein keinen Tripple A Titel erwarten. ABER, das was sie da auf die Beine gestellt haben ist es zum Sale, wie auch zum vollen Preis absolut wert. 
Das Spiel selbst ist noch recht jung, deshalb ist es auch nochauf Englisch, doch man darf hoffen das auch anderen Sprachen eingeführt werden und vielelicht sogar noch ein Multiplayer nach dem Vorbild von Elite Dangerous. 
Wie gesagt, es ist 2D, daher bitte nicht zuviel erwarten was das angeht, aber es hat selbst nach meiner sehr kurzen Anspielzeit, totalen Suchtfaktor. 
Die Musik im Hintergrund ist absolut cool, und sie verweisen auch auf die Youtube Streamer, diese zur Not auszuschalten, was ich sonst noch in keinem Spiel gesehen habe. 
Sie antworten über FB super schnell, und am besten finde ich die perfekte integration des Xbox 360 und XboxOne Kontrollers. Da muss man nix mehr umstellen, den das macht das Spiel von ganz allein.

I would give this game an 8/10

Open world, freedom to go wherever if you plan ahead, controller support (7/10 but it's there and works for 90% of things). There are some things the controller can't do, like take pictures or drop a buoy. You will also need to be close to the screen because there are some things like navigating that are very difficult if you aren't up close to see the detail on the small on-screen map.
The worst thing about it is that there isn't anything else to do once you finish the story. You can still do missions and hunt pirates but once you have a pretty decent ship and figure out the ""trick"" to combat, you don't need anything else. 

Combat is kind of easy if your ship turns moderately quickly. I found missiles to be completely unnecessary and way overpriced so I just used guns. I frequently attack the Moneyball group and have no trouble killing all of them in less than a minute. That's the biggest challenge I could find and it's pretty easy. Every pilot seems to have the same skill level: LOW. 

There are occasional minor glitches but only one I had to load my game to fix. A station I HAD to go to was invisible except for its gun and I couldn't contact it to board.

Biggest complaints:
Story too short.
Combat too easy.
Controller support is pretty sketchy (the stick moves the mouse cursor when you aren't in combat) and could be improved.
Missions too similar.

The first time i played the game i had no clue what i was doing not gonna lie, and after a few hours i just gave up.

But i recently got back into it and tried 2 ways of playing the game 

1. Abandoning the Campaign
2. Concentrating on the Campaign

-------------------------------------------

This is my experience 
(NOTE: This is only my experience, Apollogies if i drifted of somewhere within the review)

-------------------------------------------

1. Abandoning  the Campaign
Your Free.
You do what you want, how you want to and when you want to do it. 

First thing i did was build up to 100k and buy a ship with decent cargo space. 
(Doing multiple deliveries/ taxi lifts from one station to the next. MORE income LESS TRAVEL)

Afterwards i salvaged DERILECT ships (White Dots)
(CAUTION: There is a chance that you will encouter delerict pirates, THEY WILL TRY TO KILL YOU).
This is a great way to MAKE MONEY and the UNLOCK NEBULA MAP.
Whilst salvaging i also mined for the most expensive products in that system.

In to time i had 300-400K+ which i used to buy the next best cargo ship worth 300k.
With the new ship i had 110t of space and Turrets which made defending against pirates which was a piece of piss.

After that i concentrated on killing pirates and doing bounty jobs where i got 20-60k per Head. You also get to sell the PIRATES bodies which cost around 7k + the cargo they drop. 

At this point i had around 2m worth of upgrades on my ship with which i went to ""PLAY"" some MoneyBall. There are 6+ pirates playing moneyball at all times with bounties 2-60k+ Per Head. After i got around 800k i bought a ship for 1m+.

OH MY GOD 
I felt like a king, dashin around the vast dark space, sizzling pirates, crumbling asteroids, dominating the different systems.

>>>>>
I enjoyed this style of play alot more because it didnt feel like i was restricted to taking a certain path and i could switch to the different jobs quickly and effeiciently.

-------------------------------------------

2.Concentrating on the Campaign 
Your locked down. 
You do what your told to, you go where they tell you. 

I WILL NOT BE EXPLAINING EVERYTHING IN DETAIL AS I DID BEFORE.
==NO SPOILERS==

>>>>>
The story was wonderfull and some of the plot twist are amazing, you always have a good laugh, especially from the stupidity of some characters. 

It felt kind of pushy as you were always told what to do and at some points especially towards the end of the campaign it felt like the NPC's were uselses as you never got help in battles or recieved  enough funds for the jobs you did.
You do get given a ship at one point and recieve 1.5m compensation after you finish the campaign.


=====================================OVERALL========================
It really is an amazing Space sim, the retro feel and the music drags you inside and makes you feel like one within the game. Hours will fly past when you get into it.

And £10.99 is a BARGAIN 

9/10 

Although i wish there was something else in the game like Larger bounties for pirates, Maybe even a Bounty Show where you could go on bounty hunts and look for different people.

But i feel like this would only work if you were able to land on all of the planets as this would largly increse the exploration and the NPC's in the game which would make it perfect to be a Bountie Hunter.


Im very satisfied with the game what the developers have done with it.

Now as far as the negative aspects go, to be honest, I couldn't find any, other than some minor annoyances.

Needs a lot of polish; controls are sometimes awkward and UI needs polish, for example when you bring up your mission list, there's a ""show me where"" button, but this only highlights the system that the destination is in. You need to then click on that system to zoom into it, so that you can then click on your destination to set it as a waypoint. They really could have had a ""add destination as waypoint"" button straight from the mission screen. Autopilot also seems to be buggy. You're supposed to be able to press Z to turn on autopilot, but if the autopilot drives near a star, the autopilot ""disengages"" and there does not seem to be a way to re-engage the autopilot except to quit the game and relaunch it.

The main mission narrative is enjoyable, but there's way too much filler content. The game would have been better if shorter and more focused. Mining is not particularly fun, shooting garbage is not particularly fun, salvaging derelict ships is not particularly fun, taxying and acting as a courier is not particularly fun. Took me about 10 hours to beat the main game, and then another 5 hours to ""shoot 1000 garbage"", ""completel 50 taxi missions"", and all the other filler achievements. NPCs also felt shallow. You can do ""random chat"" with them, or read their biographies, but there's no incentive to care about any of this. Feels like there was a missed opportunity to have them deliver side quests to you.

There's basically 3 classes of ships in this game: traders, fighters, and all-arounders. When you get to the last boss, you can't switch your ship, so I got kind of screwed there because I had to do a massive boss fight in my trader ship. Took several tries and reloads but I eventually got it. Would have been nice if I could have just switched to a fighter ship for that boss fight though -- everywhere else in the game except for the introductory tutorial, you can switch your ships at will as long as you have the money.

The music was both a pro and a con for this game. There's some really nice track that give it that great 80s vibe. The thing is that they chose songs with lyrics, which means the music is very salient to the player, instead of being a background element. This is not necessarily bad, but because there's not that many different tracks in the game, it becomes very obvious very quickly when they start repeating the same tracks over and over. I think if you're going to use tracks with lyrics, you need to ""use them once"" for a set-piece moment. Take a look at how Saints Row uses the ""I Need a Hero"" or ""Power"" songs, for example.",1513568601,1513568601,True,11,0,0.648947596549987793,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What I like best is that it's a balance of detail and simple play.  A lot of these sorts of games get really overwhelming, but everything was pretty straight forward and enjoyable.  The hardest part (from my perspective) was learning how traveling between space systems work.  Hint: flying into the nebula is really bad :P

My only critique is that the time spent outside of your ship is pretty lame.  It's better than Privateer where all you got was a slightly animated picture and hot-spots to click, but I would enjoy getting to do more exploration of space stations and planets.  Part of the plot is reasons why you can't do this, so I doubt they'll ever take that direction, but ""if it were my game...""  That's probably what I'd do :)

The classic space-trader-shooter process - getting money, upgrading your ship and getting more money with it - is nicely paced, and the combat is simple but engaging.
But that leads to the first problem: there's next to no combat. Going to a ""dangerous"" system means there might be one or two pirates hanging out, that you can avoid by just flying to where you want to go. The developers have tried to counter this by adding a menu option for extra fights, but even on the lowest setting this just means a steady stream of hit squads attacking you faster than you can kill them off, even if you're right outside a station in a safe area.

Like a green onion and cheddar omelet made by a world renown chef while the chef is hungover from a night of binge drinking, yet could still make this dish in their sleep.

Pros:  The soundtrack (while slightly fluffy and vapid at times) is quite catchy and will have you bobbing your head as long as nobody is around to see you and question your masculinity. The songs do borrow heavily from many highly recognizable songs from popular charts which will remain unnamed, but they do a good enough job of establishing themselves to be forgivable.

Tons of nostalgia and references to produce chuckles under your breath and make you feel special for knowing the thing that the game is talking about or depicting. You snowflake you! :p

Easy to grasp fun mechanics and controls.

Sufficient career options and upgrades to explore making the experience feel all that more expansive and inclusive.

Decently entertaining story which does a good job of immersing you in it.

About two hours in, I realized it was going to be pretty monotonous. The game, in essence, is travelling from one mini game to another which can be tedious and annoying, collecting money to upgrade your ship, that can do those mini games better. I find I end up spending a significant amount of game time on facebook waiting for my ship again and again to cross the entire map to get to the next story point inevitably with some variation of the same mini game involved. The mini games include exploring extremely simple, and significantly uninteresting derelict ships (which sounds like it SHOULD be really interesting), hauling junk (literally, in game it's called junk) for NPCs from one part of the map to another for money, providing taxi services for money, and taking pictures of random people who don't have any story impact also for money. I wasn't able to get a refund since I played it just over two hours before trying to return it. I decided I'm just going to finish out the story, not do another unnecessary odd job/mini game within the game, and upgrade the ship and probably won't ever visit this title again. Update: The dialogue and characters are so corny and annoying, I stopped playing and haven't revisited it.

The dogfights are probably the most interesting thing about the game, but that's not saying much. With enough patience, and even with your first ship, you can take down any enemy ship simply by strafing around the enemy and shooting. They'll never be able to hit you with their shots and you can blow up their missles by pressing shift when the missle is in range to be self destructed. That summarizes every dogfight, even if you have 5-10 ships shooting at you - Just strafe, blow up missles, shoot and you win. Simple.

Also, the dialogue is terrible, unwitty, and cliche. Even when the game tries to make fun of itself, it does so in a way that generally isn't humorous for anyone over the age of 10. It makes fun of itself so frequently, I begin to wonder if the developers intentionally put absurd things in the game just to create dialogue that makes fun of it.

I know this sounds harsh, but I just want others to take the huge amount of positive reviews with a grain of salt on this one since I felt pretty disappointed during and after playing through.  The game advertises so many fun and interesting ideas but none have been fleshed out.

Overall, the game is boring, uninteresting, monotonous, and simply, just not a very creative game.

I left the game with the feeling that some parts were a little thin. Nothing serious - the game is good as it is - but there are some aspects/mechanics of the game where I thought: There could have been done a little more with not much effort.

- More ships and more upgrades to them (so you have more time to earn your money for. )
- More variation on weapons. Maybe even multi turrent support? Multi tractor beam? Auto mining plugin?
- The upgrade buying screen ... Why not sorted by type first?
- Option to turn off theese forced dialogues while mining
- Derelicts feel so cool but have not dangers... Hacking the desks? R.I.P.? The squids...? Radiation?
- More mission types and story arcs.
- modding/workshop support

- gfx are a bit dated but add to the charm of the game - don't change/modernize/upgrade it to a ""full hd version""!

I would love to get another enhanced version of the game!",1508695170,1508695170,True,5,1,0.545646846294403076,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Al igual que otros simuladores espaciales de ""mundo abierto"" podremos jugar y seguir nuestro propio camino, seguir la historia principal o alternar entre ambas posibilidades. Y es en la historia principal donde el juego nos trae ciertas reminiscencia a las antiguas aventuras gráficas de LucasArts y similares: nos encontraremos con nuestro personaje principal, que guarda cierto parecido con cierto arqueólogo, teniendo que hablar con multitud de caracteres, tanto en busca de información valiosa para nuestras misiones como para simplemente ampliar el ""lore"" del universo... o para lanzarnos algún que otro guiño friki (el juego está lleno de humor y referencias).

Aunque los sistemas, planetas o estaciones espaciales tienen una ubicación fija, elementos como los campos de asteroides o las naves abandonadas que podemos saquear se crearan de forma dinámica y aleatoria (de forma que el jugador que decida conseguir creditos con la mineria o el ""salvamento"" siempre tenga donde hacerlo). Tampoco faltan piratas, naves desconocidas y ""criaturas"" a los que dar caza si nos decantamos por el combate.

Para los que decidan dedicarse al comercio hay gran cantidad de recursos englobados en una economia dinámica con los que conseguir beneficios (típico sistema de ""en el sector A el titanio se vende muy barato y en el sistema B se compra muy caro), un buen número de naves (desde pequeñas y rápidas naves para el combate, a grandes y lentas naves de transporte, pasando por naves militares) con sus correspondintes mejoras y actualizaciones. Naturalmente tampoco faltaran los típicos trabajos de chico de los paquetes, taxi, etc, con los que hacer dinero rápido.

En definitiva, un gran juego lleno de detalles, humor y muchas horas de juego si te gusta el género... y no esperas gráficos ultraHD 8k, claro.

Procedurally generated missions with several varieties available, a well-written main campaign, a fairly large number of systems to explore, and atmosphere that will appeal to folks who remember the eighties.  

There are many ways to play--I started with ""taxi"" missions within a system, eventually getting enough to run salvage operations on derelicts, then upgrading to a well-rounded ship capable of bounty hunting, then finally strip-mining of asteroid belts.  You need to save your game, unlike most console titles now, but I've found 3030 is fairly forgiving of missteps, I'd have killed me for running out of fuel.  Strongly recommended for sandbox gamers and folks with limited game time.

Pretty good soundtrack, but it begins to get repetitive after ten hours.

A fair number of ship models to choose from but I would have liked more.  The upgrade modules are where 3030 shines; too lazy to get missiles?  Mount a second gun and some maneuvering thrusters.  Love mining?  Get the expensive tractor beam.  Took several hours before I began to see these, but it did not feel like much of a grind.

Some warts and odd design choices--I love the upgrade system but sorting by type or draggable 'modules' would have been more intuitive.  The random name generator gives male names to a lot of female-looking models.  The in-game tutorial is okay but you are expected to figure stuff out for yourself, and some things are just not explained or intuitive, like the ""photo missions.""

[spoiler] 重中之重，谁他娘的做的bgm，买到比本体贵我也愿意买阿阿阿阿阿	[/spoiler]

       先说优点：庞大的故事线（垃圾佬主角买飞船被坑然后莫名被追杀，之后找出答案），地图大，这么多星系让你乱跑，飞船、武器和升级选项多得很还有很多任务让你赚钱，细节也很丰富，比如有一次我靠近恒星被烧死了。。。撞到飞船人家还会无线电骂你什么的233

       缺点：没有中文[spoiler] we need chinese we need chinese we need chinese	[/spoiler]，大量的英文文本看着我脑袋痛，要是不出我估计会变成underrail那种被埋没的好游戏，不是undertail，是underrail。其次，敌人开火ai有点迷，慢速绕圈随便风筝。还有就是这个是07年的游戏的重置版，画质比较渣，比如进空间站的时候那马赛克多的一笔，还有进出飞船残骸的动画也是的。

      看宣传动画这个游戏内容是很丰富的，我才2.9小时，还有很多没有探索的，但我现在了解的就是，主角就是个垃圾佬：靠着在空间站打垃圾发家致富，打烂通辑海盗再拿别人货物卖钱，钻进飞船残骸里捡垃圾，具有很强的图吧精神。[spoiler] 话说主角最后捡垃圾捡累了说不定会专门去空间站杀虫呢	[/spoiler]

From the moment I started zipping around in my little shuttle, learning all the systems and taking passangers and packages from station to station, this game has drawn me in so deeply. Its graphics and banter are quirky in the best of ways and really make for a surprisingly immersive experience. 

The missions vary and you're able to play all the fun roles you've come to expect from space-faring games. Sure, the missions do get a bit repeatative and some pay out much more than others, but the main story is broken up in a way that keeps drawing you in with every snippet you see. 

The game seems to have a lot going on at first, but it's never felt overwhelming to me at all - even without hand-holding. I recommend using keyboard/mouse controls and taking the time to go watch a 2hr+ gameplay video before buying it, but at the current price, it's so very much worth it. The soundtrack is great, but keep in mind that if you do watch videos online, you won't hear it due to copyrights.

Hut ab!

Ganz zu schweigen von den vielen Allusionen und versteckten Details der Pop-Kultur der 80er und 90er, in fast jeder Station gibt es was zu entdecken, herrlich. Klar das muss man mögen, da ich aber in dieser Zeit aufgewachsen bin und es recht gut in das ohne hin etwas schrullige Universum passt das hier konstruiert wurden, kann man auch ohne Hintergrundwissen über diese Zeit bestimmt gut damit leben.

Nach ungefähr 6 Stunden (Offline-Modus wird wohl nicht mitgerechnet) hab ich knapp 1/3 der 38 Sonnensysteme bereist und bin dabei mehr oder weniger geradlinig der Story gefolgt. Wodurch ich eine theoretische Spielzeit von 20 Stunden herausbekomme. Vorausgesetzt ich werde mich nach der Story nicht noch als Space-Trucker verdingen, naja wird wohl eher doch mehr...

Die Auswahl der Raumschiffe reicht von Taxi-Shuttels über Abfangjäger und Mittelschwere Fregatten bis hin zum großen Handelspott, mit unzähligen Upgrades. Da ist für jeden Spielstil das richtige dabei. Zu den annehmbaren Aufträgen zählen unter anderem Personen- und Gegenstandtransporte, Schwerlasttransporte via Traktor-Strahl, das bespitzel von Personen oder kartografieren von Planeten so wie das Zerstören von Weltraumtrümmern und der Klassiker, das Eliminieren von Piraten. Außerdem können noch Wracks von havarierten Raumschiffen geplündert werden.

Mit der Steuerung kam ich nach kurzer Eingewöhnung gut zurecht und dank der Trägheit entsteht ein angenehmes Semi-Realistisches Gefühl der Raumschiffe, vor allem im ""Split"" genannten Sprungantrieb zwischen den Systemen. Da ich eher ein friedliebender Handelsvertreter bin und äh ja, schon ein alter Sack, kommen mir die Kämpfe etwas hektisch und unübersichtlich vor, soweit ich das beurteilen kann sind aber die meisten Auseinandersetzungen optional.

Also ich bin dem Spiel verfallen und würde es den Entwickler wünschen wenn es noch mehr Spielern so ergeht.

It's indy, It's fresh, It's Retro, It's everything this Gen X gamer craves.   

I Grew up in the 80s and 90s, back then was the golden age of PC adventure gaming. Star control, space Quest, Star Trek the 25th-anniversary game and many others would keep me and my pals awake till odd hours of the night.  Trying to complete these games in record time, or with better scores, or just figure them out in the first place.  For a long time, I've had the itch to relive that kind of gaming experience. 

3030 Deathwar Redux manages to scratch that itch in a very novel way.   Without the constraints of being too ""realistic"" or ""edgy"" or ""simulator"" oriented, the devs are able to tell a story free from the shackles of having to EXPLAIN the science of it all, while at the same time, reference countless sci fi genre tropes with blatantly in your face easter eggs. 

For anyone who has played and loved Games like Star Control or especially Space Quest, you will instantly appreciate this. 

I have only had a short time with the game, and I can already see myself enjoying the open world space exploration and combat, and the humorous story and dialogue are right up my alley keeping it fresh and fun. 

It doesn't hold your hand too much, you have to figure a few things out as you go, but it does a fair job of guiding you to learning the ropes as you play.  Gently suggesting at the next reasonable course of action to get yourself back on track ASAP. 

It's not a perfect game by any means, and if you aren't into the brand of humor and gameplay it uses to tell it's a story you might not care for it at all.  If all you care about are high rez 3d computer crushing graphics, super easy linear shooters or anything like that, you probably won't want this game. However, had this come out in the 80s or 90s, it would have been a classic that would have shaped a generation of gamers perception of how to do a space sci fi game for the next decade.  

If you still have a soft spot for the old classics like the ones I mentioned at the start, you need grab this game and make a nice hot Tea and sit down on a rainy day and give this a whirl.

He kind of reminds me of Jack Burton from Big Trouble in Little China.(Btw GREAT movie) Bad luck and bad decisions just seem to go hand in hand with this guy. Due to some crazy prophecy dealing with bird names and a ship loaded to the ceiling with gold, all scavengers get a bullseye on their heads. This is where our story begins and things get even more crazy, with interesting characters, factions, and of course space travel.

3030 Death War Redux is an open space simulator, now the ""Redux"" part means that this is a revitalization. It's important to note because I didn't play the game back in its original heyday. I have only played this new version of the game. So keep in mind this won't be a comparison of the two but more of analyzation of what is in the game now. From what I understand, the graphics, story, side quests, balancing and a whole plethora of things are getting the overhaul from the previous iteration.

Usually, when I play these types of games, I find them to be almost exactly like space itself, a dark vacuum of nothing and where everything takes forever to do. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of content and missions but more importantly, the universe felt alive.  Boarding any station, greeted me every time with a slew of strange aliens, alien interiors, and quirky conversations. It was like the Star Wars cantina scene and I honestly couldn't get enough. This is one of the areas the game absolutely shines as you go about from station to station, collecting missions, making contacts, and trying to stay alive. Even arriving at a station was a dazzling display of holographic ad ships, and other kinds of ships buzzing in and out.

Over all, the mechanics are very reminiscent of the genre. You start with nothing and build yourself up. You can trade, escort, pick up cargo, bounty hunt, and perform many other tasks to build up your cash and eventually get a bigger, badder ship. One thing that I found unique to 3030 was the ability to scavenge derelict space ships for supplies, cargo, etc. The few times I did manage to find a destroyed vessel, my pulse would begin to race, wondering what I might find. You can't see very far and only have a small scanning droid to assist you locate items of importance. This is one area I definitely would love for them to expand on. Turn up the horror aspect and add some procedural design and scavenging can be practically its own game, if done right.

Another area that absolutely blew my mind was the games soundtrack. I don't say this very often but 3030 has one of the best and most well integrated soundtracks. The music has this awesome techno synth thing going that seems shot out of the 80's. You might think that doesn't work with this type of game but it really, really does. There are also some other instrumental pieces and alternative choices as some of the songs are licensed, and may cause an issue for streamers/youtubers.

Keep in mind that 3030 is in Early Access, so there is still things that need polish and attention. The game crashed a few times on me randomly. Also the UI isn't the most user friendly, I seriously wish there was a way to zoom in. If you play the game you will feel as if you are unnaturally far away from the action. I don't know if this is intended or something that is going to be addressed. The graphics/art style themselves are rather appealing to the eye. Consoles are rusted or dirty, other parts of the station show inhabitants going about their daily lives. Screens flicker with news and bartenders stroll back and forth. The galaxy itself looks great, with nebulas, stars, and everything in between. I just wish I could see it a bit better.

One of the biggest gripes I came away with was the combat in 3030. Combat is a bit of a mess and I still didn't quite understand the finer points after about six hours of playing. You have missiles and lasers and more or less just ending up shooting each other in the face and hope you have more hit-points. This is going back to the camera just being placed so far away that pin pointing shots is downright exasperating at times. Taking on more then one enemy is a logistical nightmare and sadly, enemies tend to attack in large groups. I tried using the different movement modes and found the same results. While I am not sure how to fix the combat, I can tell you it wasn't my favorite aspect for sure.

Thankfully combat isn't the most important aspect to the game, but it is obviously vital. I personally would recommend avoiding combat like the plague, but your mileage may vary. Plus there are more than enough other activities that can earn you tons of cash.

When you look at space simulators, they are a very ambitious type of game. You have almost as much work as someone would do for an MMORPG but for a single player game. Not only do you have to fine tune your basic mechanics of combat, but you have to micro manage dozens of systems such as factions, economy, and any story you may want to have. It's no small task and not an easy one, so obviously I will reserve judgement for final release. That being said the most important part for me, in these types of games, is an aspect that 3030 Deathwar Redux already has in oodles. It has personality, charm, and the universe feels alive.

Plus any game that throws in Crow T. Robot as a bartender has got my vote. So keep an eye on this one folks!",1484180469,1484180768,True,10,0,0.646233022212982178,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Has been a very pleasant surprise after I had to refund some games that just didn't live up to my expectations.
Well, this game for sure does.
At first glance it might not look like much. Pixel art graphics, not too many controls and all in 2D. Yea, not very 2016, right?
Well, who cares, the artwork is just perfect and somehow reminds me of the old Lucas Arts and Sierra point & click adventures like Indiana Jones and Gabriel Knight.

So what makes 3030 Deathwar Redux so good or even outstanding?
If it's not for the graphics (if you're the person who needs AAA top nodge textures and models)

- First, the music; it's just a perfect fit for this genre and really helps setting the mood.
- Second, we got the dialogs; oh my there're some really funny gems among them and the general quality of the writing is of a very high level. (Much higher than the quality of this review)
- Third thing up are the small, unseen things like handling and gameplay in general. Man, it's really cool that you have to navigate by yourself if you want to ""jump"" to a different system. No auto-pilot click here we go stuff. Nope, check your fuel, check your course and of we go. (Oh, crap, got a couple of degrees of course. Just awesome)

[h1] My thoughts on: 3030 Deathwar Redux[/h1]

3030 deathwar redux is an expanded version of 3030 deathwar and includes a mix of story and open world exploration where you play as freelance space pilot John Falcon.  You can take on jobs to earn money, fly around space and explore freely or try to find out why your ship was impounded. This version of the game adds a ton more stuff like more story, more characters, balance tweaks and much much more.

The graphics are in a retro 8-bit pixel style and i think they are well done although they might take some getting used to at first.

The first part of the game gives you a little run down on how to operate your space suit and has you track down salvage for a bit and after a cutscene or two has you fly your ship to the nearest space station. Both the space suit and space ship parts were really well done in my oppinion and i found it neat that you aren't confined to your space ship.

The music also really stood out in this game and really tied the whole game together.

DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.

3030 Deathwar Redux is a 2D open-world space adventure, though there are elements of many other genres within the game. Most of the time you spend the game flying your ship from place to place completing tasks, and when you're doing so, the game plays like the old-school game; ""Asteroids"" or other spaceship shooters. The rest of the time, your character is either on space stations picking up new jobs, trading, and talking to people OR at derelicts salvaging materials and other items. There is a variety of things to do within the game, and there is SOME element of choice making as well. The game may remind some people of ""Space Pirates and Zombies"", though I feel like this title offers a very unique experience on it's own.

--------

[b] Graphics: 8 / 10 [/b]

Art-style is subjective, and at first I didn't really enjoy the pixel design of the game (and usually I do). After playing the game for awhile, the style of the game really grew on me. The graphics of the game are really well done. The style is unique, and it gives the game a lot of charm. There's an abundance of characters and races, each with their own unique and interesting design. Most of the space-stations and derelicts you enter look kinda the same internally (with the exception of small details), though the exterior appearance of these places are really different and neat. Of course, this game's motif is space, so there is a ton of space themed objects, designs and graphics, though the game puts them together quite nicely. While traveling in space, there's usually a lot happening on screen. There's cargo ships, police and other vessels just roaming around (which you can interact with). When you're not around a station however, just traveling to another place, there isn't a whole lot happening aside from you passing by planets, asteroids, and derelicts IF you see them. The game is not too demanding, it should run fine on a low - mid-tier graphics card and CPU. 

--------

[b] Sound: 8 / 10 [/b]

The sound assets are just fine. All the gun sounds, ambient space sounds, and general space themed noises are great and fit right in with theme of the game. The main reason this game ranks so well in it's sound category is because of the amazing soundtrack/background music that plays throughout the game. There are quite a bit of beautiful vocal tracks within the game as well as some instrumentals. The only complaint I'd have about this is that; tracks don't loop or switch to another track after finishing. Though this is a minor personal gripe as you're usually not in space long enough for the track to finish (though sometimes you are). This also might annoy or bother some players because they might deem it as ""repetitive"" sounds. All in all, the soundtrack is amazing and I really hope they release an OST. 

--------

[b] Mechanics: 8 / 10 [/b] 

The mechanics are really well-done. There's so much to do in the game, though that being said, it is possible that the game might feel repetitive after ""grinding"" out side-jobs for cash. The good news is that there's a lot of different things you can do for cash. Some of these things depend on the kind of ship you own, and what kind of upgrades you have, but these things are not that difficult to obtain. The most basic thing you can do is dock at various space-stations and use the job console to find jobs; these kind of jobs include taxi services, package deliveries, trash clean-up, photo-taking, towing services and a few more that you can unlock through playing the game. Some of these jobs have time limits, and having a faster ship may be helpful. Some of these jobs also require you to have a certain amount of cabins or cargo space on your ship.   
 
There are also bounties you can take from the job console which help you hunt down space pirates for more cash, as well as loot their ships. Completing/not completing these jobs can impact your reputation which can have effects on various things or conversations. You can also find space pirates in each space system without having to take a ""mission"" for it. Sometimes civilians on space stations will also have jobs for you when you talk to them. You can also harvest asteroid fields for minerals and ore which you can sell at trade consoles. Trade consoles are also at space stations. Each station sells and buys goods at different prices, so trading is another way cash can be made. 

Another way to make cash within the game is to become a pirate yourself. You can ram into cargo ships, destroy civilian ships and work at pirate outposts. Though usually this gets you in trouble with the law, as well as places a bounty on your head. There may be other ways to make cash later on in the game. There are also a few random events that happen every now and then that may grant the player rewards.

The flying and combat in the game is simple. You use the arrow keys to move around and hit the space and enter keys to fire off your weapons. The movement style is sort of like those other float-y movement space-shooters. You can buy different weapons and missiles to fit to your ship, as well as other ship upgrades. Not all ships can be fitted with the same equipment, so knowing which ships are good for battle and which are good for other missions is important. Although this might not affect everyone; the controls of the game take a while to get used to as they don't feel right or comfortable when first played (for both flying in space and walking around). 

-------- 

[b] Final Personal Remarks: [/b]

The first time I played the game I wasn't too keen on the graphic style, like I said earlier, it really grew on me. There are some aspects of the game I don't partake in (such as derelicts) because I still haven't completely gotten used to the design. That being said, I still think the game looks great. The story seems really interesting, and it looks like you unlock and discover new things as you go through it. The game's tone is a little humorous and actually does have neat references. The dialogue in the game is great, and is actually worth reading in my opinion. The devs spent a lot of time with the dialogue, as there's so much of it from almost every NPC you meet. The game has a real charm and I really enjoy games like this where you have to try and make money somehow, but also gives you so many ways to do so. The music is lovely and I wish there was an OST or something somewhere. The game is currently in early access but has lots to offer. Even though more and more features are being added to the game, I believe it's already really good as it is.

I hope developers will hire a dedicated writer to make a lot of quests (text quests fit perfectly in games like this). Also I wish systems were more populated.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
This was really a pleasure to play as it has so much content in this game and the devs still want to change more of this game and i wish them good luck and hope this game gets more popular.

Very reminiscent of Armada (the Dreamcast one) and still-incredible Space Rangers, but even easier to pick up and jump into.

3030 Deathwar Redux is an update to a remake of a 2007 indie game. Confusing I know but it's to the game's benefit.

This is an open-galaxy space adventure with a mid-90s DOS aesthetic. There's a story which you can follow or not as you choose and there's also a variety of activities to undertake, including trading, one-off missions, piracy and scavenging derelicts for resources which can be used to upgrade your ship and its capabilities. The core concept are very much reminiscent of older games in the genre like Privateer, Freelancer or even Elite to a certain degree. The story seems kind of generic and goofy but in a Firefly sort of way that doesn't take itself at all seriously which I can appreciate.

People are either going to find the retro graphics endearing or eye burning. I'm very much in the former camp, as someone who grew up in that era of gaming. It also has the advantage of making the game's requirements very low, so you can easily play it on lower power laptops when on the go. It contols entirely with the keyboard as well. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and diverse and while a lot of the songs seem contextually out of place, it's still great to see so many different tracks available in some many genres. You'll spend a lot of time travelling out in space so having good stuff to listen to is always a bonus.

My complaints with it at this stage of development are the mission variety and that scavenging hulks is painfully samey. The missions are the usual crop of delivery, bounty hunting or transport missions but that's kind of it. Some more mixing up of that would be nice. In addition, scavenging a derelict literally just involves flying up to it, watching an animation, moving down a tiny hallway that never has anything in it but the loot, picking up the loot and watching another animation. The developers have said they plan to flesh this out more and I hope they do.

Make no mistake, this is a game that pays homage to the old school ""space trucking"" genre and has every intention to. If you're not into that, you won't be into this but if you are, it's a good time that can be enjoyed in short or long sessions. I plan to cover the game again once it hits final release and I'm anxious to see the new content additions at that point.

I love the atmosphere and I love how the world progresses and feels like it evolves throughout, with headlines and news articles going on as things unfold around you, when in stations the seperate semi-visible other portions of the stations with vehicles and whatnot, and the intercom calling out new intakes of Stock and depertures etc. You can totally imagine this being a viable and real world and it's amazing. 

Story so far is pretty great, can't really say anything without spoilers but it's pretty interesting but sometimes it may be confusing as it ends up progressing whilst you're not doing ""story missions"" where sometimes it just does stuff as time goes on.

Settings and whatnot are very good, for youtubers / streamers you can avoid the ballache of editing and copyright strikes from a basement dweller thanks to the devs including the option to disable copywrited tracks in the settings. And my personal favourite, you can check to turn of vocal music and only have instrumental, which I absolutely love and it makes the experience much better. Graphics options are plentiful for allsorts of various options and crap if your system has trouble processing some stuff.

Only negatives I can think of are the map is a little strange and doesn't auto-update nebula spots, you can't really set a course to an undiscovered star system, and also the scavenging mini-part is very short and I feel it would be really exciting to expand upon. Honestly haven't looked much/at all into the development so far so take this with a mound of salt, but the salvaging / inside of ship stuff would be super cool to have more details and exploration towards.

Combat is very fun and basic, maybe be somewhat hard to figure out at first, and honestly battles seem to lean in favour of whoever can turn the hardest because if they can auto-manuever you you're pretty fucked, even in a pretty heavy ship, unless you got missiles or something. I stick with tiny ships haven't gone into heavy stuff much tbh.

Aside from that, a very fun game to hop into and play for a good few hours. I'd say honestly 7.5/10 But definately leaning towards more an 8-9/10 and especially when this becomes more improved in the future, I seriously can't wait it's been very fun so far, just feel the 'little things' are missing here and there.

I threw some Pros/Cons list

Edit 10.05.2016
Developers actually work on the game.
This is biggest Pros that any game could have.

Pros:

[list] 
   [*]Great fly mechanics
   [*]Nice pixel graphics
   [*]Pretty lasers particles
   [*]I like that nebulas labirinth
   [*] Dialogues are interesting to read first 2 hours
   [*] Great crew introducing
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
   [*]The crew say GO F YOURSELF . we going on adventure without you. ( You see them 2-3 times through the play but they generally just tell you what they did )
   [*]Stupid AI and useless enemies (DogFight is absolutely crap)
   [*] Balanceless missions
   [*] Very disbalanced task\reward activities ( I dont know why there so many shipwreck from which i can get some loot  which i can sell for 15k when i can make easy mission for 400k)
   [*] Awful scalability ( You can't get nice pixel perfect graphics with you favorite 1080p )
   [*] Music is bugged hard, it stuck after 1 track and not play until you dock\undock or click Next Song in the sound options.
[/list]

Conclusion :

This game has adequate pricing.

This game touch a few genres and make winks to classic cult movies and games with its tongue-in-cheek dialogues and encounters, and also making use of with its artwork. This last aspect may not be the finest but it really does it works portraying familiar worlds and characters. Here you can see aspects not only other great space sim games, but also from games of the adventure genre: the main character is an Indiana Jones wannabe and those colorful yet shady space stations will give you this bladerunneresque feel...

Even if there are elements made with nostalgic purposes this is a game that stand on his own. It is well made technically, the fighting AI is great and provides you with a decent challenge, the fact that there several ways to earn money avoid grinding, the big open world encourages exploring, and the history is compelling and makes you want to play the next chapter to see how the plot evolve. Oh, and that soundtrack is a score! it is very varied, but it all sounds great. Sometimes adding to the retro half of the game and sometimes to the half futuristic.

Another aspect to take into account is that the devs are passionate and really eager for feedback and ideas to keep expanding the game.

That said there a few small things:

-occasional sound bugs, music stops playing, SFX stop working
-maybe i missed something, so this could be inaccurate, but i'd like to see more story with Kent and Vasquez

Also, most of my experience is with the orginal game and I'm still feeling out the new one.

3030 Deathwar is a good space game. It has all the top-down real-time space stuff you could ask for in a large open-roam universe, trading, quests, combat and even some adventure. The trading is simple but well implemented, stuff is worth more in different systems and you can play the market to your benefit while steadily upgrading to bigger and bigger ships. The quests are also well-done with the usual variation, combat, delivey, discovery, salvage, mining, bounty-hunting, etc. The combat is like a souped-up version of Asteriod, control your momentum, dodge the enemy's bullets and missle while firing your own.

The games main strengths lie in its writing and its music. While every station is much the same format of bar, hanger, trade and job areas, each character you encounter (and there are so many) has a little dialogue tree and intresting things to say. In fact, the adventuring and dialogue trees are great in that they call back to old choose-your-own-adventure and point'n'click adventure games while meshing into the actual space-flying-around-part. Also the music is great, up-beat and catchy pop for flying around and suitable instrumental stuff for the adventure parts.

The main weaknesses of the game came from it's Early Access nature. There aren't as many resolutions as you'd hope, there's no option to change the controls from flying with the arrows to flying with WASD (a personal bugbear of mine) and some the story quests aren't as flexible as they should be. For example, in an early story quest somebody was gunning for me and, being out-gunned, I ran away to another system. I was then treated to a little pixel cutscene implying I killed the guy I ran away from.

All-in-all though, a solid, quirky game they may actually end up sucking away hours upon hours of your time.",1461927434,1461927434,True,5,0,0.463231563568115234,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Will be sinking many hours into this over the coming weeks for sure.
Definitely the best 2d space game i can ever remember playing.

If you're having issues getting the game to use your whole monitor in full screen, just select a resolution with the correct ratio as your monitor and make sure you're using the scaling options in your GPU control panel.",1461850866,1461854195,True,7,1,0.389122515916824341,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The version before the Steam release kept me grasped for hours. I love the art style, the humour, the sound design, the music and the gameplay itself.  It's got a real Firefly vibe to it...

There are few niggles to do with controls, but I'm sure the proactive developer will sort those out with community feedback.

I really hope the game does well on Steam, and I thoroughly recommend it to all space game fans. 

Disclaimer: I received a Steam key from the developers as I donated money when 3030 Deathwar was a ""pay what you want"" release. The fact I donated (after I'd tried it and loved it) shows how good the game is, in my opinion! :)",1461847565,1461847565,True,5,1,0.446563154458999634,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I have been thoroughly enjoying 3030 Deathwar for quite a while. Ever since their release on itch.io (is that the right site?), this game has mesmerised me in how simple a space game can be but still have such a great depth. There is so much charm here, so much fantasy and comedy that just mixes in the perfect fashion.

My hours here on Redux are low for now, hoping that with all these great games coming out that I can still find the time to be in awe of this super simple, super deep space trading game.

So don't be discouraged by the tongue-in-cheek comedy or the seemingly crude artwork (the artstyle totally works, seriously give it some time!).

Do it for yourself. Do it for space games. And don't forget, keep your tractor beams warm and your passenger cabin empty! o7",1461842538,1461842538,True,10,0,0.514922142028808594,0,False,False,True,False,,,
