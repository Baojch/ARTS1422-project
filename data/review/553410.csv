Your objective is to sink the ships before they made it to the end. If 20 ships reaches the end, you lose.

There are 5 buildings which you can place, but the game doesn't give an explanation about their capability. There's a crossbow tower, an antenna-light building, a hammer, cannon and a crystal. From what I gathered, the crossbow is a rapid fire tower, while the cannon is slower but is effective against larger ship. Both the laser and the crystal are more powerful, but the sharp wooden hammer inflicts the most damage.

These pirate ships come in various sizes, the bigger it is, the more attack it takes to sink. The more ships you sink, the more golds you earn. These golds are needed to upgrade existing building, or construct more building. Unfortunately, the game doesn't display how much gold is needed to upgrade the building. These buildings can be level up twice. A max level crossbow can wipe out a fleet of ships very easily, and when you have several more of these maxed level buildings, you are practically invincible. In fact in my first gameplay, I was so overwhelming powerful, I went through more than 10 waves of ships without doing anything much (the ship waves seems to stop getting more powerful after certain waves, so they got sinked almost as soon as they appear)! I ended up quitting the map to the main menu because it was going on forever, and I see that the rest of the maps are still locked.

Speaking of maps, there are only 3 playable maps, 1 of which is only playable from the start. In other words, this title is severely lacking of content too.

This game make use of content in terms of VR capability too. you can shift the map up/down left riight with the trackpad, but you can't scale nor rotate the map. The VR support brings nothing to the table for this game. The background just keep going too and it gets rather repetitve.

Due to these reasons (unbalanced gameplay, repetitive, lack of contents etc) I am rather regretful to say I can't recommend this title. If you wish to see what I mean in this review, check out my gameplay video of the first map below

I love being able to fly over the map like a god and place turrets where needed. The split paths are fun but I wish they would be predictable each wave as they would fly right past my defences. I think with some tweaks to gold increase and maybe some extra features this could be a daily play.

首先我们想说的是游戏的视角问题。玩家的视角被固定在了一个很诡异的维度上，轻触手柄中央的圆盘即可上下移动。但是在视频中，视角是可以随意移动的，可能是某种不知名的BUG发生，希望制作方加以改进。加之游戏并未对操作做出多少解释，在尚未了解游戏的操作方式之前，我们被这个奇特的操作方式弄得头昏脑涨，完全不明白自己的视角为什么一直在上下移动。
再说塔防本身。这款游戏的塔防内容非常普通，根本没有特色可言，玩家使用手柄选定放置炮台的区域，然后再选择花费多少金钱来建造何种炮台。
画面就不用多说了，各种炮台、弓弩的造型都比较细致，但底下的河道蜿蜒却显得格外粗糙，希望大家谨慎购买吧。

Really fun, I played through 25 waves!  There's marks of quality all throughout this.  Moving around with the vive controller was pretty good, and I liked the controls in general.  It might be a really good game to play with a controller instead of the Vive wands.  I was standing the whole time I played, however I think I'll sit down for the next round.    

The gameplay is what it claims to be: a complete tower defense game!  Animated graphics are fun and cartoonish, and pretty fun.  The strategies in this RTS at the moment are pretty basic, you're a position where you are defending a keep by planting towers in the riverlands leading up to your Keep.  Waves of pirate ships throw themselves at you, and you prevail!  Well, I hope you prevail.  If you want to win, you'll want to think about your time on target and look for choke points in the path of the river.  

Graphics are basic, no photorealism here, which is fine with me, I like the cartoon ships and towers better anyway.  Sound is minimalist, just barely present, which is to say: well done!  There are many pitfalls in developing for VR, and it looks like this handsome, hot shot third year UCS student just skirted just about all of them.  You could see the potential here for many of the things that made Sid Meyer's Pirates! such a great amount of fun.

(One criticism I have with the attacking pirate forces:  You can SEE that the river goes right by the town, right?  Couldn't you just disembark there?  Send a crew on foot to dam up the river and just walk over to the windmill?  I know it's not the same as sacking the keep, but really, just conduct a damned raid, at best it will help your supply situation, and at the very least it's demoralizing to your enemy!)
