the music is bad in that it is degradingly boring like its the music that a movie would use to portray how a person has a boring  mundane job. many people wouldn't even consider it music but that's not the bad part..... the bad part is YOU CAN'T MUTE IT!!!!!!! there is no audio controls in the menu so I cant even just mute it and listen to my own music without going and grabbing another device and playing music from it with my computer muted so just based on principle I have to give a negative review

This game uses the Unreal 4 engine and it shows- the physics are great, the texturing is superb, and the environments are wonderful! The music is calming, and believe me, calming music is needed when you're still starting to get the hang of how the physics work. The gameplay, though simple, is great. It takes a lot of skill to round sharp corners and slow down before you fall off the edge of the platform.
Mini Rollers' problem is not in the gameplay or environments or presentation.
Mini Rollers' problem is that it is [i]actually[/i] a [b]WRESTLING GAME.[/b]
I HAVE NEVER WRESTLED WITH A GAME'S CAMERA HARDER IN MY LIFE THAN I HAVE IN MINI ROLLERS.
THIS WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING AN AVERAGE JOE IN A FIVE MINUTE CAGE MATCH WITH JOHN CENA.
JUST. LOOK. AT. THE. BALL.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION I WOULD BE GOING IN BECAUSE THE CAMERA WOULD BE ZOOMED IN ON [i]NOTHING[/i] AND THEN GOODBYE!! OFF THE EDGE I GO BECAUSE I DIDNT EVEN SEE IT COMING

So. Overall, if you can get past a heinous, irritating, glitchy camera,
Mini Rollers is a good game.",1498868059,1500347484,False,2,2,0.516891896724700928,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It can be unforgiving at times, for example in the third level there is a gaint beetle that can send you back to the beginning but you can easily avoid it. Six levels in you get a new ball and it is slightly different from the first ball, the third (level 11) and fourth( level 14 and it is fast, lighter and doesn't like water) ball isn't that far a part form each other so don't worry you don't have to play six levels for a new ball as far as i know.

When checking out the steam page it reminded me of Marble Blast. Unfortunately, this game is very slow. You move like a snail, especially up slopes. It's frustrating. There's unforgiving deaths. There's ""shortcuts"" and an ""energy bar"", both of which I have no clue what they are and I've played for almost an hour. I feel like that should be like level 2/3 stuff. Instead, I've gone through four or five levels of just rolling around.

The third level would send you back a couple minutes of this snail-like movement if you died (there's checkpoints, but they're not spreadout correctly). After about eight minutes into the level, there's this bug that'll toss you over the wall, right back to the beginning. Come on. It's level three.

The fifth level has a floating clear pyramid with a ""?"" in it. I had hoped it would be one of the powerups that I somehow hadn't encountered 40 minutes into this game yet. But no, it just dropped me in the middle of no where and fell to my death. What the heck? That's not fun. If it took me like 10 seconds to get back, maybe, but it's just stupid with how slow you move. Deaths are unforgiving in this game, albeit easily avoidable. I wouldn't mind as much as long as it wasn't in the first five levels.

I'm five levels into the game and I have no idea what the point of these gems are. I'm thinking ""Why should I care about these?"" I eventually realized after going to the home screen there's a shop where you can buy a ""slow-mo"" mode (because this game isn't slow enough) and some other locked features.

Also, there's no way to adjust the in-game music/effects. Why not?

I realize that this was developed by one person over 5 months, and I can commend the developer. I couldn't make this. It looks great. But, that doesn't take away from how frustrating this game is. It's slow, it's unforgiving, and I feel like more of the mechanics should be introduced earlier.",1497795395,1497795395,False,6,0,0.580672979354858398,0,True,False,False,False,,,
