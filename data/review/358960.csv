Геймплей тут с первого взгляда незамысловатый — беги и перепрыгивай со здания на здание, но присутствуют несколько режимов со своими особенностями и некоторые нюансы, благодаря которым игра становится интересней. Во-первых, ваш человечек ускоряется с каждым прыжком и иногда требуется замедлять его, врезаясь в ящики. Во-вторых, чем сильнее нажимаешь на пробел, тем выше человечек подпрыгивает. В-третьих, вокруг вас может случиться все, что угодно — например на вас внезапно сбросят бомбу.

Больше всего мне понравилось, что несмотря на всю простоту, на экране разворачивается целая история, которую можно понять, внимательнее присмотревшись к окружению и задникам. Эта атмосфера катастрофы, вторжение роботов, напоминающих пришельцев из ""Войны миров"" — все это действительно круто и делает обычный раннер немного глубже. Особенно учитывая, что стилистика у игры прикольная (есть выбор между режимами 2d и 3d) и, что нравится лично мне, приятная цветовая гамма. Все выглядит очень динамично, взрывается и разваливается, что делает простой раннер довольно зрелищным.

Отдельно хочется отметить саундтрек. Он действительно хорош.

Думаю, эта игра как минимум отлично поможет развлечься, когда хочется во что-нибудь поиграть, но нет сил или времени на что-то серьезнее раннера.",1673453767,1673453767,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,True,,,

[b]Canabalt[/b] - это однокнопочная серопалитровая инди-игра в жанре бегулька-выживулька.

Суть игрового процесса - пробежать-пропрыгать офисным работником как можно дальше по генерируемым крышам во время атаки инопланетян.
Мешают нам в этом рушащиеся под ногами здания, резко поднимающиеся балки, не вовремя вылезающие стёкла, сбрасываемые мины, внезапные удары ножкой-треножкой иии автоускорение персонажа!
Помогают сбавить ход и чуток передохнуть стоп-ящики, коробки и кресла на колесиках.
Имеется и небольшая загвоздка с высотой прыжка - приходиться удерживать кнопку почти наугад. 
Травм от падения с высоты, как у Гордона Фримена, здесь нет!

Steam-версия на 75 MB превосходит 117 на PSP, куда уж там оригинальной ""флэшке""!
У ""пихи"":
- 1 режим, 
- 1 мужской скин,
- 1 лучший результат и последний забег,
- полезная фишка с красной точкой на камере, предупреждающая о нападении,
- 3 мелодии от Барановского (знакомого мне по Айзеку из подвала).

В версии для ПК:
- 9 режимов,
- по 2 случайных скина М/Ж, 
- дополнительный новый режим отрисовки в 3D,
- 4-я мелодия ""Mega Ranabalt"",
- локальный кооператив на двоих + Remote Play Together,
- достижения, доски рекордов, коллекционные карточки! 

Самый сложный аспект проекта - это поиск сильного второго игрока на совместную марафонскую ачивку. Одному, конечно, тоже можно клацать сразу на две кнопки мыши, но скорее тут разовьётся косоглазие, чем выйдет нужный результат. Да и скорость бега после ошибки тут запредельная - все тормозилки исчезают после падения компаньона.

Как по мне - отличный перевыпуск ""односложной поделки"", и просят за него совсем немного!

It was first released on iOS and was ported to the PC years later. Very unfortunate timing as the market was then already flooded with clones and even games that added more ideas to the concept. It never stood a chance.

Known as an autorunner or infinite runner Canabalt is one of the games to popularize the genre. Released in 2009 for iPhone and iPad users it was immensely popular among the mobile gamer crowd. It’s a simple concept that ended up being really addicting.
As you may have guessed the game will automatically run for you. The only user input that is required is the press of one button, and one button only, and that is to jump.
When the game starts your character will run forward, to the right, while always being shown from a 2D perspective. The game will generate a random city for you every time you start the game, or (retry) a level. Since you’re running across rooftops expect to see skyscrapers, cranes, open floors and girders, among other stuff with random gaps between them that can always be crossed. As long as you have enough speed, that is. You see, there will also be obstacles on top of these buildings, like crates and chairs. Run into them and you’ll stumble, losing speed. And this can be critical as you might not make a specific jump without having enough speed. Eventually it is inevitable and you’ll drop in between two buildings or smack into a building, or something else. The game will keep track of the distance you have traveled. The goal of the game is to stay alive for as far as you can get, i.e. earning a high score. If that’s not what you want from a game then you might as well find something different to play as that’s all there is to this game really.

The graphics and animations are kind of awesome. It uses different kinds of grey in order to create a unique, but somber world. And although you only see your character, glass and birds - maybe a few other things I can’t remember - these are all animated in a convincing manner.
The sounds effects are quite limited, but the glass shattering immediately jumps out and comes to mind whenever I think of this game. There’s naturally no voice acting since there’s no story and the music is okay-ish, but becomes a little repetitive a little while into the game. It makes sense though, as the game is only meant to be played for maybe an hour (and that’s pushing it; most of us will play for 30 minutes or so and then call it quits again until the next day).

Canabalt is one of the games that introduced infinite runners to the general public. It’s also the reason why I wanted to review it, because it’s a title that therefore belongs on my list of unique and refreshing games. I don’t think it’s a title that truly belongs on PC; for that it’s just too shallow gameplay-wise. But play it on a mobile device and you’ll have a good time for sure, even if it’s just for a few hours.

Canabalt is a game developed by Finji and Kittehface Software and published by Finji

The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Canabalt overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay action platformer game to play in short bursts!

Es casi al vicio decirlo, pero es compatible con mando. Aunque con un solo botón, no es que esto ayude mucho. Aconsejo probar su versión flash antes de comprar. No es un juego para todo el mundo.

Buying Canabalt is pretty much a donation to the developers, since everyone interested in the game has probably already played it elsewhere. I have no issue with that, and I actually got the game from an ancient Humble Bundle that added the Steam key in mid 2015. For anyone unfamiliar with the game, I'd recommend looking at the flash version at least. This game was a major part in starting the endless runner genre, but it hasn't evolved since those early days. Check out [i]Run Or Die[/i] for something similar with much more depth.

Canabalt is functionally fine, runs well, and features some nice Steam integration. The game is still visually compelling. The music is strong initially, but each of the four songs loop quickly enough to get tiring. I have turned off the music after 90 minutes of it. 

My main issue comes up in gameplay. The levels work well enough in the beginning, but the challenges quickly become trivial and repetitive. Canabalt shows off all its mechanics pretty quickly, and the difficulty ramps up primarily in speed. Levels gradually throw more of the same at you, with over 50% of the screen being space between buildings at times. The game expects precision jumping when the controls struggle to provide it, and it expects you to time the jumps faster and faster. Eventually you'll hit that point where you softly jumped over one building, but didn't jump high enough to land on the next building (which wasn't even on screen before you started to jump) and you are doomed.

Honestly, the game has run out of material within a few hours, and I had to idle to even get the cards. The material is initially great, but it feels a bit dated compared to modern runner games. As mentioned, [i]Run Or Die[/i] has a familiar style while doing unique things and giving finer movement controls. I constantly wanted the ability to fall faster on demand, to have deeper control of my running, which other games have done. I could appreciate a game that does things uniquely or better than the rest, but Canabalt lacks in both areas. Even at $3 USD, the content feels short of the value. Check out free versions, and see if you are still interested after a few hours. If so, this is a great way to pay the developers back.",1521009896,1521009896,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But I have to warn you: it's only because it's priced at 3 euro's (2.99). It's an endless runner that only has one button: jump. Your guy (or girl...you get a random protagonist) steadily accelerates from ""running"" into ""surpassing the sound barrier"" while you jump from randomly generated rooftop to rooftop. Heck...you can grok the idea of this game well within two minutes.

The main merit of canabalt is that it does nothing wrong. And while that sounds simple in theory, you'd be surprised how many games go wrong on that. Canabalt doesn't have a narrative, but the visuals (everything's grey or white), music and gameplay do tell some kind of story. The skyline consists of gigantic monsters or robots attacking the city. Jets pass by, and the ever speeding run gives this atmosphere of impending doom.

I'd say somehting in the veins of ""there are better roguelikes out there"". There are. There are also better endless runners out there. But at this price point? No. In addition: this game is balls hard (unfair, even), and that's relative to its counterparts that are rarely easy. I can list those other games...but they would be different games. And - again - at this price point, canabalt is pretty solid. It'll never be game of the year or even be anything but a filler...but it's pretty good at what it sets out to do.

One of the very first 'runners' I ever played continues to be one of the most basic, and still one of the best, not that this says a lot.

If you know what a runner is you're halfway there, if not, I'll explain. A runner is, simply, about moving as long as possible through an obstacle course. The game moves you forward and it is up to you to simply jump to avoid obstacles or traps that will end your run. That's really it.

So with several modes and single screen two player, Canabalt is about as straightforward as it gets. As you progress things move faster, but this can be helped a little by allowing your character to collide with occasional chairs or crates sprinkled in your path.

This is a strictly no-frills game that does what it sets out to do.

2. This game is amazing. You can play it in a browser for free but it's worth buying just because I like giving money to people for doing things that I like that they did. You can also play it when you don't have an internet connection--though I might recommend the iOS/Android version over this for ease.

One reason I install it on my phones is because you can then set the music as your ringtone and whenever anyone calls you, people know you are the kind of person who installs [i]Canabalt[/i] to their phone so they can play it when they have no internet connection. This is nothing to keep secret, people. Shout it from the mountain tops!

5. This game works by attaching a button on your mouse or keyboard directly to your brain. Or, that's what it feels like. 

6. You run right and use your brain button to jump. This is both more and less complex than it sounds.

7. There are a variety of special challenge modes that mix it up a bit. This is not necessary but welcome. The pace and timing of the various modes are subtly different in ways that doesn't essentially change gameplay but can keep things feeling fresh if you play for a relatively extended time period. 

8. The graphical options have an anti-aliasing setting. Seriously?

9. There is a multi-player mode if you have friends. (You don't.)

10. There is something very polished about the rhythm to this game. It has this very forgiving sort of collision detection so that even if an obstacle thrown in front of you seems impossible, you can actually (almost?) always get past it w/o dying if you react close to instantaneously. 

11. Do you hear me? You will blame it on the game but it's your own fault you died.

12. Number 12 is not that important. 

13. If nothing else, you can pick up a bunch of Steam badges relatively quickly for cheap. That's a stupid thing to want to do but you can do it.",1494615421,1494615421,True,2,0,0.52449566125869751,0,False,False,False,False,,,

When I say ""frustrating"", I don't mean to whine that it's hard.  I like hard games, but I like ""Yes I did it!"" hard, not ""christ fckn finally"" hard.  Canabalt is the latter - success in Canabalt is 10% skill, 90% getting lucky with the random level generator.  It's not a fulfilling experience when most of your deaths are caused by BS you couldn't have done anything about (like occasionally when you're jumping onto a building and it's completely destroyed except for a small platform, which is never where you land).  It would be a fun ""I've got a few minutes to kill"" game, except it's not really that fun.

Secondly, it's not memorable.  The whole game is the same thing, running and jumping.  The first five minutes are the same as several hours in.  It took 10 minutes to see every type of obstacle the game has, and a little over an hour to ""beat"" all the challenge maps and get all the worthwhile achievements.  What's worse, is I've already forgotten all of it - the game is always the same, so nothing ever stands out.

It feels like a flash game that you spend a couple minutes with then move on.  If it had something more - like a cooky story, or crafted levels instead of randomly generated - it might have been more enjoyable.

You enter a stage, your character starts running (and slowly accelerating constantly) and your only way of avoiding obstacles is to jump. You can't jump lower or higher, you press space and your character always makes the same jump. All of that is fine. But why are the stages randomly generated? Why can't I see ahead (because the screen didn't scroll there yet)? Why can't I develop strats based on the level's layout (because the level is different each time you play)?

The game quickly becomes a shitty leap of faith guessing game, where in most of the cases you jump (because there's a hole in the ground) and you end up slapping your face against the wall you couldn't see, because the screen didn't show you the obstacle before you jumped.

An updated review is available as a ""Quick Look"" available here: https://youtu.be/vf69CrrkwGU

Canabalt is one of the first of the modern endless runners in the modern era.   I remember playing it originally on Kongregate in 2009.  So it's an old game, but the game published on steam is similar to the one that was originally put on Kongregate.

Canabalt is pretty simple.  You're a guy, you start running forward, and you slowly speed up, you try to avoid boxes and other things that might slow you down and you avoid falling off buildings. While simple in concept, there's a surprising amount of gameplay for the game, as well as strategies (for instance hitting a box may be helpful if you're moving too fast, but then you might not have enough speed to make a jump). 

Instead of just the pure endless runner, which is contained here. Canabalt also includes a variety of different ""zones"" each focusing on a specific challenge, whether crashing through windows, dodging bombs, invisible roofs, or so on.  These zones are simple one offs, but some of them are quite challenging, and it helps the player to practice a specific skill.

Canabalt never really rises beyond it's relatively simple premise, however it offers a lot of challenge, and because the stages are random, it gives you a ""one more try"" type of feel.  There's a wonderfully developed two player mode which allows the players to compete against themselves or cooperate at the same time, it's up to the players to see who went farther, but the two scores are added together, so it's a collaborative experience. 

I recommend the game to people who want a simple fast game, they can play endlessly.    It won't be for everyone, and at 3 bucks, the game might be pushing the price, but if you get into it, it can give you many hours of fun.  The different zones will likely take you an hour to beat just for achievements, and then to get the distance, there's a lot of challenge, so it can takes you quite a long time to beat.

(I got this game in a humble bundle that I paid for, but didn't realize I got a steam code for it.  I'm glad I did.)",1478378642,1532332862,True,3,0,0.520777523517608643,2,False,False,False,False,,,

There's only one control, which is the jump button. By default the jump button is set to the spacebar, LMB, and (A) button on a 360 controller. You can rebind all of those as well as the 2P controls available. The 2P is local only.

It's a 2D game through and through but you can turn on the ""3D"" settings which just makes the game 2.5D, as in it's played in 2D but the backgrounds and models are in 3D. They can get a little distracting and because this game's also part platformer, it can possibly make judging platform distance a little more of a task.

The music here's pretty nice but most of it doesn't seem appropriate for a game about running. Maybe for what's going on in the background but, it being a game, I'm more focused on what I'm doing than what's around me.

The concept of the game's very simple, which is just to run endlessly to the right as far as you can without dying via falling or exploding, the latter being a rare case. Your high score in this case is obviously how far you went from the starting point to where you died.
As you automatically run, all you're to do is jump from platform to platform avoiding pitfalls, boxes, and bombs. Pitfalls and bombs are obvious deaths but tripping hazards such as boxes & chairs are there to slow you down. Annoying, but those hazards can also be a life saver. The longer you run uninterrupted the faster you get until you hit a point where luck becomes a bit more of a factor than skill. Eventually you'll be going so fast that the next time you jump you'll likely still be in mid-air before the next platform even comes on screen, leaving you almost no time to do anything or even make a judgement on what to do next. That problem is supposedly accomadated by the hazards' ability to slow you down but unfortunately luck also plays a part here as well since there's a good chance that a box may not come to slow you down when you need it the most. If you're too slow because you've been hitting boxes in succession then there's a really good chance you won't be fast enough to jump to where you need to be as the only way to speed up is to keep running without interruption. In short, proper management of hitting the tripping hazards can very much help with survival.

The 2P is pretty weak and doesn't really encourage a fun time since either player can't help one another in any way, but only hinder.
It's a co-op based multiplayer somehow and you're on the same exact screen running together on the same path, only player 2 always has the slight disadvantage at the start of each run because player 2 is always slightly ahead of player 1, leaving player 2 to have less screen space than 1. If one player hits a tripping hazard then the other player goes ahead of them, leaving less and less screen space for the runner who just went ahead. After a certain time passes with both players not being interrupted by a hazard then the both of 'em end up to the left of the screen again, usually a little slightly apart than they were when they started.
If one player dies, for some reason the screen progressively scrolls impossibly faster. Your jumps look cooler because of how far you jump as a result but because you won't know what platform's going to come up next due to how fast the screen moves you'll eventually die. So if one player loses, the other's screwed as a result.
The score in the end is the sum of the distance both players have accumulated. You can play the 2P mode by yourself.

There are some other ""game modes"" available but all they do is make each hazard more abundant in each mode except for a couple where one mode makes the platforms invisible and the other has [i]just[/i] platforms but [i]no[/i] hazards. Basically each mode is the same exact thing with just a tweak or two to it.

It's a quick little time-waster and the game's alright at being that, but that's about it. No technical problems as far as I'm concerned either.
The flash version is still officially free on other sites, which is practically the entirety of this game.
Probably the only good reason maybe to actually buy this game is to support the developers and even then it's probably best to just stick with the mobile version.",1478002470,1478004143,False,1,0,0.474452555179595947,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Canabalt, der Ursprung der Endless-Runner, ist eines jener Indie-Spiele die man wirklich mal gespielt haben sollte – und sei es nur für fünf Minuten in der kostenlosen Flash-Version.

Nebenbei wird man noch von einer genial-düsteren Atmosphäre eingefangen, die man so einem kleinen Casual-Spielchen gar nicht zutraut.
Aufgrund des extrem simplen Spielprinzips, dessen Steuerung nur eine Taste benötigt, kann es auch wirklich von jedem gespielt werden, der auch nur über einen einzigen gesunden Finger oder Zeh verfügt.
Die Frage, ob man Canabalt nun unbedingt als kostenpflichtige, wenn auch erweiterte Steam-Version braucht oder nicht, muss freilich jeder für sich selbst entscheiden. Die ganzen zusätzlichen Spielmodi und ein paar Grafikoptionen bieten aber zumindest einen eindeutigen Mehrwert im Vergleich zur kostenlosen Flash-Version.

Et ce qui marche toujours avec Canabalt, c'est le design et la direction artistique. Plus on va loin, plus les sauts seront complexes et plus vous devrez les anticiper.

  Le principe est simple : vous contrôlez un personnage sur un plan en 2 dimensions, qui devra tout simplement tenter de courir le plus loin possible, sautant d'immeuble en immeuble, sachant que le chemin est parsemé d'obstacles.

  Le gameplay est accessible à tous et ne nécessite que l'appui sur un bouton unique : le bouton de saut. Reste ensuite à se concentrer sur le paysage morne qui défilera de plus en plus vite au fur et à mesure de votre parcours; vous pourrez cependant ralentir cette vitesse en rentrant volontairement dans des caisses parsemées sur votre chemin. Il faudra donc gérer votre vitesse, pour aller assez lentement pour pouvoir suivre la cadence, mais assez vite pour pouvoir quand même sauter d'un immeuble à l'autre. 

  Les différents modes sont axés sur un élément du jeu en particulier : certains vous feront enchainer des sauts sur des immeubles s'écroulant les uns après les autres, tandis qu'un autre sera axé sur le bon timing de saut pour passer dans d'étroits bureaux. 
  Un mode deux joueurs en local est présent : deux personnages légèrement écartés, parcourant le même chemin. Le mode est assez fun car contrairement au solo qui vous fera rager en essayant de détrôner le meilleur score, on s'amusera ici de voir notre partenaire s'écraser lamentablement contre un bâtiment.

Canabalt is an endless runner forcing you to parkour over crumbling rooftops and hallways. A variety of obstacles such as boxes, windows, bombs, and speed changes keep this game relatively fun. There are 8 ""districts"" each with an inherent challenge that you alone or with a local coop buddy can brave through. 

Despite being ""endless"", each district has a mile marker challenge you can achieve in order to have a sense of accomplishment (for those that wish to only play games that they can ""beat"").

It was such a mystifying experience, playing this intense, engrossing Flash game on some random dude's website. I never thought I could be so entranced by a single-button game but the presentation absolutely made it and built on the hectic gameplay in the best way. They say it was the first of the endless runner genre, and even if it weren't, it would deserve a place of honor among them.

You'll never know who your hapless lady or fellow is or why their city is being annihilated by shadowy engines of destruction, but you won't have much time to wonder, either. Canabalt is a one-button game, and that button is jump. Your character runs to the right at an ever-increasing clip, and you need to jump them from rooftop to rooftop to billboard to girder to whatever else is in your path. Each run is randomized, with obstacles, crumbling buildings, windows, and occasional attacks from the marauding machines.

It's a simple premise, but the presentation takes it to another level. Set to pulse-pounding tracks, your journey through the chaos is all in silky-smooth, heavily-detailed gray-scale. Flocks of birds take flight as you charge past, the engines of destruction level buildings in the layered background, and stranger things still float past if you make it far enough. And if the presentation wasn't enough, there's a layer of strategy to the game as well. Letting your runner build up too much speed makes them hard to control, so sometimes you need to strategically hit an obstacle or two to slow them down.

Expanding on the original offering are eight challenge runs with different themes, like nothing but windows or no obstacles to slow you down. They each have a target distance to ""beat"" them which should keep you quite busy for awhile. Also included is a two-player mode that fully supports being played solo as a very interesting test of coordination. On top of all that is a full 3D mode that redoes the graphics in sharp polygons that still manage to stay true to the look and feel of the original. If infinite runners always struck you as thin on gameplay, you're bound to find plenty to do in this one.

There's not much negative I can say about Canabalt's triumphant return. A few of the obstacles, like the windows and walker legs, are quite difficult to overcome and can end some runs in frustration, but they hardly ruin the game. Outside of that, it's the same game that made a splash nearly a decade ago, with plenty of bells and whistles to justify a purchase. The original might be free, but if you have any love for infinite runners this will be a worthy addition to your library.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Canabalt is a score attack platformer.
You control the game with 1 button.
You gain speed over time, you jump over buildings and get over the obstacles( boxes windows crumbling building’s bomb’s)
The more speed you get the further you jump.
The boxes can be really helpfull to get rid of speed so you dont go to far.
Then you have the different platforms like billboards and construction cranes.
And you have windows which are the most difficuilt of em all, since if you go to high you drop down you go to low you drop down so you have to be really precise.
Then you have the challenges which are the new additions to this version, you have 8 of them some are pretty easy like the invisible buildings one.
You have 2 goals for challenges for like howfar you need to go.
Its a pretty simple game and can be really addicting or good for ill play 1 round and then do a other thing.

[h1] Graphics and audio[/h1]
The game has a nice black and white artstyle.
You have a 3d mode which makes everything look 3d i personally didnt like it, it made me play badly.
In the background you see a city being destroyed and ships flying over.
You have a female and male character which is a nice detail.
The soundtrack only has two tracks but is catchy and made by danny B.

[h1] Story [/h1]
The city is being destroyed and you run.

[h1]Final verdict[/h1]
The game is a solid one click score attack platformer with some new content which wasnt in the flash version.
there are plenty of obstacles like bombs crumbling buildings etc and everything is procedural generated.
If you’re looking for a simple but challenging score attack platformer get it.

I've started trying to play the games for a bit to get some first impressions, and thus started my First-Impression Review series—just a quick look at the first hour/few hours of a game. If you're looking for something more in-depth, look elsewhere.[/i]

Canabalt is, quite obviously, an infinite-running game. From what I've gathered, it was one of the frontrunners of the genre. It is a port from mobile devices to the PC and includes new 3D graphics. 2D graphics are enabled by default, but it's easy to switch back and forth. I found the 2D version easier to play because the boxes have no shadowing, making it easier to determine exactly where they are located and when to jump.

The colour scheme is rather dreary: variations of grey and black and white, all rather monochrome. It is very clean, however. The controls, or rather, control, is as simple as could be, and the game is responsive. This is crucial because it is the core aspect of the game. There is enough variation and randomness in the game/level design to make things interesting. You have windows at varying heights you must jump through, buildings that crumble and start to drop as you land on them, and, of course, boxes to jump over. I was pleased to see that the boxes do not mean instant death but rather slow you down. Although going too slow means you will be unable to jump high enough or far enough to reach the next building, the boxes can be useful if used correctly to slow down slightly.

There are about 7–9 levels, which feature different themes. On one, the buildings are invisible, and one must use the birds perched on the roofs to determine where to run and land. There are no boxes in this mode, thankfully (at least, none that I've encountered). Another level features aliens randomly drilling into buildings, making it so that you have to (very quickly) alter your course to land on the drill bit, in the middle of the building. Another level features a plethora of boxes. The one I found most interesting played with the windows mechanic, requiring more estimation based on your speed to determine when to jump so that you fall enough to break through a window below you.

The randomized elements obviously make it so that no two runs are the same, but, because of this, some runs will be much easier than others. In the end, the ever-increasing speed means that the difference will still be based mostly on skill; however, it could have some effect on the leaderboard, if that's something you're aiming for.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
In the end, this remains a port of a mobile game. The devs did well to price it under $5. This is something I'd purchase on a mobile device for $1, were I interested in such games. Although I don't doubt that fans of this genre would enjoy Cannabalt, I grew tired of it very quickly. I'll note that I did not venture into the multiplayer aspect of this game. 

I received this game as part of a bundle, and I wouldn't recommend it at full price. My short time spent with it gave me an impression of a game done well for its genre but simply not featuring enough content to keep me entertained.

Based on the price I paid, [b]I would recommend this game at $1.00 or less.[/b]",1439602107,1587373913,False,5,0,0.503222227096557617,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's not about the gameplay; the gameplay is fine, and always has been. But I found this port to be rife with technical issues. 

This game is buggy. My [i]god[/i], this game is buggy.

You probably already know what Canabalt is, but if not, it's a very simplistic game where you play as a man running and jumping across rooftops, and the goal is to earn a high score by running as far as possible before inevitably making a mistake and dying. There's only one button used to jump, but you'll have to learn to aim and adjust that jump to hairpin perfection if you want to survive for long. You speed up the longer you run, and you can trip over boxes to slow down. Problem is, if you are running too slow, you won't be able to jump on rising I-beams in time or run across falling buildings, but if you're running too fast, you won't have time to adjust your jump to land on tiny platforms. So it's all about running into boxes when you need to, and maintaining a perfect pace, hoping the game doesn't throw anything too tricky at you. It's a good balance between skill and luck. Otherwise, that's pretty much it; if you're expecting a game with tons of content, this isn't it. But as far as low-investment casual games go, Canabalt is one of the most tried and true.

The graphics are stylish and gritty, and the whole immersive atmosphere of an alien invasion is probably the best part of the game. The Danny Baranowsky track ""RUN!"" is awesome and never seems to get old.

The new PC port adds some slightly better graphics, and extra features that weren't in the original mobile version. There's a new 2-player mode where you try to run alongside a friend, and your scores are added together for your final total. It's fun for a little while, and if your friend abandons you, it's easy enough to play as two players yourself; it's just one extra button, after all. There are also some new challenge modes, most of which are the same game but with some tweaks, like replacing all the random obstacles with one kind of obstacle. And of course, now we have Steamworks features like cloud synch, trading cards, leaderboards, and achievements.

Admittedly, it's much harder on a keyboard than it is on a touch screen to make the tiny tap-jumps which the game will sometimes require for your survival, unless you have very thin keys. Luckily, you can also use the mouse.

So what are my complaints? Well, here are just a few of the issues I ran into:

* The game is not alt+tab friendly at all. After returning from an alt+tab, I've had a wide number of glitches ranging from infinitely looping menus, to disappearing game objects, to soft-locked death screens. 

* The game seems to hang a lot in the middle of the run, notably when kicking boxes. I assume this is due to the game buffering the different box kicking sound effects the first time they are played, but it has ruined many runs for me, especially during co-op.

* After some extended co-op sessions with two actual people, we have concluded that there is a bug which periodically causes one player's controls to make the other player jump, even if they're already in midair, causing an awkward and impossible midair jump. It's not something I noticed when controlling two players myself, but it became very apparent with an actual second player.

* Sometimes when you kick a box, another box somewhere else on the screen will mysteriously get kicked also. This is very apparent while running at high speeds on the ""box tripper"" challenge. This, combined with the ""wrong player control"" issue described above, indicates that there's some kind of pointer / memory corruption happening.

* On more than one occasion, I've restarted a run and all the buildings were gone, and I kept instantly falling to my death. When I tried to quit, the game soft-locked with a white screen.

* The Game Over menu is very lazily implemented. You can't merely press a button to restart the run, but you have to use the arrow keys or the mouse to select the ""restart"" option. The default option on the Game Over menu depends on where your mouse cursor is at the time you died; so if you make sure your mouse cursor is at the bottom-right corner of the screen while playing, then you can hit ""enter"" to restart the run when you die. Otherwise you might open the options or something.

* Kicking a box immediately after coming out of a roll from a high jump will sometimes cause the character's running animation to freeze, making him look like he's skating across the rooftops.

* Very wonky physics at high speeds; on at least two occasions I've jumped straight through solid objects at breakneck speeds, like when playing the ""Panic"" challenge.

* The jump button is the only button you can remap, despite the game menus using several other keys.

Overall, I just don't understand why something so simple as Canabalt can be screwed up and left without so much polish for a proper PC release. I mean, this is [i]not[/i] a complex game; would it really have been that hard not to leave in so many bugs? 

If you just want an occasional run across the rooftops in single player on your PC instead of your phone, this port seems to hold up in that regard -- although you can also just Google ""Canabalt"" and play a web version of it completely for free. I am just disappointed that what was supposed to be a definitive version of a great game is, in the end, just a lazy mobile port. 

Achievement hunters: this is not an easy 100%. Not that there's anything wrong with that from a game design perspective (though some might raise objections that the game expects you to survive for 40,000 meters with so many random luck elements involved), but just don't expect to get the last few achievements unless you're very persistent and dedicated.",1435403542,1435490809,False,156,3,0.783582091331481934,8,False,False,False,False,,,

Without this humble little flash game taking the internet by storm, we would have never seen the creation of Temple Run and other classics (Jetpack Joyride, Rayman Jungle Run, etc). While some people may not care for that style of gaming, there is a simplicity within that makes the game extremely addicting and furiously challenging.

The goal is to simply survive as long as you can. The level is always randomized and will get progressively harder as you stay alive. The speed picks up and new obstacles are thrown at you. You have mere split-seconds to react or die. The simple controls give you enough dominion over your character to make every move; the only thing keeping you back is your reaction time.

That would be about it for a review, but this Steam version includes the updated port that was released on mobile devices a few years back. With that, you get some ""3D"" graphics and a 2-player mode with challenges. The 3D is pointless as the sprite work in the original is gorgeous. There is no need to even bother with the remixed visuals.

As for the 2-player mode, it is a nice touch. I can't say the game is preferable with 2 people, but it certainly is a nice addition for the truly addicted. Challenge mode is where the real thought went. I like how each level is basically a set of stipulations that require you to still react to random levels.

The only problem is that 2-player mode makes a joke of those challenges. As far as completion goes, you just need to reach a set distance and you've finished the challenge. Since 2-player doubles your score (as long as both players are alive), you end up doing each challenge twice as fast.

You can up the ante and play both players by your lonesome. It does make for some intense situations where one player drifts away faster than the other. Your brain has problems reacting to two different objects and the outcome is often fatal. Still, I feel like challenge mode could have been expanded for 2-player.

Either way, this updated port is great. It may be a bit late to the game, but nothing is truly wrong with this version. I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask for some more content with challenge mode, but the rest is basically as good as it has ever been.

The price isn't even bad, either. $3 might seem like a lot, but you will definitely get your moneys worth. If nothing else, the Humble Bundle edition from a few years back came with a Steam key, so you may even own this without knowing.

In a good way though because in all seriousness this is purely a gritty good endless runner with new levels, updated visuals, leaderboards and two player mode. It has 3 great minimalistic music tracks. Used to play it alot when free flash games where still my jam. Back on newgrounds. Arguably just a mobile game, but it origantes on PC. If you got it in a humblebundle Adam (dev) said he will add try to add steam keys. Good stuff.

tl;dr: a good endless indie runner game",1430428287,1430428287,True,9,4,0.486263841390609741,0,True,False,False,False,,,

6 years since the original flash release 'Canabalt' gets a full steam release. With a 3D, a flurry of new game modes and a 2 Player mode, this is the best version of the best flash game ever made.

If you would like a sort of ""trial"" for this game then you can check out the original flash game here: www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/
