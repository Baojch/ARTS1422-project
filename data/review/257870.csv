Mein Eindruck wurde ergebnisoptimiert durch Erwartungsreduktion. Dazu rate ich.
War dann doch besser und länger als befürchtet, jedoch nicht so gut wie Teil 2, obwohl teilweise dann wieder doch.
Für Fans auf jeden Fall ein Muss.

[b]Was ist neu zum Vorgänger?[/b]

Es gibt rote Vasen die nur aufsprengbar sind.
Gefundene Secrets werden also solche angezeigt (und gezählt) und geben neben extra Erfahrung gelegentlich einen zusätzlichen Skill- oder Statpunkt.
Foraging funktioniert nun durch Laufen, nicht mehr durch Schlafen.
Es gibt sehr viele Skillbücher und Trainer, mehr als bisher.
Sehr rätsellastig. Achtung, hütet eure Questitems, auch wenn sie nicht als solche gekennzeichnet sind. Ich musste 2x welche suchen und dachte schon ich bin Game Over. Packt besser alles in Kisten und schreibt euch auf wo diese sind.

[b]Gleich und doch anders[/b]

Die Karte ist sehr interessant. Sehr verschlungen und geheimnisschwanger, mehr noch als bisher. Sie sorgt für fast schon Dark Soulsige Aha- und Oho-Erlebnisse.
Die Entwickler haben sich eindeutig bemüht mit dem Level- und Rätseldesign nochmal alles rauszuholen. Das spielt sich ein wenig anders und hat einige coole Lösungen parat. Allerdings irrt man auch oft irgendwo durch die Gegend ohne richtiges Ziel vor Augen. Viel Aufmerksamkeit haben die Pulverfässer in diesem Teil bekommen.

[b]Auffälliges und Nerviges[/b]

Der Schwierigkeitsgrad scheint gestiegen zu sein. Bald schon treffe ich auf, für mich, unverwundbare Gegner, die ganze Karte ist voll davon und ich kann nur vor ihnen weglaufen. Wird langsam zur Tradition, aber na gut.
Mein Bogen zerbricht nach ungefähr 20 Schuss. Für einen Dungeon muss ich 3x rausgehen, in die Stadt schnellreisen, reparieren (wofür ich nur mit Mühe das Geld zamkratzen kann, indem ich Zeug verkaufe das ich eigentlich selbst brauche), und wieder zurück.
Auch ein bisschen übertrieben. Das nächste Mal nehm ich also Reparieren auf 3 vom Start weg. Ist ja ohne kaum spielbar. Auch die Schuhe latschen durch's (schnell)reisen viel zu schnell aus. Ich ziehe sie deshalb fast immer aus. Nervt dezent.

[b]Schlechter als Book 2?[/b]

Aber es stimmt leider auch was viele Rezensenten sagen. Ich hatte so im ersten Drittel auch nicht immer das beste Gefühl. Der Spielfluß war nicht so gut wie in Book 2. Manche spielens gar in 14 Stunden durch und müssen sich so vor einem abrupten Ende wappnen. Bei mir selbst hats aber 22 gedauert. Das Ende der Story hat mir hingegen ganz gut gefallen.

[b]Erste Gedanken [i](aus dem Tagebuch meines Helden Rick Ranger)[/i][/b]

Kann nicht nach links auf die nächste Karte laufen obwohl da alles frei ist. Magische Barriere? Ich denke eher an einen Bug. Ich laufe zurück und will nach Norden, aber da wo der schwarze Rand des Ungewissen beginnt ist plötzlich jeder Meter mit Slimes gefüllt die da nicht hingehören und nicht angreifbar sind. Na das ist aber eindeutig ein Fehler in der Matrix! Nach dem Zeit zurückdehen gehts wieder. Die Angst vor Bugs sitzt ab jetzt im Nacken (kamen aber keine mehr).

Eine Bekannte hat mir eben erzählt sie weiß von meinem Schicksal und der Aufgabe der Crux. Sie weiß ich halte das Schicksal von Eschalon in den Händen und gibt mir diesbezüglich wichtige Informationen. Kurz darauf ist sie pissed weil ich eine Perle aus einer Muschel vom Strand genommen habe, die ihr zwar nicht mal gehört, aber so ein schlimmes Verbrechen kann sie nicht ertragen, dass ihr Held sich einfach Perlen luchst. Als ich sie wieder sehe haut sie mir eine ins Maul und will mich umbringen! Come on, really?

While I loved Eschalon Book I and II in every respect, Book III felt a bit rushed and I found the ending to be anticlimatic and very sudden.
Nevertheless it's still Eschalon and I enjoyed playing it very much to the point that I neglected household chores for 2 days.. 
If you liked Book I and II you cannot go wrong in buying Book III just for the sake of completing the series but I recommend to buy it on sale.

The cons:
- much much more walking than in Book I and II, however it becomes doable with more short-travel markers activated, but hey, sometimes you circle an area for 3 screens just to get to a tiny point in e.g. the north of the area :-/
- rushed anticlimatic ending
- it took me a bit to figure out which area to clear first or which quests to do first because ALL enemies were too strong in the beginning
- I sold an important item I found twice but you need it to progress the story(that wasn't clear at first), thank God I found another one or I had to start a new game D-: That should have been made more clear in the game that one mustn't sell the [spoiler] Sigil of Fire ring[/spoiler] e.g. by letting all merchants say that they are not interested in buying it. 

The pros:
- cute monsters and great lore like in all Eschalon games
- the music (my cat liked the calming music very much)
- the battles were fun as in Book I and II, I simply like the battle system
- although the ending was rushed I enjoyed the final battle very much, I saved all my gold for this nice super strong mauling hammer and crushing my enemies with it was so much fun and very effective!!
- the landscapes and dungeons were interesting
- an interesting point:  in Book 1 I remember the noximanders to be a huge pain and quite a challenge for me because I got poisoned or sick like every three seconds, in this part however beware of the swampy areas, save everytime before you want to walk through a swamp, the swamps are this game's noximanders :-D

The game never had a truly in depth story, but neither do games like Baldur's Gate (more characters than story in my opinion), Avernum, Diablo, etc. I think this games strong point was the character building system (even if it was far more simple then it lends you to believe), and the art/assets/sprites. I've played bigger games (looking at you Wasteland), where the character portraits were obvious palette swaps, which does not happen with this game. I also appreciated that pieces of armor actually changed your sprite. I really did like the overall look of it, and even though some skills seemed pretty useless or like they had minimal impact, I had fun roleplaying my self inflicted amnesiac that could colour in a very basic map.

That it was too short, that the story was rushed, the map was smaller than book 2 , etc.

However I want to focus on the aspect that game mechanics wise this was very refined, loot was plentiful and varried, a lot more store clerks to trade with, while we didn't get a lot of varriation in biomes it was a fun Island adventure.

Only gripe with Book 3 is how ramped up the difficulty was and how it was never really a sure way to know where you were supposed to go and what to do.

But nonetheless I am happy to have finished something that started with a demo in 2008

Ah, Eschalon, I see your denizens have grown wise to my formerly lucrative paladin schemes of ""turning mana into cold hard cash"" in Book II by creating stacks of delicious food and selling it all. Not to say that my mercantile skills went to waste this time. Or that surviving primarily on what I envision as cricket oatmeal was a bad idea. In fact, trivializing finding food and water via spellcasting made everything run smoother and I preferred it to relying on foraging.

Zakończenie przychodzi nagle, kiedy ma się ochotę jeszcze trochę pograć. Zmian w mechanice prawie nie ma. Zauważalną zmianą jest inaczej potraktowana umiejętność przeszukiwania. Od teraz składniki alchemiczne otrzymujemy w czasie przemierzania świata gry, a nie podczas odpoczynku, jak to miało miejsce w 2 części. Zasobów tych otrzymujemy teraz znacznie mniej, a to w połączeniu z mniejszą dostępnością składników u sprzedawców sprawia, że mamy również mniej mikstur. Czy wpływa to na trudność gry? Chyba tak, ale mimo to gra nie jest zbyt trudna.
Ogólnie, mimo krótszego czasu rozgrywki oceniam tę część podobnie jak poprzednie. Ma na to wpływ ciekawsza moim zdaniem fabuła, której finał, mimo że przychodzi zbyt szybko, jest satysfakcjonujący. Twórcy obronili swoje dziwne pomysły z końcówki 2 części - ich rozwiązanie spodobało mi się. W zakończeniu zabrakło ukazania dalszych losów świata, ale może twórcy powrócą jeszcze kiedyś do tego uniwersum i przedstawią jego przyszłość, na co liczę.

Eschalon: Book III is the worst of the series. It's the shortest, and doesn't innovate or improve in any way upon the second installment.

Although there is a fast travel mechanic, backtracking is a dreadful experience since the enemies don't appear to respawn (by design, I imagine, since if they did you'd become too powerful).

Nevertheless the series was charming enough that I felt compelled to finish Book III, and I enjoyed it for much the same reasons I enjoyed Books I and II, as a sort of respite between denser RPGs.

The structure was completely reshaped, to the point of making it even surprising. The writing of the main plot is still an issue (though not as much as in the previous games) and the slow, turn-based combat with awkward survival elements still may ruin this game for some, but it's crucial to understand that Eschalon III takes some new directions and tries to change some of the trilogy's shortcomings.

First of all, it's no more an open-world game. You won't find here two-hour dungeons that you can, but don't have to play through or vast fields of empty nothingness to ""explore"". Instead, you basically need to follow the game's story to achieve major parts of the map and even though you have some freedom in your progression, every area is connected with the main story and you basically have to go everywhere to find some keys or other essential items.

Various maps are also connected with each other much better and you spend much less time on pointless walking or grinding XP on roaming mobs. Instead, there's a lot of fun related to getting to some hidden areas, looking for treasures or getting to know some interesting places which either have nice, even creative backstories or are just fun eye-candies that allow you to use your imagination. For some reason, developer really likes his ""black powder kegs"" and you have dozens of moments when you can or have to blow up some walls, palisades or fences. It can be pretty fun.

Also, for the first time I actually found the battles challenging. In Eschalon I I was a ranger, in Eschalon II a sorcerer, and now, playing as a melee warrior, I struggled a lot getting through some areas. Maybe melees are below the power curve, or maybe the game is way easier if you focus on keeping your distance from the mostly-melee enemies. 

The money matters much more, while the items became more rare and the equipment management is now more convenient and not pointless. A big plus.

Generally speaking - the game is different enough to stay fresh, while it's also much better structured, you could even say ""orchestrated"", what could scare some people away.

All'epoca infatti era raro che venissero fornite più di poche e generiche indicazioni sul come  procedere e il giocatore doveva sostanzialmente reperire le informazioni/indicazioni necessarie da solo, usando l'inventiva, i dialoghi, l'esplorazione e una bella dose di fortuna. I giochi della serie Eschalon ci  riportano a quei bei tempi andati in cui  l'obiettivo di una quest non compariva da solo sulla mappa ma era necessario andarselo a cercare, spesso sudando le proverbiali sette camice.

Eschalon: Book 3 (E:B3) e' il terzo ed ultimo capitolo di una serie di CRPG creati a partire dal 2007 da Basilisk Games, una piccola software house Indie americana e che ha riscosso un ottimo successo sia di critica che di pubblico. Per descrivere la Trama di Eschalon devo necessariamente partire dall'inizio del primo capitolo, dove il nostro eroe si risveglia in un piccolo cottage privo di qualsiasi ricordo della sua vita. Una misteriosa nota lo informerà che questa amnesia e' stata indotta magicamente per proteggerlo da un pericolo mortale legato al suo passato e gli indicherà il primo passo per recuperare la sua memoria. La storia di E:B3 riparte la dove era stata lasciata alla fine del secondo capitolo, con il nostro eroe che dopo essere stato colpito da un incantesimo durante lo scontro con il cattivo del gioco si risveglia con la Crux of Fire (una potente gemma magica) e il compito di scoprirne i poteri.

Come tutti i capitoli della serie E:B3 e' fortemente ispirato a titoli come Ultima 6 e Ultima 7 ed in generale i titoli della stessa epoca dei due capolavori di Origin Systems. Tutto il sistema di gioco e' gestito a turni, non solo il combattimento: per rendersene conto basta non fare nulla ed osservare che il mondo attorno a noi (NPC, mostri etc) rimane perfettamente immobile, per ritornare ad animarsi ogni volta che noi compiamo una azione. Il Ruleset e' custom, ma molto simile al buon vecchio D20: In Eschalon le capacità del nostro alter ego virtuale hanno un ruolo fondamentale: ad esempio, la quantità di dettagli mostrati nella mini-mappa della interfaccia di gioco dipende da quanti punti avremo investito nella skill Cartografia e nel caso che non ne sia stato assegnato nessuno la mappa rimarrà vuota. Allo stesso modo, la nostra capacità di colpire qualcosa a distanza con un arco dipenderà dai punti skill assegnati all'uso di tale arma. Come standard, il gioco richiederà al nostro eroe di mangiare e bere, inoltre il nostro equipaggiamento si deteriorerà con l'uso e avrà quindi bisogno di riparazioni.

Il mondo di gioco e' composto da macro aree collegate tra di loro, con ciclo notte e giorno e condizioni atmosferiche variabili. L'esplorazione del territorio circostante, sia esso una landa selvaggia o l'interno di un dungeon, e' una delle componenti fondamentali del gioco. che nel corso della partita ci costringerà a lunghe scarpinate per raggiungere le varie località sulla mappa. Esiste anche un sistema di viaggio veloce, ma per attivare le destinazioni dovremo prima scoprirle ed attivare il Geo-Marker relativo. Il viaggio veloce semplifica un poco la vita, ma il gioco farà in modo di farci camminare parecchio, anche perché alcuni degli oggetti necessari al completamento di alcune quest (specie quelle del finale) si trovano solo esplorando a fondo luoghi che non sempre sono toccati da quest precedenti.

Gli scontri con i nemici sono abbastanza ostici, specie nelle prime ore di gioco, quando il nostro equipaggiamento e le nostre capacità sono scarsi. Inoltre gli avversari che si incontrano non sono ""livellati"" in base al nostro personaggio e fare l'incontro sbagliato può portare al Game-Over molto velocemente. Va anche detto che la durata non e' lunghissima: le quest, tra principali e secondarie sono meno di 30 e ciò, unito al fatto che non c'è respawn dei nemici, pone un limite al numero di livelli che potremo salire. Ne consegue che E:B3, come i suoi due predecessori, non e' un gioco facile e può risultare molto frustrante.

La realizzazione tecnica del gioco e' estremamente semplice e spartana, a partire dal fatto che la risoluzione video e' fissa ed inalterabile a 1024x768x32bpp sia in modalità a finestra che a schermo intero, con l'interfaccia grafica che prende una buona parte di questa area. L'engine di gioco e' sostanzialmente 2D Tile based con visuale isometrica. Non quindi aspettatevi animazioni super fluide e mirabolanti effetti speciali: come ho già detto, la resa grafica del gioco e' molto semplice ma tutto sommato molto gradevole.

Eschalon: Book 3 e' un gioco per molti, ma non per tutti: pur non essendo un gioco difficile, il suo gameplay dal gusto retro' può mettere in seria difficoltà chi non e' abituato a dover fare praticamente tutto da solo senza grossi aiuti da parte del gioco stesso. Detto questo pero' e' uno splendido CRPG che sa dare grandissime soddisfazioni a tutti coloro che amano applicarsi a fondo. Per chi non conoscesse ancora la serie, il primo episodio e' stato reso gratuito nel decennale dell'uscita (lo potete trovare su Steam o sul sito di Basilisk), mentre secondo e terzo episodio vengono via per l'equivalente di un Cinema + popcorn per una persona.

Le loot est toujours aléatoire dans les coffres, donc c'est toujours de la merde.

Can you help me? i tried to find the ""climatic ending"" but i just cant find it, i guess im stuck with the game, or i did something wrong because all i got was anticlimatic and disappointing ending. i tried both endings but oh wait, it didnt even matter which side you choose! Holy fuck i was angry when i finished the game.

I was huge fan of the game serie, waited the 3rd one so long...
If you are fan like me, sure you must buy it, but its far from satisfying ending.

This is not an ""old school"" RPG (I've been playing hardcore RPGs since Ultima 3), it's just a bad one. I'm 4 hours in and I have no plan on continuing. I'd return it but it was a gift so I'm stuck with it. But it will go unplayed. Why?

1. The enemies around all seem to be much more difficult, meaning that every battle is a save-and-restore situation. The ones in the Seawardens' Guild? Too tough. The goblins? Too tough. The ones across the water on the raft? Too tough. The ones on the way to Moonstone? Too tough. I'm sorry that I didn't know exactly what was required in the character creation so that I could make progress in the game but I find it absurd that you have to min/max at the character creation step just to get a few hours in the game. I don't want to quicksave before every battle and quick restore when it doesn't go well. That's not playing the game and that's not hardcore either. It's just a bad design.


2. I have 1 gold piece. That's it. Why? I don't know. I had a couple of hundred in a prior save. When I went to load the game I now have 1. Which means I can't identify anything to sell. I can't buy potions. I can't buy food. That tends to limit your options and in a game where I have to consume food to live, I'm on a downhill spiral that will eventually lead me to starving to death. I'd use a cheat or a trainer to fix this, but there doesn't seem to be any out there. 

I suppose I could go back to town and rob everyone and everything I can for some gold. But that's not role-playing in the least. It's not something I'm willing to do to fix a bug in the game.

3. Something similar happened with making potions. I went to make a healing potion per the recipe. Success! Great! Then I went to make two others. The ingredients are gone but the potions were never made. Did the potion making somehow fail? There was nothing in the log about it. So again, I'm out ingredients and can't seem to successfully make a healing potion. Bug or working as intended? No idea.

There are literally dozens of RPGs out there to choose from. I don't need to put up with an imbalanced, buggy game. The Geneforge series is far superior and if I'm going to spend time palying an old-school game, I'll play the better one. 

PS - I tried Eschalon 2 and now recall after about 15 hours it too bugged out and I lost about 4 hours of gameplay. The dev asked me to send him the save file. I did but never even received the courtesy of a reply. That's two games that I've had in this series and both ended up entirely bugging out with nary a response from the dev.

Compared to the previous books, the difficulty seemed to raise steeply. That might be related to my choice of playing Book III with a thief (in an assassin style). However, from what I've read, it seems that a thief is the worst choice for this part, and you'll have the hardest time with it. The game seems very unbalanced in this respect. For example, there are almost no good piercing weapons in the game. Very early in the start you'll meet enemies immune to piercing damage including arrows. Bashing them with my hands didn't really work well... Also, there's no backstabbing, so the thief can leverage being hidden in shadows just in a very specific circumstances. And the list goes on.

The last quarter of the game seemed to be created in a rush and quite empty. Maybe the developer has run out of money. But it felt weird and somewhat unfinished.

So I recommend it when buying the complete series, but if you are only interested in a good RPG, buy book 1 and/or 2. If you want to buy only one, take book 2 because it's just as good or even better as book 1 but has improved graphics.

Eschalon: Book III Feels like a Rogue Like Ultima VII game

Run 1:
An Archer
I get until map 3 where murderous fly was immune to my arrows

Run 2:
An Archer with Weapon Bludgeoning for the murderous fly's
I die of having worms

Run 3:
Arcane, Elemental and Arcane Divinanation and Cartography
I realize I need to focus my Skill points on 1 attack Skill

Run 4:
Arcane, Elemental and Cartography
It took 16 hour Camping to regenerate the mana

Run 5:
Arcane, Elemental Meditation and Cartography
I know now where I can POWER Level
I was quite successful until I run out of food, No more food in the whole world

Run 6:
Arcane, Elemental Width Foraging and Spot Hidden and No Cartography
This character was quit weak int the beginning, but he still alive!
Totally hard without Cartography
I learn I can rent a room to restore my character HP, Mana, Food and Thirst
So I think this character might have a chance!

Eschalon: Book III has much of it's gameplay from Ultima VII
I buy allot of RPG game on Steam but no one come close to Eschalon: Book III in feeling..
I am going to try add Eschalon: Book I and II to my Steam Library some day

Pro:
Real Quest, Not like kill 7 slimes OR get 25 shoes from dead horses
Teleport
Don't need Mouse
Good sound
Feel little like Fallout 2 and Ultima VII

Con:
Slow walking, little better in OpenGL
Not a open world map, it's all about zones
Very hard game need to restart from the beginning many time to do it right
The Story don't feel authentic when I need to restart over and over

Eschalon: Book 3 represents a good and solid turn-based RPG that provides the same gameplay as the last two parts with slight changes in form of a broader spectrum of weapons (finally some unarmed weapons!), more skill trainers, and a change in the support function of certain attributes, e.g. speed vs traps.

On the other hand the entire game feels less refined. Most locations have only a few enemies, and the overall difficulty has been reduced, resulting in a less challenging environment. In addition the unfavourable map layout invokes the feeling of unnecessarily prolonging the game by restricting access to certain level sections.

Book III falls on its face in comparison. The terrain and dungeons feel simplistic.

It setup a general adventure management linking exploration, resources and items, character building, combats, NPC and quests. Beside the character building which is rather good overall, and exploration quality even better in Book 3, no other points are strong but the whole is glued and setup a consistent gameplay of adventuring in a world.

The adventure simulation is quite well developed in the gameplay, and this is very rare in RPG of past 15 years. This includes many elements like map making, alchemy, crafting, attrition and repair, ailments and curing, inventory management with limits to manage, food and drink management, implementation of darkness/light/day/night/weather condition, and more. This also includes a rather good stealth system with influences on combats, stealthy exploration, and in each book there's many opportunities to steal even the good people if that's your choice.

But it's NOT a RPG/series to buy for combats depth, nor for its main story or writing quality. Also take care that it can be quite short as all Books if you use a character enough OP and rush through the game. Even played more normally and by enjoying exploring and digging the places and secrets, it's not a game with a duration as the classics AAA RPG, or as some very rare indie RPG as Avernum.

Overall it's a great game, the best Book of the series, for the exploration quality, secrets, tricks to find, puzzles, and for the difficulty balance of secrets/puzzles/tricks. It has also the best density of stuff to do, i.e. no or very few empty areas (more or less desert areas without much to do), and no or very few fillers (abuse of repetitions and emptiness). And this Book 3 has also the best graphics which help somehow for building the secrets and mildly hidden stuff. But it isn't the best of the series for the size, it is second after Book 2. Nor for story and the Book 1 has the lead but quote that the writing quality is average in this series. Nor for combats despite few good combats setup, Book 2 has the lead on that, but again combats aren't very deep in that series and are more a part of the whole adventure and world simulation.

The Book 3 is also the Book of the series which is structured for mods and with mods tools, a feature requested by fans since Book 1 and finally available in Book 3.

There are demo for each book so try them to get an idea, and even if the Book 1 is a bit harsh, with few forum/guide help it will be an excellent choice to discover the series due to its low price and general quality that doesn't deserve the later books despite they brought various improvements.",1393074365,1393080933,True,4,1,0.419513940811157227,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It was a little tough for me at first, to find a class/skills that I wanted to play with at the beginning, and I ended up rotating through about 5-10 different rolls before I found a character that I liked. Luckily, this game doesn't punish you if you make bad decisions early in the game (except for getting caught stealing something), as skill trainers open up as you complete quests. I found this a lot more enjoyable than the other books in the series because I wasn't *forced* to powergame in order to enjoy all of the aspects the game had to offer. I found the quests to be quite intriguing, and exploration gave you a lot to do, and actually rewards you for doing it this time (with experience, and a damn satisfying sound). 

The only issues that I have with this, is that sometimes you'll encounter 'message overload' when you take on some of the challenge rules. For instance, if you try to save when there are enemies around, you'll get 5-10 messages saying the same thing, that you're violating the rule.

I must say I'm really sad to write this. I had huge hopes for this game, as I'm a big fan of the previous two games. I mean, they both harken to the days of yore when I just didn't care about certain things. I just rolled with it, despite the flaws. This game hugely relies on that nostalgia.

But now... I can't deny the flaws this game has. And more importantly, it just isn't FUN. No seriously, this is a game right? But I was just frustrated to no end.

The journey begins with a spreadsheet. Yes its styled like an old paper n' pen RPG, but there's so much pointless skills. You spend an hour just trying to decide what will be good and what will be pointless. I restarted the beginning like 3 times trying to figure out what I wasted my points in. Seriously, sometimes, LESS IS MORE. It was just a headache, seriously. In the town you arrive in, to add insult to injury, NO TRAINERS. ARE YOU SERIOUS? 

Oh well, nevermind, you arrive in the town, then you have the usual pointless conversations. You are in the middle of nowhere : check. Is there anything interesting, nope? : check. Can't loot anything because your hide in shadows skill is useless : check. Get the town angry because you got curious : check. Can't save because you chose hardcore mode : check. Force quit the game because you fucked up : check. And you've got no idea where to go : check. Except, of course, you get a quest to kill bugs.

And more bugs. Man, those bugs are annoying. The last straw was when my build, a ranger was unnable to EVEN DAMAGE the... swarm things. They're immune to arrows? What the fuck?!? I instantly got swarmed by like 10 of the invincible dots. And this was ONE SCREEN away from the first town. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST AREA OF THE DAMN GAME? WHAT IS THIS DIFFICULTY CURVE?!?!

Then I built a mage build. I then promptly got diseased with the first step I took in the swamp, reducing my endurance and strenght by half. Permenantly. I killed most of the bugs I saw, then ran out of mana, then I was forced to fight with my fists. With no combat skill. With half strenght. Then I tried resting at an inn. Afterwards I was still ill.

Okay. This is the last straw.

It pains me to say, but this game is just an exercise in patience. A total waste of 18 bucks. I should of bought it during a sale. 5 bucks would of been reasonable.

I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME, SO STOP DELIBERATLY SABOTAGING MY EXPERIENCE!!! I want to have fun, not give myself a damn headache.

Last word : If you're a huge fan of the series, you might still enjoy this. In my case though, it seems like they just took Book II and made it less good. If you're new to the series, I recommend just playing the first two games, the second being far superior. I don't understand how they could mess this up so bad. 

Oh and before you blame me for not giving the game a chance. I did. Twice. And the most important part of a game, any game, is the first 15 minutes. The game did nothing to grip my attention. Worse, it was complicated, unfair and boring. On the plus side, the music was excellent! What epic music to play while you kill roaches. The interface is very well done too.

I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fan of the series and I was patiently waiting for 3 years for this game. Checking the website regularly to see if there were any updates. I've played both Book I and Book II multiple times with different builds and playstyles. I love both of those games to bits. Now after 3 years, what we got was a short and disappointing ending to the trilogy.

I really hate to say this, but Eschalon: Book III is the worst part of the trilogy and very unsatisfying in almost every aspect. Not only is it by far the shortest of the three games (took me around 13 hours where at least 4 hours was aimless wandering, trying to find obscure clues for obscure quests.) but it also has the worst world design of the whole trilogy. Around 50% of the world is swamps and all the roads and passes are infuriatingly designed where every convenient way is blocked, making it a huge pain to get around if you're going for the no fast travel challenge. This was not the case in Book II. I'm not sure if I'm just so used to the Eschalon ruleset, but the game was also extremely easy and only after around halfway the game started throwing at least some challenge.

In the end, it's still Eschalon. It's still fun for what it is. But I really really hate to see the series end like this. *sigh* I'm going to put a thumb down just to balance things out, but honestly I don't know if I'd recommend it or not.

If you've played the other two and liked them, than obviously this is a no brainer.  It has some new updates here and there, but overall is the same gameplay as the last two.  I havent gotten into the story so I cant comment on that.  The few hours Ive played thus far have been doing the first towns side quests, and now heading off to continue the main plot I got side tracked with this ship wreck mystery.  No clue what to expect, and thats why I love these games!

So as I said, this review isnt for veterans of the series, because youll be buying this regardless.  This is for those people that like modern rpgs, and have started dabbling into fallout and arcanum etc and need more.  Thats how I found this series.  I hated Baldurs gate and similar rpgs, but love ones I could take my time with and had full control of every action.  If any of that rings a bell in your head check out these games.

There is a demo available for all 3 in the series at the owners site, and I highly recommend trying that first if your not sure. Or just pick up the trilogy pack while its on sale. Each game can be played seperatly without knowledge of another.  Id recommend starting with the first game and working my way up. Only because youll obviously get the full story, and because of the slight improvments made in the gameplay and mechanics.  Youll get used to the new features of say 2, and decide to play 1 and miss them and the game will feel limited due to that.  I played them out of order(2 and then 1) so its really not a big deal in the end, but you will be saying wtf why isnt this here or that option there?

So in conclusion, this is a truly old school aproach to rpgs.  If your excited for the new turn based rpgs from kickstarter etc, then look no further for a game to play while you wait for those.  While those guys were making modern day turds before going to kickstarter, this guy here was keeping the rpg tradition alive and well.  Show your love and throw the dude some cash!!   (Hes working on a scifi game next I believe.  New engine etc, so it should be fun)
