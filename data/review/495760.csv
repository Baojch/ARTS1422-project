it's not a game about tight mechanics or a compelling story, it's just (""just"") a cool weird place to hang out for 2 hours and then be done with. i think that's part of why i like it so much; you can play all the way through in one sitting and then go away and think about it, instead of it requiring you to invest huge amounts of time and energy just to get to the good bits.
it's full of all kinds of strange and incongruous features, which feel more like ruins of an old and decaying world than shallow attempts at ""gameplay"", and i find myself thinking more about the way the waves crash against the rocks, or the tinkling pinwheels which seem as much a natural part of the world as the plants that twang and judder as you pass by, than i do about any of the vestigial curios.

Exploration and progression in general are fairly aimless though actually directed in a way that isn't initially apparent. I think fans of exploration and discovery such as myself will find this game quite enjoyable.

In a nutshell, this game is an artistic platformer that has ""idle clicker element"" to it. Also, you can open the command console by pressing F12 & G to change the world around you, and it allows you to do a few other neat things - like changing the cape color (although you can break the game doing so). It kind of reminds me of [i] Mu Cartographer [/i] because it's unlike anything that I ever played. Its ambient soundtrack and oozing atmosphere create a very immersive world that is so hard to explain. If you enjoy weird exploration games, I would definitely recommend giving it a chance.

[h1] This part of the ""review"" is a basic tutorial if you are interested: [/h1]

(WASD) - movement
(ESC) - save & Load
(F12) - console, might wanna disable screenshots
(G) - has some cool settings that could break the game
(I) - Idle clicker game (buy things)

When you start the game, follow the instruction on the screen by pressing the listed keyboard keys. Eventually, you will make it to the gameplay portion which is a platformer that uses WASD for movement. First of all, press F12 and type ""fullscreen"" & ""baralpha 0"", that should make the game easier on the eyes (press F12 again to close it). By pressing ESC you can save and load the game by following instructions on the screen. Shortly after you start, the gate will block your way. This game has ""idle clicker element"", so you have to make money to interact with objects. Press (I) and buy some mines to generate income. That should be it. As far as I can tell (G)-menu is mostly for aesthetics and you don't need it to play the game. But if you going to play with settings, make sure you save first because it will break the game sooner or later.

I can't give a good estimation for how long it takes to fully explore due to being uncertain how many secret areas there are or how large they are, but I got to the credits room after a bit over two hours of play.

I felt a little disappointed by how limited the corruption ability turned out to be, since only two or three of the options are actually useful due to how collision works and how catastrophic the Distort Area function is.  The useful functions are pretty useful though.  The ability to save your state whenever you want almost completely counteracts any control issues the game has, and I got pretty used to the way the character moves.  Just watch out for the ball puzzles- a couple of them are better left ignored or circumvented via glitching.

It looks busy at times, yet the gameplay is very zen. It has an 80s/early 90s design aesthetic, yet it's unmistakably modern, in no small part due to its abstract and mysterious cyberpunk-occultish setting, top-notch graphics and audio work, and the total confusion you experience every second you're playing it.

Although the game is certainly confusing, it's not particularly difficult. Obstacles include puzzles where you spam jump, move a ball or turn knobs, and gates which you unlock using currency (DeityCoin) that you find in the world or gain from the incremental mini-game. You can try cheesing your way through obstacles with the game corrupter, but it by no means gives you a significant advantage, as you have limited control over the effects, remaining airborne for 2 seconds respawns you, and you can't move if you're stuck in something.

+ Super interesting lore
+ Fantastic art style
+ Incredible sound design
~ Really floaty horizontal controls, although this is somewhat offset by the game corrupter
- A bit on the short side
- Incremental game seems to be more of a novelty than anything else (although maybe BARCHboi is trying to make a statement?)
- Going into fullscreen (which really improves the immersion imo) messes up the cursor and opening the console to do so takes a screenshot since it's bound to F12

Perhaps the meaning behind the game is to invoke that sense of mystery, that sense of that there is a secret hidden deep within this game that you are supposed to find. Maybe that secret exists only within yourself. 

Maybe I'm just stupid.

I've finished the game, or at least as close as ""finding the end screen,"" allows it and while I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys experimental indie games, there are a couple of things that might turn people off. I think most can get past the cryptic elements of the story and just take the game as a whole work but there is one thing that cannot be overstated: the controls.

BARCHboi, I love your music. I love your aesthetic designs. I bought Deios and ended up buying the USB of this game AND a copy on Steam (because I honestly thought that I was missing files, you sneaky dev.) The general wonder of Deios, DeityNet, and DEIDIA keeps me coming back for more but my man, these controls actually *hurt* my wrist. They are floaty and imprecise, and the wall jumping can sometimes just come down to mashing. You've built it into the game well enough but when it gets to the point where I have to strain my wrists in order to get through some parts, it ain't working.

Regardless of that, BARCHboi has created something utterly unique. Depending on how much you spoil yourself you might not stay very long but just the work that went into the visuals is something else. The music isn't anything to scoff at either, this guy makes bangin' tunes. I hope to see more of his work coming on Steam.",1488505059,1488505059,True,25,0,0.735827326774597168,0,True,False,False,False,,,
