Only 5 of them are currently on Steam.
Being first released in 2011, this game really shows its age in its graphics and game play.  If you like lists of items to find in every new scene, this is for you.  HO scenes are very jumbled and items are quite challenging to find at times, especially when the scenes are darker than the rest of the game.  I used a magnifying glass a lot!!
You are a princess and have been hidden away by your nurse.  When you were a baby, a dark sorceress took over your castle, turning most residents and objects into amber.  Now an adult, it is time for you to return and claim your kingdom and restore everything to its rightful order.  Story was believable and flowed well.  There was a nice twist at the end (which I saw coming!)  The game is very linear, so you can't wander off to explore or get lost.
There is no map, so a fair bit of backtracking, no instant transport, no collectables to find and no Steam achievements.  The latter means no penalties in using the hint button.  There is no hand holding in this game because the hint button reloads very slowly!  When the hint is used in a scene, it just says ""nothing to do in this area"".   So you have to be in the right scene for it to be any help.  Mini games were quite easy.
Music only had 4 themes, so became a little repetitive.  Voice acting was minimal, but good.  No glitches at all.  I have a widescreen laptop and that was accommodated well.  
Main game was 4.5 hrs and 30 minutes for bonus game.  So quite short for it's price.  The game after this one ""Song of the Phoenix"" was much better, but this introduces the characters for the rest of the series.
I found it interesting to see how HO games have evolved over the past 10 years.  Not all changes have been for the better.
Recommend.  A good game for those new to the genre.  6.5/10

It doesn't support widescreen, there is no map, and the HO scenes are made up of many jumbled objects (although always objects that fit the scene).  There are no achievements, and thus no penalties for using hints when you need them.  Despite what may appear to be a list of negatives, this is a well-constructed game with nice visuals, and I have no hesitation recommending it to those who enjoy HO scenes.  In fact, if you enjoy word lists and more old-style HOPA games, you may enjoy Amber Maiden more than more recent games.

[b]Overall:[/b] An enjoyable game despite the lack of fancy options, collectibles, or map.  It's old-school, but has lots of game play and looks nice enough since there is no attempt to force it into a wide screen setting.  Buy it on sale and relax!

Pros:
- lots of HO scenes
- a reasonable number of puzzles (mostly easy, a few more challenging)
- no glitches (running in Windows 10)
- bonus chapter (short, but adds new HO scenes and locations)
- basic story that provides a coherent vehicle for a straightforward HO game with nice art and locations
- music is slightly repetitive, but not bad
- voice acting is limited but generally decent

Cons:
- no map, no collectibles, no variety in HO scenes (word lists with 2-3 concealed objects)
- very basic, linear story (but it flowed well, and the various locations fit together)
- no widescreen
- resolution for HO scenes is moderate",1605487963,1605487996,True,4,0,0.592203915119171143,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Like almost all of them, they are WAY too short for the price, but this one was at least longer than some.

It does not have a map, though it is not designed for it, so it didn't bother me. However, the hint system was less sophisticated than for later games. Still, it's a good game. Better than some of the newer HOGs as for as originality, story, fun mini-puzzles and the like.",1589941079,1589941079,True,2,0,0.538858473300933838,0,True,False,False,False,,,
