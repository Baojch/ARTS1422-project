Bei Trollskog handelt es sich um ein klassisches Aufbaustrategie Spiel. Wie üblich errichtet man eine Siedlung, baut Rohstoffe ab und kämpft gegen feindliche Einheiten. Das Spiel befindet sich noch in einem frühen Entwicklungsstadium und enthält entsprechend noch nicht alle Funktionen.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Zu Beginn des Spiels gilt es ein erstes Dorfzentrum zu errichten. Dabei behilflich ist ein weißer Vogel, dieser vergibt erste Missionen, welche als Tutorial verstanden werden können. Für das Erfüllen dieser Mission erhält man ein paar Goldmünzen welche unseren Reichtum mehren und für Rohstoffe ausgegeben werden können.

Nachdem Basisrohstoffe wie Holz und Lebensmittel abgebaut wurden, kann, dass Dorfzentrum mit weiteren Gebäuden erweitert werden. Wohnhäuser ermöglichen nicht nur das Ausbilden weiterer Arbeiter. Vielmehr sind sie notwendig, weil nur Wohnhäuser mit Äckern erweitert werden können. Es reicht allerdings nicht aus auszuwählen was denn angebaut werden soll, auch muss immer mindestens ein Arbeiter zugewiesen werden.

Schon nach kurzer Zeit können z.B. Seile hergestellt werden. Dies schaltet die zweite Gebäudestufe frei, bestehende Gebäude können entsprechend aufgewertet werden. Dies verändert nicht nur die Optik, auch kann z.B. das Wohnhaus um ein zweites Feld erweitert werden.

Nun wird es langsam Zeit, Kämpfer auszubilden und dem Vogel, vom Anfang des Spiels, in den Wald zu folgen. Dort angekommen gilt es eine Silbererzmine zu erobern und sogleich ein weiteres Dorfzentrum zu errichten. So erweitert man, mit Hilfe von Siedlern, sein kleines Mittelalterreich immer weiter. Auf der Karte trifft man auf weitere Questgeber und muss so diverse Aufgaben erfüllen.

Musik und Sound sind ausrreichend und passen gut zum Setting des Spiels, Wunder darf man allerdings nicht erwarten.[/list]

Die Grafik ist ausreichend und Übersichtlich. Die Spielwelt könnte lebendiger wirken, im Dorf bewegt sich aber immer etwas.[/list]

Für Fans des Genres ist Trollskog auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert. Alle anderen sollten sich vor dem Kauf ein paar Videos anschauen![/list]

[h1]Fazit[/h1]

Bisher bietet Trollskog nicht genug Inhalt, um seinen Preis zu rechtfertigen. Kommen aber noch die versprochenen Inhalte hinzu dürfte es sich um ein solides Spiel mit einem guten Preisleistungsverhältnis handeln. Dies, in Verbindung mit dem bisher gebotenen, ist der Grund für meine positive Bewertung!

[h1]Kleiner Tipp[/h1]

Um Kämpfer ausbilden zu können, müssen die entsprechenden Waffen zuerst gebaut werden. Solltet ihr nur fünf Kämpfer brauchen, braucht ihr keine Rohstoffe verschwenden, um mehr herzustellen. Gefällte Bäume wachsen, zumindest bisher, nicht nach. Beachtet auch, dass ihr einen Arbeiter anweisen müsst einen Ochsen ""an sich zu nehmen"" um einen Siedler verwenden zu können.

[*][b]Version: 0.8.0.9[/b][/list]
Anfangs gab es Probleme mit der Wegfindung bei der Ausbildung von Kämpfern. Dieses Problem wurde behoben, weitere Bugs sind mir nicht aufgefallen. Trollskog lief insgesamt flüssig und ohne Abstürze.

I'd recommend this as an investment toward something that looks like it will be promising. Personally I see strong elements of Age of Empires.

Development looks promising, and the small fix updates are a sign of good development to me as a software developer. I'd rather even see that something is taking longer than expected than nothing at all for 10 months.

My only primary qualm with the game (aside from the expected bugs) would be that something needs to be done about the villager production methods. Carrying materials back and forth through AI pathing that can collide with each other doesn't just create a logistics challenge for engaging gameplay. It creates gross looking bottle necked management requirements. As realistic as it is that a person has to carry a sack of grain back to the bakery, etc, unless you have the AI prioritize methods for mitigating collisions it causes issues. Castle Story is a perfect example of this, FPS loss from clunky AI logic loops that freezes as the game progresses, unit clogging, stutters, crashing, arduous workarounds for the user that limit creative/efficiency freedom of building and unit placement, constant AI bugfixes that may or may not address the issue. Roads exist, one fix could be a pathing that utilizes roads as lanes that require passage in one direction on each side for non-military units, or remove collisions so that friendly non-military units pass through other friendly units. I'm unaware of the plans for the game, but this one thing if not fixed would change my recommendation pretty fast. If realism isn't a concern I would simply make gathering exactly like they do in the tried and true triple A titles, my bet is that a lot of these games don't include physical back and forth exchange for gathering with collision for the sake of making the game cleaner for the user experience.",1567712670,1567712670,True,7,0,0.628450095653533936,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Obviously it's early access and a lot could change and there are some bugs, unit path finding in my experience is hit or miss, sometimes units will get stuck and it would take about 5-6 clicks to unstick the unit from its place. 

However the concept and potential here are very promising and it's well worth supporting if you're into city builders with a fantasy twist. I can see this game being similar to the Stronghold series specifically Stronghold:Legends so if you liked that you'll probably like this.

The concept is really nice and I'm looking forward to being able to play more, right now the big deal breaker is that loading saved games doesn't work, so I haven't been able to play for so long.

Anyway, Early Access points aside, it's quite a cute game, very casual and relaxed. It's fairly straightforward in terms of city building, and seems to encourage making multiple small settlements around the map instead of one megalopolis. There appear to be some elements of questing, and the maps are very big (not sure if infinite?), so you can just kinda expand as much as you want and explore the surroundings.

        [td] Some buildings are glitched[/td]
        [td] Occasionally some of the buildings that produce units do not allow you to take those units outside of the buildings area, leaving them stuck inside the building. I've used workarounds like selling the building and rebuilding to correct it, but that should be an issue that is fixable by extending the unit's ""non-collision"" till it is fully outside.[/td]

        [td]Unit's path oddly sometimes and do not interact with buildings when told to click on them on certain occasions, such as dropping off a club at the barracks. Also, sometimes when interacting with a moving entity (enemies or livestock) they will occasionally stutter constantly between ""moving"" and ""action"" as if the moving entity suddenly caused them to spasm out.[/td]

Things that need to be fixed:
[list]
[*]Barracks soldiers cannot move outside the barracks after being spawned
[*]Resources do not get delivered when clicking on the building in the villagers window
[*]villagers stutter step when being directed to a job occasionally
[*]Barracks is very hard to interact with for villagers

I am really excited to see how this game improves going forward, and I hope it picks up some steam. It has been very fun in what I played at the time of writing this, I plan on playing some more when I wake up.

Fair warning! This game is still in development, has some bugs and is still light on the gameplay! One bug is not shutting down, hence it shows me having played the game for 68 hours xD!

[b]Disclaimer: I was and still is a closed alpha tester of this game[/b]
A game made by mostly one guy named Mata. Trollskog may have little content with only 2 to 3 hours, but it's potential is huge.
Also the content that is available in the 8/19/2019 version is very stable and captures the vision of how this game functions. I will continue updating my review based on content that were major to the game and the final release version.

    [tr]
        [td]Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The game feels responsive and right because the units obey you immediately and follow their path right.. sometimes. Also it's possible to micro by pulling in wounded units and let the healthy ones fights with the enemies until the wounded units are healed up. Also some controls and UI are not there like seeing a production queue, no visual control group icons, pressing the control group hotkey does not bring the camera to the location of said control group, which should be standard, and there is only one faction and it's still being in a work in progress. I really hope for a Trolls faction or race.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]Graphics[/td]
        [td]The visuals of Trollskog are simple, and minimalist, but it makes it clear and easy to read the units in the game. Also the game oozes and tells the great stories and tales of Sweden because of the trolls and myling models and look[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Audio[/td]
        [td]The sounds and music are okay at best. It doesn't have the badass songs of the Witcher, but hopefully this field will be improved in the Early Access[/td]
    [/tr]
[tr]
[td]Theme[/td]
[td] The theme and look of Trollskog is inspired by the smaller cousin of Norse Mythology - Swedish folklore. While The most iconic trolls are in there, I wish for more variety of awesome swedish creatures in this game since fighting bandits and mylings will be tiring. 

[b] Conclusion [/b]
Right now, the game is worth to buy if you want to see the full potential of a RTS with some 4X elements, also it's just $12 so it's cheap to get. It's fun for a few hours, but right now I think the player would not be serious enough to play this game for like over 100 hours. But it's good for what it is now. but if you don't like the low amount of content in this game then I understand. But for me, Trollskog is definitely gonna be a great ride to see it's final version. I am pretty excited for it's future

Edit: How do I get the Conclusion section out of the table?

2nd Edit: This game have not received any updates for a while now. I recommend you not to buy this game since the developer have a job that takes up most of their attention, rather then developing Trollskog.",1566246160,1700161805,False,0,0,0.547086715698242188,0,False,True,True,False,,,
