The gameplay is instantly something noticeable from the get go, there's 3 times to get on every level with the sun medals being the hardest, they're tight and often require good routing and optimisation, instantly even the very first level is tough to get the times on, but the games movement model and physics very readily provides plenty of power to the player to enable them to figure out how to tackle these times, the game does increment and add new gimmicks over time and does so steadily allowing a player to adapt to what's required of them. One weird oddity i found is that the key re-binding doesn't rebind but rather adds an additional bind to another key, this became an issue when the default burrow button is shift and my preferred jump button is shift, it meant i could jump and enter a wall pretty much frame perfectly every single time due to the binding overlap and sometimes binds wouldn't register altogether, i speculate this is due to the games age but still worth mentioning here if you don't have a keyboard where you can't reassign keys.

The visuals are extremely simple, but i appreciate that its simplicity is what allows the level design to stick out, the fact they took such a simple concept and managed to get 160 levels out of it with very minimal amounts of hazards added is insane, and i think if the game was any more complex graphically it'd start adding to the frustration and make the game cluttered, so the style is perfect for this type of game and while the colour scheme can feel a little lifeless at times its far better than too much clash.

Audio wise is where this game didn't try at all, its just the same sounding track over and over regardless of map screen or in any level, no unique world music or anything else, even the ending/credits sound the same, kinda disappointing that there was no effort put into it, and even though the sound effects are fine they aren't enough to redeem its lack of musical variety.

Overall an enjoyable time attack platformer, there's no funny tricks, just you, your routing and execution put to the test, i do hear some complaints from peers about level 131 being absurdly tight but i managed to fluke it in 5 minutes so sadly i can't give an accurate assessment of that without being extremely bias, but thought i'd include it here to give fair warning of that potentially occuring, outside of that, give it a shot, i hated this game at first for feeling bland but after getting accustomed to the precision and physics for a bit, its really fun!",1675438521,1675438521,True,3,0,0.559647738933563232,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Fun simplistic platformer, where the gimmick is that you can fly in the oppisite direction inside of walls. Really enjoyable, and I think the difficulty progression for beating the levels is great.

The difficulty for the sun times is pretty inconsistent tho, especially 131, which is one of the most disgusting times in an IL I have ever done. Took me about 3 hours just for that level alone.

Since I remember that, i figured I might as well toss a few bucks their way. 3) Totalbuscuit also did one of his later videos on the subject while citing this game and that article so I also kind of bought this in remembrance of him. Buying an older indie game that may not have gotten the attention it needed. 

The game itself is competent. I haven't played all the way through it, but I can says its definitely worth a few bucks at least. Its filled with levels and there are some high difficulty spikes for those who like that. People want a more chill platform may be a bit mislead by its initial appearance. It is pretty unforgiving at points. Other than that, its a solid platform with an over world and a bunch of decently made levels. Its a game where about phasing and jumping.  The gimmick of the game is that you dive into and propel out of platforms instead of jumping onto them. The physics of diving into a platform can used to propel you up more. The levels do a good job and exploring some of the intricacies of the mechanic from what i have seen so far. Its a lot like what I imagine a trout swimming up stream is like. 

If you wanted a fairly punchy, traditional platformer this is a good choice.

It gets difficult but doesn't feel unfair at any point as your controls are razor tight and the momentum is completely predictable. The game gets really hard by the end but finishing a level after being stuck on it for an hour is a cathartic experience.

What originally attracted me to this game was the 2d platforming and beautiful, minimalist aesthetic. And the game really looks and runs great. There are the (randomly generated?) parallax background patterns, leaderboards, different time rankings you can aim for, replays, an open level-unlock system, one soundtrack that fits perfectly and changes and evolves as you play - the game is very polished.

After beating every level, I can say that each and every level is unique, which is amazing as there are 160 of them and the core mechanics are so simple. Every chapter has a kind of theme or focus, for example chapter 8 focuses on moving walls that kill you, or another chapter deals with disappearing platforms, etc. And even each level in a chapter will have a fresh take on the mechanic. Many levels have their own, special hazards that are unique to just one level! I never felt like I was having to repeatedly do a certain kind of maneuver.

My one criticism is that the platforming isn't perfect. The character moves very stiffly without any inertia in the horizontal direction. If you jump off a ledge, there isn't any forgiveness if you press the jump button too late which is often implemented in platformers. And, for some reason I can't tell, something makes some jumps feel luck-based, like you'll do a jump over and over, finally get it right for a reason you can't tell, then do it again and keep dying again.

However, luckily, the unique mechanic of going inside walls and reversing gravity is implemented well. Being able to fling yourself into the air great distances is certainly exhilarating.

If this game looks at all interesting to you, then it's probably worth playing. But note that this game gets to be very difficult, so you have to be into hardcore platforming. The levels will at most take 20 seconds to beat, but you'll have to play each level a lot more than that to beat each one. If my play time is any guide, each level will take an average of 5 minutes. Also, I don't even understand how it's possible to get a full moon medal, let alone a full sun medal.

You make use of this ability to collect orbs in every level and then head to the exit. Every level has a timer, too, and you get medals based on how fast you are.

When compared to other precision-based platformers like SMB or Celeste, the game falls a little bit flat. The controls are not entirely accurate enough to get through some of the later levels without frustration and meeting some of the timer goals feels impossible. It often feels a little bit like luck. There are levels here that I would say are entirely based on skill and feel very satisfying to beat - and then there are longer levels with no breathing room, which require you to have a precision which these controls are not accurate enough for. 

A good example are the levels that require you to dive out of the side of the ground very shortly to gain some speed and then back in. If you go just a little bit too far left, the ""weight"" behind your character makes it so you go back into the ground too late, probably hitting some spikes in the process. Do it too early and you won´t leave the ground at all. Hitting this middle ground did not seem to come naturally to me, as the controls often did something else than what I wanted them to do, and everything happens very fast. Restarting the level is quick and easy, but it did not make the experience much more fun. Maybe I am just bad, but I did have quite some trouble with making the controls work in the levels that require a lot of precision.

The game also has some really bright backgrounds in some of the worlds that actually made my eyes hurt a lot. After playing the game for 20 minutes and turning away from the computer, I literally saw everything tinted in red. Combined with the fact that everything in this game is so small, it is really going to put a strain on your eyesight - a terrible design choice.

Still, the game does deserve an upvote for sticking with it´s simple concept and developing 150+ levels around it. The music is also a banger and the first few dozen levels are fun.

TLDR: Time attack platformer with a gimmick in which you enter floor. Limited colors. Unity engine. Finicky to control. Play 10 second ninja X instead.

This takes your typical object route formula. Get a little protag on a one screen level, Get coins-reach exit. But adds an optional speedrun timer and star rewards for completion. Has Xbox360 pad support. Seemed like it had resolution support but it was finnicky and the settings did not stick on my test machine. The audio and visual assets were simple and repetitive and bored me. The controls of the protag and the little quirky mechanics to navigate the levels are kind of interesting.

Unfortunately the gimmick is all momentum oriented in which you must find the right speed and arc at which you allow protagonist to float through floors to navigate levels correctly.

There is quite a lot of retrying involved and it can be finicky to get right. The game is not very colorful using a very limited color palette and the unity engine overall finish made navigating level menus a bit of a chore.

Instead of this being a cool platformer where you must use intuition and the cool game systems to reach the finish, it uses bad game design to force repetition. In classic bad platforming design, you must go around each level collecting collectibles to finish, instead of making them optional. This is just done to force you to make a bunch of perfect moves and if you collect 3 but mess up on 4 must restart entire level. That is all this game is about, forcing you to restart and try things a ton of times. That is because there are levels where you must collect all items in 1 jump. This is because you can't get back down through the level and need the momentum to get back up. This is just stupid and forces trial and error gameplay to get perfect jumps instead of using practice and ingenuity. The ability is cool, but you never know how far down you'll go or how high up you'll get, and there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it. The game also uses the exact same annoying song throughout. There's no story either. Interesting mechanic but flawed level design and game execution. And judging from the forums with people complaining about levels they cant beat or figure out how to, later on only gets worse. Thats the other problem. Instead of a platformer this is a puzzle game. You have to trial and error figure out all the perfect ways to build up enough momentum with going down and under, especially bc you can get to parts where if you didn't collect something with that jump you can't redo it and must start level over again. The final other problem is the control of the character. It feels like he's stuck in mud and very slow to respond to moving to the side while in the air, or while moving through platforms. No thanks

Music: 10/10 - Holy sh*t this soundtrack. I need to buy it. The progression is perfect. 

Sound design: 8/10 - I love the sounds of even failure in this game, it's like gently smashing glass. Gently. Let that sink in.

Gameplay & Controls: 9/10 - Strict, doesn't feel like there's any push from the game. Feels natural but tight. 

Graphics: 7/10 - Simple graphics but with progression, the color pallet changes to two entirely different colors, contrasting the previous level from the current one. Very wise choice to keep the game varied through progression.

Puzzles: 4/10 to 10/10 - Varies on level/progression/skill.

Bugs: 0/0 - There are none. This game is polished head-to-toe. It's a flawless 0/0 bugs found from me.

Having the basic explained let me tell you something right now: This game is a newborn legend that rests atop with with the other beasts of platforming that are Super Meat Boy and Dustforce. I was amazed with how well polished is the level design, one of the bests I've seen in awhile, and it shows from the beginning to the end.

You start simple with the first world, some spikes a ground, platforms, you get feeling of diving into the ground and of momentum. But as levels come there is always something new and refreshing, you may face yourself with fireballs that race through the screen, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by a set time, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by if you are pressing the button that lets you through solid material, flying spikes that patrol a certain area, and even in every world there is a homing boss that will chase you until you collect all the beads, that in this case are 5 instead of the regular 3, and reach the portal but, the boss is different with every world. He may leave some spikes as he goes or instead of going at a regular peace, it will fling itself into your direction from time to time, so yeah lot of variety and of the good one.

Even though you may simply describe this game as a platformer, the best way to describe it would be a puzzle platformer, or that's at least how I perceived it, having in mind I was always aiming in obtaining a Sun Medal (The best grade out of the 3 that are included in the game). Why the puzzle part you ask? Because of multiple reasons actually but mostly because of the scattered 3 beads in the stage, it makes you really think and ponder: Which is really the optimal path? Which bead should be the first I collect? And after that? Not every time the beads are set in a simple path, maybe they are too far apart or maybe some momentum may be of help in shaving those milliseconds to achieve that so grossly incandescent Sun Medal. And things keep stacking up. Should I jump from platform to platform? Or dive into the ground continuously? When should I start moving before the clock sets on? I need that platform to be on, or that fireball at that distance at least, or that flying spike to be at least in the right instead of the left.

And that is why so brilliant the level design, it makes you stop and watch the stage and think, but I really mean it when I say think. I even at times just took a walk through the stage (If it was big enough) and watch carefully everything I should be aware of to just start planning, yeah you read correctly, planning. And after that, your regular Dustforce or Super Meat Boy: Try, try, try, try, try until you succeed.

Another huge plus is the music, it's so relaxing and soothing it will make it will hinder the possibility of becoming angry. It's somewhat similar to Dustforce´s music, ambient electronic. And it gets better, The Sun and the Moon´s OST is like an evolving album, as you progress through worlds you start unlocking new tracks and every track feels like an upgrade from the last one, like an evolving experience. Good stuff, I've never seen any game doing that with its own soundtrack.

I liked this one more than Super Meat Boy but less than Dustforce. What can I say, Dustforce has an astounding skill ceiling that probably no platformer ever will be able to beat. But, still it's tons of fun and with that price tag of $6.99 USD it's pretty damn hard to say no. I spent 30 hours, getting the most Sun Medals I could, on it with zero idle time so the price is extremely fair for the 150+levels the game has but if you play it just for completing stages I guess the game could be beaten in 16-ish hours.

At first it looked very innocious, but after first 10-20 levels the difficulty started ramping up real hard.

The platorming is very precise, once you get used to the inertia and the gravity, inversions and tunneling you will be amazed what you can accomplish.

There are 160 levels, split into 10 worlds, where each introduces a different mechanic to defeat. In particular some levels stand out in difficulty from the world. I felt 54 was way too difficult for where it was, and anything past 120+ is really really challanging but not impossible. 141 can get you stuck unable to proceed (fortunately the forums here have a pointer if you need help).

It can be very frustrating at times, but once you finish the level it will be that much more satisfying.

If you like difficult platformers give this a go. I would buy this again even without the discount. Worth it!

This game. Is... I would put it in the ""meh"" category if Steam had that one, so this is a very light recommendation, but I think its main mechanic is interesting enough and it does enough with it to justify a recommendation, I did have a good bit of fun with this game after all.

That being said, I kinda wish this was a shorter $5 game. Instead of the 160 levels, give us 80 of them, pick out the better ones and give a more consistently enjoyable experience. This game really feels stretched out for content, in the end. There are some levels that toy with a few extra mechanics (time shifting blocks, blocks that pop in and out of existence when you hold the shift button, a few autoscroller-type things, basic stuff mostly) but the majority of the game is confined to making use of the main mechanic in a static environment. And there's only so much that can be done with that, I felt the game getting repetitive pretty early on and it didn't get more varied down the road.

There's also an uneven difficulty curve, I feel. Outside of the bonus world, I didn't find myself challenged too much by any particular world... but each world had a few levels way harder than anything around it. A lot of the boss levels also felt a bit unfair, having to pray that the boss would end up in around the same spot every time so that you could learn the level and complete it, and the final boss especially felt too long. There's a fair few levels requiring precision beyond what the game gives you, too. I feel like focusing on really precise movements in a physics-heavy game may not have been the best of ideas. But that's just me.

The main mechanic of the game is pretty interesting though and makes for some enjoyable platforming challenges. There's some levels about getting enough height via flying through blocks, other levels about trying to get down below via gravity and clever use of the main mechanic, and some just straight-up platformy levels. The extra mechanics occasionally thrown in also make things a bit more interesting; there's a few levels where you basically fly using the user-controlled blocks, and the boss of the 8th world has this very clever proximity thing going on, I really enjoyed that one especially. There's also plenty of replay value here; every level has three time challenges to meet. Personally I couldn't be bothered to even go for time challenges most of the time, ending up with very few sun medals and only a few dozen of the full-moon medals, though usually the half-moon medals aren't too hard to get. I spent around 7-8 hours just playing through all the levels once, so there's no shortage of content here, certainly, though honestly I would have preferred a bit less in the end xD

Overall it's a solid precision platformer, definitely unlike any other game I've played, but I feel the focus should've been on making a more compact and enjoyable experience rather than just throwing every level the developer made into the game and calling it done. I think it would've made this ""okay"" a pretty ""great"" one if there was a bit more polish to it.",1437267426,1437267426,True,0,0,0.462184876203536987,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The music starts being simple but it gets more complex (like adding instruments/tracks) after reaching new sectors, that's something that I didn't expect and was curious to find out. 

The controls are simple (moving left, right, jumping and the ""dive"" button) and very responsive, so everytime you fail it will be your own fault.

Also the level design is 10/10, I've never seen a game with perfectly polished stages except for Super Meat boy, some are even so beautiful to complete in the optimal path. If the dev reads this, just want to make you know that you're a god at designing levels *clap*. Many devs should play and learn from this game.

I really think this game deserves way more love. I totally recommend it to everyone who likes platform/time trial challenges. If you enjoyed games like ""10 second ninja"", ""Super Meat boy"" or ""Dustforce"" just buy this one, you won't regret it.

This game is both excellently pleasant and a nightmare. You can go through the levels in a relaxed fashion if you're here just for fun and don't care about times. And as soon as you try to get your first medals, even the easy ones, you begin to enter the real core of this game : it is well thought, a long series of puzzles for each level! What the quickest way to go? The most efficient one? You need to think hard and learn how to use the special diving skill. Sometimes you find roads just by chance. But it is a really satisfying game when you try. And I have a lot of fun dying and retrying . This is incredible.

I have had a hard time with the music, but the visual is really beautiful. Simple and schematic, few colors and textures, using contrasts. Levels with different charts. There are a few additions each time, it's surprising. And since it's hard, it is really a LONG game. 

There's a free demo on the developer's website if you wish to see for yourself before you buy it. You can also wait for promotions.

And why the hell not? They’re a great opportunity for developers, amateur and professional alike, to flex their creative muscles within the confines of each jam’s chosen theme and time constraint. Ideas thought up in the heat of a gamejam can even make it to a full retail product, and join the likes of Surgeon simulator or Receiver. For Ludum Dare 29 all competitors created games to fit the theme “beneath the surface”, and now its winning game, The Sun and Moon, has graduated to a full Steam release.

First impressions are key, so you could be forgiven for thinking that The Sun and Moon‘s visual simplicity belies an even simpler game. You play as a small worm creature with the ability to dig underground, but in order to dig deep down you’ll need to leverage the power of gravity and your own weight. Whilst the game is mechanically simple, it’s the ways in which you’ll utilise them, to overcome the game’s puzzles, that provides variety.

Each quick-fire level has you collecting a number of gems, and you can make your way to the exit once you’ve picked them all up. Levels don’t last very long, with some being as brief as 8 seconds or less, but you’ll need to be quick and have some serious finger dexterity to become that masterful. A three-tier grading system is included to encourage/taunt you, and you’ll face a real challenge to even gain the lowest grade in some levels.

The game drops you in the shallow end to begin with, tasking you with only picking up gems, but the difficulty ramps up very quickly. Pretty soon you’ll be throwing yourself off platforms and stairs, trying to gain enough momentum to fire yourself to other, higher platforms. Each level has an ideal solution, and its up to you to figure it out. But even if you do manage to decode a level, you’ll still need to seamlessly weave every movment, dive and dodge together to get to the exit quickly enough for that top ranking.

The control scheme is, at least, on your side, and you’ll only need to use the directional keys alongside the shift button if you want to dive underground. Some levels may prove too difficult or demand some time to fully understand, luckily the overworld map has a branching structure that allows you to visit multiple different areas at once. Each new area brings its own challenges, but also a refreshing change of scenery, as well as an extra layer for the game’s chiptune soundtrack.

And about that soundtrack, it’s pleasant enough to keep your head bopping and feet tapping, whilst not breaking your concentration as you fail for the 20th time. It’ll even extend itself as you unlock new areas, adding new layers to the beat, making it more complex and diverse.

You probably already know if you’ll enjoy The Sun and Moon. Its excruciating difficulty and intense gameplay make it an acquired taste, only fit for those who can pick themselves up after repeated failure, only to continue playing.

It’s the very epitome of videogame masochism and punishes far more than it rewards – unless you can give it the ample time required to master its 150+ levels. It’s one of those games that really makes you work for your gratification, even if  only a fleeting sense of achievement. As much as we wish we were any good at The Sun and Moon, we just aren’t – as our ground teeth, pounded keyboard, and flipped desk will attest to. So if you don’t mind, we’ll be backseat gamers and watch someone else play it instead

- Simple yet striking visuals. It uses sharp contrasts and certain color schemes to create a very unique aesthetic. This is minimalism at its finest 
- Main gameplay mechanic involves shifting into the floor and building momentum (the floor naturally accelerates you upwards when you shift into it). Very simple, but it's very fun to ramp up speed and try to hit the little dots. 
- Solid level design and a good amount of content: There's quite a few levels (~160), and they vary in interesting ways. Most of them revolve around the main gameplay mechanic of shifting and speeding at the right moment.
- Challenging yet not overly difficult. There are some frustrating levels, but for the most part it stays reasonable. If you wanna really push yourself though, there be medals. Those are much tougher to get, and it can be fun yet frustrating trying to shave seconds off your time 

Cons: 

- The soundtrack is minimal, and this is less fun. It is a very simple track that repeats and sometimes changes around as far as I can tell. It doesn't get annoying, but it lacks variety.

For its unique twist on the traditional style alone, gamers should consider adding it to their collection, with the simplicity of control and great audio sealing the deal.

Instead of being limited to the traditional gameplay directions (up, left, right), players can defy gravity and propel themselves downward into the ground in their ongoing quest to collect three shiny orbs and advance to the next level.

This unique mechanic is the definitive highlight of the game as a whole. Forcing players to rethink classic strategies of beating platform puzzles is no easy feat, but The Sun & Moon does so in a way that is simple to pick up, yet challenging to master. With over 150 levels of gameplay (ranging in difficulty from easy to what the developer describes as “brutally hard”), players will likely enjoy the fun dynamics this feature of the game creates.

The only objection casual players might have is the price, but if it is on sale, it's definitely worth the purchase!

Highly recommended!

This is an expanded and polished version of the game that won the 29th Ludum Dare game jam (48 hour version). The theme was Beneath the Surface, and the way the developer interpreted that theme was to implement a simple movement mechanic: the player can dive INTO the platforms, retaining momentum but with reversed gravity. The level designs really force the player to think and move in different ways, and they grow more challenging fairly quickly.

I recommend this game for anyone who likes platformers with unique movement mechanics and anyone who likes short, skill-based challenges (the game keeps track of the player's best time for each level).",1416006013,1416006013,True,6,0,0.533682525157928467,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As you can see the game won a Ludum Dare and was created by a single person - so huge props for that!
The goal of the game is pretty simple and straightforward : you play as a sun, that needs to gather 3 moons to orbit it and get enough mass to enter the wormhole and complete the level. It's not as simple as it sounds and needless to say - the game is unforgivable and you die instantly! The main game mechanic is pretty interesting - you can penetrate the ""ground"" and move inside it. Once you do that, your impulse remain, but the ""ground"" wants you out of it and creates a sort of anti-gravity to push you out. The mechanic is tricky and mastering it is of utmost importance in order to succeed. Not all levels are static with only spikes and endless drops, there are levels, where you are being chased by an unknown entity, that follows you around and destroys you on impact - so you need to be swift and decisive in your movements to kite it around.
There are highscores for each individual level, as the position is determined by the time you needed to complete it - the faster the better. Important the point out is, that the timer starts not when the level loads, but when you move for the first time - so you have time to look around and plan ahead.
The controls are really tight, there is a full controller support, but I personally did prefer my keyboard. The levels are not always straightforward and you need to plan and think about the optimal route, or try and test to see what is even possible and what not. The music is ""ok""-ish, might get a little repetitive in the long run, but you can always disable it. The levels appear in the form similar to a graph tree leafs, so you can navigate around the level map and not necessary complete the levels in order, with the occasional block, requiring you to have a certain number of levels completed, before progressing.   
The huge amount of levels and the challenging nature of the game, paired with per level leaderboards make this an easy recommendation!

This familiar and direct-to-the point platformer feeling quickly and gradually transforms itself into something deeper, more complex and thought provoking as you are given the ability to slingshot yourself through solid walls to reach the previously unreachable orbs needed to exit the stage.

The action and the speed with which you break through each surface leading to your next goal are set to a pace that is addictive and constant, keeping you moving and diving through each cleverly placed obstacle at increasingly speedy times. Even when not rushing at full force for the objectives or trying to collect the little orbs The Sun and Moon is just a blast to relax and experiment with, watching the momentum change as you arc between solid obstacles at different angles.

The name The Sun and Moon itself seems to me like a metaphor for the opposing colors in the back and foreground, and the way your small round character transcends these two different realms as you bounce between jumping in the open air and sliding through the solid material of the ground as you phase into it. The visuals have a very simple and effective yet pleasantly abstract quality to them, the backgrounds in particular starting off looking like continents on some kind of extraterrestrial world map or more-so the dreamlike clusters of clouds amongst a green sky.

The Sun and Moon has a very progressive and rewarding structure to it. It lulls you into a false sense of safety, starting out in the most basic of ways with a challenge that is easy and all-too obvious. The music [b]at first[/b] bears a strikingly repetitive yet charming 8-bit tone and the map seems to be nothing more than a series of boxes connected by a line. These simplicities don't last long, though;

As you move on this all changes, the levels become large sprawling towers that you weave in and out of, carefully timing your momentum in order to land on a faraway platform. The music from the always incredible Dubmood grows and evolves as more adventurous compositions are layered into the mix and draw you into the expanding challenge. The map twists and conforms into complex shapes as it progresses, branching off into multiple paths of varying difficulty.

With loads of alternate stages locked behind hidden pathways on a huge almost metroidvania-like map, insane par times to challenge yourself with for each stage, and leaderboards to check your skills against the rest of the world the content here is enormous with 150 stages and plenty of replayability keeping you coming back to each one long after you've completed a basic run.

Rising from its roots as a Ludum Dare 29 gamejam under the fitting theme ""Beneath the Surface"", The Sun and Moon has come a long way and developer Daniel Linssen has turned what was a fantastic and simple concept with suprisingly deep mechanics into a content-rich package that is much sleeker, shinier, and polished than before.

It's minimalistic, all you can do is just jump and dive in the platforms, but with these simple two actions you can conquer ""oh-so-difficult"" levels and pat yourself on your shoulder.

If assassins was searching for tool that will help kill time, this will be the number one pick!

Game is simple but really, REALLY addictive! 

Smooth animation, simple mechanic, easy to understand but hard to play( in a good way! )

And design itself very good! I love this color pallet!",1415986779,1415986779,True,10,0,0.50550532341003418,0,False,False,False,False,,,
