The narcoleptic polling rate of the physics engine here means that, by the time the game registers the coordinates of your ball relative to your racket, it'll give you one of the three following results:

[olist][*]Register collision with the [b][i]back[/i][/b] of your racket, sending the ball screaming into your own net.

[*]Limp slowly into the middle of the field to time out and count against you as a ""dead ball"", with its own explicit score penalty as well as adding to your time penalty.

[*]Clip through your racket altogether.[/olist]

This leads to a meta-game where you need to thread the needle and play [i]around[/i] this game's busted collision-detection and hit the ball with all of the zeal of an octogenarian on bingo night while trying your best not to agitate its lumbago.

Good luck getting a shutout when even a normal Hard run can get utterly derailed by this bullshit.

At least on Valve Index, this game's busted. I don't know what kind of polling rate you need to track the fastest moving part of a controller and make sure collision detection never ""drops the ball"", but if Beat Saber's devs can discover wrist flicks adding more acceleration than they initially tested for and then correct with a patch, this dev can too.

Pretty basic, you have a couple of paddles in each hand, you spawn a ball, hit it, the enemy will hit it back, you try to avoid it getting past you, while trying to get it past him. A few different playmodes against AI, pvp or yourself.

Your enemy is a red square that moves around the huge back wall to rebound your shots, and while you dont have the same mobility of your AI opponent, and the ""goal"" is huge on your side too, Balls always bounce back to somewhere where you can hit them inside your gamespace, sometimes they arrive at the edge, the game asks for 2x1.5mt so consider that. 

The game has looking neon graphics that my 1080 had no effort in handling at 120fps. Sound effects and music are spot on... well maybe not one ""bubbly"" sound effect that id expect to hear a bubble make to be a sound in a sfx electronic ambient, but overall great sound design.

The most important thing, the ball hitting and physics was great! i felt i had control of my hits, and i could get better and kinda aim them. 

It also was a great workout, i beat the easy levels, and was defeated in the last level in medium, got to the 1st place of the weekly ""zen"" leaderboards (you just bounce the ball back against a wall and see how many you get, i got 216). And also tried the score attack. And by the end i was beat!

Recommended for anyone wanting a good Racketball workout while in a futurisitic ""Tron"" looking environment I got this in a bundle, the full price is a bit steep so consider getting it on sale.

说说有待改进的地方：
球拍的设定不知是根据哪款VR设备设定的，用Quest2玩总是感觉球拍距离与手柄的实际距离不太匹配（比Quest2手柄略长），经常性凭直觉击球时明明感觉能命中却打空了，让游玩流畅度和爽快感大打折扣，就没有与中等难度第五关AI对打超过五回合的情况，大部分胜的情况都是发球一击制胜，但凡跟AI对打消耗基本都是输。
-
玩Racket Fury:Table Tennis 乒乓球也有近20个小时经验了，对球的空间感知也有一定基础（跟高级AI对拉也差不多能拉个二三十回合），但玩这个就总是打不到球，不禁内心连连质问这是什么蠢货玩意儿？对打游戏变成了发球游戏。
希望开发者能够增加一下球拍设置调节选项，比如：球拍与手的距离，球拍倾斜角度等，从而对不同VR手柄有更好的支持。

Remarks and suggestions:
- I would love to have the ability to move the play area or at least ball spawning point around in game. The ball spawning point in directly in the center of the room and serving is difficult as I have to step aside for 1,5m to make a proper serve (and there I bump in a wall :D).

I bought it to try and give myself some inspiration to work out and get in shape, and this game lets me build up a sweat and get up a good workout that's amazingly fun! 

I second the comments about using the wriststraps though. So far I've not had many problems, but so far I've only played Easy (it's early days for me!) One thing I'd add for newer VR users is to keep your thumb away from the Menu button when you grip the controllers. I've had the game pause without warning when I inadvertently pressed the button during play, which was distracting to say the least.

Easy mode is fun, but make no mistake, it's challenging. Rather than 5 levels of the same difficulty, the AI gets bonuses at the start of each new round, making their returns faster, or their speed faster, and you can feel the difference. There's also a Zen mode, which just lets you whack the ball around and bounce it off the walls, and which is very good to cool down after a workout (and sharpen your skills for the next day!)

There's very little running around in this game, but you WILL jump and squat to get those high/low balls, so if you're playing in a small space, make sure it's very clear before you start.

Although this game used to be great, the ball for some reason now constantly goes through the racket, and it's a little buggy. However the dev's seem to have moved onto other things so no update makes this game pretty un-purchasable

This is probably one of the absolute riskiest VR games to play, potentially leading to a broken controller or worse (it was common to read horror stories related to this game in the first months after the Vive released).  In the last couple of years better racket games have been released with designs that don't present the same risk of collateral damage, so I would suggest going with one of those instead.

However I was wearing the straps, they just simply snapped with too much forced applied. I reached out to HTC to see if they could replace the controller and it was going to be something like $100.

For the first hour, I was in love with this game.  It was after the first hour that the issues began to arise.  The first is that the AI shoots the ball right on the edge of the play space.  Now, they do have a way to add padding to your play space to keep you from hitting walls, and that's a great thing to have, but when the AI is consistently throwing shots that make you fearful of hitting a wall (I hit a picture frame and smashed the glass) it stops being fun.  Tweaking the AI to keep it from throwing so many shots on the play space line would go a long way.

The other issue is the physics of the ball.  They're just not right.  Hit the ball to the left, and it curves to the right.  It does all these weird curves that make absolutely no sense and make it difficult to have any sort of strategy.  Why try to hit the ball in one direction when it's just going to fly off in the direction it wants to anyway?  That might have to do with the way the paddles are angled in relation to the controllers.  You can't hold the controllers normally and have the paddles be at a normal angle.  It's odd.  Allowing the user to modify the angle of the paddles would be nice.

Overall, fun game.  But if you have a small play area or are looking for a paddle ball game where you can actually control the direction of the ball, look elsewhere.  Though I'm recommending it, I do so with reservations.

Yeah, I had to change my rating after continuing the play.  I just can't recommend this game. The AI is atrocious and the physics governing the ball cause one hit straight on to curve off to the side or even go behind you, which makes this game just too frustrating to bother with.",1488065430,1488225966,False,8,0,0.586889564990997314,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Many people compare it to CyberPong and, having played its demo, I can honestly say that this game is better. 
The main problem with CyberPong, compared to this, is that here the ball actually responds to how quickly you hit it. In CyberPong, the ball goes at the same speed most of the time. In multiplayer, it just speeds up over the course of the point, but gently tapping it has the same result as hitting it with force. Here, you can feel the momentum of your bat/racket/thing getting transferred to the ball. The ball even curves if you hit it right. There is also a subtle vibration as you move your controller, making it feel as though you are actually holding a lightsaber! The music is fantastic and fits very well into the theme of the game, and the visuals make you feel as though you stepped into Tron: Legacy. This is further augmented by what the AI (your opponent) says: things like ""next human please"" if you lose and ""this may be a quirk of the reality we graced you with"" if you score a point. Kinda reminds me of GLaDOS, honestly.
To conclude, this game is super fun to play (it kinda feels like a workout after longer sessions) and its atmosphere is spot on. I can't wait for things like multiplayer to be added (which IS listed in the [b]Coming Soon[/b] section in the description, which is nice).

You *need* a large play area for this. Large enough to set your chaperone bounds and leave a full arms-length plus controller between the edge of the bound and the wall. The reason for this is the game gives you no safety buffer, so the ball can, and *very* frequently will, come at you right at the edge of your bound. Making it extremely hard, if not impossible to hit without smashing your controller into the wall. So 80% of the time the ball will come at you in a way that leaves you two choices: intentionally allow it to pass by and lose a point, or go for it and significantly risk breaking a $100+ controller. It makes players unable to actually play to their full skill potential unless they want to take the risk on a consistent basis.

I have a 3x3 meter play area and despite that have broken two controllers playing this game. As such I've stopped playing it, which is a shame because it's pretty great.

Resetting of player position, ball shouldn't appear until player is back on ""mound"".
Often times I hit the ball by accident with the controller when the ball appears.

Different return velocities would be nice, and when the back paddel hits, it seems it doesn't bounce off of it but set. I think some work could be done here. Also the game makes you want to use your wrist to when instead of your arm.
Getting an accurate hit should be more important than velocity.

I have never gone beyond easy, and the player should get more points for longer play action, than less points I think.
Some time penalty I think is bogus. It's a fun game, but the scoring seems to be opposite of fun. The more fun you have, the less your score which seems just wrong to me.

Mechanically the game play is very straightforward. Your goal is to get the HoloBall to the opposing side of the wireframe, tetrahedron court, whilst preventing your opponent from achieving the same.

Stylistically the design is spot on. A very clean and pure 80's digital distopia, which will remind many of you of the iconic ""Tron"" films.

The music sets the tone perfectly and compliments the aesthetic too a tee.

Occasionally it feels as if the collider for the paddle is not keeping up with the update cycle. This could be a problem with the Physics Engines update period, (I'd be interested to know if they've got it set at 90FPS). Alternatively I could be getting old and decrepit.

The HoloBall will occasionally ignore that my paddle is inside it's spawn box, which frequently results in own goals whilst I gloat over my perfect serve. This is irritating and unless a real cock up has occured during development, should be a very simple fix.

The obvious feature request would be multiplayer, pvp and co-op would be great fun.

Alternatively someone else will probably create a knock off on this idea and implement the above...

Who knows, my weekend is pretty clear!

All in all, great game, lots of fun, decent work out. Win Win.

I started the thing up and the first thing that stuck out to me is: WTF is that robot dude saying?  His voice is the worst thing ever.  Imagine some guy making his voice sound unnaturally deep and then standing behind an electric fan and talking and you'll be on the right track.  If you're going to make a robot voice make it intelligible.  Or just make R2D2 sounds and give me subtitles... 

So anyway, the 2nd thing that struck me was ""Wow, this is a big fucking room!"" and it was... like far bigger than the room I was playing it in... I started to worry that I was going to run into walls.  I tried not to run...This is a game where you will want to run though.  Keep that in mind.

So those things aside, what is this game?  Think ""VR pong"".  It's like all my old 70's and 80's arcade buddies came back in VR form!  So  yeah, you get a big ole paddle  (One in each hand actually) and a multifaceted VR Ball appears in front of you... swing your paddle and the ball flies towards the big red square that represents your robot AI enemy.  He makes sure his large red square hits the ball and it flies back toward you.   You will likely wind up having to dash a bit to get to the ball in time and thus you start to annoy anyone downstairs. 

At first the only two modes available to you are Zen (where you're just whacking the ball against the wall) and Easy... and I assume to unlock the harder modes you have to beat the easier modes.  Fair enough.  I wouldn't want to challenge the game on hard without proving I'm not going to have a heart attack on medium first anyway.

There isn't a whole lot else to this game (or so it seems).  There was a customize option but I have no idea what options are available to customize.  Maybe paddle size? ball size?  Some kind of documentation would be nice...maybe there is some and I just didn't see it.  It's certainly not in-game though.

Anyway... VR Pong, guys... this is pretty much what you can expect.  It feels a lot like you're playing squash or tennis (minus the net).  I think they could do better with this game if they added some stuff to it though... Maybe change the gravity or add some better sound effects... As it is now, it'll be a good workout (so many games this applies to) but whether that translates to fun or not has yet to be seen.

If you like racquetball, the classic game Pong and the film Tron, you're going to absolutely love this game. Seriously. You're on a neon light, wire-framed racquetball-type court, with each Vive controller represented as a paddle. Your goal is to hit the holoball past the black/red trash-talking AI square at the far end of the court.

If you own a Vive and want a decent workout, then buy this game. It's quite easy to work up a sweat through this game (you may want to invest in some VR Covers to avoid your headset foam eventually smelling like your gym locker). It's also great fun in addition to the exercise factor.

If you for some reason let go of your controllers at random, do NOT buy this game. Although I've not once came close to letting my Vive controller fly out of my hand, for some reason this game seems to be THE reason for the majority of broken Vive controllers.

And assuming you have replaced the standard Vive wrist-straps with Wii straps ([b]seriously, if not, go order some now because the standard straps WILL FAIL EASILY[/b]), this is a great demo game since it is so easy to pick up and play.

This game is worth every penny. Of all the ""simple-arcadey, demo-like experiences"" on the vive, this game actually shines as a worthy ""simple"" game as it has character beyond. Very few games on the vive feel like actual-games(well-planned and articulated, not just ""lets make a VR game and see if it sells"").",1466906024,1466906024,True,0,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I like:

+ music is troneseque
+ graphics are simple but great
+ physics are almost perfect
+ work-out for gamers
+ good price relation

I don't like:

- still room for improvement of physics
- needs more content
- urgently needs a multiplayer

It is one of the games which you use to show-off your Vive.
Highly recommended for every gamer that likes to move his fat ass and likes the Tron style and the Pong principle.

This game is crazy fun.  AI sometimes feels a little off (will miss some shots it feels like it should have easily matched with, and hits some crazy ricochets outside of human reasoning), but having it taunt you more than makes up for it.

Unfortunatly (and the devs state this is a fix / work in progress) is the play area boundries you have can make the difficulty a bit weird.  If you have a wide space, the AI could realistically hit a corner before you can reach it.  Too small, and the AI will keep punting balls straight into your paddles.

Overall a great experience.  I can only imagine how crazy the later difficulties bring.

You will have more fun, feel more immerse  and have a better workout if you have a big play area because you can do full swings like in tennis  and not have to worry about running into things, also change out the wrist strap  that comes with the vive controller with something stronger like the nintendo Wii wrist  strap, the ones that comes with the vive is super thin and weak.

Viveのルームスケールを活かして、部屋全体を自分のコートとして使った、コンピューター相手の電子テニスを行う。

Viveコントローラをラケットとし、球を打ち返すだけというシンプルなものだが、ラケットの微細な操作で狙った場所に球を返したり、スピンをかけたカーブボールを打てたりシンプルながらに奥が深く楽しい。
何より打っている感触がとても気持ちよく、狙った場所にボールが上手く入り点数に繋がった時の快感は、全身運動だからなのか非常に高い。
全身を動かして遊ぶことの楽しさを思い出させてくれる一品。
プレイしていると汗だくになるくらいには運動量が多いので運動不足の人にもお勧めしたい。

スポーツ苦手という人でも、EASY～HARDまでは慣れればクリア可能だと思う。自分もスポーツ苦手だけどHARDまではクリアできたので。
また同難易度はリムというゴール端っこのCPUが球を打ち返せないエリアがあるので、そこを狙えば点数を稼げる。
エキスパートからは本当に難しく、リムエリアも除かれ、まさにスポーツのようになってくる。競技用の靴が欲しくなるだろう。

気になったこと
・最低2x2メートルくらいのスペースが必要
・Viveコントローラの標準ストラップは意外と貧弱(手汗でViveコントローラ滑らせた時にストラップの根本がすっぽぬけた。Viveコントローラ自体は頑丈。)

I'm not particularly masterful at any sport (real or otherwise), but this feels well-balanced. I am currently just about beating the computer on Medium every time and now am ready to try Hard. I've found myself gloating at the AI player after a nailing particularly good serve or offhand smash (which includes pointing my right-hand paddle at it and saying ""HA F**K YOU LOSER!"") and the feeling of personal shame when you fluff a particularly simple shot still gets me. 

Some quick tips:
 - Be mindful of where BOTH paddles are. A couple of times I've tried a backhand and my off-hand has gotten in the way and rebounded the ball back through my own goal.
 - You can tee up the ball on the serve before smashing it. Makes nailing Aces much more likely (my best is 4 in a row). I can foresee that, with practice, I could start to Roddick the crap out of this and hit them every time).
 - Low returns are a bitch. Be prepared to get down low and deflect them back defensively.
 - Don't be afraid of your weaker hand - you might actually find that your % success rate is better as you'll hit so many more across to the other side of the goal and the AI might not make it in time.

I'm looking forward to seeing where this games goes. Oh and the setting just works. Get ready for a Blood-Dragon-Pong-Tron-Athon.

The game has a multiplayer element where one steers the ""ai"" with the keyboard. I tired it for a few seconds while demoing it to a friend. but it was to hard to hit the ball when controlling the ai which made it very easy for the player.

Before the update, this was a great game.  The core game was solid, but my only gripe was that each shot felt more like a ricochet rather than an actual swing. When I would serve the ball with all my might, sometimes it'd be a cannon, and sometimes it'd be a dud. You'd get a lucky defensive shot ricochet with power into the AI's sweet spot. You really just had to make contact to stay competitive with expert AI.

Since the update, ALL these problems have been resolved.  EVERY Time I serve, it zooms across the court like I intended.  Also, those fast serves get a FAST return volley.  If you serve with power, be prepared to react within a split second. Now my defensive shots are slow and easy for the AI to pick up. Against harder AI, you truly have to earn each point and smash the ball into their sweet spot.

It also now gives you a warning to use your wrist straps and perhaps replace your Vive straps with Wii straps. I am a victim of Vive straps breaking off, causing the controller to fly into the wall.  You do not want a $110 repair bill from HTC support. Trust me.

Imagine if the original 1974 Pong, had a baby with a colorful, virtual 3-Dimensional environment. Then, that child grew up, and had a baby with the classic indoor sport of racquetball. That wonderful, miracle, of a baby, is named; HoloBall!

HoloBall is a competitive sport-like game in which takes place in what appears to be a neon version of a racquetball court. The goal is to win against a snarky, sarcastic, comedic AI, and attempting to get the highscore to get your name up on the leaderboard. Doing so, immenses a challenge and a great amount of fun! The different difficulty levels, really help to match your level of skill. The harder the difficulty, the larger the court and the smaller the ball. The racket has perfect physics! It feels all so very natural swinging at the ball attempting to get it passed the AI. Not only is this game a large amount of fun, its a great workout too if you really get into it!

HoloBall is a great little mashup of racket-ball and pong, mixed with the post-apocalyptic robot humor that reminds me a bit of GladOS from Portal. Absolutely worth the price of admission!

Good:

Very fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master (I can't make it beyond the Hard difficulty). I love this visual style, reminicent of the old Tron movie mixed with some polygon backgrounds from the old Virtual Boy era. Sense is scale is really nice, feels like you are in a big hall/hangar. One thing I absolutely loved was the haptic feedback of the racket. It has this long veil/ribbon streaming out of the back and as you move it, you feel it swoosh around. Really sold me on having that sci-fi racket in my hand instead of the Vive controller.

Bad:

A bit barebones with regards to gameplay modes and options, but the base game has enough to offer initially. Future updates should include more modes (many balls come toward you, specific areas of the court give more points/are blocked, etc) and possibly power-ups (more balls, racket size changes etc). Multiplayer would also be very cool but it would require big changes to the gameplay (can't go as high vertically). One final note of warning: make sure you have a lot of space or stand as far back as you can! I have about 2.8x2.3m and was so immersed and focused on winning and smashing the ball that I scratched the controller on the wall twice in a row the first time I played it.

This low priced, simple game is amazing and along with SPT my favourite game.
The atmosphere is great, polished style and amazing gameplay.
Developers have done something I havent seen on any other game too, those not in the game can actually control the camera to see what is going on in the game, and can control the ""ai"" part in the game. This is an amazing idea that no one else seems to have thought of, that I have found anyway.
A two player game where one is in VR and the other(s) not is a brilliant concept.
My only negative comment is that the second player should be able to use the mouse to control the AI paddle, as using arrow keys is way too hard to keep up.

I tried playing this again few years later on my Index on a completely new setup and unfortunately its no longer playable. The HMD just absolutely bugs up and barely see above two black boxes at the bottom of my vision.

A shame really, but I doubt the developer updates this anymore Having not seen any activity on the forums. I wish I had played it more since it was very promising back in the day. I do not recommend getting this at all, or atleast not until the issues are solved if ever.

2016: Recommend

Okay, this was a total suprise game for me.

Very, very simple, harkening to Pong.

But you have two paddles. and have to move in the space against a more and more difficult foe: Who will cheat, mid you, becomming bigger and faster at the game goes on.

I sorta rolled my eyes when playing it on easy, but yeah, Medium starts to work up sweat. Still stuck on the final round on it, but then again it just might be my arm getting sore from swinging so much as you have to make the ball move fast inorder to avoid a time penalty to score.

Downside is that when ever my frames dip slightly so that , it seems like the collission detection goes off. With graphics like these its odd that it is lagging quite a bit on a minspec ""VR Capable"" computer (equilevant to 970). 

Hopefully they can work out some optimization in. 


Could also use some more old school synth music too.

I've had an opportunity to spend some good time in this. I also had 5 other people who came over for a ""Vive"" party try it out as well. Long story short, the game is spectacular fun and should be an instant-buy if you like pong, enjoy racket ball, or like the Tron 80s style theme. The production value feels high, the music doesn't get old, and the AI taunting is a hilarious nice touch (though I'd recommend increasing the volume of the AI a little as it's hard to hear over the music). For the price they are asking right now, this is a steal!

The gameplay itself is well done. The ball reacts as I would expect it to and I never felt like the ball did something that shouldn't happen if I really was in 3d cube in real life fighting for the freedom of the human race. There are currently 5 game difficulty modes and on the highest endurance mode, the difficulty can be punishing and can be quite easy to break into a sweat trying to catch the ball coming at you. I do wish there were more gameplay options at times, whether it be an option to have 'power-ups' or have obstacles in the way, as after awhile pong even in VR does get monotonous. The developers have an excellent concept and great execution on their hands, so iterating on it should be fairly simple and something I hope to see in future updates.

All this said, the AI seems to have trouble handling balls that are at the absolute corners of the zone and leaves them completely alone or goes in the opposite direction of them. This means the AI is susceptible to 'trick' shots, many of which go at minimal speed and still somehow make it through the paddle. I was able to replicate this a few times by 'smacking down' at the ball as it came at me and see it completely lose speed, dribble to a corner, and slowly get past the AI paddle which didn't know what to do with it. I will note, it's obvious the AI dipping out on corner shots is design decision as you get a 'sweetspot' dialogue with extra points when you hit it. I understand why they did it, but it still feels a little immersion breaking. This was infrequent enough that it didn't feel game-breaking, but it was immersion breaking enough that I recommend to the devs to look into it.

For the price they are asking, the positives far outweigh the negatives so far, and I am looking forward to pushing to top the leaderboards on release. Great job guys!",1461628111,1461628359,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

HoloBall is a mix between Pong and racquetball, stylized with Tron-like art animations. The gameplay is simple: score against an AI by hitting the ball with one of your paddles. The game's difficulty ramps up as it continues and each round introduces a modifier such as speeding up the AI or increasing hit power.

Leaderboards encourage replayability and I'd love to see online multiplayer in the future. One thing to note is that you'll be swinging your controllers pretty hard. Make sure you have adequate play space and are aware of your position in your room. I'd personally like to see an outline of the play space much like Space Pirate Trainer to increase positional awareness.

So while I played a paid copy of the game, I won't let this influence this review.


As someone enjoying sports involving rackets like Tennis or Badminton, I feel like this game is absolutely fantastic fun! Let's start with the concept. You hit a ball with a racket, either with your left or right hand, and watch as it travels towards a huge wall covered by a floating AI opponent platform. Said CPU tries to return the ball and the goal of course is to get the ball past the player. It's basically pong meeting squash. There are three alternate modes: „Zen“ is classic squash, with the player having to repeatedly hit the ball of a wall. Then there are three different difficulties for matches against an AI, each consisting of five games, first to score five wins a game. Players are rewarded points for winning and performing bonus actions like an ace serve, but get points substracted for time spent. In this highscore-based mode it's all about time basically. To round the content of, „Endurance“ has you playing against a bot with only three lives to survive. Fundamentally, you have to score as many points as possible without letting the ball get past you more than two times. While each mode contains more or less the same key gameplay elements, they still all play diverse. Zen is best played rather slow, as you want the ball to travel as slow as possible to be able to return it as precise as possible over and over again. On the three difficulty enemy encounters, I tend to play more and more aggressively. While „Easy“ really is quite easy, „Medium“ already managed to give me a workout. „Hard“ definitely is a challenge and I tend to absolutely smash the ball whenever possible to get past the enemy. Spanning five rounds each, the AI gets better with the rounds played. It moves faster or returns the ball harder, giving you a great progressive increase of difficulty even within the different modes. „Endurance“ also comes with a change-up in mechanics. While the three other enemy modes have a „sweetspot“ zone on the edges of the wall that you'll definitely want to hit, leaving the enemy no chance to reach it, this zone doesn't exist in Endurance. All my play in the three difficulty modes usually focusses on aiming at the sweetspot-zones, making it feel different to Endurance. Here, you need to out-play the enemy, once again involving forceful smashes and quick directional changes. All of the playing modes ultimately have you hitting the ball, but while incorporating the same mechanics, they still manage to feel different due to varied circumstances.

The actual gameplay is absolutely mad fun! The Vive controller just works awesome as a racket. I'm playing in a 3,8m x 1,8m space and the use of room scaling is fantastic. It can be quite exhausting running from one end to the other, though it never seemed unfair in my time with it. When the ball came through, I always knew I was too slow. All in all it feels like a work out, but a very fun one. As hard as I kept hitting the balls, I felt sore muscles just few hours later the first time I played it. The game encourages me to use both arms, as each hand is equipped with a racket. While you theoretically still can play with one controller using forehand and backhand hits, you're way better off using both. I'm usually terrible at doing anything with my non-dominant arm and as the game encourages me to still use it, I think it actually helps me getting better with it. At the start I couldn't hit a ball with it, but it has already gotten better at the end of my first session and it keeps improving. Haptic feedback on the controllers makes the swinging all the more satisfying.

One of the most fun experiences I've had in VR with the Vive so far has been jump-smashing a ball to victory. It feels so satisfying to run and jump, smashing the ball with as much force as possible. It makes me feel really bad-ass, especially if it's still precisely aimed at a sweetspot zone. The game becomes a frantic, awesome work out on both the Hard difficulty and Endurance, as the enemy tends to return the ball harder and harder. My reflexes are greatly tested as the ball can come back in any direction in my 3,8m playspace width. Smash the ball and you face quite a workout with the enemy giving you a real challenge.


With all the talk about smashing a controller around, I didn't come close to hitting any furniture or walls in my time with the game so far. There's a room requirement for a reason, and I think as long as you have the required 1.5m x 2m or greater, you're good to go. The room scale use seems perfect and thanks to Chaperone, I'm sure there won't be a case of destroyed furniture or controller :p I ended up hitting myself with the controllers though which is a first for me with the Vive. The heavy hitting makes it difficult to slow the controllers down in time in some occasions and thus I hit myself regularly in my first hour. The more I played though, the less this happened. But a short, important advice: It seems crucial to wear the controller wrist straps. All the smashing in combination with slippery hands can make controllers fly through the room. I actually had a controller slip happen to me, while wearing the straps though – thankfully. So remember to use them or you'll regret it.

Visually, the game is looking great. The neon colors are vibrant, though the black largely black background keeps it light on the eyes. The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes – they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.

With the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn’t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there’s no real need for a patch anyway. 


Holoball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!",1461608012,1461608012,True,4,0,0.552896976470947266,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are simplistic and colorful but have a sharp design style.

The opening lobby is an empty room that contains a number of pedestals with different difficultly levels on each one. initially, the only selectable difficulties are Zen (practice mode) and easy.

I started off with easy mode.

The ball is tee'd up for you to hit and the controls are simple. You swing at the ball and, depending on how hard and what angle you hit it at, it will direct your shot. You want to aim at the sweetspot (outside edges) or angle your shot to bounce off of one or multiple walls. The object, just like pong, is to outwit and outshoot your AI opponent looking to return your serve.

Also, it is good to note there is a leaderboard which I think is a staple and necessary in any arcade type game. It's just another carrot on a stick to keep users striving to do better and encourages players to continue coming back to the game. In the current iteration the leaderboard is only visible once you enter the room. My suggestion is having a way to bring up the leaderboard without having to leave the game and come back.

After some witty quips from my computer opponent I took my shot. WHAM, ACE +100 points. First impressions are great, the accuracy relies completely on the user ability to control the motion controls and the speed in which the shot is taken.

The AI opponent is comical with its retorts and it motivates me to hit my shots correctly.

There are 5 rounds and the player has to reach 5 points in any game, before the AI, to move onto the next round.

I did well and made my way through easy without too much difficulty and was very amazed at how much fun it is to play. I quickly restarted easy to get a better position on the leaderboard.

After getting my bearings I moved onto medium difficulty.

My first impression was that the room increased in size. Ok, that's a cool idea and mechanic.

Quickly, I realized my 7 ft tall ceilings were not going to suffice for any difficulty past easy.

I tried my best to not crush my ceilings, but unfortunately a number of shots went above my reach and it happened regardless.

I made my way through Medium with some lackluster results after restarting a couple times and having learned to let some shots just go by to save my drop-tile ceilings.

I moved onto hard and the room grew bigger. After the first return, I had to leave as a lot of the shots were above my head.

After trying out Zen difficulty I found an equal amount of fun to be had in this very different racquetball type style training simulator.

I did not notice any bugs in the initial testing I've done but will continue to check out the game and see if I find any in time.

So, after an hour of testing I think this game has a ton of potential. The controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is inviting and fun. The difficulty ramps up fairly but my main complaint is that you would probably need at least 9' ceilings in the games current iteration if you are a tall individual like me at 6'3"".",1461607739,1461607739,True,33,1,0.80956733226776123,0,False,False,False,False,,,
