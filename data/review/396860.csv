It is a very thought provoking story. It shows were our decisions (good or bad) can lead in life and the effects is has on others in our lives.

Being a history buff I found myself looking up the information about Michigan and Ohio territories during this time period to make sure it was correct.  I was very surprised that the creator/writer was spot on. And another thing that impressed me was the information on the Native American Shawnee.  The writer did not sugar coast anything about the history of the tribes that were coerced and/or forced by the Americans or English to fight for them.  (Yes, some of the tribes did volunteer to fight but many did not.) Another thing the writer brought to light was the effects war have on all different kinds of people and the land.

I can say this story is worth reading. I walked away with many things to think about.  Many thought provoking things. I know this story is not for real young ones but those old enough to read should do so with parents.  It is something worth discussing as a family.

So, as much as a quick mentioning of any related names or items has my greatful interest by default.
Like this visual novel i find to be a good reading, even though it was definitely meant for being read by much younger people. 
Which makes no problem, i never miss a chance to improve my english and in this aspect it's also good enough to keep me interested by contents and vocabulary, too. Well drawn, well written. Not my type of music in there, but somehow i've been surviving through it so far, and i've got all the metalcore i want to stuff my ears with when i'm not sitting here reading visual novels.

One more funny detail - i don't see any keyboard settings in the games menu. Neither i needed them so far.

And i've made it through this novel for as far as to having a 5th achievement of the total of 8. And my steam screenshot button is V, in order to be able to take screenshots in the middle of a fight without having to hit a button i might miss without turning my eyes to the keyboard. And i've poked at that V button much more than once in this game. And nothing ever came out of it, except for a Steam's sound as of a camera taking a shot. But this day, the game announced that a voice acting mode was activated, and added that i should press V to deactivate it, to kill any doubts about what happened. And started to freaking voice act it all to hell, with such an awful english pronounciation that i just couldn't help insta-getting proud of mine(which's far from perfect to be honest).

I realized very shortly that this...was not that. Story of a British soldier and a Shawnee girl as they travel together.

Kinetic novel, so no choices. No voices either. Writing is okay, not great but not terrible either. The setting seems interesting at first glance but they don't really do anything with it--you don't encounter civilization or really any of people acting out a ""normal life."" Art's okay, manages to feel moderately unique though I wouldn't call it super great. Music is alright, though I personally got a little tired of all the drum/marching/vaguely ominous pieces. Story is very short, but a rapport develops pretty organically between the soldier and the girl. Does an okay job of describing a character who really isn't a good guy but has good in him, which comes out around the girl. Not going to spoil the ending of course, but have to say that while overall the experience was definitely short, the ending was kind of fitting. All the plot threads were pretty properly tied off.

There are a couple things I found a little confusing: [spoiler]the dreams and Mai's final words. A pretty woman is entranced by a man, follows and lives with him, discovers that he's a ""snake person,"" runs away from his snake form that chases her, is warned and led away by a bird spirit, returns to her old home to find it abandoned, stabs the snake with a spear, who turns back into the man, then she discovers her beauty is gone, and she then admonishes people she meets to look for beauty from within. I don't really see how this relates to the story, because the soldier is never shown to be looking for superficial beauty at all. And then Mai's last words--she calls the soldier her ""brother."" Incidentally, I just googled ""Shawnee my brother"" and the first link was to the ""Shawnee Prophet"" who was the brother of Tecumseh, who is mentioned in the VN, but apart from this I don't know of any specific reason why she calls him this.

In the end Aubrey asks Mai to wait for him in the sky, which makes me wonder if with all of this the devs were trying to intimate a romantic attraction. But that's only speculation; apart from that I don't understand these scenes.[/spoiler]

Later, as he is seeking shelter from a storm, he happens upon a lost Shawnee girl. This visual novel took me about three hours to read.

I enjoyed the game even though it was a bit short. The detailed backgrounds were beautiful, and I liked the character designs and concepts. The music was gorgeous, but not intrusive. However, there were a few (minor) issues I had with the game. It felt like some of the sound effects did not fit the action that was happening, which was a bit distracting. I also feel like the beginning portion was stretched a little too much; I think it overdid some of the interactions between the two main characters in the barn. It got to the point where it felt contrived and a bit unrealistic.

Overall, I enjoyed the visual novel and what it had to offer. For me, this feels like a one-and-done game. I don't regret buying the game, but it's not like the game especially amazed me.

TLDR: Very drawn out. Slow. No interactions. Fully linear. Not very entertaining but harsh end and some decent art on occasion. Play once and discard or watch a video stream.

In summary this is basically a happy go lucky duo of adventurers. A soldier and a native 12yo girl. Sort of a Last of us/Telltale Walking dead sort of situation. You run away from the brit army and try to defect and work for the american one. You go to the native girls village, but in the end you get caught up by an officer and the little native girl gets shot as she tries to help you.

It is kind of heartbreaking in a way because there is sort of a romanticized innocence to everyone involved here that is not really reflected in how things were historically. The story being passive and uninteractive means you have no control over the outcome either. There is also a lot of problems with pacing, where conversations carry on for way too long in order to deliver exposition.

Conclusion: If it had more variety and more assets, and better pacing and some interactivity it would had been much better. As things stand you would be better off going to watch the movie Last of the Mohicans.",1534120958,1534120958,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game details a brief encounter far into the war in mid October 1813, and it offers a small perspecitve on the events of an unnamed battle badly lost by the British. The main character, Aubrey, is a British deserter who saw his commander flee the field of battle and his allies massacred. 

A little further into the novel the player realizes that the man is anything but good and, despite his attempts at redeeming himself, he is ultimately a bit of a scumbag. As it happens, he has an history with another man as bad as he was, and they have not settled the score yet. Moreover, he will soon find a cute little indian girl that happens to be lost in the storm.... yeah, If you thought ""Oh my God this will be another of those wont it?"" the answer is absolutely yes. Of course.
The story is not only short (under 5 hours) but incredibly stereotyped and telegraphed in its ending.
The most irritating thing about it is that all characters act like in a play, and not your regular western play, but a very Japanese animesque one. You basically have soldier-kun meets cute little indian-chan and the novel will make absolutely every effort to make you like her, to get you to see how cute and kind she is and how clumsy soldier-kun is. And you well know why, do you? Yes you do. Because the ending, the one. That one ending.

Visually speaking its nothing to write home about but it is absolutely decent for its price and effort put into it. It gets a full pass, I dont dislike it too much. The music is of course where all the budget went, good to great pieces of music, inspirational and put together nicely at the right moments.

All in all, this is - I'm not joking here, mind you - a copy-paste of Planetarian if the android girl was an indian in the flesh and the desperate post-apocalyptic protagonist was a Napoleonic soldier. There's even the exchange of the ""memories"" at the end. Almost word for word.

My advice here is, if you have already read Planetarian or one of the other million novels \ books about revenge with a girl in the middle used for ""the one purpose"", just skip this because you lose nothing. Buy the soundtrack instead which I believe has better value.
If you havent read other novels similar to this one, I would still tell you to skip it because there are better written ones, and more than anything else, far more respectful of the subject matter.

I thouroughly enjoyed the setting and characters. A quick word of warning for some - there is no interaction in the story, so if this is a deal breaker you have been made aware.

A large amount of effort has been made to give the setting and different cultures an authenticity that most stories and visual novels flounder on. I was invested in the story throughout and thought that it gave a good impression of how tough and unforgiving America in this time period was. 

The characters are definitely multi-layered. Aubrey is certainly not a hero, however the game goes to great lengths to show you how he (and everyone else in the story) is a shade of grey rather than ""good"" and ""bad"". I felt that this certainly helped the story as it shows that everyone struggles with morality and made the characters far more believable.

Historically, the story is excellent. The language used and the attitudes displayed goes a long way for authenticity. It appears that research was done to do all cultures and environments justice, and to enhance this Aubrey unreliability as a narrator (and when his views are opposed) gives a fleshed out world.

The art and music is wonderful as well, and it is clear that this project was a labour of love for those that made it.

But the glaring flaws with the story, alongside with the inconsistencies in plot and development only leave me wishing that the person who wrote this spent more time learning proper plot structure, than letting the musical work and art of others go to waste. The half baked and poorly delivered plot build up, to the main characters friend psychotic break and unrealistic development only destroyed whatever feeling I was meant to feel, when the forced death scene came around (I'll go into that plot thread later into the review)
Not even  that was my major problem, but it was the fact that from a narrative standpoint, our character goes from someone we'd best believe and understand as an underdog, a man that overcomes all odds and turns a new leaf taking a deep plunge into a character arc that completes the story and leaves you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth. 
Instead I get to see a coward, lead a 12 yearold girl to her death all so he can kill someone who was completely justified in wanting to end his life. (even this is debatable since the story doesn't add up and only exists to justify his obsession. This is itself is a gaping plothole.)
Am I really supposed to think, that this thief and murderer (Main character) Is supposed to be seen as a hero when he lets this young girl sacrifice herself over his own fuckup?
This alone also gets worsened, when you realise that her tribe is long dead and gone. Considering the betrayal that sent many a man to his death on the battle that caused the redcoats to desert. ON TOP of the fact that she herself explicitly stated that many were shot and wounded during her capture, making it unlikely and impossible for her tribe to have survived the raids and coercion into the war. 
Even the main villain suffers from consistency issues, since he was supposed to be obsessed and abusive. The problem with this was, he was in part going above and beyond with his orders, and sending his men off into a death march into the woods with dwindling food and water reserves. Considering the redcoats desertion, and the broken morale. Even a bluecoat would've deserted. So it completely rocks off the hold and progress, that this man would've made to find and kill his own treatorous friend. Since his scouts and infantry would've left him out in the cold with a gunshot in his chest.
I can't even begin to get started with the confusing dream sequences that seemed to hint that the main character was developing feelings for this 12 yearold girl, only for the writer to realise this was looking really bad, then tip toe and dance away from the dream developments. Alongside the hinted at banter between the two that was only an inch closer to turning romantic, from platonic.  
I'm sure that if he thought about this plot a lot more, we would've had this awesome two worlds collide, and interactions that would've left an impact. With a wounded soldier having to repent for past sins, while leaving impactful words on a girl seeing the world torn apart from the evils of man, and the destruction of her manipulated tribe.
But I received none of that, only a half cocked forced plot development. (Her death) and the forced revenge story from the main character (If you start at the beginning and pay attention, he's retelling a story of his partner leaving with half the loot, as he turns away from a life of crime and boards a ship that gets raided by the redcoats. This is the main development that forces him into the army.)
Her death, left me feeling sour for all the wrong reasons. I should've left crying, not asking why at every corner for how bad the developments were to that point, and how forced it was.

Despite my taste for reading, I've never been particularly drown to Visual Novels for a long time - probably because I didn't consider them exactly as games. Until one day I discovered [url=store.steampowered.com/app/446990/The_Huntsman_Winters_Curse/]The Huntsman : Winter's Curse[/url] : an excellent compromise between RPG and Visual Novel. It made me realize what a great adventure it can be : instead of staring at black on white books, you get to experience a story through not only text, but also pictures, musics, sounds, animations, sometimes even choices (note that it's not the case here); and that's what Over The Hills And Far Away has to offer : a marvelous and emotional tale to delight your mind, your eyes, your ears and your hearth.

I would definitely recommend Over The Hills And Far Away if you like Visual Novels, reading or great stories, especially if you can get it on sale. A longer story would have been nice, mostly because I'd like to know more about the Shawnee folklore. Also the last part feels a bit rushed and I was expecting more for this price. The journey would have been even better if we had the opportunity to make choices (maybe even alternative endings ?). However, this visual novel remains enjoyable all the way through - a fantastic story to remember.",1510601182,1533730270,True,7,0,0.586915314197540283,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- Great writing

Positives: The soundtrack is good ambient music, the credits vocal song and CG artwork are great, the conclusion was very emotional and touching. Including native American language deserves some credit,

Negatives: Having grown up reading Bernard Cornwall's Sharpe novels, and naturally associating the song 'Over the Hills and Far Away' with young British Tommys far from home, I was very disappointed that the protagonist has spent much of his life on the American frontier, losing the potential story of a stranger in a strange land.

A short visual novel that should be included in your history class. 

Playing as William Aubrey, a deserting soldier on the run; you hide in the barn for the harsh weather & execution order for deserting. 
However you find you're not alone, stuck with a Shawnee girl -May, who has too much backbone; you soon find yourself pulling out all your hair in frustration. 

This novel beautifuly displays the clash of cultures, and the awkward interaction between a harsh soldier & a young cunning girl.

[h1] Thumbs Up	[/h1]
The story is good, not totaly original - But far from cliché. 
Haven't seen a VN about the war in 1812 (or about war in general), Indians or their culture - However it heavily depends on an emotional build-up to the climax, which might not work for you. 

The graphic is beautiful - the backgrounds are truly well-made and a lot of details was put into every scene. Especially the facial expressions.

The music is a beautiful orchestrial masterpiece by Yuang Chen. I still listen to the soundtrack once in a while.

I found the text well-written. 
Now since May is a child, and Aubrey is not the most talkative person, the dialoque is rather simple, however that only shows their difference in persona, culture and objectives. 
Aubrey's lack of energy for dealing with May, and his self-pitying will make you laugh, hate and relate. 

[h1] Thumbs Down	[/h1]
Very short - 2-3 hours depending on your reading. 

It could include more history of May's background & culture. However Aubrey doesn't know much about it, and May doesn't tell much, so it'd feel out of place, if there were too much.  
Could be a DLC or extra feature for us who got interested. 

Some people miss branching paths.
- It would be nice with a longer story or alternative endings. [spoiler] Then we can cry more.	[/spoiler]

[h1] Closing Comments	[/h1]
A VN set in original settings, a little short but enjoyable all the way through. 
However like books; it's highly individual how you perceive the story, characters and philosophical aspects. 
Or if you want to re-read the story even while knowing the ending. 

The story has some similarities to Planetarian - the Reverie of a Little Planet-
Recommendable if you liked this clash between a soldier and a girl.

While the story may be slow & lack of engaging dialogue for some players, the interaction between a rude & harsh soldier and a young but cunning Indian girl is well portrayed by how awkward but entertaining it can be. CG artworks are beautiful, but since the game is short, not so many places can be covered, which I find it disappointing.

Das anfangs naiv und fast dümmlich wirkende, aber im Grunde ziemlich schlaue Indianermädchen - es ist schon eine eigenartige, aber eigentlich nicht unglaubwürdige Beziehung zwischen den Beiden (vor allem wenn man das alles in dem historischen Kontext betrachtet).

Pros

- Takes place during a historical period that most people don't care to remember. I searched about it and it's actually a lot more important than people think it is and it's worth reading about.

- The artwork is fantastic. Filled with personality, the details are delicate but rough in the right places and very pleasing to the eyes.

- Since it's a kinetic novel, you can sit back and watch it like a movie with subtitles.

- Story wise, it isn't the most original out there but it's bittersweet and I almost cried. The prose is great.

- The music is also beautiful. I wouldn't mind having the OST. It's orchestra, no synths, which it may not be historically accurate? But it fits.

- The devs also did their research, I absolutely loved how Mai spoke her language, you rarely see Native Americans represented in media and I'm happy to see so much effort in building Mai.

Cons

- Some people may not like that's it a kinetic novel.

- Some may find it too short.

- Some people may hate the tragic theme, especially since it's kind of easy to assume that it will happen.

First of all, props to WarGirl Games to creating such a well polished game for their first title. When I saw OTHAFA I was immediately intrigued by the peculiar visuals and made a guess that this will not be your common visual novel on steam with sexual themes plastered all over the place (not saying that's automatically bad).

The beginning of the novel captured my attention with Mai's playful antics and it just gets better from there. There are many visual novels I've read where the humor seems forced or the dialogue between the characters feel awkward. Fortunately OTHAFA keeps those moments to a minimum and brings you a well written story which seeks to provoke certain emotions from its readers. It did damn good job in doing that. 

The setting is unique for a visual novel, and the author takes advantage of that by weaving it into the characters' backgrounds providing explanations for the characters' actions and feelings. The UI is well made as it does not distract you when you're reading the text. The black bars blended into the background also provide a theater like experience. Another particularly strong point is the music which is well composed and blends well with the intentions of the scenes and artworks.

The only downside is that I feel OTHAFA is fairly short for its asking price, but I also feel the strength of the other parts of the game make up for this loss.

Fantastic music. Beautiful art. Well-written dialogue. 

But, I don't know if the narrative all comes together... the beginning, middle, and end, the recurring dream sequence... are like completely different stories that don't seem to quiiiite thematically/structurally gel. It's hard to go into it without spoilers, but... it makes a really, really, really broad point at the end, but the main two characters aren't meant to metaphorically represent a microcosm or something, so... And there's also an action climax? Which was exciting, but didn't seem necessary and stood out jarringly from the rest of the story.

So, I don't know if I would recommend it to people that aren't already interested, but it's a damn fine VN in craft and has an interesting time and place for one.

Over The Hills and Far Away was a short and warm story, lasted only but 2 hours, yet it was warm enough to leave a good memory of it. 

I typically avoid Visual Novels, and among my friends even bringing up their names are usually tagged with sexual content or the usual ""hundreds of choices and hundreds of ends"". This one was different, as I read from other review, as it required only the left click of your mouse button. Hence, it caught my interest.

*Soundtrack*. As I opened this story, I enjoyed the soundtrack immediately (and in fact bought the DLC). It brought me memories from Guild Wars I, a game I used to play a while ago. It gave life, taste and fragrance to what my eyes would muse on, and animate the artwork in front of me. There were no voices, but I could almost hear their tone shifting as the dialogue followed thanks to the flow of the melody. I could tell it was being repeated only but rarely on different scenarios, but not in the very same one. Hence, all the melodies were well reiused. 

*Artwork*. You won me on the concept art for the girl. Her eyes, her clothes, her quiet personality and the expressions were unique to her like I've never seen before in any story. Trully, she is a one of a kind to this story and to all I've seen in anime over the past years. I wasn't that enchanted by the protagonist himself, but his story made him more interesting. I trully loved the artwork of the house with the rain outside. And in fact, they were really well executed to tell the story. Rich, vivid, it's the kind of art that gives you a starting point and with enough imagination you can write a movie out of it.  

*Story*. Although the VN is left click only without options, the story splits nicely in about I think 3 different dimensions. There is a change of pace between slice of life, past, dream, etc that makes it dynamic enough to avoid boredoom. I wish there was more lore, however, past the end. All those menus and buttoms could have had just an artwork of a diary with logs, telling the story from different lens as you progressed in the story. It wouldn't demand much of sound, artwork, etc. just write up. I think that was the only point of improvement I would suggest to the devs. *e.g. he wanders quite a lot given the nature of the plot, we could have had those buttons being enabled with things he found along the way. Could be, again, just described in written form. 

Also, the burning question, will be there a follow-up? Even text-only? I would gladly buy the book.

p.s.: I almost jumped out of my chair late night with the ""War Girls"" banner popping up and a ""HA!!!!!!!"" coming out of nowhere. Thats some memorable sound you got there tied to your group!",1476946423,1476946423,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That said, I simply can't recommend this game. I don't mind it being short, and I could even forgive the lack of any kind of choice to be made by the player, but the visual aspect of it was incredibly underwhelming and the writing too simplistic. 

The visuals of the game consist of a handful (probably less than ten altogether) background images that accompany the text, with characters superimposed on them when the story calls for it - there isn't much more to it than what you can see in the preview.

Seeing all that, I hoped the writing would be this game's strongest point, but it's just not very well done. Aside from the aforementioned lack of choice - you literally go through the whole game without being to influence it - the characters are incredibly simplistic, and while there is an attempt to give them some kind of depth through their backstories, they just never come across as plausible human beings. They seem to exist only to serve the story, which also can't really decide what it wants to be: it starts out as a variation on the old 'war is hell' theme, and at the very last minute turns into a morality tale about religion and racism. I might be more receptive towards it if the writer had at least known how to write Mei's character, but it's hard to get emotionally involved with the game when the main two characters' dialogue is just so unrealistic: a 11-year girl for whom English is supposedly a second language fluently and eloquently talks to a supposedly  ruthless, adult English soldier who acts like a 15-year-old.

This is a cute short experience of a game if you don't think too much about it, and if you get it on sale, it's not too expensive either.

I enjoyed it more or less, but I can't say I'd encourage anyone else to play it.

I liked Mai, a lot, and since she's the focus for most of the game, it makes it only just playable enough. It'd be nice if it had more depth concerning her language and culture.
The main character though is frankly annoying to play as. Racist, self pitying and all around terrible. It was hard just go get through certain parts of it.

The game presents a few other characters but they're not worth mentioning really as they aren't presented in a way that really encourages the viewer to give a shit about them. Maybe if Aubrey actually told Mai about himself like he wanted to...

Good music, dialogue and art though. Nothing particularly amazing however and there's only a few actual fully illustrated scenes, the majority of the game just a portrait of Mai making cute facial expressions.

Zaten oyunun etiket kısmında belirtilmiş ama ben yine de yazdım. Çünkü benim gibi dalgınlık anınıza gelebilir ve oyunu hemen alabilirsiniz. Oyunu önceden point & click tarzı macera zannedip istek listeme eklemiştim. İndirimi görünce de (3,5 liraydı sanırım) hemen kapmıştım. Yükleyince farkına vardım. Ama neyse ki hikaye güzel çıktı.

Konusu şöyle efendim: Ana karakterimiz William Aubrey, ömrü boyunca kimseye bağlı yaşamamış, her zaman kendi çıkarını ön planda tutmuş, hiçbir değere sahip olmayan ve saygı duymayan bir genç. William'ın gençliğinin baharında 1812 Yılında Amerika'da, Yankeelerin ve İngilizlerin karşı karşıya geldiği 3 Yıl Savaşı (Viki Amca 3 yıl diyor) patlak veriyor. Dönemin şartlarından dolayı karakterimiz bu savaşa katılıyor ve Redcoat dediğimiz İngiliz birliklerinin içinde yer alıyor. William'ın içinde bulunduğu 41. Alay, Kuzeybatı cephesinde Yankeeler tarafından kıyıma uğruyor ve bu kıyımdan bir tek William sağ kurtuluyor. Alayının telef oluşuna şahit olan karakterimiz, bir daha savaşlarda bulunmama kararı alarak asker kaçağı oluyor. Cepheden yaralı ve yorgun olarak ayrılan William, patlak veren fırtınadan korunmak için karşısına çıkan terk edilmiş ahıra sığınıyor. Ahıra girdiğinde ise içeride Mai adında Kızılderili bir kızla karşılaşıyor. Bir sebepten dolayı (söylemeyeyim spoiler olmasın) ailesinden uzağa düşmüş ve evinin yolunu kaybetmiş olan Mai, zamanla William'a ısınıyor ve aralarında ilginç diyaloglar geçiyor, yol arkadaşı oluyorlar.

Oyunun senaryosu gidişat bakımından şaşırtıcı değil. Neler olacağını tahmin edebiliyorsunuz ama önemli kısım da zaten olay örgüsü değil, karakterlerin arasında geçen diyaloglar. Mai'nin Kızılderili bir kız olduğu için ırkından kaynaklı yaşadığı hor görülmeleri, karşılaştığı ithamları oyuncuyu etkileyecek şekilde anlatmışlar. Ayrıca ten, ırk, dış görüntüye dair yapılan kritiklere, hikayelerle eleştiri getirmişler. Dediğim gibi, hikaye gidişatı şaşırtmıyor ancak diyaloglar gerçekten güzel.

Oyunun diline gelince; zor gençler, gerçekten zor. Diyalogları ancak Advanced seviyesinde İngilizce kelime bilgisine sahip biri, sözlükten yardım almadan hemen kavrayabilir. İngilizcem mükemmel değildir ama kötü de değildir. Lakin oyun boyunca elim sürekli telefonun sözlüğündeydi. İngilizceniz çok iyi değilse ve sözlük kullanmak istemiyorsanız almayın. Sürekli skip yapa yapa geçersiniz. İndirimde bile olsa yazık olur paranıza. Ne bileyim, indirimdeki başka bir şeyi alın. Buna boşa para vermeyin.

Çizimler güzel ama müzikler için aynısnı diyemeyeceğim. Benim müzik zevkime hitap etmedi, biraz daha emek verilebilirdi. Oyunu yaparken çok uğraştıkları bir şey yok. Bir iki karakter tiplemesi ve mekan çizimi, bir de hikaye o kadar. Dolayısıyla müziklere azıcık daha çalışsaydınız a dostlar dedim içten içe.

Oyun hakkında yazacaklarım bu kadar. Dediğim gibi, oyun değil görsel roman olmasını ve dilinin ağırlığını dikkate alarak sepetinize ekleyin. Aksi takdirde başarım elde etmek için uğraştığınız bi işkenceye dönüşecek. İyi oyunlar pardon, iyi okumalar! :)",1472681594,1472681902,True,10,0,0.663634955883026123,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On incarne William Aubrey, un soldat anglais pendant la guerre de 1812 en Amérique du Nord. Seul rescapé d'une bataille et blessé, le voilà cherchant un abri pour éviter de subir une tempête. Il va finir par trouver une ferme abandonnée dans laquelle il va rencontrer une jeune Shawnee (amérindienne de la tribu Shawnee). La suite de l'histoire se découvre dans le jeu, je préfère éviter de spoiler.
C'est un jeu assez court et totalement linéaire. On le termine en un peu plus de 3 heures, et il n'y a aucun choix à faire, on ne fait que défiler le texte pour faire avancer l'histoire. Toutefois, l'histoire est différente de ce qu'on a l'habitude de voir dans un VN et c'est un bon point. La palette graphique également joue sur la différence en évitant le style manga.

Overall Score: 7.9/10
Despite it's short length compared to other visual novels in direct competition to it, Over the Hills and Far Away delivers a powerful narrative with relatable characters that make you feel emotionally invested. However, despite it's great story, the lack of choices and multiple endings leave much to be desired. I would recommend this game only if bought on a sale (It's like watching a short TV series except in novelized form).

---
Overall Score: 7.9/10

Gameplay: 7/10
(-3): Lack of choices, No multiple endings, engaging action events, nor unlockables that provide more useful background information on the characters (unlike the Fate/Stay Night VN and Clannad VN which has all)

Story: 9/10
(-1): Out of the many Visual Novels I have already read, I haven't come across any that have stories taking place in early America, let alone during the early establishment days. However, despite the uniqueness of the narrative, I feel like the characters could be more fleshed out. As it is, the story would make a great movie. However, I see wasted potential. I'm sure for many of you who have completed this novel, you probably want to know more about the characters... hell, see the two MC's grow up together. I'm dissapointed the developers haven't even considered a DLC to address this! Come onnnnn! :'(.

Art: 10/10
- Exactly what I'd expect from a Visual Novel's art style. Will age VERY well and likely looks good in any HD displays you may have.
- Very pleasing to the eyes. I absolutely love how the artists did the visual effects on the flashbacks.

Sound/Music: 10/10
- I personally feel the developers excelled greatly in the Music and sound department. I felt extremely immersed in the story with my headphones on when experiencing the story. The quality of the sound and music effects here demonstrate how a visual novel can make a novel EVEN better and more engaging.

Length: 6.5/10
- The story was way too short, especially for the price compared to other visual novels I feel are direct competition to it. Unless you buy this at a REALLY GOOD sale price like I did, you'll probably feel unhappy with how much you've paid versus the experience you'll get. The developer can solve this issue by either releasing a special edition that expands the story or provide a very affortable or free DLC that expands the length of the story.",1469335713,1508459123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a sort of Visual Novel after all ( it doesn't even have choices!).

What this game (or rather ""experience"") does offer is a nice story that will distract from whatever thoughts or worries you may be preoccupied with in the present, and transport you to another world, in the backdrop of the War of 1812. This is a unique story. It's not a cinema, block-buster-esque storyline complete with explosions and giant robot testicles ( must have watched Transformers to appreciate this stupid joke). 

It's more akin to a ""slice of life"" genre, which focuses on the more of the mundane and trivial aspects of life. Of course, the setting is uniquein itself, but the compelling aspect of the game is what I like to call the "" intimacy of small moments"". 

Do you sometimes recall small, stupid memories of your ""girlfriend"" in middle school, that lame dance your sophomore year, that cute girl at the fair you had your first kiss with, and never saw again. Do you remember these moments at the most random times, maybe during your dead-end, god-awful job, and have to try to not to cry? Yeah, this game's kinda like that.

The beauty in those small, hidden stories that take place in the backgdrop of much larger events, that should overshadow that story. But in the end, there is still something very poignant about the small moments of joy and happiness that we are able to create in a world that sometimes feel too big as to being empty,

I won't give any spoilers, but if you want a simple game with gorgeous art, charming characters, enchanting music, and a premise that will make you wonder just exactly how many stories of lovers and friends, how many adventures and journies, how many small moments that really shouldn't matter but will make you cry like a baby - this game will not just tell you, but it will show you just how many of these transient moments happened in the war of 1812.

P.S. I know the girl is young, but... you know... like...,in the old days they didn't really think it was weird.... :) In fact, they encouraged it! Yeah! That's right!

Over The Hills And Far Away is a kinetic novel, meaning there are no choices to be made. You simply either click or auto-progress through the story. It took me about two hours to read through, though I took a couple short breaks.

+ Excellent art. The artwork is consistent stylistically and fits descriptions well. Only complaint here is that I wish there was a bit more.
+ Beautiful soundtrack. The orchestral score both built and melted tension as the story called for it. It layered with the writing without overpowering it. My only complaint sound-wise is that the bird call loop was a little too short and got a bit annoying in one of the sections.

Set in the War of 1812, [i]Over The Hills And Far Away[/i] tells the story of a soldier and a little girl on the run in a harsh and unforgiving world. This game is a kinetic visual novel, meaning there are no choices to be made, the entire experience is reading. While this may not be everyone’s cup of tea the story itself is very much worth it as this is [b]an engrossing piece of historical fiction.[/b]

In the game you follow an Englishman named William Aubrey, a redcoat who was conscripted into the British army and sent to fight in North America. While the game doesn’t require you to be an expert in American history it does require you understand the basics of the period. Aubrey, as the game refers to him, has abandoned his regiment due to its poor leadership and is now wounded, on the run from his own countrymen and American forces. Aubrey takes refuge in an old barn sharing the space with a young native girl.  Finding her name too hard to pronounce, he nicknames her “Mai”. What follows is a touching story of two people from different worlds trying to find the same thing- safety and happiness. [b]Through Mai’s innocence Aubrey becomes slightly less jaded and more aware of the plight of the native people in America[/b], a theme featured heavily in the game.

[b]The artwork in the game is lovely[/b], the models are well done and really express each character’s personality. There aren’t many characters in the game as most of the time is spent with Aubrey and Mai and we rarely see much of Aubrey at all so a lot of the time you are stuck looking at just the background images while reading text. Thankfully, there are a few scattered cutscenes mixed in during certain plot points which add to the visual appeal of the game. The music is also enjoyable, fitting of the time period and location of the story. You can purchase the soundtrack separately as well.

The game is a visual novel and being as there are no choices to be made there is little in terms of gameplay here. The game runs well, all the menus are easy to read and you are given basic options that I feel any visual novel should have; mainly adjusting the text speed and the ability to put the text on autoplay. Since [b]it is a kinetic novel[/b], the autoplay feature allows you to sit back and relax while reading along. The game also has a gallery so that you can look at past cutscenes, concept art and background art at your leisure.

This is an outstanding piece of work, the story is rich and the characters are enjoyable and I found them easy to relate to as well. I enjoyed the historical background of the story, I even learned a few things as well. [i]Over The Hills And Far Away[/i] has many different layers to it, the harshness of war, the treatment of native people, a person’s own struggle to find where they belong but it’s all told wonderfully in this visual novel format with great art and music to move along with the story. [b]The game also has Steam trading cards and achievements[/b] that you can easily get by just playing through the story so that is also an added bonus. It may not be the happiest of stories, but most happy stories to come out of war are despite the war, not because of it.  It’s worth reading, so open yourself up to something new.

Interesting setting, well-defined characters, lush artwork, and a strong soundtrack carry the narrative, but I thought that the main narrative was a bit cliched.

I do, however, think that it could've been longer (as you can see by my play time, I didn't manage to rack up the hours other reviewers have), and more well-developed thematically (Mai's monologue at the end especially hinted at some interesting themes that could've been expanded). I also would've liked a bit more background about the characters to make the final confrontation a bit more satisfying. Alternate endings or routes likewise would've rounded out the experience. 

Overall, it's one of the more enjoyable visual novels on Steam, and if you can catch it on sale (I wouldn't pay full price for something of this length), it's a good way to spend an afternoon.

-Strong, endearing, believably drawn protagonists 
-Rich artwork

-Interesting setting 

Cons 
-Too short 
-Somewhat cliche plotline

Just to be clear this is a visual novel the the strict sense of the term, there is no interaction and there is just one path through the tale. That said it is well written and as mentioned above takes place in a part of history I wasn't even aware of, which is a plus. The direction of the plot is a little predictable and the game is quite short, but I enjoyed my time with it. The music and sound effects really at to the atmosphere and the writing is reasonably solid. It's worth checking out, especially when it's on sale.

I think it was just over $5. I am not through with it as of the time of this writing and will probably not update my review, but I can tell that I am close to the end. This is a good story, decent writing, some humour, some heartbreak, really puts you in the moment of what is happening to the characters. Can't speak of the ending yet as again, I am not there, but the majority of the game has been good. While there is little interactivity, they really do add things to the story visually and audiotorilly (not sure what the right word is here) that enhance the experience more than if you were reading it out of a book. Character portraits, moving character portraits, maps, sounds of random stuff like hiccuping or door creaking, shaking the camera when someone falls or snatches something out of someones hand, shadows from the sun shining through the trees, little flames shooting up from a fire, etc. Some of the art is absolutely beautiful and some seems a little less well done, but none of it is bad imo. It just seems rather inconsistent in quality but this does not detract from the novel much. The real draw here is the setting. I don't think I've ever seen a setting in a video game about this time period (war of 1812) that was story based. Just a very unique visual novel and if you can get it for around 5 bucks it is totally worth it. $9 seems a tad expensive for around 3-4 hours of content but the story is quite good so who knows maybe you will value it more.


EDIT: Sooo I wasn't going to update this at all but the ending really blew me away. It was brilliantly done. Saying anything more than that is borderline spoilers but IMO the ending sequence, art, and ending song on the credits are really beautiful.

BUT, that does not make it a bad game in my Opinion. It was an enjoyable read and followed a setting that I find intriguing, that being the War of 1812.

Since Reviews should have some Pros and Cons, I guess I can provide that:

Pros:
-Nice Character designs and Backgrounds
-Good character writing (But can come off as kind of generic for some of them)
-Interesting story (Better if you aren't like me who thinks too much about it and winds up unsurprised at the end)
-Music isn't annoying and blends in with the story
-Unique Setting. Not many games are set during the War of 1812. Although it has been glossed over in most nation’s histories (UK and US, minus the Star Spangled Banner and MAYBE the White House Burning.) It has become important for Canadians and their national Identity. (Half con, an idea not brought out in the game but would have been unrelated to the story) For that, I give it props.

Cons:
-Short. Lasted me around three hours, and a lot of that was because I kept the game running from time to time while I was away. Probably shorter if you're a fast reader.
-No replayablitiy since it's a linear game with no branching paths. I would only replay it if I wanted to re-read the story, but I highly doubt I will.
-Sometimes the Grammar is a little off and can cause you to sit there being like ""What the fuck do they mean?"" or something. (Bad for Grammar Nazis probably)

*MINOR SPOILERS BELOW*

Historical Nitpicks *MINOR SPOILERS* (I have some Knowledge of War of 1812 History and found some small unimportant issues, but it’s fun to nitpick them anyway) *MINOR SPOILERS*:
-US Rank insignia displayed improperly. A Captain in the US Army is represented with One Epaulette (The fringy things on the shoulder) on the Right Arm, not Two on both. Both shoulders indicate Staff Officers from Major to Colonel.
-Aubrey’s Uniform is a little weird. For a man in the Enlisted ranks to have BOOTS of all things is strange, he’s probably have shoes and spats on instead. I don’t think his uniform matches with the Regiment he served in, but I always get a little lost with those details.
-General Proctor does suck.
- Where is his Captain’s Hat? Americans love their massive Officer hats. Also, I dislike the lack of Shako representation.

The two are from different cultures and at first, have difficulties understanding each other.  But for survival, they need to depend on each other to make it through.

Meanwhile, Blue Coats led by their cold leader are in search for a sole Red Coat for some apparent reason.

Over the Hills and Far Away, a debut kinetic visual novel by War girl Games focuses on the aftermath of a battle when the British Empire suffered a major defeat and Procter abandoned his army. Our protagonist, William Aubrey survived the battle and has ran to an abandoned farmhouse where he meets a young Shawnee girl called Mai hiding from the storm.

[u]Themes  and Characters[/u]

The characters are well defined in the short time we spend with them. We get a real sense of their personalities, motives and backgrounds. The story has some light touches  thanks to the character of young Mai, a counterpart to the world weary and cynical Aubrey. Mai, despite being a smart cookie and resilient, in her childish actions delivers some sweet, funny moments. She remains upbeat throughout the story which rubs off on Aubrey. He may try to convince himself of his selfish intentions  but I see Mai as Aubrey's first trajectory for the redemption he seeks.

Home and Identity are two strong themes running through this story. Aubrey feels like an alien in a fractured country and is looking for his own place to belong and call home. Their methodologies may vary but both he and Jackson are both looking for independence, home and freedom. Mai, on the other hand has a strong sense of home and belonging from her religious beliefs and community.

[u]Music and Artwork[/u]

There is a lovely use of orchestral music by Seycara Music and Arts . It is not intrusive and matches the ambience for each moment. A particular standout piece I noticed is the field scene. The final song at the credits, After All, have some lovely vocals by Sagispon. The artwork doesn't have the usual anime aesthetics instead opting for a soft, muted pastel look. It makes good use of tones, light and attention to detail.

[u]Conclusion[/u]

The game is short running at around the three hour mark but is within the normal steam price range. Despite the shortness I feel that it was the correct length and successfully managed to get a sense of the characters and the story. History would tell you a different story about how about how most Native Indians were treated but if Disney can do it with Tiana in Disney's Princess  and the Frog why can't War Girl Games? They both want to give us some heart warming entertainment. so we should let it go...

Wait. That was 4, wasn't it? After finishing the game, over all is good. The climax scene is a little off though.
