There's no platforming mechanics here, instead you simply move up and down (and backwards and forwards) as the screen flies by.  If ]you get stuck against a wall when it scrolls off screen, you die.   If you survive, you ""win"", although perhaps ""winning"" here is generous.  You play a cog spinning wildly, which is probably entertaining for someone but not sure who.  What do you want to be when you grow up? A cog!

Technically the game has a lot of issues that fall below minimum required standard for PC.  The console port is badly done.  While the game runs smoothly, you have fixed resolution and can't remap your controls.   Developers need to learn the PC is not another console, and not every PC gamer has an Xbox gamepad plugged in.   $7 is an unforgivable price to charge for a bad console port, especially when they're competing at the very bottom of the gaming ecosystem against games like  Flappy Bird and Temple Runner.",1537271127,1618388199,False,2,1,0.390425711870193481,0,False,False,False,False,,,
