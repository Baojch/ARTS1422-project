The obvious main purpose for buying an exercise bike is for, well - exercise.  What I really love about VirZOOM is the fact that the magic of VR makes me forget that I am exercising.  I find myself pedaling  for a solid hour, and not even thinking about the fact that I am exercising.  I find I can get my heart rate up and keep it at the desired level with active VR games like the cycle race simulations, and then if I need a more passive period of time to catch my breath, a circuit around the koi pond for 10 minutes allows for some cooldown.  The tank games hold my attention, and the race car requires some fast and heart pounding pedaling.  So the diversity of the experiences holds my interests well.

No denying that the cost of this experience if very high.  Counting the cost of my HTC Vive, the computer I needed to buy to run VR software effectively and the $400 for the VirZOOM stationary bike, this is not a cheap exercise program.  But, I’ve spent similar amounts of cash on gym memberships over time and found reasons to give up on the gym.  The variety and distraction ability of a VR exercise platform convinces me that this is an exercise regimen that I will stick with, I will enjoy and that will prove cost effective in terms of health benefits.  I’m a fan of VirZOOM.  It has been worth the investment for me.

I WANT TO DO MORE - but I need to dry off and cool down.  I'm then excited to get back into it and do more. 

Pros:

1. support staff is UNSURPASSED. I chat dialy with them like friends. They're very interested in feed back and implimenting it.

2. EASILY setupup the unit and INSTANT auto connect to the computer.  I just plugged in a little USB dongle.  No syncing no bs... just said pull both tiggers to get started.

3. Games are good... they do what they're desired to do.  There is room for improvement but they are working on it. (stats displayed during play more varied options etc).

4. REALLY works and makes workouts fun. 

5. has learderboards  and the reason I bought it... has  STRAVA.COM  link/sync.  I use strava extensively for my real world cycling. 

6. WELL BUILT - has good tension feel...  setup easily in 15 minutes without opening the instructions. 


Cons: 

1. Software needs more polish, menus are often blank or repeat the same things over and over. (they're working on that) I beleve this is to ""LEAVE SPACE"" for more games!   Instead of blanks they list the same game on all 6 sides of the rotating VR menu. 

2. I'm not totally keen on LEANING to steer.  I think I can live with it if it were made more sensitive. (I requested they add that or a option so each person can adjust sensitivity).

3. At this point none of the 8 buttons are used?  But better than being short buttons.  They haven't needed to be implimented yet.  Tiggers are all that's really used at this point.

4. ITS YOUNG just released and will take a few months to really polish up the system.

5, Games are (mini) but surely we can't expect 8 AAA titles in a few months this has been in development. The concept is not to GAME - but to work out without thinking about it. They do that...

The bike is surprisingly solid, except for the buttons on the front of the handlebars which feel a bit cheap. Maybe for this reason, none of the games in the VirZOOM arcade right now seem to use these buttons at all. From what I can tell, only the right and left triggers are used. 

The games feel a bit like something a talented kid made over summer break: there's nothing wrong with them but they're quite simple, the graphics and sound design feel decidedly--well, home-grown would be a nice way to put it, and they seem to be pretty bug-ridden. That, and the UI is clunky and sometimes unfriendly. But the foundation is all there, and it's solid. You can pedal to move, and lean left and right to steer. It works. And hey, it's a new idea and even giant development houses still come out with stuff that's much worse. Right out of the box it already has a bunch of different games to play, which is something, even if the games in this first batch are not amazing. I think with time and polish, this could be something great. I fully expect there to be a killer game for the VirZoom sooner or later. 

I'm imagining a game like Euro Truck simulator where you take a cross-country bike tour through real places with real scenery. Or something that looks like Hover Junkers where you fly a pedal-powered helicopter around an open world with realistic (but forgiving) physics and the propeller actually synced to your pedals. The potential for there to eventually be something really fun that offers more than ""collect the boxes and earn the points until the timer is finished"" is great enough for the investment to be worth it, I think. 

Today I played for 40 minutes on my first test and went through the tutorials for all of the included games. After looking at them all, there are none that I'm really dying to play again, but I also wasn't too tired to continue. If I had been pedaling on the bike normally I definitely would have given up before 40 minutes. With the right game or environment to keep me engaged I could easily ride this thing for hours.

Ну и анекдот о ковбоях:

[quote]Скачет ковбой по прерии, удирает от индейцев, вдруг внутренний голос: ""Отклонись вправо"".  Ковбой отклонился — мимо просвислела стрела.  — Отклонись влево.  Опять мимо пролетает стрела.  — Слезь с лошади.  Ковбой слезает.  — Сними джинсы и наклонись.  Ковбой наклоняется и тут ему в жопу втыкается стрела.  — А—а—а—а—а, за что? Больно!!!  — Зато ДЖИНСЫ ЦЕЛЫ!!![/quote]
