That's really all there is to this.  It looks and feels like someone's homework assignment (they failed the class and were kept back a year).  It's an incredibly shallow experience with no merit or value as a game for gamers.  Worth bearing in mind the ""developer"" is charging money for this, there's a million better free games.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy minimalist/untextured low-polygon ""retro"" assets and visuals, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the early 1990s.  The lack of textures is a method that lazy devs often use to disguise their lack of talent/interest in doing the graphics properly and trying to disguise it under the name of ""art"", or ""We made it look bad on purpose"", which really isn't something gamers should have to put up with.  It's unclear why the developers weren't willing to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets and high resolution textures for the game.  It looks bad as a result of their decisions, and that's just another reason to avoid it.

This seems to have been made a VR exclusive to prevent any comparison with non-VR 3D games, a comparison that this game would fail very badly at.  Developers must learn that while VR is great, if the only thing that makes the game great is the VR, then the game isn't great at all.

""Human, we have a problem"" didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for fiddling with the windmill, you can do this within 3 seconds of starting the game, but less than 1/3rd of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

The poor quality of this game is also reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""Human, we have a problem"" has the total exorbitant ripoff price of $10 USD, for which you could easily get any number of older AAA games.  I'm not joking, they really think this game is worth $10, the same money could get you Frostpunk or Mass Effect on sale.  This is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.  Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

The help button was shit and did the opposite of help so for those who are also unsure what to do here's a little ""help"" for you to play this game.

1 - Once you find yourself standing in a fenced area with some balls on the ground look straight ahead and down at the control panel in front of you.

2 - click on the exit button 

3- uninstall as quickly as you can and never look back.

Seriously once I worked out you pick the balls up and put in a box, then grab the sling shot and just pull back on it and fire.
