It’s also something a little different. A game with a concept where you must literally draw your own solutions. Of course, you are provided with suggestions in some of the puzzles and are left to your own devices to draw them. The title has the potential to create a very enjoyable game and it’s final release is one that I await with anticipation.

The big positive is that the game has the potential to be a very calming and soothing game. Drawing and illustrating has for a long time been considered a relaxing psychological activity. I can definitely see where this has the potential to be perfect in that type of a way. However, at this stage of development it doesn’t provide that sensation for me although the potential is there for everyone to see.

The problems in this stage of development are major sticking points for me and outweigh the game’s potential. First, what you perceive to be as the right solution may not be. It took me about fifty attempts to draw the oar for the boat in the first scene. So many of my drawings the game recognized as sabers, swords or even bombs that killed my special little blue guy resetting the puzzle completely. Ultimately it took me loading a YouTube video before I was able to successfully complete the first level. I would argue that the game has too large a library of images to draw upon at this stage of development. As a result close never feels good enough and that can be eternally frustrating if you’re not the most talented artist or your idea looks the slightest bit different than that of Rekubratskiy.

Further, I have a big problem with the fact that you have to press the control key to actually draw which diverts some attention away from the act of drawing itself. I’m used to playing video games but have never been much of an artist therefore I must qualify what I say as being from the perspective of a gamer rather than that of an illustrator. In fact, back in my school years my art teachers would consistently advise my mother that I was much better off doing other ‘brain work’ (maths, English, sciences, etc.) than sitting in on their classes. Interesting concepts for art work were always in my head but I lacked the technical ability to convert the image onto the paper or whatever craft work we were in the process of working on during that time. I’ve always been much better at the written word. I am reminded of that here because constantly focusing my left hand on control forces me to put less than one hundred percent focus onto what the drawing hand is doing. Surely there are superior ways to enable players to draw than drawing their attention away from this facet.

At this stage the game gets a pass (a tentative negative) from me but is certainly one to keep an eye on.

Note: This review has no bearing on the fact that my first two installs came without an executable file or the DLLs required to run the game. That problem was solved rather quickly.
