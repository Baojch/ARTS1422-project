Story is engaging and benefits from terrific english voice acting, 
Npc's have good dialogue and motivate you to explore the world to fulfill some of their side quests.
Boss battles are a ton of fun, they arent too easy but also not crazy difficult. They can be pretty difficult later on in the game (i played on normal difficulty) but most of the difficulty can be mitigated by reaching certain levels for your character (Adol) and your gear.
OST as with any ys game is great, although this game may have less notable tracks in the OST compared to other ys games. 
Graphics are dated but fit the game very well and are not an eyesore by any means.

I played a bit when I was younger, but I truly discovered it in the past years. All games in the series are worth a playthrough and they all have common qualities, although each game feels unique (even if you play the same character -Adol Christin- in most of them!)

Common strengths of the series are: the consistently excellent music; the quick and exciting gameplay, coupled with satisfying level progression; the relatively small scope of each game, especially before the modern party-based entries; the excellent writing and worldbuilding, including an epic story, strong plot twists and a good amount of cheeky humour.

Here's my personal and very subjective list of what to play in the Ys series. Just know that they are all standalone games, and are not published in chronological order of the story.

**MUST-PLAY TIER 
- YS ORIGIN: If you're playing only one, I think it should be this one: as the last game made before modern party-based titles, Origin sits perfectly between Ys eras, and the game itself is set centuries before the rest of the series, offering a good understanding of its foundational lore. It also has 3 interwoven stories that work well together, if you're willing to replay the game.

- YS I & II: The games that started it all! They're not my ultimate pick because of the outdated mechanics and high difficulty limiting their accessibility, but all the strong foundations of the future series are there! All the details I love are already there, like the journal with fun 1-paragraph character descriptions, the weapons and armors grid display, the satisfying progression, the killer soundtrack and so on. 

- YS IV: MEMORIES OF CELCETA: I love Ys IV, its setting and the organic progression of the plot. Compared to ""old Ys"", this is one of the longer modern party-based entries, where you control more than one character. It is a re-imagining of an older Ys IV from the 90's, and as such it is the technical successor of Ys Seven. 

**SHOULD-PLAY TIER 
- YS VI: ARK OF NAPISHTIM: I was surprised how much I enjoyed Ys 6, as it was released a while ago and is technically weaker than Origin and Oath in Felghana, but it has a very strong setting and story. It's not ""must-play"" for me because of its somewhat unbalanced progression, some plot holes in an otherwise excellent story, and a bland endgame boss. 

- YS: OATH IN FELGHANA: I don't love this one as much as other people do, but it is a very nice game if you already have love for the series. The unbalanced progression and unfair boss difficulty prevents it from being an instant recommendation for me, but it's also a great reimagining of the old Ys III: Wanderers from Ys on SNES.

- YS SEVEN: I honestly thought I would hate this one, but I was wrong! I love that it comes right after the Ys VI story, including some recurring characters. It is the first of the party-based era of ""modern Ys"", with somewhat rough but efficient mechanics, and your friend Dogi the wall-breaker as a playable character for the first time! Even with a lot of clichés all around the place, it is still a strong and very satisfying entry.

- Finally, I didn't play VIII or IX yet, but from reviews and my own experience with the series, I'm pretty sure they are very much worthy of your time and money!",1710463601,1710828451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

实际上游戏流程就9个小时左右，其他时间都是以前没玩挂卡的时间。
我个人没玩过伊苏3原版，这个重置版剧情感觉一般，没什么亮点。
这次的故事舞台是在多奇的故乡，阿豆19岁的故事，前面已经经历了伊苏1跟2还有伊苏4树海了，阿豆也变得成熟了不少。
制作时间是伊苏6之后，起源之前，所以能看到很多起源跟6代的影子。
6F0感觉都是一个战斗系统框架。
这是我玩过历代最难的伊苏，哪怕是普通难度都非常折磨，像我这种伊苏老玩家习惯困难起手能改难度后期改噩梦的简直太难了。
绝大部分BOSS这一作难度都非常高，在没拿到土属性手镯无敌技能之前，大部分BOSS的难度甚至感觉比魂类游戏难多了，就算有土属性手镯无敌技能，后期很多BOSS难度还是很高，特别是最终BOSS不熟悉机制的情况死个7到10次以上都很正常。
BOSS战难度高即是缺点也是优点，好几个BOSS给我留下了深刻印象，打起来真的太刺激了。
地图中还有一堆跳跳乐，充斥着大量恶意的跳跳乐，有的地方跳失败就直接回到起点要从头开始跳。。

Classic action, classic adventure, classic charm, and mostly classic boss fights. Its a classic!  A remake from the ground up of the 3rd Ys game and much, much better for it.

[u][h3] Welcome to the Land of Legend [/h3][/u]
Adol, our playable character, arrives back at the homeland of his companion and friend, Dougi, and finds much is wrong. The town Dougi knew and the friends he grew up with are not the same and something sinister is afoot. Beasts all over the shop, a crisis in mining, and a seeming return of an ancient evil threaten the island and the return of the hero is demanded. Time to step up!  

What follows is a fairly routine, but by no means bad, classic adventure story-line. Damsels to save, a lurking evil orchestrated by a high official, heroic cycles, ancient armaments, and a decent rival story. Not too shabby, but no one is going to be surprised here

[u][h3] Is Your Blood Pumping Yet? [/h3][/u]
The gameplay is where its at in Ys. Fast paced, combo heavy, almost...[i]soulslike[/i]. There are tells, timings, weaknesses and its all at hyper speed. The faint of heart will be heavily tested here, but once it clicks it sticks. The bosses in particular stand out, each generally playing differently and its easy to gain that ""flow state"" any action game strives for. All this tied into the sound and music design are simply [i]*chefs kiss*[/i]. Speaking of music...

[u][h3] Put on Your Headphones [/h3][/u]
Its a known thing that most Falcom games (developers for Ys: Oath in Felghana) have incredible scores and this title is no slouch. Overworld themes promise mystery, while bosses sport music sure to fire you up for the challenge ahead. Driving where it needs to be, calm and cozy when at town, somber during the down parts and lurking terror for the final areas, this is a score that soars. Combine this with punchy sounds for swinging swords and bass filled booms when something kabooms and its great.  Truly elevates the experience

[u][h3] Not the Prettiest Picture, But... [/h3][/u]
The visuals are really the only slouch and given the games age, [i]and that its is a psp port[/i] I think it holds up fine. The character model look kinda like lego guys, or some of the earlier playstation models, but the backgrounds do some heavy lifting. While it doesn't have the highest poly count it does have a unified art direction and that's almost always better. This case is no different. Once youre used to it you'll forget this is an old game youre playing. 

[u][h3] The Bottom Line [/h3][/u]
Ys: The Oath in Felghana is great! a solid 8, with some room to be placed maybe a touch higher. its hard, but rewarding, and combines just about all the elements of this happy medium for a fantastic action experience.

I’m a big Ys fan. I love the series greatly. The mixture of excellent action RPG elements, great controls, superb music, and an authentic challenge truly establish the games as classics. Ys: Oath in Felghana is a remake of the third game in the series – Wanderers from Ys. First released on PC, Ys: Oath had excellent graphics, smooth controls, and a redone story that re-imagined everything about Wanderers. In short, they made a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.

[b]Story[/b]

Ys: Oath in Felghana takes place two years after the events in Ys Books I & II. Adol and his stalwart companion, Dogi, have been wandering from town to town (hence the original version’s title of Wanderers from Ys) when they learn about trouble in Dogi’s homeland, Felghana. Curious, they take a boat to the island and immediately encounter monsters. After saving Dogi’s childhood friend, Elena, from a pack of wolves, they head to the village of Redmont and learn that the monsters are just the tip of the iceberg. For the last decade or two, the lord of the land, Count McGuire has been levying high taxes and impressing townsfolk into service building his castle. To top it off, he recently shut down the Tigray Quarry and Redmont’s main source of income: raval ore. To top it off, the Mayor is trapped in the Quarry and needs a rescuin’. What’s a red-haired swordsman to do?

I appreciated how Falcom re-imagined the story for the remake of what most fans consider the black sheep of the series. Characters have been given more depth and more distinctive personalities, events have been made more coherent, there’s a plot twist that you won’t likely see coming, and it’s overall more dramatic. In addition, the translation was nearly flawless. XSEED purchased it from a fan, Jeff Nussbaum, who originally did the translation so that other English-speaking fans could enjoy the PC version of the game. Having played the PC version with that translation, I can see where XSEED massaged and improved upon Nussbaum’s work, and in the end, it’s a polished product. While it’s not a revolutionary story, it’s still worth the price of admission.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The Ys series has always been known for its excellent gameplay. For the most part it doesn’t do anything new, but rather takes already solid elements and hones them to a razor’s edge. Ys: Oath takes the mechanics from Ys VI and throws in nice little tweaks without changing what I consider to be some of the best action gameplay out there.

The game takes a three-fourths overhead view with Adol going from area to area, running around, and slicing things up with his sword. Adol moves fast and attacks even faster, which is incredibly satisfying. Defeating enemies nets you experience and gold/item drops from time to time. These items take the form of herbs and potions that give you immediate benefit when you pick them up. Some will raise your defense, some your attack, and some your magic restoration rate. In addition, the more hits you rack up, the higher your experience multiplier, to a maximum of 1.99. Money and raval ore can be used back in town to purchase and upgrade your weapons and armor.

Adol can also use three types of elemental magic: fire, wind, and earth. Finding certain bracelets gives the player access to these abilities, and finding the proper enhancement gems powers them up. While I wound up relying on the wind magic most of all, all three types are required at various points throughout the adventure, yet I never felt they were gimmicky.

Of course the main thing any Ys fan should be wondering about is the bosses. I’m happy to say that they are challenging without being impossible; in other words, Ys bosses. The nice thing, though, is that when you change the difficulty level on the game, the bosses will change their patterns and do new things. I found this change refreshing as it allowed me to challenge myself while still facing something familiar. Add to that a New Game + mode which allows you to port over certain things from your last playthrough, and you’ve got a solid game with enough replay value to make it worthwhile.

[b]Graphics[/b]

I know I’m gonna get flak for this, but I had a tough time dealing with the graphics in Ys: Oath. Primarily, this is a function of playing on the PSP’s tiny screen. The PC version was beautiful, with well-textured polygons and cute, distinct sprites. Unfortunately, the jump to the small screen causes a lot of that crispness to be lost and I often had difficulty determining what the enemies were or even where they were. In a fast-paced game such as this, these graphical problems really put a dent in my ability to play. I also don’t take into consideration the ability to play on a TV; this is a handheld system, I rate it as such.

One thing that does survive the transition in tact is the character portraits. They’re all done beautifully and manage to convey the characters’ expressions quite well. There is also a portrait gallery that you can unlock as you beat different difficulty levels, and a bestiary with pictures of all the enemies. These little touches help to offset the negative aspects somewhat.

[b]Sound/Music[/b]

Ys games have always been known for their amazing soundtracks, and Ys: Oath is no exception. Sound team JDK managed to take the one saving grace from Wanderers – the music – and give it a complete facelift. The result is an amazing score, that ranges from melancholy piano solos to expansive orchestral pieces, and of course JDK’s trademark hard rock. The re-envisioning of the original tracks was done flawlessly, and there is no bad music to be found. Furthermore, the game will come with a soundtrack that includes two older renditions of the original’s music. You can’t lose there.

Where you can lose is in the area of voice acting. One of the changes from the PC version is a heavy dose of voice acting. Every character in the game (save Adol) gets at least one instance of voice dialog. The only problem is that it’s a crapshoot as to whether that acting is good, bad, or meh. Characters such as Dogi, Elena, and Chester are voiced quite well, whereas Margo, Anya, and Cynthia are badly overacted. Most of the others are just mediocre.

I think the addition of voice acting was a good move, but the quality is so inconsistent as to make it almost a wash.

[b]Control[/b]

Good controls are a staple of the Ys games. While I found Ys VI to be the pinnacle of the series in terms of controls, Ys: Oath was a close second… on the PC. On the PSP, however, control does suffer due to the lousy analog nub. Adol weaves around as if he were drunk (and I’m quoting the manual here), and sometimes the analog nub makes it difficult to get him to move where I want. I can switch to the D-pad, but I shouldn’t have to. In addition, some button combinations required awkward finger placement to execute, and this is not something I wanted to deal with when fighting a particularly nasty boss or navigating treacherous landscapes.

Aaaahh, Ys. Le série de jeux que tous les webos du monde, un tant soient peu fans d'action, me vendaient depuis des années comme étant le meilleur jRPG temps réel au monde. Et quand je leur demandais lequel en particulier, tous répondaient: Oath in Felghana. Ainsi débuta ma rencontre avec Ys.

Et il faut avouer que ce Ys est vraiment un très bon jeu. Il s'agit d'un jRPG à huit-clos, très carré niveau personnalisation, assez minimaliste, mais avec de l'explo de donjons et surtout des combats blindés d'action et des boss bien retors. Un seul village entouré des donjons du jeu, toujours les même personnages, au bout d'une heure n'importe quel joueur aura appréhendé la spatialisation des lieux et saura très rapidement où aller, en fonction des requêtes des PNJ. On rentre donc très rapidement dans l'univers du jeu, et l'impression de faire partie de cette histoire est vraiment forte, tellement tout le lore tourne autour de notre petite personne. C'est aussi un peu dommage, car ceux qui apprécient les voyages, découvrir de nouvelles contrées, de nouvelles coutumes, resteront sur leur fin. Mais en échange, l'implication dans le monde, en tant que joueur, est vraiment réussi.

Pis viennent les premiers donjons, et donc les premiers combats. C'est hyper nerveux, et malgré un gameplay plutôt simple (saut, attaque, pouvoir magique), tout le panel de mouvement est utile à maitriser, à utiliser en fonction des faiblesses des ennemis. Les boss sont des cas d'école, avec des patterns assez simples à comprendre, relativement difficile à contrer, mais une fois qu'on a compris, c'est que du bonheur et ça pète dans tous les sens. L'exploration des donjons est assez linéaire, mais c'est toujours plaisant de découvrir un petit secret par ci par là entre deux phases d'actions.

Pour ce qui est des points négatifs, je citerai la durée du vie du jeu, à savoir 10h en normal, sachant que j'ai bien galéré sur certaines phases, dont un boss en particulier qui m'aura pris plus d'une heure. Cependant, il y a plein de modes de difficulté, et ceux qui voudront prolonger l'expérience pourront montrer à quel point ils sont kikitoutdur avec les difficultés les plus élevées, qui me font cauchemarder juste à y penser. Et il existe même un mode boss rush pour ceux qui ont kiffé. Pour les moins persévérants par contre, il faut noter que le mode ""très simple"" se fait les doigts dans le nez, et inclut quelques options du genre la quicksave ou l'impossibilité de tomber dans les trous.

Parce que oui, le second défaut, c'est les phases de plateforme. Elles ne sont pas très punitives puisque si le joueur chute, il ne meurt pas mais tombe juste plus bas dans le donjon ( = perte de temps + énervement), mais METTRE DES PHASES DE PLATEFORME DANS UN JEU EN VU ISO C'EST VRAIMENT UNE IDÉE DE MERDE. Bon, c'est pas rédhibitoire non plus, en s'appliquant un minimum on s'y fait, mais pour avoir essayé de speedrun le jeu lors d'une seconde partie en ""très facile"", j'ai bien pété les plombs sur ce point en particulier.

Mais au delà de ça, Ys Oath in Felghana est vraiment une excellente surprise. Un ""petit"" jeu, mais ultra maitrisé. Qui m'aura beaucoup fait penser à Castle in the Darkness tellement tout est pensé au pixel près par les développeurs.",1701549156,1701549156,True,3,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False,True,,,

If not, it's only competitor (Origin) uses the same combat system in a slightly different, more contained environment. Everything that makes the game good is done just as well here, if not better.

While the skills you obtain later in the game make some of the bosses a little easier to approach (because you have more mobility), the difficulty never really lets off, and the last boss offers one of the more satisfying encounters in the entire game.

The story, characters, environment, music, graphics, and combat are all strong to excellent here, and they make the challenge worth it. And everything is paced just right: the game took me just over 12 hours on Normal, and that was with me trying to find a bunch of secrets. Some may look at that and frown, but I appreciate that Felghana never wastes my time. Instead, it gives me awesome location after awesome location with tough opponents, light puzzles, and fantastic bosses.

The level design was great, with wonderful pacing and a surprisingly good sense of scale at times. It took inspiration from its roots as a remake of a sidescrolling game and had some parts where it switched to pseudo sidescrolling perspective as well (long before Nier did the same thing! neat), and the platforming is a big step up from how it felt in Ys VI. The music was fantastic as always, it slaps so hard that it really keeps the momentum going as you sprint through each dungeon. The portrayal of small communities is always a highlight in Ys games, and this one is no different, and while it only has the one town this time, it does a good job of giving each resident of Redmont their own little story arc. The combat mostly felt better than Ys VI's did, with tighter control and more interesting abilities that integrate into your combos more smoothly, but the boss fights were a bit rough (occasionally more than a bit rough, like the final boss). The story was pretty standard stuff, but the addition of extremely hammy anime dub-esque voice acting helps elevate it a bit.

So while it was a super well-paced game game with great, simple-but-deep combat mechanics and a banger ost, it felt less like it had its own identity compared to Ys VI and Ys Origin. It is simply a good ""one of these."" but since no other action RPGs have the same energetic enthusiasm, the same chutzpah Ys does, it's still a great time to play.

伊苏系列的战斗模式变更了几次，每个模式都有人喜欢有人讨厌，这作是前面05年作品的重制移植版，用了和起源相同的系统，所以打完起源的很建议继续游玩誓约，会很容易上手。

剧情方面是多奇带亚特鲁去自己故乡勘察异变，由此发生了各种各样的剧情，因为是rpg，所以剧情方面留待自己去体验。整体的剧情还算流畅，不过也很容易感受到老版日式rpg的一些拖沓吧，而且这是多年前的重制，很多地方并没有现在游戏的便利，参考起源，所以游玩时候需要一些耐心。

战斗方面玩过起源的话也没有太多可以说的，没玩过的，上手也不难，大体就是普通攻击加上三种额外属性攻击，装备更换和锻造系统，打不过去强化肯定没毛病。传统的二段跳，突刺各种熟练应用，多注意地形问题，都是arpg的老生常谈，相信不会太难。

音乐方面老游戏很多制作还是很精良的，好像是有ost的，游玩过后，喜欢的可以去找找看，最后战斗的音乐也挺激动的。因为是一个系统，所以ui之类也没有可说太多的。

最后作为一款经典老游戏，能接受这种风格的还是尝试一下吧，虽然时代变了，游戏也越来越多，但是值得回味的好游戏，老游戏还是很多的，新游戏玩累了，不妨回来找找这些老游戏体验一轮，或许会找回最简单的快乐。",1691849770,1691849770,True,2,0,0.53608250617980957,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Everyone who recommends this game to Ys newcomers is absolutely evil. I honestly would leave a neutral review on this game if I had the option to, as I think its a bit overpraised. I do not like it as much as the other Ys games as it has extremely questionable level design (relative enemy placement/strength to checkpoints) and doesnt really do a good job of telling the player when they need an equipment upgrade to make a boss doable.

I've seen a lot of people complain about only doing 1 damage to bosses because they didnt know when to go looking for a new weapon or level up. Personally the bosses are a bit overtuned in general as far as HP / Damage goes, the fights themselves are excellent dont get me wrong (some of the best in the series ive played so far imo), its just they take way too long and become more of an endurance test than a test of your abilities. It promotes unfun strategies like walking back and forth from the checkpoint to farm levels until enemies dont give you anymore xp. You don't HAVE to do this obviously, but not doing it might tack on another 5-10m to the boss. It makes the amazing bosses more frustrating to fight than enjoyable, especially when you have to fight two almost back to back (Lava zone lol, this area sucks).

Originally released in 2005 for the PC in Japan, the game was later remade and released for the PC in English in 2012.

One of the standout features of Ys: The Oath in Felghana is its fast-paced and engaging gameplay. The game follows the story of Adol Christin, a red-haired adventurer who travels to the land of Felghana to investigate a series of mysterious events. The game's combat system is intuitive and satisfying, with a range of weapons and special abilities that allow players to take on a variety of enemies.

The game's graphics and soundtrack are also impressive, with detailed and vibrant environments that are a joy to explore. The game's music is composed by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro and creates a unique and immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the game's action-packed gameplay.

One of the strengths of the game is its difficulty. The game is challenging but not frustrating, with a range of difficulty settings that allow players to adjust the game's challenge to their liking. The game also features a range of side quests and hidden items that encourage players to explore and discover all that the game has to offer.

However, some players may find the game's story to be predictable and cliché, with characters and plot points that feel formulaic. Additionally, the game's translation and localization may not be up to the standards of some players, with occasional awkward dialogue and grammatical errors.

Overall, Ys: The Oath in Felghana is an exceptional hack-and-slash RPG that offers fast-paced and engaging gameplay, stunning soundtrack, and a challenging and rewarding experience.

I did my first playthrough of Ys: The Oath in Felghana on nightmare, which definitely caused me some high amounts of frustration. I mean, it took me about 36 hours to beat it on nightmare, and almost all of that was the bosses, and a little bit of getting too carried away running through dungeons without going back to save. 
My biggest complaint about the game would be that the story is mediocre, most of the normal enemies are kind of boring to fight, and some of the voice acting is a little rough. However, I don't hold the story against the game because it's both short, and it puts gameplay above all else, which is what all good games should do. However, it should be noted that Chester's voice actor did a superb job. While a lot of the normal enemies are trashy, there are a decent amount of ones later on in the game that require some actual thought to beat. The only boss that I genuinely disliked was the spike hell hole bird that is some RNG bullshit, and Guilen the dragon centipede thing. Fuck Guilen. These are my only complaints.
Ys: The Oath in Felghana excels in its boss battles and music, which are next level well made. Now, the bosses, to put it bluntly, truly are on crack and will slap you hard as all hell on nightmare mode, but that just makes them even more fun to fight. Apparently. starting on hard mode, the bosses not only hit harder and take less damage, but gain new attacks, attack patterns, and less windows of opportunity to attack them, and it changes to become harder once again when playing on nightmare mode. This is a really cool difference between difficulties that I really respect. Now, the music for every YS game absolutely slaps, and Oath in Felghana has some of the best tracks to date, in my opinion. I especially enjoyed the soundtrack for the final boss, who took me about a whopping 5 hours and 20 minutes to beat at lvl 52. The controls are super tight too. 
All in all, I'd give Ys: The Oath in Felghana a 10/10. The bosses are just pure euphoria to fight, and some of the mobs are also pretty fun to fight. If you want an extremely solid action RPG that is one bitch of a challenge on high difficulties, then there really isn't anything better than this game. Personally, I found a decent chunk of the bosses in this game, on nightmare mode, to be far more difficult to beat than 99% of the bosses from the Souls series. The final boss of Oath in Felghana? Pfft, that bastard is far harder than Malenia from Elden Ring. It's not even a contest. 
Edit: I 100% completed the game now, and nightmare boss rush is by far the most difficult one to do. I did nightmare boss rush before inferno, which made inferno feel like a cakewalk.

Cleaning up and making the game playable for modern audiences is quite nice and, especially if you've played Ys Origin, you'll feel right at home with many mechanics being used between the two games.

The gameplay has that edge of simplicity with enough mechanics to not be overbearing which some games fall into the common pitfall. The bosses themselves do play around very well with what the player can do, but I did find a couple of them being a bit more on the stalling end of the spectrum, which was a bit frustrating at times. The game's difficulty options are numerous in number, and I found the level of challenge to be quite welcome and not too bad overall. There isn't too much need for grinding, but if you do skip hallways of enemies consistently, you might find the need to catch up just a little. Again, as stated above, if you've played Ys Origin before, you'll feel right at home in this title.

Rather brief, but the graphics were rather nice. Again, same as Ys Origin, so you'll find yourself not out-of-place when jumping in. The look was rather nice and charming, keeping a solid consistency throughout. In addition, there's voice acting added, but I found some voices to fit in well while a few others didn't really work for me.

The only downside, I would say, was the story. While the earlier games weren't too complex either, I found them a bit more engaging than with this title. That isn't to say it's bad, but if you're looking for something a bit more engaging, you may be a bit disappointed. That said, it's still pleasant to play through and see how things develop.

The third game in the series does well to continue the saga of Adol. While the story might not the strongest, or some of the voice acting either, I found the experience overall to be amazing and still reaching that quality I've come to expect from the series.

This is my 5th Ys game, following Digital Emelas's story order, and with each one I play, my love of this series is further cemented.

Combat is engaging and fun throughout the whole game. Your regular attacks are punchy and satisfying, with a surprisingly long basic combo and jump attacks. You get 3 types of spells over the game, which each have specific uses in combat and also exploration: a spin attack, fireball, and charge/parry. The bosses are challenging if you want, but easily knocked down a couple pegs if you level up a few more times (on Normal, if you go Very Easy/Easy you will likely breeze through regardless), so you'll be able to avoid most of the salt (unless you reeeally suck or are impatient like me lol). The reason my playtime is so high is because I grinded a bunch to bypass the worst of the challenge. Regular mobs are varied and require enough different strategies to defeat that it successfully staves off the tedium.

The soundtrack is incredible, as to be expected from Falcom, and it has some of the best songs in the series (in my experience so far). Personal highlights for me are the main theme and Redmont's theme, plus the farewell theme in the epilogue. Every dungeon has its own music, and they each suit the area perfectly, and while boss themes are sometimes reused, it still works because it instills a familiar sense of urgency and gets you ready each time you hear them.

The story isn't terribly original, but it's executed and told well thanks to a great translation and surprisingly charming voice acting. I usually am too impatient to listen to voice acting after I'm done reading, and the VA initially got on my nerves when I started, to the point where I was considering just turning it off. But ultimately I decided to try and appreciate it for what it is, and it grew on me in short order, except for Margo's voice, which drives me up the wall. The plot itself has a few twists and turns, which keep things interesting, and when I reached the end, I really felt satisfied and sad saying goodbye.

The best thing about this game is the magic attacks, especially fire and wind. Fire for ranged attacks and wind is essential for spinning across gaps to get to other areas or treasures. It makes gameplay interesting.
This game is a lot like Ys Origin and the original versions of Ys IV on Turbografx CD and SNES. It's nothing like the side scrolling original Ys 3. It's also not a party of characters like Ys 4 Celceta.

You start the game out with your longtime pal, Dogi, from Ys 1. Funny thing is that he always manages to run off somewhere in a hurry or he gets hurt, so that the entire game you play solo. Sadly, you never get to be the wall-busting Dogi.  Oh well, this game is fun anyway! If you like the straightforward old style of gameplay then buy this already! It's great even at full price. And it's definitely bang for buck when there's a sale.
I even liked it more than Ys Origin. At Normal level, the bosses are not that difficult until late into the game. There aren't really any puzzles or anything too crazy. This is mostly an action and character driven type of story that was just right in length. Not too short and it ended right about when I was ready for a conclusion, so I could move on to the next game in the Ys series.
Even though, chronologically, this game's story is after Ys 4 Celceta, I recommend playing Felghana right after Ys 2. Adol's story flows better that way. In fact, in the old version of Ys 3 on Turbografx CD there's an intro scene where Adol and Dogi are sailing away leaving the land of Ys, while a girl stands looking at them, watching her crush (Adol) go off to another adventure.
This game is a fun experience and a worthwhile remake. Plus it's better than a lot of more expensive games. I hope the rest of the series continues this trend of better than average.",1675530368,1675530488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

重温的同时也要差评一下成就系统，噩梦boss rush以及老爷子加黑暗比卡多两个隐藏boss的成就个人认为还算合理，涉及到的是玩家操作熟练度和boss招式的背板，只要花时间练习或者观摩大佬的视频总有机会打过。但一些凑数的成就实在恶心，比如杀500个女仆，又比如60级满级。拿60级满级举例，在祭坛前的密道里速刷死灵骷髅，后期15-20s一波才不到50经验，而50级后升一级需要上万经验，这还是维持1.99倍率经验的情况下，也同时意味着玩家不能停止操作，因为一旦停止经验倍率就会过期。我大概留意了一下光从52升到53就花了半个多小时，打到后面都开始意识模糊，所以这种成就即使达成了也毫无成就感，后期完全溢出的矿石和金钱也证明了这种练级毫无意义。",1674873962,1674874180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

11.5 hours of game data progression, and 8.5 hours of lost save data or wasted time on killing bosses. 

The bosses were definitely made when the developers were on crack. This gotta be the best Ys game, despite all the frustration of losing data and spending hours to kill bosses. The story was amazing, along as having the best ending imo. Chester's VA was also probably one of the best I've heard for any English dub anime or game. All the other VA's were good, but no one can compete with Chester. Chester was MVP imo in the game because of his character setting, especially what happened at the ending.

10/10 Underrated Game. Would recommend, if you wanna get angry at a game for being so good and hard for no reason.

-------------------------------------------

Edit 1 - (27/02/23 to 01/03/23):

Just finished Inferno and tried speed running It, It did not indeed go so well. I finished it in about 5hrs and 30 mins, with and overall gameplay of 20 hours.

Honestly there isn't actual that much dialogue and the game feels quite quick when spamming 'a', the only problem to the speedrun was the bosses. I def lost my sanity playing this game as the bosses started to gradually get harder. All bosses after the Gyalva were definitely on crack and I def spend hours on some bosses only to add like 20 mins to the timer. Which is why I had 10 hours of unrecorded bs time due to how rigged the game is. I couldn't even touch the last few bosses half of the time, especially the last boss, not only that but am i pissed that I was 30 mins from getting the 5 hour achievement.

This game is so good, but pisses me off cuz how hard it is. Still a 10/10 imo

-------------------------------------------

Edit 2 - 13/03/23

Completed all the game modes at last. I feel like im losing my sanity. Now the only achievements I need are all the boss rush which I might not do from months now, maybe even years.

-------------------------------------------

Edit 3 - 04/12/23

Decided that I wanted to get the 100% achievement on January 3rd because that is when I completed the game and got the achievement for completing it on normal mode, which was my first run. Yesterday I attempted normal boss rush and it was much easier than I thought. It took me slightly just under 1 hour. 

I then decided that today I could potentialy beat Hard mode on Boss Rush. I just got it done in under 2.5 hrs.

Since all went well I thought what would be a great idea but to do Inferno mode boss rush. I spent almost 4.5 hours fighting Galbalan, which is the final boss before the secret boss. And you will never guess what happened, I died and accidentally shifted down on towards my joystick while pressing 'a' on my controller and pressed onto back to menu. And just like that, half a day's worth of grinding is gone! I'm really starting to lose my sanity againt this game! As much as I like this game, this game makes me feel like im going crazy.

Currently, I play it in normal mode. It is grindy and the controls are not that good. My impression is that the controls are 'intended' to fail in certain situations such that the game is 'more interesting' (and most annoying). If they would not fail, then the amount of grinding is much more apparant and annoying. This hold for jumping as well as for boss fights. If you do not have the right level the fight is programmed to fail. At any rate you have to grind a lot. Grinding is not a problem if there is enough to discover and there are sufficiently many different monsters. So far, however, this is not really the case. Moreover, it is moooost annoying that the save points are placed only at the start and end of dungeons, i.e if you die you have to start all over  again.

There is some freedom in buying wapons, shields and armory, but I doubt that you will know the best way to do this in the first playthrough. According to the steamcards the game can/should be played at very easy, easy, normal ...
At best I play it at normal mod. That is all for the moment.

This is the sixth Ys game I've played and the third I've completed, and I can say this is tied with Seven as my favorite. To get the obvious out or the way: the music crushes it once again, and this might be the most consistent OST of the games I played. Give it a listen for yourself, but I'm particularly fond of the Castle music. Every track is a hit.

Gameplay wise, this is Classic Ys. Adol only, no weapon damage types, and magic are your bread and butter here. And that gameplay is VERY fast and snappy. Adol controls like a dream, dancing around the environments with each sword slash and magic attack. I never once felt like I wasn't in complete control, and I was able to be offensive while dodging attacks with ease once I learned the patterns.

Speaking of, this game is hard. Most Ys games I would consider a decent challenge, but this is easily the hardest one of the ones I played. Normal mode on this feels comparable to hard in Seven and VIII. However, it never really feels unfair. Once you have good equipment and learn the boss patterns, fights become extremely fun exchanges of getting into a rhythm and learning when to dodge or use magic for defense. The entire flow of the game is just... really nice. 

My Steam time says I have 13.5 hours, but that's counting all my deaths. My actual game time is around eight hours, so it's a much shorter game than the modern ones. That said, I honestly consider it a strength. This game doesn't waste your time at all, and that in turn also leads to the flow being as good as it is.

Without going into spoilers, I can also say I enjoyed the story a good amount. Focusing on a single small town and the people within it was a very good choice, and the decision to give each one their own portraits with dialog that always changes made me want to always talk to everyone after a story beat. Ys games aren't known for the deepest plots, especially compared to how dense Falcom's other series, Trails, is, but I really appreciated everything that was here. Of particular note is the rival of this game, who is easily one of the best characters in the series IMO.

So yeah, all in all, this was an excellent game, and one I can recommend without hesitation, provided you're fine with the challenge. Especially if you want something on the shorter side.",1671776823,1671776823,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The game incorporates Falcom's new gameplay style, seen in Ys Origin which involves a much more modern take on the RPG style, with dedicated jumping, attacking and item buttons. Story wise, this takes place immediately after Ys2, though aside from Dogi, there isn't much requirement to play Ys1 and 2. There is alot to unpack about this game, much of it good. 

The first major caveat, as implied in my Origin review, is the combat and visual style. These two combine together to make a fantastic Ys title. The game, and especially large scale structures, look brilliant in the partially 2d pixel visual format. This 3d space also allows bosses and enemies to make more interesting movements and do more unique attack (compared to what was able on 2d Ys titles). Much of the foundation of Ys origin returns, with 3 major types of magic existing (Earth, Wind and Fire) for use by the player, with some basic attacks such as plunging attacks, a normal combo, jumping attacks etc. 

The main enjoyment of this games combat is the enemies movesets and player creativity with use of the 3 defined spell types, much like how Fromsoftware games are often praised for their enjoyable combat, Ys is similar in that regard. Whilst Souls combat isn't very deep (It can be boiled down to dodge, attack for the most part), Ys is similar, whilst it rewards good mechanical skill and smart thinking, the addictive nature of the dodging, counter attacking and learning of enemy moves is truly what made me enjoy it so much. This was best achieved with the final boss of the game, which had well defined miniphases which made me constantly shift my way of thinking. In Nightmare, it was a treat to slowly get through each miniphase with a bit more HP than before - visually representing ones mastery. Overall, the assessment of Oath's combat is much like mine of Origins, the gameplay is fantastic especially for bosses - for trash mobs, this can be hit or miss dependent on the area, though often its pretty good. The need for farming is still annoying though. The level design is alot of fun, especially castle Valestein, and the various stages of platforming makes for some very unique venues for bosses and fighting enemies (clock tower, looking at you). 

The music and story in this game are also not to be taken lightly. Whilst the story still is basic, there is quite the attachment to characters and area in this game. I found myself engrossed in the land of Felghana, despite only being wanderer there. The direct connection to Dogi gave me reason to help the people, and seeing their stories only made me go further. I really enjoyed the history that was hinted at the land by those who talk to Dogi - suggesting that the land had gone into disarray whilst he was in Esteria. This really makes you feel like a hero who is saving a land that is slowly getting overrun by monsters. The character of Chester was a major unexpected interest for me, presenting a character that I simply just didn't expect. The addition of voice acting (the English is to be praised in this) is also welcomed. As for the music, this game had a ton of amazing tracks, as Ys does. Sealed time and Valestein castle are my personal favourites, really matching the pace of the level I feel. This game, out of the Ys trilogy and this definitely won in terms of the music used, though 2 comes in as a close second. 

One last thing I'd like to mention is the side content, there was alot of cool things to find in Felghana, you were much more rewarded for exploring and doing side content than Origin or the prior games, which I highly appreciate. This also allowed you to further understand the plights of the villagers or the history of Dogi - both of which were equally interesting. The various secrets you can uncover are recommended if you are a thorough player.  

Overall, whilst not my favourite, The Oath in Felghana is a strong contender again due to it's charm as a simplistic old game I think. The modernisation brought by falcoms revising really helps the game shine and I think this game would act as a strong entry point for a new player. Though, if they are willing to get this game then they might as well just start with Origin as it better makes sense chronologically, if they want to avoid bump system.",1668925960,1668925960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Pros:
+I'll start with the reason I know what Ys is in the first place: The soundtrack. HOLY SHIT IT IS SO GOOD. Every track is a joy to listen to. And it's not just Oath in Felghana; I've explored the OSTs for several other Ys games, too, and they all had a consistent, high level of quality. Ys has, hands down, one of the best soundtracks of any franchise I've ever played, rivaling Undertale, Touhou Project, and others.
+The character portraits (the ones that appear during dialogue) look great. Everyone's design is memorable and distinct.
+I liked the voice acting, you could really tell that the VAs were having fun with the characters. I especially liked Chester's VA!
+Despite being confined to a pair of islands, the world manages to give a distinct look to all of its different areas and dungeons. The dungeons themselves make for good platforming.
+The combat system is engaging, easy to understand, and fast-paced - good for those looking for something that isn't turn-based.
+The bosses all present their own challenges, with each one having different strengths and weaknesses. All of them, though, will keep you on your toes from beginning to end!

Neutral:
*The story and characters are pretty basic. The plot isn’t *bad* but it relies on a lot of common tropes, [spoiler]including the quintessential anime quest to ""kill god,"" which I adore. The ending also goes out of its way to be tragic, which doesn't work that well[/spoiler].
*Hard game is hard. Really hard. I played this on the Normal difficulty and still struggled with almost every single boss (but there are easier settings you can choose). Apparently that's just par for the course with this series. Personally, I like a challenge, but I'm putting this in the neutral column just because I don't view game difficulty as an inherently good or bad thing - everyone's views are different.

Cons:
-Overworld graphics haven't aged all that well. Understandable, because the game is 17 years old at this point, but still.
-The difficulty spikes had me reeling. If you're not careful (and, sometimes, even if you are) you'll quickly find yourself getting overwhelmed by all the enemies in the dungeon, and the game will turn from a hack-and-slash dungeon crawl into a desperate sprint for the nearest save point so you can heal (granted, you can buy healing potions. I didn't because I'm cheap). Backtracking doesn't do you many favors, either, because enemies reset every time you enter a new area. This isn't a huge complaint because whenever I found myself in this position, it usually meant I was due for a weapons/armor upgrade. That plus some moderate grinding always cleared the problem right up.
-The game uses save points, which I've never liked. Early on, you do get an item which lets you teleport to them from anywhere on the map, so they're at least good for quick navigation.
-You can't pause during boss fights, and if you die during a boss fight, your only options are to either quit the game or restart right at the start of the fight, instead of the last save point. I did not like this. [b]PSA: Save immediately before and after every boss battle[/b].

Tl;dr Overall, while the visuals and story aren’t anything to write home about, this game has a great combat system, good dungeons, really challenging and unique bosses, and a kickass OST. Perfect for those looking for a solid, classic JRPG fantasy experience. I look forward to exploring the rest of the series!",1666861486,1666862420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

However, unlike Ys II, which is connected to Ys I, Ys III has a different story, with no mention of the previous story, so if this is your first Ys game, you can play this without worrying about missing lore.

This game unlike Ys I and II is much different. For starters, 3D graphics with 2D sprites, very identical to Legend Of Heroes Trails in the Sky series (after all, they are both made by Falcom). Second biggest change is no more pressing forward to attack, meaning you know have to press a button to attack, and the third biggest change is jump. Combined all that makes Ys Oath in Felghana a unique game in the series.

At first I was a bit skeptical about these changes, making the game feel more like a hack and slasher platformer, but when I actually first tasted the combat, it was extremely fun. I later realized how improved this combat was over the first two games, and how much boss battles are a lot more fun.

Actually I would say, everything is improvement over the first two games. The game is longer, more challenging, more awesome music, more memorable characters, better story...

So here is my final thoughts: If you liked Ys I and II, you will like this even more. If you disliked Ys I and II's combat mechanic, then try this game and maybe you will change your mind. 

However if this is your first entry to the Ys, that's completely fine too! As of now, Ys Oath in Felghana is my favorite Ys game, so I give it full thumbs up.",1666820647,1666820647,True,6,0,0.585266530513763428,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1]难！是真的难！[/h1]
前两个boss都打了几十遍，几十遍啊！我算是伊苏N党，一周目都是打的normal，打过伊苏O，6，7，树海，8，9，姑且算是有点基础的（主要指打过O，6，后面伊苏越做越简单了），然后一到boss战就被吊打。如果手残的剧情党（感觉剧情也不多）建议不要一周目normal。
[h1]很多横版的地图设计[/h1]
这是我玩这部伊苏感触最深的，与6，O相比算是一个特色，这样的设计感觉有好有坏吧，这样的设计使得跳跃的难度提高了，但同时更不容易迷路吧。
取消冲跳斩，新增二段跳。可喜可贺！我之前给6的冲跳斩虐的死去活来，但是跳跃难度比起起源还是高上不少，后面依然给跳跃虐的死去活来（感觉是受到视角限制不知道落脚点在哪里）。
[h1]杰出的音乐[/h1]
玩之前就看到很多评论吹这作的音乐，确实不错，当然6，F，O三部的音乐质量都很高。
[h1]爽快的打击感[/h1]
这作爆气的攻速加成高，打起来非常爽快，加上黄手镯的格挡，小怪一路莽过去问题不大。战斗系统相比6更加完善，刷级也相对更好刷，节奏得到优化。但是每次进入新地图都会被小怪按在地上摩擦，除非拿到新的装备，这点6和起源的平衡做的更好，当然这三作的共通点都是等级对战斗产生影响很大，多升个一两级，手残也能过boss。
[h1]有趣的boss战设计[/h1]
也许是被虐的次数过多了，感觉这一作的boss节奏把控的最好，半血boss就会改变出招方式，以及拥有更长的无敌时间（然后game over了），这作的boss钻研时间最长，感觉都跟boss打出感情了......当然，有趣的还是最后boss的那个传球，感觉打击感非常......音游？整体的难度感觉我是在打东方，满屏的“弹幕”，豆子在中间钻空隙......当然黄手镯的格挡相当好用，可惜消耗太大，不能连续多次使用。
[h1]剧情方面俗套[/h1]
剧情质量和6差不多，内容是比较精简的，甚至感觉剧情走向也是差不多的，收集完后幕后黑手出现，召唤最终boss，豆子打完拯救世界（没有豆子的话，世界已经毁灭多少次了啊！），感觉和6一样都是重战斗轻剧情的，剧情方面要求不必过高。
[h1]总结[/h1]
这部伊苏的整体水平不错，也许是受了时代影响，个人对F的感觉没有那么神作，相比6，O来说，还是O的感觉最好，不过就算没有那么亮眼，也算是值得一玩的佳作。",1666424895,1666424895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It looks very similar to Origins, but there isn't much similarity other than that (and some recurring items/skills). The bosses are far too difficult. I died a few times on the very first boss on very easy mode, which I think is pretty ridiculous. There aren't even any healing items or dodge ability. Given the boss difficulty, I probably wouldn't have even finished the game if I hadn't found out how to turn on debug mode and cheat my character to be powerful enough to breeze through. (Some people might like a challenge in games. In some cases, at least, I just want to be able to experience the story.)

The story, in my opinion, was pretty weak. It was rather generic for the most part. There were some interesting twists, and Chester kind of had an interesting thing going on. But in the end, it went for some pretty cliche turns, needless tragedy when a happy ending would have been far more satisfying, and what I think was meant to be a generally happy ending just left me feeling kind of sad and lonely. So, the story just didn't hit me very well, and it could have been a lot better.

I played it with the English voice dub, and while it was nice to have it, most of the acting was not all that good. Too cartoonish. Some characters, like the innkeeper lady, were particularly horrible. Most were just ... not that great. Some were fine. 

Overall, a pretty 'meh' experience for me, but I don't really want to give it a thumbs-down because it wasn't *that* bad. But if you're thinking of playing it mostly for the story, I would not really recommend it for that. (Even if you're a huge Ys fan, unless you're specifically a big Dogi fan, I'm not sure how much you'd get out of the story.

It does have nice art direction, but for the pacing and other problems, I'd give it a pass. I will say, I read that these were ports of Japanese PS2 games from the mid-2000's 'revival' era.

[h1]日本語化可能[/h1]
ストアページでは未対応表記の日本語ですが、ダウンロードファイルに含まれていました。簡単なファイルの差し替えで言語切り替えできます。方法は検索で。音声の方もどうにかすれば変えられますが、ごく一部のボスの掛け声くらいで『イースSEVEN』ほどの恩恵はありません。FHDの解像度にも対応されていました。FHD化前は隠れていた部分が見切れるのは許容範囲内。
完全にとはいかないまでも、不自由なく日本語でプレイできました。

[h1]攻撃手段が多彩なボス戦[/h1]
1周クリアに数時間といったところですが、凝ったボスが多いからかそれ以上にプレイしてる感覚がありました。第一、第二形態と変化するボス、HP減少や選択難易度で攻撃パターンが追加されるボス、新しく入手したリングアーツを活かすボス。どの敵も毎回異なるアクションが求められ、創意がみられます。
しかしボス戦は基本的に逃げ回りつつ隙をうかがってちまちま削る戦法となります。場全体に弾をばら撒く様はまるで弾幕STGかのよう。行動パターンを頭に入れて弾幕をかわした後に攻撃します。殴り合うと勝てません。近年のイースシリーズにある「戦闘中の回復アイテム」「手軽にダメージが出せるスキル」「フラガなどの攻撃無効化」を経験していると、そこが辛く感じるときもありました。
慣れれば私は最高難易度Infernoでもクリアできましたし、全実績解除までやり込むくらいはまりました。同じシステムの『イースVI -ナピシュテムの匣-』よりアクションが洗練されています。

[h1]ボタン配置変更の勧め[/h1]
リングアーツを溜めながらジャンプ直後に攻撃する場面が多々あります。コントローラを使っていると初期設定のボタン配置だと同時押しがしづらく、思うように戦えません。そこで私のボタン設定を書き残しておきます。ゲーム内はコントローラのキーコンフィグ未対応のため、Steamクライアント側で変更します。表記はXbox基準。括弧内は元のボタン。
・LB…リングアーツ（X）
・RB…リング切り替え（LB）
・A…ジャンプ（B）
・X…攻撃（A）
・Start…メニュー（RS押し）

戦い方のコツも。下突きを入れると多段ヒットしやすい。リングアーツで攻撃キャンセルでき、キャンセルした分属性も乗る。「ダッシュ習得後は常に使用」にチェックする。実は地のアーツで攻撃が無効化できる。
難易度を上げながら周回していると自然と身に着く技かもしれませんが、これらを意識すると攻撃効率にだいぶ差が出ます。

[h1]まとめ[/h1]
難しいけれど短時間でさくっと終えられます。言語、解像度ともにプレイ環境に支障ありません。近年のイースとは戦闘の感覚に違いがありますが、キビキビとしたアクションはこの頃から健在で楽曲もノリノリ。「バレスタイン城」とかもう入った瞬間からテンション上がりっぱなしです。
弾幕を張るボスとの戦い方に順応できさえすれば、やりごたえがあって燃えるアクションでした。",1658549290,1659531584,True,15,0,0.703187227249145508,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game belongs to the ""one character, three kinds of magic"" gameplay style, which also includes Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and Ys: Origin.
I should also mention that Oath in Felghana is a remake of Ys III, but it's not strictly necessary to play the Ys games in order, although it does enhance the story aspect if you do. This entry has voice acting too, but it's trash so I recommend lowering the voice volume to 0. 
However, the music remains excellent and it's possible to play with the older versions too so that's neat. This isn't a 1:1 remake either (especially since the original is a sidescroller) so there are new bosses, enemies and such. I think the new content in the second portion of the game is specially good, once you have all the magic types and encounters are designed for that.  
That being said, I have some reservations about certain bosses in the nightmare difficulty, which is usually the best to play since it gives enemies new attacks instead of merely inflating their health values. The Ys series is largely skill based so it's a bit of a shame that Gyalva and Gildias exist to introduce a significant amount of RNG into the equation. Some stuff feels like a step backwards from The Ark of Napishtim and Origin.
To conclude, I think the game is pretty good. I would definitely recommend it to people who already like the Ys series and want more of it, or pretty much anyone who likes top-down action games. It's weaker than Origin, and possibly The Ark of Napishtim too, but it's still pretty good on its own right anyway.",1657854529,1657854967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Геймплей:
Изометрический хакенслеш с кнопкой атаки и магическими умениями. Герой управляется бодро, хитбоксы почти не раздражают, монстры весело крошатся на куски. Ну а боссы рвут на куски уже игрока. Баланс у игры шатает во все стороны и иногда она ОЧЕНЬ сильно раздражает. Особенно на максимальной сложности.
Графика: Для начала нулевых, достаточно приятная. Анимации красивые, атаки боссов хорошо считываются.
Музыка: Как обычно легендарна. Ys и этим все сказано.
Сюжет. Достаточно простенькая история про очередное злобное зло которое хочет пробудиться. На свою беду, в том месте где объявился Адол. Хорошие персонажи и несколько ""вотэтоповорот"" в комплекте.

The game itself is a solid arpg with an okay combat system. The boss encounters however feel bad due to dated graphics which make it hard to navigate and avoid attacks and badly telepgraphed mechanics, which will often leave you with a feeling of disappointment after thinking you've avoided something but the game disagrees and kills you. There's also a lot of randomness and one shot attacks. A boss can be a cakewalk if it randomly decides to use the attack that exposes it to damage twifce in a row, or it can be undoable if it chains an attack that's close to unavoidable 3-4 times. Would definitely not recommend playing this on higher difficulty settings, this is likely to just end in frustration and/or require excessive grinding to even stand a chance.

This isn't PSP port as one might think, so it doesn't have a New Game+ mode, and all the changes from the newer version, such as elixirs giving +10 hp instead of +1. All the challenges and achievements that require you to complete different difficulty levels require playing from scratch every time, and because the game offers no variance at all it just gets boring.

I haven't played the original, and i'm only getting around to really getting into these games this year. How's it hold up?

Pretty awesome game! Probably my favorite Ys title that i've played, out of the four i've picked up so far.

The music is badass, and the bosses require actual strategy, it's not just a dps race. 

I will say, you can definitely tell when you're underleveled, or when you skipped a new weapon/sword in a dungeon. Also, strangely, there's a lot of content and items not in this game that are in the PSP version, namely a enhanced version of the boost gauge. I think so far, this is my favorite Ys game.

It blends adventure game roleplaying with platforming, bullet-hell shmup elements, and challenging hack and slash.

Boss fights have you running all over the arena like a super mobile madman dodging shmup-esque danmaku attacks and varied, creative patterns. There is absolutely no other game like this on the market that combines so many oldschool arcadey genres into one cohesive whole.

Even the story/writing has soul. Every NPC has a face and constantly updates their dialogue throughout. The story is simple and archetypal 16-bit era jrpg stuff (it IS a remake of a 90's game, after all) but characters have just enough depth in their dialogue to feel like actual people.

	Ys 3 (1989) is considered the 'black sheep' of the franchise, and frequently compared to Zelda 2. Like Zelda 2, it is a sequel (Ys 1&2 really are a singular game) that goes from an overhead perspective to a 2D side-scrolling plane. For as much as it is disparaged, I personally had no issue with Ys 3. For as much as you think a change in perspective would change the game, it really didn't. It still played like Ys, with its only issues being the need to grind and how some bosses were almost immobile.

	Either way, Falcom must've taken the criticism to heart, because Oath is the first game in the series to get such a drastic remake. Oath in Felghana takes the plot and dungeons from Ys 3, and either expands or clarifies whilst staying faithful to the source material. If you play Felghana, there is absolutely nothing you are missing from the originals. The soundtrack is the same, but of higher quality (with live instrumentation). If anything, you're missing out by playing the originals. 

	Mechanically, it uses the Ys 6 engine and borrows its game mechanics from that title. Ys 6, Oath, and Origin all used the same engine and game systems. So if you've played one, you're at home with the others. Even the three magic attacks are mostly the same. Even for its time (early to mid 2000s), these games are nothing to write home about in terms of combat. But there's also not much to disparage either. You have a basic 6 hit combo off your singular attack button, and a magic button with three spells to alternate between.

	What's really worthy of note is the re-written script. Oath follows the original game's plot almost verbatim, but either expands character roles, introduces some minor characters, or elaborates on others. The game's plot threads make more sense than before.

	In the originals, the frail Elena manages to go halfway into dungeons teeming with enemies. In Oath, she makes the trek whilst accompanied by the capable Dogi, or already imprisoned deep in enemy territory. In the original, Dogi is always there and capable of helping you, but...doesn't. In Oath, there is either a plausible explenation why he is absent, or a rational explenation as to why he is incapable of doing so. 

	I know its Ys and the plot shouldn't be the MAIN priority, but it makes this so much more enjoyable for me. Especially when the voice acting is as good as it is. ESPECIALLY for a lower budget PSP game, with such low brand recognition in the US that it would've been easy to mess that up. Xseed are Gods for bringing this franchise over to the West the way that they did.
	If you've played Ys 3, you'll attain a level of appreciation for it that you otherwise wouldn't. I haven't played all the Ys games yet, but I already enjoyed it more than Origin. I assume that those who place it above Origins and 6 love it for the same reason. Even if it isn't your favorite of the 3 Ys6 engine games, it still merits respect.

	With how disconnected the games are generally from one another, you can easily jump into Oath without having played any of the other games. Or you can play it out of order from the rest of the franchise. Which is to say, it doesn't matter how you're playing these games as long as you play this one.",1642150411,1642150411,True,2,0,0.413742154836654663,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Anyway, Oath in Felghana is not that harder than Ys Origin in my opinion, it is just they hit harder[/b]. The most epic fight is definitely [spoiler] Chester V2 [/spoiler], the rest is about being aggressive with awareness, and [spoiler]Istersiva, Galbalan[/spoiler] can go f*** themself with the RNG in attacks, 

Other than that solid simple storyline of Ys classic as usual, same as soundtrack with The Boy Who Had Wings being the most memorable, sadly none can beat Beyond the Beginning from Origin, and the same for visual which is unique mix between 3D environment and 2D sprites.

For hardcore achievements they are not as horrifying as Ys Origin as there is only one boss rush and one Inferno run, so do not worry, though you need to run the main game at least 6 times to get everything.

Final Rating: 8.5/10

So far, I like this version better than the PSP version. The music is just fantastic.

This game is a remake of Ys 3 - Wanders from Ys. The OG game was a side scrolling ARPG, one of the very few games of the genre - at least what they export to the USA. It played like games like Faxanadu, Castlevania 2, or Zelda 2. I had it on Genesis, but it was also released on the SNES, and in Japan PC and Famicom. It was a fantastic game, though difficult.

This remake is 3D, not side scrolling which I admit is disapointing because I really enjoy side scrolling RPGs as I don't get to play them very often and it seems like the majority of them that came to the USA are metroidvania titles. But this version is fantastic, a hell of a lot of fun to play and the soundtrack is just fantastic - probably my favorite in the series.

It's the second game to use this engine; the first being Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Gameplay wise, it's way different from the original. Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys is a sort of side scrolling action game, similar to Zelda 2, while OiF is a 3D hack-n-slash. I prefer OiF's gameplay but it's not the same without the parallax scrolling.
With almost every Ys game, the music is really good. Although I'm biased towards the PC Engine's OST, the new remixed soundtrack is pretty good. A Searing Struggle is really good (but I prefer the PC Engine and the Pre-Arrange versions), The Boy Who Had Wings is bumping, Illburn Ruins is catchy, and Valestein Castle. I don't need to say anything else about Valestein Castle. However, I wish they added the PC Engine OST as well when they updated the game to include voice-over and the PC-88 and X68K OST. So far, I haven't found a mod to bring the PC Engine OST back in but I'm not complaining. TLDR: I think the PC Engine's OST is better.
The game is 15 bucks, and one playthrough on Nightmare difficulty will net you about 30 hours playtime wise, if you're bad like me. If I remember correctly, my first playthough on Nightmare is about 15 hours long, and I don't think that time counts the boss retries. The game isn't as short as a playthrough in Ys Origin, but it's still relatively short. Still though, its got good dollar to hour ratio. The PC Engine version I believe it took me about 10 hours to beat so it's definitely longer than its source material. But enough about me crying about the PC Engine's Ys 3, it's annoying.
As per usual, the older Ys games are known for being incredibly difficult and OiF lives up to that expectation. However, it's not without its faults. On higher difficulties, the bosses rely on RNG. It's not hard to figure out when the boss is going to attack, it's the matter of what that attack will do or how many times that boss does that attack. Some good, like Dularn and Ellefale but I struggled and often needed to overlevel. Gyalva and its randomised platfom flipping, whether its the front or back one, who knows. I can go on but I'd be spoiling. [i]Maybe I'm just bad[/i]. Outside the bosses, the game is fairly balanced between difficult and unfair. [spoiler]If you manage to beat the time attack boss rush on Nightmare AS WELL as beating the first secret boss that unlocks after beating boss rush, you unlock debug mode, which is just cheating. It's not bad if you want to just breeze through the game on the unlockable harder difficulty but it's not worth suffering unless you're sadistic or hardcore enough.[/spoiler]",1631308005,1631308005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich bin erst mit dem dritten Teil in Berührung gekommen und es war einfach Awesome damals als ich es auf den SNES gespielt habe. Schon immer liebte ich den Soundtrack. Diese Version ist der Remake vom dritten Teil und das nicht die erste. Aber die beste. Während der dritte Teil einen Stilbruch in Sachen Gameplay damals machte ähnlich wie Zelda 2, so war es dennoch eine sehr tolle aber harte Erfahrung. Einer der wenigen Teile die damals auf den Konsolen im Westen Released wurde und dann so ein Bockschweres Ding. 

Darum Vorweg, Dieser Teil hier ist nicht schwerer als sein Orginal. Ja klar die Bosse erfordern Koeographie. Das tun viele Spiele. Aber ich empfand zu keiner Zeit wirklich das Spiel als unfair bisher. 

Es ist alt und schon echt in die Jahre gekommen. Es ist schade, das man keine Settings in den Grafik Einstellungen machen kann. 

Es ist liebevoll synchronisiert worden und viele schöne Cutscenen und andere Sequenzen wurden gemacht. 

Es ist ein gelungener Remake vom dritten Teil und eine weitere schöne Geschichte von Adol. 

Wer noch nicht in den Genuß gekommen ist sollte dies nach holen. Der Soundtrack war damals wie auch Heute schon wie in vielen YS Teilen legendär

Pour commencer, l'histoire de Felghana est un peu plus captivante dès le début, avec un peu plus de dialogues liés au scénario, même s'il y a quelques clichés et qu'on se doute un peu de pas mal de choses. Le jeu est un peu plus long, il m'a fallut 14h d'après steam, c'est un peu plus que  Napishtim, mais notons un grind moins présent également.

Niveau gameplay, on perd le jump dash (qui était un peu ch**nt à placer ^^') on gagne 3 sorts, cela dit semblable un peu aux attaques spéciales de  Napishtim.
L’inventaire reste assez léger là aussi, d'ailleurs, cette fois-ci il n'y aura pas de potions, les ennemis peuvent lâcher des items de soins, mais ce sera utilisés directement, on ne conserve rien. ce qui peut rendre ardus les combats de boss.
Combats de boss qui sont parfois un peu pénibles, dur de réussir du premier coup, et mélanger à certaines phase de plateforme, il est des fois difficile de viser correctement avec les sorts (à l'image du boss final). Phase de plateforme qui en dehors des combats sont aussi plus intéressantes, mais parfois frustrantes à cause de la caméra et sa perspective.
Pour revenir aux boss, ils auront généralement des schémas d'attaques qu'il faudra retenir (détecter le mouvement et/ou les sons pour savoir quel type d'attaques ils feront), mais c'est un peu ch**nt car il faudra attendre toujours le même court moment pour attaquer, ce qui fait une boucle +/- pénible. J'ai d'ailleurs trouvé un des premiers boss (un oiseau en feu) plutôt compliqué, je comprenais pas vraiment comment esquiver certaines attaques (problèmes de perspectives en partie) et quand exactement l'attaquer. Les suivants étaient moins gênant, mais en général il faut améliorer son équipement au max, et gagner quelques petits niveaux pour pas subir trop de dégâts. On est assez dépendant des niveaux et de l’équipement ici, en partie dû au manque de potions notamment, mais aussi parce que sinon vous avez d'un niveau à l'autre limite le double de dégâts subit !
Ceci étant dit, le grind est moins présent comme dit précédemment, on a pas forcément besoin d'avoir trop de level en plus, et ça monte assez bien.

Globalement c'était assez plaisant, un peu plus amélioré que  Napishtim sur tous les niveaux, avec des décors un peu plus travaillés et variés. Je note cependant quelques petits bugs : notamment le fait de devoir utiliser la synchro verticale sinon je ne pouvais pas avancer dans le jeu (à cause d'un double saut qui étrangement n'arrivait pas assez haut si désactivé), ainsi qu'un crash.... au moment où je voulais sauvegarder. Heureusement que je sauvegarde souvent, cependant, c'est arrivé une seule fois au début du jeu (mais du coup ça me faisait stresser après certains passages un peu chaud ^^ ')

+ Graphiquement plus travaillé que  Napishtim
+ Scénario un peu plus bavard dès le début
+ des combats de boss plus travaillés
+ du grind moins long
+ des phases de plateformes plus intéressantes et travaillées

- reste un poil court
- un peu trop dépendant des levels
- des combats de boss un peu répétitifs/longs sur certains points
- phases de plateformes parfois un peu pénibles à cause de la caméra (fixe) / perspective
- magies et équipements un peu limités et basiques

bref, sans être une perle, cela reste un bon jeu d'action rpg assez plaisant à parcourir",1627577490,1627585370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

YS is a serie that went many directions along the course of it's history, but to me, this era of Origins-Felganah-Naphistim was, and is still the best. After that, it went for a team character-driven type of game instead of a solo character inventory filling up style like it had always been, and personaly, I didn't like the change. I'm not saying the new era is bad, lots of people enjoy it, but I don't like it much. I prefer my RPGs when they are simpler with tons of scripted equipments to find, like old games like Soul Blazer or newer ones like Dark Souls. 
Now don't be fooled with my limited time spent on my games. I just recently discovered Steam, but I have already played most of them on other consoles well above 100 hours each. 
Back on YS Felganah, this is awesome, especially for old-schooled gamers who enjoyed the 90's when games were just about questing 15 hours or so on good mechanics and a well written story before moving to another one, just to come back to it months later because the experience was so good. I hope that now that we are going back so strongly to 2d metrovanias, another trend will also surface for these 3d zelda-ish pretty soon. By that, I mean, no time grubbings fetch quests, but strong gameplay centered around a good atmospheric story where you develop your character as you go from temples to temples till you get to the ending, and with that, sidequests that feels more like minigames than repeated chores.
If that day happens, Felganah would be a perfect blueprint to start with.

The boss fights mostly just heavily punish you if you try to play aggressively, which forces you to play in an extremely boring ""jump around like a jackass until X happens, attack a couple times, run away, repeat."" Some of the bosses are cycle based, but others seem to be completely random in which attacks they use and are only vulnerable after very specific ones, or sometimes only after a singular attack, which they sometimes just won't use.. until your winning attempt where the boss happened to use that attack often. These problems combined with high HP totals makes for frustrating and/or boring boss fights.

The combat is fast and responsive, bosses are challenging without feeling cheap (well, most of them anyway), the town atmosphere as well as its various colorful residents are very charming, the exploration is interesting without feeling as cryptic/maze-like as earlier titles, and the music is top-tier across the board. 

The only real negatives I would levy against it is it feels like a game that should have more unlockables than it does and its achievements are just a troll. I am not an achievement hunter at all but Ys games are some of the few that I would consider it with since I find them so enjoyable and appreciate their short length compared to contemporary action RPGs, but this game really does not respect your time when it comes to achievements. Several are charming/funny easter eggs and I appreciate that in this game and the two preceding games, but then some are just absolute shameless grinding, like the infamous escort achievements you have to do six ~50% playthroughs for as they are a missable event that occurs in the game that the achievements ask you to do once for EACH difficulty and does not count retroactively. That is not fun or interesting; that is just busy work. I don't think most people will care, though, and I really only do on principle since I don't care about achievements most of the time and just care about doing the ""hard"" stuff like beating it on Inferno.

Also don't start on Inferno, lol.

TLDR; If you loved Ys VIII (as it seems like the most popular one nowadays) then I think is the BEST example of seeing where the series really came and developed from. If you loved SNES action RPGs like Mana/Soul Blazer then this is a great example of where that kind of game could have gone if they kept being made. If you've never touched any of those things, then I would recommend this game if you are seeking a fast-paced action game with very minimal RPG elements and a brisk pace that you can wrap up in 6-10 hours while jamming to extremely good string-rock-percussion music the whole time.",1625517515,1625517515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b][i]Ys: The Oath in Felghana est un remake de Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, sorti juste après Ys : Ark of Napishtim. Techniquement, même si chacun des deux jeux à du mieux et du moins bien par rapport à l'autre, c'est globalement la même chose.[/i][/b]


[b][i]Ys III[/i][/b] ne dispose pas de traduction française officielle, mais une fan-trad réalisée par [url=https://www.nanami-ys.fr/?page=Traduction] Nanami[/url] est disponible et facile d'installation. Vous n'avez donc plus d'excuses pour ne pas vous lancer dans cette aventure !

[b][i]Graphiquement[/i][/b], c'est comme pour [b][i]Ys VI[/i][/b], ça ne me plait pas particulièrement, mais je ne les trouve pas moches pour autant. De plus les portraits des personnages sont toujours très beaux.

L'[b][i]OST[/i][/b] est correct, mais il y a encore des musiques bien trop technos à mon goût.

Le [b][i]gameplay[/i][/b] n'évolue pas beaucoup lui non plus, mais il reste sympathique et relativement plaisant. Dans cet opus on perd la possibilité d'équiper plusieurs accessoires, ce qui est bien dommage. En revanche, la magie fait son retour et c'est bien plus sympa que les armes élémentaires de [b][i]Ys VI[/i][/b].
Les niveaux et l'équipement restent extrêmement importants. Prendre un niveau ou changer une pièce d'équipement pourra vous permettre de passer un boss qui vous posait problème.

L'[b][i]histoire[/i][/b] est encore une fois relativement classique, en revanche, il y a moins de mise en scène dans cet épisode quand dans [b][i]Ys VI[/i][/b].


[b][i]Sans grands changements par rapport à Ys : Ark of Napishtim, Ys: The Oath in Felghan n'en reste pas moins sympathique. Il vaut largement le coup, si vous aimez ce style de jeu.[/i][/b]

It's also NOT a BAD game. It's definitely not worth the time/money.

I loved Ys: Lacrimosa of Dana, so wanting to play more Ys, I bought this game on sale for around $5. I played and beat the game on the hard difficulty. My in game time played was around 13 hours and  I did all of the optional quests and got a few of the optional achievements. My steam time was 20 hours, therefore I spent 7 hours redoing stuff after dying and failing to reach a save point. There is roughly 13 hours of content in this game if you want to do a full completion.

Game play follows this pattern:
1. Talk to people in town -> You get asked to go somewhere.
2. Go to next dungeon -> fight monsters and explore -> unlock new item/ability -> reach the next boss
3. Fight the boss and lose -> go back and grind 1-2 levels -> fight the boss and eventually win.
4. Repeat until end of game.

The game is NOT an unplayable buggy mess and exploring the dungeons is actually fun, therefore this is not a bad game.

Unfortunately, all of the characters and the plot are completely predictable. There is nothing interesting or shocking that will happen in this game.  The dialogue is 90% skip able and you will still know what is going on. The frequent need to grind out level ups to beat the next boss is slightly frustrating. Therefore, this is not a good game.

Overall the only reason I bought and played this game was because I really loved Ys: Lacrimosa of Dana and I wanted to learn more about Ys Lore, but in all honesty the only thing I got out of this game was a little bit of back story about the blue haired sidekick Dogi.

My suggestion is to skip this one and read a synopsis online if you're truly interested to know what happens to Adol on the island of Felghana.",1620540917,1620540917,False,0,0,0.444444447755813599,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I had played that game as a rental on the Super Nintendo back in the 90's, but given my skill as a little kid and the lack of time during a rental, there was no way I was going to beat it. This is a nice way to finally experience that game, which I had read about in magazines like Nintendo Power, and after playing even a small amount of I wrote fan fiction for it - that was some of my first creative writing ever. Clearly the idea of being a sword wielding hero in a fantasy setting appealed to me, and here there's a lot more story and world building than in something like the early Zeldas.

This is the first time I've played a 3D Ys game, and I was a little bit worried about the shift from 2D, but it's done surprisingly well. The action and gameplay translate to this new perspective quite nicely. There are some areas where the game is effectively 2D and doesn't take advantage of the 3D, but in most of those cases I think it was a good choice because it helps with the platforming.

The one odd thing is that some animations on the 3D characters are pre-rendered in 2D - this looks very strange, though not necessarily bad. I can only assume it was done as a performance optimization, because if it was a stylistic choice it's very unique and generally seems out of place with the rest of the visuals (if you've ever had an enemy in Halo 5 switch to a lower resolution while animating in order to maintain framerate, then you've seen a comparable effect, except here it will happen 100% of the time).

The gameplay is fun - I particularly liked the gem system with its various upgrades that granted you different abilities you were forced to choose between, but that you could easily swap out at a moment's notice, like fire immunity or an extended wind-swept jump. Otherwise it's pretty hack 'n' slash.

I played on the normal difficulty, and for the most part it was excellent: challenging, but I could improve and move past the tough spots. There were a few bosses that I got very aggravated by, but leveling a little bit and learning their moves better usually did the trick.

Though, my biggest complaint about the game is around its achievements, and how they're related to the the difficulties. Achievements do not stack, and there's even a specific achievement for doing the same quest across every difficulty. I have no desire to repeat a game like this 5 times, let alone on a [i]lower[/i] difficulty than I initially beat the game. It's a poor choice and I don't know why they chose to do it this way.

This game has a long, long history to get to the version available today. First released on consoles in 1989. The initial version of this remake came out for PC in 2005 (but was Japanese only), PSP in 2010, and then English text in 2012 - which is when it finally came to Steam. Mad props to the developers for still supporting this game for so many years. After I finished playing they released a patch to include an English voice track in 2020 (so I have no comment on whether it's any good or not). That's over 30 years to get to this version of the game. Wow.

Ys: The Oath in Felghana is not the best game ever, and certainly there are plenty of better action RPGs out there. But you get to experience modernized version of an entry from a seminal series first hand. It is a great continuation of the Ys on Steam, and the updates ensure that this remake is the definitive version.",1619906993,1620851288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Two of my 30 attempts had the boss on the ropes with one hit left. Frustrating. I didn't consider myself a low level. I'm somewhat of an OCD player, as in I like to finish off every enemy in an area before going forward. No, I don't sit there and intentionally grind, but for this boss I had to! I went back to a particular area and grinded for idk 20 minutes. Then went back and FINALLY defeated them after 40 or 50 attempts haha. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

Everything else about the game (graphics, sound, mechanics) is great. The story is very basic classic RPG but enjoyable.

One oddity I notice is that sometimes double jumps will sort of ""slow down"" causing you to not fully travel in the direction you want to go, (including when using the wind power move). It almost feels like the character might be slightly rubbing against the wall? Possibly the background wall, or the foreground invisible wall? It doesn't happen a lot but then when you really need to travel that extra bit of distance midair and it messes up, it can get really frustrating. It's happened during boss battles but mostly I notice it when I'm trying to reach secret ledges and the character will suddenly start to drop off short.",1619826436,1633882821,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[/h1]
[spoiler] 亚特鲁和多奇坐船到了8年多没回的多奇的故乡菲尔盖纳，刚到故乡就亚特鲁英雄救美救下了多奇小时候玩伴爱蕾娜·斯托达特！
麦克盖亚伯爵这似乎在调查什么奇怪的力量，而他手下的骑士切斯特·斯托达特似乎有头绪了，开始准备进行搜索。
亚特鲁和多奇住进旅馆，第二天多起准备去山上找老师并调查魔物变多的原因。
亚特鲁则在小镇逛街，找爱蕾娜，并得知她一直在找她失踪半年多的哥哥切斯特···在小镇广场听说提格雷采石场坑道出现魔物，需要救援，镇长和矿工头都在里面很久没出来了···于是亚特鲁前往救援。
采石矿的隧道中遇到矿工头杜伊并给了主角仓库钥匙让主角随意拿取，去仓库路上遇到魔道师杜兰并试探性打了起来，而后杜兰似乎觉得亚特鲁实力不咋样但是还是打算回去和某人汇报下···进入仓库取得最近刚挖掘出来的炎灵之手镯，允许主角丢火球了！
在采石矿深处遇到了镇长埃德佳，他希望亚特鲁帮忙调查采石矿里面的遗迹！
进去后打Boss，而且只能用炎灵之手镯丢的火球攻击···干掉后获得星月雕像。
出去的时候镇长和切斯特·斯托达特骑士对峙，似乎采石场被封锁了，而切斯特似乎对照顾爱蕾娜很反感，总想着当领主的骑士！
回到小镇后埃德加镇长和亚特鲁说小镇在麦克盖亚伯爵就任后政策一直不好，而切斯特居然丢下自己妹妹去为他卖命。但恰好被爱蕾娜听到了！爱蕾娜不敢相信伤心地跑了出去，亚特鲁追出去并和爱蕾娜聊天。
爱蕾娜不知道切斯特为何会变成这样，但是只要哥哥还活着就好很多了，她感觉东北方的“埃鲁邦兹遗迹”那是她哥哥切斯特性情大变的原因。

在教堂时候发现皮埃尔神父去了“埃鲁邦兹遗迹”，于是接受委托救神父，还得到遗迹钥匙。

进入遗迹的祭祀场，看到了切斯特和皮埃尔神父，切斯特对充满好奇心的亚特鲁很不满，于是打起来，打赢后神父劝架却被剑指着怂了，而麦克盖亚伯爵突然带兵进来，伯爵本想干掉亚特鲁，不过切斯特打算将其踢下熔岩断崖！神父被关进地牢。

可惜主角没扑街，在熔岩断崖下，还在宝箱里捡到能在熔岩里行走的神器火龙之守护，熔岩最深处找到能跳起来飘一段路的风灵之手镯。拿到后杜兰突然出现嘀咕着主角拿到了第二个杰诺斯之力，不能让主角继续玩下去，顺带召唤boss，打Boss~在大空洞那获得布雷西亚秘药，使用后终于能高速移动冲冲冲了！再打一次Boss后获得落日雕像。

回到遗迹上面的主角遇到正在等着主角的切斯特，他威胁主角交出雕像。
不够这时候爱蕾娜和多奇来阻止切斯特，不过切斯特嫌弃爱蕾娜碍事，而8年前离开小镇的多奇和现在的切斯特没啥差别。并声称自己成为骑士舍弃过去，and别再妨碍他！

回到小镇上，埃德佳又开始数落切斯特，尼古拉斯主教想办法让神父出狱，以及杜伊想起了废坑深处的壁画上似乎画着和雕像有关的东西。于是多奇再去找老师咨询，而亚特鲁去采石场下面的废坑。

在出城前往废坑的时候，爱蕾娜追上了将自家祖传的可以在存档点传送的翼之护符送给了亚特鲁，并称切斯特始终是她哥哥，希望切斯特一切都好！

在巴雷斯坦城门口女仆弗兰在埋怨看门人安德烈没看好孩子！
在遗迹门口遇到跟着他城主父亲跑出去的男孩，这男孩又脆又慢还容易扑街！送回去后城主夫人伊莉莎贝特要亲自答谢主角！于是又要等半天ing···（其实是要和几个人都对话一次），然后获得辉石之佩饰，装备后可以获得更多的矿石。本以为还能继续摸鱼，没想到切斯特突然出现并将其赶走！

从采石场里断桥对面捡到的鲍勃的挂坠，交给村子里的爱达的老妇人，换取鬼火之宝珠可以照明+分辨真伪物体！而且爱蕾娜也在那！

进入采石场废坑通道，看过壁画后得知说的玄乎其玄的信息，整理起来就是：勇者杰诺斯用剑和神器封印了魔王加尔巴兰，而亚特鲁是杰诺斯意志的继承者。并得到杰诺斯留下的使命之石板，并获得2段跳！并得知神器一共4件！而使命是在神器落入恶徒之前获取到！在废坑最下层打Boss并获得暗黑雕像！

这时候去镇长埃德佳那会看到神父皮埃尔在主教的帮忙下被释放了，并从镇长知晓一个传送，加尔巴兰的魔王征服了菲尔盖纳，被魔王支配的人和精灵变成了魔物，杰诺斯勇者借助众神的力量消灭了魔王，而附近海域有个杰诺斯的海岛上的居民在12年前因为瘟疫扑街了！镇长建议亚特鲁拜访多奇的老师贝鲁哈特他似乎知道更多信息！

陪镇子上的小女孩安娅玩寻宝游戏，最后东东都给主角！
在码头，爱蕾娜述说这个地方风景很棒，小时候她哥哥总是忧伤地看着对面的小岛，然后送爱蕾娜回小镇！

进入亚鲁登山脉寻找贝鲁哈特，在山腹处又遇到等待多时的杜兰，并丢出Boss跑！并找到了贝鲁哈特，得知之前知晓的故事都是真实的，在杰诺斯消灭加尔巴兰时候，将加尔巴兰的力量分为4份封印在神器雕像中！没办法根除魔王只能封印，而1年前魔物出现就是因为封印松动的原因，而麦克盖亚伯爵似乎想借助雕像的力量自由操控魔物来实现自己的野心。而最后一个雕像就在山上而且多奇已经去找了！

在山脉里能捡到4个巴姆之叶，交给镇上的养比卡多的舒格能换取卡特鲁之灵水。
玩到这时候我才发现翡翠戒指要给酒馆的男人能get更好的东东！结果我给女老板了~QAQ~

在跳不过去的大坑前遇到多奇，亚特鲁跳过去后，多奇给了亚特鲁可以冲破巨石的地灵之手镯。继续探索获得可以在冰面上行走不滑的石之靴！
在冰封之洞里打Boss并获得白光雕像！4个雕像共鸣导致山崩并将路堵住了，地灵之手镯都不行，好在山崩后多奇找过来并撞开巨石一起回去找老师贝鲁哈特。

路上果然遇到切斯特，因为多奇早就看出切斯特并不是真的甘愿做伯爵的手下，这次他道出实情，切斯特和爱蕾娜都是杰诺斯岛出生的。岛上的居民被麦克盖亚雇佣的魔道师召唤的魔物屠了，爱蕾娜失忆！切斯特要复仇，要把巴雷斯坦城变成地狱来报仇！

切斯特刺伤多奇后亚特鲁不得不将雕像给切斯特，将多奇带回贝鲁哈特那得知12年前贝鲁哈特还是巴雷斯坦城的骑士，那时候在不知情的情况下参与了屠杀村民的任务，唯独无法对那对兄妹下手只好将其交给镇长并隐居打探麦克盖亚的目的。1年前魔物出现后切斯特找到他并得知真相并打算复仇。

亚特鲁先回小镇通知镇长，在镇子门口看到好多士兵尸体，镇子里爱蕾娜和安娅被像傀儡一样的士兵围攻顺带英雄救美，然后和镇长讨论的时候修女说爱蕾娜不见了，可能是去城里了！亚特鲁只能去城里找咯！

在城门口遇到女仆想知道城主和城主夫人的情况，而边上的士兵因为危险怎么样都不想进去！在城东顶层遇到了城主夫人伊莉莎贝特和两个孩子。将实情和他们说明后，爱丽瑟会给个象牙白键！
在城东打Boss并获得风鸣之银管！
在城西顶楼遇到尼古拉斯主教，并得知礼拜堂那似乎有通往地下水路的路口，在地下水路遇到爱蕾娜，爱蕾娜了解了实情后觉得切斯特的做法不妥，不应该将无辜的人牵连进来。还get了钟楼钥匙！

通过钟楼钥匙进入钟楼，并跳跳跳！跳到吐了才拿回4个雕像！并在钟楼顶部看到切斯特即将手刃麦克盖亚伯爵，而伯爵依旧在找借口，不过亚特鲁来了只能先解决亚特鲁！

切斯特和亚特鲁战斗的时候伯爵朝楼顶逃去，切斯特只好放下战斗追上去。在楼顶，爱蕾娜追上了，阐明自己在听到切斯特说那些事情后也想起了过去的事情，并希望切斯特放下过去，复仇没办法安抚痛苦地离开的村民，父母也不会愿意看到这样的结果···

突然整个地区开始震动起来，本以为是伯爵还做了什么，没想到伯爵一切都是听从尼古拉斯主教做的···尼古拉斯主教这时候来到楼顶，阐明雕像的力量已经传回加尔巴兰那了，之前协助切斯特复仇不过也是这个目标的一部分！本想解决主教的切斯特哪怕有杰诺斯之剑不敌杜兰的魔法而被击飞，只好亚特鲁出马了！然后呢！亚特鲁也不敌扑街！

尼古拉斯主教打算把作为解除封印的杰诺斯一族的末裔切斯特带走，不过爱蕾娜替代了切斯特并希望亚特鲁帮忙照看切斯特。

回到镇子上，镇子埃德佳很意外居然是尼古拉斯主教是元凶！
而贝鲁哈特回来组织和维护秩序，亚特鲁则前往小岛，离开之前看一下切斯特，他觉得他没资格拥有杰诺斯之剑于是给了亚特鲁！

到达码头，多奇早就等亚特鲁很久了！本打算一起去救爱蕾娜结果到岛上伤口复发倒地晕倒，只好亚特鲁自己出马了！

在神殿前，遇到杜兰，原来修女娜露就是杜兰！！原来娜露这么做都是为了报恩···而现在终于可以放下12年前的罪孽了···(⊙﹏⊙)

进入黑暗神殿，拿到可以消灭不死怪物的银之铃，以及最强的拉巴尔之铠，红莲之槌。在黑暗神殿最深处的存档点保存后回到镇子上打造最强装备！然后回来打Boss！！

见到加兰德的时候他还嫌弃修女不中用···打倒他之后还疯狂地说神的复活已经无法阻止！！进入神殿底部，爱蕾娜让亚特鲁快逃，似乎魔王苏醒已经无法阻止似的，并看着魔王慢慢苏醒ing
好在这时候切斯特出现救下爱蕾娜！！

然后开始打最终Boss加尔巴兰，并封印它！！
不过剧情可不是这么安排的，剧情里打完后Boss依旧在苏醒，于是切斯特打算用杰诺斯之剑和雕像引爆小岛的自爆装置来干掉魔王，并让打晕爱蕾娜让亚特鲁和爱蕾娜先离开！

小镇上，那些死了不断复活的魔物，在爆炸后全部倒下消失了。小岛在爱蕾娜、多奇、亚特鲁的见证下消失了！诅咒、魔王、还有杰诺斯的使命通通消失了~

最后亚特鲁要离开了···爱蕾娜一直闭门不见，其他人要留下来重建菲尔盖纳。只有亚特鲁离开···在码头，爱蕾娜追上亚特鲁为其送行···
留下总有一天会和哥哥一样守护菲尔盖纳的誓言，将来亚特鲁回到菲尔盖纳的时候见证爱蕾娜是否履行了自己的誓言！

El juego sigue las mismas estructuras de siempre de ir del punto A al B siguiendo un orden más o menos estricto (aunque te podés llegar a olvidar de terminar alguna mazmorra y vas a tener que volver para avanzar en la historia) pero lo que más me chocó fue el hecho de que el diseño de niveles híbrido entre entornos abiertos y entornos simulando una vista en 2D con scroll lateral no me termina de convencer, entiendo que lo hicieron así por el juego del cual se basa (Ys III - Wanderers From Ys) pero contrariamente a lo que pensaba hace más de 10 años el uso de mapas pasilleros se me hacen predecibles, algo repetitivos y siento que me lastran un poco la exploración. Por estos motivos me gustan mucho más los otros dos YS que comparten motor con este.

La música es FANTÁSTICA así con mayúsculas, te alienta muchísimo a jugar con su ritmo frenético aunque no sé si será porque jugué en normal pero el hecho de farmear cada tanto me cortó mucho el ritmo de juego casi sin pausas que recuerdo de antaño (quizá haya jugado en fácil antes), dicho esto es otro juego de la saga que tiene una música muy memorable y muy disfrutable.

Jugabilidad: Lo mejor del juego y de la saga en general es la fluidez con la que uno se mueve y ataca con el personajes, la respuesta a todos los comandos que introducimos tienen respuesta rápida, el personaje se desplaza a gran velocidad y reacciona instantáneamente a todo, el combate siempre se siente fluido

Duración: Lo justo y necesario para que te den ganas de rejugar en dificultades más altas, una primer partida puede durar alrededor de 8 horas

Dificultad: El juego es un reto desde la dificultad normal y en los niveles más altos requiere de aprender patrones y explotar cada segundo de debilidad de los enemigos, el mínimo error es un Game Over, sin embargo muy pocas veces el juego se llega a sentir injusto.

Rejugabilidad: El aumento de dificultad hace que un jefe que pudo parece fácil en la dificultad anterior empiece a requerir cada vez más estrategia no es solo un aumento de stats sino que a veces se acomplejan algunas habilidades.

Sonido: La música es típico rock épico al que nos tiene acostumbrados la empresa Falcom con esta saga, te llena de energía para seguir yendo de frente enfrentándote a todos los enemigos que te cruces.

Historia: No es nada de otro mundo pero teniendo en cuenta la duración del juego se sabe mantener a lo largo del mismo, nunca llega a ser una molestia.

Resúmen: YS: Oath Of Felghana es un ARPG con controles muy fluidos, pero una jugabilidad muy adictiva, uno puede pasarlo tranquilamente en fácil o proponerse un verdadero reto y sufrir en las dificultades más altas pero siempre sabiendo que todos los retos son superables.",1616460856,1616460856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After starting the game on Normal, I went through it and it generally was a pretty enjoyable action RPG experience. Was a bit on the easy side, but it was satisfying slashing through enemies to the tune of some pretty adrenaline-pumping music and classic video-gamey sound effects.

Then came the first boss, which I died to at first. I laughed and tried again. And again. And again. And again. It seemed like there was something I was doing wrong, like there was a puzzle or mechanic to the fight I wasn't figuring out, but no. You really just have to jump around wildly to hope to dodge the attacks and get your hits in when you can. After what seemed like a dozen deaths, I finally beat the first boss.

After a few minutes more of dungeon crawling, I ran into the second boss, and this is where the frustration started to settle in. I kept dying and dying and dying and dying until I just couldn't take it anymore. Again, there isn't any deep learning mechanic to this boss, it's literally just jump over the wide projectile disc it throws at you again and again, while simultaneously trying to angle yourself just right so that your tiny fireball will hit the boss. 

You may say that I just don't like games that test my skill, which might be a fair enough statement. But I like a game to start with a reasonable difficulty and slowly ramp up as I get accustomed to the controls and mechanics. For example, I always play Kingdom Hearts games on Critical, the highest difficulty, because I've mastered the controls and overall feel of the game and the most difficult setting is the most fun.

Also, before anyone says it, yes. This game has an easy mode and even a ""very easy"" mode. But after already investing 90 minutes before I discovered this wasn't something I wanted to play, I'm not willing to go through all that again for a chance at it being something I actually like and want to continue playing.

I am just not that proficient at this game. So let us begin and talk about Oath in Felghana.

Gameplay:

In terms of gameplay, it is basically the same as the other 2 Ys games from this era. You run around with tight controls, advance through the story, find 3 artifacts that serve as your special abilities, upgrade your weapons and armor, level up, beat the bosses and complete the game. A very simple, yet tried and true formula that I can never get enough of.

The wind ability allows you to spin, do lots of damage and, most importantly, hover in mid air. The earth ability allows you dash attack and block enemy attacks and finally the fire ability allows you to shoot fire balls. Unlike in Ys 6, thank the lord, you have a double jump in this game instead of a poorly executed dash jump. You buy new weapons at the shop or find them in treasure chests. Upgrading your equipment is done through applying cleria ore, sorry, I meant whatever the ore in this game is called. Luckily for us, a lot of treasure chests contain a bunch of this stuff, so you should never have problem upgrading your equipment. 

Difficulty:
This is the one Ys game where I have to talk about this because I do legitimately think that there are issues here. Now, I have beaten this game on Inferno mode, so I am, at least, somewhat proficient at this game but even I find myself having to grind for levels for boss fights. But that is not the problem. The main problem is after the sparta moment. Basically, you are dropped off to an area with lots of powerful enemies and 2 boss fights back to back. You do not have access to the shop during this segment and it annoys the f out of me. Now the first boss is not too much of a problem, at worst you can just level up and overpower it but the second one not only requires you to level up but also get used to its stupid platform mechanic. I am all for difficulty, but this game has way too many sudden difficulty spikes early and especially mid-game, imo.

The Presentation:
Jesus.....like....wow!! This game has a phenomenal soundtrack on top of using what I consider to be the best art-style in all of Ys. It is not my favorite Ys soundtrack, that honor goes to Origin, but I would be lying if I didn't say this was a straight up banging soundtrack. For those who are feeling nostalgic or curious, you can also switch to the original soundtrack from Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys. Oh yeah, this is actually a remake of a really unique but bad game). I say unique because in Ys 3, Adol actually speaks....... a lot. Something I miss in the rest of the series but not much we can do about that. This game also has english voice acting and I ABSOLUTELY adore it. It is REALLY good.

The Story:
While a part of the of ""Winged Ones"" story-line, all things considered, this game is mostly contained within itself. Like, the only connections to the ""Winged Ones"" is shown with the backstory of the island and the Hero Genos who actually worked with them to stop an evil Ash Esmelas creature known as Galbalan. We wouldn't see the origin of this monster until Ys6, a game that came out before this remake. All things considered, it is a simple yet charming story.  

Overall:
Unlike with Ys6, I can, without any worries, recommend this game. With its tight gameplay, phenomenal soundtrack and beautiful graphics, this game manages to stand out among the series. I do think that the sudden difficulty spikes are a problem BUT the game is still fair. Sure, I can't beat Nightmare Boss rush but you can find youtube videos where people basically destroy this game using its mechanics. Casually, it is a fast game with some grinding here and there. Professionally, it is a fast and technical yet simple Action Rpg with excellent presentation. If you are an Ys fan, I highly recommend this game. I still prefer Ys Origin, Ys 1 and 2 over it, and I do think that Ys6 has the better town and NPCs but the quality of this game is simply undeniable.",1611722948,1611722948,True,4,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,True,False,False,,,

I will write what I care points for each game as below:

- GamePlay:
Each YS game has different gameplay between all YS series.
for ""Ys I"" and ""Ys II"" are the same gameplay with little more development for ""Ys II"", they are simple & fun for an old and short game.
For ""Ys VI The Ark of Napishtim"" and ""Ys The Oath in Felghana"" and ""Ys Origin"" are the same gameplay system with little difference.
I don't know why, somehow ""Ys Origin"" gives me feels like ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd"".
For ""Ys VII"" and ""Ys Memories of Celceta"" and ""Ys VIII"" are the same gameplay concept, the development becomes better from ""YS VII"" to  ""YS Memories of Celceta"" and a lot better for ""Ys VIII"".

- SoundTrack:
This part should be notified because it's very important and I will no say more because the ""Ys"" Series one of Falcom games if you don't know why because they care about soundtracks on their works.

- Story:
If we talk about a story, I will not write about it letterly.
all I say is, ""Ys"" games are the same world and each part in a specific area of it. they are connected indirectly, Regardless of the main story for each game.

overall as always I saying for Falcom games, I enjoyed every millisecond of the ""Ys"" series.

I write my view after completed ""Ys VIII"" and looking forward to upcoming ""Ys"" games.

Note:
I Played the ""Ys"" series in order as the following:

-Ys Origin
-Ys: Memories of Celceta

Story: Aside from the typical 'collect 4 magic artifacts and defeat the ancient evil' plot, it's one of the best Ys stories. The story of Chester and Elena is one I won't be forgetting any time soon and the voice acting dub patch was well done and certainly helped me connect more to the characters. It definitely pulled at my heartstrings at times and Chester was a really relatable antagonist with a good backstory that I can't elaborate on because of spoilers.

World-building: In Memories of Celceta you learn more about Adol, but in this you get to learn more about Adol's travel companion Dogi. It was cool coming to his homeland, seeing the town he grew up in and learning his backstory.

Art/Graphics: Really charming and have a very 90s anime style to them. Much like all of Falcom's games from this era.

Combat: It is the same as Ys: Origin due to being on the same engine, it's a lot more simplistic than newer Ys games where you get skills and can combo and stuff, but simple isn't always a bad thing and it's still a fun system, it has a very old school Zelda feel to it.

Bosses: They are VERY difficult, some people might not enjoy it, but I'm a masochist so I really enjoyed it. All I'll say is tfw your action J-RPG becomes a bullet hell.

Level/Dungeon design: Your typical Ys. Lava level, ice level, underground waterway, forest, cave, etc, but even though I've seen these levels many times they're designed well with good platforming sections and secrets to find and are always fun to explore so I never mind the formula.

MUSIC: Peak Falcom. Among one of my faves of all their games. Incredible. Super catchy melodies, shredding guitars and keyboards that sound like they came straight out of an 80s Yngwie Malmsteen album, beautiful violin pieces as well.

I really don't have any complaints, for a simplistic, old-school low budget J-RPG from the early 2000s, this game is pretty damn great and I can't recommend it enough.

To be more authentic to the gameplay, this review will contain lots of swearing, along with traces of the raw manly emotion you get when you prove your superiority to a bunch of pixels.

The game is a mix of action adventure with very light RPG elements, and those work about as well as they do in any other early YS game – really fucking awkward. The story is okay, there are plot twists and stuff, and it taught me a very valuable lesson that it’s okay to be a mass murderer, as long as you’re a noble or somewhat sorry. 

But the main dish, the main reason to play are boss fights and Adol. 
The boss fights are awesome. They are quick – or at lest they feel quick –, they favor player’s aggression, they are varied, and they are absolutely fucking brutal. Controlling Adol is no less great, as long as you get all the tools. He’s fast, but not too fast, he’s got good range, but nothing to ridiculous, he’s got his own kind of bullshit to throw at things, but it’s minor in comparison. 
The bosses and Adol combine, and the end result is something truly, honestly, swear to god amazing. When I finally beat the boss, I don’t just scrap by, I fucking speedrun it. I feel like I’m actually good at videogames, and that illusion persist up until the next boss fight. And this stuff is addictive. About a third of my game time in other YS games is just them idling in background, but here? Here for two days I spent almost my every waking moment swearing at this motherfucking lizard, this motherfucking robot and that motherfucking Chester, who probably ought to marry me after all he did.

Seriously, this made me remember that I actually still love videogames. You can’t buy this. Well, I mean, you can, but I’m talking about the feeling.

1. It doesn't feel like a story about you, not a grand adventure. You're  an NPC in a background who does all the dirty work.
2. Main characters are not great, including ""love interest"" and Dogi is a boring bland forced companion with no cool traits.
3. Grinding and weird difficulty curve.
There are very few manual save points and no autosaves in the game, that makes every death very frustrating and a huge time waste.
Every area requires certain lvl to be rather comfortable to be in which means you're going to grind even on normal.
What's even worse - last area has only 2 saves - at the start and at the end.
And last boss absolutely requires you to grind your weapons and armor to the max lvl.

Technically it's a remake of [b]Ys III: Wanderers from Ys[/b] (a 1989 game) but only in a very loose sense. Only the very basic skeleton of the story was borrowed, with the rest being expanded and rewritten to better fit the lore of the later games (in particular [url=store.steampowered.com/app/312540]The Ark of Napishtim[/url]), plus all the NPC's in the town now have unique portraits and personalities with their own little stories to tell, just like in other modern Falcom games.

This game was made right after The Ark of Napishtim and runs on the same engine and follows largely the same gameplay formula but massively improved. It's much more fast paced with Adol getting access to many movement abilities and the magic was overhauled to be much more useful. E.g. you can run at great speeds, double jump and do a whirlwind attack for both crowd control as well as gliding through the air, every type of magic can be charged Mega Man style. Virtually all grinding is gone, important upgrades are just given to you as you progress naturally, you don't need to farm materials to upgrade your magic, and it's impossible to run into enemies outside your level range (except for 2 tiny secret rooms). You can safely play the game blind as there are only 2 missables ([spoiler]Augite Brooch and Talisman of War[/spoiler]) and they're not very important and easy to find on your own anyway.

With the grinding gone the focus is now on the mechanical skill. The bosses are much harder than before and you can't heal during a boss fight. Generally speaking, the bosses are pretty well designed and definitely the highlight of the game, however there's a few overtuned bosses towards the end of the game, and some of the hitboxes are questionable. It's definitely the hardest game in the Ark engine trilogy, providing a tough challenge even on Normal. However, if you're a fan of hard games like Dark Souls you will feel right at home, retrying the boss fights and learning their patterns. Still, going back and grinding just one level can often make a huge difference due to the way the damage is calculated in this game.

The story while expanded is still not much to write home about. It's your classic ""collect 4 MacGuffins and defeat the ancient evil"" formula, but some of the characters are nice, especially Elena (the main girl) and some of the villagers and clergy. Ironically, background characters are better written than the main cast if only because they don't have to be so dramatic all the time. The game was recently updated to include the English voice acting (from the PSP version) and it's a pretty decent dub with Heather Hogan giving a great performance as Elena, and there's even Melissa Fahn voicing one of the kid characters using her Neptune voice. Sadly, there's no Japanese audio (yet) as XSEED doesn't own the rights to it.

When it comes to Ys games, the soundtrack is always a joy to listen to and The Oath in Felghana is no exception. It has some truly beautiful and blood pumping tracks like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATBcYQjE6rw]this[/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzaK_ueHY4]this[/url].

The story is pretty by the numbers, but then again, it is a remake of a 1990 game, Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.

Challenging difficulty (although you can choose between 6 different difficulty modes, so you can go super easy), addicting hack and slash gameplay, that pushes you to go to the next enemy as fast as you can, since slaying enemies leaves active power-ups that you can pick up. These include XP multipliers, added defense or attack stats etc., that are timed, so if you want to keep these active, and even raised, you have to kill more enemies while they're active. Very rewarding and addicting.

The graphics are simple, but have a very pleasing visual style, with fully 3D modeled levels and 2D sprites for the characters and normal enemies (the bosses are polygonal, because they are HUGE). The music is simply magnificent, and IMO the best the Ys series has to offer. The devs are still actively improving the game from time to time, so they've patched in the English voice track, that was exclusive to the PSP version before. And 2 new soundtrack options were included this year, from the original Sharp X68000 and PC-88 versions of the game!

Compared to Ys Origin which uses a similar gameplay style, this game is a bit more challenging in terms of general dungeon  progression which I really enjoyed. But then the boss fights happened. 

Unlike Ys Origin where almost all the bosses, while challenging, still manage to be fair, that's not the case with Felghana. Most of this game's bosses are hard to an unfair extent for their own various reasons, almost rivaling a certain couple infamous bosses from Ys I. This game has quite a few bosses, so this frequency of unfairness might be off-putting to some people.

...But maybe not my favourite one.

--Gameplay--
It's classic Ys. You know exactly what to expect if you've played Origins before this one. Felghana does have a bit more of a 2.5D platformer style, though it also certainly has normal 3D area's.
You fight, level, grind, upgrade and explore your way through the story, getting frustrated at bosses every other few hours.
Bosses as usual also are very hard, and I needed to grind and upgrade a bit to slay them all. Unlike Origins, this game only has 1 character and 1 story path to play.
Personally though, maybe because I played Origin before, I did think this game was a bit less fun than other Ys games. Not bad at all, but just not my favourite Ys game.

--Graphics and Artstyle--
It's Falcom. Also looks a lot like the Trails in The Sky series, mainly because they were developed around the same time!
Felghana has a bit more of a bright, colorful artstyle and is a lot more varied than the very dark Origins, which I seem to keep bringing up because they are so similar.
So yeah, not the best graphics, low-res textures, rough geometry, but brimming with charm IMO. Character portrait art is just so good again as well!


--Music and SFX--
Very, very good soundtrack. This is standard with any Falcom game, we know that by now!
It's not my favourite Ys game in terms of music though, but still VERY solid.
Some specific tracks I'm still listening to weeks after playing!
The sound effects are fine as well, though I do recall having heard some of them before, like in Gurumin!
I played the game with the Japanese voices patch installed, so I can't comment on how the English voice acting is.


--Story--
Yeah, okay. I think the story was kinda weak this time. It didn't seem to tie in with the other Ys games at all, almost standalone. I never really felt connected to any character or anything that was happening.
The plot generally also is pretty predictable and standard. Especially if you've played a lot of other Falcom games, there's a lot of stuff that will feel very familiar to you.


--Technical and bugs--
I think I had 1 crash, making me lose a bit of progress... But other than that, no problems! Ran at a solid 60fps, which you should expect from a game this old I guess..

But yeah, If you like Ys, play this one too! Play all of them! Please!",1598455298,1598455298,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Story: Very cliché

Gameplay: For this game, difficult means annoying. I recommend playing on easy. You have to spend a lot of time grinding to do reasonable damage, more difficulty means more boss HP, so it just makes the game more boring, repeating the same attack patterns of the bosses time and time again (You can't change the difficulty either).
The combat is dull in my opinion, on the flip side you get to unlock new skill from time to time and boss fights are kind of fun at first.
There is a lot of backtracking too, checkpoints are sometimes too far away from each other and most times this game wants to be a platformer, seriously, if you are not into them you might find it very boring.

The plot is basic, the characters stock JRPG, but the care and attention put into the game overcomes whatever weak points might be inferred from this. There is only one town in this game, which seems like it would limit the story and immersion, and truthfully the townspeople are not deep characters [i]per se[/i], but they really feel like a little community, and you can tell the writers cared enough to update their dialogue as the story progresses and give all of them little hooks to connect them to our hero Adol. 

Of course, most people probably play [i]Ys[/i] for the gameplay, and it's really good here too. The controls are tight, which helps for platforming sections, you unlock abilities as you go through the game and to my recollection all are useful in different circumstances. The environments and dungeons are all varied and it just feels satisfying to go round killing enemies, which is what most of these games are made up of. The bosses are genuinely challenging and it feels good when you come up with a strategy to beat them.

Because of the game's difficulty, it's pretty brutal for Achievement hunters. A casual player can choose their difficulty but if you want all Achievements you'll have to get crazy good at the game. Other than that I recommend it absolutely. A great example of taking an average JRPG story and doing the best you can with it, adding lots of charm and care, so that WE care.

Edit: After an update, the game now features voice acting! This is a bit of a mixed blessing. I really like hearing Heather Hogan as Elena, she was Colette in [i]Tales of Symphonia[/i] and her voice will always be iconic for me for that reason. The guy who does Dogi is fine, but the guy who does Chester was way too hammy for me - which is weird, cause he's done good work in the [i]Danganronpa[/i] series. Additionally I found a lot of the minor NPCs' voices annoying, either too exaggerated (Margo), or over-emphasising every other word in a failed bid for some degree of [i]gravitas[/i] (Chester, McGuire, Edgar, etc.). Honestly, it sounds like it could've been a problem with direction, or just a rush-job, which is a bit of a shame. Still, you can skip through dialogue from characters you don't care to hear.

They've also included the option to play with music from the PC-88 and X68000 versions of the game, which is a nice little touch.",1595159505,1637886575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Felghana's a big favorite and that's probably because it has quite possibly the highest CBT pain potential of any Ys game. You heard it right here folks.
BUT BESIDES THAT, it improves on Napishtim's basic gameplay and fixes the jank dash jump into something you won't have pained recollections of when you get to be in the nursing home. The bosses are better, you get a cool rival (which you sort of have in Napishtim, but it's done better here I think), and overall it's just a solid hack and slash. If I had to critique, it's that the game only really starts showing what it can do in using your skillset in platforming when you get to the Sealed Tower and by then the game's almost over.

That was when I realized that I had to refund the game because I didn't want to put up with janky gameplay.

Just play YS Seven instead, it's better... by miles. Ignore all the people who recommend this game, they are clearly blinded by Nostalgia, there are good YS games out there nowadays but this game has aged like mouldy cheese. It's literally the most bare bones Action RPG ever made. YS SEVEN makes this game look like a freaking joke by comparison, you have more attacks, you have dodging, you have charge attacks and also the ability to play as lots of different characters each with their own playstyle. Get that game, don't waste your time with this trash.

Honestly if you absolutely have to play this game, you might as well play the PC Engine version because as bad as it is, at least the music is good, that is... if you want a history lesson on how bad Action RPG's used to be because quite frankly, though the YS series may have pioneered the genre... it didn't really start out well, bumping into enemies to hit them!? Why do people still think that is acceptible today? Let alone this.

Every YS game before YS SEVEN is obsolete now, they are important to play if you care about the history of the genre but otherwise, let that history remain history.

Now what games should you play? Well I highly recommend YS Memories Of Celceta as a starting point, really easy to pick up and play, very forgiving too, it's the best way to learn how the modern games work. Afterwards you have YS SEVEN and YS VIII, both great games that are worth your time.

The game plays like a mix between the first 2 YS games and the modern style YS games and is a unique entry in the series, its overall a great game gameplay wise. The OST is incredible too, is starts strong and keeps its momentum and the story and characters are good. This is also the first game to give Dogi significant screentime.

Now onto my next point, this game is hard as crap even on Normal, the amount of deaths I've had is probably around 100, deaths in dungeons also tend to be quite punishing as the save points are rare, usually at the beginning of a dungeon and then just before the boss, a death while going through a dungeon resets you to your last save point. Deaths against bosses are fair as youre allowed to retry instantly which is really helpful because you'll be sure to die to certain bosses a lot, like upwards of 15 times. This is assuming you don't take ages to grind, which will make the game easier but will take ages.

This game is a masterpiece and anyone who enjoys a good hack and slash, or an action RPG game, it is a must try and it has a lot of replay value if you like to challenge yourself on various difficulties and go for a better time on the leaderboards, be it on finishing the game or on boss rush.

From here I'll mostly talk about my experience with it compared to my experience on the PSP version.
From the start I noticed it lacks some content such as the gallery that unlocked pictures as you finish the game or the boss rush on each difficulty, and new game plus which kinda sucks since it not only allowed you to keep your items, it also granted bonuses that were really fun to mess around with. The boss rush is missing the easy and nightmare difficulties, and when I saw that this port didn't had the double boost that heals the player when used, it scared me to think of how hard would it be on harder difficulties, however it was not as hard as I expected, and an interesting extra challenge for anyone coming from the portable version, there is also the matter of voice clips that when I first played where completely absent, however that's not the case anymore since they were added into the game but some parts are still missing which can be a bummer.

The one advantage it has over the PSP version is the graphics, the higher resolution really makes everything looks cooler, and regardless of these very little issues, it's still an awesome game. The gameplay and plot is unchanged from previous releases, the controls are very fluid and can be changed to however you prefer.

The feeling of dark isolation and helplessness. The feeling that an evil force controlled your destiny. Perhaps we can compare these emotions with the terror that enclosed the people of Kenai.

Yet even the worst of nightmares offer some hope of survival...

Kenai's fortunes lay in this stunning warrior of indomitable strength. His bravery was renowned throughout the land, as he had once saved the ENTIRE world from similar destruction. But now his challenge was greater than ever before. The insurmountable ferocity of Demonicus was frightening, even to our courageous hero.

The skies had darkened, and the Earth shook as Demonicus applied his brutal force and displayed his savage rage! There were to be no prisoners in this holy war of Good over Evil. Demonicus unleashed his awesome size and strength against our hero, but Adol's cunning wit allowed him to avoid and eclipse all of the Aliens' fatal blows. 

There was more than just a miracle behind this saviour of tormented lands. Who could fight such courageous battles and manage to pull victory from such impossible odds?

I'd say I mostly like it however I would warn that the bosses can be incredibly hard and require development of a good strategy which means you could die many times before you find a way but at least there's a save point before them. The monsters are cool and the bosses look awesome. It takes time to get used to the control and gameplay but I'd still say the game mechanics keep it interesting. Grinding is boring in some games but in this I kind of enjoy it - there's always a bit of challenge to it since each type of enemy needs to be defeated in a unique way - and the more money and orval you collect means the better weapons and upgrades. Initially, some of the level/area choices are pretty standard and not too imaginative - like mines, lava world, ice world, that sort of thing - however it seems like it's hard to find imaginative world ideas in most games. It is cool though that you can enter new areas with new abilities by melting ice or breaking rock. The voice acting is good, the music is fairly basic, and sound fx are good. The motivations of characters often don't SEEM to make much sense. I still have no idea who the main character is, why he's there, what his background is, what his motivation is, etc... he doesn't even have a voice actor - instead his words are narrated. So to me that's a weak point, however there are elements of the story and other characters that look quite promising (I'm not quite done the game yet).",1592390596,1592390596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Honestly, more than just JRPG people. In fact, many JRPG people are going to be turned off by the skill requirement, which I think is the case for many of Falcom's games.

Another great entry in the Ys series that uses the same Ark engine also employed in Origin and Napishtim, making the gameplay fast paced and easy to pick and play (but difficult to master and beat bosses if playing on Normal difficulty and up). 

Very solid story that includes plot twists and Adol meeting a number of interesting characters in Felghana. Falcom has recently (early 2020) provided voice audio to this Steam version so it was the perfect timing for me to jump in and play and complete this game. The voice acting is not complete (only important characters and story dialogues are spoken) but it's actually very good and adds to the immersion and character development of the game.

I can't recommend this version for replay value or achievements though.

The music is give and take in terms of composition. Some songs are better on older versions of the game, but there were some nice choices here as well.

The story was changed in some peculiar ways, but it retains the original sequence of events well enough with some added spice. Nothing drastic or damaging.

Some of the achievements feel more like menial tasks than something secret or an accomplishment. They want you to play every difficulty setting, but the aggravation and time associated with that isn't worth it unless you like punishing yourself.

There's a debug mode to make the game a little more user friendly but I'd hardly say it's necessary. Using it also prevents you from earning certain achievements, which feels really cheap to me. Either let it work for all achievements or don't include it at all.

The only thing I'd say debug mode is good for is getting to maximum level for the achievement. For whatever reason they put in a weird failsafe to prevent you from being too powerful; monsters give you less experience each time you gain a level.
Max level is 60, but by 50-53 gaining levels slows down into an absurd amount of time.

Artificial difficulty is an understatement in terms of how the game tries to be challenging.

Pros:
- Poca exigencia en los requerimientos de PC, ya que es un juego muy antiguo es algo que se agradece, anda hasta en una tostadora
- Historia simple y facil de seguir con algunos puzzles sencillos
- La música de calidad, algo típico del Falcom Sound team JDK (btw tengo la partitura para piano del tema principal si alguien la quiere agregue y se la mando.)
- Jugabilidad divertida, nada como destrozar a esos enemigos que te masacraban cuando ingresabas a una zona no acorde a tu nivel.
- Duración: me tomó 33,3 horas (lo hice a posta xD) para completar el juego al 100%.

Contra:
- El farmeo, es común que en esta saga uno deba farmear ya que al estar por debajo del nivel de los mobs / jefes uno no provoque ningún punto de daño a estos, es algo tedioso pero entendible.
- La falta del Español (este un tema bastante debatible, sé que las traducciones cuestan dinero, pero este juego en particular no tiene tantos textos), dejando de lado esto es un juego EXCELENTE.

J'ai joué en nightmare le I (oui je suis un fou) et le II.
J'ai donc attaqué fleur au fusil cet épisode en nightmare sans savoir la galère dans laquelle j'allais.

En effet le III est une regression sur plusieurs plans.
Il n'y a plus d'item de soin, on ne peut pas sauvegarder quand on veut.

On se retrouve aussi à jouer à Mario en sautant de plateforme en plateforme...

Le saut parlons en, avant d'obtenir l'attaque du vent, c'est une vraie plaie de combattre les créature volante.

Enfin les combats contre les boss sont extremement dur et pour certains la difficulté se rapproche du I, je pense notamment au dragon de glace qui fait en boucle son attaque ultime (qu'on ne peut pas éviter entiérement....) et le boss de fin qui m'a demandé 3h de try...

On est obligé de levelé avant chaque boss, alors certes sur YS on a toujours cette phase de farm, mais là c'était systématique et surtout c'est loongg.... quasiement 2h de farm à chaque fois, pire à la fin les mobs max sont lvl 48 !!! 
Le lvl Max d'Adol est de 60, le boss final demande au minima etre 53 (je l'ai fai lvl 55) imaginez le temps que cela prend !! Et bah je peux vous le dire 5h !!!

Si on enleve le temps de farming le jeu m'aurait pris 15-20h...

Le dernier point noir, les succès steam.
dans les 3 autres versions d'YS que j'ai joué, on peut faire tous les succès en une seule partie ! Ce qui est génial, mais dans celui-ci il faut refaire le jeu 6 FOIS !!
C'est n'importe quoi !! Alors oui les succès en soit sont inutiles, mais je le vois comme des défis à compléter pour finir le jeu à 100%. Et j'aime bien finir mes jeux à 100% sauf que là, c'est imbuvable...

Le scénario quand à lui est disons assez court et simpliste, on a cependant droit à quelques rebondissement et belles scènes, mais le jeu (hors difficulté) est assez court.

Si comme moi vous voulez faire tous les YS, je vous conseille fortement de ne pas jouer celui-ci en nigthmare.

Mon prochain YS sera le VI, celui-ci ayant servit de base pour faire le III, je vais l'attaquer direct en normal car je n'ai pas envie de revivre les mêmes chianteries que le III à savoir les heures interminable de farming et les phases de plateforme qui apparemment sont pire que celui du III (Comme en témoignes les commentaires)...

I've said it before, I'll say it again: Falcom has never made a bad game. Ys: Memories of Celceta is no exception. If you've played any Ys game before, you know what to expect: a fun ARPG with lots of combat and exploration and a simple, but nonetheless compelling story set in a fantasy world heavily inspired by real-world history and mythology. The joy of an Ys game, usually, lies in the invigorating, fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay.

The Oath in Felghana is, perhaps, the best of the ""classic"" Ys games. There's very little narrative, and the overall structure of the game is very simple—cliched, even. But while the story may be lacking, the combat (and dungeon design) is brilliant.

主要还是想谈谈剧情（伊苏系列的男二真是每一个都精准的集中了我的性癖，不管是盖修还是修梅尔还是阿鹰还是切斯特，怎么都这么香的）关于切斯特的人设和剧情安排，感觉和库洛还是挺像的，不过切斯特嘴更毒，做事也更狠，两个人相似的地方就都是为了复仇当了幕后黑手的枪，切斯特的复仇比起库洛完全针对岳父，更像是一种自虐行为，和镇上的npc对话我们可以知道，切斯特曾经也是个阳光向上又积极的好青年，如果不知道真相的话，也许他只是把亲人的逝去永远埋在心底，但是那场屠杀他应该是从来也没有忘记过的，他一定责问过自己，为什么活下来的只有自己和艾蕾娜，家人族人都那样凄惨的死去，只有自己得到幸福，真的是可以的吗？切斯特最大的罪，就是AOE式复仇，将整个巴雷斯坦城的人卷入这场灾难，明明城里的人都是无辜的，他为什么会这么做？真的只是被神父蛊惑了吗？我个人认为，他这样极端的行为，正是他自虐的表现，他无法原谅活下来的自己，就像X花雪月的帝弥托利一样，他觉得，对于族人来说，仅仅只是把“幕后黑手”干掉根本就不够，只有把当年施加在他们身上的这份痛苦完全还给他们，才能平息族人的愤怒，杀人对他来说也是痛苦的，也只有自己也承担下这份痛苦，才是赎罪，切斯特的思考模式，完全是基于逝者身上的，他以幸存者的身份去理解逝者，这就是他痛苦的源头，艾蕾娜由于不记得当年的灾难，心理要健康的多，所以想得开，至于救下夫人和她的两个孩子，可能也是看到了他们想到了当年的自己和艾蕾娜，也可能是想给自己一份最后的救赎，切斯特的死是必然的，他的罪过是无法偿还的，有一个弥补过错的机会，自然，该落幕时，是不会怯懦的。
说来也是讽刺，勇者的后裔成为了打开潘多拉魔盒的罪人，和这篇土地完全没有关系的人，反倒成为了救世主，最终结束灾厄的人，却是罪人。
最后的boss也很有意思，被抽干魔力的干尸竟然不止一个，魔王复活这件事，是不是已经发生过很多次了呢？所谓的魔王，也只是被造出的道具，给世人降下天罚的，不是神明，伊苏系列的神和人类的关系也是有够奇怪的，感觉每一部都不一样，也许到了罗门篇能好好填坑吧

Para muitos, esse remake é o melhor jogo da série Ys. Pessoalmente, não posso afirmar isso pois não joguei todos, mas certamente está entre os melhores. Sou suspeito para falar pois joguei ambas as versões, mas essa review não vai focar em comparações.

Adol Christin e seu amigo Dogi visitam Felghana, cidade-natal de Dogi. Uma série de reviravoltas acontecem, surgindo novos inimigos e cabe a Adol proteger a cidade dos vilões. Acredito que a história de Oath in Felghana não é razoalvemente bem explicada, e as vezes fica até mesmo em segundo plano.

É na jogabilidade, no entanto, que Oath in Felghana se destaca mais. É um JRPG de ação, praticamente hack'n'slash, em que hordas de inimigos são derrotadas, com três possibilidades de skills, além de efeitos de boost na movimentação e velocidade de ataque do herói, que tornam o jogo mais divertido e empolgante. Alguns inimigos requerem skills ou itens específicos para serem derrotados, o que obriga o jogador a revisitar dungeons, aumentando o senso de exploração. Esse é um aspecto interessante, visto que afora isso o jogo infelizmente é muito linear...

Mas talvez o aspecto mais marcante desse jogo é a dificuldade. Há vários níveis de dificuldade para todos os tipos de perfil, dos mais iniciantes em JRPGs aos mais hardcore. Felghana é um dos jogos mais desafiadores que já joguei, mas isso não significa que a dificuldade é balanceada, pelo contrário... em algumas situações há poucas alternativas para se esquivar de um ataque inimigo, dando a impressão de que não basta apenas ser muito competente nas batalhas (em especial os bosses), mas também contar com um pouco de sorte... (ou desviar de projéteis à la Matrix)

O jogo em si só possui um final, o que é um pouco frustrante, visto que, com tantos níveis de dificuldade, seria mais compensador obter um final alternativo depois de tanto esforço. Infelizmente não é o que acontece. Aliás, o jogo possui várias limitações: existe um número muito limitado de espadas e equipamentos, e o upgrade desses requer o farm de ores que podem ser facilmente obtidos encontrando um chest numa dungeon, por exemplo. Isso quer dizer que a evolução do personagem é limitada ao progresso do jogo... Dificilmente você vai ficar OP nos primeiros capítulos do jogo.

Felghana é um JRPG com uma proposta de jogo um pouco diferente dos outros JRPGs. Quando se explora uma dungeon, o intervalo entre um save point e outro costuma ser grande, e dependendo de qual nível você esteja, é necessário retornar ao último save point (o que pode consumir muito tempo) ou retornar à cidade para upar seus equipamentos. É possível avançar nas dungeons, mas é muito arriscado. Você não sai carregando um monte de poções no bolso como em outros JRPGs, mas depende do drop de alguns monstros para recuperar HP por exemplo. É importante ressaltar isso, pois pode se tornar uma experiência muito frustrante morrer no meio de uma dungeon e recomeçar do zero...

A trilha sonora é memorável. Em alguns momentos te deixa ""pumped up"", e anima as batalhas. Mas, as vezes varia de acordo com o cenário do jogo: de repente muda de uma melodia triste para um rock energizante, rs.

Concluindo: devido as limitações de época, não se pode exigir muito de Ys: Oath in Felghana. Recomendo o jogo se você é fã de JRPGs das antigas e procura uma experiência bem desafiadora. Atualmente, a XSEED acrescentou dublagem e opção de trocar de BGM para os jogos originais, o que deu um pouco mais de vida ao jogo. Apesar de tudo, é um dos meus JRPGs favoritos.

If, like myself, your first experience with Falcom's long-running Ys franchise was through 2017's Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, you're probably expecting certain things from an Ys game. Let me be clear right away: The Oath in Felghana is -not- like Lacrimosa at all. No flash guard or flash dodge mechanics, no dialogue choices for protagonist Adol, a much more sparse narrative, and higher overall difficulty. Bosses in particular are unforgiving even on Normal difficulty; make sure you're prepared to grind out some levels on a regular basis!

However, as long as you can adjust your expectations accordingly, I'd say there's a lot to love in this little action JRPG. Exploration is still satisfying as ever, and whilst the story is fairly basic, it's still engaging enough to desire seeing it through until the end.

There are no dodge or parry, except for simply getting out of the way with basic movement and/or spells.

Ys: The Oath in Felghana is simply amazing and incredibly fun to play.

I think Felghana is one of my favorite Ys games so far. 

The gameplay is like a hack n' slash mixed with exploration to get new items and equipment. Soundtrack is excellent in this game and the supporting cast is also very good. The story was interesting although very short.
It took me around 11 hours to finish on Normal. Gameplay is quite challenging, the bosses are hard and requires you to learn their attack patterns, pretty much like a Dark Souls of action games specially on harder difficulties.
The controls are great, feels very fast and responsive and the difficulty is awesome even on normal.
Graphics look very nice and I had no issues or frame drops here, runs perfectly and stable.

It's incredible how a 15 year old game is still a lot of fun even in 2020. It's even more fun than a lot of current action hack n' slash games these days.

If I had to recommend a Ys game from this generation, it would have to be this one. Ys Oath (3) takes what was created in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/312540/Ys_VI_The_Ark_of_Napishtim/]Ys Ark (6)[/url] and refines it into high quality material. Nearly everything in this game is an improvement over the previous, which was already reasonably decent. The following is a list of great positives present in Ys Oath, with some comparisons to the previous game, Ys Ark:
[list]

[*]Combat has been redefined and improved. For starters, magic does not directly affect sword mechanics directly anymore. Instead, magic is a secondary accessory to the main, consistent swordplay, which is a far better combination. This allows more creativity, as now the player can decide which magic to input at what time during a combo. In addition, Adol can swing his sword much more often in a single combo, making movement during combat very fluid and natural.

[*]Movement has much more freedom. Dash jump/lunge attacks from Ys 6 were finally removed, making exploring much less of a pain. New features in Ys 3 include the ability to double-jump, the ability to dash (run faster in general), and using magic as a means of transportation to explore otherwise impossible to reach areas. For example, wind magic can be used to float over a gaping chasm, or earth magic can be used to direct Adol in a specific direction if on a slippery surface.

[*]Story and characters simply have more depth. Simply because Ys Oath is one of Adol's adventures before Napishtim, Falcom can afford to give characters much more background stories, especially Chester and Elena. It seriously does not hold back on showing the drastic changes some characters have undergone in the eight years that have passed [spoiler]since Dogi left[/spoiler]. There are even serious references to Ys 6 in this game!

[*]Music has been given more life. In general, the music in Ys 3 is more upbeat and catchy, perfect for a fast-paced action game all about difficult boss battles. This is a Falcom game though, so a decent, if not fantastic soundtrack is guaranteed anyway.

[*]Boss design has generally been improved. No longer can [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814880836]a frog lick you once to death[/url], but more strategy is now required overall. I believe boss battles in this game overall are a lot more enjoyable and fair, especially the final boss. They may seem much more difficult at first, but there is much more freedom of strategy to beat each boss battle compared to all the previous Ys games.
[/list]

Ys Oath is not perfect however. There were some infuriating parts which made the game slightly tilting for me personally:
[list]

[*]Two achievements require six playthroughs of the game, where at least two need to be fully completed in order to finish some other achievements. Now I do not mind needing two playthroughs, but one on each difficulty is a tad excessive. No other Falcom game I've played has done this type of achievement.

[*]Slip, shockwave mechanics, and boss battles heavily dependent on RNG [spoiler](Looking at you, Gyalva and Istersiva)[/spoiler]. The very same from Ys 6, slip and shockwave mechanics are back, and they provide a significant challenge for some bosses. While I do appreciate the increased difficulty from it, I was definitely peeved whenever I did lose to it. As for RNG, while it was manageable, it became less of a patience check and more of a way to unreasonably extend the battle.
[/list]

In summary, Ys 3 is an excellent action RPG, whose small blemishes do not detract noticeably from the finished product. Between its smooth gameplay, its deep and engaging story, and its decent worldbuilding, there's a lot to love in this game. Just be prepared to spend a bit too much time on this game if you plan to 100%; otherwise, the experience is well worth the cost.",1579141249,1585070625,True,4,1,0.559977173805236816,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ys I 
Ys VIII: The Lacrimosa of Dana

Ys Origin
Ys IX: Monstrum Nox

Overall this game has the best of everything in the Ys series. The engine and gameplay from The Ark of Naphitism was improved by a long shot, the soundtrack is incredible, and the bosses were some of the best but most challenging in the series.

But on top of that too this game felt like it had a real sense of accomplishment every time you took down one of them. I felt like when I had a long grind session into a boss fight I couldn't beat, and had the patience to finally take it down I was absolutely thrilled. Especially the final boss, whoever came up with that fight is a legend. This game takes the cake for me in the series as my favourite for just how strong and quality it is from start to finish, and I look forward to tackling this game on the higher difficulties.

Gameplay is fun?? The game is Extremely Challenging if you play it on nightmare difficulty and above, requiring you to react under seconds to the point that some bosses can feel very unfair at times. (I saw the psp version on youtube, that game is much easier than this one).

I played Ys III for the TurboGrafx CD a long time ago, and compared to Ys I and II it was a much weaker entry because the voice acting was bad and the side scrolling combat wasn't that interesting.  I mostly played Ys III for its excellent soundtrack.  

Ys: The Oath in Felghana improves upon the original in every way except perhaps the soundtrack, which is about the same in terms of quality. 

Instead of side scrolling, Felghana uses a 3D isometric view that makes combat much more enjoyable.  The platforming gets a bit awkward with this perspective but it's serviceable most of the time.  

The spells are also a lot more fun to use, and every type is useful though I used wind magic the most.

While I never thought much of the story, Felghana does a better job at fleshing out the characters.  The vastly improved voice acting helps a lot.  

In terms of challenge, Felghana offers six different difficulty levels that should please everyone.  The harder difficulties live up to their descriptions when I played them during the timed boss mode that opened up after I beat the game.  

Oath in Felghana is a worthy remake that preserves what was good about the original while greatly improving upon it.

The game controls are very smooth and the music is awesome (a staple feature of the Ys series), but the action gameplay quickly grows repetitive and boring. All of that button mashing gets old, fast. 

The dungeons are also poorly designed and either too simple at some points or too confusing at others. It doesn't have the intuitive feel and sense of discovery that you find in really great action RPGs. The story is okay by anime adventure standards but it drags a lot. There are some cool boss battles but they are extremely difficult in an annoying way, peppered by RNG nonsense, and it doesn't feel like the combat and movement mechanics are robust enough to deal with the challenges that these bosses throw at you. The bosses also take forever to kill...the battles just go on and on.

- LONG(ER) VERSION -
The last time I enjoyed playing a game until my hands physically locked up in cramps I was getting my ass kicked by an angry fetus in a jar with a penchant for mechasuits and murder. While (as far as I've played) there are no mechasuit murder fetuses trying to kill you, there is still a great soundtrack, a lot of funky jumping with swords, and everything else in the world is trying to kill you, down to the tortellini-shaped murder slugs and the flowers that have clearly Had It (TM) with humanity's bullsh*t.

This game has relatively minimal controls and no camera control options, but that's not a bad thing and feels like a retro 90's video game, which this game technically is anyway. The player controls are pretty straight forward if you're used to games played only on your keyboard, and if you dislike the feel of it, there are two preset layout options to chose from and customise as you see fit. (The options launcher shows an option for a controller, so I imagine you could also just use your console controller if you prefer.) Haven't figured out sprinting or long jumps yet (my repeated failure at which led to said hand cramping), but it might just be that I need to pick a different set of keybindings; a controller feels like it would work best (button mashing doesn't kill hands), but I don't have one so I can only assume.

Story-wise, I won't post any spoilers. I'm not too deep into the plot yet but it does feel like a classic JRPG, only with significantly better translations than back in the day had -- no All Your Base grammar, no 4kids-era ""Jelly Donut"" localisation, just good ol' slightly-dated-meets-nostalgic 90's dialog and NPCs implying you're a dumbass to your face. I have a suspicion where the plot is heading and going to twist at, but I've played enough JRPGS to know the genre's usual structure, and the plot clues, should you chose to actually speak to NPCs multiple times, give you just enough info to be curious and move the plot along. It's not open world, but it has more than enough going for it to make that irrelevant. The characters all seem to have backstory, even the guy drinking in the inn/tavern, which is a nice change of pace compared to modern games' NPCs. There's visual storytelling as well as textual story too, such as what appear to be bloody crutches along where a monster attack plot point happens early on, among a few other things.

As for the soundtrack, just pull it up on Youtube. Saying ""it's great"" is a catastrophic understatement, like saying fire is a little warm. There was a guy on nico nico douga a decade ago called The Screamer who played violin covers of video game music, and while that may sound cheesier than the cellar of a Wisconsin dairy farm, that sh*t slaps. (It's also how I learned of the Ys series.) The town music sounds appropriately explorative, and the dungeon music sounds appropriately motivational sick beats for kicking (and stabbing) some literal asses. The fireball sound effects pair well with the dungeon theme where I left off playing, too.

Overall, if you've ever played on an actual NES, Gameboy, PS1 or N64, it feels and works like that did, but higher quality and screen resolution. At full price it costs about the same as an average takeout lunch, and on sale it cost about the same as one cup of name-brand coffee. It's up to you yo decide if that's personally worth it, but for me? I'll be here being blissfully rocking out to some fireballs and smoldering spiders.

If steam had a ""meh"" rating i would use it here. I still give it a thumbs up because YS is a pretty good series.
Pretty much the WORST 3D YS game, regular gameplay is fine and there is a lot more combat involved, (and 2x-3x more grinding in comparison to other games thanks to the new difficulty.) the BOSSES are some of the worst in the series aside from the final boss. I know ARK is generally frowned upon regarding the bosses, they are clunky, glitchy, some of them are super easy and some are absolutely terribly designed. Here bosses are designed SPECIFICALLY to annoy you, and waste your time rather than pose a fun challenge The difficulty is scaled that so the first bunch of bosses are going to be nothing but petty annoyance which reminded me of the stupid BAT fight from YS1. Then the game lets you easily skip up to 2-3 bosses by climbing a mountain instead of going into abandoned mine and frankly, those bosses deserve to be skipped. This game also introduced human enemies like chester, who get to decide whether you live or die depending on their mood instead of a logical pattern, which are fun bosses in retrospect, but even then YS ORIGIN did it 10 times better. The story is fine, it certainly isn't as good as the ARK and it pads out till the very end, but some small town interactions here and there manage to at least distract you from the fact that this is the worst game in term of bosses and progression by far. Barely mediocre and saved by the story+final boss.

伊苏的精髓在于通关后的BOSS RUSH，可惜一直手残，不靠等级碾压，很难通过。
伊苏F对我，是第一个玩通关的FALCOM游戏，虽然在04年就玩了空轨FC，可惜家里电脑每次读地图就卡死。06年买了这个碟，可惜是日语的，没玩。07年在同学用软盘给我拷攻略的帮助下，才打了一半，那年春节是第一次熬夜，在雪山磨啊，因为家里没有网，没有迷宫地图，迅速过关必须凭借攻略。直到中考结束，才通关了这个游戏。后来伊苏O，7代，双星物语2，空轨3部曲，都是一层一层的回忆。可是只有按图索骥，一点一点攻略的伊苏F，空轨FC，双星物语2，在没有成就的年代，手刷全收藏，才是我的日系RPG的根基。

It's been now 1 year since I played my first Ys game. It was this game right here. Back then I didn't know what to expect. I had played through all the Final Fantasy games just recently, and I craved for something new, something refreshing. And I found this game. Curiously I bought it, played it and the rest is history.

So what is the series about?

At its core it is a game series following a red haired boy's adventures all over the world. However, this doesn't mean you have to play the games in order or anything. Each game is a contained experience, apart from Ys I & II, meaning that you can start playing any game in the series, beat it, and continue playing any of the games next. It's kind of like Final Fantasy in that sense.

This game doesn't take too long to beat, but it trades it off with its difficulty. Lo and behold! This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played! My first playthrough took 24 hours because of that! And that was on Normal! Occasionally, the difficulty may seem unfair, but we'll talk about that later.

Story? It's serviceable. And that is actually why I really like this game; I don't need to read silly dialogue too much. After some gameplay, I am treated to a breather in the form of a story session that's more than welcome. It doesn't take too long to get back in the fray. I like good stories, don't get me wrong, but I really like the way this game handles its story. It doesn't get in the way, and if you want more than the necessary story sections, you can always talk to the townspeople.[spoiler]And maybe discover something useful in the process![/spoiler]

At this point I must praise the soundtrack. It is phenomenal! I have never heard such a great soundtrack in a game in my life and my first time playing this game really had me hooked. Part of the reason is most definitely the soundtrack! Despite that, the game has some pretty bad tracks too. They DO fit the place they play in but really, I'd just want more of that awesome violin combined rock action!

And then the meat of the game: Gameplay

The game excels in this department. Nothing is more satisfying than ramming your attack button at enemies and seeing them explode to bits and pieces. That is also a visual style I really like with these older 3D Ys games. I really love how the game gives you complete freedom in maneuverability. You can jump, you can eventually double jump, you can run REALLY fast, and after progressing in the game you'll get awesome magic powers that will help you get around easily. Oh and you can combine your jump and attack to hit enemies directly below you and stagger them OR execute an aerial combo. Of course there are also side quests. Some of them easy to find, others require you to explore a little more. Which just adds to the game's replay ability! There is no way you will find everything on your first playthrough (assuming you won't use guides or watch videos). 

There are also these ""dungeons"" that you go to, each with their own theme and style (and enemies!). They really make the game feel longer and larger than it actually is. In a good way! You feel like you've done a lot, even though the level is not that big. The game doesn't have puzzles, but it does have minor platforming. That makes this game even more interesting, because it's not just running around and killing things, you also have a level to scale and get through. Sometimes you'll need to light up torches or break walls in order to progress. Oh and killing enemies on platforms is a situation you'll have to apply tactics on sometimes!

Visuals are really nice. Maybe because I just like this kind of style in games, but the 2D sprite/3D environment really gives the game a unique look. Few games have this, which in my opinion is a shame. Environments haven't aged too badly. They still look great even though this game came out in, what, 2005? Something like that.

Usually I wouldn't need to do this, but this game requires it! Let's talk about bosses.

So, this is what the series is known for. Actually brutal boss fights that test your patience, willpower and skill. Each boss in this game is a challenge to say the least, and sometimes it might take you a very long time to beat one of them. Hell, about 50% of the time I spent on my first playthrough was probably just being stuck on bosses! So, are they good then? Yes and No. Some bosses are really fair and a pleasure to fight. This is helped by the fact that when you die during a boss battle, you can restart immediately from the beginning of the fight. No need for a file reload! And no handicaps either! Other bosses can be a pain in the ass, to put it lightly. Especially one boss comes to mind where the boss does random attacks and that can lead to you being stuck on a very small plot of ground. In that kind of a situation there isn't much you can do. There was one attack the boss could use and if it did use that, it would most certainly be almost impossible to dodge in such a small space. However these situations are very uncommon in the context of the entire game, and thankfully you can dodge nearly all attacks from bosses. That is a necessity on harder difficulties, of course, because you cannot heal during boss battles and you die from 3-4 hits (sometimes 1 or 2!).

Everything in consideration, Ys: The Oath in Felghana delivers a very excitable game, that you'll want to play again sometime, if you're like me. In fact, it is my favorite game in the series. I did like Ys Origin and VI, but nothing will beat the environments and select music pieces this game offers. It is a shame, that they don't do games like this nowadays. I'd love to play a modern version of a game like this.

If there was something to criticize, I'd like it better if I could change options inside the game, rather than from a config that you'll have to access outside of the game. But this is a minor inconvenience, hell, you'll even get treated for opening it!

I later picked up Memories of Celceta as I'm a big PS VITA fan and...You guessed it, promptly dropped it in favor of other RPGs (hello Persona 4!).

Fast forward to Christmas, a friend gifted me Ys VIII on Switch. I was a little cautious due to my prior experience, but thanked them and gave it a few hours. Something wasn't clicking, I was on the verge of enjoying it, but it still felt very...Repetitive, and confusing despite its simplicity. I was sure I was missing something.

Cue Steam sales, Ys: The Oath in Felghana @ 75% off. It looked like Ark, I was wary...But noting the overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews, I thought I'd give the series one last solid try before passing judgment. And goddamn am I glad I did. Ys: The Oath in Felghana was everything I could of hoped for and more. It's one of the best gaming experiences I had in 2018 (and the first game I beat in 2019!)

It starts off easy, and I was groaning that I'd wasted my money. I didn't like the idea of mashing buttons through 10 hours of mindless hoards of enemies. And then the first boss KICKED MY ASS. On my 5th attempt, I knew I'd love the game. Ys didn't care about me, it didn't care about being accessible, it throat-punched me until I knew who was boss. And I loved every minute of it.

After the first boss, I was swarmed a few times which led to quick deaths. Just when I thought I understood how to play, along comes boss 2 and throws a completely different style of combat at me. It was awesome. I was grinning from ear to ear. When I started seeing bullet-hell inspired patterns, I KNEW this was my game. I play a lot of shmups, so seeing that sort of gameplay in a game I was already loving the crap out of made me ridiculously excited.

I'm aware this is getting long and rambly, so I'll just say the following 10-14 hours were some of the most razer-focussed, well-executed action/RPG gaming moments of my life. This game has ZERO padding, it's balls-to-the-wall action the entire ride. Each stat point matters, and while I sometimes had to grind, it was fast-paced, rewarding, and exciting trying to keep my combo going for that juicy 1.99x multiplier!

After beating Ys: The Oath in Felghana, I feel like I understand the design principles behind the series and I'm really excited to get back to YS VIIII on Switch or Celceta on Vita (but not before buying and playing Ys: Origin while it's still one sale!).",1546417417,1546417465,True,14,0,0.649441540241241455,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Forget about the story. They shouldn't even have bothered. It's an action RPG. More action than RPG actually and as brutal as they get. At least if you play at one of the higher difficulty levels. The game have 6. Yeah that's crazy.

It's fast pace. Very energetic with an awsome soundtrack and with a simple but very neat gameplay. The game is mostly about bosses though. You go through a lot of mob, sure, but it's the bosses that make this game really special. So much so that when you have finished a first playthrough you can play the boss rush mode and if you love challenges that is where your life ends.

The bosses are terrible. They are great too. Their design is crap. or at least until you figured them out and that isn't an easy task. I think I called pretty much all of them unfair until I found a tiny little chi.nk I could work on. Serioulsy I can't think of a game with bosses less forgiving. You will need inhuman skills to get through the Nightmare Boss Rush. That and a full nerve-wracking afternoon + some cold water for your hands.

Be advised. It's not for everyone. Darksouls is for snowflakes in comparison.

It sits right between action and numbers-based RPGing, a kind of missing link between say, the Tales series and something like Zelda or Metroid, which means it has a little bit of something for everyone. Combat against normal enemies is fun, satisfying and not very difficult, with a kind of more-ish quality like popping bubble wrap. Boss fights on the other hand are extremely tough and require pattern memorisation rather than pure level grinding.
The story and characters are very cookie-cutter and unoriginal, but they're well-presented and charming and they never intrude for too long, so even folks who can't stand anime melodrama shouldn't be too bothered.

Falcom is known for awesome and uncompromsing OST's of course so that is to be expected. Of the three Ys games that are created with this specific engine (Ys Ark of Napishtim, Ys Oath, and Ys Origin) I feel that this installment is the best of them although you should definiely play them all if you find this adventure to your liking. The minimalist approach with a focus on fun-factor and a game that moves along at a more rapid pace is alive and well here. One thing that I love about the Ys franchise is that the games have an epic scope and are interconnected but never overstay their welcome; you won't find an excess of bloated content in this game or other Ys installments for that matter. The characters are also very endearing and Adol is a badass hero /adventurer if there ever was one. I've also played through the game on PSP and the Steam version is the definitive edition to own with the upgraded visuals and the ability to play on a high quality monitor of your choosing. I played on normal and the game is a bit more challenging than other Ys games on the same difficulty setting; this is especially true with the boss battles as you can't bail yourself out with healing items like in the party orientated Ys games, which will demand that you learn patterns and use good timing instead. For some of the most difficult sections there are some key areas where you can grind for an additional level or two fairly efficiently if need be so there is some flexibility available there.

Ys has always been a series where you rock out and kick some monster ass. The Oath in Felghana is no exception. One thing that really makes Ys stand out against other games is that Falcom’s primary focus is their “fun factor.” These games are challenging, yet crazy fun to play. The Oath in Felghana has decent graphics, an amazing soundtrack, near perfect gameplay and has real replay value. This game is one of the reasons why when Falcom releases a new Ys game, I pretty much scream at them to take my money. I only wish that there were more references to Ys 1 & 2, as there is a very Catholic style church in Felghana which makes Feena and Rhea seem like they don’t matter outside of the country of Ys itself and they’re living goddesses.

In Depth Review:

Graphics:

The Oath in Felghana has graphics like Ys Origin. You have a top down perspective and the characters look okay. There’s not a ton of detail to them, but there’s enough to know that each one was designed completely different. The stage design is detailed but doesn’t go overboard with it. When you’re in the mines, there are things you would expect to be in a mine. There are rail cars, wooden bridges, wooden scaffolding to support the dug-out ceiling, etc. This sort of stage design is carried out very well throughout all the stages.
The character art for dialogue is where you see the most detail in the characters. Even though the art is anime-styled you can see that there was a lot of thought put into each character’s appearance. I personally love the character art and think that this style is sometimes better than using 3D models. 

I only found a few monsters that were palette swapped. For the most part, they were unique and had a lot of variety. The bosses are where the game really flourishes with enemy design. The first boss you come across is a stone statue turned vampire-chick. I think Falcom did a much better job in capturing beauty while also making the boss appear dangerous. Now, the fire-breathing dragon on the other hand could have used a little more work. Falcom is not Square-Enix, they have a very small group of people that make these games, so I really don’t have any complaints.

Audio:

The music in Ys has been one of its strongest points since the original game came out. The Oath in Felghana has an excellent soundtrack. Throughout my playthrough, there has not been a single moment where I thought that the music was lacking. The only thing I wish had been done is some voice acting. It was the only real drawback I’ve found in the game, which is the same for Ys Origin. The lack of voice acting is a bit of a letdown, but it’s far from a deal breaker for me when it comes to buying future Ys titles.

Gameplay:

The Oath in Felghana is the first game in the Ys series to mimic the Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim style of gameplay where there is fast paced action that happens at the same time as moderately complicated 3D platforming. The entire Ys series is so much fun to play that the difficult boss battles aren’t even an inconvenience for me. I will very happily take on the challenge and figure everything out on my own without any assistance from a guide. Even the grinding parts of the game that I did, for fully upgrading all my equipment didn’t feel like a grind. It could be because the game has enough exploration to keep things interesting and the battles can change even when farming if the enemies come at you in different ways than you expect.

I’m not covering the story because I don’t want to risk any spoilers, but it is a much-improved version of the SNES game’s story. Other than Dogi and Adol and how they met, you don’t need to play the other games to be able to understand this one.",1535442607,1535442844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sadly YS went with their usual plan of difficult jump puzzles and having to go through a long trek if you mess up. Though there's a non fall mode it keeps disabling itself as soon as you fall, so you have to keep reneabling it. The jumping puzzles are also annoying as you have to use the wind ability but it often won't trigger when you use it. Though this is less problematic when you get the dash jump and double jump as you can avoid using it.

The story and character are okay but nothing special. Though you'll understand pretty much what's happening all the time.

One of the most interesting aspects of this Ys Trilogy (Oath, Ys VI, and Origin) is its pacing. This game never gives a break! You'll discover new abilities, new weapons and find new places to explore all the time. Time flies when you're hacking everything in seconds and doing it again just for a level up or getting enough gold and materials for the next weapon upgrade. Fun as hell :D

One thing that was kinda of a negative for me though. You'll need to grind a bit, sometimes a lot, because 1 level may be the difference between you getting destroyed in seconds or the other way round. This may put the skill of the player aside sometimes (so the level will be the winning factor), and even maxing your current equipment won't make a difference. It is a gripe of mine, and of course, it doesn't break the game in any way.

I would say 20 or 30, provided you play it like a normal human being. Interesting story; I'm getting into the Ys series. I played Ys 1 and 2, enjoyed them well enough, I left a review, you can read it. It's funny and erudite, and was written by a cutie-pie. But I found the hardcore difficulties for each game somewhat lacking for the most part. There are some plainly unfair boss fights in Ys 1, but in Ys 2 the bosses are mostly incredibly easy apart from the last boss.

So when I started The Oath in Felghana, which I had intended to play synchronously with the original Console/PC game Ys: Wanderers from Ys of which it is a remake, and still sort of am, I thought 'maybe I'll try Nightmare difficulty'. I didn't really find it all that difficult up until Gyalva, and I honestly can't tell you why I didn't just restart there and play on hardcore. Some heady cocktail of stupidity and stubborness. So here we are, 55 hours and a month or two later, following a long break during which I played and finished Brandish: The Dark Revenant (including the Dela content), another Falcom game which I deeply love and find profoundly relaxing, I only about an hour ago finished off Galbalan on Nightmare.

Wew lad.

My own stubborness and stupidity aside, it's a very good game. I enjoy the Souls games (only technically played Bloodborne, but I've played it a lot so I think I can say that) but I don't generally enjoy when games take things from them, which this does. Particularly it takes the no-pause rule, at least during boss fights. I've always found this feature silly. Apart from that it isn't that similar, and I think when people mention them as being similar to this it's just because they both have very difficult, set-piece boss fights separated by much less difficult but still challenging runs of monsters. And because the kids don't remember challenging games. 

I won't complain that Oath in Felghana doesn't have the bump system, because let's all be honest and admit that Falcom themselves got tired of the bump system about three-quarters of the way through programming Ys (that's being generous) and that's why they implemented magic the way they did in both Ys 1 and 2. And whatever may be wrong with the combat, at least it isn't Wanderers From Ys.

I know that 'dropped my input' has been made famous by that guy who gets paid to jack off on stream, but it does appear that Oath in Felghana does sometimes, for somewhat anomalous reasons, drop jump inputs. This definitely contributed to a few of my deaths. And I'm not imagining it, because I've read about it happening to others. 

It has a fun little animu plot and a bunch of characters with what Harlan Ellison once called 'telltale tics and tremors' that make you remember and become attached to them, like the guy who lost his ring, or the one who likes to eat a lot. You know, those guys. I'm shamed to admit I was genuinely moved by the ending. It was probably the best thing I could have seen after bouncing a ball of magic from my sword to a magic shield while trying not to get sucked into a vortex and shot with a beam by a floor monster.

So yeah, it's good, even great, but don't play it on Nightmare your first time, babies. Now I'm on to finish the god-awful piece of garbage this game is based on, and then to both of the Ys 4s.

This is definitely my favourite of the Ys series.  The story, characters, and music all tie together well, and when paired with interesting and well-balanced gameplay, it makes for an awesome experience.  

Note for all Ys Games:
I recommend playing them in the order that they were created rather than in the order of the Ys timeline as everything will flow better and no plot twists will be spoiled.  If you're just in it for the story, no need to ramp up the difficulty, but if you're in it for the true Ys experience and all the achievements, start on the hardest difficulty... only if you're ready for a challenge (this game is extremely difficult and when you finally take down those bosses, you really feel a sense of achievement).  Onto the review.

Gameplay Mechanics:
Combat:
Unlike Ys 1 and 2, you have a variety of attacks and movement available to you.  You have various physical attacks/combos, 3 types of magic all with normal and charged activation, a boost state (rage, special, etc.), and the most amazing ability of all... Adol can now push his feet into the ground with sufficient force resulting in him launching off of said ground.

Party:
Until you get to Ys 7, you go solo (no party).

Equipment/Inventory:
No crafting in this game but you can upgrade your gear. You buy/find all of your items and gear and monsters give you gold, exp, and raval (used to upgrade your equips).  Just like Ys 1 and 2, Adol is not a thief... breaking into peoples' houses and rummaging through their drawers will not result in you acquiring pantsu (I tried).

Quests:
While there is no quest log, certain NPCs will have things for you to do at varying times throughout the storyline.

Achievements:
One issue for me is that some of the achievements need to be done on every difficulty level.  This means you need to beat the game (at least up to that point) 6 times, and one of those achievements ""That's the Last Time, Kid"", can be missed (if you're after all achievements, keep track of this one).  This makes the whole process pretty time consuming.

Story:
Like all the classics, you are the hero. Go save that princess. Slay the boss man. Ride/sail off into the sunset. While there are no daring writing choices, there are no issues or breaks in the immersion which is just as important if not more important. Like my initial note, if you play this on a difficulty that is not challenging to you, you don't get the right experience.  If you start on a high difficulty, make it to the first boss, and experience difficulty, don't give up right away.  Watch a video of the fight and keep trying.  Only if you're certain that you can't beat it should you dial back the difficulty (it was hard with plenty of rage, but if I played on a lower difficulty, it would not have felt like I earned those victories).

It has none of the features of the PSP re-release, unfortunately, but is perfectly fine, running smoothly at 60 FPs with no drops whatosever.

All of the Ys games pride themselves on being very fast paced action RPG affairs, and OiF is no exception. It builds on the Napishtim engine games, and is the second of the series, the first being Ark of Napishtim itself, and Ys Origins being the final culmination of the games. Oath is difficult, even on Normal, and even for fans and devotees of the Ys series, and this speaks nothing of playing the game on Nightmare and Inferno if you're interested in achivement hunting all of the content. (which will require beating the game no less than 6 times, and time attack completely 3 times, as well as post rush boss content) Oath builds on the base of Napishtim and perfects it, removing buying healing items completely and forcing the player to rely entirely on drops and skill.

Ys: Oath in Felghana again tracks the adventures of Adol and Dogi after Ys 1 and 2, and returns them to Dogi's homeland of Felghana, and the town of Redmont. Soon enough, you come across Dogi's old friend Elana, and hear about her missing brother Chester, and the monsters that have been plaguing the land, and Adol and Dogi suddenly find themselves off on another monster crushing adventure, with a few hints and tidbits about previous games sprinkled throughout, linking the series through these quiet connections.

The gameplay is like the other Napishtim games, relying on combos, Focus (a shorrt lived but powerful boost to attacks and defense and combo ability), and spammable magic spells (a ranged fireball, an aoe tornado, and an invincible rock-dash) to let Adol cleave through enemies at blinding speed and rack up XP multipliers and temporary stat buffs. Platforming is frequent and sharp, with Adol being incredibly responsive to movements at all times, even when dashing at full speeds. Bosses often represent steep difficulty spikes compared to normal enemies, but this is standard for Ys games. Bossfights have a lot going on, but almost always feel fair in how they work (save for one lava boss), attacks are essentially always telegraphed, even if it's a quick tell, and so you can dodge and position properly. I didn't need to grind much at all, except for one specific instance  in the aforementioned lava land. As long as you fight every enemy you see, you'll have enough XP and GP for everything you need, plus a little extra if you want to buy a couple extra HP elixers (I ended up having the spare money for 3 by the end of the game)

The music is up to Ys standard, the classic mix of power rock and orchetral environment music, so if you're used to the series, you're going to get much more of that, and if for some reason Oath is your intro to the series, 1: Good luck, this isd a rough starter entry to the series, and 2: The music is fantastic, so enjoy.

Oath is a shorter Ys game and has an achievement for beating it in under 5 hours, but I'm confident it could be much much faster. Much like Origins, I think most players will play on one of 3 difficulties: Very Easy just to play the story and see the game, Normal for the usual challenge, and Nightmare into Inferno for the true Ys dedicated people (or people who hate their lives and want to grind out a boss forever because of 1 mistake - not for me). The boss rush extra content is optional, and unlike Origins, you only unlock a single extra bossfight and no other content besides achievements.

Overall, Oath is probably my second favorite of the Ys games I've played (Origins is my favorite but by a very narrow margin), and I've yet to play Napishtim, or Ys Seven. Oath has some of the best bosses in the series though, both in how you have to react and fight, and in the satisfaction you get when you finally best them. Strong recommendation - but also recommended you play Ys 1 and 2 first, at the very least, to be grounded in the series and have an understanding of how ""the game works"" even though the combat systems differ between the games.  Going from Origins to Felghana isn't a big step down - the graphics are a bit less, and Origins has more caracters, but you'll already be right at home with how the combat system works, and what's expected during bossfights and normal combat.

While Napishtim was objectively superior to Kefin in every possible way, it was still rough along the edges: effectively rebuilding a D minus/F-grade game's mechanics into something I'd place anywhere from a B minus to a solid C.

Meanwhile, there's the third game in the series: Wanderers from Ys, released on far more platforms than I care to list. A significant departure for the series, Wanderers was a side-scrolling action game that relied on linear platforming more than the traditional top-down labyrinths seen in previous and future titles. It felt less like an Ys game and more like a successor to games like Castlevania and especially Zelda II, another contested sequel. Generally considered a black sheep of the franchise as a whole, Wanderers from Ys was also the first game in the franchise to receive a widespread release in the West, appearing on all three major 16-bit platforms -- while the original Ys was limited to Sega's Master System and a limited IBM PC release, and the second game was only released on the TurboGrafx-CD, via a compilation of the first two games.

So with remakes of the first two games, as well as a new sixth entry in the series, Falcom decided that rather that going straight into developing a seventh game -- more on that later -- they would remake the contested third game in the series, using the framework they developed for Napishtim as a base. This development culminated in what is generally considered among the best games in the entire series: The Oath in Felghana.

While Wanderers from Ys was more or less a standalone game, Felghana reimagines many of the story's elements to afford a greater sense of continuity with future games in the series. That being said, the basic outline of the game is kept the same and Falcom focuses more on expanding existing characters than outright adding brand-new ones (though there are a few of those as well). This leads to a storyline that manages to stay true to the source material, while feeling more complete at the same time. The story begins with Adol and his travelling companion Dogi returning to Dogi's home village of Redmont after a fortune teller warns of disaster in the area. Upon arrival, the two adventurers find Felghana infested with monsters, a new figurehead installed by the Romn Empire (a recurring foe of Adol's) and worst of all, Chester Stoddard in league with him, causing even more problems for the ailing villagers.

Napishtim was a good start for a more modernized take on the Ys games, but Felghana smoothes out its predecessor's various issues, leading to a much more streamlined and responsive game. It also retains a similar graphical style, focusing on aesthetics over graphical fidelity. Wanderers from Ys' soundtrack was the only element of the game that fans generally liked -- with the TurboGrafx-CD/Perfect Collection, arranged by Ryo Yoneimitsu being considered the best iteration of the classic soundtrack -- but Yukihiro Jindo's soundtracks, consisting entirely of new arrangements of every song from previous versions of the game managed to deliver what many fans consider to be the definitive way to experience the game's soundtrack.

XSEED released this game well after they released it on the PSP. It was their first PC release -- and it shows. None of the extra features associated with the PSP version are present in this release, including the art gallery and the voice acting. Of course, that means that the rebalancing that made the game easier and more tedious in many respects are also not present, which I think is a fair trade. XSEED did manage to optimize the game for more modern PC platforms, even implementing support for higher resolutions and widescreen, so at the very least, XSEED's release is the ideal way to play the game on PC.

Many people will recommend going for Felghana first if you're just getting into the series. Admittedly, that's not the way I handled it, but if you want to get a feel for the series before diving into the rest of the games, Felghana may very well be the best place to start. While most Ys games have episodic storylines in general, Felghana's story relies the least on earlier games in the series, the gameplay from Napishtim has been refined into something that is both easy to learn and a joy to master and both the aesthetics and sound design are top-notch. It's generally available on sale for a hefty discount, but personally, I'd say that it's well worth the full $15.",1517704192,1517704192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's so much fun I'm not sure why the government even allow it to be sold.

---
看了别人的测评，似乎普遍觉得本作的难度和挑战性都挺高。
于是，我果断用了修改 ysf_win.ini 的作弊法。
我不喜欢练级，而且对这游戏类型的热情不复当年了。
---
本作是6代之后，对3代进行了3D化重启。
经典系列中的一部稳定发挥水准的作品。
按现在的眼光，它只能算是一个比小品级游戏稍稍高一截的程度。
我是在大幅度打折时买的。感觉还算值吧。
至少，我玩了30小时，而且（在低难度下）通关了。

[h1]粗略点评[/h1]

剧情……不提也罢。头尾的动画水平低下，毫无观看价值。
难度设置比较合理，而且有各种难度模式选择。
杂兵全都很菜。我不练级，经常蹦蹦跳跳不理睬它们。而它们很少能阻挡我的前进。
而与之对比的是，boss大多对玩家的挑战性陡然上升。我遇到第一个boss时，就被虐很惨……
地形和机关的设计，发挥了3D的一些特点，不过特别出彩的亮点不多。
但好在，场景丰富，而且节奏很快，所以一直有新鲜感，足以让我不停玩下去。

[h1]心得和注意事项[/h1]

动作游戏，当然应当用手柄玩。我的是XBox 360手柄。

首先，去[url=https://steamcn.com/t107903-1-1]下载汉化[/url]并按说明操作。

然后，运行设置程序。

[u][b]推荐按键设置为：[/b][/u]

[list]
	[*] 跳跃: A
	[*] 攻击: X
	[*] 魔法: R1
	[*] 爆气: L1
	[*] 上一腕轮: Y
	[*] 下一腕轮: B
	[*] 菜单: 选择键
[/list]

[u]魔法为什么用R1？[/u]

如果用B之类的主要按键，很容易就按住过久。
而魔法的施放是以[b]松开按键[/b]为准的。
尤其对于旋风魔法——用来暂时浮空——来说，这个在时机上的延后，往往会导致严重的后果。我已经吃够亏了。
R1更容易弹开。改成它后，我的失误大大减少。

[u]菜单为什么不用传统的开始键？[/u]

因为确认键就是攻击键。而我发现用右手大拇指先伸出、按开始键，再紧接着收回、按X，不顺畅。有时候，一着急，指甲还会妨碍按下开始键。
改成左手按选择键，右手就不用移动太远。

[u][b]其它[/b][/u]

游戏后期，遇到非常考验跳跃的关卡设计，这时，务必用[b]十字键[/b]来控制方向！
否则，蘑菇头摇杆绝对会坑你坑得让你想死……

按 F1 可以切换 No-Fall 模式。见游戏中右上角的红字。
开启它(on)，可以在你本该掉落到下一层场景时，变成回到本场景的入口。
但小心：这时，它会[b]自动重新变成关闭(off)[/b]，所以下一次掉落就不管了！
奇怪的规则……

至于修改 ysf_win.ini 的方法，上网搜索即可找到。略。
需要补充的是：如果反复按F2把等级升到顶，可以让主角变得近乎无敌，省得时不时按F5补血。

[h1]关卡和剧情相关[/h1]

得到一个秘药，其说明没有指出有啥用。让人犹豫。
应该立即喝了它。[spoiler]可以给你增加“冲刺”（其实就是跑得更快）的能力。[/spoiler]

一个NPC多次收购你的矿石后，最终会奖励你一个戒指。
立即出镇，存个档。
然后，[spoiler]去商店，把戒指“卖”给道具娘。你会发现巨亏，但可以得到一个哭脸的成就。[/spoiler]
然后，读档，[spoiler]留着戒指。之后你会发现它真正的主人是谁的。到时候，可以换来一个延长战斗buff持续时间的被动能力。[/spoiler]

由于我启用了作弊，所以在熔岩地带，不畏走路损血就继续前进了……
我起初还以为，这个关卡设计是为了考验玩家跳起并在空中挥剑，从而尽可能延长每一跳的距离（大概多了20%吧）。后来发现是我想多了。
正常的流程应该是：[spoiler]在一个容易掉落出去的场景（记得利用F1），可以在尽头拿到一个免疫熔岩的道具。[/spoiler]",1516727998,1516776337,True,2,0,0.49270203709602356,6,True,False,False,False,,,

What I thought of ""YS: The Oath in Felghana""
This game is one of my favorite Ys Game. The attack controls are very fluid and feel very natural. The best yet out of the Ys titles I have played I think. Normal enemies are not as tough to take down as in other Ys titles. But bosses as well as level design are top notch. The boss fights are very challenging! The game is not the longest in length of the YS Games I have played. I had a lot of fun with the level layouts. You need to grind but you don't need to over grind endlessly. No major issues I have with the game. As in many Ys Games the controls and combat may take a little to get used too.

+ Challenging boss battles: One of the trade marks of the Ys series. Especially on higher difficulties it can take a lot of time to beat a boss. On the highest difficulty even normal monsters can seriously hurt you.
+ You can directly restart the boss battle if you lose.
+ Good music (like always)
+ Good controls: The character is moving exactly the way I want it to (tip: rebind your magic key to one of your shoulder buttons, if you are playing with a controller)
+ I was not ready for that extra boss.

[B]Contras[/B]
- Some unnecassary achievements: For instance, you have to fulfill a certain mission on EVERY difficulty (six in total, but ""luckily"" you don't have to play the whole game six times). 
- If you get hurt before a boss battle you will not get fully healed even after retrying a boss battle.

- Combat feels like hitting a packets of crisps with a metal bat (unlike Kingdom Hearts, where combat feels like hitting a shallow pool with a fish). 

- You know it's an an action game when you have to rebind your keys. You ever had to rebind your keys for a JRPG? I rest my case. 

- Played [the last boss] all night, in a romantically obsessive sort of way. Then I see it getting light again outside, and it stops being romantic and starts being sad. But soon, at about 5:30am, I beat him. 

- My heart hasn't been beating that hard in... [?]

- Maybe sleep deprivation is affecting my judgement here, but it seems like that was pretty much the most incredible boss fight I have ever played. I'm comparing it to Megaman Zero and ZX, Iga Castlevania, God of War... I guess Megaman ZX comes closes, but so much of the excitement in those games is beating the boss guantlet, committing all that time before you even get to the actual last boss. Oath's last boss is self contained. You die, you start again at the beginning of the fight — and after, what, 4 hours, it was still incredible fun.

I always worry whenever a game gets switched to an isometric or 3d playstyle from a 2d side scroller but this one was perfectly executed. They captured the same challenges as the first game, the movement and combat are fluid even jumping around. I do admit that the ring system on the SNES version gave you a few more abilities you could use opposed to what we have now but I also understand their design decision because they were going for a more action packed, fast to play game style.

It all worked well. I mean I admit my first playthrough picking hard difficulty may not have been the best choice. I raged, oh boy did I rage LOL. But I won! That satisfying feeling of winning something really difficult can't be beat. That is what the developers did right with this remake. They captured that satisfying feeling of victory with fast, action packed gameplay that didn't depend on game design that punishes you for 'dying' by making you waste time backtracking. You die? Jump right back in and try again gives it that arcade feeling where you get addicted and just keep putting in those quarters until you finally win and shout YES! WOOHOO! I'M AWESOME!

I have absolutely no complaints about the gameplay at all. If you don't like your games to be difficult, this isn't the game for you. If you appreciate a challenge and feel the victory of overcoming such challenges is a sweet reward, you will love this.

As far as the story goes? Well I had to install some mod to get the voice acting from the PSP working here. I really liked the voice acting and the story overall is pretty good. It's really your stereotypical hero who conquors evil with some really nice twists. I can't call it the most riveting story ever told but it is absolutely enjoyable, at least to me.

Also the music... wow. The composer did a fantastic job with the music score in this game. It's so blood pumping and at times emotional and makes up some of the best music I've heard in the industry actually. 

The Art style? Well it's an isometric 2d style, top down camera, pixel art and level design giving the illusion of 3d but I can really appreciate this style it's colorful and creative.

Lastly, the level design. Many of it feels maze-like with some hidden secrets. They did a pretty good job capturing that old school level design we appreciated on the SNES game. But it isn't so maze-like that you can find yourself lost and going around in circles constantly.

Remake de “Ys III -  Wanderers of Ys”, cronologicamente ele se passa entre “Memories of Celceta” e “Kefin, The Lost City of Sand”, assim sendo a terceira aventura de Adol “the Red” Christin, o herói e protagonista da série.

Embora o jogo seja relativamente antigo, graficamente Oath in Felghana continua belíssimo, mesclando com sutileza gráficos 3d com 2d no design das dungeons, monstros, e demais personagens.

Ys contem uma historia bastante simples, entretanto com um roteiro muito bem escrito, o jogo possui um argumento convincente, recheado de personagens com personalidade própria - dialogar com os NPCs é uma grata surpresa. Por sua vez, a trilha sonora matem a qualidade padrão dos jogos da Falcom, simplesmente maravilhosa. 

Contudo, o grande destaque do jogo fica definitivamente com seu gameplay que é absurdamente divertido. Ágil, desafiador, e intenso, o gameplay vai melhorando cada vez mais à medida que o jogador vai progredido durante o jogo. Evidenciando o combate e velocidade, de modo que quanto mais inimigos o personagem derrotar num intervalo de tempo menor, mais o personagem se fortalece – ganhando mais força, defesa, velocidade, mana, e experiência. 

Em suma, “Ys - The Oath in Felghana” envelheceu muito bem, estando longe de ser considerado datado. O jogo vem com vários níveis de dificuldade, sendo próprio tanto para os jogadores mais casuais quanto para quem procura um grande desafio.

 Le système de combat est celui d'un beat'em all dynamique avec divers coups possibles qui varie surtout selon si on saute ou non et avec 3 magie bien différentes qu'on changera selon les ennemis.
 On a un système a la ""metroid-vania"" ou il faudra débloquer des pouvoirs pour accèder a divers endroits et revisiter d'autres endroits pour en découvrir quelques passages secrets. On a aussi quelques phases de plateformes qui restent plutot accessibles hormis a certains endroits ou on a du mal a voir la profondeur (axe z). A noter qu'il y a plusieurs choix de difficultés ce qui est appréciable dans ce genre de jeu.

Comme dans tout les Ys il y aura toujours un peu de grind a chaque nouvelle zone mais celui ci n'est pas trop contraignant , 20min par zone en général, avec la musique et le dynamisme des combats sa n'est pas du tout chiant. Il faut aussi pensez a améliorer son équipement dès que possible pour limiter les dégats et se defaire plus rapidement des ennemis.

Il n'y a pas besoin d'avoir fait les jeux précédents, chaqu'uns étant indépendant les uns des autres hormis Ys 1 et 2. Il y a parfois quelques clins d'oeil aux autres jeux mais rien d'importants. A noter que les jeux ne sont qu'en Anglais mais ne demande qu'un niveau moyen.

Points positifs :
-Des musiques toujours aussi prenantes.
-Combats dynamiques basé sur 3 magies bien différentes.
-Combats de Boss variés et demandant un peu de stratégie et pas mal de réflexes.
-Un scénario classique mais efficace avec des personange attachants.

Neutres : 
-Durée de vie un peu courte, 8h. Mais le jeu n'a quasiment aucun temps morts que sa n'est pas très grave.
-Le grind bien que léger (20-30min par zone) est quasiment nécessaire a chaque nouvelle zone sous peine de mourrir rapidement.

Points négatifs :
-La zone de la montagne un peu pénible, assez labyrinthique et avec des monstres assez chiant au début.
-Quelques phases de sauts pénibles.

The main problem is that the Ys series has silly achievements. But this game is crazy. You have to play the whole game at least six (6) times in order to get the different achievements. I mean, you must finish it both on very easy and on easy..
And you also must finish it in less than 5 hours, for another achievement.. Plus, you must beat the whole bossh rush on different difficulties..
So, if you're an achievement hunter, expect this game to take many hours from your weeks.. :) Even because some puzzles are not frustrating, they're easy, but they're very long and six times is really something unbelievable..

Ys Oath in Felghana ist ein Remake von Ys III, welches in einer mittelalterlichen Fantasywelt spielt. Der reisende Abenteurer Adol kommt in Felghana an, während sich gerade eine neue Krise in diesem kleinen Reich anbahnt. Und so muss er (fast) im Alleingang dieses Reich retten.
Fokus des Spiels sind Dungeons mit schnellen Kämpfe und harten Bosskämpfen, die nur wenige Fehler verzeihen. Aber auch Story, einfache Rätsel und Sprungpassagen bietet das Spiel. 

Was gefällt mir an dem Spiel:
- Actionreihe, gegnergefüllte Dungeons voller Action
- Optionale Schätze und versteckte Sidequests
- Actionreiche mitreisende Musik
- Jump and Run Passagen, welche zum Teil an Sidescroller anlehnt sind.
- Fordernde Bossekämpfe, welche Übung,Reaktionsschnelligkeit und Vorbereitung verlangen.
- Man muss wenig grinden, sofern man alle Gegner die man sieht niedermäht. Das Spiel lässt sich in weniger als 10 Stunden durchspielen. Muss man doch mal für einen Bosskampf kurz grinden, ist das in 10 Minuten erledigt.
- Gelungenes Magiesystem mit 3 Elementen, welche alle Ihre Verwendung finden.
- Gute Geschichte, gibt aber nicht mit Final Fantasy X oder Trails in the Sky zu vergleichen

Was gefällt mir weniger:
- Die Grafik ist etwas altbacken, Die Artworks sind zwar nicht pixelg, könnten aber eine noch höhere Auflösung vertragen.
- Die Nebencharactere bleiben eher blass, sind aber auch nicht der Fokus des Spiels.

Falls man noch nie Ys gespielt hat, sollte man auf maximal auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad Normal anfangen. Wer sich unsicher ist, kann auch Easy wählen. Wenn man Ys schon kennt, weiß man jedenfalls bereits was einen erwartet. Ein Gamepad ist empfehlenswert.

Difficulty: Compared to other jrpg's, the normal mode in this game is probably the hard mode on others. I suggest you start on easy mode, familiarize with the game then do another run on higher difficulty to do the achievements.
The only bad thing I would say about this game is the clocktower. It's so freaking hard and would test your patience but once you overcome it, it's really satisfying.
I just finished it but would do another run on a higher difficulty.

Ys: The Oath in Felghana konnte mich leider nicht so richtig überzeugen. Schuld daran ist in erster Linie der kaputte Schwierigkeitsgrad, der sich eindeutig an Hardcore-Spieler richtet. Selbst auf „Easy“ sind einige der späteren Bosse eine echte Qual und der sogenannte „Normal“-Schwierigkeitsgrad wäre in jedem anderen Ys-Spiel in die „Hard“-Kategorie gefallen.
Darüber hinaus nervt das Spiel mit ödem Schlauchleveldesign und einer arg kurzen Spieldauer. Da haben die anderen Serienableger einfach wesentlich mehr zu bieten als dieses Remake zu Ys III. Nichtsdestotrotz bietet auch dieser Ableger schnelle, actionreiche und angenehm unterhaltsame Kämpfe gegen Trash-Mobs, sowie epische Bossgegner, die zwar viele Nerven kosten, aber dafür auch ein tolles Erfolgserlebnis gewähren, sobald man sie nach einigen Grinding-Orgien doch noch bezwingt. The Oath in Felghana ist sicherlich nicht das Highlight der Serie (auch wenn das Hardcore-Spieler anders sehen werden), aber dennoch einen Blick wert, wenn man ein großer Fan der Reihe ist und eine Herausforderung nicht scheut.


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- Es ist besser als das lahme „Ys III: Wanderers from Ys“
- spielt sich gewohnt schnell und actionreich
- Handlung und Charaktere wurden im Vergleich zum Original stark verbessert
- der ätzende Weitsprung aus Ys VI wurde rausgekickt (gibt jetzt stattdessen einen Doppelsprung)

Neutral:
- gewohnte Falcom-Qualität im audiovisuellen Bereich, aber nichts wirklich besonderes

Kontra:
- stellenweise kaputter Schwierigkeitsgrad, das Spiel wirkt in erster Linie für Hardcore-Spieler konzipiert, was andere Gruppen ausschließt
- ausgiebiges Grinding ist auch im Remake Pflicht um voranzukommen
- langweilige, lineare Oberwelt und Dungeons (Schlauchleveldesign)
- das Spiel ist etwas arg kurz für sein Genre (ca. 5-10 Stunden Spielzeit)

Make sure you enjoy both types of gameplay before jumping in.

The majority of the dungeons is the hack-and-slash RPG type.  You can kite enemies, make big long chain combos, with plenty of non-stop action until everything is dead.

Then the boss fights are more like quicktime events.  While it's not exactly the same a QTE, it might as well be.  There's no more continuous action, no chaining combos.  90% of boss fights are learning the timing of the boss's attacks and jumping dodge at the right time - i.e. press X to not die right now.

The difficulty is not an issue, as the game has multiple difficulty levels from very easy to ridiculously hard.  However, the sudden change in gameplay style remains regardless of difficulty level.

As for the story and characters, I didn't get through the whole thing obviously, but it seems to be a pretty generic JRPG style of story.  Not much to say there.

Me personally, I don't like the dodge-forever and wait for the chance to land 1 hit style of gameplay, which made the boss fights annoying and boring enough that I ended up putting the game down.",1495998843,1495998901,False,14,8,0.314805716276168823,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The platforming, theming and level design are all interesting and fun. The music is awesome and memorable. Bosses, however, single-handedly put all that is good about the game to waste.

I certainly don't mind hard games, but too often it is artificial, particularly on the higher difficulty levels. To set the tone: Bosses generally kill you in 2-4 hits with spammy attacks that are very difficult to dodge, have a lot of health and provide VERY limited (and generally dangerous) vulnerability windows. Most of this is fine, though their health can get absurdly excessive at times and certain attacks have questionable hit boxes.

The problem is that some boss' attacks are decided by RNG and can become impossible (in the literal rather than exaggerating sense) to survive. If Gyalva wants to turn the arena into spikes forever and shoot you when you can't dodge, or if Istersiva wants to repeatedly spit out three laser-crystals until they fill the screen, there's genuinely no chance to win.

These are not controlled in any way; apparently the developers' idea of justifying this is the accessibility of the Retry button that appears when you die.

The need to compensate for often unavoidable damage means that, with rare exception on the highest difficulties, bosses become an aggravating marathon of perfection-demanding frustration that you would expect to see in a badly-balanced bullet hell. It is no small irony that the reliance on scripted attacks makes what is meant to be a tough final boss one of the easiest in the game.

The alternative is to spend an hour (again, not an exaggeration) before many bosses to grind a couple of levels extra, which dramatically reduces the damage you receive and makes them pitifully easy. To sum up the choices, you can beat your head against a wall or you can bore yourself to tears. Both options can only be considered anti-fun.

A far less critical issue is the controls: 3 buttons switch between and use magic, but there are only 3 different magics so they could have just got a button each. XInput support is lacking; controllers work but cannot be remapped. Xbox controllers access the menu with the right stick, while magic use (X) and jump (B) make life awkward as they are often needed together. There are also multiple complaints that jump button presses sometimes fail to register.

But this is a minor flaw compared to the boss problem, which could have been prevented. This is a Steam re-release of the original 2005 PC version. In 2010, the game received a PSP port which made a considerate reworking of bosses and provided a double-boost ability. None of that made it into the Steam release in 2012, and an otherwise great game suffers irredeemably for it.",1490739741,1491529697,False,25,4,0.471003413200378418,27,False,False,False,False,,,

And as a big fan of Ys in general, I consider this to be the best of the series.  As with the rest of the Ys series, the world is built wonderfully.  Every area in the game feels very unique and interesting.  Every character in the game also has their own name, portrait, and a bit of personal character to them, no matter how insignificant their role is.  I've always found this to be a wonderful attribute to the Ys series, and makes character interactions feel more intimate and special than what you get in many RPGs.

The gameplay is also top notch in Felghana.  Each area is laid out very well and presents a challenge to overcome.  The bosses are also incredibly well designed, and some of the best I've seen in any game.  Boss battles are fast-paced and challenging, and despite the high difficulty, everything feels completely fair.  Every single attack is avoidable through practice, skill, and reflexes, no matter how ridiculous they may seem at first, which is something I absolutely love to see in my games.  While I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty for Ys games to really get your blood pumping, there are also several easier settings for more casual players who aren't as good at fast paced action games, offering something for everyone.

Graphically, the game looks great.  Despite being pretty old (original Japanese PC release in 2005), the visual design and artstyle were done very well.  The colors, lighting, animations, models, and so on all just look fantastic, and I feel they'll hold up well forever.  Falcom just did a great job there.

The music is wonderful too.  Falcom games always have top notch music, and Felghana is no different.  They really did a good job with the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, unlike the PSP release, the Steam release doesn't have the option to change to the alternate soundtracks from the PC88 or X68000 versions of Wanderers of Ys, but this is a minor complaint that shouldn't matter much except to enthusiasts of the sound from those old machines.  The Windows soundtrack is phenominal to be sure.

Tight, fast, and fluid, it's makes for an extremely fun and satisfying game to play. The combat feels so fair, in fact, that it actually feels like it's my fault when I die. There is no dodge feature in the game, though, so you have to be careful. Additionally, as the game goes on, you will obtain 3 different abilities that you can use to assist you in battle. These abilities are: 

♦ Fireball ([i]ranged attack, possible combo extender[/i]) 
♦ Whirlwind Spin ([i]AoE attack, best DPS potential, slow recovery at the end[/i])
♦ Shield Bash ([i]okay DPS, grants invulnerability during use[/i])

Also, there is a Boost Mode that is super fucking good. Use it. A lot.

While it's not the most memorable soundtrack, it does an excellent job at hyping up the player in a fight.

Just because it CAN be difficult doesn't mean that it HAS to. It even has a Very Easy option that can beaten by just about anybody, so just about anybody can enjoy it. Oh, and there's also the difficulty that steals your shoes and calls you gay, but only real men  ̶w̶h̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶s̶e̶l̶v̶e̶s̶ play that one and stick with it.

It's a chore... It will take several hours to max out your level even when grinding in the final area on the easiest difficulty. Quite literally.

There IS a cheat code to bypass this, however, and this cheat still allows you to obtain the achievement for reaching maximum level. On the condition that you beat the Boss Rush on the hardest difficulty, you can press F2 and you instantly go up a level in the Story Mode free of charge.

...it's more trouble than it's worth, though.

If a boss is beating the ever-living crap out of you, your level may only be a part of the issue. Usually, it means that whatever you have equipped is currently garbage. Simply getting your hands on a slightly better sword can mean the difference of you hardly dealing any damage to suddenly dealing a good amount of damage. You can buy better equipment, but the game eventually reaches a point where you'll have to search dungeons for better equipment. If you can't find said equipment, then tough shit, you're gonna struggle even more.

The bosses in this game are super fun to go up against, yet at the same time they are absolute bullshit. The aspect of a 1-on-1 fight to the death is exilerating in any game, yet Ys does some things to add unto the stress. In addition to the inability to pause the game mid-fight, you [b]ᴄᴀɴ ɴᴏᴛ[/b] heal yourself. Whatever damage that you suffer from is there until the fight ends. 

There is also a huge difference in how the battles play out on different difficulties, and I don't simply mean the difference in damage dealt/recieved. Some bosses, as a result, are either harder to hit, have extra attacks, and/or their super-mega-ultra-buttfuck move is faster AND deals more damage. 

In short, be cautious, think of a strategy, and most of all, be patient. You have no idea how many times i have died just blindly rushing in for an attack.

In terms of the time you'll need to spend and the skill that is required, they're hard as fuck to earn. However, it felt really really good once I finally got them all.

It is a great game and one of the best in the Ys Series. I hope that The PSP and Vita installments will eventually come to Steam as well. This game is one of the most fun I've had with games in a long time. I have fully played this game all the way to the end and repeated playthroughs beating Nightmare mode. This of course is on the PSP version as I have played it to death. It is a fun experience that everyone should try. This is an action RPG that will remind many people of Zelda except with a heavier emphasize on combat. This game excels in the combat. It will appear basic at first but as you progress, you get more moves, magic and other abilities that will effect the way you play and approach fighting certain enemies. Bosses all test your ability to the fullest in memorizing patterns, utilizing your new magic, and waiting for the opportune moment to strike. The music like anything JDK Falcom composes is beyond words. Often times this soundtrack is regarded as the best in the series while I personally feel like Chronicles is the best for me. As for the story, the game is pretty basic with its plot however, it has a lot of world building for both the previous and newer installments. These are nods to those that have played the other games of the series and nothing major is revealed with these events. It is a self contained story like most of the series except Ys I+II Chronicles, so you don't need to play the previous games to understand the story. A few tips for those that will be playing this game for the first time. Note that this game is a lot harder than most entries in the series. Normal mode will be more difficult than you are used to. Do not be discouraged. As I had played other games in the series I thought that I would start in Hard Mode and got my ass kicked. You can beat it through trial and error and grinding until you can beat the boss, Other than that, I highly reccomend the game for its fast pace, fun combat and soundtrack. 10/10",1486871209,1486871209,True,1,0,0.503246784210205078,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So you can tell there are some refinements.

First, instead of 3 different swords, you get the traditional weapon system from Ys 1 and 2, and the elemental attacks are replaced with three different magic rings. Fire Magic works pretty much the same as Ys 2, while the added Earth Magic and Wind Magic add another layer to your combat. Ys 6 lacked distance attacks and good way to mob enemies, while this provides just that. Earth Magic can be used to charge towards or away from enemies, which also provides another layer to combat. Overall, unlike Ys 6 where Brillante was pretty much the only sword you ever used, here, you find yourself using the three magics more or less balanced. There are also a lot of enemies that behave differently, especially the jumpers who make it harder to spam down stab like you always did in Ys 6, and some enemies requiring a specific magic to get through them easily, so the combat is overall an improvement, probably more than it initialy seems. The bosses are pretty fun too, though Ys 6 had good ones as well. As far as the final boss goes, this one trumps Ys 6's big time. Main combo being 6 hits instead of 3 also helps.

The dungeon design is, because Ys 3 was originally a sidescroller, flat, but in a good way. This makes the design a lot more comprehensible, and added with MUCH better platforming mechanic (no dash jumps, but also very forgiving gliding technic), it makes the dungeon design just much better. Of course, it's no Zelda, but then again, Zelda is built around dungen puzzles, while this game is about hacking away at your enemies, so it's not a fair comparison.

The problem is then the scale. There is only one village, and 32 NPCs. There are 6 dungeons, which I think is actually the same number as Ys 6, but it's overworld (if you can call it that) is pitifully small. As in, smaller than Ys 1. So if you are expecting Ys 2-esque, legit RPG with lots of characters to interact with, you are not going to get it here.

First of all, this game has a phenomenal, captivating and rocking Soundtrack, which energizes you to plow through the game's enemies. In general, the Ys games which I played all had pretty good soundtracks.

但是我作为刷了15多个小时的成就党，必须要给这个游戏一个差评，这款游戏成就设计的非常反人类。

1、游戏要全成就需要通关Inforno难度，但是Inforno难度，一开始新游戏无法选择，只会在任意难度通关后才会出现，这就意味着全成就需要至少通关两遍；
2、游戏有两个护送任务，需要到游戏中期才能完成，但是成就的要求是6个难度都要做，WTF！不算1中你需要通关的两遍，你还需要重新开启新游戏4遍，把这4个难度都打到游戏中期，完成护送任务才能够完成！！！

成就的设计，我觉得最好是让大家挑战更高难度、发现隐藏要素，而这个成就设计出来就是为了恶心玩家，真的值得商榷。

Combat is fluid and challenging, boss fights tough and engaging, story is adequate, and NPCs have personality and react to plot developments. If you've played Ys 1 and 2 and enjoyed them as I did, know that this third entry in the series is actually better in every way. Newcomers can feel free to start here because it's a standalone adventure.

The hero, Adol, is a swordsman who lives for the thrill of exploring new lands. In each game, he arrives at a new place, meets lots of people, earns their admiration for solving their problems and saving their lives, gets a girl to fall in love with him, and then leaves it all behind at the end to travel somewhere else. In terms of gameplay, Felghana has you platforming and hacking and slashing your way through varied environments (dungeons) filled with monsters, while trying to find treasure chests on your way to the next save point, after which there is a boss fight. It follows this formula all throughout -- simple and it works. You also have to keep an eye out for a few secret passages and a couple side quests if you want to get all the unique items in this game, some of which are incredibly useful in avoiding headaches later on. The soundtrack, as always in this series, is very good.

The main draw here is definitely the hectic combat, and the satisfying difficulty of the bosses is the height of what the game has to offer. The dungeon chests add an enjoyable exploration element, the story does a good job giving meaning to what you're doing, and the personable and reactive NPCs make you care about what's happening. Overall, Felghana is a very well put together package and a polished experience. Easy recommendation for anyone who likes what they see in the gameplay videos.

I'd say this game is more action than RPG. It has elements of SHMUPs. It even has some light platforming elements.

Pros:
+ Very responsive controls and movement. There's no sense of sluggishness when you move, jump, and attack.
+ Fast paced action, favoring execution, reaction, and enemy pattern recognition over grinding and slower-paced strategic / tactical decisions. More like a SHMUP than a strategic action RPG.
+ aforementioned reaction-based elements are actually possible (at least for me in my late-20s). I've played games that have patterns that require unfeasible reaction speeds. So the patterns end up being, effectively, random amounts of damage because there's no reasonable way to avoid them (like the last boss in YS 1).
+ The way you get good at fighting the enemies and bosses in this game is by learning their patterns. As far as I can tell, there are very few situations where your ability to win or lose is based on randomness. There are some games where there's really difficult patterns or challenges that are so difficult that you won't be able to reasonably overcome them without spending a lot of time practicing. Take some of the bosses in the souls series - the process of learning each boss's moves can take quite awhile because they have a varied moveset, and there's often complications like cluttered level design and certain patterns that can't consistently be parried or dodged or predicted. That sort of stuff really frustrates me, especially when it takes awhile to get back to the boss. This game doesn't really have anything like that. You can pretty much learn the correct thing to do in any given situation in a reasonable amount of time, and it's very consistent. And, when you fail a boss, you can restart right at it without having to make your way back from a save point. To sum it up, I think that you can feasibly learn to fight every boss without taking any damage.
+ Difficulty options! Easy mode felt fun and not all that challenging for me. If you really want to play more you can replay on harder difficulty modes.
+ awesome music. Energetic, electric guitar, drums, + symphonic instruments. I believe the tracks use actual recordings and not samples.
+ World building. As you return to town during your adventures, the characters in town always have different things to say. It's nice when games don't have voice acting because it lets writers write a lot more stuff, and they've definitely taken advantage of that fact here.

Things I didn't like:
- towards the end, it seems there's a bit of an expectation that you grind to get more money and EXP so you can upgrade your gear, increase your max HP, and increase your stats. If you think that's okay, ask yourself if running back and forth between the same rooms doing the same repetitive task just to make some numbers go up is a really meaningful way to spend your life. Ask yourself if you'd go to bed feeling good about how you spent your day, having spent hours of it doing the same stupid task over and over again.
- overall, the grinding for EXP, money, and upgrade mats I think needlessly lengthens the game and gets in the way of the action-oriented gameplay. I hardly had to spend much time grinding, but I wonder what including stats and levels and stuff really achieves, from the perspective of just making the game fun. I think it hurts the fun.
- Partial controller support. You cannot map the menu button to a button on your controller. You have to have your keyboard there in front of you or you have to use an external tool to map your start button to ESC.

In short, there's not much I didn't like about this game. It's a nice, fast-paced action game with some JRPG elements. Although, I can't help but wonder what a game like this has to offer over actual ""action-first"" action games like Bayonetta, DMC, SHMUPs, etc...I feel like the thing that makes this game unique is its inclusion of JRPG elements, but I also feel like the game may have been more fun if it had just focused all on the action. The primary gameplay of this game is action-oriented, but if that's what you really want out of a game you have much better options elsewhere. The action in this game isn't as great as the action in other highly-polished action games. So why not just play those instead?

So, if you have no shortage of top-tier action games that you still enjoy (like Platinum games that you haven't yet 100%'d), I don't know that this game is worth getting.

It was the first in the series to swap from the top-down bump system to a 2D platformer. It was also outsourced to many, many different devs and systems. The series later swapped back to their original system for Ys IV (And presumably V) and then started using a 3D platformer engine for VI and beyond.

Yet this is my favorite in the series.
Oath in Felghana is a 1st-party remake of the original. With remixed music, completely redone areas, and superior gameplay. I would honestly list this among my top 5 RPGs of all time.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Ys TOiF is an Action RPG/Hack&Slash 3D platformer. You have four main abilities. Obviously: Attack combo, Jump, and Magic. But you also have a boost, which charges over time, gives you a quicker, stronger combo, and halves all damage taken. (In the PSP version you get a second boost which also gives HP Regen.) There are plenty of moves, like plunging attacks, rising blades, and such. The gameplay is generally very fast-paced. Grinding is made easier with a combo system that awards an XP multiplier based on how long you can keep a combo going.
This game is VERY hard. You shouldn't have too much trouble beating it on normal, but I'm currently in the midst of an Inferno mode playthrough. Dodging attacks is very necessary, though you get an ability later that negates all damage and serves as a guard.
One of the game's strong points is it's boss fights. All challenging, tense, and require a dedication of learning patterns and when to attack (Especially in higher difficulties). You really feel accomplished when you beat them.

[b]MUSIC[/b]
Oooohhhmygodthisgamehasamazingmusic.
Falcom loves putting metal remixes of the original songs in their games. I'm serious when I say that literally every song on this soundtrack is amazing. Please just give it a listen even if you don't want to play the game. It always fits with the area perfectly.

[b]STORY[/b]
This game picks up a few years after Ys II leaves off. Monsters are still rapant even though demons and magic have been eradicated. And a small trading town is hurt severely by the rule of a tyrant noble. It's a pretty decent story, and the intended emotions towards all of the characters get carried over very well.

Overall, I love this game. It's one of my favorites of all time, and likely the best in the series.

But this can be pretty easily overlooked with how fun the hack-and slash combat is. The music is some of Falcom's best, so try to play with headphones. Also, this game can be kinda tough, especially on the harder difficulties. The bosses will prove that pretty quickly, since it's likely you'll die the first time or two trying to figure out patterns and weaknesses. But after that it'll either be a cakewalk or a satisfying triumph.

There is plenty of new content that wasn't in the original, and all of it improves upon the old foundation.

If I had to suggest improvements, I'd ask that the easy mode was a little bit less easy (maybe 2/3rds damage instead of half damage from enemies. There is an included ""Very Easy"" mode after all.) Normal mode required a bit more dying, grinding, or perfect pattern memorization than I'd prefer, and bosses often had a few moves that seemed to be unavoidable.

Most of the game's story progress is based on in game events, so you may find yourself wandering around and then having to back track in order to actually get anywhere.

Все очень мило сделано, большие боссы к которым нужна тактика, оружия, магия, респ мобов - чтоб гриндить, всякие любовно обставленные домики нпс, типичные герои пафосные и правильные - как и подобает.

из минусов: 
-болтология - бич всех рпг, каждый прохожий готов пиз-деть по 2 часа (отсутсвие журнала квестов - заставляет во время промотки болтовни вглядываться во всякие названия ,чтобы понять ,что делать дальше, а не бегать везде напрасно)

The plot is simple and I like that. It doesn't take itself seriously. What this game does take seriously is the gameplay. The combat is fun. You can avoid enemies. No random encounters. No crap loot either. Everything has a purpose. You don't need to waste your time doing inventory management. No useless items. No useless spells. It is a finely balanced game. 

After playing this game, I wonder, why the hell are all other games not like this.

Where other games randomly generate crap loot for you to search through. This game has a very very limited inventory, all useful during the time they are available to you. You don't need to manage inventory, wondering if you need to drop X to make room for Y. 

Where other games randomly generate dungeons for you. This game gives you hand crafted dungeons that require some good platforming to get hidden treasure.

Where other games throw a million abilities and spells at you; half of which are useless against the majority of enemies, this game gives you 4 abilities. All of them useful.

This game is a masterpiece. You cannot take away anything from it without totally ruining. And if you were to add anything you would probably just ruin the precise balance of it.

I played Ys: The Ark of Naphitism years ago on PSP but i never finished it and i actually  don't remember anythign about it so playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana was like playing Ys games for the first time.

when i bought the game i didn't know what to expect i usually drop single players games when i play on pc after a couple of hours because i'm lazy and i prefer play online

However for this game was an other story, i Loved every single moment of it, the gameplay is fun the artworks are great and the music is Amazing, some parts of the story were predictable but towards the end there's some surprises

The gameplay is pretty simple you can walk, run, jump freely in the world and there's no random encounter, the enemies wander around the map/dungeouns and you hit him with your sword or magic, that's it, for some people it may feel like a 2d Dark Souls because most of the enemies are tough if you do not have the right equipment and of course if your Lv is low, some of them requires to learn a specific pattern or you'll get countered easily.
For last you should never get surrounded by enemies because there's no invincibiliy or recovery time after you get hit (unless you get Knocked down) again, it reminded me the previous mentioned dark souls just a bit

The Boss fights are tough too and some of them are hard even if you memorized the boss patters because there's so much stuff going when fighting, some felt impossible at first but after levelling 2-3 more levels you'll notice that it'll get WAY more easier than it used to be at lower level

i kept gong back to this game everytime i would until i beated it, it was a fun experience and super addicting to me plus that Sountrack is so good that you'll keep revisiting previous zones just for listen to them

Overall the game was amazing and i think everyoen should give it a chance, and  if you do not like it there's always a refund option.

Adol da eore qual'è non si lascerà scappare l'occasione per aiutare la gente di Felghana e scoprire i segreti di questa nuova terra. Nihon Falcom decise di reinventare totalmente questo titolo ed evolvere tutto ciò che già funzionava nel gameplay di Ys VI. Abbiamo armi ed armature che possono essere temprate per maggiore efficacia, abbiamo anelli magici che potremo potenziare con le giuste gemme e una boost mode che aumenta la nostra velocità, difesa e attacco per breve tempo. Una cosa in cui scarseggia questo titolo è la selezione di accessori, molto pochi e necessari semplicemente per attraversare determinate zone più facilmente. Il gioco è un action RPG isometrico molto frenetico, con elementi di platforming e un personaggio molto abile e versatile nel combattimento. Di tutti i capitoli che ho giocato finora questo è sicuramente il più equilibrato dal punto di vista della difficoltà. Anche a livello normale questo gioco sa essere brutale, specialmente i boss vi metteranno alla prova duramente, analizzare i pattern è la chiave per vincere, sfruttando tutti i tuoi attacchi e le tue magie per evitare danni il più possibile, in quanto non è possibile curarsi durante le boss fight. Come sempre il grinding può aiutare, ma in questo gioco la curva di sviluppo è molto controllata, costringendovi a tentare il tutto e per tutto contro un boss al livello consigliato piuttosto che spendere ore e ore per salire di livello. Non è grave perchè anche il più piccolo numero in questo gioco può fare la differenza: un livello, una magia più potente, un armatura o un arma con un po di tempra in più e la battaglia può cambiare radicalmente. Ad lenire la frustrazione ci pensa soprattutto la meravigliosa soundtrack, molto trascinante e memorabile, un inno che vi rimarrà impresso per tutta la vostra avventura.

Ys takes nearly all the extraneous elements of RPGs and tosses them all out in favour of a super streamlined action battle system with some of the greatest bosses gaming has ever seen. I'm not exagerating here, Ys really does have some of gaming's greatest bosses. 

There were 3 ys games to use this style of engine. The ark of Napishtim (which was the first), The oath in Felghana and finally Origins.

Felghana has the greatest soundtrack of them all and arguably the second strongest soundtrack in the entire series (In a series famous for it's soundtracks (look for a psp or psvita for Ys 7 if you want the best soundtrack)).

Felghana, on it's hardest difficulty has some spectacular bosses. However the game doesn't put it's best foot forward at the start. Initial bosses are pretty simple and hardly inspiring, which is unfortunate because the later bosses are absolutely spectacular. Thematically unique bosses all with their own interesting quirks and unique mechanics make each big baddy feel wholly unique and incredibly satisfying to down.
In fact Felghana and Origins are spectacular examples of good boss design (with a few very obnoxious exceptions).

There's also a bit of exploration and secret discovering involved in Ys, and because a number of your abilities give both combat and traversal options there is some fun platforming to be performed in the game.

So this all sounds super positive, are there any negatives then? Actually yeah, quite a few.

This game isn't pretty, I mean let's be fair it's old (2005) but that's gonna be a turn off for some people.

Then there's the plot, Ys' localization is about as good as it can get (Xseed is really good at that) but this isn't a plot that's likely to do anything for you, and not much time is spent on either it or its characters.

The game is also very grind heavy, especially on it's higher difficulties. Levels and weapon upgrades in Ys make a huge difference, to the point where a single level can make your attacks do almost twice the damage and can turn some boss fights from cruel jokes into fun encounters. but there are humungous experience penalties once you start over levelling, and even then you're going to have to farm normal mooks just to avoid being underlevelled, which may have been alright except for the game's final weakness, fights that aren't bosses.

Ys's combat is simple, but the way it blends with each bosses unique mechanics make it incredibly satisfying. This doesn't occur with normal enemies though, which means for many, normal combat in Ys isn't very satisfying, which is unfortunate because you'll need to do a fair amount of farming basic enemies to be able to afford upgrades and avoid
being underleveled.

So to sum up:
+ Awesome soundtrack
+ Awesome bosses after the first couple of dungeons

- Not very pretty
- Grindy on higher diffculties
- Fighting basic enemies isn't that fun
- Playing on easier difficulties wont let you appreciate it's great bosses properly

Ys will appeal extremely strongly to a certain crowd, and that crowd absolutely SHOULD play it, because it's one of the best examples of it's genre.

As for this particular Ys game...one word: Brutal.

I've played Origin, I & II, and VI on Steam and this one still annihilates me...on NORMAL. What separates most of the difficulties is simply damage caused by enemies and enemy health, and the enemy patterns can be difficult to make out after your first 10 or so attempts at a particular boss. Just a fair warning -- you need to be in the zone while playing to stand a chance...or you just need to be better than this reviewer.

Aside from that, it's a loose remake of Ys III, the one ""platformer"" of the series and as such, this one has a lot of platforming elements. Thanks to the fixed camera, though, the 3d platforming is pretty simple and straightforward.

         [*]Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.)

     [*]Note 2: I will be comparing this to Origin's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion. 
[/list][/h1]

     This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint [b] not [/b] a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order. 

     For those of you that didn't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were ""tweaked"" or ""improved,"" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series. 

     Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it). 

     In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine. 

     The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't [i] need [/i] it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out. 

     Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life. 

     On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly ""harder""). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin. 

     Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one. 

     This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks. 

     To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment. 

     Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.",1439924609,1454248753,True,1,0,0.504445195198059082,3,True,False,False,False,,,

[*]Discover different magics and abilities and hidden upgrades for them
[*]INSANE BOSS FIGHTS push your skills to the limit
[*]Excellent pacing with great level design, i.e. early enemies teaching you fundamentals you will need against later     enemies and later enemies teaching you fundamentals you will use against bosses/minibosses 
[*]Surprisingly similar to Dark Souls in terms of rewarding the player for exploration/reading all of the dialogue as well as very difficult but extremely satisfying to beat bosses
[*]Said to be the most difficult entry in the Ys series but by no means unfair; people saying that this game is too hard or ""extremely hard even on normal"" are not representative of the majority. It's definitely hard but it's even more rewarding/satisfying when you overcome the challenges. 
[*]EXCELLENT soundtrack featuring rocking songs with electric guitar that pump you up as well as emotional orchestral/violin pieces to mellow down
[*]6 difficulty levels to completely drive you crazy

I would recommend this to any Ys fans but personally I was kind of underwhelmed. I'm not even sure what it was that underwhelmed me but I liked Ys Origins a lot more. Maybe it's because it feels like you only need to beat it once and then move on to another game. Save the other Ys games for after you've beaten this one for a more rewarding experience.

[Difficulty - good]: As with the other Ys games, you have difficulties for everyone to be able to enjoy the game although there are at least 2 bosses that are annoying no matter what you choose.

[Story - average]: Pretty standard stuff but I liked the little touches here and there to make the story more than just a standard issue ""Evil being awakens and you happen to be nearby to slay/seal it for the villagers"" story. I don't know if Ys Ark of Nepishtim would explain why Adol and Dogi are traveling together but not being able to own and play it may explain why I feel so disconnected from Felghana.

[Characters - good]: As with all the other Falcom games Steam has, the attention to details about every character's personality and lives is always a pleasure to read about. The merchant trying to get fame and fortune, the hardworking townspeople and a surprisingly kind countess are just a few to name in adding layers to the otherwise cookie-cutter plot.

[Graphics - average]: It's a matter of personal tastes on this one. The characters look great to me since I prefer the 2D anime style over full 3D characters. The cinematics are as lovely as I've come to expect from any Falcom game as well.

[Music - excellent]: One thing this game has no problems with is the music, my favorites would definitely be the world map and clock tower music. Not to say the rest wasn't memorable though.

[Combat - good]: It uses the same combat and magic system as Origins which makes playing one then the other very easy to transition into.

[Length - average]: It may be a good length for people who prefer short games but as for someone with tons of spare time and expectations of RPGs to have decent length and content in them...it was disappointing how quickly I chewed through it. That disappointment also leads to my rating for...

[Replayability - bad]: Unfortunately there is almost no reason to replay this game except to get Steam achievements. The version we Steam players got is lacking all the extras the PSP version players get for beating the game and time attack mode.",1436054880,1436056101,False,30,0,0.53761523962020874,2,True,False,False,False,,,

There are lots of pretty visuals, excellent music, and the game play can be tailored in difficulty for the meek or the seasoned. It's got a good storyline, a lot of content, and great graphics.

Now, for those of us who DID play the PSP or Vita download versions of this game: they cut out a lot of content.

The game is fun! But it takes too long to get started. There's somewhere around 10-15 minutes from pressing New Game to being let out into the world. Around 4-6 hours into the game, you can get an item that lets you regenerate health if you stand still. This is a needed mechanic, since you're going to have to beat up on a lot of enemies to level up for the boss fights, but standing still is not fun. The game has a 'Boost mode', in which you deal extra damage and take less damage for a limited time, after you fill up a gauge that fills up as you take and deal damage. Why not tie the regenerating health to damage done in boost mode? That would set up a dillema for the player: Do I keep fighting since boost mode is almost full, or do I not take the risk and teleport back to town to heal? Instead, if I find myself in danger after clearing a room, I just stand still for 30 seconds. Somewhere in Falcom, a ball lays on the ground, dropped.

JRPGs get a lot of flack for grinding, and there's plenty here to go around. It's really not that bad, since only monsters that pose a threat give good experience and gold. I died several times while grinding, since I thought I could go just a little more before having to heal. It's a lot more tense and exciting than beating up Rattata outside Pewter City's gym. The story is cliched and filled to the brim with classic JRPG tropes, which I can sort of forgive for a game released in 2005, but I wouldn't hate the Ys series if it took a less serious tone in it's story department, maybe something like Half Minute Hero.

An amazing game that has some core issues that prevent it from realizing its full potential:

1. The levelup system is a waste of time. When played on the default difficulty (which is what I encourage, otherwise the game is so easy its boring or so difficult it's unrewarding), you gain XP from monsters until you're on par with their level, at which point killing them becomes completely pointless. This means that you have to grind each zone just to make your character be able to survive that stage, because of this I feel pacing would've been better if you could just play from start to finish with *no* leveling system because in its current state, it does nothing but pad out game length.

2. The backtracking is annoying. I enjoy the Metroid aspect when it's done well, but in this case, most of the things you backtrack for aren't even optional unlockables for boosts, they're story-related items that you need to find in order to progress. It just feels like another way to pad game length, by making you redo areas you've already seen in order to get to the next one.

3. Bosses battles are really well designed, but insanely punishing. Whether this is an issue or not is really up to taste. You don't get to use any recovery items, when you're on-par with the level of the boss (which is only whatever's possible on the default difficulty, since ""grinding"" only gets you to ""par""), it only takes a few hits to die. Some boss fights can go on for upwards of 5 minutes, even if you know what you're doing, and if you get hit a few times, you die, and have to start the fight from the beginning. Some of the fights are really interesting from start-to-finish, others start repeating mechanics really quickly, which makes them get boring very fast, as they become battles of tedious endurance as opposed to interesting battles.

4. There's almost too much dialogue in a game that seems to be focused on being an ARPG, and really, I didn't find myself liking any of the characters.

However, the soundtrack is absolutely stellar, is is most of the stage design. It's really just some of the old-school mechanics being too old-school for their own good, but considering this is a remake of a game that came out in the 80s (Ys 3 - 1989), that kind of explains itself, and as far as remakes go, this is one of the best that's ever been done (not as good as Resident Evil 1 on the Gamecube, however) - it took the game from 2D to pseudo-3D with much better boss encounters and stage design.

It still plays like an old PC game though, and I wouldn't recommend checking this out unless you have the time on your hands to dig through some RPG history. If nothing else, you should check out the soundtrack. This has some of the best tracks you'll find in any RPG.",1423806605,1511027919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Great hack and slash game with tight controls and high replayability. You're definitely going to play this more than once.

Be advised though, this game is HARD. As in, don't start it on the hardest difficulty if this is your first time playing as this game is actually an old game from back when ""hard mode"" actually meant HARD MODE and not just a slightly harder normal mode where you still pretty much streamroll through the game. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, this game is HARD and you're going to die over and over and over until you finally learn to get good at it.

For people who hate JRPGS and whatnot don't worry, this game (Much like most of the Ys games) is anti-grind so you'll never be underleveled. You also don't have to fiddle around with a bloated inventory or anything like that as your character's progression is pretty straightforward (You don't get different type of swords with different properties, just better swords with more attack power so you can just ignore your old gear).

The soundtrack is easily one of the highlights of this game. It's probably one of the, if not THE game with the best soundtrack in the entire Ys series along with Ys VIII and a pretty close contender for game with the best soundtrack ever.

Getting 100% completion is something only the most hardcore players will be able to achieve due to how insanely hard the last difficulties are, so be ready to invest a huge amount of time on that task dying over and over.

Special note: Don't pay attention to the store images, the game actually has full widescreen support which was added shortly after the game came out so it won't look as bad as in those screenshots, don't worry.


Bad stuff:

* Cutscenes. You can't fully skip them, you have to hold a button to autoskip every bit of dialogue and waste tons of minutes doing nothing. This is especially aggravating when you're on your 3rd playthrough or so but at least you can just hold a button to skip everything unlike how we had to mash the button to skip everything individually like back when it originally came out.

* Xbox 360 controller support: Game has no native xinput support so your left and right triggers wont work by default. Use Steam's Big Picture Mode to easily fix that by binding the triggers to whatever key you need (Like swapping magic rings).",1419794186,1539049423,True,7,0,0.441185295581817627,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is the third game in the Ys series, and a remake of the original Ys III. While the original Ys III was a good game in its own right, it was also a flawed game in many ways (don't take that to mean it wasn't a heck of a lot of fun). Oath in Felghana not only rectifies every flaw of the original, it also improves upon Ys III in every way, all while remaining faithful to the core essence of what made Ys III such a fun and memorable game.

Pros:
- Phenomenal soundtrack
- Great battle mechanics
- Unique boss fights
- One of the best Ys stories

Cons:
- The beginning feels a bit slow
- (No Volcano)
- No easy way to access bonus bosses (even if you beat them)

A distinguishing feature of all Ys games is outstanding music, and this is true even for the original Ys III. In Oath in Felghana, the music has been upgraded to entirely new levels of awesome. If the soundtrack was the only good thing about this game, I'd still recommend it at full price. Fortunately for us, the music comes with an awesome game as well.

As a bonus, the PC Version of Felghana has been augmented to include the soundtracks of the original versions of Ys III, originally a PSP Exclusive feature.

Another PSP Exclusive that was added to the PC Version is the Voice Acting. For anyone that doesn't like the Voice Acting, or just wants the original PC Experience, the Voice Acting can be turned off via the Configuration Tool. Adding the Voice Acting and making it toggleable at that... There was no incentive or need to do this, but they did it anyways, and it is much appreciated.

In regards to the Voice Acting itself, there are some odd choices here. In particular, I don't think the Final Boss were handled particularly well. In particular, the voice acting gave the final boss was given more human qualities, things that are understandable and relatable. The most powerful fear is fear of the unknown, and when the Final Boss exhibited almost nothing human, it was far more unknown and unpredictable, far more terrifying.

With that said, there is plenty to like in the Voice Acting. Though not outstanding, there is a certain charm that I can't help but enjoy.

The gameplay mechanics of Felghana are some of the best, with controls that are tight and very refined. There are difficulty settings for every kind of player, be they casual or hardcore. Regardless of setting, the game is very encouraging of exploration, but for any difficulty above easy, it's loaded with intense action. Even some strategy comes into play concerning certain enemies and scenarios. Boss fights are varied and unique, and each boss requires a different method in order to defeat them. At higher difficulty levels, boss fights can be very challenging. While there is a random luck factor, for the most part, beating the bosses is a little bit of know-how accompanied by pure mad-skills (and it's very satisfying once you beat them).

Oath in Felghana is a bit of an oddball in regards to story. Most Ys games begin with Adol washed ashore after some great struggle. Here, Adol leisurely sails into Felghana with his long-time friend Dogi. Most Ys games feel epic and grand from the get-go. Oath in Felghana feels like a sidestory you could skip over (you’ll regret it if you do though).

The story has a pace that is uniquely its own, and VERY different from any other Ys game (that I’ve played at least). It ends on a powerful note, but it takes its time getting there (despite being a surprisingly short game). Even though it feels slow, there is always a driving energy that pushes the story forward; you can always feel the hidden danger, even if you don’t fully understand it. And when the story finally hits the turning point, everything comes together perfectly, leading to one of the most powerful moments in any Ys game.

Ys stories have depth, but they go by so fast that you may miss some of the more thought provoking themes and ideas being explored. Oath in Felghana, in particular, is an exploration of human weakness. The theme is explored through several characters, all of them strong individuals. And all of them having fallen to human weakness. That said, it is not just the strengths or failures of these characters that make them, in particular, so interesting.

Like the game itself, the story doesn’t give any answers; it shows you what you need to know, and leaves the rest to you.

While the slow pace of the game is one of its good points (it matches perfectly with Dogi returning home to family), it has the consequence of making the beginning feel too slow. This is because the beginning isn't interactive enough to offset the slow pace. More interaction means more immersion; experiencing rather than watching.

If you've had the opportunity to play the original Ys III, then you might remember the Volcano in the background of the Illburns Ruins. And it was AWESOME! I know this isn't really a 'negative' per say, and the Felghana version of the Illburns Ruins is clearly amazing without it. But... this should have made it into Felghana because it was just that cool.

While more of an annoyance than anything, there is no easy way to access the bonus bosses, even if you've beaten them before. It would be nice to have a means by which to easily access the two bosses once you've unlocked them. What makes this more annoying is that the bosses are quite fun and challenging, and not deserving of such obscurity.

Oath in Felghana is available for both the PC and the PSP (and eventually for Switch). The PC version is, decidedly, visually superior to the PSP version. However, the PSP version has some exclusive content that should not be overlooked.

PSP Exclusives:
- PSP Version is More Forgiving: Double Boost (regenerates health after boost), Room Retry (retry in the room you died in), Retry Boss at a Lower Difficulty.
- Inferno Time Attack
- Easier Access to Bonus Bosses.
- Museum: This is a collection of unlockable art for the game.
- Prologue Novella: As it turns out, the manuals for the Ys games included a Prologue to the main story. I think the Ys prologues should be included with their respective games, even if it’s as a PDF in the game folder, since they are a part of Ys lore.

While the PSP version decidedly has some nice exclusives, I don’t believe it has anything that makes it ‘superior’ to the PC edition. Both is an excellent choice.

Oath in Felghana is a phenomenal game. It is so polished and well executed that it is easily one of the best Action RPGs on Steam.",1418878521,1700703510,True,22,0,0.699065804481506348,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Many people like to say that the Resident Evil Remake is the best video game remake of all time. I disagree. While that game is amazing in its own right, the original Resident Evil was already a good game to begin with. Oath in Felghana, however, took an irredeemable pile of dogpoop and turned it into a masterpiece. 

Back when I first played this in late 2006 I generally had reservations about it, since my experience with the original Wanderers from Ys was not a very good one (read I threw both cartridges I owned out the window, I'm dead serious), however after finishing it I was so satisfied with it that it instantly became my second favorite Ys game of all time and it still is (I & II will always hold top place in my heart for as long as I live).

It is generally agreed among the fans that Ys: The Oath in Felghana is, in terms of quality, the best game in the entire saga and for very good reasons (Originbabbies need not apply here, your game is good but it has far too many flaws to be called best of anything. I'll talk about it some other time and incur your wrath then). 

Now let me tell you why you really should play this game even if you aren't an Ys fan.

[h1] STORY [/h1] 

Around a year after the events of Memories of Celceta legendary adventurer Adol Christin and his longtime companion Dogi the Wall-Crusher are traveling around mainland Europe when they hear rumors that Dogi's homeland, Felghana (located somewhere around real world northern Germany) has fallen on hard times. After a young fortune teller from a passing gypsy caravan confirms their suspicions, they both decide to head to Felghana and investigate. Arriving by boat they soon discover that the land is overrun by monsters and so begins their next adventure...

Compared to the legendary Ys I & II, which had an amazing story, the original Ys III (which wasn't even developed as an Ys game to begin with, but that's another topic) barely had a coherent story to it. Like, it had something similar to a story, but it was all very flat and underdeveloped in comparison to its predecessors. The localised versions we got here didn't help either, all of them, to put it simple, were terribad, which was a huge step down after the extremely high quality PC-Engine localization of Ys I & II.

Oath in Felghana, thankfully, fixed all that. The story has been vastly expanded from barely being there, to a very enjoyable one, even if it won't break any grounds in video game writing. The amazing world-building autism that was born with Ys ETERNAL is once again present although not to such extremes as the above-mentioned game. In typical Falcom fashion every single NPC in the game gets new lines of dialogue as the story progresses, so if you want that extra bit of immersion while playing you should take the time to go back speak to everyone every now and then.

[h1] muh grafix [/h1] 

Felghana uses the same engine as Ys VI, so from a technical side it doesn't really look much different from it. The sprites and models are of higher quality this time around, but the game won't break any graphical records. Fancy graphics has never been Falcom's goal and I'm thankful for that. XSEED added native widescreen support with the Steam release, but be advised the game was never designed for widescreen monitors, so there will be some small oddities if you do decide to play in widescreen. I originally played it in 640x480 on a virus-ridden Windows XP piece of scrap, so 4:3 doesn't bother me.

Performance-wise the game will run perfectly even on a toaster, so you shouldn't have any concerns about that. And as usual it runs at 60FPS.

[h1] MUSIC [/h1] 

The only saving grace of the original Wanderers from Ys was its soundtrack. It's amazing and for a long time was considered to be the best Ys soundtrack of all time. This also applied to most of its ports (aside from the NES and SNES ones, if you thought those sounded good you're clearly deaf). The PC-Engine version in particular was so amazingly amazing I feel all warm and tingly inside every time I hear it. 

Felghana, however, managed to not only match the PC-Engine soundtrack, but outright surpass it (though this can be debated). In both musical quality and technical quality, Felghana's soundtrack is godly. While both Ark and Origin suffered from the use of lower quality synths, Felghana completely lacks this problem. I've heard that Sound Team J.D.K. used live instruments for this one instead of synths, but even if it was synths they are extremely high quality.

In short: Oath in Felghana's soundtrack is simply perfect. It does its job perfectly in-game and 11 years later I'm still actively listening to it even outside of the game.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1] 

While Ys I & II were unique in their own right (I'm gonna punch the next person who calls them Zelda-likes, go do some actual research) Wanderers from Ys was nothing but a bad Zelda II clone. And being a bad clone was the least of its problems. The whole game was a mess especially when you started comparing all the different ports it had. It was so bad Ys IV went back to the style of I & II to prevent fans from burning down Falcom HQ.

For Oath in Felghana Falcom went and rebuilt everything from scratch. While all the areas of the original game are present here, everything has been vastly expanded and infinitely improved. Ys VI was used as a base for the gameplay and in the process they ironed out all the flaws Napishtim had and perfected it. The combat system is simple, but effective. The gimmicky dash jump is gone and Adol controls extremely tight and responsive.

The main complaint I hear from people who diss Felghana is the difficulty. 

I won't sugarcoat it, this game is brutal. Even on normal difficulty it can destroy you if you aren't careful (for reference I have nightmared every single Ys game that has nightmare difficulty aside from Felghana, I've only made it up to hard.) HOWEVER this game is completely and utterly fair. There are no bullsh*t ways to die, every death will be your own fault. 

The boss battles are the highlight of the game. I consider Ys VI's bosses to be extremely easy (not Ys V levels of easy, but close), but here it's the polar opposite. The battles are very intense, you'll need to learn how every boss works to survive and utilize your whole arsenal to achieve victory, especially once you move past normal difficulty. For people coming from the Souls series (because they are mainly the ones who brag about difficulty these days): forget everything you know, you'll need every bit of GIT GUD you can get to survive here. There's no hiding to take a sippie or summoning NPCs to help you, you get one life bar and that's it. You die: you start over.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1] 

Ys: The Oath in Felghana is an amazingly fun game and the perfect example of how a video game remake should be done. The only really bad thing about it is that it's also responsible for ruining the Ys fanbase by giving birth to the Felghana purists and later the Originbabbies (I'm not dissing Origin fans, only the fanboys who praise it as the second coming and sh*t on everything else).

It has an enjoyable story, good world-building, an amazing soundtrack and despite its difficulty it has addictive gameplay with god-tier boss battles. The amount of love put into this remake is outstanding and I highly recommend it to anyone who is truly passionate about video games.

[h1] A side note [/h1] 

There is also a PSP port of this game, but unless you really want to play it on the go I suggest you stick to PC. It does have some extras like NG+, a prologue novella, an extra opening cutscene, voice acting which ranges from good to awful and was also localized by an idiot who completely ruined the final boss (hope they got fired). However the difficulty was considerably lowered due to the ability to heal during bosses, it runs at 30FPS and generally looks and feels worse than the PC version.",1418838775,1494370432,True,6,0,0.588169276714324951,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Although Oath is technically the third game in the Ys series, newcomers can feel comfortable jumping at this point- the game barely references the previous games at all, in fact the only carryover are the two protagonists and all you need to know about them is readily apparent. The story won't shake your world but it's serviceable enough to give Adol an excuse to rampage through the world destroying the entire population of monsters in fluid and satisfying melee combat. 

It's an Ys game, so of course the soundtrack is superb. Lots of noisy high-tempo epic-metal to roll around to, but it never gets obnoxious. Personal favourite is the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHtkHlLcxQ]Valestine Castle theme[/url].

Speaking personally I preferred Ys Origin and would recommend that one above this, but the truth is they're both solidly built games and it probably just comes down to which you play first is the one you prefer.

This game is a remake and expansion of the Sega Master System's Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.

There are a few notable flaws, mostly on the highest difficulties.  Certain boss mechanics (Chester's teleport spam, or Gyalva's tile flipping on Nightmare) can randomly screw you and there's not always any clear difference between a failed run and a flawless one.  These are very rare, however, and a solid battle plan and execution will get you through almost everything all the way through the highest difficulties.

Descubrí la saga Ys en PSP hace unos años y cada juego de la saga se puede resumir en la siguiente línea: Action-RPG con un gameplay divertidísimo y desafiante (es curioso ver como te sientes el rey del barrio matando a los bichitos que hay en tu camino, hasta que llegas al jefe de la mazmorra y te mete una manta de palos bestial XD) y con una OST que es una delicia para tus oídos que van desde el precioso tema principal (con ese magnífico piano) hasta las guitarras de ""Valestein Castle"" rugiendo (AKA el tema del anuncio de la tienda de Steam) parida por los genios de la Falcom JDK Band.

En cuanto a la historia, sin ser nada del otro mundo, te mete en la situación que se está viviendo en Felghana y consigue entretener. Una de las cosas buenas que tienen los juegos de la saga Ys es que no necesitas haber jugado al anterior para poder enterarte del siguiente juego, cada juego es una nueva aventura de nuestro pelirrojo protagonista y es autoconclusiva.

En resumen, jugadlo y dejad que vuestros oídos disfruten de la gran OST mientras recorréis las tierras de Felghana.

A remake of the 16-bit era Ys III: Wanderers From Ys, Oath in Felghana is as close to a 16-bit action adventure game in 3D as you’re going to get. While humble in technology, Oath nails the character of a Mega Drive game to the wall. Wandering hero-dude Adol lives only to find new lands, people in trouble, and murder what’s troubling them. It’s pretty much expected of him. Here, he glides through hoards of monsters and demons, leaving a literal shower of fragments in his wake. Experience racks up, multiplied by keeping your kill count up. Dungeons are simplistic until the last third of the game, but offer satisfying platforming action to offset the killing. Bosses are huge, with patterns right out of an old school arcade game.

Sharp controls and a driving electronic orchestra finishes off the package. It acts as both nostalgic trip, and introduction to a simply satisfying franchise that’s been pushed by fans for a reason.

There's this kid, right.

I don't know if he's a kid or not but he looks like it, unless it's the rendition of him on that horrible boxart from some localized Ys game where he looks like a poor man's Conan.

He runs around and kicks the spines out of his enemies. Crushes them. Devestates them. He can jump like a running African and the world around him is full of giant monsters that sit there and wait, their whole life, for this kid to show up. Then they try to kill him and fail, because he's a badass.

Then there's this guy named Chester, right.

He's a negative point on the metaphorical IGN review.

He spits acid and breathes fire.

Adol has to do destroy him and trek all the way across the land, from the hangar, through the nuclear plant and command control, stop at central processing - it's a mess. All with no food. Then, he has to travel on foot to Installation 00 so he can activate the Halo Array.

Stop and think about that: that's 262,144 LIGHT YEARS on FOOT. 

The bosses at the first gas station stop on the way range from mildly amusing. The wolf with the sword is way too easy, the convicts in the humvee are overly difficult considering Adol doesn't obtain a firearm until level 28, they could at least have included a save point so you don't have to spend 37 hours (in real time, not game time) doing it again.

Final boss is a pushover. The minigame where you have to hide behind the curtains while his minions look for you at the top of his tower is MORE INTERESTING than the boss himself. After he dies, Great Fox picks you up, Adol returns to the Liberl Kingdom where some white haired jerkass going under the name of Morpheus gives him two handguns named Ebony & Ivory. It's pointless because you cannot use them as there are no more enemies to fight. There you are free to roam about on your Big Wheel obtained after the first third of the game located in Boletaria. 

This is where a lot of issues start coming in, because NG+ doesn't support vehicle upgrades. This effectively forces you to walk through each area and run into far too many random encounters with wild animals.

I mean, look,

It's a 6/10 game.

Mas se você é do tipo que gosta de RPG de ação E de desafios, compre. TODOS os bosses, desde o primeiro, te desafiarão. Te frustrarão. E exatamente por isso o sentimento de superação, satisfação após derrubar cada um deles é muito maior que em outros jogos do gênero. Uma dose de cortisol e adrenalina seguida de uma dose gigantesca de dopamina. Quem precisa de drogas com um jogo maravilhoso como este?

Ys nunca primou por uma trama complexa, cheia de reviravoltas geniais, convenhamos. O foco sempre é a jogabilidade e The Oath in Felghana não é exceção, apresentando excelência nesse aspecto. A história é bem simples mas cumpre seu papel. O visual é bem simples, porém bonito, bem acabado. A trilha sonora, como sempre, é um destaque à parte.

As much my thirteen year old self would hate to hear this, I'm not the gamer that I used to be. Fifteen years later, now an adult with a full time job, I don't have the devotion for gaming as much as I used to have. This game though allowed me to relive my experience of those days where I would stay up to the early hours of the morning, not at all concerned with sleep or the work that I had to be at in a few hours time.

I had recently picked this up on a sale. As it looked intriguing and was 75% off, I figured that I would give it a go. Going from its Metacritic store, I figured that it would be a 'Meh' kind of game. How wrong was I. This was easily the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a game this year.

Enough rambling, on with the review.

This is an action-RPG with a very satisfying combat system. Within minutes of starting, you're quickly thrown into it. Although the game has a story, a fairly good one at that, you won't be clicking through endless amounts of dull dialogue before you get to the action.

It's great fun as you run from screen to screen cutting down the monsters that face you. Although there is no way to heal on demand, when I first started playing, I didn't find this to be very challenging even on the normal difficulty, but it was still very satisfying.

When I reached the game's first boss, I got my arse handed to me, several times over. Here I initially thought that the game wasn't balanced properly. After a character level and learning the boss's patterns, I was finally able to get pass it, barely.

This is where that game's core challenge comes from; boss battles. Difficult but I wouldn't call them unfair. Once you're able to defeat them, you're bound to be able to repeat it. The game doesn't factor in luck much. It's a very rewarding experience to get through them.

In terms of playtime, it took me a little under 14.5 hours. I'm a gamer who tries to I try to find everything I can so it could probably be finished a lot quicker. In fact, there's an achievement to finish it in five hours or less. Could be completed over a weekend, or two in my case. To me, the length was just right, not too long nor too short.

Once completed, a boss battle mode is unlocked, and the game has five difficulty levels so it has some replayability. There's a number of side quests as well, some of which I somehow had missed so I'll be replaying it.

The game has a great soundtrack. Normally I'm not one to even notice this unless it's really good which I'm pleased to state is the case here.

I found the story to be better then the average JRPG. This is helped greatly with the range of characters, none of which are nameless or a palette swap of another, which are great contrasts to each other. The weakest would be protagonist who doesn't utter a word, with only a narrator describing his actions.

It's worth mentioning that for those who buy this, take a look at the forums as someone was able to extract the voices, which are only found in the PSP version of the game, working on this version which greatly adds to the game's atmosphere. It would be good if they're included by default though. Hopefully they'll be patched in in future.

With all the praise, it's not without its flaws though. This may not apply to the easy difficulty levels but I did spend a bit of time grinding. While cutting down monsters is fun, much more then a turn based RPG, when your EXP bar is rising very slowly, it can become repetitive.

You're bound to die a number of times on bosses. Mostly while trying to figure out their patterns and then some more after that. At times, I needed to take a break from this as it was becoming frustrating. On the other hand though, once you do get through them, it's very gratifying.

It's flaws are minor compared to the overall enjoyment I got from it though. I highly recommend this game.",1405753996,1405753996,True,12,0,0.646111249923706055,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I picked it up on a whim when it was on sale two weeks ago.  At first I thought it would get boring fast with routine hack and slash mechanics.  But lo and behold, you gain skills very quickly that constantly changes the way you engage with enemies.  Tons of fun.  

And then you find a save point outside of a big door.  You've been cruising through the game, destroying little baddies and leveling up.  Boss fight, no big deal right? WRONG.  I played through on normal, and every boss took me about 20-30 minutes to master and defeat (on NORMAL).  I realized this cartoony JRPG is just as hard as Demon/Dark Souls when it comes to boss fights.  But let me tell you, nothing is as satisfying as beating those bosses after you learn their every move. 

I've also played all the way through Ys Origin and loved that as well.  However, I think Oath is a better game when it comes to the boss fights.  Sure you get frustrated when the boss beats you for the fifth time and he only has 100 HP left, but its awesome when he goes down because you executed with almost no mistakes after learning everything he's going to do.

It's a remake of an older game which I did rent when I was younger but didn't really care for because the original was a bit too stiff of a challenge, especially when I was only 7 or so. Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.

The story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.

The music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.

The gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.

If you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.

The game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road. Doesn't have a new game + that the PSP version has but that's fine, it's fine how it is.

Story: 8/10
Graphics: 8/10
Sound: 10/10
Gameplay: 9/10

FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10

I fully reccomend this game especially for the price point. Can't go wrong.

I haven't played Ys origin yet or any of the PSP ones but this one is the best combat of the Ys games IMO. While my knowledge is only from ys 1 and 2, I think oath in felghana has a better combat system due to the fact it has an actual combat system.

While it centers around one area only they're still things to do even after you complete a certain dungeon. The main reason for return to each area as you progress through the game is the metroidvania like system that's implemented. As you gain new powers new areas that may have been inaccessible open up (Like a higher platform) and most of them have really cool treasure locked away.

Main story features Adol the Red and Doji returning to Doji's homeland and things soon get out of hand for the Duo (Like usual). Adol is seemingly stripped of everything at the start yet again, but from a gameplay perspective I understand why. I would have liked if they featured his last games armor and weapons as the basic starter items though.

The combat system is miles ahead of what ys 1 and 2 had with a combo system, magic built in, multiple magic moves that have charging attacks as well, can jump in the air and do air combos and downward slamming attacks.

A lot of the enemies in the game have some strong defenses in one category but may be extremely weak to another category (Strong vs attacks, weak vs magic). Once you figure out each enemies weakness they become slighty easier to kill off.

Bosses are really awesome in this game and most of them feel bullet-hellish (To a minor degree, nothing insane) and require you to learn the bosses patterns to beat them effectively. Some bosses do become pushovers if you overlevel an area via grinding.

Music is badass like usual with electric guitar and electronica sounds mixed into the game for a bunch of memorable tunes. Also another nice feature is no more grinding an enemy over and over again for its bestiary (Only have to beat it once for it information).

Positive:

Great combat system
Interesting combos both in the air and ground
Multiple magic charging attacks
Really interesting boss mechanics
Negative:

Stripped of everything at the start

If you like isometric hack and slash rpgs, and a decent challenge, this is the game for you. The gameplay's tight, and requires a certain level of skill so that you don't get wrecked, even on normal. The visuals are decent for the type of game it is, and for when it came out, but aren't going to win any awards.

The level design is also standout, and makes exploring for equipment and items more interesting.

Not because of a story, which is barebone and extremely cliche, but for the action and gameplay. Ys is of course from a long line of older ARPG, but if you would like to compare it to a modern game, that would be Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls. All 3 of theses games share the same philosophy. They are tough as nails, but they are fair.

Ys is all about skill. You discover new enemies, new bosses, and at the beginning it seems completely impossible, all the odds are stacked against you. Then you start noticing the attack patterns of the enemies. Then you start countering them and damaging them. Then you start feeling in control. But suddenly, with the boss at mid health, it is now using new patterns, and killing you fast ! But then you start noticing patterns again...and the circle can continue again...

You will die in Ys. You will die a lot in Ys. You will despair, you will rage against the game. But in your heart, you know the game is fair, it is just asking you to hone your skills to prove worthy of victory. And when finally, after countless retries you will manage to defeat that boss you've been stuck on forver, all your previous despair will turn into pure joy, and a feeling of true accomplishment.

All of that will also be amplified by the beauty of this game. Even though it's obviously dated, the rich environements and superb boss attacks will make you wonder how modern games can look so boring. There are some attack patterns and bosses that just look fantastic, original, and never before seen. That truely makes the game unique.",1394222827,1411581215,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a hack and slash rpg where you slay monsters and kill tough bosses to progress through the entire game. I liked Oath in Felghana because after playing Ys Chronicles, the game remains true to the series even if you can't bump into enemies anymore. So what did I think about it? Lets see...

Graphics: This game is a port from the PSP version that was released a few years ago. I liked how Oath of Felghana now has 3d backgrounds or monsters but still maintains a 2d layout. The sprites look nice if you set your graphics to the highest, but I personally think they are simple. I still find the game to great, even with it's cutscenes which look decent but could be better.

Sound: I really thought the sound department went forth and had fun making the music. There are good songs, but I just don't find myself to play over and over again. Sound effects are pretty basic, but I don't think that matters. There was never a moment where I just wanted to put my own music to the game which is a plus in my own opinion.

Gameplay: If you played Ys Chronicles, you realize that you can't bump into enemies like you used to for exp. There's now an attack button which can be used to string combos to gain exp. What I find the most rewarding is the three magics you obtain in the game. My favorite is probably the wind power since you use it to get to treasures and to another section of the level. If there is one thing I really enjoyed the most are the bosses. Playing on past normal is a challenge as it requires you to be quick about your actions and for you to time your attacks. The game is hard if you're not leveled correctly but it doesn't take you long to be strong enough to take on a boss. 

Overall: I consider Ys: The Oath in Felghana a great purchase if you enjoy J-rpgs that aren't complex, yet easy to play but difficult to master. I think falcom did great with this remake because it adds a new chapter in the Ys storyline for American audiences and it is faithful to the first two Ys games in the series.",1392682394,1392682394,True,16,0,0.580749630928039551,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But if so, this game should be avoided at all costs), and features a cozy, classic jRPG art style of 3D backgrounds with pre-rendered actors.  The battle system is also quick and enjoyable, if  a bit simple. 

That said, there are some things not that great concerning this game. First of all, it’s not particularly long for a role-play. Beating the game should take no more than 15 hours (and it is entirely possible to complete the storyline in about 5) which is not all that impressive concerning the fact that some other jRPGs have mini-games that are more time consuming.

 After completing the campaign, you can try the time attack or replay the story on another difficulty setting. There is no incentive to do so, since perhaps the Oath’s weakest point is its plot. The story told is extremely generic and predictable. Furthermore, the 30-some cast of characters is largely uninteresting. Finally, the extremely pompous  dialogue (and I do say that as a fan of jRPG narration) lines do not help at all.

 There aren’t  that many items to be collected either –  6 sets of equipment (sword, shield and armor each – all with 3 levels of upgrades ), 3 (also upgradeable 3 times )spells,  24 other items (usable, plot tokens or granting a particular ability). And , which is quite surprising in this genre – no party can be formed at any point of the game – the protagonist is forever alone (in battle) .        

What saves the day and, in the end, redeems this otherwise average game, are some of the most brilliant boss- battles I have ever seen in a jRPG game: quick, demanding and almost perfectly balanced to avoid the excessive grind (at least on the medium difficulty setting). 

Concluding, this is not a greatly memorable title and in the end I feel that it abused my longing for a classic jRPG experience, which  kept me in front of the computer until the end. 6 out of 10, and I recommend it solely due to the awesomeness of  boss battles.

If you want to jump in to the series, I recommend you play it on Easy first. Normal isn't that hard but the bosses will punish you for mistakes. The bosses themselves don't look bad and they have set patterns but dodging is harder than it looks and if you can't keep up BOOM! That's a tenth or more of your health gone.

There's also a bit of level scaling to the table. Say a boss is level 15, and you're level 12. You are going to get mopped on the floor. It's possible but it's really hard. Climb up to level 15 and you should be okay. Level up to 16. It's almost a joke! For the most part.

Before I broke down and bought it I stared at its gameplay video in steam. I stalked the title for months on end. I was delighted to see a JRPG on Steam. Would my delight be broken, or would I take the oath and never look back?

First off I must say I played this game to completion with a gamepad. I never even once tested out the keyboard ad mouse controls. This type of game just screamed use a controller to me haha. The game controls perfectly with a gamepad. Every little command I used worked, and never were the controls broken. A++ on that.

Sound design in Ys is all about the music. The sound effects are very basic and serve the game well, but do not stand out at all. The musical score on the other hand does stand out. Each piece was moving, and the guitar driven battle themes fit perfectly. Never once did I feel like I wanted to put on my own soundtrack while playing the game. If it's any testament to the games music, I would even go into the options menu just to play the games soundtrack a few occasions.

The story of the game is its weakest area. The game uses nearly every JRPG trope. I knew of every upcoming plot twist and action. This made me really sad as someone who enjoys a good narrative. I must admit though that not once did the narrative become convoluted. It served its purpous rather well, and that was to transition from dungeon to dungeon and the awesomely addicting gameplay.

The gameplay of Ys is where it's at. A simple mixture of semi strategic hack n slash with a dabble of platforming and RPG light elements. Combat is fast, fluid and when you get hit it's ultimately you're fault. The game doesn't offer that much in terms of different combos. You can perform only basic ground and air combos. You can't knock an enemy into the air and combo them further. What you can do is cancel combos to get in more hits. There are 3 magic in the game, but playing on normal I didn't find much use for them. The most useful if magics is the earth dash as it nullifies enemy attacks. Once you get this magic it'll be you're go to magic. This is because the game doesn't feature a shield or dodge roll which some may find annoying, but I understood it as part of the game.

Level design is simplistic and yet very well done. That being said, there are a few areas where you can enter a new screen keep holding the same direction, and move yourself back into the previous area. It's a personal annoyance to me. These areas are few and far between so it's not that big of a deal. The platforming segents mainly located towards the end of the game are well thought out. I initially believed I was going to have trouble with them until I realised your character shadow does appear on the ground. This way you could at least tell where you might land. For people who fear platforming there is a mode in options to make it even easier, and even at that there no fall related deaths in the game.

The bosses are where the game really shines. Each boss fight presents a new challenge and build upon eachother as the game progresses. You're first time playing the game the bosses will kick your ass, unless you're an uber-gamer, don't get discouraged. Their attacks hit hard, and require precise timing to dodge. There is also limited time to hit the bosses. That window becomes less and less as the game goes on forcing you to get better with your attack dodging. This type of progression is saught after by me, because no matter how much someone could power level, you still need the skill to back it up. Speaking of leveling in this game, I didn't have to grind more than one time, and the combat is so fluid and fun it didn't even feel like grinding and lasted all of thirty minutes anyways.

Ys: The Oath in Felghana isn't an expierence I'll soon forget. Nearly all elements of the game blend harmoniously into a polished hidden gem just waiting to be stumbled upon. I thought I was risking $15 paying full price for the game, but my apprehension was laid to rest quickly.",1385447237,1385960875,True,79,1,0.825641214847564697,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Overall, if I had to rank them, I'd go Felghana > Origin >>> Napishtim. But all three are masterpieces and worth playing (ok, maybe calling Napishtim a masterpiece might be an exaggeration after all, but I still find it great nonetheless). Since they're so very similar, I'll mostly use the same review for all three.
To me, this is David and Goliath: The Game. You keep fighting against seemingly impossible odds, both from the point of view of the story, and from that of the gameplay, as enforced by its crushingly high difficulty. I would never recommend not playing it on the highest difficulty setting, because I think overcoming its very fair, but very difficult challenges is the main selling point of this game. Every victory is a hard-earned triumph. There's just no other game that make me feel as heroic as this one.
I would also never recommend these games for their story. It's simply not the main focus, and is instead just a pretext for the action. This one in particular happens to be the weakest of the trilogy in that aspect in my opinion. It compensates for that default by having the best boss fights.
The soundtrack also happens to be so awesome that I feel it could easily justify buying the game even if everything else was of poor quality. Thankfully, that is not the case, and this phenomenal soundtrack serves to complement the also amazing action game that includes it and hype you into battle.",1382968945,1629200128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Although I can understand why this is the case; if you want a deep story with well-developed characters in a rich, vibrant world, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. (Or you could read a book.)

However, if your cup of tea happens to be runney-jumpey-hackey-slashey-swing-your-swordey-things-get-deadey gameplay where you mow down swarms of monsters, all building up to fights against gargantuan, screen-filling bosses with heavy rock music playing in the background, then you should totally give the Ys series a try. Like I said, they're a lot of fun.

I haven't played all the games in the series, but out of the ones I have played, I feel that The Oath in Felghana is pretty good game to start out with. I & II are fun, but very much showing their age; Seven is a good one also (and was actually my first Ys game), but it's only for PSP. I would actually argue that Origin is better than The Oath in Felghana, but being a prequel, it does have some spoilers for Ys I, and it doesn't have everyone's favorite mute redheaded berserker.

Every Ys game also comes with multiple difficulty settings, so if you want to let off steam by making everything that looks at you the wrong way your bitch, there's Easy and Very Easy. If you like a really good challenge, there's Nightmare and Inferno. And yes, holding down your jump button (at least I think it's the jump button, off the top of my head) speeds up the text scrolling in the cutscenes.

Speaking of buttons, if you have a USB controller, you're definitely going to want to dust it off; in my opinion, Ys games weren't meant to be played with a keyboard.",1370048655,1370048655,True,5,0,0.578449547290802002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You don't really think about how bullshitty games were back then when you were a kid, you just thought that taping the attack button down in the first dungeon and coming back later when you're at max level is just a thing you do. Most of the Ys games don't hold up really well, and that's why I'm glad Falcom has continually revisited the series while progressing it over the years.

This remake of Wanderers from Ys is completely top shelf. Sure, the story's still about as dry as it ever was, but the game is just a damn joy to play. Fast-paced, breakneck combat cut with (almost always) just the right amount of punishing difficulty and the spectacularly responsive controls make it a joy to play for those of us that like a good bit of twitch reflexes and pattern memorization. There's rarely ever any need to grind like in the original either, given that each dungeon is set to level you up appropriately before each boss encounter.

My only real issue is that the game's balance can be a bit wonky and a few boss encounters border on unfair and completely luck based. It's just really weird how a few times simply gaining one level or piece of gear will suddenly cut enemy damage down by 50-75%, and a few bosses can get really cheap in their patterns by either canceling their vulnerable states with attacks you simply can't dodge or unleashing a combination of attacks that trap you in a way that's really unfair. 

Even with its slight flaws, Oath in Felghana was a treat to roll through and I felt satisfied with my victory in the end in a way modern games don't really strive for anymore.",1359471390,1385409394,True,1,0,0.530516445636749268,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Recommendation is unchanged.

Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a full rework of the older Ys title ""Wanderers From Ys"", aka Ys III. The game is restructured as a top-down metroidvania reminiscent of Ys VI, which was their first title to use this layout. In place of modification rings is a magic ring system that would be repeated in Ys Origin, in which each ring serves a purpose at least once in this game.

Some much-needed changes in the dialogue, to reflect a more bold story, was welcoming; the music is a more modern remaster of the music of Ys III, done by the same in-house band, breathing new life into this rework.

However you don't need to know about the Ys series in order to enjoy this game. Exploration, combat and the engaging story is well worth the money you can invest. After you beat the game, you can particpate in Boss Rush to get the best boss kill times; or even try your hand at the insanely cruel Inferno skill if Nightmare was not punishing enough.

Besides that, this game isn't quite as linear as Origin, but then Origin makes up for it by telling a better story and multiple characters with multiple stories.

This game's graphics can be slightly bland with the odd shading style, but in a way it's quite a work of art. The level designs are actually well done. The controls are responsive besides my nit pick with upward slashing. Bosses are EPIC, especially as you progress. The game is literally worth $5 JUST for the boss fights. It's a fun game that will probably take you about 10-15 hours to beat once, but if you want to get all the items and sidequests (there aren't a lot of items, as it's a fairly short game compared to most RPGs), you'll probably spend more than 15 hours. I admit the story could be better, but in the end it's a great game!

Ys: Oath in Felghana was released for the PC in 2005 and was the first of the Ys III remakes to have a 3D world. It also has a perfectly remixed soundtrack that does not take the feel away from the epic original.

I reviewed it back in 2012 or so, but reviewed it before I finished the game which just didn't feel right to me. After seven years I finally went back and finished it, so now I'm taking another crack at reviewing it. It's an old game, so did it hold up after all this time?

Putting it simply: Yes. It's good. The combat is fast and satisfying; the combo system encourages you to be as aggressive as possible to earn the most XP. The game very rarely slows down to force you through any long boring segments (except for the unskippable cutscenes). The RPG elements are light and almost seem like they don't affect anything at certain points, but leveling up a few times and breezing through earlier parts of the game where you previously struggled feels really satisfying.

Come for the gameplay, stay for the music. There really are some nice jams in this game, especially in the mines and outside Redmont. It's a mix-mash of classical music, techno, and metal that sounds bizarre on paper, but actually ends up being really catchy. None of the songs in the game ever felt annoying, and I even found myself humming a few tunes when I wasn't playing the game.

It has its downsides, but they're not even that bad. The story is basically only there to move the game along and the level design is painfully simple and linear. Bosses have massive difficulty spikes compared to the rest of the game, but even then, they aren't unbeatable. I think the difficulty spikes are fine though, they're exist to remind you to actually focus instead of just mindlessly slashing through the rest of the game.

One issue worth knowing isn't with the game itself, but with the port. It's a good port, gives plenty of options for resolution, controls, etc. But since the game is so old, it may be slightly incompatible with newer versions of Windows. At times, the graphics bugged out really badly and I couldn't continue playing, but I was able to circumvent this by playing the game in DirectX 8 mode instead which worked just fine and didn't have an issue with for the rest of the game.

Overall, it's a good game. It's still worth playing today if you want a break from other games in the ARPG genre or haven't played the other Ys games. If the sequels are even remotely comparable to this one, then I'm sure they'll be just as good if not better.",1343073482,1558564242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is simple in nature but carefully balanced, never unfair, exremely fast and fun. You start with a simple sword combo and jump, but subsequently aquire other abilities, like dash and double jump, as well as elemental spells, that not only do damage, but change the way you move and behave in battle. Wind spell lets you glide in air, useful for making long jumps and avoiding some boss attacks; Earth spell can break some walls to reveal hidden paths and provides you with invincibility frames; Fire spell... just shoots fireballs, that's all.

Main gameplay basically consists of two sections.
First, you have to traverse the level and reach the next boss. Enemies in level may start as challenging and drive you back to town to heal and upgrade your equipment, but little by little you will be pushing forward, gaining levels and eventually will overcome any obstacle. Exploring levels rewards you with some very useful items as well.
Then, when you get to the boss, real fun starts. Game rewards you with an achievement for dying ten times in a single boss fight and I almost got it with the very first boss encountered - reached 9/10. Needless to say, I ""succeeded"" unlocking this achievment with the second boss. Boss attack patterns are varied and tend to change mid-fight, when you think you're adapted to it. The last boss in particular will mercilessly test everything you learned in the game - you have to have lightning reflexes and full control over your character movements to beat it, but when you'll do it you will feel like total badass.

I wrote this review awhile ago, but the developers have been improving this game alot. They now added voice acting to most characters. This game is a spirited remake of Ys3: Wanderers from Ys which originally was on the Super Nintendo or Super Famicon, from wherever you live. 

This game first was on a portable gaming system, but eventually got ported to pc. This port is very stable. This is not like the original Ys 1 and Ys 2 as it actually lets you control a sword with a controller. This game gets rid of the old ""BUMP"" system from Ys1 and Ys2. Anyways, here is my pro/con list:

PROS:
- Continuation of game from Ys 1 and Ys 2. This is third in the series chronologically, not timeline.
- Same graphics as Ys1 and Ys2.
- A new place with a new storyline
- The return of magic!
- Voice acting on mostly the main characters. Some lesser characters are not voiced.
- Actual sword controlling.
- The ability to ""jump"".
- New soundtracks for every location in game! You can choose alternative ones in the options menu.

CONS:

- The game seems too short to me.
- The learning curve is semi medium..it does have a easy mode though...

Recommended for great game in the YS series. Check out the rest of most of the YS series found on steam.

Great gameplay, hard bosses.


SPECIAL NOTE: You may have to fine tune your graphics settings for this game as if you want to do decent screenshots, it is picky about settings.

Concessions to convenience, such as an unrestricted teleport system, keep mid-to-lategame travel times and backtracking relatively painless.

If I had to nitpick, I'd pick on a flaw endemic to the Y's series based on its action-RPG makeup, which is that boss difficulty can vary dramatically based on your gear; Especially early on, it can go from very difficult to near-trivial in the span of a single level-up or equipment upgrade.

Still, If you're looking for an old-schoolish platformer-slasher action-RPG, head to Felghana.",1332938824,1332938824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ys III was the sequel to the classic Ancient Ys Vanished duology, and followed the autobiographical story of the world's most famous adventurer, Adol ""The Red"" Christin, albeit in a new setting with a plot mostly unrelated to the previous games.  The Oath in Felghana follows the same overall story as the original, but with many additions.  However, the story is not even remotely the focus of the game and while the characters are charming and the plot is by no means awful or unbearable, it's also very barebones, like its predecessors.  The series is well-known for its fantastic music, and The Oath in Felghana is no exception to this.  It has one of the finest soundtracks in the industry, with calm, soothing melodies, fast-paced frenetic orchestral music, and powerful rock themes for the more intense fights.
Ys III's main departure was in the gameplay department, where the top-down ""bumper car"" combat of the previous games was replaced by a side-scrolling platformer.  This new style was poorly received by series fans for being too clunky and slow in comparison to the older combat style.  The Oath in Felghana completely overhauls the combat and gameplay, to the point where the only real similarity to the original are some side-scrolling-styled segments.  
The combat in The Oath in Felghana is a drastically improved version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim's style.  It's a fully 3D action-based combat system that is extremely fast paced and rewards patience, quick reflexes, timing, and the utmost precision over memorization, button mashing, ""cheesing,"" or trial-and-error.  Unlike Ys VI, there are no consumable healing items in The Oath in Felghana.  The only way to restore your health is by touching a save point, using one-time powerups occasionally dropped by enemies, or by leveling up.  You can also restore health while outside dungeons by standing still for an extended period, but it's usually faster to simply run to a save point.  In addition, enemies will sometimes drop powerups that boost your stats temporarily, and keeping on the offensive keeps your combo counter high, giving you bonus experience.  This combination rewards players for keeping a fast tempo through a dungeon, as staying on the offensive levels you more quickly and nets you more stat and health bonuses.  However, during a boss fight, there are NO powerups available, so you can only defeat the boss with pure skill.  With the exception of a single boss on a specific difficulty setting, every attack that each boss uses can be completely avoided with the right timing and technique, and thus you must be entirely reliant on your skills and reflexes to win.  This doesn't mean that the bosses are easy, however, as some bosses will fill their arena with projectiles and particle effects that can be extremely difficult to avoid effectively while also damaging the boss.  Each boss is also entirely unique, except two recurring boss fights (which are significantly more powerful and more difficult on their second round) and no bosses that might as well just be a really powerful regular enemy.
 While each level is memorable and each combat skill you obtain is used to traverse dungeons and avoid traps, regular enemies can sometimes be very simple to defeat on lower difficulties, which can lure some players into a false sense of security, leading them into believing they're ready to fight a boss when they may not be.  One thing that is very important to remember in The Oath in Felghana is to ALWAYS ensure that you've explored every level thoroughly and obtained each treasure, and to upgrade your equipment regularly.  If you don't, the game will punish you HARD.  This can be a tempting challenge to skilled veterans, but to players not used to RPG-styled exploration, it can be a very rude awakening.  In addition, the game is very difficult.  The lower difficulties are definitely managable for most players, but they also dull the experience somewhat.  Normal will provide a good challenge to those who don't often play action games.  Hard and Nightmare difficulties will provide a significant challenge even for the most skilled and experienced players and can be extremely frustrating for people unused to the genre.
The Oath in Felghana has a Time Attack mode that you can unlock upon completion of the game that allows you to re-fight any boss on any difficulty with pre-set equipment and stats, and while this can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to those looking to challenge themselves at speedrunnin or people who just want to re-visit their favorite boss fights on various difficulties (as well as an opportunity to unlock a secret boss), the game offers little else in terms of replay value other than playing the game again on a higher difficulty (which improves boss' AI and makes many of their attacks more complex and harder to avoid).  However, for $15, The Oath in Felghana is worth the price of entry even if you only complete the game once (which should take between 10 and 20 hours) and then never touch the game again.  Ys: The Oath in Felghana is one of the best action games ever released, and is most definitely worth the low cost.",1332328010,1385554879,True,6,0,0.531006515026092529,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Felghana is one of the bests Ys from all time. This is the perfect remake for Wanderers From Ys : Nervous gameplay, perfect OST (Rock and electro), and good difficulty.
Just buy, 15 dollars is a steal for that game. You will have fun on this, even if this is your 2xxx playthrough !",1332184430,1332184430,True,2,0,0.488667279481887817,0,True,False,False,False,,,

个人认为YS系列最好的一作（没有之一）
自由度相对于起源要高了不是一点（前者毫无自由度可言）
再者剧情此作也比起源剧情要好不少
不过缺点还是有的，感觉BOSS难度不如起源，并且剧情长度也偏短
不过还是那句话Falcom出品，必属精品！！！

希望双星物语系列能早日登陆STEAM哦~~~~",1332177319,1332177319,True,4,0,0.567567586898803711,2,True,False,False,False,,,
