Del pugile che fui poi non fui più
E di una mia, direi, caratteristica
Che mi evitò le botte
Nel campo della boxe
Col fatto che da piccolo ero piccolo
Le zuffe le schivavo o perlopiù
Finivano col capo dei rivali
Che diceva “non ti picchio
Solo perché hai gli occhiali”
E cominciai di colpo ad anni sette
La vita da quattrocchi e due stanghette
Così iniziò la mia carriera atipica
Picchiavo io ma non picchiavan me
E non per la mia condizione atletica
Ma perché se hai l’occhiale
Nessuno ti fa male
E questo sono io
Luigi il pugilista
Che ha il dono della svista
E che nessuno pesta
Faccio a modo mio
E pugilo da dio
Senza venir percosso
Perché io invece posso
E le manone addosso
Gliele metto io

Lo so che l’altro a me mi sottovaluta
Ma tiro i pugni a vanvera finché
Colpisco col bicipite l’occipite

Sì che l’ha capito
L’ho menato io

Ma un giorno al suono della campanella
Fece il suo ingresso quella donna bella
Che regge il numero del round in corso
Io all’improvviso mi sentii disperso
Tolsi gli occhiali per sembrare aitante
E l’avversario me ne diede tante
Ma questo sono io
Luigi il tumefatto
Che dall’84 deteneva il titolo dei pesi paglia
E quando mi svegliai
Vedevo molto meglio
E quella donna bella che sembrava bella

How to make babies

Sure, you know the basics of how babies are made - a man and woman have sex and nine months later, a beatiful baby is born. But there's actually a lot more to it than that.

Here are all the fascinating biological facts about getting pregnant.

How do women's eggs develop?

For women, a potential pregnancy begins in the ovaries, those two almond-shaped glands attached to either side of the uterus.

Ovaries come fully stocked: You are born with 1 to 2 million eggs - more than a lifetime's supply. The eggs begin dying off almost immediately, and no more are ever produced.

Altogether, you probably release about 400 eggs over the course of your reproductive years beggining with your first period and ending with menopause. (usually between ages 45 and 55)

The in-game maps don't state where each location goes and you can't actually see maps of other locations, so you're required to memorize the ENTIRE GAME or look up the maps online.  Enemies also scale with your level, which completely nullifies every single RPG element the game has by making your skill unlocks and stat increases completely pointless.  Money is literally useless, so I've obtained over 80,000 ""salami"", which happens to be the game's primary currency.  Enemies can be immune to all but one kind of attack, or strong to all but a few, so you'll be forced to carry multiple weapons with you to kill everything.  There's even an enemy type which seems to be immune to everything, but is actually capable of avoiding almost every single attack, making them a tedious chore to deal with when it makes it seem like you're unable to damage them.

You can't rearrange items in your inventory, so anything you want to keep and bring with you will have to be scattered at random, or dropped and picked up so they auto-sort back to the first available slot in the order you pick them up in.  You can't jump unless you buy an item, but that item goes into an equipped item slot, making that slot completely useless for literally all of the other items you can get for it in the game which are easily superior to the stats of the spring used to jump.  If you're on stairs or too close to an object or wall, you can't jump, so you'll occasionally find yourself running through lava when you're trying to jump over it.  I once had a bug that caused me to be stuck without my character being visible while at 0 hp, forcing me to exit the stage with the pause menu, effectively being that of a softlock bug.

There are also absolutely NO waypoints for any quests, which is especially problematic when there's a quest which requires you find 5 pizza boxes throughout the game if you wish to progress through and finish the main story quest.  However, in order to even have those boxes count, you must first find the stereotype pizza guy in the lava zone, called Lavillage, and speak to him, then check the note on the counter.  Or, at least, that's what I'm assuming, since I can't find any guides on the game to further elaborate, so that's what information I was able to discern when trying to figure out a solution to the biggest problem the game has: A GAME-BREAKING BUG!

You see, when I play a game, I try to explore every single inch of it, which is exactly what I did on this one.  I'm certain I found every single pizza box in the game, but not a single one of them counted.  Why, when I know the quest is required and could easily go and grab it?  Simple: because the game wouldn't give me the quest.  Based on images I could find on the one site I was able to find which gives a guide on achievement hunting for it, the locations of pizza boxes are supposed to get marked in your quest list as individual quests, but that never happened for me.  I returned and again tried to make the quests show up, but they still wouldn't.  Thus, I was completely incapable of obtaining the quests for the pizza boxes, and there's nothing in the game that even suggests to you that such a quest would be required to proceed.  Absolute and total amateur hour in game design.

So, a broken quest isn't a big deal, right?  How can that be game-breaking when it sounds like a side quest?  Because that side quest is REQUIRED in order to enter a location called Dream World, where you find Wizard Soilent.  I found every other wizard in the game, but can't find Wizard Soilent all because I'm incapable of entering Dream World, because I'm unable to get the pizza quest.  That also means that I've yet to complete the game as I'm writing this review, all because the game is broken in a way that I'm incapable of continuing it unto completion.  This bug is what's known as a hardlock, since there's no way for the player to fix it and it halts all progression.  And, no, exiting to the main menu and re-entering the game doesn't solve the issue, nor does relaunching it.

Even the controls of the game leaves much to be desired.  Aiming doesn't feel right, with shots never going where the direction indicator says they will when aiming in diagonal directions.  Hit detection is really bad.  Some enemies are overpowered, especially when they call in healers who can restore them to max health in a matter of seconds, or the cardboard box enemies that have perfect accuracy and blast a laser at you that's strong enough to quickly take away half your health.

Getting knocked down is also nothing but enraging, as it happens so frequently, you'll find yourself mashing buttons during almost every fight just to get up and continue fighting, as is required to continue moving after being knocked down.  And, there's no way of swapping to keyboard and mouse while in-game, so there's absolutely no use of a keyboard and mouse for any functionality if you launched with a controller, even to pause the game with ESC.  Even the weapons and gear in the game are garbage and largely based on RNG.

Bottom line: avoid this game at all costs.  It's a pile of garbage that's not worthy of a play, and I know for a fact there's been more bugs in it than what I've mentioned, it's just taken me so long to get to this point that I can't remember them all.  However, in the end, all of the bugs I've encountered in the game, even when a pressure plate was nonfunctional while being pressed down with an item or when an enemy was randomly stuck inside a wall, are things that could be considered minor issues, but the game-breaking bug that's halted my completion is major and makes this a defective product.  If I wasn't so far over the limits for a refund, I'd be refunding this game.

Also, on a final note, it's a really stupid idea to make an entire dungeon take place in the absolute darkness, preventing the player from seeing anything.  Sure, there's lanterns, but those actually break in this game, especially if you drop one too close to SOME walls to try and pick them up after you jump up, since you can't jump while holding items.  Those lanterns are also few and far between, and eating one of them, or eating a lightbulb, does damage to you and only lasts for a short while.  If you can't see what you're doing, it's not good gameplay, it's pathetically bad game design.",1682327838,1682382966,False,2,0,0.497382193803787231,0,True,False,False,True,,,

游戏战斗的核心乐趣应该是围绕着投掷这个动作吧，有几个理由。第一，如果不是为了突出投掷，没有理由把普通攻击的操作设计的偏shit（手柄来说）。第二，普攻敌人的作用主要是击晕而不是造成伤害，然后击晕之后，敌人居然会进入无敌状态，这个时候只能投掷出去造成地形杀伤害（投掷到地上还没伤害）。[spoiler]有时候明明敌人只有一点血了，却必须等待几秒、多几个操作才能击杀（手柄上得2个摇杆+1个键才能完成），这种体验真的很差。 [/spoiler]基于上面这2点，我倾向于认为游戏想着重强调投掷玩法，我的评价是有点太强行了。换句话说，强行降低其他玩法的体验来提升投掷的重要性，这在我看来有点舍本逐末。

当然如果游戏内容不多，2-3个小时，这种强行也不是什么大事，无非就是一个短小精悍、以玩法为核心的游戏嘛。但是目前看来游戏流程起码在10个小时以上，那这样的核心玩法完全没办法撑起那么多的游戏内容。

当然了，这个游戏可以4个人玩，可能游戏内容是为了4个人设计的，比如箱子、食物的数量，所以一个人玩起来会很累。我没有朋友，所以大概体会不到很多游戏的乐趣所在。

这个画风我还是会给好评。",1676797866,1676798166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I bought this last year during a Steam sale to play with a friend using the Remote Play Together feature. Although it was on sale, I still paid a little more for it than I wanted to. However, I typically love Action RPGs, and this one seemed like it had a fun Castle Crashers-like aesthetic. Our first impression was decent enough - we thought the music was pleasant and found a few of the jokes pretty funny. 

However, we quickly found that our equipped weapons just didn't do much damage. It seemed to always be more effective to pick up whatever was in the current room and hurl it at the enemies. While this was amusing at first, after a while I began to feel less investment my character and their abilities. I didn't help that in my time with the game, I didn't stumble on much to help me truly customize my character or create a ""build."" 

We also got bogged down relatively quickly in little switch and plate puzzles, which made the game feel a lot slower than something like [b]Diablo[/b]. We spent more time than we wanted looking for rocks of particular colors and trying to navigate the maps.

I think the combination of 1) the lack of customization (or at least the game not getting to the customization elements quickly enough) and 2) the tedium of the level design just made us lose interest. Perhaps I'd like this more if my sense of humor was sillier or if I was playing with kids. I usually play Action RPGs to create fun builds, and in the hour and a half I played, I didn't get the sense that that was what this one was about.",1645545360,1645545360,False,6,0,0.543985188007354736,0,True,False,False,False,,,

目前已通关一周目，不过博物馆任务未完成。剧情很沙雕，合家欢结局，非常符合它的画风，[spoiler]也揭开了主角的身世之谜[/spoiler]

游戏本体原价比较贵，建议打折入。

好游戏，一个人都可以玩得很开心（落泪）。中文翻译存在一些问题，不过就算拿中文玩大部分情况下，因为文本本来就比较无厘头，大多数时候看不出什么猫腻。不过机会森林门口的提示建议拿英文看，中文看存在问题，可能导致卡关。如果实在不知道，就硬试吧。试个几次也就猜对了，一共就三个口给你选。
因为游戏本身比较小众，详细攻略也并没有，所以下面给新人点建议，帮助你快速脱贫（划掉。如果有空的话，以后可能写一篇全流程攻略。

一点点小建议：
[spoiler]1.游戏的难度其实是鼓励玩家多人游戏的，如果单人玩的话个人建议玩特殊能力为治疗的角色。
2.勤看角色的属性面板，各种状态都可以在那里看见。
3.前期优先复原礼品店，把弹簧买过来。
4.这个游戏的怪物和你的人物平行升级，但是你个人的能力提升其实并不大。不要刻意去刷怪。
5.面对新图个人体感觉得第一条命先用来快速探图。探完后再进行正常摸索，并且勤看大地图。比如骷髅三兄弟那里的地窖要你开8个开关，该地图的怪你本身就很难打死，攻击还巨高，一摸80一摸120。建议拿着个灯就跑。
6.注意属性克制！！！！！！！！！！！！！什么图用什么装备都有讲究，这个游戏不是一套装备就能玩到底的！选对了装备会轻松很多！
7.建议使用远程武器，[strike]近战不是给人玩的。[/strike]
8.游戏的装备不是品质越高就越适合你！
9.平时各属性的武器都带一把。能量，毒，火，冰（
10.副手武器建议带特殊能力是AOE伤害的，比如那本魔法属性攻击的陨石书。
11.Q：月球上的boss护盾怎么破？A：寿司boss的护盾用对应颜色的小寿司去砸即可解除，机器人喵二代是打不死的（大概），把它打到进入修复状态，就去打门。[/spoiler]

[h1]前言[/h1]
魔犬大乱斗是一款有着如同《欢乐氰化秀》般可爱简笔画画风的2d俯视角动作冒险游戏。


[h1]游戏体验[/h1]
蛋糕巫师不幸过世，他那个强大的魔法狗把世界搅合了个天翻地覆。这样的故事开端为本作奠定了满满的恶搞基调。玩家所操作的角色虽然可以装备刀剑之类的攻击武器。不过过相比之下拾取地上的武器直接砸向敌人效率会更高。玩家通过举起，石头，香蕉，蛋糕等，饼干等各种道具作为投掷武器，当然这些道具也不仅仅可以用来砸向敌人，也可以通过按住鼠标右键将其吃下，如果吃下蛋糕，苹果之类的食物，通常会给玩家补血以及加上一些良性buff，如果吃下了石头，毒瓶之类的物品则会带来扣血之类的反效果,受制于本作画风限制，玩家偶尔或误将一些不能食用的物品当做食物吃下，让自己哭笑不得。本作还具备一些难度适中的解密桥段，例如通过捡起的特定形状的重物去压住有着同样符号的压板机关。
本作的玩法也相对比较自由，玩家可以根据游戏的机制，结合自己的脑洞想出不少用了对付敌人的“损招”，例如用石头砸晕对手然后将敌人举起，丢到附近的小河里看它在书里“吐泡泡”去。
本作在游玩人数上比较推崇多人同乐，最多支持4人共斗。如果有小伙伴一起游玩本作，无论是一同“欺负”敌人，还是一起“互相伤害”应该都能带来不少乐趣。不过稍微有些可惜的是本作当前只支持本地合作。如果可以像《战斗砖块》《城堡破坏者》那样支持在线多人，让更多周边没有小伙伴再身边玩家加入本作，必然会为造福跟多玩家。


[h1]总结[/h1]
简洁搞怪的画风，脑洞大开的玩法，如果喜欢多人同乐类游戏那么不妨尝试一下欢乐满满的本作。

イタリア産の変なRPG。変という言葉で済ませてしまうのは勿体ない。一歩間違えればキチ〇イレベルで変な文章や装備が登場するRPG。

長所
・唯一無二のクレイジーな世界観。
主人公の名前を決める際に「適当付けちゃおう」と、[b]予め用意された適当な単語から名前を付ける[/b]という斬新なゲームデザイン。一応名前に使われそうな単語が並んでいるので名前らしい名前を付ける事はできる。
冒頭で主人公は逮捕されるがとある理由ですぐに開放される。その理由が他のゲームや映画ではまず見ないような酷すぎる理由。
・役に立たないTips。
従来のゲームであればロード中はゲームのヒントや世界観に関する情報を提示するだろう。
しかし、本作のロード中に表示されるTipsはあまりにもぶっ飛んでいてまるで役に立たない。その量も結構あるのでそれを楽しみにプレイするのもいい。
・開発の精神を疑うようなアイテム達。
装備できる物と落ちている物の２種類があり、意味不明な物や常人には理解し難い物が混じっている。
地面に落ちている物は拾ったり食べると博物館に飾られ、フレーバーテキストを読める。
・こんなふざけたゲームなのにRPGの部分はしっかりしている。
所謂ディアブロ系ゲームのような装備システムを採用しており、同じ装備でもsufix prefixが違えば追加能力も違う。
排他的なスキルツリーも存在しており、自分のプレイスタイルに合ったビルドがある程度組めるようになっている。
・こんなふざけたゲームなのにアクションゲームとしての完成度が高い。
敵をただ殴るだけでなくその辺に落ちている物を投げたり、倒れた敵そのものを壁にぶつけたり出来る。
メインハンド武器とオフハンド武器を素早く切り替えられるので、テンポ良く様々な武器を使い分けられる。

短所
・攻略に必須なアイテムの入手方法がわかりにくい。
段差を登るアイテムの存在は、ゲーム内である程度匂わせてはいるものの明確な入手の仕方はプレイヤーには提示されない。
実は貴重な通貨を使用して街の建物を復旧できるのだが、そのアイテムの入手方法は攻略とは全く関係なさそうな娯楽施設の復旧で、鍛冶屋やアクセサリーショップ等の実用的な建物の復旧を優先した場合延々とアイテムを求め彷徨う羽目になる。(アップデートで復旧前からアイテムが見えるようになり改善された)
・一部の強すぎる能力やアイテム達。
操作キャラの中でも特殊能力が回復系の者や、敵を倒す度に体力が回復するエビリオ等はゲームをかなり優位に進められる。
オフハンド装備の中でもずば抜けて性能が高い「エスプレッソ」。全能力強化＋スタン無効は本作の攻略を簡単にする事間違いなし。
・MP関連に問題が多い
レベルが上がるとアイテムレベルも上がり消費MPがどんどん増える。にも拘わらず威力は据え置きなのでレベルを上げる程使いづらくなっていく。
更にはMPがいくら増えようが自然回復の速度は固定値なのでMP消費が激しいスキルやアイテムを使い続けるのは難しい。

総評
変な世界観や文章に耐性があるなら是非ともプレイして頂きたい。
見た目のカジュアルさとは裏腹に難易度はそれ程簡単ではない。(見つけた装備次第では攻略が厳しくなりがち)

Nonostante il gamedesign ha altri e bassi (qualche dungeon è piuttosto intricato...) e la ripetitititititività, ho trovato divertente il fatto che bisogna ""cercare"" gli obiettivi delle missioni come si faceva una volta; nessuna freccia o puntatore sulla mappa ma suggerimenti nel libro delle quest.
Il nosense di Sio pervade tutto il gioco, l'unica frase sensata credo sia quella che all'avvio ti dice di non uscire dal gioco durante i salvataggi.
In breve:

PRO
-ARPG non banale, vecchio stile
-Gameplay semplice
-Umorismo nosense OVUNQUE
-Tanti personaggi da sbloccare e diverse quest secondarie.
-Campagna cooperativa e modalità pvp locale
-Difficoltà calibrata bene (nemici che diventano più forti con il livellare del giocatore)

CONTRO
-Gameplay ripetitivo
-Alcuni dungeon facoltativi sono MALVAGI
-La campagna coop non funziona sempre (fasi platform)
-Umorismo nosense OVUNQUE (non piace a tutti e potrebbe stancare)

Devo ammettere che ad un certo punto stavo quasi per lasciarlo perdere per la frustazione causata dalla difficoltà di alcuni boss, ma proseguire e completarlo tutto sommato è stato divertente.

So di essere una persona che tende a sproloquiare, quindi proverò a strutturare un po' di più la mia opinione.... ne uscirà comunque un tl;dr.

PRO:

- Grafica: Potrebbe piacervi o meno lo stile, ma il gioco trasuda ""Scottecs Comics"" da tutti i pori!
Anche quanto ""integrato"" dagli sviluppatori è totalmente in linea con lo stile (le mappe e alcuni mob/NPC non direttamente disegnati da Sio).
Soprattutto sulle mappe (a livello ESTETICO) è stato fatto un lavoro magistrale.
Non noterete stacchi o mancanze di linearità nello stile dei vari elementi.

- Musiche: FANTASTICHE! Non c'è altro da dire. Sono orecchiabili e moderne, con forte richiamo agli 8bit. Gusti personali a parte, le musiche sono perfette!

- Sonoro: Qui, a parer mio, si passa dal fantastico all'evitabile.
Il richiamo è sempre agli 8bit, ma a volte il risultato è ""sporco"".
Es: i suoni relativi all'uso dei portali, pari ad un comodor 64 col volume a palla e casse guaste.
Comunque per la maggiore il sonoro è certamente più un punto a favore che a sfavore.

- L'idea base del gameplay: Anche qui in realtà alti e bassi, ma l'idea BASE del gameplay, cioè lanciare e mangiare cose, è sia originale e divertente, che in linea col non-sense di Sio.
I ""bassi"" invece sono quasi tutti collegati alle snaturatezze che tale gameplay ha acquisito col passare degli anni di sviluppo.
Ma di questo... beh parleremo nei contro.

- Almeno 6 ore di divertimento ve le garantisce. Poiché la parte iniziale del gioco è, a parer mio, quel che l'intero gioco sarebbe dovuto essere e quel che vi aspettate che sia.

E se questo vi può già bastare, comprate pure il gioco e invertite la mia rece negativa, in una rece positiva. ^_^


CONTRO:

- Prezzo: partiamo dall'ovvio ed evidente. Perché anche se i dev hanno giustificato il prezzo, resta un prodotto che non è esattamente a buon mercato. E sono sicuro che il prezzo sia il motivo per cui il gioco manca in molte librerie di Steam.

- Bugs: nonostante gli anni di sviluppo e supporto della community, il gioco ha ancora dei bug. Il problema non sono i bug in sé, ma il fatto che possano costringervi a rifare completamente una mappa. E rifare una mappa in mid-late game, non è cosa da poco.

- Ripetitività: principalmente, il fatto che le mappe si resettino completamente, salvo poche eccezioni, può rendere snervante e noioso il gioco quando tocca rifare/ripassare dalle stesse aree per svariati motivi.
Inoltre il respawn dei mob è troppo rapido, quindi in spostamenti ed esplorazione, dovrete riaffrontare frotte di mob... e siccome la varietà per singola mappa è limitata, inizierà a dare un feeling di ripetitiva e noiosa perdita di tempo.
Per diminuire il senso di ripetitività, sarebbe carino se si salvasse lo stato delle mappe ""risolte"" e che i ""nidi"" dei mostri si resettassero ogni 5 o 10 minuti, invece che ogni minuto o minuto e mezzo.

- Alcuni mob sono noiosi o sbilanciati. E li dovrete affrontare spesso (vedi quanto scritto sopra).
|
-- Noiosi: alcuni mob non sono pericolosi, ma richiedono comunque tempo per abbatterli.
Esempi pratici:
--- il frigo gigante: senza senso. Non attacca ed è sfondato di vita... Potreste ignorarli, ma lasciano perplessi. In più in alcuni punti il frigo è il boss e devi affrontarlo per forza.
--- la goccia blu: che evita quasi tutti i colpi. Quindi o hai armi/oggetti ad area, oppure stai lì ad aspettare che si lasci colpire.
|
-- Sbilanciati: a parte alcuni boss con tantissima vita e vulnerabilità ad un solo tipo di danno (cosa che snatura la meccanica base di lanciare cose). Ci sono anche dei mob comuni minori che non scherzano e sono davvero letali se sottovalutati.
In primis il cubetto arancione: se non lo stecchite appena nato, spara un potente raggio laser che tracka il giocatore e molto probabilmente vi ucciderà immediatamente se vi raggiunge... ed è un mob base!
Inoltre più avanti nel gioco troverete sempre più spesso mob base che subiscono danno da UN SOLO elemento, come fossero dei boss. E se non avete a portata di mano armi con quell'elemento... niente, siete fottuti.

- Mappe troppo intricate. IMHO uno dei motivi principali che portano all'abbandono. A meno di giocatori affezionati o con carattere stoico e paziente...
Io credo proprio che nel mid-late game i map designer si siano fatti prendere la mano. Finendo probabilmente per distruggere ciò che aveva tutti gli elementi per essere un fantastico gioco.
L'intricatezza ed il tempo necessario per concludere il percorso di una singola mappa, tenderà a stremare il giocatore. Magari inizierete anche a sospettare un gusto masochista ed un odio verso il player da parte di Studio Evil...
Sessioni platforming circondate da lava, labirinti con fasci laser fatali e svariate trappole a trabocchetto nascoste in posti angusti.
Considerando i controlli non  fatti per movimenti di precisione (pad analogici sfruttati a 360°, e non semplicemente su otto direzioni), in alcuni frangenti il map designer pretenderà comunque rapidità e precisione di movimento o sparo. Pena la morte.
Quindi mappe sempre più letali, lunghe, complesse e che richiedono tempo... e rischio di doverle rifare una o più volte.
E vi ricordo che le mappe si resettano sempre!

- La MOLLA! L'esempio più lampante di gameplay snaturato.
Nell'idea originale non esisteva. La aggiunsero con l'oggettistica secondaria per arricchire le meccaniche originali.
Poi diventò un plus per raggiungere aree bonus, ma opzionali.
Ma col tempo è finita per diventare ESSENZIALE per proseguire nel gioco!
In tutto questo, il posto in cui procurarsi l'ESSENZIALE molla è passato dall'essere un randomico drop o negli store, all'essere uno ed univoco, ma NASCOSTO all'evidenza!
Cioè un elemento ESSENZIALE per proseguire, però da trovare o a caso... o su google.
Credo sia stato volutamente nascosto dietro a del ""non-sense"". Che avrebbe senso, ispirandosi a fumetti non-sense... Ma non-sense dovrebbe essere l'esito di un enigma, non l'enigma stesso.
Inoltre la molla introduce il platforming! E IMHO i controlli di SCMZ sono tutto fuorché adatti al platforming.

- Punitivo: nel mid-late game sbagliare significherà MORTE.
Ho già accennato a questa cosa precedentemente, ma IMHO, SCMZ dovrebbe essere indicato ad ogni utenza e famiglia (come i fumetti di Sio)... e non avrebbe dovuto rischiare di evolversi in un rage game.
Credo che i map designer abbiano sopravvalutato l'intrattenimento dato da una sfida impegnativa, ma eccessivamente punitiva.

Info spoiler sulla molla, ma non saperlo può NETTAMENTE compromettere ulteriormente la godibilità del gioco.
[spoiler]La molla si compra in FUMETTERIA! E quindi o decidete completamente a caso di ripararla... o lo cercate su google e farmate i croccantini necessari.[/spoiler]
Io personalmente non ho trovato indizi parlanti all'interno del gioco.
Ricordo che è un oggetto ESSENZIALE per proseguire.

PER CONCLUDERE

Sicuramente mi sono dimenticato di parlare di altri pregi o difetti.
Inoltre di esempi pratici potrei citarne ancora tanti altri.
Ma mi sono già dilungato abbastanza...

Si sarà capito che principalmente critico il fatto che gli sviluppatori si siano fatti scappare di mano il tasso di ""sfida"" e abbiano varcato la sottile linea che divide l'impegnativo dal frustrante.
Dopo le prime 6 ore, il gioco vi farà scemare pian piano la voglia di giocarci.

Anche come percezione personale, il gioco mi sembra sia davvero poco giocato fino in fondo dalla sua utenza.
Esempio lampante: persino l'achievement di morire 10 volte è un achievement non comune. Questo non significa che il gioco si possa facilmente finire senza morire 10 volte (improbabile), quando più che la gente ci si stufa prima ancora di morir 10 volte.",1563188160,1563188750,False,17,2,0.553012490272521973,1,False,False,False,False,,,

你也可以选择直接吃掉道具，吃掉道具会根据道具种类给你回复或扣除血量并给予buff。一般情况下你只有吃食物才能回血，但在特定情况也可以吃得下石头仙人掌盆栽这些看上去就不能吃的道具，游戏里更是有和吃相关的技能树，和获得“什么都能吃buff”的药水，[strike]是不是在说明吃的重要性？[/strike]道具种类给的buff只能同时存在两个，再多就清掉了，但谁会为了buff而只吃两种道具呢……

而且也很自由。开启寻找巫师的主线后，除了找到所有巫师才解锁的区域和2个需要狗粮购买的副本外，都有能力到达，出了泡泡塔滋后你基本上就放养了。除此之外，世界也会和你一样成长，每10级成长一次，提升掉落装备的等级和敌人强度。甚至世界的所有地方等级都同步的，只有攻击方式不同，更能说明上面那条：[b]太自由了[/b]
你在地图上跑图时，偶尔会看到闪闪发光的地方，那是你的属性在作怪，提示你这里靠近后会显示出蓝色箱子或者陷阱。除了这些，地图上也有[u]金箱子[/u]（必定获得橘色装备）和[u]电视机[/u]（增加技能点）：野生的金箱子需要你一顿操作才能拿到，遇到时甚至还不一定知道怎么拿；而电视机存在于副本分支或者隐藏的小区域，部分电视甚至需要动用技能树能力，一共有20台。
地图的副本，只要你击败里面的boss就可以离开。但你怎么到达就得需要解谜了：机遇森林有固定的走法不然会被踢出副本，熔岩烘培坊有两种不同颜色的线，雷射山修道院布满了高能量伤害的射线和需要回答问题的门，漫画世界需要在四本不同的漫画书里打败boss才会开放通往巫师那边的门，还有2个随机性强的小副本。

[b]既然提到了巫师，就不能不提技能树了。[/b]游戏一共有8个技能树，是完成智慧树和巫师以及某条支线任务的奖励。每条技能树对应的点都是不同的，除了纯增加实力的小点，还有大幅增加实力或增加玩法的大点。注意一下，除了智慧树点化的外星人，其他技能树都只能点一条路线，不过洗点也比较的简单，只需在泡泡塔兹右下角的一位npc花钱，就能重置所有技能点。虽然技能树可以增强角色实力和增加玩法，但如果一直卡任务而你升级又快，会导致技能点滞留，是设计的不太好的一点。
技能树所有角色互通，可以放心换在游戏里获得的角色，毕竟游戏里获得的角色比原有角色要强力许多，也更愿意将自尊点上去。

游戏里也有任务，最上面红色的部分为推动游戏剧情的主线任务，其他的姑且算作支线。不过这样想的话你会发现，大部分支线任务是为铺助主线任务而生: 大部分时间里，主线任务只是作为个提示，需要你在这时候做哪些支线任务，全部做完了后才能推动主线。
一般来说任务里都有提示你怎么做，如果提示模糊，就查找任务当前提示仔细想想该怎么做，甚至有任务的提示在其他任务里。[url=http://venbarak.lofter.com/post/1fefb542_1c61059d0]但如果真的卡关了，可以看这里[/url]

我只是来介绍游戏本身内容的，[b]要我评价的话，虽然这款游戏并没有达到优秀的标准，但质量还不错，喜欢沙雕游戏的玩家在游玩的时候会更容易会心一笑。如果打折了，可以试着购买来玩。[/b]

[b]最后我说一下我觉得需要添加或者优化的地方：[/b]
存档界面显示游戏难度，用于铺助下面的
网络联机gkd
多人模式可以添加机器人
更多支线，不要用来铺助主线任务
装备等级可以提升（可以不需要）
可选择副武器以方向键标准来行动（可以不需要）
主线完成后可以无限购买额外生命（可以不需要）

[h1]何“乱”？[/h1]
游戏的设定元素细节可以说是相当精化，就以可互动的物品这个例子来大体说明一下。概括来讲从种类类别即可将所有物品分为几大类：场景杂物类（石头、杂草等）、可开箱类（宝箱、铁柜等）、可食用类、三合一（道具、装备、武器）、货币类（火腿片和狗饼干）。而个别可食用类的物品也有着不尽相同的暂时buff加成及属性加成，一些特别物品还有着可破坏的特性以及各种天马行空的想象要素，其都可以看出制作者想法设法将趣味灵魂注入游戏中的用苦良心。

[h1]何“骚”？[/h1]
另外，游戏画风包括剧情萌贱萌贱的感觉在一定程度上都像极了《氰化物欢乐秀》，其简单且多样的人物塑造和美式极简的手绘画风给玩家一种莫名的休闲感，且在无关紧要的跨界聊天的几句内容中也时不时引出一堆无力反驳的槽点，搞笑？反讽？简直让人傻傻分不清。。。

遊戲的畫風就非常精奇，如果看過《氯化歡樂秀》的人想必壹定能明白這壹點：粗線勾勒全身的邊框，圓圓的大頭和接近方形的身子配上火柴人壹般壹條黑線的手腳。搭配上各種各樣的背景、怪物、機關道具……可以說怪異又精細。
劇情方面，據說這部作品是意大利漫畫的漫改，不過即使沒看過原作也沒有任何問題——遊戲的劇情和他的畫風壹樣非常不正經，比如彗星族的主角，比如相信狗和相信糖果的兩種流派的魔法，比如拿狗做法杖的魔法師，比如六巫師中有壹個除了是男的外沒有任何描述的和壹個教人學魚說話的……
遊戲性方面，這是壹款十分適合撕逼的小遊戲。玩家不但可以本地聯機闖關PVE，更可以在不同的地圖中PVP，如果日後有聯機多人模式那就更值得期待了。而即使妳不聯機自己闖關，遊戲的可玩性也十分之高。在故事模式中有著超過18位可操作角色供玩家解鎖使用，每個角色的技能特性也各不相同。除此之外，遊戲還提供了豐富的可收集的博物館道具、可以食用或者不能食用但是總之妳可以強行食用的道具、可以裝備的武器乃至多種技能樹……等等等等。
當然，最重要的還是投擲系統；妳可以抓起壹切能控制的東西，食物，鑰匙，箱子，炸彈，暈倒的敵人……然後把他們丟出去！這既可以用來對抗敵人，也可以用來重創被打殘的敵人，防止他們起身爆種。而除了丟出去外，妳也可以吃下各種各樣的東西，這些道具會給妳不同的BUFF和DEBUFF，例如吃掉燈妳會掉血但是可以發光，吃掉石頭……妳就只會掉血，吃掉炸彈妳會爆炸……等等，這種不斷試錯的過程也是壹大樂趣。這使得這款遊戲雖然打擊感稍遜，但是系統更為豐富。
總而言之，是壹款非常有趣，且很有潛力的小遊戲。

There isnt a lot to say about this game so i'll jump right into it

[h1]Story[/h1] 
Its mostly random comedy that I enjoyed for the most part and sometimes it felt forced and repeated but not too much so it was enjoyable, the dialogues are pretty entertaining and the game is doing good by keeping the comedy running with new twists along the way.

Your purpose is to find what you are, recall your memory and uncover the secrets of that very odd kingdom that you fell into.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This is a very entertaining game if you are going to play it with a couch party with friends and family, its also friendly for all ages so its fun to play with your kids or niece/nephews and its really hilarious with coop 

as for singleplayer I gotta say it fall short on so many aspects, the later levels are very large and has a lot of enemies, even with lower difficulty levels it still feels tedious, you'll often end up running to get to the next point because of the combat mechanics which im about to go in details right now.

What bothers me about the combat is that its depending on throwing mechanics more than slashing through with your weapons, almost every object in the game requires you to pick it up to interact with it 

You cannot break chests and boxes with your attack, you have to pick them up and throw them against the wall ...which is a very annoying feature to have in a game like this.

Enemies will fall unconscious after you deal enough damage and they become invulnerable so your two options are to wait for them to get back up or pick them up and throw them against another enemy or a wall, because like I said before the game depends too much on throwing mechanics 

They also deal significantly larger damage than normal attacks, with your special ability a ""SCREEE"" warcry that knocks enemies next to you down, so you can pick them up and ..you guessed it..throw them again at something.

it got tedious because with the amount of items you find you still deal less damage than throwing, I would have ignored all of that if I was able to open chests and loot stuff without having to pick them up and throw them, just slash through stuff with your sword like the weird hero you always are in video games like this

Leveling up gives you access to an odd skill tree that confused me with its description because its made in a comedy way which I generally appreciate but it failed to explain most of the things and I had to play further to understand whats happening.

There's a lot of different loot to find, weapons and armor and weird colorful pants or nifty looking hats, all granting special bonuses and stat boosts and the game offers a lot of that.

[h1]Details[/h1]
As you can clearly see in the screenshots that as hilarious and cartoony this game is, it offers some really good looking visuals to the world and characters, its very colorful and vivid and the details are fantastic

The sound effects are entertaining and adds more feeling to this beautifully hand-drawn game
World design i'd say is excellent, you unlock new paths which leads to new areas in the world map and making it easier to go to places via traveling.

The levels are large and filled with details all over, they made sure not to leave it empty, you got loot and enemies and obstacles placed evenly and I appreciate that.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
1 - Wonderful colorful world filled with secrets and things to explore.
2 - A plot filled with hilarious dialogues and keeps the comedy content coming.
3 - Ridiculously fun to play in couch coop with people, fun for all ages 
4 - Lots of levels to go to, quests and content.
5 - They have been updating and fixing the game's bugs and performance.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1 - The combat mechanic which focuses heavily on picking objects up and throwing them gets tedious especially if you're playing in singleplayer.
2 - I dare say the game is highly unoptimized, it ran on a ridiculously low FPS on my laptop that features a corei5, 8gb ram and gt635m 2gb card, which isnt impressive at all but for this type of game it should work fine, game ran fine on my desktop though because its made for heavy gaming though I am disappointed I had to use it for such game, the game takes waay too much ram and cpu usage as well, the loading times are too long for their own good.
3 - It feels like its running on slowmotion, I first thought its due to the low fps on my laptop but it was the same on my desktop despite having more than 200+ fps, its not a game error its a game design which im not a huge fan of, it just felt slow compared to how ridiculously large some levels were 
4 - video options being "" magic / not so magic""  which all edits vsync and other options on their own I dont like, kinda hoped there were more.
5 - The fact that they released this from early access and did not release an update made me a bit upset, you'd expect for a game to release out of early access with a giant update right ? nope, didnt happen only around 7 days later I think 
6 - no online co-op, this isnt really a con because some games are made to be played with friends local couch coop yeah but how many people out there have 8 friends laying around for this ?


[h1]TLDR[/h1]

Super Cane Magic ZERO is a very interesting type of game with impressive visuals and a hilarious story, offers a very decent amount of content for its price and is fun to play despite some flaws, ridiculously fun to play with friends in local coop in both the adventure or the 8 players arena mode.",1560427793,1560427816,True,11,0,0.594724476337432861,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Super Cane Magic ZERO. It's an arcade action game made by Sio & Studio Evil and published by Intragames. It features cartoon-style characters and is full of humor. The retro chiptune style soundtracks are also exciting. (It somewhat reminds me of BGMs in Pokémon 1st generation.) And this game not only supports single & multiplayer story mode, but also supports multiplayer arena mode. So it can be described as a friendly party game.

The game supports mouse, keyboard, and gamepad controls. Control key mapping is somewhat distracted, but players will be able to adapt gradually. The game has a mix of action and puzzle elements. The game play pace may seem a little slow, but cute cartoon graphics and humorous conversations make up for it. Boss battles are challenging, so it is recommended to adjust the difficulty or play with your friends. However, bosses usually have a certain attack pattern, so hardcore users for enjoying the extreme will be satisfied as well.

[h1]*Conclusion :[/h1]
Super Cane Magic ZERO. It was finally released officially after early access. If this game could support online multiplayer, it would be a great game that more users could enjoy. Of course, current single story mode and competition and co-op modes are also interesting enough. There are some shortcomings mentioned above, but not enough to ruin the game. The game is designed to be enjoyable with the light-hearted, and its (JPN/KOR/CN) translation quality is excellent. If you can afford it, do not hesitate to try this game. Recommended!

[h1]前言[/h1]

《Super Cane Magic ZERO》中文译为魔犬大骚乱，是一款画风有点像彩绘火柴人的单机合作角色扮演动作游戏。游戏的剧情带有一点点幽默感，就比如序章饶了一大个弯子居然阐述的结果是指魔法狗？游戏的画风非常的可爱，非常像是有了肉体的火柴人似的。游戏的背景音乐也是非常的魔性，但魔性又不失去游戏的节奏感。游戏不仅支持单人/多人剧情模式，还支持多人竞技模式，可谓是家庭派对游玩神器~

[h1]游戏体验[/h1]

[b][u]1️⃣游戏剧情：[/u][/b]
　　游戏的故事带有一点点的幽默叙述手段，这也正是我非常喜欢的一点，因为我个人也是一个比较幽默的人。很久很久以前，在一个叫“比勒费尔德”的遥远之地，住着一位来自巴黎的会计师——乔治。不过乔治和我们的故事一点关系也没有！（当时我看到这，我的内心是有无数只草泥马在奔腾，可以用一副土拨鼠的表情包来形容我）。

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763258954]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763258954[/url]

游戏故事发生在名为“花惹发”的魔法世界，几天前，蛋糕巫师的屋子里有一位法力高强但是又很滑稽的蛋糕巫师，他懂很多很多的咒语，比如让蛋糕凭空出现（这算哪门子咒语……）。但是不幸的是，一天他在吃蛋糕沙拉的时候，打了个喷嚏，跌倒在地上，然后就GG了。这一幕正好被他的爱狗看见，神奇的事情就这么发生了，这只狗不知道是不是得到了巫师的真传，变成了一只魔法狗。只要狗狗怪叫，就会有许多灾难发生，现在正处于魔法狗到处捣乱的动荡乱世中，谁能阻止这只魔法狗狗呢？

[b][u]2️⃣游戏玩法：[/u][/b]
　　游戏中的指引是以广告牌的形式展现给玩家，玩家可以靠近广告牌然后点击鼠标右键就能进行互动。游戏的操作基本上只需要空格、鼠标就能完成，因为鼠标右键可以进行事物的互动，比如吃、人物互动等等，左键则是进行投掷和攻击，空格进行冲刺等。游戏主要有两大要素，一是动作要素，游戏提供给玩家许多挑战Boss，每个Boss都会有多中不同的攻击，但是基本上攻击都是可以躲避的，内涵了弹幕玩法和回合制玩法。二是解谜要素，游戏中有许多机关和隐藏地点，这些机关一般都是一环扣一环，比如最简单的按钮开门机关，必须有重物在上面才能打开某一扇门，如果你是多人游玩还好，有时候可以让你的队友去踩住机关另一人去拿东西即可，当然单人也不需要怕，只是稍稍麻烦点而已，单人的时候一般这种机关的附近都有重物，你只需要拿取重物放在上面即可。值得注意的是身上拿着道具的时候是不能冲刺的。

　　游戏中你可以通过打碎箱子获取里面的道具，有的道具是伤害型道具，有的道具是增益型道具，道具只能通过外观辨别，并不会提示用途，而装备就不一样了，角色离近了可以看到道具的属性，这应该是开发商故意这样做的，当多人游玩的时候更容易撕逼。

　　游戏还有类似于天赋系统的设定，这个需要玩家打败大树Boss之后才能解锁，最高等级100级，可以看出天赋系统还是非常丰富的。

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763212726]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763212726[/url]

[b][u]3️⃣游戏画风：[/u][/b]
　　游戏人物的画风非常像是有了肉体的火柴人，蠢蠢的动态人物。场景的色调比较丰富，对于暗世界和白天世界绘制的非常的鲜明。

💔 冲刺的方向希望不要跟随鼠标，而是跟随按键

장점

1. 가격에 비해 꽉찬 컨텐츠. 가격도 가격이거니와 별 기대 안하고 샀는데 생각보다 많은 퀘스트, 넓은 맵의 규모에 놀랐습니다.

2. 나름의 메인 스토리가 있습니다. 뭐 병맛코드가 많고 딱히 심도 깊게 몰입할만한 스토리는 아니나, 큰 줄기는 있고

   그에 대한 동기부여도 있습니다.

3. 다양한 종류의 아이템 + 같은 아이템임에도 등급에 따라 성능이 달라져서 파밍하는 맛이 있습니다.

4. 다양한 캐릭터를 육성하는 재미. 캐릭터의 해금 조건은 쉬운 녀석, 어려운 녀석 다양하게 있습니다.

5. 게임 플레이에 있어서의 자유도가 높은 편입니다. 마치 젤다의 전설 야생의 숨결의 맛보기 느낌 정도입니다.

  정공법으로 두들겨 패서 잡을 수도 있고, 다양한 사물을 이용해서 잡을 수 있으며 지형을 이용해서 잡을 수도 있습니다.

6. 맵을 진행하는데 있어서의 맵 디자인 난이도(퍼즐 난이도)가 딱 적절하게 배정된 느낌입니다. 너무 쉽지 않게, 그렇다고

   너무 어려워서 때려치지 않게 끔. 퀘스트 추리부분과도 이어지는데 퀘스트도 극소수의 몇몇 퀘스트 뺴고는 충분히

   단서를 주기 때문에 추리해서 충분히 클리어가 가능합니다. 와우 오리지널 시절의 퀘스트 지문 읽고 추리해서 퀘스트

   꺠는 그런 맛을 유사하게 나마 느낄 수 있습니다.

7. 죽음에 대한 패널티가 약한 편이라 라이트하게 가벼운 마음으로 즐기 실 수 있습니다. 물론 그렇다 해도 최고 난이도로

   플레이 할시 충분히 하드코어한 난이도 입니다.

단점

1. 스킬 포인트에 대한 아쉬움. 분명 수많은 트리, 수많은 패시브 스킬이 나열되어 있어 성장하는 맛은 있으나 실상 자세히보면

   같은 종류 울궈먹은 패시브 종류가 많습니다. 또한 스킬 포인트로 찍는 모든 스킬은 다 패시브 뿐이라 뭔가 

   레벨업시 ""나 드라마틱하게 강력해 졌어!""라고 할게 없습니다.

2. 고등급의 템이 나와도 실상 꼴랑 스탯 몇만 더 붙은 식이 많아서 보라템이 나와도 엄청난 감흥이 없는 경우가 왕왕 있습니다.

   으레 보라 등급 이상 템만 나와도 그 희열감이 있어야 하는데요. 물론 주황 등급 템들은 그만한 가치가 있습니다.

3. 여러 불편하고 불친절한 면들. 이 부분에 대해서는 여러 가지 얘기할 게 많습니다.

   - 내가 걸린 해당 버프 상태에 대한 설명이 너무 부실한 점

   - 웨이 포인트가 너무 한정적인 점

   - 게임 중 후반부로 갈수록 한 맵의 덩치가 커지면서 기믹이 복잡해지는데, 그 중간에 저장되는 요소가 단 하나도 없습니다.

     그래서 중간에 게임을 끄고 싶다거나 템이 다 차서 마을 가서 정리를 하고 싶어도 억지로 그 파트를 다 완료해야 한다는

     압박감.

   - 제일 짜증 났던 부분으로 포켓몬 게임 시리즈의 비전 머신과 같은 이 게임에 있어서 정말 중요한 아이템이 있는데,

     그 아이템이 무슨 조건을 만족해서 어디서 얻을 수 있는지에 대한 정보가 일체 없으면서, 스토리 중후반부 진행에

     있어서 저 아이템이 없으면 진행이 불가능합니다. 그래서 강제 노가다를 해야 하는 구간이 생길 수도 있습니다.

4. 치명적인 버그가 몇몇 존재합니다. 월드 맵으로 나가야만 해결되는 상황들이 왕왕 있습니다. 문제는 위에 언급했듯이

   맵의 스케일이 커지면서 기껏 많이 진행 해놨는데, 내가 지금까지 해당 맵에서 진행한 정도를 1도 저장시키는것도 없으면서

   버그로 강제로 나가서 다시 처음부터 하려면 화딱지가 납니다.



아무리 갓겜도 단점이 있는 법이니, 총평 하자면 저 단점들에도 불구하고 가성비가 매우 훌륭한 잘 만들어진 수작 RPG 게임.

Este título é nos apresentado pelo estúdio Indie Italiano, Studio Evil e conta com a parceria do artista Sio, também ele italiano, que se encarregou pela parte visual do jogo.  

O mundo de WOTF está em perigo! O feiticeiro Cake morreu e o seu cão AAAH!, herdou os seus poderes tornando-se assim o cão mais poderoso da galáxia. 

O jogador é desafiado a explorar um mundo francamente generoso em termos de tamanho e cheio de segredos por desvendar, como 15 personagens jogáveis! Todas elas com diferentes habilidades e status iniciais bem como classes que vão desde o feiticeiro ao cavaleiro (em termos redondos).  

Assim, com esta deixa o jogador entra em ação podendo aventurar-se pelas perigosas colinas de Minestronya como Dude, um padeiro com o poder do bacon, com a Dudette uma canalizadora imparável! Poderá ser incrível como o Dudorah, o influenciador, ou simplesmente ser o Dudward, o feiticeiro dos doces. 

Mas … comédia? Além da possibilidade de comer tudo o que encontrar desde pedras, latas de comida, fruta, um elemento interessante em Super Cane Magic Zero é a variedade de formas que existem para trucidar os inimigos. É possível atirar banana-boomerangs, lutar com uma batata gigante ou simplesmente agarrar os inimigos e atirá-los a uma parede de espinhos, para a lava ou até mesmo na direção de outros inimigos. O combate em si é bastante acessível e não exige grande estratégia para ser superado. À medida que o jogador sobe de nível são dados pontos de habilidade que podem ser aplicados numa extensa árvore de habilidades, possibilitando desta maneira melhorar o status da personagem e até mesmo invocar meteoros como habilidade especial. 

Para juntar a esta salada de barrigas de riso, as linhas de fala por vezes são tão hilariantes como sem sentido. Como em todos os bons RPG, existem as missões principais e as missões secundárias que dão a possibilidade de desbloquear novas habilidades e armas ao longo da viagem. 

Uma das principais mecânicas do jogo é a capacidade de comer bem… praticamente tudo. Boa parte destes “alimentos” concedem benefícios de dieta ou Diet Perks. Comer frutas e legumes aumenta o ataque da personagem, comer doces aumenta a regeneração de mana. No entanto, é importante manter a atenção porque certos itens podem fazer descer a barra de vida ou dar um debuff ao jogador, como por exemplo, dar menos dano aos inimigos. 

A premissa estranha do jogo assenta toda ela no “think outside of the box”, o jogo nunca se leva a sério e numa altura que o mais importante para alguns jogadores são os gráficos, este por outro lado aponta para uma arte bastante peculiar, conseguindo misturar formas de inimigos que vão desde pés gigantes a animais voadores. A combinação de histórias no verdadeiro sentido da palavra, malucas, personagens excêntricas, loot drops hilariantes, nomes de habilidades curiosos e excelentes inimigos criam uma experiência única apesar der assentar num género de jogo bastante familiar. Sendo este talvez mais amigável para crianças e bastante descontraído não dá a sensação de ser demasiado intenso em termos de loot e dificuldade para ultrapassar os diversos níveis disponíveis. 

Super Cane Magic Zero é definitivamente um jogo pensado para jogar com amigos considerando que tem dois modos de jogos, o modo de História e o modo Arena. Se, por ventura o jogador se sentir farto do modo de história, pode sempre mudar para o modo Arena e jogar num modo de jogo frenético e cheio de ação utilizando as personagens até então desbloqueadas. Este é um título pensado para todas as idades e para ser jogado tanto sozinho como acompanhado, que de certo irá fazer a delícia de uma barriga sedentária e pô-la a trabalhar nos abdominais de tanto rir.

[h1]战斗机制[/h1]
游戏中玩家的主要攻击方式是使用手中的武器攻击敌人，武器有不同的等级加成，但是游戏中最有效的攻击方式是捡取游戏场景中的物品然后砸向敌人，更具举起物品的不同，对敌人造成的伤害也不一。被砸晕的敌人也可以被玩家举起来砸向地面或者墙壁，造成伤害。

PS：这里有一个小发现，玩家如果投掷出去的是香蕉，这个香蕉可以当做回力飞镖，还是可以飞回来的，而且会对玩家造成伤害。

[h1]可破坏的箱子[/h1]
游戏中有些宝箱需要玩家捡起来之后砸向墙壁或者地面来获取里面的物品。当然这些箱子也可以直接在向敌人，造成伤害的同时也可以击碎宝箱。

[h1]吞食机制[/h1]
游戏中举起事物后长按鼠标右键可以吞食物品，游戏中啥都能吃，但是能回血的只有食物，玩家千万不要把炸弹给吃了，不然自爆直接GG。有些特使的物品使用后还有特殊效果，比如吃了灯泡之后，玩家就可以自己发光啦！！！

[h1]总结[/h1]
游戏的玩法非常欢快且多样，物品道具大多样性导致游戏可以有很多不同的玩法，有些道具还有特殊的性能，可见制作组脑洞之大。游戏由中文，翻译的还不错。游戏如果只是单人玩耍的话，时间久了还是会略显无聊，游戏还是适合多人联机的那种，此外游戏的优化不是非常好，可能是游戏场景中涉及到的互动对象太多了了，时不时会卡顿一下，非常影响手感。",1559734871,1569604425,True,5,0,0.541426777839660645,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Gameplay variegato e innovativo, un sacco di cose da fare.
- Un approccio al genere RPG differente dal solito.
- Dialoghi e storia fuori di testa.
- Enigmi divertenti da affrontare.
- Alcuni scontri con i ""boss"" sono davvero esaltanti.
- Ti fa venir voglia di finirlo!

CONTRO:
- Avrei apprezzato uno sforzo in più sotto l'aspetto visivo. Mi sa un po' di occasione persa a causa di uno stile grafico davvero troppo minimalista.
- Manca un tutorial approfondito. Non ho ancora capito come usare gli oggetti rapidi e ho notato che premendo la barra spaziatrice ""succede qualcosa"", ma non so esattamente cosa .
- A volte mi capita di perdere di vista il cursore del mouse che è necessario per mirare i nemici. Dovrebbe essere ben più più visibile!
- Il gioco in fullscreen non si sovrappone alla barra di Windows e capita che, nella frenesia dei combattimenti si clicchi fuori dallo schermo (sopratutto a chi tiene la barra da un lato) con la conseguenza di uscire involontariamente dal gioco mentre si continuano a prendere mazzate.

有趣！
Super Cane Magic ZERO 是一款带有动作要素的角色扮演游戏，它的画风十分搞怪，人物动态也十分逗趣。看得出，作者是花了很多心思在各种设计和制作上的，不仅在界面风格上保持高度统一，而且到处都能找到一些小彩蛋来博人一笑。

吃吃吃 与 扔扔扔
游戏的核心系统是与道具的互动，既有动作要素也有解谜要素。你可以将碰到的大部分物体举起来，然后选择扔出去——或者吃进嘴里。不管是战斗还是解密的过程都是需要这些基本操作的，拿起的武器可以攻击，用重物压住按钮来解开机关等等。这个系统的自由度与扩展性都十分优秀，因此可以期待在后续的继续制作中会添加更多内容。

当然，将传统的RPG中的道具操作分解开来，好处是上面所讲的自由度和扩展性，而坏处则是会影响使用道具的速度，让游戏过程中有时会觉得使用道具十分费劲（拾取->准备投掷->瞄准->松手），毕竟设计都是有利有弊的。

另外，虽然什么东西都能吃这个设计很有趣，但是目前似乎并没有很多有关这个的配套设计。大部分东西都要玩家自己尝试是正面还是负面，吃下去也仅仅是对玩家的属性造成影响。希望之后可以对这一系统做出更多的扩展内容（比如特殊角色可以将物品转化、吐出之类的）。



总而言之，这是一款风格独特清新可爱的动作冒险游戏，以后仍然有更大的发展潜力。",1518588909,1518588909,True,3,0,0.465217858552932739,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Empezamos Super Cane Magic ZERO cuando nuestro personaje se halla en el medio de un cráter de caramelo (la razón, la dejaremos de sorpresa para no hacer spoilers), cuando la policía llega a apresarnos por el simple motivo de ''causar disturbios con un cráter''. De ahí, somos llevados a una cárcel de apariencia espacial, donde aprenderemos sobre las mecánicas del título mientras tratamos de salir de la nave carcelaria.

En todo el embrollo y desmadre que conlleva el inicio de la historia, la trama nos pondrá como salvadores del universo, y debemos poner fin al caos que se ha suscitado tras los eventos iniciales que nos fueron narrados al comienzo del juego.

EL inventario, cosas por comer, unas hace daño otras no, podemos encontrar ropa a lo largo de la partida que dependiendo del tipo, nos dará puntos extra en nuestras habilidades. Por ejemplo la siempre confiable Falta Punteada de Polka, nos da 20 puntos extra de mana, y 6 puntos extra de Defensa Física, al igual que ropa, hay objetos que podemos 'vestir', el Cono (un sombrero) aporta 20 puntos extra de HP, y 6 puntos de Defensa Física también.

Los objetos son muy variados, y equiparlos cambia la apariencia del personaje, lo cual es realmente llamativo y hasta irrisorio dependiendo de lo que escojamos, pues podemos crear nuestra propias combinaciones de ropa (al menos por la diversión), más allá de los atributos extra que estos nos den.

Con respecto a nuestro personaje, el elemento de RPG nos permite gastar puntos de habilidad, estos son llamados ''Puntos de Creencia"", los cuales sirven para desbloquear habilidades como meteoritos que caerán del cielo en nuestra ayuda, o algunos que nos otorgan mejoras de habilidades y estadísticas por algún tiempo, entre otras.

La forma de avanzar entre niveles es muy parecida a Casle Crashers, donde tras finalizar cada nivel, salimos a un mapa donde nos movemos hacia la siguiente pantalla. Con la diferencia que en Super Cane Magic ZERO nos movemos entre mundos, que contienen distintos calabozos en los cuales debemos realizar una serie de misiones para poder avanzar al siguiente mundo del juego; y es algo que lleva bastante tiempo.

Lleva tiempo porque cada mundo tiene distintos desafíos aparte de seguir la trama, por ejemplo, en el primero de los mundos del juego, hay un museo, al cual podemos aportar objetos con tal de ayudar a que el museo vuelva a ser lo que era antes, algo parecido a Stardew Valley, donde recolectamos objetos extraños y los donamos a la biblioteca a cambio de recompensas. Por otro lado, podemos ayudar a los ciudadanos del pueblo a reconstruir sus negocios mediante monedas que ganamos en las mazmorras, hay muchas cosas por hacer y eso es lo mejor de Super Cane Magic ZERO.

Nuestra primer misión fue encontrar a un perdido Profesor Biscocho, quien se aventuro en un viaje épico digno de un bizcocho, con el objetivo de dar con el libro de recetas final. En esta primera aventura toparemos con el primer Jefe (quien nos ataca acompañado de 2 secuaces), en el cual morimos 4 veces, es difícil, pero deja de serlo una vez hallamos como hacerle daño sin que su ametralladora nos hiciera añicos.

La jugabilidad es sencilla, nos movemos con el stick izquierdo, apuntamos con el stick derecho y con los botones L1/R1 realizamos ataques con las armas que llevemos equipadas. Por todo el nivel se encuentran cajas, cofres, barriles, que cuando los azotamos contra alguna pared, nos darán loot, este contiene objetos y comida, la comida es un arma de doble filo, pues cualquier cosa puede parecer inofensiva, y en realidad, podría bajarnos la vitalidad, envenenarnos, e incluso, hacernos explotar.

Técnicamente, Super Cane Magic ZERO tiene muy pocos fallos, quizás el más palpable es la caída de FPS cuando hay muchos enemigos en la pantalla. Otra cosa que no nos gusto -y que no es un fallo técnico, es la música, si bien la banda sonora no es mala, podrá haber sido mejor, pues llega un punto en el cual, es incluso molesta.

Con todo resumido, Super Cane Magic ZERO logra sacarnos una sonrisa en cada dialogo, los personajes y los escenarios hechos totalmente a mano resultan una formula muy bien realizada para los fines de un título pasable, que ofrece muchas horas de diversión con hasta 15 personajes jugables (habrá que desbloquear la mayoría). El juego tiene un precio de $20 USD y se puede jugar con hasta 4 amigos de manera local, con soporte total para mandos.

简评：

+ 优秀的游戏创意与设计

+ 幽默的对话

- 互动对象反馈不明显

- 难度设计略高

总评 7/10，设计很新颖，就是难度略高、且部分内容对新手不太友好。且期待更多BGM。

  《Super Cane Magic Zero》简单来说就是主角接了个要去消灭巫妖王的任务。这款游戏的卖点在于游戏里“所有东西（只要你能拿起来的）你都可以吃”。听起来很酷，玩起来很心痛。拿起东西后，如果是食物吃了有加成，如果不是食物会掉血等。不过这个是否能吃，判断很模糊，只有按下吃（右键）的一两秒才会不明显地提示你这个不能吃（角色头附近闪动几个竖线），以至于一开始玩不知道什么能吃、什么不能吃，不断被坑。

    游戏中用了许多有趣的对话，以及一些英语梗，还是让人忍俊不禁的。剧情也很好玩，比如一开始教程的BOSS-骷髅君，主角以为他就是巫妖王，打败后才发现弄错了，人家只是一个安分守己的好骷髅！

    不过令人遗憾的是游戏一些互动实在不明显，比如在自动贩卖机买东西没有按键提示，也没有货币提示等，让人摸不着头脑。又比如在村长雇佣了几个雇佣兵，但是之后也没有跟着主角，也让我很疑惑。

    并且是不是开发者以为所有人都会找许多雇佣兵，单打独斗的游戏难度还是挺大的，一个地图的怪都是联动的，往往刚走进一块区域十几二十个怪物就飞奔而来，被群殴。

    总的来说，这款游戏如果是原价的话，不是很推荐直接入手。若半价左右可以尝试一下，开发者在剧情方面设置还是很用心的，就是游戏性略微不足，也许多人联机可能更加有趣，我的评测是单打独斗。

-Aggiungete 1-2 armi rare e particolari, come spargitori di liquidi/esplosivi
-Vi prego: date degli effetti più diversi ad armature/scudi perché alla lunga sono tutti quasi uguali
-Mettete delle stanze difficilissime da trovare come una forgia per aggiungere o togliere modificatori agli oggetti
-Aggiungete uno slot dove, raccolta una pozione, può essere usata premendo un tasto
-risolvete il crash che si ha quando si preme tab

[b]Lo que opinó Él:[/b]

En el Super Cane Magic ZERO eres un personaje que puede agarrar cosas y aventarlas, y así es como principalmente matas a los enemigos. Tienes espadas y cosas así también, pero encuentro más divertido la manera de aventarles cosas y luego aventar a los malos a la lava o a las paredes.

[b]Lo que opinó Ella:[/b]

El juego tiene gráficas súper adorables, música adictiva y lo mejor es que es RPG o juego de rol en donde puedes subir de nivel a tu personaje. Todo esto mezclado con un humor muy curioso.

Si presenta subito bene, con una colonna sonora che mette allegria e che introduce nel mondo bidimensionale, ironico e assurdo di Sio. Il gioco è carino e coccoloso all'apparenza, ma prensenta una difficoltà buona già a livello medio (forse sono io che sono scarso, non so), che darà del filo da torcere ai giocatori, con assalti da parte di nemici diversi, tutti con i loro attacchi caratteristici e tutti potenzialmente letali.
Geniale il sistema delle credenze, che deve forse essere sviluppato ulteriormente, ma già il fatto che ogni personaggio giocabile abbia delle peculiarità (es. un personaggio non può nuotare nell'acqua perchè crede che l'acqua sia veleno, chi conosce Sio saprà di chi sto parlando) lo trovo un ottimo modo per caratterizzare meglio i personaggi, che per il momento non hanno molte opportunità di mettere in mostra la loro natura assurda, tipica nei fumetti, ma che spero verrà aggiunta nella versione definitiva.
Il sistema di combattimento è molto lineare, ma non banale, bisona stare attenti a ciò che si usa e a dove si lanciano i nemici storditi, perchè ci potrebbero essere delle sorprese inaspettate.
Nel complesso un gioco fatto bene, anche se ancora migliorabile. Buono il level up con alberi delle abiltà, ma sarebbe bello poter diversificare i personaggi singolarmente (es. Coso specializzato nelle origini siderali, mentre Cosa specializzata in canemanzia, o viceversa a seconda dei gusti o delle esigenze) così da permettere al giocatore di creare un party vario ed interessante, anche se l'inserimento di un NPC che resetta le credenze è già un bel passo avanti.
Non rimane molto altro da aggiungere, aspetto con molta speranza la modalità storia che sicuramente ci farà assaporare ancora meglio la comicità di Sio.
Lo consiglio assolutamente a chi vuole farsi quattro risate, anche in compagnia perchè c'è il multiplayer, avendo comunque un gioco interessante. P.s. avere un controller compatibile con il computer (Xbox) è consigliato, perchè l'esperienza di gioco è molto migliore.
Vi suggerirei di seguire e rivedere i fumetti (su Facebook) e i video (su Youtube) di Sio per avere una maggiore comprensione di questo mondo e per capire meglio le infinite autocitazioni, il mio esempio preferito è il budino-vulcano, striscia che mi ha fatto molto ridere su Facebook e che ho adorato ritrovare come nemico nella modalità sfida.",1472131931,1472131931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

[i]RPG, humour, aspect cartoon, co-op, la recette de ce Super Cane Magic ZERO semble bien alléchante ! Seulement voilà, on commence à devenir méfiants avec les accès anticipés et avec un jeu prometteur comme celui-ci la méfiance est d'autant plus de mise que la déception serait grande si le développement n'atteignait pas son but. Et voilà le dilemme : soutenir un jeu pour l'aider ou rester sceptique et attendre sa sortie officielle au risque que cela ne se produise jamais si personne n'apporte de contribution financière au projet. Avec tous ses atouts et ses promesses Super Cane Magic Zero n'échappe pas à la règle et j'espère pouvoir vous éclairer quelque peu afin que vous puissiez juger si le jeu mérite ou non votre soutien.[/i]

Actuellement complet à 40% [au 19/03/16], Super Cane Magic ZERO devra à terme comporter trois modes de jeu : [list]
[*] [b]Story mode[/b] : un mode histoire s'articulant en 7 chapitres, chacun d'eux se déroulant dans un nouvel environnement. Ce mode sera jouable seul ou en coopération locale (1-4 joueurs), il est toujours en développement à ce jour.
[*] [b]Challenge mode[/b] : seul ou en co-op, ce mode est déjà en partie accessible et comporte des niveaux générés de manière procédurale où le but est de venir à bout de tous les ennemis en présence.
[*] [b]Arena mode[/b] : de 2 à 4 joueurs, ce mode propose comme son nom l'indique du PvP. Il existe trois arènes différentes pour l'instant.[/list]
Penchons-nous donc sur ce que nous avons à disposition. Le challenge mode propose d'accéder à des niveaux se déroulant dans des cryptes, des donjons, des volcans ou encore des plaines verdoyantes. On découvre un univers loufoque, coloré, clairement destiné à être pris sur le ton de l'humour avec ses personnages aux trollfaces, sa musique sous amphét' et ses objets délirants.

Cependant, ces maps générées de manière procédurale manquent clairement d'inspiration. On se retrouve à effectuer les mêmes tâches à chaque nouvelle salle que comporte le donjon : on entre, on tabasse 2-3 ennemis, on actionne un levier ou une dalle et puis hop, salle suivante. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648339948 Malgré l'univers jovial, les graphismes rigolos et colorés, le capital sympathie du jeu, on se retrouve assez rapidement plongés dans l'ennui de par la répétitivité des actions à effectuer et du manque de surprise que réserve le level design. 

Les combats ne viennent pas briser notre ennui car ils se basent sur une mécanique de jeu qui n'est pas sans lourdeur. Une fois à terre après quelques coups, les ennemis se relèvent si on ne les a pas attrapés à temps pour les jeter contre un mur ou dans un puits de lave. On peut toujours s'entêter à les frapper, on en viendra à bout mais ce sera plus long et laborieux. Chacun des personnages que l'on peut incarner -quatre personnages de base, on peut en débloquer huit de plus- possède une capacité spéciale différente (zone de soin, zone de dégâts...) que l'on peut activer après avoir mangé une ""charge"" lootée sur le niveau ou achetée dans le HUB au début du level. 

On peut d'ailleurs manger pas mal de choses, à peu près tout ce que l'on ramasse en fait, cependant attention aux conséquences ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648340018 Il existe beaucoup d'objets différents mais, mis à part quelques exceptions comme la banane qui fait boomerang ou la gameboy qui passe le jeu en style retro, tous les objets ont un comportement similaire (fruit, bonbon = santé reboostée; rocher, bombe = santé qui morfle). Logique. Oui mais parfois on a aussi droit à quelques surprises telles des croissants explosifs si bien qu'on est jamais trop sûr de ce qu'on peut faire avec un objet, à moins de tester à ses risques et périls. Ce n'est pas mauvais en soi, cela ajoute une part de découverte au jeu, il serait simplement plus intéressant d'ajouter des comportements différents plutôt que de créer des tonnes d'objets n'ayant pas plus d'intérêt les uns que les autres (plus d'une centaine sont présentement disponibles en jeu, c'est cool mais concentrez-vous sur autre choses les gars, pour le moment ce n'est pas le plus important).

Justement, il faudrait se concentrer sur un point central du titre : le côté RPG. Pour le moment c'est très flou, on a accès à des statistiques, on les voit, elles sont là mais rien n'indique leur utilité ou leur importance. Autant certaines données sont évidentes et ne posent pas de problème (throw damage, walk speed), autant d'autres statistiques sont beaucoup plus originales et restent obscures à notre compréhension (buttluck?, being cool?). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648666424 A cela s'ajoute le fait que l'on a absolument aucune idée de la signification du chiffre apposé à côté de ces stats. Quels sont ces icônes en bas à droite de notre inventaire ? Comment gagner en expérience ? Comment ramasser des potions sans les consommer ? Les questions restent très nombreuses et c'est là un aspect primordial du jeu qui n'en est qu'à ses balbutiements. Toutes ces données présagent au moins d'une chose : l'ambition de faire un jeu riche est bien présente.

Au final, on a ici droit à une version preview en demi-teinte, Super Cane Magic ZERO nécessitant encore un énorme travail de fond pour être pleinement apprécié. Et le potentiel est clairement là. Comme je l'ai déjà évoqué, les graphismes sont très sympathiques, la direction artistique est tout a fait cohérente et la musique du jeu est entêtante et dynamique. Il ne reste qu'à espérer que le mode histoire sera riche et intéressant, que le level design fera preuve de plus d'inspiration et que l'aspect RPG du titre répondra à nos attentes. Seul ou à plusieurs, le jeu a clairement toutes les cartes en main pour procurer son lot de fun et de fous rires si les développeurs parviennent à aller au bout de leurs objectifs, on croise les doigts !

游戏的核心就是投掷，这里面的所有道具都能投掷也必须投掷。游戏中的按压机关要扔将道具扔到机关上才能触发；宝箱必须往墙上扔才能砸开；打怪物一样如此，先用将怪物打晕，然后用晕了的怪物扔到墙上或者砸向其他怪物造成高伤害（也可以用武器，我用一把小剑砍一下怪物6点伤害，而我用怪物砸会造成20点伤害）

模式目前有挑战模式（现在主要玩的就是这个模式，类似故事模式的样本），竞技场模式（玩家PVP），故事模式（尚未开放，那你放在菜单栏什么鬼）

目前只有本地合作，所有模式都支持最多4人合作

Sono un giocatore di Binding of Isaac e questo gioco lo ha letteralmente sostituito, per la maggiore chiarezza nel design e negli effetti grafici, le possibilità di gioco, la comicità, e la bellezza e varietà dei disegni.
Infatti questo gioco oltre ad essere spassoso e a farmi ridere di gusto durante le partite si è rivelato ricco di possibilità per il personaggio: si può puntare sui danni nel tempo di un ghiacciolo alla lava, lanciare oggetti con forza titanica, utilizzare spade a forma di piede per colpire con forza i nemici in mischia o utilizzare cannoni spara-carote per attaccare a distanza.

L' early access di questo gioco è costoso ma ne vale la pena per quello che sta promettendo, caldamente consigliato per tutti coloro che cercano un gioco che può essere difficile ma anche casual e divertire.

Al momento in cui leggete non l'ho ancora finito ma sinceramente non credo nemmeno che lo finirò. Mi spiego meglio. Questo capitolo della storia in pratica sfrutta la stessa tipologia di mappa dell'altra modalità giocabile in solitaria e di fatto come trama ha l'aggiunta di piccolissimi intermezzi fatti con video di Sio. Ci sono anche personaggi nuovi creati appositamente per la storia come altri più famosi come l'albero saggio. Il problema vero e proprio è che di fatto giocare la modalità storia non aggiunge nulla di nuovo al gameplay che quindi se non vi piace da quando è in early access non vi farà cambiare idea. Rimango sempre i soliti difetti: per giocarlo in co-op vi serve almeno un gamepad per il secondo giocatore; a mio parere il gioco si gioca meglio con mouse e tastiera e di conseguenza è vantaggio sfidare gli amici usando queste periferiche; l'italiano ""rimescolato"" di Sio va bene per il gameplay ma non va assolutamente bene per i menu e le spiegazioni delle meccaniche di gioco; il gioco è molto ripetitivo perchè nonostante ci siano diversi oggetti in game il tutto si riduce a colpire il nemico, lanciare oggetti e tirare leve.
Sinceramente dopo un attesa molto lunga questo capitolo non mi convince affatto e ad oggi il gioco non vale il prezzo pieno.

It's kind of hard to explain what type of game Super Cane Magic ZERO is. It's kind of like a top down RPG since you can gather armor and other items to equip. The game also kind of plays like an action game where you and your buddies run around the screen throwing items at the enemies trying to kill them. 

At this time the game is kind of early in development, lacking some of the features of the final game including the campaign. The game does already shows promise though. For some reason it is fun just to run around the screen throwing random items at enemies. The game already looks like it will be a fun multiplayer experience. I am interested in seeing what the game ends up doing with the campaign mode since the artwork is already quirky and I think the game could be funny if enough time is put into the game's story.

Note: I received a free review copy of Super Cane Magic ZERO. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review and receiving the free copy had no effect on the contents of this review.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMK5n28s-0

Iniziamo subito dicendo che il gioco è interessante ma 20 euro ora che è in Early Access, per quello che offre, sono davvero troppi (ok sì, in questo momento è scontato del 10% e sta a 18€, ma il discorso non cambia per niente).

Super Cane Magic Zero è un GDR sviluppato da Studio Evil con la collaborazione del famoso Sio - noto disegnatore italiano che probabilmente conoscerete tramite il suo canale YouTube ""Scottecs"" - per il comparto grafico. Insomma, un nonsense generale.

Per quello che abbiamo provato il gioco è da dire che ha potenzialmente tutte le carte in tavola per diventare un buon prodotto: si tratta di un action RPG dall'alto con fortissima ironia, nonsense, audio di buona qualità e colonna sonora accattivante - seppur in perfetta sintonia con il contesto demenziale - (sì, con somma gioia ci sono anche brani Heavy!) e una pulitissima grafica 2D. 
Il gameplay è divertente e a dispetto delle apparenze è molto impegnativo: sono presenti in gran numero armi, armature, oggetti vari (alcuni dei quali non abbiamo capito a che servono) che potrete o lanciare - lo stesso per i nemici, con vostra enorme soddisfazione - o mangiare per ricaricare energia (o perderla, dipende), ottenere power up ecc.

Wow! So brutal!

Nei momenti più concitati con tanti nemici sullo schermo, il gioco sembra soffrire d'asma offrendo eleganti rallentamenti dovuti ad un'ottimizzazione su cui c'è evidentemente molto da lavorare (un gioco 2d che scende sotto i 10 FPS mentre stiamo registrando ha davvero qualcosa che non va). 
Orgogliosi di mostrarsi all'utente finale, sono presenti anche diversi bug e come ciliegina sulla torta, il sistema di controllo a volte risulta impreciso, testimoniando la necessità di rifiniture che, state tranquilli, arriveranno: stiamo parlando della versione ad Accesso Anticipato. 

Si tratta di problemi assolutamente risolvibili, tanto che sono già uscite delle patch che dovrebbero risolvere alcuni dei bug più comuni. 

L'unica nota dolente, almeno al momento, è il prezzo. La versione attuale presenta solo due modalità giocabili:
-""Sfida"" in cui dovrete esplorare dei dungeon cercando di sopravvivere e sconfiggere il boss finale;
-""Arena"" per sfidarvi in locale con altri giocatori (attenti che gli altri avranno bisogno di un pad, però).

La terza modalità ""Campagna"" non è attualmente disponibile, ma è quella che dovrebbe rappresentare il piatto forte e il punto di orgoglio del gioco; scoprire che non c'era neanche un livello disponibile ci ha fatto rimanere veramente male.

In definitiva, il gioco lo consigliamo, ma al momento sconsigliamo di spenderci 18\20 euro perché offre davvero troppo poco. 
In prospettiva futura però, siamo convinti che uscirà un prodotto gustoso e godibile, per il quale al momento opportuno realizzeremo nuovi video e aggiorneremo la recensione.

Certamente, vi consigliamo di supportare il gioco perché oltre ad essere divertente, è anche un prodotto videoludico nostrano, un po' come gli arrosticini per gli abruzzesi, o le caciotte, o la Santa Inquisizione!",1440795718,1441009828,True,9,4,0.530861258506774902,3,False,False,True,False,,,

2)I nemici hanno troppa vita e per questo motivo ti annoia molto ucciderli tutti (devo ammetterlo, nelle arene ho saltato quasi tutti i nemici).
Ovviamente il gioco è ancora in beta, ma non vorrei mai avere solo il livello della lava ma con altri temi (tipo ghiaccio, arcobaleni e bho, spero di essermi spiegato)
Per adesso ho riscontrato un piccolo bug causato dalla molla che fa saltare e 2 crash, io mentre caricava un livello, un altro mentre si avviava il gioco.

Now Studio Evil and Sio are teaming up to bring this wacko comic style to the action rpg/roguelike genre.

I've watched these guys build this game from afar for a long time, from their super-fast Greenlight, through their Kickstarter (Italian only) and now on Steam Early Access.

You move around. You pick up anything. You can throw those things. Or eat those things. Depending what you eat and what you ""believe"", your abilities change. The art style is hilarious, with parrot-heads moving around on wheels, skeletons with steel underwear, melons, ham, pirate hates and lots of strange elements.

While it's still early access, it's also really coming together into a unique, hilarious, almost party-like game. If you like local co-op games like Castle Crashers and/or unique beautiful 2D art games like Binding of Isaac or anything Nintendoish, you might just love Super Cane.

Tutte le sue invenzioni dal mondo di Scottecs sono catapultate come per magia all’interno di un videogioco, sviluppato dallo Studio Evil, team di Bologna specializzato nella realizzazione di videogames (per conoscerli meglio, non perdete la nostra intervista realizzata non troppo tempo fa).
Quello che gli sviluppatori hanno promesso è un videogioco interamente basato sul mondo di Scottecs, dove, interpretando la modalità Storia si avrà la possibilità di vestire i panni di Coso (o Cosa) e salvare il mondo. Sarà possibile esplorare l’intero mondo, combattere, parlare e interagire con altri personaggi. Inoltre dalle immagini apparse sulla pagina di Steam è intuibile che il nostro personaggio potrà anche avere un inventario, e dunque portare con sé dell’equipaggiamento, pozioni, vestiario, armi, magie, tutto ovviamente circondato dal non-sense. Purtroppo per il momento tutto questo rimane solo una promessa degli sviluppatori, in quanto, attualmente, acquistando il gioco in Early Access su Steam è possibile soltanto giocare a due modalità: Arena e Sfida. Abbiamo avuto l’occasione di giocare queste due modalità in modo approfondito, dunque vediamole un po’ più nel dettaglio.

Per quel che riguarda la modalità Arena, i videogiocatori avranno la possibilità di giocare in multiplayer locale, con un massimo di quattro giocatori per una sfida avvincente. Per il momento si può scegliere tra quattro personaggi: Cosa, Coso, Dottor Culocane e Yogurt. Ognuno di essi avrà abilità e debolezze descritte nel mondo di Scottecs da Sio. Coso infatti sarà dotato di grande forza, mentre se decidiamo di scegliere il Dottor Culocane ad esempio, avremo come debolezza l’acqua. In questo caso addentrandoci nella pozza d’acqua sparsa per la mappa inizieremo a perdere punti vinta. Lo scopo di questa modalità è sconfiggere il nostro avversario utilizzando tutti gli oggetti disponibili nella mappa. Al momento sarà possibile scegliere tra due mappe, quindi due ambientazioni diverse.
L’altra modalità che ci viene offerta è quella della Sfida. In questa sfida, in single player o in co-op con gli amici ci troveremo di fronte ad una specie di arena. Avremo sempre la possibilità di scegliere tra uno dei personaggi, ma, questa volta, non dovremo fronteggiare un amico, bensì i bot. Troveremo sparsi per la mappa scrigni, barili e altri oggetti che ci aiuteranno nella nostra impresa. Ad esempio all’interno degli scrigni si potranno trovare degli oggetti lanciabili, come rocce, numeri, lettere, etc. Oltre a questi troveremo anche oggetti per riprendere energia. Ad esempio angurie, gambe, banane e simili che, se ingeriti, ricaricherrano la vita.

Il giocatore dispone infatti di una vita limitata: all’inizio della missione avrà ben tre cuori, che potranno sbloccarsi nel corso della partita. Inoltre una volta morti, si potrà tornare in gioco poiché si disporrà di una vita extra, che permetterà il respawn al checkpoint iniziale, ma persa anche questa il gioco terminerà.
I bot nemici potranno essere sconfitti lanciando loro gli oggetti, o lanciando essi stessi in zone della mappa con le loro debolezze. Ad esempio si potranno lanciare i teschi nella lava e gli omini di fuoco nell’acqua. Un’altra possibilità è quella di lanciare gli avversari a terra contro altri nemici. Una volta che un nemico sarà morto genererà un’insieme di ossa che potranno essere raccolte al pari di punti esperienza.
Per quello che concerne la parte tecnica, il gioco scorre in modo molto fluido, questo è da ammettere, anche se per alcuni versi il movimento in alcune parti risulta leggermente difficoltoso. Nonostante sia un gioco molto semplice dal punto di vista grafico, c’è da dire che rispecchia in modo perfetto le vignette di Sio: ogni personaggio e ogni oggetto, sono assolutamente identici a quelli da lui disegnati e le loro caratteristiche vengono perfettamente rispecchiate nel gioco (con tutta l’ironia e l’assurità che ne consegue).

[b]In Breve[/b]: Il gioco è un simpatico RPG non-sense che si basa in modo assolutamente rigoroso sul mondo di Scottecs creato da Sio. Ha un gameplay fluido e scorrevole, anche se a volte presenta delle piccole difficoltà nel movimento, cerca di rifarsi ad altri giochi del genere, anche se la grafica rimane molto ancorata, per via del suo legame alle vignette, al passato. Per il momento al gioco manca la modalità Storia, dunque non è possibile darne un parere a tutto tondo (aggiorneremo la recensione non appena sarà disponibile), ma per adesso è da considerarsi molto divertente se giocato con gli amici, ma al contempo un po' monotono se giocato da soli. Ovviamente l'introduzione di una modalità Storia ben congegnata aumenterà il desiderio di gioco e eliminerà quel senso di monotonia che può magari offrire la sola modalità Sfida. L'unica vera pecca è che non esisterà nessuna modalità online. Gli sviluppatori hanno assolutamente confermato tale voce, e questo è davvero un peccato in quanto sarebbe potuto uscirne qualcosa di veramente divertente. Sicuramente è un gioco da acquistare se si è amanti di Sio e del suo mondo.

[b]Pro:[/b]
+ Perfetta riproduzione del mondo cui si ispira
+ Gameplay fluido
+ Presenza di elementi divertenti

[b]Contro:[/b]
- Prezzo troppo alto
- Manca ancora la modalità storia
- Difficoltà in acluni controlli
- Pubblico di riferimento forse troppo limitato ai fan di Sio
- Assenza totale di multiplayer online",1440594711,1468830534,True,81,14,0.80035322904586792,1,False,False,True,False,,,
