There are some minor issues but the developer is working and releasing updates to improve. An example is ball physics, it was not good before and I had hard time to hit but now it has been fixed and improved.

I think this game could be an Early Access to start with lower price so that people would understand this scenario before buying it, give their feedback for improvements and later on make it finalized release with more price as necessary.",1512072711,1512072839,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It is a fun sport and I have played it a lot in my ""previous"" life. And as much as I would like to enjoy this game as well, I just can't. This is really a completely unfinnished product in every single way. Ball physics is really bad  and basically not working, movement scheme is impossible to use, grahpics is sub par etc etc. I would say this title, in its current state is alpha or even pre-alpha. And to ask 19â‚¬ for it is a scam. It is an obvious refund. Stay away until the developers has made this in to a real working products, or at least until they have a beta build to show.",1511368907,1511368907,False,15,0,0.69462132453918457,0,True,False,False,False,,,
