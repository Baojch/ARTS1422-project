Вообще, если вы привыкли видеть какое-то развитие сюжета в текстовых адвенчурах, где надо действительно вчитываться в текст или, например, идти по сюжету достаточно долго (скажем, были сто лет назад такие книги-адвенчуры, там надо было в зависимости от решения переходить на ту или иную страницу книги, чтобы узнать, как обернётся тот или иной выбор), то это текстовое безобразие - не для вас. Но попробовать стоит - учитывая то, что игра бесплатная и способов умереть тут - больше сотни.
p.s. А ещё здесь вас может убить Габен. Да, тот самый. Да, я совершенно серьёзна.
p.p.s. Пока делала ачивки, умерла 2887 раз. Помимо разных отрав, автомобильных аварий и оголённых проводов, кажется меня несколько раз рвали на части львы и котята. И хэдкрабы ели. О банальщине в духе ""умерла, не вставая с кровати"" или ""была застрелена"" упоминать не хочется, но умереть от соли ещё надо постараться. Или от вилки. А моё любимое - ""раздавлена садящимся самолётом"". Прямо чисто поле и танк из-за угла.
(!) Ах, да, в игре заявлены карточки, которые скорее всего выйдут с DLC на следующей неделе (7-13 сентября). Полагаю, стоить DLC будет сущие копейки, учитывая размер и направленность игры.
На данный момент (8.09) длц вышло, однако карточки пока не выпадают - это пофиксят в ближайшее время (upd от апреля 2016 года - карточек нет и не предвидится, единственный способ получить значок - это делать наборы карт). Те, кто ищет в этой игре лёгких ачивок, будут разочарованы. Многое тут зависит от упорства и чистого рандома. Несмотря на количество достижений, сидеть над ними придётся не один час.
Если вы дочитали до конца, то спешу заметить, что, несмотря на механику, игра походит разве что на четверть (а то и на 1/8) нормальной текстовой адвенчуры и куда логичнее было бы назвать её симулятором смерти, в текстовом варианте.

The game is a Choose Your Own Adventure Game in which the goal is to visit a closing theme park then home unharmed, whilst this seems simple the game design completely undermines the point of a CYOA as in the developers own words:
 
""You must survive ten chapters of ridiculous deaths and traps spanning over one hundred and fifty ways to die with no discernible way to navigate to safety. It's like playing Russian roulette with five chambers loaded, but more frustrating.""

Obviously trying to explore all the various methods of death is meant to be the games charm but after 8 minutes I found myself put off by the writers idea that ""Random equals funny"" and it felt very lazy and tedious.    
By taking away any meaningful way of judging your actions and the completely random and illogical nature of most of the deaths game play boils down to random guesswork and defeats the point of a choose you own adventure, this becomes even more difficult witch the new Saboteur feature which allows friends or strangers to trap your play through with additional dangers and can completely screw with the trial and error of learning a route through a chapter.

Focusing on the technical aspects, there is very little in terms of visuals with the majority of the game, in fact the bright white background began giving me a headache over time through the glare and the audio is just as lackluster with the majority of the game been a looping track which quickly grew to annoy.

Pros:
- Interesting Concept.
- Completely Free.
- Developers care for the game.
- Caters to particular audience.
- Steam Achievements.

Cons:
- Limited setup options
- Humour focused around random absurdity.
- No logic in choices.
- Looping music.
- Quickly loses all charm.

I like that there are a variety of game modes and that you can now choose to be saboteur instead of it being seemingly random. However, just as it was in the past, there never really seems to be many people playing and so there may be periods of time with no games to join as saboteur. The story itself was pretty neat, and I liked the variety of deaths in the game (and while some were extremely silly, it was still fun to read). I also had an instance where an update cleared stats whenever the game was closed, but the dev was really great and quickly fixed the issue.

To ""coś"" próbuje udawać tekstową przygodówkę. Zaczynamy wybudzając się w swoim pokoju, już pierwsze kliknięcie daje 75% szans na to, że zginiemy i przeczytamy pierwszy kiczowaty opis śmierci. Następnie znowu budzimy się w naszym łóżku i próbujemy zgadnąć która opcja nie doprowadzi do naszej śmierci. Za każdym razem gra cofa nas do samego początku, nieważne gdzie uda się nam dojść. Najgorsze w tym wszystkim jest to, że mamy około 25% szans na to, że nawet ""prawidłowa"" odpowiedź nas zabije, co doprowadza do jeszcze gorszej sytuacji, gdzie powiedzmy zapamiętaliśmy już fragment gry co i jak klikać i nagle dochodzimy do momentu, gdzie pomimo wykorzystania wszystkich opcji zginęliśmy. Tak więc będziemy zmuszeni powtórzyć sekwencję do 8 razy od samego początku gry, aż""posuniemy"" się w rozgrywce dalej. Wystarczy około 20 minut, aby to ""coś"" udające grę nas sfrustrowało i z teoretycznie ciekawego pomysłu zamieniło się w koszmar. Nie ma żadnego powodu, aby poświęcić temu czemuś więcej niż 20-dzieścia minut.

To ""coś"" nie jest grą. Trudno to nazwać nawet eksperymentem. Produkt ten jest za drogi nawet za darmo, bo marnuje nasz cenny czas i kosztuje nas kilkanaście a może nawet kilkadziesiąt minut cennego czasu, który moglibyśmy spędzić na 1000-siąc innych lepszych sposobów. Myślę, że patrzenie w pusty ekran monitora będzie ciekawszym zajęciem, bo może zmusi nas do jakichś przemyśleń. Tymczasem ta gra zmusza tylko do szaleńczego śmiechu z frustracji i przeklikiwania ekranów z durnymi opisami śmierci.... Nie polecam nawet za darmo.

I think dying for real might be more fun then this ""game?"".

I've had this in my steam library for more then two years without trying it, untill today when I was bored enough to go through my library looking for a gem.
This is definately not one of those rare gems that have been hiding i plain sight.


The game in a nutshell:

You press a number on your keyboard, and some story text comes up on screen.
The text either tells you that you die, and how, or gives you some choices like ""make a sandwich"" or ""go to the bathroom"".
Then you press a new number, and you get a new text.
Rinse and repeat until you die.

There are multible paths to get to the kitchen and make a sandwich, and multiple outcomes after making said sandwich, seemingly depending on how you got there in the first place, and what you choose to do next (the number combination you have chosen).

It looks like the inspiration for this ""game"" is one of those ""maze/lock puzzles"" where you have to complete a maze that is not visible to you, either in a box or cylinder. Once you make a wrong move, you have to start over.
While those can be fun in their own right, if your into that sort of thing. It is not a concept that works as a computer game, at least not in this instance.

I find that this ""game"" is the pinacle of what is wrong with steam, and an insult to every hard working indie developer out there.",1519968551,1519968551,False,2,0,0.531914889812469482,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Liked the concept on paper so got the DLC to encourage the dev. Tried game today. Regret my decision

You get a bit of fluff text, followed by a simple dialogue tree with basic options. No matter what option you pick, you get asked by the game to input a number between 1 and 14. Somehow that value is fed into the script and can determine what next script fires, and thus how you die. Creates a lot of variety, which is a selling point. But you can also wind up running into the same deaths because the same number pops up in the equation even if the sequence of events you took leads you elsewhere. The game is nonsensical really, and has a randomly generated feel to it at times. Such as dying from molotov cocktail in the face after skipping breakfast and getting out the door. Dying of cannibalism... It just is too loosely connected to feel like choice&consequence. I did not encounter bugs or typos and the engine and interfaces were clean. There very little audio to speak of at all. The trial and error nature of the game would mean you would need to take pen and paper and map out the dialogue tree or rely on memory and always repeat the same path and the same RNG values for the equations to ensure constant progression which sounds very laborious.

Sounds easy right? Wrong, so one clicked answer that was right the first time, mayb be wrong every other time. It will require a lot of clicks (and time if like me you read the story as well) to get all achievements. While I cant say its a bad game, I can't say its great either. I DO love the concept behind the game but i feel continued play is going to leave me frustrated because I will grow tired of reading the text over and just skip though it just to get more story progression. I think the fact it is random and you have zero control is a bit of a dampener, and at the same time it adds a touch of reality - we cannot control when we die and sometimes trying to avoid it ultimately brings us closer. The end is inevitable. A very grim game indeed.

Recommended if:
* You like reading gore and death
* You like random pick-a-path encounters
* You are prepared and happy to read through a tonne of text

NOT recommended if:
* Death scenes make you paranoid
* Your own anxious imagination is your worst enemy
* You get bored with random text repeatedly

그래픽적인 비주얼은 전혀 없고 오로지 텍스트만 나오는 일종의 디지털소설같은 게임이다.
영어를 잘하거나 영어권 국가의 유저들한테는 내용적으로 조금이나마 재미를 줄지 모르겠지만 사실상 게임성은 없는 전혀 게임이라고 할수 있다.
도전과제의 목적이 아니라면 아예 손 안되는게 좋을 것이다. 이 게임의 진행 방식은 텍스트가 나오고 선택지의 선택에 따라서 결말(죽음)이 달라지는 방식이다. 그래서 영어를 잘 하지 못하는 유저한테는 별다른 재미를 주지 못하는 게임이다. 그렇다고 영문을 해석하면서 할만큼의 가치도 없는 게임이다.

도전과제를 2시간 반 정도에 달성한 유저도 있긴하나 보통은 5~10시간 정도 클릭 노가다를 해야 달성이 가능하다. 도전과제 중에는 크리스마스 도전과제와 할로윈 도전과제가 있는데 그것은 컴퓨터 날짜를 해당 날짜로 수정해서 플레이하면 달성이 가능해진다. (자세한 사항은 가이드를 참고하길 바란다.) 도전과제 중에는 666번의 죽음을 당해야 하는 도전과제가 있는데 상당히 클릭 노가다가 있는 게임이다.;;

게임의 완성도나 재미면서에서는 떨어지는 편이지만 개발자가 지속적인 업데이트와 피트백을 잘해주는 점에서 일단은 추천한다.
도전과제 달성용 게임으로 보고 게임한다면 그나마 나은편이다.

Maybe this game has an audience, but steam is the wrong place for this game. It is very interesting and has creative plot scenarios, and that about it... no jump scares, nothing.

Pros:
-Interesting idea, the fact that they tried something different with a text-based game breaks away from what we know with games nowadays
-A large amount of different deaths in the game
-It is free, and reasonably small in size

Cons:
-Idea is executed poorly, deaths are random and making it to the Fun Park and back takes forever
-No options with regards to resolution 
-The game requires a lot of reading, if this is not your sort of thing, you will completely hate this game

Overall, the game has some novel ideas, which could have been executed better. Worth a look if you enjoy reading and have the time for it, otherwise avoid.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
One Way To Die: Steam Edition is an interactive fiction about dying. There are a bunch of text explaining the story and there will be always several options to choose with randomized results after that.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story in this game is very simple: it's about a man (you) who wants to go to and back to the last day opening of an amusement park. Although the choices will result in deaths or a continuation for the story, it won't affect the story that much. Most of the story is the same with just a little difference in detail or with an additional text explaining how the man dies.

[h1]The game[/h1]
The game itself is pretty randomized; you can die without even doing anything. Any choice you choose will result in death or not based on your luck. Although you can choose which result do you want if you buy the deluxe edition (and some achievement will only unlock with the deluxe edition), that will beat the purpose of the game.

Sometimes, you'll be a saboteur, the one who'll set up traps to make more deaths on the choices. There is also a counter-measure team for that, who'll disarm the traps. Whether you'll be the saboteur, the non-saboteur, or the one who disarm the trap is randomized.

[h1]Music[/h1]
The music is annoying. I have to mute the game in order to play it because it's terrible.

[h1]Graphic[/h1]
I can't really say much about the graphics because the game is just about a bunch of a text in a screen. It won't really matter for me if it's just a black and white in cmd style. At least the menu isn't hard to learn and the text is readable.

Pros:
- Multiple choices

Cons:
- Randomized results

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's just an interactive fiction with a lot of reused text between the scenes. Although there are multiple choices, the choice will either be death or survive; making the choice not even useful at all.

At first it may sound simple, but death in this game waits around every corner. While in some playthroughs you may never encounter it, in others you won't even be able to get out of bed! A good thing is, though, that the game is kinda short, so you won't lose much progress, no matter where you die. This is a text-based adventure, meaning that all ""levels"", to call them something, are texts telling you the story, and then you have a few options about what to do.

The outcome of the story doesn't really change, all scenarios are pretty much the same, no matter how you got there; still, there's some hilarious writing, particularly in the death scenes. However, something I'd consider a negative is the complete randomness of death; while it adds a sense of worry to the game, it also gets kinda frustrating when you can't progress through the story because you keep dying.

Another thing it has is a saboteur, which can be either you, another player, or the computer (this last option is if you want to play saboteur mode alone, in which you rotate between being saboteur with the computer). The saboteur's job is setting up traps, which an extra death ""chance"" in the scenario is set. Of course, other players can then disarm the traps, in case they don't fall on them.

All in all, it's an entertaining game, for at least an hour or two, although it loses some of its charm after a few replays.",1456853107,1456853107,True,4,0,0.571917474269866943,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Play as your character as you die various times, read a lot of text (Probably a few of the giant blocks of text, I mean would be sufficient) and get that damned elephant from the raffle!

Pros:
- 16 achievements, nice and simple.
- It's text-based, so it's a quick download and has a lot of charm
- You get to murder someone various times! Which isn't legal in most countries!
- The DLC is nice and cheap, $1 USD for a bunch of addons which enhance the experience and add more deaths which do not alter the achievements whatsoever.
- Halloween and Christmas themed achievements that can only be triggered by changing your time, which is a small setback which is worth it.

Cons (Why am I making this part there is practically no cons):
- Too short, could be longer.
- Can't go faster than Hesus
- Not many achievements, for an achievement hunter like me, it's a bit easy.

Thanks for reading my review, I do recommend this game, definitely!

This is the Death Simulator (text-style).

You boot up the game?  You'll probably die.
You try to beat the game?  You'll likely die.
You try to play it safe?  You're probably dead.
You try to sabotage other players?  You're probably gonna die.
You try to disarm a trap?  Probably gonna die.
You try not to die?  You're going to die.
You try to die?  You might win but will likely die.


PROS:
Clever ways to die
Free
Achievements
Comedic deaths
No bugs

CONS:
A little boring
Grindy achievements based on luck and counters
Comedy can get rather lackluster

It is a simplistic game with simplistic humor.  The deaths in this game are random and protecting yourself means next to nothing as you're most likely going to die anyway.  I would not recommend playing more than an hour as that seems to be the entertainment limit with this one.... (You'll probably get bored in the range of 30-60 minutes with this one)

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this one UNLESS you want a quick chuckle or free achievements (or a free 100%).

This was a game I picked because it looked easy to get the achievements, and the intro video was funny, especially the guys reactions. 

Achievements are really easy, and after a while I started reading quite a few of the deaths, which many of the deaths are hilarious. 
It catches you really in the way of trying to get the achievements and that after a while, if you aren't focused on that, it will seem repetitive to you. 

Since I focused on those and read the deaths every once in a while, they turned into rare treats of humor, making it quite fun tbh.

This is a text game, similar to the old which-way adventure books. You are presented with a scenario with 1 to 3 choices. (Yeah, I know ""1"" choice isn't really a choice but you have no other option to choose from if you want to keep the game going)
There's several different order of choices that can be chosen and will determine what achievements you may receive.

One Way To Die is a text adventure wherein 1. there are actually over 100 ways to die and 2. your choices don't make any difference. Every time you click on a decision, the game will randomly roll to see if your character dies in some convoluted manner. You earn nothing other than a single achievement for successfully surviving one day.

The only potentially interesting portion of the game is the Saboteur system... players marked as Saboteurs can set traps that add death options to other players' games. Affected players who survive those traps can then disarm them. The problem is that this adds absolutely nothing interesting to the game whatsover as these additional deaths are still completely random, and the Saboteur must survive up to a certain page in order to set a trap on that page anyway.

This devil-may-care randomosity would be acceptable if the resulting verbose deaths were particularly funny, but they're not. They tend to be puerile humor written awkwardly, as though a small child was just getting into comedy writing -- I stopped bothering to read them at all about three deaths into the game.

I've played this game for less than an hour and have already earned all of its achievements with the exception of dumb crap like ""die 1000 times"" and the next-to-impossible ""Experience every unique death""... One of these unique deaths is a Saboteur trap that only rolls on the very last page, meaning a Saboteur must survive to that page (which is totally random), be given the option to set that trap, and choose to set it... then not only do you have to survive to the end of the game (which is totally random), but you must be killed by that exact trap and not any of the dozen or so other ways to die there.

All in all, the game has no real play value, and the purpose of its existence is dubious.",1444015906,1444015906,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Bom fui ""obrigado"" a deletar e fazer uma nova analise

antigamente tinha dito que era só ligar o auto-click que platinava
mas dai eles adicionam uma DLC e mais 7 conquistas chatas de pegar...

o jogo em si é um monte de texto em inglês onde você seleciona uma das opções para continuar,
você quase sempre morre, mas as vezes ganha imunidade e monta ou escapa de armadilhas
as conquistas exploram ""tudo"" isso, e embora eu tenha tentado não vi nenhum sentido lógico
uma sequencia, também não sei se eu ganhei ou não, na verdade acho que o jogo nunca termina

...com isso usar o auto-click loucamente não deu muito certo para platinar (novamente)
então usei um recurso que faz macros que tem no AutoClick 2.2 para ficar clicando nos botões do jogo deixei ligado de madrugada e quando acordei tava platinado, então faça isso que você consegue =)

Você morreu por um Aneurisma Cerebral... LOL WHAT?

Este é o jogo mais sem sentido que já joguei na minha vida, ele foi feito para ser engraçado e não desafiador. Inicialmente eu pensei que era um tipo de RPG, no qual você vai lendo a história e precisa escolher uma opção de como agir, vendo o resultado da sua ação - você fez a escolha certa ou vai sofrer consequências graves pelo que causou?

Bem, no caso de ""One Way to Die"" tudo fica muito diferente, o nome do jogo já é cômico e sarcástico, pois basicamente todos os caminhos que você escolher vão te levar para a morte... Ele é totalmente em inglês, mas se você tiver dificuldade pode se concentrar em ler apenas a barra vermelha no final da tela, que resume os acontecimentos principais.

Inicialmente você tem três opções de como agir, e depois conforme você vai tendo sorte novas opções vão surgindo para procedência da história, que é muito curta. No entanto, como eu disse precisa de sorte, como cada opção que você escolhe tem a chance de acontecer uma morte totalmente aleatória! Você pode clicar na mesma opção 5 vezes, nas 5 você vai morrer de um jeito diferente em cada uma! É muito sem noção.

No início fui fazer um sanduíche e morri por uma explosão no micro-ondas! Então mudei de alternativa, e fui tomar remédio pra dor de cabeça, e acabei cometendo suicídio (what?); depois fui sair da casa para ir ao parque e morri ao ser atacado por várias aranhas sanguinárias o_O

Continuei me aventurando e quando a sorte ficava ao meu lado eu progredia na história: peguei o carro e quando fui sair a gasolina mostrou-se no fim, quando fui abastecer o carro um mendigo causou um acidente com um cigarro e eu morri queimado... Após mais tentativas cheguei no parque, e eis que morri por picada de cobra. Tentei mais vezes, quando ia sair do parque um meteoro me massacrou... Continuei tentando, e quando ia voltar para casa uma explosão me atingiu... Minha fé ainda não tinha acabado, continuei tentando e morrendo por peças de metal, tiro de uma arma, coquetel molotov, por estupidez, por um avião em queda, por envenenamento e até por ser esmagado por uma Stripper gorda!

Só depois de tudo quanto é tipo de morte (até mesmo por um casco de tartaruga) consegui chegar em casa vivo e terminei a história. Com isso, faço questão de recomendar este jogo, onde até as conquistas são non-sense (você só desbloqueia elas após fechar o jogo), pois eles realmente foram muito criativos para criar tantas histórias de morte diferentes e colocar realmente alguns parágrafos de como tudo aconteceu. O jogo mais maluco da Steam.

This might be free-to-play but the 0.99 cents (US) DLC is worth adding. 111 different ways to die (with DLC added), some bizarre, some funny, some absurb, some WTF, some STEAM related and all a reference or pun to something (even the page titles). 

Short text based game with achievements and trading cards (not dropped, at least not yet and the only reason for the existence of the 0.99 cent DLC) that requires the lost art of reading and that even more ancient art of knowing the reference used for the pun or punchline. I personally nominate this character for a Darwin Award ... 111 times.

With the 2015 Halloween update there are now 121 ways to die (The 10 Halloween related deaths give the achievement The Hallowest.)  The developer added another 10 deaths for 2015 Christmas and claims this will be the last time. (The 10 Christmas related deaths give the achievement Crimson X-Mas).  Note: Both of the holiday related deaths and corresponding achievements are only available during that particular holiday. 

In the 2019 update, the music is better, picture graphics have been added and the game play has been tweaked.  It is much easier to die now.  Not sure I would still recommend it since all the dying gets in the way of the absurd story of getting to the fun fair, winning an elephant, and making it home alive again.  It was much more fun to work at dying in bizarre, unusual and downright stupid ways.

Weird game.  like a Text adventure but seems like there is a random number generator sending death at you.  Sort of looks like there is a correct path of choices but sometime you still die from some random event.

His is usually a face that only sees major titles and nothing else. So I keep picking up random games just as silly as this and as we sit together and play I feel joy in knowing that I'm introducing the surprising amount of fun (and pain) indie games, that wear their simple mechanics and bare graphics proudly like some trendy new quirky armour, can actually be. A lover of such wacky video games, a good deal of my allocated gaming time is spent playing glorious ""abominations"" on the likes of Game Jolt, itch.io and Desura. There is a difference between badly made games and games of an acquired taste that seem bad unless you know how to consume it. OWtD is like a free slab of English Blue Stilton cheese or Japanese Nattō at the supermarket. So I was dissapointed to see the reproach of less than happy reviews after the inital positive curiosity upon release. This game is a wonderful idea and fun to try out though it is useful to step into this game with a bucket full of greasy, troll humour ridden popcorn.

Even indie gaming is becoming increasingly impressive with its limitless depth in story, bridged together with richly instrumental tracks and remarkably eye popping designs. To me that feels less like an indie game and more a game executed with finesse by smaller companies between the great mountains of bigger corps and small hills of one man/woman devs. So in my compartmentalised noggin, OWtD is the ideal simple indie game. Text based games are also an endangered species that need more love!

　　　There are absurdly unfair and ghastly deaths awaiting you in the land of OWtD where ironically there really isn't just a singular method to death and instead only  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/388490/discussions/0/527273983049293680/#c527273983051130744]one way to live[/url]. That is unless you're a downer and decide to bet that, ""this is definitely [i]one[/i] way to die..."" and make fun of the boredom in playing this game. It's tricky since as a text based game you need to read a lot, especially at the start. If the writing were any less goofy and better done, I'd be put off since this is a joke game that gets its titles from Wikileaks documents. It [i]owns[/i] its crass humour. If you're curious, play a while and like I did you may find something new and interesting. If you are fond of MUD games, this feels like a dumbed down version where you only have one choice - forward to questionless death. And then sometimes you'll spit out a window and get pulverised by a speeding car. That sort of the mundane day in the life of a death row prisoner.

You wake up in bed and go about your day until you either die or go to bed again and either way you wake up the next day with the same strange feeling that you are going to be exterminated. This is repeated as if you're suffering from sleep paralysis or even better filming another addition to the Final Destination horror franchise. 

During the course of playing this game I only won a fraction of times compared to the excruciating quantity of deaths. Yet it only takes 20 minutes to realise there are other features to this game that are important to enjoying the whole experience of dying over a hundred different ways. For a game that is text based and feels largely inactive, the achievements make it so that you must absolutely help others help you. It is a roundabout of murder and mayhem which will keep your head spinning and eyes glued mostly to the bottom of the screen since the few scenarios are outweighed by the 100+ deaths. It took me approximately 8 hours to feel satisfied I had completed the game after all the achievements (grindy). If it were a larger game I'd be willing to spend more time on it but the content is minimal which I expect is why there is a DLC. 

　　　After release it later added new features mostly revolving around a Saboteur addition that pulled the game onto the shores of multiplayer games and added to the longevity, and the demise of it in the long run. I have enjoyed this game through all its bugs and annoyances and the worst part of this game is possibly the greatness of the Saboteur. As a Saboteur (Sab) you have the responsibility to set good traps across a wide area. You are given keys to the kingdom and you will ultimately rampage to kill every living user online over, and over. This is amusing. But from lack of attention/noobness/bug, a Sab can end up doing the following: 1) Setting traps only in the same areas leading to players only finding the same traps over and over and 2) Not setting traps at all, taking away from the experience of players trying to disarm Sab traps (though idling now has a thankful 2 minute limit). That is a huge downside of this game and to me the only one there seems to be. It's fun since everyone has their own style of play and it is evident through keeping an eye on the Sab's practices. 

　　　The support for bugs and various other errors is impeccable. Dev, Gramps is very consistent in aiding individual queries on the forums much like that of indie forums which is rare and joyful to see on Steam. Gramps is doing a superb job on the minimal hours of sleep I assume he's currently squishing into his busy schedule. His arms are wide open to constructive criticism and even has the balls to take blatantly lopsided negative reviews with a big cube of sugar. For example, the highly proactive developer, Gramps has pinned a discussion embedding all the video reviews floating around the web for OWtD [u]including ones introducing hacks in the game[/u]. What a guy! :) The conversation between players and devs is very open and active which is a huge plus. 

[b]Silly Drama[/b]
There is some misunderstanding around the first DLC released, which was explained in various discussion threads on the Steam forums. OWtD is a F2P game which early on suddenly released a DLC that people could purchase. It was a logical answer to combat the problem of trading cards not being dropped since it had no micro-transactions. Before the DLC came about a user posted a suggestion about releasing a cheap DLC during a forum discussion relating to people who could not get trading cards for OWtD unless they used gems to craft booster packs, or bought them on market from people who had done just that [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/388490/discussions/0/527273983049587003/](this is the post)[/url]. It became an issue because the DLC had achievements and this was not constructed in the best manner. Luckily it was a very short-lived mix-up that went away promptly and has been completely fixed. It could have been handled better but does not seem purposeful and as it is currently not a problem I don't see how it reflects negatively on the game any more and feels irrelevant.


[b]TIPS:[/b]

* Set traps in the bathroom, kitchen and the gas station. Spread them out, mix them up and you should get a furiously gleeful death toll as well as helpfully pushing other players towards more satisfying and fun gameplay. [i]Stats accessible via game menu.[/i]  

* Each player has preferences. Learning trap patterns and jumping through hellfire to disable them is an entertaining way for players to drag the Sab off the iron throne ;). After the recent big patch, inactive Sabs who fail to leave traps for longer than 2 minutes will lose their turn. Sabs are random and picked right after the previous turn (if you cease clicking you won't be Sab). Active Sabs will be able to set traps until they reach a set kill number or after a certain duration of time has elapsed.

As you blink away the fog of that last dream, the one where you died, a feeling of dread creeps over you. You are barely able to recall the last few seconds when suddenly it is replaced by a nasty headache. Despite the feeling that horrible things are about to happen, and your pulsating cranium, you remember that today is the day you're going to write a review about the game where you've repeatively died in.

While the closing of the game itself is truly a crime against humanity, the upside is you get to repeatively wake up and feel anxious about going outside your house in fear of death but you just really want to go to the Finnigan Brothers' Fun Park, Even though you wake up from your dream where you died right before you go to the park you want to go anyways, even though your brain tells you not to. But, will we ever even make it to the park, and if we do, do we ever get home? Well eating sandwiches seem too be a hassle so why not eat a hotdog? Then again my last dream you got crushed by salt. So lets get some gas, then again you died from a car bomb in your previous dream too. Why don't you just go ask my local garbage trucks to take you to the glorious Finnigan Brothers' Fun Park? Well then again, they dumped salt on you three dreams ago. You should really think about taking care of this headache... But even if you do you might get blasted by an asteroid. So you think you should just write a review about this experience.

You stand up from the bed and stretch a little. A yawn slips out as you scratch your head and turn toward your window, which happens to have a lovely view of Murphy's Lake. A gorgeous day to spend at Finnigan Brothers', but you turn away because you know if you go outside you might as well get shot in a drive by. So you head to your computer instead. Where you pull up a page and write a 10/10 positive review for these experiences. You hit submit and soon later you feel anxiety creep up on you again. Your computer processes the review and then turns into an automatic turret that blasts twenty holes into your chest.

You feel every ounce of pain until you quickly fall dead, from the immediate loss of blood. Blood covers your chair, and drains on to the floor. Guts splattered on the window behind you.

________________________________________________________________________________

Before I get into anything specific of this game I do believe that most of the people that have been reviewing this game haven't really gave much thought about it. They thought that this game was another one of those scam games you find in the f2p genre and that the developers just want to get quick and easy money. But they didn't give the developers time, nor even a chance to redeem themselves. Here's what I'm talking about, The game got released to the point where everything was f2p about it... You could collect all the achievements without having to pay for anything, you could see everything that the game had to offer without paying one cent. But then they released a DLC that was $0.99, this added bonus content that would extend the game further, the one problem with this is that you needed the DLC to get the bonus achievements. People thought that the developers used a scam as for easy achievements so people would play the game more, then make people pay money for their perfect game. But this was never their intention and they realized what had happened soon after in which they quickly fixed as soon as possible, because you know what? They are one of the few f2p game developing teams to listen to their community. I've noticed it first hand since I had problems getting the game to work on my computer at first and I posted a bug ticket on the forums which was answered on the same day, and was fixed the day after. But back to the DLC topic, they have fixed it where you can achieve 100% without buying the DLC, and you now get what was supposed to be in the DLC for free. They still have the DLC but it contains extra things that don't change the progression of the game, they're just extra endings and such. But the fact of this all, is you've seen a game that had overwhelmingly positive go to mostly positive because, people didn't give a recovery time, they saw what had happened with the update and they immediately negative reviewed the game as expected and they probably don't even care that the game was fixed. They just wanted their achievements and didn't really care about the game. So they probably haven't even bothered changing their reviews. But, nevertheless this game, and it's developing team deserve this positive review. I've only played this game for a little over an hour after I get done writing this review, but even then you know what the general concept of this game is about. This is one of the best F2P games I've played and if anyone asks me what f2p game I recommend, I will always recommend this one because it's original, it's randomized, and the people who made it are really good people. They're offering refunds for those who bought the DLC for the achievements but didn't actually want the DLC since they made that part free in their new update anyways. How many times do you see that from game developers? Like close to never. There are so many ripoff games on Steam that you can't count anymore. But there are few good ones that you can go through and say ""I know for a fact that this will make my day"". This is one of them. I don't know any of the developers on a personal basis. I am just the average gamer like most players of this game. The only connection that I've had with the developers was when Gramps helped me on the forums to get the game working on my 32-bit system. Nothing else. I just don't really like the way people have been treating this game because of one tiny misconception that has been fixed. This game is good, really good. If you haven't played it, you should play it now. I promise a 10/10 if you aren't easily nauseated to the thought of blood and gore. Just give a shot, and if I was wrong, give me a downvote but this is one of my favorite f2p games even though I've only known it for 2-3 days. I hope I was helpful and if I wasn't I apologize. But, this game and the developers have been getting so much crap lately, ignore the majority of reviews saying this is a scam, because it isn't. They fixed it. Try it out for yourself. You'll find yourself enjoying the game quite a lot. This was Nahmay, thanks for reading my review.

And the Dev had the audacity to release a DLC, on a game that is litterally groups of Enhanced Booleans. It would take an average mind about 1 week of work for about 2 hours a day to make the same thing on a smaller scale.

Rating 4.5/10, 5 of them died in a random explosion of the Whole Freaking Ring of Fire, and one was maimed by an angry swedish grandmother who was once a special ops agent.

""One Way To Die"" is a free game. It's important to point that out from the start, but until you play you just won't understand.

I've no doubt that this game has caused more deaths per player than the next ten games in contention. It's not a game where you may die, it's a game in which you may, through patience, luck or karma....live. Once. Before you grow tired of the pointlessness.

In this profane, borderline obscene all-text game, your character awakens, feeling lousy, and remembers that the day is to be spent at a local amusement park. As you prepare for the day, you are given one, two or three options (if you aren’t already crushed by a jet engine, that is.) You'll find soon it doesn't matter what you choose, or even if you choose the same option next time it's offered, the choice will almost certainly lead to your death. Why play? Because the writing is SO irreverent and funny.

Once I realized this game in no way involved reason or logic, and I just clicked as quickly as possible, I managed to acquire five of seven achievements in less than five minutes. But....I never survived. So I quit.

Sorry that the review is as short as my session with One Way To Die. I want to be sure not to ruin it for you. HAR!

Thank you.

well i mean ITS ENTIRELY LUCKBASED!

but it aint a bad thing...


to me,

im open to everyones opinion, as anyone to mine. so i can see where luck based stuff, especialy if they cost real life money, (looking at you, MR. Newell) can be considered annoying, bad, or in some cases, game-breaking.

but this isnt one of those.

instead of anger and hatred, its sorta like, playful annoyence and hilarity. mainly because its so batshite insane with its deaths that you cant take it seriously.

But i doubt that One Way To Die. takes itself seriously,

Amikor csak olvasni kellett és választani bizonyos lehetőségek közül. Na ez pont ilyen, csak nem RPG. Ha jellemezni kellene akkor csak úgy tudnám, hogy ez az idei év egyik legjobb halál szimulátora. Viccen kivül. 
Grafikáról és hangokról nem is érdemes most beszélnünk mivel ez a játék nem erről szól. Kapott egy stílusos menüt meg egy egyszerű de frankó hátteret a szöveg. És ennyi. A zenéje tetszetős neki, habár a minőségen még lehet csiszolni, de F2P cím, szóval megbocsájtható ez neki. 
Na de a lényeg, a sztori tök egyszerű szóval nem tudom lelöni. Vagyunk mi egy tök átlagos emberek és mivel megnyitotta kapuit a Finnigan Brothers' Fun Park el akarunk ide jutni. Ennyi. PONT. Nincs tovább. A lényeg hogy, hogy jutsz ide el, vagy eljutsz-e egyáltalán. Ha azt mondom hogy 20 perc alatt többször halsz meg mint mondjuk a Dark Soulsban akkor nem túlzok. Kis millió képpen meghalhatsz. Megehet egy kanibál, a pofádba repülhet egy tűzcsap, de még akár az egerek is élve felfalhatnak. Szóval a legképtelenebb baleseteket is össze lehet benne hozzni.
Mi kell a játékhoz ? Angol tudás, az minden mennyiségben. Ha nem ismered a nyelvet neki se fogj, mert nem fogod érteni. A leírások nagyon frankók lettek, jó olvasni őket. 
Na és persze döntések. Mindig a mi döntésünk hogy pár lehetőség közül mit választunk. Néha kaphatunk immunitásokat, pl. ha nem fülladunk bele ép a kajába akkor éhségtől nem valószinű hogy megfogunk halni, vagy bármi olyan dologtól ami azzal kapcsolatos. BÁRMIKOR, bárhogy meghalhatunk, van amikor már rögtön a kezdésnél közli veled a játék, hogy bocsi de a házadra zuhant egy repülő és meghaltál. OWNED.

Lehetne azt mondani hogy ez nem játék, csak egy rakás szöveg és random generált történések. Ami tulajdonképpen igaz is. Ennek ellenére még is bele lehet szuszakolni a játék kategoriába. Régen is voltak ilyenek, és most miért is ne ? A döntés mindig a mi kezünkben van. 

- Ajánlani annak tudom aki tud angolul. És szereti ezt a műfajt.
- Annak viszont sajnos nem tudom ajánlani aki nem tud angolul. Talán lesz egyszer magyarositás hozzá, akkor viszont érdemes lesz kiprobálni.

Mivel F2P így mindenkihez eljuthat. Achievementek vannak, egyszerű kimaxolni is. (még bugos a számláló, de ettől még megjellenek az achik, plusz dolgoznak már rajta). Kártya támogatást is mutat az Áruház, még nincs de lesz. Jön úgyanis a Deluxe Edition (F2P játék nem dob kártyát, szóval ez az egyetlen megoldás).
