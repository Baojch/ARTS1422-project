When I was gaming, oh so wonderful,
Before The Echo, oh it was mystical, magical.
And all the beats in the game,
Had me tapping, dancing, no shame,
So rhythmically, so fantastically, entrancing me.

Good gaming! Yeaaaaaah!
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up! Press those keys, feel the score!
Aaaah! I game, me no shame,
Me no quit,
Me no play, yeah
When the tunes hit the stereo zone,
And I groove with the game's undertone,
Players in the space, players in the case,
Before The Echo are you ready?
When I was playing, oh so wonderful,
Before The Echo, oh it was magical.
And all the notes in the beat,
Had me grooving, moving my feet,
So musically, so fantastically, enveloping me.

Yeah!
When I was playing, oh so wonderful,
Before The Echo, oh it was magical.
And all the beats in the game,
Had me tapping, dancing, no shame,
So rhythmically, so fantastically, entrancing me.

Come on! Love, beats, and strategy,
Before The Echo, the place to be.
The beats, the notes, the patterns, the technology,
Halleluja! One, two... one, two, three, yeah!
Rough! Aah! Here we go!

[i]INT. A COOKING SHOW SET - DAY

The camera zooms in on AINSLEY HARRIOTT, the charismatic chef, who is now seated in front of a gaming console with a controller in hand. The screen displays ""Before The Echo."" Suddenly, BRIAN BLESSED bursts onto the set, bringing his booming presence.

BRIAN BLESSED:
Ainsley, my friend! What's this I hear about gaming? I couldn't resist joining in on the fun!

He grabs a second controller and sits next to Ainsley with a big grin.

AINLSEY:
(laughing) Brian, you magnificent man! Welcome aboard. We're diving into ""Before The Echo."" It's like a feast for the senses!

Brian chuckles and nods, ready to play.

BRIAN BLESSED:
Well, let's get on with it! I've faced wild animals and climbed Everest, but a gaming adventure? This is a first!

They both start playing, Ainsley giving Brian a crash course in the game.

AINSLSEY:
Now, Brian, it's all about timing. Like when you're on stage, commanding the audience!

BRIAN BLESSED:
(laughing) Timing is my middle name, Ainsley! Well, not literally, but you get my point.

They both get into the rhythm, tapping away on their controllers.

AINSLSEY:
Look at us, Brian! We're like a duo in the kitchen, creating a symphony of flavors.

BRIAN BLESSED:
(laughing) A culinary masterpiece with a side of beats! Who would've thought?

They both share a hearty laugh as they tackle the game.

AINSLSEY:
Ah, now, Brian, imagine the beats are like the roar of a lion – powerful, commanding, and impossible to ignore!

BRIAN BLESSED:
(roaring) Yes! This game needs more roar! I'll supply the vocals.

Brian's laughter echoes through the set as they continue playing.

AINSLSEY:
And just like a Shakespearean play, Brian, each level unfolds like a new act.

BRIAN BLESSED:
(laughing) To game or not to game, that is the question!

They both engage in the playful banter, completely immersed in the game.

AINSLSEY:
Well, my friends, ""Before The Echo"" is a dish fit for kings – and a seasoned adventurer like Brian Blessed!

BRIAN BLESSED:
(laughing) A gaming adventure of epic proportions! I love it!

They both give a thumbs up, still tapping along with the game's music.

AINSLSEY:
Ainsley Harriott and Brian Blessed approve! Now, back to the kitchen for me, and... where does a man like you head next, Brian?

BRIAN BLESSED:
(laughing) To conquer new frontiers, my friend! But first, more gaming!

They share a laugh, and the camera fades out as the duo continues their gaming adventure.

As others have said, it's kind of like DDR/Guitar Hero but with some RPG elements. You're battling through enemies in this tower to try and get materials to craft items (including the key to proceed to the next floor each time). At the end of every floor you unlock the door and face a boss before moving on. 

Battles are almost like playing 3 mini DDR games at once, because you have 3 screens you need to rotate between:
[list]
[*]Defensive (hitting notes prevents damage from enemy)
[*]Spell (you cast spells to do damage, have to hit all of the notes or it fails) 
[*]Mana (to regain mana for more spells). 
[/list]

Successfully winning battles requires you to triage what notes on what screens are most important to hit, and balance going on the offensive with maintaining your mana levels and not taking too much damage. It's a neat little system that I haven't seen in any other game before or since. 

Unfortunately, there are way too many sources of irritation in this game for me to want to continue playing or to recommend to anyone. The TL;DR of it is that there aren't enough songs, the game is too grindy, and the writing is incredibly cringey. For more details, read on:

[list]
[*] There seem to be about three enemies per floor. Each enemy has a song associated with it that you'll be battling them on. Each enemy also has 3 drops of differing rarity levels that you will want/need to collect to craft things like the key, new items, new spells, etc. In order to get everything, you'll have to battle enemies multiple times and thus repeat the same song multiple times - particularly if you aren't getting the drop you need.
[*] It's extremely uninteresting to fight the same enemy a bunch of times, particularly if you are able to defeat them relatively quickly and are just hearing the beginning of the same song over and over again
[*] I got to the second floor and the one enemy is using the same song as the boss I just fought, which isn't too bad because I had only heard it once so far. But the other 2/3 enemies have recycled songs from the first floor that I probably already heard like 10 times each. That was a big disappointment.
[*] To craft items, you need to get the requisite materials and spend exp. The amount of exp you spend increases the success rate, up to a maximum of 95%. Thankfully you don't lose the materials if it fails, but you do lose the exp you spent, further contributing to the grind.
[*] It sucks that at the start of battles all of your spells have to finish charging up (they have a cooldown at the start of battle and between uses). You're often not even really having to defend much in this time, so it's just dead time where you can't really do anything.
[*] I think I would've preferred it if the spell system was slightly more forgiving/rewarding than it is. After you start a spell you either successfully clear all the notes and cast the spell or you don't. I wish there were more nuance to it where maybe you could crit or have a chance of some special effect for getting it perfect but that if you missed 1 note it didn't necessarily fail the entire thing, because then you're just on cooldown. Especially early on in the game you just might not have that many other offensive options so you're just sitting around waiting again. 
[*] The game tries way too hard to be funny but just makes me cringe. I'm not against vulgarity for the sake of humor but it just goes way over the top constantly in a way that's incredibly unfunny. One of the first things said is that your character's head is pounding like you were stabbed by a hobo. Shortly after there's a joke about date rape. Believe me, it just goes on and on. 
[*] The story is not that interesting from what I saw of it.

Bleh. I really wanted this game to be good.

I forgot to add the first time: the lag calibration only gives audiovisual feedback rather than taking a tempo tap input (though there's a bit that lights up if you push the controller button), and it seems to be kind of not enough. But then, that could just be bad calibration of the charts themselves? I'm not sure, but unless I adjust it to minus 50 or so, in a way which doesn't quite match the audiovisual, the beats don't quite line up in the actual game, which gets to be much more of a problem later. (Yeah, I know, DDR did that too, but.)

Oh, and it seems like if you hit a note, then are still holding the button when you switch boards, which is easy to do when you get to the harder levels because you will be switching boards a *lot*, then the original note doesn't count anymore?

First off, the writing is... not good. It is clearly someone’s earlier work and it detracts more than adds to the story. The protagonist is unlikable, his personality is 'snark' and 'blows up at people for little to no reason', and he is treated as the smartest being in existence by the story. Not the mention he sort-of supports eugenics. His ally only differs from him in the fact that she has her anger issues under control. The first boss is racist and the second is a quasi-racial stereotype. both are played for laughs, but both fall flat. There is this weird out of place rant against astrology that has more development than some of the characters.

The art is tolerable, but some of the characters look weird, like in proportions. the music is alright, at least the first few times you hear each song. 

Onto the gameplay. It starts decently enough. When you start the game, you are presented with three enemies and each one has a different soundtrack associated with it, then you get to the next floor, and find that some of the enemies there share music with enemies, and that really sets the tone for the rest of the game. 

The game feels stretched. The reused music, the forced grinding, the chance-based crafting, some of the enemy models are just reused and recoloured, to learn spells you need to play music that you have already heard many times before. The designer sat down and thought about how he could squeeze more hours out of the players. 

If you strip away all padding, the bad crafting system, everything that necessitates grind, any enemy that reuses assets, there are some good bones there. But unfortunately, everything that builds on the foundations makes it worse.

The game is a rhythm-based RPG which mixes a puzzle-like rhythm game and a very generic and base RPG system with loot, equips and stats, and the oh-so mandatory crafting system. 

The game offers you a safe room from which you can explore The Tower and fight enemies of your choice to grind resources, to craft equipment and spells (Generic attack also comes from a spell) and then make a key to open a door and get to a higher level.

The combat is spent on a 3-window screen, you change between them with the Q and E buttons. Directional arrows fall from the windows, each doing different things - defense window's arrows damage you if not pressed at the proper time, mana window's arrows recharge mana on hit, and you cast your spells by pressing all the correct arrows of the selected spell in the spell window.

One of my main problems was that the game tries to be ""hip"". Or ""radical"". By being so clever and sleek that it plays the self-awareness card, and the ""lame hero who got transported into world, and who has a woman sidekick who constantly mocks him"". 
Conveniently, she is  the narrator as well, who has a varied amount of knowledge, based on what the tutorial or plot requires. And she talks through only an ""intercom"" I think? I wouldn't be surprised if there'd be a reveal-surprise-twist later on the line.
Anyway, it was a bit jarring how many times various drugs were mentioned even before the tutorial, at one point the protagonist accusing the narrator of being a date rapist, which is a very, very weird tone one wants to set in a rhythm RPG with colourful and silly characters.

The final nail in the coffin was how tediously stupid menus are, and how often button presses do not get recognised in battles. Not super often, more like 1/10-20 times, but it adds up, and makes the game feel really sloppy.

Likely there's an okay, tolerable game under the surface, but it's just not fun to play for me.",1609544882,1609583576,False,13,0,0.603327393531799316,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It has a lot of charm, is witty, and has an interesting concept. I would also suggest just playing through it without the use of a guide that shows you everything, it's much better that way. Right now I still cannot play on the hardest difficulty, Spasmodic, but I can get through Hard just fine. It offers a decent challenge and has an interesting story with secrets to be found throughout. It has a pretty deep battle system that allows for many different types of play, which you may just find yourself constantly tweaking as you go. Which I enjoy, it doesn't trap you into one set role.

That being said it isn't perfect. It does have a bit of a grind and there aren't an overabundance of enemies, but that's something hard to really fault it on. Given the time it came out and the small team behind it. It is impressive none-the-less.

I've been having a great time playing this again, it took me around 30 hours to fully complete initially. If a rhythm RPG sounds like something you'd be interested in I'd suggest picking it up. With the sale prices it's a steal in all honesty.

The game tries to claim there's strategy involved, but because enemy attack patterns (not their attack charts) aren't consistent you can't plan to cast spells during specific parts of a song.

[h1]OVERALL SCORE: 8/10[/h1]

Before the Echo is a strange game, a mashup of rhythm games like DDR or UtaPri with an RPG. It sounds like an odd combination, but it's actually wickedly fun once you get the hang of the system.

In the game, you play as Ky, a graduate student trapped in a deadly game. He's forced to fight seven bosses in The Tower, for unknown reasons. Through the game, we get banter primarily between Ky and Naia, a woman tasked with guiding him through the tower, and the various bosses. The rest of the tower is chocked full of enemies you must farm for ingredients used to make stronger weapons, spells, and key items.

Combat is super fun. It also gets varied per floor, as each of the bosses has a unique talent that changes the game. For instance, one boss speeds up the arrows, another one hides some of the game boards from you, and so on. It kept things interesting and I was always wondering what the next challenge would be. 

Overall, I thought this game was super fun and I quite liked the system once I got the hang of it. My only complaint is the number of songs. Each floor of the tower has three enemies, each with three items of various drop rates. In order to get the items and experience points, there is a certain amount of farming needed. And while the songs are good and work well for the game, there's just not enough of them to keep it interesting. What's more, although a couple new songs are introduced through fighting bosses, most of the songs end up being recycled several times. It gets tiresome. I would have liked a more expansive song list for sure.

The other issue with the game that I had was the animations that play after you cast a spell. The combat is done purely by casting spells, which is done by successfully hitting a number of arrows based on the spell's requirements. When you do succeed, an animation will flash onscreen. However, some of them take time to dissipate and they end up clouding the screen. If you're casting multiple spells in succession, this can throw you off and make it difficult to see the arrows. I'm not sure if that was intentional as an added bit of challenge, but it could be frustrating from time to time.

Despite some issues, I definitely recommend this game. The story is enough to keep you interested and the battle system is great, despite some minor issues.",1577059165,1577059512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Больше всего люблю игру за самое базовое, что в ней есть. Постоянно навевает мысли о замечательном Rock Band Unplugged с PlayStation Portable, только тут партия у ""инструмента"" никогда не заканчивается - каждую секунду нужно решать, что будет лучше, защищаться, атаковать или копить ману. Лайк!

В общих чертах со стороны РПГ тоже получилось хорошо. Именно в общих.
Большинство минусов, за которые хотелось кого-нибудь придушить, касаются именно конкретных аспектов жанра ролёвок. Но не все. Интересно получилось, что одна проблема стабильно вытекала из другой в последовательности ниже:

0. Ограниченный, умеренно яркий саундтрек
Если бы каждый трек в игре встречался единожды, и не было нужды постоянно переигрывать те же уровни с прикреплённой конкретной песней, он бы в итоге не так утомил. А так, право слово, кроме ""Loui"" тут особо ничего слушать больше одного раза и не хочется! Настолько треки... среднестатистические, что ли. Не выделяются ну ничем.
Собственно, вытекает этот пункт из следующего...

1. Гринд
Это ужасно. Тебе постоянно нужно переигрывать уровни, чтобы у одного и того же врага (а иногда он от другого может халтурно отличаться только цветовой палитрой спрайта!) с надеждой на успех ждать выпадение необходимого предмета.
Снова. И снова. И снова. И снова. Потому что...

2. Сломанный генератор случайных чисел.
Я готов поклясться, что он нарочно подкручен вниз. Честное слово. Ну не могу я сейчас сидеть ровно в той из Мультивселенных, где с врага, у которого предметы с шансом выпадения >~90%, НЕСКОЛЬКО РАЗ НЕ ПАДАЕТ НИ ЧЕ ГО.
Это практически невозможно. В Мультивселенную мне поверить сложнее, чем в ""подкапотное"" издевательство генератора.
Собственно, а чего так эти случайные числа тут нужны?...

3. ПЛАТНОЕ изучение спеллов и крафт предметов. 
Любая крафтовая вещь, что должна тебе улучшить жизнь, сразу при создании её усложняет.
Хочешь спелл - сбрось текущий уровень наполовину, т.е. выкинь последние полчаса жизни в помойку.
Хочешь предмет? ЗАПЛАТИ за ПОВЫШЕННУЮ ВЕРОЯТНОСТЬ УСПЕХА его скрафтить. Причём с ростом по экспоненте. Ах, не любитель рисковать и пытаешься скрафтить с дефолтным 50%? Нет, чувак, здесь 50% - это как минимум в 2 раза меньше. Соси.
И из-за этой клоунады ты постоянно чувствуешь, как [i]искусственно отодвигаешься назад от завершения игры[/i].

Мой вам совет: когда дойдёте до 7 этажа и упрётесь в стену гринда, не мучайте себя любимого, а взломайте опыт на пару уровней наверх. Стыдно не будет. Всё равно вы потеряете его [i]не из-за челленджа, а из-за местного ""Однорукого бандита""[/i].

Минусы вне РПГ - графика и сюжет.
Визуально тут всё такое простое, невзрачное. Во время геймплея на статичном фоне стоят статичные модельки, иногда меняющие спрайт в зависимости от ситуации. Оболочки игровой зоны светятся в так. Нажатые стрелки мило поднимают столб света. При этом хочется оценить неплохо анимированные спеллы.
И всё.
Настолько всё беззубо, статично и спокойно, что аж грустить начинаешь. Алло, авторы! Это МУЗЫКАЛЬНАЯ ИГРА! Тут должно быть обязательно ВЕСЕЛО! ЖИВО! МОЛОДЁЖНО! МОДНО! Вы Beat Saber видели? А первоисточник тщательно изучали, DDR/PIU/Stepmania?...

Сюжет...какой-то нарочно запутанный, что ли. Сначала твист понравился, но чуть позднее, в той же бесконечной длины катсцене он ничего особо и не дал. Ну типа немножко объяснил всё происходящее. Дал такую себе в итоге концовку. А закрываешь игру с чувством обмана или незавершённости, наверное. Трудно описать точно.

If you've ever played a rhythm game before, then you know for the most part what to expect. Arrows will fly down the screen and you must hit the corresponding buttons on time to succeed. This game does have some different mechanics that set it apart though.

When fighting monsters, you have three different fields that you can switch back and forth through. There is a mana field, a spell field, and a defense field. Each field has a different purpose.

The defense field is your main one. If you don't match the rhythm on this field, you lose health. You want to make the enemy lose all their health before you lose yours. This is where the spell field comes in.

In Before the Echo, you have the ability to craft spells and then use them in battle. With the spell field, you don't have to interact with it until you cast a spell. Once you cast a spell, the arrows will show up on the spell field. If you mess up hitting the arrows, then the spell is not cast and you must recharge it again. If you hit them correctly, you cast the spell.

Lastly, there is the mana field. Arrows will be falling down this field all battle. You get no penalty for not hitting them. You only use this field if you need to collect mana to cast spells. Once you collect enough mana, you can ignore the field until you need mana again.

Maintaining all three fields in a tactical way is the main focus of battle.

It sounds complicated but it's very simple. You can see all three fields at all times and it's very easy to switch between them.

There were a few reviews complaining about a large amount of grind you had to do. I personally didn't have this problem since I barely had to grind. In the game, you have to get items from each monster before entering the next level. I always got the items fairly quickly, but there is a small amount of grind for people who don't like that sort of thing.

Another positive about the game is the voice acting. It's far from perfect but It was apparent the devs enjoyed doing it. (It's especially apparent in the after game credits.) The story is interesting and there are plenty of goofy and entertaining characters.

Overall, if you need another rhythm game to scratch your itch, then Before the Echo is a good choice. It has some flaws. It could use a larger monster and music variety (the music is just so-so) but it's a well-made game with a lot of love put into it. It's currently on sale for a dollar so I recommend it if you enjoy rhythm games!

Before the Echo is a story-driven rpg rhythm game that defies expectations with its colorful artwork and attention to detail. Although you should not expect the utmost fidelity, the game is easily worth the cost. The story follows Ky as he journeys through a mysterious tower and meets quirky allies and enemies. While the story is relatively straight-forward, the game flows at a comfortable pace such that the story is neither short nor overly long and thus boring. The game loop is relatively simple-grind materials from monsters to craft items to prepare yourself for the floor boss before moving forward. However, the grind is relatively painless (most materials you should be able to get from 1-3 battles) and the variety in music and monsters covers this mechanic well. Moreover, the game is entirely voice acted (a major surprise and feat for such a cheap games) and fits well within the world. One weakness of the game is the battling and UI though, although simple enough, the weak graphics jar with the otherwise well-crafted characters and backgrounds.

Pros:
* Game is relatively simple and easy to pick up.
* Cheap - easily get what you pay for
* Music is good, while not the most memorable it will stick with you in the moment.
* Artwork is great, everything blends well and looks great.
* Voice acting is surprisingly fantastic (and the game is fully voice acted).
* Did not experience any bugs!

Cons:
* UI is below average and while functional, not particularly enticing.
* Battling graphics/effects follow this trend, while readable they are fairly weak and look somewhat unpolished.
* There is a grind to the game that does artificially increase game length (though it handles it better than most other games) 

Before the Echo may appear at first to be a cheap indie game, but looking beneath the hood and spending time with it showcases the amount of love and support that went into crafting it. The passion and effort shows in the high-quality of such a inexpensive game. Rhythm games may not be for everyone, but the barrier to entry to this game is very low.

The gameplay consists of hitting inputs at the right time though 3 different grids: one to cast spells, another to recover mana (to cast more spells) and another to defend yourself from enemy attacks. Also, you can only be on one grid at a time, so you’ll be juggling between them a lot. Those are the basics of the game. For progression, you have the standard RPG stuff, in which you level up to get stronger and also you can gather, craft, and equip better and better equipment. A key difference is that you don’t have money here. Instead, you spend your XP to craft new items. Likewise, selling unwanted items nets you extra XP. This means there’ll be times where you’ll actually decrease a level or two, but that doesn’t detract from the experience. However, crafting items isn’t a guaranteed success, so you’ll be gambling your XP and sometimes you’ll get nothing. It’s frustrating at times, and the main problem I have with the game. For example, to learn the various spells you also have to gamble XP, but the success or not depends entirely on your skill. You can even practice it first in a simpler rhythm minigame. The spell variety is also nice. Also, the game is a bit grindy, especially if you want to have everything in your possession. You’ll be fighting the same enemies over and over. But these design decisions are only a bit annoying, and won’t ruin your experience with the game. The songs are pretty cool, but the game would benefit from a few more. The art style didn’t impress me, but I enjoyed the story and, for an indie title, the voice acting was surprisingly good. You’ll want to keep playing to see who it all plays out. Also, there’s a few secrets, including voiced credits. And that’s how you keep people interested in the credits! The game is cheap, lasts around 10-15 hours, and I can recommend it.

Crypt of the Necrodancer and others came later, but none integrate the rhythm game as well with their respective genres. Crypt, for instance, just makes rhythm another layer of difficulty on top of a roguelike. Before the Echo bases its combat on rhythm, but in ways that scale. What I mean by this is that when you cast a spell, you input some moves. You block by inputting moves. You regain mana by inputting moves. But all this happens in realtime so you have to prioritize what you're doing. Can you block that red attack in the space between two streams of your own spell? Can you grab a little extra mana during that block string? That's up to you as a rhythm game player. It would've been so easy to take a standard JRPG and just make dance inputs, so that every attack is like Sabin's blitzes from FF6. Instead it did something way more interesting and better integrated.

On the other hand, the story is weak, the progression is highly linear, and the playtime is padded out by a moderate amount of grinding.

The RPG/rhythm mix was unexpected, but appreciated. The game has crisp graphics and artwork, witty writing (the biggest plus in my opinion), and great voice acting. The biggest downside is the scarce amount of tracks avaliable to choose from, but it is an understandable issue. It gets a bit repetitive.

I can see what they were trying to do heree but the execution has not really worked. Story tries to flip between intriguing and campy schlock but it does not succeed in either completely makig it feel lack lustre.

The attempt to make a story based, RPG, rhythm game is admirable but the problem with this combination of genres is that none feels fully satisfying. There are not enough songs and you are asked to grind songs to gain items to craft more items to move on to further levels. Grinding a song should not be enforced but should be enjoyable and it is not to me which leads on to one of my main complaints.

The way the rhythm game works is flawed. There is not enough feedback to let yoou know if you have hit a note or not which is a tad frustrating (not as bad at this as some othr games). However the mechanic of flipping between three rhythm tacks (think a 3 instrument song in something like Rock Band Blitz or Frequency/Amplitude) would be fine if there was a feeling of groove which continued between tracks but with the randomly generated button promps (at least in terms of directioon) it is impossible to achieve this.

All this being siad - I do not hate the game it just needs some improvements in too many areas for me to be able to recommend it.

아니 스팀에 이런 리듬 게임이!
상당히 참신한 아이디어가 들어간 게임입니다. 리듬 게임적 요소는 단순히 w·a·s·d 키로 내려오는 화살표를 맞추는 것이지만 여기에 공격, 마나, 스킬 패널을 더해 전략적 요소가 더해졌습니다. 좌·우 화살표 키로 입력 패널을 옮겨가며 체력을 사수하고 마나를 충전하고 스킬을 시전하여 적을 물리치는 방식인데, 적어도 제 기억엔 처음인 방식이네요. 그래서 추천과 비추천 사이에서 고민을 상당히 많이 했는데 후술할 문제점이 너무 커서 결국 비추천을 주게 되었습니다. 좋았던 점은 아래와 같습니다.
[list]
[*]상술한 참신한 게임 방식.
[*]예측하기 힘든 스토리. 히든 엔딩의 반전은 오히려 뻔했는데 게임의 배경이 되는 곳의 정체에 관한 내용은 주인공과 함께 저를 데꿀멍 시키더군요.
[*]성우 연기가 좋은 편입니다. 엔딩 크레딧에 따르면 연극 배우인 분도 있는 것 같고 크게 거슬리는 점 없이 스토리에 몰입시키더군요. 또한 엔딩 크레딧이 참신하다면 참신하다고 할 수 있습니다. 저는 처음 본 방식인데... 유튜브 댓글을 빌리자면 heartwarming합니다.
[/list]
이렇게 보면 좋은 게임인데... 문제는 리듬·게임으로서의 문제점이 다소 큽니다. heartwarming한 엔딩 크레딧 때문에 고민했지만... 역시 추천을 하기엔 무리가 있네요. 아래의 점들이 꽤 아쉬웠습니다.
[list]
[*]타격감 제로의 리듬 게임. 키음이 없어서 그런지 리듬감이 크게 중요하지 않습니다. 맞게 치는지 조차 알 수 없고 싱크도 다소 맞지 않아 리듬 게임의 기본이 부족합니다. 싱크의 경우 다소 빠르게 치는 것은 미스 처리, 늦게 치는 것은 콤보 처리라 뻘미스를 강하게 유발시킵니다.
[*]레벨 밸런스 문제. 총 7층으로 구성된 스테이지의 레벨 곡선이 6층에서 급격히 휘어집니다. 1~5층은 반대로 너무 완만합니다. 그러다 7층에서의 파밍이 어느 정도 이루어지면 그냥 맞으면서 공격만 해도 적이 죽을정도로 확 꺾입니다...
[*]운빨 노가다 요소. 사실상 가장 큰 비추천 이유입니다. 각 층마다 레시피가 주어지고 적을 물리치면 나오는 전리품을 모아 필요한 물품을 제작하는 방식인데, 다음 층으로 가기 위한 열쇠 외에 각종 스킬 스크롤, 무기, 방어구 등의 레시피도 주어집니다. 몬스터당 세 종류의 재료를 주어진 확률에 따라 드랍하며, 층당 몬스터는 총 세 종류가 있으니 총 아홉 종류의 재료가 층마다 있는데 필요한 재료는 귀신같이 안나옵니다. 예를 들어 80%·60%·30% 확률이고 80%짜리 재료가 필요할 때면 60%·30%짜리 재료가 나오는 식입니다. 물론 하나도 안나올 때도 있습니다. 60%짜리가 필요한데 80%·30%짜리만 나오기도 합니다. 몇몇 층은 가장 확률이 낮은 재료를 많이 요구하기도 합니다. 결과적으로 세 종류 뿐인 몬스터를 지겹게 계속 때려잡아야 하는 것이지요.
이에 더해 재료를 다 모으면 끝이냐? 아닙니다. 합성 과정을 거쳐야 하는데, 합성에 필요한 것은 다름 아닌 경험치입니다. 최대 95%까지 성공률을 본인이 정할 수 있으며 올릴수록 소모 경험치도 점차 크게 증가합니다. 대충 75% 선에서 맞추면 대부분 성공하는데 그래도 이게 또 간혹 터지면 한숨이 나옵니다. 다행인 것은 합성에 실패한다고 재료가 없어지진 않는다는 것이고 후반으로 갈수록 레벨과 경험치는 크게 중요해지지 않는다는 것입니다.
[/list]

[h2]도전과제[/h2]
만약 100%를 노린다면 저 운빨 노가다 요소가 엄청난 짜증을 유발시킵니다. 획득 방법이 재밌는 도전과제도 많지만 수집 관련 도전과제가 다 쌈싸먹습니다. 도전과제 중에 모든 레시피 합성 및 모든 스킬 배우기가 있어서 파밍을 지겹게 해야 하며(스크롤 레시피 및 몬스터 드랍 스크롤도 존재) 최후반부의 스킬은 획득 조건이 97% 정확도에 변속도 있는 곡 연주+1회 시도에 경험치 1만 이상이라 은근히 힘들 수 있습니다. 다만 게임 난이도에 대한 도전과제는 없어서 이지~하드 정도의 난이도로 하면 실력이 부족해서 따지 못하는 도전과제는 없습니다. 파밍이 겁나게 짜증날 뿐이지...
다만 노가다랑 별개로 상당히 참신한 도전과제가 하나 있습니다. 제4의 벽을 건든다는 표현이 적절한지 모르겠는데, 아무튼 위의 단점들에도 불구하고 게임을 추천해야 한다면 스토리와 함께 이 도전과제를 이유로 들 수 있겠네요.",1510856092,1606144834,False,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The core gameplay is exceptional. Rhythm and RPG are a surprisingly effective combination, with the game rewarding good spell and tactical choices as much as mastery of the rhythm mechanics.

HOWEVER

The story is, at best, cringe-worthy and cliche, written by someone who clearly thinks they are incredibly clever. There's a few good moments, but nothing that's worth it. So, if you play it, after the tutorial, skip every single cutscene and rush through every single bit of dialogue.

And expect a lot of grinding for random drops. You need drops to craft items, and you need XP to craft them. But you don't just spend XP, you choose how much XP you spend to improve your CHANCE of crafting that item. So even once you have all the materials, a couple of unlucky breaks and you're back to grinding again. The worst thing about it is that there is actually a much better mechanic for it ALREADY IN THE GAME. When you learn a spell, you pay a certain amount of XP to take a short trial, and if you succeed, you get the spell. Why couldn't this have been done with items? To pad for time! Of course.

In summation: Before the Echo is a fantastic core game with an awful story and a lot of grinding. Once upon a time, when this was $30? I'd never recommend it to anyone. Right now, at $5?

I played this game a second time and stopped at level 6.  

And yet I'm going to give this a thumbs up.  Before the Echo is what happens if you take DDR and make the player use the controller (So Stepmania), approach it from a multi lane system (like frequency or amplitude) and then add in RPG elements (puzzle quest). 

And the end result is... well pretty impressive.  The game is played like an RPG, with the main character exploring floors.  Well ""Exploring"" in reality he chooses one of three monsters on each floor to fight, and is sent to a combat screen. 

The combat in this game will be recognizable to anyone who has played a rhythm game before.   You press buttons to trigger different directions on three grids, each doing a different task.  If you are on the defense grid, you're blocking attacks, if you're on the mana grid you're gaining mana, and if you're on the spell grid you're casting your magic.  And you'll be switching between the three grids as you play the game.   

There is also a similar mini game to learn spells.  The entire time there's quality music being played, a selection created specifically for this game, and while I won't be humming these songs later, the music is enjoyable.

There's also a rather solid story to this game, the player is locked in a tower with 7 floors and must reach the top level to ... well honestly I don't know because I never reached there, however the first 6 floors had a relatively engaging story, even a few twists that worked well.

However the first problems with the game is around the 5th level the game gets annoyingly tedious.  Enemies get too much life, and there's a time limit to every battle (the length of the song) but they also start throwing VERY powerful attacks that the player.  Wait long enough for a really good spell? Well you might have to choose between taking massive damage (20 points where you might have less than 150 total points) or skipping that spell that's lost forever and needs to be recharged

On top of this, the enemies start having 3 digits of life, usually more than the player, and they will be punishing. 

There's even four difficulties of the game which is a good start, it does add notes and movements to songs, and that's a cool feature, but even on easy, the sixth level is tedious.  In fact it's always tedious. It's not impossible, but... well then there's the other part of the game, crafting. 

At first the crafting system is cool and new.  You kill monster get items (up to three different items per enemy, though on item per type)  and then can make stuff out of it.  On Level 1 there's only 4 or 5 craftable items.  Each level adds 1 more recipe, so level 6 has around 10 recipes, by that point you either have played entirely too much of the previous levels, or you got sick of them and have a ton of unmade recipes in your inventory.  

But the problem is every drop only comes from one monster.  If you don't like fighting the insect on level 6 (A decently fast and hard fight)  too bad, you have to.  And the other side of that is you don't fight him once, you will have to fight him two or three times just to progress because the key to the next level is craftable to, and even more if you want to make everything.  

So even if you somehow beat him you'll have to go and grind him again and again which is where the real tedium comes in, and that's assuming you don't get unlucky and miss a potential drop (as each drop has a percentage chance to appear).   It artificially lengths the game in the worst way.

The other side of this system is that while the player gets more powerful as he plays, he doesn't feel more powerful because the enemies on each floor are significantly more powerful too.  When I went back and fought someone from level 1 I realized how much of a god I had become, but you only get that feeling if you return to very early floors, on level 6 you feel like you're the same weakling you always were. 

However with that being said, I LIKE the core gameplay of this game.  I like the concept, I even like the story, I really like everything in it, that it hurts me that I just didn't want to finish it.  It is a really terrible feeling to say ""I wanted to see it, but I can't stand the monotony. "" Yet that's where I ended up. 

So I recommend it, because I did put in some good hours into it, and it is a really fun game and concept.  Just realize if you aim to beat the game, you WILL be grinding, and not in a mindless way due to the combat structure. 

Sad but overall a good game.",1503703405,1503709285,True,10,0,0.637201309204101563,1,True,False,False,False,,,

As a very experienced and advanced Dance Dance Revolution, Osu, and Stepmania player, I tend to fly through many rhythm games, especially those involving arrows. However, I was on the medium setting, and the game was challenging for me. The challenge is in the arrows, of course, but it is more so in the strategy of the game, such as navigating between the arrow screens, casting spells at the right time, making sure you have enough mana, trying to defeat the enemy before time ran out, not getting hit, and balancing experience points, as the experience points are also currency for synthesizing and crafting items. 
I loved that mechanic of the game because it was not a set value to craft an item, but instead you can decide how many experience points to use. The higher you want your probability of success to be, the more exp you sacrifice. The probability also caps at 95%, so there are no free rides. It's a good way to keep people battling and playing and makes one think carefully before deciding what to create. Quite a few times, I had to go down a level to create something I needed. I also liked how in this game, you have to accept that you will lose hp in battle in order to defeat the enemies. This is not a huge deal because all your stats reset after every battle.
The story itself was also very original, although it didn't get very deep until the end. When it did get deep, though, it went far. There are a lot of twists that are less predictable than I had anticipated, and the plot gets into the nitty-gritty of what's going on while still keeping secrets.
Playing for acheivements does actually expand gameplay, and there are quite a few little secrets in the game that lead to one large secret. 
The voice acting and audio are beautiful. The voice actors were pretty talented, and the audio was high-quality. The music during the rhythm battles was a bit underwhelming to me as a ddr player and sounded more like background music, but it was very well produced and some songs were cool. It made sense in the context of the game. The art was beautiful, too. I think the aesthetic fit the game very well, and the main characters and enemies are well-done and very pleasing.
I highly recommend this game to people who like rhythm games like DDR, Stepmania, and Osu, as well as people who just like RPG-style battles or intense games.

One of my favourite parts was actually the credits, as they were narrated and really cute while also providing some behind the scenes information. I really think more games should do that as it made the credits both fun and informative.

Getting all the achievements took me a while due to ""Erudite"" and ""Lies Within Lies"" but this meant it was really satisfying when I finally got them. It isn't necessary to get these to enjoy the game though, if you don't want the hassle.

The story is... interesting. I go between thinking it's great and thinking it's dumb so you're just going to have to make up your own mind about it.

The music is fun, and I especially like Piano Jam as a song even if it was the main reason I found those two achievements so difficult. Of course it depends on your taste of music whether or not you'll like the soundtrack.

I would say that upon getting Lies Within Lies [spoiler]the hidden ending was a bit disappointing given how much time I spent trying to defeat the other Ky in order to see it - I'd just assumed that Shira was a part of the whole scheme anyway so this didn't really give me any new information. It's also not really made clear why she was necessary to the tower's plan other than possibly ""psychological factors"" or whatever. Now if we had found out the thing that is revealed in the sequel There Came An Echo (I won't spoil it if you don't already know) then it would have felt more worthwhile.

В общем, нравится мне тыкать кнопки под музыку. Поэтому, естественно, спустя некоторое время наткнулась на Before the Echo или Sequence, как эта игра называлась первоначально. Сразу перейду к моментам, которые считаю нужным отметить.

Итак, плюсы:
1. Графика, рисовка, картинка, называйте как хотите, в общем, игра не режет глаз. Не могу не отметить, что значительная часть ритм-игр, которые мне попадались, выглядит как кошмар эпилептика, то есть всё такое кислотное и неоновое, я это переношу, но не очень люблю. А здесь этого нет. Так что моим глазам в данном случае было приятно.
2. Есть сюжет. Не берусь судить, насколько он хорош, но меня вполне устроил. Даже секретная концовка есть. 
3. Интересная система боя. Можно кастовать заклинания, можно защищаться, можно ману набирать. И всё это тыкая кнопки под музыку. Что может быть лучше? Для меня это было в новинку, так что всё понравилось.
4. Есть, как бы это сказать, система крафта, что ли. То есть, чтобы перебраться на следующий этаж, нужно не просто тупо перебить всех монстров, а создать ключ к двери из того, что падает с монстров. Плюс к этому можно делать различные бонусы для себя.
5. Озвучка. Хочется отдельно отметить актёров озвучки. Они молодцы. В конце даже титры представлены в виде разговора, было очень интересно их слушать.

Минусы:
1. Мало треков. Драка с каждым монстром сопровождается чётко заданной мелодией, но при этом к нескольким монстрам привязан один и тот же трек. 
2.Местами однообразно. Некоторые предметы выпадают крайне редко, из-за чего приходится постоянно мучать одного и того же монстра. Соответственно, играть на одном и том же треке, что несколько надоедает.
3. В начале игры наш ""пастух"", который ведёт нас по этажам загадочной башни, говорит что-то вроде: ""Старайся нажимать клавиши в соответствии с ритмом музыки, а не только визуально"". Однако мне показалось, что стрелки часто не попадали в ритм. А когда кастуется заклинание, там об этом вообще и речи не идёт.

В общем, игра не затронула потаённые струны моей души, музыка не произвела большого впечатления, но я приятно провела время. Что ещё нужно? Рекомендую любителям ритм-игр.

You use DDR style mechanics to cast powerful spells, restore your mana, and block incoming attacks as you make your way through the increasingly dangerous dungeons. The characters are really likeable, and I found myself enjoying the story way more than I expected. The villains in particular are quite entertaining, and while I won't spoil them here, you're likely to remember them long after you stop playing this game. The mechanics here are rock solid, and the difficulty curves quite nicely at each level. I mostly played on normal, since I sadly don't have the time to practice enough to master the hardest difficulties, but there's definitely enough value for both hardcore rhythm gamers and players new to the genre who want to see what it's all about. If you are new to rhythm games, be aware that grind is an essential part of the experience. You're going to be fighting the same monsters time and time again on each level to unlock the items you need, and the drop rates ensure that there's a random element that can halt your progression and add some frustration. In another game, this would be a huge negative, but rhythm games are based on the idea that you're going to play the same levels over and over again to master them. I never found the grind to be an issue, but I also beat Knights of Cydonia on Expert in GH3. My tolerance is pretty high for this kind of thing.

基本算是一口气打下来的
Before the Echo是一款音乐+RPG的游戏
主角Ky醒来突然发现自己在一个奇怪的塔里
在引导员Naia的指导下
打败每一层的守卫和怪物
通过七层的塔最终获得自由

先说硬伤：

一、独特的战斗系统
感觉不是所有人都能喜欢或者说接受
（我一直用手柄，不太清楚键盘是怎么样）
战斗全靠在节拍点按↑↓←→来控制
LT和RT来切换窗口
摇杆滑动切换技能
LB和RB使用技能
三个窗口
一个是敌人的攻击，可以通过按键躲避
一个是靠不停下落的箭头积攒能量
一个是你使用了技能，需要正确按键来施放技能，漏按一个能量就白费了，技能也放不出来
听起来很复杂
教程也是啰嗦的一比
玩起来适应了其实还好
后期经常会有几个按键同时按的情况
不过熟悉+手快的话
可以无伤把敌人K.O

二、素材少
音乐重复率实在太高了
最开始我还以为是我听错了- -
后来才发现真的一共没几首歌
这对一个音乐游戏来说实在是。。。
虽然歌都挺带感的
但我是个刷级刷怪刷材料的强迫症患者
真·听到吐
很多怪物的图也在重复利用
不要以为换个颜色我就不认识你了魂淡！

三、判定、设定方面的问题
其他评测也有提到
这个游戏有的时候判定过于严格了
有的时候又莫名松
不知道是不是因为音乐节拍的问题
主要是后来有的技能要连按对10个键
所以有的时候因为判定施放失败
就 会 很 气

有的设定也不太可爱
1、比如技能施放完的效果图
挡视野啊！
自己人啊兄弟！
你别挡我放下一个技能啊！（虽然这点可以在设置取消）
2、学习新卷轴的要求太烦
首先你要消耗一部分经验值
其次是在一首歌里完成指定要求
要求分两种
连击多少
一首歌下来准确率百分之多少
前者也就忍了，虽然最多要150的连击好像
后者。。。
我学个卷轴你让我弹个4分多钟的曲子。。。
不是达不到或者难达到
是真烦啊
3、经验值系统
积攒经验值→升级→属性增加
这个没什么好说的
但这个游戏的经验还要用来学习卷轴、合成物品
经验值投入越多，物品合成的成功率越高
投入多了你的等级还会倒退你敢信
我这样的人就会陷入刷刷刷的地狱
4、这游戏不能截图

再说优点
游戏全程良心配音
结尾还有把配音演员什么的拉出来唠家常hhhh
对话！
非！常！逗！
特！别！逗！
Ky和Naia的互动萌我一脸
守卫也都超可爱
各种物品的介绍笑得不行
音乐很好听
特别有战斗的感觉hhhh
游戏最后的真相神作了hhh
我走过最长的路就是你的套路
作者的脑洞来的猝不及防
（不知道会不会有人认为是烂尾）

感觉整个游戏
作者都在用绳命在卖萌
不要有什么心理负担
也不用担心作者想搞个什么大事情
大概这个游戏设计的初衷
也就是让大家能轻松愉快的玩到底吧

总的来说
算是非常喜欢的作品
打折的话请务必入手玩玩看
我要去换个难度重开了0w-

----

The gameplay of Before the Echo involves swapping between three different screens of falling arrows to hit in the right rhythm. Each screen has a different effect - one is for generating mana with which to cast spells, one is for casting spells to damage your opponent or for a variety of other effects and the last one is to defend yourself from enemy attacks which deplete your hp.

The gameplay itself is quite good. The falling arrows are tracked well with the music on all the difficulties and swapping between screens adds an interesting multi-tasking and decision making aspect.

Where the game falls down is the RPG elements. You're given a bunch of recipes to craft which require materials dropped from battles. This involves repeating the same battles with the same music over and over again to get the required materials and then actually crafting the recipe has an experience point cost. In my two hours of playing I leveled from 1 to 4 and then back down to 1 again after having crafted all the items for the first floor and eventually finished on level 3 again at the start of the second floor. You can see why this is a problem.

By the time I arrived on the second floor I was looking forward to a new set of songs at least and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the three battles for that floor were all tracks I'd heard before. Two out of three tracks were songs I'd just spent an hour on for the previous floor. Exactly the same. The prospect of grinding more battles on songs I've already heard for item upgrades and character level downgrades made me uninstall right then and there.",1487939178,1487939178,False,7,0,0.541793704032897949,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Keep that in mind when reading this review.

Before the Echo is a very interesting approach to the genre. It combines RPGs and rhythm. During the game you equip your character with various equipment and spells and fight monsters.

Fighting monsters is accomplished by toggling between a magic, defense and mana field and trying to hit the arrows at the proper point. You will frequently find yourself choosing between recharging your mana, defending against enemy attacks, and using magic against the enemy.

This combat approach is very well implemented when using a controller. They obviously put a lot of thought into it, and it makes sense. 

The music is fine. It didn’t stand out as anything special to me. I didn’t really “feel” it though, so it was more a matter of watching the arrows than listening to the beat. This can probably be improved by ensuring your audio settings are correct. 

I have mixed feelings about the tutorial and plot. The tutorial accomplishes its purpose well, after playing through it, you know how to play the game. The plot consists of waking up in a tower, having a snarky/sarcastic woman tell you what is going on, and then fighting monsters to get a key to move to the next floor. I don’t know more than that, as the game quickly lost my interest. 

I was very glad we have the ability to skip the plot scenes. I found the character’s interactions very annoying. 

Despite being well designed, the game didn’t grab my interest. It felt like it was missing something. It is inexpensive enough that fans of the genre might as well give it a try, but casual players should look elsewhere.",1486496932,1486496932,False,7,0,0.55080336332321167,0,False,False,False,False,,,

That's where my praise of this game ends.

In one of the worst openings to any game I've ever played, we are immediately subjected to terrible dialogue with worse voice acting.  Every line is delivered awkwardly and with a shoehorned-in joke.  The writer goes out of their way to try to poke fun at RPG/gaming stereotypes, and not a single joke lands.  

If that wasn't bad enough, we're subjected to approximately 20 minutes of tutorials before we can even play the game.  A character even calls the game out on having too many tutorials, which begs the question why this was not fixed prior to release.

When we finally get to play the game, we find that we're in for a repetitive, non-stop grind.  Let's go through the steps it takes to learn a new spell:  1) grind multiple battles against one or more enemies. 2) craft the spell, which may fail, requiring repeat of step 1. 3) learn the spell, requiring you to play a mini-game, which is a more boring version of a regular battle, oh and by the way the song is the same song you heard 6-7 times during step 1.  What should be an exciting aspect of an RPG (learning a new spell, oh boy!) is instead reduced to a slog.  And that, in a nutshell, is Before the Echo.

First, progressing through the levels requires you to farm monster drops from the various enemies. Normally, this wouldn't be too bad but getting screwed by RNG never feels good in any game. After you finally get all of your materials to craft a key to progress, you spend experience to increase the chances that your crafting succeeds. The decision to implement F2P game design into this game is mind boggling. 

So after you spend all of your experience to craft your key, you end up losing levels and stats which makes you much less likely to be able to beat the boss. In a normal game you could just trust your skills to get you through the level. However, if you don't do enough damage to an enemy before the song ends then you end up losing the battle. I really wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. But the implementation of the rpg system and the horrible crafting system really made me hate it.

With the bad being said, I would still have to recommend this game. Even wth all of the systems that I really dislike, the game still has me enjoying the musical gameplay while frantically switching between the different styles.

unique gameplay

Another great thing is the simple graphics mean that it'll run on a laptop and can be quite fun on the move. Downsides are that the controls take some getting used to as they're slightly sluggish and some of the writing can feel overly forced. There's also a lot of grind involved, not just to level up equipment but just to clear the game due to the RNG nature of the crafting system. Finally, if you don't like the music you'll hate the game so might be a good idea to check out the OST on youtube beforehand.

Das Spielprinzip ist schnell erklärt: Von oben fallen rhytmisch Pfeile, die anzeigen in welche Richtung man drücken muss. Die erste Neuerung hier ist, dass es drei Spielfelder gleichzeitig gibt. Jedes Match ist ein Kampf gegen einen Gegner, es gibt demnach ein Verteidigungsfeld um Schaden auf einen selbst abzuwehren, ein Regenerationsfeld um Mana aufzulagen und ein Angriffsfeld um selbst Spells abzusetzen. Da man nur ein Feld zur Zeit „bearbeiten“ kann, kommt hier ein sehr anregender Multitasking Stress zu stande. Die zweite Neuerung sind die Spells. Man bestimmt hier selbst, wann welcher Spell verwendet werden soll, was dem Multitasking nochmal einen draufsetzt.

Spells und Ausrüstung müssen gefunden oder gecraftet werden. Die Grundzutaten dazu muss man sich erfarmen und dann auch noch das craften mit XP bezahlen. Daher ist wird das Spiel manchmal ein bischen grindlastig, war für mich aber noch aushaltbar.

Zu Story sag ich nur, dass die leicht SciFi angehaucht ist und mir sehr gefallen hat. Sie hat gerade die richtige Mischung aus Klischee und dem Spiel ebendamit getroffen um anregend genug zu sein doch immer mal wieder reinzuschauen.

Fazit:
Empfehlung für alle, die was für Rhythmusspiele übrig haben und etwas Grind aushalten können.

An interesting blend of RPG and rhythm game that works incredibly well.

Before the Echo is a game that combines the usual mechanics from rhythm games, where you have to press keys/buttons with the precise timing according to the music played, with elements from RPG games - leveling up, acquiring new gear, crafting, etc. And it does so very well. Basically, you have 3 screens - Attack, Defense and Mana. You use the Mana screen to recover Mana spent, the Attack screen to cast spells and the Defense screen to block incoming enemy attacks. To advance through the game, the player needs to know how to administer all three screens, changing between them whenever needed and using the proper timing to cast spells so that they're not cast at the same time an enemy attack is coming. The player can then learn new spells with varied effects like damage, damage over time, healing, creating a protective barrier, etc. The stronger the spell, the harder it is to cast it. Items improve the character's stats, making the character cause more damage, take less damage, recover more Mana, etc. Bosses have special abilities of their own that makes the battle harder.

At first, the story seems to be overly simplistic, but as the game develops and the story unfolds, it's revealed that there's a lot more to it. Characters are interesting and there is character development throughout the story and the voice acting is very well done.

For those who like a challenge, the game has four difficulty levels, with the hardest difficulty being for those lovers of rhythm games. The easiest difficulty still presents some challenge at later levels. (I actually had to reduce the difficulty to Easy for the last boss)

And, of course, the soundtrack - truly amazing. I would have expected a good soundtrack for a game that is heavily based on music, but even then, it surpassed my expectations.

Same went for the dialogues which are a bit cheesy, especially in the beginning but then you get into the story and it's all ok. I found the story interesting and mostly went to the end of the game for that. Oh and the voiced credits is a nice little bonus ^^.

As for the game mechanics, they mostly work well. You got stats to increase with stuff and level up, and spells to unlock and select for your build. The ""line"" selection during combats gives you control on how to spend your time and keystrokes.

Though, the main negative point I have with this game lie in the game design. I started the game in Hard mode because I'm used to rythm games, it gives a little challenge and at first it was all ok. But, as after floor 3 you can't change difficulty, I regretted that choice much later when I needed to unlock more spells and couldn't because it was too hard for me (struggling with keys and controller, more used to frets). So I finished the game with only 7 of the 20+ (?) spells unlocked. And I unlocked 2 of them out of necessity for the floor 7 boss and final boss.

The second complain I could make about the design of the game is about the final boss. On floor 7, once beat the boss of the level, you immediatly encounter the final boss and start the battle. There is a noticeable difficulty increase from the floor 7 boss. Therefore if you barely beat the previous boss, you can't beat the final boss and you have to go back and farm to level up and increase your stats. Also, because the damages notes are random, and in the battle the rythm of the song varies a lot, you end up in a total random fight when casting your spells and it ends up being infuriating. I lost my temper there with 20-30+ tries. I guess it's mostly because I didn't have the right spells unlocked but I was also struggling to unlock them.

So, could be a bit better on some points, but overall a good and enjoyable game with a nice story to it. Liking rythm games is recommended to play this one ;)",1473622711,1473622711,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's still a rhytm game - and if you don't enjoy things like DDR, Osu! etc. - you probably won't enjoy Before the Echo, either.

As a huge enthusiast of both mentioned genres, I enjoy the game greatly. I admit, the grinding tends to be quite monotous and gets boring after a while - then again, you don't have to be like me and craft every item possible. As long as you keep defeating different enemies, you shouldn't get easily bored. Humor and the story, though simple and there's not that much of it, make me want to keep going, if just for the sake of satisfying my - and main character's - curiosity about the place he got trapped in.

First of all, I adore indie games. I love the creativity and teamwork that comes with creating indie games, and they are my favorite genre to play and watch. I picked up this game on my queue during the Steam summer sale, but let me tell you, it's at least worth the five dollars standard price.

As an avid lover of rhythm games, I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of each level. The difficulty increased without overwhelming the player, and the spells come in a great variety that essentially allow the player to beat the game in their own style. The art style is consistent, entirely due to the fact that every visual was created by the same artist! And it's so very sweet on the eyes.

Moving on to the characters, I have to say that while it is a rather short game (I finished all achievements in around 2-3 hours, after resetting my glitched game, a result of an error on my part) and thus we don't get to see much in terms of character depth or development, the characters' presence was enough to add quality and personality to the game without taking away the mystery and shock of the plot (I loved each of the Guardians and applaud the voice actors, as well as the artist, for providing such animated spirit). The ending leaves several questions unanswered, and if you're ambitious enough to get the hidden ending, you get a taste of even more secrets yet to be revealed.

I couldn't put this game down. It was funny, intriguing, and the artwork and music are STELLAR!

Now, to be fair, the game did have some drawbacks. I feel like the characters were a bit flat, but, if you play the game, you'll figure out why they seem to be so...scripted. It is a short game (hence the low price), but the crew that worked on it was so small!

There are no color codes on the arrows themselves to tell you what beat the note is on.  So you have to go purely on listening to the music, and sometimes the arrows are just on really awkward notes or tones of the song, like a series of 16th notes where only a few of them have arrows on them.  Tack on that you are watching three sets of arrows at once instead of only 1, having to swap fields of arrows to be hitting, and apply strategic thinking to when to cast spells and what to cast SIMULTANEOUSLY and you need to be so good at something like Stepmania that you don't even have to think about the arrows.  You have to be able to do them almost completely subconsciously to keep up with this game (At least at the Hard difficulty level)  If you're that good, this game will knock your socks off.  It's incredibly fun.

The only real downsides to it come from sheer lack of variety.  The game has RPG mechanics for sure, and that includes trying to collect items with a % drop rate.  Meaning if you get unlucky (And you WILL get unlucky) you may be grinding the same exact monster for half an hour.  Which means the same damn song for half an hour straight.  What is worse, each monster does not have it's own song.  Some repeat.  This can get seriously old.

For 5$, this game is awesome.  Something I've never seen before and very well put together.  And at that price, the lack of variety is understandable.  Personally, I'd love to see a sequel, and would be happy to pay four times as much if they just make sure to really crank up the variety so the game isn't such an awful feeling grind at times.  The foundations of this game are rock solid.  It just needs a few more coats of paint.

Despite the game feeling a bit of a grind at times and the last couple of boss battles being infuriatingly difficult compared to the rest, Iridium Studios has cleverly morphed the humble rhythm game into a full-blown RPG and it surprisingly works well. Before the Echo has done for rhythm games what Puzzle Quest did for match-3 puzzle games and I like it. Before the Echo is highly recommended for lovers of rhythm games who want a bit more plot and strategy added to the mix.

Imagine an RPG style ""guitar hero like"" rhythm game. Got you hooked yet? 

Simply put, the player switches between 3 ""fields"" or screens (Defence, Spell, and Mana) while in game as arrows move down in each field. 

There's a great deal of multitasking involved because of casting spells, defending yourself, and gaining mana.

You win by draining the opponent's HP to 0 by casting damaging spells, but you can lose by losing all of your health or by not winning by the end of the song. It's a great game that keeps you on your toes and equipping the right spells. 

That being said, don't feel as though there are ""wrong"" or ""right"" spells to use. Some are better for certain levels or battles, but I've been able to use the spells that fit my playstyle.

藍色是補魔面板

If you're bad with coordination you might have trouble on the higher floors as switching quickly between the windows will become mandatory.

My two major gripes with the game are a lack of different soundtracks early on (luckily there will be more variety later on, and some of the soundtracks are amazing) and incredibly frustrating RNG at times. Both item drops and crafting items are based on a percentage, the latter costing experience which makes failing a little more frustrating. If you want to get everything, you WILL have to grind a bit.

It's not that the game is bad, rather that its an idea who's implementation seems inherently flawed.

The base mechanic of the game is the traditional ""press one or more of the 4 directions on the beat as instructed"". However, the twist is that you have three panels of arrows to rotate between and timing your presses correctly on them has different effects. There's your mana regen panel where each correct press earns you a little mana to cast spells. There's another that represents spellcasting where successfully landing a series of presses will cast a spell (more on this later). The last one represents defense where a sequence of arrows represents the enemy's attack; if you miss any here you take damage.

The problem is that the defense panel's arrows (i.e. the enemy's attacks) occur at random, but you have to manually trigger your spellcast sequences. You may already see the issue here: you build mana, cast an attack spell, and arrows start to fall in the spell cast panel and defense panel simultaneously. The game's prescribed cure for this is to constantly keep up a ""barrier"" spell which effectively mutes the enemy. So the game requires you to continually recast this barrier spell so that you can actually cast the spells you want in between each barrier cast. In my opinion this is a kludge of a game mechanic. You get involved with a whole lot of busy work just to occasionally do something meaningful. Perhaps it all gets a bit smoother with some practice, but whats to engage you enough to want to get that good?

I found a majority of the music to be ignorable at best. I've enjoyed some of Ronald Jenkees' music, but what's offered here I'd be reluctant to classify as even B-side music. The dialog is atrocious, the story is insignificant, and the graphics are the kind of crappy animatics that have now become standard fair in a sea of indie game dev mediocrity. The game would be perfectly suited for two hands on the keyboard, but I was forced into using a controller. (Oh I hope this wasn't just because I had a controller plugged into my PC; I'm not going back!)

Perhaps worst yet is that the game devolves into a grind as each enemy you face has the chance to drop (at most?) one of three items of increasingly rarer chances to drop. You can face an enemy multiple times (enjoying the same music each time!) to get all items from an enemy. Why? Did the game need a time sink like this? Again, its more poor game design that not only contributes nothing fun, but actually contributes frustration.

I really wanted to like this game. I had it on my wishlist as soon as it was released and bought it while it was still named Sequence. Despite the game's somewhat novel concept, it seems like the developer tried to throw a hodge-podge of ideas and twists at the rhythm genre, but just ended up with an overly-complicated and unfun mess.

Before the Echo (or Sequence as it was formally called) is essentially a dance dance revolution/stepmania RPG.   

Mechanics:
- In battle, you can switch between three ""dance"" screens (where you match the sequences given like in DDR). Each screen is useful for one of three things: Mana, Attack, or Defense. So in order to prevent damage to you, you match the sequence on the defense screen.  You also collect items and abilities that you can use during battle.

Another interestign mechanic is the game provides you ""recipies"" on each floor. In order to get the items needed to make something, you have to defeat an enemy. Then, to actually craft it, you get a 50% chance of success. To make it greater, you can sacrific XP 9and potentially level).  

Pros:
- Mechanics are fun
- Music is catchy (although can get redundant)
- Cool crafting system (although not terribly deep)
- You can level up above the necessary requirments if you feel like it to make it easier.

Cons
- Can get grindy",1453666420,1456125838,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not usually an RPG fan, but this game is enjoyable so far and there's no question that I'll see it through to the end.

As a long-time DDR/stepmania player, I stepped quite easily into hard mode.  The charts themselves are still pretty easy for me, and I can easily get 100% while unlocking spells.  However, during regular gameplay, coordinating switching between panes with hitting notes is a new and interesting challenge.

The biggest downside so far is the lack of content.  The soundtrack, while well-made, is extremely limited, and you'll end up hearing the same handful of songs over and over (so far maybe a half dozen songs in the first 4/7 floors of the tower, compared to dozens/hundreds in your average true rhythm game).  That coupled with the fact that I'm better than halfway through the game in under 4 hours suggests that this game won't have replay value.

Other thoughts:
- The art is somewhat low-res (720p?) and you can't change resolutions.  You can choose full screen or windowed though.  Not something I notice during gameplay, but nowadays I'd expect full HD (or preferably vector) art.
- So far I've only gotten one defensive spell and it's not that powerful.  There's a huge emphasis on attack-heavily-and-occasionally-heal with not much in the way of actually defending.  Some battles you can coast through without using the defense pane much at all, so it's not equally balanced throughout.
- A lot of the items/spells seem ignorable in general, unless you're a compulsive completionist like I am.
- Each floor of the tower has 3 different enemy battles (each with 3 different item drops), plus a boss battle.
- It's interesting that the item drop probabilities are shown, that way you can quantify how bad your luck is when grinding.  Sure, I got the 35% item in 3 of my last 4 battles, but I only got one of the 85% item that I need three of.  Haha.
- The boss battles don't seem to be replayable, but they do unlock new songs when you complete them that will be used in the higher levels of battle.
- Most people complaining about the name change (from ""Sequence"") have no idea how trademark law works, or why companies are obligated to protect their trademarks.

Overall, this game is well worth that 99c sale price, but it seems like something I'll play through once and then forget about.  I absolutely love the concept, but it needs more content for sure.",1451467077,1451467077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]If you are a fan of RPGs and rhythm games I highly recommend Before the Echo.[/b]

I've completed the first of seven levels and my impressions so far are positive.  The first thing the player is treated to is the banter between the protaganist and his unseen guide.  The voice acting is good and the dialogue is consistently amusing with the occasional chuckle-worthy highlight.

At each level the player is encouraged to create objects from recipes but the raw materials for each recipe are only acquired by defeating enemies.  The basic enemies drop one, two, or three different materials based on individual percentages so a specific drop is never guaranteed.  This requires the grind for which RPGs are famous.  The objects created from these recipes aren't required to progress in the game but because battles are resolved in fun rhythm challenges ala Dance Dance Revolution, why not obtain the materials to create the objects and try them out?

I was pleasantly surprised that the first boss I encountered was an Internet meme and my interest is only piqued to see what subsequent levels will bring.

背景设定比较一般。我们自认为是一般人的男主莫名其妙地穿越到一个奇怪的地方，受到谜之声的指引，不得不闯关用节奏战胜各种各样的敌人。
人物对话台词挺有趣，绝对不是敷衍随便写的台本。配音演员也十分卖力，语气情绪表现得很丰富。
游戏音乐不错，有激情、节奏感强。
人物的立绘还可以，动作表情都有，脸也不丑。但是敌人都是一脸苦逼，一点威慑力都没有。
虽然音游打怪的模式很新颖，但我打音游的主要目的还是享受音乐和节奏感，玩这个游戏的时候这方面的体验很不好。第一，它的目的主要还是战胜敌人，这就要求玩家要做即时决策，什么时候该放哪个技能、什么时候该回蓝，还要注意格挡，脑子在想这些的时候就没法很好的体验音乐；第二，很多时候战斗打完了一首歌才过一半，打音游不走完整首歌是我不能接受的，音乐放到高潮处戛然而止的落差感也让我很不舒服，而要听完整首歌就要冒着超时惩罚的风险，中间还有大段的空操作，没有紧张的战斗那种代入感；第三，每种敌人的音乐是固定的，大量刷同一种敌人的时候容易厌烦；第四，放技能、受到伤害等等音效太大声，而且比较长（超过了半个节拍），非常影响听歌。
总结：作为RPG游戏来说不错，但是作为音游来说体验不好，看来制作组对于RPG+MUG模式的尝试是花了很多心思，也确实遇到了很多困难，做了很多妥协。毕竟还是RPG游戏，更喜欢音游的玩家还是不要尝试了，推荐想体验另一种模式RPG的玩家玩玩这个。

One controls your spellsets, one is for defence, and the last one is for your mana pool. Missing an arrow in all but the mana field might cost you dearly!

[i][url=http://kingisaaclinksr.com/2015/11/29/a-paladins-review-before-the-echo-rhythm-and-rpg-genre-mixing-goodness/]Read the full & unabridged review A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/i]

[b]Preamble[/b]
Originally titled [i]Sequence[/i], [i]Before the Echo[/i] is the first game released by the indie devs Iridium Studios. It was later followed by [i]There Came An Echo[/i], a real time tactics voice controlled game released on Steam in early 2015. According to Before the Echo’s Steam Forums, they had a copyright claim thrown against them by another developer over their name. So, Iridium Studios had to rename Sequence to something else in order to avoid legal trouble. A rather unfortunate turn of events. However, I will say that Before the Echo might have been a better choice anyway, as Sequence isn’t particularly memorable for a name. I myself only discovered Before the Echo when There Came An Echo was released and got a lot of press attention for its unique voice control mechanics. BtE has some interesting ideas of its own though and I don’t think it should be ignored.

[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]
A rhythm-based-combat RPG with a story driven narrative has a decent amount of content, especially if you decide to go for as many recipes as possible. The rhythm mechanics are a refreshing change of pace from the normal choose-spells, counter as best you can and win over and over again. It forces you to pay attention to what you’re doing and continually improve as the game goes along. This is even after my initial skepticism that this game had few legs to stand on. After all, we’ve had plenty of rhythm games before. What could possibly make BtE stand out? Well, a good story with an amusing banter between the two protagonists and a decently diverse set of characters to fight out against with their own particular personality doesn’t hurt. Neither does a refined rhythm system that requires you to pay attention and react quickly to three different fields of falling arrows.

[b]Story Thoughts[/b]
The player is following the story of Ky, a hacker who finds himself waking up in a mysterious tower called, well, the Tower. This seven leveled tower isn’t something to scoff as he’ll soon learn that he can die in this tower. Upon awaking and talking to himself about what’s going on, he’s greeted by Naia, a “shepherd” that has few answers for Kai but seems to be on his side or at the very least trapped by her own circumstances. She’ll help him out by guiding him through the tutorial and each level. Ky must do this, defeating monsters to grow in strength to eventually defeat the seven guardians that stop forward progress. The plot has lies and half truths a plenty. Not everyone is telling the truth and there’s something sinister going on in the background. It seems to be set in the modern era though no country or actual year is dropped. The characters do seem to imply this is all happening in the 2010s.

[b]Combat Thoughts[/b]
In Before the Echo’s battles, you defeat monsters and bosses by following the beat of the music and destroying the enemy’s health before they do yours in. This is accomplished in a dance-dance-revolution type battle where you’re trying to cast spells, block their attacks and regenerate your mana when possible. To do this, you’ll need to press the right direction on the d-pad and letter keys of your controller when arrows are at the right time. You’ll often need to use both set of controls in order to handle all the arrows falling. Keyboard and mouse can also be used but I find the controller to be a little bit more enjoyable and easier to use for this game. To further complicate things, you’ll need to select and cast spells using the controller’s joystick while keeping an eye on arrows. This can be a little tricky to figure out at first but I eventually got used to it.

[b]PC Settings[/b]
Settings are a little bizarre here. Fullscreen on/off is the only traditional video setting to be found. Particle effects can be turned off, there’s a lag calibration for your controller, gem and text speed can be changed and a lot of other different functions important to the rhythm mechanics. Resolution options, AA, V-sync and other settings are missing as well. The one game I actually desire individual sound volume options doesn’t have them at all. I found the SFX was just a bit too loud over the music and people speaking but not unbearably high. For such an audio-intensive game, being able to adjust the different volumes seems like an obvious thing to include in your game. Voice acting can be turned off but I don’t know why you’d want to do that. It’s pretty good voice acting. I was surprised to hear the voice actor for Dust from Dust: An Elysian Tail in this title too. He plays one of the guardians.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
Before the Echo is a good and different experience that’s both decently approachable but difficult to master. The combination of RPG and Rhythm mechanics just works here, the mechanics blending well together and never allowing things to get dull for long. Though there are fights that can be overly frustrating. It’s also not too hard to lose concentration and find yourself in an unwinnable situation. So, you’ll need to stay on your toes or take a break if it’s happening too often. The story itself is pretty good, I found myself chuckling at the banter between the two protagonists from time to time. It does lean a bit too much on tropes but I think it does them well enough that I’m not bothered by it. It’s a good time “dancing” to the beats while playing a more traditional RPG game. I definitely liked this mix of genres and I recommend checking out when you have the chance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

LONG   VERSION | 

Pros:

+ Characters are quirky, almost too much so, but I love each and every one of them.
+ Game is challenging enough on preferred dificulty; with good balance between complexity and simplicity.
+ The Humour is sometimes cringey, but for the most part its good for a giggle or two.
+ The art style is consistent, it may not be for you but it does maintain aesthetic consistency.

Cons:

- Quite grindy at later stages.
- Hearing the same song for the same enemy can get repetive very quickly when doing said grinding.
- UI is console driven, and can be clunky at times for PC and keyboard.
- Limited options if you're not ok with that sort of thing.

The experience has been overall positive with this game, if you're not terribly into rythmn games or RPGs then one of the two genres might drag you through this game with some minor gripes, but for the most part even if you're not terribly into either it is worth it for the characters and the story.

I have never seen a game like this - it combines a lot of elements that I love.

[h1]Pros and cons:[/h1]

+ mix of game features
+ graphics
+ story
+ humor
+ music
+ bis emoticons on Steam

- missing volume settings(or at least I can't seem to find one anywhere and the in-game music/sound is higher than my normal and I don't like editting my volume everytime I play it)
- most of the time u are pressing arrows in the fight - even tho u need additional keys for switching between attack/defense/mana and for spells, it would be cool if you could use dancepad for playing this game

First, the good points:
+ Nice music
+ Fun gameplay, has a nice flow to it
+ Love the variety of spells and possibilities for spell combos
+ The narrative is neat and has entertaining humor and characters
+ Pretty artwork, and solid-looking characters


Now the not-so-good:
- Not much song variety. New levels and challenges for unlocking spells tend to recycle songs from previous levels.
- Item crafting is done by sacrificing some exp. This in itself isnt horrible, but when paired with the tiny song selection, repeating the same fights over and over again to craft your armor and weapons and keys to unlock the next level all while trying to maintain a level that allows you to continue playing comfortably becomes tedious.
- In short, grinding becomes pretty much mandatory.
- Not much selection in craftable weapons and armor. Each level supplies you with crafting recipes for one armor and weapon item at its beginning. Additional items can sometimes be dropped by enemies, but I have rarely found these helpful. When I saw the crafting screens in the trailer, I was hoping there would be more variety in items for the player; a build with a ton of attack and no defense, or a ton of mana but not much health would be interesting challenges to make repeating songs less tedious.

Additionally, controllers are supported by the game, but only 360 controllers as of right now. I used the program ds4windows to make my ps4 controller compatible with it (running on Win8.1), and I have seen others find supporting programs for different controllers. Using a controller makes for comfortable gameplay.


Overall, I'm not sure I whether I would recommend this game. The core concept is interesting and the spells are fun. Playing the faster-paced songs is a blast. However, the game suffers from a tiny playlist which turns some floors into drudgery and ""this track again?"" rather than keeping it a fun, fresh experience.

L'esperienza mi insegna che mischiare rhythm game a qualsiasi altro genere può potenzialmente portare a un disastro (tipo quel gioco che lo faceva con gli shootemup), ma fortunatamente non è questo il caso, e anzi il risultato è molto interessante.

Noi siamo Ky, un ragazzo che si risveglia misteriosamente all'interno di una strana torre di 7 piani, ricolma di mostri. Guidato tramite interfono da Naia, Ky deve superare ogni piano della torre, presieduti da immancabili ed eccentrici ""guardiani"", per scoprire dove diavolo è finito esattamente e perché. 

E per fare questo, dovrà affrontare le sue battaglie.. a colpi di ritmo. Proprio così, ogni scontro con i mostri si svolge durante un intero brano, su tre tabelle alternabili a piacimento: una rossa che rappresenta i danni nemici, una verde per i nostri attacchi/incantesimi e una blu per il mana. Azzeccando le frecce che scendono a tempo con la canzone si può quindi parare i danni nemici, attaccare con potenti magie o ripristinare il mana, chiaramente in base alla tabella in cui siamo. Per cui, durante le battaglie è necessaria un'alta concentrazione e la capacità di cambiare al volo tra una tabella e l'altra, azzeccando note su note per sconfiggere il nemico prima che la canzone finisca (o prima di morire). 

È un sistema molto particolare ma che funziona egregiamente, e per venire incontro a tutti ci sono 4 livelli di difficoltà (non più modificabili dopo il 3° piano), dal più basso con meno note a quello più alto per fanatici di rhythm game e praticamente impossibile per le persone normali. E, cosa che ho apprezzato, non c'è nessuno sbloccabile basato sulla difficoltà, neppure achievement, perciò chiunque può ottenere tutto giocando alla difficoltà che preferisce. 

Il punto forse più debole di questo gioco però sta proprio nel gameplay. A ogni nuovo piano raggiunto, Ky ottiene da Naia una serie di ricette di equip, magie, altri oggetti e ovviamente la chiave per il piano successivo. Per ottenere gli oggetti necessari a fabbricare il tutto, sarà quindi necessario sconfiggere i 3 mostri di ogni piano, ognuno con le sue percentuali di drop. E di fatto il gioco... è tutto qui, farmare ancora e ancora gli stessi mostri reskinnati finché non si hanno gli oggetti per craftare tutto (a proposito, ogni craft e acquisizione di magie costa exp, e se si fallisce è andata sprecata per niente), e chiaramente per salire pure di livello e avere una chance contro i guardiani e i mostri successivi. Non è troppo diverso dal normale farming sfrenato in ogni rpg, ma qui essendoci da fare praticamente solo quello potrebbe risultare un po' noioso sul lungo periodo. 

Di livello molto più alto invece il resto della produzione, dalle ottime canzoni techno delle battaglie all'eccelso script e doppiaggio (solo inglese, come i sottotitoli), senza dimenticare la buona caratterizzazione di ogni personaggio, specialmente i guardiani di ogni piano. La grafica invece è bidimensionale a schermate fisse, ma comunque ben disegnata, specialmente i personaggi. 
Anche la trama, che rimanda un po' a qualche anime giapponese, si dipana bene e incuriosisce fino alla fine (e c'è anche un finale segreto con qualche informazione in più), che sopraggiunge dopo una dozzina di ore. E i credits sono tra i migliori che abbia mai visto. 

Perciò nel complesso promosso ma non a pieni voti, più che altro per il fatto che qualcuno potrebbe trovare un po' monotono il farming forzato e costante, e che le canzoni su cui si combatte siano in fondo sempre le stesse. Ma essendo una produzione indipendente fatta da una manciata di persone (il doppiatore di Ky è lo stesso che ha fatto il 90% del resto) e con un gameplay originale che in fondo funziona, non si poteva obiettivamente chiedere troppo di più.

Немало ритм игр и вправду душат новичков уже при первой попытке знакомства, звонко ударяя между ушей эубодробительным темпом, изматывая полным отсутствием филерного контента, который дал был отдохнуть уставшим пальцам и расслабиться глазам которые только что пристально следили за бесконечными, сыпящимися сверху экрана, стрелками. Добиванием может стать турнирная таблица, показывающая насколько далёк новичок от заветного 100%/SS рейтинга.

Before the Echo, удачно вплетая приятную историю, поданную через забавные диалоги между главным героем и колоритными, пусть и шаблонными, персонажами, а так же перемежая ритмические ""поединки с монстрами"" простыми ролевыми элементами — создаёт очень удачный, размеренный и способствующий обучению игрока и улучшению его навыков, игровой процесс.
Игра достойно сбалансированна. Верхние два уровня сложности не примитивны, и дадут опытным игрокам то самое заветное ощущение мастерства, которое так приятно в играх этого жанра. Нижние две сложности - помогут новичкам влиться в игровой процесс, и, возможно, перейти на новую ступень мастерства.

Саунд к игре написал Dj Plaeskool, его музыку можно услышать между боями, в диалогах и различных меню, а вот практически вся ""боевая"" мызыка - авторства известного электронного музыканта Рональда Дженкиса (Ronald Jenkees), обладателя очень узнаваемого и оригинального стиля. Если вам нравится этот стиль - ваще счастье, но даже вам может показаться что набор треков уж слишком мал, и они слишком часто повторяются от одного игрового ""этажа"" к другому.

Насколько часто = ""слишком часто""? Для жанра ритм-игры является нормой множество раз отыгрывать одну и ту же мелодию, пока не достигнешь совершенства и максимального рейтинга, но учитывая многогранность игры и её желание быть больше чем просто ещё одной вариацией Dance Dance Revolution - я бы сказал, что разнообразия нужно больше.

Так или иначе, со своими странностями и заметными следами ограниченного бюджета разработки, эта игра, сделанная очень маленькой группой людей, обладает душой и способна доставить немало приятных часов, а учитывая небольшую стоимость - пробовать стоит, даже не фанатам жанра.",1439718081,1441448119,True,4,0,0.531506240367889404,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Before the Echo (оригинальным названием которой изначально было Sequence) - годная смесь RPG и ритм-игры. От первой имеем прокачку по уровню, характеристики персонажа и систему лута/инвентарь. От второй - саму игровую механику и систему сражений. Собственно, основным занятием здесь является именно ритм-игра, так как большую часть времени мы проводим именно в сражениях. Все, что от нас требуется - вовремя нажимать на 4 кнопки направления, упомянутых в заголовке. Но есть один нюанс - делать это нужно сразу на трех экранах, каждый из которых отвечает за определенное действие. В первом мы должны выполнить комбинацию, чтобы скастовать выбранное нами заклинание (атакующее, защитное, лечебное и т.д.), во втором мы должны нажимать на кнопки, чтобы защититься от удара атакующего, в третьем же мы можем пополнить запасы маны, необходимые для заклинаний. Изначально система может показаться сложной, но к ней довольно быстро привыкаешь. Есть еще некоторые нюансы, вроде определенных помех на каждом этаже, но  в целом геймплей выглядит именно так.

Что касается сюжета, то тут немного двоякое мнение. Начинается все банально - парень Кай просыпается неизвестно где и теперь он должен выбраться из этого места, пройдя все 7 этажей вместе со своим ""пастухом"" Найей, которая помогает ему по системе связи. Сюжет подается неравномерно - сначала можно заскучать, но во второй половине игры обороты набираются и в конце получается очень интересная и довольно внезапная развязка. Сразу скажу, что игра - лишь предисловие, поэтому ожидайте в конце некоторые открытые вопросы и намек на продолжение (которое уже, кстати, вышло, сменив при этом жанр).

Касательно графики и музыки. С первым все предельно просто - обычные арты, нарисованные довольно хорошо. Никакой анимации не ждите, все на уровне визуальных новелл. А вот с музыкой все посложнее: так как для ритм-игр это очень важный фактор, то здесь создатели не могли позволить себе ошибиться. Музыкальной составляющей к игре занимался Рональд Дженкис - весьма популярный и талантливый композитор, пишущий музыку во многих жанрах. Лично мне музыка очень понравилась, но тут дело вкуса, сами понимаете.

[i]В целом могу сказать, что играть было интересно. Да, может раздражать небольшой гринд ингредиентов с мобов, но это только в том случае, если вы хотите скрафтить абсолютно все предметы. Да и если проходить по паре этажей в день, то это не сильно надоедает. Рекомендую поклонникам ритм-игр или тем, кто хочет попробовать столь редко встречающийся на ПК геймплей, как в этой игре. 7/10[/i]",1439648674,1439665430,True,26,1,0.698227882385253906,0,True,False,False,False,,,

DDR = Dance Dance Revolution game where you press arrow sequences in time to the music

You earn XP with each victory which you can use to craft items and new spells but the probability of crafting success is never 100% guaranteed.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
+ Multiple difficulty levels, Normal difficulty is actually challenging and gradually pushed my (limited) DDR skills to the limit. Improving your DDR skills requires practice and is rewarding.
+ Rocking battle music by Ronald Jenkees
+ Floor 3 boss made me lol
+ Full voice acting 
+ Just plain fun, more fun than a whole bunch of AAA games that I have played and gotten bored of.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Limited variety of battle songs. They get reused multiple times.
- Ending was unpredictable but I personally found the explanation unsatisfying. Hidden ending unlock was very challenging and equally unsatisfying, explaining nothing. 
- Hardly ever needed to use defensive spells on Normal difficulty
- Impatient players may find this game too grindy and/or challenging

If you have any interest in DDR games, this one comes highly recommended.

The battle system is pretty interesting with the switching between screens and thinking up the best strategies to beat the enemies. I also have fun with the crafting system (but it does make the game grind-y; I find grinding rewarding so I enjoy it, but if you have little patience for that sort of thing, trying to gather all the materials and experience points to craft stuff might get on your nerves). Overall I've spent a lot of hours entertained by the game and am invested enough to want to get all achievements, craft all items, etc. So for the price I think the experience is really worth it (and I even got it on sale).

That said - I expected an RPG with a rhythm game gimmick, and got a rhythm game with an RPG gimmick instead... the rhythm game battling is like 90% of the game. But it's not quite strong on its own to be what I'd call an ""amazing"" rhythm game... the music is a bit bland and sounds more like a nice BGM than something to actively enjoy. I also appreciate sleek visuals/designs in rhythm/music games but the battle screen looks pretty basic. This would've all been 100% fine if there was just more besides the battles to the game... like if you could actually move through a map and  meet the monsters in random encounters or something, in a more RPG-y way. Or if the story and characters were more unique and there were more and better written narration and dialogue, in a visual novel-y way. The characters are pretty basic and the dialogue is cringey at times (trying a bit too hard to be witty/funny to be taken seriously, kinda generic, uncomfortable moments like one point where the r-slur is used). Basically I feel like the game is fun but falls short of being Great. Better visuals/music, more varied gameplay, better story/writing - if it had any one of those 3 things, I think it might've been enough. I wouldn't even demand to have all three at once. But as it is, it feels like it falls short of its potential. I think the core idea of integrating rhythm games with RPG in a battle system is really great and that the game could've been better.

But like I said, since it's cheap, I do think it's worth its price. So if you enjoy rhythm games you might as well get it because it'll probably provide quite a few hours of fun.

It's not fun to grind. It's especially not fun when it means playing the same song over and over, with nothing new happening. Most of the non-gameplay actions you can take require wagering experience points -- academically, the mechanic is really interesting...but gameplay-wise, it's just frustrating to spend massive amounts of experience points on this.

The characters, at least through as much of the game as I saw, were just cringey. It's like Twilight for boys -- a totally non-special guy randomly ends up in a magical world where a woman with a sexy voice flirts with him. I'm looking for something a little more interesting than sarcasm. I don't need an elitist lesson in how everyone but the dev pronounces ""mana"" wrong -- I'm sure there's an audience that resonates with, but it isn't me.

The actual gameplay is not terrible, and involves rotating through 3 DDR-style tracks -- one to defend, one to regenerate mana, and one to cast spells. Again, it's academically interesting, but gameplay-wise, it's just kind of infuriating to constantly be shown the opportunity cost of the choosing the track you're currently on.

So maybe that's my gripe -- the game always made me feel like I wasn't doing what I should be doing. The game wants me to take risks with my EXP wagering and to not care about the other tracks during gameplay, but my personality doesn't let me switch into that mode.

If you're reading this, congratulations! You have a good taste in videogames.

As a hardcore rhythm game player, Before the Echo caught my attention soon enough but honestly I didn't know what to expect. The conclusion after beating everything is a fully recommendation of the game.

Before the Echo (also known as Sequence) is a rhythm game with RPG elements. The basic stuff  in summary (HP, Mana, EXP, weapons, accesories...). The main character, Ky, has somehow placed himself into a tower where he needs to fight mobs and bosses in order to escape.

The battle system consists in getting control of 3 labels of notes. They have different purposes and you need to know when to focus into one or another. I won't explain their features here since the game has tutorials for that.

PROS:

+ The artwork is cool. Backgrounds are good-looking, and so are characters and foes. 
+ The soundtrack, as you might expect from a rhythm game, is pretty awesome. It also combines many music styles so if you're open minded with that stuff you'll probably enjoy it a lot.
+ 4 difficulties, from lame to more challenging. 
+ The RPG system is pretty well included. Just as simple as it needs to be.
+ The storymode is surprisingly interesting. The characters' charisma helpsa lot here.
+ The dialogues. This is actually one of the most remarkable features. Dialogues in this game are VERY hilarious. Together with a pretty cool voice acting, dialogues will keep you super entertaining and will provide many, many laughs.

CONS:

- Despite having a cool artwork, there's not too much variety, specially from foes.
- At some points grinding/farming is mandatory.
- All achievements can be obtained no matter the difficulty you set, which makes them WAY less satisfying.
- No leaderboards. 
- Steam version works like a Flash game (for instance, I couldn't make screenshots, nor broadcasts). 

All in all, I've had a GREAT experience with this game. It has some minor flaws I could perfectly ignore, and every rhythm player should try this out. You'll surely find some good fun and discover a very consistent title despite its price (less than an euro during sales... WHAT?).

Other then that, it's a mix between that and RPG style progression. I'll give ya a list of pros and cons so you can better decide on whether you should buy Beyond the Echo. I personally recommend the game. By the way, don't mind shitty Metascore for the low rating, and I mean that for this game and for all the other games out there. Enough rambling though.

Pros:
- Very, very low price.
- Amazing soundtrack!
- Original gameplay.
- Beautiful hand painted scenarios.
- Mix between rhythmic and RPG genres.
- Awesome setting!
- Prequel to ""There Came an Echo"".
- Really funny parts!
- Over 12 hours of gameplay for such a low price!
- Quality voice acting.
- Cuddos for the ending sequence.
- Credits scene! 

Cons:
- Can get grindy after a while, due to repetition of certain songs.
- Rather simplistic, yet enjoyable gameplay.
- The final boss fight is simply to easy! Learning the final scroll should be the ending sequence. (it's so god damn hard!)
- No more cons, so just buy the damn game already!

Everything about this game is great. The story is mysterious, the characters have personality and are well-voiced, there is a simple crafting element, and the sense of incremental progress that you want in an RPG. The rhythm mechanic works very well! It keeps battles interesting and fun.

My only complaint is that there is not enough music. The system in this game deserves a wide array of music. There were only ~12 battle songs throughout the game. I found myself a little disappointed when I'd face a new monster or boss and think, ""Oh, it's this song again."" I do like the quality of the music, and would prefer quality over quantity, but the ideal case would be both. :)

The game plays much like StepMania (DDR without the dancing) although there is an intersting field switch mechanic which you need to exploit to clear the stages.

It all adds up to repetitively grinding the same monsters on the same handful of songs over and over in order to progress.  I can only imagine these were added to help artifically increase the length of the game, which would otherwise be extremely short, which leads me into my major issue with the game; the writing.
Writing is an issue which it's much better successor shares, everyone is so contrived in following along with the plotline, In this iteration, the protaginist and the supporting heroine are set up as antagonists, but engage in half hearted bickering until events contrive to have the hero off rescuing her a couple in game hours after their intitial meeting; what changed to reconcile these two advesaries?  A couple of passing comments wich imply the possibly the heroine is not 100% commited to organization which is forcing the hero to risk his life.  If only it was that easy for me to reconcile with my enemies.  The story climax involves a forced moral objection to something which, when you think about it, isn't all that bad, which has the hero vowing to commit his life to destroying those responsible and taking on substatial personal risk in the interium.  This isn't a crusader of justice, it's suposedly a VERY bright college kid caught up in a risky mis-adventure.

Le systeme est simple sur le papier: des boutons, des fleches qui défilent, on appuie. Mais a prendre en main c'est assez dur si on a pas l'habitude des jeux de rythme. 
Apres je trouve que le jeu est vraiment interressant seulement si on le met en ""hard"" sinon pas de réelle difficulté.

Même l'histoire est accrochante (ca nous change du groupe de musique qui part en tournée n'est ce pas Actipognon?!)
Graphiquement les plans sont vraiment beaux rien à redire

Les dialogues sont assez marrants j'ai adoré les voix des personnages et en particulier celles de Ky et Naia. Une version francaise aurait ete super mais bon on va pas chipoté non plus.

Bref un systeme d'item et de level tres bien travaillé, et si on est d'abord surpris par la musique, on se rend compte qu'elle est vraiment cool. Le fait de mettre en scène des combats à travers un jeu de rythme parait casse gueule mais c'est pas du tout le cas ici au contraire et on retrouve cette espece de fièvre des bornes d'arcade à  appuyer frénétiquement partout sur sa manette... 

Bon après pour ce jeu il va encore falloir vider votre compte bancaire comme à chaque solde steam et... WHAT? 0,99€ ou 4€ pas soldé?
Nan sérieux ce jeu vaudrait au moins 7 ou 8 balles franchement ça vaut le coup meme juste pour essayer!

While I ultimately ended up playing on Spasmodic difficulty, and am capable of getting 100% on several songs when I 'practice' in the bonus mode, the RPG elements, coupled with the field switching mechanic makes many foes extremely challenging.

Speaking of RPG elements, there is absolutely no explanation of the actual mechanical effects of the offense and defense stats. It's logical to assume that defense decreases the damage you take from missed gems, which is in turn multiplied by the gem color, but no indication is given about how much defense reduces how much damage.
Coupled with the fact that you can't see actual concrete stats from enemies (only vague bars), and the RPG mechanics seem to be a gimick that was tacked on to a rhythm game to make it 'harder' without requiring them to add more songs or harder difficulties for the songs.

Ultimately, I'd rather play something like Stepmania on the harder difficulties for my Rhythm game fix, and then play an RPG like Dragon Age or one of the various Elder Scrolls.

Combat can be quite frantic as you have to swap between the three aforementioned modes, and it becomes important to find gaps in an enemy's attack pattern to effectively go on the offense. Additionally all combat has a time limit: each monster has a track associated with it and you need to kill it before the song ends to gain any experience or drops.

It's a neat idea and can be quite fun, at least on normal since the DDR inputs for Hard are extremely challenging to anyone without a good sense of rhythm and coordination. A controller with a reliable D-pad is essential, and thankfully you can use a combination of the D-pad and ABXY for simultaneous direction inputs.

Unfortunately it is a grind-fest; you need to craft keys to progress from floor to floor, and to craft them requires items and experience which requires you to fight monsters over and over again. Sometimes you can fail crafting an item, but if you put more experience into the synthesis you will have a greater success rate. Most of your equipment requires crafting, and learning new spells means crafting the scroll then to learn it you have to use more experience and complete a challenge which if you fail doesn't reimburse the experience used.

Grinding often becomes something of a necessity in RPGs but with a game like this you can't just do it mindlessly because of the battle system in place. It probably doesn't help either if you're not fond of the music in the game because you're going to be hearing the same tracks over and over while you meticulously enter directional inputs and pray for the right drop this time.

For the majority of people Before the Echo will not be an enjoyable experience, but if you really love DDR (but are perhaps too corpulent or uncoordinated to deal with floor pads) and grindy RPGs this will kill two birds with one stone.",1433120123,1433120123,False,2,0,0.516554355621337891,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a shame, because it buries them in terrible design and writing.

Let's start with the good.  The basic gameplay of the game revolves around a rhythm based combat system. This is similar to DDR or Stepmania, but with three step charts (one for your attacks, one to defend, and one to recharge your mana).  This system is intuitive and rewards both musical ability as well as strategy (primarily for when you attack).  If this game was just a series of songs which had to be defeated using this system it would have been great.

Unfortunately the game has been lengthened with the most obnoxious forms of grind.  To get to the next boss fight and to proceed to the next area, you must craft a key.  To get the items for crafting the key you must fight the three monsters on your level.  They have a random chance of dropping various items, with some of the required items having a very low chance to drop.  And on top of this, crafting isn't guaranteed.  You can sacrifice your XP (and possibly lose levels) to increase the chance of success, but the success rate caps out at 95% so you can still fail.  If you do fail you lose everything and have to repeat your hunt for those items from scratch.

This means that the game very quickly forces you to repeat the same fight over and over and over again, long after it has ceased to be challenge anymore.  This completely killed any enjoyment I had for the game.  I have a feeling the developers added these grind elements to lengthen the amount of time that people would play the game, but it had the opposite effect for me.

While the grinding aspects are what kill this game, I should note that the writing is also horrible.  Absolutely everything in the game, from the dialogue of every single character and every single item description, is written in this ironic hipster tone.  This might have been amusing if it had been done in moderation, but as it is every bit of text in the game is trying to show you how funny it is, when very little is even amusing (unless you find lines like ""I feel like my brain got stabbed by a hobo"" to be hilarious).  It also kills your sense of immersion when absolutely every character is aware (and comments on the fact) that the game mechanics don't make sense and seem to be completely artificial.",1432045436,1432045436,False,5,0,0.475966453552246094,3,False,False,False,False,,,

The mechanics of the game are very unique and there is nothing quite like it. You use the rhythm of the music to fight a battle. To this you use the arrow keys and click them as soon as the arrow reaches the bottom of the screen. And this is when it gets unique. You have 3 fields to control via this rhythm ability. Mana, Attack and Defense. Mana is collected and can be used to cast spells in the attack field. You can switch through these fields at your free will. You need to make sure that you use each field correctly and at the right time to survive and win the battle. 

The story of this game is what most suprised me. It had me hooked throughout the entire thing. There are many twists in the story that keep you guessing throughout the game. The voice is acting is very well done and the characters are very likable. You really do get to know the characters. In a rhythm game a gripping story is the last thing I would have expected. I am not going to go into detail about the story but just experience it for yourself and you will see how great it is. 

The whole look of the game is completely incredible. The art style gives a real great look to the game that compliments the awesome gameplay. 

Throughout the floors you get different items. You have collect these items through playing the levels. I felt the items abilitys were very well balanced and contributed well to the gameplay. These items are obtained through a random drop rate on levels. Some items have a very low drop rate on levels later on the game. Unfortunetely this is where my only bad point comes from this game. To get these items it can become very grindy with you having to repeat these levels multiple times in a row just to get it. This can get very boring after a while.

I'll end this review with the best part of the game, the soundtrack. It is made of music by Ronald Jenkees and Michael Wade Hamilton. I always feel that a game has a great soundtrack when I like it so much that I even listen to it outside of the game itself, and with this one I did. It is incredible and goes great with a rhythm game. 

Overall this game is a true masterpiece and a bit of a hidden gem. This game is possibly one of the best I have ever played and I really highly recommend it.

Normally, RPGs and music games both face issues, but I can't readily see them in this title. It took the gameplay of Rockband: Unplugged for the PSP and made it actually functional, and into an intuitive battle system. The RPG elements, with the ability to gain and lose levels as you spend time bettering your character, made character building interesting and every upgrade felt impactful. The voice acting was well done too, though similarly with There Came an Echo the character development was not endearing, focused too much on antagonistic dialouge rather than meaningful trait building. Still, however, you can skip these scenes so you can get away from that as much as possible. 

The game itself, I'll warn, has little replay value. There's no software to add custom tracks like in Audiosurf, the music gets used on multiple levels and, given you are grinding, you get to hear the songs over and over again. If the music was bad, this would have been worse of an issue but I can't honestly say that the songs were terrible and didn't go so far as to play abrasive music from Dubstep, etc. Other things I'd change would be additions of things like local PvP, clearer labeling on the spell circle to tell which spell was which and what numbers corresponded to which slice of the circle, and more than seven levels/three battle senarios per level.

It's not a perfect game, not everyone is going to enjoy it and it will never receive a lot of fame and recognition. However, for the niche audience that can appreciate it, Sequence is a game like no other.

The closest thing I can relate Sequence to is Puzzle Quest. The game doesn't play like Puzzle Quest but what that game did for Match-3 games, Sequence does for the rhythm genre. The base game has you traveling up a tower by fighting enemies, collecting their dropped items, and synthesising items such as keys, weapons and armor. Battles give you experience which will level up your stats while armor and weapons are equipable and can also improve your abilities. 

Where Sequence differs from the average dungeon crawler is that combat is played out by putting you in a rhythm system similar to StepMania, if you're using a keyboard, but with three separate boards. One board is defensive, one board is for building mana and one is for casting spells. On the first board, any notes that you miss will count as damage against you so catching them defends your HP. The second board will have a constant stream of notes. Missing them doesn't hurt you but catching them restores your mana which you need to cast spells. The last board stays dormant until you cast spells, the only way to damage your opponents. When you cast a spell, it takes mana and makes you complete a short rhythm sequence. Failing it causes the spell to fail but completing it will cast that spell. While it can be a lot to juggle at once, the game does a great job of teaching you and ramping up the difficulty slowly in order to build your skills both in game and out.

The gameplay by itself is fun for a while but as the entire game is built around grinding items and EXP, it would get boring very quickly if it weren't for the well written story pushing players forward. The tone reminded me of The World Ends With You in the best possible way, but felt wholy unique. Your main character finds himself waking up in a tower with no idea how he got there. The voice of a girl named Naia tells you that you are stuck in this tower/game and you will need to make your way up 7 floors to escape so off you go. While there are some predictable moments, the story as a whole never becomes too transparent and despite a few moments when I swore I was done after one more battle, curiosity kept me pushing ever forward. The characters are all voiced as well and while none are particularly mind-blowing, it's a nice touch and the quality stayed consistent throughout. If you do find your bar set particularly high in regards to VO quality, they do have an option to turn it off as well although I doubt this will be necessary for most people.

That's not to say the game isn't without it's rough spots. For a music-based game, Sequence has a surprisingly limited soundtrack of only about 10 songs that show up in battle. This means several monsters will have you playing the same songs repeatedly. Thankfully, they aren't bad and some of them I didn't mind repeating but considering each monster all but requires multiple playthroughs anyway, don't be surprised if you wind up hearing the same song 10+ times. As that suggests too, the gameplay is simply too grindy and while item drops are pretty common, it can be irritating when you need one specific item and have to fight the same monster over and over just to move forward. Finally, the song balance is a bit odd as by the end of the game, the length of the song decided more battles for me than my HP did. It felt like very artificial difficulty (you lose if the song ends before killing the enemy) and it would have been nicer to have some of the songs be just a bit longer, especially in Floor 7. Depending on your strategy, you may not have a problem with this but it showed up several times in my game.

Overall, if you're looking for something different and enjoy music gameplay, Sequence is worth a shot.",1425294407,1425294407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If a game that combines rhythm game and RPG appeals to you then this game would be something to look at even if that combination of genre wasn't so rare. 

First off to all the people who aren't scared off from thinking of potential problems or weirdness already, it's not just ""let's smash these genres together"". It's very functional as a rhythm game and they made that part of gameplay the ""battle"" portion of the RPG. You switch between ""fields"" to either defend against attacks, cast spells or regain mana. The balance of strength of attacks and difficulty pulling them off feels nice and natural and the game overall feels just wonderfully made. Like any RPG you might need to grind a little but just remember to pay attention to getting good equipment and good spell usage and it shouldn't get too bad. I think the only negative I can really think about gameplay is there isn't any ""turn based"" alternative for anyone that isn't physically capable of playing a timing based game, but for the rest of it it's good to go. 

Music and visual aesthetics might depend a bit on individual taste to say for sure but I personally loved both in this game.  The story is awesome too, unlike a lot of other RPG's it doesn't give you a ton of story which works since plenty of the interest comes in the mystery and uncertainty. You get just a few cutscenes every floor, long enough to enjoy the strange characters but not so long you forget you're playing a video game. Trust me there's not really any throw away characters.

Leveling up is a chore though, and the bonus for beating an enemy skillfully isn't enough to outweigh the immense grind.

So I was kinda meh about the whole idea behind Sequence. But as soon as I got in there I must say that I really REALLY enjoyed rhythm gaming mixed with RPG elements, fighting, spells, mana and so on. Giving my successes and failures a deeper meaning.

It surprisingly fun to pull of a combo in Sequence and you’re rewarded with fun characters, good dialogue (not the best voice acting maybe but still fun dialogue). And for the first time I want to get further and deeper through the game… and it’s a rhythm game! The hardcore rhythm gamers will probably enjoy this, and the casual ones will like this, and the non rhythm gamers will still enjoy it for feeling more like a puzzle game.

Give this game a chance!

O seu objetivo é pressionar as teclas direcionais no momento exato para produzir múltiplas ações. Existem 3 quadros interativos nas batalhas: o de defesa (contra ataques inimigos), o de magias (sua única forma de atacar seus adversários) e o de Mana – cuja pronúncia correta é “mah-nah"" – onde é possível recuperar seus pontos de magia para utilizar cada vez mais suas magias.

O jogo gira em torno de lutas, batalhas estas muitas vezes cansativas devido ao fato de que será necessário enfrentar um mesmo personagem várias vezes até obter todos os seus itens dropáveis. Alguns desses itens serão necessários para fabricação de chaves, obrigatórias para que se dê continuidade ao jogo.

Quanto à trilha sonora, é relativamente boa, o que nesse caso torna-se obrigatório visto que o jogo em questão gira em torno de sua musicalidade e as ""sequências"" devem ser realizadas de acordo com o ritmo musical. Um fator negativo é que as mesmas repetem-se várias vezes em virtude de existirem poucas, o que tornará suas batalhas, em alguns casos, entediantes.

A história é razoável, sem um enredo complexo nem nada, mas até certo ponto atraente. É uma parte que deveria ter sido mais bem trabalhada. Após vencer o jogo e cumprir alguns requisitos especiais (vide achievements) um novo final pode ser destravado, mas tão non-sense quanto o anterior.

Por fim, quero deixar registrado minha frustação com relação ao método de cálculo de percentagem desse jogo. A percentagem ou porcentagem (do latim per centum, significando ""por cento"", ""a cada centena"") é uma medida de razão com base 100 (cem). É um modo de expressar uma proporção ou uma relação entre 2 (dois) valores (um é a parte e o outro é o inteiro) a partir de uma fração cujo denominador é 100 (cem), ou seja, é dividir um número por 100 (cem). O cálculo percentual nada mais é que a multiplicação de um valor qualquer pelo percentual desejado. Durante o jogo inteiro, você precisará de reagentes e receitas para sintetização de produtos. A chance de sucesso aumenta (ou diminui) conforme você aumenta (ou diminui!) a quantidade de XP doada! Isso mesmo, XP! Você perderá muita experiência através deste método, infelizmente.

A frustação ocorre porque os desenvolvedores animais desse jogo não sabem como este cálculo ocorre e o que significa, gerando situações em que uma chance de 90%+ não significará absolutamente nada na fabricação de itens... Lamentável...

Porém, quero deixar registrado que o jogo possui uma característica peculiar que me agradou bastante, diga-se de passagem. E é por este motivo que eu o recomendo!!",1421027264,1421107165,True,5,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Having played through it using only the gamepad, I have no idea how it handles with a keyboard, but I can say that the gamepad felt completely natural to use. Switching through the fields using the triggers was outright cathartic.

Sequence is a gameplay-focused game, and the gameplay is as fantastic as it is interesting. The field-based rhythm combat isn't just a novelty, it has handfuls of legitimate merit. I'd even go so far as to call it innovative. The inherent multi-tasking and battle system means that the game is less execution-heavy than you might like, but playing on Hard did mean that Piano Jam left my fingers aching nonetheless. 

Battle system itself revolves around the use of skills and micromanaging several fields. Things start to fall apart here - the usefulness of skills is determined by your stats (automatically allocated after each level-up) entirely and utterly. Pulling off a skill doesn't nearly matter as much as the stats behind it, and at several points in the game I had to go to a previous area to grind up a few levels because I was simply unable to deal enough damage to defeat an enemy in the time allocated (you only have until the song ends). Taking into account that the insurmountable enemies in question were rather easy otherwise, it was a total chore. 

Stats don't belong in this game - instead of skillfully outmaneuvering the enemy through sick beats, you're either painfully chipping away at their health pool or utterly annihilating them, and all in the space of about 2-3 levels. 

The reason this game has so many stats is because it also bills itself as an RPG, and stats are a required part of that I guess. It fails as one. There's no sense of playing a role whatsoever, and the worldbuilding is so thin it completely collapses under itself at several points. All the item descriptions are all completely irrelevant puns (funny ones, but quick wit doesn't flesh out a world), and the entire premise is waved off by the characters as intentionally arbitrary, which tries as hard to engage as a prince betrothed to a simian. This game is about as much an RPG as your average dating sim.

You progress through the game through the game's shallow crafting system. Choose an enemy to fight, and they have a chance to drop an item. Use these items to craft an item that will allow you to progress to the next area. How quickly you are able to craft this item depends on whether or not an enemy decides to drop the item. While it should be noted that there are some late-game items that increase item drop rate, the progression remains steadfastly a nightmare. Farming for items isn't fun. Whoever thought it was fun is a monster.

Combine this with that crafting recipes requires EXP. On it's own, this is a fantastic idea. However, combined with the stat-dependent gameplay and already tedious farm-based progression, it does nothing but serve to remind yourself how much of a chore it should have been to get through the game, had it not had the lucky break of being legitimately enjoyable to play. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon, though.

The character banter is alright, though the story is so horrendous that I was left shocked by the sheer contrived garage leaking out of that final 10 minute exposition dump that sold itself as an ending. Shocked at a point I'd long since become apathetic. It's almost impressive how bad the plot is. The weak sense of intrigue initially spiked is just dragged out and finally shot like a dying dog. The super secret Sequel hook is hilariously nothing as well.

Art direction, I found, was fine, outside of rather cheap-looking UI. There's not enough of it though - there's a total of about 8 area images, and a single sprite per character or monster. No CGs for major events, and even those scarce few images are reused to hell and back. There's budget, and then there's ridiculous.

In spite of these problems, I completely and totally recommend that you play Sequence. The choice of music is stellar, the mechanics responsive, and as a whole the game is plain fun. The gameplay doesn't just carry it, it vaults it to the finish line. I'd love to see a sequel.

Before the Echo (or Sequence, before the legal stuff) is a solid rhythm combat game, with emphasis on multitasking. The graphics are nice, but lacking full character animation. Music in the game is good, but the limited setlist means several songs will be repeated. That repetition [i]will[/i] get on your nerves, as the progression system in the game pushes for RPG-style grinding to craft all the equipment. With 3 monsters to choose per floor, you will have to repeat fights to get all the random crafting parts.

The game is solid and charming, but stretches some content thin with grinding. I can recognize the music even a year after beating it. It doesn't need much of a sale to be a great deal, and I can recommend it at full $5 USD if you are looking for something unique.

Plot twists, kinda forced, kinda rushed. Someone likes that, others don't.

Anyone who has played rhythm games is all too familiar with the standard mechanic of having 4 columns of arrows falling in tune with the music. Sequence manages to make a very strong tactical/multi-tasking game out of it by having 3 seperate grids. One grid is the mana grid, which you use to get mana to cast spells - it's very common to miss lots of beats here in preference to landing beats on the other 2 grids. This is also where the beats primarily follow the song. Another grid is the defensive grid - beats that fall here and you don't hit will reduce your HP until you hit 0 and lose. The other grid is the spell grid. At any time you have the mana for it, you can choose to cast a spell - the effects vary from dealing damage to the enemy, healing, lifestealing, hitting the enemy with damage over time, giving yourself a mana boost, boosting the strength of the next spell you cast. Each individual spell has its own beat combination that doesn't change with the exception of inverting a few presses, left instead of right, etc, and also significant changes between difficulties. All these different spells are balanced by difficulty of input, how much blank space is there in between beats (to allow for swapping to other grids), as well as cooldown before you can cast that same spell again. Anything less than 100% on a spell input results in it failing, going on cooldown, and using up mana.

All those different factors result in a very frantic level of multi-tasking that I have never seen in this genre, and continuously leaves me mentally engaged, instead of just sitting back and hitting buttons corresponding to a beatmap all day. Incredibly satisfied with Sequence for gameplay originality and engagement.

Music: I'm not that big of an electronica fan, however, Ronald Jenkees has made a good effort to change my mind on that. The music for the beatmaps are all catchy. DJplaeskool did a good job with the rest of the soundtrack.

Writing/dialogue: There is a large community wide disagreement between enjoyment and annoyance of the dialogue between the 2 main characters, so your mileage will vary heavily in that regard. What I can say from an objective point of view is that it is very mechanically solid, all the characters in the game have lots of personality, and the voice acting also performs just as well as the writing.

Story: The story is neat and fairly original, and with an excellent great reveal at the end.

RPG Elements: Probably my least favorite aspect of the game, but they work solidly enough. In order to progress to a higher level in the tower, you need to do the same 3 beatmaps on the existing level enough times to collect enough drops to craft a key to be able to start the boss fight to go to the next level. This part is just fine, since it encourages a not-excessive amount of replaying the same content to a good amount of replayability. By collecting those drops, you can also craft items that make it so your spells are stronger, you have more survivability, and/or a larger mana pool. There's also experience that gets used to improve those stats via level ups, and gets used in crafting. The big reason why I'm iffy on this, is that especially on the higher difficulties, I put myself in a dilemma of whether I just need to get less bad at the game, or if I just need to grind out some better stats to give me a better fighting chance.

Overall: All the parts come to work together without any major flaws to spoil the image, and where the game truly excels is its innovative take with the 3-grid system.",1417899660,1417899660,True,1,0,0.539776504039764404,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's the defense field in which you defend against incoming attacks by aggressors by blocking their attacks pressing the corresponding keys.  The spell field in which you cast spells with different effects such as DoT, healing, or fast recharge low damage spells.  And the mana field in which you replenish mana, which is used to cast spells, you can only have one of these fields open at a time and there is a time limit for defeating the monster, which is an interesting concept.  The monsters have a chance of dropping various items, the lower the more rare and they all give a different amount of experience. You use your experience to craft items, spell scrolls, or keys which you use to use to progress, herein lies some of the problems of the game.  It feels like a grind, just a huge grind.  You end up wasting so much time either killing the same monster over and over again to find that ONE item you need to make better gear or spells, and you can end up wasting all of that precious expereince you earned making you down on experience, although you do lose out on some items.  It just gets very very repetitive around floor four you notice none of the spells bring anything new to the table.  It doesn't help the writing isn't super compelling.  Not to mention the music is reused and the only time you feel like you're actually playing a rhythm game is when you're in the mana field, which is when the keys actually feel like they correspond to the music.

When I saw the tutorial I thought the game would be insanely confusing and hard to play, but it's quite nicely done, as you see all 3 panels at once at any time, so you see what is coming.

The art is really cool, the music is awesome and the story is even more awesome! I wanted to play until the end to know what happens... It's full of surprises, it's hiralious and you get hooked right into the story.

The spells aren't limited to only damage, you have shielding, direct damage, DOT, healing, boosts... Alot of different spells to use. You have to kill the monsters and ascend floors until you reach the top. All monsters have specific drops which you have a certain percentage of getting everytime you kill them (with music of course). You also have to craft/find your gear and you can learn new spells by using scrolls and completing the songs with high accuracy or note combos.

Theres not many bad things to say about the game... My only real issue with the game is the hitboxes...

Sequence is a rythm game with an actual story (not a bad one in my opinion), but won't spoil it :P it has combat mechanics which really few games have done it well if any. you have 3 ""panels/tabs"" in which you run the rythms, the atack one, defese one and mana gathering one, it's basics are well explained in it's well made tutorial.

Cons:
- if you want to 100% can be a tinsy but grindy to get materials for crafting ( YES IT HAS CRAFTING);
- for a rythm game it doesn't have that many songs;

Pros:
- an actual decent story with twist;
- good, funny dialogue with great voice acting;
- challenging yet fun gameplay;
- nice variety of skills;
- has crafting and items with boosts and what not's;
- cartoony/anime graphics but well made in my opinion;
- trains observatory and reflex skills;
- story wise doesn't have replayability but it's fun to replay it from time to time;
- story easter egg, FIND IT;
- not hard to 100%;
- you can pause during battles whenever you want;

I would enjoy this IMMENSELY more if there were multiplayer. Fighting against stale AI is pretty dull, but I like it for what it is. 

The dialog is full of excruciatingly bad deliveries of unwitty jokes and poor ""insightful"" satirical sarcasm that belittles people's intelligence in an almost superfluously verbose manner (as if they are talking to a child). I don't need the explanations of these poor attempts at ""correcting"" whoever they are trying to correct and I am sure most people didn't eg., when they say the word ""Mana"" and say it is pronounced ""Mah-na"", It came off so pretentious and belittling. It would just be so much better if they didn't have this unnecessary dialog for the tutorial, people want to get straight to the gameplay and see if they like it before wasting an hour of dialog! I know how ""Mana"" is pronounced, I am sure most avid gamers are familiar with it and even MTG players. BUT the MAIN character, I guess because of the personality he was given? He speaks FOR me. He called Naia annoying, dear god is she annoying! The voice actor who did her, I don't know if it was a girlfriend of one of the developers or something, but she has that valley girl voice that makes me want to rip my hair out every time I hear her vocal fry. She stutters here and there and fails to convey her credibility as a ""guardian"" in the game. Despite her lines and voice acting being terrible, the main character proves a redeeming glimmer of hope of tolerance. 

Being there were some sound issues already, I expect way more and some of the sfx are not mixed into the overall game volume very well. 

The music, thus far, is pretty bland. It would be better if they were all original tracks catered to the players and developers.

*NOTE: This review will be fairly biased, as I enjoy dj-ing/mixing electronic dance music.

If you like rhythm games like Tap Tap Revolution, music - in particular the electronic dance music genre, grinding, and crafting, then you will really enjoy this game. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg8LfoyDFUM]Ronald Jenkees[/url] does a lot of the music for the game, and if you like his style then you will love the music found here.

The aesthetics of the game are nice - the artstyle for the characters and backgrounds are well-detailed. The music is very, very good, however, if you do not like the electronic genre, then you may get tired of hearing the music, and this is critical because it is the core of the gameplay and (so far) the variety is not too expansive. You will also grind quite a bit, so you will be hearing the same tracks repeatedly. 

The story is decent, nothing too fancy. The voice acting is not bad, and the comedic banter between the main characters is funny at times. There is also some teasing of common RPG elements, which I always find very nice when not overdone.

The controls are easy to familiarize yourself with - you use the WASD keyes and/or the arrow keys in combination with the numbers (spell hotkeys) and Q and E. The tutorial is skip-able but extremely important for understanding the mechanics of the game. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are not used to playing rhythm games. I am pretty good at beatmatching by ear, so I tried the 2nd hardest difficulty and had to tone it down a level - my finger dexterity on the keys are still rusty; however, I plan to do a playthrough on the hardest difficulty once I beat the game.

Gameplay is very, very fun if you are interested in the rhythm genre. You have three windows, Defence, Spells, and Mana. Arrow kills will fall in the Defence and Mana windows, and you can swap your active window with the Q and E skills (left and right respectively). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Defence window, you lose health depending on the type of arrow (basic white color = -1 HP, and so forth). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Mana window, there is no effect.

Arrows will only fall in the Spells window when you activate one of your spells with the number hotkeys, however, you must also have enough mana to cast the spell. Failing to press even a single arrow key in the Spells window will cause you to fail in casting it and you will not be refunded your mana. Spells are the way you damage your opponent, and you can also heal yourself. I believe you can only have 4 active spells at a time (you start with 2 slots and unlock more as you progress through the tower).

Between battles, you can craft and equip different items. There are 7 floors in the tower you wake up in, and you are given new crafting recipes as you reach new floors. One item will always give a permanent bonus (ex: +1 to offence), and others can be new spells, armor, or weapons. You can also scrap your items for experience points. When you craft, you have to pay exp. to increase the chance of success (you can even pay lose levels if you want to pay that much exp); if you fail, you are not refunded the exp. 

Levelling up is done automatically, you do not have to allocate skill points. 

As you progress through the game, monsters will have a unique ""guardian ability"" for each floor - for example, on the 2nd floor enemies (once per battle) can activate an ability that makes the falling arrow keys fade to invisibility as they reach the lower quarter of your window. Listening to the beat of the music really, really helps because the keystrokes tend to match the beat very well. With enough practice, you can even swap windows freely and continue pressing arrow keys to the beat. There is a craftable item for each floor that allows you to ignore guardian effects (except when you fight the bosses).

Boss battles are fun and the character's are pretty funny. Each boss will use their guardian effect more frequently, and you cannot negate it with the inhibition item. 

If you are interested in rhythm games, definitely pick up this fantastic game.

Highly recommend!

My experience was on medium difficulty of someone who is not musically inclined, though I am a fan of rhythm games.

The RPG aspect of the title is somewhat limited. There's three equipment slots, but overall there's a clear progression of ""this item is pretty much completely better than this other one,"" blandly increasing stats, though they -- like all the other items in the game -- may have punny item descriptions or names. The accessories slot, the third item slot, is interesting though -- if you ever find yourself needing certain items to progress, two later-game items let you increase your item drop rate at the cost of decreasing your stats, essentially. Or you can have a more unique attribute like doubling critical hit chance or decreasing spell cooldown. Leveling up is an across-the-board boost to your stats, but one interesting mechanic is in crafting -- you have to trade exp for chance to craft, exp is a currency. The level cap is 34, but you can beat the game in your mid-20s. I beat it at level 28 with relative ease compared to the grinding (more on that later).

Spells are acquired to directly combat enemies. They are all balanced differently (mana cost, damage, length of time to cast the spell, spell cooldown, difficulty of the arrow sequence) so there's plenty of choices in gameplay style. You can have a maximum of 6 spell slots to unload direct damage, damage over time, healing, and life-draining spells. There are also two buffing spells that boost the damage of the next spell, and a barrier spell to decrease the number of arrows thrown your way on the defence field. You can ALSO play the game significantly more aggresively by using the Convert spells to trade a bit of health for a load of mana, allowing you to ignore the defence and mana fields if you want to try your skill at hammering out life drain and heal spells in between Converts.

The rhythm aspect is definitely its strenth. The higher BPM, the more chaotic. Managing all three fields is ideal for defeating enemies within the time limit of the song and for the most fun in general, as you bounce seemlessly between defending, attacking, and recharging. On medium difficulty, it seems like the game is SIGNIFICANTLY more merciful: players do NOT have to have perfect coordination -- just have an arrow in the space of the outlines and you'll hit it. There's not ""perfect"" or ""ok"" score like in DDR to tell you how precise you were(n't). Perhaps this is changed in the higher difficulties, especially since the game mentions that players who are more musically inclined should play them.

One of the weaknesses of the game is definitely fatigue and pacing. For a rhythm game, there are NOT a lot of songs -- about 25 in total, including background music that isn't used in combat, when there are 7 floors of 3-4 enemies each with a boss on each floor. Before getting items to increase drop rate, you may spend 5+ fights on each enemy to acquire their drops. Even with decreasing the number of encounters, you will hear the same songs over and over again on different floors, though spaced out decently well so it's not completely repetitive. If you don't like the two artists who contribute 99% of the music or the combat system itself, then you will not enjoy this game for very long (I highly recommend checking out bits of the soundtrack; not every song is like Piano Jam or On Cue, they tend to be more like Super Fun or Derty).

The story starts off fairly cliche and parodying, but it develops over the course of the game. Voice acting is good regardless of content; as an indie game, it's interesting that the programmer/writer also voices the main character fairly well. I highly recommend sticking to it (assuming, of course, a seemingly weak story is the main sticking point to enjoying the game). The final boss throws a curveball into the setting if you didn't pick up the foreshadowing before, and there is a hidden ending. And, of course, perhaps you will enjoy the story throughout because of its humor; others have praised it, but I was ambivalent.

Overall, there's at least ten hours of gameplay, likely more for a 100% completion. It has a nice amount of replayability since the game allows you to change difficulty up to the third floor (wherein you should be able to decide the right difficulty for you), an incredibly low price, decent RPG mechanics, fairly unique rhythm mechanics, and servicable art (it's a rhythm game with THREE FIELDS, you have neither room nor need to show much more).

Сюжетная история неплоха, но очень плоская и без особых интриг и поворотов. Плюс игра предельна линейна, никаких дополнительных локаций и квестов. В музыкальном плане - крайне мало мелодий.

RPGとはいってもマップ上を歩き回るようなタイプではなく、キャラ同士の会話のみでストーリーが進み、戦闘で必要なアイテムを手に入れて進んでいく、という感じです。
この戦闘が非常にユニークで、売り文句通り完全にクラシカルな音ゲーです。
ただ敵の攻撃・自分の行動・自分のマナ回復が同時に進行するので、集中力が必要な上かなり忙しくなります。

難易度は自分にあわせることが出来、かつレベルをあげて物理で殴る（実際には魔法だけど）戦法が可能なので苦手な人でも安心です。

音楽系ゲームはデフォルトで使われている音楽の質も重要ですが、その点ではかなり良いと思います。
プレイしていて楽しい曲が多いです。

Que combina combates con una mecánica estilo Stepmania o Guitar Hero, con un sistema de crafteo y de estadísticas típico de los RPG.

Pros:
+La mecánica de combates me parece muy bien hecha y original, se divide en 3 paneles distintos para lanzar ataques, acumular maná o defender, dando lugar a varias estrategias.
+Variedad de hechizos y estrategias para el combate.
+La historia empieza un poco típica, pero mejora un poco, sin ser una maravilla.
+El añadir el sistema de estadísticas típico de los RPG, te permite ajustar el nivel de una fase si estás atascado.

Contras:
-Escasez de canciones, creo que apenas hay unas 6 o 8, que además no son mi estilo musical.
-No se puede cambiar la dificultad desde el piso 3 hasta acabar el juego, así que juega en un nivel que te resulte realmente fácil de primeras, porque el juego se complica.
-Si bien el sistema de crafteo y drops está bien pensado, le falta profundidad, y termina en una mecánica de grindear el objeto de ese piso que es mejor que el que tenías, muy lineal y predecible.

But I'm not going describing it in one word. I'm going to describe it in as many words as I can--and--hopefully in the clearest way possible. As the trailers will tell you Sequence is a lot like a DDR game. It has a great mix of rhythm and rpg elements laced within 4.99 (and as I write this review, 1.99) dollars of pure fun. The games mechanics sound difficult at first but once you get a grasp of them it really is just like a dance stepping game (dance stepping...yeah). You have three different fields, Magic, Defense, and Mana that you must use to defend yourself against a selection of creative monsters and even more creative (or perhaps creative-er...if that were a word) bosses in order to solve four things: Where are you? Who took you to said where? Who is this chick talking to you over an intercom system? Why the heck is there an intercom system in what looks to be a tower straight from a fantasy game? 
The games plot: You are a young man named Ky, a university student who was brought to some unknown world where each wrong move could essentially be your last. But not to worry though! A very slick talking female voice is there to help you through your adventure through conveluted tower. With her aid you'll hopefully beat all fo the bosses and get to the 7th floor of the tower and...well...that's all the game tells you.
One thing I will tell you though is if you are looking for closure this isn't the game for that. The ending to this game isn't bad--no I found it highly satisfying. But it felt very cliff hanger...y for a game that as of right now is just a one shot. I assume this is so it can have some kind of sequel. Something I personally have my fingers crossed for. The music is wonderful, I'd never heard of Ronald Jenkins before this game and let me tell you I'm glad I did. Go ahead and look up his music to get a taste of what you'll hear in-game. 
As with any grinding rpg you may find yourself feeling a bit bored from the repetitive fights, forging of materials through recipies and other little minute chores you have to do in the game. But I personally believe the music is what helps bring it together. Nothing ever really FEELS like a chore in this game. The monsters are relatively balanced, after you defeat and gather what you need for a boss you will feel like top dog for a few brief moments before getting brought back down a peg or two from the next monster one floor up. The only complaint I have is that the particle effect is too much for my computer and has a tendency to lag and affect your rhythm. This could just be my computer though. The dialogue is very well versed and thought out. Smooth gameplay mechanics and you rarely feel any mistakes made is anything but your own. 
And the item descriptions. Oh the item descriptions. 
Needless to say, I have a bit of a bias for this game and I want anyone reading this to take that in terms with this review. This is a very niche kind of game. If you love DDR games you'll love this to death I'm sure. But I do recommend checking it out for its low price alone.

Every combat is done in the way of a rhythm game like, say, Guitar Hero. With each battle you gain experience, materials and equipment, which you can all use to become more powerful, and face harder enemies, progressing through the story.
That may or may not seem like it works for you, but trust me, they've done a damn fine job with it!

You're Ky, and you wake up in a Tower, with amnesia. Everything inside feels like a weird game in which you're but a pawn. You life is in danger, or so you're told, and so you fight for survival, learning about the place and its purposes on the way.

While the story did feel a bit cheesy for the most part, it did have a few cool ideas, and a few twists to keep it interesting. It's not the main focus on the game, but I think it added quite a lot of character to it. 



There's not much in way of graphic style in this one. 
The graphics consist mainly of hand drawn backgrounds and characters, with a bit of animation when they talk. It's not bad, by any means, just not something that you'll play this game for.
Even during the battles, each spell you cast (more on that later) only produces a few sparkles as visual effects, but it's just enough not to feel empty. All in all, it's very simple, and let's you focus on the gameplay, while maintaining an appealing look. 
The only criticism I have of it is that certain spells will overload the screen with particles, obstructing necessary information.

Another thing, regarding the interface. Outside of battle it's nothing special, but it's certainly easy to navigate. But when in-battle, it gives you every bit of information necessary without having to look for it too hard. And this is a great since, since this game WILL challenge your multi-tasking abilities (in a good way!).
Good job on that! Keeping it simple, yet complete.


I would now talk about the music, but music and gameplay are directly tied in Sequence. So I'll try to summarize gameplay and then talk about its strengths and weaknesses.

As I said before, you're in a Tower. You're guided by Naia, who gives you recipes as you go along.
You go from floor to floor, with a Boss Fight in the end of each.
When you enter a floor, you'll be given recipes for Equipment, Spells, and a Key and Inhibitor for that floor. There are 3 enemies in each, which drop 3 different materials, for you to craft later. When you craft the key, you're able to unlock the door to the next floor, and fight the Guardian.

Your characters has Mana (to cast spells), Health, Defense (to lower the damage you take), and Offense (to increase the damage you deal through spells).
You can improve these either by leveling up, or by wearing different pieces of equipment. Equipment is mainly linear in its progression, without many sidegrades. 
Trinkets, on the other hand, are a bit different. These can improve your spells' cost, their cooldown, make battles harder to improve item drops, etc. These are actually more tailored for different types of gameplay, and some have pretty cool effects.
Some you get by crafting, others you can get by enemy drops.

The Inhibitor is used to lower the Guardians' effects (more on that later).

Then, there are spells. You can craft them, and then have to learn them. How do you learn them? You play a certain track on the game, with an added challenge (which can be a note streak, or a given accuracy). These are carefuly designed, as they would be in Guitar Hero, with different button presses following the notes' pattern (to an extent, of course).
They weren't too hard, mostly. But the final one was way more challenging, but also very fun to play, so I won't complain.

This pretty much it for when you're outside the battles.

How are the battles, then?
Well, there will be arrows falling, to the beat, and you'll have to press them. Pretty simple. But that's not all, of course.
(There are single notes, or doubles. For these, you have 2 sets of ""arrows"" on the controller/keyboard, to make it easier, specially on a controller. It works really well, and you'll find yourself a master of it by the end, and it feels great! The game does a very good way to constantly challenge you, making you better, without being frustrating.)

In every battle, you have 3 screens you need to pay attention to. 
One, is your Defense screen. Each arrow you miss here will damage you, so you need to keep an eye on it.
Another one is your Mana screen. This one has the same spell learning pattern, making it the closest to the song, with a lot more notes. Each failed note doesn't penalize you, but you gain one Mana for each note you strike, which is needed to cast spells.
Finally, you have your Spell screen. You have a spell wheel, with your different spells (you have a limited number that you choose outside the battles). Each has a different effect and costs more/less mana, with a bigger/lesser cooldown.
Each time you activate a spell, its notes will start dropping. The spell is cast if you strike them all. If you fail a single on, bye bye mana.

That's it, mostly. Your objective is to lower your opponent's life before he does yours. Every piece of information (damage dealt, received, mana, etc.) is easily visible to you, which is great.
You will be constantly switching between these 3 screens during the battles, which sometimes gets a bit chaotic at later stages, but never too bad. The whole game is a constant balance between when you can afford to take damage, when you need mana, and so on, rarely feeling stale!
With each enemy is a song associated, so you'll repeat some on them quite a lot for their items/experience, but it's not too grindy.

One more important aspect is the Guardians! Each one has a special ability, that'll mess you up, during their fight, and the fights in their floor. 
These can go from obstructing your different screens (so that you need to be there to see what's happening) to accelerating the tempo of the songs, or the last one, that switches the arrows. This one was diabolical. Everything you had learned goes to hell, and you need to play everything in reverse. But it doesn't last long, so it's all good. 
It's these differences that keep some of the battles very interesting, and you never know when it might throw you off of your comfort zone! 


The music was done by DJPlaeskool and Ronald Jenkees. It's a mix of electronic/synth music, with a bit of rock. It's wasn't something I was into at the start of the game, but it started growing on me. I ended up enjoying the music quite a bit, although I won't listen to most of it outside the game. 
Although, the last song, and so freaking epic... Man, I wasn't expecting that. That song had changes in tempo that worked great musically and from a gameplay standpoint! (It's called Piano Jam, search it on youtube). That one I'll be listening to for a while. Great job!

So, I enjoyed the music, but I do believe it lacks a bit in replayability comparatively with other rhythm games. But it's also a very unique and very well designed game. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected, and it had many brilliant design choices. 
There isn't much negative to say about it, really, aside from having to grind a bit, and perhaps looking a bit too simple. But even that didn't really lower the experience much for me.

I really enjoyed Sequence, and I think it does a great job of mixing the rhythmic combat and RPG elements.
One thing though, is that during the battles, while the notes do fall on the beat, there isn't as big of a connection to the notes and there is on the Mana screen (or the spell learning). Each spell has a pattern (with some random elements) that is independent of the song, and the enemies as well. So, it might not feel like like you're playing the music.
But I don't think it detracts from it too much, and those modes are still present.

Sequence is surprisingly great!

Some replayability since the gameplay is just super fun, but more (and different....) music tracks would have been nice.

Now, before you scroll past this review, hold up a sec. I never liked rhythm games either, and I'm having a blast with Sequence.

Why, you ask? Well, the whole rhythm part of the game blends seamlessly with the RPG aspect. Your character has an inventory, stats and all that RPG jazz (though no choice and consequence so it's not a REAL RPG!), and from his equipment and statistics come his fighting abilities. Ky (the hero) fights with spells, casting them at his enemy if you input the correct rhythm sequence. He also has to defend and regain mana, also done by inputting the correct rhythm. Now, while he's casting spells, he can't defend or regain mana, unless you quickly switch screens during your rhythm input, a tactic which is unnecessary in the beginning but becomes more and more vital as the game goes on, and spells start to have pauses between their prompts.

This whole combination of RPG and rhythm game is brought with wonderful humour. Don't expect silly puns, lazy groaners or pretentious in-jokes, the game just approaches everything with a healthy and snarky brand of humour, from the dialogues to the item descriptions. Of course, since it's a rhythm game, the music is a very important element, and it doesn't disappoint. You'll hear a lot of it, but it never bores. The composers enlisted by Iridium to score the game have done a great job, and all the music is extremely engaging to listen to.

Again, don't be surprised if you find yourself gnashing your teeth at the screen in the beginning. Once you learn to correctly input the prompts by listening to the music, instead of visually, you'll find it becomes a lot more manageable and you'll improve in leaps.

I really enjoyed this game, and I would highly recommend it.  :)  I also think it is worth the $5 on Steam.  

To give you a general idea of this game, it is similar to Step Mania only with an actual storyline.  If you don't know what Step Mania is, it's basically DDR (dance dance revolution) for the PC.  However, Sequence is kind of refreshing because it isn't just arrows flying up the screen to music.  In this game, you have three different sets of arrows that travel down the screen, and you have to switch between the sets.  One is your defense, one is your attack/magic, and the other is your mana.  This keeps things interesting and sometimes challenging (depending on the difficulty).  Yes, you are battling enemies instead of ""dancing"" to music like you would in Step Mania.

The storyline is excellent!  There are a few plot twists that you will not see coming, and the characters are very likeable.  The dialogue is probably one of my favorite parts of the storyline, and it had me laughing a few times.  The script is usually spot-on for some things that members of our generation would say.

As for the music, I like most of the music, but it gets very repetitive very fast.  You'll play through the same songs over and over.  Be prepared for that!  

The achievements are very reasonable, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to get all but one or two during your first play-through (unless you are doing the bare-minimum to get by).  There is one achievement, however, that you will not be able to get on your own unless you know a little computer programming.  That is slightly unfair in my opinion, but it is what it is.  If you do have knowledge of programming, you'll probably pick-up on it rather easily if you happen to see the right part.

As for the difficulties, I played through medium.  Throughout most of it, that was way too easy for me.  There were a few battles later on where I did have a challenge.  The good news is that you are allowed to change the difficult through the first three ""floors"" of the game.  However, things don't get super difficult until you get to the final floor.  If you happen to lose a battle, you still gain experience in most small battles.  You are also given a chance to repeat with no penalties.  This is actually really nice, especially in those bigger challenges.  However, it may make the game a little too easy for some of you hardcore gamers.

Its concept is a neat one, combining rhythm and RPG elements.

The best aspect is the writing and voice acting which are highly entertaining and make it compelling to play to the end. The third floor boss made me laugh more than any game character has in a long time.

The main weakness is that it can be very grindy - you have to use drops and pay XP to craft items, meaning you have to fight the same monster over and over again to get the items (each with a different percentage chance of dropping) and XP you need.

Плюсы, минусы и факты об игре:
↓ Стилистика ""по картинке на каждое действие персонажей во время катсцен"". Не люблю такую стилистику, потому что она напоминает мне казуальные квесты типа ""найди предмет, чтобы потом посмотреть катсцену и поискать предметы, чтобы потом... [короче, замкнутый круг]"".
↑ Музыка. В общем-то, она мне понравилась, хоть и не фанат Рональда Дженкинса. Хотя это уже на любителя.
→ Под свою музыку играть нельзя, только под встроенную. Ни плюсом, ни минусом назвать это нельзя. Просто факт.
↑ Персонажи и сюжет. Найя в какой-то мере мне вообще напомнила GLaDOS из Portal'а. Хотя остальные персонажи (да и сюжет в целом) довольно интересны.
↑ Геймплей. Основа: клавиатурный DDR (нажать стрелку в определённый момент) с примесью RPG системы (уровни, прокачка, крафтинг по рецептам, скиллы). Получилось довольно необычно и интересно. Если вы нормально относитесь как к одному, так и к другому — советую поиграть.
↓ Мелкие минусы всё же есть. Например, где убрать громкость звука, мне пришлось это делать через микшер. Или же немного неудобная система меню. Или же немного непривычный интерфейс со скиллами.

While other indie games like Limbo, Braid, etc., may make a better first impression with their stark visual style and challenging gameplay, Sequence is the game I find myself coming back to the most. It's just plain fun. The game has amazing replay value, too. The different difficulty settings mean you can always give yourself a new challenge, and if you happen to be lucky enough to own a PC compatible dance pad or guitar, then there are even more ways to play it, too.

I'm not a huge fan of rhythm, but I was pulled in by the game's deep strategy. There is a lot more to this game than just pressing buttons to the beat! In fact, there is so much more to it that it might be off-putting or confusing to some people. In order to be successful, you have to be good at multi-tasking, and there is no such thing as a perfect run on the songs (due to the three-screen system, missing some notes is inevitable).

The music is good, with all the tracks distinctive and crisp. The art style is so-so. Another interesting feature of this already interesting game is the story. With a game like this, I really would have expected a tacked-on story or even none at all. However, the developer put in a decent effort to make an engaging tale with a few twists and turns. It didn't blow me away, but it is by no means terrible. It's a little above standard visual novel quality, and while I wouldn't reccomend playing the game for the story alone, I think quite a few players will be pleasantly surprised by just how good it is.

The first thing I’d like to touch upon is the engaging gameplay. Think Guitar Hero, but more complex; directional arrows will fall from the screen and you must match them at the bottom, to the beat of the song. But where it becomes more complicated is that there’s “three screens” – one for offense (casting spells, which lowers your opponents health, heals you, etc.), one for mana (which is the resources for spells), and defense (in which you counter your opponent’s attacks; if you match the arrows, you don’t take damage, but if you don’t, you take damage equal to what the arrow is worth). This leads to a very fun experience, because you must decide on the fly if you want to cast X spell at that time, while managing mana and seeing if you want to finish that spell, or negate the damage incoming to you, etc. The spell must be finished completely, without mistake, to be cast; if you mess up one note, it doesn’t do anything, so the more rewarding the spell, the more difficult to pull off. I am not ashamed to admit that I had to shelf my “best” healing spell for a moderate heal because I could never pull it off. The game is at its best when you’re on equal terms with your opponent, having to juggle mana, spells, and defense. Unfortunately, the difficulty isn’t always there, and I’ve been able to literally completely ignore defense and just go for mana and spells. This is okay when the enemy is essentially a “gear check”, so to speak, but it happened more than I’d like. The game has seven floors (perhaps more, I’m currently on floor six of a stated seven), and each floor has a “special power” (that is designed to hinder you) for each fight: for the sixth floor, for example, you can’t see the screens you’re not currently selecting. Another power is that you’re unable to switch screens until the timer is expired, so you better make sure you’re on the defensive screen, or you’re going to be taking a lot of damage. 

 I would like to note that I was very surprised at how well the (controller, never tested the keyboard) controls worked; I was swapping screens and hitting notes effortlessly, and I can count the amount of times I was disoriented / confused on my hand. 

Being a rhythm game, the music is important, and Sequence delivers. I’d like to note that I enjoy it so much I’ll be throwing the tracks on my iPod for repeated listening. Said tracks are varied so it’s not just the same type of music, although I do wish there was more variety when you’re grinding; hearing the same song all the time on the same enemy did kind of get on my nerves. But, still, they’re good songs, so I don’t mind much. For each song, the tempo dictates how the notes are going to hit you: if it’s a slow song, there’ll be fewer notes, but they’ll count for more, while the opposite is true for frantic music.  

While the story does exist, it’s not very engaging. I am – as I’m sure a lot of others are – tired of the main character waking up and not knowing what’s going on / amnesia / what-have-you. The dialog between the main character and your ally is often amusing (they’ve had discussions which includes 4chan, “…like a Disney without hidden sexual innuendo, they were missing something”, etc.) that I’ve forgiven the absence of the story. And, without spoilers, the dialog made me care for the plot development about two-thirds of the way through the game, so the plot is a lot better than most games in this genre.

My largest complaint is the grinding required to advance in the story. I am at heart an RPG-enthusiast, so I really don’t mind grinding – usually I enjoy it. Sequence, however, doesn’t pull grinding off very well, though. The game employs a crafting element to the game, which is required to use to advance. You can craft items such as permanent health increases, items that disable the hindering “special powers” that each floor uses against you, and, most importantly, key items that allow you to challenge the boss for that specific floor. To get these specific items, you must defeat certain enemies, and upon defeating them, you have a percentage chance to get one of three items that they carry. This wouldn’t be so bad, except you must often get a 25% drop from multiple enemies, and this quickly becomes annoying when they pose no threat to you. Without said grinding, however, the game would be at least half as long, so I don’t mind it too much…but enough to complain about it. ;)

Another small complaint is the difficulty curve. In the beginning, it was about perfect for me and my difficulty setting (I chose the default “normal” difficulty), since I wasn’t fully aware of how to time the notes and how the game worked, etc. Then floors two through five didn’t give me many problems…and then the sixth floor is kicking my ass. I feel like they’re trying to prolong the game with unnecessarily high “gear checks” at this point. This would be more forgivable if said difficulty curve was more spread out and not super noticeable after having a very easy time previously.

Overall, I am very impressed with this gem of a game that I paid $1 for (among two other solid games). In fact, I like it so much that I played five straight hours of it one day, and am planning on putting all of the songs on my iPod to listen to later. 

While there are some small flaws in my eyes, the positives far outweigh the negatives. 

TL:DR = 8.5/10; 
Pro = Gameplay is very fun, music is great, fun dialog.
Con = Unnecessarily long, RNG-reliant grinding, spiked difficulty curve.

Sequence is basically a DDR/ITG + RPG mashup, which may sound odd, but it works pretty fluently. Even as someone who's been an avid fan of the four-arrow dance games for over a decade, it took me a while to get fully accommodated with Sequence's unique gameplay.

However, one thing I certainly did not expect from a game like this was a compelling plot with brilliantly well-written and fully voiced characters. Sequence's story gives the game a [i]lot[/i] of depth and was probably the driving factor for me. Definitely a huge highlight of this game.

I could nit pick for quite a while, though. The music isn't anything extraordinary, it can be a bit grindy at times (as both item crafting and item drops are chance based), and the battle interface could use a little bit of work to make it easier to see what spells are ready, what the mana cost is, how much you have at the time, etc. Since I played with the keyboard, having all the tutorials and controls based around a 360 controller was also a tad confusing.

There were 3-4 songs per level, and you sometimes had to play them over and over to harvest materials. And also a limited number of artists. I get it, it sucks to pay for licensing, but when the majority of your game requires that you listen to music while pecking at a keyboard, you might want to make sure you get a few more songs.

Firstly, the gameplay is spot on. Like most rhythm games you are simply required to hit buttons in time to the music, but Sequence has some interesting mechanics. You have three lanes of incoming notes that you can switch between at any time. One of them is defensive; any notes you miss here deplete your health. In another lane you must time your button presses to increase your mana, which is used for spellcasting. The third lane is for the spells themselves. Once you cast a spell you need to hit a short sequence of notes in this lane for the spell to actually take effect.

This leads to quite a frenetic experience where you're constantly shifting between offense and defense. It can be frustrating and it takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's pure gaming bliss that rivals the old classic Amplitude, not to mention Guitar Hero.

The other, and possibly more significant, reason to play this game is the music. Much of the music is provided by Ronald Jenkees, a man of prodigious melodic talent. I've played Sequence for a good few hours, but I've spent much, much more time listening to the music of Jenkees. It's truly phenomenal, and even if you have no interest in this game I'd recommend checking it out.

Sequence is not perfect. There are RPG elements, and while they work well enough I can't help thinking that so, so much more could have been done with them. I'm put in mind of Puzzle Quest, another game which combined RPG elements with a totally different style of game, but did it in a much more dynamic way. Perhaps the makers of Sequence didn't have the time or resources to go that far, but I do believe they could have come up with something a little more compelling that repetitive grind they've got in this game.

Tout d'abord en voyant le trailer je me suis dit :
oh on dirai du guitar heroes !
oh y a des éléments de rpg !
oh y a une histoire ! (non ça c'était pour pas m'arrêté à 2 oh ... !)

me suis dit quand j'ai commencé le jeu, bon allez hop difficulté la plus dure, histoire de voir ce que ça donne.
je fais le tutorial et commence mon premier combat.

Déja dans le tuto, il nous est indiqué comment lancé un sort, le premier sort il m'a fallut 5 essai pour réussir à presser les 3 pauvres touches au bon moment ... la faute à un système qui dit que si tu clic une demi seconde avant ou après que le symbole passe sur la fleche bah c'est foiré tu recommence ... 
me suis dit, ok c'est normal je jou en mode de difficulté la plus dure, normal faut être synchro ...
ce que je ne savais pas, c'est que le mode de difficulté était désactivé et laissé sur 0 pendant le tuto.

Donc mon combat commence, difficulté 4, en quelques seconde je perd 15 points de vie sans rien comprendre, je vais sur le panneau de sortilège pour lancer mon sort, et là au lieu d'avoir mes trois touches à presser ... il y en a facile 20 à faire avec deux voir trois touches à presser en même temps à des intervalles d'une demie seconde chacun ...

...

ok je remet la difficulté au minimum, OUF ça repasse comme dans le tutorial ... 

je poutre un mob puis deux puis trois ... ça s'enchaine et là je peux plus jouer lol.
parce que si vous dépassez un certain level, vous pouvez toujours aller dans le jeu, vous pouvez toujours bidouiller votre inventaire ... mais si vous voulez vous battre POUF le jeu plante, invariablement vous empêchant de continuer votre partie, bien vue hein ? ;)

The game tries extremely hard to be hip and ironic.  Using references of date rape, crystal meth, and getting stabbed by a hobo in less than 1 minute to get you to say: YEA, THIS IS HIP!

It's a huge grindfest that just wares down compared to other grind games [like Knights of Pen and Paper].  You have to find items by selecting monsters to fight, then craft items from those items found, but you have to spend xp to increase the rate of success.

It's 5 dollars, sure, but it's not at all worth that.

It has a lot of things it's trying to do, but all of them are executed poorly.

I don't know why I bought it and when it was over a piece of me went with it.
Truely one of the few inde games you will apreciate.

Sure I like some fun rythm games every now and then and maybe some games that will challenge me to be a better player, but what keeps me hooked until the end is that storyline. I'm all about the feels and this game's storyline delivers it.

STORY: 10/10
Everything about this game feels like a budget game, but the voice acting and the music and thought put into the story developement drove it home for me. I truely felt like I was experiencing all of the hard work each person put into this game I even took a moment of pause and watched the credits. its that good.

GAMEPLAY: 8/10
Lets be honest, rythm games are very hard to be creative with. You can only do so much to make a person appriciate the music and stay with the beat before it becomes too difficult or too generic.  They did a great job with attempting to give you more than just a beat to hit some buttons with, they gave you enemies to hammer down and spell combos to add a twist to the mix of some pretty good beats. 

At first, juggling through 3 different rythm windows in a battle along with a timer taunting you to the very nano second to hammer out the best moves orElseUlolFail@life can be intimidating, but it actually makes a ton of sense and you feel like youre really battling it out with some baddies while head bobbing to the beat. For what they had to work with, this is something to really try out for yourself.

ART: 8/10
This isnt some blockbuster game that had millions of dollars backing it along with teams of graphic designers, so dont expect amazing CG movie like animations here ladies. The art for each stage is very unique and even melds with the music and the tone of the story. The characters do seem budget like, but by no means are they generic.

REPLAY: 5/10
Sometimes the replay has to justify the price, and this game definately had the opportunity to get some DLCs going of side quests, a battle arena for other players, hell even an after the tower storyline. I really did enjoy the game for what its worth, but after playing the entire thing including the extras in the first run I wished there was something more to comeback to later on.


Conclusion: I know you will pass buy this game as your browsing through the store looking for a quick fix and overlook it. I honestly dont recall what made me buy it in the first place, but I am glad I did and I am pretty sure you will be too. If youre that strapped, its just 5 bucks and you get a lot more bang for your buck from this game than you would for whatever 5 bucks can get you nowadays.

It's fresh and funny. The concept of a rhythm game mixt with RPG is well executed. The voice acting is great and I Iove the light and humorious dialogues. The more I discover about this game the more I want to keep playing. 

Even if it's a great game, I wouldn't recommend it to people who have difficulties with rhythm (didn't look through all the difficulty levels though).

Dance Dance Revolution style games have always seemed a little dodgy on a control pad, but Sequence amps up the difficulty by introducing three separate fields -- defense (missed notes hurt you), spells (getting all notes in a spell casts it) and mana (a constant stream; each note hit gives +2 mana).

Monsters drop various items, which can be crafted into new spells, weapons, armour, accessories, and the key required to face that floor's miniboss. My biggest issue with the game, as it happens, is that the various random events -- random drops, percentage to succeed/fail at crafting -- can be frustrating when luck is not on your side. You might find yourself fighting the same monster a dozen times before getting a key item supposedly dropped in 42% of battles.

But the art is good and the writing is great, even if the story does fizzle out somewhat as it becomes more serious. The item descriptions are especially fun; with very few exceptions they are awful, awful puns. (An example off the top of my head is the Lightwave Sword: ""Also Lightparticle Sword.""

The game is great, it possibly has one of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard on an indie game and the arstyle looks absolutely beautiful with some nice visual effects. The combat relies on a typical rhythm match game, where you have to press each key at the right time and it’s probably better if you don’t try to press the keys when you see them on the right spot but when they coincide with the music “beat”. The combat screen is divided in three different fields, the Mana field which everytime you match a certain key you regain mana and mana is used to cast spells, the Spell field where you need to match keys everytime you activate one spell and if you miss one key of the combo the spell casting cancels and you still loose your mana and the last field is the Defense field in which everytime you miss one of the keys on this field, that key will deal damage to you. That is about it for the combat, everytime you beat an enemy you’ll gain experience and loot, each enemy can drop three different items and those items are either equipables or crafting materials. The story takes you to a tower where you’re guided by a girl named Naia via an intercom and she explains to you how everything works and that you need to reach the top of the tower which has 7 floors and in order to proceed to the next floor you need to find the required materials to craft the key to unlock the door for the next floor and also defeat the guardian of each floor at the start of it, from what I understand these battles with the guardians are considered boss battles. On each floor you have a safe room where you can equip yourself, craft new items and spells and also learn and practice your spells and also this is where you’ll unlock the door leading to the next floor and where you can choose to battle enemies, from what I saw there’s three different enemies per floor.  I’m gonna be honest and you can probably see by my playtime according to Steam, I only reach the second floor and I’m currently fighting the second guardian but I’m pretty sure II won’t play Sequence anymore, not because I don’t like it, because I really do, but because I’m extremely bad at rhythm games and I found the battles to be rather frustrating for me, which might end up with me taking alot of time in order to beat the game and that kinda makes me sad because I’d love to experience the whole story and unfold the mystery behind Sequence and its world, from what I’ve saw thus far the story seemed to promise but I disliked the voice acting in this game but I do believe you can turn it off on the options menu if you don’t like it either. Sequence is certainly a very unique game and a very good one indeed, but like I’ve said, if you’re not good at rhythm games you’ll have a hard time with it, eitherways you should totally give it a try, it is totally worth your time and money but unfortunately it’s not my kind of game.",1388014505,1388014505,True,3,0,0.553571403026580811,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The last thing you know you were getting ready for bed and now you're here. A girl over the intercom tell you you're in a tower with seven floors and that you have to get to the top to get out. That's it. Oh, and by the way, you have to fight monsters and floor guardians in rhythmic RPG-ish-style battles. Are you confused yet? I was.

This game features four difficulty modes and I have to admit I played this on the easiest setting, which for a rhythmically challenged person such as myself was hard enough on the last couple of boss fights. You are free to change the difficulty around in the beginning, though, since you can switch up until the third floor. 

The gameplay consists of fighting monsters by switching around three different 'fields'. There's a defensive, mana, and offensive field where you need to correctly push up, down, left, right according to the sequence they come down in. The trick is in juggling these three fields, since you're not able to play them all at the same time. When notes (I'll just call them that) come down in the defensive field and you miss them, you gain damage. To damage the opponent, you need to cast spells and hit the right notes in the spell or offensive field. To regain the mana you spent by casting spells, you need to go to the mana field where hitting the notes restores mana. There are quite a couple of spells in this game, ranging from healing spells to direct offensive spells to damage over time. At first it can be a bit confusing, but it does get easier over time. I personally played this game with a controller and often found myself pressing the wrong buttons when in a rush to reach the right field, causing me to miss notes. For me, the controls as such were something to get used to, but maybe it's easier when playing with a keyboard. 

After each battle you gain a certain amount of XP and there's the possibility of getting items. While XP is used to level Ky, the protagonist, up, it is also used as a currency. On every floor you are given a couple a recipes you can use to synthesize items, gear, and spells. In order to do so, you need to invest some XP into the synthesizing process, a little more if you want a better change of success or a little less if you want like gambling. Spells can be learned by synthesizing scrolls and then 'using' the scrolls - again, with XP. You then need to finish one of the songs with a certain percentage of correct notes or a certain combo streak. The spells learned can then be put into your ring of spells, which starts out with two slots but increases to six as you progress in the game. 

 Now, the music. The music was the high point of the game for me, as most of the tunes were catchy and didn't really annoy even after a reasonable amount of time spent playing. Outside of the battles I cannot recall any kind background music, though I'm sure it was there. Just not memorable. The sound effects were all right, nothing much to say there. The voice acting on the other hand I really liked. I think the characters sounded real enough, though the script was a bit of a hit or miss at times: I think the topics of conversation and references made might not be everybody's cup of tea.

And last but not least, the story itself. So you start out with only knowing you need to get to the top of this tower with seven floors and that your shepherd, Naia, will guide you through via intercom. I won't spoil the story, but you won't find out much more than that until the end of the game. The ending itself, while explaining everything, felt a bit disappointing to me. If this game had relied on the story for its success, instead of the gameplay and banter among the characters, I don't think it would have worked out. 

All that said, I do recommend this game if only for the fact that it's so cheap and quite a lot of fun. It's not a very long game, it took me a small ten hours to complete from A to Z, but the fun to cost relation definitely says that if you're thinking of getting this game you should give it the benefit of the doubt.",1387972594,1387972594,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It was, at one point, called Sequence.


Before the Echo is a simple, yet fun rhythm game.

The plot isn't the greatest selling point of the game, but if you approach it as a riff off the Guitar Hero or Rock Band style game it is very enjoyable.  The music can start to feel a little repetitive at times, but the songs are enjoyable if you like the style.  Ronald Jenkees did the vast majority of the songs in the game, and many are available on his youtube channel for some samples.  

Your goal is to reach the top of a tower, while combating monsters with spells that you cast in a DDR style mechanic.  To complicate things, there are three ""areas"" that you have to swap between and work in- one for casting, one for regenerating mana, and one for defending yourself.  Winning a battle nets you some XP, and possibly up to 3 items.  The item drops and crafting mechanics seem designed to extend the length of the game, although I rarely felt like I was grinding unnecessarily.  There is something to be said for the practice associated with grinding drops and XP to burn on crafting, as the transitions in difficulty can feel a little rough here and there, and some of the spell casting sequences can take a bit of time to really feel natural.

The mechanics do feel contrived, but the game itself lampshades that fact.  Before the Echo doesn't take itself too seriously, and that is a good deal of the charm.  The music is great, and the art has a nice look and feel to it. 

 I have not tried playing with a controller, but the keyboard interface is simple enough to use that I don't think a controller is a requirement.  I was able to finish the game (including the ""hidden"" ending) on Medium difficulty without too much of a struggle.  I briefly toyed with the harder difficulty but I found that I enjoyed the game on medium enough that I didn't continue down the harder path.  The differences in difficulty seem to be entirely based on the number of symbols necessary to complete a sequence, and higher difficulties make more use of the two buttons at a time patterns (up+left, down+right, up+down, left+right) instead of just single inputs in order.

Overall, I think it was a fun game, worth a playthrough, and something I go back to from time to time just to play specific songs.  Worth the price of admission.",1387553062,1429890029,True,2,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It delivers this with surprisingly unique gameplay, an interesting story, and an excellent, albeit limited, selection of music to play along to.

In terms of gameplay, it's not unlike DDR in that you have four arrows that you have to hit to the rhythm as they reach the bottom of the screen while music plays in the background. However, the similarities stop there. Combat involves rotating between three screens: your damage screen, your mana screen, and your spell screen. The damage screen represents incoming attacks from your opponent, and each arrow missed on this screen will result in your health taking a hit. The spell screen is used for all of the abilities in the game, where you must select what type of spell you want to perform and then hit every arrow in that spell for it to succeed. The mana screen grants mana, for casting spells, with every arrow that is hit. As a result, the game turns into a very interesting experience where you have to time spells so that you don't take too much damage, and prioritize each of these screens so that you can keep yourself alive and deplete your enemy's health bar before the song ends.

When a battle concludes, loot is dropped. This loot can be used to craft specific items on each floor, such as new weapons and equipment, a key to get to the next level, and a few other secrets that are best observed within the game. Especially towards the end, there are some very interesting items that can be crafted, and a lot of secrets and hidden content. I highly recommend crafting every item in the game, waiting until after the credits, and then exploring a bit more based on what you learn. This game quickly becomes intriguing, and knows how to deliver on it.

One point of criticism I have for this game is that, if you're looking to craft all of the items in the game, it can get a little repetitive. Each enemy has the same song every time you fight them, and when you get close to the end, there are a few items that have pretty low drop rates. Having to repeat the same fight fifteen times in a row, as a result, can get a drab. Luckily, it's not the exact same pattern of arrows every time, and the gameplay is engaging and fun enough that I didn't find this to be much of an issue, but it is something worth mentioning.

If you're a fan of rhythm games, Sequence brings a twist on a traditional formula that makes it feel almost entirely new. I'm glad I put in all of the time that I did, and I think a lot of people would be surprised at how much they enjoy it.",1385831752,1385831856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If that sounds like heaven to you, then you're in for a good time. You battle monsters by completing sequences of notes, swapping between three different 'tracks' to attack, block, and charge up mana. 

The only major problem with this game is that it is *extremely* grind-y. To move past each level, you will need to craft a key, which requires collecting multiple items dropped from the monsters in that level. The monsters will only drop the items some of the time, and multiple items are usually required so you might end up fighting the same monster (and playing the same song) several times in a row. To make matters worse, crafting the items you need costs XP (meaning more battles to earn it back) and has a chance of failing (meaning even more battles to find all those items again). Playing the same song over and over again gets old very quickly.

The game plays like Dance Dance Revolution with the notes divided into 3 separate note tracks running concurrently on the screen for casting spells, defending against attacks and regenerating mana. There is a quirky story to pull you through to the end but what won me over was most definitely the music tracks behind the gameplay.

I can't really gauge how difficult it is to play for beginners to the genre due to my many years of playing rhythm games from Stepmania, Guitar Hero and my current timesink of Osu!. Anyone who has played such games should find no problems however with adapting to the mechanics.

Due to the RPG nature of the game, it can become a grind for specific items to drop on the monsters which are used to craft items needed to progress in the floors. The game does not come with any additional content beyond the story that I am aware of (I played mostly at release back in 2011).

Before the Echo wasn't the most challenging game personally but it sits in my game library as a comfortable purchase when I look back over two years.

One warning is that even casual gamers who would like to simply play the game and go through the story, might still face some moments where they have to engage battles over and over to get that last item for a recipe.

I don't hate Sequence because it at least tries to be a bit more generous while still failing to grasp an equitable balance of difficulty. I found most of the experience enjoyable because it's an RPG and it uses interesting mechanics so despite my implied ineptitude, I could apply strategy and grinding to bypass obstacles. It has great audio composition (being a rhythm game, I'd expect no less) and an interesting story. It alludes to a sequel that has yet to come at the time of this writing and the game's been out for some time, but I would probably enjoy it too.

I played the game on the medium difficulty and found it challenging, but fun. That broke down when trying to learn the last spell where the difficulty suddenly went to extremes. Because there's an achievement dependent upon successful acquisition of this spell, I found it necessary to replay the entire game on the easy difficulty and still found myself frustrated by the difficulty leap at the same point. Even when I reached the target I was given, it still would not give me the spell because (while not indicated at all) I had to exceed the target. If you want to complete the whole thing, play on easy. If you don't mind missing the achievement and finishing everything else, play on medium.

In this game, like in other rhythm games, you press different keys (in this case arrow keys) in the rhythm of music.

See some videos about this, if you want to know more as I am not going to explain this further in this review. 

This little gimmick is not bad, but it isn't revolutionary either.

Good plot,
Amazing dialouge,
Unique and very diverse artistic animation and setting,

przy Medium gra niepoprawnie wykrywa nasze uderzenia (noooo, pewnie mam zbyt nieczułe gumki pod klawiszami) nawet po kalibracji metronomu (opcja w menu).
Słuch mam dobry, klepanie punktów na Step-Manii przy 160bpm nie sprawiało mi problemu. Opcja Hard dla masochistów, lubiących ładować 4 paluchy na raz w swoje kursory (taki ""fingering""), oraz jeszcze jedna, rzekomo Super Hard, ale co z tego, skoro tempo swoje, a silnik swoje...

You have 3 different... let's call them ""beat displays"":
One is for mana (which you need for your attacks or for healing yourself), one is for your attack/s and one is for blocking the enemy's attacks.

初期作为一个接触过劲乐团类（也即节奏地带类）的玩家，一开始会觉得它搞3个屏幕都掉Note这种设定不好，但是事实证明，这游戏玩的就是一个手按Note，俩手按就是耍赖，另一只手就是用来切屏和放技能的。
这游戏到目前为止一次没更新过，牛逼的是它一点都没有Bug。唯一的一次我在一台新电脑上启动，启动不起来，后来才查出来是缺VC++ 2008运行库。关于这个问题我向开发者发过邮件（下详）。另外，就是这个游戏的整个装备和物品系统说明的不够详细，玩家都是玩到最后才知道这些东西怎么搞才对。这是目前发现的唯一问题。
2D画面对机器要求不高这个就不多作说明了，原画画的还算不错。
音乐，作为一个上述玩家，开始会觉得第一首钢琴很慢很慢，没劲，事实上，回过头来听这首Loui，你会发现很有深度，没错，这游戏很多对战曲目都是用的大名鼎鼎的Ronald Jenkees的作曲。回过头来你再看看这些音乐，确实相当值得回味，尤其是诸如Disorganized Fun这种即兴创作出来的，而整曲又完全没有重复的地方，实属罕见，也说明此音乐家是奇才。但是Sequence有没有拿到版权我就不知道了，我应该非常感谢Sequence让我认识了Ronald Jenkees和他的音乐。
剧情我只看了个大概，不过他们设定了ARG和隐藏元素在里面，使得游戏更具有可玩性。好在这游戏的成就不被难度干涉，不但如果真上了专家级，我俩手也就只有照顾Note的份，简直顾不了切屏和放技能。所以说，如果这游戏像节奏地带那样有难度干涉性成就，估计还真是一堆人解不了，我也得花些时间。
装备和经验升级系统也是本作的亮点，让游戏过程更具有策略性，而不是一味的按Note。
最后说一下技术支持，如上所述，我认为开发组缺了支持包，建议加上，他们不但3分钟内立即回复了，解释了下可能只是个巧合问题，不过回复内容不在关键，回复时间和回复人才是关键——没错，正是本作的主创和主角Ky的配音亲自给我回复的。这种级别的技术支持，你懂的。",1350023699,1387787531,True,6,0,0.543800771236419678,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I also like the morality script skillfully integrated in the game especially at the end that makes you agree or disagree to some point.

The combat simple is fairly simple to learn and difficult to master and also helps improve your reaction skills and challenges your tactics. I play DDR and ITG so it felt like I was home.

I love some of the music track, could've had more variety but for an indie like this is just amazing.

Sequence is a game that most people would ignore. At first glance, its just a Guitar Hero inspired simple shovelware game, right? WRONG. Sequence is a GREAT game, and I will tell you why. 

- The music is fantastic, comming from YouTube legend Ronald Jenkees.
- The switching between screens and casting of spells makes for a great improvement of the otherwise single-minded GH style games. 
- The story is also not to be underestimated. It's more engaging and introspective than most games you will have played. 
- There is a lot of humour to be found in the game; almost every item name and description is a joke.
- Even the credits are engaging and fun to sit through. Great game design from the start of the game until the very end.
- A level of difficulty for everyone, with a good curve.

If you are still not convinced, just watch the trailer and see the greatness of the game and the person behind it.",1343003301,1343003301,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's painful.  If you watch the trailer and listen to one of the devs trying way too hard to be hip while describing the game, you'll understand why it turned out this way.

Sadly the music is a low point as well.  You would think in a game built entirely on timing, music and rhythm that the audio tracks would be a high point, but all of these tracks feel like recycled DDR tunes.

You might, however, change your mind, not only because I led my review by saying 'you wouldn't think', but also because it is pretty much an RPG with the mechanics of a rhythem game. Which sounds sort of repellent when I say it that way, but I'll just reiterate how great it is.
For one thing, the combat mechanism is ingenious, forcing you to choose between offense, defense, and the ability to actually do anything, meaning that you can't just turtle up, you have to be doing multiple things at once. This is complicated by restricting you to a certain time limit to resolve your combats. When you factor in the occasionally crippling difficulty (especially if you joined me in suicide and started on the hardest difficulty setting)...shit's hard. Which is great.
For another thing, it has a pretty decent story behind it (and not a few dramatic twists), and some quirky ARG elements behind one of the achievements, which I thought was a fun touch.
Of course the RPG elements are only in the sense that you can 'level up' and 'have an inventory', but the decision between taking levels and ensuring crafting successes is another cool touch.

You'll be switching between three sets of scrolling DDR style arrows: one for incoming damage that is blocked by accurate hits, another (typically containing the most difficult pieces of the song) recharges your Mana pool on accurate hits, and a third for spells. Spells are cast with the right analog stick, which (after a delay) sends down a specific rhythmic snippet that changes it's tempo to fit the current song (the specific direction of arrows changes every time you cast, and the difficulty level also changes the spells, making the more complicated versions of the same basic rhytmic idea). 

The game has you madly flying between these screens to defeat enemies before the song ends--it's one wierd, wild ride and it's well worth it. Battles are tense and fascinating, and there's a lot of room for varied play styles in your spell collection of choice as well as a lot of room for growth within the broad difficulty span. There's even a practice mode where you can just play through the full songs in a more standard rhthym game format. Highly recommended.",1325399240,1385428832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Interesting game with well voice-acted dialog sequences. The game is like an RPG mixed with DDR (or other Rhythm games) but for your fingers.

Difficulty:
The screenshots and videos make it seem a lot more complicated than it actually is.

There's a tutorial that seems to comprehensively cover the game mechanics.

Controls:
You can play this game with a keyboard, but I'd recommend that you have an XBOX360 controller to play this game as it seems to be designed for it.  I don't think you can use a dance mat to play the game; it requires more buttons than are typically on mats.

Now i'm gonna be honest here. From the boredom gameplay i'm getting from Stepmania, and similar DDR games with no intensity whatsoever, and from there are so many indie games i am ""meh"" at, i expected this game to be no diffirent.

Turns out i was wrong on many levels. This game surpasses basic expection i thought this will be.

The combat is a nice idea, but poorly executed. You pick an enemy from a list (I know, right?) and then fight it by pressing buttons on the beat of the music. It's nothing fancy, and about everything is text based, items included. 
You explore the tower by picking levels from a list as well. Wait, what?

Ok. So this game is like... It's like 3 DDR matches going on at once. You have to beat one to stay alive, and another to kill the opponent. It's all about prioritizing, while still keeping up the rhythm.

It's got writing that's actually funny (like Recettear), and it's fully voice acted. I didn't think I would care at first, but the voices make the writing pop even better. It's definitely aimed at our age group, but not in the sense that it's corny like Saved by the Bell, but more like someone our age actually worked on it.

Also, it has Ronald Jenkees in it. I found that enough to be worth the $5 alone.
