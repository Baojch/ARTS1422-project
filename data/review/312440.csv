The graphics are great, the cinematics are nice, the sound is... ok.

But the game play and controls are terrible.

1. The game itself is a huge RNG fest. The best you can manage is a 66% shot at point blank range. It's really tedious to be missing so much with very little ability to improve those odds
2. It's a squad grid with 4 way directions. It's really tedious
3. The controls are horrible. You have to use RMB scroll, push-edge or keyboard movement is waaaay to big so you won't be able to see anything. And the controls are too clicky. I suspect it's a tablet port. It certainly feels like one.
4. The missions play more like puzzles than a tactical game
5. It's a poormans Templar Battleforce. It isn't even as good as Steam Marines. It's certainly no Space Hulk, which it's clearly riffing on.

I have no problem with random but this just feels more random than most games.  High odds are basically 50% or maybe 66% only so you will be missing a lot and so will your enemies.  With the small number of units involved, you will often feel like you win or lose more because of luck then because of good tactics unfortunately.  This really hurts the game.

Beyond that, the game is extremely short with almost no story to hold it together.  Steam says I played almost 10 hours but that is incorrect as I forgot and left the launcher running a few times, 2 of those were pretty long.  So maybe 8 hours only and that is with the very long 2-3 hour tutorial (which is needed).

Not much to say beyond that.  Just that there is not much variety with with only 2 enemy unit types and objectives of basically kill stuff, move to an area or carry something to an area.

Duration: 8 hours

3 hours for tutorial campaign and 5 hours for main campaign.

Legions of Steel is a computerised version of the 1992 board game.  It is very similar to Space Hulk and pits marines against machines (instead of genestealers).  

There are some nice options such as suppressing fire and advanced ""overwatch"" options. But it does feel like a lesser version of Space Hulk lacking in-depth customisation, alternate squads and close combat. 

The tutorial teaches you how to play with some almost puzzle style scenarios (where shots always hit) to learn the rules.  Although I never did used advanced overwatch targeting in the main campaign.  

The main campaign had some fun scenarios, and most can be played in less than 15 minutes.  The campaign and missions did feel to lack depth.  There is multiplayer options which I did not try, but I don't believe there is much action to be harnessed.  

Overall, I'd have to recommend Space Hulk:Ascension over Legions of Steel.",1496824011,1496824011,True,35,0,0.816578507423400879,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I like the game idea. And I am not deep enough into it to say how bad it is. But the tutorial is... astonishing!

In some of the first missions, all shots fired, yours and that of the enemy, will hit. (Hit always equal kill). No matter the cover or if your soldier makes a backflip before he shoots with both eyes closed with his right toenail, he will hit. The thing is, the game doesn't tell you that. Try and error baby!
This creates not only hillarious moments, where you blow everything the game showed you before into the wind, (positioning, cover, etc.) you even have to do it, and act in complete non sensical ways to complete the missions.
Even better, in some of these missions, the AI will go into complete full retard mode, so the player can follow the complete retarded mission objectives. what I mean with this are enemy soldiers who for one mission dont use overwatch (they did before, now they don't because... ? Design ? idk?) or activley try to show you their back.

What wouldn't be so bad, if the game would not had let you fight a mission against a real Ai before. The tutorial (now 7 misisons in, still in tutorial) trains you to play in a way that will let you loose every match, because it forces you to ignore all the realy important basic things in it.

Eben sehr maschinell fast gnadenlos, wenn man nicht besser als die Maschinen ist wird man sehr effizient eliminiert. Pure Strategie muss man hier anwenden. Das Tutorial ist sehr wichtig weil Legions of Steel eine ganz eigene Spieldynamik hat man lernt wie man überlebt und Gefahren eliminiert oder aus dem Weg geht. Wenn man sich durchs Tutorial gekämpft hat ist man der Kampagne gewachsen in der man auf tolle abwechslungsreiche Szenarien und vor allem Herausforderungen trifft die so ziemlich immer den vollen Einsatz fordern. Man kann auch Skirmish Matches gegen Maschinen erstellen, wobei man auch als Gegenseite spielen kann, ist auch sehr lustig. Multiplayer ist auch möglich, in dem natürlich auch ein Kampf zwischen Maschinen und Soldaten ausgefochten werden kann, ist jedoch leider wenig besucht.

This game gives you a LOT of options.  Many more than most of the newer turn-based tactical shooters currently being released.

This is really the opposite of space hulk (powerful military might in small number against an endless hoard of lesser intelligence beasts). The concept in this game instead of dissimilar opponents, is much more based on two more equal enemies in terms of intelligence and weaponry. The difference between the games is very much worth your money because this title really has its very own feel and in a very good way. I did encounter a bug where the enemy turn would keep running forever so i had to restart. Apart from that very minor annoyance, the game is absolutely fun and challenging.

The Past has hit the Present with an all new way to play the classic board game, Legions of Steel.

This game was released yesterday ( July, 16th, 2015) on the PC.  I heard about it last night, and instantly started doing research about it.  As mentioned before, I tried to help with the Kickstarter and after it didn’t go through, I was bummed.  Yes, I probably could have tried to keep up with the Legions of Steel news and watched it develop, but I didn’t.  Call me lazy, or busy, but for whatever reason it dropped off my radar.

Right now I’ve played multiple hours of the game.
Holy crap is it fun!  I didn’t even bother to run the tutorial or the rules, I wanted to approach it with the rules I learned when playing the board game all those years ago.

Let me tell you, while it’s not identical to the board game, it’s really damn close!  I mean, it would be impossible to mimic every element of the board game, but to be honest, some of those rules were thick to understand to begin with.  This PC version takes the guesswork out of it and inject pure fun into your eyes.

The graphics are wicked cool, the music is haunting and exciting at the same time.

The Setting:
The Future.  Okay, we just took the Past, mashed it with the Present, and now we are flinging it into the Future!  Whhheeeeeeeeee!!!!!
The League of Aliens and the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.) have teamed up to keep at bay a new threat to the galaxy, The Machines.

GamePlay:
Legions of Steel is a tun based game.  Each unit has it’s own set of skills and characteristics.  Different weapons can be used and sometimes you have to use the map as a weapon itself!
You can also choose to play singleplayer missions or go against another player in multiplayer mode.
In the board game’s set up, players took turns setting up snap together cardboard tiles that created the scenario you were to play in.  As best as I can tell so far, you do not do that here, all of the maps are premade.

Platforms:
Right now Legions of Steel is available for the PC and iOS.  At the time of this writing there is no release date yet for Android but I will update with one when I find out!

The Cost:
You can purchase it for a measly $18.00 from Steam or from the iTunes store!  EIGHTEEN bucks!  That’s dirt cheap for this wicked cool game!  Hell, the board game itself was about $60.00!

Bottom Line:
GO GET THIS GAME!

Avec Sovereignty, DIstant Worlds, Star Hammer et maintenant ce Legions of Steel, ces développeurs sont désormais bien ancrés dans mon top 5 des créateurs de jeux.

Legions of steel est une adaptation d'un jeu de plateau déjà très ancien, dont les bases de gameplay sont similaires à des jeux comme Space Hulk ou Warhammer Quest. Nous dirigeons donc une escouade fragile dans des couloirs et des salles, et nous devons faire face à la menace des Machines (dont la tronche évoque d'ailleurs plus des morts-vivants que des robots!). Tout cela est bien sûr en tour par tour et fait copieusement appel à votre sens tactique.

Autant ne pas tergiverser : cette adaptation est brillante, fabuleuse, et pourtant, on sait comme il est difficile d'adapter des jeux de plateau en jeux vidéos, même pour des licences aussi prestigieuses que celles de Games Workshop (la première itération de Space Hulk le jeu vidéo n'était franchement pas terrible, et Warhammer Quest a fait grincer pas mal de dents).

La force du studio qui a développé le jeu (des français, s'il vous plait^^) est d'avoir compris qu'il fallait garder un aspect jeu vidéo. Du coup, ils ont intégré une double campagne, agrémentées de magnifiques cinématiques en BD type comics américains du plus bel effet. Et ils ont assorti cette campagne d'un mode escarmouche, d'un mode multijoueur et, tenez-vous bien, d'un mode hot seat. La présence du Hot Seat vaut l'achat à lui seul tant le simple fait de pouvoir se lancer dans une partie avec un pote sur le même ordi est dantesque.

Bande son nickel, ergonomie ax petits oignons, j'ai bien du mal à trouver quoi que ce soit à redire.
Si vous aimez un tant soit peu les jeux d'escouade tactique au tour par tour, vous tenez là un fleuron du genre, je vous le garantie. Un grand bravo à Matrix/SLitherine.

J'ai fait une vidéo de présentation du jeu ici :

The sleek sci-fi artstyle and mechanical ambient music merge to create a dark surreal galactic canvas bathed in deep red slaughter. The look of LEGIONS OF STEEL conjures up comic book memories of ALIEN LEGION and games i used to play on the Commodore Amiga 500 which delivered the whole package in a very visceral satisfying potent way. Its a fun kind of tough where even losing feels exhilarating all the while learning from ones mistakes and going back into the fray to attempt to do better.

In LEGIONS OF STEEL combat flows with graceful lethal elegance as units move in a battle ballet of death seeking to achieve the most advantageous tactical position to annihilate their foes. Engaging the enemy means knowing when to do certain command maneuvers such as a strafing attack where the combatant steps out into the open to blast the Machine enemy with metal shredding fire then fade back into cover with such speed one forgets this is a turn based marvel of strategic controlled chaos as they would say in the old ALIEN LEGION comic books.

Player and enemy turns are geniously done via table top style dice roll to see who wins the intiative to decide which side moves first. This adds another level of strategy as the player with the initiative roll may decide its better to let the enemy move first as they wait for that right momemt to engage in a ambush maneuver. Before each firing encounter the player can click on the fire panel to see what modifiers are effecting their chances of getting a hit or not thus allowing them to make a decision to fire, move to a more advantageous location or wait until they are in a better situation to engage such as when grenades with different vision and area effects are making for a difficult successful shot or one of your fellow Commandos is in your line of fire thus making for a penalty modifier to hit. Ah wonderful wonderful modifiers! 

Then there are throwable weapons like the force wall which comes in extremely handy in desperate situations when the enemy needs slowing down or their line of sight blocked buying the player some time to gather their wits and launch a counter attack or retreat to more advantageous ground. The Machine enemy also have their own plethora of grenade weapons which effect the battlefield or just outright kill those who stand against their all consuming might.

Have i mentioned yet that there are also ballistic and energy weapons?

Animations compliment the futuristic art style perfectly giving inhuman alien menace to The Machines and vigilant heroic stature to The Commandos. Storyboard screens are rich with comic book artistry alive with violently valiant imagery urging the player to continue their war against The Machines.

There is both a lengthy campaign mode and skirmish mode where you can play either as the desperately fighting for survival Commandos or the indomitable relentless Machines. For those who desire for more fleshlike opponents there is hot seat as well as multiplayer for your.. special needs.

Music and sound effects transform my reality into unreality as i suddenly find myself in a science fiction audioscape as if out of the movies FORBIDDEN PLANET and ALIEN among many other forboding paradise nightmare worlds. Truly audiophile elite level of quality.

Studio Nyx has outdone themselves by making a faithful adaptation to the board game that features Electronic Warfare (Fog of War that would make Space Hulk take notice), balanced gameplay with varied character classes, and a rather extensive list of maps and objectives to complete on each mission. Those who have played the old school XCOM games (or Xenonauts) or Space Hulk will fit right in with this one. It's a little more fast paced than either but if one mistake is made, your whole team is going down, all the same. As a side note, I love the artwork in this game too... makes me think of old Comic books. This for only 19.99 is a damn good deal. Cheers, Slitherine Group.
