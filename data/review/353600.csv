В поисках рпг в библиотеке наткнулся на проект SPELLBIND. Думая, что это очередной треш - запустил и застрял в игре на два дня... Наш главный герой - рыцарь, который отправился в замок уничтожить дракона. А дракон спрятан за кучей дверей, к которым нужны ключи. Чтобы получить каждый ключ нужно пройти головоломку или убить несколько монстров. Головоломки довольно качественные и заставляют мозги шевелить. Боевка в игре тупенькая и сделана под ММО - побегаем к монстру и бьем магией и ударами на кнопки от 1 до 0 или кликая мышкой по графическим картинкам магии. Магия разная и использовать мы её будем всю. Порадовало, что монстры не совсем тупые и если мы изучаем заклинание, то и они его изучают. Бои будут на равных... В конце игры, если конечно до него дойти ждет битва с большим драконом. Мне игра понравилась. Она очень проста в графике, монстров всего 3 вида и в основном надо бегать туда сюда с ключами и гадать головоломки, но что-то в этой игре есть... Определенно. Рекомендую, но строго любителям подобных игр. Это не ААА проект...

TLDR: Primitive and underpar Dark Souls. Poor artificial intelligence. Clumsy combat. Improper hitboxes. Lever hunt progression.

Not much to say here, you control a knight, combat is handled with a pre-populated toolbar with cooldown actions. Artificial intelligence of foes is poor they are spammed across castle sections, you engage in clumsy combat with them until you find the correct lever or object to open areas until you find a key, then you backtrack and try every locked door you ever met until something unlocks and you rinse and repeat. Voice acting is rather poor, setting is as generic as it gets, not entertaining. The combat is rather weaksauce hitboxes are vague and there is no real parry, block or dodge mechanics, you mostly just kite foes one at a time, take them out and abuse health kits that auto respawn to keep afloat.",1498511195,1509673436,False,1,0,0.501474916934967041,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
I really wanted to give Spellbind a fair chance. I read the vast majority of negative reviews and still wanted to find some redeeming points to this game. Sadly, they were few and the only good aspect to this title, might be the generic yet decent enough 3D graphics and sound selection. That’s about it. Everything else from the AI, short gameplay and the downright game-breaking controls, make Spellbind feel highly unpolished even for an Early Access (which this game, is not) state. I received it in a well priced bundle but I can’t stress enough how much this RPG is overpriced for what it offers. If you can’t buy it at a sizeable discount, simply move on and seek far better alternatives. I can’t believe it doesn’t even offer Cards or Achivements to bolster its value to a marginal point at the very least…

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Decent  graphics and sounds.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Quite short and far too linear.
- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.
- Atrocious control scheme.
- Highly overpriced.

This game is NOT an RPG. It is linear, has no level up or upgrade system, no inventory system, nothing. Instead, you get some random scrolls or swords on the ground that upgrade your basic attack or give you new spells. The controls are awkward as heck, you have to permanently hold down the right mouse button if you want to turn your main character. You cannot use the first mouse button to attack, instead, it is used to interact with stuff and rotate the camera around the character.

This game lasts for about three hours, and it has ZERO replayability. Nothing's randomized, everything is exactly the same each time. This means you're paying $3.33 every hour just to play this game.

By the way, 20 hours is the amount of time it took me to get every card from this game, I didn't play that much at all.

Não me levem a mal, eu gostaria de dizer mais coisas boas de Spellbind, ainda mais por achar que deve ser o primeiro jogo de um time de desenvolvimento muito pequeno e/ou familiar. Sendo assim, primeiro tenho que elogiar partes da trilha sonora (quando há), a construção do mapa de jogo e as diferentes formas de puzzles encontradas. Os puzzles seriam melhores caso não se arrastassem tanto. 

De pontos negativos, temos vários fatores. Muito backtracking em cenários mal acabados ou vazios, movimentação e animação lenta, pouca variedade de inimigos, nenhum sistema de progressão de personagem, efeitos sonoros repetitivos e incômodos (risada do Zé Caveirinha) e principalmente, falta de história ou contexto. Se você não ler a sinopse do jogo na loja Steam, você não saberá do que se trata. Mas caso você venha a ler a sinopse, você ainda não saberá muito dos personagens ou do enredo.

Só resta desejar que esses desenvolvedores consigam se aprimorar num futuro game, aproveitando o público consumidor vai atrás das cartas de ""Spellbind"".",1452640500,1452640500,False,4,0,0.575596809387207031,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Then there's the map of the castle, which based on the intro for the game your character should know because its their castle yet you have no idea what rooms are where until you explore it (which doesn't make sense). Enemies can cast spells at you while going up the stairs, but when you're in first person mode (or any mode for that matter) you cannot fire a spell upwards or downwards (I say the enemies are cheating). I know there is a toggle target key but I feel this game would play better on a game pad if instead of the left/right strafting they turned instead and something like shoulder buttons on the game pad would work better. I'm going to continue trying to play the game and at least beat it, but with how things are going I can only play in short sessions before I get frustrated.

The biggest knock on this game in my opinion is that the combat feels way too slow and that makes the game feel sluggish and unexciting.  Your character looks like crap when he runs (like he has a corncob in his butt).  Other smaller knocks would be the inability to smash wooden crates and barrels in the dungeons, no inventory, no gold to acquire, and no skills that you can level up or adjust to your liking.  All of these would go a long ways to improving the gameplay experience, but to be fair these are also things that would likely increase the price.

The game is not horrible, but not much above average.. I would recommend waiting for a nice sale price for most people.  About 2.5 to 3 hours of gameplay is probably the time needed to defeat the game, and worse yet.. the game is not going to have any replayability at all as it would be exactly the same every time.

My 'very lenient' score is a 6.5 out of 10 but my recommendation is waiting for a sale on this, even for RPG fans like myself.",1426610143,1426621939,True,37,8,0.34271550178527832,8,True,False,False,False,,,
