[b]Disclaimer: I have finished the EX Turbo version on the casual and veteran difficulties, and went through a single level (not beaten) in hardcore hell difficulty to measure stuff. As for the original game, I have finished it on normal mode.[/b]
Super Galaxy Squadron is a shmup game published by the very unlikely fellows at New Blood Interactive. And I mean it in a good way, as New Blood is not widely known as a publisher that releases shmups and you would think them releasing one would be an out of season April Fools joke.
One thing that most people often fail to mention is that by buying this game, you get two games: ""Super Galaxy Squadron"" which is the original game, and ""Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo"" which is the remake. You can select either of the games upon startup, and I'm going to look at both of them.

[h2]The Original[/h2]
This is the very first version of the game, released in 2015.  It gives you the option to try an endless experience, or play through the normal arcade experience on two difficulty modes: Normal mode which gives you an admittedly generous health system to work with, allowing you to heal using health pickups and also by grazing enemy bullets, and Hardcore mode which is literally the 1 hit death mode, where 1 mistake throws you back to the beginning of the level.
The initial impressions of the game are quite positive. The controls are responsive, the audiovisual presentation is solid, the explosions are punchy and feel good, there are quite a lot of playable ships to choose...  But the game gets repetitive and dull after a while, because of how the gameplay feels as a whole.

The thing is, the difficulty scales in an uneven manner throughout the game, due to enemy patterns not having a cohesive design and planning to them and feeling like they just appear randomly to make the game easier or harder. If you have played a decent number of shmups, you won't have much trouble disposing of normal enemy waves on any difficulty setting. However, there are times that the game suddenly increases the difficulty by bringing in multiple enemies that have complex bullet patterns, then goes back to its normal behavior after you dispose of them.
And this applies to the bosses as well. Bosses always have a significant difficulty increase compared to the enemies that came before them. They hit very hard as not only their bullet patterns are much faster and arrive in larger numbers compared to normal enemies, but also the brief invulnerability frames sometimes cannot keep you safe from the barrage of bullets, allowing you to get hit multiple times in advance. 

Another aspect of the gameplay that I absolutely hate in shmup games (and even talked about it in my Drainus review), is the weapons powering down after getting hit. When hit by enemy projectiles, your primary and secondary weapons lose some of their collected level ups, with them appearing in the level as floating items, giving you a chance to collect them and get your firepower back. There are two problems with this.
First, the powerups usually cannot be collected as either the barrage of incoming bullets prevents you from doing so, or you'll find them getting thrown towards the enemies/bosses. Second, you can lose up to 3 level ups on each hit, meaning you can lose a whole lot of them if you are not careful or have trouble reading the playing area with how much shit is getting thrown around. This is such a harsh punishment for lesser experienced players and casuals in my opinion as it lengthens the already punishing bosses.

Then we have the issue of the game suddenly losing its charm at half-way point. After Stage 3, you have seen everything the game has to offer. From this point onwards, no new enemy will be introduced (aside from the bosses) and the music for levels 4 and 5 will be repeats from levels 1 and 2 respectively. This makes for repetitiveness and dullness, soon to be replaced with misery as you approach the final boss.
Final Weapon is probably one of the most infuriating final bosses I had to face in a shmup game. This boss, contrary to all of the other bosses in the game, does not have any HP bar; so you'll never know how close you were to victory. The visual clutter shows its worst form in this boss fight as well, which forced me to stop following the boss around and divert my focus to a small area at the bottom of the screen and try to survive the encounter. Overall, it's not a fun boss to end the game with.

As I ended my 1cc playthrough in normal mode, the game managed to give me one final ""fuck you"" alongside one mini heart attack in the form of a fatal error. Thanks, I guess.
Now, it's time to get to the remake. Oh, and not the EX version as it's unavailable right now and therefore I know nothing about it. We're going straight to EX Turbo.

[h2]EX Turbo Super Ultra Championship Arcade Edition +R: Type [nu-bld] & Knuckles[/h2]
Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo is the remake of the original game in a new Game Maker engine version which enhances a lot of stuff and adds a whole bunch of new features.
As obvious from the screenshots on the store page, the game has gotten a major overhaul in the presentation department. Graphically, the game looks much more high quality and cleaner. The redesigned user interface now makes use of the sides of the screen (which are completely empty in the original) and transfers all of the necessary information there in an easily identifiable manner. It even reacts to specific gameplay situations, providing visual cues whenever the overdrive mode gets activated or if the health is critically low, which is a much welcome addition for the player. The game now also shows each ship's attack style as well, which was a very good decision from the developers to make. Although it doesn't give you any visual information about their hyper attacks.
Storytelling has also been revamped. All story intermissions from the original game are now replaced with fully voice acted and animated cutscenes that have really good quality. Although there are no subtitles available. There are a bunch of gameplay additions as well. EX Turbo adds new difficulty options, a new boss rush mode, increases the score multiplier cap from 5 to 10, adds the new Overdrive and Focus (bullet time) abilities, adds a new boss (Harrier Ray), allows for ship switching at the beginning of every level, and nerfs the final boss to make it more tolerable while also giving them a HP bar.

Despite all these changes however, the core gameplay remains largely untouched. Enemy patterns still feel aimless, the difficulty spikes up and down occasionally in the manner explained before, there's no new music tracks or enemies, and the game still misses some crucial settings such as key rebinding. The only significant changes are the modifications to the final boss that make it somewhat more tolerable, and the addition of focus ability which gives you the power to slow down the bullets and dodge more efficiently.
But this ability is not without issues either. Upon using the new focus ability, the game turns into a jittery mess, because the game slows the frame rate down as well. The moment you press the focus button, the game goes from smooth 60 fps to jittery 30 fps, instead of just slowing down the gameplay speed.

[h2]TL;DR[/h2]
Definitely not for everyone, and especially hardcore players, as the gameplay doesn't have much to write home about and feels very repetitive after a while. There are better alternatives to choose from.",1712281493,1712281628,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

- No waifus.

- Music is way too loud compared to voice acting, & they don't have separate volume sliders.

- I cant see any reason why I wouldn't have the fire button held down all the time. That being the case,
it probably shouldn't require a button press, & just fire on it's own without input. That would save me having to use third party software to save myself from thumb cramp.

- The story could be interpreted as implying that human supremacy is somehow a bad thing.

- Has the same 'Strong angry brown woman with side-shave' that every game has to have now. I wouldn't mind, but when the same character is in literally everything, it's starts to get irritating. They certainly don't get any points for originality or thinking outside the box.

- Total Grade 6/10
- If you are new to shmups, this can be a serviceable start (more dumb fun than anything, it won't last long in your shmup journey), but I still don't generally recommend it (I give better options at the bottom).
- Not recommended to anyone who has played practically any other shmups.
- If you want to support New Blood, I'd recommend picking up the other titles first.

Pros:
- The game has good game feel. Explosions are punchy, score items are large and dumb, ship attacks are extravagant.
- Bullet patterns are fine for beginners, more on the side of traditional shmup attacks with different leading and spread volleys combos.
- Good selection of modes, and multiple difficulties to spend time improving at.
- (Too) Many pilots. Not a lot of balance but there is a type for everyone.

Cons:
- The stages are terrible. The balance between enemies and bosses is non-existent. You'll die from boredom before you die from hits during the leadups to the bosses. Consequently,
- Bosses are not tuned properly. Most of the boss fights aren't memorable, and several of them have atleast one wave of highly condensed purple ring projectiles that move exceptionally fast. This is guaranteed to be where you take most of your hits. Generally, you''ll go from tons of fodder enemies that exist long enough to shoot like 6 slow moving projectiles at you to a boss that fires a static mesh of bullets at an incredibly fast speed (with even faster leading shots mixed in as well). 
- Even after the repass, the TFB is still badly designed, which hasd kinda confirmed for me that this game has had its difficulty built around the slow motion technique (which looks laughably bad in action). Also, the fact that this update came out right at the same time as a steam sale dedicated to shmups makes me think in hindsight it was quickly pushed out to capitalize on new sales. The balancing was focused on lowering the health and lessening the bullets a little bit for each wave, but the real problem is that the TFB is a trash fight with bull**** patterns that aren't fun to learn. 
- The biggest negative? The game has had repass after repass, been updated several times now - and it is still unfun to play. There is no soul to any of the patterns, the music is low-effort outside of like the final 2 songs (God the standard boss tune sounds like some demented hoe-down music whenever it starts), level difficulty doesn't ever match up with boss difficulty, and I feel no interest in attempting a true 1cc now that I've actually played shmups made from people who care about the genre.

TLDR - Before you consider buying this game, please look at 

Mushihimesama
Gunvein
Demonizer
JamesTown+
Blue Revolver
ZeroRanger
Crimzon Clover


Generally any one of those titles are on sale often, and any of them would be a more worthwhile shmup over this, for new or old players.

Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up with 16-bit aesthetic and a be aggressive or welcome the bullet hell simple game play I greatly enjoy.

The controls for Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo are right in that sweet spot for me.  As I prefer a simpler STG setup.  You have your primary fire that can be powered up via pick-ups along with a secondary weapon that fires along with the primary weapon with its own power up meter and different pick ups.  From there, the player as a Focus, which slows the game down allowing for some tricky micro-dodging.  As well as a Hyper attack.  Which pretty much everything based on the selected pilot/ship.

And Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo features a large roster of pilots/ships to pick from.  Each with their own power, armor and speed.  In addition to their own primary, secondary and hyper attacks.  Me, I prefer a powerful slower ship and liked the cut of the Amber pilot/ship's gib.  This pilot primary weapon is a wide forward shot with a lighter spread shot with a sort of short-ranged forward depth charge type secondary attack with really fed by aggressive, point-blank as much as possible play style.  Even Amber's hyper was decent being a defensive forward shield that lasted for a few seconds, which both can get me out trapped corner or point-blank a boss with all weapons.

The game play rewards aggressive play.  I found myself sticking to the upper half of the screen during more of the non-boss fights.  However, the game also features enemies that come in from the sides to prevent me from residing at the top less I get attacked from behind.  

The speed at which game plays is just about perfect.  Not overly fast as to make it tough to dodge, but also not so slow (without using the Focus slow-down ability) allow a player to easily micro-dodge bullet patterns.  Even though I don't think the slow-down mechanic has changed, I found myself actually making better use of it after these major patches. Still not so often as to drain the meter, but just enough to weave through something I really shouldn't at full speed.

The graphics are exactly the kind I like in my shoot 'em ups.  That colorful 90's video game style.  Though, I will admit the enemy bullet coloration could be a tad better at times.  But even that, really wasn't a hindrance, so much as it was just getting used to it.  The music and sound is decent.  Nothing I'm rushing out to get the OST, but also nothing I'm going to mute.  

Now for the big update that completely turned me around on this game.  Previously, the final boss was a major difficult spike.  Not impossible by any means, but the change in difficult was very stark.  Up until the final boss, I'd say over all Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo was on the easier side of STGs.  Not a pushover by any means, but seasoned shmup player could easily make it to the end in a couple of hours regardless of which ship/pilot they ultimately selected.  

But the final boss before the patch ramped-up the challenge that I might have beaten with the best pilot (i.e. the one that did it the fastest), with maxed out primary/secondary weapons and a full Hyper meter.  Goodness knows I came really close with Amber and a drained Hyper meter.  The game has save checkpoints that resets the player if they fail.  But the lack of a health bar and greatly increased bullet speed made my attempts a lot more about luck and my reflexes holding out long enough to whittle the boss down.  I'm sure I got close a few times, but never did beat the game in that state.  And I didn't really want to try, as the spike just left a bad taste in mouth and really ruined the entire experience before it.  Now the boss is still tough, but it is just toned down enough that it feels more inline with the casual or veteran difficulty of the rest of the game.  I'm sure it's still a beast on the harder difficulties than that for the player really seeking a test of skills.

When I bought this game, it really didn't seem like the developer was going to fix that.  Despite their insistence they would in the discussion here on Steam.  But they were true to their word.  Hence, I am completely rewriting my review from a negative to a positive.    Because even before the patch, the game was a lot of fun.  It was just ruined with a extra-hard turd boss at the end that felt completely out place with the rest of the game's challenge.  Now that it's been fixed, I highly recommend Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo.  Particularly to newer shmup players as this game still has a bite to it, but it won't kick you between the legs at every opportunity.",1689270298,1696912291,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I have some gripes about the last boss, which I'll get in to.  But anyway, let the bullet points roll.

Pros
- AMAZING music.
- 17 pilots/ships, so tons of variety.
- Some real unique and interesting mechanics for some of the ships.
- Has a slomo meter to make things a tad easier for newcomers or less skilled players (the meter still needs to be slowly built-up, so you cannot just spam it).
- A decent story.  It's no Sine Mora, but what shmup - or any game - is?
- Besides the slomo, I'd say it's still fairly accessible.  It's not QUITE at true bullet hell level (remember kids, something like Cuphead is NOT a bullet hell.  ""Bullet hell"" is so misused these days, RIP genre names), but is faster and more saturated than say the 1940 series or Jamestown.

Cons
- No invincible frames after hit can cause for some big cascading damage on you in later stages/bosses.  Especially if you're hunting down your lost upgrades from getting hit.
- Despite the amazing variety of ships, not all are balanced equally.
- Last boss is...something.  YMMV depending on your pilot/ship.  I decided to start over my entire save w/ a different ship just to beat the last boss.  However, may be possible to beat w/ any ship w/ certain cheese.  Last boss I'd say IS 100% a bullet hell boss, tho.  But it incentivizes you to play a certain way that seems a bit counter-intuitive.
- Endless Mode (and maybe Boss Rush?) does not save your points records history.  I know I got 25,000,000 pts on Endless once.  But...just no way to show or prove it.

Neutral
- I am not sure if no invinc frames is genre standard or not.  I want to say it sticks out to me because I'm used to invinc frames?  Either way, no invinc frames, fwiw.  The snowballing damage is still a con, though, since it seems almost inevitable at times.

Anyway, a solid shmup/bullet hell w/ some real interesting mechanics and great music.  I'm okay at shmups and beat this in less than 6 hrs total, which includes 2 runs to last boss and probably ~2 hrs doing Endless Mode w/ all ships.

Há três modos de jogo: arcade, endless e boss rush. Durante um bom tempo tentei terminar o game no modo arcade na dificuldade hardcore, mas não obtive sucesso, então joguei na dificuldade normal, ainda assim a tarefa foi complicada.

A diferença entre as dificuldades é que no normal há itens de reposição de energia e checkpoint. Para quem for se aventurar a terminar sem continue, o chekpoint é inútil, a não ser para treinar o estágio ou chefe onde você morreu. Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo trabalha com barra de energia e não há vidas extras.

Em Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo sua nave possui tiro rápido, não sei se todas as naves possuem o ataque carregado, para isso basta não atirar e depois que um círculo ao redor de sua nave for completado, ao apertar o botão de tiro, o ataque é disparado. 

Há uma movimentação lenta temporária, chamada Focus, onde tudo que há na tela fica em câmera lenta e permite que o jogador se movimente com maior precisão para desviar dos disparos inimigos, no hud ela é representada por uma barra mais fina de cor amarelada ao lado da barra Hyper.

Existe um ataque especial chamado Hyper, cada nave possui um movimento próprio. Para abastecer o Hyper e o Focus, basta coletar os itens azuis que são liberados pelos inimigos destruídos. Esses itens são atraídos para sua nave automaticamente a curta distância.

Sobre as naves, eu optei por jogar com a Black, ela possui uma excelente arma secundária. As armas primárias e secundárias de todas as naves podem ser evoluídas até o quinto nível. O Hyper de Black funciona como escudo e também maximiza seus ataques. 

Toda vez que você toma dano, além da perda de energia, você pode perder poder de fogo das armas primárias e secundárias. Após o dano, durante certo período, os itens ficam flutuando na tela, sendo assim é possível você recuperar o poder de fogo, com sorte, totalmente.

Sobre a pontuação, o game trabalha com sistema de combo que maximiza sua pontuação, pelo que entendi o ideal é você jogar mais na ofensiva, destruindo seus inimigos o mais perto possível, e tentar manter o multiplicador alto. Além disto, há outras bonificações no jogo, como itens secretos que podem ser obtidos ao posicionar sua nave sobre os círculos semitransparentes até fazer o item aparecer.

Graficamente Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo é muito bem feito, não encontrei defeito algum, gostei do design das naves, inimigos, hud, a escolha da paleta de cores, uma arte pixelada de excelente bom gosto.

Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo possui uma trilha sonora muito cativante, inclusive há uma música cantada. Há dublagem nas cutscenes entre os estágios e os efeitos sonoros são bem decentes.

Encontrei pequenos e poucos problemas na parte sonora, é possível ouvir o som do seu tiro enquanto a fase não começa e quando se morre o alarme não para de tocar até o jogo recomeçar do check point.

Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo só parece curto, além de tentar fechar sem continue, há uma conquista que pra mim foi bem complicada de obter, Mariner, foram inúmeras tentativas até consegui-la. 

Em relação ao jogo em si, o último chefe possui ataques complicados para desviar, eu fiquei com uma baita dor na região da nuca após finalizar o game devido a enorme tensão. 

Eu achei Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo muito divertido, é bonito, possui uma boa trilha sonora e um desafio cativante que obriga o jogador testar todas as naves para encontrar a que melhor se adapte ao seu estilo. Uma vez escolhida a nave, é hora de traçar estratégias para a conclusão dos desafios que não são nada fáceis.",1673993647,1673993647,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,True,,,

After 3-4 hrs, I finally got the max bonus on the boss. You will likely need to cap your Max Frames to 20 FPS in the Nvidia Settings b/c for 50 secs you can gnarly miss a shot. I almost did it uncapped but gave up after 2hrs. More details in the Discussion Pages. I'll post up a vid.

Concerning final boss complaints, I have to wonder how one would nerf the final boss on Normal Mode. I've been playing a decent amount of shooters lately, and I have to say that this Final Boss is the easiest of the lot. In fact, I can not think of any easier final boss that I have played on a shooter game going back to the NES. Like I usually need a handful of bombs, full lives, a pack of smokes, a hand grenade, and maybe a continue or three to beat most final shmup bosses. This guy. He hit me 2 times. I used some prism special pilot. Most of the pattern is sitting at the middle'ish part of the screen and when a targeted bullet comes your way then you do a light tap into the next column of the patterned bullets, and you just keep doing that tap if need be until the 75% edge of the screen, then slo-mo back to center and repeat, or if the wave changes directions then just tap back from where you came.

Everything seemed escape-able. And I didn't have to make much use of the slowdown mechanic. Using the slow down makes this game quite the cakewalk, but also, fun so I used it a bit. Bullets are easy to see. Bullets are large. Bullets are fairly slow. Patterns are cliche. For ppl complaining about the final boss, this is unfortunately a case where a person will need to put in some work in this genre to attain Victory. Other shooters & their bosses that could help are Danmaku Unlimited 3, RefRain, Steredeen. All those shooters' bosses have very symmetrical patterns. They're not super easy, but mix it up a bit, work on those patterns for a few hours, come back here, and you will have a good chance at trouncing this boss, too.

I wish I would have put the game in Hardcore mode my first run through b/c I might have 1CC'd as I think I only got hit like 6 times total for a normal casual playthru, maybe it was 5 times lol. All I know is that this is way easier than the shmups I have picked up lately, notably old school Raiden games & Danmaku Unlimited 3. 

Also, thanks for doing voice acting on this thing. I am a sucker for voice acting, and I can appreciate the little extra time put into this shmup by adding some story. For two-fifty, this game is a steal!

I really liked the game and the inclusion of the classic version was wonderful!
The game is beginner friendly (mostly) and has a lot of neat ships, fully voice acted cut-scenes and amazing music. For the most part it is fine in terms of gameplay and difficulty UNTIL the final boss.
While there are so many great aspects and some meh or mediocre ones the thing that really sticks out is the Final Weapon in the turbo version.
This boss is absolute BS in every sense and completely unfair compared to the rest of the game AND compared to the classic version. Too many projectiles, not enough space to dodge them, boss is a bullet sponge, too much damage, etc. I spent more time on the final boss than getting to the final boss.

This problem was not present on the Classic version of the game as there was more room to dodge and sprites were smaller.
I really wish there was a a meh option on steam somewhere between recommended and not recommended, because I still think this is a good game when on sale AND you get the classic which feels more balanced overall.

Get it on sale for the classic, and get ready to spend 20 minutes hoping the RNG throws you some health.

*some spoilers for the game by the way*
right now ive played on hell difficulty for ex turbo (normal mode though) even though it was my first time playing, gonna check out classic later and update this review as my opinions change and/or i have something more to add

first off, with the positives, this game finally let me live out my dreams of playing as marisa with homing lasers, god bless teal
i like the fast pace, and dodging the fast as hell bullets gives a sense of thrill when you manage to survive
the boss designs look cool
i didnt really give that much a thought on the story though, i skipped all of the cutscenes and got straight to the gameplay

now for a few gripes i have with the game... the difficulty, atleast on hell mode, is weird. most of the game is actually pretty easy even on hell mode, which is supposed to be the hardest, and the only times i died early on were because i was still getting used to the controls
i forgot the name of the final boss, was it final weapon or machine? i dunno, but it was a SERIOUS difficulty spike to be honest. most of the game is easy then it hits you with a ton of incredibly fast bullets, as if expecting you have focus on the entire time... the only way i really got past it was cheesing the second phase (which is the hardest) by just staying above it and destroying its minions, hoping i get enough hp and upgrades to then deal a decent amount of damage then going back up again
i would also like a normal lives system rather than the only options being checkpoints or none at all, though that is just my opinion

despite my gripes it is still pretty fun and i would recommend it, and it is very cheap as well",1666508396,1666508396,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,True,,,

First and foremost I want to say that they should have used the song from the credit in their trailer to sell the game. Now for 2 euros you get a basic SHMUP with 1 attack and one special but also a huge 17 different ships roster to get your ROI. The gameplay is much about avoiding bullets patterns and it is very well done on that aspect there are easy to see and memorize and I can distinguish easily what is to be avoided and what is to be caught, the bullets are big and their speed is not too fast, most bullets are about the speed of your ship and there are no suprise bullet hitting you from nowhere. Also, there is a gauge that recharges itself to slow down the game when I am in difficulty and another one to go into overdrive mode when I am having a really good time on the combo system. It is relatively easy for a shmup and it is welcome if you ask me, a casual shmuper,  I completed the game on normal difficulty and without the hardcore mode on (each difficulty has a hardcore mode) in a little less than an hour with a few continues yes but much less continues than it would taken me with any other shmup I have played.

The main problem, that other reviews have already pointed out, is the poor level design. It's just the same enemies with the same attack patterns for all 6 levels. The backgrounds are also really boring and don't interact with the gameplay at all. 

Bosses are also boring, and only have a couple of attack patterns. Playing on veteran mode the game felt super easy, until you get to the last boss. The last boss just sucks, it brings the difficulty from 0 to 1000, and it's attack patterns aren't even fun, they just feel cheap and dodging them basically forces you to use the slow down ability (which I didn't use at all up to the final boss). 

I also really didn't like the forced chiptunes soundtrack. It was way too heavy, didn't fit the levels, and sounded too much like a  poor imitation of the band Anamanaguchi 

On the plus side, the production values are top notch. The pixel graphics are great, the sound effects and punchy and satisfying, and the UI looks retro but functional. Controls are super tight, and felt on par with classic Japanese shmups.

So i played veteran. I am not really new to shmups, so the 6 stages were actually not really difficult at all.... and then came the Final Weapon. Its an unfair joke. An absolutely insane - totally unbalanced bossfight compared to the whole game. 

So i came to the game's forums, if others felt the same - turned out, the reviews and forum posts are full of that complaint - then i saw the developers ""trolling"" responses to those totally valid criticisms - even after years he is just joking around with that ""we will fix this hahahaa"" attitude - that never happened.

A good shmup is the one, where the difficulty is consistent. It can - and should - feature difficult bossfights, but the stages should prepare you for that, and there should be some fairness, and balance in the game. (or keep that kind of unreal insanity for Hell difficulty or something).

The attitude of the dev on the forums is my only reason, that i will refund this game, becouse its clear , there is no intention here to fix an unbalanced gameplay element. 

They complaining here since years. Its 2022. Fix will never come. Enjoy only casual guys, or waste half of your life on ""normal"" difficulty to end this.

The variety in playable ships is great, and they all have unique mechanics that change the way they play, so definitely try all of them out to find your favorite. The hyper attack mechanic is a bit simple but a nice inclusion, and the focus/slowdown ability is a great way to make the massive amounts of bullets feel manageable in later stages. The soundtrack is INCREDIBLE, especially the credits theme (thanks for adding lyrics to it, very cool), and most of the boss fights are really engaging and well designed.

But the issues come in some of the difficulty balancing, stage variety, and the overall amount of content. The final boss is a HUGE difficulty spike, and while I had a somewhat fun time figuring out how to beat it, it definitely needs some rebalancing. The levels feel really bland, and there's no clear patterns to when enemies show up, so it just feels like they show up randomly, which makes all the levels feel really similar to each other. Lastly, once you beat arcade mode, that's most of the game's content already finished. The achievements are nice but don't add much replay value, and while messing around with all the ships in endless mode is fun for a little while, that also stops feeling satisfying.

Overall, SGS isn't a bad game, but its definitely very ""arcade style"" as opposed to most PC/Console shmups that have a bit more structure and extra content to them.

The difficulty spike is ridiculous, because the final boss can spam bullet swarm. The slo-mo feature is really useful here because of this alone.This might was result of trying to please a wider audience (newcomers like me and veterans), that they forgot to balance the last part.

I really love this game, it's hard, but I have beaten it like 3 times. I feel satisfied playing it.
All ships have their own quirks, controls are perfect (on controller), AND THE MUSIC IS A BANGER, INCLUDING THE SINGER. I definitely gonna buy the soundtrack.

One of the best and most addictive shmups I've played on Steam. Can be played ""fast and loose"", as they say. The level of control you have over your ship is insane. Very small hitbox. Taking damage never feels cheap. It's like: ""yup flew right into that one, I deserved that""  - Just like a good shmup should be. 

Large variety of ships to choose from, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Some sacrifice power for speed and vice versa. Some are balanced.

Lack of enemy and bullet pattern
Lack of different/variation bullet colors scheme pattern according to the shooting pattern as in it feels that the colors scheme was chosen randomly. A color or shape should be associated with an enemy so we know what is coming and in what direction.
Boss are meh Idk why... it lacks somethings. There is a voice over but enemies don't talk.
Lacks flow
The combo system could be better. Combo counter should not drop if we keep hitting an ennemy (for big one).
Flow wise (again) we should be able to keep the combo until the boss fight and keep it to score bigger. 
It would challenge best player to keep a continous x9.9 combo without hitting the OP overdrive.

-난이도

필드는 너무 쉽고 보스전은 너무 어렵네. 특히 마지막 스테이지 보스와 진보스가 비정상적으로 어려워서 좀 골때림. 
근데 필드가 짧은 것도 아니고 엄청 김. 매 스테이지마다 거의 3~4분을 감

그런데 프랙티스 기능이 있는것도 아님 아ㅋㅋㅋ

그래서 맨날 필드전 꾸벅꾸벅 졸면서 보스전 언제오냐 하염없이 기다리고, 그렇게 30분 지루한걸 꾸역꾸역 참아서 한번 보스전 연습하고 그걸 깰때까지 반복ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

진짜 딱 3트인가 4트밖에 안했는데도 진짜 지루해서 미쳐버리는 줄 알았다


처음부터 헬난이도 하드코어로 안하고 헬난이도 노말로 체크포인트를 박아서 보스전을 따로 연습할 수 있다고 치면 또 모르겠다. 애초에 노말은 손도 안대서.


-가시성
그래픽은 확실히 화려하다. 근데 화려한 만큼 가시성이 박살났다.
탄이 제대로 안보여 ㅅㅂ 그래픽이 화려하면 뭐해 탄이 제대로 안보이는데
진짜 탄은 안보이고 그래픽은 진짜 개쓸데없이 화려해서 눈만 존나 아픔. 근데 그걸 30분 내내? ㅋㅋ......


그나마 필드전 난이도가 너무너무 쉬워서 대충대충해도 피하는데 문제가 없어서 망정이지, 보스전에서도 이랬으면 쌍욕나왔을 것 같다.




-체력 시스템

게다가 미스날 때 있는 무적 딜레이가 거의 없고, 그렇다고 해서 피탄 당했을 때 주변 탄막 소거 같은 것도 없음. 진짜 재수없으면 순식간에 연속 3~4미스로 게임이 터져버릴 수 잇음. 근데 그렇다고 봄이 있는 것도 아님.
1미스면 그러려니 하겠는데 연속 2미스 이상나면 좀 기분이 안좋음


-기체
기체 종류는 많은데, 기체 성능과 하늘과 땅차이임

어떤 기체는 하이퍼 샷이 그냥 공격력 찔끔 강화되는건데, 어떤 기체는 기체 앞 전방위 탄 소거에 공격력 강화임. 거의 유사 봄 수준
근데 전방위 탄 소거 기체가 그렇지 않는 기체보다 공격력이 부족하다던가 그런 것도 없음. 심지어 내구도도 엄청 높다

이게 진짜 같은 기체라고 만들어 놓은거냐?

각 기체마다 성능 차이는 있을 수 있다고는 생각하는데, 이겜은 너무 극심함.




그냥 할인하는 기념 겸사겸사 해서 망정이지, 아니였으면 안했을 듯

솔직히 말해서 도트 그래픽만 괜찮고 나머지는 다 별로

The music is grating and sounds the same it just blurs together

There are only 6 stages

Game is about an hour long, + the time it takes for you to beat the final boss

The final boss is a huge difficulty spike, especially because i was switching ships every stage to test what they feel like, and the one i was using when the game autosaved before the final boss was the donut. It creates a big pink and magenta cloud of bullets in front of itself, which happens to be the exact colours the projectiles the final boss shoots. Meaning, I COULD NOT SEE THE BOSS' BULLETS, BECAUSE OF MY OWN BULLETS! What asinine design is that?

Its a pretty game but it doesnt understand what visual clarity is, for the entirety of the game, all the effects explosions and bullets just blended in together, the only reason it wasnt an issue before the final boss is because the rest of the game is peashit easy even on veteran. 

All the ships play the same. They have different stats attacks and abilities, but in reality its completely mindless and just shoot at whatever moves. 

If you complete the game you get a whole of ZERO [0] achievements, because all of them are locked behind the 0.1% perfect everything rating

There's no discernible pattern or difference between the waves of enemies, their attacks, and their patterns. It feels just random.

The threat is so low on Veteran that I sometimes was forgetting to press the shot button, as I was - literally - dozing off.

I don't find this one to be very competently made. It works. It isn't buggy. It looks like an STG, but it's design feels stunted.

Every ship plays the same and every level tediously overstays it's welcome. There's not much in the way of themes or unique pressure until quite literally the final few seconds of the final level. All enemies are various flying machines cheaply popping in at the top of the screen that slooowly move down and slooowly fire their generic, aimless volleys of bullets. They're poorly contextualized so nothing really seems to serve much of a purpose other than to be shot at. Which is a problem when you're trying to throw DoDonPachi-esque scoring mechanics like combo chains and meter building. In fact, one of the mechanics, overdrive, didn't even happen for me until the literal last level where I thought it was just the game trying to force in a cool climactic moment. 

Enemies don't pop in with any concise, deliberate formations you can route for optimized scoring or that put you in pressure situations...or just look cool. They just appear one by one or in random configurations like someone flicked water droplets onto paper. There isn't any synergy to their patterns like a more elite title such as Ketsui or Natsuki Chronicles. 

Hyper isn't even what that name entails. It's just a linear thinking bomb to destroy things in the rare moments you somehow find yourself in a pinch. It's not an interesting special mode that needs to be worked for to use as often as it's earned. It doesn't make enemies more aggressive in exchange for higher score. It doesn't extend your combo multiplier before decay for strategic decision making. It's not even really necessary as a bomb because the game, at it's ""hardest"" never needs it and it doesn't screen clear anyway. You throw it, kill things somewhat faster, and that's the extent of it. It compliments nothing.

Bosses almost have more to them than the stages. Their patterns come out faster and they do have secondary patterns that accentuate the primary fire to move you about the screen. But they're all really easy and don't get much harder each stage. One of them just stays put in the center top of the screen. 

It's an overall dull experience with no focus, cluttered visuals, and very very grating music, something the genre usually excels at. There's better STG's on Steam. Blue Revolver, Danmaku Unlimited 3, and DoDonPachi Resurrection far exceed what this offers.",1624675085,1626574883,False,4,0,0.563404262065887451,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Voiced cutscenes and a wide variety of playable ships

Each ship has its own style and pilot lore, so it's clear that in design, sound, and writing this was a labor of love...

But the enemies eventually get even more repetitive than one would expect for this genre of game.

The bosses are mostly fine until you get to the very last one, and then the ""hell"" part of this genre applies.  With a game like Arknights there is a decent amount of player feedback and related strategies that have been set up.  For this game...  The forums complain about this last boss being imbalanced but the developers seem way too busy to address it.  Hopefully they haven't given up yet.

The music has that cool chiptune style...  But unlike a lot of games there are only a handful of really memorable tunes.  Most video games have amazing music these days, but it's also true that this game has been out for several years now so it might be unfair to critique the music's ""memorability"" when the final boss' balancing and the repetitive enemies and, the one thing that bothers me most:

This game is called ""Super Galaxy Squadron,"" but usually it's throwing one ship out there to face the entire enemy fleet all by itself.  Oh sure you can swap out the ship for another one at the very beginning of the stage, but that still applies.  I get how in Touhou and other games you don't get to swap, but with this many playable characters with the same plot for each...  This game should call itself ""Super Galaxy Fighter"" because I'm not seeing any wing or squadron mates anywhere near me in single player.

The game brings a lot of awesome arcade action.......  But I'd be lying if I said I'd be giving it a recommended rating without a ton of caveats

就像金剛戰士(power rangers)有紅色戰士 黃色戰士....等顏色戰隊
遊戲也以17種顏色用來標註
總共17台都配有駕駛員大頭照的機體
這種規格還沒玩就先80分起跳惹


17台機體除了用攻 防 速三個參數 
外加攻擊方式跟各別的必殺技
來作出區別
系統上沒有無敵爆彈而是以子彈時間來取代

個人認為這遊戲實在有點難度
主要建立在BOSS刁鑽的彈幕

以及沒有無敵爆彈的設計
讓玩家真的沒啥僥倖的空間
只能硬著頭皮接招
尤其最終BOSS瞬間爆升的難度
玩到差點崩潰
但神奇的是
這遊戲的彈幕有種奇妙的吸引力

值得一提的遊戲其實是包含兩個:

Those leave a good initial impression, but after playing through several stages it quickly becomes evident there's not much to the game. 

Stages are extremely long and dull, consisting of an endless stream of cannon fodder enemies that seem to enter in the same patterns. I initially thought playing through these stages that they were procedurally generated due to the repetition, but they are crafted this way. You can spend a huge amount of time in your first blind playthrough just sitting near the top of the screen spawn camping enemies before they can fire a shot. 

Bosses are equally dull affairs, with extreme amounts of health, yet little variation in attack patterns. Those few attack patterns they have are also incredibly boring; most bosses use similar attack patterns to the fodder enemies. The vast majority of bullets also travel at a snail's pace, even though the density never gets that high. 

Mechanically it's simple, with a slowdown function that trivialises an already excessively easy game, and a superweapon for each ship that is able to be spammed with abandon. 

It's not a broken game. It doesn't seem to have any bugs and it looks nice enough. It works. It's just so very boring to play. There's so many great alternatives that I can't imagine any scenario where I could recommend this to anyone.

It's ok, but not great. Simple and pretty fun, but compared to some arcade favourites it's lacking. Worth on a sale.

[h1]Review[/h1]
This is a vertical space-shooter with a funny name that just begs for having Reloaded Definitive Edition: The Revenge added at the end. You probably played games like this so I'll just concentrate on some features specific to this one.

- HP - you don't die in one hit, instead you have a health bar and unlimited continues. Each time you are hit, you lose some of your upgrades.
- Hitbox - your hitbox is just a small point on your ship, not the entire thing. It's similar to games like Touhou in that respect, but you can see that hitbox at all times for easier maneuvering around enemy bullets.
- Upgrades - you have primary and secondary weapons, which are fired both at the same time always. When you kill enemies sometimes an upgrade for one of those weapons will appear, which you can collect. Weapons are tied to ship you selected and cannot be changed (unless you change the entire ship, which is possible at the start of the level).
- Slow-motion - as you kill things you will charge up your slow-motion ability. At a press of a button you can enter slo-mo which makes dodging bullets easier, but drains your slow-motion resource as long as you keep the button pressed. Once you exit this mode by releasing the button, there's a short cooldown before you can enter it again.
- Hyper-attack - hyper charges the same way as slow-motion and can be unleashed once fully charged to deal a lot of damage for a few seconds and make your ship invurnelable (sometimes, I don't really know how it works).

This game takes about 20-30 minutes to finish one playthrough, which is comparable with many other arcade-style space shooters. Replayability is mostly in different difficulty levels and ship selection. There's also a boss rush and an endless mode with randomized levels. There's no ship customization save for linear upgrades described above.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ A lot of ships[/b]
[b]+ Feels good[/b]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Underwhelming bosses[/b]
[b]- Difficulty[/b]

More about pros and cons below.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ A lot of ships[/b]
You get 17 ships to choose from, each has different visual effects and sort-of unique firing pattern. Obviously with this many ships you will notice some of them having similar feel, but it's not enough to take away from how fun it's to try all of them out. Some of them have very unique mechanics like having secondary weapons you can manually aim around, or secondaries that are automated drones.

[b]+ Feels good[/b]
Blowing things up is chunky and satisfying, the visuals are great and both music and sound effects are nice. Controls are simple snappy and responsive.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Underwhelming bosses[/b]
I was always a fan of multi-staged bosses with huge sprites that take multiple screens of space. All of the bosses here have different stages, but rarely change appearence and all fit on the top of your screen.

[b]- Difficulty[/b]
For the most part, assuming you are using your slow motion and your hyper in tough situations - the game's difficulty is very balanced. It's not very hard, comparing to other games in the genre, but also isn't easy either. This goes out the window in the last boss fight, who rarely lets you charge your slo-mo and hyper, but has some bullet patterns that are simply too quick to dodge. This is the only boss fight, which requires you to learn the patterns and make your moves by memory, because if you rely on your sight and reaction time - you will get hit. I don't think even Touhou games have this kind of quick bullet pattern that's this hard to dodge by reflexes.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
As stated before - this game is allright, but only allright. It's fun and rewarding in short bursts that it's designed to be played at, but has some unfortunate design choices that make the whole thing a bit less than great.
I'd give Boom-boom Shooty-shooty Reloaded Definitive Edition: The Revenge a

When you wake up in the morning, you see the ceiling. You see your bed. You see the inside of your bedsheets. You see the phone that you paid for with money from a job that you hate. The dimly-lit room stares back at you as you stare out at it -- a spoiled child who never amounted to anything even in college. Even despite the inconveniences of your daily life, you are in many regards spoiled. Yet, you are miserable and you make others miserable.

You didn't have to credit-feed and load state repeatedly, practicing endlessly for 30-50 hours just to get to 2-1 because your appetite for memorizing bee locations is even less than your appetite for bitter vegetables to get to this point. But, you spent middle school doing it anyway in some ill-conceived notion that it would make you a better person or that you would be well-liked for doing something well in a video game that few people knew about and even fewer cared for achievements concerning.

Starting with the good... While this might seem like a low hurdle, the game works properly and is playable, even in full screen.  You may or may not be surprised how many indie games don't manage to clear that little obstacle.

The developer worked very hard to implement a retro theme, but the year is 2017, pixel graphics are long obsolete and need to die.   There's a lot of flaws here.  The display doesn't take full benefit of 16:9 resolution, and before you say ""But it's supposed to look like a 3:4 arcade machine"", you can see why there's a big problem trying to cram one of those onto a 16:9 2160p PC gaming monitor.   Just because you could, doesn't mean you should.    Retro pixel ""art"" is an ugly substitute for talent.  In this case the developer was too invested with the retro look that they didn't consider how background contrast, which was carefully managed in those old shmups, impacts the game.  It's simply too noisy at some points to avoid the bullets because the developer flubbed the graphics.  Resolution is fixed and can't be changed, another minimum requirement that isn't met by this game.

Finally, we have a $14.50 price tag for a vertical shmup that tries to be a ripoff of the original shmups of the 1990s but does a worse job of it.

The game's stronger feature by far is a surprisingly wide variety of playable ships with varying weapons and super attacks, and the ability to switch which one you're using at the start of a new stage. It is also aesthetically pleasing, with quality pixel art, an intense soundtrack and vivid color palette. Also, as a Tyrian 2000 fan and one of the two people mentioned on the store page who'd want a story in a vertical shmup, I appreciate the token effort towards that end in the small cutscenes and pilot bios.

The presentation, sounds, graphics, hype, sprites are great. I love the sounds and the visual feedback. Excellent and clear menus. Input works beautifully with no delays or oddities. The layering of the explosions, medals, ship shots, enemy shots, etc is PERFECT and that is something that most shoot-em-ups get wrong. It's really clear where you need to dodge, and where you need to collect. I like the bullet patterns which are, in my opinion, somewhere in the medium-difficulty range. That could be good, could be bad depending on your skill. I have 1CC'ed DoDonPachi so I find this game a little less challenging or grueling than I'd like.

I'm not very sold on the enemy wave patterns... they feel extremely predictable and simple to dispatch. The bosses are a little too easy (for me). There's too many ships to choose from and many are complete trash, while others are very OP. I guess this could be a good thing for those that want to find their own way to challenge themselves, but I disagree fundamentally with this design decision - all good games are carefully balanced between pros/cons but that's missing here.

I paid around $2 on sale and I feel it was worth that but not much more TBH. If you're just getting into the genre, I feel this game will reward you over multiple plays. I'm not a ""hardcore"" shmupper like some, but pretty darn good when I get serious, and thus I don't think this game will draw me back for multiple replays. It feels just bland enough in the area of enemy waves/bullets that I'm not compelled for that ""one more try"" which should be a feeling that appropriately-tuned games give a player.

It's a good game. If you're a hardcore shmupper take a hard pass. If you've ever 1CC'ed a popular shmup, hard pass. If you've 2CC'ed a popular shmup, hard pass. Casual players, go for it on sale.",1594240344,1594240344,True,1,0,0.504173636436462402,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i]A nice little bullet hell game you would have fun with when more remarkable titles like Crimzon Clover or ZeroRanger are already finished. The main feature is 14-15 different ships, their hyper modes, and amount or armor/lives. In hyper mode some just deal more damage, others come more useful by clearing screen of bullets or shielding your ship. Ability to swap ships between stages in neat too. Killy Teal for the beginning, tanky Black for the ending.

The weak side are the rest of stats with spread and DPS which, with exception of Teal and White ships, don't introduce much difference. The only important one is the armor, but it's poorly balanced and Black is particularly OP
 
Difficulty is mostly forgiving, it took me less than a week to achieve 1cc (hardcore route) on veteran (medium) difficulty, although I was lucky during the battle with the final boss too. And it's the only impressive challenge. Seriously, it's much harder than the rest of the entire game

Conclusion? It's worth your money. May be not for the full price, but definitely for a discount [/i]

Very fun Shmup i recommend it especially at that price.

Looks good, music is great the bullet patterns are good, many many varied ships like 10 or something, Lots of stages 6-7 i think

Few things i don't like is that i play usually pretty high in the screen but a lot of enemies come from the low side of the screen and cheap shot you i will have to adapt to that and play more at the bottom. One run is over 30 minutes i like shorter shumps . Some of the bullets especially the final boss are so fast without focus mode they are a pain to avoid you really need to learn the pattern cause they just zip on you i didn't have time to see them they were so fast. Not a fan of health system's usually i'm more 3 life type but i believe there a classic or hardcore more or something without it. And so much blue sh** exp on the screen when you kill enemies sometimes you get confused when you are concentrating on the bullets.

Anyway, I looked into the publisher, New Blood Interactive, to find that they had quite a few favorably reviewed games, and I picked this one up because it was cheap and I didn't have too many SHMUPs in my collection.

In this game you play through 6 bullet/explosion-filled levels with one of 17 ships, taking down the boss at the end of it. You have a score multiplier, a 'hyper' attack, and a 'focus' meter, which works like bullet time. 

Pros: quick and easy to pick up and play, there's a lot of variety in the ships (17 to choose from, each with a different archetype you may be familiar with from other SHUMPs), a boss rush and endless level mode if you prefer either the bosses or levels to the main arcade mode, and quite a few difficulties to the main arcade mode to choose from. The game is extremely colorful and flashy, and the music is pretty solid (aside from the weeb chorus during the end credits. That made me cringe a little bit internally, as I have an ear for whether or not a yellow man or greater aryan is singing in moon runes).

Cons: I feel that there is such a thing as too much variety in ship selection. Sometimes less really is more. You'll find yourself not wanting to stick with just one ship since the playstyles are so different, which will encourage you to cycle through all 17 ships when you can, making it so it's hard to develop one single strategy. This problem bleeds into the main arcade game, where you *can* switch out your ship at the start of each new level, which is nice, but not after you die to a boss. This means you'll have to play through the main game, like, 3 times to have a chance to play each ship once, and the game isn't *so* good to warrant that. This bleeds into the next problem I had where I was locked into the final boss with just one ship.

Now, the final boss is complete horse sh*t. I'm no SHMUP expert BY FAR, but this was ridiculous. If you peak into the forum for this game, even the dev is well aware of this fact. I was playing on veteran mode, normal difficulty, and I coasted through the first 5 levels, 5 bosses, and final level, only dying maybe once to the 3rd or 4th level boss. A difficulty spike for a final boss is expected, but this is damn near impossible. The achievement I got for beating the boss, only 7% of the people who own this game have, and I only have it because after the 9th death, the game inexplicably began glitching out and causing infinite 'focus' (slowdown).

One last minor complaint would be the story, which looking around the comments and reviews, no one else cared for either. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the devs put a lot of effort into it, which makes me feel bad for the animators, writers, and voice actors. It reminds me of a more incoherent, less interesting Ace Combat story line. On the second play through, I just skipped the cutscenes.

So, in the end what you have is a pretty fun (but not massively fun) SHMUP game for an extremely cheap and reasonable price. It'll keep you entertained for 3-7 hours, would be my guess, which isn't bad for $1-2. My recommendation is to play through the game on Veteran/Normal, get to the end boss, rage quit, then play on the more laid back/superior Endless mode while you mess around with the different ships.

Only buy this game if all those caveats sound okay to you.",1585544547,1585544547,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo, which also includes Super Galaxy Squadron Classic is a game developed by Synset and published by New Blood Interactive

The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo, which also includes Super Galaxy Squadron Classic overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay action game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

Visuellement, il présente un look rétro plutôt réussi. La bande son est également agréable et très entrainante et s'accorde à merveille avec le genre.

Je trouve le titre relativement accessible du point de vue de la difficulté. Un débutant sur ce genre pourra bien s'amuser. Pour les vétérans, un grand nombre de modes de difficulté permet de bien personaliser celle-ci. 

Du point de vue du contenu, on retrouve différents modes de jeu :
- un mode arcade qui se présente sous forme d'une succession de niveaux (incluant boss) entrecoupés de cut-scenes.
- un mode endless qui propose de jouer une session de manière inifinie avec une succession d'ennemi jusqu'à ce que le joueur perde ce qui met fin à la partie.
- un mode boss rush qui permet de rejouer successivement les boss du jeu.

Il y a 17 vaisseaux à prendre en main. Certains ont un gamplay très spécifiques, et on prend beaucoup de plaisir à les tester le temps d'un run. Les 3 derniers ajoutés dernièrement sont vraiment sympas. Ce grand nombre de vaisseaux jouables est pour moi une vrai valeur ajoutée comparativement à d'autres titres du même genre.

Le contenu est donc intéressant, et présente une bonne rejouabilité.

Pros:
-A lot of different ships
-Double mechanic in the EX version, bullet time and the ship's unique hyper
-2 games in one, and the classic version looks amazing too
-Every ship hitbox is extremly small, making crazy dodges possible
-3 difficulty modes, Casual, Veteran and Hell, along with 2 modes, Normal (With checkpoints and a refillable life bar via health items) and Hardcore (No health items, no checkpoints, you only get one coin)
-Beautiful graphics in both versions
-Comes with the OST in 320 mp3 quality (while not lossless, its still a nice detail)
-Game install is really small (147 Mb, ost included)
-Has an addictive endless mode, along with boss rush
-Achievements (take that, ZUN!)
-Dirt cheap
-Hidden overcharge system, if you combo really well and keep the kills coming, makes your ship extra strong for a limited time
-Has a lot of charisma
-Leaderboards!

Cons:
-Hyper bar on the side is too shiny when fully recharged, and can be a bit distracting
-No rebindable controls (come on dude)
-Difficulty in normal is a breeze until you reach the bosses, specially the final boss
-The japanese ship feels a bit underpowered without full powerup on the main gun (its a penetrating shotgun type, and without upgrades it has almost no reach)
-For some reason avast considers the game a virus, some alexa generic virus or something, but totally sure its a false positive
-The ending is meh, just credits roll and score, along with a vocal version of the main theme
-Hitbox for the powerups is really small, so you can miss the items and look like an idiot
-No dedicated slow movement button a la touhou, you instead are expected to move the joystick very slightly to move slowly, and that is impossible if you use a keyboard",1578128044,1578128044,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pretty good. Fun for fairly short periods of time.

This is a fun little vertically scrolling schmup action game in the general style of early 1990s arcade games (think of 2-dimensional arcade space action games that were sort of like Galaga but came out years afterward). This game has a generally uninteresting though unobtrusive plot.

+Easy for beginners (until you get to the game’s final boss) but provides a good challenge for higher level players.

+Easy, responsive controls.

+No major bugs.

+Several playable characters/ships all of which are available immediately and do not need to be unlocked. Each character/ship has fairly unique weapons.

+/-Sound effects are simple and a bit traditional and scratchy sounding but each sound is meaningful and useful.

+/-You can change characters/ships every new level but cannot change your character/ship immediately before a boss fight.

+/-Several game modes, at least 2 difficulty levels and an earlier “classic” version of the same game is included but there are only 6 main areas/levels to play before the game ends.

+/-OK graphics in a sort of pixel art style though it makes use of a lot of pastel colors.

+/-Good sense of speed but some space backgrounds are simplistic and can get boring.

+/-An almost frustratingly difficult final boss (even on the lowest difficulty). 

+/-Generally uninteresting plot but then the plot doesn’t interfere with the classic feel of the arcade style action gameplay either.

-No apparent online multiplayer capability (and this game could really benefit from a nice cooperative online mode).

-Generally bad, uninteresting music with nearly no catchy tunes.

-Most bosses are uninspired and boring.

-Most enemies are uninspired and boring.

-Most environments are uninspired and boring.",1573262734,1573262776,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]My cons:[/b]
- No key remapping. You are forced to play with the given keys, which are laid out in a weird way: X, C and Spacebar are close to each other, but you have to somehow reach Z with the same hand. You can't use WASD like I'm used to.
- No tutorial. You are shown the controls, but not the game mechanics. The game left me wondering how items and special attacks work until I was in stage 3.
- Lots of cutscenes with essentially nothing going on. Just technical blabbering about space warfare etc. that have nothing to do with the gameplay...
- Nothing is memorable. All 6 stages seem the same, just hordes of enemies spawning in vague patterns. Even the bosses are hard to remember.
- If this game is a ""Bullet Hell"", then it might as well be called a ""Collectible/Item Hell"". There are just as many collectable things flying around as there are bullets, which I find distracting and pointless.
- Player and bullet hitboxes are so tiny, I could often just move effortlessly through big sprays of bullets without getting hit.
- The bosses are a lot more difficult than the stages. I often reached the bosses with full health and then lost most of it attempting to navigate through their narrow bullet walls.
- You spend most of the time just spraying around with your weapon without focussing on anything. Most of the ships are destroyed just by moving around a little.
- Way too many different player ships to choose from. No thanks.
- When I played the classic variant of the game, the first boss glitched out after a minute and made it impossible to finish the stage.

Estava com um precinho daqueles que não dava pra deixar passar e acabei pegando e sem esperar muito fui jogar. Nunca me diverti tanto com um game assim.

O jogo conta com 6 fases e varias dificuldades para todos os tipos de jogadores, alguns modos de jogo,  e mesmo nos níveis mais simples não será fácil finaliza - lo.

Difficulty is rather uneven - levels are either too easy or too difficult.

Not a lot of variety between levels.  Probably the backgrounds and enemy ships are different but I didn't notice. On the other hand there is variety and replayability in the large choice of player ships/characters available.

There is a story which is told via a few animations and some poor voice acting.

[i]Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo[/i] is a top-down, bullet-hell ""shoot 'em up"" game in the purest sense. For those familar with games like [i]Ikaruga[/i], you'll feel right at home here. Featuring great pixel-art and fast paced ""dodge bullets, blow up spaceships"", SGS provides that arcade-like experience for retro fans. Though the campaign is fairly short, there's an endless mode and boss rush mode, as well as 17 different ships to try out.

[h1] You Should [b]Buy[/b] This Game If: [/h1]
[list][*]You really like bullet-hell shoot-em-up games and are looking for a quick distraction.[/list]

[h1] You Should [b]Skip[/b] This Game If: [/h1]
[list][*]You dislike having your screen covered in deadly moving shapes.
[*]You already have access to this type of shoot-em-up game (this one offers nothing unique).
[*]You're looking for a story-driven or lengthy gameplay experience.[/list]

[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]
What can I say, it's a shoot 'em up. It delivers exactly what you'd expect, nothing more and nothing less. I'm not typically a fan of these types of games, but I received [i]Super Galaxy Squadron[/i] in a bundle a while back and figured I'd give it a go.

I can't say I'm that impressed. I had fun for a little while, but after around the hour mark, the game gets a little repetitive and dull. The enemies just aren't interesting enough. They all do the same thing: enter from the top, shoot a few projectiles, then proceed to get obliterated. Rinse and repeat.

The six bosses are equally as tiring, as they take a ridiculous number of hits and resort to just filling your screen with shapes rather than doing anything interesting or interactive. And if you want to talk about lame, the final boss is literally a giant ball.

The game offers 17 ships, but honestly I'm satisfied with just the two I tried out. There's no incentive to go back 15 more times.

I can't recommend this game, especially at a $12 price tag. Go pick up [i]Spy Fox 2[/i] and play its ""Things from Space"" instead.",1521421859,1521421859,False,7,0,0.614280521869659424,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You're certainly going to have a lot more trouble if you're not using a joystick, but playing in casual difficulty on lunch break at work would be a lot nicer if I could use WASD. Ironically, picking a ship with worse maneuvrability (aka slower movement speed) is best when playing with the keyboard. Still, just use a controller if you can.

I don't play manic shooters (aka bullet hell) very often and I'll say this is one of the more accessible ones I've tried - although the final boss certainly made me give up on a few otherwise flawless playthroughs. I haven't had this much fun on a game of this kind since I discovered the Frantic flash games ages ago. I found the veteran difficulty to be just the right amount of challenge for me (middle out of three options).

The campain is made of six levels and is quite short, you'll tear through it in a single sitting. However, many ships have gimmicky controls that will make you want to retry the game with all of them. The boss rush and endless modes are nice little extras, but you'll probably be able to complete the campain and most achievements in 3h. All that will be left is to play through the game in hardcore mode: no health pickups and no checkpoints. There isn't anything to increase the durability like unlockables or customization options. If you're the kind of person who plays a game to a satisfying level of completion and never touches it again, you might want to pass on this one. But it certainly is a great game and I know I will spend hours playing the endless mode casually whenever I have a short break.

The game's graphics are flawless. Both your hitbox and enemy bullets stand out, making them easy to notice within the ton of sprites covering the screen at all times.

I also commend the devs for the amount of content added after the EX Turbo update. I still have yet to try out all of the ships.

I will say that sometimes the levels can feel a bit samey. A bit more variety in the backgrounds could help there. The boss variety is decent, however. Also the bullet patterns tend to get cluttered to the point where I can't tell what's happening (I guess that's what the slow-down mechanic is for). Despite those issues, I'll still be picking this up again from time to time.

Excellent Danmaku à la réalisation tout en gros pixel qui fait bip, proposant 6 stages totalement orientés esquive ""au réflexe"", SGSEXT cumule les spécificités qui vont dans le sens player-friendly à l'image de son gameplay très permissif, notamment grâce à sa barre de vie rechargeable ou encore de la possibilité d'user de ""bullet-time"" pour se sortir du pétrin quand ça se charge un peu trop.

Le scoring est addictif en diable grâce à sa jauge de combo (bien difficile à optimiser, les placements ratés ne pardonnent généralement pas), les boss donnent du fil a retordre, le rythme ne faiblis quasiment jamais, bref on s'éclate très facilement, et la profondeur est au rendez vous pour qui souhaiterai optimiser un peu tout ça : un très bon mode Boss rush ainsi qu'un excellent mode Endless seront également de la partie, permettant le même gameplay que pour le mode Story.
De plus, avec pas moins de 17 vaisseaux vraiment différents, on peux raisonnablement parler de diversité dans l'approche permise par le jeu. Et ça, c'est bonnard.

Ce titre se place tout simplement parmi les indispensables Steam de mon point de vue, que ce soit pour ses qualités intrinsèques indéniables, dont sa grosse re-jouabilité, ou encore par le simple fait de constituer une exclusivité PC particulièrement complète.

Sadly, for all the updates and upgrades this game has there is a lot to be desired. 

-Arcade mode is basically Story Mode, (no this game does not include a separate Story Mode). After every level is a fully voiced cutscene. Look i appreciate the thought put into this but for a shmup the less of a story the better. Have a intro reel play before i hit the start button and give me a nice cutscene after i beat the game. You know what's funny though? After beating the game all you get is a screen or two of text basically saying ""congratulations"". No fully voiced ending here, its like the devs spent all their budget and shoehorned in the text as an afterthought. 

-There's about 10 ships to choose from but over half of them are useless because of their stats. 

-Every time you get hit you lose powerups which for some reason float toward the top of the screen, (and also disappear quite quickly). 

-The bosses are supposed to be intimidating and fierce but here they show up and just sit there. That, and like another reviewer has said, they are giant bullet sponges that are a grind to beat. Dont even get me started on the last boss' health (which btw the devs decided that the last boss doesnt show a health bar for some dumb reason). 

-The music is tinny and annoying as all hell. I enjoy 8-bit style music but this is really bad.

Endless and Arcade Hell hardcore mode add good challenge.
LOVE the maaaaany options for graphics style, from the early 80's right up to modern time (VIC 20, 240 vga, Amiga, C64 etc)

「Super Galaxy Squadron」は最初パッとしない「ああ、海外のファンが日本のこれ系を模倣して作った感じかな」
程度の出来で悪く言えば単調地味だったのですが、EXを経て今回のアップデートで
敵機破壊時のエフェクトがど派手になり爽快感大幅アップ。
目の肥えた弾幕シューターにもアピールできるゲームになったと思います。


基本操作は
・ショット（プライマリ・セカンダリの二種類。共にショットボタンで同時発射）
・ハイパー（得点アイテム回収→ゲージマックスで発動。機体により効果はは多種多様）
の2ボタンだったのが新たに「スローモフォーカス」が追加。
ゲージがある状態で発動すると時間の経過を遅くすることができます。
これにより初心者でも「画面を埋め尽くす弾幕の間を通り抜ける」事が格段に容易になっています。
またこのフォーカスゲージは敵機破壊で回復するので回収も容易です。

アップデート前までは判定が非常にシビアだった
「敵機を連続で破壊し続けることによって得点に倍率がかかる」という稼ぎシステムも
ターボというだけあって敵機の出現数も敵の放つ弾も倍増した事で倍率維持が容易になっています。
最大で倍率10倍になったので弾幕好きは買ってみて損はしないんじゃないでしょうか。
特にエンドレスモードの敵機の圧倒的出現数とさじを投げたくなるレベルの弾幕は
プレイヤーに非常に挑戦的です。

日本ではなく海外のゲーム会社からこういう良作が出ていることに素直に驚きと喜びを覚えました。
また日本の会社に負けないぐらいのSTGを作ってほしいです。

-dev notes on TURBO update

Well, let's speak on full-featured shootemups.
SGSEXT lacks a replay mode, a TATE mode, a practice mode, and a frame counter. Pretty much all these should be expected in a modern vertical PC STG.
It also lacks remappable controls and seperate volume options for music and sound effects. All PC games should have this. 
Since the dev update makes it clear that this is the super mega final version forever, I assume none of these things will ever be added, making the above statement seem pretty ridiculous. When STG players think ""full-featured"", ""Endless Mode"" is likely the last thing on their mind. Study what actual habitual players of your game want, not just the casual indie game bundle shoppers.

Some of the music is pretty cool and most of the art is much better than the gameplay.
The gameplay is fun enough for a few playthroughs, but suffers from poor tuning. The first boss is too hard, the final stage is too easy,etc. The FINAL WEAPON is annoying to play with infinite lives(AKA standard difficulty). Infinite lives on a TLB? Go ahead and give me a game over, I stopped after 20 tries and had to turn the game off. Merciful death in shootemups is actually a good thing, the game is supposed to boot you out if you suck too hard so you can go do something else for awhile. Infinite lives just means you get to bash your head against the wall or give up manually. Modern game devs are quick to dispose of antiquated systems, while missing the reasons they work.

The respawning health system and bullet time seem like a crutch for poor tuning if you ask me.
This game supports GRAZING, yet it does not have a BRAKE button to slow your ship. These days, that seems pretty silly, especially with bullets this fast. Bullet time doesn't count, it's limited-use and is a lazy mechanic in almost ANY game. The fact that games market it as a feature is ridiculous, it doesn't take an amazing programmer to make a game run slower. Most danmaku games will give you a brake if grazing is expected or if bullet speed/density is as high as it is in this game.

I ignored this game for a long time and eventually got it on sale. Many many months later, I've only booted it a few times. I don't think it's as bad as some players do. Mostly it's a generic western indie retro STG that, like most similar games, fail to offer much besides pretty bullets and constant explosions. There are dozens of better shooting games on Steam and most of them were made in Japan. Western indies just don't understand these kinds of games, and most players, if they haven't been paying attention to the last 20 years of imports, wouldn't even know what they were missing. With that in mind, here are some other titles I feel better deserve your attention:

Le tout est en scrolling vertical, il y a plusieurs modes de difficulté et un mode sans fin. Le jeu se veut dans la veine Danmaku (Pluie de boulettes si google trad a bien bossé). Comprendre qu'il va y avoir plein de projectiles à éviter et faire du scoring.

L'une des particularités de SGSE est de ne pas proposer de continue, ni de crédit, mais un système de sauvegarde assez simple : L'arrivée au boss déclenche une sauvegarde automatique tout comme le début de chaque niveau. Entre les deux, la mort se solde par un retour au début du niveau (de là à dire que c'est pour rallonger la durée de vie...).
Il y a un choix assez impressionnant de vaisseaux (une douzaine environ) avec leurs particularités. Le gameplay consiste à éviter les boulettes et tuer les ennemis en face. Rien d'original sauf qu'il y a une jauge de vie et une d'hyper qu'il faut remplir pour déclencher le tir secondaire (différent suivant le vaisseau choisi). Les ennemis donnent de la vie assez régulièrement et laissent parfois tomber des petits bonus pour augmenter le tir principal et le secondaire. Le maximum étant de cinq augmentations pour chaque. Le reste se transforme en points et le fait de se faire toucher baisse la jauge de vie (à un moment, il faut bien justifier son existence), occasionne la perte d'un ou plusieurs bonus qu'il faudra récupérer (prévoir un petit temps avant de les ramasser).

Les graphismes sont assez jolis sauf que la direction artistique est ultra générique avec des niveaux qui sont, pour la plupart, statiques et sans intérêt. Le ""bestiaire"" est très limité en plus d'être particulièrement peu inspiré même les boss ( peu marquants et réutilisés sur 6 niveaux).
La visibilité est parfois problématique. Cela vient peut être de moi, mais j'ai trouvé que la palette de couleurs des boulettes était souvent très proche de celle des vaisseaux.
Le boss de fin m'a posé énormément de problème, mais je mettrais plutôt ça sur le compte de mon absence totale de talent pour le genre.

La durée de vie est toujours relative et encore plus pour les shmup : 1H pour finir le mode arcade grand maximum. 100X plus si vous accrochez et voulez battre des records dans les modes les plus difficiles.


En résumé, c'est un jeu sympathique qui n'arrive pas à la cheville des ténors du genre sortis sur PC. La faute à une progression peu intéressante, des décors statiques et une direction artisitique générique couplé à un bestiaire pas assez marquant. La profusion de vaisseaux est vraiment sa seule originalité et ne suffit pas, de mon point de vue.

Very clear reverence for CAVE classics here. A big variety of ships to choose from, each with enough variation to make you want to try them all. Very colorful and well-done pixelart that falls somewhere between what you'd expect from a number of modern indie games and the classic arcade SMHUPS this is clearly inspired by. Music fits the gameplay and visuals well and is mostly very good (sadly, my least favorite track is the boss theme, which I'd really prefer to be the most hype one). Great enemy and bullet pattern variety make sure you are constantly threading the needle to avoid taking damage. 

Which leads me to the fact that there ARE some respectable modernizations (or even concessions, if you will) made to make this slightly more approachable (make no mistake, this IS a bullet hell shooter, through and through). You still have the magic pixel hitbox in the center of your ship that is common to SHMUPS, but instead of dying instantly upon getting hit, you have health, which can also be replenished with health pickups. It honestly feels like a good decision and never makes the game seem easy or dumbed-down. It's still a constant battle of attrition, particularly the boss fights, which are a constant wash of colorful projectile patterns across the screen, from both you and the boss. As a welcome stand-in for credits, and also making the game more approachable, the game has checkpoints at the beginning of each level and again before each level boss. 

All in all, one of the best SHMUPS on Steam. Doesn't do anything new with the genre, but it knows what games it wants to immitate, and it does so very successfully. Well worth the money for bullet hell fans (also includes a second verison of the game, a ""classic"" version, which is fairly different and a little more oldschool).",1472893088,1472893088,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am not a total greenhorn when it comes to shumps, I played my share of them and I consider myself to be quite fond of them, but not a shmup maniac (I'm not masochist). 

But even so... the final boss is a total misunderstanding, I played the game on casual difficulty and all went quite good, I had to repeat some levels couple of times but overall it was challenging and fun. Then came the final boss which sprays a f*ckload of projectiles.... I mean total bukake of projectiles. . I tried defeating him... I tried, I cannot even count how many times I approached the game to defeat him... it wasnt fun it wasnt challenging. It is pure frustration. Avoiding his shoots is sth impossible. You have a pattern there but then at one point along with the pattern he starts spraying extra projectiles in places that you have to escape his pattern shots and then you get hit, loose your powerups, and it all goes to shit as you try to regain them.

リズムだったり、それぞれの自機の癖だったり、その都度いろんな発見できました。
シンプルでわかりやすく、敵を倒さないと増えていくので弾幕が回避が難しくなってきます。
そして、グローバルランキングであがった時はうれしいものです。
僕みたいなSTG初心者におすすめ。値段もお手ごろな、爽快系クラシックSTG。

[h1]気になる点[/h1]
オプション項目が少ない。せめてボタン設定ぐらいさせて。
SFCパッド非対応。仕方なくJoyAdptr（外部ツール）使用。
リプレイ視聴なし・・・。今までで使ったことないからいいですけど。
アーケードのムービースキップしかできない。OFF設定ほしかったです。基本はエンドレスで遊んでるからいいですけど・・・。
あと、一部の方が絶賛するアーケードのエンディングの歌・・・。鳥肌立ちました・・・。すみません。。。正直いらないと思います。
それと、盛り上がるBGMが少ないのは欠点。

Super Galaxy Squadron is a textbook example of all style, no substance. SGS claims to be a shmup with modern design decisions and accessibility, when it really just feels like something without any of the nuance or depth that makes a good STG.

For starters, let's talk controls. There's analog movement, a fire button, and a hyper button. The fire button does not need to exist. There is never any reason to not fire your main weapon. In nearly every other shmup I've played, there's always [i]something[/i] there to make sure you're not just holding one button down the entire time, whether it be a situational weapon that requires you to stop firing, or an alternate firing button that makes you move slower for dodging bullets. Instead, SGS has a second button for your hyper, which charges up by grabbing medals dropped by enemies, and is either something that obliterates everything on screen, and/or something to clear away bullets. This is the only thing the game has to keep things varied. The game just feels utterly braindead because [i]this is all that there is[/i]. There's no intricacy or subtlety to any of the games mechanics, or even the scoring. Everything is just centered on dodging bullets and killing enemies really fast, and that's not enough for me.

Then you have the playable ships. There's fourteen of them, and they all don't feel much different. Each one will end up having a bullet spray that covers most of the screen with a few power-ups, leaving their hypers and movement speeds to make them feel unique. This simply is not enough, and each ship's ability to change to how you play is minor. They all look different, but they don't [i]feel[/i] different.

And for all the talk the description has on accessibility, there's two conveniences every other shooter has that SGS is missing; lives and continues. Instead of dying simply letting you come right back until you run out of lives, until you need to forfeit your spot on the leader boards to continue, SGS makes you go back to a checkpoint each time you die. Except in Hardcore mode, meant to give an ""arcade-like experience"" where dying shunts you right to the back of the level. I can't think of any arcade shmup that does anything like that, and that means you can't just grind through a tough section like in those other games, which is a big part of how those games can keep you invested in improving, with being able to at least see the end. 

Lastly, level and encounter design is non-existent. Stages are entirely enemies coming from the top of the screen against a starry backdrop, there's nothing interesting with how enemies are placed, or how they come in, or even interesting backgrounds that contextualize what's happening. Boss fights get more difficult by having their bullets fly faster until they can't be reasonably reacted to. Things are very plain and breezy until they suddenly get unfair. 

On the bright side, the game has really great music, beautiful, colorful pixel art, and really classy style for days. But that's all it has going for it. For anyone looking for a good shmupping time, I strongly recommend just about anything else on Steam. Triangle Service's games, the Alltynex series, anything that has more substance than this.",1468553695,1578202281,False,12,0,0.585249543190002441,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is simple: humans and aliens don't get along, so what happens? We go to war. We send the Super Galaxy Squadron out to rock some socks. And boy, will socks get rocked.

First and foremost, there are a vast amount of different ships to choose from. Do you like slow and powerful? Fast but weak? Concentrated fire or spray and pray? The combinations of primary fire, secondary fire, and hypers ensure that there's a perfect match for every style of play. A nice addtion to the selection of ships are short character bios for each pilot. It didn't affect gameplay at all, but it was a nice touch. My favorite was the gelatinous purple alien.

So with all of these awesome ships to choose from, how's the core game play? Very good. Destroy enemies to fill your hyper gauge, and when it's full, release your hyper attack. If you can get your score multiplier all the way to 10 and then use your hyper, your ship will enter into Overdrive and release a potent barrage of attacks. There's a subtle sense of strategy involved with knowing when to use your hyper which adds an extra level of skill to the game.

SGS: EX provides an arcade/story mode replete with auto-saves and checkpoints. Feel like that's too easy? Set the game to max difficulty and turn off the health items and checkpoints. The ability to cater to all skills levels was a nice touch. Aside from arcade, there's also Endless mode where I spent two hours the night I downloaded playing as every character. You know what felt good? SSS ranking one of my sessions. The Endless mode alone is worth this purchase.

Buy this. The pixel art is great, the music is fantastic, and it's a very competent shooter. If there was an issue I had with it, I would say that the screen can become a little too cluttered with your bullets, enemy bullets, and hyper tokens. Especially with the final boss.

뉴타입들이나 하게된 탄막슈팅게임중에선 입문용으로 할만한 게임
도돈파치같은 느낌으로 플레이 할 수 있지만 난이도를 확 낮춘 느낌
기수제가 아닌 헬스제에 체력회복 아이템도 잘 나와서 난이도는 상당히 하락했다.

피탄범위가 심할정도로 작아서 노리고 피한다기보다 이동하다보니 피해지는 경우가 많다.
기체 중앙의 코어처럼 보이는게 피탄범위라고 생각된다.

각 기체의 스펙은 3종으로 파워, 내구력, 이동력으로 나뉘어져있다.
캐릭터는 많지만 밸런스는 그다지 좋은편은 아니다.
고내구 저속도 캐릭터가 대체로 사용하기 편하다.
특히 Amber의 경우는 혼자 다른 난이도에서 플레이 하는 기분이 든다.

피탄범위가 적고 피탄시 무적시간이 없어서  캐릭터 스피드가 빠르면 오히려 불리하다.
덕분에 Cyon은 난이도가 산으로 가버린 느낌

[b]10/7.5[/b]

탄막슈팅형 게임치고 난이도가 낮은편이라 슈팅초보가 입문용으로 하기 좋은 게임이다. (캐주얼 모드 추천)
EX버젼과 클래식버젼은 비슷하지만 생각보다 게임성이 다른지라 2가지 슈팅을 하는 셈
문제점을 들자면 보스전 이외의 난이도가 너무 낮다.

I originally backed this game when it was in the Kickstarter phase. In their video, they discussed wanting to make a shmup that brought the old-style feel into it. That\'s what sold me, and they delivered.

+Arcade style game: 
This means you can hop right in without needing a tutorial, lengthy explanation, back story, etc. It gives you a brief intro and off you go.

+Nice look/feel: 
The game plays really smoothly and looks great! I used to love these games in the arcade so playing it was nostalgic.

+Challenging: 
Games like this are always a bit challenging, so thats good.

The Bad:
-Volume Resets Itself: 
The volume, out of the box, is loud as hell. If you turn it down, close and then relaunch the game, the volume will reset to default. The slider will say its lower, but you'll need to tinker with it again to get it lower.

-Boring?:
I don't know, I found this boring. Maybe on the harder modes its more adreneline pumping, but the overall experience for me so far has been eh. 

-Music: 
The music isn't that great and just repeats the same song over and over again until you finish the level. Bosses have boss music, each map has a unique song, but all of them aren't that great/kinda annoying.

Overall: 5/10

If you're looking for a game with a amazing story, look else where. This game is straight to the point. Pick a ship that suits your taste, blasts things to hell while avoiding a screen full of lasers, bombs and plasma blasts.

보통 슈팅게임하면 한번맞으면 폭☆발 하면서 죽어버리는데
우선 이 게임은 체력이라는 시스템이 있는 것 만으로 진입장벽을 확 낮춰줘서
나같은 탄막장애가 있는 사람들도 시작을 불편없이 할 수 있게 만들어줬다.

총 14가지의 개성있는 전투기들로 1942같은 전개로 진행이되는데
각 전투기마다 주무기, 보조무기, 하이퍼무기의 세가지 탄막을 들고 시작한다.
하이퍼는 적을 맞출때마다 게이지가 상승되어서 일종의 스킬처럼 발동되는 무기이며,
주무기는 일반적인 탄막, 보조무기는 레이저로 이루어져있고
이 두개는 오른쪽 상단에 각각 얼마정도 파워업되어있는지도 알 수 있게 표시된다.

특히 이 파워업이 정말 맘에들었던게 한대 맞았을때 확률적으로 파워업 아이템이 드롭되어서
적한테 맞았다는것에 대한 어느정도의 보상이 되기도 하고 어렵사리 적들을 죽이는것만으로
풀업상태로 게임을 할 수 있는게 아니었다는것이 정말 만족스러웠다.

마지막으로 이 게임의 메인디쉬라 할 수 있는 오버드라이브모드가 있는데
왼쪽상단의 콤보가 x10에 도달하면 발동할 수 있으며 말그대로 존나짱쎄진다.
주무기고 보조무기고 발사속도나 그 파워가 어마무시해짐에따라 맵을 싸그리 정리할 수 있다.
물론 그에맞게 점수또한 몇배이상을 얻을 수 있으므로 지속적인 콤보누적을 목표로 하자.

레트로풍 분위기를 잘 살리면서 동시에 인터페이스가 유저특화되어있어
한눈에 게임플레이와 HUD를 볼 수있는 것또한 추가점수를 줄 수 있다.

슈팅게임은 하고싶은데 난이도가 높아서 못하겠다 싶은분들에게 꼭 추천해주고싶다.

Super Galaxy Squadron Ex es un juego del genero 'Bullet Hell' el cual en los ultimos años se ha puesto de moda y por ello se pueden encontrar muchos juegos clonicos los cuales no aportan demasiado.

Por suerte este juego tiene ese algo, que lo hace unico, no es el mejor juego de este genero ni mucho menos, pero personalmente me ha divertido durante mis sesiones de juego y no me ha parecido para nada uno mas del monton.

[u]Historia[/u]: Aunque parezca mentira, si, tiene historia, y sintiendolo mucho me salte todas las escenas que se muestran al empezar/finalizar las misiones, aunque personalmente no crea que sea necesario en este tipo de juegos darle demasiado peso a este apartado, lo poco que llegue a ver parecia bastante trabajado y si como a mi no te interesa siempre puedes saltarlo comodamente presionando un boton.

[u]Graficos/Arte[/u]: Tengo que admitir que este apartado esta bastante bien realizado en enemigos, balas, y la interfaz, aunque si que me faltaria un mayor detalle en el mapeado, siendo bastante monotono en general (a excepcion de la ultima mision en la cual mejora un poco)

[u]Musica/Sonidos[/u]: Siendo un apartado que suelo valorar bastante en este tipo de juegos cumple bien en cantidad/calidad de sonidos pero se queda un poco flojo en la musica, la cual no destaca ni para bien ni para mal (a excepcion de la ultima mision, en la cual al igual que el arte mejora un poco).

[u]Controles[/u]: El juego se luce en este apartado 10/10 al menos con mando de xbox one, el movimiento es muy fluido y permite navegar entre las balas de manera que no he sentido en casi ningun otro.

[u]Jugabilidad[/u]: Manejas una nave (de las 14 posibles) y tu trabajo es matar una oleada tras otra de enemigos hasta que llegas al jefe de cada fase los cuales son bastante diferentes entre si,

Como se ha dicho antes se te dara la eleccion de elegir entre 14 naves con las que demostrar de lo que estas hecho, cada una de ellas es totalmente diferente en estilo, forma de las balas, forma de jugar, esto le da bastante rejugabilidad, ademas en la pantalla de seleccion se dara informacion de su daño/armadura/velocidad.

Al iniciciar la partida empezaras solo con las armas principales de la nave pero matando a enemigos iran soltando mejoras con la que podras llegar a nivel 5 del arma primaria y secundaria todo ello sin parar el ritmo frenetico del juego, otra cosa a destacar es que las 'bombas' o 'comodines' como yo los llamo tipicos de este genero que hacen un gran daño a todo lo que esta en pantalla (incluso las balas desaparecen) y te hace inmune durante un periodo de tiempo, en este juego es el llamado modo overdrive, que consta de 1 unica carga que se ira llenando segun consigamos unos objetos azules que sueltan los enemigos al morir, muy necesario para sobrevivir a algunos ataques.

El juego te presenta 2 modos de juego:
         
Arcade: Comunmente llamado 'modo historia' el cual te presenta 6 misiones que se deben cumplir secuencialmente,           en cada una de ellas al final se presentara el jefe de cada fase. El modo historia te da ha elegir entre 3 dificulltades posibles.

Endless: Lucha de manera continua contra oleadas y oleadas de enemigos, que aumentan de manera progresiva y que te llevan al limite.

[u]Dificultad[/u]: La curva de dificultad esta bien aunque si que tengo que decir que me ha molestado un poco la pequeña diferencia que existe entre los 3 modos que te dan ha elegir, no se me entienda mal, la diferencia es significativa, pero comparando con otros juegos parecidos en los cuales puedes pasarte el juego en facil llendo un poco sobrado, poner el juego en normal y no llegar al jefe de la segunda mision. Destacar tambien que puede que la dificultad en este juego varie demasiado entre fase de llegar al jefe (se me antoja un poco facil, monotona) y el propio jefe el cual si que puede llegar a ser un reto.

En definitiva recomiendo este juego, aunque por 10$ quiza existan mejores opciones actualmente, si el precio disminuye o el juego mejora (al parecer los desarrolladores siguen actualizandolo gratis)  es un compra obligatoria para cualquier amante del genero o los que se quieran introducir.",1460569201,1460569844,True,4,0,0.585798859596252441,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Cela va de son look retro au cœur de son gameplay en passant par ses musiques ; on retrouve dans le jeu de Psyche Studios et New Blood les sensations des shoot’em up ayant faits les beaux jours de l’arcade et des consoles des ères 16 et 32 bits.  Pad en main (ou au clavier si vous préférez, mais sachez tout de même qu’il n’y a aucun moyen de reconfigurer les contrôles), la belle musique de Random Encounter à fond, on est au plus proche de ce à quoi un voyage dans le temps pourrait ressembler de nos jours. SGS EX respecte tous les codes du genre : à bord de votre vaisseau spatial (14 vaisseaux aux armes et statistiques plus ou moins différentes sont jouables), vous devez avancer au fil de niveaux de plus en plus durs, essayant tant bien que mal de survivre aux vagues d’ennemis remplissant l’écran d’une infinité de « bullets  » mortelles. 

Super Galaxy Squadron EX est un jeu apportant un fun immédiat et sans fin, pour peu que vous accrochiez au genre qu’est le danmaku. Accessible à tous, il permet de faire passer un bon moment aux néophytes du genre à la recherche de quelques heures d’explosions et de shoot comme aux fans à la recherche de challenge nécessitant réflexes et beaucoup de pratique. Terminable en quelques heures, le jeu a cependant pas mal de replay value entre son mode endless et les différents vaisseaux, plusieurs styles de jeu clairement différents étant disponibles. Le tout est accompagné de graphismes rétro qui font du bien aux yeux et d’une excellente OST qui en fait d’autant aux oreilles (d’ailleurs disponible sur Bandcamp, Steam, Spotify ou peu importe là où vous aimez votre musique).

First off, apologies to the individuals responsible for this game's storyline. Everytime I played, I skipped all of the cut-scenes. All I know is that the bad guys have to be destroyed, and there's something involving a core. I'll be real here, I tend to prefer STG storylines that are badly-translated, don't make a lot of sense, or are just flat-out insane. Anyway, there are six stages and several ships to choose from, have at it.

The level of difficulty can ""best"" be described as bullethell...but not really. There are more tiny orbs of deadly danger than average, but rarely will you ever navigate a sea of bullets. Why? Because if the situation comes to that, then you did something very wrong, and you'll probably die soon. Enemy ships tend to stay on-screen a long time. This gives them more than a couple opportunities to unleash their payload. While it certainly benefits your livelihood to destroy enemies as quickly as possible, you might want to hold off occasionally...

The scoring system is based around a multiplier guage. Almost every type of ship is worth a +.1, and these add up very quickly. Sometimes you'll want to keep enemies alive for an extra half-second or so to help manage your guage. Upon hitting the maximum of x10(!), then you'll want to use your hyper weapon. This will trigger overdrive aka FEVER mode, and all pick-ups are worth ten times their value. 

When it comes to making a good STG, dodging and shooting are the most important aspects. This is where the game really shines. Everything has a natural feel to it. When you're avoiding bullets, you acquire this 6th sense, and sink into a sense of sublimity. To put it another way, I like this game because I [i]don't[/i] notice anything that stands out. To me, 2D shooters should be business as usual. Things that stand out tend to be bad, like erratically-moving bullets, weird/poor hit-boxes, and so on. There's none of that nonsense in this game.

The overdrive/fever system is really neat, but unfortunately it doesn't come into play very often. I suppose this should be blamed on my lack of skill, but I can only catch the FEVER maybe once or twice a play-through. At around the 7x to 9x mark, the multiplier guage can drop at an extremely fast rate, and I just can't seem to destroy enemies quickly enough. While this is going on, some potential moments for huge points are missed out on. For example, there are nearly-invisible rings at certain points in the game. If you fly your ship inside them and fire away, you'll discover a medal worth 500,000 points. Imagine grabbing that shiny behemoth while under the effects of a FEVER. 

But let's consider the possibility that I'm wrong, and it's not actually my fault. The reason I and possibly others can't maximize our scoring potential is because the playable ships are a little too weak. I'm not asking for a huge buff, just 15-20% more damage for most ships, and possibly larger boosts for certain ships. I noticed that one of them uses a lot of close-range weaponry. For piloting such a high-risk piece of junk, I expect to do a ton of damage.

As good as Super Galaxy Squadron EX is, it still requires some refinements. The top-scores on the leaderboards can be attributed to the game sometimes not resetting the score when starting a new game. My 60+ million score at or near the top is the result of two play-throughs. The final boss is far more difficult than anything else in the game, and requires a lot of needle-threading. Some ships are just too fast to safely weave between everything, and other ships are too weak to destroy the boss in a reasonable amount of time. Then there are the minor issues like rumble and screen-shaking re-enabling itself everytime I start a new game.

I figure that this game is still being worked on, but even in its current state, I highly recommend it. This is one extremely solid STG.",1458048901,1458049025,True,23,2,0.701381385326385498,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I have only played EX, and not the original version of the game.

I recommend this game, but with a few caveats.  First, the good:  The pixel art of the graphics is very well done.  Every ship, enemy, background, and attack looks good.  The music is amazing.  You could play this game just to listen to the music and it would probably be worth it.  There are 14 ships to choose from, and that is a huge plus.  Each has its own pilot with a couple-sentence long story that adds some flavor to the game.  I appreciated this touch.  The Endless mode is another plus for this game; it makes a fun little diversion when you are low on time but really want to just shoot stuff up.

Now, for the negative...backgrounds and enemies do get repetitive.  Many levels have the same enemies and while each level has a unique background, some have no transitions and those that do have only 1 or 2.  This can make the levels, especially the first 4 or so, kind of boring and repetitive.  If you play on Hell difficulty you may not notice the lack of variety so much, but you will definitely get used to the same enemies and attack patterns.  Speaking of attack patterns, this game bills itself as not really a bullet hell, and that is mostly true on the stages.  There are alot of patterns that aren't necessarily dense but require fast dodging, kind of like what might be seen in a Raiden game.  Then, on the bosses, there are some patterns similar to those ""fast dodging"" games, but also other patterns straight outta Touhou.  This game definitely treads on bullet hell territory on the bosses, which makes for a somewhat jarring experience.  Another issue I had in terms of difficulty, is the second attack pattern on the next to last boss on Veteran and Hell difficulties.  I got to the final stage and first boss pretty easily on veteran, but I cannot fathom how to dodge this pattern.  It was like all of a sudden the game jumped in difficulty tremendously.  I am fine with hard games, especially in a shmup but the very sudden spike really frustrates me (I still can't beat this boss).  I figured I would try the game on Hell for a different kind of challenge....and I still reached the boss, granted, not as quickly as on Veteran, but I didn't have any major troubles either.  Even on Hell, the difficulty spikes so high on that second attack pattern.  To make this even more frustrating, the official video on youtube for this game which demonstrates the sixth stage is actually missing this attack pattern for some reason, which really confuses me.  On novice, it can be cleared fairly easily, so I was at least able to see the ending.  And speaking of the ending...it had no cutscene, a super short conclusion, and no voiced content (whereas stage transitions did have these), so it felt very anticlimatic.  It really feels like the very end game needs a little more work.

Overall this game is worth the money, just don't be expecting a masterpiece.  Do expect a great soundtrack and good times to be had playing 14 different ships!",1456951161,1456951161,True,4,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GT56CIRT-c
 
[u] Summary: [/u]
Not only is Super Galaxy Squadron EX pretty solid across the board, it's one of best “remasterings” for an indie game that I've seen. The game has been turned up to 11, as the game is not only pretty to look at, but it has ramped up the enemies and challenge in several ways. The developer obviously took feedback from the original game, as UI changes makes things a lot easier to see, and it complements the strong action gameplay that has the controls necessary to get through the tight spaces in between bullet barrages. There's a lot of ship variety as well, although the number of bullet patterns do leave a bit to be desired. And the game, while it was in Early Access, seems to still have a mode that's “coming soon”, which offput me a tiny bit. But never the less, A great shmup for the price of admission here, and can not only help satisfy the SHMUP veteran, but is a good introductory game for those who want to try the genre out for the first time. All in All, a worthy purchase.


[u] Lists: [/u]
[b]+:[/b]
[list]
[*] Good basic SHMUP action. Throws everything and the kitchen sink at you, and when things get nuts, things get nuts.
[*] Controls are where they need to be. Gives you the precision to get through the onslaught of bullets that you need, without being overly sensitive. 
[*] Great presentation and aesthetic. The story presentation does the scifi theme well, but the color choices for bullets/ships was smartly put together. It's easy to see everything on the field, and it's clear that the developers understood how to complement game design with aesthetic. 
[*] Good accessibility for new players of the genre, but gives the challenge for SHMUP veterans as well.
[*] A good variety of ships. A lot of different strategies are viable because of the variety here, from close up in your face “melee” type damage to turtling damage and focusing on hitting powerful enemies. Some may feel similar in the end, but there is a level of detail that does separate the similar ships from each other.
[*] Like the weapon powerups system and how getting hit makes you drop a couple of them. Forces quick decision making as being bombarded with bullets could lead you to abandoning the power ups because of the additional damage and power ups that you'd lose. 
[*] A good example of a remastering: changing some slight mechanics in game play, upping the graphics 
[*] Decent soundtrack. Complements the scifi and gameplay rather well.
[/list]

[list]
[*] Lacking some basic options. A music slider? That seems like a standard  now a days, and no bindable keys as well. Disappointing.
[*] Could actually use a bit more variety in the bullet patterns area. Within the first few levels, it's thrown pretty much all the different patterns at you, it just throws MORE at you.
[*] Despite coming out of early access, there's still a mode that seems to be unfinished. This is a personal gripe: if you're part of early access, I expect a completed product if you're going to come out of it.

Ci sono evidenti influenze da giochi simili come Dodonpachi o Radiant Silvergun ma questo è un gioco molto più semplice.

A disposizione una vastissima gamma di navicelle che promettono dunque un fattore rigiocabilità altissimo. Ogni navicella ha caratteristiche differenti, queste differiscono per armi primarie e secondarie, agilità, potenza e frequenza di fuoco. Tuttavia, le navicelle sono troppe e coesistono purtroppo navicelle troppo avvantaggiate e navicelle orribili per masochisti. I livelli sono un po' piatti ma tutto sommato è quello che ci si può aspettare da un gioco simile. La tanica di energia è una ottima feature per quei giocatori che si vogliono cimentare con un Bullet hell in quanto, in questi giochi, i novellini sono soliti a farsi travolgere facilmente dai proiettili in arrivo. Questa tanica di energia, a sua volta, si riempirà ogni qual volta si sfiora un proiettile nemico (nonché raccogliendo gli appositi power up) perciò, quando si sta per essere travolti dai proiettili, è meglio restare sulla linea del fuoco e farsi strada attraverso i cunicoli fra un proiettile e l'altro. Questo gioco si può prestare benissimo come esercizio per i giochi più difficili come Dodonpachi o Mushihimesama o la stessa modalità Hardcore che ripropone lo stesso identico gioco solo senza questa feature: one hit kill. Interessante e divertentissima la modalità infinita che può essere giocata con o senza barra della vita e dunque in modalità normale o hardcore. 

Tutto sommato questo gioco è un sacco divertente, il gameplay è solidissimo e non è per niente frustrante... a meno che non vogliate giocare con la modalità hardcore! Unica pecca è solamente la mancanza di checkpoint; il gioco è tuttavia molto equilibrato ma il boss del livello 6 richiederà qualche tentativo in più ed è abbastanza frustrante dover riaffrontare tutto il livello solo per poter riavere una chance. Super Galaxy Squadron offre una difficoltà solida che può mettere in difficoltà anche coloro che hanno una buona esperienza con gli shmup ma forse non abbastanza per coloro che riescono a completare Radiant Silvergun senza perdere neanche una vita o vivono la loro vita completando shmup di continuo entrando in loop nello stesso gioco almeno 45 volte. Dateci una chance... e se lo comprate buona fortuna per lo stage finale!

Multiplayer: No
Completion: 1 hr
Cards: Yes
Cloud:  No

Super Galaxy Squadron is a very standard vertical bullet hell shoot 'em up.  It won't win any awards for its concept, but it does offer a surprising number of unique ships that play somewhat differently from each other. The result is a rather replayable shooter, if only to test the functions of each ship, which I found enjoyable. 

Gameplay is a standard shmup. Shoot anything that moves, avoid bullets, grab items. The items dropped by enemies are mostly random; it is thus possible to have a bunch of missiles before you ever get a laser upgrade. The game lacks a ""focus"" mode, where you can slow down your ship to maneuver tight spaces. Thus I found faster ships, which often have less armor, work against me.

There are 14 ships to choose from in this game. Surprisingly most ships have a good balance about them, though a few stood out as being much better or much worse than the others. The majority of my time spent on this game was comparing each and every ship by fully upgrading them, and finding out which ones I liked best. Every ship possesses a unique ""limit break"" of sorts. As you grab points, your bar fills up and you can unleash a powerful attack or defensive ability that is based on your current ship. These occur often enough that your ship's special power is worth taking into consideration, especially on endless mode.

There's a rudimentary plot about a cold war between humans and aliens, and every ship has a bit of backstory, which is cool. Beyond that, the game largely throws story out the window, much like the entire genre does, which is a shame because it seemed like a promising story.

Unlike most bullet hells, SGS has a health system that allows you to withstand more than one hit. On top of that, enemies occasionally drop health items to replenish your life. You can even heal yourself by getting grazed by enemy bullets. Also surprising, the invulnerability period after getting hit is relatively generous. It's a refreshing system that provides some amount of tanking ability, and is thus friendlier to new players to the genre. When you get hit, your ship will drop one of its power-ups, but it's easily reacquired by simply flying over it and grabbing it again. Hardcore mode exists for those who prefer the one-hit death style of gameplay. There seems to be no additional reward for playing on hardcore.

Most of the game is easy enough. There's six stages in total, each one lasting maybe 3-5 minutes. If you die, the game generously lets you continue on the last stage you were on. The bosses are great, being hulking machines (mostly) with collapsible parts, wide bullet patterns and just as large health pools. The last boss is such a large leap in difficulty that I'm not sure I could ever beat it with certain ship designs. It's a long enough battle that it might as well be considered a stage in of itself.

Graphics are good. It's entirely pixel-art, and well-animated, particularly explosions. I like that every upgrade you acquire is a noticeable improvement, typically giving you additional shots, and sometimes even a graphical change. I have not experienced any slowdown despite the large number of moving things, even on endless, so that gets good marks. Music is chip-tunish, and somewhat upbeat but also kind of on the forgettable side.

I recommend playing the game with a gamepad, though keyboard actually works well enough. The game did not recognize my USB gamepad; if the same occurs to you I recommend Joy2Key which often solves this problem on similar games.

While I wouldn't recommend it at full price, it's not bad at a discount. All proceeds go to the Child's Play charity, so even if you don't enjoy the game, someone else may benefit. For the game to be created by largely one person, this is a pretty commenable effort. I give Super Galaxy Squadron a 7/10. It's super short, but because of that, you can replay it in short bursts with many different ships, so it works out in the end. SGS satisfies that urge to just jump into a game and start shooting stuff without rhyme or reason.",1448751316,1448751316,True,19,1,0.596584141254425049,0,False,False,False,False,,,

En un mundo en donde los juegos parecen abrazar una complejidad que tiende hacia el infinito, con inteligencias artificiales refinadas, mundos abiertos de inmensidad mayúscula y un grafismo que ya compite con el realismo que podamos ver en las películas, este juego busca no complicarle la vida al jugador. Mata, mata y vuelve a matar. No hay más. Una simplicidad que bien parece aspirar a ser relajante.

The game has some parts which can make it very challenging like the hardcore mode and endless mode, which is great. The scoring in normal mode is totally deifferent. It seems to reward bad play over good play leaving veterans and scorechaser fallen apart or losing their ability do dodge right. There is one achievement, where you have to get hit multiple times get a high enough score by taking your fallen powerups. For me this just didn't feel right.


The powerup system is a nice idea though. You can upgrade your main shot up 8 times your firerate 5 times and your secondary weapon 7 times. The ships felt quite balanced. There are enough ships for everyone's playstyle. 
If your health reaches zero your ship explodes and the stage starts again.

But as stated in the first half of my review the game doesn't seem to reach the requirement for me to recommend it to other bullethell fan unless you want to try the hardcore mode which gonna kill you at the stage bosses. 

The artstyle is o.k. for me. Nothing special. The stage bosses have highlighted parts when struck and are destructable. The patterns itself are mostly very easy to get through except for the last level propably, which is another reason for me not recommend it. 

If you want to spend some money for a help programm you can still buy this game and have fun with it.

Overall the game is fun to play and has enough variety to play it from time to time, but for bullethellfans and veterans of shmups I can't recommend it since there are other titles you gonna buy earlier before this one: e.g. Crimzon Clover, Exceed series, Siter Skain's games,Mushimesama etc.",1442778552,1475503101,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Steamで買ったシューティングで一番おもしろい

縦シューティング,それもハドソンのキャラバンシューティングを
やりこんだ人が作ったのかな？というカンジで
とてもバランスがよく,遊んでて単純に楽しいです
見た目すごそうな弾幕に見えますが
自機の判定がかなり小さく,たいてい誘導チョン避けで避けられるので
マクロスばりに避けられます
自分がうまくなった？とカンチガイするカンジｗ
（どの機体も中央にコアのような丸がありますが
おそらくアレがアタリ判定）

東方も似たような感じで,アタリ判定が小さい故に
異常な弾幕も避けれる楽しさがありますが
ちょうどあんな感じです
難易度ノーマルなら東方よりはずっとカンタンです
東方も「この作者はシューティング好きなんだろうな～」と
よくわかるデキですが
これもそんな感じを受けました

海外の方がこうも日本式縦シューを理解して作ってると
驚くと同時に,ちょっと寂しい気もしますね
2D縦シューでも海外に負けちゃうのか･･･と

このゲーム,自機がいっぱいあって選べるんですが
機体によって難易度にかなり差があります
火力のない機体だと敵を処理できずに
画面中ザコ敵でうまっちゃったりするので
火力（POW）の高い機体をおすすめします
縛りプレイ好きなら知りませんけどｗ
白玉フル装備のシルバーホークとソルバルウくらいの差があります

オススメはAmber
拡散弾+クラスター爆弾で接射火力が高いんですが
特殊攻撃が前方シールドのため
シールド張りつつ接射するとかなりの火力がでます
ラスボスに接射→ボスのオプションが破壊→ゲージ回復アイテムが出る
→再度シールドが張れるようになる！
この流れができちゃうので,クリアは一番カンタンです

ちなみにスコアランキングが一見無いように見えますが
ちゃんと記録されてます
Steam実績の欄を見るとそこに""グローバルランキング""とあるので
アーケードモードもエンドレスモードもそこで世界順位が見れます
1500万点以上でクリアする実績もあるので
チャレンジしてみてください

エンディングは驚愕のアニソンが聞けるので
ぜひクリアしていただきたいです
海外のシューティングとしてはかなり例外的で
BGMもSEもレベル高いです

Another big change is the update to the multiplier system, which only decreases your chain when the active chain meter hits 0 instead of flatout losing the entire thing. You can also go above x5 multiplier and keep chains more easily as it takes longer now before chaining becomes unforgiving in timing. Since there appears to be more of a legitimate scoring system with potential to carry it across entire stages, I can safely say that I would recommend this even at full price now.

This could be best described as a guilty pleasure SHMUP.  It is more laid back than a typical shmup due to the fact that you can't ""lose"" or ""game over"" in the arcade mode as you will simply restart the stage you died on with score intact if you die.  Normal uses health for your ship, while Hardcore is a one hit then restart the stage ordeal.  The local scores saved don't differentiate Normal and Hardcore, so there's no particular reason to try Hardcore unless you want a challenge.

It is fun to take all of the ships for a spin and see what they are capable of, but there isn't too much really keeping people on here for an extended period of time after that.  Endless Normal is the most fun in the long run because you'll compete with others on the steam leaderboard there and it just becomes funny to see how ridiculously stacked the odds become against you once you live longer than 15 minutes.",1434605996,1455998622,True,6,1,0.507844030857086182,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[list]
[*] Severe lack of invincibility frames after taking damage.
[*] Screen doesn't clear after taking damage, even projectiles right next to your ship are uninterrupted.
[*] Power-ups are lost when taking damage, wouldn't be a problem if they didn't spawn directly on top of the projectiles surrounding your ship.
[*] Entire player sprite flashes invisible multiple times for a duration of several seconds after taking damage, making the scramble to recover lost power-ups even more of a confusing mess.
[*] Scoring system is poorly implemented and doesn't complement the gameplay.
[*] Losing a life means restarting the level from the beginning.
[*] At least 95% of all attacks are aimed in some way.
[*] Boring stages that all play exactly the same.
[*] Said boring stages drag on for 10 minutes sometimes, repeating the same waves of enemies at staggered intervals.
[*] Visual clarity isn't that great; sometimes it's difficult to differentiate objects in the foreground from objects in the background.
[*] Colors used are all cold, matte colors. Sprites, backgrounds, bullets, everything. It's alright most of the time, but with too many sprites near each other on the wrong background things get a little mushy.
[*] Poorly designed bosses with generic attack patterns and too much HP.
[*] Final boss literally spams the same exact attack for several minutes, with only slight variations to dissuade the player from sitting in the most obvious safe spot I've ever seen. Some ships probably break this boss completely.
[*] Final boss will take at least 8 minutes or so, assuming you haven't lost any power-ups and are dealing damage efficiently.
[*] Power-ups affect the game to a ridiculous degree. If you get hit even once you will be underpowered and forced to leave half of the enemies untouched until the game decides to give you another one.
[*] Bombs do nothing other than deal damage.
[*] Too many ships with too many gimmicks, impossible to balance.
[*] Controls aren't rebindable.
[*] Shift is bound to pause.
[*] Analog movement.
[*] Digital movement with stick, d-pad or arrow keys is too sensitive for precise movement in certain situations.
[*] Input is oddly unresponsive and inconsistent. Sometimes the game just doesn't do what you tell it to, almost like the inputs are being queued and delayed at random somehow. This happens on every keyboard, gamepad and stick that I've tried, on multiple computers.
[*] No DirectInput support.
[*] No TATE mode.
[*] Music is lame.
[*] Said lame music gets re-used for multiple stages.
[*] Shoehorned story that couldn't be any less interesting.
[*] Cutscenes.
[*] Voice acting that manages to feel more forced and out of place than the cutscenes themselves.
[*] Much more that I'm forgetting.

Since the game has improved overall after the couple big updates, I'll give the developers the benefit of the doubt and assume they actually care about the game they put out and weren't simply cheesing the system to get SGS listed under the new releases tab several times over a 2-3 year span. Either way, shoot-em-ups clearly aren't their strong suit and I absolutely do not recommend this game to anyone.

Yes I know the trailer says ""Not bullet hell"", but just watch a video of the final boss and you'll get what I mean by ""a tiny bit of bullet hell"".

Keep in mind there's no control rebinding, so if you're someone who hates arrow keys, then you might need to take that into consideration. Personally I'd like to rebind the super to X, but it's no big deal. Arrow keys, Z, and spacebar is a sensible enough control scheme for me.

In any case, I love the music, the graphical style, and the sound design. Plus I appreciate the selection of 14 ships each with its own set of stats and weapons.

The game is a lot more forgiving than most games of its type in that when you die you just restart the stage you're on, and if you quit the game you can actually come back and pick up from the start of the stage you were on. Also, your ship can take more than one hit (on normal mode). It can actually take quite a few hits, and enemies (and their missiles) can drop health when destroyed. 

When you get hit you'll drop one of your acquired firepower power ups, which after a couple of seconds will be available for you to pick up again. This actually adds an interesting dynamic, in that you probably want to pick up that power up, but you're probably going to have to weave through a shower of bullets to get to it... and if you get hit then you're just going to drop more power on top of taking more damage. Of course, none of this matters in hardcore mode because getting shot will just kill you then.

Super Galaxy Squadron is a great little ""flow"" shmup: you fall into a pattern of sweeping the screen left to right and back, blowing stuff up and picking up power ups.  It's a _little_ repetitive and the enemy attack patterns/level design don't vary enough to seriously knock you out of your zone, but this serves to create a pleasant state of zen-like focus and flow while playing. (Note: I'm a long-time player of shmups, so your state of zen, boredom, or extreme panic may vary depending on your experience with the genre and taste for difficulty...)

There's a simple combo/multiplier system, but it doesn't force me play the game strategically because the level design and enemy waves don't seem distinct enough to make strategies for maintaining your combo apparent to me.

The key source of variety comes from strong collection of different kinds of ships.  I haven't had a chance to try them all yet, but each requires a slightly different play style to pilot successfully.  The ships seem to range from standard shmup tropes to more creative and unique attack types.  The different ships provide a good source of replay value, outside of leaderboard climbing.

Graphics and audio are excellent, couldn't ask for more from a retro-inspired shmup!

The game's normal mode is pretty forgiving (a shmup beginner might not think so), and hardcore is of course hardcore. (one hit you're dead)

All in all a pretty good, well executed shmup at a good price!  Veterans might not find much meat on the bone, but this would be a good start for beginners to learn the basic skills required for the genre.",1430923660,1472149705,True,7,1,0.566418111324310303,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The updated art and the little cutscenes between stages have brought this game a long way forward. A lot of my previous concerns like the music not looping cleanly appears to have been fixed as well. Same goes for the tweaked bosses, the overall difficulty of the game with the new difficulty settings, as well as the improved hardcore mode. The fact that it is a free major update is great of the developer to do as well. It's exactly what the game needed.

It has become an enjoyable game. Looking forward to checking out the new modes that are still on the way. I will get the sequel too whenever that comes out.


Old review for Super Galaxing Squadron classic:

Super Galaxy Squadron is not bad, but it's less than what I expected it to be.

Normal Mode is not a big challenge as it feels like the life bar lasts forever (I reached the stage 6 boss second form on the first try and cleared the game on the 2nd attempt), while in Hardcore mode from what I could tell if you get hit once you have to start the level over. I think my skill level is probably more at a middle ground between the two, but the game doesn't offer this.

The art is nice but I only noticed 1 enemy ship (pink one) which was actually animated. The music was decent but not very memorable. Only the title screen music and the stage 6 music stood out for me, although some of the music did not loop naturally.

The power up system wasn't fun for me. The power ups dropped by enemies don't fall down to you, they just kind of sit there and move a small amount before fading away. If you get hit you will also usually lose one of your powerups, which fly upwards and can't be picked up again for a couple of seconds. The tried and true hyper system is fine though and the ships do feel a bit different from each other, although I only tried a handful of them.

However, the worst part about the game is the bosses. The boss patterns are boring. Aside from the stage 5 and 6 bosses, the rest just repeat the one pattern over and over. The stage 6 boss was the best out of all, and although I did feel like I had seen the patterns before in other games, I liked it and wished the same attention had been given to the other bosses as well.

I found the most enjoyment in endless mode, since I was able to zone out and fly around shooting things and dodging bullets, without having to face any of the bosses.

In all, I would say that the game is worth a try. You may like it more than I did. But it's not something I can see myself coming back to or getting friends to play.",1426683303,1457805206,True,2,0,0,7,True,False,False,False,,,

As a shmup fan, I got teased by that trailer and it does not, even close, deliver the same experience which it presents. 

Pros:
- art styles
- music

Cons:
- Huge flaw: it does not support arcade sticks (mine is a mad catz TE2).

- Unbalanced difficulty (normal mode seems very easy mode by stage 3 and becomes hell on stage 4).

- Bosses are boring, a big box with no animation. Takes forever to be defeated.

- Lack of lives, you die in some point close to the end of stage, you restart at the beginning, even on normal mode. 

- By mid stage 3 you get hit by enemy and right away you get a heath item, you dont feel to be hit anytime actually, looks like you are invincible up to this point. And then, the screen gets horribly filled with enemy ships taking forever hits to be destroyed, just like the bosses,

Most games in this genre devote very little effort to storytelling, and while I wouldn't exactly call SGS a story-heavy game, I found myself getting into the world/story far more than I do with typical shmups.  My favorite touch was the couple sentences of backstory provided for each of the 14 playable ships on the ship select screen; amazing how much depth that adds to the game's world.

The soundtrack, created by Random Encounter, is fantasic, though it would've benefited from a couple more tracks. (Finish the game for an extra special version of the title theme~)

The game plays very tight and is filled with beautfiul, crisp 16-bit sprites. The difficulty curve feels just about perfect although veteran shmup players will probably be bored for the first few stages.

This is a symptom of the one real problem I had with the game: the lack of a deep scoring system. Typically shmups feature some sort of complex scoring dynamic that calls for some specific strategy to maximize your scoring (for example the spectacular ""Vaunt"" scoring system in Jamestown); this gives higher skill players something to go for on easier stages where survival isn't really a concern. SGS sports a very simple combo system that rewards you for killing enemies in quick succession (before your combo meter resets).  Unfortunately, the player really has very little control over maintaining a combo due to the way the enemies spawn and ultimately most players will end up ignoring the combo meter entirely. Even something as simple as being able to slow down or freeze your combo meter by letting go of the fire button would make going for high scores much more interesting.

Despite the lack of scoring depth, I'd still highly recommend this to anyone remotely interested in a good arcadey experience.  This game's difficulty makes more accessible than the average shmup a is great bridge to more difficult games like Ikaruga and Gradius.",1423927460,1423927460,True,6,1,0.519480526447296143,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Check the controls if you need to, regardless you're reminded of them at the start of each mission incase the slaughter of thousands of angry aliens from Tau Ceti has melted your mind.  Scoreboards?  Yeah, check them in the options or on Steam.

Outside of the options, there's a button aptly labeled, ""start.""  Hit that and choose your mode.  Normal mode provides you with a health bar, and when that shit hits zero, you've added one last explosion into the mix, and start the level over.  Continues?  Plenty of them!  Want to stop playing and pick it back up later?  You sure as hell can!  Collect your power-ups for your main spread, secondary weapon, and a boost to your rate of fire.  Check the status of each by pausing, it'll tell you.  So you've noticed the, ""Hyper,"" bar in the lower left?  Good.  That's your special weapon, and each ship has a different one.  Think Normal is too easy?  Shift into Hardcore and get blasted in the face!  One hit, you're done, son, back to the beginning of the level.  This time, you can't continue forever, so make it count!

""Endless mode?  What's that?""  It's exactly what you think it is, an endless wave of those ET fuckers coming for you, and only you, since their buddies were ripped apart on your last excursion in the twilight.  The lower right of the screen has a number, that's what wave you're on, and it caps out at 30 when shit gets downright bananas.  Survive as long as you can, rack up that score, and brag about it after seeing your name on the global leaderboards, if you're good enough that is.  Oh yeah, there's a hardcore mode for this shit, too.

""Can there be any more to this already amazing game?!""  Yes.  That music you hear?  That's done by the fantastic band, Random Encounter.  Check those guys out.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Super Galaxy Squadron is one of the best retro Arcade Shoot’Em up games I have had the pleasure to play for quite a while. 

Lovers of retro games will be fond of this one and if you are of a certain age (like Yoda and me), you will experience a trip back to memory lane where all good games were setup like a booth with an old television set right in front of you, a stick on the left hand side of the panel with a fairly large red ball for a good and stable grip. And 2 buttons on the right side which were usually red and yellow. Too bad if you were right handed, impossible to play with your back facing the television set!

Coming back to the game, you can choose to play a new, endless or continue a game in normal or hardcore mode. Then, you have to make the tough decision as to which spaceship you are going to fight with. Fourteen to choose from; some have more power than others and so on and so forth. All spaceships have their own Hyper strike if you want to call it that, again some more effective than others.

After that it’s all about avoiding the onslaught of your enemies’ fire power like some sort of illusionist and at the same time destroying them with your powerful arsenal! I FUN FUN FUN! Mind you, the hardcore mode is fairly challenging.

In term of the controls, I find the gamepad the way to go rather than your keyboard. It is just my preference. 

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Great Shoot’Em Up
-	Challenging
-	Achievements
-	Trading cards

Negative:
~~~~~~~ 

-	I feel older now

Good game.

- Please fix the shift pause menu situation, trying to respond to steam chat messages is impossible with the game constantly pausing unpausing

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
- You've done a really good job of making interesting stages
- Your art style is great for making the projectiles pop into the foreground
- The forgiving health / quicksaves is really nice on a first playthrough

[h1]First 4 Bosses[/h1]
- This is the weakest part of the game, there's not enough variety in the bullet patterns of the early bosses
- Players qucikly figure the pattern from there its feels like labor working though that gargantuan health bar while the boss sits there not moving
- You need make destroying health bar more exciting with explosions and the boss shaking violently or give them more variety of bullet patterns to switch iterate through

[h1]Finally[/h1]
- Solid sound track
- I loved the radio chatter between stages
- Overall: Very Positive

La presenza di elementi moderni rivoluziona leggermente la formula di gioco, rendendola valida anche per i più giovani.

I think the main problem i find with the game is that it is ""lifeless"" more or less.

Lets have a checklist to follow:

[b]- Very poor level design.[/b]

This is one of the biggest flaws in the game,. Stages in shmup's need to have a sense of flow about them. Waves, attack formations, enemy tactics, etc. SGS way of doing things is simply to stack as many things as it can that can shoot and spawn in from the top of the screen. The enemies that come towards you feel completely random despite being preset and there is little that breaks this monoity in all of the stages and it creates a frustrating event where 8 to 12 large enemies come at you with little connectivity to each other, some even stacking on top of each other.

It also doesn't help that each stage is set in space. Space is as entertaining in shmup's as what's placed around it and what is placed is either dull single planets or lots of rocks. There is a nice transistion of the background on stage 5 but it's very fleeting.

[b] - Bland boss design [/b]

This is a MAJOR flaw in any game of this genre. All of the bosses in the game are dull, boring boxes that do little to stop you. Most of the bosses have stupid amounts of health and take ages to grind down to dust. They rarely change their attack tactics in response to damage and most of the attack pattens are stupidly easy to dodge out of the way (the 2nd boss is laughable in this respect, as it has no response to the destruction of it's side guns.)

[b] - Spite design is lifeless. [/b]

Other than the player ship and one of the enemy ships, no other spite in the game has any real animations. They just fly at you and shoot. They are shaded colours and some of them are shaped nicely (The 5th stage boss has a nice look to it), but are as lifeless as a cardboard box. Bosses catch fire when low on health (random fire spites drawn over the body) and a few animated lasers but other than that the artwork is as flat as a ironing board.

[b]- Power up system is stupid [/b]

The power up system is wild, untamed and at the same time restrictive and in-organic. In each stage you can collect 1 of each of the power-ups (bullet power-up, sub-weapon power-up dependent on the ship you play as and rate of fire power-up), because of this you can't organicly collect more power ups than the stage number allows (You can collect more if you lost some, but you can't pass the limit set by the stage number). In addition, when you get hit there is a random chance that you will drop a power-up. You can recollect it after a delay but all of these power-ups fly upwards, but because every enemy ship in the game is constantly spawning (outside of bosses) you WILL get hit again by another enemy if you attempt to collect it. Btw.. it is possible to get hit multible times in quick sucession, with the possiability of dropping more than 1 power up.

The biggest problem with this is when fighting bosses. Some bosses are very large and will cover the screen.. and if you get hit that power-up will fly up into the boss's body. During boss battles, there is no way to gain new power-ups so if you lose any of your power-ups you started the boss with you then it will take a even longer grind to kill the boss.

[b] - Poor ship balance [/b]

Yea.. this is often a reason why in many shmup's they keep the playable number of ships to a low number. Some of the ships in this game are pretty useless. The one with the flamethrower for example has terrible usability outside of machoists. Some of the other ships will rip stages and bosses apart like there is no tomorrow. The mutli-sweaping laser ship is pretty much a I-win button in stages 90% of the time while the ship ""gold"" is pretty much overpowered to the extreme compared to the other ships.

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]

In all due repect, there are some things i like about the game. The life system is a nice conversion over the traditional lives system in most shmups, including the ability to slowly regain life by grazing enemy shots. The soundtrack was above average in most regards and hardcore mode brings true terror to the the audience that desires a good challenge.



In final, there is little i can recommend to a vet of the genre here that you can't find elsewhere on steam at roughly the same price (Reflex, Kamui, Crimson Clover). I do respect the devs making the game for chaity, it's just that the majority of the design is something from a run of the mill game from MS-DOS days.. and not the good ones sadly.",1422115815,1422257161,False,127,6,0.662110507488250732,27,True,False,False,False,,1541810009.0,"We've rebuilt and rebooted the game TWICE in the last 3 years since your original review of the original version.
